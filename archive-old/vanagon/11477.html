Subject:       Re: Fuel Injection Cleaner




&gt; Here's one for the home tool kit that you don't need to bring on the 
&gt; road.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Gas has gotten 'better' but deposits still form on the injectors,
&gt; especially in our hot engine compartments.  Here's how to clean them
&gt; for a high initial expense ~$55 but very effective after the setup
&gt; is made.
&gt; 
&gt; 3M makes a kit containing all the parts but it is VERY expensive.  A
&gt; cheaper route is to just buy the following:
&gt; 
&gt; -get just the hose from the kit, it is available separately.  this 
&gt; hose consists of a threaded adapter to go on a can of 3M cleaner, an 
&gt; on/off valve, and a brass fitting at the end.  this hose will cost 
&gt; ~$35 as opposed to over $200 for the kit.
&gt; 
&gt; - also, while at the FLAPS, buy a can of the 3M cleaner, these are 
&gt; pricey (~$16)
&gt; 
&gt; -take the hose to any good hardware store that has plumbing fittings. 
&gt;  buy: a small galvanized female 'T'
&gt;           a M-M adapter (brass) that goes from the end of the 3M hose 
&gt; and threads into the 'T'
&gt;           a male thread nipple that fits the other end of the 'T' and 
&gt; terminates in a 1/4&quot; hose barb
&gt;           a 0-100 psi water pressure gauge with a bottom thread that 
&gt; fits into the top of the 'T'
&gt;           a 2 foot section of 1/4&quot; fuel line
&gt;           2 small hose clamps
&gt; 
&gt; assemble this all together with teflon tape on the threads.  use 1 
&gt; hose clamp on the fuel line to barb connection and loosely place the 
&gt; other clamp on the open end of the fuel line
&gt; 
&gt; To use:
&gt;  this whole setup attaches onto fuel system from the little
&gt; T-shaped thingy right by the distributor.  depressurize the van fuel
&gt; system then unsrew that tiny bolt in the top of the T.  attach the
&gt; free end of the fuel line hose from the tool you just made. 
&gt; energize the fuel pump once and then disconnect.  start and run the
&gt; engine at idle until it dies.   there are good instructions on the
&gt; can of 3M cleaner but essentially what this system does is run your
&gt; engine for about 10 minutes off of this (large) can of pressurized
&gt; injector cleaner.  when the can is empty, the engine dies and your
&gt; injectors are clean! 
&gt; 
&gt; This has noticably smoothed out the idle on both of my vans.  I like to do it 
&gt; about once a year.
&gt; 
&gt; An advantage of this setup is that one also gets to watch fuel 
&gt; pressures on the guage.  Helps to determine how the regulator is 
&gt; working.  Do not use this setup on CIS systems as the fuel pressures 
&gt; run too high. 
&gt; 
&gt; If this isn't clear let me know and I'll fill in the gaps.
&gt; 
&gt; -dan
&gt; 

Would not putting in a can of Chevron Techlorine a tank or two before 
an oil change have the same effect?  I run on Chevron Supreme, and 4 
times a year put in Chevron's wonder additive.  The van runs like a 
top.  It is important to do an oil change after a burning these 
cleaners as the deposits end up in the oil.  Just my 0.02 worth.
