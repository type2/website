&gt; 
&gt; &gt;* Not-too-subtle metallic clatter from the rear especially
&gt; &gt;noticeable during engine deceleration and intermittently at idle
&gt; &gt;when hot (tight valve? loose tin?)
&gt; 
&gt; My 87 Syncro has this sound and mine comes from a loose heat sheild on the
&gt; exhaust pipe near the muffler.  One of the brackets holding the shield in
&gt; place is broken.  Non-Syncros do NOT have this shield.
&gt; 

Yes, the '86 GL I had did this, oooh very anoying, fixed it with a C-clamp.
