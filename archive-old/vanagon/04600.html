Subject: Re: traction? we donn need no stinkin traction ...

&gt;andy wanted to know if anyone else had experienced lack-o-traction in the
&gt;later model buses. me.  my 88 spins the tires much more easily that the
&gt;old 80 model bus ever did. with the same tires.
&gt;
&gt;Yup, me too. I've lost the back end a couple of times on rainy on-ramps, 
just accelerating into the curve and the back broke loose. Recovers fine 
when you let off the gas, just a little snappier than I was used too, moving 
up from the '78 to the '85. Ditch the Continentals ASAP!
        Off-roading, my vote goes to any 1800-2000 cc airooled, excluding 
the vanagons! Front end just floats in the old busses, weight transfer to 
the back wheels gets them to dig in fine. I've driven in deep mud and up 
rutted ski hills (in summer) in older busses, no way would I take my 2WD 
vanagon near similiar stuff. 
        Joels right, no matter what you're driving, don't ever stop. I sank 
a '71 Westy to the belly in mud when I slowed to ford a stream in a logging 
road. Up to that point it was fine motoring as I drove in along scenic 
gentle curves. The tow truck guy, with 150 feet of borrowed cables and 
chains pulled me out in a straight line, sunk to the pan all the way. Don't 
wait for spring, wait for summer to go boonie-bashing!
