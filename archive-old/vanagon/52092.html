Subject: /f? Vanagon in Song Lyrics
Date: 22 Nov 96 06:52:12 PST

Hi All -
After a couple of months, I finally got the lyrics to the song 
&quot;Girls of Boise&quot; written and performed by Brian McMahon.  The first 
line contains a reference to a Vanagon.  The song is not *about* a 
Vanagon, just refers to it.  As to the song itself, it would be 
classified in the *really* *alternative* folk/rock/singer/songwriter world.  
Actually the song sounds pretty good.

I have heard this song twice now on the local Community Radio station 
KVMR (all volunteer DJ's) in Nevada City, CA.  Both times have been 
while I was working on my Vanagon, natch.

The following is the reply to my query for the lyrics from the 
artist/performer.

- Jeff
(2) '80 Westi's

WARNING - The lyrics may offend some as it is a look at a group of 
people the artist labels &quot;Lesbian Avengers&quot;.  
If this potentially offends you , please delete.

The Girls from Boise

Another Vanagon pulled up last night
God-awful rude and noisy
Jack- boot impressions everywhere they go
They're never quiet and coy, see
These are the Girls from Boise
Another wave arrives here late today
Not that they'd give me notice
But now I know based on what they don't say (their operandi modus)
more's comin' than they told us

These are the Girls from Boise, women without fear
Where are those two shy co-eds that rented the 3rd floor rear?

Flat-painted laundry truck in need of brakes
is leaking leaded fuel
Across contiguous United States
the girls that Sappho knew are cutting work and school

I call them Girls from Boise, women in disguise
Punctured and tatooed with an ax to grind

But frankly, I'm afraid to speak my mind
What if they trounce landlords to unwind?

Another vehicle, midwestern plates,
docks with a loud backfire
I'm now resigned they'll overrun this place
I'll never match that ire
They stoke a hotter fire
These are the Girls from Boise, women with a cause
They've no respect for Ghandi, Christ or Santa Claus
We watch the Girls from Boise, breaking nature's laws 
The Girls from Boise, Ken dolls in their jaws



       c 1995 Brian McMahon
