&gt; So Jim Macklow says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Saw a '90 Syncro Camper for sale at one of the local repair shops.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 47K miles
&gt; &gt; Here's the killer... I saw the &quot;sale&quot; sticker on the side, so I walked
&gt; &gt; in and asked what his price was.  $24,500!!!  Derek Drew, don't die 
&gt; &gt; laughing at this absurd price.  The guy told me with a straight face
&gt; &gt; that people's mouths drop when they hear the price, or they just walk 
&gt; &gt; out without another word.  I just started laughing, until he said, very
&gt; &gt; seriously, &quot;Well, someone will pay that much.&quot;  
&gt; &gt; 

To which Steven Johnson replies:
&gt; 
&gt; Quite franky, I don't see what's so hilarous either considering the
&gt; availability and demand for the Syncro.
&gt; 

Well, considering I've seen '89 - '91 Syncro Westies in the paper for
sale at SF Bay area VW dealerships for $17K - $21K, I thought his price
was laughable.  But, I suppose he'll be the one with the smile on his
face when someone coughs up the dough.  Between the dealers and private
parties that advertise in the SF Chronicle, there always seems to be
about 2-3 Syncro Westies, and another 1-2 Syncro Transporters advertised
in the Friday news.  They don't seem to be _that_ rare around here.
