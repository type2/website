&gt; Dear bus fanatics,
&gt;   I have a 73 bus with the 1700cc engine. Runs fine, but I was wondering if
&gt; I can fit the big 2000cc fuel injected engine if I ever have to put in a new
&gt; one. Any opinions out there ???

I'm going to do this soon.  The flywheel on the 2.0 is larger (228 vs
210 mm, I think) so you will have to upgrade your clutch and pressure
plate.  Don't use the smaller one, the 2.0 will likely overpower it.
If you use the FI you will have to install the brain and lots of other
crap and possibly have smog check problems (oh wait, probably NOT in
Oregon!) or you can keep your original heads and intake and have your
heads flycut to fit the 94mm cylinders.  You will also need to adjust
your carbs, I think.  Probably larger jets.  I think it will be worth
it, in my case.

BTW, I saw what the core charge is for 2.0 rods - $100 *each*.  Don't
think you can build a 2.0 from a 1.7/1.8 if you don't have the 2.0
rods.  :/
