&gt;'84 Vanagon GL  Digijet -- ongoing rich running problem.
&gt;
I had a similar problem with my van shortly after replacing the motor. I was
driving to the BUG OUT,
when exiting the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel my van started bucking and blowing
black smoke. It was running
VERY rich. I finally made to the Bull Run campground but had to stop 2x to
remove and clean the spark
plugs. Also my to speed was about 35 miles per hour... not very good for I95.

After arriving at the campground I took out my vom meter and my Bentley book
and proceeded to check 
all the FI parts. I couldn't find anything wrong.

Luckily Dennis Haynes was coming to the campground later that day and he was
able to diagnose the 
problem(It took him about 15 min.) 

The problem was the starter wire had  a break in it and the computer was
constantly going into the 
cold-start mode and enriching the mixture.

The moral of the story is ... sometimes it is not what you expect. Don't
discount any possibilities.
