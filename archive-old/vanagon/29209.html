One thing I noticed and forgot to mention in the Gerbil update is an
oddness in the rearmost cooling tin.  This is the piece that the fresh
air tubes go through to connect to the heater boxes, and is on a level
with the rear deck (which is what the engine compartment cover latches
to).  In any case, in addition to the two holes for the fresh air
ducts, and the half-circle things that go fit up around the heat riser
tubes, are two more holes.  They're about two-thirds the diameter of
the fresh air holes, and are slightly to the rear (FIF) and closer to
the midline than the fresh air holes.  Any idea what these might be?

My guess is that they are for a later-model bus that has some sort of
emission-control plumbing, but that's purely a guess.  My current plan
is to cover them with duct tape, since all they're doing right now is
allowing used engine air back into the engine compartment.

Thanks.
