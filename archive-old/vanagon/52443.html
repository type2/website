Subject: Cool Van things


   I was in the fuse box today. I noticed this big red thing
   sticking in the area of the relays.
   After playing with it I was able to remove it. I found It
   was a tool to remove the fuses!!!! 

   And I have have Vanagons for 11 years. THis is where the 
   manual would have helped.  
   
   Also I think that the earlly
   Vanagon don't have this because there fuse boxes aren't the same.
