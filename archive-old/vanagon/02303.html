Subject: gasoline differences

I do not mean to beat a dead horse to pieces, but....
On the matter of gasoline choice between brands, I've found out that it
is the gas station that matters.  For instance, I've heard a lot of rumor
that, especially in urban areas where the city officials are already
overloaded, quite a significant percentage of gas station owners
&quot;blend&quot; the super with a little of the regular... 
On another related matter, the condition of the gas station's fuel
tanks seem to play an important role, as some of them are pretty old
and may actually hold water and dirt more than others.
Third, if you see a fuel delivery tanker at the gas station you are about
to buy gas from, drive to the next station.   The dirt and water at the
bottom of the station's tank get stirred up during fuel delivery from
the tanker to the station's tank, and it takes a while to settle down.


My approach is that I usually try a few of the gas stations around, and
watch the mileage I get.  Then I stick with the one that gets the best mileage,
using super (of course, this may not be the best choice, if some
other arguments made on this topic are considered..).  So far, this has
turned out to be a good approach -- my AUDI 5000 now has about 175,000 miles
on it, and even though everything in it is about to fall apart, the engine
is still humming along, and still getting better than 30mpg.

BTW, here's another one for the speed freaks (I'm ashamed of myself for
admitting this) 115 mph with the audi (5spd, NO turbo), on the 10-mile
stetch of I-78 between Bethlehem, PA and NJ border...
