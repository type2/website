&gt; Hi, all
&gt; 
&gt; You might think that my desire for US license plates is a
&gt; bit bizarre, but hey have you ever seen UK plates - they suck.
&gt; 
&gt; It all started when I got my first bus and decided to &quot;CAL&quot; it.
&gt; I smoothed it off etc.. and fitted California license plates.
&gt; There's a company over here which will press out your UK
&gt; number onto a California (or any state) plate.
&gt; They made my bus really stick out in a crowd - along with my
&gt; US spec rear light (all red).
&gt; 
&gt; You might thick why don't you move to the US - hell I might!
&gt; 
&gt; Well anyway I've got a thing going with all you US'ers and
&gt; I'm gonna have a wall full of lisence plates - that'll impress
&gt; the babes -huh -huh -huh (Beavis and Butthead type laugh!)
&gt; 
&gt; Lee.

Hell... Over here I've always thought it would be cool to have Euro style 
plates...   :)
