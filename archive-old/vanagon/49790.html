Subject: Re: CCC's lost &amp; found


This was my first CCC outing, and my wife and kids sure enjoyed it.  It
was great to meet some of the folks from the lists (although I'm still
off the list temporarily).  The Hot-springs-showers were way cool (well
al least figuratively!) and Kathy's bus was *PURPLE*.

I guess all of the busses made it up the hill -- we saw none on the side.
We even made it up going the speed limit the whole way!  Sure glad the
road has a 15 mph limit -- that was ours as well.  We were not so popular
on the Tioga Road out of Lee Vining.  Fifteen doesn't seem to cut it with
the other drivers there.

We saw two Syncro GL's on the way home, one at the 395/120 juction, another
near Tioga pass.  Musta been a convention.  With &quot;R 4X4 VW&quot; at the campout, 
was three of these things in the immediate area.  Maybe it's one of those
Nevada X-files things.

Wave count was low, although we saw many other Vanagons.  Our only returned
wave was from a splitty camper going into Yosemite Valley.  I guess the others
were all worn out from waving at all of the other CCC folks that passed before
us.
