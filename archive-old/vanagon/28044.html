&gt;
&gt;(Maybe)).  Anyway, let me know if you got anything.  You see I had a
&gt;dream last night where someone sold me a mint shell and I thought it
&gt;would be really cool.  Howabout someone's discarded project?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

I found the following in the Chicago Area Trading Times:

     64 VW bus collectors item, needs restoration, no motor, no
     int., body completely gone over &amp; primed, have many brand
     new parts, $275.  (708) 540-8820.

I called, owner at college (surprise, surprise), brother says PO
was into fiberglass.  I already have three running and one for
parts,  so I did not go look.  Should I?
