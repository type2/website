Subject: High Temp CV Grease

I have a front outer CV joint on the 90 with a pin hole in it. It seems like
it got a pin hole in it because someone squeezed the CV Joint Boot before
tightening the clamp so it had a vacume that distorted the boot. I have to
replace the boot, a task I have never done before so I am trying to figure
out if I can do it myself.

I am reading a Technical Information sheet issued by VW August 5, 1987 on CV
joints. It says, 

&quot;A noisy CV Joint could be caused by hardened and dried lubricant. 
--disassemble and inspect all joints, repack serviceable joints using new
high temperature grease Part Number G 000 603.&quot;

Now I am wondering what is so good about this new grease and whether, if one
were to buy CV joint grease at FLAPS it would be this high temperature type.
 

I am looking at the grease sold by the Parts Place (formerly recycled bugs)
in Auburn Hills, Michigan. They call theirs &quot;Super Grease!!. Super Special
Molybedeum disulfide, a grease which water won't wash off. This is a black
slippery yet sticky stuff made specifically for CV joints. It takes the heat
of friction while NOT washing out with water and salt. If you don't believe
me, rub some on your pants and see how many washings it takes to get it out!
Grease for all C.V. -- waterproof. One rube does one C.V. either inner or
outer.&quot;

So what does every body say about this? Stick with VW grease or not? Are
there aftermarket sources for the &quot;high temp&quot; grease or not? Where do you
guys buy your grease?
