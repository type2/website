Howdy...

After two weeks in the shop our EV is finally home again safe and sound.

My brother borrowed our one month old EV.  Then he was hhit by a semi.  
(Breath in).   But, it was going backwards and no one was hurt.  (Breath out.) 
We had the bumper and the rear hatch replaced and it is good as new.

We had the work done at OWASCO near Toronto.  They did very good work.  Pin 
stripe andpaint are an excellent match.  Indistingishable.  The only defect i 
can see are a few pin head sized imperfections in the paint in the inside of 
door.  

We are look forward to suing our van for the first time!

Marion and Chris

PS...  OWASCO had some good look EV for sale.  They ahd a 94 with 32,000km 
auto for about 31-32,000$
