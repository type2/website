Subject: 1983 balljoints?

I have a 1983 diesel GL that makes an ugly 'clunk' when going over bumps
at low speed.  I have replaced the rack &amp; pinion due to excesive play
and the tie rod ends; to no avail.

Is it possible that the lower ball joints are gone?  My mechanic says
they are ok, he prys on the joint to check for play.  I am not sure this
is a valid check, does anyone know a more foolproof check?  What
experience have any list members had with ball joints/front end clunks?

We have owned our van since new, it has 225 000 km (~135 000 mi).
