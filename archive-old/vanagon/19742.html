Subject: Sergio's horror story

	Sergio,
	I'd get a lawyer- and shop it- talk to a couple first- and
talk court dates with the worthless scum at the local dealer. Hard
to say what you can get, if anything, out of the out-of-town shop.
	Don't expect a miracle, and you'll probably pay some pro-rating
on some of the parts. But you should demand and get a car that runs as
well when they're done as when they started. Unfortunately, if they
are really incompetent, you don't want them doing the work, and
that's what they'll want to do.

	Decide how much money they owe you, keep track of your legal
fees, estimate your personal expenses over the actual repairs (Time
wasted at your normal consulting rate of $50/hr) and FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER SHOP. Get a diagnosis and estimate from them- in fact, get
several diagnoses and estimates. Decide who you want to fix your car
and demand that their fixing it is part of your settlement with the idiots
you started with.

	VW are correct, they only cover internal engine parts and smog
stuff after 24,000 miles. Remember that VW sell to the dealer- they
back the warranty, but the dealer, not you, are their customer. THEY
didn't get much of the $5000.00+ you've shelled out, and what they
did get, went for parts which are probably ok. Your problem is
completely incompetent mechanics.

	Next time I'm in Texas, I'll certainly avoid the Benson dealers.
Maybe a Ford would get better service. Certainly the German products
require skilled maintenance and aren't as robustly over-built as
US products. And do keep track of the whole mess and send a photo
copy of the final settlement and your feelings to VWoA. Enough complaints
about bad service CAN get a franchise pulled. I've seen it happen.

	Good Luck.
	Bill
