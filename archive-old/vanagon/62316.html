Subject: Re: Hesitation, Hesitation Again!

Volks Folks,
Anyone with any ideas to fix the irritating hesitation on my 86.  It never
stranded me but is sure pisses me off.  I know this is a common problem and
have read on the list of various solutions that have worked for others.  I am
tempeted to purchase a new ECU but if anyone out there in VW land has another
less costly idea I sure would greatful.  Here's a list of what I have done.

 1.  New O2 sensor
 2.  New throttle switch
 3.  New fuel sensors installed
 4.  Rebuilt Air Flow meter installed
 5.  Air Flow harness installed
 6.  Fuel Filter, new
 7.  Cap, rotor, plugs, plug and coil wires all new
 8.  Installed new grounding straps on both heads.
 9.  Checked for corrosion on the Idle Stabilizer sensor (cleaned)
10.  Checked the air in the tires and washed it REAL good.


                                     Send Help Please
