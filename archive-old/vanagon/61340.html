&gt; which stands the roller up of the roof at an angle.  This also makes it
&gt; tall enough.  I've been toying with the idea of getting one but I am
&gt; monetarilly challanged at the moment.  Let me know how you like it if you

Wendy &amp; John &amp; Listees,

I just bought the Dometic A&amp;E Catalina 2500 at Camping World, list price
$299.95  They had a $25 off coupon special, and if you join the
&quot;President's Club&quot; for $20, you get 10% off, or an additional $30 off.
(Sort of worth it.)  Install it yourself with the somewhat confusing
instructions and save the $30 installation fee.  The van mounting kit is
the most dubious value at $42, but necessary.  I love the awning.  When
you get the hang of it, it's an easy one-person operation.  

I called Carefree of Colorado, but they weren't very helpful, so I just
went with the A&amp;E.
