Subject: WESTY FABRIC

Well due to a hard drive crash I lost my address book ( it's backed up on tape 
but I can't restore it to my fall-back computer -- not much of a backup then is 
it ;-) ).

Well I can't remember the name of the person who was selling us the plaid Westy 
Fabric from the Trim Shop.  Please send me an e-mail if you're out there.  Or if 
anyone else who was in on this deal can send me his adress.  Has anyone received 
their fabric yet?

Thanx.

Sorry to post this to both lists but I figured that there might be people 
involved in this deal that were on the watercooled list.
