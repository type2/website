&gt; &gt;I use a product called Kroil made by Kano Labs in Nashville, TN.
&gt; 
&gt; I use it too, and I also like it better than Liquid Wrench.  I got one of
&gt; the package deals that included a &quot;Kroiler&quot; (old-fashioned can with spout
&gt; and squeeze handle) and an &quot;AeroKroil&quot; can (aerosol - worth it's weight in
&gt; platinum).

My favorite is Mopar heat control valve penetrant (or something like that).
It's available for about $6/can only at your local Didge/Chrysler dealer,
and worth every penny.  It's kinda foamy and black.
