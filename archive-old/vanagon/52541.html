 who out there has converted the ol' non self adjusters to being so?
 
 imean, we have people putting t-3 irs into everything from ghias and 
 bugs, to buggys, so why not v-gon brakes in a loaf? hmm..:)

The parts will actually bolt into the 73 and up busses.  Personally, Although
I like the convienence, I do not like the design.  The self adjusters operate
at the top of the shoes with the cylinder.  The bottom of the shoes never get
used.  In order for this to work, the drums can not be oversized at all (only
1 cut) and factory mettalic shoes ($$$) should be used for reasonable life.
 WHeel cylinders are the same except for a spring to push the pistons out.
 Many aftermarket repalcements leave out the springs for the late vans and
they still work.  Sometimes an extra pump will be needed to get a firm pedal.
