Subject: One Way Vaccum Valve? -or- Could this be the problem?

hey now,

okay, been cruising round lately, me and rumba, doing great...then yesterday i
notice a definite lack of power and my brakes are stiff. hmmm...maybe i hear
a vaccum leak to..hmmm...okay, i've yet to track down the leak but i got some
new vacuum hose and will put that on shortly. question: what is the purpose of
a one way vaccum valve? i have one that joins two seperate vaccum hoses..which
is really one..but joined together by this one way vacuum valve. do these wear
out? do they get clogged? i hear a leak under there..seems to be coming from
this valve...any suggestions? on a side note, i cleaned the carb and put on a
new fuel filter, both were dirty and now we seem to run better.
