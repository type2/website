Subject: Getting ready to fire it up

     Just got through installing my new 1776 engine - and am now finishing 
     up a few last things before I fire it up and start the break-in 
     process (pretty much per Hoover).  Unfortunately, I don't have a test 
     stand, so I'm going to have to do it in the vehicle.  A couple of 
     questions:
     
     1)  The Weber Progressive carb came without any instructions - anybody 
     have any advice about dialing it in, changing jets, etc??  I'm told 
     that these work pretty good around here (Denver) out of the box, but 
     if changes are needed, I'd appreciate advice. 
     
     2)  For initial break-in, I have adjusted the Bergmann hydraulic 
     valves to zero clearance (just touching).  I figure I'll add the extra 
     turn or so of adjustment after the first couple hundred miles.  Is 
     this OK?  
     
     3)  Any other helpful hints or ideas??
     
     please reply to this address and to rdyd26a_at_prodigy_dot_com (home)
     
     thanx
