Subject: Re: Kroil!

I can hardly beleave the gall!  First he opens a business,  great 
prices,  efficient shipping and now this!  I really think that 
unsolicited product endorcement should be kept off the list..there is 
no way of knowing where this will lead.  The Audi list doesn't do  
this,  neither does the Porsche list...we must conform...by-the-way 
what was the number for that Kroil stuff again?
