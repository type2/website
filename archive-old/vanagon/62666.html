Subject: FS: '81 Westi $800 N.Ca engine apart
Date: 11 Jul 97 14:06:52 PDT

Found in the Grass Valley paper, called on it and got some details.

'81 Westi, engine lid insulation fell out, got caught in the intake 
and burned up the engine.  A relative took the engine out and it is 
currently dismantled.  Was given a very high estimate to fix it and 
now wants to get rid of it.  I told them they could get an AVP 
rebuild for about $1250.  Three seatbelts in the rear seat PLUS an 
additional 3 seat belts for use with kids on pillows.  They said it 
was in the area behind the engine, but I think they mean on the 
floor.

They say that it is in great shape otherwise.
916-273-1818, $800 as is
