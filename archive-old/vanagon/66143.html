I'm sure they are still there as I went there on sat. and picked up my
new engine. I had the same problems getting thru on their 800# on
Friday.

&gt;Listees,
&gt;
&gt;  I called AVP on their 800# yesterday afternoon.  There's no problem
&gt;with their Phone, ie NOT Disconnected.
&gt;
&gt;  Often in busness it's common to forward calls, maybe Rob got caught in
&gt;the middle of the forwarding etc?
