&gt; Some of you people a while back were talking about VW toys and such so I
&gt; decided to peruse my childhood Matchbox collection while visiting my mother (a
&gt; fatefull trip for my bus, though).  In my younger years I was quite a collector
&gt; and managed to acquire massive amounts of the little diecast buggers.  I did
&gt; manage to find a couple of VWs but I couldn't find my old catalogs with the
&gt; years of all the different series.

I used to have about a bajillion Matchbox and Hot Wheels.

&gt; 
&gt; First of all I found the &quot;Pizza Van&quot; that someone mentioned.  It is indeed a
&gt; bay-window bus (&quot;Dormobile&quot; it says underneath) with &quot;Pizza Van, We Deliver Day
&gt; and Night&quot; silk-screened in red and green on the sides.  The van is white and
&gt; from 1976 (Wow, I can't believe that this thing is 19 years old!).  Oh yeah, it
&gt; has green tinted windows (no interior) and the sliding door on the _left_ hand
&gt; side.

This was after my time.  Guess I'm a bit older - I was trying to get real 
cars by '76.

&gt; 
&gt; The other one is called &quot;Volkswagen Camper&quot;.  It's No. 34 in a series from 1965
&gt; I seem to recall so it's a split window (cool).  The color is silver with
&gt; yellow tinted windows (including the sunroof in a slightly raised roof area). 
&gt; The interior is orange and has facing seats in the rear with a table between. 
&gt; Once again this van is right-hand drive with the side door in the left side
&gt; (these open!).

This sounds like one I had but seem to remember the doors on the right 
side.  I had an earlier version too that was peaa green if I reember 
correctly.  Had so many different versions of bugs its impossible to 
remember.  Had type III fastbacks and other oddities.  I hope I can find 
these at my Dad's house.  I keep looking but they seem to be in one of 
those deep dark recesses.

&gt; 
&gt; Uh, I also found my die-cast Millenium Falcon but you guys probably wouldn't
&gt; care about that.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, hope this helps someone.
&gt; 
&gt; -Erik
