Subject: Re: HELP! '64 ignition shot?


&gt;I've had a couple of instances on my '64 (6 volt) when I turn on the 
&gt;headlights and the engine dies in mid-flight. &lt;snip&gt; While it was 
&gt;warming up I turned on the lights and the engine died. When I tried 
&gt;to restart it, it wouldn't start, I got no dash lights at all and 
&gt;realized I had no power at all (no headlights, radio, interior lights 
&gt;etc).

&gt;Any ideas? Would a bad switch kill ALL electricity? Are '60 and '64 switches 
&gt;incompatible? What am I missing?

Where does the ignition switch get it's power from?  You guessed it... 
the headlight switch!  You have a short in the headlight switch.
