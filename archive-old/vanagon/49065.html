&gt; Great idea, Steve.

&gt; Going back to Elizabeth Furnace would be fantastic, as it will be
&gt; prime fall colors and very beautiful.  However Skyline Drive  will be
&gt; literally bumper-to-bumper with leaf peepers, and I'd suggest finding 

I am definitely in this time any way round, but I might interject that
Southern WV will be spectacular and perhaps less saturated with
leaf-watchers.  My personal idea is a foray down to the Cass scenic
railroad, (geared Shay and maybe now a Climax locomotives climb an old
logging route to 2500+ feet) and some time in Monongahela Natl Forest. 
A bonus here is a nearly new Natl Forest Service Campground at Scenaca
Rocks (3-4 years old the nicest showers I have seen at $10/night) as
well as the 1'st and 2'nd highest points in the state all within a days
drive of each other, and all spectacular for hiking, camping, and
possibly off-roading though I'm not about to try in the '81.  Greenbank
Natl Radio Observatory 30 minutes from Cass as well and some of the new
dishes are spectacular engineering feats.  Anyway we're talking a start
point about say 3.5 hours west then south of D.C. (at say air cooled
Westy speed) and some of the most spectacular mountain scenery one will
find, course I'm prejudiced and I just did Skyline 2 weeks ago.
