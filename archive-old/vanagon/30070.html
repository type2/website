LED LAMPS
What?? Lamp-based, multi-chip LEDs, if you want to be precise.  Each 
is a lamp like device, 3/8&quot; dia X 1&quot; long O.A.  It can be plugged 
into a standard single contact bayonet base socket.  But the 'lamp' 
is actually an LED or cluster thereof.  (We are not sure)  Each has a 
removable frosted hemispherical dome, and they are called Data 
Dsiplay Model MB400.  Whic is confusing because they come in a 
variety of voltages, currents, and colors.  With high intensity, 
strong color and low current draw they are really cool.  The 15 
volters work on 12 VDC but are slightly dimmer.
