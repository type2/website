Subject: Not a Wanna !


     After nine months of looking, that elusive Syncro Westie has been
     found, and I have a contract to buy it.

     :-)  One careful owner, loaded, 1990, 49,000 miles. Silverish color
          with allow wheels. &quot;It's stunningly beautiful!&quot; says fellow
          vanagon lister Jim Arnott. And the price was right!

     :-(  Its in Oregon, I'm in Maryland. I've never seen it. (I'm not that
          crazy, deal is not final until I do). Needs tires.

     The plan is to fly to Oregon August 15th with my wife and five year
     old son, wrap the deal up, and head south to California where we have
     a wilderness area permit for seven days of backpacking in Sequoia
     Nat'l Park. After that, we head East, avoiding the Interstates to
     return to Maryland by Labor Day. We are thinking of following US 50
     all the way back, but am always open to other ideas...

     I'd be interested in any and all suggestions, especially

     (1) minimum tools required for this trip, above and beyond the &quot;ten
     tools&quot; list on the vanagon server and a Bentley.

     (2) What we will need for life in the camper, beyond what VW supplies.

     Thanks to all who are helping, especially Derek, Jim, and Joel. I
     cannot forget those who helped with other efforts that did not pan
     out, including David Carment and Harry Gates.
