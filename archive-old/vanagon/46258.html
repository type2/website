Subject: Yokohama Y370 tires

We are pretty sure we will get the Yokohama Y370 tires however we still 
have a few questions.

are these highway all season or all terain?

is the C rating alright or should we get the D rating?

what is a reasonable price for these?

what is the mileage warranty?

are these good with fuel consumption?

are these good for long road trips?

are they noisy?

Thanks to everyone for the help you have given us!
