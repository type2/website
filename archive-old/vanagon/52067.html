&lt;&lt; On a '82 diesel Westy, what does the pull out cold start lever actually
do??  I
 looked at the injection pump where the cable attaches and did not see any
 electrical connections.  I used to think that this lever actuated the glow
 plugs, but now I don't see how it could.  What does it do and are the glow
 plugs controlled by a relay, independently??

The cold start lever advances the injection timing.  The glow plugs should
work automatically when you turn the ignition on.
