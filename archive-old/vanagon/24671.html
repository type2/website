Subject: Re: EuroVan Fornt Seats - warranty

    No in'93 there were as far as I know only Westfalia poptops 
imported into the US no Winnies.  So its a '93 EV MV weekender or 
westy, or a T-4... or it could be a ... in Germany it is  a..., 
whatever it is I love it.
   
    Too bad the seat backs rock, lets keep posted if we can fix this.  
Maby someone has this seat problem and also is under warranty, maby you 
could get the dealer to have a look atit.
