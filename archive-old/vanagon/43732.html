Subject: 6v-12v...AGAIN


I really hate to bring this up yet again, but could someone
point me at or mail me a schematic that actively kicks out 6v
from a 12ish v input?

Preferably one that someone has actually gone ahead and implemented/proven.
If the circuit can handle the current required for the wiper, all the better,
but not required.

Thanks,
...Markus
