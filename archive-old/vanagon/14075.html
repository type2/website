Subject: ignition failure

Hi all,

I have the following problem. Sometimes, I the motor has ignition failures, 
especially with low rpm. Two of the ignition cables were quite loose, so I 
replaced them. But nothing changed.

So, what is the problem now. I also noticed that the contact of the 
distributor arm is a bit &quot;charred&quot;.

Any suggestions are appreciated.

T.S.

P.S. Can you remove the distributor head from the screening plate or do you 
have to change them both as one unit?
