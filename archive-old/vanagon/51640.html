 overflow

&gt;&gt; ... I can't for the life of me prevent
&gt;&gt; the tank from overflowing when filling up, unless I use miniscule
&gt;&gt; pressure at the pump.  Does anyone have any pointers as to what, if
&gt;&gt; anything, may be wrong.  Or is this a feature?
&gt;
&gt;My 87 Vanagon GL has the same 'feature'.  If I let the pump go until the
&gt;automatic cut-off, I ALWAYS have fuel spitted back out.  It's been that
&gt;way since I bought it a year and a half ago.
&gt;ANYBODY OUT THERE, PLEASE POST TO THE LIST IF THIS IS NORMAL OR IF THIS
&gt;IS SOMETHING MORE SINISTER!

i don't think it's anything sinister. ;)  with my 88 GL, it seems to make
a big differnce WHICH pump i use at which gas station. some pumps are more
touchy than others. and i've noticed that in other states, the sensitivity
of the pump cut-off also varies.

usually! i can stick the nozzle in and hang the thing on the filler hole,
with the handle in a vertical position, and put the little lock on. most of
the time, it works fine. every now and then, it'll kick-back and splash gas
out.

so all i can advise is to try other pumps and other gas stations and see if
it still happens. also notice if your bus is tilted one way or the other.
there's one station in town that is &quot;tilted&quot; and if i get on the high-side,
it'll always splash back.
