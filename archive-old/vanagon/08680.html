Subject: Rad Fan Switch

Following several suggestions, I checked to see if my radiator was 
air-locked and dont' think it is.  I opened a stud on the top left (as 
you face the radiator) and with the engine running very warm (but only at 
fast idle) and anti-freeze came freely out.  There was only a momentary 
sputter.  I also opened a valve on the top water hose in the engine 
compartment and let the van run a minute or so.

Anyway, I'm still convinced the radiator fan switch isn't running.  The 
motor seems to run hot (if you can trust the very intermittent dash 
gauge), and it smells hot and I get some burbling in the overflow tank, 
so I'm kind of thinking it is hot.

Anyway, I need your advice on replacing the fan switch.  Must the 
radiator be removed to do that?  I have a AC radiator in front of the 
engine radiator. 

It looks like mine is a 3 prong switch screwed into the radiator about 
half way down on the right side (facing radiator from front).  It looks 
like it might be minimally accessible with the right socket wrench, or 
maybe it's too much trouble and I need to dismount everything.

Suggestions?

And do you think I accurately purge tested the air or not?
