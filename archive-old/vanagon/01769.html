Subject:      removing stripes (the 3M way!)

for super easy removal of stripes, (but it's gonna cost ya!), get a spray
can of 3M Decal and Stripe Remover, and a can of 3M Decal and Stripe
Adhesive Remover. i think they cost about $6 per can (you shouldn't need
but one can of each).

the D&amp;S Remover is sprayed onto the stripe (hopefully, it will be over
70 degrees when you do this ... it doesn't work too well in winter. i tried.)
and let it sit per instructions. then you can just peel the vinyl stripe
right off. in stubborn cases (or short fingernails), you might need one of
those plastic bondo-spreader-thingies (a super-thin wedge of soft plastic.
DO NOT USE WOOD or plexigas or lexan. trust me.)

now, when this is done, there is still some adhesive stuck to the car.
that's where the 2nd can comes in. wash/clean off the gunk of the first can,
and spray on the gunk from the 2nd can. then clean it off too.

another alternative to the 2nd can is 3M General Purpose Adhesive Remover.
in quart can. about $7. also works great for bugs, tar, tree sap, but is
totally ineffective against mothers-in-laws.

i never had the money to get a real heat gun, and the hair dryer i tried
didn't work. i ran into this stuff after really scraping and messing up
about a foot or so of my 1980 bus. THEN my idiot brother told me about this
3M stuff.  it really really works. :)

BUT!! do NOT use it on japanese cars!! their plastic mirrors and window
trim is different somehow, and it will leave a milky coating. the coating
will wash off eventually, but it looks bad for a while.

for whatever reason, the stuff doesn't affect the german cars this way. at
it hasn't bothered the four buses i did.

joel
p.s. if anybody wants it, i'll get the product numbers for the stuff when
i get home.
