Subject: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus

The bus I just bought has a four position wiper stalk and no owner's
manual.  From OFF, there are two positions above OFF, and one position
below.  The two above are obviously supposed to be low and hi
(although it doesn't quite work that way--it's more like extra low and
another extra low, no difference).  When I push it down to that lowest
position, the wipers don't run and nothing else seems to happen
either.  What is it supposed to do?  Am I turning someone's wipers on
and off in South Africa?
