&gt;I saw this Ad in my small town paper today:
&gt;VW Syncro 1987 runs great
&gt;some rust $3000 ask for Drew
&gt;(508) 564 6898 That's in Cataumet (Cape Cod) Ma

Somebody go buy this thing if it is as advertised! 

Negotiate down, but even at $3000 you are golden. 
The &quot;runs great&quot; 2.1 liter engine is easily worth
a grand, then there is all the syncro parts! My basement
is already full of syncro stuff, or I would.
