Subject: European or Russian Gas Heater Possibilities

Hi folks,

I'm wondering if anyone has heard of gasoline heater brands from Russia or 
Europe (outside of Germany).  I'm familiar with the German Eberspacher, 
Stewart Warner (American?) and Webasto (Canadian?) name brands, but how 
about other sources around the world?  A friend of mine was in Poland last 
year and he mentioned that he saw nonVW aircooled cars that are fairly 
common over there.  He couldn't provide any info on gas heaters but it got 
me thinking.  Where it's cold and there are aircooled cars, there's a 
chance for a market for the gas heater, assuming the affordability of such 
an option.  Anyone have any leads?
