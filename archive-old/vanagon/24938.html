Subject: Re: lambadas??


&gt;&gt; Lambada?.........Isn't that a dance step or something?  Is the &quot;fuel
&gt;&gt; injection lambada&quot; some variation on the basic lambada dance?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, It's the dance that the exhaust does as it leaves the manifold
&gt;and enters the pipes...
&gt;However, I think that Harmon actually meant La Bamba...
&gt;The Richie Valens song.
&gt;You can, of course, try to Lambada in your bus listening to
&gt;La Bamba... If you're in California, you might even want to do
&gt;it in La Breah (or however those Tar Pits are spelled).
&gt;Or, if in Africa, maybe do it near the Limpopo?


Let's not forget the gyrations of portly radio talk show hosts:

The Limbaughda!
