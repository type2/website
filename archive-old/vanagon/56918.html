Hey all,
OK, it's about 11:30 and I'm gonna hit the road soon and get on the way
to Kiptopeke.  I'm looking forward to meeting you all and the weather's
great for the drive.  Looks like it'll be nice today and tomorrow, but
bring those blankets and heaters for nighttime.  

Please don't reply to this message as I won't get your reply until next
weekend.

See you campers there,
Sean
