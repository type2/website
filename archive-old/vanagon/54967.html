&gt;This may seem dumb, but ever since I've had my Vanagon I've wondered what 
&gt;that round silver thing under the clock, that looks like a cigarette 
&gt;lighter is.  I've looked through the books and nothing is mentioned.  
&gt;Could someone shed some light on the thing.   Thanks,

This is definitely one for the FAQ.
