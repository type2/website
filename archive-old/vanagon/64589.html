&gt;      And now my campaign promise.
&gt;
&gt;      If elected (to purchase the tent), I will embark on an extensive quest
&gt;      to have the tent duplicated at cost for any and all list members who
&gt;      may be interested and to have the design modified to work with
&gt;      Vanagons, et al.  I will further attempt to ensure that such
&gt;      duplication include the necessary hardware, poles, etc., to make it
&gt;      usable.
&gt;
&gt;      This I do solemly affirm.

&gt;      Candidate for Owner, drive-away tent.
&gt;
&gt;      Any votes?
