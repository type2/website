Subject: camping trip, stormy weather, next camping trip, and lots of VWs

Well, I'm back from another fine weekend on the Oregon coast. Got a bit
more exploring in this time, although I was recovering from some kind of
cold so I didn't so as much hiking as I would have liked.

US 101 is closed off just south of Oswald West State Park - they're
blasting rock up near Neahkahnie Mountain, so if you want to go further
south you'll need to take another route.

Fortunately, we decided to stay in this little campground down near Cannon
Beach. Probably an awfully crowded place in the summer (they have pony
rides or somthing) but we were one of only about 5 other campers (well,
alright RVs) in the place.

The weather was interesting. Probably a good thing everyone bailed out of
the camping trip this month.  Sunday afternoon there were incredible winds
coming in at Ecola Point. I mean, lean into the wind at 45 degrees w/o any
other support kind of winds. Oh, and it was blowing rain at the time too.
Great fun. Fortunately we had rain gear with us, but it was thoroughly
soaked. Then we hiked around down near Indian Beach, a little less wind but
still lots of rain. In the town itself, it was just blowing and raining all
day and night, although not as severely.

But it gets better. Local AM station was all we could pick up, and we
forgot the weather radio. Local station said &quot;high wind warning&quot; rather
non-chalantly. So we were ready for all the blowing. We were even thinking
of going down to lookat the waves. But we weren't ready for the thunder &amp;
lightning at 3 am! We had a thunderstorm move through over a period of
about 30 minutes. We huddled together away from the sides of the van, and
hoped for the best.
Looking at the weather report from Oregon tonight they clocked 70 mph winds
on the coast, and had a severe thunderstorm watch out at 4 am for Portland.
Said there was a whole line of thunderstorms moving along. Also at least an
inch of rain fell Sunday.

Any (knowledgeable) opinions on whether its better to be plugged into the
grid for the grounding capability, or safer to stay unplugged so you don't
pick up spikes from the local AC?

But I must say, we were cozy and warm in our VW Mobile Camping Unit. I
finally finished Theroux's &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; (which I highly recommend
to anyone interested in a different POV on Mediterranean travel and
countries today.)

For those still gathering these statistics, we've now tried sleeping with
our head by the backdoor and with our feet by the back. Although its more
awkward to get into, I prefer having the feet towards the back.

And regarding statistics, there sure were a lot of VWs  on the road Monday.
I started counting in Cannon Beach - think I reached 10. Then there were 2
more in Seaside, but they were parked and for sale. After that we
encountered only a few more until we started getting well into Washington
again - counted 5-6 more in Olympia area - by the time I got home we had
made it up to 27. Of these, 3 were sitting parked with for sale signs on
them. These were any kind of bus or van, camper or not.  And we didn't
count the place south of Allyn that must have had 10 VWs in various stages
(only a couple bus/vans it looked like though.)

regarding the next possible PNW camping trip - some have asked for
something with electric hookup, and I thought of another place that would
also be more reachable for those in Victoria - Ft Worden State Park. It's a
grassy open area with paved parking, but it has electricity. Lots of cool
bunkers and gun placements on the cliff overhead you can bike around, hike
around, etc.
Good tavern in town.  Probably rather inhospitable to anyone without some
kind of MCU (Mobile Camping Unit) at this time of year.

And I'm happy to report that nothing went wrong with the VW at all.
Everything worked well. Freeway speed was usually a comfortable 70 mph at
3600 rpm. Off the freeway, I tended to go a bit slower. W/O breaking down
the different numbers, I'm getting about 18.5 miles/gallon - but this does
include farting around in various state parks, around towns a little bit,
etc. so I'd expect it to be slightly higher for pure road miles.
