	Unfortunetly I can't go, but I just thought I would wish all a 
good safe and pleasurable trip.  I will be through there exactly one week 
later though.
	BTW. I reported that my propane had finally gone empty but it was 
only a plugged burner.  Seven months and still going.  The only reason I 
am bragging about this is to expouse the wonderfull virtues of vws and 
westies.
