Subject: Lurking  in Fla...

To those folks who so nicely responded to my
self-outing... Thanks... a few brews and a nice sunset
and it just came easy....

Shouting from the treetops........ I have  Volkswagons

and

I'm

NOT

Weird....

However, I am clumsy and a bit scatterbrained at times and I sacked
the reply folder with your posts (hence the public facetime) and apologize to
the 312 VW folks who don't want to read this....

or about another neat gathering they aren't going to be able to attend...


Seriously, I would love to discuss the possibility of doin a RRT (Red Rock
Thing) perhaps a bit nearer to us. 
Say...., Florida?, Georgia, N.Carolina?   It's S.P.R.I.N.G. and things are
just getting good-n-green, Parks are reopening, waters not tepid yet, but
just nice enough to let you know you ain't got much clothes on... ; )
What say?
