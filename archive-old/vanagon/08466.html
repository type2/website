Subject: Re: Transporter Badges?

&gt;Anyone on the list know how to go about getting Transporter or 
&gt;Transporter GL badges from Europe (or Mexico)?
&gt;
My Canajun '85 panel has the badge 'Transporter' on the rear hatch. It's 
your for $5,000, and I will include a suitable shipping container, delivery, 
and do your laundry for a year. But seriously folks, if you want me to ask 
at the dealer for this badge I would be happy to, are they rare or summthin? 
 is the cheque in the mail yet?    regards, tim (beam me up) smith
