Howdy,

	Did some work on the interior today!  Bought some material that
is very, very, very close to the stuff the original door panels, etc
were made of.

	I fab'd the cab head pieces, rear hatch piece, and the panels for
the cargo doors.  I also put insultion in all those places.

	Some people poo-pooed my idea of glueing foam to the inside of
the bus for insulation, but my experience shows that its OK.  My last bus
had had it, for Bob knows how long, and this bus had foam glued all
over for over 20 years, and not a speck of rust onder any of it (although
it was _fun_ - NOT _ to scrape the old foam out)
