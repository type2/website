Subject: Re: Found a Binz Crewcab


&gt;What's the deal on Binz Crew Cab's as opposed to others? Was this a
&gt;retrofit in the US? I've heard of these before, but I've never understood
&gt;that there were so many. I always assumed that Binz was a dealership or
&gt;something. Inquiring minds want to know.
&gt;
&gt;Bren

Binz was a coach company that took VW single cabs and made them into 
crewcabs.  They were made before VW produced crewcabs themselves (VW 
started making them in 1959).  Some identifying marks are a suicide 
rear passenger door with wide popout window, a short indentation on 
the side gates (they were cut down and re-welded single cab gates), 
and the forward truck bed seam on the driver side.
