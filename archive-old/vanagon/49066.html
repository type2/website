&gt; - What was the last year the Syncro was made?

In the USA Syncros were imported for model years 1987, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91.

&gt; - Are some models of the Syncro better than others?

With the Westfaila Campers in mind, the GL models had the stove,
12VDC/120VAC/Propane refrigerator, and yes, the kitchen sink!  Camper GL
Syncros were available every year that Syncros were sold.  For 1986 &amp; 87
there was also a base Vanagon Camper Syncro that had the pop-top and a
folding table, but lacked the sink &amp; stove.  If you want all the camping
stuff, the newer, the better.
 
&gt; - I tend to put a lot of miles on my vehicles, about 250k.  If a Westy is
  
&gt;maintained, what   kind of mileage can I expect?

Hard to tell.  The engine lasted 140,000 miles.  Some have gone much further,
some less.

&gt; - Is the 4WD version worth it or will the 2WD go about anywhere (within   
&gt;limits)?

The Syncro will go MANY more places than the 2wd versions.  If you travel in
snow, or on unmaintained dirt roads, the Syncro will be a real asset.

&gt; - When did volkswagon switch to the EuroVan style?

In the USA VW skipped 1992, offering no van and introduced the Eurovan as a
1993 model.

&gt; - I've looked at some of the new models and noticed that the engine is in
  
&gt;front instead of    the rear.  When did they make that switch?

With the change in 1993 to the Eurovan.  Eurovans are also front wheel drive.

Also, the Vanagon Syncro came with an optional rear differential lock.  This
rear diiff lock is a tremendous asset to mobility when things get rough or
slick, like in snow.  Try to get one with the lock.  In later years ('89 and
newer?) the optional locker beacme a standard feature.


Good luck,
