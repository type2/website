Subject: sychroning carbs
Date: Thu, 7 Jul 94 22:13:27 MDT

OK, I've been reading this thread for about a month now.  What I've read
has helped me in a lot of my troubleshooting problems with my '72/'73 bus.
I've also noticed that you all really like to bash mechanics, which they most
definitly deserve.  I however have a simple problem.

The problem is that:
1.)  I hate to give a grease monkey any more money to work on my bus.
2.)  I don't know of any efficient way to sychronize the carbs.

My question lies therein.  Is there any way that I can sychronize the carbs
myself?  I've read the Bentley and it's very explicit about how you should
&quot;take it to an authorized VW mechanic&quot; to have this done.  It then gives this
lenthy definition of how to adjust the carbs.

Problem:
3.)  Bentley says you need a CO tester.

Without going out and buying a couple thousand dollar Sun measurement machine
is there a way to test the CO level?

I know this probably a hopeless case but I'm just hoping that the Bentley
manual is wrong.  Well, just this once.
