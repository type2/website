Subject: Re: 78 (deluxe?) color scheme; dents vs. rust

    I looked at a 78 bus yesterday that had a fairly solid body in an
    unusual color scheme.  The exterior was 2-tone maroon (top) and brown
    (bottom), with fancy stripes on the sides (orange, beige, and maroon).
    Bumpers were chrome, and the window seals had the chrome trim.

There is a bus hereabouts that is somewhere
between maroon and orange on top, brown on
the bottom, and lots of stripes (maybe like
you said) in between.  I'll try to hail him
next time I see him (might be a while).
    
    If you had your choice--dents (not rusty) or rusty (not dented),
    which would you choose?

A dent is a dent but rust is a disease.
