Subject: 'Boxer' engine


The term 'boxer' is used to describe a horizontally-opposed engine having a
single crankshaft and camshaft in which the lobes of the camshaft are common
to the opposing valves.  

The origin of the term is unclear.

Other forms of horizontally opposed engines have a crankshaft for each bank
of cylinders and are built with a common head instead of a common crankcrase.
 

The 'boxer' design enjoys a high ratio of common, shared, and interchangeable
parts, making it one of the least expensive engines to manufacture and
maintain.  The simpicity of the design insures good reliability.  When
designed to use air cooling and when fabricated of light alloy castings, the
combination of reliability, simplicity and light weight make it ideal for use
in aircraft.
