Yes VDO makes a sender that fits in the oil drain plug hole.

VDO 323888 M14 x 1.5 thread (according to my invoice)

This is what I used on my 87 Vanagon. Real easy to install and I haven't had
any problems with leaks or anything. I did have a problem finding a socket
with a thin enough wall to fit in the recessed cavity where the plug sits. I
ended up manufacturing one by using a grinder to reduce the outside diameter
of a regular socket.
