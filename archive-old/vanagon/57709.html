Subject: Vanagon Brush Bars

Some time ago I recall seeing an ad for brush bars for vanagons in Hot
VWs.  I believe that they were called &quot;panzar bars&quot;.  Does anyone know
of that company or any other that manufactures brush bars for vanagons?
Thanks, Lloyd Perkins   dad_at_together_dot_net
