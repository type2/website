Steven asks of all but Dan is wasting a weekend away and replies:
&gt; So Dan Houg says:
&gt; &gt; Here's a tip for finding some of those irrascable air leaks in the
&gt; &gt; intake system, unfortunately, this requires an aircompressor with a
&gt; &gt; regulated output:
&gt; 
&gt; Since the pressure required is small, do you think a small capacity
&gt; compressor e.g. one of those small ones that run off of the 12V car
&gt; battery for flat tires?  Or is this too little air pressure?
&gt;

&gt; 

those 12v air compressor are actually quite high PRESSURE, 
approaching 125-150 psi if let run.  they are LOW VOLUME however and 
provided there are a few small leaks in the intake system or past a 
valve, it should work... just watch that the pressure doesn't start 
building up if you happen to have a very tight intake system.  then 
again you could just use bicycle pump and a frenetic friend willing 
to pump your, uh, oh wait a sec....     nevermind :)
