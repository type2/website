This message reminded me that in Hot VWs this month there is a little
article on the FYI page(44) that says they are going to vote for the
&quot;car of the Century&quot;. It says that we will be able to vote after March
'88 (I think they might mean '98, it appears to be a long drawn out
thing). There is a website at http://www.cotc_dot_com that is supposed to
tell about voting (I havn't even looked at it yet).
