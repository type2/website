 Subject: \\\\VW Bus tent!!!!!

  I have a VW bus tent (came w/a 72 camper I think) Has been in basement
  for years. Selling in garage sale this weekend if there is a taker.(dbout it)
  If it does not sell, I will put it up for bids. I think everything is there.
  Has tent, poles, netting. Looks big. Have not put it together.
  Am having yard sale so no time to deal with it.
  Lemme know.
