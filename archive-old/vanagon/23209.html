Subject: 70 bus steering box

Hello all!  I just signed on to this list, and so far im impressed, it seems
to be a really positive atmosphere here...:-)
but now i've got a problem with my 70 westie.  It has about 12 inches of
play in the steering, and i REALLY get blown all over the roads on windy
days.  since I cant really do anything about the wind, is there a adjustment
i can make to the steering box?  everything else in the front end seems to
be right.
so before i sideswipe someone because of the wind need to fix it.  just dont
want to lay out the 300.00 for the new steering box ifn i dont have to.
also there is a pull out nob next to the steering wheel (on the left) that
doesnt have any knob cover to identify it and it doesnt seem to do anything
when i do the old pull test on it, any ideas on what it is?
this is my first van after a bunch of beetles and i cant really afford to be
buying any manuals for it untill after the 15th of sept payday so if anyone
can give me some advice on the steering or the mystery knob i would be very
gratefull...
thanks in advance.
