Subject: Vgon work: How high?

Deleted a message I wanted to answer -- about how high a Vanagon must be to
get the engine out.  Note that dropping the engine, raising the car, and
pulling the engine out are three separate steps.  You don't have to position
the car once for all three.  You can for instance drop the engine, with help
get the jack(s) out so the engine is on the floor (preferably on a slippery
old chunk of Formica(tm)-covered kitchen counter, take the induction system
off the engine so the engine isn't so tall, THEN jack up the car much less,
and for a shorter time, than is required if you want the engine out from 
under instantaneously.
