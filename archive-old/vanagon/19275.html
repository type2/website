Subject: reimo catalogue


I HAVE the Reimo catalogue.  The curious thing is that I've brought
this catalogue along to EVERY single vanagon campout/meet/bash all 
along, and could never get anyone to show the slightest interest in
it, other than Joel (of course!), to whom I mailed it.  He xeroxed
the whole thing (it's humungous), and then promptly returned it to 
me - what a guy!  :)  Anyway, I got a friend of mine in Germany to
buy it for me over there (about $5 as I recall), and ship it over to
me.  I tried ordering some things from them, but I warn you:  they
don't take ANY credit cards or personaly checks.  You'll have to
risk sending either cash or traveller's checks thru the mail, or
have even better a contact in Germany to arrange it for you.

They offer mondo stuff for all types of vans, not just VW, but
other brands as well, and further, even vans that we've never even
seen in this country.  The array of items is awesome.  You can buy
things already put together, or in components for the do-it-yourselfer.
They have stuff we haven't even THOUGHT of yet.  Amazing.

Anyway, if someone wants the number/address in Germany, let me know,
and I'll dig it out....
