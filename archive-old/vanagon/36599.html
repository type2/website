Subject: Welders &amp; Machinist's Tools (not exactly VW, but....)

There's an auction tomorrow with a bunch of machinist's tools and welders
for sale. I don't know how to weld yet, but I do have a bus with rust
holes and I know how to bid at auctions. Since several of you know about
these things, I wonder if you could comment on the models listed in the
auction ad (if you're familiar with them). Any help would be appreciated.
I'm the opposite of rich, so I have to acquire tools wherever I can get the
best deals.

Thom's recommended mig over other types of welders; does &quot;wire welder&quot;=&quot;mig 
welder?&quot; 

Welders:
Miller Matic 35 Constant Potential DC Welder
Miller AEAH 200 LE AC/DC Welder Generator
P&amp;H DC 200-CV Wire Welder on Dollie
Miller AC/DC Wire Welder Dial Arc-H-F, Serial #HX245936 on Dollie

Cutting Torches:
(2) Airco Cuttin Torches, Asst. Tips, Heads.
12 Volt Airco Automatic Cutting Torch

Other Stuff:
B&amp;D Elec. No. 8 Heavy Duty Nibbler
Adjustable Reamers
Tap &amp; Die sets
Pulley Pullers
Webb Springfield Model 2B Iron Worker Punch Press
2 HP Air Compressor

Same auction has dial indicators and depth gauges. Don't know anything 
about those either, except that I'll need them to do the real (top 
&amp; bottom) rebuild on an engine. Any price range info would be 
appreciated. I'm usually good at spotting quality, but I wouldn't know 
how to be sure of accuracy on precision measuring tools other than by 
measuring a known gap/variance. (I'll bring some shims with me.)

Thanks! Joe
