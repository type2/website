&gt;I am still lookong for a doublecab pickup, water cooled.
&gt;Thought I had one in Ontario but the guy decided he wanted collector 
&gt;price.

*Correct me if I'm wrong, but were there not only 400 imported to this
continent?

&gt; I want something to drive and can't justify top $ just cause 
&gt;something is asthetically appealing compared to conventional 
&gt;alternatives like extra cab pickups...

*IMHO this IS the BEST all round vehicle I have ever owned!!
*Five seat belts and payload=1ton(it would take a ton of bucks to pry her
away from *me too).
