Subject: Re: Transmission ID

Found the code on the bottom of the left side of the trans, thanks Joel!  Now
the question is, do I have the right trans?  The code on this is CK118 3645.
 Haynes says that this CK on a '72 should be CA.  It has CA for up to '73, CN
after '73, CM with 1800cc engines , CP with 2000cc engines, and CC for
limited slip, but no CK.  
What years is this trans?  Inquiring mids want to know!
