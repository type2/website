On resetting the odo while moving:

No Vanagon Content

On early bus trip speedos ('67 and earlier) the trip odo should NEVER be
reset while moving. I have had to perform 4 rebuilds (on 3 speedos) (and
have the new gear made by a watch maker) after resetting while moving.

My wife's Jetta Owners Manual warns that the trip odo should only be
reset while parked.

Aparently the gears meshing back together while the drive gear is
rotating could overstress the underbuilt late speedo. The early speedos
reset a completely different way and can easily be damaged by resetting
while moving.
