Subject: Re: Gas heater boosters

Followup on a point Tim Smith makes about exposure to the elements:  The 70
does not have the bellypan that the Vanagon has covering the gas heater, does
it?  You might want to make one up, otherwise you'll lose (even) more heat
than the Vanagon does, and your gas heater fuel pump and lines will just be
sitting out where road debris can Murphy's Law you.  In your 70, you have a
heating option Vanagons don't have: the booster fans that mount inside and
push prewarmed air through the heating system.  Cheaper to buy, cheaper to
maintain, and less flammable than the gas heater.
