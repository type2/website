&gt;I have an '89 Westfalia camper that seems to be running hot. The temp gauge
&gt;tends to run above the red light on the gauge, even when it is cool outside.
&gt;Whin I am climbing a hill of any size, it nears the first of the two little
&gt;dots at the top of the gauge. I don't notice any power loss, but it just
&gt;seems really hot. Anyone have any experience with this? I just had my coolant
&gt;changed and the mechanic told me he thought it was OK.

my 88 non-camper temp gauge needle sits just above the red LED. all the time
(after it warms up). in hot summer traffic, the fan comes on and makes a
helluva racket, but the needle never seems to move.

my 86 non-camper needle would do the same thing, but at a higher place on
the gauge (about one more needle width toward HOT). now, it's fan was REALLY
loud!!

you gauge might just be a tiny bit out of 'adjustment'. the Bentley book
suggests that your voltage stabilizer might be a little out of whack ...
i'd guess it's ok, as long as the red light doesn't come on or the gauge
gets all the way up to the top.

don't forget you camper adds extra weight so the engine might be running
hotter than my non-camper.
