Subject: Deadhead Veedubers in NEWSWEEK

just a quote from NEWSWEEK, August 21, 1995...

&quot;To anyone who still thought the Dead's core audience was 
gray-ponytailed acid casualties driving VW BUSES with rusted
rocker panels, the sudden surfacing of politicians, scientists
and physicians must of come as a shock...&quot;

I'm sure some of our members resemble that remark.
