&gt;It's still making a hell of a racket, the same noise
&gt;that prompted me to take it apart in the first place!
&gt;I am now speculating that the noise is the pistons
&gt;slapping the sides of the cylinders.  I used the 

Not good.  The first thing I would check is the end play on
the crank.  Give the pulley a good tug back and forth and see
if you can get any motion.  Spec is .004.  That's what was
causing the bad noise on my rebuild.

Somebody needs to offer a good description of piston slap.  I
would think that that would tend to occur under load or 
acceleration, rather than at idle.  Any expertise?

Red Rock Gang:  I made it back at midnight after leaving at 
9 a.m.  Not bad for 600 miles with a leisurely lunch stop to 
watch the Navy bomb the sh** out of a pile of lava near Amboy, 
several miles of backtrack because the shortcut I took ended 
in sand dunes, and an obligatory nap after dinner (aren't 
buses great!).  

Thanks to everyone for a great weekend.
