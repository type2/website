Subject: Call For Votes for rec.autos.vw re-organization


Hi folks -

Sorry to bug you with this not-exactly-VANAGON related posting.

If you remember, a couple of months ago I posted a note about the
re-organization of the rec.autos.vw usenet news group.  For those of
you unfamiliar with it, this is the only news group dedicated to
discussions of VW's.

Unfortunately right now there is a single group for discussions of
ALL VW's, both aircooled and watercooled.  The group has a LOT of
traffic and for a long time people have thought that a group specific
to aircooled VW's should be split off.

Well that is the reason for this posting.  After a 4 month formal
process, the official &quot;call for votes&quot; on this topic has begun.  The
CFV in its entirety is attached here.  Please take a look and cast
your vote.  Instructions for voting are included in the CFV.  Please
read the instructions carefully and vote according to them, the votes
are tallied accordingly.

Tell your friends!  Let all VW enthusiasts on the Net know about the
vote, as it affects most of them.  If you have any questions, please
send me mail.
