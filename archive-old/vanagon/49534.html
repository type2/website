&gt;Sears 10HP lawn tractor, with the deck and everything.  With the jumpseats
&gt;out, put the two ramps, and pushed the tractor up (in transverse position)
&gt;into the middle cargo area.  

If anyone is interested you can put a Sears 5 hp compressor (in the box) in
an '86 right next to the middle seat. It just fits with the door closed. Not
as much fun as a tractor but I'm happy to know it fits.
Congrads on your new machine, it's not a VW but it might be a simple as an
old one was.
