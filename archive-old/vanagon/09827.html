Subject: RE: East Coast Location (argh)

Can someone, Richard perhaps, give me an approximate driving time from 
Chattanooga or Atlanta to Jordan Lake?  I will mention this to our local group, 
Scenic City Transporters, to gauge their interest.  We have about 40 busses and 
do closer trips frequently.  Put me down for a &quot;yes&quot; for the meeting at this 
point.
