Subject: Automatic Accelerator, Speed Control


 I try to find a way to put the automatic accelerator control from the AUDI 
200 into the Vanagon. It's a system sold by Hella in the beginning 80's. 
Unfortunatly the pick up for speed control do not fit with the Vanagon's 
speedometer. And I can not use the AUDI speedometer because of different 
transmission rates.

Right hand drivers: Is it possible to take a second flexible shaft from the 
right front wheel to support a second speedometer?

Another solution: Is the a adapter kit (a simple pick up) on the after 
market which I can mount behind the speedometer?

Please give me some ideas,

Helmut
