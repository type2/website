Subject:      bike racks

Hey!

        I am currently using a hitch mount rack from the Performance
catalog.  It was relatively inexpensive, and works fine.  I got the Extra
model taht will hold 3 bikes.  It has a bottom bar that has legs with small
bungie cords on them to keep the bikes from swaying.  I shortened this
bottom bar slightly so that i can use the rack as a repair stand when I work
as a mechanic for weekend charity rides.  The only downside to this rack is
that you have to take the rack off of the van to open the rear hatch.  But
it only takes ten seconds to pull it out of its socket (which stays mounted
in the reciever).  The reason I went with the Performance model over others
was the availability of a 1.5&quot; reciever model (as well as 2&quot; and ball mount)
and the fact that you can buy extra mounts separately, so you can use it on
several vehicles without getting out the blowtorch and Liquid Wrench.  I
would have bought a fit kit for my old Thule roof rack, but I can't put it
on the fiberglass roof of my EV Weekender without performing major surgery
on the 'glass.

        Just my $.02
