Subject: '86 idles climbs in park
Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 11:38:29 -0500

Hi Volks!

Thanks to all with the help in getting my wife's 'new' '86 on the road.
It's running great with the following exception. This morning after
starting, I noticed that the idle climbs to about 2500-300 rpms in park.
You can &quot;kick it down&quot; by tapping on the gas pedal, but it  quickly begins
to climb again. In drive, it idles fine, about 800 rpm or so. Here's what I
replaced so far to get it running:

02 sensor (non-vw bosch 3 wire)
temp sensor (new)
fuel pressure regulator (used)
ecu (used '86)

Oh, I just remembered that I believe there is either no or a broken
thermostat as it runs VERY cold. I flushed and bled the system over the
weekend and noticed this during the first test drive, and on the way to
work this morning. So maybe that's the problem? Anyway, I'm going to order
the thermo today, but does anyone have any other ideas?

Now all that is left is to replace the cv boots and rear brakes!

The '86 sure drives better than my '83.5! and CERTAINLY better than the
'60, but...

tony
