Greetings All,

I finished rebuilding my engine about two weeks ago and have been having 
trouble getting it to run well or run at all at times.  I have replaced the 
battery and coil but still get a very weak spark at the plugs.  Last night I 
messed around with the distributor a bit, because I know that my timing is 
off a little.  I had a friend turning over the engine from time to time 
while a picked around in the engine.

Basically the engine turns over fine and there is gas in the injectors, you 
can smell it after a few trys.  But it seems as though it will not get any 
spark, and if it does and begins to run, it stalls after about 5-6 seconds. 
 So I was working on it last night and in the middle of a start up attempt 
the hose from the deceleration valve to the T-connection into the intake air 
distributor (above the cold start valve) blew off the T-junction with a 
*LOUD* pop and a small amount of smoke began to waft out of the 
T-connection.  I decided to stop at this point and defer my better judgment 
to the list.  Anybody know what is going on here?  I think that maybe the 
vacuum advance setup for the distributor is messed up and that is causing 
the poor firing and pressure build up.?.

Any input would be appreciated, I have missed three weekends in a row in the 
Westy and I am beginning to get perturbed!

Thanks,
Bill Ernest
