1991 was the last year Vanagons were made. There were no '92s and the =
Eurovan appeared in 1993. In my opinion, there's not a huge amount of =
distinction from the '87 through '91 model years. Same 2.1 liter engine, =
same drivetrain, same body style. Differences are mainly cosmetic, and =
of course an '87 is four years older than a '91. There are more options =
available on the later models, if that is important to you. Syncros are =
wonderful, but harder to find, more expensive to purchase ($2000 to =
$4000 more), and more expensive to fix if there are transmission =
problems. I have an '87 syncro Westfalia, and I wouldn't trade it for =
anything.

&gt;Are there any owners out there who could take the time to communicate
&gt;with us about various aspects of their campers
&gt;
&gt;Model years we are likely to be looking at are 89, 90 and 91. I don't
&gt;think we can manage a '92 on our budget.

I have an 85 Westy that I think is the best thing since sliced bread.  =
If I
was going to purchase another one, I would HIGHLY recommend the 91.  Of =
all
the years the water cooled Vanagon was made (83-92), the 91 and 92 seem =
to
have the most 'options' of all the models.  I would also highly =
recommend a
Syncro (all wheel drive).
