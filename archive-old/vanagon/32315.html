Have you had a coolant leak problem?

I recently did. It turned out that there was hairline crack in the coolant 
pipes from the engine compartment to the rear heat exchanger.

After much grief caused by backordered and damaged parts my vehicle was 
repaired.

Rob Barwise recently indicated that he has a coolant leak. A phone 
conversation with Rob indicates that his problem is from the same part on 
his vehicle.

I'm wondering if anyone has had a problem with their vehicle. Rob is at 
present contacting VWoA to discuss the possibility that there is a 
manufacturing defect with this particular part.

As this is a rather expensive part (~$165) and lengthy repair (8 hours) I 
think it behooves the EV owners to stick together.

Please keep in mind, I LOVE my EV. I think it is a great vehicle and dearly 
hope that VWoA offers another van in the very near future.

Please respond to me directly, I'll keep everybody updated on Rob and my 
progress and research, and follow-up to the list.
