Well, I guess I'll weigh in...  Ooops!  Sorry about your scale!

Anyway, the only thing I ever bought was the split-case to tunnel-case
trans adapter, which was delivered promptly (I had it overnighted 
because I was in a serious rush) but I thought the part itself was
a bit pricey, but again I was in a jam so I had no choice.

On that note, are BB planning to come out with a version of that
adapter with some rubber in it?  THat would really be the way to go...
