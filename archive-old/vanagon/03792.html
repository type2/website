Subject: anyone need a set of nearly-new waterboxer heads?

I just ordered a rebuilt engine for my '86 which includes new heads.  The old
engine has a brand new set of heads with &lt; 6 months and &lt; 4k miles on them.

VW is charging me $600 for the core, so if anyone is interested they can
have the heads for the core charge + any shipping.

I decided to go ahead and order it from VW for the 1 year 12k mile warranty,
plus they claim everything inside is new except for the crank if it was in good
shape.  

BTW - The local dealer here in Raleigh matched the price Joel was
quoted in Atlanta of $2380.
