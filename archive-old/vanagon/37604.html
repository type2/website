Subject: Re: finding bad syncro wheel bearing


&gt;       Would it put too much stress on the center differential
&gt;to just jack up one wheel at a time and put it in gear- the diffs
&gt;should allow the other three wheels to stay still... and with
&gt;only one turning at a time, the id of the bad one would be 100%.
&gt;

DO NOT DO THIS!!!!
THE VISCOUS COUPLING WILL TRANSMIT TORQUE THE FRONT WHEELS AND THE VAN WILL
BECOME MOBILE!  THIS WOULD BE DANGEROUS!
DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!

And then the Fedrl Gummint will decree that all automobiles (not just
Syncros, or VWs) must have 4-wheel sensors that all indicate that
the wheels are firmly on the ground, before you're allowed to put it
into gear. The cost of this &quot;solution&quot;? why, just sign here, sir...  :^)
