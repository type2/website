&gt;        Just to add one more thing to worry about, I experienced clutch
&gt;juddering and neglected any solution to the problem. A number of months
&gt;passed by, I don't recall exactly how long, and my pilot bearing fell to
&gt;pieces and locked the main shaft from the tranny into the engine's
&gt;crankshaft. This prevents gear shifts and therefore vehicle motion. I don't
&gt;know if this was a cause and effect cascade of events but it was a
&gt;suspicious coincidence. Perhaps the juddering caused the main shaft to beat
&gt;up the bearing. My two cents worth.

Here you go,

I had exactly the same problem a few months ago. The stick was locked after
one stop at a traffic light. Couldn't move it anymore. I had to stop the
engine, engage the first gear, fire it up again and change the gears with
double clutching especially during downshifting. After a while it was
working normally!!! I don't know why. I haven't fix it yet, but I know the
sooner the better. For now, the pilot bearing seems to be in it's right
&quot;place&quot; but I know it won't get any better as miles go.
