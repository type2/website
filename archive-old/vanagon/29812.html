I think you know about this already, but this is the formal announcement. 
 It broke my heart to buy fellow list member Ian Webb's much loved 89 Westy 
&quot;Dewey&quot;about two weeks ago.  This beautifully clean North Carolina Westy is 
now stashed away from the elements in my garage in New Jersey.  Many many 
thanks to the list (and Ian) for helping me locate this Westy after my year 
long search.  It was worth the wait.  I look forward to sharing my successes 
and hardships (no head leaks yet) with the list.  Ian is desperately looking 
for a good clean aircooled Westy in the Mid Atlantic area if everyone can 
keep an eye out.

Regards,
Peter
