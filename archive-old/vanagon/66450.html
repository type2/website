Subject:      Replacement Poptop seals

Just FYI, I replaced the luggage rack with different seals, the aluminum
kind. The replacement seals did not have the height of the OEM seals, and
as a result left a small air-gap between the bottom of the luggage rack and
the roof of the Van. As I drove through a windy area today i heard the
luggage rack vibrating due to wind going under the seal.

Something to keep in mind if you are replacing the seals and live in a
windy area.
