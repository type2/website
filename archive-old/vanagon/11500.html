Subject: Re: crank bearing removal

&gt;I need to remove the #3 main bearing from the Bus crankshaft.  However,
&gt;I am without a press of any sort. 

No tools?  Then do this.  Go to your friendly, non-dealer, VW repair shop. 
They must be friendly, otherwise they might charge you $5-10, instead of
nothing.

This is what I do.
