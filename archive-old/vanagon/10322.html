&gt;&gt; OK so if the fluid isn't leaking out the front master and the car hasn't
&gt;&gt; moved since the last top-up, the only other way it could leak out is through
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; force of gravity. So my next job is to find the &quot;lowest point&quot; in the van
&gt;&gt; and that's where the fluid will be. Not.

&gt;If the clutch slave cylinder springs a leak internal to the clutch assembly
&gt;you would find no external evidence.  I would assume that the clutch would
&gt;eventually become glazed and start slipping.  The slave cylinder is lower 
&gt;than the brake fluid reservoir.  Have you ruled out the brake system based
&gt;on the fact that the brake fluid will not drain past the point where the
&gt;clutch system tapps into the reservoir?
&gt;
Hate to spoil your party, BUT the clutch slave is NOT internal to the
clutch, in fact it's on the other side of the bellhousing (the OUTside).  It
would have to seep through the bellhousing to get to the friction material
of the clutch.
