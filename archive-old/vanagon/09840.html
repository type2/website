&gt;I've just about replaced all the items you mentioned. When you say to check
&gt;rubber boot, is that the circular rubber gasket where the throttle body meets
&gt;the air distribution box?  I agree with you  that since the idle does not
&gt;increase i think the problem must be after the air flow meter.  Could there be
&gt;a leak at the seam where the two halves of the air distribution box come
&gt;together?

yeah, that big S-shaped, ribbed rubber tube-looking-thing. there is a known
problem on some years/models Vanagons and there is a special clamp to fix a
leak where that rubber tube is clamped to the air-flow-meter.

&gt;I'm really reaching here!!!  I had a VW mechanic tell me that it was common to
&gt;find vacuum leaks at the junction where the intake manifolds bolt to the heads
&gt;Mine appear ok and tight.  Looks like I may have to spend some time looking at
&gt;all the grounds and electrical contacts, and possibly remove the entire air
&gt;intake system and check for leaks...  all for now.

i've never heard of it being 'common' to find vacuum leaks at the heads, but
it's certainly possible if the intake manifold has been disconnected.

my guess would be either the electrical ground or the rubber boot. trying
getting some spray can of ether and spraying it around and see if the idle
goes up ... that will give you a more local area of the leak (if it is a
leak). good luck.
