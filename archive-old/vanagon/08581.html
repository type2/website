Subject: clutch missing
Date: Thu, 22 Dec 94 11:17:09 EST

This morning, i was outside working on my wife's Renault5 windshield
(popped out) and thought that the vanagon needed to be started up just to
keep the battery up and to keep it lubed (it is in storage for the
winter). As per usual I put the clutch in even when the van is parked in
neutral. The clutch pedal went straight to the floor! No clutch!. The
fluid is just at the minimum line (doh!). But there is a braided line
coming off just above the min line. Normally having fluid at the min line
would be &quot;ok&quot;, but I am wondering if the braided line runs to the clutch
cylinder and if this is a lack of fluid problem. Or does cold weather
effect a clutch (ie something is &quot;stuck&quot; along the way). Any ideas,
solutions, similar experiences? TIA - DC
