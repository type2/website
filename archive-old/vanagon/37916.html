Subject: Car Top Tent Report (slim VW content)

Vanatics,
Last week I recieved the Car Top Tent that I ordered and got to try it out
Saturday.  I think this thing is going to be just great for people (like me)
with a non-Westy Vanagon who want to sleep 4 people.  The kids (2) and I
slept in the tent on top of the Vanagon Saturday night and I'm quite
impressed.  The size was quite generous, (being the width of a queen bed and
just a bit longer) and the foam pad inside was nice &amp; cushy.  The 2-piece
folding platform was very sturdy, being made of a lamination of 2 surface
sheets of aluminum and a rigid interior of styrofoam.  Just like the brochure
says, it sets up in seconds.

I'll have it with me (if you'd like a first hand look) at the April 27
Redrock camping trip in California.  

If you'd like more information, you can call Car Top Tents at (800) CarTop1.

I don't have any financial interest in Car Top Tents.  I'm just a customer.
