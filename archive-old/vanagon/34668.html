Subject: Re: brake fl leak

&gt;&gt; While on this subject, I thought I'd mention for all you
&gt;&gt; 68-72 bus people out there:  The plastic resevoir that sits
&gt;&gt; on the master cylinder is no longer available from the
&gt;&gt; dealer (but the master cylinder is, go figure) and no
&gt;&gt; aftermarket parts source that I'm aware of makes one.  The

&gt;Ron and other bay window folk:
&gt;
&gt;RMMW (Bus Stop) 1995 catalog lists a brake fluid reservoir
&gt;for '68-'72 buses at $28.75 (item # 87313).  I just &quot;happened&quot;
&gt;across it looking for '67 parts.

Jim,

It's in the catalog, but it's not available.  The last time I called them
regarding this (~3 months ago) the best they could do was suggest finding a
used part in a junkyard.  BTW, according to my local VW dealer (who tried to
order one for me) the part number listed on the latest fiche is the same for
both the 68-72 resevoir and the later model, despite the fact that the later
resevoir does not fit the earlier master cyl.  So my guess is they are
probably phasing out the earlier master cylinder sooner or later so that
everyone will have to get a new style resevoir and later master cyl.  

I'd be interested if anyone could find a source for these, if not just for
curiousity-sake!
