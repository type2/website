&gt; I think it was about 3/8 in. clear cheapo tubing, but I ended up whittling 
&gt; it down a bit so I could screw it into the bleed hole. Try 5/16 maybee. Has 
&gt; anyone simply stuck a bleed valve back instead of the bolt, since this 
&gt; bleeding problem is repetitious? They usually will take a small bore hose 
&gt; directly. Life could be easier then(or if I owned an air-cooled)
&gt; 
&gt; NO, don't dump the coolant, DON'T!! At least get it to your favorite 
&gt; landfill site via the garbage collectors.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Plastic T's.... long discussion re those in rec.autos.tech, OK to use them 
&gt; for flushing, BUT don't leave them in place, they crumble/break up and dump 
&gt; all your coolant.

Thanks Tim. When I posted the question this morning, I had forgotten
that there isn't a typical radiator cap on these beasts. After
checking Bentley, I saw that it is just a bleed screw. So I picked a
couple feet of various diameter plastic tubes and will use the closest
one.

I was leaning away from the tee but Gerald's response makes it sound
like it very easy and thorough to use. However, as per your
recommendation, I won't leave it in permanently.

After I've completed the job, I'll post a summary.
