Subject:      re: weltmeister



On Fri, 21 Jul 95 16:44:49 CDT Matt Bushore mistakenly asked:
&gt;&quot;whats a weltmeister?&quot; Once I know, my life will be complete.

welt: noun. a ridge or lump raised on the body usu. by a blow.
      verb. to raise a welt on the body of; to hit hard.

and meister means &quot;master&quot;.

so it's obviously some sort of sexual deviant Sado-Masochistic bunch of
weirdos that you've gotten yourself involved with here.

&gt;Its on a sticker I have &quot;Die Marke der weltmeister&quot; or something like that.

and this sticker is proclaiming that you have &quot;The Mark of the Whip Master&quot;
or perhaps not a whip, but a cane, or car antenna, or some other such tool
of punishment-pleasure.  i think i would find another crowd to hang around
if i were you.

&gt;also, this 0lga spam is amazing. Gotten it on _every_ mail

aha! now the truth comes out: Olga sent you the sticker!!! so Olga and her
Commie pals are into the Domination and Sado-Spam forms of deviation!!!!
oh lord, how low and depraved have you become: whipping each other with
slices of spam!!???? gad, how sickening. the thought is simply revolting.
(which, of course, the communists did (revolt) in 1917 ... you remember?
Spam October?? it was in all the papers at the time ...)

&gt;list I receive.  Spamming technology has sure come a long way...

oh, great ... we got rid of the Arms Race, and the Space Race, and the
Peace Race, ... and what happens?? Olga and the Spamrades start heating up
the Spam Race!!! where, oh where, will this spiraling insanity end!!!???
is there NO hope for humanity????
