Sorry, Tim, et al,

The Crucero Express was a car-carrying ferry from Panama City, Panama and
Cartegena, Colombia.  It provided a route around the Darien Gap.  No
tracks.....

&gt; &gt;accommodations for the passengers. Crucero Express, between Panama City,
&gt; &gt;Panama and Cartegena, Colombia, has ceased operation, so that raises
&gt; 
&gt; well...  if this express is a train, and the tracks are still there.....
what's
&gt; the problem?  Just need the local freight-train schedule, like they run
on time
&gt; don't they =:O Could be a highlight of the trip, a little train of
vanagons
&gt; pooting along the tacks in the middle of the jungle! Wow!   Tim
