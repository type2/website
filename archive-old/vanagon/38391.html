Subject: 2nd Gen Bus Questions(68-78)

Everyone,

I'm quite new to this list, but I have been a fan of VW vechiles for quite a
number of years. I was wondering if someone could awnser a few questions for
me? These Pertain to the 1968-1978 Era of Buses (Not the Wedge nor the
Splities, But it'd be intersting to know if there are any differences
between the different eras)

1. Is it true that the Gas Tank is right in front of the Engine? Would this
be a major danger in purchasing a bus of this or any era?

2. How bad are These Buses at rusting? I had a 77 Nova that was made of
Compressed Rust, but these are supposed to be of &quot;High Quality German
Workmanship&quot; Is this correct in this case?

3. How much is expected to pay for one of these buses? I mean of the avg.
price vs Condition. BTW I live in SW Florida if that helps.

4. My friends say that I am crazy to get a bus, since the Crysler Minivans,
are of much higher quality, it may be true in the sense of the Water VS air
cooled engines, am I right to assume that the Type 2 Engines are much easier
to repair myself?

In closing, I really like these buses much better than any other vechile
with the possilble execption of the Type 1. I appricate this forum in witch
I can talk/listen to volks with something in common with myself. I thank all
for making reading my e-mail fun!

Regards,
Alan Ricotta
