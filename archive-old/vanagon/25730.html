&gt; We bought a propane barbeque grill earlier this summer, and absolutely 
&gt; love it--definitely taking our grill with us to Inuvik!  One winter 
&gt; project is going to be setting up the proper connections so I can run the 
&gt; grill off our big propane tank, instead of the pissy little one pound 
&gt; disposable tanks the grill is designed for.  

Those pissy little tanks are awfully convenient.  :)  I have a neato
device my father made (one of the few things I have of his) that allows
me to refill the little bottles from a large BBQ-style cylinder.  This
is extremely economical, as I can fill *lots* of those little bottles from
$3 worth of propane.  I wouldn't want to have to fit one of the large
sized bottles inside my camper, anyway.  Of course, refilling those
disposable cylinders will void your warranty, cause birth defects, and
possibly get you killed if you don't use the proper precautions.
