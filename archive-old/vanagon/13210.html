Everyone seems to be complaining about idots on the road.......

Thing to do is just fill yourself with a superiority complex because you
know that you are injoying driving a VW more than those idots will ever
know.  Although, the Zen aproach to dealing with this problem seems 
intreging!!!  One vengence aproach I use when driving my jap truck
is to blind the mothers.  I run 130 watt halogens in the front and a
55 watt &quot;back up&quot; light.....they get REAL mad when they can't see :)
