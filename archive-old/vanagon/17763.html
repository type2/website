	Vahid asks how the electronic fuel injection is synchronized
with the sparks. Oddly enough, mechanically. The spark plug is in
the cylinder, and the fuel injection is spraying fuel into the space
above the intake valve. (This is true for DJet and LJet and digifant-
Were there ever KJet bus motors? Doesn't matter. They're all indirect)
The fuel is only admitted into the cylinder when the intake valve is
opened, and the spark plug only fires once per cycle of the valves.
	Basicly, there are two types of VW fuel injection: Pulsed (common
on Type IV) and continious, but in both cases, the injector is spraying
the fuel into the space above the intake valve, not directly into
the cylinder. The pulsed system with hall switch sounds like it fires each
injector 4 times for every time the spark plugs fire. The old
D-Jet on my 914 (type IV 1.7) had two mechanical switches that
operated at crank-shaft speed and pulsed the system twice per spark.

	The K-Jet CIS system, continious, is my favorite of the lot,
because its so simple. It just sprays fuel all the time, no pulses, 
with the volume sprayed determined by the airflow into the engine. This
was on my Rabbit and 85 Golf, but I've never seen this system on
a Bus.
