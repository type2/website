Subject: Thanks :)

Thanks for all of the help that everyone gave about my idle problem and the
coolant sensor question. I still haven't figured out the idle problem,
although it has gotten better with the replacement of the O2 sensor and the
coolant temp sensor. I tried to check for vacuum leaks but I couldn't find
any. I am going to take it to a volkswagen garage to see if they can find
the problem. Thanks again for all of the help.
