Subject: 2.1 liter Vanagon Horsepower?

Vanagoneers,

Here's another one to ponder and its had me curious for some time.

What is the actual horsepower for an 86 Vanagon?  An 87?  An 88? ....

The 87 brochure says 95 horsepower at 4800 RPM (SAE net)
The 87 Owner's Manual says 90 horsepower at 5500 RPM (SAE net)

The 88 brochure says 90 horsepower at 4800 RPM (SAE net)
The 88 Owner's Manual says 90 horsepower at 4800 RPM (SAE net)

My references are consistant about the maximum torque of 117.3 ft lbs at 3200
RPM.

Did the power output actually change?  Was VW confused when it published
these figures?  What gives?

Jim Davis
87 Syncro
88 Wolfsburg
