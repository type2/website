Subject: Re: Introduction 

Steve, In re: to your questions, I do believe that you can best be suited
with the EV &quot;Weekender&quot;, I saw one at the Clevland Auto Show a couple
years ago,  It appeared to be a Eurovan version of my '85 Westy Wolfsburg
(ie no sink/stove and a removable ac/dc refrigerator)  I guess what you
are contemplating would be a '92 EV Westy.

Larry
'85 Westy
