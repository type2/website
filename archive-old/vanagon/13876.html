&gt;Would you guys out there who have the catalyic heaters
&gt;drive with them on?
&gt;
&gt;Is Dave Garth the only one who has a vented/ducted in/out
&gt;such catalyic heater?  Dave, does this mean you don't
&gt;get a moisture problem?
&gt;
&gt;/martha

I'm in the process of installing the same heater - a Thermal Systems
externally vented catalytic - in my '87.

To be able to drive with the heater on, you'd have to install it in a
fashion to be certain that wind as a result of the bus's movement didn't
blow back up the heater exhaust vent. Otherwise, the combustion fumes could
not vent properly, and the heater's safety system would probably shut it
down.

There is a certain increased risk - I'm sure - in having an open propane
line while the bus is moving, in the event of an accident. I wonder if
there are fancier shutoff valves available that would sense a broken line
(perhaps by shutting off if the flow volume exceeds a certain level) and
mitigate this risk to some extent?

It would make for nice heat though. No fans blowing on you. No burning feet
and frozen ears. And on real cold mornings, you could always fire up the
catalytic a half hour before you leave, allowing you to start your journey
in a toasty warm bus.

Hey, now that I think about it, if the catalytic really is feasible for
driving heat, we can all drop Porsche sixes in our Vanagons and still stay
toasty!!
