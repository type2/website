Subject: Re: Mystery Webber on my 1700cc '73

In your message of  9 Dec 1994 at 0851 MST, you write:
&gt;  Hey all .. I bought a 2bbl Webber for my 73/1700cc a while back from JC
&gt;
&gt; Whitney ... the problem is, I don't really know what model Webber it is,
&gt; and I've lost the install/tuning sheet.
&gt;  Can anyone suggest what I might have? The Whitney # was 14-6425-X+ and it
&gt; cost about $268. I tried calling them. That was a mistake.
&gt;  Also, ,when I initially installed it (before my rebuilt, when I only had
&gt; 2 cylinders of compression), the linkage was on the driver's side (this
&gt; seemed logical, as the cable was closer to that side), but closer review
&gt; of the paperwork I do have tells me to install it with the linkage on the
&gt; passenger's side. How do you guys have your's installed?
&gt;  Last question - does nayone have a phone # for Webber? 800-info doesn't have any
&gt; thing, and I don't know where they are ...
&gt;  Thanks a lot.

Hi!  I am looking for a 2000cc engine for my '79 VW bus, I have been
asking around, the best price I found for a rebuilt engine is with
GTX at $1100.00, does anyone have any suggestions as to where to find
one at a better price?  How difficult would it be to replace an
engine?  Any suggestions?  Thanks!    Dave
