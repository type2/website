Subject: Checking out new Winnebago EV's

I went to the VW dealership in Central Fl. to look at the new Winnebago
EV's.  They looked real nice, although I like the lower pop-top on the
Westfalia EV.  Well by the time I got finished looking at the vans, the 
salesmen said that he would give me $13-$14K for my 89' Westfalia, and
already had contacted a potential buyer for it.  I have 60K miles and 
my van is super clean.  The new Winnebago was $30K.  Does anyone know
how good a deal this is?
