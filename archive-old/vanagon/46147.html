Subject: Sticky lifters don't help... (again)

Ellis previously said:
I made a deal with her (my wife) that I wouldn't buy a Synchro if she didnt
go off on me about selling the '81. Honestly I'm trying to sell this one. 

Come to think about it, I shoulda said that I WOULD buy a Syncro if she did
go off on me. ;-)
