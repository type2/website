&gt;I already said that the current was going to change.  Unless the fuel 
&gt;gauge is a voltmeter or an ammeter, it's measuring the change of 
&gt;resistance of the sender. 
 
Sorry, it is either measuring the voltage drop across the resistance of the
sender (an unlikely and unusual arrangement for this application) or most
likely the current through the resistance of the sender which changes with the
gasoline level in the tank.


That resistance isn't going to change, 
&gt;regardless of voltage.

The total resistance, you are correct, won't change, that is physically fixed
by the total length of resistance wire   (which has a constant resistance
measured typically in ohms per unit length, and is a function of the material
and the cross section area of the wire ) fabricated into this unit.   HOWEVER,
sender gauges are like the volume control on a radio, and have a movable
contact that slides along the length of the resistance wire and therefore
&quot;adjusts&quot; the length of resistance wire in the circuit, effectively making the
resistance a function of the fluid level in the tank.  
 
&gt;Maybe someone on the list knows the electrical specs of the sender and 
&gt;gauge.  But my guess is it measure the resistance of the sender, 0 ohms 
&gt;at full, and approaching infinity at empty.

Correct to a point, most senders do not go to infinity ohms at empty. 
Typically the total resistance may be around 70 to 100 ohms.  That means the
current swing can be from 0 to 12.6 volts/70 ohms = 0.180 amps.  That tells me
that a typical gas gauge meter is an amp meter with a 0-200 ma range. 
Typical, reasonable, and common.
