&gt;I don't think these are a good idea.  In fact, I doubt they'll even work.
&gt; Find yourself halfway to La Paz and your synthentic coil goes out and
&gt;whatcha going to do?

Been using the stuff since 84. Started in Porsch 924 that had all sorts of
oil related problems.  Problems dissapeared. I can explain if interested.
 Bought wife an 81 Rabbit convertible with 123K. Changed to Mobil1 15-50.
Change every 10K if I remember.  2 times went to 20K.  Engine turned 235K
last saturday.  Look in top of head when openng oil filler, still like new in
there.  Burns quart every 3k or so.  Stil runs great except for slight miss.
 leakdown test shows exhaust valve #4 leaking slightly.  I believe.  I do
also agree that many non sysnthetics are also extremely good.  Oils have come
a long way in the past ten years or so.
Dennis.
