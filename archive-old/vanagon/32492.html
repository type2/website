Subject: re:   'The Rincon Rocket

My wife dubbed the 1972 breadloaf 'The Rincon Rocket' and expects
me to have it running in a few days.  I just smiled.  It will
probably take that long just to get the pack rats out of the air
ducts.

Anybody know how to unlock a locked steering column without using
a key?  Semi-serious responses only, please :-)

yes- i've met rodent nests in the heat ducts, and an old wasp mest in a gas
heater(the heater worked better after the nest fell out)

there is, i believe, a hidden pin you have to drill out to remove the lock
cylnider.
