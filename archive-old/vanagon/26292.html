Subject: Finally pulled the engine

Finally, after about a month of other things tugging at me in different 
directions (and a little play time on a &quot;spare 1600&quot;) I pulled the engine 
from the bus this weekend. Despite the low compression test on #4 (she 
read 75#), I'm pretty happy with what I can see. The pistons all look to 
be in good shape. No pitting or knicks; just a bit of buildup on #4 and 
#1. The heads appear to have no cracks, though apparently, they are the 
&quot;fuely&quot; (sp?) heads my local parts guy talks badly about. He claims 
they're more prone to cracks. (The heads off my &quot;spare 1600&quot; are of the 
&quot;fuely&quot; ilk also, though one has a crack. I'm thinking &quot;Alright! Now I've 
got a spare head!&quot;8)

I've still haven't pulled the pistons and jugs. In my haste to check for
damage on the heads and pistons, I failed to clean the engine first (Bob
would NOT be happy with me). I'm thinking that I'll be time and sanity
ahead to put the heads and push rod tubes back on and clean up the outside 
some before proceeding. 

Anyway, I just thought I'd &quot;check in&quot; and let you all know how it's 
going. I'm shooting for the end of the month to have the rebuild 
complete, but with my schedule, I could possibly even miss that deadline. 
Oh well, I'm in Arkansas. It doesn't usually get &quot;cold&quot; (less than 32 
deg. F) until November. (BTW, I'm on digest mode if you Canadians want to 
flame me for my use of the word &quot;cold.&quot;) 8) Joe
