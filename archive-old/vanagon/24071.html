Subject: too many vans for sale

Today I saw 2 late model Westies for sale. Just when I'm thinking that
maybe I *should* go to a water-cooled as well.

Descriptions:
1991 Westfalia, maroon, power everything (locks, windows, steering,
brakes), automatic,
103K miles, but the cleanest vehicle I've ever seen with that many miles on it.
It was a tradein at a dealer, and he's asking $18,900 for it. Yikes.
I took it for a drive though, its very tight feeling and a lot more powerful
than my engine! The previous owners were local, and he promised me he would get
hold of them and ask them about the history (as he was rather clueless - he
went to show me the engine and couldn't find the latch for the hood - in
the front!) I'm mistrustful of power-everything and auto transmission but
this sure was a clean van!

1990 Westfalia, maroon, stick, manual windows. 87K miles, private owner,
asking $18,000 for it. A little dirtier than the first one but looks okay.

Comments on model years &amp; prices welcome.

I'm really in a quandary as to whether I should put this amt of cash into a
vehicle or just make do with my air-cooled
for a few more years. I'm disappointed in its performance in the
*moderately* hot weather we have in the desert regions here. (I must admit
the Westie interior is much more aesthetically pleasing too!)

BTW: the other guy on the lot DID know a lot about VWs. He claimed that VW
has pulled the EV from production, and is not going to introduce anything
else
until they get the VR6 in, around late '96. For what its worth.
