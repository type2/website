Subject: Fun driving

This past weekend was the Gettsburg caravan put on by the Mid atlantic 
micros.  i met Tom Forhan (from the list) at ellicott city MD and shoved 
off to taneytown.  The rain stopped and the sun came out to make a 
pleasant but cool day.  At taney town we met up with Paul and Dave (also 
from the list) and others from mid atlantic micros.  Had lunch, talked 
about vanagons and busses, and contemplated crossing the stream over the 
flooded bridge in tom's syncro.  After eating we loaded up and cravaned 
to the battlefields at gettysburg. We turned quite a few heads on the 
way.  The busses that showed up were: 87 westy, 90 westy syncro, 65 
standard, 79 bus, and 71 westy.  i think other people were scared off by 
the rain.  A good time was had by all who showed up.
