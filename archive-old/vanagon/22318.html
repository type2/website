Hi all wasserboxer westy owners,

I'm curious about the door on your closet cabinet. Do all westies have
the narrow door that faces forward? My camper conversion that is pretty
much a westy in the floor plan, has a large closet door that swings out
from the side. I like this because I typically store luggage in the
closet instead of shirts on hangers and the large opening makes it easy
to store large items. Are you westy owners appropriately jealous yet?

I am jealous of the pop top on the westy. You folks have much more room
than my top that goes straight up (the vertical height is the same from
front to back). One nice thing about it though is that it has a pop top
made out of reinforced plastic/vinyl instead of canvas. Do the canvas 
pop tops wear thin with age?

I'm asking these questions because I figure someday I will buy a newer
model and want to know the westy weaknesess up front. I think I would
buy the model that has a pop top and rear cabinetry but no stove and 
fridge. I haul lots of people around more than I camp. When I do go
on the camping adventures I would then slide out the middle seat.

Thanks for any input,

Steve
