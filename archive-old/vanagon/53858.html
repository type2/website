&gt;For sale five 15 x 7 inch alloys with correct bolt pattern and offset for
&gt;Vanagon.  Lug nuts, wheel locks included.

Mid-late 80's Audi 5000 Turbo wheels fit, 15x6, 6 spoked alloys, 112mm x 5
bolt pattern. The rims are thicker in stud hole section, you may need longer
bolts (take'm off the Audi too?)  Lug nuts for alloys are usually $6-7 each
new, so try for the full package at the junkyard. One near me wants $200Cdn
for a set of 4.  Wide range of tires avail. in 15&quot; size!!!  Tim

'86 Audi 5000CD Turbo (signed its donor card ;&gt; )
