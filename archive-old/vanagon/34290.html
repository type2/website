Subject: Tom F. mail working (?)

     Hey, I got mail with vanagon content from Tim Smith, Patrick Eagan
     and Jim Davis in the last couple of days. I am also getting 150
     messages a day from the Quattro list, no problem. Maybe they have
     fixed our e-mail system. Count on them not telling us if they did...

     Its worth a try again, if you've been trying to get through.
