Subject: '78 bus fuel gauge acting wierd

	Hello all, my problem is that my fuel gauge is possesed, but only 
when it hits 1/4 of a tank.  I bought this bus in November and have not 
had any problems with it until now.  When my fuel gauge gets down to 1/4 
of a tank it starts changing positions dramatically dropping to the 
bottem of the reserve and then going back up to 1/4 and even sometimes to 
1/2.  It never did this before and registers fine when stopped, but when 
driving at constant speeds and not climbing and hill or bumps it just 
freaks out and doesn't stop until I do.  This started last week and I 
checked the connectiond for the wires in the back of the gauge, and they 
are all snug.  It tends to make your heart skip a beat when you start 
with 1/4 of a tank and then 10 minutes later you got nothing on the 
gauge, and you don't smell fuel.
	So is this fixable, bus personality, or should I call a priest?

		Thanks,  -Brian   &quot;I am in no way a mechanic,
				  But I am a masochist, thats
				     why I own a bus.&quot; :)
