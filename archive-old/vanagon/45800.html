&gt;BTW, why in the world can't people in Oregon pump their own gas?

Hi Weston - 
It's against State Law.  Apparently they don't think their own citizens are
smart enough to know how to pump their own gas, i.e.: sticking the nozzle in
the correct orifice :-).  I'll never forget the first time I had to get gas
in Oregon - got outa the 67 Deluxe to unlock the gas cap and some teenager
comes runnin' outa the office yelling &quot;don't pump the gas, it's against state
law!&quot;.  Funny as hell, as he sliiped and fell on the concrete and I'm there
wonderin' what's all this sh** about?  Felt like I was about commit a felony
the way he was acting.
