Subject: Re: Rear Bench Seat


Douglas, that is the way it is suposed to be.  the rear seat is two 
pieces.  the bottom bolts to the floor with clamps.  the back has two 
small hinges on the top that screw/bolt to the sides of the bus.  it then 
rests up against the bottom of the bench and the front of the engine 
compartment.
hope this helped.

&gt; Since we are on the subject of bench seats my '65 bus's
&gt; rear bench seat is in 2 pieces. The back cushion is detached
&gt; from the seating cushion. Seems to me they should be attached!
&gt; (My middle seat is in one piece)
&gt; 
&gt; Should the rear seat be one piece and, if so, how can I
&gt; attach these two separate cushions?
