Subject: '76 Campmobile EGR light

About a year ago the EGR light in my '76 Campmobile (Buster)  came on and
has stayed on ever since.  Any harm possible?  Any easy way to turn it off?
I've driven several hundred miles with it on already.

BTW Mucho thanks to the dozens of people on the list who offered advice on
my recent herky jerky hesitation problem.  i slipped in a new fuel filter
and took a 20-mile spin with no problems :-).  Will keep all the other
advice I received for future trouble shooting.  Thanks!
