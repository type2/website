&gt;and sure enough on closer inspection I found two dangling wires.
&gt; 
&gt;One wire was red and white and the other was sort of white or yellowish. 
&gt;Does anybody know which wire goes on top and bottom or does it matter ? 
&gt;Also what function does this connection serve ? I've had no trouble with 
&gt;the steering.

I believe it bumps up the idle a few ticks when steering is at full lock and
there is therefore increased load on the engine (pump's working hard).
