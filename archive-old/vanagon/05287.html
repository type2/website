&gt; &gt; I have begun receiving messages which indicate the original sender as sender
&gt; &gt; rather than the vanagon list as sender. I don't know if this is something
&gt; &gt; Gerry is doing or if my AOL software has begun doing this. 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't seen anything like that with ELM (Unix mailer)

Nor have I with ELM (except for messages that I send which come back
multiple recipients.
 &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Either way, it isn't such a good idea. When I hit my reply button the message
&gt; &gt; might go back to that individual rather than to the whole list. 
&gt; 
&gt; I prefer it that way.  You can still send a group reply if you want, which
&gt; would go back to the list.  Having ALL replies sent to the list makes it
&gt; very hard to send private mail as a response.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; About 1/2 of the messages on this list have no business being here as it is
&gt; &gt; merely mindless chatter from lonely people. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why thank you.  What a genuinely nice thing to say!
Derek; why don't you define mindless chatter? Some might consider your
above points mindless and something that should be directed towards
Gerry rather than the group. Stupid is as stupid does... &gt;  &gt; &gt; 	
			
   
  I feel that Joel can post any
&gt; &gt; message he likes because he regularly contributes very valuable technical
&gt; &gt; information. 
&gt; 
&gt; Not to me, I don't have a Vanagon.  In principle, I agree with you, though.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 		 Some of the other people are just blowing hot air into this
&gt; &gt; thing and it has the potential to drive people with real jobs and real lives
&gt; &gt; off the list. 

Derek please define hot air. What makes your points more valuable and
worth listening to?
&gt; 
&gt; Now come on Derek, ALL of us have &quot;real jobs and real lives&quot;.  Yes, that
&gt; includes Ric.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The saving grace is when people properly identify their subject matter. Those
&gt; &gt; of us who don't want to read poems about our campers have learned what Friday
&gt; &gt; Haiku means. 
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Messages still go through here like &quot;Glad to hear that,&quot;  &quot;I agree,&quot; or
&gt; &gt; &quot;Thanks for all your help.&quot; I feel that if you have this little to say that
&gt; &gt; you should send a private message. 

If I want to thank several people for advice I will do so en masse rather
than Individually. Sorry if you think thanking people is trivial....

&gt; I bet a few of them were intended to be.  It's entirely too easy to hit &quot;r&quot;
&gt; to reply and forget that it is sent to the list.  I've even done it a couple
&gt; of times, and I do this stuff for a living.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please don't generate traffic just to generate traffic. There are plenty of
&gt; &gt; places for that sort of thing in cyberspace.

How can you know this is what people are doing? The reason this list is
more interesting is that it crosses a greate divide of technical and
personal interests. If its technical information only you seek try
vintagvw. Can you say dull and repetitive?
 &gt; 
&gt; If I might add a little pet peeve of my own, Please also don't quote 80 lines
&gt; of text and add 3 new ones at the bottom in your reply!!!!  Even with a 56
&gt; row window this gets annoying...

I did this once recently, precisely to point out how easily loads of
&quot;infomation&quot; can de shot down with one or two simple sentences.
