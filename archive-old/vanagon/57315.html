Thomas,

Dave is trying to pool a group of people together who would like to buy ONE
or more of the electric busses. The guy who has them will only sell the
entire lot, not individually, hence the need to organize a group purchase.
Contact him for all the details.

Someobody posted some great web recources for electric vehicles. I can
forward the post to you if you didn't catch it.

&gt; Tony,
&gt; 
&gt; PG&amp;E stands for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.  They are our local power
&gt; company and I beleive there is a discount on ones electric bill if they
&gt; drive an electric vehicle.  No, I don't know much about EVs and no I
&gt; haven't spoken to David.  Any idea what the total cost for all five
&gt; vehicles is?  I am a little confused as it sounded like we would have to
&gt; buy al ten vehicles.
