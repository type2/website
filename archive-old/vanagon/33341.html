I think we all need to take a moment of silent contemplation with regard to
Thom's late bus (well, early late bus).

I don't think this should be considered an idiot story, because I've seen
too many good buses buy the farm this way.  I've seen no less than a dozen
at the side of the freeway, fully involved, with their proud, sad owners
standing about 50 feet away watching the whole thing:  Once while I was
driving up the I-5 north of Grapevine, I saw two guys frantically unloading
backpacks from a bus with black smoke pouring out the engine vents.  No
fire extinguisher, they were on a lonely offramp, I had no extinguisher, so
it was gone.  Another was a 23 window on the 605 lighting up the night with
40ft high flames engulfing it.  not even the front license plate could be
saved, the gas had pooled around the whole car.

I have almost had my bus torched a few times.  I think (and maybe some of
you have figured this out too) that the fuel connection on the carburetors,
which is pressed in, tends to work loose with vibration over time (I had
several do this).  Sucker comes out while you're on the freeway, and hoses
the hot engine with gas before you can stop it.  I used to take a
coathanger and make a hook around the hose clamp and over the carb, once
flattening the end and bolting onto the carb with one of the bowl cover
bolts.  Never had one actually come out after that, though it might loosen
(hopefully just enough to alert you to the problem without actually
torching the van to do it!).

My deepest sympathies to Thom.  But perhaps we need to use his post to
launch an independent &quot;hard luck&quot; thread?  I'd be in tears for weeks,
though...
