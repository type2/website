Subject: Rubber thingy around the roof



Hi,
	I have found out why the rubber thing around the roof
was coming off on my Westfalia '86. The way the thing originally 
stayed on was through the action of a very long &quot;clip&quot; inside
the rubber which closed it tight onto the plexiglass roof.
The problem is that with time, water still does run into this
rubber thing and rusts the &quot;clip&quot; which eventually crumbles
into dust. This is the point at which you notice that your
rubber thing is falling off.
	When I bought my Vanagon last year, the rubber thing 
had been glued back on in a few places but it was coming off
again in others. I decided to take the whole thing off, scrape
the metal dust and remaining bits of rusted clip out of the
rubber thing (this is long, and painful on your fingers) and 
glue it back on.
	Well, the final step has yet to be done. Luckily, the
rubber thing is mostly decorative and doesn't really keep anything
from getting wet anyway. My problem is the following. I don't
know what kind of glue to use. The best would be contact cement
apparently, but if I put this on the rubber thing and wait 20 
minutes, both sides of it will surely stick together! Other types
of glue are mostly too stiff to glue rubber onto plexiglass.

	Has anyone else done this successfully? What did you use?

Thanks!!
