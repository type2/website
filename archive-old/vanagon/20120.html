Subject: Re: Odd plate?

Don't we see the same thing on the seventies vans when they went to EFI?
(circa mid '75 or so).
It does seem likely it's for  a mech. fuel pump.


&gt;  I think Europe got wasserboxers with carburetors, at least in the first 
&gt;  years. That might explain a feature on the case for a fuel pump.

&gt;&gt; Mine has it too.  ('84 westy).  It seems to me that that plate is the 
&gt;&gt; size and shape of the fuel pump hole on air-cooled VWs.  Does anyone know 
&gt;&gt; this for sure.
