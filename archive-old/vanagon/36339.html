Subject: Re: Towing a Bus


  It doesn't hurt to
&gt; write (with white shoe polish) on the rear window of the towee's vehicle,
&gt; &quot;CAR IN TOW.&quot;  If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the
&gt; residents can't read, this might not help.
&gt; 
Where I'm from  it's only the illiterate rednecks that tow vehicles 
with staps! 8~)
