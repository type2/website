Subject:      cheap fix to vanagon hesitation problem (harness fix)

from the mar-apr 95 issue of LiMBO:

$0.79 power capacitor!

After 1-1/2 to 2 hours of driving at a constant speed in your '85 or later
Vanagon, you experience a lack of power, stalling or cutting out, and bucking
or jerking but the vehicle will always restart immediately and the condition
may not recur for several weeks or months. The factory fix is rather
expensive wiring harness replacement for the air flow sensor potentiometer
-G19- (on VW wiring diagrams). To save the big $$$, do it yourself, and get
that Van bvack in top running shape.

the first item to get ahold of is a Plus 10, 16-volt capacitor (Radio Shack/
Archer 10 MFD Tantalum Capacitor, 16 WVDC max.), some solder, and a soldering
gun. Begin by locating the air flow sensor potentiometer which is in the
right hand side of the engine compartment and is part of the air filtration
unit.
* Remove the connector from the air flow sensor potentiometer
* Pull back boot on connector for the air flow sensor
* Remove terminals from slots -2- and -4- of connector
* Cut off terminals at ends of wires
* Determine which lead is positive on capacitor (indicated with + or on the
    same side as the rounded &quot;head&quot;)
* Solder positive lead to wire from slot -2- and negative lead to wire
    from slot -4-
* Crimp on new terminals and install into connector

Apparently this is caused by a vibration resonence of the metering
potentiometer wiper during extended driving at constant speeds. After doing
this on a '91 Vanagon we noticed a 70 percent improvement in drivability.
Unfortunately there is still a narrower range power loss/bucking only at
65mph, as opposed to 45-75mph. The next step will be to try a larger MFD
value capacitor. VW latest suggestion is a 22MFD, Tantalum capacitor, 25VDC.
Having not found a 22MFD, our next step will be to piggy-back two 10MFDs
and see if things improve further. More on this next month.
