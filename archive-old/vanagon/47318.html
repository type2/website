&gt; My new/old 88 westy has a 12 litre or 3 gallon lp gas bottle...  I know

&gt; on propane.  The fridge... another story!  What a drag getting that thing 
&gt; to light.  I was getting blisters fropm pumping that &quot;a&quot; dial.  Make a 
&gt; long story short, I read some postings on the list and tried them out... 
&gt; the thing now works like a charm.  Gotta love the list!

I'm now at about 20 days of camping on a tank, running fridge about 
12-14hrs /day, and stove once a day or so to boil a kettle. First 
time I've filled it, so I've no idea how much longer it'll go.
