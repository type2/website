I listed a similar post on vintag vw. I went out tonight to look at a 69
camper.
  The body is in better shape than either my 71 or 68 (trany sucks though). I
am thinking of sacrificing the 68 &amp; 71 to get the camper in prime shape. My
main question on vintagvw concerned putting the disk breaks on the 69 and if
it is possible does this mean moving the whole front end? Here I would hope to
get a bet more into the camper itself. The kid who is selling it knows nothing
of its background or anything about vws. What is the external 120 volt plug
for? Does the cot on the roof really tend to fall in on people below? And that
gas heater in the engine compartment--I couldn't believe it. I had heard of
such a thing but thought they only had those in Britain (an old Hanes book)
and had never seen one. Are they safe? Are they standard? There goes the place
I planned to put the spare battery. And do you really have to shell out $260+
to replace the tent material on top?

I will say it is a nifty little thing. And my wife (whose fault it is I am
dealing with busses at all--including the camper) and I may just go for it. If
so we will be offering $400. I will let you know what happens.
