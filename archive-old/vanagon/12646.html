Subject: Re: VW motor lifespan ? (A Poll!)


&gt;Are there any good statistics on the life of a VW Water-cooled HO 4-bnager?

I wondered about this too,

        So, would everyone who wants to please send me directly the year 
(and month if possible) of their vanagon wasserboxer and the mileage 
currently on the chassis. If you have had serious motor work that involved 
replacement of the engine or say pistons/main bearings, could you indicate 
the mileage when that occurred. Maybe we can figure out something regarding 
lifespans. Catastrophic failures due to total coolant or oil loss should be 
identified, since these hopefully are not normal lifespans.   Thanks, I'll 
post a summary in a couple of weeks?    tim s.

'85 _at_ 162,000 kilometres
'87 _at_ 115,600 kilometres

heads done on both, no major rebuilds.
