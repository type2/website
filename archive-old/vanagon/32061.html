RE:	sweet revenge

This message is sent to you with the hope you will forward it to EVERYONE you
have ever seen in your entire life.  In the spirit of the overkill,
please feel free to post and re-post it anywhere and everywhere until you
are murdered by a mob of angry list managers.  Okay everyone. . . . a
true story of gullibility in the good old U.S. A.   Thought y'all might enjoy
this; if nothing else, is shows the longevity of urban legends.  My
daughter and I had just finished a taco at Montgomery Ward  Cafe in Dallas
and decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are such cookie
lovers, wedecided to try the &quot;Montgomery Ward Cookie.&quot;  It was so excellent
that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small smirk,
&quot;Like hell!.&quot;  Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe?  With a
evil smile, she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked how much, and she responded, &quot;Two-fifty.&quot;
I said with approval, just add it to my tab.  Thirty days later, I received
my VISA statement from Monkey Ward and it was $285.00.  I looked again and
I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two tacos and about $20.00 for a scarf.
As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe - $250.00.&quot;
Boy, was I upset!!  I called M-W's Accounting Dept. and told them the
waitress said it was &quot;two-fifty,&quot; and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a
cookie recipe.  I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they
said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not
just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes . . . the bill would
stand.  I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try to get any of my
money back.  I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to
have $250.00 worth of fun.&quot;  I told her that I was going to see to it that every
cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Monkey-Ward for nothing.
She replied, &quot;I'll have to kill you.&quot;  I said, &quot;Sorry, but this is the
only way I feel I could get even,&quot; and I will.  So, here it is, and please pass
it to someone else or run a few copies . . .  I paid for it; now you can have it
for free.

(Recipe may be halved):
2 Cups butter
3 Cups flour
2 tsp soda
2 Cups sugar
1 Cup crushed tortilla chips
4 Cups instant grits
24 oz chocolate chips
2 Cups brown sugar
1 tsp salt
1 8 oz Zagnut bar (grated)
4 eggs
2 tsp curry powder
2 Tbsp dried mustard
3 Cups chopped leeks
2 tsp vanilla

Measure grits &amp; tortilla chips and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
Cream the butter and
both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt,
curry powder, mustard, and soda.  Add chocolate chips, Zagnut bar and leeks.
Form into pyramids  and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10
minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.

Have fun!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story.  That's it.  Please,
pass it along to everyone you know, single people, mailing lists, etc. . . .
