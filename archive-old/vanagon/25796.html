Subject: more heating ideas
Date: 29 Sep 95 12:16EDT

I just thought I'd throw this out there for those of you with
electrical hookups in your vans.  My good friend has an 84
Westy and lives in Nebraska.  Last year he got the bright idea
of sticking a ceramic heater in the van, plugged into a timer
in the outlet, with the van hooked up to house current.  He
set the timer to go on in the mornings about 30 minutes before
he'd go out to let the van warm up for his commute.  _He claimed_
that even in the worst of weather, that little heater would do
a good job of melting ice on the windows &amp; heating up the interior.
then he'd unplug &amp; drive off, toasty &amp; warm.
