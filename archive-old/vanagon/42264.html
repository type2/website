Subject: Weber Progressive on '72

I have looked through the archives and could not find an answer.. I am
converting old, beat up, falling apart Dual Solex to a Weber progressive.  The
job went smoothly until I got to the accelerator cable. Where is the best
place to go through the shroud.  (the 2 holes I put in did not seem to work
too well)? and I seem to be missing a basic concept with where/how the cable
is attatched to the carb.  The way I see it -- the throtle linkage is
backwards. Again I must be missing something basic.  

Thank You
Please E-mail me directly if any of this makes enogh sense to respond to.
