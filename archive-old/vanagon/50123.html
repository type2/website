Subject: Push Rod Tubes ?
Date: Sun, 6 Oct 1996 07:25:23 -0400 (EDT)

I'm looking for push rod tubes that can be fitted to my '87 Vangon's 2.1 l
engine without removing the heads.  West Coast Metric has them but wants
$45.00 each for them.  Is there a cheaper source for these spring loaded
colapsable push rod tubes ?  Preferably somewhere in Canada or someone who
will ship them to Canada.

Thanks in advance

Frank
