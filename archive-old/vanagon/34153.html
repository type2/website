Subject: Copyright and M-codes

Wouldn't the ads, and the phone numbers in the ads, be
copyrighted also? Seems to me that NEATO published proprietary VW
information.  Otherwise, for anyone to publish any M-code should
be public.  They aren't the same as Tech articles, or any
stories.  It wasn't a photocopy either. Of course I'm no lawyer,
thank god (sorry Ric). 
 
What I'm getting at is that the M-codes are like engine codes. 
It is information that has already been disseminated.  I hope
Bosch doesn't take down the site with FI info just because it has
part numbers and interchange references.

And I respond:
 
As I would interpret things [usual disclaimers apply], the 
M-codes themselves are not subject to copyright. However, the
compilation of the M-codes into a document by the OBR would
protected by copyright. Since the M-codes were assembled from
various sources [I assume by the compilation of letters from the
factory from NEATO members], and the information is not generally
available from other sources, I would think that the OBR has a
claim to ownership of the M-code listing as it appeared on the
Web. It's not quite the same thing as posting the model years
with engine and chassis numbers...those are widely available from
numerous sources.
 
Now (forgive my lack of name references: I don't have an e-mail
archive at home) if one of the contributors to the OBR M-code
listing gave his data to another for public dissemination before
it was published in the OBR, there may be a valid claim that the
OBR doesn't have exclusive right to that portion of the document.
 
Personally, I'd be really pleased if the OBR/NEATO people would
recognise the fact that by allowing worldwide access to the 
M-code listing they started, they'd be doing a service to VW
enthusiasts everywhere, as well as quite possibly getting some of
the gaps filled in. It could only serve to enhance their
reputation.  But that's their business, not mine.
