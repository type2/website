&gt; Hello Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; '87 models come with the Digifant system, Right?  .  Looks as if the coolant temp 

Digijet I believe is for '87 and '88?  '89 and on is the Digifant.


&gt; sensor I need to relace is mounted right under the thermostat housing and can be
&gt; easily removed from above.  Apparently you remove the retaining clip, slide
&gt; out the old/in the new, and you're done.  I suppose some coolant loss is 
&gt; inevitable, so I should release any residual cooling system pressure first.  
&gt; There must be a rubber seal--should it be replaced too?

I'll let Joel field this one.  Mine was replaced under Ye Old Emission Warrantee. ;)

Steven
