Have had a  2.0 l GEX for 12 months and 11000 miles. No oil consumption
and compression is at 145 all around (it got us from CA to Ottawa -no
problem). The engine was a DIY installation and was delivered through 
Menlo Auto Parts at a price of 1500. The initial deliver had flywheel
endplay that was in excess of the limits (about four thousands out). It
was replaced without question the same week. We investigated many
companies in the CA area and  concluded that GEX had the best combination
of price, reliability and reputation. The heads on the 2l are not new,
pistons, rings, bearings, cylinders are.  On the 1600 the heads will be new.

Have been told by one mechanic that some rebuilders use valve seat inserts
which come out at 15,000 or so. Not sure about GEX. Others have said that
work related to major mechanical failure incurred after 10 thou or so will
still be partially covered by GEX.


One thing that has struck me as odd though. After scanning this and other
VW lists for about a year or so:  there are a significant number of Vans
for sale which have a a few thousand miles on rebuilds. Are the sellers
hiding something? -DC
