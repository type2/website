&gt;So until I can find time to get the nuts off (all frozen save one). The
&gt;van sits in the parking lot and Martine and I use the bike to get around.

======================
I have, for at least 20 years, and a half a dozen vehicles of all kinds, been
putting a touch of a lead based high temp anti-sieze compund on my lug
threads.  I have NEVER had a frozen lug bolt or nut.  Neither have I ever had
one come loose either.  Everything so treated has remained clean, no
corrosion, and torques down nicely.   I do tighten and torque all these
lugs/nuts with a torque wrench, and the few times I have had to change a tire
in an unanticipated situation, the stock wrench for whatever vehicle it was
worked fine.  I have used just the smallest dab on the threads, and for those
lugs or nuts that have a contoured shoulder that mates to an opposite contour
on the wheel, just a light touch at that interfaces as well.
