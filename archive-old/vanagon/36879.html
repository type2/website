Subject: ? Vanagon 091/1 Output Shaft &amp; SAW

Hi All,

My 84 Vanagon's 4-speed 091/1 Tranny is needing an output shaft (I'd call 
it a pilot shaft) and VW wants about $80 for one.  I noticed in the 
latest 'How VWs' that SAW makes them.  Since I doubt SAW sells their 
products retail, I was wondering if anyone out there might know how much 
SAW is asking for this critters before I call Barrett's or one of the 
other aftermarket retailers.  

Better yet, if anyone has a used one they might want to sell, let me 
know.  Mine is all chewed up as the pilot brg went out.  Thanks.
