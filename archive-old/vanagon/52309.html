&gt; Problem #2.  When I drive in alot of stop-n-go traffic the Aux battery was
&gt; running down to nothing.  I checked the battery. It is fine.  I put a
&gt; voltmeter on the alternator at idle and it reads 13.8v.  I put it on the posts
&gt; on the isolator and they read 12.9v! I am losing a volt in the friggin
&gt; isolator!  I tried different isolators, same result. 

I too have a '86 Syncro Westy and I've installed my auxiliary battery
behind/under the drivers seat. I did not use an isolator because I
couldn't figure out how to do it without getting the kind of problems
you are describing. Instead I followed the Bentley Manual and used a 40
amp relay ($10.00). The relay is switched with the same wire connections
used for the existing camping gear relay. The power side of the relay
can be taken from the camping relay power post but I ran a separate 6
guage wire from the main battery +ve post because I thought it might be
safer to not overload the existing wiring. For added safety I included a
40 amp fuse between this 6 guage wire and the 40 amp relay. This setup
can never drain your main battery from anything connected to your
auxiliary battery. Likewise only your main battery is connected when
starting the engine. This setup also ensures that the auxiliary battery
is only charged when your main battery is fully charged.

&gt; Problem #1.  I can easily take out the main battery by sliding the passenger
&gt; seat back and turning it around to face the front.  How do I take out the Aux
&gt; battery?  When I turn the driver seat to the side there is still not enough
&gt; room.  The steering wheel prevents turning it towaerd the rear.  It looks like
&gt; I need to remove the seat to remove the battery.

The battery I use as an auxiliary is a 32 amp-hr gel cell of the wheel
chair category. It is small enough to fit with the driver's seat turned
sideways. It is however about 1/8 inch too high. For safety, I covered
the battery with a non-conductive plastic sheet. The gel cell does not
need to breath so the is no ventilation/explosion problem.

If you need more amp-hrs than I do, you could put yet another auxiliary
battery under the back seat or in the engine compartment (back LHS). The
extra auxialiary battery would have to be connected in parallel to the
first auxiliary battery with 6 guage (or heavier) wires.
