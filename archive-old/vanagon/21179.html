&gt;Has anyone on the list ever heard of a flower vase that originally came
&gt;with VW buses (set on the dash)? What would originals be worth? My nephew
&gt;swears there was such a thing, but I've never heard of it.

Bus Boys and Rocky Mountain Motorworks sell these ... not cheap, but nice
looking. called Blumenvasen. several other places also sell them. i think
they are all reproductions (not originals).
