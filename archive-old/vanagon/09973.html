&gt;I have one question:
&gt;on the case, under the oil cooler, there is stamped &quot;020&quot;.  I have a hunch 
&gt;that this means the case is line bored 20 thou. over.  Any one know if this 
&gt;is true, and does anyone have the stock dimension of the mains?  I could 
&gt;then measure and be sure.
According to the Bentley for that year, the bores for main bearings 1, 2, and
3 are 65.00-65.02mm (2.5590-2.5598in) and number 4 should be 50.00-50.03mm
(1.9685-1.9696in).  Hope it helps.
