Subject: Antenna Mounting



&gt;   I need to mount an antenna for our celluar phone.  I don't mind making a 
&gt;   permanent job of it, so holes are OK.  Mag mounts don't seem logical for 
&gt;   all the obvious reasons.

on the '82 diesel westy:
We have the cellular antenna mounted on the upper left corner of the winshield
(hole and everything) and the cable runs down (somewhat concealed) the side
of the rubber seal for the windshield.  It seems to work fine.

We had no such work done on the '87 or the EV -- we realized that there
is hardly any difference in performance whether one uses the standard
dinky antennas on the units themselves or the installed antenna...
