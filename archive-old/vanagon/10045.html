Subject: Rear Heater 

Well,

I called the local VW dealer and two import junk yards and no one knows 
anything about the rear heater in a camper.

Does anyone know what one would cost?  

I will do a more serious computer search of the junk yards but thought 
I'd test the list.

BTW, the local VW dealer has a policy of not working on vehicles over 10 
years old.  &quot;Say What?!?&quot;  I asked?  Yep.  No micros, bugs or any of that 
other aged vermin.  I like ta chocked.
