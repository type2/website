Subject:      for those of us who count beans ...

newspaper blurb:

Where Your Auto Dollar Goes

Last year, gas accounted for 17 cents of each $1 spent on the typical car
... just half of the 34 cents that gas ate up in 1980.  Insurance rose
slightly, from 11 cents of each $1 in 1980 to 14 cents in 1993.  Tires,
maintenance and other costs went from 8 cents in 1980 to 13 cents in 1993.
The biggest bite?  Depreciation and interest on finance charges, which rose
from 47 cents in 1980 to 56 cents last year.

so for all of you whose older buses are completely paid off, well done. :)
you're doing better than most folks.
