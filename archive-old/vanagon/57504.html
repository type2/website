&gt; How often should i take our &quot;new&quot; used EV out to keep it in good running

&gt; 
&gt; Sitting for a week seems okay, but how about two, three, etc?
&gt; When does sitting become bad?
&gt; 
&gt; We are trying to perserve our van for as long as possible and use it only for

 Truth is, the '95 Erovan can't be parked for more than two days at a
time because of an obscure and unusual design flaw particular to that
year only. That is why I would highly recommend that when you are
feeling the urge to park your van for and extended period of over two
days, you should really let a profesional 'van-sitter' such as myself
drive the car around, keeping the engine active and healthy (as well as
looking cool and taking all of his friends for rides). I am available to
do this at any time during the week except for Thursdays and Fridays
when I am already schedualed to van-sit Jay Leno's and Harrison Ford's
'95 Eurovans. 
 We are running a special discount for EV Westfalia Campers this month
provided that the fridge is fully stocked with German beer. ;)
