Subject: HELP!! Vanagon insurance appraisal screwing 
Date: Fri, 15 Sep 95 12:39:33 EDT
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

 Hey all, perhaps you recall the sad story of my friend's wreck of the
beautiful '84 camper.
Anyway, the insurance company is really screwing him, offering him
$3500. This bus was PERFECT!!!!! It had only 14,000 ORIGINAL miles.
Anyway, he is really upset, and this is not helping things.
So, if any of you have any information that would help him, especially
if you recently bought (or sold) a vanagon westy from the mid-eighties,
PLEASE PLEASE call him.
His name is Sean, and he can be reached at 919-481-3713. He will really
appreciate this very much.
I thank you as well. Please don't email me, as I will be out of town for
the next week.
Thanks
Richard
