I first got involved with VWs because he thought that a, then available, '70
Ghia vert was an alternative to my then KZ400 motorcycle. I could carry on a
conversation without screaming through the helmet to the passenger and could
still retain the wind in the hair aspect of life.
If  'verts are a sign of desire for an &quot;opening&quot; of my own, I would hate to
wonder what the claustraphobic sweatbox/zero ventilation aspect of the
Single cab splittie in the Phoenix heat represents! (much less a camper that
hasn't seen the light of day in two years). It makes the mind numb. &quot;Don't
EVEN go there... hahaha
