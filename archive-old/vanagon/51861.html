Subject: RE: Clean Fire Extinguishers

&gt;Unfortunately, you won't find a fire extinguisher that effectively stops
the fire and remains clean at the same time.  

&gt;Types of Extinguishers:
&gt;
&gt;Class A:  Ordinary Combustibles (wood, paper, rubber, plastic)
&gt;Class B:  Flammable Liquids (liquids, greases, gases)
&gt;Class C:  Electrical Equipment  (live electrical equipment)
&gt;Class D:  Combustible Metals (magnesium, titanium, and other &quot;iums&quot;)
&gt;
&gt;Class A exting. are rated from 1A to 40A depending on their size.  For a 1A
rating 1 1/4 gallons of water are required.  A 2A rating requires 2 1/2
gallons of water. (see the trend?)

&gt;A dry chemical extiguisher with a rating of 10A is equivalent to five 
&gt;1/2 gallon water extinguishers.
&gt;
&gt;Class B extinguishers are rated from 1B to 640B.  A complicated UL rating
system best described by  &quot;...the 60B extiguisher will 
&gt;effectively extinguish a sixty square foot fire when used by a non 
&gt;expert....&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Class C refers to whether the extiguishing agent conducts electricity. 
&gt;You wouldn't want to spray a flaming engine with a class A fire 
&gt;extinguisher unless you wanted to chance shock or electrocution.
&gt;
&gt;Class D--you aren't going to effectively stop the spread of burning 
&gt;metals with any portable extinguisher.  Call the FD, EPA and any other
toxic spill agency that comes to mind.
&gt;
&gt;A fire extinguisher is rated as follows.
&gt;
&gt;4A 20B:C
&gt;
&gt;This extinguisher should extinguish a Class A fire that is four times 
&gt;larger than a class 1A fire, extinguish approx. 20 sq/ft of class B fire
and is also safe to use on energized equipment.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,
&gt;
