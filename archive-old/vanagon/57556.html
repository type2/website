Subject:      Re: EV Screens


   EV'ers:

        Has any of you found a source for side window screens for NON-
camper EV's?  VW doesn't have them, but I seem to recall a place out
in Oregon that made them. ANyone know anything about this?

        BTW: How does Dan Hebert get 22.5 mpg on his much heavier camper
while we can never break 21 on our MV? Is it engine timing? Tires? Richness
of fuel/air mixture? Any thoughts?  We usually get 14-15  around town in the
winter, 16-17 in the summer. How does these figure square with all of you?

Cheers,
