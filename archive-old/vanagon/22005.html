Subject: what about the VW Factory???


A friend of mine has heard of a company in SD that restores 
and sells older breadloaves and campers called the VW Factory.
Has anyone dealt with these people? Are they on the up and up?
Is there a FAQ on such companies. Potential campers want to 
know.


TIA,
