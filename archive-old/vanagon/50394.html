Subject: 87 Syncro: backup lights problem

My backup lights are no longer working. Don't know when they stopped but I
suspect it was after recent work at the garage connected with electrical
problems - eventually leading to replacement of the computer. I've checked
the easy things - fuse and lights themselves. I have no idea where the
switch is located. Do any of you have suggestions?

Thanks, Nelson Hogg
