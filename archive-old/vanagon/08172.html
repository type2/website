&gt;   My tools and knowledge are inadequate for this type of engine 
&gt; swap so I'm having a mechanic handle the work. He does fabrication
&gt; MIG/TIG welding and off-road race prep type work. He says that I'll
&gt; need the following parts off the '78 donor:
&gt; 1. Air box, metal braket and associated injection parts (F.I. &quot;Brain&quot;)

Do you really want to mess with the fuel injection?  Why not use the heads
intake and carbs from the old motor?

&gt; 2. Fuel tank and fuel pump.

If you do what I recommended above, you won't have to mess with this either.

&gt; 3. Exhaust system.

Ditto.

&gt; 4. Transmission support brace.

Huh?   I don't think so.

&gt; Anyone else out there done this before?  Any hints/suggestions?

I am going to do this at my next rebuild and have researched it quite a bit.

&gt; Why don't I just rebuild the old 1.7 motor???   Good question.
&gt;   The old 1.7 had no Calif smog equipment on it. (flame me directly)

I'd rather give you a pat on the back.

&gt;   The 1.7 liter engine was only installed in a couple model year
&gt; vehicles ('73 and '74 I think.) so there's limited numbers of 1.7 
&gt; parts out there in circulation.

There are plenty of parts in circulation for those years, and they share
many parts with the newer 2.0 motors.

&gt;   More horsepower in the 2.0 (according to Bentley)

You would still get the added HP of the 2.0, and it would be indistinguishable
from the original 1.7 (read no problem smogging it, at least no more than
you had when you started).
