&gt;      Hey David, wanna put those Bus pix on my server for Steven and anyone 
&gt;      else?? I've already got a few Brazilian Buses on there - so they would 
&gt;      go nice. Jpeg please though about 64k.

I'd be happy to.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck here at home today because
I just had all of my wisdom teeth extracted this morning.  Converting
graphics files under X-windows over a modem is slow at best.  I hope I can get
them done before the novocaine wears off.  :)  Anyway, I am putting the
pictures on my home page (http://bugatti.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/index.html)
as I write this.  The pics on the web page are 8-bit gifs, and don't look
as nice as the 24 bit tiffs on the ftp site.  *sigh*

If you tell me where to send the jpgs I'll get them to you.

-David
