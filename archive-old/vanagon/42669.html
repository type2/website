Subject: Re: Wife wants a Vanagon - mileage question

&gt;Volks Folks,
&gt;
&gt;My '86 Jetta with a 1.8 liter gas engine has 161,000 miles on it and still
&gt;going strong with only minimal maintainence.  How many miles could I expect
&gt;on the average from a Vanagon with a 2.1 liter?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;-Dan

Hi Dan
     My vanagon has over 160,000 miles on it.  The engine was replaced by
the PO at 48,000 for unknown reasons.  The van drives daily 50 miles round
trip at between 70 and 75 mph.  It uses very little oil most of which leaks
out the valve covers.  One day I will get around to redoing the cover gaskets.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
