Subject: 75 westy, question i just remembered!


once again, an idem on the enigne i wish to identify..

looking down on engine fromthe hatch, you see the carb, &lt;aftermarket 
weber progressive....&gt; then to the rear, attatched it seems to the engine 
case, is this &quot;thing&quot; &lt;not to be confused with type 181's&gt; has a plastic 
top and a hole that maybe a hose is su[posed to be attatched to. when the 
neigne runs, smoke seems to come out of this hole at odd times...it has 
some german writting on it, which is illegible due to grease buildup, and 
that my head doent feel like getting its self stuck in there trying to 
read it..&lt;the hair and all, you know!&gt;..

any ideas? if i remember, the top popped off, but that was a while ago 
now...kinda vague..any help would be appreciated...btw, it is mounted 
right in the center of the einge, just rear of the manifold venter..

TIA
