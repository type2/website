&gt;Does anyone know if the Westy outlet receptacles for the water, electric
&gt;and water tank have to be replaced with the exact ones or can I get them
&gt;at any RV store. The dealers price is ridiculous.

Go to Euro-American RV Products.  They used to be Delta Six industries, who
manufactured these originally.  Their phone number (1.818.760.4214) and
other information is in the 'Vendors' list at http://www.vanagon_dot_com/
