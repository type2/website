Subject: 85 GL for sale-CHEAP!

Greetings,
 I have an 85 GL which needs exhaust work to pass inspection,costing
more than I'm willing to spend, so here is your chance! All you have to
do is beat a yunkyard price. It's recent history includes
 NEW HEADS '94
 new radiator 94
 engine rebuild [bottom end mainly] about 4 years ago
 new PS box 4 years ago
 .....

I'd like to see it go to someone who could use the parts .
Bill
ps-Sorry for the previous message-the mail editor has recently changed
and I still havent figured it out.
