Subject: Update the Stats

It's time to update the stats again Joel.

We got another Vanagon. This time it's an '88 Westy 
with 30,000 miles on it's clock.  It will be parked
over the winter months here in Minnesota's Winter
Wonderland to keep it away from the salty roads.

We haven't used it yet, but hope to take trips
with it right away in the spring.

87 Syncro GL
88 Westy
90 GL and 91 MultiVan wrecks (no parts available...  yet)
