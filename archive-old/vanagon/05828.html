&gt;Are we all humored, poemed, haikued, or burned out or what? Fridays
&gt;used to be so much fun 'round here....now the only thing i have
&gt;to look forward to on fridays is Joel's list....&lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;Come on people, get with it...where's the songs, the mirth, the
&gt;picking on Martha's flannel shirts...

well, there was this BIGGGG explosion ... yeah, heheheheheheheh ... BIGGGGGGG
explosion. and ... and ... and ... everybody's buses .. no, no ... everybody's
computers got burned! yeah, that's it! or something like that. fer shure.

since it seems that the great majority of folks on the list have something
to do with the Grand and Glorious World of Academia, which is supposedly
concerned with Grinding Out Them Diplomae (but is really concerned mainly
with Being, Seeing, or Peeing on Students) ... well, it's just likely
midterms and projects and the-summer-is-over-folks. that sort of thing.

or maybe there was this BIGGGGG explosion ... :)

or maybe the cognative image of martha's flannel ...             ;)

p.s. if Ric is bored, folks, we are ALL in great danger!!! 'Bored' lawyers
run for congress!!!
