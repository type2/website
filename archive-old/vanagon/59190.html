Subject: Window Tinting

Hi,

I'm thinking of having my windows tinted in my 85 Westie and was 
wondering if anyone has experience with this. I'm going for the 50% 
tint for the back and sides and 35% for the front driver and 
passenger  windows. This is not completely legal {the 35% for the 
front}here in Virginia, but this is what new factory vans have so I think that's a
double standard. The reason I'm doing this is for, of course, 
privacy, but mainly because I have no AC and I'm hoping this will cut down on 
the heat in the summer. I'm wondering if the 50% will effect my ability to 
see out of the back side windows to check blindspots especially at 
night.
Thanks for any comments, advice, suggestions, experiences, etc.,

Rick
