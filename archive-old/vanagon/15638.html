&gt;The reliability record of the Wasserboxer is so poor that you couldn't 
&gt;possibly have peace of mind that  you are going to make it.  
&gt;
&gt;In fact there has to be a mailing list in order to know how to keep them 
&gt;running

Folks,

It seems entirely possible that we're having our collective chains yanked.
Is Leo trolling us?  (If so, he's been pretty successful.)
