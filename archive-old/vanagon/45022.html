So misterc says:
&gt; excuse.  THANKS!  I have a rattle, a MAJOR rattle that comes from 
&gt; somewhere around the kitchen cabinet.  I have taken out all the 
&gt; shelves and checked everything I can.  There isn't anything loose.  It 
&gt; sounds like a piece of metal knocking against something.  I am afraid 
&gt; it might be a loose gas pipe or something dangerous.  My regular 
&gt; mechanic gave up right away.  I thought it might be nice to find out 
&gt; if some other owner had had the same problem and what they did.  Again 
&gt; if this is not the correct venue, please ignore.  Thanks much, Robert 

Are you sure it isn't the metal drip rack (attached to the bottom side
of the cover) rattling against the grill top?  If so, slide a piece of 
cardboard between the two when you close down the top.

Also, check to see if you have anything that might be making the
rattling noise stuck up in that grove thing that runs alonge the
drivers side and holds up one side of the upper bunk.  I through
all kinds of stuff in that place.
