&gt; Does anyone on the list know of vanagon model kits?

I have the famous &quot;Magnum PI&quot; Revell 1/25th Vanagon Model in dark brown
plastic.  I think it may even have a sunroof, I don't recall...
It's based upon the same kit that is currently available in white plastic.
For those of you having brain fade,, the helicopter pilot on Magnum PI
drove a Vanagon on the show.
