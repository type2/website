Subject: Blowing oil

                        Oil and Breathers

All piston engines experience some degree of 'blow-by', the
common name for leakage of combustion gases past the piston
rings.  When you consider that the peak chamber pressure on a
high-compression engine approaches 1200 psi, and match that with
the fact your rings have gaps, it's pretty easy to see where the
blow-by comes from.

(Two points to douse incipient flamers:  There are such things as
piston rings without gaps, and the specific impulse pressure in a
stock VW engine is more on the order of 600 psi.)

Pumping hot gases into the crankcase of an engine isn't a good
idea but it happens and it has to be dealt with.  The solution is
to vent the crankcase to the atmosphere in order for those gases
to escape.  Unfortunately, they're liable to carry some of your
lubricating oil along with them so the vent must be provided with
some sort of oil trap.  And since the gases will be loaded with
hydrocarbons it would be nice if they weren't spewed out to
become smog, so we position the crankcase vent in a low-pressure
area near the mouth of the carb, typically inside the air-
cleaner, and hope the stuff gets sucked down the carb and all
those nasty hydrocarbons get burned up.  Sometimes it even works.

If we're sucking/blowing air OUT of the crankcase it makes good
sense to provide some place for air to come IN to the crankcase. 
Volkswagen engines have an annular inlet around the fan pulley. 
Park on a steep hill and you'll discover it by the pool of oil
that appears under your rear bumper.  (Front is UP)

If you could climb inside your crankcase while the engine was
running you'd discover surprisingly little liquid oil.  The
whirling spin of the crankshaft atomizes the oil escaping from
the rod journals.  The oil fog condenses on the walls of the
crankcase and picks up considerable heat.  The presence of this
oily vapor is a necessity but it also explains why ventilating
the crankcase often carries away a lot of oil.

The air inlet down behind the fan pulley is also a dirt inlet. 
And a water inlet.  In fact, anything in the air will be drawn
into your engine.  The crap your engine sucks in becomes the
determining factor on how long you can run between oil changes. 
Modern engines having shaft seals and filtered crankcase
ventilation systems can run 7,500 miles and more between oil
changes.  On a stock bug it's smart to change the oil at thousand
mile interval, less if you're running in dusty conditions.  If
you've fitted a full-flow oil filter you can stretch that to
3,000 miles but less is definitely better if your engine doesn't
have a shaft seal.  (The lack of a shaft seal is the major reason
why all the talk of synthetic oils is such a belly laugh when it
comes to VW engines.)

Except VW-types call them 'sand seals.'  (It's hard to explain
reality when a tits &amp; ass rag like DB&amp;HVW sez otherwise.)

Of course, once you seal up the dirt/dust/water/air hole around
the  fan pulley you'll have to provide another air inlet for your
crankcase ventilation.  Failure to ventilate the crankcase will
cause it to collect moisture which will emulsify the oil and lead
to a host of lubrication-related problems.  But make sure your
new air inlet contains a good air filter; the dome-shaped jobbie
from K&amp;N is probably best.  Don't waste your money on the ones
that use a hunk of foam or chair padding (the white Dacron
stuff).  Get one that uses a real air filter.

The new inlets are usually provided on the valve galleries, as
Volkswagen did with the Type IV engine.  (Yes, Virginia.  The
Type IV not only has a 'sand' seal it also uses a full-flow oil
filter, Kool-Tin and hydraulic valves.  In fact the Type IV has
all the things the T&amp;A magazines insist aren't really necessary
for a macho Veeduber machine.)

The best after-market crankcase ventilation systems incorporate
an oil separator with provision for returning the condensed oil
vapor to the crankcase.  This is vital if the engine is installed
in an airplane where it may be tasked with running for hours
without any chance of adding oil, as in an over-water flight.  It
also makes good sense on land vehicles, assuming you plan to live
on the same planet.

                 Why The Stock System Blows Oil

The hub of the fan pulley is grooved with a left-hand thread. 
The fan rotates to the right.  The groves act as an air pump,
actively sucking air (and anything it might contain) INTO the
engine.  The groves also act to keep the oil in the engine even
when climbing a steep grade, pumping the stuff back where it
belongs like a screw-type pump.  Just behind the fan pulley
there's a lovely dished washer that also serves to trap oil and
keep it inside the engine.  The dished washer is called an 'oil
slinger' and that's exactly what it does, thanks to centrifugal
force.  Any oily vapor that gets near the slinger gets condensed
and slung into the grove in which the oil slinger spins, where it
runs down the walls and returns to the sump.

So how can the thing possibly leak?  By overloading the system. 
Here's how to do it.  Run your vehicle at some insane speed until
it's hotter than a two-dollar pistol then, still going flat-out,
lift your foot off the throttle.  Bingo!  When the throttle
closes the crankcase is suddenly 'way over atmospheric pressure
and a gust of oily vapor escapes around the pulley hub.  A lot of
it is caught by the spinning fan pulley, condensed, and slung
around the engine compartment.  But a lot of vapor also comes
from the inlet of the air cleaner because that's where the
crankcase ventilation exhaust is located.  The overpressure
inside the crankcase pushes oily vapor into the air cleaner but
since the throttle is closed it has only one place to go, out
into the engine compartment.

Do a lot of high-speed running and you'll notice the walls of
your engine compartment slowly growing a layer of grime.  That's
your engine oil, folks.  Courtesy of a sixty year old engine
design.  Of course, no one thought much of it back then; the
factory oil consumption spec for the Model A (the Volkswagens
original competitor) was one quart per 100 miles!  A misty little
dab of oil here and there was a quantum improvement, taken as a
sign of superior Chermann engineering.

You say you never lift your foot off the throttle like that? 
Balls!  We all do it, even if we think we don't.  Hitting a bump
is enough defeat the stock crankcase ventilation system, which is
why the emission control people get so het-up over older
Volkswagens.

                           Sermonette

If you're running a stock Volkswagen engine you are maintaining a
museum piece.  Fortunately, the design of the engine is flexible
enough to allow the retrofit of all mod. cons.  Yeah, it costs
something, but the pay-back is more than the expense.  No more
valve adjustments.  Change the oil twice a year.  And the new
engine will last twice as long as that greasy lump that's in
there now.  It's worth thinking about.
