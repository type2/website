Subject: Well MZ MAGIC is mobile

Between getting tires and having some work done it's been over 2 weeks since I 
bought MZ MAGIC.  She's finally mobile..now onto the fun....

I have  a couple of what most of you think are stupid questions...

	Can you go up on the camper top...outside...I don't think you can...anyway if 
so  what is the poundage limit?

	Do I need to drain the water tank in the winter...we live in the DC area and it 
does get cold for as much as a week without getting up above freezing..MZ MAGIC is 
parked outside?

First trip will be North Carolina or Woodstock, NY (My parents...aged over 70 moved 
there about 5 years ago)...love to visit.
