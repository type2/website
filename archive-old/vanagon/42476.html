Subject: Hot feet

	Well, after the first week of driving my new van, I have only run 
across one minor problem. Whenever I accelerate, the heat in the front 
seems to turn itself up a bit. It becomes very noticeable and almost 
uncomfortable on the highway, and with the heat we have in Maryland right 
now, it is something I would like to try to fix. Any suggestions as to 
where I might start? Or is this something that is normal in these vans? 
Thanks in advance.



                  				Take it easy,
								Dan
