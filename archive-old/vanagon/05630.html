Thomas,

   Where was your Vanagon first sold. Only European Vanagons have carburetors
   (and only some of them, even there). I have seen pictures of the early
   European wasserboxer engines and it looks like a two barrel carb on top
   of a longish manifold.
   
   I concur with the other David though; check the ignition first - that's
   where the problems are usually found.
