Subject: bus for sale/trade

I am selling a 1974 Westy in southern NH.  It is in super condition.  I
am asking $3,400 but would be willing to trade it for a small pickup
truck of equal value (I'd even kick in some $$ for a nice truck).  I
need either a 4x4 regular cab or a 4x2 extra cab.  Please Email with
questions or details.
