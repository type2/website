Subject: new van group


Saw this on the RV newsgroup; may be of interest:

&quot;How about it? Any Vanners lurking around this newsgroup? I am a member
of the Misty Mountain Van Club of the Northern California Van Council.
Several west coast vanners have created the VannerNet, for van owners
and enthusiast. Lot's of information on events is available, please
reply for more details! thanks
