Subject: New Year's Eve at Martha's

I've been off the list for the holidays, so don't know if Martha has
described her SF Bay area NY Eve party to the list.  We attended with the
group for the first time with Martha &amp; Nate; Bradley; Clara (down from the
NW) and father, Sam; and Martha's family - 2 daughters (anonymous teens) &amp;
dog, Phoebe.  Bradley teased the girls and burned phosphorous pellets on
Martha's wood-burning stove.  Clara (owner of 13 splitties, etc.), a
vegetarian, avoided Martha's great soup and lasagna, while Sam and Martha
passed files on their Mac laptops.  Then, after a few raspberry beers,
Martha (an accomplished professional musician) played the piano, while I
(strictly amateur tenor) attempted to sing.  Martha called Joel and we all
wished him a Happy New Year.  We had a great time until long after
Midnight.

Bradley volunteered to help me lay sod on Friday, so we can attend the Big
Sur campout (sure, fat chance)!  Anyway, we sure enjoyed the invitation.
Thanks to Martha and this list.
