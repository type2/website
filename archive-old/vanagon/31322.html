Subject: Coughing solved: Attn. AFC FI owners!

5 gold stars to Kirk for debugging my problem; Honorable Mention to 
Stefan Ufer for saying &quot;just pry off the cover and look at it!&quot;

Short story:
The air flow sensor consists of a copper arm that scrapes back and forth 
on a printed circuit board to tell the Brain how much air is entering 
your engine. This copper arm will eventually wear through the conductive 
coating on the circuit board: loss of electrical contact in this arm will 
cause your FI system to shut down at the related rpm range. 

Symptoms:
&quot;Coughing&quot; where the whole engine seems to shut down for momentary 
periods of time: almost like water in your fuel tank. Letting up on the 
accelerator or pressing the accelerator to the floor usually remedies the 
problem over the short term. i.e. this is a problem that will most likely 
occur at a specific rpm range---usually cruising rpms. (My girlfriend was 
right when she said that the Bus liked her driving better: she drove 
65-70, I usually drive 55-60...)

Solution:
Pry the cap off of your air flow sensor. Look at the track the copper arm 
makes over the circuit board as it moves with the door. If the coating is 
worn through at a particular spot, then the evidence is conclusive...I 
was able to bend the copper arm slightly such that the arc of the arm had 
a radius about 0.5 mm shorter than the original arc. Now, the arm is 
always contacting conductive material and I guess I'll be good for 
another 200K miles until the arm wears through the coating on its new track.
I would recommend that AFC owners with more than 150K on their Bus do 
this trick BEFORE the coating is penetrated... 

P.S. I just drove to Utah via NC, DC, New Mexico and Colorado with no
performance problems on my '77 with 204K miles: no coughing or hiccups!

PPS. I'll post how my new propane heater works after visiting a few 
backcountry ski spots in Wyoming, Montana, and Canada....

PPPS. Who knows how to adjust the fuel/air mixture in the AFC FI? I 
assume it has something to do with the spring that holds the air flow 
sensor door closed.....

&gt; 
&gt; What year is your van?  The symptoms sound like two different problems I've
&gt; experienced with a 79 and an 88.  The first was the air flow meter in the '79.  There's
&gt; a reostat (sp?) under that black plastic square just in front of the air filter
&gt; with a printed circuit board that wears out over time.  I pulled (OK, pried) the
&gt; cover off and *carefully* cleaned the contacts with some contact cleaner
&gt; (rubbing alchohol) and very fine sandpaper.  Seal it up when you're done with silicone
&gt; or some such goop so dirt/moisture won't get in there.  It lasted another 6 mos
&gt; before it finally  died and I replaced it.  If the symptom occurs during a
&gt; certain RPM or throttle range, that could be it. You may have a dirty or worn
&gt; spot on the printed circuit part of the air flow meter.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, see my post in the archives in Nov 95 about troubleshooting/replacing the
&gt; ECU (brain) in my 88 Westie.  Let me know if you don't have access to the
&gt; archives and I'll email it directly to you.  Let's hope it's not that...

&gt; OK, I've avoided this problem for two years because of the diagnosis 
&gt; difficulties, but now it's occurring more regularly. 
&gt; 
&gt; During acceleration and/or during cruising speeds, I sometimes get a 
&gt; momentary cough, where the whole engine seems to shut down: like either a 
&gt; momentary lack of power to the fuel injection system or a sudden blockage 
&gt; of fuel flow. The whole bus shudders and shakes for one/two seconds and 
&gt; then resumes normal (smooth) operation. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is a tough one to debug because the problem never occurs during idle 
&gt; or engine revving and only randomly on the road...
&gt; 
&gt; I've already done full tune-ups and replaced the fuel and air filters.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to check:
&gt; 1) Foreign matter in the fuel tank
&gt; 2) Fuel pressure.
&gt; 3) Systematic check of FI components.
&gt; 
&gt; My plugs are black--but not gunky or oily--could I be running too rich at 
&gt; times to cause random coughing ???
&gt; 
&gt; Other suggestions ?
