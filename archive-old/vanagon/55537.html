Subject: '86 ECU (digifant) needed!!!!!
Date: Wed, 5 Feb 1997 10:14:47 -0500

Hi All!

No luck yet finding an ECU for my wifes 'new' '86. Checked everything and
indeed it is the ECU (thanks everyone for the help).

I've called everyone I can think of and haven't turned one up. Bosch
doesn't make rebuilt anymore (so I'm told) and there's no way I can swing
the VW's price of $700 or so!!

Can anyone help?

BTW, John's Car Corner had one, I ordered it, waited 5 days, it never
showed, I called them, they said &quot;oh, that unit was defective so we didn't
send, guess we should have called&quot;, Yeah, well, no _ _ _ _!

tony
