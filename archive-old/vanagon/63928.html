Subject: Radiator Fan revisited

Hey All,

I for one have had to replace the radiator ran resistor on my 86GL w/
AC.  When I went to my parts guy at VW he said he's seen alot of these
fail recently (it must be that time).  He also mentioned that he's seen
the fans go thereafter to the tune of $750.  Not that my fan needs
replacing but, is there an alternative fan (it's the high wattage one)
or fan motor swap out there?
