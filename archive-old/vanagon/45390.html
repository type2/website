Subject: RPT:  Inspection of Bob Hoover's Bus

Hi All,

Fellow NEATO guy, Pinkney Newell, and I met Bob Hoover and his Bus here 
in Kansas City last night.  He's helping a fellow list member with an 
engine for a Beck Spyder Kit car--*very* interesting.  There is a lot of 
time, knowledge, and effort going into the project.  Also very 
interesting is Bob Hoover and his Splittie Bus with the well-flanked gas 
tanks, impressive roof rack, and general road-worthiness!  8-)  He'll 
definitely be ready for the trip to the Arctic Circle!  He'll be around 
these parts for a few more days before heading back to California and I'm 
sure we'll hear more of his travels soon.  Happy VW-ing!  8-)
