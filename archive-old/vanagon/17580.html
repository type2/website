Apologies to sending this to the list, but direct mail bounced - something about host not found...

Marcus,
        I don't know if that 050 shouldn't be used in the 1600, but if
it's a dual-vacuum advance unit, I would be happy to trade you for an
009 that I have extra.  I bought it brand new and didn't like the part
throttle driveability, but it took me 3 years to find out that it was
the distributor!  :/  Anyway, I've been wanting to try out an 050 in
my bus (1800 T4)

&gt;  Which leads to some questions. This engine has a 050 dizzy fitted.
&gt;  Now Muir says this is a no no for this engine, as it dosn't retard
&gt;  #3. Has anyone run a 1600 with a 050? Any problems?
