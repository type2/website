&gt;I'm curious about the diesels. I don't notice much about them in the list
&gt;except in the context of a conversion. I currently own a Mercedes 300 turbo

&gt;diesel is anything like as strong and reliable.

 The '82 came in Diesel (watercooled) or Gasoline (air cooled). NuBus (mine) 
is an '82 Diesel. The engine has about 49 hp. At about 100k the orginal  
engine joined the choir-invisibule, and I had a used engine installed.
 
 I can cruise at 70 mph (not much more) in NuBus. At idle, the heat is 
marginal. It is  a little better at speed (I had to block-off the fresh air 
intakes for the winter)

Cetin Serin (&quot;Chetin&quot;) (cetin_at_kirk.bellcore_dot_com) has an '82 Diesel Westy.
I will test drive it today when we go visit him. NuBus is NOT a Westy.
(rumor has it there will be a surfeit of Busses at Cetin's today.)


I Like my diesel (but then again, my taste is suspect). It gets 30MPG, and
is my daily driver. (200 miles rountrip to work). I have spent money on 
it...Lots...but almost zero in the past year. 

It is the same engine as was put in the Rabbit/Dasher/Pickup, so it is a 
pretty good engine. Of course, putting it in a big bus is a real abuse
of the little sucker.
