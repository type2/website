Saw this in today's paper; it's the comic strip B.C.

First frame has a brontosaurus reclining at his psychiatrist's office.
He tells of a recurring dream that he has, where all he sees are letters
and numbers. So, the shrink asks what they are, and the dinosaur
replies &quot;10W - 30&quot;
:)
Anyway, just a bit of automotive humor...
