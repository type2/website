&gt;Know what I want? Package shelf. It's really the only thing I envy 
in
&gt;Splits except the swinging doors. The package shelf is useful, the 
space is
&gt;otherwise wasted, and no way could you do it in a front-engine. I 
will
&gt;never understand why they dropped it.
&gt;

It wa	s possible to get bus package shelves thru '79.  I had a '77 
with a pair of package shelves.  Got them off a '78 or '79 
Champaigne Edition bus that was in someone's backyard.  Also saw a 
pair on a '73 bus once.  Don't know what years they were available 
on, or whether they're genuine VW or aftermarket. You can still get 
replicas from Bus Boys, although they are somewhat expensive as I 
recall.
To second your opinion, I found them to be a great use of otherwise 
wasted space, and besides they kept the top of my dash clear of 
junk.
