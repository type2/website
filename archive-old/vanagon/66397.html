&gt;
&gt; Since the AL rear bumper is so weak as to give almost no protection at
&gt; all, and now minor taps have bent both ends and the end caps are off, &gt; I was thinking of installing a nice big board across the rear!  It &gt; would give more protection, and be cheap too!  Just a coupe of coats  &gt; of verithane or shelac.  What you all think?

Actually we followed a Vanagon thru Coos Bays Oregon that had such a
rear bumper and having just bought a new chrome one ($$$$$) I thought it
looked pretty good.
