&gt;Rick,
&gt;        Thanks for all of the great comments!  I'm glad to see that I at
&gt;least managed to find a *couple* of the good spots.  =)  I will redo that
&gt;portion of the trip based on your comments, and I'm sure it will be a
&gt;better trip for it.

Just to pipe in here, I definitely concur with Rick's suggestions.

Driving from Pt. Townsend to Bremerton and then back past Pt. Townsend
towards the coast (which if I remember correctly, was the plan) would be
kind of a bummer. And having spent large portions of my life in that area
(with grandparents in Poulsbo and Bremerton), I can say without a doubt,
Pt. Townsend would have been the highlight of the day.

Hang out in PT, check out the park, eat at the Fountain Cafe, then head for
the coast - certainly preferable to the dose of military/industrial decay
and late '80s suburban sprawl you'd have received otherwise.

And the Washington coast (La Push beaches 2&amp;3, Shi Shi Beach, Kalaloch) is
not to be missed.
