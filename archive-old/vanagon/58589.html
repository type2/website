Go the archives and seach on &quot;warranty&quot; under 1995. 
Actually, here is the search URL:

http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/headsearch?search=warranty&amp;a=v95&amp;Sea
rch=Search

Once you have the list of messages, scroll down until you find
the beginning of a long  &quot;$25,000 in Syncro Camper Repairs&quot; thread.

Read it all, and you'll realize that the Syncro's are not economy 
vehicles: but they are still great! 

No one, to my knowlege, went off after this thread appeared and sold
their Syncro. However,  I did buy a second one - so that like Derek Drew
I have one in my attic as well as one in the driveway. I think that is
the best way to
go!

Good luck,

Tom F.
