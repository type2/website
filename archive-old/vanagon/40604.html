Subject: PST John Tanner State Park Campout


Just a reminder that Peach State Transporters is having their Spring 
Campout at John Tanner State Park this weekend.  All buses and bus 
enthusiasts are encouraged to attend.

If you want to be in the caravan, we will be meeting at Lithia 
Automotive in Lithia Springs, Ga.  From Atlanta go west on I-20 and 
take the Lee Road exit (about the 3rd exit outside the perimeter 
(I-285)) and go right onto Lee Road.  About a mile or two down the 
road is Lithia Automotive on the left.  The sign may say Lithia 
Auto and Fiberglass, I can't remember (it's a VW dunebuggy shop).
We will meet there about 9:00 am Saturday morning and leave by 9:30.

John Tanner State Park is located off Highway 27 between Bremen and 
Carrolton, Ga.  From I-20 take the HWY 27 exit and go south toward 
Carrolton.  There will be a sign to take a right leading to the park.
The caravan should arrive between 10:30 and 11:00am.

Look forward to seeing you,

Dave
