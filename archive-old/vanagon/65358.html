&gt; I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be insured

&gt; about half of what it is for my '86 Jetta.  Many years ago, in
&gt; California, the requirements for RV insurance were that it had to have a
&gt; bed, a sink, and a stove.  Here in North Carolina, the agent just
&gt; processed the RV application without telling me the details.

Yeah, I heard about that, so I called my insurance company here in Texas
and they said, nope, it had to have tolet too.  So I called a local
Snake Farm office and was told that yes, they would insure it as an RV,
but only if I insured another car with them.  Ok, how about a quote
anyway?  Sure, $250 for 6 months, no collision.  Hmm.. I'm paying less
than that at my present insurance company (about $200).
