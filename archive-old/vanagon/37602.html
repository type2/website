Subject: RE: The last word on Audi (not)


&gt;Although there are still some other opinions, I believe that the
&gt;concensus is that the acceleration problems were attributed
&gt;to &quot;pedal misapplication&quot;, note that this occured only on the
&gt;automatic transmission cars. Audi's response was the auto trans
&gt;lockout, that required brakes on to get the transmission out
&gt;of park and into a forward or reverse gear. Once this lockout
&gt;was installed, the problem stopped, cold.  Thanks to the nature
&gt;of our modern society, today all new automatic cars have this lockout
&gt;feature.

The nature of society? Speak for yourself. I don't recall blaming
the car for a mistake the driver made. But I *do* recall getting blamed
for it, when the Fedrl Gummint decreed I had to pay for this trns/brake
interlock on my wife's 1994 Mazda, even tho neither she nor I have
ever done something as silly as hitting the gas when I meant to hit the
brakes.

Oddly enough, I also had to pay for the privelege of having the automatic
seat belts interfere with entry/exit into the car, even though all of us
have ALWAYS worn seat belts. Been doing it so long, it feels strange to
drive without them on. In fact, when I get into that car and the automatic
belt comes on, I feel that I'm now belted in... and sometimes forget to
fasten the lap belt! Yup, that's me being stupid, I admit. But I had this
problem solved until the Gummint &quot;helped&quot; me. I wonder how many others
have been similarly &quot;helped&quot; by this mechanical solution to a non-mechanical
(i.e. human) problem...

...end soapbox mode.
