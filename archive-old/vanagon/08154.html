&gt; To Ray and All--
&gt; First of all, I wish you Best Fortune in your family, Ray.
&gt; 

thanks for your thoughts and wishes, we plan on keeping a positive attitude.


&gt; secondly, there is something unique about this group.  Yes, the noise 
&gt; factor gets high at times and I'm as guilty as anyone.  However, I 
&gt; also belonged to another list that was vile and back-stabbing.  A 
&gt; continual show of knowledge and eliticism.  I left that one, although 
&gt; there was good info, because of the aggresive atmosphere.  
&gt; 

i agree that there is something special here. i have a friend involved in 
several groups and sometimes when i am at his place we talk about some of 
the messages he reads. i have to wonder what keeps people involved in 
those groups, especialy my friend who is a gentle and kind type of person.

&gt; Maybe it's that we've all stood the trial by fire in owning and 
&gt; loving our vans.  Maybe we're all a bunch of dried up flower 
&gt; children.  Maybe the cosmos just came together and we happened.  I 
&gt; dunno.  Whatever we are, I appreciate the people and supportive 
&gt; atmosphere too.
&gt; 

you might have something there. instead of imediatly dumping it off when 
we find that owning our van will involve real &quot;hands on&quot; participation, 
we not only do what needs to be done to keep our vehicles running, but we 
take pride in the fact taht we own a vehicle that needs constant 
mechanical attention.

of course, with this new eurovan that we have, it seems such a far cry 
from our old '68 bus that i think maybe a BMW emblam belongs where the VW 
emblam is now. sometimes i think about checking to see what it would take 
to swap emblams on the thing.
