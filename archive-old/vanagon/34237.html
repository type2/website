Subject: RE: head gaskets and time bombs

......... Had 'em checked for leakage 
back then and I'm keepin' an eye on 'em for any signs.

I just had a shop check out my engine and they said that there is evidence on
both sides of coolant fluid leaking and evaporating.  Their recommendation is
to just wait until it blows as long as I stay in the USA.  When I mentioned my
anual trip to a remote spot on Baja Coast they said definitly have the heads
done before going.  The engine is a 2.1 on my '86 Syncro Westy.  Any input is
appreciated as they quoted me from $800 to $2000 for the job.

Also someone said that if I yell at someone loud enough I may get VW to chip
in due to some class action suit.

I know that alot of this info is archived, but I am on a Mac with microsoft
mail and I can only send and recieve messages.  I have no gopher or prompt
function (I think).
