&gt; Just thought I'd share this with the other Eurovan owners/operators out 
&gt; there as well as any others who are interested.

	You got my attention...

&gt; I recently returned from another long road trip; approx. 3,000 miles.

	As did I. ~2000 miles.

&gt; It was a good trip, overall,...

	I had a great trip.  My EV is just a joy to drive. It just hums
along...

&gt; I kept a decent log of miles, fuel and etc. I used one quart of oil for the 
&gt; entire trip (more than what's normally there).

	I didn't use a drop.

&gt; I averaged 20 miles-per-gallon for the whole trip. For my Eurovan having 
&gt; 32,000 miles and under the stress-conditions, I'm STILL very happy with the 
&gt; Eurovan.

	I got a little over 20.  My EV's now got 26K and I'm still VERY
happy too.

&gt; I hope at 32,000 miles others can say the same.

	I'm counting on it.

BTW: Pete: Are you one of the 3 MDs on this list?  And what is &quot;ha.osd_dot_mil&quot;?
(Glad to know there's another EV somewhere nearby!)
