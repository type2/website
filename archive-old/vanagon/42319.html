Subject: temp gauge and airconditioner

I replaced the thermostat as suggested. The temp still stays at 
1/4.  What was the other cause that was mentioned?  I was told by 
the air conditioning specialist that the condenser is leaking and 
it can't be repaired.  If true, does anybody have a contact for a 
new one.  It's for an 86 syncro.  tia   Sherwin
