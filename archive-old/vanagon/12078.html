&gt; has anybody ever moved the battery? you'd have to redo some engine wiring,

&gt; have to do it... the vanagons already moved the battery inside! :)

 My friend (who still hasn't joined this list!?) converted his diesel to
gas and retained the stock airbox from the gas engine (I didn't, I'm using
a conical K&amp;N filter that lies at right angles to the battery), which he
bolted to the battery tray on the right hand side of the engine
compartment. So he had to move the battery up front, under the pass. seat.
I didn't pay much attention to the wiring mods, but I will have a look
this weekend when we get together and pretend we're mechanics.
