 When I bought my bus 4 years ago, it cost me 100 quid. It was a
 runner, empty inside and had a large dent in the middle panel.
 Sometimes I think its not got much better!

 A friend went out to Chamonix (French Alps) about three years
 ago, and got a 71 lhd, English registed bus from a German
 for 100$ US (How's that for cosmopolitan?). He drove the bus
 back to England, spent a fortune on MIG welders, compressers,
 angle grinders etc, took everything rotten of the bus and ...
 well thats as far as it got. Its been in a barn ever since.
