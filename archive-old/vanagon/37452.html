VanBondo sez:
Replacement size of the reduction plate bolts is the metric  1.5 x 50 x 35mm
length. Use matching sized thick wavy washers behind the bolts and torque
them down to spec. I know the size because I just had to replace them on the
'67 Westy Resto. Accidentily bought the 40mm length and they were too long.
Forget the lock-tite (in my opinion)! Just find the correct torque spec and
inspect them as you change the oil every three thousand or as needed.  I
paid about $.90 per bolt at PEPBOYS and saved many $$ and time in agony
trying to get broken bolts out of the reduction box.  I guess that if you
have been driving on loose bolts then they have been buggered and could
stand replacement. Do it right and do it once.
