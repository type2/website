Subject: the trip!!


OK, fellow breadloafs, bricks, etc:  we have a superleader among us!
David Schwarze &lt;schwarze_at_io.nosc_dot_mil&gt; of the this list has volunteered
to keep track of everyone's locations and the places they wish
to visit on this trip, and to plot a potential route and time plan.

Three cheers!  

I've happily turned over this to David, and have passed on any
mail pertaining to it I've already received, and will continue.  Have
offered to continue to help with this aspect in any way possible,
and we'll work together (system yet to be defined).  In the meantime,
you should send your locations and ideas and dreams of travel
fullfillment to David, since he'll send it back my way anyway
as we work on this.  

Soon, one of us will be posting a letter about needing further
specific input from all of you.  Watch for it!

Let's keep the interest going.  We had about 20 responses so
far, with a few new inquiries trickling in each day.  This
could be the start of something big.  Who knows, we might
end up on CNN, as PR for VWofA, in the mags, a book, a movie!
The possibilities are endless...
