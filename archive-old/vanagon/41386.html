Subject: 84 Westphalia for sale

Please excuse the bandwidth, but a net-impaired friend of mine is selling
his Westphalia.

The vehicle is in Vancouver, BC, Canada. It's an 84 with 120,000 km and very
clean. For more information please contact:

CALL MARK AT  (604) 522-5655
OR (604) 664-4408 (DAYS)

or email me privately (I'm not on the vanagon list) &amp; I'll forward the
specifics.

TIA,

- JL
