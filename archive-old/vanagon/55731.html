We have an 88 we have owned for 2 years that we need to sell.  Can't really
afford the insurance for a vehicle we haven't been able to use to its
potential in the past 6 months. It has 99k and is in good shape.  It is
maroon with a grey interior.  Everything works and it drives well.  It is a 4
speed.  We would like to get $8500 for it.
thanks, Brian and Nicole
