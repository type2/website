&gt;This is caused by the thick rubber gasket allowing coolant to seep
&gt;under it when under pressure.  This forms little pools of trapped coolant
&gt;and it is the concentration of ions and depleted oxygen that's causing
&gt;electrical gradients to form. This is referred to as CREVICE corrosion, and
&gt;any book on corrosion will cover it in detail. The book will also tell you
&gt;NEVER use compliant gaskets in a system subject to corrosion. Plain and
&gt;simple, VWs designer screwed up on this. They were mechanical engineers, not
&gt;corrosion types.

Thanks. That was fascinating.

Can you stop/minimize this by simply changing the gaskets out, say every
two years? How do some people get them to go 200K without maintaining them
where the others leak at 50K?
