Subject: Re: Keeping Warm


I like like to be warm and snug as much as the next person, and I'm the 
first to admit that the camper can get a might chilly when it's well 
below freezing, but I have one major concern with this packing-all-the-
interior-spaces-with-expanding-foam approach:

RUST.

Maybe this isn't even an issue in the arid, sunny, surfin' mecca of 
southern california, but I'm just sitting here looking out my window and 
watching some of the three inches of rain forecast for today pinging 
against the window pane.  Rust IS a problem here, and foam inside the 
doors would seem to allow water to become trapped inside, rusting them 
out before their time.  With no insulation it can get cold, but at least 
air can circulate and help dry out any accumulated moisture.

I'm not a rust-proofing expert, although I played one on T.V. once, so 
I'd be interested to see if I'm way off base on this one, or what.
