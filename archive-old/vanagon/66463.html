Mason Cowles asked about MXLs for EuroVans....

I bought a set of reinforced sidewall Michelin MXL 205/65R15 tires from NTW
for approx. $90 each earlier in the year.  These replaced the original
Goodyear G64 that wore very well (replaced at 49K) but had become quite noisy.
If you go with NTW (or whatever they're called now) you'll have to convince
them that a reinforced sidewall MXL exists, and also wait a few days for
them to order them.
