Subject:  looking for 87-newer westy

my brother is looking for an 87 or newer westy, as he thinks it is time to
move on from his rusty ol'  82 (which will be mine all mine for parts!). 
being unfamiliar with the wasserboxers, we are wondering what
people's experiences have shown with these - i.e., specific things we
can/should look for above and beyond the normal stuff.  any
suggestions?

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)

ps - he is in the los angeles area, any leads (manual trans only) would
be appreciated.
