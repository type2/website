&gt;        So far I've replaced:
&gt;
&gt;        master cylinder &amp; resvoir
&gt;        all 6 wheel cylinders
&gt;        all shoes (which need to be replaced again!)
&gt;        rubber brake lines on driver's side (passenger side looked new,
&gt;          driver's side look vintage '56!)
&gt;
&gt;        So I guess the next step is to replace the shoes, and the steel lines,
&gt;and possibly the rubber lines on the passenger side.
&gt;
&gt;        Any ideas, experiences would be helpful!

My immediate suspicion would be the rubber lines in the front. Mr. Bozo's
lines had aneurysms the size of lemons when I discovered them.  They held a
hell of a lot of brake fluid (the entire reservoir), and it takes a while
for the brake shoe springs to push all the fluid the hard way back through
the tiny hole in the master cylinder and hence back into the reservoir.

&gt;        I got canned from transamerica over the whole e-mail flap.  Not for
&gt;bus/vw email, but for catching my boss reading my e-mail.  If anyone wants
&gt;that story, I'd be happy to post it.

I'm curious. If the rest of the group doesn't want to hear about it (and
you've got time for the epic writing project) you can email it to me
direct...
