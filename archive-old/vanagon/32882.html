Subject: Re: Adjusting Pertronix Ignitor Dwell ('79 Bus)

...Cheese writes on monday:
&gt; With the Pertronix unit installed, the dwell meter reads a constant 59
&gt; degrees. I think that I want about 47 degrees or so.  The engine runs fine,
&gt; except that it idles at about 1200 RPM.  I've tried adjusting the &quot;air gap&quot;
&gt; between the ignition module and the magnetic rotor, in and out, with no
&gt; change in dwell.
&gt; The skimpy documentation that came with the unit explains only how to
&gt; install the unit.  It doesn't mention dwell adjustment or a number of other
&gt; obvious question...

...yep, noticed that, too. i installed my pertronix thing 6 months ago, and
i figured with the electronic ignition the dwell angle doesn't really have
the same meaning anymore, so i didn't worry...should i ??? bus runs
great...(73 westy).
                ciao,
