Subject: I guess you guys are right...


Well, as much as it pains me, I will keep looking for the elusive Westy. 
I really want one bad but the money I have to dish out (7500 dollars) is
really too much.  I guess I was in that &quot;GEE WHIZ&quot; phase when I looked at
the '83 diesel.  If anyone in the Frederick County, Maryland area has a
nice Westphalia van '83-'87 with all the trimmings pleeeeze sell it to me!
