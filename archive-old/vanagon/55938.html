We are selling our V.W. Camper. It is in great condition overall. It as
100K miles.

It has a built in Stove, Fridge, Cupboards and Tables. It sleeps 4 in
complete comfort. It is the V.W. Ivory color.

We have used the camper for many enjoyable camping trips but we now need a
second car for commuting as I have just graduated from college.

We think that $6K is a reasonable price, but we are open to offers.

Please contact Cara (or John) at (415) 738 6889 or email Cara at cquinn_at_best_dot_com
