Subject: Csmping Equipment Manual

Hello All.
		Could someone help me locate a manual for the camping equipment in my 
Westfalia.  I talked to someone two weeeks ago who said that he could copy the manual 
for me and mail it.  If anybody is in the position to copy a manual or sell one to me I 
would be very grateful and willing to pay.	
	Thanks....and thanks for the replies to my last questions about my oil leak and 
leaking faucet of the message with subject: &quot;My new '87 Syncro Westy&quot;.
