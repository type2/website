My motor came today so I am down to carbs and a clutch.  This would be
a stock 1600DP going into a '71 bus.  I have settled on Kadrons. 
I called Johnny's Speed &amp; Chrome because they have the lowest price I 
can find at about $270 with the alum manifolds.  So I called to verify
the price and make sure they are in stock.  They weren't in stock.  
Two weeks.  Then I asked the guy if they come jetted for a 1600.  He
kinda hesitates a little and says, &quot;You should be able to run them on 
that.&quot;  So, this has me nervous.  Berg's come jetted for the 1600 but 
he wants something like $360.  So I guess I have two questions, what 
size jets should I have in there?  They are only a few bucks so I will
probably just order them from Berg when I order a couple of other 
small things from him.  Final question, if anybody knows where I can 
get the carbs w/alum manifolds cheaper than $270 speak up now please. 
I guess that wasn't really a question.  Thanks, Jim
