I used pvc pipe on my '67 camper when the same thing happened to it.
I also put on a nice cover of rolled fiberglass insulation covered
with some plastic sheeting...

it was ugly...but it kept the frost off the window. I had a
Stewart warner heater in the '67, so I routed all of the
heat to the windshield ducts.
