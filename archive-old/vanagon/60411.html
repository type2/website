Subject: Re: Oil on the rear window!!!

Curt:
At the full mark the cam shaft is submerged in oil, the only source of
lubrication for the lobe-to-tappet surfaces. The shaft is ABOVE (out of)
 the oil at the low mark.
Good Luck

&gt;My '87 Syncro allows oil to leak out and show up on the rear window IF

&gt;At about 1/2 quart down from &quot;full&quot;,  it no longer leaks.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a common fix for this, or does everyone run 1/2 quart down?
