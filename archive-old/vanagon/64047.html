Subject: Re: Libelous Remarks (Long) (Was Re: Bus Boys Saga continues)

&gt; Dear Doug,
&gt; 
&gt;         It has again come to my attention via third party E-Mail in the
&gt; past 24 hours informing me of possible mis-information regarding my
&gt; status of past employment, association and the circumstances of my
&gt; termination of said association (at my request) at Bus Boys, Inc.
&gt; Information that has been provided to me by person(s) include
&gt; statement(s) of a derogatory matter of unconfirmed and unfounded
&gt; suspicions and accusations of what I feel are of an inflammatory and
&gt; libelous manner to the internet community as a whole and specifically to
&gt; wit:  The Type 2 Internet Mailing List and The Vanagon Internet Mailing
&gt; List, which could preclude my possible continued efforts to reactivate
&gt; and continue my own business, Sherwood Automotive/Old Volks Home or if I
&gt; so choose, the pursuit of gainful employment.
&gt; 
&gt;         I am securing permission from these person(s) to provide legal
&gt; documentation to confirm these conversations.  Such documentation will be
&gt; provided to my legal counsel for appropriate action, as necessary.  A
&gt; copy of one particular E-Mail tramission is supplied in Attachment #1 of
&gt; this letter.
&gt; 
&gt;         I must make it clear that if any unfounded accusations,
&gt; allegations, suspicions are spoken, written or otherwise transmitted to
&gt; friends, customers, potential customers and vendors by any employee of
&gt; Bus Boys, Inc., without my knowledge or permission and without
&gt; substantial proof, that the employee(s) of Bus Boys, Inc., involved, Bus
&gt; Boys, Inc., itself and you will be met with immediate legal action.  In
&gt; addition, I specifically request that retraction of the statement(s) made
&gt; to this person shown in Attachment #1 regarding my past association with
&gt; Bus Boys and must indicate that there are no confirmed instances of
&gt; fraud, theft or destruction of records of Bus Boys, Inc., until a full
&gt; investigation of the situation is concluded and an apology be made to the
&gt; Type 2 Internet Mailing List and the Vanagon Internet Mailing List as a
&gt; whole in regards to these inflammatory and libileous charges.
&gt; 
&gt;         A further note to this situation is that this is the second time
&gt; I have had unconfirmed alledged information regarding my past association
&gt; with Bus Boys.  On May 21, 1997, a letter was delivered, via fax to your
&gt; office regarding a similar situation and from appearances, that situation
&gt; was immediately attended to.  A copy of that original letter is on
&gt; Attachment 3, this letter.
&gt; 
&gt;         A copy of this letter has been provided to the person(s) who have
&gt; informed me of these circumstances, The Type 2 Internet Mailing List, The
&gt; Vanagon Internet Mailing List, my legal representation and to the local
&gt; labor relations board.
&gt; 
&gt;         Your immediate attention into this matter is requested and will
&gt; be certainly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt;                                                         Respectfully
&gt; Yours,
&gt; 
&gt; (Signed)
&gt; 
&gt;                                                         James E. Thompson

Jim,

Don't waste your time. Libel is not a cause for action in any of the 50
states. I think you wish this guy had slandered you. This is a cause of
action.

Steve B.
