Subject: heating water for westy camping trips
Date: Tue, 22 Apr 1997 11:44:39 -0400

Has anyone had experience using the H2O shower or other type of &quot;bags&quot; that
are supposed to heat water for showers while camping?  We were thinking of
using it by putting it the luggage area in front of the pop top and letting
the hose hang through the drivers window into the sink-when needed.  I'm
sure it would warm enough for washing hands but what about dishes?
