&gt;good question and I have no idea what the digest mode looks like because 
&gt;I've never been on it.  I imagine it is a concatenation of many emails 
&gt;that you receive less often.  But let's turn to a listee for the scoop.
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell us 
&gt;
&gt;(1) What does the digest mode do?

It delivers mailing list letters to you in groups rather than individually.
 That means that rather than getting 20 individual letters per day, you
might get one large one.


&gt;(b) how many emails are in a digest distribution? 5-10?

I varies by installation.  I have no idea what Gerry has it set to.
Usually you can deliver either when the digest reaches a specified size (in
bytes), or periodically, like every other day.


&gt;(iii)  how often are they delivered?  daily?  several times a day?

It varies by installation.  Only Gerry can answer this.


&gt;(4)  do you get everything?

Yes.


&gt;(4a)  how often is a digest distribution cut and emailed?

Again, ask Gerry.  Note that it's automatic.


&gt;(e) should digest mode be used when you are on vacation?

It's a matter of personal preference.  In My Humble Opinion, you should
temporarily unsubscribe when on vacation.
