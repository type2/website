&gt; does the above account for the slight rust I saw at the top of the 
&gt; motor?  I was hoping that an extended warranty would cover some of these 
&gt; things, if i put the 12k miles on it in a year, some tings would show 
&gt; up.  but i am concerned about buying from a dealer too.  hate it!
&gt; 

Believe me, that warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on.  The
dealer well ho-hum their way out of doing any fixes for you.  Fix
the rust, sure they'll probably buy a cheap bottle of spray paint
and spray it on, buff it a little, and tell you it's fixed.  I know
this sound cinical, but you've just *got* to get over your lust for
this vehicle and see the dealer for what he really wants.  Your money
and to be rid of this van.  

Your best bet is to keep looking until you find someone who has put
alot of investment into a van and is trying not to take too much of
a loss on it.  Believe me, a dealer will NEVER TAKE A LOSS ON ANY
VEHICLE.  Get away from the dealer and look some more.  That way
you will really get an idea of the value of these vans and what 
is a good price for them and what is not.
