Dropped by the Creator (Mahan VW, source of our three vans) last Thursday
and saw what appeared to be a shiny Vanagon on the used car lot.

When I looked more closely I saw that it was not a Vanagon, but a
Caravelle.  It seems that a VW rep who was in Germany had one custom made
for him to US emissions standards.  Eventually he shipped over here.
It looks very much like our '90 GL.  It is in verrry nice shape.

Details:
1989, power steering/brakes/windows (not locks); Alloy wheels; A/C; 72,000
miles; gold or bronze metallic paint; grey cloth (velour?) interior.
Asking $12,500US  713-527-1711

They also had a '93 Eurovan &quot;program&quot; car for $15,995US. All of the bells
and whistles.  36,000 miles.
