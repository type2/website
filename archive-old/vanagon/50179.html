 Hi y'all.... Somebody please help me... I've decided it's time to change
 coolant in my 89' Westy, and in every set of instructions,  it mentions that
 the front must be raised 40cm or about 16 inches in order to prevent air
 re-entering system on refill... WHEW!.  Now,  my question is.... how do you
 lift the front of the vehicle 16 inches without some very heavy duty, or
 costly jacking system?  The cost of letting the dealer flush the coolant
 system might be minimal compared to the cost of buying such a jack.

The 2.1 liter cooling system will bleed quite well with the van level.  With
engine cold, open t-stat bypass.  rev engine to 2500 rpm with radiator
bleeder open.  Keep engine at that speed until air is out of system and
pressure cap is back on the bottle.  This should also be done with both
heater valves open so the heater cores will also bleed.  A second person to
close the radiator bleeder is helpfull.
