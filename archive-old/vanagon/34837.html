Subject: Squeaky brakes

The brakes on my '77 westy squeak like crazy (the front brakes I believe).
The PO just had new rotors and pads installed and the pads still seem fine.
The brakes also work fine, so the squeak is more of an annoyance than anything
else.  Any ideas of the cause of the squeak?  Maybe crummy brake pads?

Also, I'm curious about the rpm's my 2liter is going at when travelling 55 mph
in 4th (assuming everything is running correctly).  If anyone out there has
installed a tachometer maybe you could give me an idea.

Thanks 
Brett
