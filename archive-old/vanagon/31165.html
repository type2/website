     &gt;Max undertook a complete rebuild of the engine, using a bottom end
     &gt;fully balanced by MacDonald Race Engineering and incorporating a
     &gt;heavy duty Melling oil pump. The cylinder heads were ported and
     &gt;polished by Max, fitted with big valves (40 mm inlet and 35.5 mm
     &gt;exhaust) and match-ported to the inlet manifolds. To pep up the
     &gt;performance still further an Eagle 120 cam was dropped into the case
     &gt;and this operates the valvegear via Type 4 solid tappets (in place of
     &gt;the standard hydraulic tappets), chrome moly pushrods and bolt-up
     &gt;rocker shafts. The engine is topped off with a pair of Dellorto 45
     &gt;DRLA twin-choke carbs, a Bosch 009 centrifugal advance distributor
     &gt;and a Bosch blue coil.

     Thanks, Kevin, this is very timely and sounds great. It is classic
     Hoover free HP technique, plus a little hot rodding. You can get a
     decent HP boost, without increasing displacement with new pistons,
     cylinders and a crank. On the other hand, if you do this stuff,
     AND increase displacement....

     Ahnendorp, incidently, said that his exhaust would not work on a
     syncro which makes me feel (a) sad, and (b) glad that he knows
     syncros.

     125 HP! that little Karmen Ghia must not know what hit it!
