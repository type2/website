&gt;In a message dated 95-10-22 23:22:14 EDT, you write:

&gt;&gt;but someone else (the only other person to call) offered $850. He then
&gt;&gt;proceeded to tell me that he liked me and my wife better than the other guy
&gt;&gt;so he would rather it go to us.

&gt;Whattaya think, folks?  Did they reel him in fast, or did he put up a fight?
&gt; I think it's that dreaded disease, NBS (&quot;New&quot; Bus Syndrome) - we've all been
&gt;there, haven't we? ;-)


I reply:

Actually I tried to put up a fight, but my wife nipped that in the bud right
away.  My initial offer was going to be $650, with a max of $800. Both my wife
and her father said I was lowballing him, and I needed to go higher. They said
$800 initial offer with a max of $900, I said no way. We agreed on $750, with
a max of $850.  With all this great negotiating going on the seller was not a
negotiator.  I said $750, he stuttered, and stammered, and said I'll get back
to you tomorrow. Next day, I call him leave a message stating I am still
interested, call. He calls gives me story about other caller.  I then explain
to him what negotiating is all about. He says I couldn't sell seeds to a
farmer(or something similar). So instead of staying on the phone all day
trying to get a price out of him I say $850, and I picked it up.

Though I did feel a bit of the NBS kick in 8-D
