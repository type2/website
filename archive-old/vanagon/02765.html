&gt; the 95 has a full camper version with the camper part done by
&gt; Winebego. I got the mailing last week and went and saw one in Fremont, CA.
&gt; 
&gt; It was dirty from the trip and not ready for a drive. For over 30K, I'll
&gt; stick to my 82.

I wonder why _anyone_ would buy a VW Eurovan camper for over $30K, since
you can buy an RV with shower,  microwave, tv, etc., for about the same
price (mid- 30s).  What market is VW/Winny trying to hit, anyway?
