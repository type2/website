Subject:  Re: Pros and Cons: Eurovan Camper, '95 &amp; '96


&gt; I test drove a 96 Eurovan Camper last night and am seriously considering a
&gt; purchase within a week or so. As part of the pre-purchase research, I welcome
&gt; comments from current owners.

	Are you sure it was a 96?  I understood that only a handful were
being imported and none would be for sale to the general public.  I just
bought a brand new 95 (w/ 28 miles)
  
&gt; It would be my primary vehicle as well as my camper. I'm not a power demon, and
&gt; the V-4 seemed OK. (Though rumor has it that a V-6 is in the offing for later
&gt; this year.)

	My 93 was the in-line 5 cyl, as is my new 95.  The 97s are supposed
to offer the VR6 as an option.
  
&gt; Price being flung about is $32K. This, of course, includes the Winnebago
&gt; conversion.

	That's sticker price.
  
&gt; Are you happy with your Eurovan Campers?  Do they suffer from the electrical
&gt; problems that seems to have plagued earlier Eurovans (info from Consumer
&gt; Reports)? 

	Never heard of electrical problems.
