I talked to Jonah this AM, and he has 70 messages so far.  He was
kinda surprised - he never gets that much mail.

But I think we can do much better than that:  we have ~300 people
on the VintagVW list and I don't know how many on the vanagon list!

All we need is a simple letter expressing your interest in such
a product for early air-cooled VW's, and what kind of VW's
you have.

Thanks!
