Subject: /f: Groundhogs &amp; Lurkers

With the stats being published today, it reminded me that lurkers on the
list are kind of like groundhogs. That is, they're seldom seen. Every now
and then, one pokes its head out from under the bus, hoping to get
attention, in part by proclaiming &quot;Hey, look at me! I'm one of your
lurkers! Pay attention!&quot; 

We hear about groundhogs once a year. Partly in jest, partly in hope-
against-hope, we look to them to predict how much longer winter will last. 

I wonder why we don't have a Lurkers Day. We could watch for lurkers to
poke their heads out of their holes and if one sees it's shadow, we'd know
the network connection would be up for another day (that is, for all of
us but Tom Forhan, of course). Or, if a lurker came out of hiding with a
question that was kindof new to the list, we'd know our buses would run
trouble-free for the rest of the week! 

Groundhogs are fat, furry, and shy. They're cute and we like them. I 
think most of the vanagon list members like lurkers too. I know I do; 
without them, who would I tease today?
