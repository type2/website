Subject: Re: Midas or not

In a message dated 95-11-01 19:34:41 EST, you write:

&gt;I had a Saab that I took to Midas shops in three different states.
&gt;Workmanship at all three places, was lousy-- burring left on sawed-off
&gt;pipes, clamps where they should have welded (lowest part of the car,
&gt;didn't take long to knock it off), leaking joints.
&gt;
&gt;
I had an '84 Jetta for which I let Midas replace the muffler.  Same problem
with the pipes that you had, Steve.  Also, after charging me an arm and a leg
for replacing the CV joint boots, a year later I had to replace it again
(substandard parts).

I'll never go there again.

Cliff
