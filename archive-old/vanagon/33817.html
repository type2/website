Hitting Mexico again after spending a month last year down in Baja in a '93 EV
camper.  This time down the west coast to areas around Mexico City. Leaving San
Diego on Feb 19 to Tuscan and then into Mexico.  Returning via Laredo on Mar
20.

Wouldn't mind travelling in convoy with anyone who will be in this circuit at
these dates.  Have lived in Mexico City during 1965-68.
