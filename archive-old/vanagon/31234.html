Subject: Sharan Sighting


I saw the VW Sharan van the first time today while driving
to Bemidji, Minnesota.  It was with several Golf III's and what
I thought was a VW Polo.  I wouldn't doubt if at least one of
those Golf III's had the new Turbo Direct Injection (TDI) diesel
engines.  Who knows, maybe even the Sharan had a TDI
engine.

Just once, I'd like to see these test vehicles closer up and
standing still.
