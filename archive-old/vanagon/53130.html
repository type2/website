Jaime--

As long as your brakes are working, it's probably your brake relay. 
It's a fairly inexpensive little gizmo behind the dash that tells your
lights to light.  Dealer replaced mine, seems like part was around
$20--don't remember exactly.  Don't know about labor, dealer didn't
charge me because it took them 6 hours to do (while I was waiting--long
story).

Hope this helps,
Tonya
