Subject: Re: Wiper Motor???

corbin,

the easiet way to remove the wiper motor is to undo the wipers off the
shafts and remove the bolts securing the wiper assembly in. Secondly just
remove the metal tray from under from your dash and take the wiper out.
there is only one bolt that holds the wiper assembly in as far as i recall.
remove that and the whole assembly comes out. have no leads

&gt;I need to R&amp;R the wiper motor in my split window bus.
&gt;Could someone briefly describe this proceedure?
&gt;
&gt;It looks like its buried up against the front wall,  Must I remove the
&gt;dash assembly or is there another way? (I suppose cutting a hole in the
&gt;front exterior is another way :(    )
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible to &quot;rewind&quot; this motor once it is out (1965, assuming it is
&gt;something simple)?
&gt;What are the chances of finding another?
&gt;New?
&gt;Used?
&gt;Cost?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Corbin
