Since this thread has turned into a symposium on tailgators...

Last week some guys SHOT and killed, on the freeway, in rush hour traffic, a 
guy who stomped on the brakes to get them off his butt.

Their lawyer is saying &quot;He only brought the gun out to intimidate him,
and then it 'discharged'&quot;

That's the same defense the old lady that shot the heretofore unknown 
Mexican pop singer is also claiming.

That should be a mandatory &quot;chair&quot; offense.
