Subject: St Muir, worth anything (literally)
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 95 20:49:49 EDT

     Now I don't want to discuss the merits or demerits of the
book but fact is after 1 bug and now on my 5th bay window
bus, I have never owned a copy of the Idiots Guide, never
considering myself an idiot (some opinions will vary, see
owning 5 Buses) I always followed the Bentley manuals
religiously.
     Anyway the point is, I'm rifling through the used
book store where I picked up my mint Bentley late Bug manual
for $2.50 and just in is a pretty old St. Muir, 1970 to
be exact, not the first but early on all the same I guess.
Origional price on the bumper is $5.50, I figure hell, be
good to assimilate the information for entertainment if nothing
else, even though this early one don't even dream about Type IV
engines, so I open it up !!!! $20 !!!!! they want, I'm like
hell I can buy the current one for that.  And it's not in
perfect shape, complete and clean but a bunch of staples
through the cover, and valve gaps written inside the back.
    Are they NUTS? do these things have any value?, would
offering $5 for it be insulting?, I asked the lady and she
says, well I don't price em this other lady does, and it
might be collectible, and blah, blah, blah.

Seeking opinions,
