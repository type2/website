Subject: Re:cost of restoring '67

All,
	I bought my '67 11 years ago and it was a bondo covered, not great 
looking bus.  Today it looks exactly the same!  I think that I've gotten 
my $700 out of it.  Here in New Zealand I bought a near mint '66 
Westfalia for $US 2,500.  70,000 original miles from the original 
owner...  I'd been looking for one like it for years.  Worth the wait.
