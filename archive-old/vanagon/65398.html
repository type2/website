Subject:      Insurance update

     My company (USAA) reports that their rates are based on
     industry-reported &quot;risk&quot; categories for like makes and like or similar
     models as cross-referenced by the VIN.

     Consequently, in my case at least, there is no &quot;RV&quot; status - my car is
     simply lumped with all other Westfalias for risk assessment.

     So, you Westfalia owners out there: Drive safely (and keep it safely
     locked up) - I'm gonna be mad if my rates go up!
