Subject: Great News!~No sucked valve~83Westy

The anticipated major repair bill was miniscule compared to the &quot;Sucked
Valve&quot; scare. The mechanic stated that it was a collapsed lifter. Repair
bill ended up at $80.80 and a case of Dr. Pepper (seeing as the mechanic
doesn't drink beer).
Quick &lt;frantic&gt;  research revealed:

RIMCO (Santa Ana, California)
$350-400. per pair of heads to bead blast, inspect, weld cracks, machining,
replace the seats and guides plus shipping and associated time delay.
Estimated one normal work week labor time plus shipping time each way.
*Then add labor and time/money to dress the heads and reinstall.

VWOA (Chapman/Scottsdale)
$708.00 each for new German BARE heads (special order item)
or $566.00 each for same with &quot;nice guy discount.&quot;
For R&amp;R of exisiting heads:
$540.00 labor
$300. for gasket set
$???.?? for machining etc.
Estimated $1,100.00 minimum for the total!

Yea! So much for  &quot;St. Pon&quot; and the Kharmic Ten Millimeter Meditation crew. 

&quot;Hari, Hari Khrisna,
Khrisna, Khrisna,
Hari Rama, 
Rama, Rama,
Hari Vishnu...&quot; 
(the St. Pon chant)

Thanks everybody! 
For penance I promise not to be a smart *** for a day.
