&gt; 
&gt; This morning topped it off...
&gt; 
&gt;   As still a &quot;rookie&quot; owner, I have been learning more and more
&gt; about NuBus' ('82) affect on other drivers. IT DRIVES THEM INSAAAANNEE.
&gt; 
&gt;   I live in the dairy country outside of Syracuse NY, so I drive
&gt; country roads most of the time. I have noticed that people cannot
&gt; stand to be behind me, no matter how fast I go. 
&gt; 
	
	Oh Yeah! How many times I've waited for someone behind me to bump
	into me between 1st and 2nd!!! Hah! But for me it's not only
	when I'm in Ruby ('91 Camper). I also go slow in Workar ('93 Escort)
	too. It's those assholes with automatics. They live in a push-button
	world. I'm the same way sometimes when I'm running around Portland (OR)
	in a company cruiser ('94 Sable wagon). I hate what those cars bring
	out in me.

	I always keep the rear curtains closed in Ruby and I removed the rear-
	view in Workar. 

	Everytime I have a close encounter, I fantasize about that bumper-
	sticker I've wanted to make:

		&quot;If you're in a rush, you've clearly made a tactical error
		 getting behind me. Have a nice day.&quot;
