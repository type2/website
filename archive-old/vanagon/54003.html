I also heard of this problem happening on Saabs.  I once heard of someone   
who actually drilled a couple of holes into the starter core.   
 Apparently, the Saab engine generate a great deal of heat and those   
holes act as vents.  I think it's weird but it supposedly worked.

&gt; Just a short addition to Nate's comments:
&gt; I've had this same problem with a 1980 Saab (not yet with our 1986
&gt; syncro westy) and I got good results by lubricating the starter shaft
&gt; and bendix gear (the gear that engages the flywheel). I used kerosene   
as
&gt; a lubricant and sprayed it on.
