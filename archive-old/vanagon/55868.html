Subject: Re: ECU Recall?

While the information at automatrix is invaluable, I would trust the
Nat. Highway &amp; Safety people's website more when it comes to recalls. 
You can go there and get the exact information by searching under the
model year, manufacturer, model and system (fuel, body, AC, etc).  You
can leave the system information out to see all the recalls for that
model.  Vanagons fall under VW Trucks as the manufacturer since they
were imported as trucks to forgo various regulations.  If there was a
recall, and VWoA isn't helpful, the NHST people will more than gladly
step in to assist.  After all, they are the ones that really insist on
the recalls anyway.

I haven't searched under 86, but there were no recalls listed on 87
Vanagons in regards to the ECU, sorry.  They do give you access to
Technical bulletin information as well, so maybe you can get more info
there.
