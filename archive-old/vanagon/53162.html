Thanks to the dozen or so of you who responded to my query about 97 EV's.
It looks like the consensus is that the sightings are all of campers and
that the non-camper EV has yet to be imported. The only exception might
be Rick's Seattle Times classified listings which look like campers to
me from a distance but which I was not able to confirm because the ad
was too old to be listed on their webpage.

Let's keep these sightings and related info as a kind of continuing search
until we know one way or the other what VW is planning to do.
