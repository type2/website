Subject: A question from a clueless person...


Hello all.  In a few weeks, I'm going to get my 66 bus and bring it 
home.  I wanted to know about the deal with swingaxle to IRS 
conversions.  The conversions I have read about remove the gear boxes and 
I wanted to know if this puts undue strain on the engine since your take 
away the mechanical advantage for the engine.  Or am I simply missing 
something?  Is the tranny simply geared down to compensate or what?  
Thanks for the info.  If this in a FAQ. just tell me in private e-mail 
and I'll look for it myself.  Thanks guys and gals!
