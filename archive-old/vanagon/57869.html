Subject: RE: 87 Wolfs. Power Door Locks.


Hello,

A friend of mine also has the 87 Wolfsburg van with power door locks and he
removed the driver side lock motor because something went wrong with it and
caused all of the other locks to continuously cycle up and down. Of course,
this was 1 hour before we were taking his van on a road trip.

The replacement motor is around $115 and he is still in a holding pattern
hoping to be able to diagnose the motor problem and fix it.
