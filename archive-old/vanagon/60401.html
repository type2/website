I've installed the floor boards from a wrecked '90 syncro into my friends 
'82 westy. About a 3 hour job, the nuts are allready welded onto the 
underside of the van (only a couple of holes needed to be drilled 
through the floor to access two of the nuts. These floor boards allow you 
to easily install the &quot;third&quot; seat.
