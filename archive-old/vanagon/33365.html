Subject: Re: Need help on '86 Idle Ad

                      RE&gt;Need help on '86 Idle Adjustment          1/21/96

The dealership told me that the sensitivity of the idle 
control valve is not tunable, but yet it runs anywhere from 1400 to 1900 
RPM when it's plugged in (and no extra load). Can anyone shed any light 
on this puzzle? Thanks in advance for your help! 

--------------------------
&quot;Well, not exactly . . .&quot;

Assuming (Yeah, nasty word , I know) that this is similar to the Bosch system
used by BMW (Motronic), there is a small adjustment screw on the Idle Control
Valve (ICV) that is used to set the current draw to spec.  In so doing, it
does have a minor effect on the idle speed.

However, if your idle is 1400 -1900 RPM, that adjustment screw isn't going to
do it.  Since the ICV is new the next thing I'd look at is the Idle Control
Unit (ICU)that provides the control signal to the ICV.  Is the ICV getting
power?  You should feel it vibrate if it is getting power from the ICU. 
Typical power from the ICU is a string of pulses that is either varying in
frequency or pulse width to vary the effective opening of the ICV.  Is the
current going to the ICV from the ICU in spec?  You will probably need a scope
to see this.

Beyond the ICU/V components - 
1)  is the cold start valve stuck open?  Also Check the thermo/time switch
that cotroles it.
2)   I think that you may also have a temperature switch that sits in the
water jacket and either opens or closes when the water temp. hits around 120
degrees F to tell the computer to slow the idle down as the engine warms up.  
3)  does your temperature gauge on the dash work up and is it hooked up to the
correct sender  (and any other wires that are supposed to be hooked up there
too)?  On my Motronic set up, the temperature sender that feeds the dash temp
gauge also feeds the engine computer.

Because this topic seems to pop up as frequently here as it does on the BMW
list (where it has apparently long been the frequent topic of much discussion,
frustration, technical exchange, etc) and because I think that both the VW
system and BMW systems are if not essentially the same, verrrrrrrry close, I
am enclosing a FAQ from that list about idle problems.  I've had some problems
in this area myself with my Motronic system, and at least in theory believe I
have a reasonable understanding of how the system is intended to work.  Note
well that I said &quot;in theory&quot; because I fortunately haven't had to fight mine
much past a so far one time replacement of the ICV.

Feel free to ask further questions that I will try to answer as best I can, or
perhaps refer to other resources.
