Subject: Generator fixed for now,but how to do the brushes

I  repolarised my generator for the third time and tried to replace the
brushes.
The top brush is accessible but I could not get to the screw on the bottom
one, Maybe I need to work with a mirror and a smaller set of hands!!!
Can you rotate the generator in its housing without taking off the fan
housing??
Has anyone replaced brushes in situ and how did they do it.

ps It works fine for now with one new brush in the top!!!!
How long I do not know
