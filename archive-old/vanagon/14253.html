&gt; Long article that I posted about this would be in the archives.  Rest of my
&gt; scanty knowledge is that when you lean the Rabbit engine over like a diesel
&gt; you have to cut the body a little or use a Dasher intake manifold.  Some-
&gt; one else has to help you choose an appropriate donor engine; all I know is
&gt; bigger is better.

With my '92 1800 Jetta into 82 diesel vanagon, there was minimal bodywork.
Only an approx 3&quot; diameter area needed dishing out on the lefthand side
of the engine bay.
If I had to do it over, I would try for a 2.0l. Probably a bored/stroked
92 digifant rather than the 2.0 l that is in the 94.95 golf/jetta, just
because the newer engine has a crossflow head and may pose more
installation problems
