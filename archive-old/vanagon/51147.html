Hotch;
The socket I used is 1 13/16 inch with 3/4 inch drive and 1/2 inch drive
reducer. I picked it up twenty years ago at a tool discount store.
Recently I purchased an Empi tool that works much better. It is an
oblong piece of metal that fits over the nut and you give it a few hits
with a five pound sledge and presto! it spins off.
Good Luck
