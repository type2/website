Subject: New Item Available Late July 96

I've been wanting to post this to the list for some time, but I didn't wanna
do it until I checked a jillion times the fit, construction, materials, etc.

REAR SNAP-ON HATCH SCREENS

That's right.  For Buses &amp; Vanagons in either Brown Vinyl w/White Screen and
Grey Vinyl w/Grey Screen.  These are an exact duplicate of the originals that
VW wants waaaaaaayyyyyy too much for.

One thing that held up this project was trying to find the closest White
Mosquito Screening for the Brown Vinyl.  The Grey screening just didn't look
right (And I want it to be RIGHT!) when mixed with the Brown Vinyl.  The
quality and weight of the Vinyl is just a hair heavier than the original
(compared it with mine out of an 84 Westy,) but the fit and finish is
excellent as the pattern(s) have been virtually duplicated.  Comes complete
with extra snaps to install on the body for Non-Westies.  Snaps on Vinyl are
Chrome, not painted.  Available in late July 96 - production starting on
Vanagon Screens next week, Bus ones a little later this summer as soon as I
approve the production piece, not just the prototype. (Besides I wanna try
the 68-79 Screen in my 67 Deluxe to see if it will fit there too.)

P/N 231-069-602   68-79 Models (Brown Only)  $69.95 (VAG No Longer Available)
P/N 253-069-602   80-87 Models (Brown)  $69.95 (VAG Price $237.65)
P/N 255-070-412   86-91 Models (Grey)  $69.95 (VAG Price $167.40)

Note:  Vanagon Non-Westies had a screen available too. VAG 255-862-771
(Grey).  This has been superseded to the 255-070-412 above at VAG (Last
posted price on these was in the $250 range) .  Why the VAG price discrepancy
between Brown and Grey is beyond me - they're identical except for the color.

I know Ernie down at the Poptop Kanvas place in Texas has been makin' some of
these for awhile.  But I didn't care about the cut or the vinyl fabric being
used (some customers have told me the same), so I think I've come up with a
better, original screen.  I looked at the possibility of attachments at the
bottom (due to previous list postings on this matter), but I wanted to go for
originality as much as possible on this one.  I just might work on a slightly
modified one if there's enough requests for it - I gotta make a lotta these
in each product run I schedule to keep the price down.  Of course V_at_L members
get 10% OFF ($62.96)

Thanks for the bandwith :-)
