So Martha says:
&gt; /martha
&gt; 
&gt; p.s. - the next day, Sunday, the 28th, Gerry will be in the Sacramento
&gt; area, and Steve and Linda Johnson will be coordinating an event for
&gt; Gerry and his family there, beginning also at 5 p.m.  If my job is over
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^??????!!!!!!

AAAACCCK!!!!  Please keep in mind people, that both Linda and I have
to work the next day.  I was actually thinking an afternoon BBQ.  I
figure most of you need to go to work as well.  Well probably have
chicken and/or burgers.  I'd like to get a head count of who will be
coming to the Sacto get together so I can plan accordingly.  If you
do plan to come, please bring a side dish and your preferred alcholic
beverage.  Or maybe Alka-Selzer will be the preferred drink by then. ;)

Marth, if this is a problem, let me know.  

Cheers!
