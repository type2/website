Subject: Fritz get $5100!!

Well I got my settlement cheque from ICBC today.  They gave me $5300 for Fritz 
(minus $200 deductible).  It seems they were not able to find any late-70's 
Westy's for sale in the Lower Mainland  so I didn't have too hard a time talking 
the guy up from the $1750 that the Auto Estimator company said it was worth.  
The fact that I had found a couple Westy's for sale at ridiculously large prices 
helped too.

So, I guess I'll have to change my signature.  Hopefully tomorrow I'll be buying 
Lief (77 Westy with no rust, excellent paint, propane stove, electric fridge, 
sink, great interior).

Laughing in Vancouver,
Glen
