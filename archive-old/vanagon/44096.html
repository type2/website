Subject:       1966 Split Rebuild

I have just about completed the restoration of my 1966 Split Screen 
Camper and I am now at the stage of getting the engine running and 
back into the camper.

Am I best to try and bench test the engine before I refit it, and if 
so what is the procedure for doing this.

I would appreciate any help that you could give me on getting my now 
solid and rust-free split back on the road.

Cheers
