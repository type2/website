Subject: Buying parts on the Internet...


&gt;Can anyone on the list explain the protocol on buying used parts over the
&gt;internet? I have had good luck in the past buying a gas heater from Bill
&gt;Kennedy, an exhaust manifold from Mike Catlin, the listserv tshirt and vent
&gt;cap from Steve Johnson. My understanding is that it is normal for the
&gt;purchaser to  receive the used product prior to payment. Is this correct?

By convention, things bought from private parties over the Internet are
shipped UPS COD. This is the most even-handed way to go about it.

But I would send either money or parts to many of the people on this list
on faith.
