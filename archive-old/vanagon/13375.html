&gt;And Tim S. responded with:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;We put in an anchor high up in the rear corner, by removing the engine air 
&gt;&gt;grill then drilling through the tin. I bought a mounting kit, Canadian
&gt;&gt;Tire, 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Umm, excuse me if I've missed something here, but doesn't the rear bench
&gt;have lap belts?  On the rear facing childseat that we have, we just cinch


Yes, but Canadian  law requires that forward facing childseats have an 
additional tether strap from near the top of the seat back to an anchor 
point in the car. Car seats sold in USA don't include this strap, Cdn ones 
do. Keeps the kid from putting his face into his colouring book at high 
speed, should the seat pivot forward in a crash.    tim s.
