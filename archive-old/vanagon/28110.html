Hi, all you wanna-more-hp Vanagon Junkies.

I know of a wrecked Volvo 740 Turbo Diesel
with the six cylinder VW engine so I called and
asked the dealer/junk yard to measure the engine
length.  They measured 28&quot; from the rear of the
block to the front of the timing belt cover.  This was
measured at the top.  The measurement at the bottom
is 1&quot; less.

I did some measuring on my '87 Syncro and I can't see
how an engine of this length could fit without making
major sheet metal modifications at the rear.

Does anybody else have any comments about fitting
a six VW/Volvo TD engine in a Vanagon ?
