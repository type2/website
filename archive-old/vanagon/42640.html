Chris,
What is &quot;thrust angle alignment&quot;?

Thanks.

Bearing in mind, I'm no mechanic, and I might have gotten my butt ripped 
off at Midas on this, but here's how they described to me.  Pretty much all 
vehicles require a front wheel alignment.  It makes sure the front wheels 
are heading directly down the street, among other things.

The thrust angle alignment, I'm told, assures that the rear wheels are 
properly aligned with the front wheels, thus
( supposedly ) eliminating any stresses generated when the front wheels are 
pointing in one direction, and the rear are slightly off from that.

If I'm wrong, &quot;Somebody SSSSSsstop mehhhh!&quot;
