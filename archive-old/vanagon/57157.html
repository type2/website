I always burned Chevron Premium in my '91 Westy. But, one time I had to put
87 octane fuel in it, not being particularly concerned about it.

Driving home to Portland, OR from Vancouver, WA everyday, I got used to the
gears needed at various points on the trip.

One day I was climbing the gentle, multi-mile grade out of the Columbia
River valley when I suddenly realized I was in the usual left lane but I
was losing speed. I had this sudden sickening feeling. Oh, Gawd! What's
wrong?!

Within a few seconds I remembered I had put Regular fuel in it. Ruby just
didn't have the explosive power it usually did so I had to move to the the
middle lane.

It ran just as smooth as it did with 91 fuel, just without as much torque.
