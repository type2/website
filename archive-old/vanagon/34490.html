Subject: VWoA Web site

I was just doing a bit of Netscape surfing and went to the VW web page.  I
had only
been there breifly back when the Rolling Stone ad (regarding Jerry's death)
was put on it.  Anyway, I checked out the shots of the Concept 1 (looks like
a more normal car than the original prototype :(

Anyway, they asked for comments on improving the site so here's what I left
them:


I'd like to be able to look up details about the VW's 
I own.  For example I just bought our '86 Golf diesel
to replace my tired old '75 Rabbit.  Having also owned
an '80 convertible, I know Rabbits but I don't know
squat about diesels and Golfs.  How about being able 
to look up owners manual information on things like
cold starting and driving technique so I don't blow
this thing up and have negative thoughts?

How about being able to find my '79 Westy's birthday?

How about having e-mail exchange with knowlegable techs
so that I can maintain my cars into the next century?

How about microfish shots so I can call the dealer with
part numbers instead of a hopeless description of some 
weird rubber hose.

Why am I treated like an alien visitor when I drive an
air cooled car to a dealer? I own more VW's than anyone
who works there, in fact it's all I drive.  You would 
think they'd be happy to see me, and show me the new 
steel.  I may not have 25 grand for a new Eurovan, but
VW's roll down hill and I'll own one eventually.  I'm 
also getting older and making more money.  Please don't
alienate owners of older VW's.
