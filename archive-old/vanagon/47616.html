&gt;Well, this is some interesting stuff. It looks problematic for Syncros.
&gt;Here are some of my quick observations:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;1 complete exhaust system without catalyst (which is not yet

&gt;
&gt;Well, it sure is here!

Kits including catalysts are under development and will follow end of this 
year. I suggest, those will be European style parts, but also driven by O 2 
sensors. Hopefully this will meet your requirements.

Take a look on the Ford V6 2.9L engine. It will include a regulated cat. 
converter. The Ford kits will have the muffler right and left beside the 
engine, going straight to the vehicles end, but yet I do not know were the 
converters are sitting exactly. Additional information I will get end of 
next week from Winkler. Maybe this will fit the Syncros protective bash 
rails. Do you know the Scorpio? This engine may go into your Vanagon!
