HA!  RIDE ON!! Someone else with enough brains to get out of the bike biz
AND put some lube on the lug bolts; ya done good, Stuart!  ;-)

I agree with what everyone's been saying on this topic; though Mike B. didn't
state in his original post, I'd be willing to bet that all the lug bolts were
bone dry (from the factory).  That's how our EV's was, as well as the A2 Jetta 
and A1 GTI before it.  Nothing that a dab of grease or anti-seize won't take 
care of (hey, Stuart, I still use Phil Wood grease!...).

Oh, and that other helpful hint about the cheater bar (say, three feet, or so),
also a very good idea; judging by the threads I've read the past half year or
so,
not only does it give you more leverage to change your flat tire, but, it
will also do the following:

1) crush the begeezus out of pesky little meeses that invade your bus

2) ditto above, except sub neighborhood miscreants for meeses

3) temporarily hold a mob at bay any time you're visiting South Central L.A.
and they announce yet another Rodney King decision

4) would probably have greater effect on Ric and Steven's collective heads
than if Martha klonks them with a cell phone.  ;-)  ;-)
