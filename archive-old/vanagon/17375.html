Subject:      Chasing the Unknowns Again (groan) ...

ok. pleading and threats didn't do any good, so i'm gonna have to fulfill
my promises of dire consequences here!!! all you Unknowns (meaning i don't
know what year/model bus you drive) have some choices:

- tell me directly (you don't have to reply to the whole list ... and that's
   a u-a-ONE-v-m in my email address: jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu) what year and
   model (camper, single-cab pickup, adventurewagen, dormobile, etc.) or
   modelS (you lucky devil, you!) you have. doesn't matter if it's running
   or not. as long as it's yours.

- tell me directily (etcl) that you are a Wanabus (meaning: you plan on
   buying a bus sometime in the next 20 years and are simply USING the rest
   of us shamelessly to gather information toward that end).

- ignore this. in which case, i'll probably do this again in a month or so. :)
  you don't HAVE to tell me anything, but i would appreciate it ... it soothes
  my sense of &quot;lookit all that data out there!!!&quot;

now. what happens to the info you give me? well, it goes into a little dippy
file on a big ibm, and every friday, i make up the Weakly Stats and send it
out to the vanagon/bus mailing list. what else? well, that's about it.

the ONLY people that have access to it are the folks on this list, and ONLY
if i send it to them. sometimes folks want to know who the others are in their
state or city, and i send that out.

so let's get them fingers fleetly flying across those klackity keyboards and
at least lower the number of Unknowns down below the level of the Microbus
population.

and we thank you for your support.
joel
