&gt;&gt;Here's another question. I just installed a stereo in my Vanagon. Planning
&gt;&gt;on doing some camping. I'll want to listen to the radio while I'm sitting
&gt;&gt;around reading. The only way to get the stereo to play is to turn the
&gt;&gt;ignition to on. At that point all the lights on the dash are on. Is it ok
to
&gt;&gt;leave the key in this position for extended periods of time, or will I need
&gt;&gt;to rewire my stereo to make it hot all the time?
&gt;&gt;

Wire it hot all the time.  If radio has a clock that is contolled with the
ignition, you should add another switch to keep the battery from draining
down.  You could also use the door buzzer wire(gray) from the switch as a
trigger to the stereo.  This wier is energized when key is in the ignition.
