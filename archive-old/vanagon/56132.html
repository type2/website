Subject: Re: Bike racks

 
The rear mounted rack makes just checking the oil and coolant level a 
real chore to say nothing of getting at the engine itself.
 
I settled on a Thule rack that was designed to sit on the gutter and 
still clear the poptop. This meant no roof raising so I had the thing 
bolted right on to the cap itself. It's o.k. for lightweight stuff like 
windsurfing gear, kayaks, bikes,etc. 
 
I've seen lots of Westies with similiar racks on the N.C. coast.  The 
rack must be mounted towards the rear in order to be able to raise the 
roof with your toys still up there. I guess it has something to do with 
the mechanical advantage or whatever. 
 
People usually comment that it doesn't detract from the look fo the van. 
One small crack developed near one of the bolts but is barely noticeable 
and hasn't gotten any larger after the four years since it was installed.
