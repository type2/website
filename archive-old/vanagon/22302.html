&gt; Chilton says remove some tin, and you have access to the oil cooler.
&gt; Muir and local mechanic engine must be out/remove fan housing.
&gt; Is Chiton wrong again?

Looks to me like they are both wrong.  You can easily remove the fan
housing without removing the engine.  The procedure has been described
here before so a search of the archives should find it.  Remove the fan
housing and you will be able to access the cooler.
