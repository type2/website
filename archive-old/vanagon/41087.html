Subject: bullet turn signaldates

I thought I saw a '62 23-Window with the big oval turn signals...  
Maybe a '63?

'62 end of bullets?
'63 end of 23-window?

Clara has the magic book with all the dates for the chassis numbers...
--------

the magic book say,

 5 Aug 63   Front turn indicator - now larger and with yellow glass  chassis
# 1 144 303

but - that is the european specs, for north america the turn signals were
changed earlier,  at 802 986

 it is a bit screwy - decifering these tomes should be done earlier in the
day

but in the usa fried egg turn signals mean 62 -67 to me
