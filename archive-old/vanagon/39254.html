Subject:      trannys,mud flaps,anti-theft

Two years ago I shopped,  studied and investigated for the best deal
for transmission replacement/rebuilding for my {now my wifes} '83
water westy. Now I notice a plethora of vanagoners scrounging for
a good used and the like.  I wound up having the original,  154,000
mile,  tranny taken out,  flown from Allentown, PA to LAX and shipped
over to Fast German Auto where they rebuilt it totally.  This ordeal
took eight days,  $1500.00,  and has been wonderful ever since.  So,
eventhough their ad mentions nothing about trannys they do do them
often and well.  The price?  For what I got plus a 12 -12 warranty
no one could touch on the East Coast.

Mud Flaps!  After thirteen years they are starting to get ugly and
need replacement;  the problem is finding the right ones.  I have the
type that are mounted about six inches back from the wheel well via a
bracket that runs underneith the westy,  and they also flair up the
side and are secured to the body with two pin holes.  Where?  How
much?  I need to Know!

Our Rottweiler is the best anti-theft apparatus we have found,  and
she keeps our feet warm!
