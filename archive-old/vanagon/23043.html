Subject: Oil?

rick&gt; And for those that remember my earlier postings - I've switched
rick&gt; to straight 30W oil on the advice of a local mechanic who
rick&gt; insisted that 20W-50 could blow the oil filter off! It *seems* to
rick&gt; run a little cooler as a result, but that was only in the city -
rick&gt; I haven't given it a lengthy mountain test yet. Next week and
rick&gt; we'll see.

        Hmm. Anybody know about this? I used to run SAE 30 when I lived in
LA, but after arrival here in Austin I read in bentley that the recomended
oil for somewhat tropical conditions (seldom goes below 70 in summer, 90+
during the day) was SAE 40. FLAPS don't got Castrol 40, only no name brand,
so I am running 20-50. I'll go back to 30 for winter use. Any ideas about
any of this? Especially from those of you in the &quot;hot&quot; states/localities?
Thanks in advance.

Peace,
