&gt;
&gt;'81 Vanagon 2.0L engine, 84K, new heads, rings.  $1125. 206-772-8799...

I have an '81 Vanagon Engine in Denver for $600 complete, turnkey. It
includes everything from the FI components, tin, alternator, etc. The motor
runs fine, does not smoke, and has no end play. Please Email if interested.
Thanks,
