Subject: &quot;TGIF&quot; Contest!

All these years you've probably thought that &quot;TGIF&quot; stands for &quot;Thank
God It's Friday&quot;, but--I hope you're sitting down to receive this news--
it is my duty to inform you that that belief is quite wrong, and in fact
the amazing thing is that at this moment the true meaning of the
acronym is STILL UNKNOWN, and can only emerge into its true place in
the world of reality with the help of your participation in this CONTEST!

Send in your entry!  Supply the true meaning of TGIF!

Enter as often as you wish, but each entry must be in a separate message.
Entries will be judged by an independent and impartial Judging Agency,
namely Joel Walker , whose decision is final.  (In this context, 
&quot;independent&quot; means that entries from Yankees will probably be summarily
pitched in the bit bucket.  &quot;impartial&quot; refers to &quot;impartial Joel-style&quot;,
which  means that his own entry will probably be the winner.)  Grand prize
is an autographed picture of Martha wearing a flannel hat.  (And nothing
else!!!!)
