Subject: Vanagon mini survey.


This is directed to the owners of aircooled vanagons. I am doing a 
mini-survey in order to find out what kind of performance characteristics 
are typical of an air cooled Vanagon. Part of the reason is determining 
major faults that may be of interest to all of us. Another reason is 
curiosity 
- why did VW replace these engines after only three years of production? 

If  you have the time please forward the following information to me:

Year and type of Vanagon - 
How many years owned -
Age of van -
Age of engine -
First engine?
Clutch replaced?
Transmission replaced?

Daily use?-

Mileage -
MPG - city/highway -

Replaced Parts - electrical
Replaced Parts - emission
Replaced Parts - fuel system

Max speed -

Oil pressure at speed (if known) -
Oil pressure at idle -

Major body work -
Major suspension work -

Major items  (body/engine) requiring improvement in your 
estimation 

Any other points you would like to add - 


Thanks in advance - DC
