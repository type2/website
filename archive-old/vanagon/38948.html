&gt;I have a stalling problem that has to due with loss of spark.  I have
&gt;replaced the coil and the problem remains.  I have been told the problem
lies
&gt;in the &quot;ECM&quot; or &quot;ECU&quot; (the same thing I am told).  This part has a $700.00
&gt;price tag.  Any suggestions on other possible problems?  The fuel system is
&gt;in good shape and the van runs like a champ.

I seriously doubt the problem is the ECU.  I had the same problem on my
camper.  The problem turned out to be a bad connection where the harnesses
plug into the back of the fuse box.  The wire from the ignition switch goes
int the fuse box at on connection, then another connection completes the
circuit to the ignition coil.  This connector(small pin) was all black and
corroded. Since there is no fuse in this part of the circuit, i jumpered the
two wires together and problem was cured.
