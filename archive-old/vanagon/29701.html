Subject: 1990 Engine clatter, part 2

Vanatics,
Thanks to all of you that responded to my original engine clatter message.
 The consensus seemed to be that the noise was probably just lifters and that
it would likely go away on its own, but might require some oil additive to
clear out any clogging in the lifter oil ports.

I started her up tonite and the clattering seemed less than before (maybe I'm
getting used to it).  I used a mechanic's stethescope(sp?) and the noise did
seem more pronounced in the heads than at the center of the case.  I ran it
for about 12-15 minutes and the clattering seemed to be diminishing.  I
varied the throttle between 2000-4000 RPM and the temperature eventually rose
up to about 1/3 scale for this first time with this engine.  Previous normal
temperature (on the original 87 engine) was very close to 1/2 scale.  After
the engine was warmed up the OIL PRESSURE LIGHT came on for a moment.  I
stopped the engine.  I looked at the engine.  I checked the oil - O.K.  I
started it again.  After about 30 seconds the oil light came on again around
3000RPM.  The buzzer did NOT come on either time - just the light.  While the
light was on, it seemed to glow brighter at higher RMP and dimmer at lower
RPM.  I turned off the engine after about 10 seconds. I looked at the
information on the oil pressure switches in the Bentley book and did a couple
of engine-off continuity checks and everything seemed normal.  The book shows
the use of an oil pressure tester tool, part #VW1342.  Does anyone own one of
these?  Can I rent it?

I don't want to run the engine any more without being able to do some sort of
definitive testing.  Any suggestions?  All help is very much appreciated.
