Ok,  I have to throw my hat in the ring.

I am thinking about creating a heater fan by using a power supply fan
from a PC and some PVC pipe, and a couple of pieces of plexi.

EssrntiallY, I would make a hole in two pieces of plexi that were the same
size as the fan, the hole being the side  of the fan blade opening.  Then
I would take two pieces of PVC pipe, one that was just big enough to fit
over the tube stub next to the tranny, and the other just small enough
to fit into the flexible tube coming from the engine.  I would
glue each tube to its own piece of plastic, and then bolt the two pieces
of plastic to the fan, making a  fan sandwich

            |   Fan    |

             |        |

Like so.

Remember, this design is for air cooleds.  I have no idea what the
water pumpers have in mind.
