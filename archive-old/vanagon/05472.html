Subject: 1700CC reinstall

 Hey all - We've been putting my sister's 1700 type IV back together after
replacing the heads with rebuilds, and changing the rings, but are running
into a few snags -

1. TWee to put the heat exchanger/muffler back into the exhaust ports as one u
unit, and _boy_ was it hard ... we even had the engine upside down at one
point ... the pipes just wouldn't line up. Anyway, we finally did get them
in, but in the process of tightening them down, one bolt on each head stripped.
I'm sure I didn't over-tighten them ... is the metal of type IV heads unusually
soft? Any ideas what I should do now?
2. The rubber motor-mounts on the the engine bearer were cracked, so we hoped
to replace them , but the part supplied by two local FLAPS for our year (73)
is different. Our mounts had onlyone bolt sticking out the bottom of the
rubber block (which then went through the bearer). The part everyone
wants to sell us has bolts coming out both sides of the rubber block. weird.

 Any help or ideas appreciated greatly. I especially worried about the 
stripped bolt on the exhaust port ...
