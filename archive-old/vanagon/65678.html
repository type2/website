Subject:      For Lisa, re '81 Westy

Lisa, I tried to reply to you directly but something must've screwed up
because the reply-to header line in your email message was invalid. So
here's what I said. I guess it's of enough relevance to the list in
general...

&gt;Hi Michael!
&gt;
&gt;I just returned home from Minneapolis to Schenectady with my newly
&gt;purchased 81 Westy.  You may brand yourself as mechanically inept, but I
&gt;wouldn't know how to stop the SEars tire guy from serious harm.
&gt;
&gt;As a neophyte owner, have you any sage advice?  To get inspected it
&gt;needs to go up on the lift and now I fear for its safety.  I can change
&gt;the oil (probably) but thats about it.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, loved reading your post.  Sincerely, Lisa

Hi Lisa. &quot;Sage advice&quot;? Hmm...well, fresh tastes alot better than the
little jars from the supermarket. :)

I guess the overarching thing is that attitude realignment I mentioned.
This is a 16-year-old vehicle you have just bought. And while those
air-cooled engines are close to indestructable they do require more (and
more diligent) preventive maintenance to remain so. Also, IMHO VW has a
chronic problem with all their vehicles...while they make a hellova good
engine and drive train, they tend to skimp on peripherals and often use
inferior or under-engineered materials. So be prepared to have minor yet
vital components break: distributor, fuel pump, etc., not to mention
interior and exterior parts like door latches, dashboard trim, and so on.
And when something (or several somethings at once) breaks, don't get mad.
Just sigh, accept it, and have whatever it is replaced with the
highest-quality aftermarket part you can find.

In a more specific vein, here's what I've gleaned from various list members
who took pity on my neo questions:

Remember that heat is your engine's Enemy. Operating and melting temps on
these air-cooleds are far closer together than on a water-cooled engine. I
recommend as soon as you can having an oil temperature gauge installed.
Parts for this cost about $50 and the installation you could probably do
yourself. Once you have the gauge you'll know for sure if you're running
too hot. In the meantime, check that the tin shroud is in good shape. Open
the engine compartment and look down. If you can see the ground anywhere
you're probably running too hot. See, airflow is crucial to keeping the
engine cool, and the tin is there to direct the air properly. You can also
use your nose...take the van for a good long drive, an hour or more, then
just go round the back and sniff. If you smell burnt oil (as opposed to
just the normal &quot;hot&quot; smell) that's maybe not good.

Tires...if your new purchase has standard passenger car tires you should
replace them ASAP. Especially on the back wheels they're carrying more
weight than a regular tire is designed to. This makes you prone to blowouts
and makes the van handle like sh*t. Get some light truck tires that are
rated at least as load range C and 1400 lbs. If you can't afford a full set
all at once do the back pair first.

Since like me you won't be working on the van yourself, mostly, you need to
find someone in your area who specializes in air-cooled VWs, who is
trustworthy, and who won't break your bank. (I bought my Westy from a guy
who runs a VW custom shop in Memphis. He sold me my daily-drive vehicle, an
old Golf, three years ago.) Who's in your area that meets these
requirements is the kind of question other listmembers could probably
answer for you.

Finally, the Vanagon list is a great resource BUT you have to take the
advice you get with a grain of salt and sometimes the whole darn lick.
Every question you ask will likely generate a range of mutually
contradictory replies. When I asked what was the max safe cruising speed
for my '81, the answers I got ranged from &quot;no more than 60 mph&quot; to
&quot;whatever she'll do&quot;. The best piece of advice I got from the list in that
vein was &quot;get used to the right lane.&quot; :)

Schenectady, huh? How's the heat in your Westy? Mine is nonexistent but in
southern Mississippi that's not much of a handicap.
