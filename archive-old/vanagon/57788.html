Subject: Looking for &quot;Vent Visors&quot;

I am looking to &quot;Vent Visors&quot; for my 1985 Vanagon GL.  I have tried 
several places but cannot find s source for these items.  &quot;Vent Visors&quot;
is the brand name for the things that attach to the front doors and
let you crack the windows for ventilation.  The ones I have seen are
tinted.

Thanks,
Keith A. Stackhouse
85 Vanagon
