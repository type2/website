Subject: &lt;all vanagon&gt;  Bumper hitch


Hi folks,

I need a Class 2 (2200lb) hitch for the crewcab, just like the one on the
Syncro. So I am going to copy the Syncro unit exactly.  Is anyone else
interested in this kind of hitch?  Building 3 or 4 isn't much additional
work, and is a bit more efficient.  I'm guessing at about $100/unit.  Dennis
Hayes already makes a beefier Class 3 unit BTW.

 My current hitch is fully inside the bumper, with heavy tow loops etc.
just like stock.  Bumper bolts back onto hitch in stock position/height. The
tongue drops down just below the bumper, needs  a slight tinsnipped notch to
clear.  This gets a 'real' bumper in back, covering the engine compartment
section.  Corners are still vulnerable.  I may be able to modify the design
to give a 'hide-away' hitch with removable drawbar.  Anyhow, let me know so
I can plan how much metal to buy.  Hitch weighs about 30-40lbs all up.


bye, Tim
