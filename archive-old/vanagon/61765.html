&gt;I noticed that the entry for the Kubelwagen
&gt;
&gt;http://www.sofcom_dot_com.au/4WD/4WD.html
&gt;
&gt; says it's 2wd only with no mention of the Kommanderswagen or the
&gt;Schwimmwagen, both of which are 4wd vehicles.
&gt;Oh well...  At least the picture is nice even if the text is mis-leading.
&gt;
&gt;Derek...   What's chained to the front of your synchro in the snowy picture?

I don't know why this post is labeled as &quot;no vanagon content&quot; since my van
in the picture is a vanagon. I guess you wrote the subject header before
adding this query to me.

Uh, in front of my syncro is chained a 4,000lb portable Warn winch. I am
aired down to 14psi and am unable to climb the steep hill because of the
18+&quot; of snow there. The winch is on the snow because, in the picture, there
is no tension on the winch cable.

The site he refers to is: http://www.sofcom_dot_com.au/4WD/VW/VW.html
