So dean c aukes says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1973 Campmobile.  Did they have a special supplement for the 
&gt; camping equipment?  There are little brackets that I can't figure out what 
&gt; to do with!!!

Why don't you describe where the brackets are and what they look like. Maybe
we can figure it out on the list.  Hey!  Make it a contest.  Winner gets to
use Martha's shower for 2 hours!  ;)

&gt; 
&gt; If so, I assume that you can't get them from the dealer, which leaves buying 
&gt; used or getting a copy from someone.

Try looking at used book stores.  I've found several manuals at them.  In quite
good shape too.
