Hello vanagon friends,

My friend's 1988 vanagon has low oil pressure, when ideling and not when
accelerating or traveling fast.  He DOES have 20w50 weight oil in his
vehicle.  He brought his van in to a shop and had a gauge hooked up and
indeed he has low oil pressure, so the switches are not at fault.  The
problem gets worse as the engine gets hotter.  

His question is, should he remove the oil pump and replace it, to try to
solve the problem, even though it could just be a worn engine?  Or should he
just wait out the problem until the engine dies and just replace the engine?
He is planning to take a 5000 mile trip on thursday.

thanks again for your help with his new van.
