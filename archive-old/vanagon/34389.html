&gt;Boxer? From boxing? Absolutely!

&gt;Since &quot;Boxer&quot; means (in German) either a boxer (the guy who punches people) or 
&gt;a horizontally opposed engine, I think the derivation is right on. My .02.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The origin of the term is unclear.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I thought it was because the pistons' movements are reminiscent of the
&gt;&gt;fists of two boxers pounding each other. &lt;?&gt;
&gt;


Hogwash, 'Boxer' refers to the cantankerous nature of these engines and the 
fact that their intrinsic behaviour can be revolting at times.  I 
respectfully submit that these engines were named after the famous 'Boxer 
Rebellion' in China, a much larger scale punch-up than a couple of brawling 
German sluggo's.
