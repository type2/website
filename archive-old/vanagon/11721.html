Subject: Re: '96 Eurovan rumours


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Howdy,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I haven't posted much, but I plan on buying a Camper sometime over the next
&gt;&gt;year.  After following the incredible flow of this group for a while, I'm
&gt;&gt;getting the happy feeling that I'm going to buy a lifestyle more than a car.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I called today to give Volkswagon my wishes for the new Eurovan.  The woman
&gt;&gt;who answered told me that the '96 model should have a 6-cylinder engine and
&gt;&gt;airbags.                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;Cool.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; .....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thought someone may be interested.

Why is it a rumor if you called VW?
