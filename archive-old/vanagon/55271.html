?????????  In an '80 FI van the fuel pump is running a continuous stream 
of gas from the tank, past the injectors, and back to the tank.  The only 
&quot;vapor&quot; line I'm aware of is the line from the gas tank, through the 
charcoal filter and into the air filter box; this captures evaporated 
fuel from the gas tank.  Is this the line you're refering to?
