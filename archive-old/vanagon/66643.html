Subject:      F.S. 85 Vanagon: weekender pkg.

     List members:

     I was a fortunate person.  My broter-in-law and I happen to be very
     good friends.  This friendship was developed by our accidental
     acquaintance and love of VW's.  Over the years we have knocked around
     each others vehicles from bugs to the VR6.  He has asked me to post
     the following Vanagon for sale.  He has done a great job at
     maintaining this vanagon and is in very good shape.  He's located in
     the Chicagoland area. Any list member who picks this Vanagon up will
     be a &quot;happy camper&quot;.

     Unfortunately, his business requries him to travel.  Be patient, he
     really wants the Vanagon to go to someone who appreciates Vanagons. He
