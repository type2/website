Subject:       Re: help GM alternator in a 74 1800?

Hey this is great.  We can swap alot of info back and forth I am 
sure.  As for the fuel lines I have already replaced them.  I learned 
that the hard way after burning up a 73 beetle.  the fuel iline 
rotted and srayed fule onto the distributor.  Spark and fuel makes 
end of beetle.  Do you have a GM alt on your van?  What kind of van 
is yours?  Mine apparently has all of the options going without the 
awning that attaches but this would be neat to get to :-) .  The 
biggest questions I have right now is proper hose routings.  Mine are 
all plugged up or off or missing.  It was a bit of a challenge 
(wreck) when I bought it but it is coming along.  Well I will keep 
you posted. Best of luck with your van.
