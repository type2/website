Subject: RE:  Grateful Dead in Boston...

 
&gt;&gt; Ok, so this is only tangentally related to vanagons...or Typ 2s.....
&gt;&gt; but what the hell....anyone know when the Dead is playing in 
&gt;&gt; Boston Garden this year??
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Ric
&gt;I believe it's in October. Check out rec.music.gdead. At least once a
&gt;week someone posts confirmed tour dates. Not a bad newsgroup...

It isn't a bad newsgroup, but it is one of the more prolific ones, so 
hopefully you can filter it or are prepared to read through hundreds of
subject lines a day.
