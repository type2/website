&gt;It was BRG, it was Minilites, it was hard top, it was 289 fire breathing 
cubes
&gt;of sheer street terror, sure, you had to change the back two plugs from the
&gt;cockpit through a door in the transmission tunnel but this was no pussycat.
&gt;
&gt;1967 Sunbeam Tiger/  certified vette killer/ Hallibrand QC /Hurst /2-4BBl
&gt;/289CI
&gt;AC-Ford Cobra motor/ overheats in traffic, no airconditioning, walnut dash, 

&gt;nardi, traction masters, goodyear bluestreaks ... $4000/bo ...
&gt;
&gt;of course that was 1974.  I'd easily swap the sinkro for the same car 
today.
&gt;
&gt;The hallibrand qc was because the standard sunbeam beefed up r&amp;p would't 
hold
&gt;up to the 289 torque.


That wasn't the only part that wouldn't hold up. The first prototype
Tiger was built (sort of) by Ken Miles in Los Angeles. He took an
Alpine (4-cyl) given him by Rootes, and dropped in a 260 and the
two-speed automatic from a Fairlane, without changing much else
(OTOH, Shelby completely re-engineered the chassis/suspension).
Started it up, tooled it around a little (VERY nose-heavy-- he put
the drive line so far forward, he had to use an electric fan in FRONT
of the radiator).

He decided it was bearable, so brought it to a stop and then punched it.
A loud crashing sound from the rear, and his differential hit the
ground-- he'd ripped out every spoke in the factory-original wire
spoke wheels. From then on, all Tigers had steel wheels only.

Shelby's prototype was done differently. Shelby removed the steering
box and used its mount as an engine mount, fabricating a dished-in
firewall to let the engine sit way back, so the car balanced well.
But, this left him with no space for a steering box or rack behind the
axle whee it belonged.

So he put a rack-and-pinion AHEAD of the axle, and made some new tie
rods and control arms that extended  forward from the wheel pivots
instead of rearward. This messed up the steering geometry royally.
Normally, when you turn a corner, the inside front wheel turns more
sharply than the outside, since it must roll around a smaller-diameter
circle than the outside wheel. Shelby's car (and all ensuing Tigers)
had it backward, and so it screeches/drags its front tires around
all but the mildest turns. As a result, handling sucks. In fact, the
4-cyl Alpines have been known to beat the V8 Tigers on tight road-race
courses. But once you get on the straight...

Well, this has absolutely nothing to do with VWs, so I'll stop.
Interesting stuff, tho...
