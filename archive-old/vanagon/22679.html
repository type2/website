&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt;         I did something very unusual today.  (before breakfast, even)
&gt; I bought a new muffler for my bus, but I bought a factory muffler.
&gt; The guy at the VWFLAPS looked at me like I'd asked for a grilled weasel
&gt; on a bun with fries when I asked for it!  Seems they don't sell very many
&gt; amymore!
&gt; 
&gt;         It ran me about $125 with all the clamps and stuff, and copper
&gt; exhaust nuts.
&gt; 
&gt; PS - The obsession with lawyers is due to a mjor influx of new sig lines
&gt; pertaining to lawyers, and my sig script works sequentially.  Gotta fix
&gt; that, I guess.  What was that random perl script line again?
&gt;

Why in the world did it cost so much?????????????????????

For our '71 bus, $30 covers the cost of muffler and a few clamps.
