Subject: Re: Gas heater

&gt;The gas heater in my '75 Westy is not performing well.
&gt;Can anyone furnish me with a schematic and some instructions.
&gt;

Allen, 

I have a manual for the Eberspacher BN4 that I could photocopy for you. It
contains wiring diagrams and troubleshooting tests.  Copied and shipped it
would be like $7-$8.  Let me know if you're interested.  

BTW, what's wrong with your heater?
