Subject:      EUROVAN EXHAUST


 Thanks to all of you who replied to my message about EV exhausts. Looks
like mine is the only one that has had trouble. Must be something it ate!

Ric and others warned about Midas etc. exhausts and the advice is well taken.
I regard this entire lot as a bunch of crooks who prey on the innocent. Just
look sometime at their ad campaigns: scare tactics and false security.
What I actually had in mind by &quot;aftermarket&quot; were companies like the Parts
Place in Auburn ? Michigan. I was wondering if anyone out there had bought
one of their EV exhausts; but from your answers, noone has needed to. Maybe
ours will last longer too, now that it's been patched.

To the person who test drove the EV GL w/ 69k miles: No the engine shouldn't
idle roughly: get someone knowledgable to check it out.

To the new EV owner who smelled sulfur: switch to another brand of gas. Some
brands give the engine odiferous indigestion!

Best to all of you; maybe the V6 arrive soon and be affordable! May VWoA
market it as well as the original EV so it will be more affordable to those
in the know!
