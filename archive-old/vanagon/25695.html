&gt; &gt;generated from this puts a strain on the pot metal lock barrel, and I broke
&gt; &gt;the barrel on one door--it split in half and came out with the key.  I did
&gt; &gt;have a spare barrel around that matched the grooves in the key, so all I had
&gt; &gt;to do was switch over the brass tumblers from the old barrel and do a little
&gt; &gt;filing.  Since I don't have any more spare lock parts lying around, I should
&gt; &gt;replace the spring soon.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As I remember, the spring we're talking about looks like a winding spring
&gt; &gt;you would find in an old clock.  Does anyone have the specs on that spring
&gt; &gt;so I can just buy a couple and put them in at my liesure?  In my case, the
&gt; &gt;springs aren't broken, just worn out and not doing their job of returning
&gt; &gt;the push button in the door handle.

See my other post about using a spring from a retractable pen.

&gt; Guys, professional locksmiths do this rebuilding/keying a dozen times

&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; Do yourself a favor, and let a pro handle this task! It'll free you up to
&gt; do the shift lever adjustment, seal the pop top, rebuild the engine, etc.!

No, Steve. A professional locksmith (unless he is a '71 bus owner) won't
have a clue about this lock.
