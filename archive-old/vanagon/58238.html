Thanks for the pointer, I should have known better.  I'm from Cleveland,
Ohio, America and I would be willing to pick up a Vanagon pretty much
anywhere in the US and Canada.  I would really like the 4 wheel drive 7
passenger version.  I'm not exactly sure what the different types of
Vanagons are, can a GL or Westy also be 4 wheel drive?  For example is the
'87 GL in San Jose a Syncro?  Please excuse my ignorance, could you point
me in the direction of the FAQ for this mailing list.  

Thanks

&gt; You should say where you are.  People on the list are from all over the
world.
&gt; You can still buy these new in South Africa, and there are definately
list
&gt; members there, but I doubt you want to be told to go to your local
dealer...
&gt; 
&gt; There is an '87 GL in San Jose California for sale for $7500, and many
others
&gt; scattered about.  If you want a Westfalia camper conversion, people seem
to
&gt; think this adds about $10000 to the value.  It is cheaper to buy a Syncro
&gt; van and a non-syncro Westie and swap the interiors...
