I too have considered mounting a winch to the front of my Vanagon Westy in
order to get me up those steep inclines that are typical of an average
freeway on-ramp. It would be especially handy if I were to even think about
towing anything over the propane, water, and camping supplies. We almost had
to call AAA when we had the nerve to try using the van with a third person
riding in it!
Seriously, I would never dream of towing anything with my Vanagon due to the
pathetic lack of power. ('83 2.0 aircooled) Any incline over 1% (one
percent) renders it to the acceleration of my living room. It's a good thing
that the seats are comfy!

&gt;&gt; Hello All,
&gt;&gt;   Anyone know if the front bumper on the EV's can support the stress of a
&gt;&gt; winch. I was thinking of getting a winch that can has 4,000 lb. of line pull
&gt;&gt; for the front bumper. I was also thinking of getting a trailer hitch
&gt;&gt; put on and the adapter to put a winch on the hitch. Anyone with know how
&gt;&gt; in this area, suggestions are welcomed.
&gt;
&gt;Yes I think a 4,000 lb. pull winch should be just about right for 
&gt;yanking the front bumper right off.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Seriously I doubt a 'bumper' could handle 2 tons on almost any vehicle.  
&gt;I think you'll need to somehow 'mount' the winch to put the stress on the 
&gt;frame.  I haven't looked into a winch fro the front of my EV.  But I did 
&gt;just put a hitch on the back that was rated to tow 3500 lbs.  I'd have to 
&gt;crawl under the van to see what a front mount could look like.  The rear 
&gt;hitch mounted using six holes already in the frame.  4 replaced shorter 
&gt;with longer bolts that also hold the bumper on and two are new 
&gt;additions.  Adding one of the new bolts is a challenge since the nut is 
&gt;behind a heat shield for the muffler.
&gt;
&gt;The 3500 lb. hitch mount should handle most of what the 4000 lb. winch could.
&gt;
&gt;I'm real curious about what you intend to do with an EV that requires a 2 
&gt;ton winch?  Running an EV through mud?  pulling out tree stumps?
