Harold, 

Nice work on reviewing the current tire situation.

I just want to (once again) get on my soapbox about LT27x8.5x14 
tires as an alternative. The LT stands for light truck, and
they have the load capacity as well as sidewall stiffness for
great( well, better) handling. The diameter is slightly oversize;
my speedometer runs about 3% low.

I have these tires as BFGoodrich AT &quot;Baha Commanders&quot; which is
a moderately agressive sport-ute tread, but they are available from
other manufacturers and in other tread designs. I know of three other 
vanagon owners who run this size tire, some syncros, some 2wd,
and all are very happy with them.

Because of the popularity of sport utility vehicles, tire companies are 
developing treads in the LT line with lots of different uses, one 
may fit yours. If you care for that sort of thing (no flames, please), 
Consumer Reports did a recent review of sport-ute tires, check it out as 
well.
