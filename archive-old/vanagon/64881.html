I would check the pads and shoes.  If they were replaced with after market
junk, they will not perform properly.  Especially the rear shoes.  The factory
rear shoes do use a metallic woven liner.  I have not been able to find
anything after market that comes close.  Also, make sure the drums and rotors
are not to thing.  The rotor wear limit is 13mm.  The drum wear limit is
228mm.  They are marked.

Dennis.
