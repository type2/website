Subject: bus bits and mail problems
Date: Sat, 16 Dec 1995 14:40:37 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


This is actually in response to private mail from Tom Forhan.  I'm
sending it here because I can't seem to come up with a valid email
address for him.  tforhan_at_house.hr_dot_gov bounces as `unknown domain'.
tforhan_at_hr.house_dot_gov is a known domain, but denies all knowledge of
the user tforhan.  As a last best-effort, I tried
tom.forhan_at_hr.house_dot_gov, but that didn't work either.  So, Tom, please
let your sysadmin know there's a problem with email at your site.


:  Great first cut! Ihave tow comments:

Thanks.

:  1) Do more than bits, have some place for whoole busses for sale, and 
:  wanted. You don't have to change the name of the page...it great.
:  A bus is just a collection of bits anyway.

I'm a little reluctant to do this, because I can see it becoming a
major time sink.  The problem is that vehicles go on and off the
market relatively quickly, compared to obscure parts.  I am making the
assumption that most of the listings here are going to be for obscure
parts, since the common stuff is so easy to get.  However, we'll see
what happens.

:  2) For parts listings, put the part name first, then the component,
:  then the other stuff. Once you have thousands of items (and you
:  will) it will make it easier to scan the top of each item,

Done.
