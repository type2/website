Subject: Newest Vanagon on the list??

Vanatics,
I was wondering who has the newest Vanagon on the list?  If you have a 1991
Vanagon and would like to see if your's is the newest on the list, send your
VIN (vehicle identification number) to me.  I'll keep a list and let the
whole list know the result.  BTW, your VIN will likely read something like:
WV2YB0259MH999999, where the last 6 digits (999999 in the example) represent
the sequential production number.  

Regards,
Jim Davis
87 GL Syncro
88 GL Wolfsburg
