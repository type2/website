Subject: head gasket leak ?


 the dealer found water in the oil? 
 they really should consider checking to oil cooler...
 these tend to go bad sometimes and when they do
 that would be the symptom...

 i've seen bad heads every which way and it's uncommon to find
 lots of water in the oil... sounds like a bad oil cooler...
 get a second opinion..
