Subject:  Type Two? 2? or what? 

Having seen some mention of this in the list I thought I'd share with you
something I received from a German friend today......
&quot; The beetle was the first type of car built by VW after 1945. The transporter
was their second type, built from 1950. So....all beetles are type 1's, and
all transporters are type 2's. Type 3 (1500, 1600) were built as a third type
of car 1961 - 73. Type 4 (411, 412) were built as a fourth VW type 1968 - 74.
Within type 2's (Transporters 1950 - 1995) there were four generations:
T1 1950 - 67
T2 1967 - 79
T3 1979 - 90 (&quot;syncro&quot; - 92?)
T4 1990 -
Simple eh?&quot;
Well I thought it was till I got this! So am I a type 2/type 1 with my Split?
Oh well it's all type 2 to me .....love and peace...Dave and Cee and SSVC
