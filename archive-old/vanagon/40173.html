Subject: Ignition parts needed.  anybody know where to get them???


i am in need of a few ignition pieces for my bus and bug.  both are the
same, but different.  i need the electrical unit for a factory stearing
lock.  it is a metal unit that sit's behind the key tumbler.  Both of them
look physically similar, but have small differences.   does anybody out
there have a source for new ones, of a used one laying around?  i am
running out of places to look.  if any can help in any way, please let me
know.

thanks and God Bless
matt


ps.  i could also use a new tumbler set for the bus stearing lock.

clara, thom, anyone??????
