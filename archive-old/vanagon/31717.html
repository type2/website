Subject: British Airways and Bay windows


Whilst visiting my folks over xmas, I was going through
an enormous pile of photos that have been sitting in a
box for at least ten+ years, when I came across some photos
taken on the way to a family holiday to somewhere or other.

The photos where taken at either Gatwick or Heathrow airport and 
had obviously been meant as pictures of various different planes 
(I was into things like that when I was small), but included are a
whole load of ground support vehicles. Among all the wierd thingy-
majigs and odd looking bits were two bay window panel vans, painted
in the BA vehicle colour scheme (white all over with blue cab doors).

&gt;From memory the front of the busses has a big basket sticking out at 
bumper level, maybe a couple of feet, and prehaps a foot high. One of 
the busses looks like it may have a big chain or rope in the basket. 
The roof has a pair of shallow rectangular box sections that have been 
added, one big and one small, the flat of the box meeting the curvature 
of the roof at its highest point. A bit awkward to describe really. 
There is also a small rack(?) fitted to the rear of the bus. From the 
lights, these are post '72- busses. If I can find a magnifying glass 
I may be able to read the registration plate, but as these photos 
where taken in the early 80s, they may have been trundling around 
the airport for some years.

Dunno what their actual function was though.

Obviously I had better talent for taken photos when I was younger
than I realised:)

Happy new year.
