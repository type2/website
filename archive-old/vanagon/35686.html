Subject: WTB - Steering Wheel

Hi VWers,

I need the brass ring on the back of the steering wheel.  This
ring allows the horn to work.  Mine wore out.  On certain models
of steering wheels, the brass ring is easily removed by removing the
black part it is attached to in the center.  I will check on the procedure
if some one would like.

I am willing to buy the whole steering wheel in order to get the ring,
my horn does not work right now.
