I suggest that you do not run your tank out of gas to see
how far you can go.  This can put unwanted crap in your
injectors and make it run rough until you clean it out.

Also, I don't recommend topping off.  It's just wastes gas
and screws with the evaporation system also.

I usually run till about 220 miles and then refill.  I don't
want the sediments at the bottom of the tank to have a chance
to get sucked in.
