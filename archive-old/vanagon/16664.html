Subject: Re: How do I stop this oil leak?

&gt;I've got a pretty steady oil leak dripping off the little nuts 
&gt;surrounding the oil drain plug on my '71. I've replaced the paper 
&gt;gaskets, the brass washers, the little nuts and even the entire round 
&gt;metal plate with no success. How the hell do I stop this thing?!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Are you _sure_ the oil is coming from the strainer plate?  If the front mail 
seal is blown, the oil runs back on the bottom of the case till it hits the 
strainer plate.  The other possibility is the case halves are leaking.  I 
would shoot the underside of the engine with some engine cleaner and then 
find out where the leaks are coming from.
