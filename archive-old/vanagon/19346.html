You mentioned that the creeps had lowered the rear of your bus.  How
did they do it?  I am planning to lower my bus (2-3.5 inches) and might
be interested in buying the lowering stuff from you if you are planning to 
take the bus back up to stock.

Good luck with the bus.

I am planing on keeping the micro.  Yes the creeps did lower the rear.  It is
an easy procedure.  The digest version is to take off the trailing arms and
turn them so they put less tension on the torsion bar.  make sure you get more
detailed instruction on this.  

Sleeping in my bus would have been smart, but not very comfortable as the
interior was removed.  Including the top.  Looking at the work he had done It
looked like he did not know how to finish the headliner so he told someone to
steal it. As he is an ex-gang member and a killer.  I do not think I will
bring the law into it.
