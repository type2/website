Subject: DESPERATE to sell 87 Westy

     Evan Parker, (301) 345-9486, is an Australian who bought an 85
     automatic Westy in California and used it for touring the U.S. for
     about six months. Its very clean, solid California car with 105000
     miles on it, new tires, etc.

     He and his family are leaving for the UK Monday, and his efforts
     to sell the car (he started advertising at a West Coast price
     of $8500) have not gone well. He really wants to sell this car,
     and mentioned $5500 without me trying to bargain at all.

     I am tempted, but following Dereks advice, am holding out for a
     Syncro. But this is a nice, clean machine, and if you know of
     someone who would be interested give the gentleman a call!

     I have no financial interest in this, just want to pass it along
     as a favor to a nice guy...
