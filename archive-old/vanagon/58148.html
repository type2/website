Subject: engine damage?
Date: Mon, 7 Apr 1997 22:34:40 -0500

I have the chance to purchase an 80 vanagon that suffered an engine fire. 
I believe that a fuel line came off and fed the fire.  The top components
of the engine; ignition, fuel injection, intake,etc, are destroyed, but the
engine case seems ok.  this car comes with all the parts to repair it
except the ignition system.  The owner found all the FI stuff, including
the ECU!  My question is, is this worth fixing?  What damage would the
engine internals suffered from this fire?  Would the case or heads be
warped?  I did not try to turn the engine over.  All replies would be
appreciated, as I have to move on this fairly quickly.  




thanks everyone!
