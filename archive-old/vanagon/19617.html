Subject: Bus Won't Back Up

     As I posted a few weeks ago, I cannot shift
my 1978 Type II into reverse.  Several readers, 
including Joel, suggested that I check for loose linkage
at the bottom of the shift lever, and at the transmission end.

      I've located the linkages and taken a look,
but don't really know what to look for -- or how to 
remedy the situation once I find it.

      Can any of you give specific instructions?  Alternate
theories of the problem would also be welcome.

      Thanks!
