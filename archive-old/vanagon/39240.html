Subject: '67 Camper

	The camper I am referring to is the one I  had inquired about the 
cost of restoring. I picked it up in December on the spur of the moment. 
It was sitting in some guy's barn for 10 years and he had to have the 
barn torn down. I bought it for $50 and towed it home on a trailer. I 
will possibly start restoring it this summer, but I am looking in to all 
the options, including the purchase of one a little further a little 
further along. I will keep you posted.
