Subject: Rear screen for early 70's Westy.
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 1995 12:48:01 -0400

While in a junkyard getting a speedometer for our diesel Jetta this weekend
(the odometer stopped working at 260,000 miles), my wife spotted a decaying
Westy in a corner of one field.  Closer inspection revealed it to be a 1970
model, with complete engine (no idea of condition), crumbling canvas, and
rust where most sheet metal used to be.  The interior was gone.

Buried in a box under a heap of junk inside the bus were two screens for the
rear hatch opening.  One was pretty tattered, but the other nearly perfect.
I bought it, thinking someone on this list must need one.  I know I would have
sold my grandmother for one of these screens when we had our 1974 Westy, but
we sold it this spring.

Anyway, anyone interested should send me email with a tempting offer.  If I
don't sell it this way, I'll tote it to the fall Bug Out in Manassas.
