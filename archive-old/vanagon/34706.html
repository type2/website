Subject: 68-7x brake fluid resiviors

	I tried to buy new reseviors for my '70 (Little Martha)
from RMMW and although the catalog does list them, they aren't in
stock and never will be, apparently. The local parts guy at
the dealer couldn't get 'em either.
	In the end, we scavenged a set of upper and lower reseviors
from a pair of new-arrivals at Pick and Pull, and spent a lot of time
cleaning them up! Used pipe-cleaners, big pipe-cleaners from the
crafts store and pieces of rag attached to pieces of wire, with
a LOT of elbow grease and no small amount of non-cfc-brake cleaner.
You CAN get the big flat lower resevior clean, but it takes work.

	So if you own an early breadloaf, I recomend you look for
a spare resevior set NOW when at the junk yard. Same for the
wierdly shaped tube that connects them, and the black rubber gaskets
that seal the whole mess. I think I was able to get the rubber gaskets
still from the dealer. Mercifully, the resevior-to-master-cylinder
gaskets come with the master cylinder.

	So when do we actually get our stickers to stick on as
we see fit?
