Wup, sorry, didn't mean to keep anyone hanging there, here's what I sent
Matt:

A very honest and capable mechanic is:

T-N-T Automotive
3303 East 19th Street
Signal Hill, CA  90804
(562) 439-6720

Tom is the owner and sole mechanic.  I've tended to do most of my own
work when I could over the years and have only taken things to him that
I didn't know how to fix or that were a bigger job than I wanted to
hassel with.  He's knows his stuff and has never told me something was
wrong that wasn't--I've tested this because usually I knew what was
wrong and didn't want to do it myself out of the size of the job.  That
and every time I always could honestly say that I wouldn't have charged
less than he did.  He's a good guy.

You wouldn't be down this far probably, but there's Nyscoe Motors in
Santa Ana worth avoiding at ALL cost.  Somehow I've had people refer
them to me, but they not only do shoddy work, they jack up part prices
to the ceiling and I highly suspect that they did an unneccessary
cylinder head replacement on my bus.  After dealing with them, I have
learned to always to go through the extra hassel of getting my car down
to Tom in Signal Hill.  

Never take convenience over the certainty of a good mechanic, Nyscoe was
a nightmare I was lured into because they were 15 minutes on surface
streets from where I live, while Tom is a 30 minute drive on the freeway
in good traffic.  But very well worth it!
