Subject:      Re: VANAGON digest 685; Jetta Heater Core

Golfs and Jettas produced between 1985 and 1990 or 91 contained defective
heater cores that could and often did rupture as described in Digest 685.
It was the core itself that was defective, as I understand it. Their was
an official recall on it and I had the core replaced on my '85 Golf under
this plan.

While I'm at it I have another question for the EV faction on the list:
has any of you purchased a set of floor mats from VW? I did and have had
a constant problem with the rear mat (in the &quot;cabin&quot; under the table) not
staying in place. We flatten it out, even pin it under the fiberboard panel
under the third row (bench)seat, and it always comes up in a hump in the
middle that all of us are constantly tripping over. Any experience with this
problem and solutions??

Thanks.
