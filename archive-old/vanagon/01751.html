&gt;I'd appreciate it.  I'm wondering which kind to look for (on top, back, or
&gt;hanging from the front) and where to get one that fits the lovely form of
&gt;the bus!!!!  Thanks in advance!!!

And joel responded with:

i just called two of the bike shops in town and this is what they said:
shop1: only got Thule brand, roof mounts only. $300. ouch. said that
       front mounts might be illegal in some states (blocking headlights,
       etc.).

shop2: got Rhode-gear brand. recommends bike carrier that fits into trailer
hitch (for either 'receiver' hitch or ball hitch). about $100. after
       that, would recommend roof rack: better security. also said some
       states wouldn't like front racks. said that rear hatch racks were
       not too secure (could be unbolted and run away with). said you wanted
       to carry only two bikes per rack (except for roof rack) ... otherwise
       too heavy.



A pretty neat set up I've seen amounts to what would (essentially) be a
Yakima rack mounted vertically on the rear hatch (I think this application
is more appropriate for a Vanagon), such that the bikes would mount
vertically from the rack (forks clamped near the roof, rear wheels resting
near the bumper, with the saddle extending 30-40&quot; away from the plane of the
hatch.  I believe this set up requires use of the mounting clamps normally used
with vehicles with aircraft-style doors because of the footpads that you want
to have resting against the hatch and sheetmetal.
I hope this helps.  Like joel said, &quot;Good luck&quot;...
Norman
ps-I like this set up because you don't have to be an NBA center to stick the
damn bikes on the rack....heck, I have enough trouble washing/waxing the
roof!....
