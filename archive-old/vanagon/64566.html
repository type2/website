Subject: HEAVY  Duty Shocks

I've watched and waited but lately, no one has brought up shocks--So here
goes.       My creame puff 84 Westy needs a more stable ride, she needs to
toughen up a bit!        I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific
shocks.  I would like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions
and have a frugal budget.

********************
I am somewhat remiss in updating the list so here goes.

An update to the Bigger/Better shocks for the Syncro crowd.  Some traffic did
cross the list a couple of weeks ago, heres a synopsis of that info and where
I am with the search.

Some good info has been gathered, and I remain commited to finding out WHO the
OEM manufacturer of the &quot;N&quot; suffix part is, hopefully so that I can get it
easier/less expensive from the manufacturer, rather than order from VW Germany
or from Peter Seikel.  (Although Peter does come very highly recommended)

The shock for the rear is the same as for the standarsd van.  The shock for
the front of a SYNCRO has a spring perch on it, and is stiffer than stock non
Syncro's.  I do know that Bilstein does not make for the SYNCRO front, KONI
does not build a shock for the SYNCRO front, and Sachs/Boge builds only the
&quot;C&quot; suffix which is the softest available from VW.  The &quot;C&quot; suffix is
available from VW America, and better prices can be found with Ron Salmon at
the Bus Depot.   &lt;www.busdepot_dot_com&gt;

1. Basically, of the three factory front shocks for Vanagon Syncro, all are
identical in dimensions and are progressively stiffer from suffix C to
suffix M to suffix N.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
front shock:    251 413 031 C   regular
                           251 413 031 M        14'' HD package &quot;Schlechtwegepaket&quot;
                           251 413 031 N        16''

rear shock:     251 513 031 D   regular
                         251 513 031 M  14'' HD package
                         251 513 031 N  16''

2. Peter Seikel is happy to sell these and says the N style was the factory
option for the years 90 and 91 for 16&quot; Transporters. Seikel says the springs
he sells are much stiffer than the factory springs and are also progressive
rate. He said the factory springs are 75 kios per 1cm spring rate whereas
his springs are 140 kilos per 1 cm. He says his heavy duty springs can fit
even a factory original C suffix shock absorber, so everthing fits together
in any combination, with no compatibility problems.

Peter Seikel in Freigericht near Frankfurt/Main recommends the &quot;N&quot; absorbers.
Seikel used to develop racing and off-roading suspensions for all kinds of VW
and Audi also the T3 syncros he is probably the most experienced person about
these items. Give him a call or better a fax it is worth while. He also offers
reinforced coil springs for the T3 syncro.

        Front shock DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair

projektzwo sells mostly show stuff, but does have some rather nifty fender
flairs and brush bars and a lift kit for Syncro's using the stock stiffer &quot;N&quot;
shocks, and hey, it's a real flashy brochure.  You could drool over the thng
for hours, and it's only 3 pages, double sided.

A local contact for projektzwo is VW Sports - 703-451-5134  Springfield VA

*************
That's all I know now.  I continue to look for the OEM for the &quot;N&quot; suffix, and
will probably just break down and get from Seikel in the near future.  (that
is if I can get ahold of Derek Drew and ask him how you order overseas.  I'm a
bit nervous about that, never having done it before.)
