Subject: Passed Emissions

Hi everyone, 

Well today i took my 87' Syncro for the dreaded emission inspection. It
passed without any problems!!  Last year I had to get waived because it
failed so badly.  I replaced my air flow box with a used one from a 91'
vanagon.  This appears to have been the problem. The control unit was
receiving incorrect information and proceeded to inject loads of fuel causing
it to run extremely rich.  I am now exempt for two years.
                                      
Final readings          HC       31.9  ppm              CO%    0 .11

Allowable (CT)          HC      150.0 ppm              CO%    1.00 

Mike
