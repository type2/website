&gt; The brake lights on my 79 bus do not light up until the pedal is pushed 
&gt; about 1/2 way to the floor (long after the brakes have actually engaged). 
&gt; The braks work great otherwise, I just want the person behind me to know 
&gt; that they work too. Is the fix as simple as changing the two switches on 
&gt; the master cylinder? If so, does brake fluid squirt out if the swithces 
&gt; are removed? Finally, if I am on the right track to fix this problem, 
&gt; does anyone know where to get these switches (GEX perhaps)?

If the sender switches look bad, I would go ahead and replace them. They
are only a few dollars each. Incidentally, those senders are almost
completely VW universal, if you can't find them for a bus or bug, ask
for Jetta or Golf. At least the early years for those models are the
same part numbers. No fluid will squirt out, although you will get some
drips. IMPORTANTLY, however, make sure you bleed your brakes after
replacing them, as you have let air into the system. Could be that's all
that's necessary anyway, if the system is kinda squishy...
Anyway, Ijust replaced pretty much the entire brake system on my
girlfriend's bug; it was relatively easy.
