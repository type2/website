&gt; I have been looking for a bike rack for the back hatch of a 1993

&gt; glass window which I don't trust or attach somehow off the frame and
&gt; block the hatch from opening.  I don't want one on top because it is too
&gt; high.  I recently saw a bike rack on a Eurovan that attached to the top
&gt; and bottom of the hatch. The owner said the rack had been purchased fro
&gt; the VW dealer in Vancouver BC.  The VW dealer in Santa Barbara where I
&gt; live had never heard of it.  Does anyone have information on VW bike
&gt; racks?  Send information to Steve Mack, email address sbwater_at_rain_dot_org.

You wouldn't know what dealer would you?  I'm also looking for a bike rack 
for my bus.  I was considering mounting the spare tire on the front since I 
already have a spare tire rack that holds 3 bikes but I would prefer having 
the bikes in the back.  

Are you saying that you can open the hatch with this rack in place?  That 
would be great!  Of course I realize this _could_ only be possible when there 
are no bikes on the rack.

If you have any more info on the one you saw, I can call the local dealers (I 
think there are about 8 in the lower mainland) and ask questions and maybe 
get a phone number for the manufacturer or distributer.
