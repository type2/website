Subject: Re: New Jersey emissions law (was: Why are so many....)


&gt;(California has a weird emissions law that becomes more lax with the age of
&gt;the auto.  The annoying side effect is that there are lots of old cars on
&gt;the road which legally put out as much smog as 10 newer cars.)

Like, say a VW bus.................
