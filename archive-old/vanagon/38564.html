&gt;&gt; maybe, just maybe, heating an area of the condensor with a heat gun,
&gt;&gt; heat lamp, or judicious use of a propane torch would drive the system
&gt;&gt; pressure high in one area and maybe force the blockage thru... kinda
&gt;&gt; like passing a kidney stone.
&gt;
&gt;Dan,  I, too,  thought of using the propane torch, but have so far 
refrained
&gt;from it for fear of damaging/burning anything. But your suggestion now
&gt;encourages me to try after all. Unless, of course, somebody on the list
&gt;comes up with a good reason for why this should not be done.

Try a hair dryer first, if you're within range of a suitable outlet.
A propane torch will definitely make it an offer it can't refuse.
