I thought this one sounded familiar, it was up for sale a month ago (2/27)
and they've come down $799 since then.  Looks like they've been trying for
a while, they may come down again.

Bargain of the week for Syncro wannabees. Also, the '86 listed would be a
good deal too, especially if the 'moonroof' is the factory sunroof.
Instant Westy conversion possibility.  Tim
