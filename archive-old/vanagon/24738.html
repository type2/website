Subject: non-stock crank bearings for 2.0L

Hello all,

I got a call from the local machine shop yesterday.  They can't find
oversized crank bearings for 2.0L.  I was going to have them align-bore the 
case and grind the crank ($900 seemed a little steep for a short block),
but am unsure how to proceed - told them I would consult the experts.

If these questions appear in the archives/somebody's home page then I
apologize in advance.  Thanks for the advice and the entertainment.  It's
been a real learning experience and a pleasure.  You guys and gals are
already famous here at the office.

[questions]

1.  Does anybody (in general) align-bore the 2.0L (air cooled)?

	If YES, are non-stock crank bearings available?  
	Am I asking for trouble?  It's a pretty expensive way
	to find out the quality of align-bores from the local machine
	shop, but OTOH it's _much_ cheaper than going the GEX route.

	If NO, do all the ovalized/junk cases get shipped somewhere to be 
	built up and align-bored back to stock specs?

2.  Does anyone know where I can find a used (&lt;100K miles?) 2.0L block?

3.  Any advice on which carburator(s)/manifold setup to use?  I will not
    be using the FI.

4.  Where are the archives?

Thanks,

Paul
