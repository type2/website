&gt;I am looking for a rebuilt generator for my '71 bus.  The books say I 
&gt;need the ....17x version which is 3/8&quot; longer than the ....15x.  The 
&gt;15x is widely available for about $55 rebuilt.  The cheapest I can 
&gt;find the 17x is about $110.  Unless this is wrong or there is a way to
&gt;get the 15x to work in my bus I am going to spring for the alternator 
&gt;kit and be done with it.  Also, would like to hear of sources for $55 
&gt;rebuilt 17x generators.

The fan housing mounting plate is the difference.  You will also need to
repalce this with the alternator conversion.  Personally, I prefer the
alternator.
