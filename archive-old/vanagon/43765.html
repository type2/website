while being a convert to the &quot;cult of duct tape&quot; i also definately sing the
virtues of a red coloured tape (sorry no name brand that i can think of)
that is used to tape together &quot;vapor barriers&quot; in houses. Sorry for the
lack of technical name but if you are in a hardware store buy some this
tape, it STICKS!!!! it is very expensive but well worth it. when my bumper
on my honda was about to fall off i taped it back on with this tape and it
held for many months

just my $0.02
