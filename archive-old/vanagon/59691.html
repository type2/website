Leonard has developed some bizzare technique whereby he floats the 
corrosion out of the pits using the TIG as he welds them up.  
Apparently he can rework very badly damaged heads.  But at a pretty 
fair price, about $250 last I checked, still a lot less than new.  
Even the guys at Stephens will steer you toward AVP for wasserboxer 
head work.
