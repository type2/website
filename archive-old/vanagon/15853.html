&gt;&gt;    Anyone know if the camper stuff will fit my '75?

depends how much hacking you want to do to fit the stuff in. if you want
100% stock, obviously this isn't it. IT seemed that every few years, Westy
moved the interior around. 75' and 71 Westy interiors are fairly different
. 1975 lost the linen closet on the back pass area, and gained some more
cabinetry behind the drivers side.

Also the pop tops changed from popping up in the rear to popping open at
the front. Starting in 74' the upstairs gained a two person slleping berth.
This was accomplished by cutting out a large section of the curved roof and
replacing it with a flat piece of plywood(?) masonite or something like
that. This was done so you wouldn't be sleeping on a curved bed.
