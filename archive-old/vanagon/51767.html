Subject: Type II Manual and Literature Database update

Hey all!

Sean just mailed me the other day with an update to the above list, and I
thought I'd remind the rest of you that this information exists.  For those
of you not familiar, a year or so ago, I began compiling a list of who has
what manuals for VW busses.  Mostly it's owner's manuals or Westfalia
camping equipment supplements, but there are a fair number of other manuals
as well.  The idea is that if you're looking for a copy of a manual, these
people have said they're willing to make a copy of theirs, in trade for a
copy of another manual or for copying fees.  Paul Retherford volunteered to
post a copy on his WWW page:  http://www.infocom_dot_com/~paulr/vw  I used to
post the entire &quot;database&quot; to the lists every now and then, but it's kind of
long so this provides a more convenient means of access.  Check it out!
