    2.  The drain holes in my sunroof don't drain.  I tried to blow the
    blockage out with air hose, which I thought got all the crud out,
    but the driver side failed my water test.  I suspect the drain tube
    got rusted into the passenger compartment.  The water flows in
    through the seat belt mount bolt on the pillar, and any where else
    it feels like coming through the headliner.  I came up with the
    idea of running a flexible plastic tube down the hole and seal it
    to the edge of the drain hole with silicon sealer.  When I got
    about 3ft of hose down the hole, I noticed it came right through
    the headliner(one more hole to patch) and was wrapped around the
    steering wheel.  Had to give up to go to work.  Any other possible
    remedies?

I think that the front roof drains *are*
plastic tubing threaded down the column,
at least mine are.  If that is standard,
and how would I know, yours may just be
lying there disconnected at the top.

BTW, I never use air to blast mine (which
are still sound); I use the hand-held gun
at the do-it-yourself-carwash and it works
just great.  

You can just close the roof and use duct
tape to seal it...  (been there, done that)
