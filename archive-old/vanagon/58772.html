Subject: Re: Canvas roof carrier

Chris -
	If you are talking about some kind of zippered case that would fit
inside the roof carrier on a Westy, I would certainly have some interest.
I have used a cheap plastic container that is low-profile, but not too good,
for a year. The top doesn't hook down and placing bungies appropriately is
a challenge. We ended up having to tie it on with far too much rope when
we were out west in windy areas.
	Are these people on the Web? Do you have any &quot;pictures&quot; of what
this might look like? Would like more details.

Thankx-
	Kenyon

&gt; Dear list members,
&gt; A local (SLC, UT) canvas factory-store makes a really nice heavy-weight
&gt; canvas car-top carrier for $56.  Trouble is, none of their stock
&gt; sizes is perfect for fitting my '84 Westie luggage rack.  They will
&gt; custom make one for me for around $112.  At first I thought that was
&gt; too steep but calling around I find similar products of lower quality
&gt; and misfit for $100 and up.  So I have two questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Does anyone know a better source for a good quality soft car-top
&gt;    carrier that will fit the Westie luggage rack?  I saw one mention
&gt;    of something in the archives but no follow up.  What do people
&gt;    use to cover stuff up there?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) The factory-store said the price would come down if I ordered
&gt;    10 or more but I don't have a firm quote yet.  Is anyone interested 
&gt;    in these?  I'd be happy to relay more information if there is an
&gt;    interest.
&gt;    
&gt; Thanks,
