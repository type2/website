Hi Jon,

&gt; Hi All,

&gt; Assuming that this is an American model, a regular hose cap should fit

&gt; mine was unscrewed during shipment and fell off during delivery.  I discovered 
&gt; that in order to replace it, at that time, I would have had to replace the 
&gt; whole sink drain assembly (really stupid situation) in order to get just that 
&gt; plug.  I went down to the local H/W store and got a cap that fit perfectly and 
&gt; voile'...
&gt; 

Been there, tried that.  It (the drain) has a metric thread.  If you 
could look at the cap you have and let me (us) know what it says re
pipe thread info that might help with the search.

Thanks.
