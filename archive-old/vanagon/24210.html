Subject: RE: more bug o rama - BUSGIRL



&gt;Anyway, there was a split bus with &quot;BUSGIRL&quot; plates.  Did a double
&gt;take, and then a doule check, to make sure Martha wasn't holding out
&gt;on us :-).  Nope, somebody else...


Had to be. Martha's would have had a /  (slash) as first character.
