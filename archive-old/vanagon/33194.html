     Awkwardly pursuing a young art student, I offered to help
     rebuild the blown engine on her circa '65 bug.

     She kept her end of the deal, staying by my side through the
     consulation with St. Muir, removal, diagnosis, trips
     to the machine shop, reassembly and installation.

     But it would not start. Cranked like a dream but not a pop.
     Gas ok, spark ok. Hmmm.._dot_compression? Essentially none
     in all cylinders! Second round of removal and disassembly, and I
     discovered I had reversed all four compression rings!

     Doh! Back together again, and it ran just fine, but she didn't
     stick around. Bad compression = bad impression.
