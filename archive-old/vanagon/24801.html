Subject: Waterboxer Madness

Now What - The VW dealer won't even sell me a rebuilt waterboxer because of
all the problems they've had with them.  I.E. - leaks, cracked heads,
bearings.  When you need a new engine and the dealer won't even sell you one,
it's a pretty sad state of affairs.  The parts manager even recomended using
a air-cooled vanagon motor or getting the mounts from a diesel and installing
a GTI motor.

I think we've been had on this waterboxer motor.  Let's file a class action
suit against Volkswagen.
