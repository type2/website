Subject: License plate frames - interest?

As far as personalized license plate frames go:  I have a friend who 
I kindly refer to as 'the key chain king of Western Canada'.  He has 
all the goods to make personalized key chains, license plate frames, 
t-shirts etc.  I spoke with him and he said he could put together 
anything we may need.  If anyone is interested in doing something 
like this let me know and we can find out how much it will all cost, 
or if you want you could contact him directly (Jim) at the following 
email address:  batten_at_portal_dot_ca

cheers,

brian.




&gt; I ordered a set with my email address. Perhaps I should have put
&gt; &quot;Vanagon.Internet.List&quot; or something like that since my email address will
&gt; surely change some day (I starting to hanker for a 128K ISDN line).
&gt; Moreover, there's no indication that I'm on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, anybody on our list who saw a &quot;drew_at_interport_dot_net&quot; licence plate
&gt; would know I was on the list, wouldn't they?
