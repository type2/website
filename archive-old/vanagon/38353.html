Subject:  air mass sensor: 84 westy

i'm thinking of getting a new, remanufactured air mass sensor from
Adirondack Auto Brokers...it is NOT a Bosch, and cost $125.00...
does any one know if these are any good? 
the real NEW Bosch one is $235, is it worth it?

(my current one is beyond adjusting the wiper)

thanks

alan, 84 westy
