Subject: compression to high?


Someone wrote that 135 is high for compression and overkill?  I had my   
compression checked yesterday and it was 145, 142, 140 , 138 can't   
remember the order but I thought high compression was good.  Seems good   
in by bus.  I have shaved heads and Total Seal rings on my 74 westfalia   
and with 40mm Dell carbs my 1.7 liter motor it will get up and go pretty   
good!  What is the deal?  I am in digest mode so if someone wants to   
e-mail me direct that would be great.  ESOWDER_at_RFMD.COM
Also looking forward to the buses on the blue ridge event in Asheville   
the end of May.  I wish I could go to the other events but they are a   
little to far.  Thanks

Erick
