I would be interested in hearing details of price and exactly
what components are included in the conversion kits. I own an 81
Vanagon with a 78 Porsche six, but if I get a newer, watercooled
Vanagon I would only consider watercooled engines for the
conversion.
 
 
 
I am confident that many on the Type2 and especially the Vanagon
list would be interested in knowing the details.  Thanks for
your offer.
