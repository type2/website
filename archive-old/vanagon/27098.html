 &gt; &gt;  a man on the Slick 50 stand 
 &gt; &gt; impressed me with his display of engines parts that had survived extreme 
 &gt; &gt; overheating because they had the Slick 50 treatment.
 &gt; I used slick 50 on a rebuild that had its crank split into two pieces 
 &gt; after 15,000. 

You can read an alternate view of Slick 50 at: 
  http://www.ssc.upenn_dot_edu/~awhite/Interests/Motorcycle/Snake-oil.txt
 
It's the text of the article &quot;Snake Oil! Is That Additive Really A Negative?&quot; 
by  Fred Rau that appeared in the motorcycle magazine ROAD RIDER's August 1992 
issue.

A telling couple of paragraphs to whet your appetite:
--------------
 The problem with putting PTFE in your oil, as explained to us by 
several industry experts, is that PTFE is a solid. The additive makers 
claim this solid &quot;coats&quot; the moving parts in an engine (though that is 
far from being scientifically proven). Slick 50 is currently both the 
most aggressive advertiser and the most popular seller, with claims of 
over 14 million treatments sold. However, such solids seem even more 
inclined to coat non-moving parts, like oil passages and filters. After 
all, if it can build up under the pressures and friction exerted on a 
cylinder wall, then it stands to reason it should build up even better in 
places with low pressures and virtually no friction.
   This conclusion seems to be borne out by tests on oil additives 
containing PTFE conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center, which said 
in their report, &quot;In the types of bearing surface contact we have looked 
at, we have seen no benefit. In some cases we have seen detrimental 
effect. The solids in the oil tend to accumulate at inlets and act as a 
dam, which simply blocks the oil from entering. Instead of helping, it is 
actually depriving parts of lubricant.&quot;
