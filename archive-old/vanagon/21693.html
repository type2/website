Subject: Re: Tire Questions re: Steve's response


EDITORIAL:	

I would generally agree with Steve's observations regarding the handling 
of passenger tires versus reinforced sidewall (aka &quot;LT&quot;) tires.  I had 
passenger tires for four years on my '70 Kombi.  They performed well 
under all conditions.  

I now have &quot;d&quot; rated tires, which have 8-plys.  They're pretty stiff, and 
combined with the new heavy-duty gas shocks, the ride is fairly firm.  Now, 
that's the way I like it, natch YMMV.  The roads here are pretty sketchy, in 
general, worse in the rural areas (about 95% of the state) so maybe 
there's a bit more of a need to have a stiffer tire.  I'm usually hauling 
about 750-1000lbs of cargo (sheesh, that's me and 3 other humans(!)

GENERAL:  tire info (mine--but feel free to add/ignore): ;-)

1	Passenger:  2-4 ply, a &quot;softer&quot; ride, if you will
2	Reinforced Passenger:	A little thicker, probably corners better
3	&quot;C&quot; load tires:	6-ply, stiffer, rides a little rougher (when 
	jacked up to max. pressure; 
4	&quot;D&quot; load tires:  8-ply, much stiffer, can put pressure at 65 psi (!)
	aka &quot;LT&quot; tires

FOR BAYWINDOZE:  The tire info (so sez Bentley):

1	All models thru July 1971:  7.00x14 8 PR (bias ply--?)

2	Campmobile from August 1971; Delivery Van and Station 
	Wagon...thru 1972:  185 SR 14 Reinforced (&quot;correct replacement 
	tire must bear word REINFORCED...max press 40 psi&quot;)

3	Delivery Van and Station Wagon from April 1972:  185R x 14C 
	(&quot;correct replacement tire must bear the letter C...max press 
	= 55psi&quot;)

SO, if you're a hard-cornering, fast-lane-changing, 
rough-road-riding-with-full-load kind of bus-guy or bus-gal, maybe go 
with the thicker tire.

Good Luck!
