Speaking of Mark Johnson,....did anyone catch the reference to him on
rec.autos.vw? It mentioned among other things that he is a child molester
and wanted by the law and that under no circumstances should you give him
any personal information.._dot_can anyone verify this (since he was on the
list)? Should we be concerned- he tried to sell me a Vanagon gas heater
for 100 bucks and then backed out at the last minute. Is he just
someone's weird fantasy or what? DC --
