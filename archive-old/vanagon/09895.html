So James Brill says:
&gt; line has the [f] mark I will tell a short story.  They drained or 
&gt; flushed the hot water pipes on campus here this week.  From the 
&gt; newspaper it sounds a little like bleeding a Vanagon coolant system.  
&gt; Anyways, they forgot to close a few valves before they cranked things 
&gt; back up.  $100,000 damage to one building alone.  The other one they 
&gt; haven't gotten into yet until they are sure about asbestos, etc.  It 
&gt; is the one that most of the net stuff and mainframes on campus.  That 
&gt; is why I was off line part of yesterday.  :(
&gt; -- 

I got a question James.  How much trouble was it for them to jack up
one end of the building 18.4 inches?  And which end is the front? ;)
