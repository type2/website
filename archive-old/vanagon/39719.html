&gt;I saw a picture of a used car piercing once.  There was this great big stake
&gt;sticking out of the ground with several used cars pierced on it.

i thought he was talking about the constellation Used Car, with it's most
prominent star, Pirces, named after the great hero of Greek Mythology who
went riding around on the winged horse (who later worked for Mobil Oil
company as their logo). actually, i think it's spelled &quot;Ustkar&quot; or something
like that.
