Subject: two questions
Date: Thu, 19 Jun 1997 08:20:27 -0400

I apologize if these issue has already been addressed on this list (I'm
a newcomer).  

1. I saw a picture of a tent attached to a '72 Westy at www.vanagon_dot_com,
and I wondered if this was an original item, and if so, what model years
it came with.  Are they still available, and would they fit a '75?

2. Has anyone shipped their bus to Europe (or other overseas
destination) in order to travel in it, and then bring it back.  I wonder
if this would be cost-effective for a long-term trip (i.e. 6 months or
more).  Also, are there regulations/permits that must be adhered to????

&gt;
&gt;I had a fire in my '75 Westy two summers ago, and the pop-top canvas had
&gt;to be replaced.  After pricing new (and used) ones, I decided to have
&gt;one made.  A shop here in Toronto that makes boat covers made one for me
&gt;for $500 Cdn (about $350 U.S.) with double stitching, extra side
&gt;windows, removable velcro bug screens, etc, etc..  They made it out of
&gt;the same heavy-duty canvas that they make boat covers out of, and not
&gt;only is it waterproof, but they tell me it's mould-proof as well.  I
&gt;thought about having the cover made out of tent fabric (more
&gt;lightweight), but thought the canvas would stand up better over the long
&gt;haul.   Just wanted to highlight this as an attractive option (and a
&gt;low-cost one at that!)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A buddy of mine is in the market for a new (not vintage) canvas awning to
&gt;&gt;fit his '77 Westy.  Any feedback on brands, distributors, etc. is welcome.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Help me help this man ...
