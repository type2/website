Subject: Re: burning plastic

 I do agree with you about the unnecessary bickering and the &quot;I won't camp
with you&quot; attitude.  We all really ought to put this behind us.

The initial post from Martha was a request for information, essentially
saying &quot;I don't know the dangers of burning plastic, but enlighten me and
I'll stop this practice.&quot;
Marthas Post: &quot;This subject has come up a few times in the past during
campouts,
but apparently we offended one listmembers enough this past trip
to cause her to cry.  I'd like to hear from you all (without
this turning into some horrible emotional frenzy), especially
scientific types like Joe, Ann, etc., who may have factual info
to enlighten us.&quot;
This request (see above) has been taken by others and blown out of all
proportion. Over and over I have heard &quot;I don't know any of you and I wasn't
at Fremont peak&quot;  right before they launch into a tirade on how stubborn or
inconsiderate Martha is. What is most ironic is that it is her efforts to be
considerate that lead her make that initial post.
There were a few responses, Ann's in particular, that answered the questions
logically and scientifically. I myself have tried with limited success to
limit my responses to the science of burning plastic. 
So many who weren't there have written so much about Martha's character or
lack thereof. Those who were at the campout but not actually at the fire ring
when these exchanges took place have also made numerous comments without
 actually having been there to know what happened. If you were to ask the
people who were at the fire ring at that time you will find that:
1) Martha never said that she would burn plastic no matter what.
2) She never threw any one out of the group. She did however suggest that she
herself might have to burn her plastics elsewhere, and likewise if others
could not tolerate the practices of the group, they could protect themselves
by not attending.
3) Martha, like most of us, was also unaware that her comments had driven
someone to tears. The identity of this person was also not known to her.
4) Almost all the others who were at the fire ring during the conversation
agree with Martha, and do not understand why this issue is being exploded by
people who weren't even there. Just look at their posts.

As Martha has long since agreed to not burn plastics, what is the point of
all this. Is this Political Correctness run amuck, or is there an underlying
current here. Is this a personal vendetta against Martha? Or is she just a
convenient scape goat. Why all the personal attacks? Many of us burned
plastic, but have not been attacked (this is not an invitation :). 
I realize that what I have said does not fit the thinking of the &quot;mob
mentality&quot; and I have probably opened myself up to personal attacks.

I had hoped that this issue had gone away, but as it lingers, I have to ask,
are we all so sensitive that we are attacking each other over the burning of
a few plastic bags. Conversely, how is that we have all become so hard
hearted that only one of us wept over the same issue.

Just trying to steer us to reality and back together.............. JoE
