Martha and others, here's the info on the book:

Manifold Destiny: The One! The Only! Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine!,
Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller; Villard Books, New York 1989; 113 pp.;
ISBN 0-679-72337-4  $7.95

This describes the techniques in great detail and provides such great
recipes as Merritt Parkway Veal Scallopine, Thruway Thighs, and Out
of the Fire, Onto the Engine Stew.  I haven't tried to do any engine
cooking yet, but considering that the Vanagon engine is probably the
perfect layout for the job, I've got to give it a try on my next trip!
