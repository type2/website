So Jack Agnew says:

&gt; I have an '86 Westy and we love it and travel extensively in it. As any 
&gt; of you that have Westys know, storage is an absolute premium, so we want 
&gt; to use the roof-top storage area above the driver/passenger area to its 
&gt; maximum benefit.
&gt; We have looked everywhere to find a carrier/cover that fits and even 
&gt; wrote to Westfalia in Germany (no answer), but no one seems to make such 
&gt; a thing. 
&gt; It would be wonderful if someone made a plastic, weatherproof, enclosure 
&gt; that fit there, had tie downs that match the cleats in the top, and the 
&gt; whole thing opens to the rear facing the popup opening. 
&gt; Does anyone know if there is such a thing?
&gt; We have seen a lot of different 'sort-of-work' solutions that different 
&gt; folks have tried, but nothing that seems to be a really good solution.
&gt; Hope smeone has a lead. - Thanks - Jack

I think what we use is just what you're looking for.  It's kind of like a
big sports bag.  It was sold as a car top carrier but fits the VW one just
fine.  It has 6 tie downs or straps sewn into it that you run throught the 
cleats and then pass through a plastic locking mechanism that cinches it
tight.  It's a bit of a pain to get it set up, but once its done, your
stuff is safely zipped inside from rain.  There's also a flap around the
zipper that snaps shut to cover the zipper.  It's the best I've fine so
far to handle the various packing up top configurations.  I'll have to
check it out at home to get more specifics.  I think we got it at Price
Club.
