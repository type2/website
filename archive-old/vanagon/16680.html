Subject: Maytag Parts Washer

Hi folks,

I scored a neat tool (appliance) on the way home this evening that could be 
viewed as VW related...  Driving my usual route home I saw in front of an 
old house an old white porcenalized, what looked to me like a parts washer. 
 I inspected it and found out that it was a 194? Maytag Gyratator clothes 
washer (with a built on motorized wringer.  The neat thing is that it looks 
like a perfect parts washer (with a little modification).  It looks just 
like one of those metal parts washing containers--it stands on four legs 
about 3 feet high and looks like the perfect size for crankshafts, heads, 
and just about any mechanical part I'd have to clean on my bus.  When I was 
hoisting it into my bus an older gentleman came out of a nearby house to 
tell me that it worked just fine and that the owner was just getting rid of 
it to buy a bigger machine!!  I didn't have the heart to tell him its fate, 
but I did mention that I would put it to good use!

I've been looking it over now and I feel a little bad about converting this 
proud old machine into a parts washer.  But at least it will still be 
washing something...I guess it's like converting a splitty into a chicken 
coupe.  Maybe 20 years from now someone will be restoring my parts washer 
for a Maytag show.
