well, i'm gonna be gone thursday and friday (maybe) so i thought i'd dump
these on everybody while i had the chance. and, besides, it's november and
i haven't begged and pleaded with the Unknowns to jump in and join a
model year. :)  we need a 57 bus, a 65 bus, and about 16 breadloafs (that
would put them up to 100!). i'd love to see over 50 microbuses, but i'm
afraid that might be wishful thinking. :(  and you eurovans need ONE more
to make it up to ten.                                                   1430
