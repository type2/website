&gt;
&gt;With all due respect, why replace an otherwise perfectly good set of heads
&gt;just because of worn guides?  New guides are not that expensive and a shop
&gt;can install them.  Better than risking trading good heads in on ones with
&gt;possible defects - or new ones for mucho $$.  IMO, of course...

How much would the shop charge?  The new guides are not expensive, but the
price of putting them in might be.  Assuming that there is no gross defect
with the original valve guides that had caused them to fail prematurely, by
the time your guides are worn the heads have had a long service life, say,
50,000+ miles.  All air-cooled VW cylinder heads are prone to cracking
after experiencing thousands of heat cycles and need to be inspected and
welded, especially the Type I heads.  After 50,000+ miles, the exhaust
valves probably need to be replaced too.

If the cylinder heads have been in use for a long time, they probably need
to be rebuilt if engine problems indicate a problem with the heads.  If you
can find a machinist that does good work, then GREAT!  Some parts of the
U.S., like So. California, have many such places.  Where I live, the
machinists look at you with a glazed-eye expression when you mention old VW
heads.  I find it better to trade in the old heads for a reconditioned set,
WITH a guarantee.

IMHO,
Wolf
