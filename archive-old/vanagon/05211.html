Hi folks.

My sister is expecting twins which will boost her family from 3 persons to five
at one fell swoop.

She and her husband have decided that they want a VW van, an older model, but
they have not been able to locate one at any of the car dealerships around the
PIttsburgh area.

Does anyone out there have any for sale or know of a good place to find one? 
You can email me direct if you wish.
