Tim,

  You mentioned &quot;a circulation problem, my '87 Syncro creeps up in temp 
at standing idle, but front heater temp output actually goes down.  I 
have to rev the engine to push hot coolant up to front heater in 
winter/parked_at_idle or I start blowing very cold air. But rear heater 
always warm at idle due to shorter pipes thus less flow constriction.&quot;

  You may risk being flamed by Jim Davis (Syncrohead address) for 
suggesting that those Vanagon long water coolant pipes impose any 
meaningful flow restriction as your experience report clearly 
illustratates they do.  He estimated that they account for no more than 
2% of the system's restriction, and comment or evidence to the contrary 
has put him into personal attack mode rather than address this issue.  
I'm sending this message only to you as a personal note and not to any 
other list member in case you'd like to know that you're shining a light 
on a truth that some don't want to be recognized.  Just beware that Mr. 
Davis may have his ego attached to VW design and if he notices what 
you've said, may decide to attack you.  Please do not cite any of this 
note on the list as I'd prefer to only deal with VW issues rather than 
this curious behavior.

	Respectfully,
	John Wakefield
