Subject: Re: Extra Storage Space

just don't try to go thru any borders... 'cause you'll be sitting a
LONG Time..... Customs guys have Zero sense of humor... when It comes to
neat extra storage... and they aren't very nice even if you tell them
'bout such stuff... Bus/Van will literally torn to shreds to try and
find where you really hide the Dope...

	had an uncle who was head of Customs station at NY border...

	He Loved seeing VWs coming back from Canada... would stop them for
Hours just to be an A#*hole...

	stopped me more than once... just 'cause my hair was longer than he
liked...!!
