&gt;Ok,

&gt;        I've had a couple of replies on the 25hp vs 36hp
&gt;motor questions.  This much I knew going into it:
&gt;
&gt;        * The 25/36 hp motors both have the generator stand
&gt;built into the right half of the case
&gt;        * The 25/26hp motors both have the fuel pump on
&gt;the left side of the case with the big funky tube up to
&gt;the carb.
&gt;
&gt;        Now what else besides the case and the fuel pump
&gt;and a few cc's of displacement do they have?  Or is it just an
&gt;internal difference like the 1500 vs 1600?
&gt;
&gt;        What is the displacement of the 25/36 horse motors?
&gt;something like 1100, isn't it?

Thom:

Yes the displacement of the 36hp motor is 1100cc.  I am not totally
positive about the 25hp motor.  One of the things that I have noticed
about the 36hp motor that I have is the rocker arms.  The rocker arms
are the same for both the intake and exhaust.  In the later engines
the rocker arms are made at different angles for the intake and exhaust
valves.  In fact there are many stuble differences between the 36hp and
later motors.  I know that not too many people around the area know too
much about the older motors (I have yet to find a comprehensive book on
the 36hp motor).  I am kinda lucky to have some of the resources that
I have..... a good friend works with this Porche engine magician (makes
500hp race motors for later 930's, 962's, and such).  This magician 
knows some older fellows who have very thick German accents and know
everything about the older engines (prolly because they were selling VW's
and working on them here in the States in the late 50's and on).  So
if I run into any serious problems.... I can find solutions.  :-)
