Ron:

        It's disappointing to hear you say that. When you are in need 
of a battery boost or are mired in the mud, I hope that when you 
make that plea for help, that the person coming to your aid does not
interrogate you first to ascertain if your values, conduct or lifestyle 
are offensive to the rescuer before he/she decides whether or not to 
throw you that tow line.

        Here's a plea for help. Can't we just unconditionally help out?
