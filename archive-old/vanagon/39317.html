Subject: Major Parts Score!

        A guy down the street who does a lot of work on VWs and 914s came by
yesterday to tell me he was throwing away a bunch of stuff, and did I want
any of it.  I said I'd come take a look.

        Went by after work today.  He didn't really want to spend the time
to have me pick thru it all, so I said I'd take it all.  It was all boxed up
in milk crates: I literally filled the bus up, and there is stuff left.
Tons of stuff: alternators/generators, motor parts, eraly bug taillights,
mirrors, door handles, tin, yada yada.

        I'm going out right now to unload it all.  I won't catalog it, but
I'll make notes of the more interesting stuff.  I doubt I'll find any really
juicy bits in here, but there's a lot of common odds and ends.  I'll post
again when I get an idea what I have.
