&gt;Hello folks,
&gt;  As the countdown to crank-up approaches zero and road trips begin to get 
&gt;marked down on my calendar, I feel a need to get signed up with 
&gt;AAA....just in case I need one of those 100 mile tows.
&gt;
For a 100 mile tow be sure to get a &quot;PLUS&quot; membership.  A friend told me
about this optional upgrade to their standard membership.  It seems not to be
mentioned in any of their brochures or ads.  There are a couple of additional
benefits that come with the &quot;PLUS&quot; option including upgrading the towing
distance from 7 miles to 100 miles.  At least this is the way it works with
ther AAA of Southern California.  Other areas may have different plans.
