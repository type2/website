&gt; 
&gt; Some of you have turned to talk of swapping manuals and I'm
&gt; interested in getting an owner's manual for my '74 type II
&gt; and am willing to trade the '79 type II manual I have.  
&gt; I don't care if it's a xeroxed copy or not.  As a matter
&gt; of fact; are there any '79 owners out there that need a 
&gt; copy of that years owner's manual?  --Ralf

  I have both the '74 bus manual and the Westfalia manual. email me at 
  dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com with your snail mail address and tell me which
  one &lt;or both&gt; you want. I'll try and get to the xerox machine this weekend.
  Anyone else who wants one &lt;Michael Heron, I already have you down for a copy
  of the Westy manual&gt; speak up now, so I only have to go to Kinko's once.
