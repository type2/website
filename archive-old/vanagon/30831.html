Subject:       Shocking discovery

	Hey all:

I was exploring the deep recesses of my engine today when I came 
across a flat thick braded wire that had no plastic casing onit. The 
wire was coming off the engine. I assumed this to be a grounding 
wire. The wire had rotten in half, and I could not find the other 
half (Where it was grounded to).

I looked at the Bentley's manua l(The SF library is very protective 
of its car manuals) and could not find to where this wire goes. Also, 
what type of wire should I buy? (Is this a &quot;dealer only&quot;). 

My Saturday project is all set!

thanks,

Matt
