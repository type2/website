Subject: scooter car query


While at the Pescados fish taco vanagon/bus meet yesterday in Sacramento,
I got my first glimpse of something called a &quot;scooter car.&quot;  I only
saw it for a moment, but it was sorta like a motorcycle-sized thing,
but wrapped in a car body.  It had I think 2 wheels on the front,
and one on the back.  

I'm fascinated!  Does anyone know anything about these cars?  When
and where made?  STill available?  Specs?  Success?  I'm told there
may even be some sort of scooter club, either on the 'net or off.  

Anyway, any info you can give me I'll be very eager to get!

TIA,
