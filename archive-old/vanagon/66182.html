&gt;I'm thinking of possibly swapping a chev 2.8 V6 for my 2liter VW engine (

&gt;with few problems. My brother is a machinist and does not think an adapter
&gt;plate to mate engine and trans together will be a big deal. I'm concerned
&gt;about  cooling and the strength of the auto trans axle.Any help or
&gt;experience you may have on something  like this would be appreicated.
&gt;  My choice  of Chev V6 is its availability,it's compactness, and
&gt;relatively high horsepower(Approx 135 in X11trim).
&gt;Once again any help or advice would be welcomed.

I have the Kennedy Engineering flyer that offers suggestions on different
drivetrains for the Vanagon. (They make engine/transaxle adapters.) They
say the following:

&quot;Chevy 2800 60-degree V6: Citation, S-10, Jeep '79-'89 and 3100 90+ Chevy.
The S-10 is preferred for the VW because of the smaller distributor, better
motor mount locations on the block, and not computerized for '81-'83.
Weight 350 lbs; Length 24&quot;

also &quot;The V6 engines are tall enough to protrude above the engine cover as
much as 10&quot; which eliminates their choice for a camper.&quot;

Aparently one of the big problems in engine swaps, according to Kennedy, is
making sure that you have all of the wiring to the enginge computer. For
example, they do not have fun things to say about getting all of the wiring
to do a Subaru engine swap.
