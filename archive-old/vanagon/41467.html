GruBe Freunde!

A while back there was some discussion on different motors and their specs. 
Included in the list was a 1.9L Diesel that was available in one or two years
of Jetta.  I think the motor was called a bubble diesel or something.  Could
someone repost or tell me more about this motor.  Specifically, the specs on
the darn thing and what years they were produced........

I checked the archives.....but I found nothing! :-(

Thanks in advance!
