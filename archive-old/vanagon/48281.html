Subject: That California Law wont be signed....

Hey Volks!
        Someone reposted a note from someone dork at Dynamix (obvoiusly the
name does not reflect his personality), who was talking about the fact that
people should not be allowed to own a car older than twenty years.  Think
about it.  Remember the scare about shade-tree mechanics not being allowed
to work on their own cars?  Congress was considering at one time (and still
probably are to this day) making it illegal for ANYONE to work on cars,
EXCEPT the dealerships.  Gee, now why didn't that pass again? :) In
California, and the rest of the country for that matter, you cannot be held
liable for your tastes, and/or your inability to purchase a new car every
twenty years.  Cars in America are a staple of fashion, we need them of all
vintages to express ourselves.  Regardless of what some ding-dong believes,
Rush Limbaugh is not as popular he would like to believe. :) (That was meant
with good intentions, BTW).  Although mentioning it for discussion is good,
and we need to discuss this, it will not become a reality.  If it does, I
know where I will not be living, or driving. :)
