Subject: mexico bus in JCrew catalog

My girlfriend was flipping through a JCrew catalog and pointed out a bus 
to me (she's got the bug! :)) ANyway after a quick look I noticed the 
grill on the loaf and said &quot;hey...&quot; Anyway its in the new &quot;Vacation&quot; 
catalog on page 170 something.
