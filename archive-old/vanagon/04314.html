&gt; I hate to bring this thread up again, but I never did hear an answer to 
&gt; this question.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt; doors are for?  Should they be slid to the front or back to keep the air
&gt; flowing or warm the bus up?

I assume you mean the vents with the little blue sliders in them.  These
are for sucking the &quot;stale&quot; air out of the cab, and sending it somewhere
else.  Naturally, more air will flow from the vents on the dash if the door
vents are open.  If you have other holes in your van (door seals, window
seals, etc), these will also blow more air into the interior with the
vents open.

Joel has said in the past that his do nothing; since they are blocked
by the plastic vapor barrier in the door.  My '87 Syncro's vents work
great.  There's enough air flow when driving 60mph to suck out all the
smoke from a burning cigarette (when the cig is held somewhat near the 
vent).

On my '87, sliding forward opens the vent, sliding aft closes the vent.
