&gt;Sami, with timing belt envy.


Don't be jealous, you don't want one. It's how you connect the overhead cam 
that works your valves to the rest of the spinning parts on the motor. VW 
cams are in the bowels of the engine, and our humble pushrods do the same 
thing, just not so elegantly. Yes, and get your Hondas replaced if it's old, 
asap, you could bend a valve at least if it slips or breaks. My Civic ( 
arrgh!! a non german car) needed one at 60K miles. I think do-it-yourself is 
easy enough, if you DON'T let the camshaft or engine pulleys move AT ALL 
when installing.
