Subject:      FS: EV Winnebago 95

i don't recall who was looking at the EV Winnebago Rialta thingie, but i
saw this in the latest issue of RV Trader for the Alabama/N.Georgia:

1995 Winnebago Riatta 21', loaded w/gen, roof a/c, micro,
     only $32,995. call John Bleakley RV in Douglasville, GA
     (770) 949-4500 or (800) 949-4505

&lt;joel's note: yeah, that's the phone number .... i thought douglasville was
in area code 404, but maybe they've got a new one ... ??&gt;
