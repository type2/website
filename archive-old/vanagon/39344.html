Subject: Parts Score - Evaluation

        I spent a couple hours going thru all the parts.  A lot of it was
junk.  Tons on pushrod tubes, beat up engine tin, broken Super BEater
turnsignal lights, etc.

        Cool Stuff:

        3 early 60's taillights, with what I belive are glass lenses.
        1 elephant ear mirror
        1 late-50's-early -60's bug outside mirror.
        very, very early cast iron 009 distributor
        36hp distributor

        Now the prize:  a siren!  One of those electric motor with a vaned
flywheel jobs.  We hooked it up to my friends car battery and it WAILED!
Loads O' Fun!  Neighbors were running out of their houses to see what was
up!  He wants to buy it, I'm not sure I wanna sell it.  How much would
something like that be worth?

        Safety note!!!  Do not get your fingers near one of these things
while its rotating!!! I was sitting there BS'ing with the boyz and twirling
it with my hand ant it caught my finger but good!  OW!  Nasty cut!

        There's a bunch of miscellaneous mechanical stuff, mostly later
years.  A couple of cranks that were broken clean thru, a lot of type IV and
914 sheet metal bits, and a lot of JUNK.

        The other cool score in the mix were 2 radios.  One Sapphire I,
another Blaupunkt, MW LW with a 5 preset buttons, one marked
AUS, 2 with music notes, one with MW and one with LW.  And Idea what AUS
means?  I assume MW and LW to mean medium and long wave.
