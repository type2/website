Subject: Engine Cover Woes (74)

Hi all,
Here's a fun thing to try and fix:

The other day, after finally getting my bus to pass emissions (down from
9999 ppm in HC to 876 ppm) I busted the hinge on my engine cover.
Apparently these hinges have pins that run throught them, and after 22
years of Seattle rain (and yes, my window seals are in excellent
condition) the right one broke.  I have to wedge a piece of
feeler-guage into it to hold it up.

My advice to anyone with an older bus is to check the hinge *before* it
breaks, because it will be much easier to fix if it isn't already broken.
I am still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it looks like
drilling it out and running a bolt through the hinge is my best option,
without actually removing the entire hinge.
