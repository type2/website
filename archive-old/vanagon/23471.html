Joe, et al

I've seen a halon (?) kit that dumps the contents of two bottles onto the
engine, one nozzle above each head.  It's actuated by a D-ring.  One pull
pops the valves and they stay popped until the bottles are empty.  Pricey
(about $300) but cheap compared to the cost of an engine.  I wish I could
afford it.  I carry a hopeless little dry-foam bottle and a big bag of
marshmallows.   Knowing the hazards, I tend to pay a bit more attention to my
fuel fittings, hoping to catch the problem before it occurs.
