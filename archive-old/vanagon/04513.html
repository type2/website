&gt; How does the warp metric go?  Is Warp 8 just 8 times lightspeed, or more?
&gt;

Interesting, my learnin' tells me that if you go the speed of light, time
stops or distances along flight path become infinitly short so you get where
you're going instantly!  Of course this takes an infinite amount of energy...

I thought warp was something like a tunneling effect, you somehow go &quot;around&quot;
the lightspeed barrier and it turns out that going faster than light requires
less energy than going lightspeed. (*sci fi*)  Don't know what warp 8 means.

Then there is the problem of probability distributions, as the number of early
VW busses increases, the probability that one of them needs the valves
adjusted approaches one exponentially :-).

Babble babble...
