Scott Martel inquired about a child seat in the theater seats of an EV-MV:

I've thought about this myself for the same reasons that Ric pointed out.
However, if you read the child seat mfgr's manual, I seem to recall that
it warns against putting a child seat in a rear facing seat.  It might also
say that in the EV's owner's manual; I can't quite remember exactly
where I read that, but it is in print somewhere.

Our current arrangement has one seat in the front passenger and another
in the middle of the rear bench.  It seems to work out well for all
concerned.
