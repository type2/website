Subject: Push Rod Tubes

Hello all,

In an attempt to prepare my 84' Westy for an 8,000 mile loop around the
country, I brought it to my mechanic to have it thoroughly checked out.  His
diagnosis  was that the compression is fine, the pressure test on the
radiator is fine (even though it leaks  coolant out of the over flow
container?), but of course it has a oil leak (big surprise).   To fix this
oil leak (more like a slow drip) would involve replacing the valve cover
gaskets, replacing the push rod tubes &amp; seals, and adjusting the valves.
All this for the tune of $490.50.  I have little experience with this type
of thing, so I was wondering if this work is needed to fix an oil leak.  If
so does the price seem reasonable.
Also, I just noticed a ticking noise coming form under the dash, forward
toward the front of the van.  The ticking only occurs when I am driving over
25mph, and stops if I put the clutch in or slow down (i.e. no ticking when
I'm idling) .  I have checked  for things that could have been causing this
but have found nothing.  Could this have something to do with my radiator or
cooling fan?? It seems to be coming from that general area.
Not having a radio you notice all the little things!

Any help would be greatly appreciated :-)
