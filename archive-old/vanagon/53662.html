The cannon story reminds me of my '58 single cab pickup truck. Back 'round 
71 or 72 while working part time (and fixin VWs and going to College) at 
the local Sears Auto, I was asked to go to Providence RI (about 35 miles one 
way) and pick up a &quot;couple of tires&quot;. At that time, Sears was paying my 
hourly wage, PLUS $.25/mi...so off I went in my '58.

When I got to the Providence Sears Auto, a &quot;couple of tires&quot; ended up being 
100 TIRES!!!! Well needless to say, with a bit of rope, a bunch of tires in 
the storage compartment, a half dozen or so in the cab, and the rest in the 
back they all fit!

Off I went back to the Dartmouth store....36hp....and 100 tires....all I 
could manage was about 48 mph!

The '58 made it...although I seem to recall that the rear wheel arch was 
about in line with the VW emblem on the hub caps and the front steering was 
a bit &quot;light&quot;...   ;-)

Hey, it was a quick $16.50....enough to take m girlfriend out for &quot;dinner 
and a movie&quot;!  &lt;nudge...nudge...wink...wink&gt;
