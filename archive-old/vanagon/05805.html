Subject: What's happening to Fridays?


Are we all humored, poemed, haikued, or burned out or what? Fridays
used to be so much fun 'round here....now the only thing i have
to look forward to on fridays is Joel's list....&lt;sigh&gt;

Come on people, get with it...where's the songs, the mirth, the
picking on Martha's flannel shirts...

Does this mean I have to go to the book store to get a copy of
VW T&amp;A to get my jollies today????


A very bored Ric   :-(
