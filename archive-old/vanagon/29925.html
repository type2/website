&gt; &gt;advantages/disadvantages?

The only drawbacks I see to this is if the van is ever registered in a 
more stringent emissions State.  Here in Colorado the engine has to be 
in a stock configuration.  That means that if it originally came with 
fool injection components, it has to be restored to its previous state 
and pass emissions before a sticker is issued.  Other states that don't 
have the smog problems we have here are bound to be more lenient.

Just my $0.02.
