&gt;I do remember gear oil smelling of sulfur. But I'm still confused. If the 
&gt;&quot;GL&quot; classification of 6 is better than 5 which is better than 4, where 
&gt;does a GL-4 synthetic (ie Redline's MTL GL-4) fit in?
&gt;
&gt;

Again, this has to do with the friction characteristics being ideal for the
VW synchros to work properly.  Kendall and some other manufacturers still
market the GL-4 oil for VWs.
