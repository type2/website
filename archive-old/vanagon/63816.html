Subject: arm rests etc.

Hi Vanapeople!

Is there some way I can get my pass. seat's arm rests back on!?!?  or 
should I take it to a pro? what dya think they cost?!

also...
 the fan dial for the air system (not a/c, the other one by the 
driver)  is jammed. how do i get to it to fix it? the thing's stuck 
on '3' but it's not running. I can't move it or anything! 

what the best way to get Raid out of your seats? I had attack of the 
ants in Bessie and hadto Raid them! My son dumped Sprite..and well....
..

does anyone have a curtain set that matches the grey interior of the 
late models they wanna get rid of?? 
Or a used Bently book?
Howabout a window crank?

oh, does someone make replacements for the cheap plastic steering 
column and the frames that hold the Speedo,etc????  
all that's cracked and it's just plain tacky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If anyone knows what they cost, please tell!
