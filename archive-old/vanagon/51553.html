Subject: '82 diesel, oil consumption



        Well, as everyone knows.  I replaced my head gasket about a month
ago, along with the timing belt, the water pump and the timing tensioner
pulley.  

        Sense doing that I have noticed a great incerase in my oil
consumption.  I was going about 400-600 miles per quart but now my oil
consumption is at about 250-300 miles per quart if I drive at and below
55mph.  If I dirve about 60mph-65mph a quart might last about 100 miles.

        When I had the head gasket off the cylinders looked OK (no
scratches), and according to the reciepts a short block was put in in '93 by
a mechanic(who did not know what he was doing, as a general rule he also
gouged the PO (the PO spent over $600 to fix the hot start proublem and it
never was fixed, I put the relay in myself), IMHO).

        I have had people follow me under heavy load and they report that
there is no smokeing, as would be expected if it were burning that much oil.
At an idle the exaust is the normal diesel smell.

        I have the engine lower tin off to see if it leaking and I see mo
drips both parked and at an idle.

        I am thinking valve seals?  Althow the air cleaner looks OK (no
oil).  I can't think of much else. Any other thoughts?
