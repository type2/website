&gt;I get the same thing as you. I think we need to download a newer version of
&gt;something (?).
&gt;I don't have a clue about what the heck an Avatar is but I think it's
&gt;something like an icon. I'll be interested in the answers.

It's one of those VW thingies that would be next to my nickname,
if I could get past the &quot;pick an Avatar&quot; point.  I have Win 3.1 and
MSIE 3.02 with Virtual Machine for Java.  That oughta crash real good.
