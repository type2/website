Subject: RE: Tire Recommendations Wanted

     To carry the Syncro Westie, you need to make sure
     the tires can carry the gross vehicle weight. Check the GVW marked
     on your vehicle, and make sure each of your tires can support
     one fourth of it. You need LT (light truck) or at least 6ply sidewalls.

     Besides the FAQ on tires in the archives, Derek Drew suggested I
     check out tires in the slightly oversize 27x8.5x14 size (if you have
     the alloy wheels). This size is a bit hard to find, but they open up
     a whole range of modern light truck tires designed to meet the
     Sport Utility market, from total highway use to mudder, and everywhere
     in between. I have Goodrich ATs, and love them.
