&gt; There's only one reason they replaced the air-cooled engines.  The stricter
&gt; emission requirements forced them to.
&gt;
If this were true then how is it possible for these engines to pass 
today's CA smog tests? Also, Europe (the bulk of the market)  never had 
any of these tough emission requirements until the late 80's?

an old engine (carry over from bus) in a new much heavier body and found 
that the hp was simply not up to snuff? -DC
