Check the fuses.  Each set of lights has separate fuses, Also, high and low
beams are separated. The ground connection is located on the ground blocks
near the fuse box also.  All lights are grounded at the same terminal.  It
does have a habit of burning up.  Add an additional ground connection right
near the lights.
