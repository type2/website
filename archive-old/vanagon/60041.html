Mountain drivers,

How well will an 87 Vanagon handle mountain driving?  I live in Minnesota
and am planning a dinosaur fossil hunting trip where the tricky part is
west on Interstate 70 through Colorado across the Great Divide, through
Grand Junction, CO, visiting Dinosaur National Monument in Utah/Colorado,
and returning east across the Great Divide via Interstate 80.  The trip
will be in June.  BTW, I'm not planning any off-road driving :^)

1. Any comments regarding the grade of I-70 through the Rockies?
2. Any comments regarding the grade of I-80 through the Rockies?
3. Any comments on other roads that aren't Interstate in that area?
4. Any suggestions on preparation of the vehicle for this trip?
5. What should I have checked prior to the trip?  the brakes?  the clutch?
6. Any suggestions about how the Vanagon will handle in the mountains?
Any cautions?
7. What are typical June weather conditions on the roads in the Rockies?


Any advice will be greatly appreciated.
