 It sounds to me like the gasket is the problem. The rubber can get
stiff in cold weather and cause the door to bounce back and/or not latch
fully. I find that the best way to make sure that it's fully closed it
to push on the left side near the hinge from the outside or pull the
right side when inside (my '81 has an extra handle there). You can
usually hear a solid click when you push there on a door that's not
closed fully. I'm not sure of any permanent way to make the door seat
better on the gasket other than to re-adjust it with the screws on the 3
hinges and 2 latches. It can either be a long involved process of trial
and error adjustments until it closes easily and is straight with the
chassis or it could be just a tiny hair off. Also make sure that the
gasket is tucked into it's channel all the way around. 

 Personally I'd like to replace my slider with a rear hatch type door
that swings upwards so I could have a super strong wind-proof awning
every time I opened the door! ;)
