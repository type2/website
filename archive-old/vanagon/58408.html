Chris,

Since you're already in the replace parts mode, go ahead and replace the
coolant temp sensor in the thermo housing.  It's only $12 and the round
gasket $1 to $1.50.  It may be the likely candidate since you noticed the
change with it disconnected.  There are numerous posts on this little item
in the archives on installing it.

Basically, disconnect electronic connector and the horseshoe shaped pin
that keeps the sensor in the housing, have new sensor with new gasket on
and lubed with a little coolant ready in your left hand, pull the old
sensor out with the right hand and quickly insert new sensor into hole that
will be spilling out coolant (have rags, newspaper, bucket, towel, etc.
ready below the area for catching any wayward coolant).  Be fast and only
do this when the engine is cold!  If you were fast you shouldn't have to
bleed the coolant system; the 2.1 seems to burp itself ok for small amounts
of air.  I did open the bleeder valve on top of the thermo housing for a
brief second  while it was running to see if there was any air.  None
found.

Good luck,
Karl
88 GL

Hello all,
I am stumped and I hope someone on this list can help me.  My problem is
with my 86 vanagon.  At start up the engine runs fine but deteriorates to a
rough idle after it is warmed up. I don't notice any problem while driving,
only at idle.  I found that if I disconnect the coolant temp sensor for the
fuel injection system (simulating a cold engine) it runs well.  So far, I
have replaced the spark plugs, wires, coil, cap, rotor,and oxygen sensor.
I have tested other components of the FI system, all check out fine. Have
any of you experienced this problem with your vanagons?  Any help,
comments, or advice on solving this annoying little problem would be geatly
appreciated.
