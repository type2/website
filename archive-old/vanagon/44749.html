I have to say that I've had nothing but good experiences with mechanics and 
'parts guys'.  OK so I've only owned 2 buses over 12 months but I thought I'd 
add my good experiences nonetheless.

The Bug Shop here in Vancouver has done very good, very polite, and very prompt 
work for me.  When I bought my second bus I needed quite a few things done in a 
hurry since I needed to drive it.  Since I was spending the insurance company's 
money I got The Bug Shop to do all of the work.  They did it for a very good 
price (I hung out at the shop for a lot of the time that it was being done so I 
know that it took them several more hours than they charged me) and finished at 
least 20 times faster than if I had tried to do it myself.

Also when buying a couple aprts at California Imports I was treated with a 
friendly smile, good advice, and walked away with the right part.
