Subject: workin' type IIs part II  (low VW content)

this is an update on the bus used for hauling herbs that broke down week
before last.

not much has happened to the actual van, but a lot has gone on on the farm.
  Chris came back from his road trip to his folks in the midwest last monday.
 I was out getting yams etc for dinner, and when i brought some over to eat
he was back.   Just after dinner Sarah started getting contractions, and the
midwife was called in.    She was only  8  months pregnant, and Chris had
come back just in time for his second daughter ,  River,  to be born.   it
only took 7 hours,   go Sarah!

so the bus got put on the back burner, as Chris has been helping Sarah out.
 He  decided  to pull the motor since he came back, but hadn't got around to
it till today, when he broke one of the bumper mounting bolts.  (arghh)

hopefully he'll get the motor out today,  and i can do a machine shop run for
him tomorrow as i'm going to Seattle.

from beautiful Oly, Wa,
