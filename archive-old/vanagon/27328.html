Subject: Re: Syncro on Dynamometer (for emissions)

     Mark,

     If they make you get onto a one axle dynamometer, make sure it
     is the drive through type, because you cannot disengage the
     all-wheel drive, and you will not be able to stay on the machine!

     We are not alone. There are all kinds of vehihcles out there with full
     time AWD that cannot be disengaged: Audis, Hondas, several of the
     upper range Sport Uts. Here in Maryland, they are switching over to
     dynamometer testing, and at each test unit, one of the stalls
     will be a two axle setup.

     If I were you, I'd call first, and expect to get sent to a
     special location.
