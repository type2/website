John,

You write:
&gt;I have a 91 VW vanagon and would like to know the difference when some
&gt;body (vw) says they are either going to replace the long Block or the short 
&gt;block....I was told a long block is just a complete engine with alternators...sheet metal and other parts strapped on, while the short block is 
&gt;the core, pistons, and heads and valves...thanks in advance

A long block is what you refer to above as a short block, that is, it is the
motor case, pistons and cyls, heads, valve covers, etc. and is somewhat
'long'er than just a case /w/ connecting rods hanging out, which is a short
block. If you get the alternator and all with it, carbs, muffler, etc, what you
have is a 'turn-key' engine. Ideally, you just install it and turn the key.

Peace,
