Subject: Re: Betty Defined (f)

rs_at_ham.island_dot_net was askin for a definition of a slacker &quot;Betty.&quot;

&gt;
&gt;A betty is a surfing term used to describe the non-surfing women 
&gt;who hung around the surfing crowd.  There was also the corresponding
&gt;&quot;barney,&quot; but nobody seems to use that...
&gt;
&gt;Ellis further clarifies:
&gt;&quot;Betty&quot; is an abreviation of a reference to a cult like following of Bettie
Page, the 1950's porno S&amp;M &quot;goddess.&quot; To anyone apparently born prior to
1965, the current piercing of everything imaginable (and beyond!) and
leather collars, leather Brando &quot;Wildone&quot; motorcycle hats, chaps, vests,
handcuffs etc. as rather typical of the Sado-Masochistic or kinky leather
crowd. Now-a-days it's &quot;just the style, Dude!&quot; The Betty Page reference has
all but been lost. 
&gt;
&gt;A &quot;Thrashing Betty&quot; is a chick (er ah, young lady) who
surfs/skates/snowboards and has moves/cuts with the best of them. A Thrasher
girl.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Thrashing Betty&quot; was what Mr. and Mrs. VanBondo called their Black '57
Oval prior to selling it. =((( It seemed appropriate if we didn't come to a
COMPLETE stop prior to shifting into first gear.
&gt;
&gt;As used in a &quot;proper&quot; sentence:
&gt;
&gt;Whoa Doot!, Scan the Betty! Like she's (a) totally &quot;blown&quot; thrasher, mon!
(i.e. fuel injected belt driven blower intake sys on a dragster).
&gt;
&gt;Proper response:
&gt;&quot;Yeah brah!&quot; or 
&gt;&quot;Whoa!&quot; or 
&gt;&quot;No Ha-Whey!&quot; or 
&gt;(insert glazed catatonic look with no verbal response).

skate boards were metal skates under 2x4's, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was new).
