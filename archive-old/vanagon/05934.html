&gt;sort of translucent hose.  Has anyone else ever had these installed?  Are
&gt;they better than the steel pipes?  If better why were they not OEM?

well ... don't know if they are 'better', but i'd bet that they are all you'll
get from the dealer. those big plastic white-green-translucent pipes were
standard fare, starting back about the 86 model (i think). i know my 88 has
them. in 76,000 miles, i've had no problems with them ... other than a dealer
forgetting to tighten a clamp sufficiently when changing the coolant. and
the little pieces of the cooling system seem to be made of that stuff as
well ... like the little T-pieces in the heating system. so i guess it's ok
for long life. i'll bet they are NOT cheap, though!
