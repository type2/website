Subject: Bike rack over rear window? Yakima Roof racks.

Howdy Fellow Vdub Listees:

I know the FAQ's have been over this, but I bought my Bus last month with
Yakima roof racks (for kayaks, windsurfer, etc). Whomever installed them
put them right over the sunroof (vent), so that with my board installed, I
can't open the vent. I would have to move the side mount brackets and
refill the holes and glass over. Any advice on this? Is it worth it?  ;-{

Also, it came with a Yakima bike rack that has the support braces resting
on the rear *window*. Don't know if I like that.... Has anyone had
experience with this type of rack? (It has straps that hang from the hatch,
and bottom braces that rest on the bottom of the hatch.) Mostly there will
just be my bike, but there may occasionally be two.

I have a really nifty rack (channel steel) on my other (ummmm non-...VW)
vehicle that slips right into the Class 3 receiver hitch. I was thinking of
taking the Class 3 hitch off the back of that van, and somehow retrofitting
onto the front of the 89 Westy simply to use the bike rack, since it was
such an investment to begin with. Only thing is, its pretty heavy all
combined. Whaddya think?

Thanks.

Louise
