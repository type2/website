     Oops,
     
     Sorry.  A &quot;jihaad&quot; is a holy war, not a pilgimnage.  
     
     Been working too much on the weekends.

     Jim,
     
     I don't know if you were serious about not knowing what &quot;mecca&quot; means, 
     but here's an explanation anyway.
     
     Mecca is a city in Saudi Arabia that has enormous religous importance 
     to Muslims.  It has roughly the religous equivalence of Jerusalem to 
     Christians, only it's a lot more hard core.  According to Muslim 
     faith, all that can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at 
     least once in their life to circle the holy Kaaba (big stone building) 
     7 times and pray and and a whole bunch of other stuff.  I don't know 
     if you heard but the &quot;Jihaad&quot;, or holy pilgrimmage was held just a 
     couple of weeks ago.  2 million people go to this place every year and 
     stay in this HUGE tent city.  This year a fire killed a bunch and was 
     all over the news.
     
     Three times a day, all Muslims, regardless of where they are in the 
     world, stop bow and pray towards Mecca.
     
     So if your customers were calling your facility Mecca, take that as a 
     big complement.  In our vernacular, mecca is loosely used to mean any 
     place that must be visited once in your life.
     
     If you already knew this, sorry for the intrusion.  Just thought you'd 
     like to know what they were talking about.
     
     Have a nice day.

(V_at_L's server bounced this reply back, saying the &quot;MAILBOX IS FULL&quot;) so let's 
try it again. (Chris got his copy tho):
     
Chris asks:
     
&lt;&lt; Jim, have you really seen a '85-'91 westy w/ this socket?
 just curious... &gt;&gt;
     
Just today (Friday), in a steady rain, three different previous mail-order 
customers
on vacations pulled into BBI to sample our wares and to view what they called 
&quot;mecca&quot;, whatever that means.  1 had a 87 Westy, 2 had 90 models.  All had 
the pretty little Silver Socket.  They even spent a little money too.
     
Shop behind me has an 85 Westy with one too and he has the Floor Mounted 
Cooler attached to another one as well. (This is the bare-bones Poptop, 
Weekender?)
