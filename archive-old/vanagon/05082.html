What changed after '63?  Is that when they went to the larger-diameter
stub-axle sticking out of the xfer case?  As I see it, the rest didn't
change that much. (When did the big door go on the back?).

I'm considering new tires for the Bozobus, and would like to find something
with multiple-plies in the sidewalls this time around, as I overload him a
lot and frequently.  Not that I could tell how &quot;squirrelly&quot; he is,
considering the condition of my steering gearbox.  He just feels &quot;squishy&quot;.

The problem here: he came with 15&quot; rims, but I later switched to 14&quot; from a
later bus.  Then, I put the 15inchers back on the front because the inside
sidewall of a not-particularly-wide tire was rubbing on one of the ball
joints or the top zirk fitting or something (read: &quot;too wide&quot;). hmmm... now
that I think about it, I've been running the spare (a 14&quot;) on the left
front for quite some time (the 15 had steel belts showing through), and it
hasn't been rubbing...

Any recommendations for reinforced tires for a '61 Panel with 14&quot; and/or
15&quot; rims?
