&gt;the safest (easiest?) thing would be to come up with the headlight
fixtures &gt;from Canada for the same year ... they have the Daytime Running
Lights bulb fixtures already made into the headlight reflectors.

Wendy &amp; John have an '85 Westy.  Daytime running lights have only been
mandatory since '91 although many car models sold in Canada had them before
that year.  The '85 with it's round headlights would not be able to
accomodate headlights from a newer Vanagon with daytime lights.  However,
the wiring from the Bentley that others have mentioned should still work.
