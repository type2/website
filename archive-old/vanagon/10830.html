Subject: Coolant draining

The manual shows a socket-on-extension easily reaching between the push-rod
tubes to drain the fluid from the heads.  I found only sheet-metal covers
preventing any access to this region.  They were bolted to the bottom of
the case (much like on an air-cooled engine) and also had tabs that were
under the bottom exhaust port stud nut (and I sure didn't want to open
another can of worms by altering the exhaust system's integrity).  Are
these not-indicated-in-Bentley dirt shields common or weird?
