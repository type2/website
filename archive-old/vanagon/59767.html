&gt; the Vanagon, as finding a wrecked Porsche Boxter in the local junkyard ain't
&gt; gonna happen any time soon.. It seems as if a Subaru waterboxer 6 engine
&gt; would fit with the least amount of modification to the engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone done this??

Chris,
The XT6 engine is not considered to be a prime candidate for a Vanagon
swap. It only makes about 145 horses and does not have a counterbalanced
crank. The Legacy 4/2.2L puts out 130HP or 160HP in turbo form. Kennedy
now has a full kit for this conversion. If your heart is set on a six,
hunt around for the 3.3L out of the SVX, hard to find, but puts out
230HP and 229Ft/Lbs.
