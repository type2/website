Subject: RE: Cruise control for '80-82 Vanagon


&gt;Your post about vacuum came in just after I sent my Zemco post.  My two bus 

&gt;installations were on a '72 and a '84 (current).  Both had sufficient
&gt;vacuum for the Zemco units.  In other words, the cruise would hold full
&gt;throttle whenever necessary.  Perhaps the Zemco design requires very little 

&gt;vacuum.

Could well be-- I bow to the voice of experience.
I wonder if it might have had a built-in vacuum reservoir, as I had
discussed before?

&gt;I agree about the sensitivity adjustment.  Yes, the Zemco has one.

Good to hear. I'd like to put one on a bus... and another on my '66 Mustang,
which is quite zippy. Be nice if I could install two identical units, and
adjust to fit.


&gt;I disagree about the vacuum canister.  I think that the vacuum motor always 

&gt;leaks so as to make it fail-safe.

(!!) Uh... wouldn't this tend you make your exhaust valves &quot;fail-certain&quot;???


&gt;Thus, while the canister may help at
&gt;first, it probably wouldn't last on a long hill.  Besides, on neither of my 

&gt;bus installations did I see any sign of running out of vacuum.

That's the best news of all-- I was mostly worried about lack of vacuum.
Sounds like it's a non-problem on Type-4 engined VWs.

Mike, do you happen to know the model number of the unit you used? Or,
maybe have a phone number or location for Zemco?

Thanks,
