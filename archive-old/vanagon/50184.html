Subject: re: 82 diesel head gasket


&gt;I am working on it now, I am takeing the head off and I have notoiced that
&gt;there two holes in the head (near the hole off to the side, next to where
&gt;the notches are)that are not in the head gasket (the bently book does not
&gt;show holes there ether).
&gt;Should I punch holes in the gasket to match the holes in the head?



        Well, I got it together and it ran.  I didn't punch the holes out
because I wasn't sure at the time that I was putting it together.  If I ever
have to replace the head gasket again I will punch the holes out.  Leaving
them pluged looks like it makes a hot spot between #2&amp;3.

        One interesting thing is that after replaceing the head gasket and
timing belt is that it now seems to be a lot quieter (it's still a diesel,
but a quieter one).

        Of tools that I didn't plan on and had to go and get, I had to get a
6mm alen on a 3/8 socket in order to remove the V pulley on the crankshaft.

        I also found that the easest way to get to the V pulley was to
remove the muffler so now I need to get a muffler gasket.  Yes, even with a
torn muffler gasket it is still quieter than it was.

        Also, I am now able to add water the way the book says to, it
dosen't splash (read, geyser) back at me out of the pressure tank.
