Hi volksfolks.  

I have compiled a list of sites which may be helpful to those
of you looking to buy or sell a VW or parts.  Some are VW-specific, some
are links to newspaper online classifieds.  I'm sure there are
more so if I've missed anything let me know.

Now you can buy a VW and check out its option codes on the
same page!!!
