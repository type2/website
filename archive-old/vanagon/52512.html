Subject: Need interior fabric

This is my first post. I hope it works! 
I bought a 1990 VW Vanagon for a very good price but unknown to me it
was the very base model.  It did not have arm rests for the front seats 
(that the po had burned with cigarettes) and the fabric for the rear
cushion for the folding bed is destroyed. 

I am pleased with the Bus Though, I have owned many buses before, all
air cooled. 		

My question is, is there a source for fabric for the interior for
Vanagons?  
I bought front seats, with arm rests, for my bus thinking that I could
&quot;just have them re-upholstered&quot; 	
 Then I checked with the VW dealer and was shocked with what they called
seat covers, each seat bottom $167.00; each seat back $186.90, Arm rests
$137.00 each (there would be four)
Is there any way to find the fabric only from Germany?

According to the sticker under the fuse pannel the interior code color
is AB (light grey &amp; black)
thanks for any help      Jay L Delozier
