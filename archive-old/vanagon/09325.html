Subject: Hey London dudes

     Hi London (or thereabouts) people,
     
     I got this message from a VW friend in the States whos VW friend is 
     coming to London in two weeks read on...
     
     
     &gt;He plays in a band, and they will be in London (proper) for 3 months. 
     &gt;He leaves in 2 weeks. He's looking, not necessarily for parts or 
     &gt;service (he's leaving his bus here in the states), but for some VW 
     &gt;people in London to shoot the breeze with.
     &gt;I remember there were several U.K. people on vintagvw, but don't 
     &gt;remember if any were from London. If you could find one or more 
     &gt;people from London, with their phone numbers, this guy would love it, 
     &gt;and I sure would appreciate it! By the way, this guy has no access to 
     &gt;e-mail, so he needs just phone numbers. Thanks in advance, Lee!
     
     I there's anyone interesting in &quot;shooting some breeze&quot; with this dude 
     email me (Lee) and I'll pass it on.
     
     Cheeoors,
     
     Lee.
