So Marlin Bates, IV says:
&gt; I am in need of an engine as faithful readers are already aware.  I would
&gt; like to get one that matches the year of my bus (1969).  Does anyone have
&gt; any suggestions?  For junkyard/dismantler suggestions I am in Northern
&gt; California in Stockton which is 1 hour south of Sacramento.
&gt; 

That's pretty easy as your engine is pretty common.  If you want to come
to Sacto. to get an engine, the best place is Rancho Cordova Auto Supply.
They do a great job of putting engines together.

Let me know if you want more info.
