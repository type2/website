&gt;I would not jump to the conclusion that you need to remove the fridge in
&gt;order to get a flame. As most will testify on the list, getting a blue
&gt;flame requires technique and will involve a great deal of initial
&gt;frustration. Here is what some have suggested:
&gt;
&gt;Get the propane flowing by lighting both burners...
&gt;
&gt;Pump at least 20 -25 times AND hold the pump in while turning the piezo...
&gt;
&gt;You need to repeat the procedure at least 3-6 times if the system has not
&gt;started up in awhile....
&gt;
&gt; You will hear a definite whuuump when the flame lights...
&gt;
&gt;You will know it is lit if a) there is a blue flame in the sight glass;
&gt;and b) the red LED glows for longer than 30 seconds....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The propane dial must be fully open below and on the cabinet...
&gt;
&gt;Cold temps may make it more difficult ot start...
&gt;
&gt;We were about to give up and remove the fridge, but persevered with  the
&gt;above..
&gt;
&gt;Others will also have helpful hints....

Thanks...

I definetly did not give it 25-30 pumps.  I will give a try again with your 
suggestions.
