&lt;&lt; when my parents got what is now my 1984 vanagon, they remember looking at
 a vanagon GL with power steering.  they said that it was an option on the
 GL at the time.

the only '84 vanagons that had power steering were the wolfsburg editions...
the one they must have been looking at but didn't get probably was a WLE...
