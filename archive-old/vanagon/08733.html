Subject: winners receive..

You know, not to whine or anything, but winning by default
somehow cheapens the Thrill of Victory.  Anyway, I want to 
thank all the little people who made this possible, and...

What?  Oh.  Yeah.  The Prize.  Uhh, Martha, seein' as you
didn't sound exactly enthused, how 'bout a rain-check?  I'm
afraid I'd manage to screw up a condition or 2 and end up maybe
testosterone-deprived as well ;)

Mike &quot;I won. &lt;yawn&gt;&quot; Wright
