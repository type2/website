&gt; slacken the e-brake cables.  I was under the impression that I could 
&gt; remove the drums without removing the 46mm nut.  Is this true?  

NO! You have to remove the nut. Get the right tool and use a hammer
on the tool as well as a long breaker bar. I usually put one foot on
the breaker bar while banging with the hammer. Even with a 5 foot
breaker bar, you still need to use a hammer. The 46 mm nuts on both
sides of the car remove counter clockwise. Don't forget to remove the
cotter pin first.

When you put the drums back on, torque the 46 mm nuts down as tight
as you can (250 ft. lbs. at least), otherwise the bearing will die.

After you get the drums off, soak the adjusting stars in oil for a
while.  It will make them easier to adjust for the next couple of
years.

Read the part in the manual about bearing replacement.
