Subject: unsubscribing for a while

Gang:

It is with some regret that I sign off for the duration.  I've gotten 
to deleting the digests without reading them, and that seems wasteful 
considering all the great things I've experienced on this list.  I'll 
still lurk on the type2 and aircooled lists, but in deep background 
for a while.  Too danged busy!

Thanks for ALL the great advice, comradeship, &amp; silliness, folks.  
I'll miss ye!

Old Joe Clark

VW content: saw a great early 50's Beetle with heart taillights &amp; 
semaphores at &quot;Furrin Auto Repair&quot; this morning.  Pretty rare for 
these parts.

Seizure later.
