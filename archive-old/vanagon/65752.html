&gt;The garage I worked at (Penske Auto Center) had a Hunter alignment

&gt;This particular machine has a computer that runs an alignment program in
&gt;Windows and has four sensors that are mounted on the wheels and tell the
&gt;computer the relevant angles.  Then you look up the specs on the vehicle
&gt;and the computer gives you a nice display of all the alignment angles,
&gt;and the ones that are in spec show up as green and the ones that are out
&gt;of spec show up as red.  They change in real time as the tech adjusts
&gt;them and turn green when they are in spec.

I had a very similiar experience at a local NTB outlet.  Key to success was
staying with the van, watching and asking questions.  I also had my Bentley
with me.  The mechanic needed it to refer to rear adjustment procedures.
Without the Bentley present, I do not think he would have figured it out.

So far no problems, but then again it's only been 3K miles on new BFG
Radial All Terrains.  But it rides smooth and straight.
