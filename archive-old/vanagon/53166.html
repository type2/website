&gt;     My winter project is to rebuild a 1984 Vanagon engine to 2.1L specs and
&gt;put it into a 1985 Vanagon.  I have rebuilt air colled VWs but not
&gt;wasserboxers.  
&gt;
&gt;     Where do I get a copy of the Bentley Manual everyone is talking about?

     I found mine at a local (Portland, OR), German auto parts store for $64.

&gt;     Does anyone know anything about sandblasting the heads using plastic
&gt;pellets instead of sand, and then coating the heads with enamel top keep down
&gt;the electrolysis corrosion that occurs between the block and the heads?

     After a final cleaning with 99% Isopropyl alcohol (I used this because
it is relatively residue free) I applied J.B. Weld to any pitting as
described in the archives.
 
&gt;     Do I need any special tools to take the engine apart and put it back
&gt;together?  I heard someone say that a special tool is needed to get the
&gt;pistons out but I don't see how that would be necessary if you are going to
&gt;split the block.  Am I right?

     I removed the rods from the crankshaft with pistons attached and
pounded out the piston pins with a &quot;wood dowel rod.&quot;
     I do recommend having the cam gear removed from the crankshaft by
someone with a press.  I rebuilt from 2 damaged 1.9L engines and tried 1 cam
gear with a Sears gear puller and after hours of effort, damaged the cam
gear teeth getting it off.  I took the other crankshaft assembly to an
independent VW shop that charged $5 to remove it.
     This was my first rebuild.  So far, I have 800 miles on my results.

    I will have other questions later, but these are my initial ones.  Thanks
&gt;for any help.
