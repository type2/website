Subject: Re:  Seat Belts


&gt; Any advice on how to install seatbelts in a '65?
&gt;There are none now, nor any holes for mounting...


???... I thought seat belts were federally required by 1965? If
so, there should be mounting holes for lap belts, at least.

1.) On the engine-compartment wall behind the rear seat

2.) On the floor behind the seat-mounting brackets for the center
     seat,

3.)Just inside the rearmost lower corners of the drivers and
     passengers doors. Location of the other ends of these two belts,
     depends on whether it's a step-thru or not...


Hope this helps.
