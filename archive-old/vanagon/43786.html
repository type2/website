  Does any one have any secrets for removing these broken studs? One of 
the studs is flush with the case, the other two are almost all there.

  You bet.  I've a friend  who's used this one several times over the 
years, and amazingly, it's always worked.  He takes a short length of 
LARGE welding rod, in inserts it into the hole, and with a short zap of 
current, joins the rod to the broken stud.  Then, he just turns the rod 
to unscrew the remaining stud.  Now I thought thermo growth would further 
lock the threads to the block, but I've heard about him saving these 
situations for others for years, and it works.  If you want, I'll contact 
him and get specifics about rod size and type, amps, duration, control 
technique, etc.
  This one is almost as good as his trick I've seen to seat the big truck 
tires on rims.  He sprays a little starting fluid inside and leaves a 
trail out, then lights it.  In a loud pop, it's on.  These tires carry 
100 psi normally, so the pressure peak is safely within limits.
  Enjoy.
