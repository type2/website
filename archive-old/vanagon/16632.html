Subject: Non pop top bay Westy questions
Date: Sun, 30 Apr 95 20:34:39 EDT

Something I saw today has me wondering, now I know Westy
did fairly common non pop top versions of bay window Buses,
certainly till '70 or '71, all the interior pieces and often
a hammock in front, but when did they stop offering these.
I saw in a junkyard a genuine Type IV engined, large tailight,
large bumper, high front turn signaled, Westy.  This was origional
all ID plates etc and looked to probably be a dual carbed '74, and
no pop top.  I had never seen one this late before, did they do
some while they were switching from the front hinged to rear
hinged roof? are they uncommon or I am just ignorant to them?
Also did such conversions still receive the reinforcing belly
pans, etc. as there hardly seems any need for them without that
big hole in the roof, if they did it would be easy enough to add
a pop top if desired I guess.

Just wondering
