Subject: Advice on Power Mirror removal (again)

Let's try this again.... Has anybody out there removed Power mirrors off a
Vanagon?
I'll explain it better this time.
the wires that come out of the mirror go thru a hole in the door.
the hole in the door is not big enough to allow the plastic wire connectors to
pass thru. Is there any way I can remove the wires from the plastic wire
connectors (the're sort of in there permanently) or do I have to break the
plastic wire connector? Is the connector something that you can buy by itself,
or not?  Bentley is no help.

As I write this , I'm in the middle of trying to do this, that's why the
frustration and impatience....  :&lt;(

Any help would be appreciated..
Joel, didn't you install power mirrors on your van??

TIA, 
chris
