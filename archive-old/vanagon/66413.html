Subject:      Re: Windsheild Installation

I want to add a couple of tips to this message, to make the job easier
:-)

For removing the windshield, mine just pushed out from the inside.
Start in a corner and push out.  You will see the seal move and
eventually you can get the windshield out by pushing out all the way
around the windshield.  You will undoubtedly crack the windshield with
this method, but so what?  You're replacing it anyway.  Again, if you're
using a new seal, then by all means just run a knife under the rubber on
the outside of the windshield and go all the way around, then you can
just lift the windshield out.  You really should have a helper.

If your old seal is dry and brittle, you should get a new one before you
install the windshield or else you are likely to crack the new one
during installation.

For installation, I've found nylon string to work very well.  I got a
little roll they sell at Lowe's, it's kinda orange-colored.  The best
way to do this is to first lightly lubricate the channel that the string
goes into with dish soap or perhaps KY Jelly or your favorite non-paint
or rubber damaging lubricant of choice.  Then lay the string in the
channel, but double it, that is trial fit the string by unrolling it
around the whole seal twice, then remove it and double it over at the
mid-point.  If string could be folded in half, this is what you'd be
doing.  Then lay the doubled-up string in the channel all the way
around, and make sure the ends overlap.

Now you should have two string ends dangling and a loop dangling from
the channel in the windshield seal.  Lift the windshield into place with
your helper and make sure the strings are on the inside.  Then while
your helper holds the windshield from the outside, get in the driver's
seat and put a finger through the loop of string.  Then with your other
hand, pull on the dangling string ends while your helper gently pushes
at that spot.  Eventually you will pull the lip of the seal over the
ridge in the window frame and once you've got that done, the thing just
zips right in all the way around.

The reason you stuck your finger through the loop was to keep the string
from simply pulling out of the channel when you pulled on it.

After you've got it in, go outside and give it a good shove in a few
places to get it seated.

&gt; Warren,
&gt;
&gt; I just replaced my windshield in my 81.  Twas pretty easy, except
&gt; getting the old one out.  I found a windshield at a junkyard and wanted
&gt; to use my existing seal.  I had to beat out the existing glass with a
&gt; hammer, which was and still is quite a mess.  I recommend taping the
&gt; windshield all over if you're going to use that method.  If you buy a
&gt; new seal, the job is at least a whole lot less messy, because you can
&gt; just cut the old seal out and lift out the old windshield, as I did at
&gt; the junkyard.
&gt; Once you get the old windshield and seal out, wrap the seal around the
&gt; new windshield and then take string and run it around the outside groove
&gt; of the seal, so it goes all the way around and overlaps itself.  Then
&gt; fit the bottom part of the windshield into the VW frame, and with a
&gt; screwdriver or something begin to slip the lip of the seal over the
&gt; frame.  Make sure the ends of the string that is strung around the seal
&gt; are inside the van.  When you get it spaced correctly and begin to get
&gt; it in, you can then pull the string around the seal from the inside of
&gt; the van in a manner with pulls the lip of the seal over and into the
&gt; inside edge of the VW frame.  Just pull all the way around until the
&gt; inside lip is all the way in.
&gt; This job takes a little patience and pushing, but it will go in.  It
&gt; took me about an hour and a half one a.m. before work.  I don't
&gt; recommend the hammer removal, as I spend the rest of the a.m. in the
&gt; hospital getting a sliver of glass removed from my eye.  ;)  Ouch.
&gt; Having a couple doctors hanging over your stretched open eye with black
&gt; lights and dye isn't that much fun.  And they had nice breath...I'm glad
&gt; they weren't coffee drinkers.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck!
