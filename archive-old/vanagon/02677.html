&gt;Dereks Drews message about VW deciding what models to redo the new
&gt; AC systems in deleted.  Whew! &gt;

I just called the number and was told by recording to call back later.

I STRONGLY suggest that we all follow through with the letter.  I think
a letter has more sway than just a phone call.  Don't let this one go
folks.
