&gt; &gt; Simple question: How many amps is a white fuse rated for?  I'm talking
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that would be 8 amps. The red ones are 16 amps and the blue
&gt; ones are 24 amps.

Interstingly enuf, my 911 (gray market) had a couple _green_ ones...

Never figured out what the rating was on those...
