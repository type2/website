Subject: List Sticker Update

Howdy all,
Just so no one starts worrying about those stickers, apparently old man winter
has been holding up production at the printer's. The stickers were due to me
about 2 weeks ago, but thanks to the South's wonderful inability to deal with
even a light sprinkling of snow, I have been told that they will be delivered
on Valentine's Day. They are well aware of how displeased I am, but that won't
really get me anywhere. So, if you ordered stickers, never fear, they aren't
lost in the mail, just snowbound at the printer's.
  Also, for those of you who haven't ordered, there are PLENTY left. Only about
50 people have ordered, which is less than 10% of the list membership. So, if
you haven't ordered yours yet, PLEASE do. I really don't need 300+ stickers for
myself. (For more info, see my next post.)
Anyway, thanks for your patience.
