Subject: Re: '79 Water-cooled Bus? Yessirree!

Haven't seen the catalog, but know exactly the type you mean, and I had the
same reaction the first time I saw one.

No, it is not a cosmetic alteration it is a Mexican (or possibly Brasilian?)
bus. If you go south of the border you will see a TON of these. Up 'till a
couple of years ago, (and possibly still today?) the VW dealers in Mexicali
and Tiajuana were selling these Type II bodies with H20 motors. From what I
gather, there was (is?) an assembly line in Mex or Brasil that never
re-tooled to build the third generation of Transporter/Bulli. They coninued
building these through the '80's, selling them with motors built for the
Vanagon, and the weird looking radiator up front. I guess no one has seen a
real need to &quot;Grey Market&quot; these into the U.S. 

If anyone knows whether these are still available, I'd be interested in
knowing about it.
