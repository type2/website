&gt; &lt;snip the source of odors&gt;

&gt; How do you get the ALL the bad smells out, how do you clean the
&gt; headliner, how do I get rid of the carpet cleaner smell?

Dear Smelly in Seattle,

The answer is not baking soda or more shampoo...it's ZEOLITE.
Griot's Garage catalog lists it at $10.95, but you can buy it at
Ace Hardware for $9.95.  Whatever Zeolite is, it absorbs odors
and is reusable.  Stick it in the van and let it absorb the
odors.  Take it out, leave in the sunshine/fresh air for a while
and it's ready to absorb odors again.  It doesn't clean carpets
or seats or headliners...it just absorbs odors.
