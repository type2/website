Subject: 81 Westy For Sale in NC

I have a 1981 Westy for sale with full camper setup, less stove.  I just
had a VW factory rebuilt engine and new axles put in 8K miles ago, and
new 65k tires put on a couple weeks ago.  I'm asking $3950 and it yours.
I'm in Winston-Salem, NC.  If you can give it a good home, call me at
(910)759-4638.
