Well, Unka Joel finally hit on the right combination of guilt and shame to
force me into coming out. Please remove me forever from the ranks of
&quot;sniveling unknown lurker&quot; and pigeon-hole me as an owner of a '78
Westfalia. 156k miles, sage (frog armpit) green. His name is &quot;Wally&quot;. Did I
see another bus named Wally on the list? Maybe they're related?! :-)

I live in Cheyenne, WY which is at the intersection of Interstates 25 and
80. So, if any of your travels lead you through here and you need roadside
assistance, advice on where to get a good meal and a beer, doughnuts :-),
etc., look me up.

I have greatly enjoyed the travel reports from Jack Stafford,
Bob-(veedubber_at_aol_dot_com), Unka Joel, David Schwarze (sp?) and many others
who's names elude me currently. And have benefitted from all the tech
advice and the BTDTs. (Fuel and vent lines replaced recently, thank you.)
