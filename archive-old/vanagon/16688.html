 I posted an article about my '77 fuel injected 2.0 liter, and how it misses
 sometimes.  It will drive fine and then, at some rpm and load it will miss
 severely and the car jerks around.  Could this be a problem with my EGR
 valve.  As far as I know the valve works fine, but I do not have the filter
 hooked up to the exhaust pipe.  The filter was so rusted that I just took it
 off when I put this engine in the car.


 If your EGR valve is not connected to the exhaust, I would suggest that you
 disable the valve &lt;disconnect the little actuating rod&gt;. If the EGR valve is
 admitting air rather than exhaust it will cause the mixture to be too lean
 and could explain the poor running you experience. 

 Another possibility is that the wiper in the airflow meter has worn through in
 a spot and is sending erroneous data to the control unit which subsequently
 causes the wrong amount of fuel to be injected. My understanding is that this
 is most likely to occur at a flow setting that is used frequently, like 
 cruising down the freeway. If the poor running occurs, but can be cured by
 opening or closing the throttle slightly, this may be your problem.

 Good Luck,

 Dave
