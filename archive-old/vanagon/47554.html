I  have the Thule attachable rain gutters mounted to the side of the pop top.
 Mounted them on the front section of the pop top so that the bars are on
either side of the roof vent.  Gutters are a couple of inches below the top
of the roof, about 40&quot; apart.  Mounting the gutters was not that difficult,
make sure your measurements are correct (triple check) and mark your hole
locations.  I drilled with the top up, you can move the canvas outa the way
to see what your doing.  I used silicone to seal the holes from water leaks.
 I also mounted a Yakima &quot;Gorge Rack&quot; to the standard Thule rack.  This was
accomplished by fabricating &quot;L&quot; shaped brackets to bolt the Gorge rack to the
Thule rack. The Gorge rack is a vertical rack that is approx. 30&quot; high with 4
or 5 horizontal bars attached to the vertical bars.     I carried up to 4
windsurfing boards on the gorge rack plus a bike in a thule bike holder plus
two masts.  

Total weight = appox. 100 - 120 lbs.  

Problems: 

the only problem(s) encountered in using this set up for several years were
driving in strong cross winds (usually found at windsurfing sites) was an
adventure.  

Loading the boards was also a bit of a chore, usually took two people one to
hold and one to strap them down.  BTW, be careful when climbing/walking on
poptop, I stepped on the skylight, cracking the clear panels which started to
leak.

Raising the roof with equipment on the rack can be a problem.  If your strong
enough to get it raised, lowering can be an adventure with all of the weight
coming down on your head after you release the locking hinge(speaking from
experience).  Raising with weight might also put stress on the locking hinge.

After using this set up for several years the rack and roof show no signs of
damage.

I now pull a 5' x 10' utility trailer with racks inside to carry all of my
stuff.  I needed more room inside for my daughter and sheepdog. Much easier.
 Decide to sailing, back up to trailer, hook up and your gone in 5 mins.
 Beats loading and unloading all of your stuff every time.

Hope this helps, if you need any other info let me know.  By the way Bill,
where is your local spot ?
