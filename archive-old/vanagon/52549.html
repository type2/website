Subject: How to ship a van across the US?

Hello all,

I need to get my van from Raleigh, NC to Portland, OR and I don't want to drive
it (for reasons, see below).  I also have a paultry amount of personal
belongings, all of which will fit into the van. I have to be in Portland by
January 6, and I cannot leave NC until after Christmas day.

If any of you have experience that may help me make a decision as to how to do
this, I would greatly appreciate some input.  Here are some of the options that
I want to investigate:
	-) renting space on a Car Carrier and shipping it there
	-) having a moving company ship it along with my furniture
	-) renting a truck and towing it there myself

The question I am most interested in from this list is the feasability of
having the van towed/car-carried/shipped across the US.
Are there transport companies that can do something like this?
Has anyone shipped a vehicle across the US in a car carrier or by some other
	form?
How much money might I be looking at?
Who might I contact for more information?
Are there any options that I do not know about?

You might ask why I do not want to drive it there, so here are the answers to
that question:
1) This would be my fifth trip across the US in the past year and a half, and
I've kind of seen enough of Kansas and the world's largest groundhog.
2) The van isn't running well, and I don't have any money to get it fixed.
3) I have furniture to ship, as well.
4) I want to spend my small break between grad school and the real world (HA!)
climbing in central Oregon and not driving a rented Uhaul towing a van across
the US alone.
5) My company will reimburse me for the expenses, but only AFTER I show up for
work (see money to fix van).  Plus, I don't need transportation or furniture
immediatley.  I can have it all arrive after I get the money to have it
shipped.
6) I don't have the mental capacity to want to deal with diagnosing my van
problems right now.
7) I'm tired.

Thanks in advance for any and all help you can give.
