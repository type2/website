&gt; 
&gt; I've seemed to of lost the ability to shift into 3rd. or 4th. gear. If I
&gt; force it I can get it, though I'd like to try and correct the problem. Any
&gt; suggestions.
&gt; 
My '87 syncro transporter crewcab is prone to serious (feels broken) shifter stiffness 

after being run in snow/salt or summertime calcium carbonate (dust sealer) road 

conditions.  Forcing it eventually works, but is scary.  

Pressure spray all joints (especially at front) and sliding areas on the shifter rods 

and get the heaviest oil or grease you can on them. If you're on a trip, 

spray WD-40 or other remote lubricant for a temporary fix.  In 9 years of running, I 

haven't found a permanent solution, but neither have I had to replace anything.

So tell me now - have you been in deep snow and/or salt lately?
