Subject: Re: Painting Pop-Top?

Our '80 Westy had had its pop top painted while it lived in Florida. The folks
had used &quot;marine paint&quot;. It was glossy and was a cream shade that went well
with the burnt orange body - but was a shade darker than the original color.

If it were me, I'd definitely sand the peeling areas. If it is peeling then it
must have been painted before? Most of the fiberglass tops are not painted -
or at least they do not look painted?

&gt; The white paint on my pop top is peeling, and I was thinking about 
&gt; painting it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know what would be the best paint to use?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK to just paint over the peeling paint?
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions would be great!
