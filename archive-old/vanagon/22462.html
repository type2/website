Subject: RE: WTB: 2/3 front bench seat for 71 Bus



&gt;Just wondering if anyone out there has a front bench seat for a 71 bus for
&gt;sale.  I'd need the seat, and mounting brackets (if you have them) to mount
&gt;them in a walkthrough Westy.


???... a 2/3 front seat in a walk-thru?

I have one of the only '71 buses in captivity that is NOT a
walk-thru. At first glance it appears to have a solid front bench
seat from the driver's door to the passenger door; and an OE
metal frame running from wall to wall and covering both front
wheel wells. The spare tire is under this front seat. But upon closer
examination, the driver's seat looks identical to the walk-thru's
driver (and passenger) seat; and the rest of it could accurately
be described as a 2/3 bench seat.

Is this 2/3 jobber, what you want for your walk-thru? I guess
you intend to bolt the left side of the cushions to something
solid, presumably the driver's seat mount? Otherwise the guy who
sits there (say, he gets in the passenger side, then scoots over
next to the driver to make room for a third front-seat passenger),
will find himself falling down between the front fenders of your
walk-thru, as the 2/3 cushion tips up and slaps him upside the head.

I might soon bolt the spare tire to the front of the bus, which
opens up some interesting uses for the (large) space under the
front seat where it used to be. Maybe a tools-and-spares space,
or stash storage, or maybe a hidey-hole for the Stereo From Hell?
Better replace the generator with an alternator first...

P.S. No, my front seats aren't for sale. I was just curious what
you meant.  :)
