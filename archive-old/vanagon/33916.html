Anyone out there having thoughts like this guy?

Be it resolved that Lawrence Mott, Internet publisher extraordinaire, is
staying ahead of the curve. No more dodging the inevitable, I'm going to
practice what I preach. I will help to lead the way in this electronic
revolution by example, rather than just as an observer. I will make ten
resolutions.

1. I will cut way back on using personal telephone communications. You will
still be able to reach an electronic recording of my voice, but I won't be
using the phone as much. Instead, I will be sending most of my messages by
Email, some by electronic talk, some by IRC, and the rest by fax (when I
have to communicate with dinosaurs who don't have Email yet). I will not
use snail mail anymore.

2. I will try to eliminate the use of all paper in my business, and
strictly adhere to this digital documentation. I will turn off my printer
and put away my paper and ink jet cartridges. For those who still must use
paper faxes to reach me, you will be faxing your material directly into my
computer through my fax/modem. I will never see your paper on my end.

3. I will cancel most of my magazine subscriptions. Most national
publications are now available in electronic form for free, and I'm going
to use them. You say one can't curl up on the couch with a computer (like
you can with a good book or magazine), but you can with a laptop computer.

4. I'm never again going to &quot;shop till I drop&quot;, because I'm going to be
already sitting down while making my purchases. I am going to shop at
electronic storefronts and buy through my computer screen. I'll allow them
use snail mail to get their product to me (some things just won't fit into
an Email envelope).

5. I am going to use a global perspective in all of my business dealings.
Rather than limit myself by trying to sell my services in the neighborhood,
I'm going to remember that my potential business clients are also on the
other side of the world. That's right, I'll be doing more telecommuting
with my computer, without actually going anywhere.

6. I am going to buy a new mouse. With all of this new electronic commerce,
I want pinpoint accuracy with my cursor. One slip of the mouse could cause
a &quot;Training Horse&quot; to show up on my doorstep instead of a &quot;Training
Course&quot;. I'll keep the old mouse as a back-up, kind of like a spare tire.

7. I will do all of my investing, book all of my flights, and reserve all
of my hotel space with my mighty computer (reducing middle-man commissions
in the process, I might add).

8. I'm going to strive to develop a new electronic personality, an avatar
(those little electronic bodies used to walk around in Web sites). And I'm
going to take care of my avatar to keep it healthy, fit and trim.

What's nice about making these pledges is, if I don't keep all of them, all
I have to do is FTP back to this page next year and edit them out. No one
will remember what I said. What the hell, I already deleted resolutions 9
and 10.

DELETE   9. I will stop picking on Janet Reno.
DELETE  10. I will stop complaining about government censorship.
