Subject: RE: fuel mileage (and Pfeiffer facilities)

&gt; 
&gt; About the location:  On the coast, it was sunny and warm and windy, and
&gt; very picturesque, with lots of waves crashing against empty beaches and
&gt; amazing rock formations.
&gt; 
Also, nude sunbathing for those so inclined....of course January may not
be the best time to run around nude...

&gt;
&gt; Pfeiffer is not on the beach, but is inland a few miles in a stand of
&gt; redwoods.  They smell very very very nice!  A great fresh pine scent!  The
&gt; temp in woods was quite cool, and since there's no sun to warm you, feels
&gt; even colder.  I didn't enter the park, so I can't comment on the facilities
&gt; within. 
&gt;
We stayed at Pfeiffer last spring - they have good facilities - store,
cafe, H2O, firewood, washer/dryers (!?), showers (bring your quarters),
fire pits, tables, etc. It is cool back there, though, and I'd
recommend the sites along the river - nothing better than sleeping to
the sound of a flowing river.  I believe the sites numbered 4-20 or so
are on the river.
