&gt; might have the last word about the lists name and he has a vanagon now. ;)

Don't ANYONE suggest we have a Vanagon list, a Combi list, a
21-window list, &amp;c &amp;c...I have a hard enough time handling the
x-posting from Air-Cooled!  If we were going to do an inclusive
name, we could do type2_at_etc.etc.etc, but then again, why bother?
