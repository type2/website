 Rebuilt by 68 bug motor and doublechecked timing marks when 
installing the camshaft.  Put the motor in and it wouldn't start.  
Drained the battery trying to start it and towed it around popping 
the clutch but to no avail.  After a week finally used a pencil 
thru the sparkplug hole and sure enough, timing was waaaaay off.  
Took the motor apart and found the marks, don't know how I missed 
em, realigned cam, reassembled motor and fired up first try.
