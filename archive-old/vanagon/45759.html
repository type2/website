 Does anyone out there have a 46mm axle nut for  a '67 kombi/westy?  I
 am beginning to think that I will have to cut this one off...
 
 Also, is there any chance that all this torking on the axle nut will
 damage the shaft/reduction box/ or trannie?

What you want to buy is a striking wrench.  This is a tool that allows you to
use a breaker bar and a hammer to loosen extremely tight nuts.  You can get
these from Proto or KD.  They are usually stacked at a local Graingers.  This
tool and a 5 lb lump hammer will get the nut off in no time.
