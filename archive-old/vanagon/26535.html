Howdy howdy i'm a cowboy.
not realy, but I did buy my '71 from one up in Idaho.
My name is Shaun Dustin.  I'm a student in Civil Engineering at BYU 
in Provo UT (no, the snow is better in California, Nevada, Colorado, 
etc.  You dont want to come here and ski.  All rocks, ice, and 
rude locals.  Really.  It's 
not that great;).  My wife is pretty cool about my VW habit; she let 
me rent a '93 beetle with our last pesos when we went to mexico last 
year.  Whadda ride!  I got my first beetle ('68) when I was 
fourteen (pawned off on my dad this summer for some old debts and a 
new 
alternator; we were both pretty satisfied), and the rest is what it 
is.  I had a '63 beetle as well, but he was old and tired my 
passengers got tired of the way the floorpan and heater channel flexed 
and showed asphalt as we whizzed down the road.  The engine lives on 
in the bus I graduated to last year.  My dream bus is a '56 with some 
early westfalia options that I've been trying to talk a guyb out of 
for years.  It's been parked at least since the late sixties (sigh).  
Someday.

Incidentaly, anybody got a 
spare brake booster they wanna sell/get rid of?  My diafram's got a 
pinhole leak in it that really bugs me.  

Anyhow, it's good to be here.  I'll be glad to help anyone wherever I 
can.

How many lawyers does it take to grease a combine?

Just one if you run him through slow enough.
(no offense)
