I agree.  I suspect that Mr. Knoll made a slight error with that 101dB
statistic, but even so, I think it would be too loud for me.  I
associate generators with the 50-foot-class-A-driving, plug-in-and-never-
come-outside type of camper.  Until they make one that is as quiet as my
refrigerator running (I can sleep next to it) count me out.
