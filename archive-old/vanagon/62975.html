&gt;This is in the welcome file, too:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Your  subscription  to the  VANAGON  list  (No  title defined)  has  been
&gt;&gt;accepted.
&gt;
&gt;I know how to fix it in the (mail) headers you asked about, and I know how
&gt;to kludge it here, but it's gonna pop up in a hundred other places--it
&gt;smells like something was left out when you ran the config program.
&gt;
&gt;Somewhere there's an .rc file or an .ini file or whatever NT uses, the
&gt;variable in there needs to be changed, I think. It's probably called TITLE=.

Yeah, as soon as I get the ability, I'll go through our configuration and
fix these problems.
