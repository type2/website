&gt; &gt;&gt;anybody ever do this?  i've always been somewhat curious about the airflow
&gt; &gt;&gt;around the buses (all years) and always wanted to attach those little tufts
&gt; &gt;&gt;of wool to the outside, like they do in the windtunnels, and go driving
&gt; &gt;&gt;down the highway ... and have someone with a camcorder film the bus. :)
&gt; 
&gt; #3 was a smoothed in 
&gt; nose fairing, full width,  from the windshield down. Major turbulence seen 
&gt; along the sides in #1 + 2, nice smooth flows along #3 sides.

&gt; The nose fairing in the pictures does the same thing, 
&gt; smooths out the streamlines around the front corners. 

I have been thinking about this already for a while.  Thanks for the 
reference.  Do you know if anyone has produced such a nose fairing?  In 
addition, I saw an ad from one of the big arms companies on their 
solution to a problem with extending the range of a sub launched missile. 
The design is strictly length- and diameter-limited (to get a bigger tube 
first you need a bigger sub).  To get a &quot;longer&quot; acting missile they put 
a small ogive nose piece on an extensible rod.  The rod put the cone 
about 2-3' in front of the nose and reduced drag by increasing effective 
length.  So if I put half a &quot;L'eggs&quot; package in an old retractible 
antenna would I get anything but funny looks?  I was actually thinking of 
a slightly bigger nose piece (1' diameter ogive) on a stiffer rod (1/2&quot; 
allthread).  Any aerodynamics experts out there?
