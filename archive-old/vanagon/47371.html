Subject: Re: Vanagon advice needed

Depending on where you are I have a '81 rustless, never been hit, complete,
7psgr, with A/C and xlnt tires/brakes in Phoenix that I can't even &quot;give
away.&quot; Started advertising _at_ $1981.00 obo I am willing to negotiate down to
about $1300.00 and blow it out. I have NO takers!!! The only thing it needs
to make it a bitchen runner is a $136 clutch (plus $200 labor). Almost think
its worth it to yank the eng and tranny and crush the mofo. ;-)
