&gt;Well, I went shopping all the local magazine emporia I could think of,
&gt;and all I could find was a Brit magazine.  I didn't think this would
&gt;be very interesting since all of the adverts would be for across
&gt;the pond.  Where or how does one get a single copy of one of the US
&gt;rags to see if it's worth the subscription?

I get 'em from whenever I'm in a larger city (like most of the folks on
this list seem to be) at any decent-sized grocery store.  Most of these
places have gearhead magazines like you wouldn't believe.  You might even
check with your public library.
