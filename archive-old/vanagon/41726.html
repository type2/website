Subject: Additives...

Hello again everybody...

In light of my recent discovery that there were loose metal fragments in my oil 
strainer, and that my tranny grinds/growls in reverse (but is fine otherwise), I 
am going to use anti-friction additives to prolong the life of engine/transaxle. 
What can you tell me about the value of the different brands/types?  I have had 
positive experiences with Slick 50, Engine Armor, Motor Honey, etc....any of 
your thoughts/experiences would be a boon....

Wow!  Y'all shoulda seen this beautiful 63-65 pristine splittie!  Was a treat to 
watch it mosey along...had to take a couple pictures.  Didn't get to talk to the 
guy, though, oh well...

Ta ta
