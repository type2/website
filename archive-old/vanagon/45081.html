Hody ho,

The weekend I'd been waiting a year for had arrived, the biggest VW show in
Connecticut.  This year I planned on going to the campout on saturday, but
cloudy, rain boding weather and friends who weinyed out dampened my spirits
and so I resolved to wake early on sunday and make a day of it.  We awoke at
the crack of 8 and packed up the white on red 71 Westy with sandwiches and
cokes and implements of destruction.  At the last moment I decided to make
up a little V_at_L sign for the back window.  I mentioned to my fiance that
there is an official list sticker, but I never did buy one so this will have
to do for a temporary job.  So she replies, &quot;You mean you didn't buy a
sticker for that list you spend all your time reading? What kind of el
cheapo are you?&quot;  Hmmm.  And I was thinking cutting back on VW purchases was
a good thing, but now I'm confused.  I vowed to myself to spend like a
sailor at the meet to renew her confidence in me ;-).  After a last minute
supply check we cruised out of West Hartford on 44 to the big show.  

As was the case in previous years, taking 44 west to 202 west we met very
few vw comrades en route.  But nearing Litchfield the good karma rainbow of
bug colors led the way and we all chugged uphill like salmon making our
return.  We didn't enter the bus in the show, just parked and headed off to
the parts area.  Most of last year's regulars were in their usual places.
My not so secret mission was to buy the correct vdo bus clock for my 71.
For those who don't know, part # 221 957 069 is a bear to find.  I passed
one up at last year's show (priced at $75!!) and haven't been able to find
one since.  This year would be different.  About the 6th vendor down there
it was, set in a bezel with a speedo and gas guage for $60--and it worked!
So I play mr. cool cucumber and innocently look it over as if it were junk
mail, deciding to look around first and see if I can catch an even better
deal (the &quot;el cheapo&quot; syndrome).  After walking 100 feet away I can't take
the suspense and I have to return to the clock.  I ask the vendor if he'll
take less if I just take the clock and leave the other guages.  He says that
it's the only part that's worth anything (true) and it all goes for $60. I
buy it and thank him--the search is over and I'm a happy man.  I later found
out after making two passes through all the vendors that the only other
68-75 bus clock at the show is a NOS specimen offered by VW Bus Heaven (a
great source for hard to find parts) for the princely sum of---$200 Yikes!!

I ended up scoring a NOS pair of 71-79 bus rims with just a coating of dust
on the original flawless grey paint for a mere $10/pair.  The seller was a
bug guy who just wanted to get rid of the few bus parts he had.  I also
bought a NOS front spindle and a used pair of ball joint assemblies for
another $10.  I kept my eyes out for an oil bath air cleaner for christian
k.'s 65, but my search revealed only 2 and neither had the rubber tube
attached.  I'll keep up the search locally christian, I was surprised this
would be so difficult to find--after the clock purchase I thought anything
was possible.  I saw my friend, Dave, a RMMW distributor, and he was busy as
always collecting wads of cash satisfying the teeming multitudes in their
lust for parts.  It looked like a dizzying pace.  I said my hellos and let
him suffer in his bitter-sweet vendor hell.

Among the people I met (many friendly people who, like me, can't resist the
urge to speak VW) was a guy who parted out a 73 bus and just wanted to sell
off the remaining carcass for cheap.  I ended up buying both CV shaft
assemblies, rear drums, backing plates, wheel bearings and trailing arms
(everything was still attached) for $25.  This necessitated bringing my bus
into the show area, which necessitated convincing the gate cop who didn't
want to let another car into the show that carrying those two rear axle
assemblies any distance was cruel and unusual punishment.  With the bus now
in the show area (and me feeling like Clarence Darrow) I had other 71 owners
coming over and chatting (next year I will enter in the show, I enjoyed
giving the tour of the bus and talking with other 71ers).   The SW radio
michael heron sold me (thanks again, michael!) was a big hit, as was the gas
heater I installed last year.

Finally I made it the the show area where I went straight for the buses,
keeping an eye out for signs of V&amp;L people.  I stopped by all the red/white
buses in an attempt to meet up with michael h's friends, craig and dean, but
I didn't find them though I must've seemed odd asking everyone if they had
seen any canadians around (why, whaddayou gonna do to them?).  In the
process I met up with a couple who restored a sealing was red split westy
(so THAT'S sealing wax red!).  They had an orange and blue side tent that
they bought used for---$850!!  I later met a 91 vanagon westy owner who was
GIVEN a tent a year ago when a stranger pulled up next to him in a parking
lot and said he used to have a camper and would give him his old tent if he
wanted.  Averaging that out, I guess $425 is the going rate for tents!  

Another highlight of the bus show area was a rainbow colored bay westy with
a children's toy train set running on the luggage rack and a huge wind up
key spinning on the rear engine lid.  It caught everyone's eye and brought a
lot of smiles.  I didn't see any barn door buses, but I did see a couple
nice bay crew cabs and some well restored split westies.  

We left the show at around 3:30 and made a run up route 8 into Mass. to a
poultry farm to pick up 100 pounds of composted chicken manure for the
garden--ahhh, nothing like chicken sheeeit in a bus on a hot summer day.
Actually we had quite a full day after the show, but this post is getting
long and the VW content has about expired.  We both had a great time and are
looking forward to next year already.  Next time we'll be parked in the show
area with a REAL list sticker!
