Subject: Stretched Busses, Mr. Kemperink.

All,

I looked up the address and phone# of Kemperink, although i knew they
existed i never thought of that before, but today called them.

A, what sounded to be, somewhat older lady picked up the phone, she
spoke in a Dutch dialect, &quot;Kemperink&quot;  I told her my name and said that i'm
into VW Busses. I asked if they, by any chance, had some documentation
left regarding VW Busses, and she said: &quot;We have to look at the future,
i'll give you my husband&quot;...&quot;Kemperink&quot;,  i told my name again and again
asked for possible doc, he answered negative, then i asked if he might have
some pictures of VWs, then he said: &quot;I don't know, we don't keep old stuff
we have to look at the future, the new Mercedes is coming, and we're doing
the new VW LTas well, we have to go on, we must not stop to think of the
past&quot; I got the feeling that he had gotten calls from Bus nuts before, it
sounded as if he was giving me his standard old car nut  treatment. I was
pretty enthusiastic about this when i found their phone#, so you can imagine
that i was a little disappointed, and i said:  &quot;Oh, that's a pitty, i am a long time
VW enthusiast and Kemperink made quite some rare pieces, i have owned a
Kemperink stretched '73 VW Bus and i would have greatly appreciated it if
you would have whatever documentation or pictures on VW Busses you have
modified&quot; Probably he sensed my dissappointment and said: &quot; Well, if you're
ever in the neighbourhood, drop by, then we can talk about it and i'll see if i
can find something&quot; So i said: &quot;I will certainly do so, i'm sure i will be in your
neighbourhood soon!&quot; ... Kemperink: &quot; Well, give us a call first&quot; Me: &quot;I will
do so. Thank you very much for your time! Goodbye.&quot;

So i'm planning on going there in the near future. I will report my findings to the
lists.

Brian
