Subject: Re: [Fwd: Electriclly FRIED WIRE HARNESS.]help....

Thanks for the data....We cut open the harness and replaced the wire..
We found it to be a power lead (red/whitestripe) that splices into 3
other power leads (way over on the driver side of the harness) that all
get their power from a relay in a box above the coil.  There is voltage
on that line still.
We got the car running...but it misses every now an then 1 or 2
cylinders...its pretty bad...

Well tonite it died totally....I was turning around and all of a sudden
the engine cut out....The starter wouldnot crank...maybe the battery is
to weak and I have a fried altenator.....its charging now and I will
see in the morning....I hope the engine is not seized.....
I mostlikely have other bad electric parts...Would this contribute to
misses on my newly re-gasketed heads....

Almost ready to trade-it in...

&gt; &gt;WHY does the ps unit have wires...is it a sensor?
&gt; &gt;where do these wires lead?
&gt; 
&gt; the wires should be going off to the right rear of the engine area, where
&gt; they go into the idle stabilizer box. when you turn the steering wheel, the
&gt; idle stabilizer speeds up the engine speed to compensate for the effort
&gt; that the engine has to make pumping the power steering fluid. yes, the
&gt; pump is turning all the time, but only when the front steering rack is
&gt; moved &quot;off-center&quot; does the pump cause the engine to slow down. this is
&gt; usually noticeable only when you are moving very slowly or standing still
&gt; (like in a parking lot). you probably noticed it when parallel parking or
&gt; when spinning the steering wheel with the car stationary (and your foot OFF
&gt; the gas pedal): move the wheel and the tachometer/engine speed goes up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Could this be why my engine is hard to stay running and start....The
&gt; &gt;heads were just put back on...it started to run fine...until the engine
&gt; &gt;became rough 50 yards down the road...I found the arcing plug
&gt; &gt;wire..replaced it...and still rough starting/running...now I found the
&gt; &gt;wire to the ps unit...close by to the bad plug wire. I hope I did not
&gt; &gt;fry my  computer chip?
&gt; 
&gt; it would definitely affect the idle stabilizer, i think. you probably have
&gt; not affected the main brain, but the idle stabilizer might be a bit worse
&gt; for the experience. see if the repaired wire fixes the problems. the idle
&gt; stabilizer definitely controls/affects the starting and running.
&gt; good luck.
