&gt;&gt;So I measure 1.64 feet on my breaker bar
&gt;&gt;and make a mark on the bar and stand with one foot on each side
&gt;&gt;of the bar, and equalize my wieght.
&gt;
&gt;Is this right? 

Not exactly.  He meant to say &quot;one foot on each side of the mark&quot;

&gt;I've wondered this before. Chiefly because the instructions
&gt;to my torque wrench are awfully ticky about having the handle swivel on
&gt;that little fulcrum in there while I'm sweating and grunting. No pulling on
&gt;the bottom of the handle for an extra two inches of leverage! It's hard
&gt;sometimes...

Follow the instructions and don't let the swivel handle tip to either side,
keep it so the force is only transfered through the &quot;axle&quot; that attaches the
handle to the wrench.

&gt;So we want to stand on it, okay. But whatever we put inboard of the
&gt;line--the foot-pound line above--is going to be &quot;lighter&quot; than what we put
&gt;outboard. Less leverage. How do we calculate how much of the mass to put
&gt;outboard? Probably at 390 feet it doesn't matter, but I bet at 4 feet it
&gt;does. Maybe Brother Maher knows, he can do math...

Just center the force at the mark.  1/2 of it 2&quot; left of the mark and 1/2 of
it 2&quot; to the right of the mark will be the same as all of the force at the
mark.
