Subject: Barndoor bitz wanted...

     Hi all,
     
     A friend asked me if I knew anyone who has the following Barndoor 
     parts:
     
     NOS Rear 'T' handle for barndoor
     NOS Side loading handle
     
     both items are for a '54 Kombi.
     
     anyone got a lead on any of these.
     
     email me direct.
     
     cheers,
     
     Lee.
