Subject: Sway Bar Clamps Body Panels

I need to replace the front sway bar clamps on my '74 Type II. What is a
good source for the clamps and are special tools required for installation?

Where are good replacement body panels (rocker panels, etc) available for
rebuilding my old van? I am putting 1/16&quot; metal in the rust holes now but I
think panels would make a nicer job.

Thanks,

Herb
