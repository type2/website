Subject: Vortices and the Trip



&gt; Umm, you could save yourself by claiming to infiltrate the crystal waving
&gt; crowd and exposing them as frauds!  Hey, it's all in fun!  For informational
&gt; purposes only, and all that!

All this talk of spiritualism got me thinking that perhaps we should
start the Transporter Trek in Sedona AZ instead of the Grand Canyon.
They've got *power vortices* in Sedona!  I've never seen one myself
but a FOAFOAFOAF saw one, really!

I figger if I can just trap a Vortex and slip in the back of my microbus
I won't have to worry about paying for gas the whole trip!  Might be good
for cooking food on camp-outs, and a whole slew of other *power* oriented
activities!

Waddayathink?  Perhaps I could slip a couple in the parcel shelf for
those who join up later...
