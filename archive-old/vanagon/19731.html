&gt; engine coolant .  You might look at the possiblity of adopting one of these to
&gt; wasserboxers.
&gt; 
Now I don't really remember but don't the 2.1's have the oil
to water heat exchanger?  I swear on our '86 it was the first
place I saw such a thing but I easily could be dreaming, was
probably on the '89 Jetta.
