A normal engine will always produce some water vapor.  It is a byproduct of 
the combustion process.  That is why it is important for engines to get hot 
enough to get the water out of the oil.  Sludge and all that gooey stuff.  In 
addition, all fuels contain some sulfur.  Add a little heat, some water, and 
now you have sulfuric acid in your crankcase and exhaust system.  Did you 
originally fail on Hydrocarbons or CO?  CO is mixture related,  HC is ignition 
or valve problem.  Lean Miss-fire will also cause excessive HC.  Also, over 
advanced timing at idle is a problem.

I recently &quot;just&quot; passed my emissions test with some tweaking from my
mechanic. He told me to get it tuned right away to remain in compliance. I
knew I was overdue for a new O2 sensor so I replaced it with the Ford
equivalent (13913), and noticed no improvement in the way the engine ran. 
In fact I observed white exhaust at low idle and water dripping out of the
tailpipe. On closer inspection I noticed a couple of wet places on the
pavement under the catylitic converter. It was clear that water had been
dripping from the CC for some time because there was rust in the spots
where the water was dripping.  Any idea where all this water is coming from
(please don't say head gaskets)?
