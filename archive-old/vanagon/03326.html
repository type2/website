&gt; &gt;The difference is that the others are not meant as passenger vans.  They are
&gt; &gt;(with possibly an exception here and there) sold as delivery vans.  At least
&gt; &gt;that's how it was the last time I was there (1990).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; The Eurovan is also primarily a delivery van. It's available in short and 
&gt; long wheelbase versions, as a pick-up, a box van, a chassis-cab, etc.... ITS 
&gt; A VAN. You can buy all the vans I mentioned as passenger versions. Renualt, 
&gt; Citroen, Fiat and Peugot (as well as all the Japenese manufacturers) also 
&gt; sell 'minivans' that are designed solely as passenger vehicles and are less 
&gt; truck-like. 

Hmmm... The whole 2 years I spent in Europe I don't ever remember seeing
a Renault, Citroen, Fiat, or Peugot van that was not a delivery van.  I also
remember that any non-VW van outfitted as a camper got stares like it was
from outer space!  I know this from experience, cause we had a little Opel
van that was made into a camper.  Actually, it was called a &quot;Bedford Blitz&quot;
and was, I think, from England, but had the 1.9 liter Opel engine in it.
Things may be changing over there, but I still think the Eurovan has very
little competition in Europe as a peoplemover.
