Merry Christmas to all from Almonte, Ontario.  Have't had much time to
write stuff in the past while but I've still got the Vanagon and it's beem
running fine (knock on wood).  I try to read the list each day but often
cannot even do that.  I've got some &quot;free&quot; days during the hoidays that I
will use to catch up on things.

Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year
