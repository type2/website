&gt;I think what is killing us, Phillippe, is that we desire the extra ground
&gt;clearance of the 16&quot; vans. Can you tell us how much more ground clearance
&gt;there is over the 14&quot; vans? 
&gt;
I got 28.5 cm on front under the skid plate and 26.5 cm under the engine
protection plate. I don't know about 14&quot;er. I remember you that 1 inch =
2.54 cm, get your computer!!
I should say my Caravelle,(Vanagon) is a lot lighter than a Westy and that I
use 205/16 Goodyear Wrangler tires.

&gt;Also, we are trying to figure out what the largest size tires that can fit,
&gt;and then to calculate what gear ratios to change to here in North America. 

I wouldn't mount larger tires than 225/16 otherwise I'd have to change the rims.
A friend of mine did that on a 16&quot;er TD without intercooler, and it's a real
pain!
But I think with a 2.1l like yours, it'd work pretty well.
We at the Syncro Club are around 70 members and I think there are about 20
or so 16&quot;er.
Some purists people want to stay as close as possible than the genuine 16&quot;,
that's why we usually don't change our rims. I have two sets of them.
&gt;
&gt;All North American Syncros come with a gear ratio of 4.86 but a check of a
&gt;microfiche I got from Germany shows that all these different ratios are
&gt;available: 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;37/6	6.17 
&gt;&gt;&gt;35/6	5.83 	
&gt;&gt;&gt;38/7	5.43 		
&gt;&gt;&gt;34/7	4.86 (DEFAULT USA) 
&gt;&gt;&gt;32/7	4.57 
&gt;
&gt;Our idea is to order 6.17s from Germany and then see if we can fit the tires
&gt;in that go with this size. If not, then modify the vans to be more like 16&quot;
&gt;models so that those tires will fit. If the tires still do not fit, then try
&gt;5.83 or 5.43.
&gt;
Why do you want to get 6.17s from Germany? Aren't they available in the US?
You should contact a Mercedes tuner, stock 300 series steel 6.15s fit on the
Syncros, I believe you could get compatibles 6.17s rims. 

&gt;I believe there are a couple of 5.43 transmissions in storage in California
&gt;but none are yet in use in any Syncros in North America, so far as we can tell.
&gt;
&gt;====================================
&gt;
&gt;I agree that custom skid plates are not too hard to manufacture. I added a
&gt;lot of T-6 6061 aluminum alloy plates to the bottom of my van so I can smash
&gt;it down on rocks and not hurt it.
&gt;======================================
&gt;
&gt;You must travel to 
&gt;
&gt;http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html
&gt;
&gt;and search on the &quot;archives&quot; of the mail messages and search on the text
&gt;string: 
&gt;
&gt;syncro

I've also been there, could you tell me if they are others Syncros related
sites?

Many thanks,
