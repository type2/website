&gt; &gt;My '69 also has an oil filter and uses spin on fram cartridges.  Make it
&gt; &gt;kinda nice at oil change time.  This appears to be some after market type
&gt; &gt;adapter that goes on the oil pump.

&gt; 
&gt; Scott, how does that fit over/under/around/through the rear engine mount 
&gt; bar?
&gt; Something you copied from ol' Ben's bus?  :)
&gt; 
It is located at the rear of the engine and hangs below the mount.  
Beyond that I cannot say as I have never seen it out of the van.  I have 
to pull the engine to replace the front seal and check out the clutch so 
I'll take a good look then.
