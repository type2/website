&gt;I'll second this.  Anybody else find this true, too?  My singlecab was so
&gt;stiff in the suspension that it would only really handle well with about
&gt;a thousand pounds in it.  Acceleration and braking we're too good, but the
&gt;ride sure improved.
&gt;

I had a '59 bus, put a 1000# of fertilizer in it. Once I got it rolling it
was a nice ride. As I recall a little slow to stop...
