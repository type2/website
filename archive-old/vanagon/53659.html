Subject: Re: Out of the snow at last!

Shawn:

&gt; The van did fairly well in the snow, although we did
&gt; manage to bury her in a snowbank a block from home. I did buy some
&gt; chains, but never had to use them. We now want a syncro more than
&gt; ever!
&gt; 
We just got home from a 19 day trip to MD (Tom Forham's party), VA, WV,
TN, GA, AL, GA, NC, VA, WV, VA, WV, MD, PA, NY, ON (Ontario) and then
got stuck 1 km from home. So a syncro just lets you get stuck further
from home. 
&gt; 
&gt; VW Content: Does anyone know how the Propex heater compares to a
&gt; 1500W electic, in terms of heat output? At -16C, the electric could
&gt; barely maintain 15C (~60f) inside the van.

The Propex 1600 is rated at 5200BTU which _at_ 0.293 Watt-hour/BTU = 1523.6
Watts.
On the side of the Propex Furnace it actually says that the input is
1600W and delivers 1300W output (probably wastes 300W in the exhaust).
