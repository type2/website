Subject: Oil temp sensor

Hi

Gary asks about an oil temp sensor on a T above the oil cooler. Nope. 
Won't work. BTDT. Actually the guy who had the car before me WTDT (I'm 
getting almost as good as Thom, making these things up on the fly :-)

Anyway, I have a sensor at the bottom of the oil fill pipe. Next to the 
alternator. I removed the filler pipe, but it should be possible to have 
the right size nut welded to the side of the pipe. Best is, you don't 
have to remove the engine.

ObNOTVW :) It SNOWED on Table Mountain! First time in living memory (_My_ 
living memory, snowed 10 years ago but _nothing_ like this.) For those of 
you not in the know, Table Mountain is not very high and right next to 
the sea. Never snows.

ObVW : I need heat in my car! Brrr :)
