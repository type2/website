Subject: Buy my '65 Single cab

Howdy all.
 If you missed my last post, I just bought a new '67 camper, so I must reduce
my inventory of type II's. So, with regret, I must offer up my '65 single cab.
It runs, on a freshly rebuilt 1300 single port engine, with new 30/31 pict
carb.
However, it has the infamous &quot;bungee fourth gear&quot;, so the transaxle will
eventually need rebuilding. It is mostly 12V (I bought it partially converted)
And needs the windshield wiper motor/assembly.
The body has some rust, and the bed is in bad shape, but the frame is sound.
Basically, it is a great daily-driver work truck as it is. It would take some
time/money to restore the body, but it wouldn't be impossible. It has the
aftermarket fence-type rear gates, which I personally think look better than
the originals, as I like the lines better.
Anyway, I don't really want to sell it, but I need money, and space, so...
I would like $1100, but that is highly negotiable.
Anyway, if anyone is interested, just e-mail me, and I can give my phone number
if you want. The bus is in Raleigh, NC.
Thanks,
Richard
