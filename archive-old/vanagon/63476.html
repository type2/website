Subject: '73 Westie for sale

I have a '73 Westie for sale.  Arizona car, so no rust.  No dents.  Orange
paint in very good condition.  Interior very nice, except for one broken
cabinet latch and the sink faucet/pump not being there.  Auto trans.

Engine... Compression 30 &amp; 50 in 1 &amp; 2.  Zero in 3 &amp; 4.  Very possible the
engine may need work. Very very possible.  Count on it.  Was being driven
by my son until a couple of weeks ago when the engine died.

$600
