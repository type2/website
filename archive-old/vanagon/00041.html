re replacing components in ecu
	I was surprised to see your post - i had assumed these things were 
mostly one pr two 'custom' ICs - very little you can do with these unless
you can manipualte Si at the molecular level - 
	you cant usually just replace 'bad' components in 'complex' (defined
as more than 15 discrete components) as there is usually trimming etc to
be done to get the ciruit to work as advertised.
	But if there are only 15-30 components in the thing, not including
decoupling caps , etc, it can probably be figured out by analysis - a good
project during a boring football game - if someone has a dead one i'll have 
a look at it and see where i can get ...

btw anyone tried recycled inc for a used ecu?

(i havent looked at mine because my diesel aint got one   :-)
