You were close! PO ran the ignition switch wire to a key switch on the 
RH side of the dash, then to the lights, then to a pushbutton on the LH 
side of the dash. My new suspect in the fire is the key switch on the RH 
side - if the case of the stereo touched his 
less-than-perfectly-insulated connection over there, that could have 
done it - you win the Smokey the Bear prize for unexplained vehicle fire 
explanation!
