Subject: Type 1 V S Explorer head on

Two weekends ago  was heading down the mountain from skiing when all the 
traffic ahead of me started to slow down.  We came around a corner and there 
was a huge fire up ahead.  The fire covered the two lanes on my side of the 
road and reached about 30 feet in the air.  There was a slew of fire trucks 
already there when all of sudden the color of the flames changed from orange 
to very bright yellow.  So I said to myself that looks like magnesium burning.  
Apparently there was ice on either the Explorer or the T1 slid into the other.  
On that stretch of the average speed is aroud 65MPH.  It was the T1 that was 
on fire, hence the yellow flame.  I did not get to see the vehicles except for 
a brief shot on the news of the T1.  Tront end was  bashed in 2 foot and of 
course totally gutted by the fire.  There was 2 people in the T1 and 2 in the 
Explorer.  The 2 in the T1 walked away and one person died in the Explorer.  
Just another story, did not want to spread gloom.
