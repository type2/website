Subject: Re: unplug '86 idle stabilizer?

In a message dated 97-05-21 12:13:19 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I have had my idle stabilizer, 1987 2.1l, unplugged for about 4 months.  =
 My VW dealer actually disconnected it, I have since added a switch to =
 turn it on for cold starts.  The idle was at 2000 before it was =
 disconnected, it ran at about 1000 for a while, now it's back up to =
 2000.  When the idle stabilizer is connected it idles between 3000 and =
 3500.  To get the RPM's down I now turn on the A/C.  I believe my =
 problem might be related to the hole in my exhaust that I haven't fixed =
 yet, I have the pipe, just not the bolts yet.  I hope the idle goes down =
 when I fix the exhaust, do you think the exhaust is the problem?  &gt;&gt;

I think it is likely the Idle Stabilizer Control Unit.  It's located forward
of the right tail light and looks like a large black relay.  Remove the tail
light to get access to it.
This happend to my 87 last spring.  I opened the control unit and found a
burnt componenent on the circuit board.  Replaced it and another component (a
capacitor) near it and it functions flawlessly still.  Components cost me
about $2.00.  I don't have the details of what I did, but I described it
pretty carefully when I did the work.  My message(s) should be able to be
found in the 1996 archives.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
