&gt; &gt;I have been wanting for some time to put a German plate

&gt; &gt;is the horizontal kind.  I do not want a personalized one, just an
&gt; &gt;original.  Helmut in Germany said he could get me one for $55 including
&gt; &gt;shipping.  Thanks a lot.  Have a great weekend.

&gt; Jan Peters (that lucky SOB) has an original German bumper on his '91
&gt; syncro, which has a licence plate indentation that matches the euro-style
&gt; plate.
