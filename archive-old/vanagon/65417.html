The 195/70's are way under sized.  In a normal tire, I would go to a 215/70.
In 205 or 195 you should get reinforced or at least a 6 ply rating.  The tire
side wall will tell you the tires carrying capacity.  Remember that when using
a passenger tire on a light truck, the tire should be de-rated 10%.
