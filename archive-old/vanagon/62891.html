Hello all,

My '84 westy is making a poping noise when I start it.  I can't tell if 
its a backfire or not, more like a small pop when the van first starts.  
It only happens when I restart the van after it has been running for a 
bit.  The van runs great, idle is alittle rough when it's cold, but no 
other problems.  The only time it makes this noise is when I first 
start it.  Any help on this would be great.

Thanks,
Mike D.
