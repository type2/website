Subject: '78 am I nuts??

Okay... 2nd post today.  Wow.  here the guff... Was cruising and spotted 
a 78 wesfaalia in local rural scrap yard.  Had my police officer brother 
look up the serial nu... 1 owner.  called said owner and said the tranny 
does not work in 1 or 2ND...  the body looks like it needs lots of work 
but motor apparently works well.  Oh yeah, brakes need attention all 
around.

I figure I might be able to get the thing for 500 dollars.  Should I.  
How much shoud a rebuilt tranny cost... can I have the orginal rebuilt? 
What about brakes?  Could a non-mechanic replace/repair them with Muir's 
help.

Advice sought folks... 

Barry!
