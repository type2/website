&gt;	Maybe I didn't make myself clear.  The problem is, when the
&gt;motor is OFF I do not have to press the clutch pedal to switch gears.
&gt;When the motor is off, I can easily move the transmition into whatever
&gt;gear I want without pressing the clutch pedal.  Whith the motor
&gt;running, you need to press the clutch pedal down to switch gears.

That is not a &quot;problem,&quot; its normal.  I think your hunting for problems you
don't have.

You should be able to shift gears without the cluthch with the motor
RUNNING, er, (while you're driving.)  Truckers do it all the time.
