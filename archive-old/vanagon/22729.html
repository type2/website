&gt;Speaking of which... wasn't there a VW ad circa 1969 which went something
&gt;like this: &quot;if Ted Kennedy owned a VW beetle...

Actuall it was a spoof ad in the June 1973 issue of the National Lampoon..
the heading of which read: &quot;If Ted Kennedy drove one of these...
he'd be President today!&quot;...
