&gt;        Does anyone out there know the approx prices of a 1950-60 VW
&gt;MicroBus? (I'm not sure about the production dates, but I know it's
&gt;the one with the split-pane front windshield...) :)

The split windo busses were made from '52 (?) - '67.

&gt;        I say priceS (plural) because I'm wondering the various different
&gt;prices for the van in running condition, in a condition in which it &quot;needs
&gt;work&quot;, etc. And how easy is it to restore (only to satisfactory running
&gt;condition) the original engines? Did any of these come in automatic??
&gt;        And about how much (on average) would one have to spend to get
&gt;a micro-bus running? (I know these are VERY broad questions that depend
&gt;on the van in question, but I'm hoping I'll get some response!)

My 1959 Pickup Truck (like a bus, but with a pickup truck rear) cost $1000
to buy and another $1000 or so to get running safely and well. Watch for
engine swaps and stuff. Mine has a '65ish engine and transmission. I had to
do the brake cylinders, swing lever bushings, new tie rods, new master
cylinder, a gas tank to replace the homemade 40gal tank, lots of new
wiring, a new battery, new (well, junkyard) wheels, new tires, a new rear
drum 'cause the old one had to be cut off, etc, etc. I still need to do a
lot of rubber and body work and everything else.

Maybe it was more than $1000. I think after a while, I didn't really want
to keep track! Pickups are kind of rare, so the initial high price was
probably ok. I could still spend thousands of dollars getting the body
perfect, but it's a truck, and I want it to be rough so I don't have to
worry about it.

Don't know if my broad answer covers your broad question.
