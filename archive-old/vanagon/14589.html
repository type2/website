&gt;Subject: save this bus!
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine has decided to get rid of his '71 bus. He's had it
&gt;for years. I don't want to see it end up at the ecology dump, so if
&gt;anybody out there wants it, he's going to practically give it away.
&gt;The engine is in pieces, since he was going to rebuild it.  The
&gt;registration needs $40 and a smog certificate to bring it current.
&gt;I'm sure that he'd sell it for $100.
&gt;
&gt;I'd buy it, but I already have two.
