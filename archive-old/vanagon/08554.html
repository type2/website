Final reminder:

There will be a pizza dinner on Thursday, December 22nd at 7 PM at Kapp's
(formerly known as Stuft Pizza), 191 Castro, Mountain View, California. I
asked about the name change, but they assured me that it's still the same
owner and there have been no other changes. Their phone number is (415)
961-1491. 

All Vanagon list members and their families and friends are invited to
join in the fun. This is your chance to show your 4-wheeled pride and joy,
the real thing or pictures. Bill Abbott will bring his camera, so give
that bus a high buff and be ready to smile:)

I made reservations for 10-15 people under &quot;vanagon list,&quot; our company
name.  Kapp's informed me that there will be a minimum charge of $4 per
head. 15% gratuity will be added and they expect to give us only one bill.
(We'll have to decide who gets to charge it to their Shell/Amoco
MasterCard and earn all that free gasoline :-) .)

For directions, here are, once again, both Patrick Tower's and Dave
Kautz's explanations: 

&gt;Get yourself onto 101 (hopefully people can figure out how to get there
&gt;from their various home-bases), and take the Moffet Blvd. exit toward
&gt;Mountain View (as opposed to toward Moffet Field).  This exit is just
&gt;south of the 85 interchange, to give you a point of reference.
&gt;Follow Moffet until it crosses Central Expressway.  You will now be
&gt;magically transported to the 100 block of Castro (the street changes
&gt;names at Central).  Stuft will be near the end of the block on the left.

&gt;From 280, I think it would be best to get off at El Monte, head east down
&gt;to El Camino, turn right and go south to Castro, where you would turn left
&gt;and find Stuft on your right 4 or 5 blocks up.

Remember, though, it's now called KAPP's!

Looking forward to seeing you there!
