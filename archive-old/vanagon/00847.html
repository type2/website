Subject: Re: oxy sensors $$$$

Sorry about my little bandwidth impact of a moment ago, I pushed send when I 
wanted to push delete.

Anyway, I've always just pushed the reset button to turn off the &quot;oxy&quot; light 
for 125k miles (It comes on every 30k).  Will anything bad eventually 
happen?  If so what are the symptoms?  I've always assumed that on 
presenting this problem to a dealer he would reset the light, tell me he 
fixed the car, and collect a lot of money without really changing anything, 
I'm probably too cynical.
