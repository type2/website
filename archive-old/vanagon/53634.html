Subject: RE : Bleeding Brake Lines

In reply to a problem/question....one piece
of advice  received from the stationary
engineer at my office was to let the van
sit for a long time...overnight, and to
press the peddle very, very gently. My
engineer friend says a large amount of
pressure makes one bubble into
thousands.  

The value of this advice was confirmed by
both &quot;Neighbour Tim&quot; and the pleasing
sight and sound of air in the tube when
bleeding a left-rear nipple.

My kids help with this chore and even
gave me a set of curved-needle-nose Vice
Grips for Christmas.
