  1981 Westfalia camper.
  The body is a bit rusty on the drivers side but the motor is rebuilt
  and the interior is redone. About 100,000 miles on vehicle. Sleeps 4
  with the pop up top. Has a sink and water tank with ice box fridge. It
  does NOT have the gas option for cooking. New tires and front end
  suspension pieces. Very nice summer fun car. It is located 25 miles
  west of Boston. I am asking $3000. Please email directly - Brett
