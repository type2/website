Subject: Rust spots

This weekend, I was preping my '89 Westy to be sandblasted to fix some
rust spots around the valve covers.  

I was trying to get access to the three valve covers from inside to make
sure I got all the rust.  I was able to get at the first two from inside 
(electricity and gas) by removing the fridge, but the one for water is 
behind a cabinet and there is a back panel on the cabinet.  Short of 
removing all of the cabinets from the Westy, is there someway to get 
access to the water attachement from inside?  I was considereing 
cutting an access hatch in the back panel.

Anyone have any comments?

Kedar
