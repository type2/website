Howdy!

	I don't know if this will get thru or not...

	Well, I'm still employed!  Thanks for all the support!  I got over
30 messages of support, and 5 people wrote to my by and cc:'d me!  I don't
know if he read them yet - I'm mailed him some un-related stuff and he 
hadn't responded yet...
	
	I spent a lot of time fuming and working on the bus, more of the former
than the latter, unfortunately...

	I prepped the entire back end and shot surfacer on it, so after a 
getting a few more little dents taken care of the entire back hald will be
read for paint.  THen I gotta finish the driver's side behind the door,
and then the whole thing under the roof is done.  I gotta do some work to
a couple of spots on the roof, and then I'm ready to block out the whole 
bus with 220, 400 and 600, and then paint.

	Thanks again for the support.  I'm gonna get a ISP account, prolly
netcom, just gotta get off my butt and do it...
