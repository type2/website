&gt;Any comments?
I have heard that the wrong PH (due to old antifreeze) will cause many 
problems besides just the radiator etc. I would think though that a 
regular flush prevent any problems, and this would be my first choice for 
preventative maintanance.  On furthur thought though, with the amount of 
coolant required for this system, an additive would be cheaper.
