&gt;Anywho, the short of it is there is a small nitrogen bladder in the
&gt;can which releases its stuff when the can is opened...&lt;snip&gt;


IMHO Boddingtons is better(same sort of can), but printed on the can is
the phrase &quot;Do not tamper even when empty&quot; or something similar. I guess the
bladder is filled with radioactive nitrogen, kind of like the inside of the
radioactive bouncy stuff inside of a golf ball, eh? :-)


Cheers,
