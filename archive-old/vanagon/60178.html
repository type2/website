&gt; As I understand it though, a negative camber on the right wheel should

&gt; current state of alignment is irrelevant to my problem, what other causes

&gt; This is beyond my areas of expertise, so any knowledge of the list would

The above sounds a little fishy to me too.  Before you spend a lot of
money, switch the front tires.  One day my '83 started pulling hard to
the right.  Switched the front tires, and sure enough, it pulled hard to
the left!  Put the tire on the back and all was well, except the tire
ran hot, so I replaced it.

If something is loose in the front end, you should be able to feel it. 
If it is out of line, you can frequently see it.  Do the cheap tire
check first.
