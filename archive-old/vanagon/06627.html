&gt; 
&gt; All this talk of catalytic heaters, the lack of heat in air-cooled
&gt; Vanagons, the impending cold winter and the need for making this a better
&gt; world, got me thinking about the possible choices of heat available and
&gt; their practical application in air-cooled Vnagaon busses. Here are some ideas:

&gt; Choices:

&gt; upside - Marlin fishing 
&gt; downside - may become a bubba

Indee -- ah say, indeed, suh!  Frankly, your ethnic sensitivity
shows need of some schoolin'.  Howevah, I am willin' to ignore your lack
of good mannahs, especially in light of the fact that should you choose --
as have several million of your blue-skinned northern brethren -- to
repair to these southern climes as our genetically superior ancestors did
lo these many generations ago, please do rest assured that, so long as you
select a place south of I-4 (even, sadly, many places north of it), you
are sure to be among like-minded, black-speedoed, dunlop-bellied Canadjuns
-- with nary a bubba in sight.

&gt; In a previous post, it was said that the wheel bearings don t come out to 
&gt; be greased.  It is very easy to remove the bearings.  First, remove the 

Yes -- if you call removing 12 crud-covered, heat-welded cap screws per side 
easy :-).

&gt; driveshaft.  Then, drive out the stub axle, finally remove the snap rings 
&gt; on both sides of the bearing carrier.  Now, the bearings will come out!
&gt; 

OY! As I recall from doing this job on my now-departed (snif) '68 Westy, 
these are the _archetypal_ snap-rings, the mothers-of-all-etc., the 
eaters-of-cheap-snap-ring-pliers and fliers-off-in-your-flinching-face 
big muthas.  Just to frighten the uninitiate...

But they do come out, and (unghh, twist, OK) it _is_ worthwhile to have a 
look at those bearings as long as you've gone that far.
