Subject: 15&quot; or 16&quot;....That is the question!

So I am getting really close to ordering new wheels and tires 
for my 87 westy.  Here are my probable choices:

215X60 R15 on 15X7 Borbet Replica II's
OR
215X55 R16 on 16X8 Borbet Replica II's

These wheels will fit the van and have proper load handling according to 
Max at the TireRack.  Not sure yet on tires but hopefully light truck 
tires..

Any comments on which I should go with????  Both offer about the same 
rolling diameter.  The 16&quot; option is a little more spendy.  I have 
gotten good feedback on the 215X60 R15 combination and it is my current 
favorite.  I would hate to miss an opportunity to get the best handling 
though so I throw this out to you.
