Busy weekend so far:

	Made new kick panels, using some out of a '64 that were lent to me.
His didn't fit at all, so I made a copy and then edited the copy (and the
checked it back into SCCS :)

	Installed a brand new 009 distributor ($60 - OUCH! - I remember when
they were $30, and sometimes on sale for $20!)  The bus runs much smoother
and cooler now.

	I have a 050 disttributor for sale.  Good to use if you have dual/big
carbs and hot cam.  My bone stock 1600 don't do it justice...

	Installed the new headlights I got last week.  I'd taken them
apart, hot tanked them, and painted them. I went with a gray color instead
of white like everyone does.  I did the last ones white, and after about
6 months they looked kinda dowdy.  I think the head of the bulb does it.
At least I can adjust them now!

	One bummer, however - when I was picking the &quot;perfect lights&quot; out
of the pile the guy had for sale, I inadvertantly got 2 RIGHT ones!  I need
to get a left one now to really do this right (no pun intended) anyone got
a left (even a set is fine) they wanna get rid of?

	In preparation for a surf trip tomorrow, I put some new rubber aorund
the front doors - just some stuff I had laying around.  My driver'd door
doesn't align very well, and this stuff goes a long way to taking up the 
slack.

	Bummer #2 - My surfboard (9' 4&quot; Pearson) _barely_ fits in the bus.
So much for going to a bigger board :(  Tomorrow will be another big test  -
first big trip since Bodega, and that was a near disaster!  I'm gonna be
surfing at Pedro Point, in Pacifica, if anyone wants to join me for dawn 
patrol...
