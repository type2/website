The only thing the FLAPS had -- Mobil 75-90. It was expenseive - over $7 a
quart, but with the way I deal with this stuff, and with how scared I am
of taking the manifold off again (a must for draining the tranny IMHO) I
probably will never change the tranny fluid again unless it breaks, so I
gritted my teeth and bought it.

Thanks for the advice. I'll put at least one back on right away -- no 
welding will be necessary and I'll start contemplating the other....
