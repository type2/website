Thanks, Derek.  Your explanation makes the most sense so far.  I will
check my wiring to see if this is what is happening.  There must be more to
this relay that meets the eye though as I recall the fridge never did work
on 12 volt power when the van was not running. However  the cooling fan
of the fridge would operate when parked, engine not running and fridge
working on propane.  Also the camper water pump worked all the time,
engine running or not.

Cheers

Frank
