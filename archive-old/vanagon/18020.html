I will probably try to be there just to meet you guys. The only problem
is I probably cannot drive my Vanagon since I am still looking
for a catalytic converter and complete exhaust system before the shoebox
can pass inspection. Anybody knows where I can get something for less 
than the $900.00 Vw is charging?
