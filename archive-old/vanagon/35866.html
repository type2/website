Subject:       More Frustration

Hey all:

This concerns the intermitent stuttering of my 84 vanagon GL at 
highway speeds. Unfortunately, stopping turning off the bus, etc. did 
not work this time. I am now confounded by this problem. Here are 
some stats.

1. In the morning after the car warms up, if you press on the gas pedal 
    slightly the engine will rev/die rev/die etc.

2. The grounding strap from the engine to the bulkhead has eroded and 
    has snapped (awhile ago I might add)

3. On injector 3 the plastic case over the wire has cracked and is 
     partially exposed

4. Tonight was a rainy night ( i.e water on the engine)

3.  Tonight while driving at highway speeds, I noticed that I 
     accelerate to reach 65 then back off the accelerator until 
     the pedal is slightly engaged. BAM, it starts again. Then I floor it, 
     or press the pedal into the middle range and it goes away. I tried 
     this 20 times, and all times the above was repeated. Oh yeah, the 
     problem doesn't start for about 5-7 miles of highway driving and 
     does not occur (noticably anyway) in the city? Could I have a hole in 
     my vacuum system?- throttle body? Anybody? 

Thanks

Matt
