Subject: Re: stealing vee wee symbol

&gt;needless to say the front panel wasn't a pretty sight by the time they
&gt;finally pried off the VW sign. In some ways i think painiting a VW sign on
&gt;the bus might be less strssful that having the real thing on their and
&gt;worrying about people stealing it. It is hard to say, the decision is

        How's about making one out of paperboard, then sealing it with some
sort of waterproffing stuff?  I'd love to see some dipsh*t's face when he
started pulling and the dammned thing went to pieces in his hand!!!   ;-)

Peace,
