Subject: 70 Bus - Too Tall In The Saddle

My most recent acquisition, a 70 bus, sits about 3&quot; taller in front than
what would appear to me to be normal.  As far as I can tell, the front end
is stock.

What would be a reasonable way to bring the front end down, short of 
investing in a front end from BusBoys?
