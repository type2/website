Subject: Re: How come so slow up hill?

&gt;At least Lisa has figured out why her Vanagon had no power. Way to go Lisa!
Now if the rest of us could figure it out then we'd be in business!

&gt;D'oh! Can you say &quot;check the ATF after you pull the engine stupid!&quot; 
&gt;That's why we had no power. The ATF had drained out of the torque 
&gt;converter after we pulled the engine. Thanks for all the suggestions 
&gt;on what our problem could have been!
