&gt;I think I have one from a 63-64 bus.  Is that early enough?

Sorry, no.  The engine lid I need is the first one they used after the
barn doors, and only goes thru '56.  From then to '66, they were different,
and '66 and '67 are different still.

The one I need does NOT have the &quot;bump&quot; that covers the license plate light,
and has a third brake light where the bump should be.  

Sorry, but I'm kinda anal about this.

I am also looking for early front and back bumpers.  By early I mean pre-
'57(?) the thin bumpers that never had provisions for bows and
overriders.  They also have a raised section in the middle of the bumper,
this was stamped into the bumper - not a trim strip.

Anyone who has seen one of these around that may be for sale, please
give me a holler!
