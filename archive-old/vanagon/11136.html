&gt; Several years ago I attemted to find the ONE TRUE ANSWER on importing a
&gt; vehicle from the U.S. to Canada. As with this situation, it was difficult
&gt; to get a straight response from the various governmental agencies involved.
I would assume, then, that it would be nigh impossible to import a
Mexican/Brazilian VW into Canada? (as good a reason to emigrate
as any, I guess)
