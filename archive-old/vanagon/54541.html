&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I'm posting this to both lists because these are relatively general
&gt;questions.
&gt;
&gt;First:  A few days ago I noticed a screeching sound (low-pitched, like a
&gt;metal on metal sound) coming from the engine somewhere when I first
&gt;started it up.  This is an '81 Vanagon, 2000cc air-cooled engine.  Today
&gt;I investigated further and I've isolated the sound as coming from the
&gt;alternator.  I can't tell if it's the pulley rubbing on the housing or
&gt;if it's inside the alternator.  The sound disappears when the engine
&gt;warms up.  So is it alt. bearings or something?  Is my alternator on the
&gt;way out or is the very cold weather lately (single digits last night)
&gt;having an effect on the grease (or whatever lube) in the alternator?
&gt;The alternator has been charging normally, no red light on or anything
&gt;like that.  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Next, I need to get a real CB antenna.  I had one of those clip-on rain
&gt;gutter mount jobbies from Wal-Mart because I couldn't find a place to
&gt;mount a real one.  Well, the Wal-Mart jobby is rusting all to hell
&gt;already (only been on there a couple months) so i removed it before the
&gt;rust spread to my raingutter.  The problem is that I still haven't been
&gt;able to think of a good place to mount a CB antenna.  If this were a
&gt;regular Vanagon I'd just use a magnet-mount antenna on the roof but this
&gt;is a Westy.  No magnet mount here.  I was looking at mounting it on the
&gt;rear bumper but there's no way to mount it so that it doesn't interfere
&gt;with the rear hatch.  I would have to mount it on the plastic end cap if
&gt;I wanted to get in the back of the van without removing the antenna.
&gt;
&gt;In short, I'm out of ideas.  I know a lot of you Westy drivers have CBs
&gt;so where did you mount the antenna?

I put a permanent mount on the exterior right read panel of my van.  I have
a quick-release mount screwed into the permanent mount.  The antenna runs
up about 4&quot; from the rear of the pop-top, and sticks about a foot over the
top of the van.  Since it's a top-loaded antenna, that works pretty well.

I had to think a bit about adding a permanent hole to my van, but this was
the cleanest solution I could come up with.  And it does look pretty good.
