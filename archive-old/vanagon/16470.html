ok, i'll be serious, too.  at one point i had a thunking problem too. 
how's your clutch?  i tightened mine a little and fixed the 'thunk'


&gt;  &gt; 
&gt; &gt;my shifter used to not feeel to good too...IT FIXED ITSELF !!!!!  the
&gt; &gt;procedure was as follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;talk really nicely [read 'curse violently'] to your reverse gear while
&gt; &gt;pushing your van backwards.  go out to drive it one day and discover that
&gt; &gt;not only has reverse returned from the dead, but _everything_felt good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;simple huh?
&gt; 
&gt; So that's the problem... I'm using wrong procedures and tools! Trashcan the
&gt; Craftsman stuff, parts, and moly grease... turn to the Karma section in
&gt; St. Muir! Practical, makes sense, feels right, and it's free! and worth
&gt; every penny of it, for sure!
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, Bob, my '71 tranny seems fine once I get it into gear-- no popping
&gt; out, grinding, whining, etc. But getting it in can be an interesting
&gt; exercise. Is the gear after first going to be second, or reverse (ouch!)?
&gt; And after slowing for a corner, I coast blithely through the intersection
&gt; with cars piling up behind me, as I try for the sixth, then seventh, then
&gt; eighth, etc. time to get it into second. Finally (when I make it an offer it
&gt; can't refuse) it goes in with a loud CLUNK, and away we go.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at the little cagelike connector between the shifter and the
&gt; tranny nosecone, it looks shiny and new. But several folks have suggested
&gt; replacing a bushing that exists somewhere in that general vicinity, and one
&gt; has suggested looking for worn surfaces on the steel shift fork inside the
&gt; tranny nosecone. Sounds good!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx for the info so far, ladies and gents. This is a great list-- keep
&gt; up the great work!
