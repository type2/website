Subject: Re: $25,000 splits

&gt;&gt; OK you early busses. Take heart. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sunday's New York Times picked 14 cars most likely to increase in value in
&gt;&gt; the next few years and you guys made the list. Says the Times, &quot;1956-76
&gt;&gt; Volkswagen Microbus. Current value: $1,000 to $8,000. Five-year projection:
&gt;&gt; up to $25,000.&quot;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;While it is good that the projected value of these buses does go up (not really
&gt;unexpected) an owner or prospective buyer should be aware that the value will
&gt;decrease depending on the condition as well as the year.  The later the year
&gt;the lesser the value.  In other words, I find it hard to believe that in five
&gt;years that a '76 bus will be valued at $25,000 even in pristine condition.
&gt;You also have to find someone willing to pay you that much for your baby.
&gt;
&gt;The real value should be derived from caring for and driving your Type II.

And telling anyone who will listen that &quot;No, really, it's worth $25,000...
honest&quot;
