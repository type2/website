         &lt;&lt; I just got another set of VW Vanagon alloy wheels for sale.  If
         anyone is  interested let me know.  The price is $650 plus
         shipping for a set of four which includes the small hub caps in
         the center and the special lugs and nuts. the wheels are located
         in Los Angeles but UPS can ship anywhere and I can deliver them to
         San Francisco
           &gt;&gt;

         for that price, you should throw in the 5th one (the spare)....
         don't you think?



     Hey, Chris!

     Lighten up! %)

     At $13 per for lug nuts and $11 per for the caps, that's only $346 for
     the four wheels.

     (Sorry, couldn't resist!  Been traumatized by dealer prices for too
     long!)
