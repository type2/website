Subject: CV bolt stories, different kinds of car people

	When we did all four on my Rabbit, I probably put anti-sieze on
em, if anything. No problems in the next, oh 40,000 miles. Between my 
brother, his wife, myself and my late wife, I think we have something
like 500,000 miles of VW driving on CV equiped cars, and we've never
lost a bolt. I'm persuaded by Bob's numbers that this is exactly
what to expect. 

	I saw a 911 turbo do the klunk-vroom! thing at the
start of an autocross- four CV bolts had backed out, one
of those had dropped out and was gone, the other three were still
present, and the remaining two had sheared when the cars owner
had put her foot into it.
	Since she had dumped the clutch just before the klunk, she
and a number of the P-heads thereby figured it must be a clutch
problem, but a klunk followed by no motion is NOT a normal
clutch symptom. I slid under the car and saw the shaft lying on
the ground.

	The Beck 550 is built in part with 914 parts, and as a non-factory
item earns some scorn from the looney fringe. I saw one on the street
once and it was BEAUTIFUL. One thing I've noticed about P-heads- the one's 
I've met who hang with the Porsche Club of America (PCA) tend to be a lot 
like the people on this list, social, inclusive, a bit warped, ok, real 
warped, but also very warm. They tend to feed strangers at their gatherings 
and regard people by the content of their character.
 
	But there are also obnoxious fools in the P-car and V-car worlds- 
guys (yes, usually) who don't think a 9xx is a 'real' Porsche, guys who 
think split-window beetles and barn-door vans are 'classic' but nothing 
else after. Its interesting to me that such people are easy to find
at swap meets and shows, but tend to run thin in clubs and places like
this list. I owned one of the worlds rattiest 914s and was always warmly
welcomed by the various Bay Area PCA groups. I own a non-functional VW
Transporter and I'm welcome here (or at least no-one's thrown me out yet...)

	Happy motoring!
