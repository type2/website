Subject: raining in the vanagon, part 3

Ok, I tried to shove a metal rod up the AC drain hoses.  On the passenger 
side, I could not get it up too far because of the angle, but I don't 
think that's the side that's clogged anyway (some sticky stuff appeared 
on the end of the rod).  On the driver's side, it went in a ways and then 
was impeded by something.  I tried pusching it further , but I didn't 
want to force it too much.  I think the clog may be at the point where 
the hoses meet the water collection tray.  So, what's the best way to get 
access to these points?  I'd prefer to dismantle as little as possible.

Just for your info again, it doesn't start really dripping until I've 
beeen driving with the AC on for at least an hour sometimes 2 hours.

Thanks again for the help.
