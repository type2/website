Subject: Lost the Idle adjust screw! ('84)

I was trying to adjust the idle on my '84 yesterday, and apparently 
unscrewed the adjustment screw too far, since it is now missing. (I 
quickly learned that you can't do much with the idle screw without 
disconnecting the idle stabilizer, so I just left it alone until I could 
get to the Bently manual)

So, does anyone have an idle screw, or a damaged throttle body kicking 
around?

I'm going to try the dealer tomorrow, but I would be suprised if they 
sell the screw by itself, and I don't want to think about what a throttle 
body would cost!

BTW: it runs fine if I plug the hole, and apparently ran fine even with a 
massive vacuum leak once the engine was warm enough for the oxygen sensor 
to do its thing!

Bill
