&gt;	Someone mentioned something about Bosch books
&gt;(stop me if I'm being too specific)
&gt;	Anyway, SAE is always advertising a Bosch Automotive
&gt;handbook, and a Bosch Fuel Injection book.
&gt;	Has anyone seen either of these? I've been tempted to
&gt;buy them, but would like to hear from someone that has them,or
&gt;has seen them as to their general usefullness.
&gt;(it also just occurs to me that I should check the libraries around
&gt;here, eh?)

i have both, and the Bosch Automotive Handbook is a really neat little blue
book ... but it is EXTREMELY technical, full of data and formulae for the
engineer. but where else will you find the power consumed by the brake lights
of &quot;average&quot; cars? or the &quot;meaning&quot; of the numbers on the DIN/German
electrical parts (did you know that 85 is always &quot;ground&quot;??)?

is it worth the money? well ... it's like some tools that you use only once
a year: if nothing else works, it's priceless. :) but the Bosch Handbook is
NOT something you will use each day, or week, or even month. maybe once a
year. it does, however, have more data and information about automobiles
than you will ever be able to understand or use.
