Subject: The transitional engine...  

Greetings all,
  I'm getting a bit of conflicting information as to what actually fails on
wasserbox motors to make them fail.  Is it the head gasket failing, the heads
corroding, or some sort of blockage in the cooling system that causes the
leaks.  My '84 had less than 50,000 miles on it before the head gaskets went
(at least that's what the dealer said failed).  My mother's '90 needed new
gaskets at around 55,000 miles; the repair was performed within the last two
months.  If it's the head corroding, I wonder if anybody has considered
making a stronger, more corrosion resistant version.  
  I've also heard of a cryogenic procedure performed on all sorts of items
that increases toughness and wear resistance; I wonder if this would work on
aluminium cylinder heads...

Ryan
