Subject:       Middle Seat for Sale

HEy all:

I am finally getting rid of my middle seat ( Brown seat belts work 
fine,etc.) from my bus '84 Vanagon GL. I'd like to sell it to someone 
who could use instead of drop it off at the junkyard to sit and rot. 
If you are in the Chicago area, and are interested drop me a line. 
I'll be back next Tuesday (22).

Cheers

MAtt
