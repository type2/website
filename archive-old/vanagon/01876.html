hmmmmm. when you moved the 'whole thing' over to the 84, did you move the
coolant temp sensors as well (oh, god! is he gonna start THAT again!?).
the reason i ask is that my gauge went wacko, and for some reason, i
suspected the gauge sender, not the engine. so i replaced it ... surprise!
the gauge works again. now, this is NOT the coolant temp sensor for the
computer. there should be TWO senders on the thermostat housing: one for the
gauge and one for the computer.

my train of thought here is that maybe the gauge sender was bad all along.
and the initial dealer just 'fixed' the thermostat to make the gauge 'look'
normal.

just a thought.
