So Dave Mancuso says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have to stop here and let the cat out of the bag.  Thom sheepishly
&gt; &gt;admitted that he is considering a watercooled daily driver.  As I 
&gt; &gt;suspected, the comfort level of his '56 is severely lacking on these 106 
&gt; &gt;degree days. :)  Sorry Thom, but I just couldn't resist letting that 
&gt; &gt;out.....  :)
&gt; I know I've given in and gotten a wasserboxer, but I thought _some_ 
&gt; people around here had some integrity!  Thom, it's too late for me, but 
&gt; I'm shocked that you're weakening!   ;-)

I just remembered that Thom is not on this list anymore....  So should
I forward my original message to the aircooled list???  :)

tick-tick-tick.....
