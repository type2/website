Subject: Digest mode &lt;--&gt; Eudora



All:
I've been in digest mode for a little while now so that I can get some work
done during the day.  I just now got around to writing a little filter to
&quot;undigestify&quot; the digests.  It is a short C program that that reads from one
PC Eudora mailbox (e.g., vanagon.mbx) and write the contents out to another
mailbox (e.g. undigest.mbx).  I have tested it a little and it seems to work
great.  When Eudora starts after this program has run, it then creates a new
table of contents with the appropriate original messages!  The only minor
problem is that the messages are marked as read, but you can easily select
all, then change the status of the messages.

Let me know if anyone would like a copy of the program.  I can post the
code, or mail the executable to interested parties.

John
