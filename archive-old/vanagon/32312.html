Hi Jim,

I have been told by a windshield epair guy that the strip is not 
replacable while the window is in the van (unlike other trim strips where 
you could ease the strip into the crack with a nifty little tool). The 
vanagon trim strip works to further lock the rubber into the body. The 
cross-section of the strip shows a &quot;T&quot; profile wiht the upright of the 
&quot;T&quot; insertred into the channel in the rubber (and is barbed). I was 
sufficiently daunted by the repairmans opinion to leave my strip alone, 
but if I had some time I would dig some of the rotten strip out and 
verify all this palaver. Oh BTW, I was also told that the window holds in 
fine without the strip, and that the crack/channel in the rubber closes 
enough to be cosmetically acceptable?!

If you repair your window let us know how it goes.
