I just checked around for prices of drums and shoes. This is what I got:

    VW dealer:       drum : $178.95 each
                     shoes: $77.25 set

    FLAPS:           drum : $75 each (Brazilan)
                            $84 each (German)
                     shoes: $18.00 set

Can't resist the off brand prices. But I doubt that the shoes are any good.
Any suggestions?
