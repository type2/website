Subject: Wanted Vanagon GL

     We own a 1984 Vanagon GL with 220,000 miles on it.  We love the van but
are having enough repairs that we feel it is time to find a newer one.  We
are interested in a 91 Vanagon GL.   We have checked the classifieds
(Washington Post) and the Truck Trader and have found a few Vanagons but most
of them have been Eurovans or  Carats.  Does anyone have any idea where we
might link up with owners who want to sell?
     Also any information on the '91 Vanagon GL would be helpful.  We drove a
Eurovan and found the automatic transmission very sluggish.  We have a
standard on our van and wonder if  the automatic transmission on the 91
performs well.  Also we were told that repairs on an automatic can be very
costly compared to a standard.  Any  feedback?
     Our AC has never been very efficient--- is it any better on the later
models?
