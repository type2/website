Subject: Battery Plate plus leak question

hiya,

okay, one thing i've forgotten to do (forgotten cuz of these #$%#_at__at_! joints!)
is that i need to do something for my battery. the battery side has rusted out.
....there's no plate where the batter goes. right now i (get this) have a
pice of wood stuck in there that seems to fit finte but i need to find some
way to secure the battery. should i go ahead and fork over the $$$ to have
something weld something in? right now the $$$ is low. how much should
something like that cost?

one the other side, i noticed it's leaking...maybe through the air vents?
there's a good inch of water...any suggestions on stopping that? i'm thinking
about drilling a hole through the plate so the water won't stand. any ideas?

thanks yet again,


jonathan
