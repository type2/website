 It's not the computer! I would do a point to point check of the 
  wiring from engine to the computer. Sounds like a wiring problem
  to the Temp. sensor to me.

&gt; Lost power I40 outside of Albuq. New Mx, van would not build RPMS. After
&gt; stopping replacing a vaccum line on the fuel regulator, ran OK. Lost
&gt; ignition in Arizona, replaced Hall sender in distributor and Hall generator
&gt; (control unit) Power problem reapeared in Nevada running north on 95. Seems
&gt; after an overnight stop, it ran normal. I cleaned all the ground
&gt; connections but it did not seem to help. The power lose was not a surging
&gt; (like a fuel filter or pump) However, I did experience a surge(fuel or
&gt; ignition?) at one point, but only lasted a few secs. I have done most of
&gt; the elecrical test according to Bentley, all OK. Note I was pulling a
&gt; trailer/motorcycle.I am touring the westy coast now on the bike will pick
&gt; the van up later outside on Reno.
&gt; Need Suggestions:
&gt; 1. Should I replace the fuel pump/ filters?
&gt; 2. Think the Control Unit (Brain) is causing the problem?
&gt; 3. Could the altitude cause the problem?
&gt; 4. Know anyone in the area of Reno tht could find the problem?
&gt; 5. Anyone have a used control unit? Complete elecrtical?
&gt; I will be checkiing my E-mail before I leave Seattle in the next few days.
