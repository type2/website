Subject: Re: TIRES for VW Bus

&gt;OK,
&gt;
&gt;I've read the Tire FAQ, but now I want all the BUS FOLKS opinions.
&gt;
&gt;I have a 76 Westy and would like to get the correct tires for it.  
&gt;Right now it has passanger tires, but I am told that Light Truck or &quot;8 
&gt;ply&quot; tires are the correct ones.
&gt;
&gt;Want to purchase good but reasonable not the $100 a piece I was just 
&gt;quoted for Bridgestone 185 r14's 8 ply.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know what you all think out there.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help.
&gt;

   I just bought 5 new Michelin snow tires for my '79 Bus at Wal-Mart. 
They're not too radical a tread design, so I figure they'll be good on 
back roads, on the beach, the interstates and so on.
   They're P 195/75R14 X-MS-PLUS  M+S.  The manual calls for 185 diameter 
tires but I figure 195s aren't that far off.
   They cost $62.50 each, including mounting, spin balance, 70,000 
mile tread warranty and lifetime flat or blowout warranty good at 
any Wal-Mart.  They were remainders.
