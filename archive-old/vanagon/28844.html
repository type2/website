Subject: Will be in San Diego this Feb...

I'll be giving a paper at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego this
upcoming February 12-16.  Now, I know this is a long way off yet, but
I'm also thinking of tacking on a few days to head down into Baja for
my first exposure to mexican (west coast for that matter) surf.  I'd 
hate to take a rental down there as I understand there is some hassle
with the car rental companies about crossing the boarder but more importantly
I'd like to avoid the &quot;gringo tourist&quot; personna.  
Anybody going, living nearby, that would like to get together in San Diego
for BEER, Pizza, Surf or Baja trip?  Maybe rent me a VW bus?
