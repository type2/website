Subject: 71 camper

Melissa,

I sent you a message but I'm not sure if it went through so I will reply
again. I have a 78 TII and I was looking for a camper to fix up. I thought
I would keep the 78 until the camper was fixed and then sell the 78. I
think that $700.00 is more than I can spend. Thanks anyway and I hope you
find a good home for it. :-)
