Subject: NY's eve party at martha's


At the request of a few of you, I've decided it would be nice to have a New
Year's Eve party (this year it falls on a Sunday, but I assume most of you
have Monday off to recover  :).  Am willing to have this be another camp
out at my house/driveway, with like potluck munchies, snacks, etc.  I'm 
thinking starting let's say at 6 p.m.   No one will be allowed to leave
until they can count backwards by 7's, and walk a straight line.  :)

Let me know how many are coming.  If you don't have a camper and want to
sack out on the couch (or floor) as many did last year, that's fine too,
but bring whatever bedding you'll need, as I don't have enough for as many
as showed up last year.  Everyone's welcome.  If you want to come from out
of the area and want to arrive earlier and/or stay longer, let me know...
