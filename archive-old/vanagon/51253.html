Subject: yep, it's the back-up light switch
Date: Mon, 4 Nov 96 15:53:40 EST

Hey all,
I went down to the '81 to test the back-up light switch to make sure
that was the problem.  Looked at the Haynes wiring diagram and saw the
function of the switch.  I removed the two wires from the switch and
used my jumper wire (with handy alligator clips!) to connect the two
wires, effectively taking the switch out of the circuit.  The lights
came on when I did this (key on, of course).

So, next I pulled the switch.  I wasn't expecting the dripping out of
trans fluid.  That stuff stinks!  Anyway, I cleaned up the switch, it
had some gunk on it and I reinstalled it.  Put it in nice and tight.
So, I went up front and (key on) shifted it into reverse.  Walked back,
no lights.  Crawled under and banged on the switch body with my big
wrench, walked back and lights!  Shifted out of reverse, back into
reverse, no lights.  Bang on switch, lights.  Repeated this test a
couple times.  Seems to me to indicate a bad/worn switch.  Any othe
rideas?

There was a fellow who replied to my last post named Nelson and he
offered to send me one of the switches that he had.  Unfortunately, I
forgot Nelson's last name and e-mail address, so if he will contact me
again, I'd be grateful.

If anybody thinks it's not the switch, please let me know.

Thanks,
SEan
