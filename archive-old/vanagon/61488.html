Subject: RE: A good tire deal or not? 

Greg,

I would be very cautious about buying Pirelli tires in the USA or Canada.

If the tires are made in Europe, then they are probably a good buy.

But, if the tires are made in the USA, DO NOT BUY THEM!!!

Pirelli tire designs built in the USA are not comparable with those built in Europe for 
performance.  Also, Pirelli is having some real production quality problems with their USA 
plants. Pirelli is in the process of turning this around, but I would not buy their USA 
tires until after 1998.

&gt;I need to replace the tires on my 85 Westy.  I got a quote from Merchants
&gt;tire here in Springfield VA of $76.95 per tire (includes mount, balance,
&gt;stems, disposal) + tax. The tire is a 205/70R14, Perrelli P-400, load rang B
&gt;(1433lbs capacity) with an 80,000 tread warantee.
&gt;
&gt;Is this a good deal or should I keep shopping?  I called about 3 or 4 FLAPS
&gt;and no one could find 205/70R14s in load rang C or D. 
&gt;
&gt;Anyone in the DC metro area have any luck finding a good deal on tires?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
