Subject: '87 made it home (barely)


Talk about Halloween scres (and tricks!!!)

O.K., O.K., I know some of you said so, but I was too cheap to heed
the warnings, and the '87 Weekender did its trick during my commute
today (maybe it was its way of tellingme that I never got the
'blumenvasen' that the '87 has wanted for a long time now )
... The rubber hose from the driver side cylinder head to the
plastic tube that goes out to front began leaking coolant badly today.
Many of you had told me to replace that one when I replaced the
passenger side one :-( cheap, cheap, cheap (and dumb, dumb, dumb)...

anyway, I made the 60 mile commute back home limping along and filling
in coolant as it got low (I did get the temp indicator above 3/4 the
range once, for about 60 seconds, and it never really hit the top, I
hope there's no damage to the heads...)...

Now a related story, the OXS indicator came on in the middle of the
trip (118,000 miles on the '87 now).   Is this the same idiot  light
on all vehicles that turns on as you rack up enough miles, or is this
something I should remedy urgently?

Another horror:  The bolt that holds the top of the front edge of the
driver side intake manifold onto the cylinder head  is loose :-( !!!!
Does anyone have the torque sequence and the torque numbers to
these??? Is there any typical list of bolts that  like to &quot;go loose&quot;
at 110+ kMiles???


Thanks, and any help is appreciated...
