Subject:      FS: 63 Single cab pickup ... $5000!!! :(

speaking of dreamers! this one is in alabama, about 20 miles from
Tuscaloosa. it has 18,000 original miles on it, original engine and
transmission. seller is a junkyard/repair shop ... and has been reading
too many HOT VWs ads!  it really does look nice, though. oh, yeah: new brakes.

for anyone who is interested, it's at:

Mitchell Service Center    (205) 752-0962
Keith Mitchell, owner      (at about mile marker 69.5 on Highway US-82).
14980 Hwy 82 East
Duncanville, AL 35456

he also has a rather large junkyard of buses, beetles, and even about half
a dozen vanagons ... so whoever was looking for a headlight might find it
there. he does ok work, but will promise you anything and then is kinda
slow about getting around to it ... the problem is, he can't say NO to
anybody who drives up. so he starts working on one thing, then gets side-
tracked onto something else, then side-tracked again. etc.

but he does let you wander around in the junkyard.
