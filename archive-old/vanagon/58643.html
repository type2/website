Hello All!

Have lurked for the last week and have found this list to be
delightfully full of good ideas.

Here are some of my stats:
I took delivery of &quot;IO&quot; (one of Jupiter's moons) in March '86.
She turned 100,000mi last Wednesday (all but 13mi are mine).
All but engine (60k, failed head bolt #4), tires, brakes, battery,
windscreen, and H20 pump are original.
Has &quot;weekender package&quot;, i.e. rear seat folds into great bed.
Modified center seat layout, i.e. rotated 90 degrees to conform with
Colorado MV so that service-dog (Tuge) can ride directly behind me.
Outside of minor parking lot stuff, no rust and very solid.

Could write a book about the great travels we've had together.

Lon T. and all-around Travel-Dog, Tuge (short for tooo-huge)
Clifton, Colorado (Western high desert country)
