&gt; Has anybody heard that they are bringing back the Weekender in 98?? I
have
&gt; been getting mixed messages from &quot;salesmen&quot; and am ready to buy used but
&gt; would rather wait for new if it's really coming.

	I called VW America few weeks ago and a rep. told me he didn't know
anything about a EuroVan non-camper coming out.

	The Weekender configuration is a great compromise for folks that want a
poptop or big sunroof with curtains without
	the loss of space with the full camper config..
