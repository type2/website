Hi Derek,
     I stumbled on your site, and was wondering if you had any input on my
situation:  Until recently, I had been driving a '71 Bus every day for the
last 20 years (what kind of a person keeps a car that long?).  My two
requirements for a vehicle is that it hauls all my musical equipment around,
and will bring me home safely from my Baja, California expeditions (the
biggest obstacles being rocks, washboard, and deep sand).  The bus did a
generally heroic job with the only mod being the biggest tires that I could
get on the stock rims.  I took it places that it had no business being, and
it always brought me back, although with an occasionally high fear factor.
 Although far from perfect, I always had the impression that it could take
it, plus it was so simple that even an idiot like myself could fix it, or at
least figure out what was wrong.  (If something breaks down there while
off-road in a remote area, you are totally on your own.  I managed to have 3
flat tires on what is a relatively well travelled road, and waited 2 days for
a single vehicle to come by).  My idea of a perfect vehicle would be
something about the size of the bus, but with comfortable seats and 4WD.
 Imagine my delight when I heard about the Syncro!  I had heard nothing but
negative things about Vanagons, but I was swept up in the excitement of
finally getting a car that could do everything that I wanted, and be quiet,
comfortable, and actually have air conditioning!  To make a long story
longer, I bought a gorgeous brick red '87 Syncro with about 100k on it (my
bus had 350k, so I assumed that this one was just broken in).  There began my
horror story of endless mechanical nightmares, unbelievably expensive
Syncro-only parts, etc.  For all its faults, my bus never nickel-and-dimed
me, but this Syncro was beyond belief.  I bought the car for $6400, sank 2
grand into it without even trying, and finally gave up without even getting
to the leaking cylinder heads, the front wheel drivetrain, the failing
computer ignition,  the air compressor, and the non-working differential
lock.  I threw up my hands and was delighted to get rid of it for $5400.
 Here's the kicker, and why I'm writing to you:  I sold my bus and bought a
used Aerostar, which runs great and has every bell and whistle, but it's a
boring, lumbering mass, is a poor cargo vehicle, and will self-destruct if I
dare take it to Mexico.  I'm actually considering dumping it and trying
another Syncro.  To finally get to the point, in your opinion can these cars
take it?  (I noticed in the owners manual, it sez under no circumstances to
take these cars off the road.  It then tells you how to drive in sand).  Have
any of your readers tried these cars in Baja-type conditions?  (I'm not
talking about running the Baja 1000, just endless punishing washboard,
occasional arroyo crossing, and lots of sand).  Do all these cars have
similar problems?  (My mechanic seemed to think so, but there's so few of
them out there).  Will they always be high maintenance vehicles?  (I can only
afford one car--whatever I have is my daily driver).  Is the ground clearance
the same on the later ones?  (I seem to recall them lowering the clearance on
Vanagons in &quot;88 or so).  Are there years to avoid?  
     Sorry to rattle on---any input is greatly appreciated!  Enjoyed reading
your stuff, many thanks!
