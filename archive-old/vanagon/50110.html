Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon Exhaust parts ? 

I just scoured the whole country east to west to find the exact parts you
need. I live in NJ and I finally found them in Ontario. The place is called
Hayman Motors Ltd. . They will ship anywhere. Their Phone# is 416-636-6789
or use the fax # 416 636 7595 . THey went way beyond helpful I hope this helps.

&gt;I have an 82' Vanagon (2.0L, aircld, feul-inj), non-California exhaust
&gt;system, for which I am seeking new/used replacement parts. Would anyone
&gt;have any leads on persons or parts shops from whom I could get (trade,
&gt;purchase, etc.) these parts ?
&gt;
&gt;I need:
&gt;
&gt;1) EGR filter unit
&gt;
&gt;2) Cross-Over pipe
&gt;
&gt;or worse comes to worse, I'd consider purchasing the complete (no holes)
&gt;exhaust system (EGR, Cross-Over, Catalytic Converter, Muffler, etc.).
&gt;
