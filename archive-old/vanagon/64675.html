Subject:      Headin out to Burnin Man

Greetings all,
I am heading out the door to the Burning Man fest north of Reno.  Hope
the bus does well.  Should be interesting and hot.  Got the water and
all.  I will report on the trip next week, anyone going look for the
blue vanagon westy w/ list sticker.  See YA.  Ken.
