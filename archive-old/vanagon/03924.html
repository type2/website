Subject: awnings

I researched awnings and selected the A&amp;E Transawn 3000 in 10 foot length
with optional Vanagon rain gutter mounts. I can almost put this thing up and
down with one hand it is so easy and I would not change my purchase decision.


I also bought the optional screen room with safari panels for privacy for
this awning so I can make an extra room off the side of the camper--sort of
like a tent. I have never set up the screen room yet though.
