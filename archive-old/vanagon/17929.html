&gt; You want to know what the real cost of owning a EuroVan is....
&gt; 
{deleted trivia}
&gt; 
&gt; So as I figgure it Joel and Gerry owe me $21k for the price of admission
&gt; to this list, and Joel, and others owe me punitive damages in the amount
&gt; of $1,000,000 for the pain and suffering of having to read about
&gt; wannabusses, to deal with the Friday Follies...the late, lamented
&gt; Wil Self's ascii doodles...etc...
&gt; 
 Now that the subject has been brought up. My wife and each I feel we are 
entitled to $1,000,000 each for pain suffering and your EV punitive 
damages for duress caused from your posting to the mailing list.  We 
expect the van delivered immediately (just park it beside the blue one in 
our driveway).  We'll collect the money at some future date. [ :) ]
