&gt; &gt;If people are closed minded about this so much they should be driving M.B.
&gt; &gt;or Volvo's, both Hot V.W. and VW trends are sources of ideas, not laws on
&gt; &gt;HOW volkswagons are to be built
&gt;
&gt; First off, get it right it's spelled V-O-L-K-S-W-A-G-E-N.....not
&gt; volkswagon...
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, the only thing that Hot VWs and VW Trends (aka VW T&amp;A) are sources
&gt; for are advertising-slanted editorial content which is written at a 6th
&gt; grade level and is covered up with plenty of Tits and Ass shots of blonde,
&gt; big boobed bikini bimbos...basically these magazines are written for the
&gt; average 13 year old mastibatory motorhead.....obviously from your spelling,
&gt; punctuation and enfatuation with Hot VWs

Hi: You know, about the last thing we need on the list is a spelling
lesson but since the lessons appear to have begun I am going to need
help with &quot;mastibatory&quot; and &quot;enfatuation&quot;. I've never seen these words.
Could you possibly mean &quot;masturbatory&quot; and &quot;infatuation&quot;?
