Subject: potluck signup w. pretour


I thought about mailing this only to the 25 or so vehicles coming
to Pfeiffer Big Sur, but the client list keeps changing daily, so
will post it to the group for time being, and hope that those of
you to whom it does not pertain will feel free to hit delete.

For Friday night's fish chowder dinner potluck, I suggest the
the things below.

Each vehicle brings whatever they want in the way of beverages, hard,
medium or soft.  BYOB in other words, to keep things simple.

If anyone has any special diet, they bring their own things.

If you want something for yourself in addition to what's below, you bring
    it for your vehicle.

Each vehicle brings 1/4-1/3 lb. seafood or fish per person in their
     vehicle for additing to the community pot chowder, AND signs
     up for one of the following to contribute to the potluck.  You 
     could make this beforehand, or on the premises, depending on
     the item, and/or your mood, style, etc...


          Category                  No. of People Needed to Bring This
        ____________              ______________________________________

  Bread or Garlic Bread                              4

  Appetizers                                         4

  Salad                                              5

  Oyster crackers and cream for chowder              1

  Corn (cob, ok if frozen, we can bbq on fire)       3

  Potatoes, 20 pounds                                1

  Chopped vegetables for chowder                     3

  Desserts                                           3

May want to revise this when we see the final numbers of those attending,
but thought it might do for a start.

In the meantime, if you feel motivated to sign up for something above,
let me know, and I'll keep track.
