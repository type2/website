&gt; I've broken three Craftsman screwdrivers-- guess trying to lift an

&gt; They're OK in my book.

Mine too, though I keep them in the toolbox anyway 8^).  I've broken a few
craftsmans in my time, including two 1/2&quot; drive &quot;breaker bars&quot; (at least
that's what my dad and I always called them, though I forget the official
name) trying to remove splittie rear axle nuts with the proverbial &quot;cheater
pipe&quot; (the handle from my floor jack).  The second of these was brand new
when I broke it.  Still had the price sticker on it, and they STILL gave me
a new one (though I did get wise finally and bought a 3'4&quot; drive slide-bar
handle at the same time).

If &quot;Craftsman&quot; ain't in the Bible, it oughta be! 8^)
