Hi Philip,

is the air correction vavel running (above in the middel of the engine)
you can here it when you turn the ingnition on. (But it stops after 5-10
secs. when you dont start/crank the engine.) 
And is the relay of the fuel Pump and the fuel pump working ?
Check it before you buy an new ECU!
