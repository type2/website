&gt;My Syncro's average mpg is 19. I start looking for a station at 320
&gt;miles, and usually takes about 17 gals.

now i'm REALLY getting worried!!! if a syncro gets 19 and i get only 19.4 mpg
average! of course, now ... i do have a lot of 'junk' in my bus ... like
my tools, and all those 'emergency' supplies under the rear seat. :)  my bus
weighed out at 3640 lbs (full fuel, oil and coolant, tools, etc. but no
people or luggage) at the local truck stop ($5 for two weighings: one with
front and rear axles weighed separately, and one with both axles on the
same scale pad).

&gt;I have a question for other syncro owener's about topping off the
&gt;tank. When the pump kicks off there is about 5 gallons of air left in
&gt;the tank. I need to pull the nozzle out so that it is just in the hole

not having a syncro, i don't know for sure ... and you guys have a strange
filler neck (according to the pictures in bentley) ... but this sounds like
a vent line is pinched to me. but the shape of the tank might cause a lot
of foaming which would temporarily fill the filler neck and make the nozzle
think it had filled the tank.  i've heard of this in mercedes diesels.
