  OFFICE MEMO          Neat Vanagon Sighting                  Date:6/23/95

On tuesday I was walking to to grocery store and saw an interesting van in the
parking lot. It had a high fixed roof, like an upside boat on it. Sounds like
the descriptions of dave schwartz's boat, except this was a vanagon. I walked
up to take a close lookand it was an adventurewagon. I know someone on the
list has an 81 adventurewagon, but this is the first time I've seen one. Huge
high roof, foldout bed up above. no side cabinets, so the rear seat was full
width, but it had a cabinet behind each front seat, one was a
sink/refrigerator, and the other a stove. behind the back seat was a shelf
kind of thing covering the entire back cargo section that was even with the
top of the back seat with two handles on the top. something to do with the
foldout lower bed maybe? it was hard to tell. The outside and inside of this
van were immaculate, wolfsburg grey with the top being white. as I'm looking
at the outside i realize it's also a synchro. it must have been an '86 or '87,
judging from the chrome bumpers (last year 87 I think) and the square
headlights (first year 86 except joel's). 
    Whoever has the adventurewagon (matt?), do you have the deal behind the
back seat? how does it work.
    If you could live the extra height as a fixed item, this would be a
wonderful camper. I want one for christmas.
