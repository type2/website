Subject: Re: Thetford Porta Potti

Thanks to the many list members for their Thetford comments, advice,
sources and recommendations. I've just this minute ordered model #135
(smallest) from Camping World. As luck would have it, it was on sale for
20% off. 

Soon I'll be able to uncross my legs.
Larry
