Subject: Price on '74 Thing?

I'm sure there are some Thing owners around, could I get an
opinion on the value of this thing from you? It's a white convert.
well used but it's had some care. Engine runs but needs replaced,
I'd give the paint about a 98% being all there . Some rust, light
stuff that needs a wire brush and primer. I don't think the guy has 
a top. I've not yet done an inspection. I've seen it on the road and
talked to the guy on the phone. Like what kind of engine is in those
from factory?      Are these things Kewl?      TIA west
