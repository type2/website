Don't despair.  Just modify the allen wrench.  You need to cut off about 
3/4&quot; from the long end.  You then insert this allen wrench into the plug 
and turn the stub with a wrench.  When you're done just put the stub in 
the glove box and you have a fine tool for both changing the transmission 
oil as well as checking the transaxle oil level.
