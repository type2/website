&gt;Have been told and confirmed through experience that Vanagon lug nuts are
&gt;self tightening. After a while on the road you will need either an impact
&gt;wrench or a 3 ft torsion bar to get them off no matter if they were hand
&gt;tightened in the first place. DC

???? mine don't do that.  i think all lug nuts will tighten up a little bit,
IF they are put on close-to-specs in the first place. but not to the point
of impact-wrench required to remove.  mine have never required more than the
lug wrench to get off, even though when i put them on (around the house), i
use a torque wrench and set them at 123 ft-lbs (like the book says). what's
really funny is that the lug wrench sets them to almost exactly that torque,
if i pull down until it won't turn any more. kinda neat.
