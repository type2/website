I keep hearing about the 'heads' going on water-cooled 1.9 and 2.1 engines.
Is it inevitable?

My 84 GL has done 183,000 miles but a recon engine was put in 75,000 miles
ago in 1991 (probably due to the head thing:-).
Does this head thing re-occur regularly or is a once only fix?

Is there any preventative maintenance to stop one getting nervous and
always looking at the temp gauge?
