&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 	My sliding side windows are making all sorts of horrible noises
&gt; now that the tiny bits of plastic that these things ride on have fallen by
&gt; the side of the road.  I went into the dealer and started to describe the
&gt; tiny bit of plastic and the parts guy said that when VoA discontinued that
&gt; part, he bought as many as they would let him.  Unfortunately, he ran out
&gt; of these things last year.  Does anyone know of a supply house that has
&gt; these darn things?  I'm using popsicle sticks right now to keep the
&gt; windows from rattling so much.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Alan Laird

You may try West Coast Metric Inc.  They specialize in rubber and plastic
products for VWs and have recently introduced a water cooled catalog.  I
have the catalog at home but can't remember if they have that part.  Here
is their number for technical info:  310-325-0005.
