Subject: Re: MORE 'you MAY be a devoted VW bus owner if:'

And a few more:

- your kids idea of an outing is to go to the VW repair shop to check out
the different VW's.
- you tell the wife you met someone and she asks about what type of VW
he/she has.
- the wife says she's going out and asks you if you need something for the VW.
- the repair shop owner calls you when a &quot;for parts&quot; bus arrives.
- your computer desk lamp is actually a bus interior light.
- you install a bus rear view mirror in your computer desk to see who's
behind you.
- you have more VW manuals on your desk than computer reference manuals.
- 'checking the plumbing' means in your Westfalia, not the house.
- reading the bible really means Bentley.
- you have to get your kids out of school early or you'll miss on that
vintage part for sale.
- on your birthday, you receive gift certificates to be redeemed at your
favorite VW parts store.
- your friends say:&quot;how's the Bus&quot; instead of asking about the family.
- your kids are argueing and you are called to settle the color and year of
the chassis number.
- parking at your favorite fast food place and eating in the Westfalia is
referred to as a picnic.
- all the members of your family carry a pad and pencil to write down the
address of the &quot;for sale&quot; bus on the road.
- your family members and friends are always in the lookout for vintage parts.
- 99% of your long distance calls are to people selling vintage parts.
