Subject: Should I Buy this Synchro?
Date: Mon, 3 Apr 95 11:42:24 EDT

First of all I am sorry to rehash this as it was dealt with
a week ago about an '89 but I have a few interesting mitigating
circumstances and seek the net wisdom.

My Dad is in the market for a replacement for his current 150,000
mile Caravan which he bought after 5 VW vans as he was pissed off
at our local dealer, well he was considering a friends '93 MV which
the guy still owes $19k and would part with for $17k, clean low miles
but I thought this was a ludicrous amount of money for a vehicle and
have been looking for alternatives for him, enter a nice maroon '87
Synchro I saw in a parking lot this weekend, went up to the guy and
asked if interested in selling, he was for the right price, van has
front ground effects (first year right?), rear heater, A/C, new tires,
5 alloys, power mirrors, rear diff lock, pretty much standard stuff for that
year.  Body is very nice, one rust spot on seam behind drivers front
wheel weel, pretty common, our '86 was going there as well.  The guy
has owned 2.5 years and each spring climbs under and paints scrapes, etc
with cold galvanizing compound then reundercoats, looked real good.
He is 2nd owner, all dealer service records since new, 65,000 miles.
The kicker is this, brand new 2.1 Wasserboxer, dealer installed, with
new clutch etc and new front exhaust manifold at the same time, with
labor bill for $3500 last fall (ouch).  The guy said will sell $8000
firm, but I figure on closer inspection, we can dicker.  This seems very
reasonable to me, my questions are:
1. what do you think on price.
2. what to look for, I owned a Quantum Synchro and know the importance
of checking all the cv's and driveline, exhaust inpection and front
brakes are a given, anything else, I realize this mileage is where a lot
of stuff can start going bad, plus the age factor, when will the shocks
need done, how much on those, $50 each for regular van last I looked,
does Sachs make a sporting set for the Synchro?, will the springs need
replaced as well at 100k or so, how much $$?
3. the synchro system, how to check? I will check fluid levels but
anything special, that special silicone viscous coupling fluid that VW
says is good for life, could should it be replaced?  This thing is
nearly 10 years old now but if dad can get 4 or 5 trouble free years he
would be more than pleased at the savings over the Eurovan.  I figure he
can buy and maintain the Synchro for what he would lose in depreciation
in 5 years on the Eurovan, but if that tranny ever goes. A friend
has a hydraulic lift so I can blow as much time as I want inspecting and
could even run it in the air looking and listening to driveline parts.
Any advice would be appreciated, feel free to email me direct if you
don't want to bother the list.

Thanks,
John Anderson
