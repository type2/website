Subject: Cruise Control - Diesel

I had an after market cruise control on my van for a few years. (Why
would a diesel need a cruise control? - getting a brick off the gas
padal in a hurry is a pain.)  We literally burned it up in the desert
when the temperature was at least 120 F (top of the range of my outside
temperature indicator).  I went to the original local supplier but they
only have vacuum operated units now.  There is not a lot of vacuum in a
diesel (none) and I need an electric servo model.

Does any one out there know where I can get a cruise control for a
diesel?  I am not worried about the length of cables or speed pickup
system, that can be adapted.

Thanks

Diesel John
