Subject: luggage rack / sunroof??


_______________________________________________________________________________
Someone inquired as to the nature of my rooftop storage.  My 76 (and most 
68-80 ???) have a psudeo-lugage rack on the roof above the driver and 
passenger seats.  Actually, it is a slight (about 3-4 inches) depression 
in the turtle shell.  Also, it is level, unlike the rest of the shell.

   Can anyone say if that luggage rack depression can be cut out
   by mere mortals and successfully have a sunroof of some kind
   grafted on there?? Even an extra 1.5&quot; of headroom would be
   welcome! And a little breeze in the summer from above would
   be heaven!
