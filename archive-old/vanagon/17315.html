Subject: Re: Vanagon with Porsche power.



A fellow here in Victoria who did the Porsche thing with his passenger
syncro, (3.2 liter, is that right?), constructed a system so that
the hot air from the Porsche heat exchangers would pass through a
radiator/heat exchanger that was connected to the stock heating system. I
guess he also added some kind of recirc pump.
