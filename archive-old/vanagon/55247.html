Subject: RE: storing CV boots 

Be careful if you use silicone.  There are several different types and contain petroleum 
components that will break down rubber.

Scuba diving shops carry special silicone sprays used just for preserving rubber items.  You 
might want to try there.

&gt;I have some CV boots (already mounted to axles with CV joints) that I won't

&gt;the rubber on the boots? Talc? Silicone lubricant? Vaseline? I plan to seal
&gt;them as best I can in an airtight wrapping. Any problem storing them
&gt;outside in a tool shed where temperatures will vary (but not that much,
&gt;this is Seattle).
