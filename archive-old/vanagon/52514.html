Subject: my trip report


I tried to post a copy of my European trip report to the air
and water bus/van mailinb lists, but I suspect there may
have been some problem with it going thru, as it is quite
large (about 12 pages).  If anyone wants a copy and didn't
get theirs, please e-mail me privately, and I'll be happy
to shoot you the text.

 Current lust list: faucet top for my '81 westy, driver's side front bumper
  end cap for same, a moped, a propane-powered catalyic heater for camping,
   anything having to do with antique woodstoves (especially ornate ones)
    european-masonry heaters or kachelofen, black currants, DC/12v blender
     and/or coffee-grinder, a Eurovan TDI (transporter), and lastly:  a pair
      of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates (the kind which clamp onto
       the outside of your shoes and are height- and width-adjustable.  I
        also need the key.  :)  These were very popular in the 60s, and made
         by Winchester, although any brand would do.  They have a leather
          strap which fastens around the ankle.
