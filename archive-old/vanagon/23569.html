&gt; BUT how much of the force needed to turn the alternator is mechanical and 
&gt; how much 'electrical'.

The mechanical drag is negligable.  For fun, you can take an alternator,
spin it, then quickly apply current to the field and ground the output.
The pulley will go from merrily coasting along to a dead stop in a
fraction of a second.  I always thought that was kinda cool.

&gt; Bob's original point was that the alternator wouldn't charge the battery 
&gt; and power all the super spot lights.  That is not disputed is it?

Ummm... I forgot what the original point was a long time ago.  :)

&gt; At lower engine revs the turning of the alternator isn't enough to power 
&gt; all added equipment.  Suspect that the speed of the engine affects what 
&gt; percentage of the energy consumed by the alternator is elctrical and what 
&gt; is mechanical.

I estimate the mechanical load the alternator places on the engine (i.e.
friction in the bearings and inertia during acceleration/deceleration),
to be around 1/127th of a horsepower, on average.  :)
