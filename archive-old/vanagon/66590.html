With a 5w50 oil, the base stock is 5W with modifiers to make it act like its up to 50W
at higher temperatures.

The problem is, these modifiers break down over time, even in as little as 2,500 mi.
Once this happens, you basically have base stock oil, in this case 5w, which is too
thin for pre-1990 engines.

&gt;I'm no brain surgeon ;-),  but I would think that a 5-50 oil would give you
&gt;the best of both worlds.  Thin  viscosity when it is cold and thick when
&gt;it's hot.   Maybe I'm missing something!!
