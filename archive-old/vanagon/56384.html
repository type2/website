	Has anyone had any experience using these in a camping situation?  Do
they hold up well, or will they develop stress fractures and drop an
unsuspecting sleeper into the engine compartment?  I have a chance to
buy one...I think it's blue and from an early 80's Vanagon that sits at
a friend's garage.  The lid is apparently almost new, but has a small
crack at the lip.
