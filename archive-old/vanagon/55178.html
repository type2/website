&gt;&gt;Additional lights are available for an extended lower grille. Two different
&gt;&gt;sets are available: Dou retangular foglights or beams, quad retangular
&gt;&gt;for foglights and beams.
&gt;
&gt;This is a new one for me.  How much are those, and who sells them?  I have

Zender makes the foglamp kit that is integrated into the turn signal lens assy.
Some cutting of sheetmetal is required. Coyote (Lussier) has a pair of these on
his Westy.
