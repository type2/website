&gt;Hi! my name is stoney, i've been in the gasket biz for years. well sents 
&gt;1975. I started at nashville rubber &amp; gasket co inc.
&gt;right now i have been told that i have M.S. and I can't do the same kind 
&gt;of work that I did. But seeing how I was going through the internet it 
&gt;would not hurt to see if there was any thing i could do out here in space
&gt;maybe give advise?  
&gt;

Dear Stoney, 

I'm sorry to hear about the M.S.

I've a hunch your internet search turned up one of my articles about making
gaskets or something like that.  The articles, about a hundred of them on
several subjects, were sent to the subscribers of a mailing list devoted to
owners of Volkswagen vans called the Vanagon List, a misnomer since other van
owners are tolerated as are people who don't even drive -- anyone having an
interest in Volkswagen vans is welcome.  Mr. Richard Kurtz, one of the list
members, was kind enough to collect the articles and maintain them in an
archive accessible to the internet, which I assume is how you came by my
address. 

Many list subscribers do their own repairs needing an occasional gasket,
hence the article.  But as the article made clear, I'm not a gasket expert.
 Your more than twenty years experience in that area would be invaluable to
someone who has never made a gasket and certainly useful even to someone like
me who has made too many of them, if you know what I mean.

Most folks don't realize they'd be afoot if it weren't for gaskets.  Or to
put that another way, a lot of people end up walking because they don't know
enough about gaskets.  I think you could help us all in that area if you're
willing.  And I can promise you exactly the same rate of pay I get for my
articles... :-)  

The only thing we ever truly own is what we know and there is quiet
satisfaction in seeing that knowledge safely passed into younger hands.

-Bob
