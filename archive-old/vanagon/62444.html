Subject: Still running rich, still failing inspection

Failed inspection again today.  And it ran so clean last year!  I had
been running with the 02 sensor disconnected after that failed, so I
replaced that, twice.  Adjusted the idle switch on the throttle, so that
is working correctly now.  Found the timing was running too advanced! 
Didn't occur to me, cause I've been so pleased with the top end of 83
mph!  Now I know why!  But I had the idle screw all the way out and it
would still stall when I turned on the AC.  May have hurt my top end,
but may be imagining it too.

So, with high hopes I head off to get a probe rammed up my tailpipe.  I
even added a can of that gas additive that guarentees a pass the last
time I filled up.   All for nothing!  Runs 5-6% CO.  Dang, I said and
reached in a disconnected the 02 sensor (always suspect the 02 sensor). 
NO change.  Hmm... I know it's hooked up correctly...

Any ideas?
