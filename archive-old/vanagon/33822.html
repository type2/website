Subject: I give up on electrical.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions...but, alas I am stumped.

I've tapped into the fuse box and ran a wire to a good switch and then 
back to the coil.  This provides me with juice to the coil for starting.
It also, when turned off, is a kill switch.  

Hopefully, later on I'll figure it out but for now this will do.

Martin
