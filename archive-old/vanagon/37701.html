Subject: RE: Weekend Plans/No Poopie


&gt;So help me if I ever find out any of you are the kind of losers that
&gt;throw their lit cigarette butts out the window while driving on the
&gt;highway, so help me...  I've been hit one too many times by flying
&gt;cigarette butts sparking their way across my hood.

Ditto, mostly, but for a very different reason. I'm not too concerned
about cigarettes bouncing across my hood, partly because the V6anagon
doesn't have one, and partly because they have much less effect than
the gravel etc. kicked up in the normal course of driving.

But one of the big 1994(?) California fires, in Laguna Hills, came about
a mile from my house while torching several thousand acres and putting
many people at grave risk. The flames at night were pretty, but I wasn't
in the mood.

Fire investigators narrowed down the possible starting areas to one: by
the side of a scenic road from an inland area toward Laguna Beach. It
was right next to the pavement-- police had it barricaded off for two
weeks after the fire. No proof that it was a cigarette thrown from a car,
but it's right up there near the top of the list of possibilities...

Earlier I suggested a dash placard for automatic Audis reading &quot;Don't Be
Stupid&quot;. This would have been a better place... but then, we'd need 
thousands
of them, by every dry road. And do we *really* need them...???
