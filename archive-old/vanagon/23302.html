Subject: bye for now


I am leaving IBM tomorrow for a new job with a company known as BATS
(http://www.bats_dot_com/bats). I do not have a new account anywhere yet,
will be looking into Netcom or somesuch setup. Will re-signon as soon
as possible (not that I do much but lurk :).

I shall see a few of ya this weekend - my golden retreiver will be
coming with me, so if there are any other dog owners going...

Oh yeah, could someone please send me the directions for signing off?
I seem to have lost mine.
