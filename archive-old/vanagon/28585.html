&gt;VW Canada is also planning a major hike to EV prices
&gt;with the V6.  My dealer estimates CDN$ 10,000 - $15,000 (!).
&gt;The dealers are dismayed (to understate).
&gt;

This is certainly higher by US$: 7000 - 10000 !
Just for a bloody engine improvement?

&gt;As for the current EV, MSRP is $39,256 (5-speed) and $40,306
&gt;(auto).  Furnace is compulsory option ;-{
&gt;Additional becnh is $670
&gt;

These sound pretty much the same as VW USA prices, but thats not a big
surprise. But wait, are these Westfalias or EuroBagos?

&gt;Adding Freight and PDI, air conditioning tax, gas guzzler
&gt;tax, and 15% (!) sales taxes (Ontario), the manual will run
&gt;$46,500.
&gt;

What does it take to qualify as a gas-guzzler there?
And I didn't think it had flourocarbon air conditioning - or does everyone
in Canada have to pay for past transgressions?
