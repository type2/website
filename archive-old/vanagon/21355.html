&gt;
&gt; Thats my question-
&gt; &quot;whats a weltmeister?&quot; Once I know, my life will be complete.
&gt;
&gt; Its on a sticker I have &quot;Die Marke der weltmeister&quot; or something
&gt; like that.
&gt;
&gt; also, this 0lga spam is amazing.&gt;

    &quot;WELTMEISTER&quot; means &quot;world champion&quot;, and &quot;Die Marke der Weltmeister&quot;
means &quot;The brand of world champions&quot;.
    also, (am i and my bus gonna get blacklisted for this ???): i really
don't mind the occasional OLGA-mail, in fact, i find it kind of cool. anyone
who doesn't wanna read it still has his DELETE button, rite ??
