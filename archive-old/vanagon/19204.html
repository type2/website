Stuart,

Yes, I had a similar problem and would recommend my solution for yours.  I
had a crack in the drain plug seat, with a slow leak.  Next time I had the
engine out, I had a machine shop weld the drain hole shut, weld a boss
around the drain plug hole, machine its face flat, and tap new threads for
a valve-type oil drain.  It cost $60 labor.  The valve-type oil drain
(about $15) is an aftermarket piece for VW rabbits and other w/c vw.  I
chose it so I could use the std. rabbit one (which I already have) as a
spare in case the valve ever fails.  Its size isn't really the best as a
Vanagon diesel replacement, and that cost me a bit extra for the welding
and machining.  A better idea would be to have your machine shop choose
the drain valve.  Fumoto Engineering of America, Bellvue, WA, supplied my
drain valve.
