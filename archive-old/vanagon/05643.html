Subject: emissions equip for 73 Bus

I need some info on what emmissions equipment my 73 Bus needs to become a 
legal CA resident (it is visiting from NC).  It seems to have nothing beyond 
exhaust pipes, and has a single Weber-style carb.  I also have a 74 914 
engine that does have an EGR valve, but also has some sort of Weber-style 
single carb.  The people at the two smog places I took it to were basically 
appalled, and told me to junk it.  The bus is in pretty good shape and I'd 
rather drive it around some more or sell it, rather than send it to the 
scrap heap.  Anybody know what I need to put back, or where I can take it to 
get it smogged, or any other course of action?
