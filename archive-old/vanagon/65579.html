&gt; Does anyone have the secret to getting those grey plastic screw covers off
&gt; of the Westy interior screws without mascerating them in the process?

Use a very small, flat-bladed screwdriver and carefully lift the
screwcover up without &quot;rocking&quot; the screwdriver.  If you damage the
covers, they are available at your local Eagle Hardware store.
