I have some suggestions for the Wailaki trip, though I can't go.  

The USAL road goes up the coastal ridge from where route one cuts inland,
about thirty miles south of Bear Harbor.  For the Synchros and dirt road
minded, this could be a fun trip.  Watch out for logging trucks.  There is
also a road from Four Corners, where the Whitethorn road meets the USAL
road, that drops off the ridge to Bear Harbor.  It is another dirt road
experience, dropping about 1000 feet in a couple miles down to an beautiful
old farm on a flat by the ocean, the last flat before the cliffs, day use
only.  Did this on bicycles years ago, before there were mountain bikes.  I
suppose checking with locals before you try these roads might be wise, it's
been several years since I was there.  Shelter Cove is a local swimming
favorite I believe.
