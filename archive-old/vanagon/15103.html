&gt;   &gt;&gt;Good point, Sami. I'm leaning towards a GEX rebuilt long block. At
&gt;   &gt;&gt;$300 for heads plus another $300 for pistons/cylinders plus another
&gt;   &gt;&gt;$100 for bearings and gaskets I'm most of the way to the cost of the

&gt;   As far as I am concerned, GEX is worth the money. I bought my '80 Vanagon with
&gt;   a blown engine (Connecting rod had come through the case). Once I tore it
&gt;   down, I found that one head had a cracked seat. When I priced the parts out, I
&gt;   could buy a GEX engine for about $200 more than the parts alone. I bought it,
&gt;   installed it, and it ran almost perfect. One hydraulic lifter refused to pump
&gt;   up. GEX FEDEXed me a lifter, and offered to pay for a shop or a VW dealer to
&gt;   install it! Once I put in the lifter, it was perfect. Many happy miles
&gt;   followed.

Just my $.02.  I bought a 1600DP longblock from GEX back in 1985.  It has 
been in three different vehicles and I've never had a bit of trouble with 
it.  It currently has about 75,000 miles on it.
