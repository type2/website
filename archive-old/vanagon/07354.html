&gt;In the premiere issue of Funkengroovin they list a VANAGON mailing list on the
&gt;internet as:
&gt;vanagon-list%cherise_at_vb3ffv.ampr_dot_org
&gt;Is this a different list from vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu?

yup. i thought it was kinda dead. the story goes: waaaaaaaaaaaay back when,
a fellow named Bob Parkinson started up a list on his company machine, but
before it got very big (only about 30 of us), they started some hardware
upgrades for some big project.  well, it lingered on and on with no list,
so Gerry got prodded/cajoled/seduced into starting up this one. and you
know, it must be true about bullshit being good fertilizer, cause this little
list has grown like crazy. :)   i think it got started back in February or
March of this year.

history lesson #4.
