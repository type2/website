Subject: RE: misc.


&gt;Today I found and fixed a vacuum leak that has been vexing me.  It seems
&gt;the leak was in the vacuum brake booster line, in the engine
&gt;compartment.  I wiggled it, and it promptly came loose from where it
&gt;plugs into the intake air distributor.  Hmmm, so that might explain the
&gt;varying degrees of brake boost I had been experiencing :) .  Anyway, got
&gt;hose clamps at the FLAPS and clamped that part down good and no more
&gt;hisssssssssssss :) .  Yeah!

I found the same sort of thing on my '71 bus-- not only was the hose
messed up, but the little check valve had a hole in it too. Replaced
the valve and that section of hose, and things fot a little better, but
still had idle problems. Finally replaced all 3 sections of hose from
the manifold to the brake booster servo (also replaced the master
cylinder, which leaked), and the idle *finally* settled down to where
it should be.

Moral of the story: If I were you, I'd replace all sections of the power-
brake vacuum hose. The stuff's cheap (I used 1/2&quot; wire-reinforced
heater hose from Napa, you can drive a tank over it), you're in there
anyway, and if one section of hose is rotted, the others may not be far
behind.
