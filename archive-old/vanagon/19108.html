Subject: Homemade head temp gauge?

Volks,

Can someone point me to the FTP or FAQ on how to make a cylinder head temp
gauge from little thermo chips?  I thought I saved it but I can't find it now.

Eug,

Hey- the bus is running pretty well, 65 mph _at_ 11% throttle, 70 mph _at_ 17%
throttle, all at about 190 degrees oil temp pre cooler, and 135 degrees post
cooler.  The platinum plugs have made all the difference.  I actually revved
it to 5000 rpm for the first time.  It had plenty left and I think it'll go
well past 6000 if I hammered it.
