Subject: Re: Vanagon spoiler

&gt;&gt;  Hello volks, and the usual to the point. My question is about Vanagon
front
&gt;&gt; spoilers. Will a spoiler from later Vanagon fit an 82 model? Would major
&gt;&gt; modifications need to be made to install the part? Thanks!

&gt;Perhaps I'm thinkin' of somthing vastly different than what you're 
&gt;calling a spoiler... 
&gt;But does your vanagon really have good enough aerodynamics and go fast 
&gt;enough to cause lift?

Although I don't know if a later model spoiler will fit, I do know that some
sort of spoiler/air dam will have a positive effect on the handling of the
vehicle (less lift under the front end).  Yes, it does increase frontal area
a bit, but the handling improvements at speed are worth it.  Just think of a
stock-based racing car.  Flared fenders, deep air dam, monster spoiler on the
back, etc.  Sure it adds a bit of drag, but the benefits outweigh the
downside.

  The only problem I found was the lack of ground clearance.  My '84 was
lowered a bit, running on 185/70R14 (instead of 185R14) tires and had an
aftermarket spoiler on the front end.  I loaned the vehicle to my mother for
a 300 mile trip, and on the first driveway she encountered she managed to rip
the spoiler clean off of the car, and this was less than 10 minutes after she
left.  Great.

Ryan
