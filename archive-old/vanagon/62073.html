Subject: DIGEST mode - reply

Hi all,

I use DIGEST mode. I get one or two big emails each day, sometimes one big
digest is further split into two chunks. All messages since the last digest
are included. The one I'm replying to (a fairly small one) has 24 mails. 

You get a table of contents at the front and some mailers can split the
digest back out to individual mails. 

Advantage - it keeps all related mails together, handy if you're on more
than one list or get a lot of other mail. Often you get question and several
answers in the one hit, saves you replying unnecessarily or allows to to
fill in the gaps in the replies. It makes list traffic MUCH more manageable. 

Drawbacks - not as immediate (but that isn't necessarily a problem). Big
mails may not be to your liking. Not quite as easy to follow up (but not
_that_ hard, hey). 

I like the digest better. YMMV.

Regards,
