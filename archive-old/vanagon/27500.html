Subject: A way to keep your early bus warm
Date: Wed, 25 Oct 1995 17:08:10 -0700 (PDT)


Now that I have your attention...

Yesterday I installed a neat device in my bus for keeping it warmer,
and my tests on the way to work this AM proved it good.

I made a canvas &quot;divider,&quot; kinda like the panels had, that goes across
the back seat.  I chose canvas 'cause it'd be durable, but I could also
wad it up and throw it under the seat.

I use tonneau cover type fasteners to hold it on, just snaps right up.

It seems that I have some drafts thru the edges of the sunroof,  which
makes for an interesting air movement pattern in the bus, which you can really 
tell with this thing installed.  There's a lot of air trying to move 
forward into the cab at freeway speeds.  Stopping that air flow lets me
warm the bus up MUCH better!

If anyone wants more details, let me know.
