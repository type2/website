Ooooohhh, my favorite subject - ways to be obnoxious!   I long ago decided
that since I drive 'just' a VW Bus, which as every other driver on the road
knows is a vehicle to be completely ignored, punted off to the boonies if
necessary when going uphill, etc etc,  (we really +don't+ get no respect) -
anyhow if they're going to take me for granted, I can at least get their
attention when I want on my terms..... I have, at the moment, a total of 4
(yep, four) horns.  #8 teflon coated stranded wire, 30 amp fuse directly off
the battery, 2X20 amp relays in parallel, works off the stock horn circuit.
The horns (purchased from, appropriately, JC Wimpy) are:  2X130 db units,
their 'foghorn/ocean liner' unit, plus one other combined 'woofer tweeter'
long trumpet unit.  They're all mounted under both sides of the bus (never
can be sure where the attack might come from).  Hey - I really, genuinely
hate being obnoxious, or being a source of someone elses' fear, but maybe
2-3 times a year I use 'em to keep from being someone's hood ornament  (it's
really amazing that there are blind spots big enough to mask a VW bus - but
I'll bet 18 wheelers have the same problem from time to time)
