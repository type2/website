yum yum yum

my favorite recipe is foamy engine brite, let it soak, and take it to the car
wash and blast it with the high pressure hose.   Wow, the toxic goo just goes
AWAY!

I do this before pulling a motor,  unless its already clean.

ive also been seen putting  engine parts, after an initial wash,  in a big
pot of water on the stove, seasoning with  Arm &amp; Hammer laundry soap,  and
simmering for a couple hours.  doesnt dissolve aluminium or my fingers,  got
those pcs and cs etc very clean
