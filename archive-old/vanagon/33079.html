Subject: 71:Flat Spot:CB Interference--Making Progress

I replaced the 009 this evening with a vacuum-advanced distributor (a 
loaner) to find that part of the flat spot went away. I plugged the 
vacuum line from the brake booster and found that a little more went 
away. The amazing thing to me is that the interference with the CB seems 
to have completely vanished.

Now I noticed (after a little mental jog from Bob Hoover) that the 009 
had some slickness inside (oil; but not much). I wonder if that could 
have created a little &quot;track&quot; for the spark to find it's way into the 
heart of the bus...that is, into ground, creating the interference and 
impeding the performance of the 009?

Gotta go. Major thunderstorm approaching. Don't want my fingers to start 
feeling like the inside of an oil-slick 009. Thanks! 8) Joe
