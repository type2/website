Subject: Tornado-like wind currents


Howzit Volks Fans!

I had a rather amusing drive to work this morning.
My bench seat bed was laid out in  the back from
the weekend, and I had the Sun Dial roof door open.
There was a plastic bag with about a dozen light weight
finishing washers laying in the back next to the rear
door.

As I got up to speed on the freeway the vibrant blue bag
began a gorgeous wind dance. It seems that with the roof door
open, the swirls rather rapidly in the rear, creating
a tornado effect.  Anyways, the BlueBag was spinning, dipping,
diving, lurching everywhere in the rear, without ever touching
any side walls, floor, or ceiling.  Oh what a joy I was
having.  Who cares about watching the road (at 58mph who needs to),
I couldn't get enough of my dancing friend.

Well, all good things must come to an end, so on one of the BlueBag's
somersaults, the washers delightfully tinkled out and the BlueBag
lurched immediately into the cab and right into my lap.

I guess it got tired.
