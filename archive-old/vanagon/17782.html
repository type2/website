I think it's great for the heavy drizzle we get here in the PNW. You can
generally run with your wipers off and enjoy excellent visibility.

It's kind of weird in real heavy rain. You wind up with a lot of water
sloshing around on your windshield.

I've found that applying 2-3 coats - letting it dry between each -
significantly enhances longevity.
