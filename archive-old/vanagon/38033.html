Subject: Wiper motor drive shaft T2

Howdy,
I need to replace the driveshaft on my wiper motor assembly. This is 
 the big white gear with the shaft in the center that goes out of  the 
 gear box to the wiper arm mechanism. The nylon gear has cracked where 
 the shaft is embedded in the center, does somebody make a replacement 
 or must I epoxy this and pray. I really don't want to shell out $150 
 for a new wiper motor.

TIA 
Clay
