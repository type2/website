Subject: Introduction

Hello fellow Vanagonites ( or Vanagonians?),

I've been poking around this list since last Thursday and think I've figured
a few things out.  Like, it's polite to introduce yourself.  So here goes:

My name is Jim Davis and I'm from Southern California where I've lived since
birth some 35 years ago.  I work as a Project Manager providing automated
control systems for process industries (like food processing, oil refining,
power plants &amp; stuff).  I have one wife, Yvonne, and two kids, Matthew-7, and
Laura-4.  

Now for the important VW stuff:
I currently drive an 87 Vanagon GL Syncro (140k miles) and my wife drives the
88 Vanagon GL Wolfsburg Edition (99.6K miles).  My VW thread winds back from
now through an 86 Jetta GLI, an 82 Rabbit Pickup - diesel, an 84 Rabbit GTI,
a 71 Audi (sort of VW) 100LS and began with a 62 Baja Bug in 1975.  My
brother &amp; I cut the back of the roof off and made it into a pickup kinda
thing.  We called it the TRUG (1/2 TRuck and 1/2 bUG).  Back to the present,
I enjoy 4x4 trails in the local mountains &amp; deserts in the Syncro.  I really
like the looks on the other 4-wheelers faces when they see a Vanagon where
they think it shouldn't (or couldn't) be!

I'm also trying to locate a pair of reasonably priced rear-facing Vanagon
seats.  You know, the ones that sit behind the driver and front passenger,
fold up theater-seat style, and came in 87 &amp; newer Wolfsburg models, Carats,
and Multivans.  I'd like to buy a complete pair with brackets, seat belts,
etc. so that I can install them in my 87 Syncro. Please let me know if you
want to get rid of yours or know the whereabouts of  any that are for sale.

Lastly, we need a name for Vanagon enthusiasts.  People without a bus have a
name (Wanabus) so people with a van should certainly have a name.  By the
way, I was kidding with Vanagonite and Vanagonian above.  I'd love to hear
whatever suggestions the list has to offer.

I'll be wavin' to ya,
Jim Davis
