Subject: poptop seal frustration




subtitle - why the Canadian economy is stagnating.

Today being saturday, I nipped out to do a bit of vanagon related 
shopping and found some great poptop seal material. It is a u-channel 
with a foam rubber wall tube attached at right angles, very much like the 
west coast metric model. What makes this seal special is it is made of a 
very durable looking rubber, even the channel portion (which on the 
westcoast metric model is vinyl). The channel also has a bead of sticky 
sealent pre-installed deep in the recess. It costs Can$2.95/foot, wqhich 
works out to about 50-70 bucks cheaper than the aforementioned WCM stuff. 
Delighted, I bought 2 ft to check out and it fitted wonderfully, the tube 
portion making a better looking top-to-roof seal than the original. Went 
back to the rv store to discover that they only had 12 ft left (I needed 
25). They also told me that the stuff was made by Winnebago. I tried 
other stores, no luck, couldn't find a suitable substitute. Phoned the 
original store to ask if they would order some. They said sure but I 
would have to pay 100% up front. What!!! I talked to the salesperson for 
a while but they wouldn't budge, claiming &quot;company policy on special 
orders from Winnebago&quot;!! 
Going to talk to the manager on Monday, and try other Winne dealers in 
the area.

But those of you out there needing a new seal oughta try the local 
Winnebago RV dealership...
