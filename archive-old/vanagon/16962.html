regarding the vanagon FTP server, im on a dos machine and when i try FTP'ing 
all the stuff there, it will cut off the letters past 8 characters to make a 
file on my machine, and after trying to download vanagon.95.01-05, i end up 
with only the last one, the others are overwritten because it writes all of 
them as vanagon.95 and then downloads the next one and overwrites the 
previous...., maybe there is some way to make the names unique within the 
first 8 characters, without going through too much trouble?  thanks alot.
