Subject: Hitch survey for '68 - '71 bus


May as well jump on this bandwagon, since I need a hitch for
my '71 bus.

Anyone know of a kit for such a hitch for a 68-71 era bus?
Class 1 is fine, and if I can bolt it on myslf, that's even
better, tho not mandatory.

I've seen some (really old) that reach forward (FIF) under the
engine and bolt to something way up in there; and I've seen
some that just bolt to the two rear bumper brackets.

Either type is fine...

Thanks in advance!
