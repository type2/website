Subject: Re: black smoke when starting

     
     
     &gt; The 75 Bus makes a big puff of black smoke (almost?) every time I start 
     &gt; it. The smoke dissipates after a few seconds and then things seem fine. 
     &gt; Could it be worn rings? Can I afford to ignore the problem?
     &gt;
     
     I always thought that black smoke meant petrol, but if it is oil and 
     it doesn't get any worse then at least you have some oil in your 
     cylinders when it turns over first time in a morning - which under
     most cold start situations, has to be a bit better.
