Subject: Hard to Start When Cold

I don't know about the &quot;strange noises&quot;, but your problems are most likely with 
your cold start injector, or the wire or fuel line running to it. Looking at 
your motor from the top, its right about in the middle. This valve provides 
extra fuel only when the motor is cold. While your at it, check also that all 
the air hoses are hooked up and not cracked.

Good Luck, 
Erik

&gt; THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WRITING TO THE `LIST'  I HAVE A 79 BUS(2L FI)
&gt; WITH 193,000 MILES UNDER MY BELT.  IT HAS A RECENT BOSCH TUNE-UP, 
&gt; A GOOD BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR, AND THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS CHECKED TO BE 
&gt; GOOD.  MY QUESTION IS WHY IT HAS STARTING TROUBLES.  IT STARTS RIGHT
&gt; UP, BUT IT MAKES SOME REAL STRANGE NOISES AND THEN KICKS OVER.
&gt; IT ONLY DOES THIS IN THE MORNING WHEN THE BEAST IS COLD.  IT RUNS
&gt; SO SMOOTHLY THOUGH THAT I WANT TO DRIVE IT 24/7.  ANY IDEAS, EVEN THOUGH
&gt; THE SYMPTOMS ARE VAGUE?
