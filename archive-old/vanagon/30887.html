Subject: Re: Cops buses and profiles

In the old old days two bearded long haired brothers (no, no, they had the
same mother) and I were on a road trip in a van from Flagstaff, AZ to
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to meet some other family members. We got stopped on
a Sunday morning in clear weather by a OK state trooper &quot;because our Arizona
license plate was dirty.&quot; He yelled at us for GP and said that he'd haul our
sorry butts on front of the magistrate but he'd have to call him from home.
Grrrrr...
All righty then! &lt; new catch phase used by everyone under the sun to replace
&quot;there you go&quot;&gt;
He didn't know it but it was a case where he easily could have. (,Man)    Yowll!
Some buses with flinstone front floors come in handy. ;)
