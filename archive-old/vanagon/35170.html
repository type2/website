&gt;To put the belt on for the A/C you would need to remove the fan housing,
&gt;and the fan(I am assuming that the pulley is between the fan and the
&gt;case).  I haven't figured out how to remove the fan, and housing without
&gt;dropping the engine, but it has been said that it can be done.

&gt;

You only need to remove the fan.  Belt can be slipped behind the housing.
