Subject: 911 in vw


I'm sorry I was misinformed it is a flat six not a v-6, but as far as 
cost the only reason I'm asking the quesation is because I'm mostlikely 
buying a 69 van next week, as soon as my favorite autoshop takes a good 
look at it, it has a rebuilt engine with dual carbs 8k miles new and a 
friend of mine races Porches and has a 72 911 fuel injected flat six for 
sale $1500, but I think I can get it for $1200 or $1000. So I can 
mostlikely cover most of the cost with the money from the other engine. The 
engine is fine with a little work needed my frind will do for free. I just
wonder if I can simplly swap the engines with maybe a few simple ajustments or 
will I need to do a major job putting the thing in. So will it fit in the 
engine compartment and will it match the transmition? Anything else I 
need to look for or worry about?
