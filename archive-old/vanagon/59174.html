Subject: Cheap paint job on EVs
Date: Wed, 30 Apr 97 21:09:27 EDT

I suspect that the paint jobs on the EV's is very  porrly done.  On my own 95 
the finish seems very soft.  There are scratch marks on the paint near the 
door hands.  I also looked at a 94 that had surface rust on the seams.

So may be we need to keep a poor paint registry for the purposes of 
documentation and some form of compensation?

I hate to think of my EV disolving.  Sure is hard replacing a poor body.

Chris
