     Just a reminder to everyone within range that the 7th annual Central 
Ohio Vintage Volkswagen Club Volksfest will be this Saturday.
     For details, and a map (highly recommended) go to 
http://www.fpi-protostar_dot_com/covvc/

     Can anyone fill me in on the date/time for the Cincinnati/Northern 
Kentucky show?

     See ya there.
