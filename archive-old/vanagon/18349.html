Subject: Why Marlene?


The Westie is called Marlene because like Marlene Dietrich she's German 
and old. All kidding a side, the retired couple we bought her from had 
named her and we thought it proper to save the name.  By the way the dogs 
do try to sneak up on the bed and often succeed!

bye for now.
