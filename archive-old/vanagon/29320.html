Subject: An art exhibit for the road set

I saw an exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art this past weekend
that blew me away, and I'd like to recommend that everyone in the Bay Area
see the exhibit before it disappears.

The show is entitled &quot;The A-Z Travel Trailer Unit&quot;, and is centered around
three small trailers, each with an interior designed by the travelers who
would use it.  These three trailers then traveled from San Diego, California
to San Francisco along routes chosen by the travelers.

The trailers are stunning, and the accompanying 'trip mementos' are very
interesting.  But the trailers... whoa.  They're beautiful.  I wish my Bus
had the cohones to pull one of these... I'd never have to pay rent again.

It's rather odd to see these trailers sitting in a gallery on the third
floor of the building...

P.S.  If you've never been to SFMOMA, it's worth the trip just to see the
      building.  The museum is beautiful.  It's located downtown, near the
      Moscone center.
