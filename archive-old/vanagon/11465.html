Subject: Re: westy H20 leak

&gt;Last weekend, I worked long and hard to get my sink/faucet/drain
&gt;stuff operating properly in preparation for the Red Rock trip.  It
&gt;all works fine, except that I'm convinced (after finding a lot of
&gt;water on the &quot;living room&quot; carpet of the westy) that I have a leak
&gt;in one or more of the following places:
&gt;
&gt;1.  the water tank itself
&gt;2.  the line form the tank to the pump
&gt;3.  the line from the pump to the faucet
&gt;4.  the line from the sink down to the outside drain
&gt;
&gt;Help!  Has anyone had this happen?  Any suggestions for how to track
&gt;it down (please remember I am NOT very left-brained  :(            )

Martha:

The simplest thing to check is whether the screw-top cap on the tank is
sealed tightly.  If you filled it up to the very top, and the cover is
loose, that would account for the lots of water.  (One way to check this is
to look at the level in your tank.  If it is full, and there is water on
the floor, you overfilled it and had an overflow.
