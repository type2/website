So Tobin T. Copley says:
&gt; Saw this in the local &quot;Buy &amp; Sell&quot;, and since it seems some folks on the 
&gt; 'net have been looking for pick ups every now and then, thought I'd throw 
&gt; this in...
&gt; 
&gt; 86 VW 3 door PU, 4WD, syncro 2.1L, excellent in/out,
&gt; 125kms,original paint, very rare $10,900obo
&gt; phone (604) 753-0991
&gt; 
&gt; (That's 10,900 Canadian, so translates to, what, $7,850 US?)

Would someone please pass Joel the tissues?   ;)

Sorry Joel, life just isn't fair, is it?
