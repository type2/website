The difference in power is enormous - I can now regularly pass many
cars going up hills around here, often in 5th gear. Mileage has also
improved - I now average &gt;55mpg CDN, or about 1040 km on 50 litres
of fuel. Be aware that factory recommends changing oil *twice* as
often for the turbo compared to all other engines.

btw: I've now put 180K on my TD since getting it, with only problem
being a head gasket oil leak. It was not major, just making a mess of
my garage with oil.

I agree, my Golf TD is doing 700 km on 40 litres and I heard, that
Vanagons will need the additional Turbo power for comfort
switching from third to fourth gear. The only problem on the
140 Tkm 8 year old Golf I had is a broken muffler, nothing else.
I'm changing oil every 7500 km and I'm sure, the engine needs
this.
