Subject: QMI test

I had a Mitsubishi Cordia HB about 4 years ago. I was so amazed at this
QMI product that I put it in the car's crank oil. To make a long story short,
one day the car just kinda sputtered on the freeway and I looked at the 
gages... all were fine except that the oil pressure gage showed NO 
PRESSURE! I brought the speed back down to 60 mph and made it home
(another 10 miles). First thing next morning, I brought the car to the
shop and they told me that the gage was fine (which I thought was what
was bad)... but there was NO OIL in the engine! (Actually they said that
there was about half a cup or so...) Anyway, the engine was fine and they
simply put new oil in. They said that whoever changed the oil last (2 weeks
prior to that event) maybe made an honest mistake and _forgot_ to put
new oil in (it's happened before, he says). No oil leaks were found and
the engine wasn't burning oil anyway.

Now to the VW thing.  Since then, I've always put QMI in my engine oil
in all of the vehicles I've owned (and sold). Now I have an 82 Westy and
QMI swims in its oil. I have no oil temp gage to actually see how QMI
works in this air-cooled engine. Q: Is anybody out there willing to 
put QMI to the test and share the results with us? Just get a reading on
your oil gage for normal and hard engine work, and THEN change your oil
and add QMI and compare the readings. I'd really appreciate your posting.

BTW: QMI sells for around $24 to $30 here in Tucson, AZ.
