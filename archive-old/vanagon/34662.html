Subject: Re: placement of list stickers?


&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it would be good if we can decide collectively where to place
&gt;&gt;&gt;the beautiful new stickers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bottom left corner of the rear window, gets my vote!
&gt;
&gt;Top left corner of rear window gets my vote.  It won't block visibility
&gt;there, since the A/C unit is already in the way.

But... but... you can't see low-flying jet planes approaching from the rear!

P.S. What's an A/C unit?
