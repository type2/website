&gt;Amen!
&gt;This _STUPID_ thread is the reason I dropped VinatgeVW!
&gt;Arguing here isn't going to change these magazines.  ACK!

aw shuckens. :( and we didn't even get around to my favorite topics of ...
Duke Ellington and his famous &quot;Take the T&amp;A Train&quot; ...
those ever-popular little T&amp;A-frame cabins up in the woods ...
those horrible days in the 1950's when we were all scared of the T&amp;A-bomb ...
:)

&gt;So, can anyone tell me when European busses ceased to have
&gt;semaphores.  I saw a green kombi with the same taillights as my '57,
&gt;but not turn signals, and I couldn't see any semaphores by the doors.

well ... i've seen buses with phores, but not with semi-phores. saw a beetle
once ...

:)
sniff! sniff!! i smell a Friday coming this way!!
