Use a pry bar with a hammer and wd-40.  Are you begining to notice a
pattern?  You might try a large pipe wrench to twist it with (that's a
spanner in the commonwealth universe) but you'll leave teeth marks in the
wheel bearing cover ( and it might scrunch).  Finesse is not applicable
with old rusty suspension parts.

&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;        Thanks alot for the suggestions - penetrating oil, whacking with hammer
&gt;and a decent screwdriver did the trick although I broke one of the star points
&gt;in the process.
&gt;        Everyone told me how hard it would be getting the hubs off, no one said
&gt;how hard they'd be to get back on again! I managed it in the end - is the trick
&gt;to put the hub &amp; wheel on separately?
&gt;        Ok, so rear hubs are get-off-able, now I'm having problems with
&gt;the front
&gt;ones - how do you get the cover/seal thing in the centre of the hub off? (not
&gt;the chrome hub-cap, the thing inside in the middle - sorry, I don't know what
&gt;it's called). Muir says use screwdriver and hammer, but mine isn't budging. It
&gt;doesn't even look like a separate thing! Am I trying to do something stupid?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Sarah
