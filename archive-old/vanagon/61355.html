Subject: 1700 cc engine; push-rod tube seal replacement ??



Hi friends,

I am replacing some leaky push-rod tube seals on my old '72 Westy this
weekend.  Does anyone
have any cool advice or suggestions to help me make this a smooth easy job..
I think I might be missing a
retainer clip on the left side. Where can I find one of these ?   How
important is that clip ?   
On replacing the seals, is it really a simple job ?  I guess all I will have
to do is remove the rocker arms
as per John Muir and get at it. Do the tube slip out easily after this ?
Any advice is seriously appreciated .

Please direct all responses directly to :  gvonkipa_at_students.wisc_dot_edu

Thanks very much,   Guntram
