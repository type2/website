Subject: tranny fluid change in syncro....!!!!

Wow what a job to do that.....well were finished....and done..it took us 7hrs
to do the job.....the differential wasnt bad and the magnet was normal....not
too meatally but the back tranny.....wow what the hell was VW thinking
.....??? that suxed....we had to make a tool and everything.....but oh was
that tranny fluid dirty......yuck.._dot_compared to the front....wow and there
was alot of meatal on that magnet.......but we finally got both plugs
out...what a pain ...have they ever heard of neverseize./?????...anyone who
does this should use it so you can get those bolts off again.....!!!!...I
have ATF in there right now to clean the gears out and then on Tues. night im
puttin in Redline MTL.....so it should be good....oh if anyone is looking for
redline you can buy it at Agawam Speedshop in Agawam Mass.....not sure of the
price yet cuz he wont know till he gets it in but he said he can get
it...hopefully...=)
Well happy trailin to everyone...im outta here soon....
oh i'd suggest to anyone who believes vw about that lifetime deal that they
do a tranny oil change.....especially if they have a tranny over
100,000....mines at 140,000 and boy was that stuff dirty.....peace all....+)
