Subject: Re: Vanagon safety statistics

&gt;Click and Clack (the Car Talk guys) railed on a woman about the dangers
&gt;of driving her '76 Westy (tippy, no side impact protection -- suggested
&gt;she wear a footbal helmet).  Anyway, I've heard that the Vanagons are quite
&gt;safe.  Does anyone have real stats on this?  Vehicle deaths per mile?
&gt;Or Insurance company type of data?

Gee if Click and clack think a 76' westy is dangerous i wonder what they
would think of my all metal (padded dash we don't need no steenkin' padded
dash!!!!) deathmobile 65 westy. about all that separates me from a front
end collision is some sheet metal and the &quot;Y&quot; shaped hater tube that runs
up to the dash. Am i scared? Hah i laff in ze face of death &lt;cackle&gt;!

Hope i never have to find out how my bus fares in a front end collision,
then again my idea of driving fast is 55MPH!
