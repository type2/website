So Donald Baxter says:
&gt; 
&gt; I did it!  I got the 1985 Vanagon today, left the Passat at work and 
&gt; drove it home this evening.  Thanks to everyone who responded to my 
&gt; queries about this vehicle.

Congratulations!  You are now a REAL person.  You will automatically
command respect from other lower beings that own just cars and they
will be in awe of your wisdom!

&gt; 
&gt; A couple of issues:
&gt; 
&gt; I need an owner's manual!  I called around to a couple of the VW dealers 
&gt; here in Metropolitan Atlanta and had no luck.  Jim Ellis said they could 
&gt; order one but were not encouraging, if they could find one it could take 
&gt; months to show up according the parts person.  Is there some kind soul in 
&gt; the Atlanta area that could lend me theirs for the purpose of 
&gt; photocopying?

The factory Bentley is about the best you can get.  Mucho bucks but a good
reference.  Not much help in the step by step department, but nice 
pictures.

&gt; I am planning on changing the oil, filter and flushing the cooling system 
&gt; soon.  There appears to be no visible coolant in the expansion tank (blue 
&gt; or otherwise) but it does not appear to be leaking either.  What sort of 
&gt; flushing compund is recommended (if any) and must I use that expensive 
&gt; stuff from the VW dealer or are there other Phosphate-free substitutes 
&gt; available?  Also, since I don't have any specs on this car, how much does 
&gt; it hold?  How much oil, for that matter?

You don't need no stinking coolant flush.  Just flush with water and me
being on the timid side will use nothing but the expenso VW coolant juice
and distilled water.  Maybe a little paranoid but it's cheaper than paying
for new heads/gaskets etc.

&gt; Speed three doesn't work on the front heater/fresh air fan, the other 
&gt; speeds work if I jiggle the switch.  Is this a Vanagon only switch, or 
&gt; can I buy similar from Jetta/Golf?

Just replace the switch.  It's easy.  Don't try monkeying with the old
one.  It's not worth the trouble.
