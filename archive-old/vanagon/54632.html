Subject: Bench front seats (from a 9 pass.) in a 7 pass. 

I was wondering if VW ever offered the 9 pass. bench front seat as an option in
the 7 pass. (ie, a bench front seat that could be used without the metal
bulkhead &quot;half wall&quot; divider)  The bench front seat out of a 9 pass. relies on
the bulkhead as a support for the back. When you put the 9 pass. front bench in
a 7 pass. van, the seatback has no support, and flops all the way back.  Was
there a bench front seat made by VW with a seat back stop??
Has anyone tried this?
Would it be possible to weld on a seatback stop, like the ones that were used on
the Golfs, Rabbits, and other 2 door - 4 seater cars?

any info would be appreciated.
