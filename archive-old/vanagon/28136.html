     &gt;We've been wondering why the South African Syncros don't use the
     &gt;larger Audi 2.5 litre motor that their 2WD Vanagons use and I
     &gt;recalled something that suggests the answer.

     &gt;I remember when I used to correspond with ultra-high-end aftermarket
     &gt;company Oettinger (germany) that their six cylinder Vanagon motors
     &gt;came in a 180HP version and a 135HP version (approx. going from
     &gt;memory). They wouldn't install the higher HP of these two motors in
     &gt;any Syncro as they said the 4x4 transmission could not stand it. :-(

     Yet the 3.2l Porsche 911 engine MSDS uses is installed in a Syncro.
     In stock configuration, that must be about a 230hp engine. We need to
     talk to him about how the drivetrain has held up; certainly, he
     will know the weak links.

     My confidence that we (Syncro owners) could handle substantially more
     HP was based on the fact that MSDS has demonstrated the 911
     conversion, and it appears successful. Some of these conversions,
     specifically the Audi non-turbo 5, are similar in HP to the Oettinger
     4 cyl. engine.
