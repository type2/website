Subject:      subaru and kennedy swap

I'm looking at the &quot;repowering the vanagon&quot; brochure from Kennedy Eng.(so
could you if you called (805)272-1147).

It says the &quot;a&quot; (recommended)swap is the 90-94 (130hp)legacy or 95-97
(135hp) legacy motors.  The 96-97 Gt and Outback, because of longer stroke
and milder cam, may not be as suitable with the vanagon's gearing.  Calif.
a.r.b. requires both stock subaru cat. converters be in place.  They are
moving towrd certification of their own exhaust.

Complete vanagon kit runs 1493.00 u.s. plus engine, includes non Calif exhaust.

Hope this aids in your decision process, I hope to do this myself in next
year or two


Regards,

Dan

P.S. forgot to mention, gas milage is reputed to be as good, or better than
stock.
