Subject: Re: Pastel or Alpine white paint?

Pastel White is an &quot;off white.&quot; Ron's '90 and my '91 are Pastel White and
according to my dealer the '91 only came in Pastel White. 

Alpine White is a &quot;pure&quot; white. I have the paint chips from the '88 series and
they are definitely NOT the same. I do think you would notice the difference!

Don't spray Alpine on a Pastel Westy!!!!!

Check with a reputable dealer on paint availability. I am going to have some
body work done on mine (a &quot;face lift&quot; and a little touch up here and there).
My Dealer's body shop matches perfectly and gives a &quot;life time&quot; guarentee on
all work - so the paint has to exist through the dealer in larger quantities.

&gt; Does anyone know if Alpine &amp; Pastel white are the same color?  I have an
&gt; '85 Westy and the &quot;Pastel White&quot; touch-up matches it but I can't find any
&gt; spray cans of it, only Alpine White.  If they aren't the same and anyone
&gt; knows how I can get Pastel White, please let me know.
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; '85 Westy,   &quot;S-CAPE&quot;
