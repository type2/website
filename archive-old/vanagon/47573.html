Subject: Help! Diesel water pump - how to remove %$^%#_at_!

This may be different from a Vanagon diesel water pump, but my 85 
Jetta TD water pump seems nearly impossible to remove.

According to Bentley, I just remove 4 bolts mounting the whole thing 
to the block. OK. They don't mention you need to remove alternator. 
No problem, I did that. But the top two bolts are nearly hidden under 
the injection pump! Surely you don't have to remove the inj. pump to 
do it? 
I've already snapped craftsman 1/4&quot; drive U joint socket trying reach 
one of the bolts, and have very skin left on my knuckles...
I thought of removing only the pump part first, leaving the housing 
attached, but the 6th bolt on the pump is nicely hidden behind the 
accessory shaft pully and lower cam belt cover, which also means 
removing the crank pulley.

This seems a little ridiculous, esp since the Bentley claims the job 
only requires &quot;basic hand tools&quot;...

Help please!!!!

Thanks.
