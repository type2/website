&lt;&lt; Ironically from the way back from the VW show, my OXS light came on.  
 I went back to the discussion about open/closed loop, but didn't see 
 anywhere what it means when the light comes on.  Anyone?  I presume 
 it means either the O2 sensor has failed or there is another problem 
 with the exhaust (e.g. hole).
 
 Thanks,

Probably just means that you have reached the X number of miles that the
counter was looking for to turn the light on.  It's a mileage thing that lets
you know that VW thinks you should have your emission controls looked at.
 You can reset it at the box under the left front (by the spare tire).
