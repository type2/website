Subject: Re: Wiring ?

Sounds like the wires at the tail lights are swapped. The turn signal wires
are on the tail light terminal and vice versa.

&gt;I just got my Van back from the paint shop, but with a strange light problem.
&gt;The turn indicators blink at a high rate (all the the corners work) and when
&gt;the headlights are turned on the amber lights in the back instead of the red,
&gt;also the rear side marker lights dont light. I checked all the connections
&gt;and they appear to be connected right. I will check with the shop today to
&gt;see if there was any other part of the circuit touched but I am sure that I
&gt;will get the usual  &quot; we didn't touch anything else&quot;.
&gt;Any ideas would be appreciated.
