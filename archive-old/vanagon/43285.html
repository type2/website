&gt;This leads me to believe that the equivalent Weekender bed in a

this true? &lt;snip-o-matic&gt;
&gt;If I'd spent more than the $100 this guy was asking for the table assembly
&gt;I'd be really pissed, but so far it's only my time spent struggling to get
this  
&gt;thing fitted in, removing and installing the rear seat repeatedly, etc.  Any
&gt;bright ideas out there from the crowd at large?

I think that the seat for the vans with the fold out table is about 2&quot;
narrower than the standard seat.  I have one of each at home.  I'll measure
them and let you know what I find out.
