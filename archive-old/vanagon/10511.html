Subject: Re[2]: puke yellow color

&gt;
&gt; As I understand it there were four choices in colour for the early
&gt; Vanagons, blue, ivory, brown and white.....any others?...DC --
&gt;

  It sounds like you are talking about Westys only here. If so, I have seen
  a some green ones, at least one each of air and water cooled. That would
  place them right around 1983, right?

  IMHO, if someone feels like whining about that eggnog color, they clearly
  haven't spent enough time with an overpoweringly ORANGE &lt;yes, that's ORANGE
  everywhere - even the curtains&gt; '73-'75 Westy.

    Dave, not only is my '75 Van that lovely Orange color, but a deal of a
    lifetime on a '69 Karmann Ghia also turned out to be Orange.  We just
    told the neighbors that the Van had a baby... :-&gt;

    Funny thing about the Ghia, they had recently repainted it inside and
    out-ORANGE!

    Now all I need is for the Volvo Wagon my wife keeps threatening to buy
    if I don't get her heat in the Van, be Orange too!
