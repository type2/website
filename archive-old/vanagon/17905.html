Subject: 71 bus...floorpans
Date: Fri, 19 May 1995 12:50:37 -0400 (EDT)


My new bus is starting to grow on me...I may even keep it..if I do, how 
hard is it to put in new floor pans?  Big holes on drivers side &amp; middle 
where hand brake goes through.  One big hole near door in back area. 
Should I just patch &amp; patch for the rest of the bus' life? 
Besides the brake and ball joint problems I've previously mentioned, the 
rest of the beast is actually pretty good...no holes and only a few fixable
 rusty spots.  Anybody have suggestions?  How do you get the old pans out?
 Torch, chisel, sand or all of the above?  TIA.  Mitch
