So Sami Dakhlia says:
&gt; 
&gt; Fellow Pizza eating, VW driving freaks!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for all your suggestions! I propose, then, that we all meet on 
&gt; Thursday the 22nd at 7:00 pm at Pizzadelic in Palo Alto. Anyone have the 
&gt; exact address? 
&gt; 
&gt; 8 list members have indicated that they will come. Shall I then make 
&gt; reservations for 15 people? Let me know how many passengers you'll bring 
&gt; along.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forward to seeing the faces behind the windshields/screens.:-)
&gt; 
&gt; Sami, dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu
&gt; (510) 447-1441
&gt; 

Sorry, No-can-do.  Too far and I gotta work the next day.  :(
