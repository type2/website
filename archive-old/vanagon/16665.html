Make sure the case surface is absolutely clean.  Make sure you torque the
nuts to the specified value, and torque in a cross pattern.  I think too
much or too little torque will result in leakage.

Having said all this, I have to admit that I've never been able to completely
stop this kind of leakage on either my Bus or my Bug, although I only get
just a few drops overnight.  Anybody else had any better luck than us?
