Subject: RE: Avant garde composers (with VW content)


&gt;The avant-garde composer John Cage (1912-1994) is best known as a
&gt;writer of &quot;chance&quot; music; that is, elements of the composition such as
&gt;which notes to play and when and for how long are determined by rolling
&gt;dice or throwing coins as if consulting the I Ching.

Uh... couldn't you achieve the same thing by throwing gravel at a
pile of Coke bottles? But that wouldn't be music (either), would it?



&gt;He was also had an encylopedic knowledge of mushrooms, and gathered
&gt;them to eat.

Ahh... this begins to explain his value base...



&gt;For his long-time collaborator and companion, the dancer Merce
&gt;Cunningham, he bought a VW bus for $2336.   :-)

...proving that even the saddest poseurs can have at least one
redeeming feature! &lt;g&gt;


Happy Friday, all...
