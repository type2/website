&gt; nicer one, unless it would be a huge waste.  So, what do you all use 
&gt; and what do you recommend?  Is there some other I should be 
&gt; considering?  Thanks, Jim
&gt; 

Hi there.  I have a Proto adjustable ratchet head torque wrench part 
# PRT6016.  I paid $190.12 (Cdn) in Nov/91.  It's an excellent tool.  
The torque ranges are from 30 to 150 ft-lbs, and is a 1/2 inch drive. 
 The Proto wrench can be repaired and recalibrated if required.

Hope this helps.

Harry.
