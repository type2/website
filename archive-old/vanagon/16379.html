Subject: Re: Squeaking from front end (spare tire?) of Vanagon

&gt; My vanagon is just about the noisiest animal I have ever

&gt; Id like some advice on eliminating one of the most annoying sounds:
&gt; 
&gt; The spare tire under the front end seems to squeak and groan
&gt; as it rubs against the metal sandwich it is contained in.
&gt; 
&gt; I actually had a $1000 front end job done, thinking it was
&gt; my shocks!  To my surprise, the van handled a lot better,
&gt; but was still squeaky as all get out!

I may have the same problem, it certainly is loud when you step on or
let off the brakes, or go over a rise or dip in the road.
I thought it was my shocks too, but I haven't done anything about it.
I don't want to find out that it isn't the shocks and thereby make
it one of the unlube-able front end parts (stupid sealed system!).
I hadn't considered that It might be the spare wiggling around...
That would be nice.
It's been doing it for a few months...Never before...  So if it is
the spare, somthing is loose or shifted.
When the rain stops... I'll lie down and try shaking the carraige
that the spare lives in.

&gt; 
&gt; The bolt holding the spare-tire pan is  pretty stripped, so
&gt; Im going to have to get it replaced...it might not be as tight
&gt; as it could be.

They don't usually squeak like that, so I assume there's a way to shut
it up, hopefully just tightening the bolt.
Otherwise, you could put a rag or three in there around/under the
tyre and see if it helps.

&gt; 
&gt; should I spray rubber undercoating liberally on the tire-touching
&gt; metal surfaces? or will really tightening down that front tire-pan
&gt; fix it?

It wouldn't hurt, but rubber squeaks on rubber, so It might only
change the pitch, not eliminate it.
