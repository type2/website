	When I bought my '73 bus, it had an electric heater called &quot;Back 
Seat Heat&quot; bolted under the dashboard.  The PO had two wires running 
directly to the battery under the interior carpet(s) and down via the 
access hatch!  I promptly tore the whole shebang out and put it into a paper 
bag.  I don't know if it works but I may need to try it out this Winter (if I 
ever get the bus going again).  I think it had a ceramic element and one 
heat switch and a fan switch.
