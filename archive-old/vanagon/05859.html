&gt;Hi Folks. Has anybody used these spark plugs in the Vanagons?  My '90
&gt;Syncro Westfalia just chews through the stock Bosch Supers (w7cc0).  VW

This probably doesn't help, but I use platinusms in my bus, 911 and
my SO's bmw.  I use w5dp's int eh 911, I can't remember the number for
the others.  I've been using them for about 6 years, and they've worked
great for me.
