Subject:       Re: '72 bus CVs, rear bearings, and torsion bars?

Dyer said:
&gt; Well, I'm planning to disassemble parts of the rear end of my '72 bus
&gt; so that I can, at the very least, regrease the CV joints.  There is a
&gt; knocking back there that I hear when I drive over little bumps in the
&gt; road that I'm thinking might be a CV joint problem.  Also the CV boots
&gt; are tearing a little where they are clamped to the axles so I want
&gt; to replace all the boots.
&gt; 
&gt;...  How hard is it to replace
&gt; the rear wheel bearings assuming I have removed the axle assembly from
&gt; the car?  Will I need a hydraulic press?  Can I use a three arm puller
&gt; or just drift the races out with a proper sized socket? 

Dyer, check out simple things first for the knocking noise. When I 
bought my '78 (used, 52kmiles) it started making a knocking on bumps. 
Turns out the new shocks the dealer had put on (Midas!) were 
loosening up. I torqued the mounting bolts down and the noise 
disappeared. Check those and all other mounting bolts.

You probably should take apart the CV joints and rear wheel bearings 
and grease them. I did mine several years ago. Just make sure you 
remove that inner circlip before trying to drive out the ball bearing 
;-) You shouldn't need to use a press. Anyway, Haynes covers this
 pretty well.
