Subject: $25,000 splits

OK you early busses. Take heart. 

Sunday's New York Times picked 14 cars most likely to increase in value in
the next few years and you guys made the list. Says the Times, &quot;1956-76
Volkswagen Microbus. Current value: $1,000 to $8,000. Five-year projection:
up to $25,000.&quot;
