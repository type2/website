Subject: A visit from the stork!

All,
Sorry for the non-VW content, but last night at 9:54 pm Victoria Ashlyn
Goldberg, came in to this world.  At 5 lbs 15 ozs she is going to need a
vanagon or bus just to see over the other cars.  Good thing I already own
one. I just had to get that out. BTW this is my second, so at least I'm not
new to this father thing:-)
Cheers,

David
