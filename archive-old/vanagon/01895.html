&gt;Pulling up the road toward my house, hit the brakes and the damn brake
&gt;light came on. I sure wish I would have at least gotten it into the
&gt;driveway before the first problem hit!
..

&gt;But why does the light come on if the level is full? And is it really safe
&gt;to drive? (My Volvo has dual circuits - when it came on there we knew we
&gt;still had two good wheels - this thing only has one tank within the master
&gt;cylinder reservoir so I presume that means there's only one.)

Did you happen to check the cap?  I don't know if the early models have a
float switch but you should see if that is ok.  Also, the hydraulic clutch,
if you have one, uses the brake fluid too.  Could be air in the clutch line.
I know about that because we replaced the clutch slave cylinder several years
ago and the clutch master cylinder last year.  BTW, you can tell when the
clutch master cylinder is leaking by the pool of brake fluid on the floor
inside the vehicle.  :-(
