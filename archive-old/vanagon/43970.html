Subject: westy wasserbus help!

Hi

I recently got my first westy, an 83 wasserbus. I have a few questions that
I hope someone can help me with.

1. Does anyone know of a good mechanic in the central NJ area?

2. I can't get my fridge to light up using propane. I tried to clean out
the drains, pipes, vents etc. but it still would not light. I did not
remove it from the cabinet. Any suggestions.

3. On friday, my girlfriend and I were ready to leave for a camping trip to
the beach when the instrument panel went crazy. The seat belt light and
buzzer were flashing, the low coolant light was erratically coming on at
idle and the left turn signal flasher works slower compared to the other.
Could this be a bad relay? If I turn off the camper and then start it again
its ok. Since friday, it has not happened but I'm sure the problem is still
there. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks in advance for any help.
