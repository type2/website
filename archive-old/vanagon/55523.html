&gt; First off, Congrats!

Ditto...

&gt; The EV manual, or at least the one that came with my EV, does not have any 
&gt; info on the Weekender package...or specific info on the MV. It seems to be a 
&gt; &quot;universal&quot; English version, as it lists equipment that is available 
&gt; everywhere else but in the US, so you are not missing much.

You did or did not get the 18 page &quot;Supplement to Owner's Manual ...  1993 
Multivan&quot; (931.551.701.21)

&gt; One thing you may want to do is to check your new manual....the early EV 
&gt; manuals had an &quot;addendum page&quot; slipped into the manual. The old manuals 
&gt; referred to the oil capacity of the EV w/filter as 4.9 quarts...and the 
&gt; addendum says its 5.9 quarts. Check your manual, which can be ordered from 
&gt; any VW dealer, and if necessary make the correction.

Well guess I've got the old one.  But its 4.8 not 4.9... &lt;g&gt;
