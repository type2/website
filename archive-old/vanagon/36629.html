Subject: 


I have some real concerns with Volkswagen's service in regards to the 
EUROVAN. Below are my letters that outline some of our troubles along with 
some other problems. I would like to connect to other EUROVAN owners to find 
out if they have similar issues.

I would like to connect with other owners who 1. Love the Eurovan, 2. hate 
the service and have had trouble with VOLKSWAGEN/Winnebago. Yes, I know they 
are no longer going to market new EUROVANS in this country..but there are 
over 200,000 being driven about and support unfortunately is important to 
their continued performance.

Four days, old heater does not work..Volkswagen sends us to Winnebago 
contractor, they rip our floor while fixing heater problem. Rey Reece's

Dear Steve:

Jean and I have been enjoying our 1995 Eurovan that we purchased from you 
with one exception; service on our linoleum flooring.

The 1995 Eurovan is Volkswagen's newest camper model that is unique not only 
in it's physical appearance but also by the relationship Volkswagen has with 
Winnebago. I understand that Volkswagen sends Winnebago a VW van and leaves 
the interior cabinets/ appliances for them to install and warranty. That 
sounds great, but, would be even better if Volkswagen's agreement with 
Winnebago included good service sub-contractors. We only went to Gresham RV 
because that is where your Volkswagen personnel suggested we go.

Our efforts to work with Gresham RV via Winnebago alone have not been 
successful. Below I have outlined some of our difficulties in detail, 
hopefully this will help in bringing our Eurovan floor ordeal to a close.

As you recall, when we first purchased our vehicle it's LP gas line was 
defective and disabled the operations of the furnace. Since the furnace is 
covered by the Winnebago side of  the Eurovan we took it to Gresham RV. 
Gresham RV fixed the defective gas line, correcting the furnace problem. 
What they did not disclose was that they ripped the linoleum flooring in an 
attempt to move the seat back.

When picking up our camper from Gresham RV Jean was not informed of any rip. 
In fact, it was only later that evening that she noticed the rip (she 
smelled the glue). When she called Gresham RV they simply denied having done 
any damage. After some additional  phone calls to them, they decided that 
perhaps we should drive it back to them for their manager to review. This is 
when I first called you.

Your support was appreciated, you suggested we bring the Eurovan to your 
dealership in order for your own Volkswagen repair people to take a look at 
it. Jean and I felt grateful that you were willing to speak to Gresham RV in 
our behalf. It was clear to you that the flooring had been ripped and 
reglued.

Since then, Gresham RV did take responsibility for their part in ripping the 
floor and agreed to correct the problem to &quot;stock condition&quot;. Thinking this 
would complete our dealings with Gresham RV, we waited  until the flooring 
was in, and scheduled a time for the work to be done.

The  Eurovan is the only car we own. For Jean to drop off the vehicle for 
any repairs is difficult since without a vehicle she cannot work. We had to 
rent a car for $50.00 to cover the period of repair time needed for Gresham 
RV to handle the job.

The bad news is that when we went back out to Gresham RV to pick the car up 
they had done a very bad job in correcting the floor. Instead of taking out 
the cabinets and appliances and replacing the entire floor they simply 
removed a main section and replaced it. We now have an ugly seam and ripples 
in the floor that will no doubt tear soon.

I hate to think it is their standard work, but even when the assistant 
manager looked at it, he appeared  baffled as to why we were not satisfied 
and did not even apologize for the ripples. Jean and I took pictures before 
we dropped it off and will gladly bring these in if needed. The work is just 
not acceptable.

Gresham RV explained to us that all and any work done to our vehicle was 
decided on and by Winnebago. That it was Winnebago that told Gresham RV how 
and what to do.

Bob Humphry, Gresham RV's assistant manager, has spoken with his district 
service representative, a Mr. Frank Jacks. Apparently, our plight has been 
turned over to Mr. Jacks and any  further work to be done on our vehicle, 
including any reimbursement for the rental car,  has to be approved by Mr. 
Jacks. We have not heard from Mr. Jacks.

Jean and I are angry at the poor service and need your help. I would 
appreciate your assistance in contacting the Pacific Northwest Volkswagens 
representative to step in and speak directly with Winnebago. Our goal is 
have the floor fixed to stock condition. We would also like to be reimbursed 
for having to rent a car and reassurance that if we are to be without our 
vehicle due to repairs in the  future (regarding the flooring) that we will 
be reimbursed or given a loaner vehicle.

I  have attached the notes that Bob Humphrey faxed to me on May 23rd, along 
with a workorder that states: &quot;New Linoleum Back to Stock.&quot;

Yesterday,  I talked with Miles, your co-worker at Volkswagen, who was in 
the belief that you will not be able to help us and that we will have to 
take our case to court. I hope this is not the next step. Instead, I hope 
your customer service and connections as one of the best Volkswagen dealers 
in Oregon will help communicate to Winnebago, that we are only asking for 
good service on a vehicle that is under their warranty and a responsible 
partner on the 1995 Eurovan model.

Thank you.

 To whom this may concern:

Attached you will find a letter dated June 7, 1995 and various supporting 
documentation that will help outline the problems Jean Mirabal and I have 
been having.

I would like to add that Steve Burke at Volkswagen has continued to reach 
out with resources such as your number when prompted. This is something 
worth noting, since my conversation with Miles (see letter) was rather 
negative. Also, your customer service line attendant, Debra has also been 
helpful, she gave me two numbers for Winnebago. I will be calling them next.

Please help us get in touch with your Pacific Northwest Volkswagen 
representative. We would appreciate any services you could provide in 
helping us contact Winnebago directly. We have not had any luck in striking 
up a direct link to their customer relations department.

Any help and direction toward a successful conclusion to our situation will 
be due to both
Volkswagen and Winnebago. I know somewhere in Volkswagen's headquarters, 
there sits a manager who helped establish the Winnebago/Volkswagen union. I 
would like to know who he or she is and have them call me. I did not buy a 
VW 1995 camper Van lightly, the decision was made to improve the quality of 
my family's life. So far, I can say it has given me some joy but is clouded 
by this constant (Winnebago/Volkswagen) headache.

Dear Mr. Ebaugh:

Attached are letters and various documents that outline our service 
problems. Included are:
               Letter to U.S. Volkswagen, 6/7/95;
               Letter to Steve Burke, 6/7/95;
               Workorder : Gresham RV (replace linoleum);
               ADP Service R.O. Invoicing Set-up worksheet
                 (New Linoleum Back to Stock);
               Fax : Gresham RV Center Assistant manager: Bob Humphry 
5/23/95.

Jean signed the ADP Service R.O. Invoicing Set-up worksheet agreeing that 
our linoleum would be &quot;back to stock&quot;. The letter to Steve Burke, 6/7/95 
outlines the Winnebago/Volkswagen service problems.  Currently, U.S. 
Volkswagen issued us an identification number: 9500-27-261.

Thank -you for taking the time to respond to my call today.  Both Jean and I 
would   appreciate your help in making sure that the next person we are 
handed-off to will also be as responsive.

The outcome: Volkswagen said sorry it's a Winnebago problem, can't help you 
(EVEN THOUGH THEY SENT US TO THAT WINNEBAGO CONTRACTOR).

Winnebago sent a rep out. Jean sat for 4 1/2 hours waiting at the contractor 
service center where the repair to the heater was done, but the floor 
damaged. The center (GRESHAM RV) knew Jean was waiting to speak to him when 
he arrived. This person apparently arrived sometime while she waited and 
left. She was informed by a employee there that he had been there. She 
wanted to know how he got in to look at the floor since she alone had the 
keys, he said the van is easy to get into. She asked him if what she heard 
was &quot;so, he broke in to look at my floor?&quot; The employee backed away and said 
he looked through the window.

The rep. apparently recommended that the damage and poor repair was infact 
all that was needed to happen, that any further issue was not  a problem for 
Winnebago but ours.

SECOND:  The back battery would not charge up  during travel, the car would 
beep incessantly while the alarms were telling us to plug in. We had to plug 
in for the first 6 months. We started going to another Winnebago service 
contractor who would replace the fuses, but the same problem would begin 
after a few weeks. This service center, handed me a heap of fuses to take 
with me.

A month ago, during a reg. service check at Volkswagen they said oh,um you 
need a switch put on to shut off and shut on the ??..Well it worked, but 
they did not put the fuses on both of the battery fuse areas. SO, we were 
back for the additional switch later that month.

THIRD:
When we purchased this van, the dealer said if we wanted the middle seat it 
would cost $400.00, and that if we wanted it later on ..just call.
We called. He said it would cost $1400. to order. Wow..he then said that if 
he had one in stock it would cost us  $400. and that another dealership 
notifies him when they remove the seat.  He said they had none. We were 
stunned at the price difference.

We asked them what there hours were and drove over the mountain and picked 
it up, paying $400.00.


FOURTH:
While fixing this problem, they knocked some fuse wiring and we started to 
have to push jump this van to start it.   I took a day off of work sat and 
waiting for them to fix this.

Later when I was waiting for them to repair the problem below. I asked to 
speak to a VOLKSWAGEN DEALER who could help me with locating a middle seat. 
He was not helpful and did not even have the initiative to get a list of all 
the other dealers in Oregon for me. I said never mind and went to the parts 
department to see if they knew anything. I went to the parts department, 
they said no we do not carry these in stock and we don't have any in the 
area. They said that none of the other dealers in the area would order them 
unless requested. I asked them for a list of all dealers in Oregon. I went 
home and called all of them. A nice dealership in Bend, Oregon, 4 hours 
away, did have six of them. SIX!

FIFTH:
We called to ask if they could schedule us in to fix the Seal around the 
sliding door fixed. They scheduled us for Feb. 23rd. Since this is the only 
car we own, it takes time from our work lives to drive it over and bus back 
home. Apparently, they could have been lending us a lender car! This time 
they set up a jetta to use. When we got there at 8am..they were not ready 
for us and we had to wait until 9am, they also had no car for us. They 
arranged with a local rental car service and after a large amount of 
paperwork we were off. When we called later that day, they had not had time 
to look at it, the car they arranged for us was a tin can and it's tags 
expired that day. We had to drive in and pick up a different rental.

SIXTH:
We asked them about fixing our bumper, it  is under warranty.  I noticed the 
day before that it was cracked in the back. Two places were cracked 
 although I was not in an accident, I suspect that during our very cold 
weather it cracked. I asked them to look at it . They said we can't fix it 
because we suspect someone hit it, and we don't cover it. I did not have any 
idea if it was hit and it had no other marks on it. We asked about the 
bumper rating and they said they no longer use bumper ratings. Too many 
complaints?

Well, that's all the issues/problems we have had. Has any other Eurovan 
owner had such experiences. This car is a 1995 White Eurovan. AM I ALONE?
