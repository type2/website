Subject: Re: Need Cheep Sorce for VW Filters

I worked in Minot about 10 years ago, there was a good VW shop.  THe owner was
called Gene, I forget the name of the shop.
 
I'd be curious to hear if it's still there.

&gt;Subject: Need Cheep Sorce for VW Filters
&gt;
&gt;   I need a cheep source for VW oil and air filters, The dealer here wants
&gt;$10 for the oil filters and $20 bucks for each fan belt. Does anyone have
&gt;a favorite mail order company that sells the original parts. It seem like
&gt;the price here is marked up, or is this the going price?
