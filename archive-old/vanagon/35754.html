Let's see...you take a big club...oh, you said waste the rubber, not the
glass.  There are two types of window seals.  The 'pop-in' rubber that
everyone is so familiar with. And the 'glued-on' kind used in more modern
cars.

With the first type, you simply take a SHARP rasor knife to the seal.  (Don't
force the windows).

With the glued on windows, you need what they call an electric knife.  It
heats up and vibrates.  I is used from the inside of the car and cuts the old
adhesive.  The glass then pops out.  This kind of glass installation wasn't
used regularly until the mid 80's.

Now, if I could just install glass as easy as I can remove it...
