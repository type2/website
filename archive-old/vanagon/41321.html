I distinctly remember that last year sometime on the aircldvw listserv, 
that a fella picked up a governor at a swapfest and it bolted between the 
carb and the intake manifold.  If I remember right, it had something to 
do with a butterfly valve that would start to close at an 
adjustable air velocity, essentially choking off the engine.  I don't 
know who it was, but I remember him explaining it out t everyone...
