I can't believe no one has chimed in with their invention that takes
advantage of engine heat. I can imagine a tank with coils that transfer
the heat from anti-freeze. Come on guys..A couple of tees in the lines
going to the rear heater, some rubber hose, voila'!
Good Luck

&gt;&gt;Has anyone had experience using the H2O shower or other type of
&gt;&gt;&quot;bags&quot; that are supposed to heat water for showers while
&gt;&gt;camping?  We were thinking of using it by putting it the luggage
&gt;&gt;area in front of the pop top and letting the hose hang through
&gt;&gt;the drivers window into the sink when needed ...
