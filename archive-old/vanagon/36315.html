Subject: CB Performance fuel injection

All,

Has anyone heard anything(positive or negative) about CB Performances new FI
system?  I have heard what VW T&amp;A has to say about it, but I am interested
in real data.  It looks as if it has real promise.  If it is a good system
I may contemplate getting a setup for my Thing, and my Westy

Cheers,

David
74 Thing
79 Westy
