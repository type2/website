Subject: Re: Driving Lights?

&gt;Has anyone had experience in adding &quot;driving lights&quot; for daytime use to a
&gt;Vanagon?  I always drive with my headlights on but would like to rig some
&gt;lights that would come on automatically with the ignition.

I have been a &quot;daylighter&quot; since the early eighties.  On my last car I
added two Bosch fog lights (clear lense), mounted just beneath the front
bumper.  I had them wired to the ignition so they would automatically turn
on when the ignition was switched on and, more importantly, would
automatically turn off when the ignition was turned off.  I had an override
switch on the dash which allowed me to turn them off while the car was
running.  This worked flawlessly for the 10 years I owned the vehicle.

You are very wise in wanting day time running lights.  Many countries
require vehicles to have them (Canada and Sweden to name two) and many
fleet operators in North America use them as well.  The reduction in
daytime collisions is very significant (I believe 10 to 20%).
