Subject: Sliding Door Fix

I just finished painting the bus and had occassion to remove the sliding
door latches (didn't want to paint them). Upon re-installing them, I
realized that their placement was important to proper functioning of the
door ...duh. At any rate, I wonder if you can fix yours simply by
repositioning the rear and/or front latches.

Just a thought. 8) Joe
