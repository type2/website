Subject: Emergency fan belt



To All:

I've seen leather belts in use in Baja although what was holding them
together wasn't clear.  Apparently you soak the leather, lace the thing
together, adjust the tension as it dries.

Made it home alive using a fan belt made from filament tape (the fiberglas
stuff).  I know rope has been used (you unravel it, run a continuous
long-splice) and even steel cable (!) although I've never seen the latter two
in actual use.   I've seen some early steam and gas engine pulleys that were
designed for round and flat belting; vee-belting is a relatively new
innovation.
