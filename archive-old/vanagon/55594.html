Subject: bus to bed

Thanks all who gave me such good advice on long-terms storage.  Maybe I
can convince my brother to take the Duckmobile under his wing for a while
(unregister his wife's pontiac-   he's always wanted a camper anyway...).
I'll miss it, but I can't sell it, I haven't taken it to Alaska yet...
