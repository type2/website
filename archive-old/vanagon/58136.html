Subject: Oil light befuddles me.

        On my trip to Vancouver my oil light would start to flicker on, and
eventually stay on at idle, although only after it had been driven for a
little while.
        I had changed the oil a while back and it was acting fine for
awhile, but then it started kinda out of the blue. Ive been putting in 10W
30 as of late, and am wondering if I should go with the 20 - 50 since it
wont break down as quick.
        Would the light come on do to the 10W 30 being in there? Or is my
oil pump about to die or what? Not to knowledgeable in this area so I could
use a hand.

The man.
