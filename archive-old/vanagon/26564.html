Subject: Replacing lock cylinders.

Hi all,

Its Friday morning, I'm late for work, the ignition key won't turn and my
daughter is starting to look at me funny. I've tried the usual, WD40 etc.,
but it looks like the ignition lock cylinder has worn to the point that the
key won't match up. 

So how do you remove the darn thing? (Its a 70 bus, btw). I've accessed the
lock housing from underneath, removed a small set screw (as in Bentley), but
I'm afraid to start prying or pulling on the wrong thing. Anybody done this
one before? 

Thanks, Doug.
