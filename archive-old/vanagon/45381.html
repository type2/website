&gt; If you want to replace the CV before it actually fails (the intelligent

&gt; of course. But if more than one boot is torn... this is a good time
&gt; to replace ALL boots, torn or not, since you're already under the car
&gt; with the right tools.

My guess is... if one needs replacing, then they all probably will.  I
decided to clean up the CVs from the '80 Vanagon so I could prep them for
putting on the '77, but they all had signs of wear.  I thought they'd be
good since the Vanagon drove fine before I cut it up, but no such luck.  I
stil need to do the CVs in my '77... I think I'll wait till I pull them to
see if I need new ones.
