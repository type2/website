Subject: $100 (Canadian) Engine


Here's a $100 (Canadian) engine story:

I met this guy in Tulum, on the Caribbean coast of Mexico a few years ago.
He was driving a '68-'71 VW Campermobile of some sort.  I asked if he'd had
any problems on the way down (turns out he'd even been down to Guatemala,
etc.).  He said no, it'd run fine the whole way, he figured, because he'd
replaced the engine in Quebec before he left.

He said that he'd gone to a junkyard and just picked the cleanest-looking
engine from a pile of them lying around in the weather and bolted it into
the bus.  It still sounded like it was in pretty good shape.

&quot;Life is like a pile of old VW engines: you never know what you're gonna get.&quot;
