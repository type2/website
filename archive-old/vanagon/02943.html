&gt; For example, can we call up any authorized Bosch service shop and order
&gt;these parts? How do the prices compare to buying fuel injection parts at a VW
&gt;dealer.

i guess the bosch stuff can be ordered from anyone who sells bosch stuff ...
the FLAPS guy can order anything from the catalog IF it is in stock at his
supplier. otherwise, you're back into the old order-from-the-next-biggest-
warehouse game.

&gt;I think our next mission is to get the repair manual that authorized Bosch
&gt;places would use to repair a Vanagon.

i don't think any authorized bosch places would even attempt to repair a
bus. they just supply parts to the vw folks. some bosch service centers might
overhaul/repair a bosch component (like an alternator, starter, etc.) but
all this injector stuff is swap-out stuff (i think. has anyone heard of
anyone 'repairing' a computer? i haven't. all i have ever heard of is
'exchange').

&gt;There was a recall on VW's fuel injector seals. Do you think these part
&gt;numbers reflect the new upgraded part? I think we are all in danger of having
&gt;someone, someday, install the old fuel injector seals out of old stock, thus
&gt;endangering our motors.

i would rather doubt that all of these numbers are up to snuff as far as the
recalls ... unless the recalls were before the catalog was published (it is
a 1992 catalog). so since i didn't hear about the recall until 1994, i'd
be a bit suspicious about the bosch info numbers on that part for the very
late model buses (1991 and later).
