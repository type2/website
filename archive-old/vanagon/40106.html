Subject: Joel change the stats (60 kombi)

Well it is official I now have the 1960 model 235 Kombi in my (so to speak)
hot little hands :). I had it towed out of the barn where it was stored and
back to my garage. For all you that missed my previous diatribes, I sold my
65 ex-camper panel van (now referred to as &quot;Greenstone&quot;) to fellow list
member Josh Kline et al.

After getting it out in the sunlight i was able to more accuratley assess
the work that eeds to be done (pretty minimal body rot). I crawled
underneath and checked out the belly pans. There are a few small rust holes
on the front of the belly pan ( i assume that these will be pretty
straightforward to fix), but other than that it and the rest of the
underside of the van looks very straight. I lifted up the fron mat (holding
my breath) and..... factory paint :) There is one pin hole that i can see
other than that it is factory paint yay!

I also noticed that the bus has a 1967 &quot;Tourista&quot; sticker from Mexico on
the front windshield, so I guess this bus has done some travelling.

Upon closer inspection of the &quot;cargo&quot; section of the bus i noticed it has
the mounting holes for rear seats. Does anyone know if busses that cames w/
the mounting holes of the seats necessarily _came_ with seats (or whether
or not ths would be reflected in the m-code tag?). Basically I am curious
to know if this bus had seats at one point and time.

I won't be putting the bus on the road next week or anything like that but
I will be $lowly tinkering w/ it, hoping to get it on the road (time and
money permitting :)

Lastly does anyone know where to get original &quot;VW&quot; key blanks (the ones w/
the &quot;VW&quot; in the head of the key) for a 60' bus? I would like to get an
extra key

If i notice anything else funky I will post it to the list.
