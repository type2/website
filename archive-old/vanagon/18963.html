&gt; Which is a great point, you know even if VW could not get the VR6
&gt; in the thing at the start they might have saved their asses if they had 
&gt; at least put the 20V version in the van from the late Coupe Quattro, it was
&gt; out from at least 89 or so, predating the EV a few years.  And hell
&gt; would another $1000 for the 20V really have mattered to EV owners, I
&gt; think the power would have justified the price.  Of course if the
&gt; 20V is like a VW 16V, a revver, it would hardly have been appropriate.
&gt; The 2.2 was OK in my 2900lb Quantum Syncro, in a 3500+ lb EV, hardly
&gt; stellar.
&gt; 
You guys act like the EV is underpowered.  It ain't.  Okay I can't drag 
race the EV with the big V8 American vans.  But I can out handle them and 
I darned sure have more power than the older VW buses.  How well do they 
cruise 80 MPH and get 19-20 MPG?  If I didn't have the relatively lame 
automatic I'd probably run with the V8s.  This isn't a wimpy limping 2.2 
liter leftover engine.  Its a well tuned (not sport tuned perhaps) 2.5 
liter engine.  I have a 2.6 liter V6 in my S10 pickup - it can out run 
the EV at low speeds because its a manual transmission.  I can't keep it 
running as fast as I can the EV.  Have you guys who are knocking the EV 
actually driven one more than around the block?
