Subject: Re: brake fluid and cold temps

&gt; What amazed me is I didn't have to bleed the clutch slave cylinder after
&gt; adding fluid. My clutch didn't operate at all before adding the fluid.
&gt; 

Uhh, if you didn't have to bleed it, probably is cause its still a
leakin and &quot;self bleeding&quot; terribly.  Do yourself a favor, order the
$20 rebuild kit, get a $10 2 stone cylinder hone, and go to it, will
take you maybe 1 hour to remove, hone, rebuild, bleed.  Do all the
brakes at the same time BTW (bleed that is, rebuild if needed).  Can
use a bigger hone on the slave but if you ever need to do the master
the 2 stone job will come in handy.
