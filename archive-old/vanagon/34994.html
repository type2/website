Subject: Hoover Web-Site Update

After a couple months of being too busy, I just updated the Hoover Web-Site
with 19 sermons that have been posted here on vanagon.  I also took the
suggestion of pinhead_at_grove-ufl_dot_edu and added the Grendel Files to the
Netscape-Impared page.

I am planning on adding a page with the ability to search the collection.
