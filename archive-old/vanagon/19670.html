Subject: Trip Report--East Coast

Hello fellow listers,

We just returned from a 2800 mile week-long meandering in our red/white 71
Westy.  I'm happy to report no mechanical problems and plenty of fun on the
road.  My fiancee and I left Connecticut on Thursday evening, June 15 and
chose I-81 as our main route to the South.  We passed one friendly, later
bay window bus in Pennsylvania but didn't see any other buses until we
reached Charleston, South Carolina (surprised about that!).  When we were
passing through Virginia, the National Guard was out in full force,
apparently gearing up for weekend maneuvers.  A Humvee driver on the
opposite side of the highway gave us the peace sign and I suddenly felt
better, realizing that all of the bus owners must be doing Guard duty this
weekend and that explained the absence of VWs on the highway.  We also
passed many friendly truck drivers along 81 which gave a nice welcome to the
South for a couple of Connecticut Yankees!

We picked up the Blue Ridge Parkway and caught some beautiful views off
Skyline Drive.  While we did not hike on this trip, this drive spoiled the
lazy by providing perfect views at every corner from the comfort of the van.
We stayed on Skyline drive, picnicing and avoiding the very tame deer
population on the 35 mph road.  Finally, we became too accustomed to the
beauty of the many overlooks and we decided to head on and pursue less
attractive scenery for a change of pace. : )  We did pass a handful of
friendly vanagon westies on the Blue Ridge, but never managed to meet up
with any for conversation.

A friendly Virginian struck up a conversation with me at a gas station on
one of the routes off 81.  He told tales of killing a large rattlesnake in
his back yard that morning and went on to describe the large lizards around
these parts. I couldn't figure out if this was his way of scaring away
outsiders from some secret mining claim he had nearby or if this was just a
customary topic for local conversation.  Impressed by the local reptiles, we
travelled on. 

The accomodations for most of our trip was the van itself, parked in any
convenient rest area/welcome area.  I should mention that it is sporting
some fine new curtains that I made a week before we left [sense gushing
pride].  We did manage to visit a friend and fellow bus afficionado in
Virginia on our return trip.  Plenty of canned vegetables, fruits, and meats
was our sustainence, as we kept putting off filling our propane tank (talk
about LAZY!!!---ahhhhh, laziness...). 

At one rest area just over the Tennessee border we awoke to the voice of a
little girl outside our van who kept endlessly repeating &quot;I LIKE that van.&quot;
She finally asked her mother what type of van it was and we heard the mother
reply &quot;That's a love van!&quot;  That was a really nice way for us to start the
day!! 

What we saw of Tennessee was beautiful, although we only limited ourself to
the far eastern side.  We made a big touristy move by visiting Dollywood
(Dolly Parton's amusement park) in Pigeon Forge.  The musical entertainment
was worth the visit and the display of American cars from the 50's was a
treat to see also.  Alas, we did not bump into Dolly, but she was sure there
in spirit!

And now for my obligatory major blunder on this trip.  After leaving Pigeon
Forge we were stuck in New York-style tourist traffic produced by miles of
outlets and tourist traps around Gatlinburg (sp).  It was about 11:00pm and
we just wanted to find a quiet place to settle down for the evening. A quick
glance at the map gave me an idea that we should head AROUND the Smokie
Mountains via some route that must've been a hair that fell on the map.
Anyway, I could not convince myself as the bus headed steadily upward (tired
as we were and late as it was) that we were actually heading straight to the
top.  &quot;Must be some sort of ridge around the bottom&quot; I said to myself.  When
it became too much to deny, we had too much time invested in the ascent and
so we forged up and over and unfortunately, we missed all the great daytime
views that the Smokies would have offered :-(.

We spent some more time in the area, but decided not head back up the
Smokies the next day and try to catch it on our return.  It was on to South
Carolina, where we spent some time walking around the city of Charleston.
We walked around the Market area and passed through the university area
where we saw some bay windows and even a split (not something you see in
Connecticut unless you're at a VW meet).  We had some great soul food at
Alice's restaurant (well recommended by some locals) and then toured some of
the local plantations and gardens.  

One thing we did on our trip which I would recommend is keeping an audio
journal.  We had a handheld recorder which we used to mark the highs and
lows (and some of the mundane in betweens) of our trip.  

On the morning after our return I gave the bus her 3,000 mile tune-up,
stripped most of the camping interior out and began loading up our
belongings for a move we're making across town.  I had to treat the bus
after putting in such good service and so I ended up going to the
Litchfield, CT VW meet yesterday, which I hadn't planned on attending.  I
met other bus people who just returned from some extensive traveling of
their own.  I'll leave a report of the meet to someone else, as I notice
I've eaten up gobs of bandwidth already.  

Well, I hope to do another trip again soon.  Now I'll wade through the
digests and see what y'all have been up to.    If there's an interest in a
Litchfield meet report, I could give my views if someone hasn't yet reported
on it.

Happy trails!
