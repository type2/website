Hey folks,
Ric &amp; crew here.  Vanagonut_at_aol_dot_com (formerly VdubDude_at_aol_dot_com)

After being on the road on our trip around America for about a month, the
wife and I have decided to buy a full-sized travel trailer and tow vehicle.
 The three of us are having a real hard time trying to live in this Westy
together.  This, after spending a frigging fortune on restoring our '83
Watercooled.  I bought this vehicle about a year and a half ago from the
second owner.  He used it in his painting business because it had &quot;neat
cubbyholes&quot; for his supplies.  It doesn't have paint all over it, so relax.
 I rescued the Westy from him after the engine and tranny failed for him, and
most of the chassis was well worn.  Being a VW mechanic, I had a lot of stuff
at my disposal, so when given enough time, I did it.  Here &quot;it&quot; is.  The
making of the Alpine Westy...

Full Teutonix Wasserboxer engine overhaul (with water pump, Conti belt, Sachs
clutch, pilot bearing, most emission hoses, ALL fuel injection hoses incluing
those built onto the injectors), full tune-up (with all Bosch components
including oxygen sensor, cap, rotor, wires, filters, etc.).  Estimated price
of this package, $2,200.00

Freshly overhauled 5 speed transaxle with a special 4.83:1 ring &amp; pinion from
German Transaxle in Bend, Oregon (it must go back for warranty replacement of
3rd synchro).  The shifter box has been properly updated for the six gates
and the reverse lockout.  The shifter has also been overhauled with new
bushings and linkage and dust bellows.  New 5 speed factory shift knob.  This
transaxle option costs right at three thousand dollars alone.

All new brakes including new front rotors, bearings and seals, new rear drum
on one side, and new rear bearings and seals packed with Valvoline synthetic
wheel bearing grease.  The PO had left off a lot of brake hardware from the
front discs (available from dealer only), and I had to buy what was missing
and install it.  

The tires were four different sizes, so they were replaced  (bent rims were
discarded) with Sumitomo HTR 70 185/70 HR 14 radials.  I am seriously
impressed with these tires.  Three of the old plastic wheel covers are still
around somewhere, but I installed the Beetle style which I prefer anyway.  It
looked great on the German versions.  All four ball joints and one of the tie
rod ends were replaced as well as a pair of the A-arm bushings.  The front
shocks were replaced with KYB GR-2 units.

The radiator fan thermoswitch was replaced, both of the coolant tanks were
replaced, the weepy rear heater core and valve were both replaced (both
costly dealer only items), the engine temperature sensor (for the computer)
was replaced, the air flow meter (Bosch) was replaced, the right side CV
boots were replaced, and ALL of the joints were repacked and rotated, the
clutch slave cylinder was replaced (ATE unit), the sliding door was repaired
with the new nylon guide and a used kickout spring, the ignition switch was
replaced, the driver's headlight was replaced with a halogen unit, the dented
driver's door was replaced with a used unit which was sandblasted and
repainted inside and out and was fitted with new window scrapers and new vent
window frame.  The windshield was badly pitted, so a new one was installed,
the driver's mirror was replaced, the wiper blades are new Bosch, and the
stereo is a new Pioneer detach face AM/FM/cassette with CD changer controls
(no CD changer, but I'll let YOU fix that).

The big bonus on this Camper is that I built a trailer hitch receiver/
humongo bumper for it from 3/16&quot; 2X6&quot; steel rect. tubing.  It is totally
enclosed and can be used as a reservoir for compressed air if a valve stem is
installed.  It has a class III trailer hitch receiver that will hold things
like a trailer hitch, bike rack, rear cargo platform, etc.  Everyone who sees
this bumper says something like, &quot;that's not going anywhere!&quot;, or &quot;I'd sure
hate to rear end you.&quot;.  It is painted Pastelweiss like the rest of the
vehicle, as is the tow bar ADAPTER/BUMPER mounted to the front of the vehicle
for the Draw-Tite universal 5000lb tow bar .  The vehicle was in no way
altered to fit either of these items, everything is bolt-on.

The rear shocks have been replaced with air-shocks from the Syncro
application in the Pep-Boys book.  They work as advertised and they don't
release the springs from their perches like I thought they might since the
Syncro has more suspension travel.  The only drawback is a slight &quot;clunk&quot;
from the rear end over serious bumps/joints in the road.  The horn was
replaced with a hi/lo Cabriolet style horn.  This rig has no &quot;beep-beep&quot;
noise, it says &quot;honk&quot; :-)

All of this has been done in the last six months.  I built this one to keep,
but I can't.  I need the money.  All parts mentioned in this posting are new
except where specifically stated used.  

All of the camping equipment is present and usable (with the exeption of the
Water pump for the sink.  It runs, but won't pump), including, both tables
and pedestals, rear screen curtain, camping connector cord (with 30Amp
adapter), camping connector hose, all of the curtains.  I have installed a
Schumacher 1.5 Amp battery charger in the camper that trickle charges the
battery whenever the camper is plugged into the grid (110).  This enables one
to listen to the stereo, read using the dome, etc.  The sink works just fine
with city water.  The fridge and stove work flawlessly.

The Battery is new Interstate 41-60 month (the big, good one with roadside
service and a five-year warranty).

The jack, wrench, and spare are present and serviceable.

The motor got synthetic 20w50  after break-in 5mos ago.

This vehicle shows 167,000 mi. and the odometer works.  With all of the work
done in the last six months, that shouldn't scare anyone because all of the
components that are suspect at that mileage are brand new on this vehicle.

This vehicle has two isolated rusty areas (the rust is not structural at this
point).  One is just around the jack point behind the pass. door, the other
is on top of the front bumper beam under where the bumper would be without
the tow bar adapter (about three inches).  I didn't have time to fix these,
and I'm not about to now as I am already losing a fortune on this now that I
am forced to sell it.

If I were going to keep it, I would replace the sink pump, replace the
muffler (it has a loose baffle inside and is starting to really get on my
nerves), and do some minor bodywork.

I am asking $6000.00 firm.  Serious inqiries only, delivery is included
within reason.  Until Tuesday, we're in Maryland, next week we'll be in
Georgia.  In the next few weeks I will pull the tranny and send it off to
Oregon unless someone wants to pull it and send it off themselves and pay me
$350.00 less for it.

My figure is higher than bluebook, but you won't find this little number in
the bluebook, I can assure you.

The Alpine Westy can climb hills at speed with its' 4.83:1 rear.  The perfect
gear is always there for any load or speed.  5000 RPM comes at 20mph in 1st,
32mph in 2nd,  50mph in 3rd,  72mph in 4th, and slight overdrive in 5th.  It
climbs mild inclines in 5th with ease.

This is the one that you wannabussers have been waiting for!  Just buy most
of the parts that I have put into this Westy in the last 6 mos (for
$6000.00), and I will throw in the Alpine Westy for  free!

I will wait a little while to hear from some of you before I put it into the
Auto Trader papers.  I would rather someone who knew how special The Alpine
Westy was get it than some newby who doesn't even have the good taste to
belong to this list.
