&gt; &quot;goop&quot; or someother sort of product.

I managed to fix the &quot;de-rusted&quot; rubber strip back on by first 
tacking it at approx. 10&quot; intervals with Loctite &quot;superglue&quot; and then 
filling the gaps with contact adhesive.  Lots of clothes pegs came in 
handy for holding things in place.  12 months later everything still 
looks good and no leaks :) !  Take your time and it can be done.
