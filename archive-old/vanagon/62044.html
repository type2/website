Subject: RE: 87GL A/C Condensate Drain Tube ?

I have extended the drain hose on one of my vans just like you suggested.  I 
removed the &quot;duck-bill&quot; check valve and used some 1/2&quot; vinyl tubing to run 
through the air intake chamber - notched out the plastic panel where the 
intake hose connects so the drain tube can exit inside the engine compartment, 
and used a cable tie to fasten it to the rear engine support where it drains 
to ground under the car. I attached the &quot;duck-bill&quot; to the tube extension 
there.

I did this because inside the air-intake chamber are the fuel-injection cable 
end and a relay - and the F.I. cable bundle was often lying in water, where 
water could enter the covering and possible run along the cable towards the 
injectors. I also wire-tied the end of the cable up by the relay, off the 
floor of the chamber.

Be careful running the extension hose, and use something stiff enough that it 
won't kink - if the drains don't drain that water still has to go someplace - 
and there can be a lot of it!

I don't know that all this helped much - it was a few years ago while I was 
trying to track down the engine cut-out problem caused by poor contact in the 
air meter. (This affected both my vans - even after getting the cable 
connector &quot;fix&quot; from the dealer.) Finally cured this by removing the cover 
from the air meter and cleaning the &quot;wiper&quot; contacts, and using a light 
graphite lube instead. (CAIG ProGold would be better.) I think the grease 
Bosch used here absorbs moisture on high-humidity days and keeps the wiper 
form making good contact. Anyway I've had no more problem with the 
&quot;freeway-miss&quot; on either of my vans for two years after doing this.

Subject: 	87GL A/C Condensate Drain Tube ?

Volks,
Have seen posts on A/C condensate hose probs. My condensate hose just
goes through the sheet metal and into the RH rear intake at the top. The
tube is very short, only say 4 inches long, forcing the water to fall
from the end of the tube some 4 feet to the bottom of the air intake
chamber) Apparently it just drops the water down into the area at the
bottom of the RH air intake (which is completely closed off from the
engine compartment, and remains, I guess, from the old air cooled days)
and somehow the water puddling in the bottom of this chamber finds it's
way out around the air intake snorkel in the chamber and to the ground.
I am considering adding some length of plastic tubing, cutting a hole in
the bottom of the RH air intake chamber and giving the condensate a free
run out of the vehicle, instead of allowing to slosh in the bottom of
this chamber. Anyone know anything about this. I remember someone
mentioning something about the factory system causing seam rust and I
could understand this. Any feedback appreciated.
Regards
