So DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; would fit.
&gt; 
&gt; The syncros, especially loaded campers, absolutely should not use the
&gt; Michelin MXLs. Instead, they should use the light truck tires with the extra
&gt; plys in the sidewalls. I run BF Goodrich All Terrain radials in 27 x 8..50
&gt; size. 

Yeah, and then you should sell your unused MXL's to a hungry starving 2WD 
Vanagon driver so he doesn't have to look all over Hell and half of Georgia
to get another set.  ;)
