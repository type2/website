On the subject of feedback... Don't you think the other campers would
be annoyed if someone was wailing on an electric guitar?

&gt;Thom: is that going to be a _split window_ bus cake?

I'll Try.  I was thinking of making one for each generation (talkin' bout
my genration) but I'll see how much labor is involved.
