&gt; Since the recent discussion on clocks...
&gt; Does anyone know if the &quot;later&quot; deluxe clocks (mine came with a '65 deluxe
&gt; attached to it) can be repaired?  (Its an electric)

	Ahh!  Perhaps.  Here's what I can share:

	My Type III clock came with a squareback attached, and another
Type III clock in a box.  I then acquired yet another clock from a T3
which I parted out.  This last one worked until after a wacky lightning/thunder
storm.  Coincidence?

	Anyway, I had 3 clocks.  All manufactured in 1971, I believe, but
each in a different month.  (Them VDOs is stamped w/ dates on back.)  The
two older ones had one type of cover on the back (either plastic or metal)
and the newer one had a different style... even though the faces were
identical.  I opened up one of the old ones &amp; the newer one.  Aha!  The
old one was sooooo cooooel:  it was a mechanical, wind-up clock with a
little solenoid for a winder.  So *that's* why the clock went &quot;clunk!&quot;
every couple of minutes.  The newer clock had a transistor or two &amp; a
little rotational electromagnetic oscillator.  Powered it up... it &quot;ticked&quot;
but it didn't &quot;tock.&quot;  The oscillator would kinda wiggle through half of
its motion.  Somebody on wreck.autos.vw said that the mechanical ones
have a little internal hair-wire fuse.  Sure enough, on my mechanical
example, I found where it had been.  Musta gone up in smoke.

	I soldered a wire in place (sound engineering practice, I know!)
and it sprang to life.  Yay!  When the temps get below freezing it runs
a bit slow... but don't we all?

	Anyway, hope this helps!  Oh, I had to break a little plastic
tamper-seal over one of the nuts that held the cover on. :(
