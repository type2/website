Subject: Re: urgent propane fill question

Dan,

The two times I've needed my tank filled (it seems to last forever), I
took the camper to RV dealerships. They know how to use the 80% valve
and what to leave open for bleeding. I just stand back and watch. They
don't charge very much to do it. Would this be a possibility for you?
