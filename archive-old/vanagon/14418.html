when you buy a new pump shaft, get the best, ie. German. I went through
two Brazilian ones on my '72 before I got wise and went back to the
original one which I still had (don't ask why I changed it in the first
place...). The ends of the shaft are ever so slightly radius ground and
hardened, and it seems that it is not done as well on the Brazilian ones
as the German ones. Once you wear through the, I guess case hardened, end
it wears and mushrooms v. fast.
