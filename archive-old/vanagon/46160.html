&gt; A betty is a surfing term used to describe the non-surfing women

&gt; &quot;barney,&quot; but nobody seems to use that...

This term has also transferred over to the snowboarding world.  Although as far as 
I can tell it has lost the negative association it used to have for surfing.  Now 
it just seems to mean &quot;board babe&quot; (no political incorrectness intended) although 
this may be a purely Canadian phenomenon.

And what do big purple dinosaurs have to do with surfing anyway?
