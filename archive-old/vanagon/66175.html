Subject:      What is &quot;Level&quot;?

Instructions for the Dometic refrigerator specify not to operate it unless
it is &quot;level&quot; or damage will occur.  Does anyone know the specifications
for the maximum limit of tilt tolerated?  What damage will occur if the
refrigerator is operated outside these specifications?  Has anyone actually
damaged their refrigerator by running it while their Vanagon is not
&quot;level&quot;?

Most of the information we have on this is very subjective.  If anyone has
any hard data specifications, I'm sure many of us would like to hear them.

Thanks
