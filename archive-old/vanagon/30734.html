&gt;Hey all:
&gt;
&gt;Went to a local VW place today and picked up some &quot;dealer only &quot; 
&gt;stuff. While I was there, some guy was forking over $93 for the 
&gt;Bentley Manual. However, on their manual rack they had the Hayes 
&gt;(Haynes?) manual for all makes and models. For the Vanagon it looked 
&gt;a lot thinner than the Bentley one (not that this matters).  I was on my
&gt;way out when I saw the manuals sitting there, so I didn't get the price. 
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone give me a run-down on these. Are they as good as Bentley? 
&gt;Better? I'm sure it is mostly a matter of opinion, so all opinions 
&gt;invited.Thanks

Hey Matt, I have the Bentley manual as well as the chilton book and the
gospel of St. Muir.  I have nevr looked at the Haynes manual at any length,
but I can say that they are far superior to the Chilton manual.  I worked
auto parts for a number of years before returning to Graduate school, and I
can say that I used to sell quite a few Haynes manuals from the different
part stores that I worked at.  Nevertheless, I still wouldn't pay almost
$100 for the Bentley, I know theyre expensive, but I have seen them in alot
of the mail order VW places for around $40.  The Bentley manuals do have the
wiring diagrams (in color) which none of the other manuals have.  That is a
definate plus.  If you were to purchase the Haynes manual I wouldnt pay more
than about $25 for it.
