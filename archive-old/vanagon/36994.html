Subject: propane power?

Vanagoons:

There's a propane/CNG thread on the Vintage list... I was wondering if 
anyone here has done a conversion and knows if anyone around specializes 
in them. It seems like it'd be a great way not only to pass the 
emissions test but also run a cleaner car on general principles...

Anyone out there done this?

- Anton
