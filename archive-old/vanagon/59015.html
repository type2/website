Hi everybody,
     Since I've not been in school since the end of December, UT is 
cutting me off, so I went and registered my own domain. From here on out, 
my email will be &lt;ed_at_hintz_dot_org&gt; and my home pages will be found at 
&lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org&gt;. Since I had about 6 days warning that I was 
losing my UT access, I have not yet set up a domain alias, so for now the 
web stuff is redirecting to AOL, where I'm leaving it until I find a more 
suitable home, but unless you need to bookmark something other than the 
home page I'd suggest sticking with www.hintz_dot_org, as when the site moves 
the address moves with it-and I have no intention of staying w/AOL for a 
prolonged period of time. Cheers!

Peace,
