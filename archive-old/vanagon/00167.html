Congratulations Gerry, I know I'm not the only one that was paying attention
to your posts.  Dispite all of your hassles, you now know how to work with
another part of your electrical system and will reap the rewards of big
bucks that you won't have to spend at the dealer if it gives you trouble
again.

Cheers!

Steven
