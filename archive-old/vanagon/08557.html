&gt;More to the point, this article addresses them because they are a
&gt;demographic trend- a lot of them are sold. The Road and Track of the
&gt;1960s didn't cover Galaxy 500s and Olds Cutlasses just because they
&gt;sold in large numbers. The R&amp;Ts I bought at newstands with my lunch money
&gt;and still have some of were written with passion about cars that excited
&gt;passion, because of technical interest or excellence. Oddly enough,
&gt;Peter Egan reaches these same conclusions, after a long while.

Yeah, my subscription lapsed a couple of years ago. I don't care about
4-Runners or Cherokees. I wanna read about Miata's and Ferraris and MG's
and stuff!

Peter Egan's changed a lot, too. He had to grow up like all of us. He used
to write for Cycle World, back when they were owned by the same folks that
owned R&amp;T. I used to read that magazine religiously, too, until I got out
of bikes. It was good to see Egan come over to R&amp;T. I think he's one of the
best writers around.

&gt;        Maybe there should be term limits for autmotive journalists?

Oh, I don't know. R&amp;T used to have a bunch of good writers--Rob Walker on
F1, Henry Manny III (who was funny on just about anything) are the first
that come to mind.
