Subject: Went EV Parts Shopping Today


I went to my FLAPS today to see what they had for the EV...and came home 
with the following:

Front Pads - $55.00

Bosch Platinums $3.00/ea

Air Filter - $38.00


I seem to recal VW wanting about $170 for the pads, and about $45 -$50 for 
the air filter.

If anyone is in the Southeastern Mass/RI area, the place to go is Imported 
Auto Parts - Rt. 6 Seekonk, MA - 508 - 336 -9037.
