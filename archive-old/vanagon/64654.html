&gt;
&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Just wanted to let you know that the area code for the number for Thermo
&gt; Systems Inc., that's posted in the VW FAQ, has been changed.  The new
&gt; number is:
&gt;
&gt; 360/352-0539
&gt;
&gt; The company sells the only vented catalytic heaters which can be
installed
&gt; in motor homes/Vans.   fyi -- current price is $339.95 if purchased
&gt; directly from the company.  It includes the heater, a thermostat, exhaust
&gt; and intake vents.
