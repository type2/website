Subject: Re: CV Repair

&gt;&gt;          Complete rebuilt and warranteed axles,( both CVs etc,) for my '87 
&gt;&gt; Syncro are $141 CDN, (ie $100US) so you should do some checking. It is way 
&gt;&gt; cheaper to buy a rebuilt axle than to buy a dealer priced single joint and 
&gt;&gt; do all the labour and end up without a warranty. Same goes for my ex-Honda!
&gt;&gt;   tim s.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Where are you finding complete axles rebuilt for $100 US, the best I
&gt;could ever find was remanufactured joints for $45 each, were these
&gt;remanufactured with new OEM joints? if so share your source.
&gt;


Hi all, and the answer is: ta-da from my local FLAPS! BION!  &lt;- believe it 
or not. The local repair shops hate this place, since they sell at wholesale 
plus tiny mark-up. When I get a repair quote I can usually bring in the 
parts cheaper than the garage charges me, heh-heh-heh. The place is 
Automachinery Ltd, Fredericton, New Brunswick, (506)-453-1600. They take 
plastic, I've never asked about shipping though. Our sales taxes (2!) amount 
to 18.9%, of which you can avoid at least 11% worth by shipping out of 
province. So the shafts are $120US per plus your old shaft in exchange. 
Oddly they only listed up to '82, then only Syncro '86 and on. I suspect the 
rear Syncros are the same as 2WD std. trans. Anyone? Bentley only quotes one 
length for all years Vanagon, don't know about other details. There IS a 
difference with the automatic trans.
        I don't know about OEM joints, these are really jumbo ball-bearings, 
and like the rest of the bearings in your VW, they're NOT made by VW itself. 
But by whom I dunno. I believe the warranty is against &quot;factory defects&quot;, 
presumably if there are no tears in the boot.
        I can see what they would do with a USA order, I don't know what the 
core charge is. Trans-border shipping is a pain, brokerage fees. I can MAYBE 
help by delivering to Houlton Maine postoffice, but you likely won't avoid 
Cdn taxes.   tim s.
