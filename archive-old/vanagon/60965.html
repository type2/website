&lt;&lt; There is plenty of room behind the front passenger seat and it would be
 nice to have a nap while alternating drivers on a long journey, but the
 seat only goes back to about 45 degrees.
 
 Is there any way of hacking at the hinge so that it reclines all the way?
 
 Or else is it easy to replace it with a seat from another vehicle? I would
 however very much miss the arm rests.

I know of someone who put seats out of a Subaru in their Van. They recline
all the way back.  Doubt the tracks are the same, but I don't know, as I
didn't ask him. Anybody got both a Subaru and a Vanagon who cares to see if
it'll fit?
