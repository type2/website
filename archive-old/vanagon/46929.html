Subject: 84 WB Coolant Light... More(U)

Sometimes these things must sense we have the upper hand and then do things to 
remind us we are mere mortals... Last night added new voltage stabilizer... 
light still flashes. Shorted connector at bottle, no change. Tightened ground 
connections at engine, nothing. Bentley shows a coolant light controller or 
relay in wiring diagram... anyone seen this or a had problem with it. I looked 
on fuse panel with other relays and didn't see it. This is a matter of honor 
now. I will not degrade myself and go to a dealer. Thanks for the responses so 
far. I hate that light...
