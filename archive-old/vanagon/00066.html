&gt; I have a factory A/C videotape used to train the VW mechanics at the dealers
&gt; on how to properly maintain the A/C system. It is short but enriches your
&gt; life...that is, it would enrich the life of anybody on this mailing
&gt; list....:)
&gt; 
&gt; I have several other factory VW training tapes. I lend them out sometimes
&gt; although mostly I try to hide the fact that I have them because even though I
&gt; charge a fee for this it is debatable whether I should be spending the time
&gt; to do it. 
&gt; 

Wow! Can You dub it onto another tape?  I'd like to have a copies if it don't
cost too much.
