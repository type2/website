Yeah, I heard about this too.  A capacitor is the separation of two
conductors by an insulator.  Hmmm ... let's see:
	A steel truck
	A bedliner
	A steel gas can
yep, that works.

I'm thinking even a plastic gas can could be disastrous if the pump isn't
grounded just right.  What are those gas pump handles made of?

&gt; Been catching up on the weekend posts.  Took me until Tuesday!
&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of gasoline, I saw a notice at one of my local gas 
&gt; stations that, while not of much direct VW interest, it may be for 
&gt; those with malfunctioning gas guages, odometers, forgetfull, etc.
&gt; (you know, those situations that require getting additional gasoline 
&gt; into you stranded vehicle, not that I&quot;VE ever had this problem =8-0
&gt; 
&gt; There is a real potential for fires caused by filling gas cans while 
&gt; tha cans are in a plastic bed liner in a truck (I suppose the same 
&gt; could be true for those newer plastic station wagon liners too).
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently the plastic bed liner can attain a sufficient static 
&gt; electrical potential that the act of filling a gas can placed on the 
&gt; plastic liner can initiate a spark, and boom, gas fire.
&gt; 
&gt; DO NOT FILL GAS CANS IN THE BED OF A TRUCK WITH A 
&gt; PLASTIC BED LINER
&gt; 
&gt; According to the article (no reference to source unfortunately) 
&gt; 23 people have died or been maimed as a direct result of doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who may think this is a hoax, I firmly believe that the 
&gt; scientific reasoning behind this situation is believeable, and it 
&gt; can't hurt to fill the can on the ground.  Better safe than sorry.
&gt;

&gt; While it may not be a loss to the VW world to lose a few non-VW 
&gt; trucks, it would be a shame to lose a VW owner in the process ;-) or 
&gt; a neighboring VW at the gas station!
