&gt; Hi James, is there ANY form of 'official memo' available from them, or is 
&gt; this a case by case basis that the dealer must contact VW to ask for $$. 
&gt; Sorry to bug you on this, I have 2 wasserboxers that could use slight TLC, 
&gt; especially if it's free/20% cost.    tim s.

Sorry that should have said &quot;Antonio Volkswagon&quot;. Mispelled.

The only memo I'll have will be my receipt and work order for having the 
work done yesterday and today. A senior service rep there simply said 
he'd telephone VW and believed that they would pay a big part of it. I'm 
not sure that the service rep calls. perhaps they have one of their 
managers or the service dept. manager make the call. I don't know. But it 
was informal in terms of paperwork between me and them. And I got the 
idea that the dealership discusses particulars of each case and prior 
service records on file for the vehicle in the course of VW America 
deciding how much they voluntarily will offer to pay.
