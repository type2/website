Subject: RE: for allistair: unimog field test (long)

&gt;From: &quot;J. Walker&quot; &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; U.S. 'Mogs
&gt; Plain vanilla (actually, orange) Unimogs are shipped from DBAG's
&gt; Gaggenau plant via Baltimore to Schmidt, where they are prepared to
&gt; meet U.S. specifications.  Since the 'Mog is classified as a tractor,
&gt; meeting safety and emissions regs is simple, mostly entailing addition

Back in 85-87 during school breaks I used to work for a vehicle processing
company that was under Ford.  One of the things I did was truck shuttle
where I would drive trucks from the port of Baltimore (Dundalk, MD actually)
to the plant.  Several times I would see 5 or 6 unimogs parked in a line
(over half million dollars!) next to the several hundred Mercedes waiting
to be shipped to their processing plant in Belcamp, MD.

The first time I saw one I knew what they were but nobody understood what 
I was talking about.  Unfortunately I was not able to get close enough to
look at them.  I also saw hundreds of Mercurs, Volvos and Yugos plus
5-10 Ferraris every month.
