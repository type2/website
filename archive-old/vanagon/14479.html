Subject: Re: backfire!

Check for holes in the exhaust or missing/poorly fitting exhaust gaskets.  
I've had problems with the exhaust &quot;donut-gasket&quot; things that mate the 
muffler (4 tip monza) to my heat exchanger pipe.  It seems through either 
some fault of my own in securing the gasket or perhaps the muffler pipe is 
too large relative to the heat exchanger pipe, I would &quot;lose&quot; the gaskets
--either they would disintegrate or get sucked 
into the muffler pipe.  Anyway, this caused that backfire at downshift 
syndrome that you described.
