From: Kevin Murray &lt;volkfolks_at_atlantic_dot_net&gt;
Subject: M-code synopsis

In addition to my referencing the now infamous M-Codes 
list &quot;Optional Extras: The M-Numbers&quot; compiled by Michael 
Steinke with translations and additions by; Burt Reif, 
Mary Smith, Dave Easterwood and Tom Brouillette which was 
published in the 9/10-95 issue of the Old Bus Review #45)
and after much help from fellow Listfolk Dave (Easterwood),
Jim (Bryant) and Shan (Hemphill, who started all this) the
results are in.
&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;
&gt;                                   &lt;
&gt;            04  8                  &lt;
&gt;                     425 025 114   &lt;
&gt;          UP 2412 381370 7005365   &lt;
&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;

TOP LINE------------------------
04  = 4th day
 8  = 8th month

MIDDLE LINE---------------------
425 = dual master cylinder
025 = lap belts
114 = 6 pop-out windows

BOTTOM LINE---------------------
U   = USA  
P   = (port of entry?) &quot;PORTLAND,WA&quot;?
241 = model number 9241 is LHD Deluxe or Samba
38  = upper body colour Velvet Green
13  = lower body colour Pearl White
70  = Upholstery and trim Mesh Platinum

add 24 to the front of the last # = VIN#
    = 247005365

Viola...

Now I just have to figure out how to get it from
Spokane, Wa to Ocala, Fl in a reasonable timeframe?

Kevin
