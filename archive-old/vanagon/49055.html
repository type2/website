Subject: TP jar test


all this talk about Porta Potties...  and TP

RV TP is made to dissolve readily in water and it doesn't really
need the holding tank chemicals to facillitate that.  it works but
so do alot of other grocery store brands, at much reduced prices. 
the trick is finding the right brand.

TP can be 'tested' by the end user, er, the consumer for suitability for 
on-site septic systems and RV tanks by placing a wad of TP, clean 
thank you, in a jar half filled with water.  put the lid on and shake 
(&quot;Shaken.  Not stirred&quot;) to see how readily it dissolves into floaty 
pieces.  some brands remain in their original ribbon form, others 
form a disgusting floc.  you want the disgusting floc type.
