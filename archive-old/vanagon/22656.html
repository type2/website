Subject: music question


I'm looking for the words to an oldies song called &quot;The Ballad
of Billie-Jo&quot; sung by Bobbi Gentry.  You know - the one about
throwing something off the Talahassee bridge, Choktaw ridge, etc. -
that should jog your memories.  

I know this isn't VW related; how about if I say that I want to
listen to the tune in my westy?  :)

Second, as I recall the words do not state WHAT Billie-Jo was
throwing over the bridge, but I remember there was some great
mystery about this.  Does anyone out there remember what it
was?

Thanks!
