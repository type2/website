Even the &quot;hollywood-ized&quot; movie version of this scenario - &quot;At play in the 
fields of the Lord&quot;, is enuf to piss you off ..

 &gt;I remind you that I was not the one who brought this up.  Have you read the
 &gt;book &quot;The Missionaries: God against the Indians&quot; by Norman Lewis?  Let me
 &gt;quote the blurb:  &quot;This book will make you angry.  It is about genocide,
 &gt;practiced today, against helpless people in the name of god.  These
 &gt;destroyers are called Christians...&quot;
