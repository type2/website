Subject: Re: Vanagon high-roof sighting

Most fears about driving a high top vanagon are similar to those prior to
having sex for the first time-namely: 1) It appears the position requires
such a high center of gravity that one may topple over 2) The unfamiliar
curves could cause a complete loss of control, or 3) An occurrance of wind
during such an act could cause an an embarrassing upset between all parties
involved.

In reality, both experiences prove quite pleasurable, once the initial
fears are dissuaded.  Although I do still worry over an embarrassing,
unexpected wind from time to time.

P.S. It was a great dissapointment to see no vanagon-based christmas carols
were posted this past season.

&gt;I doubt that that fiberglass and empty air space would raise the center of
&gt;gravity much.  All the heavy stuff is still down low.  I'd guess a raise in
&gt;the center of gravity of maybe 1/4&quot; so cornering wouldn't change much.  The
&gt;center of pressure is another mater.   The center of pressure would be raised
&gt;about 9&quot; and could be a problem in significant winds.
