Subject:        Re: VW EuroVan chassis &quot;Rialta&quot;

Hi Carl:  I test drove one.  It drives very well.  Made by Winnebago.
Winnebago has made a much more serious commitment to them than the Eurovans
unfortunately.  It is much more of an RV than a van which is bigger than I
want and $$$$ -- about $54,000!!

I'm still trying to figure out how to buy a EV Westi, perhaps in Canada,
and get it legally into and registered in the US.  It may not be worth it.

&gt;larger than a EV Winnebago camper.  Probably a bathroom and microwave in
&gt;there somewhere but I haven't gotten a peek inside yet.
