Just so you folk going to Red Rock don't forget....

PLEASE!!! remember to bring some wood with you.  There isn't
any there.  You should be thinking about where you can get a
bundle or two now and not when you're driving down.  Please 
remember to do this one thing because it's awful cold at night
in the desert!  

Thanks....
