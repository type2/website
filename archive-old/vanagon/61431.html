Where did that price come from?  Is that including all the hoses in the van?  
Seem excessive to replace the two tubes.  Figure three or four hours labor 
plus parts.

Subject:	hoses for pipes

Hi all
I had my Transporter checked, and the mechanic said that the long
coolant pipes under tha car were leaking. Replacement costs $1200. I
wonder if it would be possible to use reinforced plastichoses to replace
the bad parts of the pipe. Any experiences?
Thanks for many valuable and entertaining contributions.
