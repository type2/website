&gt; Having not done this myself, &quot;I don't get it&quot;.  Does the nut &quot;untwist&quot; as the
&gt; torsion of the stud springs back?  I've never seen a nut move &quot;by itself&quot;
&gt; before.

Exactly, at least in my experience.  When the final torque is reached, 
the nut will continue to turn for a little bit.  For me, after I held the 
nut at final torque for a few seconds, when I let off it, it indeed 
&quot;untwisted&quot; a bit.  I'm still wondering what to do about it.
