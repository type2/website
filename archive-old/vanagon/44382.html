Subject: RE: WTB: 73 Bus seats with headrest (Connectiuct area)

&gt;Do Vanagon front seats have the same rail spacing as breadloaf vans?  I
&gt;have some nice Vanagon front seats and I don't know whether I can market
&gt;them only to Vgoners or to some bussers.  (They are dark brown vinyl and
&gt;nearly perfect.  Also have a brown corduroy middle seat.  That one is
&gt;free to a good home.)

Bill,

I believe the 68-73 rails are the same, but then the rails change in 74.
Not sure if your vanagon seats will work on 74-79 buses, though.
