Subject: Bus titles (Was: Re: What's the Difference?)

I'm too lazy to quote from a digest right now, but I'm a little confused 
about the definition of &quot;Kombi&quot;.

I saw someone mentioned that a C/Kombi was a bus that had removeable 
seats and could function as a passenger and cargo hauler.

I own what I _think_ is a '67 Kombi.  Everything I've seen (which is 
probably not much) has led me to believe this.  My bus has 11 windows (2 
front windshields, one per door, 1 rear, and three tilt-outs on each 
side).  It came with a 'camper style' interior with a fold out bed, two 
'closets' on top of the engine hump, and a variety of fold out tables, 
storage spaces, and other such things.  It is a walk thru, and has a 
solid roof (no pop top, no sun roof).  It still has the tent/awning rail.

I've been told/led to believe that it is a Kombi.  Am I right?

Just confused,

- Erston
