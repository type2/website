Subject:       Our trip to the Canadian Rockies

Hello Everyone.  Well, our trip to the Rockies was cut short due to 
poor weather.  We like to hike, and the weather was very wet, cloudy, 
and miserable and only managed 2 hikes in 12 days.  I thought I would 
give a bit of a summary to the list.

Our route took us from Vancouver, BC to Kamloops via Hwy 1 (Fraser 
Canyon), and north on Hwy 5 (Yellowhead) to Jasper, Alberta.  From 
Jasper to Banff, Alberta via Hwy 93, and then west to Sicamous, BC 
via Hwy 1, through the Okanagan via Hwy 97, and Hwy 3 to Hope, and 
back on Hwy 1 to home.  A total of 2178 km (1353 miles).

Fuel mileage breakdown:  
High :  27.06 imperial mpg / 23.03 US mpg
Low:   20.96                         17.84 
Avg:    24.70                         21.03

My wife and I  usually do this trip every year, and never get bored with 
this trip.  A must is a stay at Mt. Robson Prov. Park.  This is about 
an hour west of Jasper, in BC.  There is an excellent campground 
there, and superb hiking available.  Mt. Robson is the highest point 
in the Canadian Rockies, and is quite spectacular.  There was fresh 
snow on it when we were there!!!  We spent 3 rainy days there, and 
then on to Jasper.  We stayed 2 days there... in the rain.  South on 
Hwy 93, just south of the Columbia Icefields at Waterfowl Lakes.  
This is an excellent campground within Banff National Park.  There 
are some nice hikes in this area... all within a few minutes drive 
from the campground.  We actually got in a nice hike to Chefren Lake. 
&gt;From Waterfowl Lake, we headed to Banff.  Stayed at Tunnel Mountain 
campground for 2 days.  It rained :(  We had a high of 11 degrees 
(centigrade), and lows of 4.  Brrr!!  All the mountains on our trip 
had fresh snow, and the squirrels were very busy.... an early winter 
this year??  From Banff, we went to our favourite spot in Glacier 
National Park.. about 3 hours west of Banff.  There is a campground 
called Illecillewaet Campground.  It's about 3 km west of the Rogers 
Pass info centre.  This place is awesome.  The campground is quite 
rustic, and awesome.  There are 7 day hikes one can do right from 
camp, and they offer very rewarding views of glaciers, and 
surrounding mountains.  It rained.  The sun did come out in between 
showers though.  

So, we cut our vacation short by 5 days and decided to go back home 
and watch the rain fall from home instead.  We should have checked 
the Farmer's Almanac first... it was right for August... rain.  
September is looking better, so we'll go back next month and try 
again.

Harry... drying out....
