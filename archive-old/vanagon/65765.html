Subject:      Tach &amp; Oil temp

Just finished putting the oil temp gauge in my 80 westy.  first attempt =
at drilling
hole in sump cover (plate under dipstick end) caused a trip to the junkya=
rd
for a new plate.  earlier post recommended not following VDO instructions=
.
I agree, do not follow stock instructions but drill the 9/16&quot; hole center=
ed to one
side of the bump in the middle of the cover plate.

Also in earlier posts oil temp was discussed.  I searched archives back =
to july
but couldn't find &quot;normal&quot; operating oil temp.  I seem to recall 210 is =
typical?

Furthermore i would like to add a tachometer.  how difficult is this and =
$$$.
Where do you get the signal from?  Do most people replace the big clock =

with a tach?

thanks.
