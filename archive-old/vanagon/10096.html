&gt; Along with the '81 vanagon I just purchased, I got a spare 2000cc engine
&gt; with fresh cylinders, pistons, and heads. It was the original engine in
&gt; the '81, has fuel injection. I'm planning on removing the f.i. and putting
&gt; a Weber on it that came with my '73, then putting this engine in the 
&gt; '73. 

Grumble grumble grumble pout pout.  I want to do that too!!!

&gt; 	 As far as I can see from both Haines and Bently, there is no cam
&gt; difference in the f.i. - carbureted engines. Right?

I hear the 77-up cam is different than the 72-76 one because of the
hydraulic lifters.  Don't know for sure, though.

&gt;    The big difference I do notice, however, is clutch size. The '81 must
&gt; have had the 228mm clutch (it does have hydraulic linkage) while the '73
&gt; has the 210mm. The manual says that the 228mm is for the hydraulic clutch,
&gt; the 215mm for the cable operated. Question 1: Will the 228 clutch be too
&gt; stiff for the cable in the '73?   Question 2: Will the 215 clutch fit the
&gt; 228 flywheel? I have to buy a new disk and pressure plate regardless, just
&gt; don't know which to go with. 

Sorry, can't help you with this one...

GO CHARGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
