 voltage regulator from VW is probably at least this much.
 
 What's the advice--keep looking for an aftermarket regulator or buy the
 whole thing? &gt;&gt;

Don -

The parts guy at the FLAPS is correct when he tells you the Voltage Regulator
is Internal.  But it is replaceable and can be done usually with a minimum of
hassle, usually without removing the alternator.  I recently did this on my
80 Vanagon because the brushes in its holder were really worn down.  Using an
inspection mirror and a light, I looked inside the alternator to see if the
surface the brushes ride on was grooved or otherwise badly worn.  Turned out
to be pretty smooth, so replacing the regulator/brush assembly turned out to
be the right thing to do.  Noticed my lights were a little brighter and turn
signal response was a little crisper.  Now if the rotor surface had been
pitted, scored or grooved, I would have replaced the alternator assembly as a
unit.

Depending on the year (and even within a given year), there are differences
in Voltage Regulators to watch out for.  Some alternators have
&quot;Rectangle-Box&quot; shaped regulators and some have slightly bulbous/rounded case
shapes.  The two are not interchangeable because of brush length.  If you
mount the one with the longer brushes into a model that takes short brushes,
premature wear will occur on both the rotor surface and brushes.  See Bentley
Page 27.20 and it shows you the different types.

We sell only the original Bosch types of these under their OE VW Numbers -

Rectangle Types:

063-903-803  Vanagon 1980 Only  $21.11
070-903-803  Vanagon 80-83  $16.91

Round Types:

068-903-803  Vanagon 80-91  $52.80

Most aftermarket varieties of these regulators (outside of Original Bosch) we
have found to be inconsistent in assembly quality and durability.  Buyer
Beware :-)

Of course, always remove the battery ground before doing this.
