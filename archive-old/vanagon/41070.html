The first problem can be solved with a synthesizer, car stereo, an AC
inverter, and a spare battery.

The only use I can think of for lead sheets would be as shielding for
something radioactive.  The only useful thing along those lines would
be a small reactor.  If you've got that, then there's no need for the
spare battery, and probably not the inverter.

That's not what you meant?  Darn.  I was hoping for some serious
pyrotechnics this time....
