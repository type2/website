Subject: Re: Re powering `82 Diesel with 1.9 Turbo
Date: Thu, 3 Jul 97 21:11:52 EDT

&gt;&gt;Been away from the list for a while, good to be back. I'm about to re
&gt;&gt;power my `82 Westy Diesel with a 1.9L Turbo Diesel. It pretty much looks
&gt;&gt;like a drop in with a few minor changes.
&gt;
&gt;Not only a few minor things, The TD is different in things you don't
&gt;think about, like the stronger crank. The cooling system will include
&gt;an additional electric water pump.

Helmut:

What's the electric water pump for?

I know that the vanagons in Europe could be had with a 1.6 TD.
Did they ever sell them with the 1.9 or 1.9TD? Why not?

I've never seen a 1.9 or a 1.9 TD here (in Rochester, NY), but I
know they were sold in Canadian Jettas. But if you get it out of
the Jetta, won't you have the same interference problem with the
turbo and the vanagon motor mount as with the 1.6 Jetta TD?
(This is, I understand, why listmembers have used Quantum manifolds)

Bob:

Where did you get the 1.9?
