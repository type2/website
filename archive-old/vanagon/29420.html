Subject: Heater cable is difficult to move 80 Vanagon Camper

Following up on the thread about the heater cable and the dashboard 
removal, I have a heater cable that I can move but it is *very* difficult 
or at least harder than I would want it to be.  Can I lube the cable?  Am
I looking at a cable replacement?  Has anyone dealt with this problem before?
