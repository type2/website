Wow, you actually own money?  I have to rent mine :-)



&gt;i will be cautious in future dealings with these folks due to their
&gt;apparent lack of organization.  just thought i'd share.  am i being
&gt;unreasonable?  i figure it's their screw-up, and i should have my $

Good luck dealing with them.

Go out and get a copy of either the Bentley manual or the Haynes
manual..they have the diagrams you need.

If not, send me your smail address, and I can send you a copy next
week when I get back to the office.
