Subject: 12-point tool

&gt; 4.  Where is a good place to get the 12 point tool for removing CV joints
&gt; with the dreaded connections?  Thanks

I've used a 6-point metric allen wrench with no problems (I think it was
6mm but it could have been 7mm). You can buy the whole set of metric
allens for under $10 or pay $12 for the one 12-point tool (and I'm only
quoting a price I heard..I don't know of a source). 

good luck! Joe ('71 campmobile)
