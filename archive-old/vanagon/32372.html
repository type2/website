Subject: /f Re: WTB Waterboxer camper or Westy


Saw this note from Robert W Taylor &lt;fsrwt1_at_aurora.alaska_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; I want to buy a camper in good condition by May 1, in the southeast, 
&gt; preferably Fla. or Ga.
&gt;

Afraid I couldn't help but notice the Alaska to Florida transition here.  
Brain just went 'pop'....

Sorry I can't help find the bus...
