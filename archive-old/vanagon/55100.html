Subject: Oil Question???


I was just wondering what grade of oil everyone puts in their VW's.  I 
have a 1980 Camper, and was wondering which grade(OR Brand) is the best.  
I've checked out the chart in the back of my VW manual, and it shows the 
best grades for different weather conditions.  Though I wanted to get the 
advice of other Vanagon owner's.
