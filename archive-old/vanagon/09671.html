Subject: RE: Porsche 6 in late bus

Sami Dakhlia opines that the taller engine compartment of the breadloaves
might could fit a Porsche 6 with the tall (CIS) induction system.  I can take
measurements if this is a decision-point for someone, but my guess is that
the Porsche FI is even taller than the VW Type 1 fan shroud, so it might still
be a problem.  

My CIS parts are all over a bench being tested.  So far the injection system
works fine except it ignores the throttle setting entirely -- just full on.
Thought of installing it that way, but a Vgon with nothing but off and 165hp
full throttle might be hard to ... shift.  So the car still has carbs for a 
few more weekends.

Let me know if you need a crank-center to airboot height measurement for the
74 to 81 range of Porsche engines before you start cutting.
