Subject: re: wierd names


&gt;I met a mechanic,   whose shingle read &quot;Marginal Mechanical Repair&quot;,  out in
&gt;the desert in California.  He said he has worked on a local bus there for 20
&gt;years, for a guy who uses it as a delivery vehicle for work,  and  clocked up
&gt;a million and a quarter miles on it.  Of course, the motor and tranny have
&gt;been replaced...
&gt;
&gt;BTW,  any other interesting repair shop names anyone has seen?  They seem
&gt;wierder in the back woods,   Why be normal and call it Dave's VW?


You mean to say you've never heard of der Botcheinwerks? A legendary
establishment run by the Botch Boys.
