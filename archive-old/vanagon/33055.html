Here's another:  

Fine-tuning the clutch adjustment on my '70.  I use a vise-grips to keep 
the cable from twisting, and occasionally forget to pop it off before my 
test-drive.  On these occasions (on my way back home), I remark &quot;hey, 
what dope left that nice pair o' pliers in the street?&quot;  This usually 
happens in front of neighbors, my SO, etc.  Natch, my face turns much 
redder than my beard.
