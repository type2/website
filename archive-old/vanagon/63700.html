Subject: Re: motor mounts

Tony,

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has had problems with the engine mounts on the
&gt; 2.1L engine? (86 westy, standard)

Just had mine replaced at about 165K.  Mechanic claimed the same 
thing...shuddering, etc.  It may be wishful thinking, but she seems 
to run a little smoother now.
