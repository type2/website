&gt;I'm considering one but have yet to find anyone who has actually
&gt;bought and used one. I'd like to hear from anyone who has, good and
&gt;bad points. Any installation or setup problems?  I know I'll have to
&gt;add larger gas line and a return line. I saw the article in either VW
&gt;Trends or Hot VW (don't remember which) but you know how those can be.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure there are others out there who would like to hear. Please
&gt;also email any reply to alternate address below since my connection

I have had on of CB Performances DFI systems installed on my engine (1835) for 
about a year now. It is based on GM's DFI system. The ECU comes from an Izusu 
(mounted under the rear seat on the drivers side) and most of the other parts 
(oxygen sensor, MAP sensor, etc.) are of GM origin. Installed it looks like 
dual Dellorto's. Cross throttle linkage, Dellorto manifolds with 2 Lucas 
injectors in each and 48mm throttle bodies topped off with Dellorto air 
cleaners. The O2 sensor is mounted in the exhaust header's collector. The 
larger gas line (1/2&quot;) comes with the kit. I removed the gas tank cover and 
pulled filler neck to tap and insert the return line. Both the return line and 
fuel line pass through the firewall with PVC fittings used as bushings.

It was, at the time, not an installation for an inexperienced or 
faint-of-heart mechanic. CB Performance was _very_ supportive at helping me 
getting it set up properly. This included an ECU exchange and many phone 
calls. Mine was the first bus installation they had done. The wiring harness 
is built to order.

It runs super strong. Mileage is about 17-18 around town 20-22 on the highway. 
And the best news is that, here in Nevada, smog checks are now a piece of 
cake. All in all I am very pleased with the set up.
