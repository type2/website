I have been a member for 3 yrs now and have been towed 400 mi by them.  
Once due to the crank splitting in two and once due to an accident.  
They've saved me over $400 plus all the maps and camping stuff i've 
gotten from them (as well as getting the keys out of my dad's car).  So 
far just the towing has paid for the 3 yr membership plus it will pay for 
the next two yrs.  Definitly a good deal.
