I don't know about the dimensions of a Honda 90, but I've carried a Vespa
P200E inside the Van, upright with no problem, all the way from Boston to
Toronto without a drop of oil hitting the carpet.  I've also carried a
Honda 550, but it had to travel at a funny angle to fit well.

I imagine that you could carry the scooter inside providing you don't have
an excess of other stuff in there.
