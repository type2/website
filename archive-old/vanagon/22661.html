     Kevin asks,
     
     &gt;Item 3: My bus is a converted 6 volt `66. That is, the lights, gen, 
     &gt;bat, and the basic assorted stuff is, but the wiper motor and the 
     &gt;infamous vdo clock are still 6 volt. I plan to snag the 12v wiper 
     &gt;assembly out of my parts 67, but am wondering what to do for the 
     &gt;clock? Are the step-down units available for wiper motors sensitive 
     &gt;enough for the clock?
     
     I built a stabilised power supply ciruit, which takes 12v and puts out 
     6v (also tuneable to any output &gt;12v) at 1.5 amps. Very stable power 
     voltage converter. I put it on a bench power supply unit and measured 
     the output then twiddled the input voltage from 6 to 20 volts up and 
     down - the output just stayed at exactly 6.00v. It cost about 9 pounds 
     to build, and I'm going to offer them to the Split-Screen Van Club 
     over here - i'd put it in a box with leads and instructions for use 
     and probably charge about 15 pounds for the unit.
     
     Lee.
