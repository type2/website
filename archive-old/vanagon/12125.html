Subject: f. Off-the wall request for Marlboro Miles

If you don't smoke Marlboro, you can stop reading now.

Anyway, a while back the discussion came up about those
hot/cold coolers that plug into your cig lighter jack.
This sounded like the greatest thing to have in my 'falia
for road trips.  In the latest Marlboro catalogue they have
one of these for X number of Marlboro Miles (the UPC codes).
One problem is that I don't smoke but I have one co-employee
saving his for me.  Another problem is that the 'cost' of this
cooler is more than one person could smoke.

So here's my strange request - if any of you who smoke and  don't
save your UPC codes, could you?  I'll be more than happy to send
you a stamped self-addressed envelope.  Thanks from a fellow
vanagon road-tripper!
