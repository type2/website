&gt;I have to agree with Steve here about the 22R engine.  My parents have a
&gt;4Runner with this engine and it is nice.  However, the one in my
&gt;parents' car has a timing chain, not a timing belt.  It's an '89.  60K+
&gt;miles and only needed a thermostat cause the old one stuck open.
&gt;It's a very good engine.  I am kinda interested to know where the
&gt;radiator is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hey,

I also agree that the 22R is a fine engine.  I have one in an '88 pickup.
The only major part it has needed in it's lifetime, was a starter.  This is 
an engine with 212,000 miles on it.  Yes, two hundred twelve thousand!  I 
did a compression test on it about 3 weeks ago and it still meets factory 
specs.  Also, I must agree with Sean, it has a timing chain, not a belt.

Now I just need someone to smash into the back of it real hard to total the 
body so I can put the engine in my bus!
