This is the blow by blow instruction I promised.

Installing a Late Model Bus gas tank into a pre '68 bus.
by Thom Fitzpatrick (thom_at_tim_dot_com)

Sometimes you need more than the 10 gallons of gas the VW factory allotted you
in your bus.  Wanna do something about it?  The later busses had 15 gallon
tanks, and with no modifications to your bus, you can put one in.  The only 
modifications you'll have to do are to the new tank and filler neck.

This same instruction set, minus the tank mods, could also be used for replacing
a gas tank with one of the same size.

First, get your hands on a later tank, 1970 or later (maybe earlier)
The later tank is deeper and taller than the early one.  Make sure that
you get the entire filler neck and hose, and cap if you can.  Also make
sure you get the little felt pads used to seat the tank on.

Then get your hands on a _new_ gas tank filler neck seal, available from
West Coast Metric or Wolfsburg West.  I stress new because your old one
is probably going to be pretty crusty, and you will need the flexibility
when you reassemble everything.

Now get your hands on 2 strips of 18 guage steel, about 1 1/2&quot; wide.  These
will be used to extend the gas tank straps in your bus to go over your 
new tank.

If you wish to use the original-style gas cap, then you will need to cut
the cap portion off of an early tank and weld it onto the later filler 
neck.  I won't go into that here.

The first modification you will need to do is remove the collar from
the late filler neck.  This is best done by taking a hack saw and carefully
cutting from the outside of the collar across to the pipe.  This gives you
a way to get the collar off.  But before you try to take the collar off,
take a chisel and hammer and CAREFULLY break the spot welds around the
collar, between the collar and pipe.  Once they are broken loose, you can
remove the collar with a pair of pliers.  If you made any holes from
popping the spot welds, now is the time to get them fixed.

DISCONNECT THE BATTERY

Remove the engine.

DISCONNECT THE BATTERY (if you didn't already)

Get a fire extingusiher handy, you never know, and you will be working 
with gas.

If you can do this operation outside, all the better.

Drain the gas tank.  If you have a means to get the gas out by suction (like 
running the engine until it runs out of gas) all the better.  Get your 
hands on a wide pan to catch any gas you missed.

Remove the two bolts on the rear of the tank (Rear is Rear of bus) and
set them aside.  Remove the fuel line.  Be prepared to catch any gas.

Remove the reserve valve/siphon tube from the bottom of the tank, and be
prepared to catch any gas.

Lift the tank and slide it out.  Go gently.  Make sure you lift it high
enough to clear the siphon nipple on the bottom.

Clean up the area behind the tank while its out.  This is your only chance!

Take you new tank and sit with it behind the bus, and orient it the way it 
will fit in there.  On the bottom of the new tank, closest to you, in the
middle, there is a raised section where the tank goes over the arch in the 
firewall in the engine compartment.  You will have to take a hammer and
flatten the bottom of the tank in that section, in order for it to clear
the firewall and to seat properly.  Once you attempt to put the tank in, it
will be real obvious what needs &quot;clearancing.&quot;  Repeat as necessary.

Its helpful to take pieces of wire and wire the tank straps to the top
of the engine compartment to get them out of your way.

If you intend to retrofit a gas guage, attach wires now to the gas tank
and tape them down so they'll be out of the way.  This will be your
last chance to run these, as you can't reach with the tank in the bus.
(I forgot to run mine :( 

Now, take your strips of steel and fashion extensions for the existing
tank straps, bolting your strap first to the bus and then bridge the gap
between the two straps.  As part of fashioning the straps you will
have had to drill holes in both ends on your new strap, to match the size
of the holes in the existing strap.

Once the tank is secure, take the flexible hose for the filler neck and
clamp it on the tank.  Tighten it good, and make sure its on far enough
to go over the barb on the filler pipe.  Now, from the outside of the
bus, pass the other piece of the filler neck thru the gas flap, and then
get back inside the engine compartment and guide it into the flex hose.
The go back outside the bus and push and twist to get it oriented the way
it looks best and does not interfere with the door.  Hint:  a little bit
of dish soap makes sliding stuff around easier!  

Put the second clamp on the hose where joins with the top  part of the filler
neck.

Once the filler neck assembly is in place, put the siphon/reserve valve
back in and hook up the fuel line.  Now is a good time to replace this
fuel line!  You also wanta a good clamp on this line.

Put in a gallon or so if gas to check for leaks, specifically in the siphon/
reserve valve and the filler assembly.  Correct as necessary.

Put the engine back in, et al, and put in 5 gallons or so of gas, slowly,
and stop every few quarts and check for leaks again.  Once you're 
happy that its not leaking, fill it up and check again.

You're done.  Enjoy the extra 50% capacity!
