&gt;Howdy,
&gt;My diesel has been overheating for the last 5 months. I can drive until 
&gt;the overheating light is on, then touch the radiator ANYWHERE with no 
&gt;fear of being burned. I can then open bleed valve and out spurts 
&gt;coolant(60%) and air(40%). After 3 or 4 minutes, the radiator is hot and 
&gt;the temperature starts to fall. But then I have to add a half gallon of 
&gt;coolant.
&gt;
&gt;During the 5 months I have: replaced waterpump, replaced then removed 
&gt;thermostat, had radiator cleaned and rodded, replaced radiator-style cap, 
&gt;flushed system (5 times), bypassed oil cooler (found oil in coolant), and 
&gt;I have bled the _stupid_ system for 30++ hours.
&gt;
&gt;What else can I do?


        When you bled the system did you have the front of the van lifted
real high(like 2-3 feet higher than the back)?

        Is the overheating proublen worse going down steep hills(a couple of
miles of 6%+ grade is often necessary to see this condition)?

        When you bypased the oil cooler did you add an aftermarket cooler in
order to dump the oil heat? (if so, how well did this work.  I am thinking
of doing the same.)

        I have found air being traped in the high hose coming off the head.
I have lowered this hose to below the throtle cable, I still have to 'pump'
the hose while adding coolant but now it will go down hill without overheating.

        I blew a cooling hose yesterday in the middle of nowhere (apx 2mi
south of Ashland, OR) so I'm no expert but I keep fighting.
