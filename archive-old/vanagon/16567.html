&gt; You might have to look around a while unless you are willing to pay
&gt; over $100 for curtain material.

Or you can look for sales and factory outlets.  The stuff I got was 54&quot; 
accross, not the normal 36&quot;.  And it was fairly heavy material for only 
$3/yard.  If David remembers the curtains I had at Red Rock, that's the 
stuff.  But I only used about 3 yards.
