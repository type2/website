Subject: Bad weekend for busses....
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 94 14:25:22 WET DST



Friday night/saturday morning. TVs stopped being watchable and so its
time to go to bed. Just got into bed when the local yobbos on their
way back from town start yelling goodnights to each other. 

&quot;See ya Scott&quot; yells the one on the other side of the road.
&quot;See ya&quot;, yells back the one beneath my window. I wish he would
bloody shut up.

CRASSHHHtinkleeeeeee.

What the hell was that? Outa bed pull back the curtains, and see this
Scott guy running off down the street, whilst the front of my bus is
covered in glass. Dressed in 30 secs and outside. The ba****d has picked
up the corner stone from the neighbours wall and thrown it through my
windscreen. By this time, he's out of sight, so its grab my leather
and crash helmet, get on my bike and try and catch him. There were
alot of people around for 2 am, but none looked like Scott.

So back home to bed....

Spent all sunday sweeping out the glass, and making a bin bag covered
cardboard windscreen to keep out the rain. In the day light it is also
obvious that the bodywork beneath the windscreen has been damaged, and
as its double skinned at that point, I suppose it will have to
be mended with body filler. The bit of wall that he used he also had to 
carry past two other cars before he got to mine, so he clearly decided
that he wanted to do the camper. All the neighbours appeared at various
times to give their opinions, including one who also saw Scott and
confirmined him to be the same guy who kicked in her car 2 months 
ago. He is obviously local, and I've got a feeling I may just wait
around for a few saturdays and see if he goes past....

And so, very knackered its of to bed, fuming quietly, I don't
think I'll be able to ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz (Sleep).


CRRRRAAASSHHHHttinkleeeeeeee

Up outa bed, yank back the curtains. The neigbhours white Vanagon
has been hit by a car, pushing it forward about five feet, into
the parked car in front of it. The right rear has been pushed right
in and the whole of the back is abit mushed. There is a new Fiesta
XR2 thing on the other side of the road, very badly damaged, but
the driver has done a runner. Ahh, a joyrider. 

I've tracked down a second hand screen for my bus, but my worry
is that this guy is going to do it again. As to the Vanagon, I don't
know whether it will survive, but one thing for sure; if you
own a bus don't bring it to Coventry, cause the locals will have
ago.
