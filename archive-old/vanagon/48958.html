Subject: 88 Vanagon - checking trans fluid?

how does one check the manual transmission fluid level on a vanagon? 
add to or change the transmission oil?  

shifting is getting notchy and read someplace that I needed to check the
transmission fluid level.  I called the local dealer, but was no help, they
said it needed to be checked by a dealer and wanted me to bring it in.
Last time I took the van into the dealer it cost $1300.  they kept replacing
parts until they finally found out what was wrong - a broken rocker arm.
