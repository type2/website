Subject: Electric vehicle page

List,
	I've always had somewhat of an interest in electric powered cars. Today
I received some spam through my university E-Mail about a project at my
school. They are trying to generate some &quot;hits&quot; to their web sight. The
more hits they get the better off they'll be with their sponsers. So if
you have some time to kill the URL is
http://www.ecgf.uakron_dot_edu/~ieee/eeev/

Visit them as many times as you like :-)
