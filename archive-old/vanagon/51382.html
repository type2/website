Subject: '84-must sell now (any suggestions?)

Hi Volks- I'm J. Trombetta and I've been recieving your helpfull info for
several weeks.  I've never written anything here, but now (unfortunately)
I'm in a crunch to sell what I can of my Vanagon.  It's an 84 with a 1.9L
4-speed stick.  I'm the 2nd owner.  The problem is the transmission is
blown and one of the studs holding the (rear driver's side) exhaust
manifold on had recently just dropped out. The engine has 105K miles on
it.  All new brakes, clutch cylinders replaced at about 90K, needs a new
oxygen sensor, a few dents in the body...  The thing is that I love this
thing, but I simply have no choice but to sell.  
  It is now sitting in Hawthorn NJ.  It must be moved by Wednesday
(11/16).  If anybody is interested in it, or parts, or anything, please
let me know ASAP.  The engine was running like new.  The trans. blew on
Monday (11/4).  Any ideas or advice will certainly be appreciated.  Thank
you.  J. Trombetta
-I will look here for info.  I can also be reached at (212)942-5525.
