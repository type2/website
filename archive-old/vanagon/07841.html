&gt; I installed the seats from an '88 Volvo 240 GL. (Were they already in when
&gt; you dropped by, David S.?) You do sit higher, but you also get used to it. Did
&gt; not have to put in a board or other interface to bolt them in, because I
&gt; could make them wide enough by inverting the &quot;feet.&quot; Cost me $100 at the
&gt; junkyard. If anyone wants to install the same seats, let me know and I'll
&gt; elaborate on how to get the tracks to be wide enough.

Yup, they were in there when I saw the bus.  Looked nice, too.  Noticeably
larger than the old ones.
