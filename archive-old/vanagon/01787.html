&gt; &gt;suck fumes !!!!!!

&gt; Ha Ha Ha  See you in my mirror, you Bunker C burner. Getting there is half 
&gt; the fun, especially in half the time! signed: Happy Hexane Guzzler  

I cruised back from camp last weekend in old-smokey. I was able to
cruise at over 65 MPH with plenty of peddle left. I could have
easily cruised at 70 MPH, but I was concerned about meeting the 
local trooper, and had no donuts in NuBus for tribute. 

So, In upstate NY, which is full of interstates, NuBus hums right
along, all 48 HP.  (And I have to drive fast so I consume Navy
Standard Crude faster than it leaks from the tank).

So question of the day: What is the Fastest you have cruised on a flat 
                        highway?

I think Joel should have room for it in &quot;The Database&quot;
