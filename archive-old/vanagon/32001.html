Unless I'm really mistaken (like that's never happened before) the front
inners and rear inners and outers on the Syncro are all the same as the
inners and outers (CV joint and boot) on all Type IIs from 1968 to 1992.  At
least when looking up part numbers from various suppliers the part numbers
are all the same.

Am I wrong?
