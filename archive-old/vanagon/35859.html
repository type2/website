Subject: re:Stickers and engine tin.

All,

Received my list stickers today, not too shabby, not too shabby.

David Schwarze(I hope I spelled that right) said he would keep an eye
out for the piece of engine tin that I am missing, I am relying on him
due to the fact he quoted me the lowest price that he saw them for. In
the mean time, since it was 98 deg. or so today, I am thinking I
shouldn't wait too long to replace this piece.  So, unless David S.
turns up the missing piece before it gets this hot everyday, I am
thinking of fabricating said piece.  What I would ask is, if someone
would measure the piece in question, left rear corner, the one that
usually gets cut for AC and such, I could really use the info.

The dimensions I think I would need are as follows:

width at both ends:
spacing of the screw holes(both from the edges, and from each other):
total length from end to end(diagonally accross, and following the curve
of the piece, inside and outside for diagonal measurement, and curve
measurement):
width of the piece at a minimum of three different spots around the
curve:

I know this is alot to ask, and I don't really expect someone to pull
the piece in question just to get the measurements. Ideally someone who
has the engine out, or the piece handy, or for some ungodly reason has
these measurements already figured.

What would be really cool is if someone could get a tracing, and fax it
to me. I could provide a fax # of someone does this.

Thanks in advance.

David
