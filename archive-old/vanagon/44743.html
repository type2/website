&gt; going to use 30 sand in hopes it will go quicker.  Totally wore out 
&gt; the ceramic tip on my blaster.  Shouldn't a tip last longer than 1 bag 
&gt; of sand?  I would welcome any advice and sandblasting tips anybody out 
&gt; there has to share.

That sounds like really bad performance.  What kind of blaster do you have?

I blasted a friend's of mine's '67 Datsun roadster's doors, hood,
front fenders and rear trunk to bare metal in about an hour, using
Kleen Blast 30-60 and ~90 psi

And I'm nowhere near wearing out the tip, even after all the blasting
I did on the barndoor.  I've probably moved 1000 pounds or more thru it
so far.
