So howard_at_aur.alcatel_dot_com says:
&gt; I know there is an idle control valve and idle stabilizer. Does either
&gt; one of these affect just cold engine idle? Is there a sensor that
&gt; is involved? I read the FAQ and replaced the coolant temperature sensor.
&gt; This didn't seem to help. In the last 5 months I've also replaced the
&gt; O2 sensor, plugs, rotor and distributor cap. Does the wiring harness
&gt; upgrade affect cold idle? How can I tell if this has been done - I'm
&gt; the third owner.

Hi Jeff,

I had the same symptoms on my '91 as you described and the idle control
valve was the culprit.  As I had this fixed at the dealer, I'm not
guaranteeing that that is what your '87's problem is.  It's just one
possibility.
