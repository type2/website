Subject: Re: Bus Boys Stole From me Saga...

&gt; Am I to conclude that Bus Boys and Bus Depot are but a change of name?  

No.

&gt; I just ordered some parts from a gentleman named Ron at Bus Depot.  He has
&gt; always been helpful with any questions I've had, whether he could sell me
&gt; the part or not.  

Ron at the Bus Depot is a good guy.  He's very busy, so things might 
be slow at times, but he comes through.  He's also an asset to the 
list, so let's be careful when making blanket statements.
