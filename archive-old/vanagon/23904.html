Subject: Re: Re[2]: 6v fuel gauge in 12v bu

&gt;     &gt;The fact that your particular set up works does not mean that the 
&gt;     &gt;above is invalid.  Do you know for sure that your sender and gauge 
&gt;     &gt;are the original 6 volt units and not replaced with 12 volt units by 
&gt;     &gt;a PO because 6 volt replacements were not available?  Maybe he lived 
&gt;     &gt;with a gas gauge that read LOW by half!
&gt;     
&gt;     I asked this question long ago. I carried out exactly the same 
&gt;     analysis of the circuit, concluding that the meter should read twice 
&gt;     as much. I know that I have the original 6v gauge and sender setup in 
&gt;     my bus and it reads just fine from 12V.

I don't know if this also applies to Split screen buses (it probably does) 
but Beetles and Bay windows have a voltage regulator that supplies the fuel 
gauge with a constant 5V. So it shouldn't make any difference weather you 
run it on 6 or 12V. 
Is there a little rectangular metal can plugged into the back of the gauge? 
That's the regulator. Try swapping it or testing it. They are not meant to 
be taken apart but I've managed to revive a few ailing ones.
