 &gt;
 &gt; Ok, this doesn't sound like the common miss that occurs after driving
 &gt;     at sustained highway speeds for awhile. that problem seems to have 
 &gt;     been cured for me, by installing the updated airflow meter
 &gt;     harness.
 &gt;
 &gt;     but, my 86' transporter seem to be suffering from this other
 &gt;     intermitant miss. it doesn't happen very ofter, but
 &gt;     when it does happen there is no missing it.
 &gt;
 &gt;      i have traced the problem, (i think) to a connection in the
 &gt;      fuse box.
 &gt;      if you remove the fuse box from under the dash.
 &gt;      will drop down a little bit and you can look at the
 &gt;      backside where numerous wiring harnesses connect.
 &gt;      the individual harnesses terminate with large multipin
 &gt;      connectors that plug into the back of the fuse box.
 &gt;
 &gt;      there is one usually colored white that is close to the 
 &gt;      center. this connector is some how related to power
 &gt;     for the FI computer or fuel pump relay power or something.
 &gt;     i havent traced with the diagram because i lent my bently book
 &gt;     to someone who has forgotten to give it back.
 &gt;
 &gt;      if you gently pull this connector off. look at the connector
 &gt;      and there a little number stamped next to each female connector
 &gt;      look at number 15. i have noticed on numerous occasions that 
 &gt;      connection number 15 some how overheats or builds up resistance
 &gt;      and caused a problem with the FI system. if there is a problem
 &gt;      with the connection the plastic surrounding pin 15 is usually
 &gt;      burned or even melted. i have had good luck with trying to clean
 &gt;      the corresponding pin that 15 connects to with on the fuse box
 &gt;      with emory cloth. but cleaning the female part of the connection
 &gt;      is really hard to do because it is so small.
 &gt;      i will later replace the connector it's self but you need a special
 &gt;      tool to remove the wires fron the inside of the connector.
 &gt;      so i'm still working on the problem.
 &gt;
 &gt;      forward this to the list if you can, because i think i 
 &gt;      sent it to you only.
 &gt;
 &gt;       i don't know if this helps or not but i figured
 &gt;       i'd throw it out to everyone.
