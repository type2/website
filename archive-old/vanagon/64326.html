 Hey guys,
 before you spend the big bucks replacing a fuel pump gummed from
 storage, try some clever tricks first....

text eliminated for brevity

 bye for now, former and again listmember- Rick Sherrod &gt;&gt;

A very special thanks to Rick for his detailed description of how to rescue a
comatose fuel pump. We have not seen the van and won't for a couple weeks. It
is about 7 hours from us and we plan to take all our tools with us when we go
up, and if it can't get rolling under its own power, put it on a dolly and
roll it home.

BTW -- It seems the fuel pump from virtually any F.I. Bus or van, Type 2,
Type 4 would fit the bill for this, as long as it could reach and sustain 32
lbs psi, and ran on 12 volts. Any thoughts or experience? I could bring a
Bosch from a '76.

thanks again
