Subject: aftermarket seats


 Has anyone installed aftermarket seats into their vanagon?
 i'm looking into installing a FLOFIT drivers seat into
 my transporter. I've received conflicting information as
 to the availability of the proper bracket, but as of today
 FloFIT says that they do make a vanagon seat bracket.
 
 i know RECARO seats are great, but they are way out of my price range
 and the FLOFITs are much more affordable, plus i have had good results
 with them in the past for replacement seats for old BMW's.

 any opinions?
 or experiences?
