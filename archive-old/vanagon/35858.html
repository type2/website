Hey all,
Regarding the flexible steering donut (that rubber thing joining the
parts of the steering column).  On my '75 bug this thing wore out on me.
I couldn't figure it out, the steering would stick when you would turn
it, i.e. it wouldn't come back to center by itself.  Close inspection of
everything revealed that the flexible steering donut was badly worn and
was hanging by a thread.  It was extremely close to breaking completely
and had it broken, I would have completely lost steering control.  Kind
of freaky to think about, I make sure to keep an eye on it now.

Sean
