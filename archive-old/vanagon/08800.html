Thanks Steve for the wonderful...and ongoing...and ongoing ...toast!

Its a good thing you weren't actually toasting while writing that..
or you would be flat out on the floor by now...or is that how
the people overthere at your place of employment designed the
Pentium??? &lt;had to get that dig in..  ;-) &gt;

Anyway, if you liked my '56 stories...stay tuned for (or at least
on Vintag) the &quot;79 (80)&quot; Cabriolet stories...

Hey folks, thanks to everyone (including Martha ...after she
said we shouldn't eat turkey for the holidays, I tried eating
some pussy, but Nigel our cat found out and hid for 72 hours..)
for making the time spent on vanagon a nice deviation (with a
bunch of deviants...or at least one deviant -&gt;Joel) from
everyday life...


I'd just like to close with a neat EuroVan experience (which
could be replicated in a Vanagon.. or any other VW bus with
a stereo (cassette or CD))...yesterday, I was driving the EuroVan
back from the hospital (visiting my wife) it was night...I was
a little down...I unwrapped the &quot;Forest Gump&quot; soundtrack..
stuck it in the stereo...cranked it up (I was alone at the
time...didn't want to blow the kids' ears out)...sat back,
relaxed...let the mind wander...

and VOILA!!! There I was...back in my old 67 Camper...back
there in the early seventies...ahhh the power of good music
and a good van!

I highly recommend this to all of you Old Farts out there who
had Vans back in those &quot;good ole&quot; days....

Ric
