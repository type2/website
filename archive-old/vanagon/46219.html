Subject: Re: VW Customer Relations &amp; reality check


Not too knowledgeable, but --

last time I was at the local dealer, the Winnebagos were still there.  They
are built on the longer EuroVan chassis.  The other local dealers *do not*
sell them (there are several dealers in the San Jose area).  The dealer in
Palo Alto seemed pretty unhappy with VW about this.  It appears that the
dealers must make arrangements with Winnebago as well as VW, and they are
limited to one dealer in an area.  The Winny conversions are not cheap
($35k?) but they look much more like the old Vanagon Westfalia than the
pictures I've seen of the *real* Westfalia conversions, and are probably
somewhat cheaper that the imported version would be.  The EuroVan was
never a good seller for VW, and I suspect most dealers did not want to
bother with the crap needed to try to sell the Winnies.  VW still calls
all of its small vans &quot;Transporters&quot;, and I'm sure they sell some stripped
model to Winnebago for the conversion.  The dealer on Stevens Creek in San
Jose was where I looked at them.  I can't get onto VW's web page right now,
it crashes NetScape on my Sun.  Sigh.
