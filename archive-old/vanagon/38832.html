Subject: Re: buying a used tranny.

I don't believe you can.  Bite the bullet and buy a remanufactured from
Transform or Mofoco that comes with a warrantee.  Why go through the hassle
of installing a trans that you might have to r&amp;r in a few thousand miles.

&gt;I was wondering how you can tell a good tranny from a bad one at a
&gt;swap meet.  At the last meet I went to there were some all painted up
&gt;purty and supposidly rebuilt.  Others were just pulled and their
&gt;sellers calimed they were in good condition.  When people want cash
&gt;only and you know you will never see them again, how do you protect
&gt;yourself?
