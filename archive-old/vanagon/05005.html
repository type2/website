&gt; Problem: The wire that operates the solenoid on the
&gt; starter apparently decays and causes this problem of
&gt; slow started - I don't see how myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Solution: Re-run this length of wire or add a starter
&gt; switch in the engine may ie. a wire that goes from the
&gt; solenoid to the battery via a switch. Use this switch
&gt; to control the starter - with the ignition on as well.

This is a common fix for ALL VWs.  When they engineered these
things they didn't take into account resistance build up over time in the
wiring, degradation of the starter solenoid, etc. I had this problem
on my Rabbit for a long time and couldn't figure it out.  Then the van
started doing it.  In talking with the dealer tech, he told me to add a
relay, a small Bosch unit in the case of the Rabbit ($15), a giant generic Ford
unit ($5) in the case of the van.  I've had 0 problems with starting either
unit since I did this.  I highly recommend this fix for anyone whose
starter is getting &quot;flaky&quot;, meaning they have to jump it with a screw
driver occasionally.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have this problem so I can't say whether it
&gt; works on not.
