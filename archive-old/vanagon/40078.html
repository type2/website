&gt;my motor is being rebuilt w/ heads from mark stephens, new bearings,

&gt;said it's up to me.  he offered the vague question that since all he was
&gt;doing (to affect balance) was putting new pistons in, why would i want
&gt;to balance things, as he's never had a problem from not doing so.  if i'm
&gt;not mistaken, things were (or should have been) originally balanced
&gt;(maybe?) w/original pistons, rods, crankshaft, flywheel(?), as a set.  so
&gt;if i'm using different pistons, wouldn't i want to have it balanced again?
&gt;am i missing the concept here?  is it something i even need to think
&gt;about?  please excuse my ignorance, illumination appreciated.

&gt;thanks, matthew

Stock parts are balanced within certain standards.  Factoiy engines have not
been balanced as an assembly for years.  The crank is balanced, the rods are
balnced, the pistons, flywheel, etc, but not as acomplete assembly.  If you
want max engine life and smoothness, then having the engine balanced is a
good idea.  Be prepared for the cost however.   zCondider though, if you need
to replace the clutch plate or flywheel, will you dissasemble the engine to
balance it again?  If not, then having it balanced now is probavly nt needed
or cost effective.
