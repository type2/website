&gt; 
&gt; I finally did it.  Add me to the stats ...
&gt; 87 Vanagon GL, with weekender package, ac, excellent condition, 105K, for
&gt; 4750$.
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks to those of you who have responded to my sporadic requests over
&gt; the past six months.  (And thanks in advance for all the help that I will
&gt; surely need in the future).
