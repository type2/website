how hard is it to install a headliner?  the liner in my bus (73) was
ruined by water leaking from the sliding-roof. i had to rip it out and
would like to replace it.  it seems like every one and their dog makes
headliners. who makes good ones? what are the tricks to installing them?
is it really something i want to do myself? i would like to do as much as
posible. anyone out there done it?

bye
