&gt; Subject: Car Talk's survey
&gt; On the Car Talk Web site (home of Click and Clack), they've got a survey
&gt; running where they're collecting info about the car you drive as well as
&gt; info about you.  These guys are fairly anti-vwbus and here's our opportunity
&gt; to skew some results.  But more interesting is that the survey also asks
&gt; lots of  personality questions with the goal of establishing some sort of
&gt; real analysis along the lines of &quot;you are what you drive&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; If we all take the survey then, since the entire VW bus/van internet
&gt; community is probably on this list already, the results really become
&gt; a statement about us!  I encourage everyone to take the survey.
&gt;
&gt; And, its a really fun web site (imo).

&gt;
I just filled out the survey, for my '67 &quot;vanagon&quot;. They didn't even have a
category for bus. Anyway, I did my civil duty as a bus owner, and heartily
recommend that everyone else who has a chance do the same. Let's show 'em!

(I can't wait for the results!)
