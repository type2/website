Subject: Re: removing syncro tranny drain plug

&gt;I was thinking that if you sawed off a 1 inch piece of allen head wrench and
&gt;jammed it into the drail plug on the tranny, then perhaps it would fit
&gt;without your having to remove the skid plate. Then, you could turn that
&gt;allen head with a wrench that just might fit in the space between the skid
&gt;plate and the tranny.

I have a 17mm allen head &quot;socket&quot; for a 3/8&quot; drive. It's short enough
(barely) to fit between the skid plate and the tranny and slip into the
drain plug. Can't use the ratchet, but a 17mm wrench will turn it. It's
still tedious but I was able to drain my tranny this way without
removing the skid plate.
