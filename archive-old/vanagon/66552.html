&gt; available through Volkswagen.


For the record, I DO sell these hoses (and ALL other &quot;dealer-only&quot; VW
parts), at roughly 15% off the dealer's price (or cheaper if I can find an
alternate importing source).  Jim Thompson is right that many of the hoses
are not carried by the independent importers, but I have a &quot;Volkswagen
connection.&quot;  Because of my time limitations, it is greatly appreciated
(but not required) if you can provide the VW part number on any &quot;dealer
only&quot; parts you need (from the dealer, or right off your old part), as it's
very time consuming to look up in the microfiche, and the markup on this
stuff is pitifully low in the first place. (True, some &quot;dealer only&quot; parts
can be more than a bit pricy, but it's VW themselves making most of that
money, not me or even your local dealer.)

It was very generous of Jim to go to the trouble of providing this hose
part number information on his website, especially considering that these
are parts that he doesn't sell.   I'm sure that it will be of great value
to the List, and greatly appreciated.
