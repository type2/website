Subject: cleaning out the garage - free heater boxes!


Well we didn't go away this holiday weekend and consequently I'm
tidying/cleaning out the messy garage from hell. I pushed the old '72
westy out into the driveway. Sat in it for awhile, boy is it different from
the vanagon! Lots of good memories in that old thing. BTW we have decided to
keep the '72, I'm going to get it back on the road in August.

Anyhow... once the van was out of the way I could get at alot of junk. In
that junk were a pair of heater boxes left by the previous occupant. They
seem to be in pretty good shape, quite heavy, one has oil and grit on it
from a leaky valve cover gasket I guess. I don't know if they are from a
bug or upright engine bus, (where are the serial numbers stamped on the
heat exchangers?)

They are up for grabs, free! Holiday weekend special!
