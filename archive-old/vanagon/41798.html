Subject: Hatch Struts for 85 Vanagon
Date: Fri, 10 May 1996 23:36:41 GMT

As I said several days (weeks?) ago, I am letting the list members
know how things went with my rear hatch struts that I bought from
Imparts for my 85 Vanagon...

The person I talked to on the phone the day I ordered my struts
assured me that the struts I was ordering were not Suspander Struts,
but were original OEM struts manufactured in Germany. I went on and
ordered the struts with that assurance. About a week later the struts
came via UPS and I eagerly tore the box open to discover that one was
a Suspander Aut-Fit and the other was a Hydro-Lift.  Needless to say,
I was a bit disappointed (and a little angry) when I discovered that I
had been lied to, but decided to try the struts on the Van anyway. I
mounted them the next morning, and noted that the Suspander one seemed
to leak a little oil up the strut rod the first time I closed the
hatch, but seemed to be working ok. It doesn't seem to be leaking at
all now (two days later), but I am keeping the shipping invoice from
Imparts just in case it fails prematurely.

As to my general impression of Imparts. I got my parts in a timely
manner, but don't know if I will order from them again because of my
asking if the Struts were Suspander, them telling me they were not,
and then sending me a Suspander Strut in my order.
