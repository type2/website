Subject: Power Window

Allow me to introduce 'Old Blue', a 1990 Vanagon, dark blue in color, true blue
in dependability.  She has 60k with only dropping two water pumps since new.
But alas, now a new frustrating problem has arisen...the drivers side power win-
dow has stuck up and in checking, it appears the motor has died.  Now the hard
part-I can't seem to remove it.  After removing the 3 screws, I found a cable 
attached to it and  cannot detach this cable from the motor.   I checked the 
FLAPS and dealer (for $300 I'll fix it) and so far no advice...looked in 
Chilton's and no mention of power window...If anybody out there knows the 
trick  PPPLLLLEEEAAAAASSSSSEEEE HELP!!!  E-mail directly or to the group...
a photocopy of info to P.O. Box 207 Belleville, Il 62222 would really be 
appreciated, of course reimbursement of expenses incurred would follow...
I enjoy the list and I am a newbie to the net...please excuse any and all
infractions I may have commited         
                                     Thanx much!!!
