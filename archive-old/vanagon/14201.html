fair enuf

i knew i was taking a bit of a gamble on who was the originator of the idea
on rhubarb leaves. Re. all that blood, gore nausea etc. on using rhubarb
leaves, couldn't you just wear a pair of rubber gloves, what do you do andy
e.?

&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond'
&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;suggest using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly
&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;toxic (it is for this reason that you don't compost them)
&gt;
&gt;     hey wasn't me guv,
&gt;
&gt;     I just use autosol and leave the rhubarb for rhubarb crumble and
&gt;     custard :)
&gt;
