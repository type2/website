Subject: Re: Handbreak cable

If any one wants or needs to know how to intsall a handbrake cable for a 
Vanagon, I just did it and it isn't as it easy as you would think. The 
gas tank must be lowered by at least six inches prior to removal and 
installationof the cable. Ask for details if need be - DC
