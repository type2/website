Subject: FAQ construction:  Tires

Howdy,

I'm going to build the FAQ one part at a time, by asking the mailing list to
send me submissions.  I'll edit these into a cohesive FAQ.

The current section is TIRES.  Specifically, these questions keep coming up:

     1)  What tires are recommended?

         I'll do this by polling.  Send me what YOU would recommend,
         and I'll list all recommended tires.  Include wheel size.  If
         you're recommending for a syncro, note that.

     2)  What wheels will work with the Vanagon?

         I recently heard that there is a porche wheel that will work.
         Does anyone have details?

     3)  Where do you get cheap tires?

         Specifically, are there mail-order places that you would
         recommend?
