Subject: Re: 71' bus type vehicle

hmmm....well... I took a close look at it today and am not to sure about 
the deal.  I has many little dings, needs a back window.  Has some rust 
starting off pretty good near the rear taillight, as well as on the 
corner of both the passenger side and driver side floor pan.  Actually, 
it has rusted through completly, about the size of my fist.  No 
headliner, ripped seats... starting to sound like alot of work to be done 
here.  I talked with the shop that rebuilt the engine, and the owner used 
to own the bus, he said the bore from 16 to 1776 was done about 9 years 
ago.  All this, for $600.  I could fix it up and dump an unknown amount 
of cash into it, or buy one in better shape for probably close to the 
same or less..  I'm not to sure..  went and looked at a '73 with a 1500cc 
with 1000miles on it, as well as headers and a beefed intake.  Its sounds 
like a good runner, but isnt beautiful.  Wants $1850 for that one.. 
probably offer $1400.  God, all I want is a bus that runs good, and looks 
halfway decent.  hmmmmm...
