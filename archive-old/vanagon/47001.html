Bentley has a section on how to fix &quot;hot footwells&quot;.  Has anyone done the
procedure?

 &gt;&lt;&lt; My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is a
 &gt; noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the dash.
 &gt; I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of the heater
 &gt; controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in mid
 &gt; summer.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Is this a common problem? What's the diagnosis and what's the fix?
 &gt;  &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;I've noticed this same problem on my '84 Camper!
