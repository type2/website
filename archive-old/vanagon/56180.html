Subject: Photovoltaics, aux. battery, evaporative cooler

Finally have the superlative '91 Syncro Westy, fulfilling my long-term dream
of ading an auxilliary battery with photovoltaic back-up for running and
charging. This vehicle is now the snazziest camper I know!

Installed a 105 amp hour deep cycle battery (on the floor in cabinet under
sink) and a marine switch (also in same cabinet) which allows all loads to
be drawn from either or both batteries, and for either or both to be charged
by driving or by the 40 watt solar photovoltaic panel.  The PV panel is self
regulating, thereby preventing overcharge of batteries, and is NOT mounted
outside the vehicle.  It will sit on dashboard when van is stationary
(facing south) or, being on a 25 ft. lead with cigarette plug end, can be
placed outside propped up toward sun when camping in shade.  

There's a hard-wired triple cigarette plug with 15 amp in-line fuse, into
which is connected an evaporative cooler, which can cool the air when van is
stationary.  (This only works well in dry climates!)  I also plan to charge
a cell phone and laptop computer (with inverter) on these, and maybe grind a
few expresso beans..........

Still have to check voltage of the deep cell with engine running to make
sure it won't overcharge.

Unfortunate occurance was a punctured low pressure hose from the AC system,
resulting in sore throats and sorer pocket, to the tune of $15 to repair
hose, and $140 to evacuate and recharge system!

Second, less serious result was a totally whacked out Viper alarm system
which simp[ly had to be completely reprogrammed and now works just fine.

Any feedback, comments, glitches to watch out for, etc. would be appreciated. 
Also, let me know if you want the name of the friend who installed this for
me, and who makes the coolers in all sizes as well as other solar devices
and evaporative cooling towers for buildings.

Tomorrow I'm off to Mexico! but with my handy dandy system and laptop, I'll
be able to keep in touch with the ever-precious list!

Thanks to all the folks who sent tips re: '91 won't start.  The problem
never happened again, so I guess it was bad gas or vapor lock.
