    I was reading the November issue of Car and Driver at a doctor's office
last night, and they mentioned a new 4 cylinder diesel with a TDI designation.
I think it is being used in the Golf, and they drove a Jetta with one in it.
It's 90 HP and I think 2 liters, is almost as quiet as a gas engine and
doesn't have the normal billowing clouds of diesel fumes. In four or five
years, when these are being discarded for the latest and greatest, they may be
an option for our Vanagons. 
    Anyone know any more about them?
