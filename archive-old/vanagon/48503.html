Subject:      Re: ABS on your 1991 Vanagon??

&gt;So Harry Yates says:
&gt;&gt; Percent of consumers who &quot;believe&quot; they have ABS on their 1991
&gt;&gt; model-year vehicles -- but do NOT
&gt;&gt; Volkswagen Vanagon 92%

this is typical of the garbage spouted by the sales-scum people ... they
don't know the difference between &quot;dual-circuit brakes&quot; and &quot;anti-lock
brakes&quot;.  i've had TWO dealer salespeople tell me over the years that the
Vanagon on their lot had ABS. they seemed offended that i knew more about
the car than they did ... or that i had caught them in one of their lies.

they'll tell people ANYTHING to sell a car.
