Subject: RE: SAN DIEGO ANYONE? HELP?


&gt;Is anyone living in or near the San Diego area who could take a look at
&gt;a 61 23 window for me?


I'll have a look if you like. And I'll even promise not to buy it
out from under you-- I've got enough car problems as is (see post
&quot;V6anagon un-V6'ed&quot;). I'm not a master mechanic by any means, but
I can generally notice rust holes, smoke, two-speed trannies, etc.
