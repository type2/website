So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; These tubes can actually be stretched back to their original length (Muir
&gt; describes the procedure). Better yet is to buy new ones with NEW seals of
&gt; course. DC -- 
&gt; 

I think the Muir stretching method for push-rod tubes was meant only for 
the earlier Type I tubes that have the accordian type ends on them and
not for the later Type IV engine tubes that are one solid piece.
