ahhhh.  that's the best part.  see, without coffee grounds left in
your cup, you have nothing to read your future with.  that's why so
many Americans are floundering in today's society-- they use drip
filters that don't leave any grounds for predicting futures,
truth-saying, and other psychic affairs. 

my dear departed aunt would &quot;read&quot; peoples' grounds, including us 8
year olds who would force down a cup of the acrid drink just to 
gather around her and have our futures predicted.  it was all in good 
fun but she did have an uncanny ability to &quot;read&quot; things, people more 
than anything.  but few people have aunts anymore that do such 
things.  it gets back to the lack of grounds....
