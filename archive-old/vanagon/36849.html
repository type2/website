&gt; What do you do to get the dreaded zooning police off your back?
&gt; Several of my neighbours and I have had trouble with them lately.
&gt; The stupid regulations have forced me to pass on several vw busses
&gt; in need of a loving home. My neighbor on the opposite side of the
&gt; street had his Triumph TR6 towed, and another neighbor had two cars
&gt; towed and even got sued by the town.
&gt; 
&gt; I can afford registration, but I cannot afford to insure them,
&gt; and NY laws says registered cars have to be insured (or they'll
&gt; suspend my licence).

I saw a guy in the Bronx who restored vw's, and he had at least eight on 
the street, all registered, all insured...  The trick was that he 
insured with some company in Penn, and insured them as Show Vehicles, at 
about $80 each a yea.. there is a milage restriction, and a who bunch of 
hooey, but it worked.
