Do you know the asking prices? I'm not ready to buy now,
but I'm likely to move to Europe after the summer, and would be 
in the market for one unless I'm able to bring my Westy diesel
from the US. (Difficult due to regulation I imagine)

Not really, it depends if you want to stay for a longer period or just a few 
weeks. If you come as a tourist you cann keep your US license plates. May be 
you need additional coverage for insurance.

If you import the car to here, you need to have a certificate of the KBA 
(something like DOT) that the car has never been registered as stolen and a 
certification from VW Kundendienst that according to the VIN the car fulfils 
the local regulations. Than it has to be examined by the TUV (see VANAGON_dot_com 
dictionary) and off you go. 

That's the whole show for germany - other countries maybe different of course.
