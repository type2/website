Subject: Syncro Oettinger 6 cylinders 3.2 liters wasserboxer 

Hi Syncro addicts,

I've just got a German magazine where this very very rare Syncro is on sale.
Too bad I don't have enough money to get it!! It's really my dream car!!
It's a '86 Vanagon. Seems to be in very good condition regarding to the
picture. I can't say if it got square headlights or round, photo is taken
from the rear.
It's got alloys, A/C, PS, front and rear diff locks, 7 seats, but the master
piece is the engine : 3.2 liters in a 6 cyl. wasserboxer called WBX2. It's
not a Porsche Carrera. This engine was built especially by Oettinger for the
Vanagon. 140 horses. Is that enough? Max torque is huge but I don't know
exactly how much. I think there is enough torque at low revs for off road
use. What a great van it should be... I forgot to tell, manual gearbox get 6
gears and top speed is 120 mph. Good enough for US highways, unh? Mileage is
80 k miles. Unfortunately, it's not a 16&quot; wheeler. Oh well... Problem is
that this van is in Germany...
Price new was around $68,000 and it's sold now for about $18,000.
If you need more infos you can e-mail me directly.
