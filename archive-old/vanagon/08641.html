&gt; I haven't heard of this.  The only thing I heard was that #3 was retarded

&gt; I've read the same thing about #3 being retarded slightly by the distributor.
  The explanation I remember was that it was done to prevent pinging and
  detonation of that cylinder (due to overheating) because it was evident 
  that it ran hotter than the others.
