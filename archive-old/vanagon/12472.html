Subject: Why don't AT's have a drain plug?

Can someone give me a good explaination as to why Vanagon (and other) 
automatic transmissions dont have a drain plug. Seems it would be a lot 
easier to change fluid than dropping the whole pan off and have less of 
an environmental impact (gee you should see my garage floor).	

What about drilling a hole in the AT pan at the lowest point, welding a 
big nut on it and installing a drain plug?
