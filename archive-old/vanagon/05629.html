Subject: Fogg Lamp Wiring

I wired my factory fogg lamp switch so in the first (middle) position the
fogg lamps come on when and only when the low beams are on. In the third
(right) position the fogg lamps come on no matter what so long as the key is
on. Technically, this is illegal as it allows me to have the fogg lamps on
coincident with the high beams. That is a no-no.
