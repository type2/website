Mark, East Side's in Bells Corners is in the plaza on the corner of
Richmond Road &amp; Stafford.    We're three so far, D Carment can't make it,
he's away.  Haven't heard from others yet.  So maybe we choose another date
or do it again another time.  Time ?  6 or 7 pm would be good with me ?? 
Let's see if we get more input from other Ottawaians.

Cheers  

Frank
