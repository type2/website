Subject: new clutch

I was wondering if anyone in the northeast area has recently gotten a new
clutch. My 78 Bus needs one bad (my 1st VW) and I am shopping around for
the best price. The best price that I got so far was $550.00 for everything
and the guy only needs it for one day (everyone else was 2-4 days. Any info
would be appreciated. Thanks.
