&gt; &gt;           VW/AUDI list              Prices good while supply lasts.
&gt; &gt;              v2.0                   Most v1.0 prices still good.
&gt; 
&gt; I got the list a few minutes ago myself.  I don't know how Joel got on it since
&gt; you have to send in your name and e-mail address.  I know that Wolfsport is
&gt; legitimate because I have ordered stuff from them several times for my GTI.
&gt; I don't know anything about German Auto.
&gt; 

German Auto Salvage is real.  They're just down the road from where
I work.  I've called them a few times about used parts, but all they do
with the wrecks they buy is strip them and then send them off to the
crusher.  Unfortunately, that means that lots of good stuff goes to waste
since they're not apt to save doors, rear hatches, engine hatches, and
other stuff (like hubcaps).

I think their main focus is Mercedes/Audi/BMW, anyway.
