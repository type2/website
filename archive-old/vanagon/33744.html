&gt;The term 'bulletproof' ....
&gt;
&gt;As for Volkswagen content, the bulletproof design is spelled T-U-B-E.  If you
&gt;plan to go off pavement, run tubes in your tires.  You can patch a tube,
&gt;drive on.  Tubeless tires can kill you.  Try pumping up a tubeless tire down
&gt;in Baja -- or the Yukon -- with your 12v air-compressor.

Hence the term, Aorta borealis, a medical condition where the heart explodes
from overexertion related to pumping up tubeless tires.

Sorry,

Bob
