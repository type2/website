Subject: RE:  Waterboxer Heater Blower Motors Query

Several months ago there was a thread on waterboxer front heater blower 
motors.  One individual recommended that the motor could be rebuilt by 
installing new bushings and brushes.  I totally agree with the theory - 
but have be unable to locate a source for either the bushings or the 
brushes.  Questions:

1.	Has anyone on the list located a source for these parts.? 	
	(Please respond with source name, address, P/N's and prices.)
2.	Could someone detail the procedure for r&amp;r the blower motor? 
3.	Has someone found a reasonable source ($) for replacements 
	blower motors. (name, address, P/N and prices.) 

My recollections are that the motor is the same unit in both 
the Vanagon and the rabbit.  I recall replacing one several years 
ago in a Rabbit for around $100.00.  Seems a bit stiff.

I'd appreciate replies directly, and will summarize pertinent information 
for the list when I receive it.

Thanks,

Fred
