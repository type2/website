&gt;the lock of my sliding door is broken so I have to renew it. I only want a
&gt;new lock for my existing key. But there is a bit of trouble.
&gt;This small tag which is attached at one of the keys says &quot;VB 8767&quot;, but my
&gt;dealer stated that this key number is not a vanagon key number.
&gt;Does anybody know the exact sytematics for these numbers?

the key number is on the lock, not the key. you'll have to take the lock out
of the sliding door and get the number off of it. i don't have the tech
bulletin here with me, but i think it is on the inside faces of the lock.

now, that ONLY gets you the key blank ... that is, the type of key that will
fit into the lock. it does NOT give you anything about the &quot;cuts&quot; on the key.
for that, i think you have to have the new cylinder &quot;re-keyed&quot; to match the
old cylinder. possibly a job for a locksmith (as i think those parts are
very tiny and easily lost).
