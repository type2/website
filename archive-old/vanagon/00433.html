Subject: Auxillary battery - stock setup?
Date: Tue, 19 Apr 1994 21:51:04 -0500 (EST)

All this chat about 2nd batteries, etc brought up a question I've had for
sometime.  Actually, 2......

First let me say I have a 76 camper van.  2.0 L, and I don't know much about it
(yet)

As far as the second battery, hooked up to the fridge and 110 AC outlet,
How was it originally wired?  How should I wire it?

Here is a diragram of my hypothesis to the original setup:

external      |     |      battery    ???????????????????????????
110 V AC-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;|power|-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;charger
supply        |     |        |                                     alternator
              |inver|        V      &lt;-&lt;-regulator?&lt;-&lt;-isolator&lt;-&lt;-&lt;   or
inside        | ter |      2nd                                     1st battery
110 V AC&lt;-&lt;-&lt;-|     |&lt;-&lt;-&lt;-12V Dc                                       ?
outlet        |     |      Battery  ??????????????????????????????
                             |
                             V
                            fridge

The stuff in ? is what I am unsure about.  I couldn't find any such wiring.

For the second question, I must point out that I would like to road trip this
summer (thus driving nearly every day), use the fridge, and Maybe use the
internal 110V outlet.  I'd really like if I never had to plug in.
My plan for doing this was to wire it as diagramed above (if it isn't that way
already), and add a solar panel.  I could get one that is 70 watt output.
Is this a really weird idea, or does it have potential?  My logic is that when
the fridge needs power, it is sunny out.  The sticker on the fridge says 
&quot;12 V 5.4 Amp&quot; thus about 64 watts.  How does all this work out???

Confused-
