Gee, kids, a thousand apologies...  I'm sorry I wasn't able to get the 
Report up to the list yesterday, but I couldn't even connect to the 
Freenet machine until this afternoon!  Sorry again for the delay.  When I 
get rich I'll get an account through a commercial ISP, but until then 
I'll have to live with what I have now...

          Part VI: New Orleans, and up the Mississippi


In this week's Big Trip report bit, Tobin and Christa hang out in 
New Orleans as Mardi Gras starts getting frantic, then decide to 
make a pilgimage to the King.  This week's bit starts with Tobin 
and Christa in an RV park in New Orleans, snoozing cozy in their 
westy after making a fine East Indian meal...

February 16, 1995
  
We'd wanted to hop out of bed early the next morning and start 
exploring New Orleans.  Despite out best intentions, it was well 
past dawn when we finally started to stir.  It was cool, cloudy, 
and threatening to rain, but our spirits were untempered.  Christa 
had been looking forward to New Orleans since before we started 
our trip (I was too, but I'd visited a year or so earlier when I 
gave a paper at a conference, so I had some idea of what to 
expect).

On our way back from the showers, we finally met our neighbours, 
Tom and Anna.  (Remember, we'd chosen our parking spot because we 
liked the look of their sagging, beat, old Dodge camper).  Tom had 
long dread-locked blond hair and a crazy beard, and Anna had 
longer brown hair and a devious laugh.  We liked them on sight.  
Anna was in a band, and Tom was a... marketing consultant?  Could 
that be right?  He assured us it was, and switched into his Mr. 
Business-guy voice just to prove it.  We all killed ourselves 
laughing.

The four of us decided to take the city bus together into town.  
Christa and I headed up to the gate of the RV park to find out 
what bus to take to get to the French Quarter, and Tom and Anna 
tried to get organized enough to leave, including finding and 
packing appropriate &quot;supplies&quot; for the trip.  Half an hour later 
found us waiting at the bus stop, and ten minutes after that we 
were on the bus, and heading into town.

Almost as soon as we got on board, the skies decided that, yes, it 
did have to rain, and it pelted heavy rain for almost all of the 
15 minute trip to Canal street downtown, where we got off.  
Considering that none off us had brought a jacket, it was good 
that it stopped raining a minute or so before we had to get off.  

We split up from Tom and Anna once we got downtown, and agreed to 
meet with them that evening at a spot in the French Quarter.  
Christa and I walked into the Quarter and checked stuff out, but 
it was still early in the day and nothing was happening, so we 
made note of who was playing where, and meandered towards the 
river.  At a New Orleans Information booth downtown, we asked what 
the significance of purple, gold, and green as the Mardi Gras 
colours was.  We stumped the information person with that one.  At 
least they don't have a Lone Star in the Mardi Gras logo!

Always interested in trying the local foods, we had Po' Boys 
(fried oysters or fried shrimp packed between two slices of French 
bread) and some local beers at a place called Mulate's near the 
river, then headed over to check out the older homes in the Garden 
district, a short streetcar ride away.  

We spent a good couple of hours doing an informal walking tour of 
the neighbourhood and its beautiful old homes.  It was starting 
to get dusky when a woman in a pick-up who was stopped at a stop 
sign rolled down her window and asked, &quot;You're tourists, aren't 
you?&quot;  &quot;Um, yeah,&quot; we replied, wondering whether it was the maps, 
the walking tour pamphlet, the camera, or the Canadian flag 
hanging off our back-pack that tipped her off.  She paused a 
second then using the kind of voice that people use when they 
don't want to alarm you said, &quot;Well, I thought I should tell you that 
this neighbourhood is unsafe at night.  You should probably leave 
now,&quot; as she rolled up her window and gunned it out of there.  So 
we were left standing alone on the street corner, watching her 
truck disappear down the street and feeling, well, alarmed.  We 
walked quickly (but with what we hoped looked looked like 
confidence) back to the streetcar line and hopped a car back to 
the French Quarter.  Dumb Canadians and scary American cities 
don't mix.  What would we have done if some one had started 
shooting at us?  Pelt them with back bacon?

It was nearly dark by the time we made it to Bourbon street, and 
things were slowly starting to come to life.  I decided I'd get 
things rolling by having a few Hurricanes and working away at them 
as we wandered up and down the street.  Most of the street was 
pretty touristy, with tons of places to buy souvenir T-shirts and 
junk like that.  I'm still kicking myself for not buying the 
Patron Saint of Television Catholic icon at the House of Voodoo 
(no joke, this is a real Catholic saint declared by the Pope in 
something like 1957). The strip clubs were an interesting change 
from the souvenir shops, but looked like corny rip-offs.  I had a 
particularly good laugh over the the place with signs that 
screamed &quot;ORGY!!&quot; with photos of lots of limbs and the backs of 
people's heads to support their claim.  It actually looked pretty 
lame, so we gave it a pass.  

Most of the music blasting out of the bars was a bland mix of R&amp;B 
and standard rock covers, but we did hit a couple of places with 
good blues, and of course we had to take in a set at Preservation 
Hall, worth the trip for the ambience alone, in my opinion.  We'd 
been sampling the local food and drink most of the afternoon and 
evening, so when Tom and Anna didn't show up at our meeting place 
at the appointed time, we decided to take one more walk around the 
area before heading back to the camper.  Our 'one more walk' took 
us through until after midnight, and we had to run through dark 
deserted streets away from the continuing festivities in the 
French Quarter to get to where we had to catch the bus back.  We 
got to the bus stop with a few minutes to spare, and when we 
arrived back at our camper a little after one in the morning, we 
wasted no time in climbing into bed and falling into a deep, 
contented sleep.

We managed to get only a couple of hours of solid sleep  that 
night because about three in the morning we were both wakened by the 
sound of approaching thunder.  We could hear it closing in on us 
from one thunder clap to the next, and soon the inside of the van 
was lit up in brilliant white flashes as lightning discharged 
around us every few seconds.  Christa and I lay warm in our bed, 
curled up as the skies let loose an instantaneous downpour that 
roared on the roof of the pop-top and beat against the sides of 
the car.  We could hear large lightning bolts striking very close, 
and the duration between the flash and the thunder often 
approached zero.  I got up to quickly check that the windows were 
rolled up and that we were reasonably water-tight.  The storm 
continued around us: flashBANG!! as the centre of the storm passed 
right over us and continued past.  Finally, the rain petered out 
and the thunder disappeared in the distance just as the sky 
started warming for the start of a new day.  

We slept for another hour or two, then slowly started to stir and 
began the negotiations for who would get out of bed first and put 
the water for tea on.  As usual, I lost, but I had a chance to 
look around us while the water was coming to a boil.  Looking out 
the window, it looked like nearly half the RV park was under 
water, and we were parked in a muddy, gravelly spot in at least an 
inch of water.  By the time we'd had our tea and breakfast, the 
standing water left by the storm had receded substantially, and we 
were able to walk to the showers without wading through water.  On 
the way back, we ran into Tom and Anna, who we'd missed the night 
before.  Tom had taken sick early in the day, so they were unable 
to meet with us, but he was feeling better by the morning.  We 
made plans to go to a Mardi Gras parade that evening.

Christa and I spent the entire day searching for poster I had seen 
at the New Orleans airport when I had flown in for a conference a 
year or so earlier.  We had absolutely no luck at all finding a 
copy, and almost all the people we talked to didn't even know the 
poster I was talking about.  We even went to the airport, but they 
had changed the poster displays, so it was no longer there.  It 
kept raining off and on all day, the traffic was terrible, and the 
search took all day and didn't even turn up a solid lead, so I was 
pretty annoyed by the time we pulled in next to Tom and Anna that 
evening.

We took the advice of Charlie, the gate keeper at the RV park, and 
picked us up a &quot;bag of boiled&quot; at Whitey's, a local bar filled 
with lots of fat white guys friendily yelling at each other 
because the place was so loud (what with it being crowded with 
people yelling at each other), slapping each other on the back, 
and driving big pick-ups and rusted Monte Carlos in and out of the 
parking lot.  A 'bag of boiled' was a 6 pound clear plastic bag of 
'crawdads' (crawfish) boiled in the shell in cajun-spiced water.  
They looked terrific, so we took our bag of boiled straight back 
to the RV park, got out the table and a few beers, and spent the 
next half hour gorging on some of the best shrimp we'd ever had.  
I was still sad about not finding my &quot;The day the animals took the 
streetcar&quot; poster, but at least I wasn't annoyed and irritable 
anymore.

After dark, Tom and Anna came over, and we made figured out where 
the parades were, and how to get to them.  The four of us piled 
into the camper, and we headed out to one of the 'burbs where the 
parade was.  After a half hour of driving around, we discovered 
the parade had been cancelled because of the rain earlier in the 
day!  So we huddled around the maps again, and drove to the other 
side of town and parked next to another parade route.  We arrived 
nearly an hour early, and it was still a little chilly outside, so 
we stayed in the camper, had a few beers and a long discussion 
with Bob.  I sat out of the discussion because I had to drive us 
all back later.  That notwithstanding, we were all properly 
prepared to appreciate the full spectacle of the parade when we 
saw it coming down the road.

The parade took over an hour to roll by us, and the whole time all 
the spectators engaged in vicious competition for the trinkets and 
strings of beads thrown by the people on the floats.  Christa did 
very well for herself, and by the end of the parade she was loaded 
down with beads--and lots of the really nice ones, too.  When we 
got back to the camper, we made sure to include the camper in the 
fun, and wound three strings of Mardi Gras beads (purple, gold, 
and green) around the radio antenna.  It looked very festive.  To 
this day, our camper proudly carries its Mardi Gras beads up front 
for everyone to see.

We had planned to continue east along the Gulf coast for a while 
longer before heading north, but when we were looking at the road 
atlas that night in preparation to leave the next day, Christa 
turned to me and said, &quot;Gee, Memphis isn't that far from here!&quot;  I 
looked and said, &quot;Well, it's not exactly next door!&quot;  Christa sat 
for a second and asked, &quot;Isn't Memphis where Graceland is?&quot;  We 
both sat for a second running Paul Simon lyrics quickly through 
our heads.  Indeed it was, and from our interpretation it sounded 
like his trip is the song was in the same direction as the route 
we'd take, because early on he remarks that: &quot;The Mississippi 
delta was shining like a National guitar.&quot;  Cool.

I didn't see any obvious secondary highways that could lead us 
fairly directly to Memphis, so the next morning found us cruising 
west on I-10 then north up I-55 along elevated freeways that 
hovered 10 or 15 feet above the waters of the Louisiana bayous for 
miles and miles as we circled Lake Pontchartrain.  Traffic blew by 
us in left lane, and we cruised steadily down the right lane at 57 
mph.  As we neared the Mississippi state line, the land rose 
slightly and began to roll pleasantly.  We pulled off at the 
Mississippi Welcome Center and they gave me free Coke!  I thought 
this was pretty cool.  We'd come in for maps and stuff, and walked 
with all that and a Coke!  It's weird how simple pleasures take on 
a new significance on long trips.

After another hour and a half of Interstate highway driving, I 
could take no more.  I could see all the beautiful country passing 
us by, but we couldn't really experience any of it from the 
confines of the freeway.  I pulled off near Crystal Springs, and 
headed west and north on small highways.  I quickly came to the 
realization that the State of Mississippi is not exactly consistent 
in marking highway numbers or providing directions at the 
junctions of major roads.  I wanted to drive for a while on the 
Trace-Natchez Parkway, a road crossing several southern states that 
is actually part of the national Park system, and I knew I was 
close, but I couldn't see any signs directing me to it.  We 
stopped at the wooden clap-board general store in Learned, 
Mississippi to ask directions.

As I stepped through the doorway of the store a little bell on the 
door frame tinkled to announce my arrival.  I looked around, and 
immediately had the disconcerting feeling that I'd just entered 
some kind of a time warp and was back in 1925.  A string of a 
dozen dim incandescent bulbs swung across the ceiling providing a 
warm but indistinct light.  An ancient chest-type &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; 
cooler clattered as it sat against the back wall.  Wooden shelves 
sparsely loaded up with products like &quot;20-Mule Team Borax&quot; and 
tins of tobacco sat on the scored wooden floor.  The floor itself 
had shallow throughs worn into it by decades of shuffling feet, 
leaving a network of paths across the store: deepest between the 
door and the counter where the soda fountain used to be (some of 
the equipment was still in place); another heavy track between the 
cash register and the Coke cooler.  

I realized a middle-aged but child-like fellow had been watching 
me standing there for a while.  I walked over to the counter, said 
hello, and asked him what the easiest way to the Trace-Natchez 
Parkway was.  He paused for so long before responding I almost 
repeated the question.  &quot;Wellll...,&quot; he drawled, &quot;you know where 
Old Hope Road used to be?&quot;  I told him I was from Canada actually, 
and that I couldn't clearly recall where that road was, or where 
it had moved to.  He then proceeded to tell me, in his amazingly 
slow drawl, how to get to the Parkway, using lots of landmarks 
like &quot;Jed's farm house, the one with the broke tractor and lame 
dawg.&quot;  We followed his instructions, turning at Jed's place like 
he said we should, and actually were led straight to the Parkway.  
Small miracles.  

On our way out of Learned, we passed the Learned High School, 
which had a big sign out front reading:

          LEARNED HIGH SCHOOL
          HOME OF THE REBULS

I'm not kidding.

The Parkway lead us straight into Jackson, and soon we were back 
on I-55 again, having to pause our conversation as 18-wheelers 
roared past us and drowned out our voices.  David Schwarze had 
lent us his Free Camping Guide, and we decided on a camp site on 
Grenada Lake.  It was already dark when we finally pulled off the 
interstate at Grenada and started trying to follow the 
instructions in the book.  After close to forty minutes of driving 
around backroads in the dark trying to make some sense of the 
useless directions provided, we finally found a tackle shop open 
and stopped in to ask directions.  The fellow gave us excellent 
directions that took us straight to the site we were after.  His 
directions had no resemblance whatsoever to those in the book.  
There was only one other group of campers at the site, and after 
walking over to them to show them we weren't going to kill them 
and asking them to kindly do the same, we crashed out in the 
camper and fell straight to sleep. 

We woke up to the sound of birds and looked out to see our site 
was actually very beautifully situated on the side of the lake.  
We had a quick breakfast and hit the raod fast--we were anxious to 
get to Graceland!  We hit the interstate again, then turned off at 
Hernando and headed west to the Mississippi River.  We agreed that 
we had to take highway 61 into Memphis: this was simply The Way It 
Had To Be.  Highway 61 is also the name of a great Canadian road 
movie, a must see for all road-trippers and aspiring trumpet 
players.  

So we cruised towards Mecca on highway 61, passing through the 
farmlands, then suburbs, until finally we were in His town.  As we 
drove down Elvis Presley Boulevard, it was almost too much.  
Before we could believe it, we had pulled into the parking lot, 
and were preparing to shell out 20 bucks to tour His home, as the 
pamphlets so warmly invited us to.  His music was piped in 
everywhere, and there was even a greasy restaurant on site with a 
menu &quot;full of all of Elvis' favorites.&quot;  We passed.  Soon our tour 
bus number was called, and we boarded a small tour bus loaded 
mostly with sniggering Gen-Xers like us.  A video monitor in the 
bus played Elvis concert footage for the entire 2 minute trip 
across the street.  

And when the got off the bus, we set foot of His soil, the home of 
the King of Rock and Roll.  We held each other: we're here--
Graceland, Tennessee.
 
[Next week: We experience the personal touch of the Elvis Tour, do 
some grammatical proofing of Elvis' headstone, and continue to 
follow the Elvis Presley Trail leading us straight to the home 
of.... Joel Walker?!  Coincidence?!...]
