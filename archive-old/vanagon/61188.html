Subject: Rarest of the rare option?

Coming home from the Classic, Paula and I passed a young Mexican National
couple in a &quot;1961&quot; 21 window &lt;yeah, I know&gt; that they had attempted to sell
at Pomona over the weekend. They were unaware of the SOTO/Classic events and
drove all the way from &quot;Chee-waa-waa&quot; with no sucess. They were plunking
down I-10 at 42mph. &lt;eep!&gt; Met them at a rest stop and with the help of
Paula's fluent Spanish examined their bus.

Here's the question:

Their overhead air duct had a wind up clock cleanly in the center of their
access plate. They claimed that it was &quot;original-no custom.&quot;
Has anyone ever seen such a thing? It looked way cleaner than a hack job. I
could not see any brand name on the clock. The face looked old, well made
and had a F--S adjustment on it for adjusting the fast and slow action of
the clock.
After calling one of guys in California who oughta know-knows nothing and
suggested that it was &quot;Grand Ma's old clock.&quot;
-Can anyone indicate otherwise?
How about any listees in the UK or elsewhere?

&lt;got the name and address JUST in case&gt; ;-)
