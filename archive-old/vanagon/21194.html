&gt;&gt;Regarding carrying a spare right-front spindle, I think spare parts are
&gt;&gt;magic.  I have never broken anything I had a spare one of in the car.
&gt;&gt;B.

I my accelerator cable once broke while I was on the way to work.  Lucky for
me I have the cable, as I was thinking about replacing it.  Unlucky for me I
had yet to get the hex wrenches to remove the old cable.   I had to walk
about 3/4 mile, in the rain, to a friends house and beg for a ride to the
local hardware store and buy some wrenches.  Went into the engine compartment
and tried to pull the cable through.  You can't do this,  the cable go stuck
in the tube that runs by the transmition.  After ripping apart the tube with
some wire cutters got the cable out.  That having been done I was up and
running again, although I did have to tie a not in the cable to get it to
work.

The lesson is this, if you don't want the part to break. Bring a spare and
the tools to put the spare in.  Oh yeah, bring the manual too.

BTW, does any know where i have get this accelerator cable tube.
