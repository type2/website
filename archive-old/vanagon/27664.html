Subject: sound proofing info

Hello everyone,

I am an on-again, off-again subscriber of the vanagon list.  I am not
currently subscribed to the vanagon list, but I still think of you folks
from time to time. 

I ran across some information about sound proofing light aircraft, and I
thought that it would be of interest to some of you.  Sound proofing the
Bus is a discussion thread that crops up on the mailing list, and driving
around in my Bus is somewhat like driving a small plane around (wind
buffeting, noise, yelling &quot;CONTACT&quot; everytime I start the thing, etc.).

&quot;How to Sound-Proof Light Aircraft,&quot; a 25k text file can be obtained by
sending email to the following address:

soundprf_at_pdsig_dot_com

What you'll get back is Aircraft Remanufacturing's description about
sound-proofing a small airplane using their product.  It was interesting
reading for me, and I particularly related to the first paragraph, having
driven VW buses for thousands of miles.
