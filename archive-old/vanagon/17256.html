just thought i'd pass on a quick note about Euro American

I've been dealing with Pete  Catlett (phone 818-760-4214 or FAX
818-760-4216) who runs Euro American. Here are a few quick prices on some
things that I was looking for my 73 and 65 WEsties

1973 Westy

Part Number              Description                    Price($US)

ZVW 223 101          Complete Water Pump                $62.80
ZVW 222 117          Power Supply Cord                  $57.30
ZVW 223 179          Breathpipe (plastic tube from      $35.81
                     top of coldbox to vet out thru
                     roof)

1965 Westy

231 067 291A         FillTube &amp; Cap for Water Tank      $14.78

some of his prices seem really high - 57 bucks for an elecrical
cord???????, and others seem sorta reaonable, (i.e. $15 for water tank tube
and cap)

Pete is really helpful, so if you are looking for some old parts give'm a
call. He doesn't have any parts for split westy's except for the above
mentioned item. (in stock)

Does anyone know *how long* the original power cord was/is? IS there
anythingspecial about it other than the fact that it is &quot;orig. equip?&quot; For
that price I could buy two or three of your standard yellow 50 foot long
electrical cords?
