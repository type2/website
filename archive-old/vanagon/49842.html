Subject: mechanic says NO to bars leak

Since discovering my little head gasket leak, I've been trying to gather a
bit of info.  The owner/mechanic at a garage here who has worked on VWs a
long time emphatically stated that bars leak should NOT be used in the
vanagon coolin system.  It has something to do with a plastic core 
radiator and/or other plastic parts.  The improtant part is that he 
insists that this can cause the entire system to be clogged leading to 
the demise of.....well, you get the picture.

My leak is sufficiently negligible that I can hold off for now anyway, 
but this guy has made me thing twice about adding anything to the 
coolant.  Meanwhil, I plan to be the next victim to call VOA to see what 
they can do for me.
