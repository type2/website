Subject: Under- or in-dash AC???

Recently someone mentioned they had seen a vanagon in a shop having an
under- or in-dash AC unit being installed.  I would like to get some
information on brand and model of this unit or any other in dash AC unit
for a vanagon.   The name or phone number of the shop doing this
installation would be just as good.

Also Ed Berroth (aka EdBuzz_at_aol_dot_com) described an in-dash unit last Fall
(1996).  If anyone has any information on this unit or how to get in touch
with Ed please let me know.  I've tried email and phone directories but
I've not been able to reach him.

Email me privately and I will post any useful information that I find.
