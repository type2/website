Subject: more on anti-freeze

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;OK- I called Prestone to get their story on anti-freeze. They claimed:
&gt;
&gt;   1 - Phosphate free anti-freeze is only needed over seas where they
&gt;        have hard water. what???? I never heard this before, but I have
&gt;        used thier anti-freeze for 60,000 miles over 5 years so far with
&gt;        out problem. So it could be true!
&gt;
&gt;   2 - When VW said &quot;PERMANENT&quot; they ment it! The reason for
&gt;        anti-freeze replacement is because the rust inhibiter in the
&gt;        anti-freeze gets depleted as the iron in most engines rusts.
&gt;        The Vanagon engine is mostly ALuminum alloy and rubber/
&gt;         plastic hose. The only iron in the cooling system  I no of is
&gt;         the cylinder walls. Therefore no need to flush the system.
&gt;
&gt;   3 - Last Perstone does have a phosphate free anti-freeze sold in
&gt;        a silver container. I'm sure it's more expensive. No I don't
&gt;        work for them.  Besides Vanagon head gaskets change the
&gt;        anti freeze for you.                 Eric Zeno
