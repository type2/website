Subject: A/C Blowing gunk

Hey guys,

A message a while back spoke of the A/C system blowing out pieces of
filter type material when the blower was on.  I had the same problem.

Last night I took apart the duct work to clean it out and add new
speaker wires while I was there.  All of the gunk was in the very front
section of the duct.  If all I wanted to do was rid my system of the
gunk I could've done it with a shop vac without removing the duct work. 
Just pop out the vents and vac away.  I opted to take it apart to look
for the source, a member mentioned a filter somewhere in there.  I could
not find where that filter would go and could not find mention of it in
the Bently.  I did not drop the A/C unit though, I just blew it out with
compressed air and found no evidence of a filter or it's bits.

If anyone knows where this filter should be or should've been let me
know, I'm sure there's none of it left to blow in my face.
