So Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com says:

&gt; *Miscellaneous maintenance includes headlights, lamps, wiper blades, cleaning
&gt; supplies and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt;  Since I do my own maintenance, each month I put some money aside for tires
&gt; and engine overhaul.  Brakes and suspension parts are included in the tire
&gt; fund.  Actually, the funds are mixed and budgeted at about $25 per month.
&gt;  Since a properly built engine lasts ten years or more, despite the several
&gt; brake jobs, valve jobs and new clutches along the way, there's always a tidy
&gt; sum on hand.
&gt; 

This was a really good article Bob.  I'd like to add that you can really
save yourself some bucks by anticipating future expenses this way.  You
have time before you mishap to look for good buys on tires, batteries,
fan belts etc.  If you look at it this way, you'll be way ahead in the
financial part of owning your VW (or whatever car).  If you wait until
it has to be towed, then you've already lost significant $$$.

That's why I have my essential tools list and try to keep those things
with me on the road so I don't have to pay for a tow to get me to a 
shop that will charge me an arm and a leg for a stupid clutch cable or
whatever it is that broke.  I just keep an extra one in the car.
