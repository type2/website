Subject: aux heater leak, 91 gl

Greetings List, I have a couple questions regarding the auxiliary heater
(under bench seat) on my vanagon. I recently had the leaking core replaced
under warranty, however, there is still a very slow leak (&lt;drop/hour) from
what appears to be the heater valve (Bentley, p.80.16), where the outflow
hose connects. 
Questions:
1) The owners manual shows a lever on the passenger side of the heater unit
which is used to shut off coolant flow. This lever does not exist on my
heater (at least not as illustrated). Any ideas on how I can stop coolant
flow without this lever, or perhaps I am missing something?
2) A number of previous posters (see archives) have had leaks from the
plastic bleeder valve. Mine has the metal valve. Are the metal bleeders more
reliable than the platic predecessor or is this still a leak prone part?

Thanks, Pat
