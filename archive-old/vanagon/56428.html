Subject: Re: HELP!!! 87 Syncro loss of compression (puttputtputt....)

Chris,

&gt; Please any and all help.  I need to know if it can/should be driven so that I
&gt; know whether it needs to be towed off the island  (and more importantly if I
&gt; can drive 200 miles back to Conn so that I can show up for work on Wens).

Cheapest &amp; easiest &amp; most likely; replace fuel filter.  I've had these
types of symptoms a couple of times, both with my syncro &amp; 2wd -
emergency 'fix' &amp; get the thing home; Techron.  I'd suggest doing both,
replace the fuel filter, put in a bottle of Techron (gas additive, &amp;
also injector cleaner &amp; etc.), fill up with premium.

Let me know how it goes,

Thanks,

Rich
