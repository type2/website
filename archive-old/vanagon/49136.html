Subject: 87 Drivetrain/engine  noise


Hello again to all-

I am beginning to hear a periodic noise and associated vibration while in 
idle from my 1987 Vanagon.  The noise is a &quot;Hmmmmm&quot; that's audible in the 
driver's seat, pretty low frequency.  It seems that I can &quot;feel&quot; a vibration 
associated with the noise in the clutch pedal.  The vibration/noise duration 
is for about 2-3 seconds, then off for approx. 3-5 seconds.  It occurs with 
the clutch engaged and disengaged.  Can't hear anything while moving.

Anybody have any ideas?

Thanks for the help...
