yup.  get a piece of rod, brass brazing rod works well, and stick 4 
pieces-- one in each hole.  then move the tips of the rods on each 
side of the radio *to the outside* and pull at the same time.  the 
dealer sells these nifty bent clips that do the same thing but i have 
taken the radios out with just the 4 rods.
