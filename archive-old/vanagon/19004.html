Subject: WTB (pronto!): '71 Westy

Hi there... again. :-) Yup, good guess: the standard &quot;wannawesty&quot; grovel.

After yet *another* unsuccessful attempt at acquiring one (#6) I am posting
again in hopes of finding any info on a '71 Westy in the New England, or
surrounding, area(s).

It would be very, very nice if;
1) the present owner has documentation, including from previous owners (if
there were any), of services completed (and possible sales agreements).
2) the interior and exterior are functional and in 'good condition', on up.
3) the drivetrain, suspension, and brakes are safe, clean, and in working order
(preferably with low miles on originals or rebuilds... yeah, I know... but we
all can dream, right!?! ;-)

I am not *really* in dire straights (yet), but due to the fact that I have a
buyer lined up for my present vehicle and that I'm planning on moving from NH
by winter, I'm quite intent on locating one this summer so it can &quot;personalized
and winterized&quot; by next season. As you all probably know, it's brutal just
locating one up here, regardless of its condition!

Like I've posted before (and hopefully won't have to again... whew!) *any* help
with locating one will be *more* than greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Oh, and I will pay with cash.

Sincerely,
Scott
