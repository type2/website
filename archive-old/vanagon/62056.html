Canine,

This discussion has come up before, everyone said it doesn't work.  Let
us know your test results as compared to before you used it.  If it
really works that would be great.

&gt; fro carbureded and fuel injected vehicals.....It goes on your inline fuel
&gt; line and breaks up the clusters in todays gas.....like the mr3 and
&gt; stuff.....ok heres what is written bye the epa accepted lavoratory
&gt; results....
&gt; 
&gt;             before        after          change
&gt; HC           .430         .328         -24%
&gt; CO         3.354       1.100         -68%
&gt; NOx       3.172       2.711         -15%
&gt; CO2     330.628      299.322      -10%
&gt; MPG       26.447      29.526       +11.6%
&gt; 
&gt; these things only cost 19.95 and are very earth friendly and they do indeed
&gt; WORK.....I save lots in gas every week....On my syncro I went from 16 city 20
&gt; highway to 19 city 24 highway..it was great and when you have a heavy load it
&gt; gets even better milage cuz of the way it works....its a very small piece
&gt; only two magnets but they work...I personally havent gone through emmisions
&gt; yet but will in Aug. and expect it to help me lots......I would suggest it to
&gt; anyone for any vehical....oh and its on page 198 in the new jc witney
&gt; mag....under fuel systems..
&gt; lots of luck to you all..
