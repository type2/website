Subject: Re: Vanagon Disaster Prevention

&gt;This is for those of you who are &quot;fortunate&quot; enough to own a Vanagon with 
&gt;an oil cooler.  CHECK IT NOW !  Before it's too late  !

Frank:  I think this was what caused the Space Shuttle disaster.  Cold
weather, brittle O-rings.  I thought about this when I read it in Bentley.
Perhaps your cooperative VW dealer could help you on the collapsed lifter,
after all this was noted as a common problem.
