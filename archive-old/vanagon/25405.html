          hopefully this will be the last posting about my rebuilt GEX
          motor for a LONG time!  saturday i pulled the motor  (by
          myself mr. easterwood!) and then on sunday i retorqued the
          heads, adjusted valves, changed the oil and reassembled
          (with help!).  the left side (#3 &amp;4) head was a tiny bit
          loose.  same side valves were a bit tight.  #4 plug was very
          black, but not wet and not fouled.  all others were great.
          no oil drips anywhere.  i removed all tins and shroud and
          literally had zero oil leakage or weepage!

          i was not able to check compression but will do that next
          weekend when i can borrow a gauge with long hose.

          it starts with one kick of the pedal and purrs.  no exhaust
          leaks, no hesitation, no big noises, no vibration.  it
          really is nice!  now if it will pass the longevity test.  i
          am very pleased and confident for the future of this motor.
          (knocking on magnesium here).  i had a longish conversation
          with Otis, the warranty guy at GEX,and was assured that
          there was no problem with me doing my own work as long as i
          followed the break-in scheduled maintenance and didn't
          overheat the motor.  i was encouraged by his good attitude.
          there is a &quot;button&quot; adhered to the back of the motor case
          and if this falls off, they determine it is due to
          overheating and you're SOL.  fair enough!

          onward to n. carolina for camping in the bus and cooler
          weather at last.
