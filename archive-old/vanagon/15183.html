Subject: engine rebuild in FL

Yikes!  I thought everything was working out so well.  I should have known.
The guy I was going to trade my old car to for the engine repair has stepped
out due to personal problems.  Zoinks!
Now what Scooby?
Is there a reaaaaaaaaaaaal good description somewhere of how to pull the 
engine out of an 1985 Vanagon?  Actually, I can get it out...how about 
putting it all back together?  : )
I've done head gaskets on regular engines which don't require the whole 
damn engine being dropped.  I've never done bearings and rings, but, am 
thinking of doing these if I did in.....IF IF IF
I went to Discount Auto Parts..I know I know I know, but the whole 
rebuild kit was only $200.  Plus $100 for Bosch tune-up things.  Plus 
another $100 to have hte head shaved and the valves ground.  Plus another 
thousand when I destroy something reeeeeealy vital.  Sigh.  I hate to pay 
some guy to do this.  
Hey, all those engines you guys are talking about for $1000, are they 
rebuilds?  Some one said that was to their front door?  that may be an 
idea...

deep in thought(shit)
