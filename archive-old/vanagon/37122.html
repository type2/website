I agree, I should replace the sensor. I have no idea of how many miles are
on it. When I tried to test it with a DVM, it didn't give the results that 
Dan Houg said it should produce. I just installed a new catalytic converter 
and I don't want to mess it up.

I see in the Parts Place catalogue that new generic three wire sensors are 
available for about $50.00. I would have to splice the wires to the old 
connector, but that's no biggie. Do you think that the generic sensors are 
as good as the Bosch? The Bosch sensor is about $130.00.
