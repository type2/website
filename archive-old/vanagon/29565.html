Subject: new buyer old van

I am a poor person with a small amount of money.  I need a van for my 
racing team.  I've come across a 83 Westy w/ a diesel motor that was 
replaced new in 92.  Guy has all the service records and tons of 
vestibules, screens, and stuff.  The van has no rust and new tires.  He 
wants 7500 dollars to part with this fine specimen.  Is it too much 
money?  Please give your generous comments.  Thanks, JIM
