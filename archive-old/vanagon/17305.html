I saw the following in the '71 bus review, and it got me
to thinking......


There is a very effective ventilating and heating system.  Fresh air is
supplied through six outlets controllable from the dash with two
supplying the windshield, two outlets in the dashboard, and two
supplying the rear compartment through ducts located on the inside of
the front doors where they also double as arm rests.

There are pictures of this setup in my owners manual as well, but
there are no ducts on the doors....looks like there is some
aftermarket doorhandles as well as the original strap. Were the
ducts on non-Westy models only? Were the door handles aftermarket?
(they are in rough shape, and I'd like to replace them, but
of course haven't been able to find any).

Curious.
