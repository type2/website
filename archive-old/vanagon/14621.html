&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also true that '57 did not come with a gas guage?  (The fellow I 
&gt; &gt; purchased it from had one added.) 
&gt; 
&gt; True indeed, gas guages were only standard in '62, I think. Before that,
&gt; they were only in Ambulances (for obvious reasons) Before guages, there
&gt; was a 1 gallon or so emergency reserve tank. when your main tank ran
&gt; out, you just flipped a switch to go to the reserve tank, and then got
&gt; gas really soon...

Yup....and the _switch_ was under the seat 8)
