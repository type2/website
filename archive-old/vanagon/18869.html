Corvair made a van in the early 60s.  Not a bad little unit.  Looked a 
little like the Mitsubishi van, but funkier.

If you could put up with leaking oil, the Corvair was one dynamite car.   It 
could outhandle ANY American car of its time with the exception of the 
Vette.

I once had an illustration of just how fine their handling was when I got 
the headlights sucked out of my VERY fast and sweet 1970 BMW 2002 by a 
Corvair.  I could keep up on the straights, but on the winding stretches of 
road he'd leave me like I was stuck in something.

It's odd that the Corvair was driven out of production by alleged flaws in 
its handling capabilities.  Balderdash!
