So Marcus Doherr says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I went to a wreck yard yesterday to look around for parts for my '80 
&gt; Vanagon and ran across a newer watercooled (probably 87-90) VANAGON GL. 
&gt; It was a total wreck from right above the front bumber all the way to the 
&gt; back seats (obviously had contact with a bulldozer - I hope not while 
&gt; being driven!), but the back (hatch, engine compartment etc.) were in good 
&gt; shape. Without much time, I took a quick look into the engine 
&gt; compartment, and - believe it or not - everything (engine, tranny etc.) was 
&gt; still in there.
&gt; 
&gt; The Yard (&quot;Golden State&quot;) is in California on a side road to Country Road 
&gt; 102 between Davis and Woodland (Sacramento area). I will probably go back 
&gt; within the next week or so, so if anybody is interested in more 
&gt; information (please specify), i can try to find out! 
&gt; 
&gt; So long - have fun...

Holy-moly Marcus!  Do you know how much they'll charge for misc.
engine components?  Specifically the brain and other sensors etc?
I'll go over their myself and snag some of that stuff.  What are
the hours?
