Subject: Bus Torsion Bar Adjustment?

     Well, my '69 camper is sagging enough in the back that I am 
seriously thinking of doing something about it this weekend.  I am 
planning on adjusting the rear torsion bars and would like to solicit 
some advice on this procedure.  I plan to estimate the number of degrees 
to adjust the torsion bars with a level and protractor; but I would like 
to get some feedback on how many degrees others have rotated the torsion 
bars.  I guess it would be easiest to just rotate the bars one notch 
which would give about 7 degrees of lift, however I've heard of some 
people who's CV joints didn't like that amount of lift and started making 
noise.  How many degrees did you rotate your rear torsion bars to make 
this adjustment and were you pleased with the results?  E-mail me 
directly and I'll post a summary.
