Subject: Re: inverted clay pot Q

OK, but a byproduct of the combustion in burning propane (among other
fuels) is water.   When I used my pot for heating, I could see
the moisture build up from it and on it.  That's when I began to
worry about it seeping into the unglazed surface, getting inside
the &quot;pores&quot; of the clay, expanding with the heat, and causing
an explosion.  If there is a tiny chance of this, wouldn't the iron pot be safer?
