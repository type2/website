Subject: New swivel-foot adjusters

NOPI Swivel-Foot Adjusters

The engine I’ve hauled to Kent, Washington for the purpose of hauling me
home, uses a brand of swivel-foot adjuster I’ve not used before.   They
arrived with other components from NOPI.  

The new adjusters look like Berg adjusters, but only from a distance.
 Adjustment is made using a 3mm Allen wrench, more convenient than the stock
slotted type, and the swivel foot is a real ‘foot’, rather than a flattened
portion of a ball.  But on close inspection I saw that the feet were not
finished.  Tool marks were clearly evident, even a central pip on several of
the feet.

On Berg adjusters the foot is polished flat after heat treatment.  On the
adjusters from  NOPI there was no sign of polishing or flatting.  The things
were heat treated but on those with a pronounced central pip, this resulted
in a hardened point the size of a pencil lead that would probably wear the
valve quite rapidly.

Using stones, I polished the contact face of the adjusters until they were
flat.  The hand-grinding took about an hour.

Swivel-foot adjusters upset the geometry of the rocker due to the greater
length between the valve stem and the rocker arm.  The NOPI adjusters, like
the Berg adjusters, come with a stack of shims that must be placed under the
rocker-arm towers to restore the proper geometry.  But they were rather poor
quality shims.  Some had turned edges and none were a tight fit on the stud.

Getting rid of the turned edges took a few minutes with a stone, after which
I gave them a quick rub on #600 wet &amp; dry sandpaper to check for high spots.

Since the shims were a sloppy fit on the studs I cleaned them with acetone
and pre-assembled them onto the studs with a dot of sleeve retainer between
the layers of shims. Aligned and torqued-down, they welded themselves into a
single shim-stack.  During final assembly I wouldn’t have to worry about
loose or missing shims.

During the engine’s few hours on the test stand the new adjusters wore at a
fast rate, apparently at the ball &amp; socket.  I had soaked them in oil
overnight before assembling the rockers, and the rockers produced a good oil
spray within the valve gallery, but some of the adjusters were wildly out of
adjustment after only a few minutes of running.  This flattened out as the
engine gained hours but it remains a worrisome thing to me. 

I’ll keep you posted as to how well the adjusters perform on the trip home.
 If the fragile foot doesn’t snap off they should just do fine.  Price was
less than $20.  And of course, if the foot DOES break off it wil bugger-up
the valve stem; the $20 could prove a very expensive economy.

coffee, a nice place to work and great scenery.
