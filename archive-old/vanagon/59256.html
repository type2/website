Subject: 84 GL Hard shifting

84 GL w/103K

Symptoms:  

1. Clutch catches only in the top two inches of the throw
2. Rear end &quot;hops&quot; or &quot;bounces&quot; when clutch fully released (not always)
3. As the Van warms up, it gets harder to get the shifter to engage (difficult 
to push into each gear)
4. I've gone through two slave cylinders in three years

Last time I had truck in the shop, the mechanic said the clutch was &quot;on the 
cusp&quot;, and that the parts are about $200 and there is six hours of labor 
involved at $35 per.  Now, this guy drives a late model Westy daily, and seems 
to now what he is doing, but he is also somewhat flaky.  So I'm wondering if 
all these problems are related to the clutch going, or are there other issues 
here as well.

Pete
