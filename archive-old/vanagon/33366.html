Subject: ICM/ICV FAQ

Folks,

Sorry this took so long!  I was just too busy to finish it, and I
didn't want to skimp, so here it is!  Please send me any comments,
corrections, new info, etc.
------------------------------

I decided to put this FAQ together in the hope that others won't have
to suffer the many hours of frustration and hopelessness I went
through just to get the car to idle!  The info contained herein was
obtained from many sources including what I learned from my toils,
Bentley, and snippets sent to me by other Bimmernetters (sorry I can't
cite sources - there were too many).  If you have any additions or
corrections, please send them to me.  DISCLAIMER:  my own experiences
were based on my '85 325e and a friend of mine's '86 325es, so any
references to other models are based on info I couldn't verify myself.
Many thanks to all who provided information. Hope y'all find this
helpful...

Sorry I couldn't cover other years/models, but as it is, writing this up
took several hours as it is.  The info contained herein applies to
models w/ Motronic units prior to 1.1 (which eliminates the ICM and
controls the ICV directly).  Models covered include 1982-87 5 and 3
series.

After writing this, I found out that a similar FAQ had been added the
WWW server.  I've appended it after my FAQ.

TechFAQ:  The Idle Stabilization System
---------------------------------------

1. Idle System Overview
-----------------------

In a conventional idle system, idle speed is controlled setting a
baseline throttle opening.  The idle speed is increased by increasing
the throttle rest opening, and decreased by decreasing the throttle
rest opening, usually via a throttle-positioning set screw.  

With the idle stabilization system, the throttle is completely closed
at idle; instead, air gets into the engine via an electronically
controlled bypass system.  Air for the idle system is obtained via a
hose tap in the intake boot upstream from the throttle, and fed into
the engine through a manifold tap next to the cold start valve.  The
idle speed is controlled by modulating the amount of air which
bypasses the throttle via an electronically controlled closed loop
stabilization circuit.

                               |                        ^          |
                               |----------&gt; ICV --------|          |
                                             ^                     |
                                             |                     |
                                            ICM &lt;- input signals --|

Engine input signals and feedback allow more accurate control of idle
speed over changing ambient air pressure, temperature, etc. (and
hopefully, reduced emissions).

---&gt;  Note that the idle system gets its air _downstream_ from the air
      flow meter!  The air is _metered_ so the DME knows about it!

The heart of the system is a small brain box, called the idle control
module (ICM) (or idle control unit (ICU)), which takes engine signals
as inputs.  Although the ICM works in concert with, and shares some
inputs w/ the Motronic (DME), there is no direct electrical
communication between the two systems.  The sole output of the ICM is
a control signal which modulates a solenoid operated valve (the Idle
Control Valve (ICV)). The ICV in turn adjusts the flow of bypass air
through the idle system.  The DME responds to the idle system via
the air flow meter and its effects on input signals, such as engine
RPM.

&gt;From the above description, a common fallacy about the idle system is
instantly dispelled:

Fallacy #1:  An idle system malfunction can mess up the mixture
and destroy my oxygen sensor or catalytic converter, costing me mucho
dinero.

  Repudiation:  Fallacy #1 arises from the notion that somehow an idle
  system malfunction can result in richening of the mixture, thus
  resulting in destruction of the O2 sensor and cat.  However, _all_
  air through the idle system is _metered_ by the air flow meter.
  Also, there are _no_ electrical outputs passed from the ICM to the
  DME.  Therefore, the idle control system can only affect the idle
  mixture to the extent that changing the idle speed can cause the DME
  to vary the mixture.

  Salient Points:  Your mechanic is full of sh--.  Experimentation with
  the idle system won't destroy your car in some unknown way.  The
  only way you can directly change the idle mixture via the idle
  system is to introduce a vacuum leak (which results in _leaning_ of
  the mixture).  The only thing that can cause a rich mixture is a
  malfunctioning DME.

The ICV control signal appears to be PWM (pulse-width modulation),
meaning that the ICM varies the duty cycle instead of the voltage to
change the valve opening.


2. ICV Overview
---------------
 
The ICV is a dark plastic or silver-colored metal cylinder 3.5&quot; long
and 1.5&quot; in diameter mounted on top of a two-legged support bolted to
the valve cover near the firewall.  An intake hose gets air from a tap
on the side of the intake boot between the air filter and the throttle
(the intake fitting is directly opposite the electrical connector).
The output is at a right angle to the intake, and feeds to a short 2&quot;
hose, which in turn feeds into the intake manifold next to the cold
start valve.  A black plastic two-pin connector feeds control current
to the solenoid-operated valve flap with the ICV.

When there is no current, the valve is completely open.  Increasing
the current decreases the opening.  The solenoid valve in the ICV does
not entirely control the air flow though it; an adjustable bypass
system within the ICV allows air to flow through it even when the
solenoid valve is completely closed (hmm...a bypass system within a
bypass system!).  When the adjustment screw on the side of the ICV is
turned all the way clockwise, no air bypasses the solenoid valve;
turning it counterclockwise increases the bypass air flow.

----&gt; The adjustment screw analogous to throttle position screw in a
      conventional idle system.  Opening it up is like cracking open
      the throttle.

Bentley describes adjustment of the ICV screw as &quot;adjusting
the ICV current.&quot;  In reality, the adjustment screw only indirectly
affects the control current to the ICV because the ICM reacts to the
RPM fluctuation caused by the change in idle air.  When you open the
screw, it lets more air bypass the valve, increasing the idle speed;
the ICM  responds by increasing the duty cycle (current) to decrease
the ICV opening.

Bentley also says that adjusting the screw isn't supposed to affect
the idle speed.  I haven't found this to be the case (even when
borrowing my friend's working ICM and ICV), so don't be too alarmed by
it.


ICM Overview
------------

The ICM is made by VDO.  It is a 2&quot;x2&quot; box located above the glove
box, to the left of the Motronic unit.  To access the ICM, open the
glove box and remove the black plastic upper cover (two phillips
screws facing you at the junction of the dash and the cover; two black
plastic retainers, in the back - rotate and remove).  The big box w/
the large connector is the DME.  There are different colors of ICM:
solid black, black with a green stripe, and solid green.  Black is the
oldest. The solid green one it is the latest update (the one you
want).  The ICM is held in by a single bolt, and a 2x6 12-pin
connector is connected to it.  The pin numbers are clearly marked on
both the ICM and the connector:

1) ICV (output)
2) Power supply
3) RPM sensor
4) Ground
5) ICV (output)
6) Coolant temperature switch
7) Automatic transmission range switch
8) N.C.
9) A/C switch
10) Air temperature switch
11) Coolant temperature sensor
12) Throttle rest position switch

All of the signals are inputs except the ICV outputs.

Inside the ICM is an analog circuit mounted on two circuit boards
w/ a flexible connection.  The circuit consists of an assortment of
resistors, capacitors, op-amps, etc.  Its job is to decrease the duty
cycle of the ICV signal when RPM's dip and increase it when RPM's
rise, contingent upon its various other inputs.  Sounds like a pretty
easy task, doesn't it?  Why it doesn't do a better job is a puzzle to
me.  It seems like any idiot could design a better circuit.  For one
thing, the ICM can't seem to compensate very well for changes in ICV
friction (that's why it's a no-no to clean or lube the ICV!  It'll
mess up the calibration and the stupid ICM won't be able to control it
right!).




4. Troubleshooting
------------------

Of course, the easiest thing to do is buy a new ICM and ICV but that
costs a lot of buck$ - about $300 from my sources.  Getting used stuff
from a yard might seem tempting at first, but bear in mind that the
ICM is a delicate electronic circuit that overheats easily (that power
transistor doesn't have a heat sink!), and the ICV can appear to
function correctly, but still be out of whack.  If you want to buy a
used ICM, at least get the solid green one, because it's supposed to
be the most reliable.  Even if an ICV passes electrical tests, it
could still be out of calibration. Personally, I think it's playing
Russian roulette to buy any parts that you can't verify are good.  If
you're lucky enough to have a good friend who will let you borrow
his/her *working* ICM/ICV, that's the best bet for testing, of course.

It's probably a good idea to make sure the car is tuned up, the air
filter is clean, and the fuel filters and injectors are clean, etc.
before proceeding w/ the diagnosis.  If your motor is too out of
whack, the stabilization system probably won't be able to compensate.

DON'T CLEAN THE ICV W/ GUMOUT OR WD-40!  It just might change its
friction enough that the ICM won't be able to control it anymore.

Vacuum Leaks
------------

First, look for vacuum leaks!  Vacuum leaks introduce unmetered air,
causing a lean mixture and rough running.

* Is your oil filler cap tight?
* Is your oil dipstick tight?
* Any cracked vacuum hoses or loose connections?
* Any cracks in the intake boot?

One good trick is to spray a little carb cleaner where you suspect a
leak.  If the RPM's change, then you know you've found a leak.


ICV Diagnosis
-------------

NOTE:  The diagnoses below don't all make sense unless you follow the
steps in the sequence shown.

1) Turn the ignition key to run position, but don't start the car.  You
should hear quiet buzzing sound from the ICV, and if you touch it with
your fingers, a vibration.  If not, either the ICV is bad or there is
no control current.

2) Start the car. Run the system &quot;open loop&quot; by pulling the electrical
connector from the ICV.  The RPM's should climb to about 1500-2000,
and then oscillate back and forth between about 600-1500rpm.  If
reconnecting the electrical connector has no effect on RPM's, your ICM
is probably at fault.  (For the curious, your RPM's fluctuate because
when the ICV is disconnected, the valve is stuck wide open, and the
DME is the only thing controlling your idle.  The RPM's rise until it
cuts the fuel flow, which causes RPM's to dip. Then it restores fuel
flow, and the cycle begins again.)

3) Cut the motor.  Pull the electrical connector from the ICV and
connect an ohmmeter across the terminals.  The reading should be about
9-10 ohms at temp 73+-9F(23+-5C).  If you get an open circuit, it's
time for a new ICV.  If the resistance is much lower, you've got a
short, and your ICM may be roached too, from the resultant excessive
current draw.

4) Disconnect the ICV hoses, and look into the outlet.  Obtain jumpers
and connect 12V across the ICV terminals.  The valve should close
tightly when voltage is applied, and open strongly when the voltage is
removed.  (Yes, it might look grungy and black in there, but resist
the temptation to clean it w/ solvent for now - it could throw it out
of whack!).  If there is no movement or the movement is sluggish, your
ICV is bad.

5) Plug in the ICV electrical connector and turn on the ignition
(engine not running!), all accessories turned off.  Looking into the
outlet again, the valve should be partly closed.  If the valve is wide
open and there is no vibration, you aren't getting any control
current.  To verify, unplug the ICV connector, and verify that you're
getting voltage across it.  If there's no voltage, your ICM is at fault.

6) Reconnect the ICV hoses and electrical connector.  Hook up an
ammeter in series the ICV.  W/ the engine fully warmed up and idling w/ all
accessories turned off, the current should be between 400-500 mA.  If
the current is wrong, adjust the ICV current.  Turn the adjusting
screw until you get 460+-10 mA at 700+-50 rpm.

KLUDGE: If you can't get the current in the proper range, just try to
adjust the screw until your idle stabilizes at 700 RPM and ignore the
current reading.

If you can't adjust the control current properly, proceed to ICM Diagnosis.
If the ICM checks out ok, then the ICV is probably out of whack.
Maybe an ICV Kludge can help you peg the diagnosis (or fix the problem
well enough for you to live with it).


ICM Diagnosis
-------------

First, check to make sure the ICM is getting the proper input signals.

Checking the ICM Inputs
-----------------------

Disconnect the 28-pin connector from the ICM, and perform the
following measurements on the connector with the ignition on.

1,5) ICV
This is actually an output (the only one).  These two pins connect
directly to the ICV.  Hook up an ohmmeter between pins 1 and 5.  You
should get 9-10 ohms, the ICM DC resistance. See ICV testing section
for more details.

2) Power supply
A voltmeter hooked up between pins 2 and 4 should read battery voltage.

3) RPM sensor
Hook up an LED test light between pins 3 and 4.  While cranking the
starter, the light should flicker.

4) Ground
Use a continuity tester between pin 4 and any unpainted part of the
chassis.  There should be almost zero resistance.

6) Coolant temperature switch
Measure continuity between pins 6 and 4.  It should be open below
86F(30C) and closed above 118F(48C). If it doesn't close, check the
connection at the switch.  The temperature switch is mounted on thte
cylinder head coolant outlet, to the front of the thermo-time switch.
It is the only sensor in that area which has two separate push-on
spade terminals.  The brown wire goes to ground and the white wire
goes to ICM pin 6.

7) Automatic transmission range switch
Hook up a voltmeter between pins 7 and 4.
With manual transmission, should get battery voltage.  With auto
transmission, should get battery voltage w/ gear selector on Neutral
and Park positions, 0V in other positions. 

8) N.C.

9) A/C switch
A voltmeter between pins 9 and 4 should read battery voltage when the
A/C is turned on, zero when the A/C is off.

10) Air temperature switch
Voltmeter between pins 10 and 4 should read battery voltage below
18F(-8C) and 0V above 39F(4C).

11) Coolant temperature sensor
Hook up an ohmmeter between pins 11 and 4.  Verify the resistance at
the following coolant temperatures.

	|-----------------------------------------------|
	|Model		|325,325e,325es	| 325i,325is	|
	|-----------------------------------------------|
	|connector color| white		| blue		|
	|-----------------------------------------------|
	|temp           | resistance  (ohms)            |
	|14+-2F		| 7000-11600	| 8200-10500	|
	|(-10+-1C)	|		|		|
	|68+-2F		| 2100-2900	| 2200-2700	|
	|(20+-1C)	|		|		|
	|176+-2F	| 270-400	| 300-360	|
	|(80+-1C)	|		|		|
	|-----------------------------------------------|

If you just get an open circuit, check the connection.  The sensor is
located on the cylinder head coolant outlet, behind the thermo-time
switch.  You can also measure resistance directly across its terminals.

12) Throttle rest position switch
Ignition doesn't have to be on for this one.  Hook up a continuity
tester between pins 12 and 4.  You should get continuity when the
accelerator is in the rest position, and open circuit otherwise.  If
not, check the switch.

At the bottom of the throttle housing, there is a 3-pin connector.
First make sure it receives voltage.  Pull the harness connector. With
the ignition on, you should get 12V between the center and either of
the outer terminals of the harness connector.  Next, test the switch.
The left and center terminals are for rest position.  Open the
throttle part way by hand.  Slowly let it return to its stop.  The
switch should close when the throttle lever is approximately .2-.6mm
from its stop.

While you're at it, even though it doesn't affect idle, you should
test the full throttle switch.  Move the ohmmeter probes to the center
and right terminals.  Open the throttle slowly.  When the throttle is
within 10+-2degrees of full-open, the switch should close.

If the switch is out of whack, unbolt the throttle body via the 4
retaining nuts.  There are two screws on the switch body.  Loosen the
screws and rotate the switch body until it works as specified.  If
it's broke, replace it.


Testing the ICM
---------------

Although the inputs the ICM are well understood, the ICM is still somewhat
of an enigma.  I still haven't completely figured out the input/output
relationship.  If any one on the net has a good understanding, please
e-mail me so I can add it in.  In the meantime, here are some basic
tests you can perform to see if it's working at all.

Plug in the ICM and turn on the engine.

Hook up a voltmeter across the ICV terminals while it is still
connected to the ICM.  Introduce a lean condition by pulling up on the
oil dipstick.  You should see the voltage dip slightly, then go back
up as the idle speed stabilizes.  If the ICM is working properly,
detects the RPM drop and attempts to bring it back up by reducing the
ICV current (opening it up more).  If you have a scope, I guess you
could check to see if the duty cycle changes instead.  If you have an
AC voltmeter, check AC voltage, too.  Since the signal is pulsating
DC, you should get an AC voltage reading.  If it's just 0V, then your
ICM isn't modulating and is roached.

With the engine cold, shorting the coolant temp switch should cause an
RPM dip.  Also, you should see 8-12V measuring from the pin 6 to
ground when the switch is open.

The ICV control signal appears to be PWM waveform.  Hooking up a
frequency counter, I found the frequency to be fairly stable at about
145 Hz across various RPM's.

With the engine fully warmed up, unplug the throttle switch.  Blip the
throttle a couple of times.  If the idle speed doesn't change, ignore
this test.  If the idle speed rises to  somewhere around 1000-2000
RPM's after the blipping, plugging the throttle switch back in should
bring it down again (throttle closed).  This shows the ICM is
responding to the throttle rest position switch.

If all else fails, open up the ICM and look for burnt parts, shorts,
opens, bad solder joints, etc.  An assortment of screwdrivers can be
used to pry the connector out of the case.  I used an X-acto knife to
cut off all but two of the little retaining tangs, and then pulled the
connector out by the pins.  If you have a transistor or diode tester,
you can test the transistors.  Pay special attention to the output
transistor, which connects to the ICV outputs.  Electrolytic
capacitors often go bad, so you can unsolder them and see if they are
shorted or open circuited.  If you don't have a capacitance meter, one
rough method is short the capacitor to drain the charge, then hook up
an ohmmeter.  If it isn't roached, you should see the resistance go
from very low to very high as it charges from the ohmmeter current.



5. ICV Kludging
---------------

Now for the part you've been waiting for...

If the ICM doesn't seem to be the problem, and the ICV seems to
function properly except that you can't adjust it right, maybe you can
kludge it.  ICV Kludging will only work if your idle speed is too
high or is fluctuating wildly when the adjustment screw is turned all
the way in.  If your car just idles too low, you're out of luck,
unfortunately - go get a new ICV.  First, warm the engine up to
operating temperature.

If turning the ICV screw all the way in still doesn't get your idle down
to where it should be, or the idle speed is still oscillating all over
the place, maybe your ICV is still letting too much air into the
engine.  First, turn the ICV screw to approximately the middle of its
travel.  This way, once your kludge is in place, you can still
fine-tune with the screw.

The kludge procedure is iterative.  The basic idea is to add
restriction to the air flow through the ICV until the car idles right.
Fashion a plug by cutting a circular piece of metal to fit into the
ICV intake port.  Plastic is ok, too, as long as it can take the heat.
I cut my plug out of a metal bottle cap.

1.  Cut a tiny bit off one of the sides or drill a ~1/16&quot; hole into it
to let some air through. 

2. Insert the plug into the ICV intake port and reconnect the hoses
and electrical connector.

3. Start the engine and see if it idles.  

4. Repeat Steps 1-3, increasing the opening in the plug until the idle
speed is around 700 RPM.

Once you get it to 700 RPM, you can fine tune it with the screw.  Mine
stalls the first time it's started in cold weather, but otherwise, the
idle speed is rock stable now.  

NOTE:  After kludging, your ICV current may go way off spec.


6. Other Things to Try
----------------------

Some netters have said that fuel injector cleaner fixed their idling woes.

Maybe your oxygen sensor is bad.  I doubt this would be the cause, but
some have had success w/ changing it.  Testing of three wire O2 sensor:

  Locate the oxygen sensor connector.  On E30's, it's clipped to the
  battery pan in the engine compartment.  The 3 pins are labeled on the
  connector.

  Heater:  Bentley doesn't specify a resistance, but you shouldn't get
  an open circuit between pins 3 and 2.  On the other half of the
  connector, you should get 12V between pins 3 and 2.  Otherwise, your
  heater relay is probably bad.

  Sensor output:  The sensor generates a very small voltage (less than
  1V).  Warm up the car.  Connect voltmeter between pin 1 and ground.
  Let the car idle for about 2 min.  Lean the mixture by loosening the
  oil filler cap or pulling the oil dipstick.  The voltage should
  drop.  Try accelerating a few times or running at fast idle for a
  few minutes.  If the signal doesn't fluctuate or there is no
  voltage, your O2 sensor is bad.

Try cleaning the ICV w/ WD-40 or Gumout.  What do you have to lose at
this point?
 
If all else fails:  Pray to the Bimmer God.

&lt;listing&gt;
 
SUMMARY:
 
Tale of fixing a &quot;surge&quot; problem on a '84 528e. 


IDLE STABILIZER OVERVIEW:
 
Using a solenoid type control (VDO unit), feedback loop, and a 
control unit to stabilize the rpm to 700 rpm under various 
conditions.
 
Input to the control box:
     engine speed
     engine temperature
     idle contact switch
     system voltage
 
Output from the control box:
     PWM (pulse width modulated) to control the stabilizer valve.
 
When the solenoid is disconnected, or failed, it will remain wide
open. The idle rpm should go &quot;open loop&quot;. A warm engine will rev 
until 1200 rpm, causing the the fuel injection system to 
intervene, cutting off fuel flow. Shutting off the injectors 
causes the engine to decrease in speed... cutting the engine out. 
RPM drops back, and the fuel starts flowing again. This will give 
a surge from 700 RPM to 1200 RPM. Important to realize the idle 
stabilizer is wide open, so the rpm is actually being controlled 
by the fuel injection system running, then cutting out. 
(oscillation period for this engine was about 4 seconds).
 
With the solenoid connected directly to 12 volts and ground, it 
will fully close the valve, disabling any idle function. Once the 
car is started, it will stall unless the throttle is depressed to 
keep it running. Thankfully this is a fairly simple test to check 
the solenoid.
 
With a direct connection from the battery to the solenoid, 
current should be around 1.2 Amps with the valve connected 
between +12 and ground. Should the valve be shorted out, it will 
have a much higher current flow, possibly damaging the meter. If 
this is the case, the control unit may have also been damaged. 
This also explains the dealerships desire to replace both units 
at the same time.
 
Make an adapter to allow the current flowing through the 
stabilizer valve to be measured. An analog ammeter is preferable, 
to see any fluctuations, but a digital one will work since the 
pulse train is fairly fast, and the inductance of the stabilizer 
valve will dampened the fluctuations.
 
A neat &quot;emergency&quot; trick is to drill a 1/4&quot; hole into a penny,
place the penny next to valve input, replace the feed hose, and 
leave the stabilizer's electrical connection disconnected. This 
will result in an idle of approximately 800 rpm, allowing you to 
temporarily drive without the engine surging. 
 
Once the solenoid was checked, both under cold and hot 
conditions, the ammeter was left attached and placed into the 
passenger compartment for a test drive. Normal idle should 
produce a current reading of 470 ma. This was confirmed.
 
On the vehicle tested, the idle current would suddenly drop to 
a value much lower value than expected, and on occasion 
completely to zero. Since the valve checked out good previously, 
[it may have been a heat related open] the most likely cause was 
the control unit itself.
 
CONTROL UNIT:
 
A small &quot;black box&quot; [about 2&quot; x 3&quot; x 1&quot; thick] is located in the
upper portion of the glove box. The much larger unit is the 
Motronic engine management system, the one we are looking for is 
usually attached to a support bracket.
 
The control box was marked with a green band of tape, showing it 
to be of the later recall that affected the '84 model year. The 
control valve is silver, as the earlier [recalled] units were 
black.
 
Once I had the box out, I was able to open it with care using a 
half dozen paper clips, a small screw drive, and lots of patience. 
 
First glance didn't show anything unusual, only four Integrated
circuits (IC's) all of which were LM2902 quad op-amps, a few 
active components (transistors), and maybe five dozen passive 
components (resistors, capacitor, and an inductor).
 
The output transistor, an BD438 [PNP 4Amp] , showed a fair amount 
of heat being dissipated, blackening the PCB (parts component 
board), and was a fair suspect for a &quot;heat related failure&quot;. The 
heat, and vibration, of the unmounted device had caused the 
solder joints to degrade in appearance. Desoldering to component 
it was obvious the collector lead was barely making contact. 
 
Once I had the power transistor out, I tested it over night on a 
curve tracer, looking for an intermittent failure. The transistor 
performed satisfactory, but left me perplexed as to why VDO didn't 
use a heatsink on it, but left it with only its leads to hold it 
in place and provide a heat dissipation path.
 
Further examination of the PCB showed a hairline crack in the 
trace leading from the transistor to the connector. This would 
close at cold temperature, then OPEN at higher temperature. Since 
the contact was marginal it will allow some current to pass, but 
not as much as expected. A repair was carried out by soldering a 
wire direct from the transistor to the connector.
 
So far everything has held together, and the car is back into 
operation as hoped! While a new control stabilizer valve and 
control unit would have set me back almost $500, I was able to 
track down the failure which give a higher sense of satisfaction, 
al a bit at over 40 hours involved!  [It would not have been 
unusual for a BMW mechanic to have billed over 20 hours labor, 
and the new parts, to a tune of $1300 to repair this!]
 
Since a new control box, from the dealer, cost $250; wrecking yard
would be approximately half that cost. But given the failure I 
described, the life expectancy of a used unit would be 
questionable.
 
It seems a simple microcontroller with built in diagnostics could 
be built to replace the original. Advantage of the aftermarket 
unit would be a proper heatsink, current limiting (so a bad valve 
can not destroy the control box), and could incorporate an LED to 
flash a diagnostic code allowing a quick check of the system 
functions. In order to develop such a box, its full cost would 
have to be around $20, to insure a resale price less than $120. 
 
How many BMW's use the &quot;green strip&quot; or &quot;green box&quot; control 
system? Typical life expectancy of the VDO unit?

P.S. for BMW owners of the similar model: BMW recommends a full 
tune up, vavle adjustment, fuel pressure check, before proceeding 
with any electronic diagnoses. Also the 528's were prone to 
developing carbon deposits on the intake valves, causing 
driveability problems [they developed a system to &quot;walnut blast&quot; 
the intake valves, with the intake manifold removed].

&lt;/listing&gt;

Hats off to someone who could FIX one of those boxes

Heres my knowledge of the coding of said ICUs/ICVs

             Early Unit     Recall              Current
  Engine     (Recalled)   Replacement            Unit

  1.8l       blk/blk    blk(grn stripe)/blk     grn/yel
  
  2.8l                                          grn/red (looks purple to me!)

  3.5l                                          grn/blue

              The color is Body/Connector

   Early ICV's were black plastic with INTERNAL current adjust

   Newer ICV's are silver with external current adjust



  BEWARE .. some parts places and dealers are selling BLACK boxes
            with yel/red/blue ends these are NOT the current and
            best option ... the green (olive green) bodied boxes
            are purported (by CCA tech tip reps) to be the BEST
            as they are designed to NOT burn out (as much)

&lt;/listing&gt;
