&gt; Hi Pattie.  Yes, in Canada, these were available.  There's a

&gt; &gt; A few years ago I saw an ad for a Synchro Crew Cab pickup and wondered if
&gt; &gt; anyone else has heard of this and if it was ever imported into the U.S.  I
&gt; &gt; think the ad appeared in a Northern California nickel want ad type
&gt; &gt; publication.

coast this past summer. It was from canada and can be seen in db&amp;hvw.
