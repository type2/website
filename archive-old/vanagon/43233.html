I ain'tz no scientist but my understnading of icocynates (spelling once aagin??) 
Is that they are only an issue if you are &quot;breathing them in&quot;. Can't rmeber what 
Union Carbide nuked the Indian Villagers with but I have painted (albeit with 
proper breathing apparatus)POR-15 with no I'll affects.

I paint it on with a paint brush and I think that is more benign that sparaying 
it where the stuff is more likely to be ingested breathed in etc.

The bottom line to me is _wear some proper breathing equipment_ and BTW one of 
those $0.99 &quot;dust masks&quot; is not what I am referring to :)
