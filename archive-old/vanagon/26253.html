Howdy,

	Anyone ever use one of those cast aluminum deep oil sumps?  I had
$65 burning a hole in my pocket today so I bought one.

	It was kind of a pain to install though.  I ended up doing it
twice; here's the first routine:

drail oil
remove sump plate
remove studs
install new, longer studs (should come with it)
put permatex and gasket on sump, lift the bugger up, and now try and get the
  10mm nuts on.  I wish you luck!
try and get them tight now.  pain in the butt!
install lower studs
install sump plate
fill with oil

Second routine:

buy 12 allen bolts, 6 1/2&quot; long, 6 1&quot; long, and allen wrench (5mm)

drain oil 
remove sump plate
remove studs
put permatex and gaskets on
lift the sump up, and start one of the long allen bolts to hold it
put the rest of the allen bolts in (easier than studs)
tighten (easier than doing the nuts! )
put sump plate on with short allen bolts (easier than studs!)
fill with oil.

I chose to use allen bolts because the threads are a little sloppy on the
sump.  I bought the BugPack one.

It may be my imagination, but the engine _sounds_ different now.

It also holds 5 quarts of oil now!
