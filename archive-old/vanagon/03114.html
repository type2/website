For us newbies to the net, would it be possible for someone to put
together alist of what additional Vaanagon information is available to readers and how to
get it?

For example I hear a lot about FAQ's, webservers, gif, gaffes and
guis, headers (not mufflers) and so and so on but am
unsure how to get a hold of this stuff. Ideally we should each be able
to store this info for further consultation when we need it most.
