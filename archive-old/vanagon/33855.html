&gt;Ooops! a thousand apologies for my haste. Can you forward that last one to
&gt;the list?

No prob, Jim!  Its on its way.

As far as your oil pressure goes, you are probably due for a rebuild soon.  A
few things to try first.

Change the oil and filter.  Replace it with 20W-50. The thicker oil should
help increase the pressure.  Full flow oil system should also help.  If your
pressure goes up after the oil change, it will be only a matter of time until
the bearings (crankshaft, camshaft, &amp; rod; don't forget to replace the oil
pump face plate,too) need to be replaced.  A full tear down. 

Also, watch the engine temperature.  Running the oil through the engine
doesn't break down the oil.  It is the HEAT caused by the friction of the
engine components.  If the engine temp gets above normal it will prematurely
break down the oil.  One brief overheating session can completely kill a
batch of oil.
