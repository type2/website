Guess it's time for my two cents. Back in 86 I was looking where I wasn't
going and managed to rear end an 84 Camaro with my 84 Vanagon GL. Wasn't
going too fast and I think I missed the brake, anyway, the Camaro was
totaled and the Vanagon was still driveable altho the steering was
difficult.  repairs were somewhere around $2300 as I recall, mostly
cosmetic.  Of course my wife and I were wearing our seat belts. I was
unhurt and Jo Ann sustained a &quot;sternum bruise&quot; form the shoulder belt
(much better than a head thru the windshield). The drivers seat in the
Camaro collapsed and she ended up in the back seat, shaken, but not
bruised!!

Moral: Do not spend too much time looking in a direction you are not
moving.
