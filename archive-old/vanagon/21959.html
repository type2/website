Subject: 60 Kombi mods


I am currently having an engine built for me for a '60 Kombi that I am
getting.  The engine is a short block 1600.... can the stock exhausts from
the old bus be fitted onto the newer engine?  I would like an all &quot;original&quot;
exterior and interior look to the van but have the power of a newer motor.
I am also new to the game of VW bus managment so any help here will be much
appreciated.  Thanks
