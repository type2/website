seven junk yards all having two or more Vanagons on their grounds. But all
Vanagons had stripped the hole engine, including the expansion tank. It
seems that all frequently used parts will find their way to eastern Europe.=


I arrived at the eights: Yes, we just got one (a Vanagon) this morning. We

It was an '87 Diesel Panel Wagon used by a plumber. Everywhere dings, dashe=

put the tank out, happy to find one after weeks of unsuccessful search. I
paid the amount (10 USD) the owner asked for.

Back home I recognized that I bought an VW expansion tank (KTO 068 121 405 =

and a MBZ lid (124 500 01 06). Here is my question:

Does someone have experiences with this combination? What's about the =

which is regulated by this lid?
