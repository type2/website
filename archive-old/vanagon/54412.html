Subject: Re: diesel engine cover

 
&gt;Yet another question...should I have the tin pan installed under the 
&gt;diesel engine on my 82 Vanagon ....Does it serve any purpose besides drip
pan.
&gt;My wife tells me I sound like a dumptruck leaving the house..could this help
with 
&gt;the outside noise???  If I need to install ...how and where does the pan
attach 
&gt;to the bottom side of my van...

  After running awhile with the cover off while checking for oil leaks, I
would 
suggest that you will be able to set your radio volume on 9 instead of 10
while driving
on the freeway if you put the cover back on.  There should be some foam
blocks
wired to the lower pan which serve to muffle noise.   I have added extra foam
to 
the engine compartment of my '83 to reduce rear passenger complaints.

  It should be attached with about (6)  10 mm nuts and bolts and about 8 or
so 
sheet metal screws.  There are holes for (3) nuts and bolts on each side of
the
frame supports that run to the back bumper.  The sheet metal screws attach 
to body sheet metal or the small sheet metal cover that runs between the
muffler and the body.
