Re: Awnings, Joel requests:

&gt; 
&gt; yes, please, post the model number, colors, price, size, date of birth,
&gt; bust size, etc., etc., etc., of the awning. :) but especially the price
&gt; and size. i'm also interested in how/what/where you attach the away-from-
&gt; the-bus end of the awning. poles??
&gt;

I write with catalogue in hand:

Purchased Carefree (of Colorado) lb Sidewinder for &quot;all vans van conversions,
micros &amp; fold downs&quot;

          8' $254.00

This is the slim line manual version of their awning.

Carefree lb Freedom is the fancy crank model (1 person does easily) larger case
model. Larger and heavier than I wanted, although features are nice if you
travel alone or are &quot;older&quot;.

          8' $631.00

You pay for ease of use.

Both models take the same mounting brackets:

          VW Transporter Brackets:
          Pre-1993 (Westfalia/Vanagon) set of 3 (catalogue says 2) $51.00
            these clamp on to the gutter, no bolts into the body
          1993 and newer (Eurovan) set of 2 - these have 3 bolts 
            that bolt into your Eurovan body                       $51.00

Saw one on a Eurovan several years ago - that's where I got the idea to look
for this brand. It was a dealer option in our area.

They come in an array of colors - stripes from dark shade to lighter shade as
you go toward van. I have had Black/Grey on both my '91 Westies as they were
Flash silver and now Pastel white. They also come in solids.

Extend a full 6.5 feet out. You can have the side brackets mounted on the body.
I never did. I place the &quot;legs&quot; at an angle or at differing heights if raining
for runoff. I use shock cords from awning corner to nylon rope tethered to
tent stake to hold mine in moderate wind. In severe wind you really need to
take it down! In Windy Waterton the first night as the Shinook winds came
rooling up the lake for repeated direct hits EVERYONE was out in their sleep-
ware (or lack thereof) snaging their awnings down before complete lose!

Purchased mine from:

LongView RV SuperStores
891 N. King Street
Northampton, MA 01060
800-967-7856

If you call or order a catalog, tell Judy Parts that I recommended them.
(I get no $ for this - just a nice thought)
Their catalogue is 432 pages long, including 42 pages on awnings and patios.

My awning shipping case is addressed from:

Carefree of Colorado
2145 W 6th Ave
Broomfield, CO 80020
Sorry - no phone #

I don't know if they sell direct.

We have been really pleased with ours. Absolutely no problems, with adjustments
mentioned in earlier posting. We especially like the slim trim line of this
awning over the bulkiness of many others we have seen. Some have much bulkier
aluminium cases that look far too large and awkward for the Westy.

Good luck!
