&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 	I am looking at a '89 Syncro Westy and I cannot find a button to
&gt; operate a locking rear differential.  The salesman says that in '89 they
&gt; went to a automatic locking differential.  Is this true?  I have never
&gt; heard of it.  If it is true is there any way to tell that it does in
&gt; fact have this auto lock?  Also what would be a good price for this Van?
        Auto lock  Axle?????   Right!

        LOcking differentials are an option!  If it has one, the button
        is below the radio.  I have never heard of an automatic lock!
