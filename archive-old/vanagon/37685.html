&gt; AS it is Friday, and I got back from an actually pleasant visit at the DMV, I
&gt; thought I'd bring up the thread on personalized license plates, specifically
&gt; those relating to VW's. You can gain a lot of insight into folks from their
&gt; plates, even from the fact that they went to the trouble of getting one...
&gt; Anyway, my old one was:
&gt; 
&gt; OLDNDWAY
&gt; and the new one is
&gt; NFA 4295  (a &quot;stealth&quot; hippie plate so as to avoid a bit of hassle)
&gt;
Well, Bertha (my 78 Westfalia camper) is FAR from &quot;stealth&quot;! :)
She's quite the art gallery on wheels...so to speak. My personalized 
plates read: GR8TFUL
Nothing left to do but, :) :) :)
