I don't think this will work.  To quote from '68-79 Bentley for Busses,

    &quot;Prior to the models covered by this maual, the Type 2 front axle was
similar to the front axle of the Volkswagen Beetle.  However, beginning with
the 1968 models, the front axle for the Type 2 vehicles was completely
redesigned. Although it employs the same operating principles as the earlier
axle, every part of the new unit differs in size and shape.&quot;

As a result I think you are out of luck.  The mounting points almost
certainly differ and I know from experience the trailing arms are much
bigger on the later axle. (and tougher to remove, too)

What *might* work is to find a late beetle front end, with disks, and swap
it in.  Alternatively, a variety of disk brake conversion kits have been
produced for the Beetle, which might fit.  (some of these kits also
&quot;lowered&quot; the front end, an interesting possibility for correcting rear-end
sag).  Not having any experience with the disc brake era bugs, I do not know
if there was any provision for power assistance.  If not, you may want to
take a second think about this, as disc brakes take considerably more pedal
pressure than drums.
