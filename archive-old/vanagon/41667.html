Subject: RE: drum brake adjustment

Perosnally, after first sheering the head off a sears 1/2 drive, (using a 
rented 36mm socket, 1/2 dirve), i decided to go ahead and spend the money 
on the 3/4 drive&lt;my dad had given me a 3/4 36mm, but i didnt have 
anything to fit that..&gt; flex handle...(their name, not mine..) that too 
was a returned i tem, with a sheered head..twisted right off...so i got 
the 20$ cheaper slide handle...a nice 5 or 10 foot cheat on that, and had 
no plroblems since..except for a little excess PSA, and stisted the gland 
nut apart..:(..luckilly, NOPI was still open..although, the first time i 
did my axel nuts, i borrowed from a friends dad a 3/4 drive to use with 
the socket..a 5 foot long TORQUE WRENCH. needless to say, i reset the 
torque the way it was supposd to be..oh well..enough rambling.

&gt; &gt;in regards to the poundy thing (there must be a name for it (I call it a
&gt; &gt;poundimiform, actually), i also have a pair of sockets in the appropriate
&gt; &gt;sizes, 3/4 &quot; drive, a slider breaker bar the same, also a converter to 1/2&quot;
&gt; &gt;so  i can use it with the 1/2&quot; ratchet or breaker bar, as the urge strikes,
&gt; &gt;but the poundymiform is cheaper to buy than that pile of stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; When an axle nut and I couldn't reach agreement, I went to a local welding
&gt; shop and had them weld a 3/4&quot; drive bit at right angles, to the end of a
&gt; five-foot long, quarter-inch wall mild steel pipe. Haven't lost an argument
&gt; with an axle nut since.   :^)
