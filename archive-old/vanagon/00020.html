Subject:  Reply-to field

I say leave it as &quot;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;, because of two reasons:

#1: When I want to reply to the list as a whole, I don't remember that long
address!

#2: When I want to reply to a message, usually I *DO* want to send it to the
whole list. After all, I'm sure that there's more than one person interested
in the question. If not, at least my message will be archived so that when
someone else comes along, they'll be able to access it. 

Your take on it, list members?
