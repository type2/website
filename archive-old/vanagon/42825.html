&gt;Keyword, ammeter.  Dave had 2 batteries that he used to run his fridge all
&gt;weekend.  When he ran the engine the batteries started charging, pegged the
&gt;meter, and it then ceased functioning.  But Dave is the one that can talk
&gt;about his follies best. :)

Ok!  I did not see that one.  I also did not realize he was trying to charge
two batteries plus the original.  He was probably also running the fridge!!
Seems like this combination is to much load for the alternator.  Hi capacity
resistors probably best way to control charging current.  I can calculate
values if you want to perform this task.  Radiator fan resistors would work
great for this purpose.  Let me know if you want me to do calcs. for you.
