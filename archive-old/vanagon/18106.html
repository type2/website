Terry,

If you connect a pair of 6v deep cycle batteries in series you will find a
small current exists between them.  The batteries are different chemical
entities, the current flow their effort to achieve equilibrium.  This current
may be quite large with batteries of different ages, temperatures, etc.
 Almost unnoticed in the series links between individual cells (as with the
large batteries used in submarines, telephone exchanges and power-plants),
this problem becomes quite serious as the battery potential rises.  When
dealing with 6v batteries you will find it necessary to isolate them when not
under charge so as to prevent the stronger from discharging into the weaker
(at least, to the point of equilibrium).

There is a wealth of information available on this problem and various ways
to solve it, available from Excide, Delco, the phone company (internal
bulletins &amp; instructions), the U. S. Navy and other users of lead-acid
storage batteries.
