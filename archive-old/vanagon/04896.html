The vehicle:  71 bus
The problem:  (well, not sure if I have one or not) - here's 
the story:

I've seen the recent experiences and horror stories about 
steering which were posted here, and I've been under my bus 
(several times), plus done a lot of reading.  Still unsure of 
this centered-wheel 'transition zone'.  My steering seems fine 
except for the centered position.  There is about a 
half-to-three-fourths-inch movement of the wheel at this point 
where nothing happens.  Oh, the input shaft into the steering 
box moves, but it doesn't translate into any movement on the 
output shaft.

The result of this when driving can be a little unnerving, as 
you go around a gradual turn and pass thru this zone, the wheel 
gives the fleeting sensation that it has 'slipped'.

I've adjusted the steering box play - and this adj has no 
impact on the center transition area of wheel travel -- only 
the tightness of the overall steering wheel rotation.  This 
adjustment is AOK on my bus.

The Bentley book actually talks about this 'phenomena' and 
refers to a 'normal' transition sensation as the wheel passes 
thru the center point.  However, the book description is vague 
and I can't tell if I have a problem or not.  Further, I've 
never had a vehicle where you could actually tell the steering 
center position - while turning the steering wheel - from any 
other point on the wheel's rotation.  So I have nothing to 
compare this with.

Anyone want to give a shot at how the center position should 
feel when it's 'normal'?

Thanks in advance
