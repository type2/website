Subject: Brake booster hose

Three days later Jim remembers part of his weekend:  Saturday I 
stopped at the local German car specialist and asked if they had the 
vacuum hose for the brake booster on my '71 bus.  He said they didn't.
He said I needed metal reinforced hose.  The regular stuff would 
collapse.  He said to check with the FLAPS.  So, I checked at the 
FLAPS.  He said what I needed was hydraulic line hose.  This comes in 
the size I need and is metal reinforced.  $3/ft.  Is this what we are 
after?  I haven't measured mine but this sure seems cheaper than the 
nearly $200 somebody said the dealer wanted for this thing.  Anybody 
else running some different with any success?  I am thinking this is 
what I will use to replace mine.  Thanks, Jim
