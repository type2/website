Subject:       205/70 or 205/75 tires

I have come across a deal where a guy has offered to give me $150 and 
a set of 5 brand new tires in exchange for my crappy old cutlass.  I 
currently have 205/70-14 tires on the back of the '72 and they work 
pretty well.  I have my choice of any size tire but want to stick 
with the 205s.  What is the difference between a 70 and a 75?  Isn't 
that the width as a ratio to the height or something.  If anyone out 
there knows the difference or has any preference as to which is 
better (or will fit the rims) I would be happy to hear about it.  By 
the way, I think he said the tires are light truck FTX super somthing 
or other and usually come with an 80,000mi warranty.  of course there 
are no reciepts in this transaction.  Any comments on the tires or 
sizes are welcome.
thanks.
Ed.
