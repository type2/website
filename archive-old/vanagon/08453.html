&gt;what is wrong. Like where the smoke originates. Like why the power loss. Like
&gt;why there is no smoke when the engine is first switched on, but appears after
&gt; about 30-60 seconds of revving.
&gt;I am at a bit of a loss and shall extract my Kombi from said garage as soon as
&gt; they  fix said damage (at their own cost)
&gt;Anyone out there know, guess, make up what has happened.

your valves/tappets are set way too loose ... blue smoke is invariably oil
being burnt in the cylinders.  the loose setting for the valves also is
responsible for the loss of power (the valves are not sealing properly).
if this continues, you'll have burnt valves and require replacement all round.

i'd go to a different garage, or get out the Muir book and set the valves
yourself.  it's not THAT difficult to do, but it is a bit uncomfortable and
you'll have to get down on the pavement.  takes about 30 minutes or so ...
so plan on an hour. :)
