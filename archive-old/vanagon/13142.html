&gt; : &gt;one of those. It is the first camper conversion done by Westfalia for
&gt; : &gt;the Vdubs.
&gt; : &gt; 
&gt; : &gt;Also, does anybody have any pictures etc of the clothes closet which

&gt; : &gt; 
&gt; : &gt;If you could email any responses, I would appreciate it. We aren't
&gt; : &gt;hooked up to rec.autos.vw here. Thanks in advance.

&gt; I've seen info on Westy's older than 55.  I can put you in contact with 
&gt; some experts on this subject if you'd like.

Hello Jon!

Ya, a guy named Josh Kline out of Buffalo, NY told me that a '54 was
featured in this months issue of CAMP BOX NEWS. I've never heard of
that newsletter but I asked him for their address. He said he would
send me a copy of the article.

We had heard that a '55 was the oldest known Westie from whom we
thought was somebody in the know. It was either the Prez of NEATO,
some van guy down in Phoenix or one in Sacramento. I have all their
names written down at the shop if you want to know. Though it's
disappointing not having maybe the 2nd oldest, it's cool knowing some
of the ones from '51 to '55 made it through the 60s.

I appreciate your taking the time to respond to my request. I just got
my server to hook up rec.autos.vw so that should be cool. I would like
to take you up on your offer to put me in touch with some experts. Do
you know anything about the clothes closet I asked about? How about
the camp stove or water bladder?

Though we're familiar with the '58 - '67  Westfalias, our ignorance
shows when it comes to the camp boxes. Neither I nor my partner had
ever seen one before.

Though we don't plan on selling until the restoration is complete and
we've entered in in a couple of shows, maybe you would have some idea
on its value? On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it a solid 7. It has
the original everything including ribbed bumpers, Westfalia Camp Box
Stickers, lights (all except one reflector), and complete interior. We
are the 3rd owner. We have all receipts from 1961 on. It is missing
the tent/poles/stakes. The second owner was the salesman who sold it
to the original owner. He said it did not come with the clothes
closet, water bladder, or camp stove/utensils, so short of the tent
and tool kit - it is just as it came from the factory.

It's rusted through in the normal place behind the drivers door. Front
pan is good, rear pan has a little rust (not rusted through). Some mud
on the rear driver's corner. Repaint is okay but not great. It is the
original color.

If you have any idea, I'd appreciate hearing. Had one guy offer us
$7500 the way it sits. Guy down in Arizona (New Mexico?) offered us
two rust free '57 23 windows. You think it may be one of those
&quot;whatever you can get for it&quot; kinda deals?

Well, if you can't tell, I'm pretty excited about the thing. Seems
like a pretty unique vehicle. Sorry if I bored you with  all the
details but seeing as your Volkswagon people, what the hey.

I'll let you  go. Thanks again.

Regards,

P.S. You going to Bad Camberg? We're gonna take a Kombi over with us
so if you need transportation around the area, say so.

Lates,
Greg
