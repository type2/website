indicates that it is a type 23 - kombi made in model year 66,   the kombis is
what westfalia made into campers.

&quot;Liz also discovered grey cardboard headliners in the cab &quot;
this confirms it- microbuses came with vinyl(64 on)or cloth (to 63)
headliners

as a 66 rather than 67 you would have a push button on the rear hatch rather
than the latch kind you can hook your finger around to pull up.  67s have a
larger dash radio hole.  66 has a rectangular hole for the radio, and a small
round hole on each side for the knobs.  67s came with a dual circuit master
cylinder.    campers were usually one colour

i suggest that someone had your bus (66 camper) and no title to it, so used
the title and tag ffrom a junked 67 deluxe.    whether or not they welded
bits together i dont know.   buses do not have separate pans like beetles do.
