&gt; &gt;I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would

&gt; Like the the other magazines devoted solely to the pursuit of vanity (read:
&gt; women's magazines) the nameless Porsche mag is filled with countless ads
&gt; and virtually no articles. So there you can check prices for carburetors
&gt; and rebuilds and heater boxes ($600--they're stainless) and other things.
&gt; Why would he sell a good Porsche engine for $250 when the case alone is
&gt; worth far more than that?

True, a Porsche 911 engine has a core value of somewhere around $2000, 
but he said 914.  The engine in the 914 was also what is called a type IV 
engine.  The 1700 engine only has a core value of about $400.  I believe 
the Porsche 914 was actually sold as a VW in Europe.

Also, you can't rebuild a 2 liter type IV engine for $250... you'd be 
lucky to get just a piston/cylinder set for that much.

As for Bob, I wouldn't bother with the engine.  There's not much from it 
that would work with a 2 liter engine.  You won't be able to just bolt up 
the FI stuff.  I think you should be able to bolt it up to your tranny, 
but that won't do a lot of god unless it comes with the carbs and air 
cleaner.
