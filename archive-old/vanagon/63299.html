Subject:      euro spec lights?!

Hi All,

Any fixup of the lights beyond increasing the wattage of the bulbs is
going to cost $$$.  Cleaning up the lenses in the dishwaher sounds like
the berick there. Several mentions of burned wiring with the higher
output bulbs (unless heavier wiring added)

 For $70US  a nice set of Bosch Pilot driving lights will light up the
road a lot further. Comes with a proper gauge wiring
harness/switch/relay, you just need to lead off from the fuse panel. My
$0.02

Bye, Tim
