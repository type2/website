Subject: '77 AC belt size?

Hello Everyone,
	
	We just pulled the engine/transmission so we could replace the 
clutch and have decided now would be a good time to play with the air 
conditioner as well.  If anyone knows the size of the belt that goes to 
the compressor please tell us.

Thanks in advance.
