Subject: Re: EV paint finish rust

We've got a few of the &quot;pin-prick&quot; spots mentioned by Ric Golen, but the EV
is still miles better (in the paint department) than our refugee from
Puebla ('92 GTI)....

BTW the 6/97 issue of &quot;Automobile&quot; has what it claims is the latest on the
new &quot;Beetle&quot;, with pics &amp; interviews with assorted VW board
members/sales/engineering types.
