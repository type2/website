&gt;&gt;I have a fairly loud and annoying squeek coming from the rear of the Westy
&gt;&gt;(77). I think I've narrowed it down to the rubber suspension bushes on the
&gt;&gt;spring plate covering the torsion bar.
&gt;
&gt;Replace the bushing with a new one.

&gt; Not a difficult project. 


Could whoever (Thom?) &quot;customized&quot; their thumb when the spring plate got
loose please repost that story?  I have been real leery of touching the rear
spring since reading that.
