Subject: Re:  Carb problems (34 PICT 3)

&gt;Soo, My 71 wouldn't start the other day, and I figured out that the carb was 
&gt;filled up with loads of little flakes, like rust.  I still can't figure out 
&gt;how it got past the filter.  Anyhow, I got the carb cleaned, and reinstalled 
&gt;it.  Now, it drools gas from the throttle shaft, on the side with the cable. 
&gt; This isn't good.  It also has a hard time starting, you have to floor the 
&gt;pedal to get it started.  I'm almost sure that this is due to a real rich 
&gt;mixture, as all that gas is just sitting there.  Anyone got any ideas?  Take 
&gt;it apart again?  I dunno.  I guess I'll clean the other one and swap it out. 
&gt; Thanks all.
Sounds like gas is getting by the float.  Check the float to see if it's got
a hole in it (in a cup of water, eg.) and that the needle valve is working.
You can do that by taking off the top of the carb and turning it upside down.
Press down lightly on the needle and you shouldn't be able to blow through
the fuel inlet tube.  Also make sure the hinge pin thing for the float is
installed correctly, along with the plastic thing that sits on it.  Less
likely is that you're using the wrong thickness of gasket under the needle
valve, but I wouldn't think it would be THAT dramatic.

Or just tap on the side of the carb with a screwdriver handle and see if that
fixes it.  :)
