&gt;I have an '87 Vanagon which was stalling intermittingly.  When it stalled,
&gt;it did it sudddenly and completely. Sometimes it would re-start immediately,
&gt;sometimes not.  In any event, the problem was tracked down to the ECU unit.
&gt;A new unit was intalled at a very hefty cost.  The van runs better now.  It
&gt;doesn't stall, but occassionally, particularly under load, it stutters and
&gt;hesitates. 
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone had a similar experience?  Is it possible that this new computer
&gt;unit is faulty?

ECU failed after head gasket replacement!!  Seems strange to me.  Have all
grounds been correctly reinstalled.  Are all sensors properly connected.  ECU
failure on these is very very very rare. I,ve only seen one and it happened
after a big booster battery charger was used to start van.  Battery chargers
are bad for the ECU for two reasons,  high voltage,(over 16 volts is deadly),
and AC ripple(battery chargers do not produce pure dc).  The ripple
componentscan destroy the ECU quickly. Ripple is that wierd hum you here when
using these things and trying the starter with it connected. Any way,
somthing still isn't right.  Have mechanic check instalation with fine tooth
comb and wiring diagram.
