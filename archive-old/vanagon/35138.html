  You're not joking about the valve guides. I've got two 2000cc type IVs
  and both came to me in need of a rebuild because at least half a valve
  guide had been bounced around the head. The piston crown in each case 
  looked like a relief map of the Himalaya's and in one engine the bits had 
  managed to make their way into the ajoining cylinder too. I don't know 
  why this engine seems partial to doing this, but checking them during a 
  rebuild may stop an expensive crunch later.
