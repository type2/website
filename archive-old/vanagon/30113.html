You can go to a VW dealer but JC Whitney has it for about $30.

JC Whitney and a couple of advertisers in the VW mags have these.  I've never
seen any at a dealer.

I don't know how well or quietly they work, I don't drive the '72 Westy in

Being on this list you will certainly find out a lot!  Most of it even about
VWs.
