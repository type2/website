Subject: Re: Eurovan prices

My apologies to those who saw my similar message on 
rec.automakers.vwwatercooled. 

Over the past year (yes, it is an obsession) I've been shopping for a 
Eurovan. While I know VW dealers are going to be more than non-VW 
dealers, and dealers in general are more expensive than individuals, it 
seems the Eurovans command premium prices beyond blue book and competing 
vans' prices.

Are the EVs so scarce that they are collectors items and warrant higher 
prices? For example, Carter VW in Seattle has a web page listing with a 
number of EVs at close to their original prices! (Or do the dealers know 
that VW people, especially VW Van people will not settle for another brand?)

I would be interested in other's experiences in purchasing (or selling) 
Eurovans. What I would like to know is what were the selling prices vs. 
the asking prices, the milage of EV GLs and MVs and if those vehicals has 
extra options like ABS. Maybe with this data I can find out if I'm 
unrealistic or the dealers are.

Thanks,
Matt Dekker                          			    mdekker_at_eskimo_dot_com
&quot;My liability for this posting is limited to exactly what you paid me for it.&quot;

P.S. I am primarily interested in working with VW dealers because I'll 
probably trade in a low milage Golf III. (snif.)
