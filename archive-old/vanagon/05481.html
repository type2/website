&gt;A friend of mine has an 84 GL (water cooled and air conditioned) and
&gt;he was wondering what was the best dollar to mileage value on a
&gt;muffler.
&gt;He replaced his about 40k ( highway miles) ago with a $100 muffler
&gt;and he is due for another already.  He seems to think this is too soon
&gt;for it to have to be replaced and I sorta agree with him.

i don't know ... my original muffler lasted only 60,000 miles and the
replacement from the dealer (!) was $316 ... and that's WITH a discount
(the original price was over $500!!) and did NOT include the gaskets and
a new $50 tailpipe!!!

my point being that my new muffler will have to last at least 120,000 miles
to get the same value as your friend's 40k/$100 muffler ... and i don't
think mine will last that long. plus it's louder than the old one.

i don't think i'm gonna get another one from the dealer ... i might just
suck it up and go to Midas or someone. :(
