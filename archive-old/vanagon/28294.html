Subject: Parallax T&amp;A

Having spent some of the last 6 months subscribed to
BELIEF-L discussion list, I have to wonder if some of it has
spilled over to the VANAGON list.

*Stock* people out there:  isn't is criminal to cut up a
split window bug to make a dune buggy?

*Custom* people out there:  isn't it a pain that old VWs
just have that one speaker in the dash when a killer stereo
is what you crave?

Parallax: any apparent displacement of an object do to an
observer's position.  Taken less literally, each of us is
looking at a subject, any subject, from a different point of
view.

While we are  discussing T&amp;A in VW magazines, I think we all
need to be tolerant and recognize that to some cutting a
hole in the dash for gauges is acceptable and for others it
borders on blasphemous.  There is enough degredation on both
sides to go around.  For every sex-sell add or bimbo
prictorial in DB&amp;HVWs, there is a guy in Cosmo (or whatever)
who wears a tux and dishes out $10,000 diamonds.  He has
nothing to do with the nail polish being sold, but he is
there.  Personally, I find *that* degrading, so I don't read
the magazine.

And all of this is IMO, of course.  Anyway, what's all this
fuss about T&amp;A?  Trannys &amp; Axles are an integral part of
buses.  Where would we be without them?  Certainly not off
with some (hair color of your choice here) (sex of your
choice here) having a good time.

My $0.03 worth....sorry, inflation and all.
