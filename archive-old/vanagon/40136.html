&gt;&gt;I can buy a STAMP computer
&gt;&gt;from Parallax right now for $39, and it has 8 DAC I/O ports. To boot, it's
&gt;&gt;programmable in Basic and it's about the size of a business card.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Huh? Wha? Where can I get one of these? What sample rates?
&gt;
&gt;I always react that way when someone tells me about a new toy. Can I
&gt;get som more info on it, from you?   :^)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;  Hey, I like this idea. But don't we need A to D, not DAC?  Can
&gt;  you send me  the details on the stamp card address, 8 DACs would
&gt;  control a robot nicely  :)  TIA, Tim Smith


Hi Steve/Tim,

Yeah Tim, you're right A to D is correct. My typing just got ahead of my
thinking. As far as specs, I dunno on these things. Just kind of caught my
eye, and got me to thinking about what I could do with it if I stuck it in
my car.

What do you think Steve, can you think of some various sampling points on
yer vehicle that you'd like to monitor (like clutch plates?) ;-)
