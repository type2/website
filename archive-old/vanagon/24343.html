Subject: Re: Syncro brake rotors/VW dealer deals, :'(

Hi folks,

Can someone please tell me the price and source for these, if a non-VW 
supplier exists?.  $190Cdn each for rotors that look identical to all 
breadloaf rotors is a bit high. 

Oh and the dealer/VW network is up to its expected tricks. UAP wanted $88 
for a set of pads, VW wanted $66, so I ordered them 3 weeks ago. They're in, 
and they are now $108, a $42 increase, ie. 2/3 more expensive than before. 
They know me and didn't take a deposit, and they won't honor the original deal.
         I'm on the 1-800 number as I type, they are on another line to my 
dealer. This is now to VWoNorthAmerica, Auburn Hills, Mich.  Ah we're back 
live now, &quot;yada yada yada&quot; this persons personality matches the muzak I was 
listening to, well done VW!... 
        And the answer is..... &quot;I'll get back to you&quot; We have a weiner! So I 
mentioned that this was a breach of contract, I take the matter seriously, I 
expect a quote to be honored..... I'm sure she'll get back to me, she 
sounded sooo concerned. I preferred the old VWoCanada Customer Rep, 
politness wasn't his strong point but he was listening. (I think).
        Told them big brother Vanagon_at_lenti will be informed also. Think of 
it, 488 angry van owners storm the place en mass, circle their headquarters 
3 deep! We can starve them into handing out the parts we need cheaply. &quot;.... 
next we take Auburn?&quot; Leonard Cohen couldn't have said it better, could he? 
Gotta get some sleep, and stop chugging expresso, grrrrr. This weekends work 
shot, annual motor vehicle inspection will likely fail me, double grrrrr.
