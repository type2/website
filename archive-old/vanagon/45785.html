Subject: volkswagen song (f)

just had to share this with you all

i got a call this evening from a friend who had a flat tire on her bus and
found out she didn't have the spare with her.   so i trundled downtown with a
spare and the tire tool (impact 19mm socket on long 1/2 drive flex handle) to
help out

on the way i turn the radio on and this guy is singing about driving down
hill in his bug, no his bus, no his bug, in his Volkswagen.

driving in the snow, in the rain, in the slush, driving in his Volkswagen!

it's a squareback it's a fast back, it's a bug, it's a bus, it's a karmann
ghia, it's a thing, it's a Volkswagen!

it's a 58', '59, '60,'61, it's a Volkswagen!

he's going to the grateful dead show in his bus, in his Volkswagen!

it's a '68, '69, '70, '71......

you get the idea.   when i got home i called up the station, and it's called
Volkswagen Song by the Orange Astronauts.   kinda cheesy funky pseudo
harmonica

i felt like the guy in the idiot book in the bug with the big sh*teating grin
on his face.   :)
