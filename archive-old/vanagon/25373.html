Subject: Fuel Rails ?

VW Australia has just recalled all '90,'91,'92 and '93 Transporters to 
have fuel lines , rails and injectors replaced. They give the reason that 
water is entering the fuel system through fuel lines and rusting the inside 
of the fuel rails.
Has anyone had the fuel rails off their vehicle recently?
I had the rails off mine a few years ago and I am almost positive that 
they are moulded plastic!
But if VW want to replace the fuel system on my cars who am I to 
argue!!!!!!!! its just got me curious.
