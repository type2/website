Subject: Re: Stinky Seats!!!

&gt;I repeat help...  I have tried a lot of different thinks to try to the animal 
&gt;smell out of my Vanagon.  I am growing desperate!!

So are your friends I bet!  Try a pet store for urine remover.  Maybe buy a
carton or two of those cardboard pine tree air fresheners and hang them all
over the van.  Tell your friends you just love Christmas sooo much, meantime
pick up some 'Depends' or swap that seat for a Porta-Potti :) Tim Smith
