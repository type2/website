&gt; just what exactly does everybody want in a FAQ??? and should we have a
&gt; FAQ for T1 buses, another for T2 buses, T3, and T4 buses? or by engine
&gt; types (1950-1971, 1972-1983, 1983.5-1991, 1992-?)? or what?

Sources for unusual parts and accessories:

awnings
deep cycle batteries
propane auxiliary heaters
solar power parts and information
other

known defects/problems of a repetitive nature, like the elec. modules, etc.

Best ways to obtain better service and resolve problems with VW 
dealers/distributors

Sources of information

Lists of email addresses of similar vehicles (all Westies 85 - 89) or 
whatever makes sense so that people with a given problem could opt to 
email a question to just those with similar models.
