Subject: Re: Whistle sound--Gland nut??

Much thanks to all of you who replied to my whistle-noise post.  I do hope 
that it is the TO bearing, however I'll be keeping all your suggestions in 
mind when I get to yanking the engine for one reason or another.  At this 
point I'll try to play the wait and see game to see if the sound changes or 
if problems arise before I do any pulling.  I'll post the fix if I do find 
one.

Hey, if I'm lucky this noise might double up as one of those deer warning 
whistles.  But with my luck it's probably a deer mating call--(bad memories 
of deer collision in my poor old 70 Westy).
Thank you!
