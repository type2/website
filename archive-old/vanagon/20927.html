Subject: Rear wheel bearings/joints - help needed

My 85 bus has developed a nasty noice in the rear wheels somewhere.
It is a rumbling sound that is especially loud when driving above 75 km/h.
Sometimes there has been more of a knocking sound as well.

It goes away when I turn right, but I can't keep on doing that if I 
want to get somewhere... 

The sound seems to be getting worse and the local VW shop here suspected
the wheel bearings. But they have all the staff but one guy away on 
vacation (you can't get anything done in Sweden in July...) so they 
can't look at it. And I wanna get movin. I can get parts there though.

So I thought I should hear with you people on what it can be and 
if I dare to look into fixing it myself. I've done mechanical fixes
before but always been a bit shy about the running gear stuff, don't 
wanna loose an wheel suddenly due to a mistake.

I have an 81 bus as well, not running, so if the parts are the same
on 81:s and 85:s I can take some from that one.

I have the Running Gear Workshop Manual (June 1985, missing bulletins) 
and it shows the whole (?) procedures. But it refers to a zillion 
specialized VW tools though that I don't have. What do you guys use instead
to get bearings and seals out and in?

(BTW, my bus can be seen at http://www.stacken.kth.se/~clindh/gif/newbus.gif.
 You can't hear the nasty noice though...)
