Subject: Re: Steering Locks

&gt;&gt;they made optional ones for all years until they were standard (69?).
&gt;
&gt;My '73 doesn't have one.
&gt;- - - -
&gt;
&gt;however, the 73 i had did have a steering lock.  also, 69 is the first year
&gt;for steering locks for beetles.      anyone know more?

In Holland a steering lock on a bug is kinda rare too, most '77/'78/'79
Busses i've seen had steeringlocks, as did all post '70 convertibles i've seen,
but then most of these were Cal import.
