&gt;I'm wondering how to utilize the recall info. in the list archives. There
&gt;are a number of terms I'm not familiar with, and I'm not really familar
&gt;with the process or procedures of recalls. Like, How do we determine when

a recall is a government mandated program to fix a problem on a certain car.
the manufacturer has to exert a &quot;reasonable&quot; effort to contact all purchasers
of those cars (notice the big mess on the voluntary Chrysler recall of their
minivans, for the rear hatch lock, going on now: big tv ads). now, even if
you bought yours used, vw still has to perform the recall IF it was not
already done to that vehicle.

&gt;our particular vehicle was built.... within a given year, how do we know
&gt;if our particular vehicle is subject to a recall notice, and does either
&gt;the dealer or Vw America have a firm duty to fix the problem or is it
&gt;elective on their side? What if we weren't contacted ever about a problem
&gt;seemingly mentioned in the recall bullentins of the archive?

the VIN is the key. the recall program will specify which VINs are subject
to needing the recall (usually cause they &quot;fixed&quot; the problem in the assembly
line at some point, and all vehicles after VIN xxx come from the factory with
the &quot;fix&quot;). and yes, VWOA has a duty/obligation to fix the problem. it's not
an elective. they must fix the VEHICLE. even if you were never contacted.
some dealers, however, can be assholes about this, just as they can be about
warranty work on a new car. so it pays to shop around for a dealer who is
more willing.

&gt;Below is a sample record applicable to the 1985 Westphalias (I presume)
&gt;which also is a problem I've experienced with the sliding passenger door.
&gt;No one from VW mentioned anything to me. Is it too late? Should they fix
&gt;it still?

if yours is in the VIN range, AND has not already been fixed (VW can tell,
because the dealers are supposed to send some paperwork back about which
ones were fixed). you can call that NHTSA 800-number and get the paperwork
on your year/model. you will also get a little postcard that you mail to VW
with your VIN, and VW has to respond about ALL recalls on your car (whether
or not they apply to your VIN, and whether or not they have been applied).
there is also supposed to be some sort of sticker label/decal placed on the
car AND in the owner's manual concerning any recalls performed on the car.

&gt;1985 Vanagon Built from 1984 Jul to 1985 May
&gt;     Campaign 85V152000 No. Recalled: 16,328

check your driver's door info sticker for the date manufactured on your
car.

&gt;     System:  Door Look.
&gt;     Vehicle Description:  Van-type Wagon and Campers.
&gt;     Description of Defect: The latch of the passenger sliding door may
&gt;                            become damaged if excessive force is used
&gt;                            to close the door.  The damaged door lock

cheap part used on the BACK side latching mechanism. simple fix with the
part.  unless your door is prone to popping open, you've likely got the
fix (unless the bozos at the &quot;fixing&quot; dealer screwed up the alignment of the
door! which they shouldn't have even touched). but check the VW and NHTSA
sources anyway. any and all paperwork that says you do or do not have or had
something is good to have. :)
