Subject: re dagnab varmits

&gt;
&gt;I left my Westfalia at a trailhead for five days and returned to find
&gt;evidence of a full blown mouse party. They seemed to prefer the instant
&gt;oatmeal, but sampled most of what was available in the main cabin area and
&gt;left their little calling cards everywhere. Anyone have any experience
&gt;varmit-proofing a Vanagon? The only possible entry points I can think of are
&gt;the fresh air intake and the battery vents. Please respond directly as I
&gt;haven't yet resubscribed after my vacation.
&gt;


They got into my EV last summer too. Found evidence the night before
getting ready to leave, set us back a few hours cleaning everything out.
We have deer mice around here, and there was another incidence of hantavirus
North of Seattle a few weeks before, so we did the full wetdown and then
wipe everything out to avoid kicking up dust.
I don't know how they got in, but they not only ate a bunch of food, they
also chewed their way through several airline liquor bottles (they're
plastic.)
As I recall, they went for the Drambuie and something else. Scotch?
Damn mice have good taste.
Since then, we've quit leaving food in the van and haven't seen them back yet.
