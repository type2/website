&gt; &gt; I've just stripped the engine from my '71 bus, thought I'd get a gallon 
&gt; &gt; or two of solvent to put in the bug sprayer, and clean the daylights out 
&gt; &gt; of everything.  The only place I've found solvent by the gallon was $20 
&gt; &gt; bucks!!!  Ouch, and WalMart doesn't have it.  Perhaps there's something 
&gt; &gt; cheaper and almost as effective on grease, like Dawn dishwashing liquid?

&gt; If you want a really good job done on your parts and don't want to get
&gt; dirty, take them all (tin especially) to a machine shop and have them
&gt; hot tanked for around $20.  Your parts will come back looking like
&gt; new and the tin will be ready to paint (black, please!).  IMO this
&gt; is the best way to do it, unless you will be needing to re-clean 
&gt; parts for some reason.


I'd like to point out that gasoline is a really good solvent and
sells for a mere $1.259 a gallon (at least it does here in San
Diego). Of course it is a little dangerous. Diesel fuel is a little
less flammable and is priced in the same ballpark.  I wonder if there
is something that could be mixed with gasoline to make it safe while
retaining its solvent properties.
