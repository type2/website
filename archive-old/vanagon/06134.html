&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sorry to hear 'bout your &quot;fun&quot; with the DMV, its refreshing to know
&gt;&gt; that DMV personnel traits are universal. As I've always said,
&gt;&gt; &quot;There are two types of assholes in the world. The intellegent
&gt;&gt; assholes become lawyers, and the stupid assholes work for the DMV.&quot;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Speaking as an intellegent asshole ;-)

&gt;Ah, I see you've never had to deal with the US Immigration and Naturalization
&gt;&quot;Service&quot;.  This is where the people who are too dumb for the DMV end up 
&gt;working.

&gt;-Jim



I stand by my original statement, but with this clarification. Those
DMV employees who become &quot;stressed-out&quot; and suffer from a personality
disorder are routinely transferred to INS.
