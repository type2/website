Subject: Re: CB placement

I had a 71 camper where I installed the CB into a homemade &quot;box&quot; or
&quot;cabinet&quot; that went between the front seats.  The top hinged and had a
piece of carpet on it so you could step on it without hurting it or
contents.  In front I installed 2 cup holders.  When you flipped up the top
it exposed the CB, microphone, and a well that also housed my cassettes,
headphones, etc.  The wiring ran under carpet, and antenna (dual) mounted
to poptop rack- make sure you run significant ground wire if antenna is
bolted to fiberglass.  Also had one of those switches that automatically
transferred speakers from radio to CB when call came in....would work great
in these &quot;quiet&quot; CB times!  MB in NJ
