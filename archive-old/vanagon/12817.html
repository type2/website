Subject: Engine swap: GTI into Diesel Westy

The next article I pulled from the basement archives about engine swaps
is from a 1989 issue of VW&amp;Porsche and covers installation of a roughly
125hp gas Rabbit engine into a 1982 Diesel Westy.  Pretty good detail,
for the type of article BUT it's 12k bytes so I hesitate to send it to
all of us.  Some encouragement from list &quot;elders&quot; would convince me, or
if you DON'T think the list should get it and you DO want a copy your-
self, private email me at kennedy_at_admin.njit_dot_edu

B.
P.S.  Also have an even older article -- Porsche 5-speed transmission into
an early breadloaf, Hot VWs, 11/75, 7k bytes.  Same deal: I don't have
a clear sense of how big a &quot;message&quot; about this type of thing we all
want to see.
