Still looking for your help.  What experience have you had with 
head gasket leakage in your in your 85 and later Vanagon?  Thanks,
Sherwin
 
&gt;I contacted VOA in reference to the head gasket seepage. (the 
&gt;bahrsleak has slowed but it is still dripping) I have an 
&gt;appointment with the zone rep and the service manager of the local 

&gt;VW dealership.  Does anyone have any ammunition or information I 
&gt;can use to convince them that it is a manufacturing problem?
