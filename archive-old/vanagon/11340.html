&gt; floormats with such a device.
&gt; 
&gt; Is ther some sort of voltage inverter/modifier that you could put in your
&gt; lighter socket to let such devices work. I know that they have such devices
&gt; to allow you to use your portable radio in the car  (i.e runs a 110 volt
&gt; appliance on 12 volt). What does everybody else think? Surely there must be
&gt; some way to get heat in the bus without having to rely on that old rusted
&gt; tube that runs the heat up from your engine to the cab.

Michael,
	It is possible, yes, but not practical.  The reason is that heaters
draw too much power to be run on electricity in the car.  Example:  The
typical electric heater like the one you describe above (for the home)
draws about 1200 Watts.  At 110 Volts (in your house) that is about a 10
amp draw, which is reasonable, but at 12 Volts, the amperage jumps to 100,
and would probably be closer to 120 after 12-120 volt conversion losses.

120 amps would drain a typical car battery in 15 minutes or less.  It is
also more than double the output of the typical VW alternator.

This should also provide us with a gentle reminder of how inefficient our
engines are, when we see how much heat they put out.
