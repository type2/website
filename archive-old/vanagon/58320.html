Subject: noisy lifter update (1.5k later)


Thanks to the many responses I recieved I was able to approach my noisy 
lifter from many angles.  Quick background:  1 lifter had always tapped 
(or loudly &quot;clacked&quot;) occasionally on startup but always went away after 
warmup.  Recently (150k) it had become unpredictable and much more 
frequent, sometimes reappearing after hard freeway driving.  I am very 
happy to say that 1500 miles later the sound is virtually completely 
gone, only occasionally now I will hear a *very* faint tapping for about 
5 seconds after startup.  Heres what I did: first, I added a can of 
&quot;Justice Bros additive, for sticky lifters and valves&quot; (thanks Volks 
Cafe).  Then I *drove* the darn thing:  I went to Big Sur 4 times in 4 
weeks (150 rt ea. time, Phieffer was nice).  Then, I changed the oil (a 
little dirtier since the additive) and installed an OE Mann filter.  I 
used my usual Castrol 20w50 GTX.  &quot;Kermit&quot; purrs now, even quieter then 
when I purchased him!  In my opinion the most important thing I did was:
1) Used Mann filter.  The old one was a South African brand, GNB or some 
3 letter initial.  
2) Used additive to clean out crud accumulated by not letting the van 
warm-up properly and (recently) less road trips.
3) Drove it!  I agree with those who said that short cold running trips 
gunk up the engine.  I cannot afford another car for commuting, so the 
solution is to take the van on the road more often.  I think I was 
forgeting how easy it is to just jump into the Westy and head-out.

The noise may never completely go away, but I can certainly 
live with it as it stands.  Also, I went to Fred's Garage in Redwood 
City, and they positively assured me that it is only the lifter losing 
pressure, that replacement is unnecessary and that it will *not* cause 
any damage or reduce performance.  
Thanks for all the help!
