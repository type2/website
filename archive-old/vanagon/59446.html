Subject: *Blink lights HOAX*

It was previously posted:

&gt;*Welcome to the new world!* =(
&gt;If you see any car driving without their lights on (at night) DO NOT blink
&gt;your lights at them. Even though you might be thinking that you are doing a
&gt;good deed in desire for saftey, you are, in fact, placing yourself in
danger.

&gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself the
&gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally left
&gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks their
&gt;lights at them intending to add to the safety factor. The good samaritian
&gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter. 

This is an urban legend hoax.  You might want to check out:
