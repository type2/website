Subject: Re[2]: Elephant Ears

     michael,
     
     &gt;hey lee: i received this message a while back, do you have the 
     &gt;address of the place that is selling the &quot;authentic&quot; elephant ears?
     
     err, I forgot, but I'll have a scan through the mags tonite. If I 
     can't find it there then they will be at next weeks Santa-Pod swap 
     meet over here. I think they're called Kdf Enterprises.
     
     cya,
     
     Lee.
