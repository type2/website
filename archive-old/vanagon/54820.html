Subject: DISTRUBUTOR FOR 91 CARAT VANAGON NEEDED

I need a distributor for a 91 vanagon carat....mine has bad bushings
which is causing it to miss most of the time on some cylinders
...cutting into right side of the cap contacts..while carboning up the
left side....alot of new cap contact gold dust on the bottom...
Does anybody have a good one to sell??

Thanks John Matchet
