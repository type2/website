Subject: CB antenna--one more time
Date: Thu, 11 May 1995 13:33:42 -0500 (CDT)

Sorry to belabor this point, but I need help making a decision: I have two
easy solutions and a not-so-easy one. The Radio Shack guy offered to check
the SWR for the new CB I purchased yesterday. The question is to which of
three posible antennas should I hook up the CB? 

1) At this time, the radio is connected to a 4-foot fiberglass antenna
attached to the left corner of the front bumper. The cable has about 1
foot of slack (in case it needs to be shortened). 

2) The alternative (which I can install in less than a minute) is my old
3-foot wire-antenna with a magnetic base. It would sit on the poptop, more
precisely on the little metal plate that holds the latch. When locked, the
latch is in contact with the frame--in case this matters. 

3) The 3rd possibility would be to hide the magnetic base under the
luggage rack, i.e. on the metal cab-roof. I would then have to drill a
hole into the (front) luggage rack for the antenna. This would be a
tedious 3-hour job (have to remove the headliner to get to the bolts that
hold the luggage rack), and I would rather not do this UNLESS someone
promises a significant improvement in range and clarity, etc.. 

Show Me (I'm from Missoura) :-)
