&gt; Hey guys, Bob Dylan DOES have to do with vanagons!  Remember
&gt; the song he wrote, &quot;Blowin' in the Wind?&quot;  You may have thought
&gt; he intended it as a philosophical commentary, but he was REALLY
&gt; talking about the &quot;automatic lange change&quot; feature of vanagons
&gt; on the SF Bay Bridge on a windy day.    ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 

Back when he wrote that, Vanagons and even Bricks didn't exist.  
I'm sure though, that he was refering to pre-'68's or 'Owls'.  :)
