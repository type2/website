To All:

Adding an oil cooler in front of the blower-housing intake serves to
distributed the heat stress across all four cylinders instead of focusing it
on #3.  But if the vehicle was fitted with a dog-house cooler I think the
wiser course is to stick with it.

If you're running an older bus and do not have the gas heater installed, you
may wish to install the cooler behind the left rear wheel well.  By insuring
the engine compartment was well sealed, installation of a pair of plastic air
scoops provides a slight overpressure whenever the bus is traveling more than
8mph (and goes up with speed).  By cutting louvers in the floor of the engine
compartment behind the wheel well, and mounting the plate-type cooler there,
sealed into a plenum chamber, the forward motion of the bus insures positive
air-flow through the cooler.  Atop the cooler I mounted a 1000 cfm fan
controlled by a thermostat.  Engine cooling is not a problem.  (And it even
has good brakes :-)

But I've found the dog house cooler to be more than adequate for engines up
to 2000cc.  I wonder if your looking at the wrong end of a problem?
