&gt; One EV at another dealer, a red GL, has only 22k miles, AC, convenience

&gt; Some interesting points about this van, while the name plate said GL, it
&gt; had grey bumpers and a sliding side window of a CL. The interior was all
&gt; cloth, so they must have run out of red bumpers that day.

I don't think the red GLs had body-colored bumpers.  I've seen two of
these, and they both had the gray bumpers.

&gt; I asked them to pull the service record which seemed pretty clean, some
&gt; pesky electrical, noise, and alingment problems, but nothing too major or
&gt; recent.

My GL had electrical problems with the instrument cluster.  Twice the
circuit board needed resoldering because the gas and temp guages would go
on and off.  Noise due to the exhaust shielding is a big problem, mainly
because the dealers seem so incompetent in finding and fixing it.  It took
me several times to convince them the noise was unusual (I think they
caused it, too) and a few more to get them to actually fix it.  This is one
of those things I'll be more than happy to take responsibility for myself
when the warranty runs out.


&gt; Thanks for you inquire, I'm glad that you found our homepage!  I hope it
&gt; was useful, any suggestions?  We currently have these Eurovans in stock:
&gt;                 93' MV green AT 43K for   $20,495

Seems like a hell of a lot to me

&gt;                 93' GL white 5spd 45K for $17,995

I only paid $366 more for mine, and it was new!

&gt;                 93' CL white AT 38K for   $14,995

Possibly too much.

&gt;                 Four 93' MV Weekenders (camper) 2 sticks 2 auto. for $23,995
&gt; I have been a little slow in updating the internet, sorry.

Seems like a hell of a lot.  I seem to remember that a new one bargain
priced at around 3K more than that.

&gt; &gt; Regarding the rumor of a VR6 Eurovan.  Volkswagen has discontinued
&gt; production plans for the U.S. indefinitely of any vans.

This confirmed???  Mine is either more valuable as a collector's item now,
or I should part with it before it breaks and I can't get parts!!!
AAAAAAHHHHHhhhh!

&gt; As far as price, I'll save you 8-10% off any of the above vans.

Gonna take more than that.  Check all the used car price guides and go back
and BE BRUTAL!  It's your money.  AND, if VW does not plan to import any
more EVs, you have to wonder if they'll support the ones that are here for
any length of time!
