Subject: RE: Eurovan tow rating

I know what you meant but this wasn;t very helpful.  The EV isn't really 
a minivan but it is a spectacular vehicle.  Oh and by the way the Sharan 
although not imported into the US IS a mini-van.

&gt;From this one sentence posted one might think the EV isn;t worth 
getting.  But it is.  Explaining why it is better than a mini-van would 
have been more helpful I think.

Sorry if this seems like I'm just a whiny pain in the butt....

&gt; Check out Chrysler, Ford, Mazda, or Toyota. Volkswagen doesn't make minivans :)

&gt;&gt; I'm considering buying a minivan.  Does anyone know what the tow rating
&gt;&gt; of the Eurovan is?  What is the engine horsepower?  Is the automatic
&gt;&gt; more or less reliable than the stick?
