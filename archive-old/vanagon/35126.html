Subject: Re: Bad Gas?.......or just a fact of life?, and what about that fridge?

&gt; Any recommendations on fixing a tempermental fridge?  It 
&gt;worked fine in the driveway at home, but when we went to use it on the 
&gt;road it wouldn't light.

   Having often prostrated myself to the great god Dometic only to find my
efforts rebuffed, I can sympathize.  Here's stuff that works for us:

  Is the fridge chilled when you attempt to light it?  Mine is IMPOSSIBLE to
light if the box has not been pre-cooled.  I plug in the night before a trip and
pack with cold and frozen Items.  I've substituted juice block size blue ice
packs for the cute little dollhouse ice cube trays.  

   We operate using 12v enroute, and switch to gas when parked for longer
periods such as a museum visit or leisurely lunch.  
   
   Since I discovered that the pilot will operate with the switch set at 12V
(which is not affected by thermostat settings) I sometimes travel with the pilot
lit and the 'stat set at 0 to save the hassle of getting it to light when I
stop.  Just crank the 'stat up &amp; down as needed.  

   Of course since it's not recommended that you leave the pilot on when
refueling, I've probably unleashed a subject for debate.
