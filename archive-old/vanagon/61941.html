Subject: $1800 Purchase 91' Carat-- Conclusion

Hello All,

   I don't mean to me syrupy, but I want to explain my gratitude for your
help to me. List members have made this project so enjoyable by explaining
a myriad of little details, that I would have worried over.  The archives
and just reading the daily mail have made me &quot;up to speed&quot; in way I could
only dream of.

  I also want to shore up my explanation on the $price$ of this project. At
first blush it appears that I got a 91 Carat Wolfsburg Limited Edition for
$1800. I did, you couldn't drive it regularly in its condition-- it needed
to be repaired. Why the body work was minimal for the type of accident, the
repairs required a first class body shop, including a frame machine, and
lots of specialized air tools.

   Since I preferred the &quot;holistic&quot; approach to the repair. In other words,
rather than straighten all the sheet metal skin, we opted to grind out all
of the factory spot welds holding the right front portion of the van
together and install a &quot;clip&quot;. The procedure is to obtain a donor van and
cut away what you don't need and then install the &quot;complete clip assembly&quot;.
We left my dash, and crash bars, bumper and upper bar, between the grills.
We cut the right A pillar below the hand grip. We completely removed the
right door attachment beam and all of the supporting beams up to the frame
rail. This constituted the main damage area.

 In all my dad and I, using up to date equipment, spent together about 80
hours to install the clip at the factory seams  No shop would have taken
this particular time consuming, but seamless approach. The result is a
&quot;repair&quot; that has been grafted into the vans structure, and MIG welded back
spot weld for spot weld. No compromises.  I'm pleased.

   The second reason this particularly van was a blessing is that I love to
see how things are made.  Believe me, I had this baby apart! (Yes I took
photos.) So my curiosity was really satisfied. I can't explain it better,
but I had a very good time.

   Lastly when I was searching the www.traderonline_dot_com database I decided
not to put my $dollar$ amount in.  Turns out some ads have creative
financing or in this case and others I might add, a very low price, that
wouldn't show up on the typical search of say $6500 - $12000, range of this
vehicle.  I found quite of few examples of good deals, if what you can do
and what it needs are similar.

 Before I purchased the van, my initial guess was that my $1800 van was
going to cost me between $4000 and $6000 actual cash dollars; the
installment plan-- pay as I go. So first I considered the repair labor, I
paid $1000 to my dad, and $350, to second shop here in OHIO to do a couple
things we ran out of time on. So far my paint, and materials have cost me
another $400. It didn't have a radio or speakers, Another variable but I
spent $1000 there.  I still face the A/C recharge or conversion. That's the
direct cost-- so far.  The getting home from Miami was integrated into my
vacation, but I still spent $500 or so additional in traveling and what
not.

  I mentioned a suspicion that some hidden fault kept this van from being
shipped to another country. I found that the &quot;conversion to handicapped&quot;
apparently ruined the driver's seat. I say apparently because dear ole dad
was able to save it. The conversion folks welded an RV style swivel base
and seat post to the seat adjustment rails. Dad spent three hours carefully
cutting away the entire affair with out a trace of damage to the seat
frame.  The other end of this beast was bolted to the wheel house sheet
metal. I spent three hours MIG welding up cracks in this non-structural
panel. What a mess. The other unknowns,the cruise control had been
disabled, the PO told me, the clock wire to the radio harness was cut,the
auto sound folks did this most likely removing the PO's system, and the
salvage folks couldn't figure out why the A/C AIR would not come on since
they got a system pressure reading. I fixed the &quot;broken&quot; items, and located
a small puncture in the front a/c evaporator, they gave me a replacement
one.  The salvage yard guy's people had the rear a/c cover off. He said the
system had pressure. When I showed him the punctured condenser he said,
Huh, my guys must of taken a pressure reading up stream from the &quot;leak&quot;--
whatever that means. All of the these little incidental plus the dirt and
removing the handicapped lift, I donated it to a low income organization,
and plugging up all of the holes reduced the demand for the vehicle is my
guess.

What I'm trying to say is that while my initial cost is still low, I had to
ante up cash to get this thing back to a condition that is sound.  No
complaints though. The real deal here is that what it needed in repairs,
body work, is my dad's forte. This in a strange way was the real sweetener
to the deal.  He retires in a couple of years,and the van project was
probably our last together. The van really suites me, color, options etc.
My current outlay sans radio is $4100 more or less.  Risk and sweat equity
balance out the cost. I figured this van would go for $6000 to $8000 on the
market, perhaps more. So this deal was perfect for me.  I'm glad I have
this story tell.  I'll end this purchase saga with a short where I'm at.

The body's ready for paint preparation. The mechanicals need the A/C system
converted and charged. The front interior has been cleaned up front, what a
pig. E-mail if you what an excellent way to really clean your own
upholstery at home.  I'll have the rest of it detailed.  The paint matches
real good, so I'm painting the front cap and the right side back to the air
intake seam and below the roof.  Reassemble the interior.  From there I
guess my expenses are relegated to ownership and operation.  Thanks again
for listening.  Looking forward to seeing and meeting as many of you as
possible.
