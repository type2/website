Subject: '87 syncro 14&quot; front trans needed

Hi listees, 

I'm looking for a front tranny with VC without diff lock for a friend ('87
syncro 14&quot;). The PO put different size tires on it... Does anyone know about
a new/used one somewhere? Many thanks in advance.

BTW, I've just changed some parts on my '89 Syncro TD e.g. bellhousing,
primary shaft, pilot bearing, clutch, headgasket, etc. Price for the parts
about 1000$ without labor. Pretty expensive! And all that (except the
headgasket) just because the PO didn't change this stupid 7$ pilot bearing
when he had the clutch redone! 

Just wanted to share my (bad) experience with the other syncro owners. If
you hear some 'metallic' noise from the rear, stop driving and check that.
I'd have avoided changing the 650$ bellhousing and 100$ primary shaft if I
had checked that first. The clutch was soaked with the gearbox oil and kind
of slippy after a while.

Anyway, thanks for your help, bye
