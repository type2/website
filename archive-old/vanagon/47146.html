&gt; The $150 bus was scooped from under an ex-'79 Westy owner who was forced to 
&gt; sell his beloved Westy when on vacate in Colorado. Posted a 'help/FS' to 
&gt; list and amazingly....  Salmon bought it for $900, claimed another $1000 to 

Actually, I received $700 for the '79.....on sale just in time for summer.
