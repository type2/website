Subject: Looking for FI&amp;heater motor for 77 bus

My newly acquired bus has had the fuel injection system replaced with a Weber carb by the PO :( The bus runs OK, but I'd like to eventually get the fi back in. It's not a huge priority, and I've only started hunting for parts. It looks as though I'll need the entire system: (fuel pump, fuel filter, injectors, pressure regulator, computer, relay for fuel pump, air flow meter, air filter and mounting hardware, intake manifold, other assorted bits?.?)

Does anyone know how many (if any) of these parts are interchangable with other years of busses, and possibly other models of VW? (ie. can I pull a fuel pump and pressure regulator off a late 70s/early 80s Rabbit?). Reasonably priced used parts are hard to come by around here for VW busses, and any straight across compatability would help me in my search.

Also, the heater blower motor (the squirrelcage in the engine compartment with the 2 tubes to the heater boxes) is shot. It would struggle to turn and then blow the fuse. I WD-40'ed the crap out of it, and it worked fine for about 1/2 a day before it started making noise. It still rotates freely, but it seems to have a lot more play (I guess the crud is what held it together :) The new noise is probably from the fan wobbling and rubbing with the plastic housing.

I've looked through the archives a bit, and remember reading some other posts suggesting some kind of marine equipment (bilge fan?). The plastic fan is fine, but the motor has given up. Anyone with suggestions/ stories?


Thanks,

Dave.
