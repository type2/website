Subject:      free hubcaps??

Hi, everyone!

I tried to send this off-list but my message to mac.chen_at_popd_dot_netcruiser
came back undeliverable.  I just wanted to put in a bid for the free
hubcaps, which by now have undoubtedly found a home.  Nevertheless,
there is that rare chance . . . .  Scott, if no one has asked for them
yet, please call me at 202-418-0490 (day) or 301-868-6453 (home).
Thanks!!

Anyway, Scott, that was mighty neighborly of you to offer them, and may
God bless you and the happy camper who came up with them . . . .
