Hi all -
I found another new thrill this morning.  Take the largest, steepest 
hill on your normal travels, at 5:30 am of course, icy roads, etc., 
and remove the ability to use your brakes! ==8-0  Yeeehaaa!
Gonna limp home (uphill) and fix it there.  Goin' home early, right 
after soccer at lunch.

Glad I keep my parking brake functional!  Well, anyway I need to 
replace my LR slave cylinder and while I'm at it, replace some seals 
at the resevoir.  Other than the two seals between the resevoir and 
the master cylinder, are there any other seals I need to purchase 
prior to disassembly?  Couldn't find any in Bentley and Haynes, just 
tapping into *higher* knowledge.  Been having a small leak up front 
somewhere for quite a while, waiting for the *right* opportunity, 
'tis now methinks!

Obviously, I need rear brakes and at least one probably do both rear 
slaves.  And now on to the second question section of my tale.
How important is it to replace &quot;other&quot; things in drum brakes, such as 
springs, clips, washers, etc?  
&lt;confession&gt;I have never replaced any of this stuff in the past
&lt;/confession&gt;

On digest, and will be leaving for home in about 2 hours!

- Jeff
