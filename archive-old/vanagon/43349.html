Subject: Need Profile Line Drawing of Eurovan

To All,

I need to get my hands on a scanned line drawing (side profile) of a 
Eurovan (300 dpi, .TIF, .JPG, etc.), or a good quality photocopy via 
snail mail.  There *might* be one on the front of the Eurovan Owner's 
Manual (the one that comes in the glovebox) or in a Bentley or Haynes 
Eurovan repair manual.

If anyone can help, please respond via EMail.

TIA,


rdr
