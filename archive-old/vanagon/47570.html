 My '88 has recently started stalling when pushing clutch in during 
 first few minutes of driving cold. Runs great otherwise. I expect 
 it's that pesky throttle switch again, but with all this talk of O2 
 sensors, I wanted to check mine...

Yes.  Us an ohm meter to check for continuity.  If the resistance is low, the
heater is good, if open, it is bad.  Also check that the supply voltage is
good.  Should be baatery voltage to the heater.
