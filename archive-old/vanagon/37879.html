 Subject: WTB 78-79 Westy (Van BC Area)

  Hi,
         I am looking to buy a 1978 -79 Westfalia.  Preferably with a
  worn out engine or transmission.  One requirement is a solid - rust
  free body with no recent paint or body work.  I know they're out there
  somewhere.  Email any replies to jimhobek_at_uniserve_dot_com.   Thanks
  Jim
