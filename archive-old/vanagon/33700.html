Subject: RE:Vans on TV tuesday

The programme was filmed at last Septs Vanfest in Malvern. The researchers
spent days with SSVC and T2 Owners Club - and then spent hours and hours
filming...but all you will get is a 5 min slot - still there should be
something nice. Most of the section featurew T2 Owners club member Alan
Barraclough and all the amazing DIY luxuries and goodies he has equipped his
Bay window van with. There should be footage of 100+ vans lining up - mainly
Bays but a few Splits (most od us were at the Vemlo meet in Holland).
If you really wanna see a load of Splitties come to Stanford Hall in May -
100+ Spliities cruisin' down the M69/M1...
Nearly time to get on the road! Dave &amp; Cee
