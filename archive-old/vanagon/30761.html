All y'all sed:

h, you got the Syncro part ok, but I think
     the convention is &quot;Westie&quot; ;-).

     Anyway, Joel just posted this one last week:

     1986 Westfalia Syncro, with full camper setup, A/C power mirrors,
     tinted windows, $12,750 or offer.
     (505) 255-6611 (NM) delivery possible.

     Ah, the fun of the chase...

     87 Syncro GL
     90 Audi 200 TQW

If this is in the Taos area and it's gunmetal grey, and was owned by a 
nice realestate bimbo, I've seen it and it's thrashed.  Sister lives in
Taos.  I visit often.  She wanted 16.5K before.
