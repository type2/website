Subject: Taller tranny for Vanagon (was: a snowy day)

I know its not the same thing, but can you go with bigger tires (outside
diameter) to get the desired effect -- less RPM's at highway speed.
Yeah, that long hill that I can hold at 50 mph in 4th would probably
now need to be ascended in 3rd, but my 3rd gear would be taller too.

What sort of performance do you folks get that are using oversize tires
on your vanagon?  Increased highway mpg?
