&gt; &gt; Here's a test of tire knowledge. If my '86 Westy calls for the COLD tire
&gt; &gt; pressure for 185/70-14 tires to be 48 rear/39 front, then what should
&gt; &gt; the pressure be for 195/75-14?
&gt; What is the concensus on Vanagon Westy tire pressures front and rear, at
&gt; least a loaded-condition ball park?. The 185R-14 Michelins on mine call
&gt; for max load at 35 psi. Can I go considerably higher:-safely-.

I used to race auto cross (not vanagons!) and we would inflate to 20 lbs
over the tire rating to get all spring out of them.  Worked for me, no
adverse affects.  Reduced preasure after racing.
So, I ran at Vanagon placard preasure even tho it exceeded the max
rating.  No obvious problem, except I seemed to have more than my share
of tread separation.  So went back to the max rating.  Again, no adverse
effect.  Still have tire separtion now and then, but not as much.
I know this does not constitute a big enough sample to prove anything,
just my experience.
