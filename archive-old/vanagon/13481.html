Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 17-Mar-95 Ignition Wires... by
&quot;Harry Yates&quot;_at_bcit.bc_dot_ca 
&gt; I measured the resistance of the coil to distrib. wire at 1000 ohms.  
&gt; Bentley says 2000 -+800.  The spark plug leads measured at 3500 ohms, 
&gt; and Bentley says 6000 -+1000.  These measurements are from end to end 
&gt; which includes the resistors.
&gt;  

The old rule of thumb that I was taught was 1000 ohms/inch 
This was supposed to be a VERY crude approximation as you'll note vast
discrepancies from those numbers.
If your wires are 5 years old, I'd go ahead and swap them out for new ones
(preferably with bright yellow silicone jacketing...)
Is a proven engineering principle that brightly colored spark plug wires
are good for another 7 mph in top end!   ;-)
