Subject: Vanagon Web archives working again (and better than before)

Norman Leong noticed that the Vanagon list archives at
http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/ quit working early
this month.  I checked and sure enough, no messages since Nov. 7. 

I switched archive programs from MHonArc to hypermail.  The messages are
archiving once again, and better than ever.  Besides being much faster (C
vs. Perl), hypermail lets you view by date, subject, thread and author.
Check it out.

If I can lay my hands on some traditional mail archives I will try
converting some to hypermail form, if that's something people are interested
in.  If not, I won't.  I does seem to me that having a ready archive of at
least the tech stuff would be helpful.  Has anybody been saving just the
&quot;pearls&quot;?
