Subject: Re: KYB shock install

I replaced the original shocks on my '89 Westy about 3 months ago.  I am
still amazed at the difference in driveability between the old shocks and
the new ones.  Before, I felt uncomfortable going over 50 mph, 70 is no
problem now and even at that speed, I notice no twitchiness.  I've got
KYB's all around and Michelin MX 185-14C's at 50 psi in the back and 40 psi
in the front.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;A few days ago my order from RMMW works arrived, which consisted of a pair
&gt;of KYB Gas-A-Just front shocks and a VDO volt gauge.  Total with shipping
&gt;was $90, which I thought was pretty decent.  The order arrived correct and
&gt;on time as well.  So far I am 100% satisfied with RMMW, and I would
&gt;recommend them to others.
&gt;
&gt;Two nights ago I installed the shocks.  Real easy installation, two bolts
&gt;on each side.  Rolled the front of the bus up onto ramps to make it easier
&gt;to access.  Took about 30 minutes total, I think.  Old Sears gas shocks
&gt;went straight into the trash.
&gt;
&gt;Back on the road, I notice I can feel the bumps a little more now, but it's
&gt;not annoying.  Still a comfortable ride.  I was a little worried at first
&gt;after reading Sami's story of a bone-jarring ride with his KYB's.  I
&gt;couldn't tell a whole lot of difference in the way the bus handled - low
&gt;speed cornering seems a little flatter, but freeway lane changes seem about
&gt;the same, just a little &quot;twitchier&quot;, I guess.
&gt;
&gt;Overall, the difference isn't as great as I thought it was going to be, and
&gt;if I had it to do over again, I might have waited a little longer before
&gt;spending the $65.  They are, however, the first pair of front shocks that
&gt;have made *any* difference in the way the van felt.  The Sears shocks were
&gt;installed new about three years ago, and I couldn't tell any difference at
&gt;all.
&gt;
&gt;So why are they called Gas-A-Just?  I couldn't find any mention on the
&gt;shocks or instructions about adjusting them.  Does anyone know if they are
&gt;even adjustable?  The Koni shocks on the mustang are adjustable by pressing
&gt;the shock all the way down and turning the upper part.  I tried this with
&gt;the KYBs but couldn't tell whether or not it was doing anything.  Anyone
&gt;know?
