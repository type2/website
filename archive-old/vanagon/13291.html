So Ron Lussier says:
&gt; 
&gt; Along this thread, perhaps I could get a few opinions from the list.  I've
&gt; been saving my money for five years now, hoping to get a VW Camper.  I'm
&gt; currently trying to decide whether I want to go cheap and look for a used
&gt; camper in great condition, or be patient and await to see what '96 brings.
&gt; 
&gt; Though I think that the older busses are beautiful, I'm not a mechanic, so I
&gt; think I will shy away from buying one of those.  I'd prefer something that
&gt; doesn't require lots of technical maintenance.
&gt; 
&gt; If y'all had $30,000 to spend, what camper would get get?  A late-model
&gt; syncro?  A late-model non-syncro?  An earlier camper? Or should I wait?

$30,000 to spend!?.  Wow!  I'd send it to that Steven Johnson guy.  He
really needs it.  ;)

Non-mechanical huh?  Well, there's a few things to consider.  You could
wait for the possibility of a Syncro coming out in a late model EV, but
rememeber that the engine is in the wrong end. ;)

A late Westy Vanagon GL Syncro is a good investment.  I think they're
appreciating.  

Or, Spend about half that money on an older (possible vintage model) and
have it professionally restored and own a real show boat.

Cheers!
