Paul:

you don't really need to take the vehicle to a VW specialist, not if he's
far away. The check-up is basic: compression test, brake system, etc. In
fact, even you could do it. Well, I know how it is at first without any
previous experience: I, too, lacked the confidence of doing the check-up
myself when I bought my bus in '91. But you could still do a pre-check to
determine if the bus even qualifies for a professional inspection. Get
yourself Muir's bible and read the chapter on buying a VW.

Essentially, you want to testdrive the bus to see how it feels, steers,
accelerates, brakes, but *mainly* to get away from the owner. Once alone
with the bus, crawl under and look for rust perforations, various leaks
(engine, transmission, brake cylinders, exhaust system). Also be
suspicious if the engine has been recently steam cleaned. Bring a magnet
and look for bondo work or fiberglass fixes covered up with undercoating.

Do the same magnet test with the body. Check for rust under all window
seals, especially under the windshield. You should expect some, but again
watch out for perforations. Check tire wear: is it even? Wiggle the
steering wheel (at a standstill): is there much play? Of course, you'll
look at the interior, which often reflects how the bus has been treated.

There are certainly more things to check out. Anyone else who wants to
share their check-up routines?

If the bus passes your test, then take it to the professional. If things
need to be fixed, ask for an estimate and use that figure when bargaining,
should you have decided that the bus is worthy.

IMHO, a nice Westy breadloaf, with no major flaws should cost $2,500 to
$3,500. Yes, we've heard of great buys (&quot;like new bus for $800&quot;), but
those are flukes, not something you can afford to wait for. And then,
there are those among us who feel that their pristine busses are worth,
like, $5,000 (I do), but they shouldn't be selling in the first place. 

Ideally, the bus would have 10,000 to 40,000 miles on a rebuilt engine.
(rebuilts differ: make sure you get the paperwork to see what exactly had
been done). Beware of busses with less than 10,000 since &quot;rebuilt.&quot;

I don't know enough about the other type2 generations to have a valid
opinion on how much they should cost. Maybe others will chime in.
