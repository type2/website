&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;BODY bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D2 =
color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;The slip in the word article is more my =
unskilled typing than some strange doctors dreams. &amp;nbsp;The world is =
not on the computer and alot of those do not have their own we page to =
show each of us the personal changes done to their rigs. &amp;nbsp;I have =
seen many ideas for my vanagon from Hot VWs and even Trucking. &amp;nbsp;Hot =
VW's did have a tech letter that had many real ideas about which High =
Perf. parts that could be switched from the type 1 to the water boxer. =
&amp;nbsp;I have also seen the High Perf. water boxer engines used =
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;in a type III (my mechanics work of art) and in a off road =
racer. &amp;nbsp;Both of these are much more custom than what I want my =
camper to be they do give me ideas to go on. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have also =
seen alot about what people keep writing about in the vanagon list. =
&amp;nbsp;Like source for 14 &amp;amp; 15 &amp;amp; 16 inch custom rims for the =
vanagon. &amp;nbsp;Or how about the high performance headers and the turbo =
kit that some one was looking for their stock diesel.&lt;br&gt;Its all there =
right now. &amp;nbsp;If people are closed minded about this so much they =
should be driving M.B. or Volvo's, both Hot V.W. &amp;amp; VW treads are =
sources of ideas, not laws on HOW volkswagons are to be built. Please =
forgive me if I flamed but the Holier &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;than thou attitude gets =
to me alot. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Ronald P. Mc Donald =
