Subject: Re: awnings, what I've learned

&gt;Hi Awning Volks;
&gt;
&gt;I've got a 10' awning on our Syncro Westy, and Todd here made a note 
&gt;about the front door not being able to open.  I can easily open my 
&gt;front door with the Norseman Apollo 10' awning.  I usually have the 
&gt;awning sloped down a bit from the van, and when I open the front door 
&gt;I just put my hand over the top of the door to protect the finish.  
&gt;If you get an awning that stops at the front of the sliding door you 
&gt;won't be able to have the sliding door open in the pouring rain 
&gt;without your van getting wet inside.  I'm not sure if the A &amp; E 
&gt;awning restricts the front door opening completely or not, but this 
&gt;is not the case with the Apollo.
&gt;
&gt; HI Harry:

Like I said,I haven't figured this all out yet. On your awning, Does the arm
that holds the awning up when pulled out go down to the ground or does it
angle back and attach to the bottom of the bus. If it ataches to the bus,where?
Thanks, Todd Francis
