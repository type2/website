    There were a couple different 'camper-like' split window bus matchbox 
    cars.  I seem to remember a greenish one and later a silver one.  Wish I 
    still had them both.  I have seen them in flea markets.  Though the 
    silver might have been a bay window...

greenish one is a camper.  mine has a green
transparent &quot;sunroof&quot; (non-moveable) and
the old double doors, not a slider, that do
work.

one of my kids does indeed duly treasure it
and its many other kin that she has inherited
without my having to expire first.
