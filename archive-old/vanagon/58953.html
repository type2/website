Subject: Re: heating water for westy camping trips

&gt;Has anyone had experience using the H2O shower or other type of
&gt;&quot;bags&quot; that are supposed to heat water for showers while
&gt;camping?  We were thinking of using it by putting it the luggage
&gt;area in front of the pop top and letting the hose hang through
&gt;the drivers window into the sink when needed ...

In an old issue of The Mother Earth News, a fellow made a nifty solar 
hot water &quot;tank&quot; out of a large inner tube.  He rigged the whole 
thing up for about 75 cents, too.  He took a regular garden hose, cut 
a hole in the tube and secured it with some type of sealant (not sure 
what kind but some kind of silicon should do) then attached a nozzle 
on the end.  Using this type of setup, you could store more water, 
make the length of the hose right to go into the van and it wouldn't 
cost much but time.  He stated that it heated up fairly quickly and I 
imagine this would heat up as quickly as one of those store-bought 
gizmos.  

Hope this helps....
