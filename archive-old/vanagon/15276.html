&gt; 1972 VW Bus, white with tan interior.

&gt; This one's headed for the crusher, folks.  The owner said that it will
&gt; be sold this month one way or the other.  I'd like to see it stay on the
&gt; road, but I can't afford to put new smog motor in it.  I'm still paying
&gt; off the bill from the new motor in my own breadloaf.  Sigh.

What a sad day indeed. I have a '72 Westy in the same condition and would
really really love to have the extra parts...all those wonderful body
parts, undercarriage, steering box, etc, etc. But I don't have the room
for this loveable clutter :( He lives not very far from me also.

Sigh...well, at least I can take the motor parts from him, and I do need
another muffler.

Jack, how about introducing me to him and I shall save a little of its
spirit.
