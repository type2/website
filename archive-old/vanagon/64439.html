Wes,
I think that the way the list is setup now benifits all users.  Splitting
up the list will only split up the collective knowledge and make it
difficult for someone searching for solutions.

Besides we all benefit from knowing were there are good mechanics and/or
events all over the country.

Just my opinion.

&gt; As a recently 'returned to the fold' Vanagon Listserv member, I've been
&gt; impressed with the proliferation of Seattle/Pacific NW members over the
&gt; last year or so.  I received several thoughtful and helpful responses to
&gt; my inquiry about &quot;Seattle Area Mechanics&quot; and have followed the burgeoning
&gt; interest in the upcoming NW camping trip.  All of which leads me to
&gt; wonder:  Would it be worthwhile to set up a separate mailing list
&gt; specifically for NW Vanagon owners (and, of course, our brethern busses
&gt; and EV's)?  I would envision this as dedicated to the discussion of
&gt; practical, NW area issues, such as where to get qualilty and value in
&gt; VW service and parts, coordination of NW vanagon outings and events and
&gt; other similar items of local/regional interest.
&gt;
&gt; I've set up a list - via my local ISP - for NW Flyfishing and have
&gt; found it to be easy enough to do that I'd be willing to set up a similar
&gt; one for us NW Vanagon owners.
&gt;
&gt; If you're interested in such a list - or if you have ideas for what the
&gt; list should be like - drop me an email (let's not clutter up *this* list
&gt; with discussion) and I'll see what I can do.
