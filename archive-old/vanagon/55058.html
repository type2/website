Subject: Re: Tires &amp; Pressure '85 Westy


&gt; My '85 Westy has tires put on by PO.  They are BF Goodrich P185/75R 14 
&gt; 89S M&amp;S.  I notice the max tire pressure on the tires say 35 psi.  I have 
&gt; noticed in the camper owners manual it has one pressure, in the Bentley 
&gt; another and some people on the list recommend still another.  Can anyone 
&gt; recommend what I should be using.  The camper is always RTR (ready to 
&gt; roll) except for food.  We don't carry too many extras and just 2 adults. 
&gt; I have a feeling that we are running on marshmallows.  The local &quot;tire 
&gt; store&quot; told us to put 33 psi in each.  Your expert advice appreciated as 
&gt; usual.

I'd run at least that in each. You will probably want to go 35 in the 
rear, as you will notice sway on the highway otherwise. You will 
never really get a solid ride with these tires, however .I would 
seriously consider a trade in for some LT, or at least re-inforced 
tires. The 89S rating indicates these are car tires, which are not 
well suited to the job.
I now run Yoko 370s, load range D LT tires, and Sears LT lr C tires 
and am very happy with the highway stability. Yoko 370s all around, 
inflated to ~ 52 psi rear, 48psi front would be the number 1 choice for 
me.
