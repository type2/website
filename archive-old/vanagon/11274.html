Subject: 1977 VW WESTFALIA CAMPER--$2350
Date: 7 Feb 1995 05:39:18 GMT

1977 VW factory Westfalia Camper
Rebuilt 2.0 liter fuel injected motor and clutch (about 22.5 k ago)
Orange with Green interior
New Alternator
New Brakes
JVC AM/FM Cassette
--This is a nice, useable Westfalia, with a good exterior (not perfect, but good) and a really quite decent interior, almost 100% original (except for the 
recovered front seats, done in a grey cloth). It runs excellent (it will do
75+ mph on the freeway...with no headwind :) The top is in good shape, 
although it does need to be cleaned with fiberglass cleaner. Overall, it's 
in good shape--worth the price for an original Westfalia, I think. If
you would like more details, email me.....
