Besides the obvious points - anything that moves, *inside* the bearings,
carefully cleaning all the grunge from the roller tracking areas (esp. at
the bottom track where all the cr*p scraped off yer shoes ends up - use a
soft dowel w/ a rag damp w/ kerosene to get way back there) . . . . after
all that, mine still squeeked just b4 the closed/latched position;  close
inspection revealed that the bottom roller (where all the shoe grunge ends
up) actually slides *sideways* (!) through the end of the 's' curve just b4
closing:  solution ?  -  apply a film of beeswax, paraffin wax, or something
quasi-lubricating that is dry (so you don't collect more dirt than will end
up there anyway ) to the flat surface the roller rides on.  Repeat once a year.
