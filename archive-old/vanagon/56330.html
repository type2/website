&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I have a quick question.  I know that the efficiency of the Dometic
&gt;Westy fridge can be increased by installing a little fan inside the
&gt;fridge to blow over the fins.  I have heard of some folks getting a
&gt;teeny fan like this at Radio Shack.  
&gt;
&gt;I went to Radio Shack today and looked at their fan selection.  The only
&gt;thing I could find that was close to what I heard about is a really
&gt;small (about the size of a little matchbox) fan that's sold as a CPU
&gt;cooling fan.  It runs on 12v DC and draws 0.9 amps.  I assume this is
&gt;the fan that is referred to?  Does this fan flow enough air to do the
&gt;job?  How would one go about mounting this fan and running the wiring? 
&gt;
&gt;I have seen a fan sold specifically for this purpose, it's made by an RV
&gt;products manufacturer and sits in the bottom of the fridge and blows air
&gt;up.  I've never seen it in person but I know it exists, I saw it on the
&gt;packaging of a water tank filler.  Does anyone know where I could find
&gt;this fan?
&gt;
&gt;I'm interested in doing this because of my upcoming camping trip.  I'm
&gt;gonna have some perishable stuff in the fridge and I want to make sure I
&gt;don't have any spoilage problems.  The fridge itself works fine, I just
&gt;want to make it work better.

Camping World has a most excellent self-contained fan that takes 2 'D'
batteries and goes for about a month on them.  It *does* tend to keep the
fridge a little cooler, in my experience.  It also doesn't require drilling
a hole in your fridge.
