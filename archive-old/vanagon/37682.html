As long as some of us seem to be in a mood:

Some helpful hints for saving the world for those that will out live 
us.

Don't drive to work.  Ride a bike.  Ride the city bus.  Carpool.  One 
person per single vehicle is not the most efficient way to get about 
town.  Save up your errands that require a vehicle and do them all at 
once.

Become a vegetarian.  While you are at it, you can add a few years to 
your own life.  Feeding plants to vegetarian animals and then eating 
their flesh is not the most efficient way for us to get our 
sustenance.

Don't reproduce.  Speaks for itself.  See:  _The Population Bomb_
