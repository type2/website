Subject: demented dworkin's used bus bits


Everyone - check out this URL from our beloved list member:
(dworkin_at_village_dot_org)

http://information-retrieval.village_dot_org/vw/parts/

He's done a beautiful job of categorizing bits and pieces of busses
and vans people are looking for - either to buy/sell/whatever.  The
way he has it cleverly indexed is phenomenal, and he obviously put
considerable amount of effort into the planning.

It think this can be a very useful resource to all of us looking
for that special obscure piece for our bus, and I urge you all
to list with him things you have to share/sell, or things you want
to get.
