OK, how many of you out there know how to roll up (or down) the power
windows with the key off?

Turn on the headlights, hold the dimmer switch back on high beam (keep
holding), the push the window buttons...Presto! This works on my '90 as
well as a neighbor's, don't know about older vans (or even when power
windows became an option).  It's real handy when my wife decides to sit in
the car while I run in a store, or vice versa.

Study the Bentley wiring diagrams, I can't find the connection.  Any other
secrets?
