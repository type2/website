&gt; The antenna on my 86 vanagon broke off; the local VW people said that I needed
&gt; to replace the entire unit.  Well I have the antenna unit but I's stuck in
&gt; terms of the installation.  It seems that the antenna has to be installed from
&gt; the inside.  That is, push the antenna through the hole from the inside and
&gt; then install the gasket and locking nut from the outside.  However, I can't see
&gt; how to disassemble the dash plastic to install it from the inside.  If anyone
&gt; could provides some assistance, I would be most grateful.  Thanks!

NO! STOP!!!
Don't try to disassemble the dash!  They're not quite possible to put 
back together right.
If you take the plastic out from around the steering column... You ought 
to be able to trace the ant. wire from the back of the radio(Take out the 
ashtray) to the ant.
I've done this... so I know that it's possible.
Next undo the nut from the ant. on the outside and let it fall in.
Now... Sitting on the floor by the pedals, with your feet out the open 
drivers side door, reach your right hand up behind the fusebox and see if 
you can find it.  Take it out carefully... You don't want the serpentine 
cord to be ripping out your electrical connections.
In daylight... you should be able to see the hole from inside.
Stick the new ant thru it, have someone ready on the outside to hold it 
in plaace.
thread the coaxial thru some out of the way route back to the radio.
You're done.

If you're having trouble... E-mail me...  I may have forgotten a step.
It's been a while since I did this operation.
