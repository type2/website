&gt;&gt;&gt;D&amp;R: Considering the '84 Vantage curio, the original $120 seal didn't fit 
as well as a $2 quarter-inch closed-cell foam seal for weather stripping... 
the clearance at the back is far beyond the &quot;reach&quot; of the OEM. The foam 
rubber won't last forever, but if I get a couple years out of it, I'll use 
the $120 to buy some extra seal for my great-great-great-grandchildren's use 
on the Vantage. Unlike the OEM seal, the foam is self-adhesive, making the 
job a 10-minute &quot;no brainer.&quot;

I cleaned all drains (they were gross!) with a wire and tested by pouring a 
pitcher or two in the holes. Had rain last weekend and was very pleased with 
the results. Anyone wanna buy an OEM curio seal?

    &gt;    I probably belong in the idiot files, after having a cold bucket
    &gt;    of water poured down the back of my neck more than once... from
    &gt;    clogged curio drains. My curio recesses fill with water (at
    &gt;    $120, the new seal didn't help) and I get the shower when I stop
    &gt;    or head down hill.

    Dan,

    I was depressed to see this post, because, as you kow, I'm hunting
    for the elusive sunroof bus.  The one I'm considering buying has
    a leaky roof.  I was wondering if you could tell me *why* yours
    leaks after replacing the seal?  Was the replacement seal of poor
    quality (where'd you buy it--sounds like RMMW's price)?  Does
    your sunroof fit poorly, are the lifters adjusted correctly, etc.?


Rodney,

While I was not the guy who replaced the seal, mine are original,
my roof seals are surely leaky and/or the roof does not properly
seat against the seals.  Arguably, leaky seals should not be a
very big problem -- the drains are backup.

However, I think there is a small design flaw in the sunroof
that goes like this:
        sunroof open at speed inevitably exposes roof storage
           compartment to blow-in of small junk
        low flow of rainwater that inevitably breaches seals will
           transport small junk to drains but will not clear the
           drains
        drains are a series of &quot;gutter-style&quot; conntections betwen
           metal fittings ultimately connected to plastic tubing
        mechanical clearance of a blockage (such as by threading
           in an electrician's snake) are prone to disconnect
           the tubing from the fitting -- which is a vastly worse
           situation
        ipso facto, clogs are inevitable and water flushes are
           the only safe answer

The reason I'm copying the list is to invite dispute.
