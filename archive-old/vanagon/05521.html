I guess I should have said insane _camper_ prices.

Just out of curiousity, what do you camper owners use the pop-top 
for?  Added headroom, or do you actually sleep up there as well?
I can't imagine leaving the top up when it's 10 below.  Do you just
have it open when cooking, etc, and then close it (in the cold months)
when it's time sleep?

All this talk about $20K Campers and $24K Syncro Campers has left 
me with the realization that I'm better off putting $10000 into my
'87 Syncro than buying a used camper.  But my Syncro is not a Westy.

Would adding some westy-type equipment be a waste without the added
headroom the poptop gives?
