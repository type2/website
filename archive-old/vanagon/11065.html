&gt; I have a question on window tinting as well.  I bought my used '81
&gt; westy with the windows already tinted.  They all look fine, EXCEPT
&gt; for the rear hatch window, which has some scratches on it, plus
&gt; little bits of missing film, etc.  Will removing the existing
&gt; film there damage the rear-window defogger?  Is it made from
&gt; wires in the glass or conductive paint?  Should I try it myself
&gt; or leave it to professional?

It's really easy to break those little defrost wires.  One pass with a
razor blade can wipe out all of them.  I once removed the tint from a
rear window for reasons similar to yours, and even though I was very careful,
I broke two of the lines.  I would leave it to a professional, and let them
know in no uncertain terms that they had better not break any of the
defroster wires.  Try to find a place that can supply references, since
I don't know of any way to repair the wires once they are broken.
