Subject: Why didn't that VW use his signal?!

My turn signals suddenly decided not to function this weekend.  When activated 
the indicator on the dash just glows and doesn't blink.  Bad relay?  Bad switch? 
The signals don't work up front or back.  All bulbs are OK.  What are the most 
common culprits for misbehaving signals?  Please help.  I have now resorted to 
using my hand out the window.
