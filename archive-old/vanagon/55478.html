Subject: Cable Link

I mentioned this to the chat group, but,....

I'm just curious if anyone has internet service through their cable
company. My cable company (Time Warner) just released a super-fast
internet connection that runs through the cable connection. I don't have
it yet, but I've tried it out and it's incredible. Any input would be
cool.
