Subject: EV w/VR6

per May '96 'European Car'  (p. 127) . . . 

&quot;With more than 700,000 units sold worldwide since their introduction in
1990, VW has decided to thoroughly upgrade the Transporter and Caravelle
minivans for 1996. Of the six powertrain  models available, only the
Caravelle VR6 will be sold in the U.S.

Upgrades on the VR6 include a styling change - a longer front for a more
passenger-car-like look - that differentiates it from the Transporter
models; new &quot;Plus&quot; front suspension; a new manual 5-speed gearbox with a
modified changegate; and, strangely enough, a &quot;de-tuned&quot; 2.8L engine that
produces a lesser 140 bhp at 4500 rpm.  In addition, an ABS/EDL system is
now standard for the Caravelle and optional on all other models.&quot;

a.) what is . . . /EDL?
b.) these sporty car guys don't appreciate torque near enough - I had a 2.8L
flat six courtesy       of Chevrolet that only had 110 hp in my '70; in
those days the 140 hp quad-carb was not       recommended by KEP for buses
(but they also thought that retaining the 2sp PowerGlide       was a good
idea - NOT!)  (someday, Steve, I'll tell the whole sordid story . . .).
c.) taking bets - 33k cash inc t &amp; l out the door? (and I sure don't know
any friendly bankers          ennymore).
