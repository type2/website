Subject: Re: Trailer Hitches For Vanagon Class III Found


immediately below the rear bumper and are painted black. With a Class III
&gt;hitch you get a receiver hitch hole. When you want to tow something, you
&gt;plug the ball mounting into that hole.
&gt;
&gt;The hitches replace the two pieces of metal that hold your bumper up now.
&gt;They are longer and extend further in to the vehicle body.


Hi Derek, Thanks for the info. How are these hitches held in place? The 
regular bumpers, and the hitch that I have, use two bolts per side, near the 
rear apron. Has your mechanic added more mounting points? What 
size/thickness are the components for this hitch. It sounds identical to my 
Class I hitch, rated at 2000#.  tim s.

PS: for the ultimate off-road trailer try contacting British 
Leyland/Landrover. They (used to?) sell a 2 wheel powered trailer that runs 
off the rear PTO unit.
