&gt; The pilot bearing on my 1700cc crank is stuck in the end of the 
&gt; crankshaft.  I need to remove it because it looks dirty and I want to 
&gt; clean it.  How do you get it out?  The pilot lubricating felt is 
&gt; missing.  Can you make one yourself, or must it be bought?

Rent or buy a puller and get that puppy outta there.  Then replace it
with a new one.  Only about $5.  The puller you want should have an
attachment for *inside* pulling, or inner circumference, or something
like that.  Usually two small metal &quot;fingers&quot; that go in behind the
bearing and expand.
