Subject: RE: Trip Report (Summer Trip - Jon Ulrig)

Jon,

That sounds like a heckuva trip in a 70 bus!
Did you go on the Moqui Dugway while in Lake
Powell, UT? We did that in a zippy little car,
*not* a bus. It's a dirt road which zigzags
on the side of a mountain - about 6 miles of
road for 1100 feet difference of elevation.
Wasn't on the map, but we found ourselves
there! 

I second the &quot;go there&quot; sentiment for Lake
Powell and Zion NP, and also Yosemite and 
Yellowstone were great (on previous trips).
We loved Utah and Montana. I miss being able
to drive massive amounts of miles on trips -
we did 9000 miles in 3 weeks when we hit Lake
Powell and Yosemite in '89, and 7000 miles in
3 weeks when we hit Yellowstone and Montana in
'90 (on our honeymoon). Just can't do those
miles (in the same time frame) in a microbus
without killing yourselves!

So, let's hear some more reports about summer
vacations, everyone!!

Lori
