Subject: Re: 009 &amp; #3 problem - Pertronix?

&gt;a new distributor that would retime #3?  If so, has anyone any

Along the same lines, does anyone know if installing the Pertronix Ignitor 
removes the #3 retard?  The retard wouldn't be necessary on a type 4 engine, 
but the PO installed a 009 on it.  Same on my type 1 with doghouse.
