Hey Guys,

If you see a bug or whatever, and it seems abandoned, call the cops they'll
run a check on the VIN and find out who owns it.  If it's abandoned, make
an offer to the city, town or whatever.  Here in Philly the owner of the
abandoned car get hit with a $500 fine and the car goes to a junk yard to
be sold.

Just don't &quot;take it&quot;, be legit about it.
