RATIONALE

There is currently a rec.autos.vw newsgroup for all discussions
concerning VW's.  However many people find the group has a very high
bandwidth that needs to be split.  The discussions that currently take
place can be roughly divided along the aircooled / watercooled
boundary -- there are many topics that are unique to each type of car,
and the concerns, questions, answers, and personalities of the owners
of the vehicles can be similarly divided. The point of making this
distinction is not to emphasize the differences in the vehicles
themselves, which actually have many similarities having been built by
the same company.  The point is to divide the discussions along a line
that will leave each sub-group with an appropriate amount of traffic
while losing as little solidarity as possible.

CHARTERS

The proposed unmoderated newsgroup rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled will
be open to discussions on all topics related to air-cooled VW's.  The
&quot;air-cooled&quot; distinction is made since the aircooled automobiles that
VW stopped making in 1983 are unique compared to those made by other
manufacturers as well as the newer water-cooled VW's.

The dicussions on this group should deal only with the air-cooled or
&quot;vintage&quot; VW's, namely the Type I (Bug, Super Beetle, Thing, Karmann
Ghia), Type II (Bus), Type III (Fastback, Squareback, Notchback, Type
34 Ghia), and Type IV (model 411 and 412, newer Bus), related cars
(Porsche 912 and 914, and Buick Corvair for instance), and related
discussions such as parts suppliers, maintenance tips, unusual
conversions, performance enhancements, fish stories, general vintage
VW comraderie, and related topics.

Conversely, the proposed unmoderated newsgroup
rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled will be open to discussions on all
topics related to water-cooled VW's, specifically the Rabbit,
Scirocco, Golf, GTI, Jetta, Passat, Corrado, and other related models.
Discussions will include parts suppliers, maintenance tips, features
of newer models, experiences purchasing new cars, and general
information exchange.

There is no provision made for a rec.autos.makers.vw.misc group.  Any
topics that do not seem to fit clearly into either of the proposed
groups can be cross-posted to both.  In practice, such topics are
unusual.

The existing rec.autos.vw newsgroup will be eliminated and replaced by
the two new proposed newsgroups.  If they both pass their votes, then
rec.autos.vw will be removed in two months from the creation of the
new groups.

Neither of the proposed new groups are intended for commercial
for-sale postings.  Appropriate private advertisements, both
'FOR-SALE' and 'WANTED' is acceptable, commercial posting is not.

Individuals who make their livelyhood by selling VW parts, services
or those employed in the industry are welcome to participate, but
should NOT post advertisements for their services.

HOW TO VOTE

You must send MAIL to voting_at_ntrs_dot_com.  (Posting in a newsgroup does not
constitute a vote.)  Just replying to this article should work unless you
are reading it on a mailing list, but please check the TO address.

Please remove text before the marker line below.  Voting mail is archived
by the votetakers, and hundreds of copies of the entire CFV wastes space.

Type your vote of YES or NO for each group on the line for that group.
If you do not wish to vote for a group, simply leave that line alone.
You need not worry about quoting characters which your mailer inserts.
Please type YES or NO, not Y, N, or X.  The votes are tabulated by a
program, and a valid vote is defined as the word YES or NO on the same
line as the name of the group.

You may also ABSTAIN in place of YES/NO - this will not affect the outcome.
Anything else may be rejected by the automatic vote counting program.  The
votetaker will respond to your received ballots with a personal acknowledge-
ment by mail - if you do not receive one within several days, try again.
It is your responsibility to make sure your vote is registered correctly.

Only one vote per person, no more than one vote per account.  Addresses and
votes of all voters will be published in the final voting results list.
