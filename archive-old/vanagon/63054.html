---------------------------------------------------------------------
The listserv running on gerry.sdsc_dot_edu has more features than &quot;listproc&quot;
running on lenti.  To take advantage of some of them, you need to understand
how they work.

Send these messages to listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu and NOT to vanagon_at_gerry or to
anything _at_lenti.  Make sure your subject line is blank or &quot;NONE&quot;.

The message formats are
SET VANAGON DIGEST
SET VANAGON NODIGEST
SET VANAGON INDEX
SET VANAGON NOINDEX
SET VANAGON MAIL
SET VANAGON NOMAIL

Here are the descriptions of these modes from the manual.

5.3.2. DIGest/NODIGest
----------------------
Causes the subscriber to receive one posting per digest cycle (typically
daily)  rather than individual messages as they are processed by LISTSERV.

In version 1.8b, the MAIL/NOMAIL option has been isolated from DIGEST/INDEX.
The MAIL/NOMAIL option controls whether messages should be delivered, and the
DIGEST/INDEX/NODIGEST/NOINDEX option controls the format in which messages
should be delivered. Thus, switching to NOMAIL and back to MAIL now preserves
the digest/index/normal delivery setting. To provide as much compatibility
with the old syntax as possible, the four options operate as follows:

 DIGEST: enable digest delivery mode (which negates INDEX), enable mail
         delivery.

 INDEX:  enable index delivery mode (which negates DIGEST), enable mail
         delivery.

 NOMAIL: disable mail delivery.

 MAIL:   restore mail delivery, without altering the digest/index/normal
         delivery setting (new behavior). For compatibility with 1.8a, if mail
         delivery was already active, the MAIL option negates INDEX/DIGEST.
         Thus, a user going from NOMAIL to MAIL will keep his previous  delivery
         options, whereas a user going from DIGEST or INDEX to MAIL will in
         fact deactivate index/digest mode.

To revert from digest/index subscription mode to normal delivery, you can use
either the MAIL option as before, or the NODIGEST/NOINDEX option. The NODIGEST
and NOINDEX options were actually present in versions 1.7f and 1.8a, as
synonyms for the MAIL option. In other words, you can update your instructions
to indicate that the DIGEST/INDEX options are negated by the NODIGEST/NOINDEX
options, even if your server is not yet running version 1.8b.

Note that in extreme cases, subscribers using the DIGEST option may receive
more than one digest per cycle if the digest limit is reached before the end
of the cycle.
