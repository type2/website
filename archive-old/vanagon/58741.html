Subject: Canvas roof carrier

Dear list members,
A local (SLC, UT) canvas factory-store makes a really nice heavy-weight
canvas car-top carrier for $56.  Trouble is, none of their stock
sizes is perfect for fitting my '84 Westie luggage rack.  They will
custom make one for me for around $112.  At first I thought that was
too steep but calling around I find similar products of lower quality
and misfit for $100 and up.  So I have two questions:

1) Does anyone know a better source for a good quality soft car-top
   carrier that will fit the Westie luggage rack?  I saw one mention
   of something in the archives but no follow up.  What do people
   use to cover stuff up there?

2) The factory-store said the price would come down if I ordered
   10 or more but I don't have a firm quote yet.  Is anyone interested 
   in these?  I'd be happy to relay more information if there is an
   interest.
   
Thanks,
Chris Braymen
