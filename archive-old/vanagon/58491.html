Subject: Re: lifting front end

&gt; I have an air cooled '81, so am not really qualified to have an opinion
&gt; about changing coolant, but as I understand it, you need to get the front
&gt; higher (15&quot; or so) than the back.
&gt; 
&gt; If there are hills where you live, why can't you just park on one?
&gt; 
Anyone is welcome to use my driveway, if they're in the 
neighborhood...  :)

(Actually I think it may be *more* than 15&quot;...)
