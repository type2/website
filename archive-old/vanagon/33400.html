Subject: Plea for help in Virgina Area

Would someone who is in local calling distance from Mary Washington 
College in Fredericksburg, VA please email me if they'd be willing to 
help two VW Bus people who can't receive mail?
It would involve calling the college to find out who is responsible for 
the network and then finding out if they know they are unaccessable to 
the outside world. 
Of course, if someone knows this to be wrong ( and MY system is hosed for 
some reason ) that would be even better.

Thanks.
