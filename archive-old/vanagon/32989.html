&gt; After 18 months  he told the dealer that some day they were going to screw
up
&gt; and sell a car to some one who wasn't big enough to push it where he wanted
&gt; to go and he sold it for $6500. In a patriotic fit he went and bought a new
&gt; Granada.
&gt; 

Ya know, responses like this on the list really irk me.  I've seen many brands
foreign and domestic have these same kinds of symptoms and repetitive problems
and repeat visits to the garage/dealership with no resolution of the problem.
One such example is Thom Fitzpatricks trouble with his SO BMW last year.

=====================
FWIW - Although my Vanagon is Diesel, and I don't know personally for sure (as
in by working on one) about the FI system in the Vanagons  - I believe that
the Vanagon FI is a Bosch based system that is very very close to the Bosch
&quot;Motronic&quot; that is used in my BMW.  So, FWIW, the things I have learned over
the years on my FI system may well apply to VWs, and I'll gladly share what
(little) I know to all comers.
