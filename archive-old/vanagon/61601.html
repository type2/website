I responded to a posted request for canvas awnings with:

&gt;&gt;I had a fire in my '75 Westy two summers ago, and the pop-top canvas had
&gt;&gt;to be replaced.  After pricing new (and used) ones, I decided to have
&gt;&gt;one made.  A shop here in Toronto that makes boat covers made one for me
&gt;&gt;for $500 Cdn (about $350 U.S.) with double stitching, extra side
&gt;&gt;windows, removable velcro bug screens, etc, etc..  

but, of course, I'm talking about the pop-top canvas here (my mistake, I
misread the original post).  Anyway, for those of you looking for
awnings, I'm sure the same shop would make one for a much cheaper price.
 The shop that made my new pop-top canvas:

King Sol Outdoor Stores
639 Queen St. W
Toronto, Ont.
(416) 504-3333
(416) 504-2222

The person that coordinated the job was named Ira (he may remember, he
may not -- this was two years ago).  I just pulled out my old canvas (or
what was left of it) and handed it over.  Then, I just asked for all the
custom stuff.  Oh ya, and the fabric they used was called Sombrelle, or
Ombrelle, or something like that -- many colours available.  They did a
fantastic job, including running a wire bead around the edge of the
fabric for where the aluminum strapping holds it down , etc., etc.

If you're in Toronto and want to see what they did, feel free to e-mail
me, and we'll arrange a meet...
