I think these heaters might be overkill for a small vehicle like the
Vanagon, unless maybe you live in Alaska or somewhere where it's really
cold. I have looked at these heaters--they are 3 to 4 times the size of the
Propex and I think would require you to put holes in the side of the van.
The Propex vents through the floor of the van.

&gt;Friends,
&gt;Have any of you tried a Suburban RV furnace heater?  I know they make
&gt;12,000 and 16,000 BTU models which will fit under the rear seat of a
&gt;Westy.  Price seems high, though.  I was quoted $750.00 for a full
&gt;installation, including an auxillary battery and isolater.  Hope
&gt;someone's tried this thing, because I'm tempted.  Info needed!
