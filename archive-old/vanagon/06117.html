Subject: Original license plate mounting 

Anyone know what the original/official method was to mount the 
front license plate on the 71 bus?  All the owner/sales photos 
(etc.) show the bus (of course) without a front plate at all.  
Real-life buses I've observed employ a myriad of bumper styles 
and methods for mounting.  (BTW, I believe mine is the original 
bumper, a simple 'blade' with a slightly convex front surface)

Thanks again all...
