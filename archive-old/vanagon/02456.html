Subject: Women on the Trip (howmany?)



Martha voices her concern:

&gt; ohmagod.  I think you guys have gone mad.  
&gt; 
&gt; Surely there must be SOME other females willing to go on this trip!
 
Well, I'll be bringing my significant other, Janice, and maybe her sister
Debbie, and our friend Kathy likes to come on these adventures, and
Janice's daughter Julie will have just graduated from Vassar and might
want to go before graduate school, and her friend Jessica...  Hmm maybe
I'll have to bring *two* of my busses!
