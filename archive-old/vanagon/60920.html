Subject: 1980 Westy For Sale

I am a recent subscriber to the Vanagon list... owned a 1969 camper for 8
years before selling it for a motorhome so am familiar with vans. Previously
had a 1962 VW bug and ownerd three Rabbits including one diesel plus a
VW/Porsche 914 over the years so am familiar with VW's in general. Am kind
of interested in older vans so thought I would check out the activity here
on the vanagon list.

A neighbor has a 1980 Westy with 76,000 miles. She bought the camper a
couple of years ago and tells me she did some work on it... I don't have
details of the work but could find out info. if needed. She has developed a
problem with her knee which prevents her from shifting gears and is
interested in selling it.

What are these 1980 models selling for. Anyone have an older van they want
to trade for the '80?? Lets talk about it.

Jim
