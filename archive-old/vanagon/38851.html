Subject: Re: Splittie VW Emblem Anti-Theft Device

&gt;About a decade ago I when I was in college I drove my 63 Camper 
&gt;extensively and never experienced getting the front emblem 
&gt;swiped by any larcenous hands, although I had had others pilfered.  
&gt;How was this so?
&gt;
&gt;Well, it had a dealer-installed theft deterrent device called a 
&gt;dual-mounted antenna installed in the middle of it.  I've always liked 
&gt;the way it accented the split in the windshield.  8-)

I thread my emblem posts _at_ 10/24 and put nuts on them.

Strangely enuf, barndoor emblems were always threaded. (and have 3 posts, not 4)

Wanna accentuate the split?  Ever seen the barndoor attennas that mount
between the windsheilds, on the separating pillar?  Can't do that on a
&quot;normal&quot; splittie, though...
