Subject: Maiden Voyage (I'm off)


Well, it is time to hit the road.
Yesterday I completed my pre-trip tune up: Timing, points, plugs, plug 
wires, adjusted valves, oil temp gauge, new tires (truck tires) etc. 
oil presure gauge (not hooked up. It seems I'll have to take the fuel 
injection off to get to the place I need to, to hook it up.  
First thing when I get back) 
I'm signing off for 
now. Wish me good luck.

Dave, 
71' westy (77'2.0)
