I looked that one up in my &quot;Complete Book of Collectible Cars: 1940-1980&quot;
[which, incidentally, doesn't have a single transporter, so what can they
know?  But then it was only cars, after all]

speed of about 120 mph.&quot;

What's so unusual about that? and as far as the benefit to weight
distribution... WE know that works, don't we!  I'm always amazed at how
fast front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vans wear out the front tires.  I
watched my brother in law do a U-turn in his Chevy Assho.. I mean Astro!
Poor tires were damn-near torn off the rim, they were so distorted!
