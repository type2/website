Subject:      Re: Oil plug stripped, fix needed

I found the same problem of a stripped out drain plug in my 86 when I
bought it. I tapped it out to the thread size of the pressure relief
valve of a type one engine. I used the plug from a type one because it
is machined to be used with a metal sealing washer that will fit nicely
and seal on the shoulder that is left. You will have to use a large
screwdriver to change the oil though.
