To make things truly interesting, when welding othe VW models to the top 
of Transporters, the same model years should be used.  For instance, a 
1981 Vanagon should have a 1981 Dasher Diesel Station Wagon welded to the 
top, or an '81 Westmoreland (Malibu dash) Rabbit.

Perhaps a '92 Eurovan with a '92 Passat Wagon welded to it's top (I'm not 
volunteering my Passat, mind you) or perhaps a Corrado....--

And all the puppets in this digital jail / They're runnin' around in a frenzy
In search of the Holy Grail. /
They're havin' virtual sex. / They're eatin' virtual food.
No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood.

  --Laurie Anderson, Bright Red/Tightrope (The Puppet Motel)
