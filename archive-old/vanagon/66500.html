Subject:      Re: Procedures for Buying Used Westie in Canada?

Hello Chris:  I am still trying to import an 94 EV Westfalia from Canada.
You need to make sure from the owner that the vehicle meets EPA standards
(look in engine compartment; sometimes on drivers door or door post) and
Department of Transportation safety standards (usually on the drivers door
post).  In my case this requires a letter from VW certifying that it does
meet USA DOT standards.  The letter has been long in coming and may require
alterations - light; speedometer changed from km/hr to mph.

The DOT has a helpful web page specifically on vehicle importing from
Canada.  It is &quot;http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/rules/import/can0797.html&quot;.

Once I have more answers I will post to the vanagan mailing list.

Good luck.

&gt;Hi all. I live in Los Angeles, and am possibly interested in a '91 Westie
&gt;for sale in Canada. I've read here on this list about problems importing a
&gt;new Canadian Eurovan into the U.S. due to smog laws, etc., and am wondering
&gt;if I'll face the same problems with this used Westie.
&gt;
&gt;The scenario would be that I fly into Canada, buy the Westie, and drive it
&gt;back home from there. Are there any kind of &quot;duty charges&quot; imposed at the
&gt;Canadian border for something like this? Any other complications to be
&gt;aware of? Or is it just a simple matter of &quot;pay the man, then cruise home
&gt;hassle free&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Any pointers of advice would be most welcome.
&gt;
&gt;Chris
