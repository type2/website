&gt;My '88 has black plastic air grills at the rear bottom of the front doors. I
&gt;took the door panel off to install a map tray in the right door and noticed
&gt;that the hole in the door behind the grill is taped up with black tape.
&gt;Does anyone know what these grills are for and why they are taped up?

it's a vestige of the old flow-through-the-door ventilation system. but in
1988, they changed it (see the black plastic thingies at the rear of the
rearmost side windows!), and the door grills were no longer needed/wanted.

so rather than redo the door panel (to produce one without the cutout for
the grills), they just taped the outlet over (so you don't get any stray
air flow). :)
