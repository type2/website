&gt;&gt;I figure that if they can't handle a catalog after SIX requests then I

&gt; What a relief! I thought they didn't like me! Obviously, one of two things
&gt;are happening. Either they think they got the market cornered and are not
&gt;worried about getting new customers and making more money OR they just don't
&gt;give a rat's butt.

I think I have to step in at this point and say that I have ordered from
Bus boys exactly one time, and the experience was 100% positive.  They
shipped me exactly what I asked for, got it to me promptly, included a
catalog, and even gave me the Vanagon discount without me asking.  Maybe I
was just lucky?  Until I become unlucky, I will keep ordering from them (if
they have what I need, of course!).
