Subject:      Akron,OH Parts or repair shop?

Greetings-

My friend who owns an 82ish westy called me from Akron with a clutch
problem; sure enough his master cylander is covered with fluid.
I'll probably suggest that he try bleeding the system once to see
if that would work enough to get back to michigan (he can't shift/
stay in first); but in case he needs to do a swap, is there a good
local parts place or repair shop in Akron? The repair shops probably won't
be open on the weekends- I know the  ones down here aren't :(

Thanks
