Martin et al,

I sent the following message to Bob Hoover a couple of days ago and haven't 
heard his opinion yet.  However, your experience has prompted me to go 
public with it (and it's Friday).

After you read it, I hope that you will take the time to open up the gaps 
on you plugs to about .050.  I think that you will find that the 
performance of the CDI will be much better.  At least, if your ignition 
wires hold up.

I welcome anybody else's comments about my 60's research as well.

Thanks,
Mike
