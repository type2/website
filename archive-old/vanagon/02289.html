More on this:
(valve or valves) and (drop or dropped or suck or sucked)
will work to get  a message with
&quot;drop a valve&quot;
or &quot;dropped valves&quot;
or  &quot;sucked valve&quot;
or &quot;go suck an egg, you three-way snot valve&quot;
So much for computer searches, eh?
I find that searches that use the boolean return much more useful 
information than individual words, though.

I'm going to set the gopher to take care of August before I leave.  
That means that the messages from the 30th-31st probably won't make the 
gopher archives.  It's a small price to pay to keep up with August.
