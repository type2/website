Subject: Re: Junkyards in San Jose area?

&gt;Any recommendations?

A place called simply &quot;VW Parts&quot; on San Jose and Almaden (I am not
sure about the exact address, I'm at work. They have _alot_ of stuff,
strictly VW.  If you need anything, they have it, it's just finding it
in the 10 foot piles of parts.  I was able to find a parking brake
lever for a '59 bus there. They are closed Sun and Monday.

Also, Pick-A-Part in SJ has a few (4 or 5) non splittie's so if you are
a late model kind of person, then you might find something there. Again,
I can't remember where that is off the top of my brain, but if you call
information for either of these places, i'm sure they will be able to help
you out.

Good Luck.
