Well, I took it apart, and I'm convinced that the upper (rectangular 
part) of the latch is supposed to slide in AND out.  It only slides out 
and gets stuck there.  It appears to be actuated by a lever with a hole 
in it that a pin goes in and the lever with the hole in it has worn 
through , so there's no longer a hole, just a half a hole.
I've put it together and left the front plate off and will live with it 
like that for a while.

So, I'm looking for a new mechanism, if someone has a mechanism from a 
vanagon.

Thanks.
