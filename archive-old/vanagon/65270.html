Dan,
My bet goes on the ground. Check to make sure you have a good ground to the
sending unit...Good Luck,

&gt;       Well, I have now replaced all the parts that I know of in the Fuel
&gt; Gauge system on my 83.5 in an attempt to not take the thing to the
&gt; dealer and his &quot;VAG&quot; tester. The gauge is still flakey, and van runs out
&gt; of gas before gauge reads empty. No dent in tank. I have replaced
&gt; sending unit, gauge and voltage regulator/stabilizer. Any further
&gt; suggestions?
