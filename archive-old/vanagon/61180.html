Subject: Re: Need some bits...

&gt;From Malcolm:
&gt;I am in need of some little bits to finish this up, though.  The first
&gt;thing I need is the &quot;Transporter&quot; badge from the rear -- this one is
&gt;missing.
&gt;
I called my local dealer here in Vancouver.  He quoted me C$33.04
(US$24.00) for ta new replacement &quot;Transporter&quot; badge.

&gt;Finally:  Are owner's manuals, in English, still available for the trucks in
&gt;Canada?  The regular manual *says* &quot;Transporter&quot;, and actually is the manual
&gt;for the Kombi and the panels, but is there a different one for the trucks?
&gt;I'd love to get one.
&gt;
Checked with the dealer on this one too.  He can get it in for
approximately C$25.00 (US$18.00) but he orders them from the US.  Maybe
check around.
Let me know if you need help in ordering it.
