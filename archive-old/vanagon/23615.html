Subject: 67 westie project 4-sale 1,200.00 (longish)

A fellow called me a few days ago to ask me if I was interested in buying a
bunch of VW parts. He was in the last stages of selling off his personal
possessions and getting ready to move to Colorado to prospect for gold and
wanted to unload the quick.

After a few probing questions I determined he didn't have any schwimmwagen
or Barndoors in his back yard, but did have enough questionable stuff to
warrant him loading it up into his resto project and towing it down to my
place for inspection.

I bought all the stuff from him mainly to aquire some spare stock for me and
a bit more for the swap meets I attend.  Other than the earlyy ghia taillights
and some 50's bug stuff it was mostly bus parts and tons of solex carbs...

I'd like to sell the 67 as is for 1,200.00 (basically what I paid the guy for
it) and will work with someone on the additional stuff based on what they need.

I can supply good rebuilt motor(s) and some non-westie specific parts like
gauges,knobs &amp; switches etc.,etc., to complete the bus and make it a driveaway!

BASIC DESCRIPTION BELOW-------------------------------------------------------

The 'resto-project' turned out to be a 67 pop-top westie with a fairly straight
body but as usual for a Florida vehicle, the obligatory rust in some areas.

The nose has a divit down on the lower driver side, and most of the front skirt
is cancerous. A bit of cancer in the pass door down by the wheelwell and a loose
window frame. The other area that bothers me is the drivers side front fender
well which is a loser.  The last bit of rust is along the drivers side
middle, or opposite the double doors.. WCM sells a replacement panel which
is fairly easy to get to.

The pop-up is intact, has no major damage tho is missing the pop-up hardware &amp;
has no canvas!!!

The windows have all been pulled and the jalosies are missing some glass panes
but there are 6 new window gaskets from West Coast Metric still in a box in the
back.  There seem to be a spare set of (side) pop-out windows and frames and
what appears to be non-vw jalosie windows in the double doors.. The window
frames look like they recieved the brunt of the restoration as most are
primer
coated and look like they have been cleaned up.

The interior is not bad. Rear seat and jump seat are that orange-ish vinyl from
hell which I have in my 72... As a matter of fact I don't know if the interior
dates to 67 or not..It may be later tho the handles on the side closet and under
the rear seat are squarish and not cupped like mine on the 72. Same nauga-wood
style formica, though a bit more teak colored.  The wood headliner is missing in
some areas and warped in others. the cabinets are in nice shape overall and all
intact as far as I can tell.

The motor is in the floor of the bus, stripped down to the shortblock. He said
it was line bored, bearings and a new cam were installed and he stopped short
of re-assembling the rest. I haven't looked well yet, but a brief exam uncovered
more than enough parts to complete the motor.

The tranny was rebuilt and appears that way, tho I don't have any way of
checking the veracity of his statements, someone did alot of work to this
thing
at one time.

The steering box feels tight to and there are a few spare tie-rod ends and a
new drag link in a box in the back.


The westie resides in my back yard down here in Ocala Florida. Arrangements
can be made for trasportation/delivery within a reasonable radius, or if any
