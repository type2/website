Subject: Looking for late '80s Westfalia in LA area

Well, I've put 140K on my 86 Jetta over the last 10 years and have been
contemplating the Westfalia move.  Joined the list to learn and - after
reading, searching, and talking to current owners - have decided to join the
ranks of the converted.  But NOT yet having the best of luck finding one
(yesterday was particularly disappointing as I thought I had one but it got
away). Sooo... if anyone is looking to sell a late '80s Westfalia that's in
pretty good shape (a/c would be nice, I'm flexible on options), or knows
someone else who is, or has any suggestions about finding one in Southern
California -- I'd very much welcome the info.  I live in Santa Monica.

Thanks!!
