&gt; Description fits the Winnie version, has a poptop, has single louvered 
&gt; window on drivers side, rather confined feeling sitting in rear, IMHO.  Had 
&gt; a good look at one at dealer last Dec. The 'full blown' EV Westys have a 
&gt; poptop that is almost invisible, roof line hardly altered.  Painted to match 
&gt; body. Impossible to tell from a distance until you see the 
&gt; seam/weatherstripping crack along the sides.

But the other poster said &quot;no other windows&quot;.  Does the Winnie have windows 
on the passenger side - including in the door?  I agree with the 
confining bit.  I like the layout of the older T2 Westies better than the 
ones since in T3, T4 and Winnie or Westie.  (Personal preference not a 
quality thing.  Get what you want, I'll get what I want...)

Westfalias pop-top (also used on the weekender) is a nicely fitting rig.  
Hadn't seen one on a camper Westy so didn't know.

&gt; &gt;Now show me a Westafalia Camper that seats seven.  Get the one you need....
&gt; 
&gt; Mine will seat six!, just get a middle seat from 7 seater and bolt in rails etc.

Six isn't seven....  And the Weekender doesn't need to buy extra stuff.  
But I'm not convinced you'll get the full width middle seat in with the 
cabinetry without sacrificing door access a lot. &lt;g&gt;

I think the Winnie EV has an optional center seat thingie.  REally 
cramped looking.
