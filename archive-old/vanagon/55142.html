&gt;&gt; What (if any) Eurovan and/or Vanagon comes with:
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  pop top
&gt;&gt;  fold down bed
&gt;&gt;  preferably front wheel drive
&gt;&gt;  2 rear facing seat --OR-- middle bench seat (Either way seats 7)
&gt;&gt;  full fridge
&gt;&gt;  stove and or sink
&gt;&gt;  tables for kids to color on/play board games etc.
&gt;&gt;  cup holders
&gt;&gt;  cabinets
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like you're looking for a motor home.  
&gt;Vanagons ('80-'91) and Eurovans('93+) typically come in either passenger
&gt;versions that seat 7 or Camper versions that seat 4-6.
&gt;No Vanagon or Eurovan was made that BOTH seats 7 AND has the
&gt;fridge/stove/sink/cabinets.
&gt;
&gt;You'll need to choose either the full camping gear or the seating for 7.
&gt;
&gt;Complete Camper models were offered every model year from VW, the later
&gt;models being named the Vanagon Camper GL.  These include all the camping
&gt;stuff, but only seating for 4.  It is possible to add a center 2 passenger
&gt;seat (from a passenger Vanagon) to one of these to bring the seating capacity
&gt;to 6, but it blocks access to the refer/stove/sink.  Whith this arrangement
&gt;you could set the van up for camping/seating for 4 OR seating for 6.
&gt;
&gt;In 1986 &amp; 1987 VW made a basic version of the Camper model that has a
&gt;pop-top, refrigerator, fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating
&gt;for 6 (six).
&gt;
&gt;In 1990 &amp; 1991 they offered the MultiVan model that was similar, offering the
&gt;pop-top,  fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating for 7, but no
&gt;refrigerator.
&gt;Neither of these models offers the stove/sink but do have a single rear
&gt;cabinet.
&gt;
&gt;I believe that in 1993 VW offered the Eurovan MV which was similar to the
&gt;Vanagon MultiVan in layout, but of course with the Eurovan's front mounted 5
&gt;cylinder engine driving the front wheels.  Vanagons have rear mounted 4
&gt;cylinder engines typically driving the rear wheels.  Vanagons were also
&gt;offered in later years with Syncro all-wheel drive.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,
