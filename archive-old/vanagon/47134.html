Subject: Re: Radiator/Coolant Switch

&gt;  Recently there has been some talk of installing a manually operated switch
&gt;to bring on the coolant fan before the limit closes. I'd be interested in
&gt;hearing from anyone who may of done this . I'd like to know how and where you
&gt;mounted the switch , the routing of the wiring, switch type, etc.. I guess
&gt;basically the whole kit n kaboddle, if you like you can respond to me
&gt;directly or just post it on the list.

I carry a 6&quot; piece of reasonably heavy wire with  a spade lug terminal 
crimped on each end.  If you take off the upper grill you can unplug the 
thermo switch. You can bridge the terminals in the socket and kick it into 
low fan.  I made the wire while debugging the system, and now keep it for 
emergencies.  There are 3 terminals for the socket, a ground and low and 
high temp contacts. Fiddle about until you know which is which, then splice 
in a decent switch by baring the ground and low wires then soldering into 
them and reseal. Route the wire through near drivers side as that's where 
all the fan relays etc. are, may as well keep things together.  To trigger 
the hi temp fan you need another wire from ground to it's terminal, I've 
hardly ever heard the high fan kick in, just when climbing in mud on hot hot 
days.  Low fan never runs more than a minute, usually way less.  Tim
