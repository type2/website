Subject: Thanks for EV tire info and more.


&lt;&lt; Worrying about reinforced tires sure limits the selection.  Did the 
Vanagon require reinforced tire, because mine sure never had them? &gt;&gt;

   Definitely. My '89 Westy's PO had shod it with a Sears non-reinforced LT tire
and it's handling was positively squirreley on the Interstate if pushed above 55
MPH, even with no wind.  Semi's passing me became a white-knuckle experience.  I
replaced them with 205x70 Michelin MXL reinforced and have been really happy
with them.
