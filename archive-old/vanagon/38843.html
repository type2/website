Subject: Where to get a little paint?

Hi Volks

I have a '77 Westfalia in lovely VW &quot;this-is-the-70's&quot; green.
I'm about to replace the windshield seal and repair a rust bubble
or 2 - any ideas where I can pick up on the order of a pint of
paint that will match fairly closely?   Or will I have to get a
full batch?  Heck - I'd settle for a can of fairly closely matching
spraypaint.  I might get this bus fully repainted someday.

	Thanks
		Jay
