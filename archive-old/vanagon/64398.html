Subject:      Upper speedo cable

Last night I tried to replace my upper speedo cable.  I succeeded in
getting it disconnected, etc. but upon trying to pull it out from
underneath, I got it stuck someplace.

The white connector was already off the end so there is very little to snag
on the cable itself.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to see to the
problem area.  Even if I simply cut off what pieces of cable I could get
to, I am concerned about being able to get the newer cable down!

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

TIA
