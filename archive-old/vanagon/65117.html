Subject:      incredible find: dashtop tray with cupholders

Remember that bandwith about the elusive dashtop tray with the two
cupholders and a couple of other miscellaneous containers?  I found one
yesterday off a fresh 82ish Vanagon in a boneyard.  It's fully intact and
was held to the dash by velcro.  Looks like the only place to use it on my
86 or 88 would be right over the dash ashtray with the lid closed.

Anyway, who was it that was looking for one to make a mold from a while
back?
