        Getting Back on the Horse


I never learned to ride.  That is, no one ever taught me.  When I
was a kid I thought I could ride.  I could bring a team home from
the field and could even cinch a saddle, climb on and go
somewhere.  But when I got a job on a cattle ranch near
Porterville, the horses made it plain they thought I was a total
fool when it came to horsemanship, and took every opportunity to
make sure everyone knew it. 

The day began by selecting our mounts from the home herd, about
twenty head that were kept at the ranch headquarters.  You need
two horses to do a full day's work.  We would saddle one and lead
the other, or put them in trailers and tow them to cattle.

The horses were cattle-smart and knew a good rider from a bad
one.  After a few days they refused to work with me, bucking me
off with amazing ease.  I'd climb back on and they'd eventually
calm down but we was popping six-year old range-bred cattle out
of heavy brush on some Forest Service acreage up in the foothills
and it called for perfect rapport between man and horse.  To make
matters worse, I didn't know a latigo from a garter belt and
missed half my throws.

After a couple of days the foreman decided to let me go but the
owner of the ranch, who happened to be a dentist with a chain of
offices up and down California, saw us working up the string that
morning and told El Segundo to keep me on.  I ended up fixing
windmills, working out of a jeep and I earned my pay.  Later, the
foreman told me what happened at the work-up.  He told the owner
he was letting me go and the owner asked if I always got back on
after each of my many flights, several of which he witnessed that
morning.  The foreman said yes I did, which was true, but that I
couldn't ride and couldn't rope, which was also true.

The owner told the foreman to find me something to do, that
getting back on the horse was the mark of a man.  I was fourteen
at the time.

Three days ago I was turning a piece of stainless steel in the
lathe, didn't pay attention to what I was doing and damn near cut
off my thumb.  The swarf was coming off as a razor sharp ribbon. 
I was keep it clear of the tool by prodding it now and then with
the chuck key when something distracted me just as the swarf took
a turn around the work and wound itself into a snarl with my
thumb inside.  It caught my thumb just by the first knuckle and
sliced through the flesh like a scalpel, taking off a chunk of
meat all down the side, neat as you please.

If you work around machinery your hands generally catch hell and
I've had my share of crushed fingers and lacerations.  But never
one as easily avoidable as this.  Nor as bad.  I felt like a damn
fool, and rightly so.

Of course, I commenced to pump claret in all directions while I
got the lathe shut down and scooted into the house leaving a
trail of spots the size of quarters.  Then I started getting
shocky from the thrill of it all and began shaking so bad I
couldn't treat the wound.  My wife gets upset at the sight of
such things and I try not to show her my frequent cuts &amp; scrapes
but I was shaking so bad and bleeding so fast I needed her help. 
She just about died when she saw me.  Turns out, I'd sprayed a
bit of juice here and there, on my face and the front of my shirt
-- she thought I'd slit my throat with a razor.

I finally got myself cleaned up but it was a pretty good whack,
tender and achy.  I didn't go back out to the shop that night.

Yesterday I cleaned up the mess.  Blood causes things to rust and
there were already some etched marks on the bed of the lathe. 
But with my thumb all bundled up my touch was about as deft as a
surgeon wearing baseball mitts.  And I didn't much like the
thought of finishing the job.  Was I getting so old I was
dangerous around tools?  I started up the lathe but didn't feed
the tool into the work, just stood there watching it spin for a
while then shut it off.  Even handling the controls was painful.

I went back to the shop this morning and cleaned up some more,
fiddled with the lathe.  I could make the part out of brass.
Brass would work just as well and its swarf wouldn't cut butter. 
I took the part out of the lathe and thought about it, bouncing
the thing up and down in my good hand.  I've got some brass rod
that would do, back under the bench someplace.  I set about
finding it.  

It was awkward, working with a bandaged thumb but I chucked-up
the 1-1/4&quot; brass rod, faced it off, drilled it through, mounted
the squared end back into the chuck, cut it to length and turned
it down to the diameter of the needed thread.  Brass threads a
treat.  I stoned the threading tool, reset the tool carriage to
twenty-nine degrees and threaded the part.  I'd already made up a
threaded mandrel to hold it and chucked it into that to cut the
internal tread with a tap.  I've been using machine tools all my
life and usually enjoy making a little part like this.  But this
time I got no enjoyment from the work.

This evening I did the e-mail and there was a bunch of it,
including a long, apologia from a young fella whose hand I've
been holding as he did his first engine overhaul.  He had started
out three months ago with about a zillion questions, all derived
from reading the magazines, and he had a tiresome habit of asking
each one of them about three different ways a couple of days
apart, as if testing me.  Or perhaps trying to get me to agree
that removing the air-vanes was a good idea, or a compression
ratio of 9.5:1 was okay if he promised to drive real careful.  A
college kid of course.  

He had decided to pack it in.  Doing things right was just too
much bother.  His message made it clear that he thought his
failure was all my fault.  

Maybe it was.  Maybe I didn't explain things clearly enough.  

The message bothered me more than it should.  The kid had spent a
ton of money buying tools and parts he didn't need and he never
would of tackled the overhaul if he hadn't stumbled across the
'sermon' file while surfing the net.  Now his bug was an
engineless wreck.  He would of been better off if he'd never
started.  Or would he? 

I started to write the kid a soothing reply, urging
him to stick with it.  But somehow the words just wouldn't come.

It really bothered me.  Around midnight I went back out to the
shop, found the stainless steel fitting, chucked it up and finished 
the job, dealing with he swarf the way I should of dealt with it to 
begin with.  The thumb was clumsy but life isn't always smooth.  

When the part was done it was a diamond bright hunk of machined
stainless steel, threaded internally and externally, edges neatly
chamfered.  I hit it with the polishing mop and a bit of rouge
just because it was so pretty.  And because I wanted it to be
something I could be proud to have made, with my tools and my
skills and my own two hands.

I'm sorry the kid gave up on the engine overhaul but I don't
think it was my fault.  I think a lot of people nowadays just
don't have the balls to get back on the horse when it throws
them.  And that's kind of sad because in a lot of ways, hanging
in there when the going gets rough really is the mark of a man.

I didn't write the kid a soothing response.  I sat down and wrote
this.
