Subject: Bob and oil galleys

Hey Bob,
	Thanks for your expert advise on oil galley plugs.   I have 1 question.   You mentioned priming 
the threaded plug then locktitening it.   What is priming?   Do you suppose the starving &quot;corner lifters&quot; 
occur in air vanagons?

All this talk on Vanagons on the Net is worth years of psycotheraphy!!!

Thanks again Bob for your time.
