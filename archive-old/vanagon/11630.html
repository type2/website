Yeah, Waxoyl is good stuff if you can find it where you are. A friend of 
mine has a concours-winning 1303 and swears by the black stuff, which is 
tough to get even here. I have also used Waxoyl underseal, which has a 
wonderful consistency a bit like mayonnaise, and doesn't go hard and crack 
like other types and stays looking shiny and black. Finnigans make some 
other good stuff. Like Hammerite, which is a thick, rust inhibiting paint 
that is good for floorpans and suspension parts and Coppaslip, a grease that 
you use on brake and suspension components and that lasts forever.
