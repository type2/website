Subject: Back from travels

Me+Girlfriend+Daughter are just back from two weeks touring France and 
Spain, covered around 2000 miles in the '73 van. It was a most enjoyable
trip and the first long (relative I s'pose) trip I've done. Didn't break
down at all, :-) which was amazing considering all the things that have occurred
in the last year.
The only low points were getting lost on a goat track in the Pyrenees, van 
broken into on the second day, van searched going from Spain to France. So
all in all I can't really complain.
Right, now for a question, the voltmeter in the dash has a tendancy to flash
up to around 16-18 volts for no time at all, then back down to a normal level.
What can be doing this, is the alternator on the way out, I assume there's
a regulator around somewhere, is that on its way out?

Cheers
