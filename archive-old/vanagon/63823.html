Subject: Beach Vanagons and a window slider question


     Checked out those two &quot;beach patrol&quot; Type2s on the web page referenced 
     the other day.
     
     Too bad they don't use those on &quot;Baywatch&quot; - I'd really be tempted to 
     tune in.
     
     On a more practical note, I've got a loose slider latch - I know that 
     there's a screw or two inside those buggers, but I can't figure out 
     how they disassemble.  Do they &quot;fall&quot; apart when the window is 
     removed?  Can't believe that Bentley chose not to help on this one - 
     they seem to spend enough time explaining how some of the real obvious 
     things come apart.
     
     TIA
