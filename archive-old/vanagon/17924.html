HEY JAMES!!  Congrats on your new purchase!   It helps a LOT to have that
spare engine in your pocket!  I am in perpetual (1600) rebuild mode with
the '71 Campmobile and three running Bugs.  I remember when you first 
got on the list, and you have certainly advanced to Phase III quickly!!
I could just see you out there in Nebraska working on that '71 bus day in, 
day out;  oblivous to time, space, food, the woman...  
...It's a tragic addiction. 
 Hang in there!!  It's the COOLEST ride on the road!
