Subject: Re: *** Needed, source for metric hose ***

A few years ago I got the nice German cloth braided stuff (in oil and gas line 
sizes) from:

Kohlweiss Import Auto Parts
3150 Spring St
Redwood City, CA 94063

(415) 367-8424

At least I _think_ it was them...

Good VW shop, BTW.

&gt; As the title implies, I am looking for a distributor, a shop, or a
&gt; manufacturer who carries metric size hose, for applications on my Bus.  I
&gt; have searched for months now for the right size hoses for my L Jetronic Fuel
&gt; Injection system.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, does anyone know how to get ahold of BOSCH directly?  Please let me
&gt; know.
