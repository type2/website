Subject: Trip Report: Weekend in Lake George, NY (Long)

Hi folks,

We're back from another fun filled weekend in the 71 Westy.  On Friday I
looked at the MIG I posted about last week--it looked like a great deal so I
bought it (thanks to lister Mike West for his helpful advice).
Unfortunately I didn't have time to play with it since I was preparing to
leave for the weekend, so I packed my &quot;new&quot; toy away in the basement and
headed up to Lake George, NY.

My wife and I invited my mother and her dog &quot;Scruffy&quot; (who just LOVES VW
buses!) for a camping weekend to see the highlights of the Lake George
region.  My mother was aghast when I bought my first bus six years ago.  For
some reason she associated VW buses with Charles Manson.  She refered to my
old '70 Westy un-fondly as &quot;the Charles Manson van&quot; for quite awhile--that
is, until she realized how useful it was to have someone in the family with
a van that could carry large furniture, appliances, etc. (on a moment's
notice like a good son ;) ).  After that, and after a fun filled camping
trip to Saratoga Springs in the '70, she's been singing the praises of VW
vans and I haven't heard Charlie's name mentioned in awhile!  She even looks
for blumenvasens when she goes to flea markets!  I was taken aback when one
day she asked--&quot;So Ron, do they make those buses with automatics?&quot;  Wow,
mom's considering buying a bus--bus karma conquers all!

The drive to Lake George from Hartford is only about 4 hours (never kept
close track of the time, too much fun driving!).  The drive up was
uneventful aside from a peculiar toll booth incident.  An older woman in a
volvo wagon seemed to be taking awhile at the booth as I waited behind her.
When I pulled up to the booth to pay my $1.60, the toll guard said &quot;No
charge!&quot;  Huh?  I just said thanks and pulled away, quickly remembering
someone on the list who mentioned something about discounted toll charges a
few weeks ago.  I assumed this was just some &quot;weekend special&quot;.  Then it
occured to me, maybe that woman in front of me paid my toll (saw something
on Oprah about some &quot;random act of kindness&quot; idea where you pay the toll for
the stranger behind you).  Geez, if I had thought quickly enough I could've
paid the toll for the person behind me and spread the good will along.
Well, I decided, I'll have to commit a random act of kindness on my way back
to set the karma in balance.  Feeling somewhat guilty and ashamed of my
&quot;contribution&quot; to the karma deficit and a little confused (normal state for
me), I continued on to the camp area.

Lake George is a touristy place--not for the cravings of a syncro owner who
wants to forge over unmapped mountains on the weekends--but good enough for
us and plenty of fresh air and water surrounded by scenic mountainside.  My
wife and my mother spent some time in the village area looking at a crafts
fair and through the &quot;discount&quot; tourist shops.  Scruffy and I walked around
the village and milled in areas where dogs were allowed.  I learned that
it's really easy to attract women when you have a cute little pooch as your
companion (how come nobody told me this before I married?!;) ).  Scruffy
(and me) were getting a lot of attention.  I kept worrying that Scruffy
would turn into psycho-dog (as he sometimes does) when some kind soul was
petting him.  He was probably having sensory overload from all the new
sights, sounds and people.  It was difficult to find a quiet spot within the
carnival-like atmosphere, so we eventually just picked a less travelled spot
and chatted with the many women who stopped to admire Scruffy.  Ahhh a dog's
life....

When we regrouped (Ron, why do you have that silly smile on your face?--Have
you been flirting? God, I can be read like a book!) we decided to visit the
historic attraction, Fort William Henry. The fort was built in 1755 and
burned down by the French and Indians two years later--not the best of track
records for a fort.  Scruffy was allowed in and it seemed like a quieter
alternative to the bustling village area.  The highlights of the tour were
demonstrations of British colonial-era weaponry (which we later learned
meant firecracker-simulated-grenade throwing, musket shooting and cannon
fire).  I should mention that my mother was insistent on keeping Scruffy by
our sides throughout the trip's activities and needless to say, he was a bit
frazzled after the military demonstrations with the cannon fire as a finale.
I decided it wasn't a good idea for kids to pet Scruffy under these trying
circumstances, lest they pull back a few less fingers after the musket went
off.  In all seriousness, covering his ears during the demonstrations helped
him along, and he seemed to take the activities of his crazy human
companions in stride.

After breaking for lunch in the bus we decided to head up the the Barton
garnet mine in North River, a 45 minute drive from Lake George.  Our last
visit to the area included a trek up the mountain to the mine only to find
the main area was closed, so this time we hoped to make the full tour.
Garnets at the Barton mine aren't like the formations we have in CT.  It's
virtually impossible to find perfect crystals--only fractured fragments of
garnet.  The garnets at the Barton mines are very useful for industrial
applications (garnet paper, abrasives) and some larger, less fractured
pieces can be cut for jewelry.  We collected some specimens (Scruffy
followed our lead and dug in the garnet encrusted dirt by the pond in the
mine area) and headed back to the shop where we chatted with the very
friendly and knowledgeable gemstone cutter.

On the way back down the mountain we had our sole problem on this trip with
our bus.  Something smelled like it was burning so I pulled off to one of
the few level areas, grabbed the extinguisher and helped my passengers out.
After a quick inspection I saw smoke coming from the front passenger wheel.
I jacked up the bus and removed the tire to find the rotor darkened and the
caliper giving off some smoke.  I grasped the rotor with a rag and it turned
freely albeit with a slight resistance.  Lajiri pressed on the brake pedal
and the caliper closed as it should and upon release, the rotor would turn
with the same slight resistance.  I carefully removed (one false move and
your fingers get cooked) the brake pads to have a look.  The groove in the
inner pad was blocked with brake lining dust.  I cleaned out the channel and
removed the anti-squeal shims to provide a little more clearance.  The
brakes didn't heat up again for the rest of the trip, but I suspect that
caliper (rotors and pads are new as of last summer) might be a problem since
something similar happened to this same wheel last summer.  Perhaps an
intermittently sticking caliper--that will have to be a priority fix before
I start playing with the MIG--awww shucks!

After leaving the mountain, we browsed at a local mineral shop and then
headed back onto route 9. When we reached the nearest civilization we were
soon surrounded by VW buses!  Wow, this is really strange, I wonder what's
up?  We waved to a bunch of guys who were hanging out by their late model
baywindow and pulled into a gas station across the street for a much needed
bag of ice for the cooler.  Upon returning to my bus, I saw a couple phishy
looking fellows standing guard over my bus.  

&quot;What's up guys, is there a show in the area?&quot;--me, not being a dead or
phish head, thinking and meaning &quot;VW&quot; show.  I've never been caught in a
flood of VW buses outside a swap meet/show and for some reason, it wasn't
registering (despite all the prominently displayed Phish stickers among
others) that these folks were here for a concert.

&quot;Yeah, is this your bus?&quot;  One of them said, apparently trying to figure out
how I could be in the area with a VW bus and not know what's up.  I nodded
it was my bus.  &quot;Uhhh, do you know anything about fixing buses?&quot;

Now at least something was becoming clear to me.  These guys weren't just
hanging out across the street, they were stuck.  &quot;What year is it?&quot; I asked.
He said it was a '78.  Great, the first time I stick my head in the engine
compartment of a later model bus it will be an emergency-troubleshooting
situation.  &quot;I'll see what I can do, I'll meet you across the street.&quot;  I
got into my bus and explained to my mother and Lajiri that I'd see if I
could help these bussers in distress.  No problem from the crew, we're all
roadside breakdown veterans, but I wondered if my mother was thinking
Charles Manson thoughts as she spied the hippies around us (!).

I drove across the street and met a half dozen hippy dudes and one dudette
looking forlorn.  Turned out they were from Connecticut, too, and they came
up for the show (believe it or not, even at this point I'm still not getting
it--I was going to ask them how the swap meet was, but I figured I should
look at the patient first).  &quot;So what happened?&quot; I asked.

The mechanically-interested representative among them stepped forward and
described a loud pop sound and then a stammering and loss of engine power.
They couldn't get it restarted after that, though the starter cranked fine.
That was half an hour ago. I suddenly wished I hadn't deleted all those
posts about pancake engines.  I tried to contact David Schwarze
telepathically to draw on his knowledge--but to no avail.  &quot;Brain, access
all troubleshooting records from vanagon and type2 lists for 78 buses&quot;--ahh,
if real life were only as simple as Star Trek the Next Generation... 

I hunkered down and decided to check the basics: (spark, fuel, air, timing,
compression--hah!, now I know why you later model guys are losing spark
plugs under that tin--quite a long trip down to find the missing plug!)  I
kept the Bentley nearby to ward off evil spirits and opened my tool boxes to
intimidate the bus into submission.  Spark checked out and after trying to
find the fuel pump for a couple minutes, I was able to verify that was
working.  It was cranking over fine, but no combustion (friction seemed fine
;) ).  During my survey I made mental notes of things that needed
replacement: both CV shafts had play in them, fuel hose rubbing against heat
exchanger on the passenger side, cam gear on distributor shaft seemed to
have a lot of play in it.  The Phish folks' mechanical ambassador said the
engine was rebuilt a short while ago--but he also said he just checked for
spark and there wasn't any--which clearly wasn't the case.

I spent about five minutes surveying the vacuum hoses, admiring the engine
design (couldn't help myself), and thinking through the problem.  Fuel pump
ok, spark at all plugs, what about air?  That's when I reached for the
throttle valve.  Hmmm, what is this frayed cable?  I opened the valve with
my finger--&quot;Try to start it!&quot;  The engine rumbled back to life, idling low,
probably really flooded at this point.  Cheers wrang up from both buses and
the lightbulb in my head was shining brightly.  I looked closely at the
frayed cable.  Looked like it had snapped and someone had rigged a nut/bolt
to hold it in place but the cable didn't like that.  I secured it so they
could get home, gave them some wire to do a quicky repair if it failed over
the next 200 miles, and informed the owner about the other needed repairs I
noticed.  So it was just flooded and needed a little air--like all of us!

When I was packing up my tools and everyone was loading up into their
respective buses the owner of the '78 asked me something about Phish.  &quot;Oh,
I'm not a fan,&quot; I said (by now I realized the only VW show around here was
the one we were providing right now on the side of the road).

He looked at me funny, &quot;So what are you doing around here?&quot;

&quot;We came up to check out the garnet mines.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  Well, thanks.&quot;  And off they went.  Who was that masked man? ;).

Needless to say, I was quite happy with myself getting that mysterious
pancake engine back to life in record time even if it was a no-brainer.  We
didn't see the '78 bus phishers as we drove home, so I assume they made it
back o.k.

Later that evening we stopped at a gas station on the turnpike for our final
fillup.  We'd been passing/waving to buses all the way home since everyone
was coming from &quot;the show&quot; (or maybe the garnet mine).  We were one of three
Westy baywindows at the pumps--man that felt wierd.  It's almost like you're
not an odd-ball when everyone drives one--nahh, if everyone drove one we'd
still all be odd-balls!  I fellow came up to me when I was about to wash the
bugs off the windshield.  &quot;I noticed your V_at_L sticker--I'm not on the list,
but I have a sticker on my Fox.&quot;  Wow, that's neat, my first sticker-road
encounter (thanks again to Joe Fournier for providing me with a sticker!)!
I forgot the fellow's name now but he mentioned he was a friend of Chris
Krahforst--Hey I know Christian! (well virtually/internetly speaking!).  We
both agreed that Christian has a very fine bus.  We said our goodbyes and
headed back out on the road.  I knew then I'd have to file a trip
report--too much bus activity packed into this trip not to mention!

I stopped at the toll booth, still remembering the karma deficit and the
random act of kindness yet undone.  As I handed the toll guard the ticket,
she said &quot;You don't owe anything, you're all set sir.&quot;  Huh?  I tried to ask
her why and she just stared at me sternly and said louder &quot;You're all set,
sir, you can go now.&quot;  Ok, so it's nice not to pay tolls, but I still don't
know what's up and now I don't know if I owe two random acts of kindness or
if these guards are just messing with my head.  I pulled away from the toll
booth and we all laughed and commented about this weekend's toll booth
experiences.  Scruffy woke up from his favorite spot in the rear of the bus
and looked at us.  Crazy humans...
