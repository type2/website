Subject: Selecting Gears



&gt; Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; Before dropping the engine, check the shifter linkage at the base of the gear
&gt; shift lever.  If for some reason you do not have sufficient lateral travel it
&gt; would be impossible to select reverse.

Bob,

Originally i thought it was the linkage but we took it out and it seemed
okay. Its not just it won't select reverse but all the gears are a
struggle to select. I think it something to do with the gear selector
at the front of the tranny, i was thinking of replacing just this front bit
and swap the drive shafts. Any ideas would be great!

Cheers,
