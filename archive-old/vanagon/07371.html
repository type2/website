Subject:      thermostat:

ok. looking in the bentley book, for 86-91 vanagons with a/c, the
'thermostat' for the a/c is in the D-pillar ... those big plactic columns
at the back of the bus, behind the rearmost side windows ... and there is
also the thing Derek was talking about: an ambient temperature switch.
which bentley says &quot;switches A/C compressor OFF when outside temperature
is under 38 degrees F&quot;  (the thermostat &quot;switches A/C compressor OFF when
evaporator temperature reaches pre-determined value&quot; ... the pre-determined
value being what you set the dash/overhead temp switch to).

now ... the picture shows the ambient temp switch INSIDE the car, but maybe
it is poking through a hole to the outside of the car. it would be exiting
somewhere behind those plastic grills for the air intakes.

unfortunately, bentley does NOT have any 80-85 vanagons or any other buses
... but we all know that lots of other years had a/c. so where is the same
stuff on them?  none of my books have any info. :(
