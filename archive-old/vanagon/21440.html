Subject: Re: (F)Jack the heater guru

&gt;...After I contacted JB's about heat for my 
&gt;van he steered me towards a Stewart Warner unit for installation under 
&gt;the rear seat, which is not at all a stock installation.  

I spoke with Ark Mirvis (the other heater guy out in NJ) at the Litchfield,
CT meet.  He was also trying to push the Stewart Warner model that mounts in
the interior.  He was selling them for $500 each (I can't remember the btu
output now).  Said he bought about 100 of them and now only has a few left.
He claimed that because of some design patent that expired from another
company, Stewart Warner was able to improve the design of their heaters and
he thought these new models were a well-built and the best way to go
(efficient, solid design).  Of course, he might have 100 of them sitting in
his basement, too!!

It was interesting to me that he wasn't selling anything at the meet and all
the heaters he brought were for display purposes only.  I think he must be
raking in the bucks (he also seems to have a good reputation).  He said he
has connections in Germany where he gets his Eberspacher parts new.

But Ark is expensive--for example:  For the USED 3 pieces of plastic (white
plastic) that comprise the recirculating air ducting on a 72 and up BN4
heater he wants $80.  Since I only needed one piece, I kept checking around
and found that Bus Heaven has the one piece I need NOS for $13!  Very big
difference!
