Subject: Trade syncro Westy for non syncro

Hi all. After lots of thought, and I thank all those who offered their
westies before, my wife and I would like to trade our 86 Syncro Westy for a
comparable non syncro Westy. We love the Westy but we really don't need the
syncro, and parts are more!! Anyway, Siegfried has ~114,000 miles, ~6500 of
those on a VW remanufactured engine, runs great, locking diff works, A/C, 4
plus low plus reverse speed, all screens etc. Anyway, wanted to throw this
out for the masses to comment on. Think about the snow and skiing and
etc.!!
