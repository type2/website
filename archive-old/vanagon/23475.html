Subject: Many Questions, Few Answers

Hey now,
        Few answers only because I haven't posted these yet-here goes:

1. My engine eats distributors. I'm on #3 and I noticed today that it is
not long for this world &lt;needs Bob's blessing, perhaps? Last rites? ;-)  &gt;.
It seems like the distributors don't quite mesh with the drive gear-the
surfaces only have around .050&quot; or so to mesh, rather than what would
appear to be around .200&quot; or so (I didn't actually measure these, just
guessing). The result is that they slowly get chewed up, until the drive
gear wears its way through the distributor-then only silence is heard.
Whilst perusing St. Muir this noon, I noted that my engine is actually a
'70 Type 1 engine. I have bought distributors for a '70 Type 2 in the past,
could this be my problem? Or can/should I somehow shim the distributor
drive gear? How? In other words, is the distibutor for a Type 1 slightly
onger than a Type 2? I don't think so, but ya never know... This brings me
to my next question...

2. My engine code, according to St. Muir, is that of a '70 Type 1 36hp. I
purchased the engine from a rebulider, would a rebuilder make it the same
as before, or perhaps buff it out some, bringing it to 40 (or more) hp? It
was a cheapie rebuild-around $450 street, I paid $300 'cause the guy at the
parts counter is a good friend.

3. I have read-in advertisements for same-that window tint helps to reflect
ambient heat as well as sunlight. Kinda seems to me that a dark surface,
such as window tint, would tend to _absorb_ heat, rather than radiate it.
Unless of course it was cooler outside than in, but that don't happen in
Tejas. Is this just advertising hoopla? Anybody tint thier windows and see
a noticable cooling effect? BTW, I mean temprature-wise, not that _cool_
&quot;Cal Look&quot;. Nipped that one in the bud...   ;-) ;-) ;-)

        I guess thats all for now, thanks in advance for all your help and
advice.

Peace,
