&gt; =======================
&gt; ACTUALLY -- I have been introduced to something like that.  See's candy (here
&gt; in California) makes (chocolate?) covered coffee beans that you actually do
&gt; pop into your mouth, chew, and swallow.  I was introduced to them by my oldest
&gt; son.

I'm addicted to chocolate coverd coffee (sometimes called espresso) beans.

Only eat a few at a time though.  To throw a little VW back in - don't 
operate your Transporter (any generation) after a few of these.  You get 
out and push the T1/T2 down the interstate or try to race the Porsche in 
your T3/T4 (Okay put the T3 diesel in the first category....)
