&gt;         Now, I have a question. This van shows lower temps on hotter days and
&gt; hotter conditions such as in town. When out on the freeway, the temp
&gt; goes above the led, when I would think it should go down.
&gt;
&gt;         If I pull over after a run on the freeway, with the higher temp
&gt; reading, the overflow tank overflows. However, the hoses to and from the
&gt; radiator are not hot at all, and the fan is not going.

I just had this problem, fixed now thanks to the list.  First thing to
check is the coolant tank cap.  It's on the plastic tank on the left
side of the engine.  Take it off, suck on the tube that goes to the
overflow tank.  If there is any air flow, it is bad.  Cost about $12 at
VW.
