Subject: Looking for roof rack clamps


  This weekend I finally found a full length roof rack for my '66 Westy  :-)
   However, it is missing three of the six hold down clamps :-(
    Anyone know of a source for these??
    The rack is identical to the one on the bus
     on the cover of the March 97 VW Trends issue, except longer of course!
     They are &quot;wishbone&quot; shaped, about 7 inches long,, please make my day!!  
      TIA      Pink
