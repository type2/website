   Well, Ihave decided to spend the extra $20, and get a personalized
license plate. I have thought of some ideas, ranging from bus-related,
to just plain silly. If anyone has thought of any that I missed, or
would care to vote for your favorites, I will certainly bear all that in
mind, and alert everyone to my final choice...
 It's the standard 8 character deal...
