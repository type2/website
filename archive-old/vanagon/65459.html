Anybody know whether there is an equivalent Yokohame in 205/70 R14?

&gt;Here's what I know about them:

&gt;Yokohama Y370D 195/75 R14
&gt;8 ply side walls
&gt;Load range &quot;d&quot;
&gt;40k mileage warranty
&gt;
&gt;Vanagon_dot_com says 45 psi front and 52 psi rear is recommended.  Anyone
&gt;have any thoughts as too whether or not this is a good pressure?  I
&gt;think the tire place left at around 35 psi.  (The tires have a max psi
&gt;of 61, I think)
