&gt; Subject: VWoA did fine by me

&gt; I have an 87 Syncro with 60K that just developed  &quot;The
&gt; Leak&quot;.  As a result of the discussions on this list I called
&gt; VWoA to discuss. They were very nice, requested local dealer
&gt; verification of the problem. It is now at Whitney VW
&gt; in Villa Park Il. for head replacement at no cost to me.
&gt; When the holidays slowed repairs they rented a car for me,
&gt; again at 0 cost. I sure can not complain.

Whitney has a reputation as a *real* VW dealer.  Remember
those?  They host VW shows for NIVA (Northeastern Illinois
Volkswagen Association).  I have heard nothing bad about
them at all.
