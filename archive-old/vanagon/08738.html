Subject: Book Project

Technically, every individual contribution belongs copyrighted to the person
who posted it, so there is a sort of a legal sticky wicket involved in
publishing a book of our submissions. 

Legal issues didn't seem to stop me from posting an article from Road and
Track a few weeks go without permission. And it doesn't seem to stop Joel
from posting those marvelous Trailer Life articles and other articles. But
the fact remains that any one of us could sue if a book were published using
our submissions without our permission.

Let's assume the authors of the best stuff were asked for permission. They
would grant it provided that the original authors/posters would be
compensated in proportion to the amount of space in the book that the
submissions occupy. That means that people would not be compensated for
sending meaningless messages like &quot;I never thought of that!&quot; or &quot;I'm thinking
of painting my van Red!&quot; would get no compensation. People who really share
with this list, like, &quot;Problems And Solutions For Vanagon Coolent Change&quot;
would get the bucks.

All division of the royalties would have to be done after a cut for the
editors (probably about 33% since the editing load is so big) and a nice-guy
cut/gratuity for Gerry simply for tending the list (10%?). 

Realistically, you would probably have to slice the project into pre and post
1980.

There seems to be an inverse relationship to the frequency of someone
submitting and the quality of material submitted, with the possible exception
of Joel, who submits material at the top and the bottom and everwhere in
betweeen of the quality pyramid. 

There are some fine, fine, submissions on this list apart from the chatter.
