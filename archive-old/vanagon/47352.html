&gt; Really?  I had been thinking of replacing the headlights on my '85 
&gt; with the headlights from the '87 parts bus I just bought, because 
&gt; my '85's headlights are so dim.  I had been told that the '86-on 
&gt; headlights are significantly brighter.  Is that correct?
&gt; 
Only if you drive with highbeams all the time. The low beams *suck*. 
They're even worse than my Jetta. By comparison with early Vanagons, 
the lows seem about the same, but the highs are *much* better.

My solution is to pull over, light a fire, and pour a glass of wine 
when it gets dark... ;)
