Subject: V6anagon soon to be re-V6'ed


Well, would you believe I get a new clutch (parts) under warranty? Love
those dudes at World Parts Depot, 4990 Naples St., San Diego, to death!!!

A list member yesterday made a very interesting observation. Mentioned
that he had done lots of clutch work on a variety of VWs, a few of which
had adapters. On one of these, the problem turned out to be an incorrect
or mis-positioned engine mount, that was maybe 2&quot; higher than it should
have been (if I've got this right).

Makes me wonder about the V6anagon's mounts. It has two-- the front (FIF)
tranny mount, which is stock; and a fabricated rear one that's welded
onto the old rear engine hanger bar. Both are flexible rubber mounts,
as most cars have. But there's a whole lot of weight suspended between
them. I wonder if it's enough to cause slight deformation where the
engine and tranny join?

It's raining today, but I still may slide under the van to measure that
alignment ridge in the tranny adapter. I'll also have a look at a couple
of flanges on the Chevy V6, that look a lot like engine mounts to me.
They are right up against the adapter, and would be handy to relieve some
of the weight stress on the engine-tranny junction. Fabrication city, of
course,but you pays your money and takes your chances.

And the band plays on... stay tuned.
