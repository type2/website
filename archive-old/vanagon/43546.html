Subject: Vanagons: How lumpy is your idle?
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 1996 19:26:56 -0700

Vanagons (wasserboxers) are notorious for their irregular idle. My '87 2.1l 
certainly doesn't idle as smoothly as I'd like it to. I'm just curious how 
lumpy the idle is on other similar Vanagons. With mine, the engine shakes 
and often I can feel the shake in the driver's seat. The shifter vibrates 
back and forth. The lumpiness is periodic--it runs smooth for several 
seconds and then shakes a bit and then recovers and so on and so on. I've 
wondered if my O2 sensor is responding too slowly.
