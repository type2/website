Thanks to all of you who responded to my Vanagon Realities ponderings.  We
appreciated the opinions and information that we received and now to
assimilate it all!  Special thanks to Joel Walker for all his data.

I find myself still waivering in both directions.  I have always enjoyed
V.W.'s and have in fact had both a 1967 &amp; 68 beetle, both the best vehicles
to handle the road we live on.  Alas, in 1981 I went to work on a small
island just off the coast here and had to leave the '68 parked on the
government wharf where I caught the commuter boat.  Came back 3 days later
to learn that some kids had thrown my car into the ocean, I guess to see if
it would float - it didn't.  My insurance didn't cover drowning so it turned
out rather dismally.  Haven't had a V.W. since but still have warm memories
- interesting vehicles to work on.

Saw a bus for sale on the side of the road the other night and felt a spark
of interest.  I looked at the popped up top and then looked at the frost
glistening on the windshield and then thought that this is probably the
warmest part of the whole of Canada right now and we want to camp out . . .
So, as I say we will look at the information and try to make an intelligent
decision or failing that we'll just allow ourselves to be sucked into the
V.W. mystique.

Thanks again. . . K.
