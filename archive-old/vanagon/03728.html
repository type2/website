Ok, so what is a &quot;pickel fork&quot; and where does one buy them. Do you just go to
FLAPs and ask for a pickel fork?

 As for using the &quot;proper tool&quot; instead, what is the proper tool, the exact
one VW specifies in the manual?

By the way, what manual do you guys in the UK go by?, our bentley or
something else published over there?
