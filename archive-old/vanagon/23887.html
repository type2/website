Subject:       Re: Syncro Upgrade

Upgrading a 2wd to Syncro Vanagon would not be an easy task.  There 
are many body differences underneath to take into account.  Even the 
fuel tank is a different shape and is in the rear above the 
transmission.  There are special frame modifications done at the 
factory for this conversion by VW, and front suspension is different 
as well.  Many components are either hard to come by or extremely 
expensive.  

In  a nutshell, if you want a Syncro, buy a Syncro.  A conversion 
would be a *major* financial and engineering feat.

Hope this helps
Harry.

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has done anything more than contemplate
&gt; upgrading an older Vanagon to 4wd by transplanting all the necessary
&gt; drivetrain components from a Syncro?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your comments.
