Subject: ? about cold weather and oil pressure

It was about 4 degres Faren. this morning on my drive in. I let my 87 
Vanagon warm up about 10 minutes before heading out. About 10 miles down 
the road my oil light/buzzer came on while slowing down. I goosed it and 
the light/buzzer went off. This happened several times. I checked the oil 
level and it looks OK. Probably have 2500 miles since the last change. 
10-40 as I recall. 

Any recommendations on oil when changing it soon or other ideas??. We will 
probably have pretty cold weather here for a while (Indiana).

Peace,
Rich Smith
87 Vanagon GL (it was warm and toasty today!)
