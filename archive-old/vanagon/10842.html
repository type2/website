Subject: Steering again!!

Hey guys,
   My steering is becoming an obsession! I replaced the drag link this 
weekend. The only thing I really learned is that the way to remove the 
pitman arm is a device called a &quot;pickle fork&quot;. It is designed for 
removing tie rod ends and stuff. It really works great!  Anybody know
how to rebuild the steering box?
