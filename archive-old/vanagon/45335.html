Subject: Re: battery tray comparisons..opinions?

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i'm in the market for a battery tray. bus boys has them for $45 from denmark.
&gt;i was at the local VWFLAPS and they have a tray for a bug for $15.95, brand
&gt;new, also from dennmark. will this one fit a '74 bus? also, i reckon you have
&gt;to drill a hole in the battery plate to fasten the battery down?
&gt;

I bought a 70 amp battery and placed it in a plywood tray-the plywood was
scrap from a dumpster. Just leave a lip on one side for the stock 'clamp'
to grab onto. I think I cut dados with a circular saw, just make a mark and
eyeball them, and pin nail and glue it together. I slopped deck paint all
over mine, but you could use varnish or poly or whatever.

45 $$ is outrageous. You can get a servicable plastic battery tray at Grand
Auto for ten bucks. It's not a highly engineered piece. Who cares if it
comes from Denmark? A plastic battery bucket could come from Somalia for
all I care.
