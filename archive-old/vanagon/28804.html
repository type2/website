Subject: How I got home from work (broken clutch cable)

I pull off the freeway after another 12 hour work day-first year high
school teacher. I push in the clutch and SNAP! The pedal goes to the floor.


No problem I say. I've got the book (Bentley), I've got the tools (BIG bag
of tools I lug around. Black bag. Looks like burglary tools), I've read the
sermons (that means I've got an accelerator cable, 6' of fuel hose, and a
CLUTCH cable stashed in the kids bed up in the pop top). I dig out all the
junk, jack up the left side of the bus, put a jack stand under the big tube
inboard of the swing arm, pull off the tire, and reach in and unscrew the
wing-nut on the back end of the clutch cable.

The problem so far: I'm wearing slacks and a tie. OK, I ditched the tie,
but the white shirt is now all greasy. I'm on a budget, and a shirt costs
as much as the labor I'm trying to save here. I'm going to suggest that we
all throw a pair of COVERALLS behind the seat. Also, I'm on the street and
cars are whizzing past me frighteningly close. Flashers mean nothing to the
commuter maniacs rushing home to six packs and television. Since I'm trying
to save money, getting hit is out of the question. My medical insurance is
$3000 deductible, more than the cost of my bus. I put some FLARES right
next to the coveralls.

I slither under the front of the bus, on a mat I carry around...it's not
really a mat, it's my dog's bed which adds some black hair to the grease on
my white shirt. The front of the cable is a rusted mess, the holes in the
end have broken, and the bolt, pin, or whatever held it to the pedal are
back on Interstate 280. No problem, my bag has a roll of WIRE. The rest was
easy. I stuffed a new cable through the housing, with some grease, wired
the front to the pedal, adjusted the wing nut and drove home. Next day I
bought a new clutch cable, and two of the pins than hold it to the pedal.
Tossed the extra one in my back of tools.

I'm not really in a position to make a sermon, but having a few tools and a
spare cable made my day a lot easier. The coveralls will make the next time
cleaner. The flares will help keep my insurance company in the red. I hope
somebody learns something from my experience.
