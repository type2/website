Subject: My Syncro For Sale
Date: Mon, 26 Dec 94 17:00:31 PST

Hi,

I've decided that I'd rather not pour money into my Syncro, so
I'm selling it.  I've been offered $6000 as a trade-in from a 
dealer, but I wanted to check in see if anyone on the list would
be interested in it for around $6000.

First, what's wrong:

leaking coolant from head, very slow leak, was undetected until I
pulled the gravel guard.

Noise from transmission.  Noise was reported 60,000 miles ago, so not
sure how soon repair is warranted.  Noise goes away during cold weather
(like right now).

That's all for the bad news.

Other info:

'87 Vanagon GL Syncro
119K miles
Weekender pkg (has fold-out bed)
Air conditioning
Tinted windows
Awesome Kenwood 8-speaker stereo system
Alarm System
New tires
Interior in great shape (ask attendees at the Net Pizza Party)
Has vinyl cover which protects the bed when hauling stuff
Four wheel covers
All repair records
Service manual
Manuals for the stereo and alarm

Also, has the following spare parts, which will probably be offered for
sale on the net if no one (other than the dealer) wants my van:

two sets of belts
water pump
cv joint boot kit (rear)
oil temp sender
set of spark plugs

I paid $7000 in March for it.  If anyone is interested, email me, or call
me at home collect (510) 215-7812.  Or you can dial my work number 
(510) 922-5418.  I'll probably be selling soon so I can take advantage
of those year-end car sales.

Oh, and the van is located in El Cerrito or Emeryville, CA, which are towns
between Richmond and Oakland.  I can drive a reasonable distance if you'd 
like to take a look at it.

-Jim
