Subject: '69 Westy Electrical Question

Okay, I was putting the dash back in my '69 Westy and I have the following
odd problem.  All of the connections are good (i.el;. everything lights and
flashes but.....)

Okay, here is the situation:

'69 Westy being restored.
NO engine in it right now.  PO allegedly had an alternator instead of
generator (would not know since it is not there now..)
Based off of that, however, there is some different looking thing where the
voltage regulator should be.  Big Square heat sink like.

Here is the problem:  When I put the parking lights one the front left turn
signal is as bright as the sun but the right one is fairly dim (esp. in
comparison to the other).

BUT...  when I put the flashers or turn signal on the RIGHT one is as
bright as the sun and the LEFT is somewhat dim. (i.e. the exact opposite of
before).

Also, rear seems pretty even.

Can anyone help?

Thanks and thanks for all the help on the window install - it was the lack
of copious amounts of armor-all which was making it difficult.
