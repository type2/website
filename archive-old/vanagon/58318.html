Subject: Where to find trusting service in Chicagoland

Hi everyone...

My 1984 Wolfsburg Edition Vanagon and I recently relocated to the
western suburbs (Wheaton/Downers Grove area) of Chicago. Oh yeah, my
wife and sons came along too &lt;sheepish grin&gt;.

It's my third VW, having killed many brain cells in a 1965 during high
school and installed a Buick V8 in a 1973 during college. Like some
folks, I was away from vans long enough to start a family, but I fell in
lust again when I stumbled upon this gem three years ago...it had less
than 20,000 miles on it! No kidding!

Anyway, it's time for it's 75,000 mile service and I'm looking for a
great shop to take it to...anyone have any suggestions where to go or
where to avoid??

Thanks for your help!

Dennis
