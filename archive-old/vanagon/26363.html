Subject: REPOST: 89 Syncro Weekender FS

     PLEASE don't use auto reply and send me any e-mail about this repost,
     email the originator- moh_at_aol_dot_com:

     Anyone interested in a pristine vanagon syncro. It has the weekender
     package (a bed in the back and a vanity cabinet along the side). It is
     silver and grey with PW, PS, PL, Cruise Control, and a lot of camping
     extras. Although it has 86k miles it has had a lot of preventative
     maintenance done recently (brakes, exhaust, battery, etc). It is
     really in great shape. Anyone in New England or near Boston looking
     for a Westieshould take a look at this. Asking $10,500.
