I have a new Olympian Catalytic Heater for Sale.  Its operates from 3200
BTU's too 5800 BTU's.  Its a great heater that I used only for a month.  I'm
selling my bus and I don't want to part with the heater as part of the bus
deal.

This heater is simple to install and easy to operate.  I could run anyone
through the installation process in two short paragraphs.

I paid 230.00 for the heater and the optional support legs.  I'd sell the
whole thing with the box and the original instructions and original receipt
for 175.00.

Thanks and good luck,

Mark
