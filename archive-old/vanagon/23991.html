&gt; PS: About the sticker: I got mine from the Erotic Bakery in Seattle.  
&gt; They have an assortment of colours, too.  I also have the &quot;Darwin&quot; 
&gt; take-off of the born-again Christain fish (not phish!) thing you see 
&gt; everywhere.  The &quot;Darwin&quot; fish has little feet on it, and says &quot;DARWIN&quot; 
&gt; across the body.  I like that one, too!  :)

Ah, yes, the DARWIN fish. That's one of my favorites. A must have for the 
camper. (Of course my wife and I are both evolutionary biologists.) Just watch 
out though. I have a friend who had his new car keyed on account of that little 
political statement; seems there are still a lot of people who are hostile 
towards the Theory of Evolution. At least Galileo is safe. Apparently the 
Catholic church released a statement in the late '80s that Galileo was right. 
The earth really does circle the sun after all. Whew! What a relief.

If you want a DARWIN fish of your very own (Cost: $7.00), try
