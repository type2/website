Hello,

I am new to this mailing list and the owner of an 84 Vanagon.  I infer that 
there has been a lot of discussion about this before, but I have endured the 
problem for 10 years now.  Early on, I got some real scares driving in 
sub-zero weather at 2AM in a desolate part of northern Arizona when I 
experienced the problem.  I didn't realize how easy the recovery was until I 
called every local dealer several times until one told me that VW was aware 
of the problem, and the recovery was simply to shut the engine down and 
re-start it.  After a year or so I called around again, and this time no 
dealer admitted to the problem.  So, I just forgot about it since it happens 
so rarely and can be recovered from so easily.

So, is the cure low risk and worth the effort?

Thanks,
Mike
