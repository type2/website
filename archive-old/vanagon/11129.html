Subject: Re: 68-71 Gas Heater Curious

ron;

that is a good question. i have seen westy's that came supplied with a gas
heater have a small round hole cut in the wooden panel just ubderneath the
folding bed. I don't know if this was factory or not though.

michael (also curious)



&gt;Hello all!
&gt;
&gt;I'm curious about the location of the gas heater heat outlet on a 68-71
&gt;Campmobile.  I know those Eberspacher heaters are mounted on the driver's
&gt;side of the engine compartment and there is some metal ducting bringing
&gt;the heat into the van, but all the pictures I've seen are on passenger
&gt;vans and not Westy's.  How was that ducting orignally routed through the
&gt;storage area under the fold down bed?  Was a hole cut in the face of
&gt;the storage area in-line with the ducting or was the camper equipment
&gt;different on gas heater equipped models?
&gt;
&gt;Curiously yours,
&gt;
