&gt;3. I have read-in advertisements for same-that window tint helps to reflect
&gt;ambient heat as well as sunlight. Kinda seems to me that a dark surface,
&gt;such as window tint, would tend to _absorb_ heat, rather than radiate it.
&gt;Unless of course it was cooler outside than in, but that don't happen in
&gt;Tejas. Is this just advertising hoopla? Anybody tint thier windows and see
&gt;a noticable cooling effect? BTW, I mean temprature-wise, not that _cool_
&gt;&quot;Cal Look&quot;. Nipped that one in the bud...   ;-) ;-) ;-)

YES!! it really makes a difference. and it's easy to do. you can buy the
Gila brand at k-mart or wal-mart for about $10 a roll. you'll need about
three rolls to do a vanagon or bus.

some random comments ...
- the trick to getting a GOOD tint job is clean, clean, cleand the window,
     and squeegee, squeegee, squeegee the water out from under the tint.
     otherwise, you'll get those ugly bubbles that you see on the &quot;Budget
     Cal Look&quot; cars.
- use single-edge razor blades to cut the tint. don't use scissors ... it
     looks like it would work better, but it leaves a ragged edge.
- follow the directions. seriously.
- no, it doesn't mess up the rear window defroster when you put it on.
     but it WILL mess up the defroster if you are not SUPER careful if you
     ever want to take it off!!!
- get the tint with as much heat-rejection as possible. it's not that dark.
- tint on the rear window helps reduce the glare from those idiots with
     mis-adjusted lights (like the jacked-up pickup trucks).
- an additional strip of tint across the top of the front windshield is
     very helpful  when driving into the sun. you need only about enough to
     extend downward about 8-9 inches. you'll have to do it in two pieces
     (cause the windshield is curved, side to side).

but the bus is much easier than most cars, because all the side and rear
windows are flat, flat, flat. :)

and something that helps also is painting the top white (like the older
buses were done). i never understood why vw quit doing that.
