&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am considering buying a deep cycle battery for my vanagon ... But I would
&gt; like to know, is there a different type of charger which is required in
&gt; order to charge a deep cycle battery?

Normal lead acid deep cycle batteries can be charged much like  normal 
automotive starting batteries. They don't like excessively fast charges, 
however. Normal alternator charging or charging with a 10 to 30 amp 
charger is OK. Avoid service station &quot;quick charges&quot;.

Gel cell batteries are a different story. They demand much more careful, 
precise charging. Too much voltage and they will burst. A friend who is a 
battery engineer for Trojan says avoid these batteries...they don't last 
very long.
