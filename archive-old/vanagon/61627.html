Hello Bill,

Tuge is also a certified Service-Dog and an agreement with the DMV
requires his presence when I drive.  So around town the answer is pretty
much yes.  In the wilderness, I find thieves far more interested in the
newer SUV's than an old van w/dog dishes in a rack and nose prints on
the windows :).  Besides, I have to have a really good excuse before
he'll let me out of the front gate with van keys in hand :).

&gt; Really?  You ALWAYS leave your dog in your van?

&gt; &gt;Being from Colorado, I use a large caliber German Shepard who was raised
&gt; &gt;with this vanagon.  NOBODY gets in &quot;his&quot; van without me (includes
&gt; &gt;mechanics!).  No problems for 6 years now :)
