Subject: 911! call..more info

Heres more info to help you diagnose my astronomically poor fuel mileage
problem:

 - it got a new O2 sensor about a month ago.
- new tires
- oil change
- tried some fuel injector cleaning stuff
-changed the brake pads
-installed a Tachometer that works fine
(all but the O2 sensor were done after the mileage got so bad.)

- the van doesn't hesitate or do the 'herky jerky'
- no noticeable power loss
- starts fine and idles fine
- have stayed with the same fuel (87 Octane) since Ive had it.

        I just dont get it. All I really know is that it was fine driving
the 200kms to the campsite west near Hinton, and that on the way home it
was suddenly  consuming gas like mad.

muddled and befuddled
