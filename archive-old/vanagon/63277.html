Subject:      Engine Degreasing

A friend of mine offered to help me tune my '85 westy.  Before bringing it
to his place he asked that I degrease the engine with the spray on
degreaser.  I looked at a few of these at Walmart and they all said that
they will not damage *most* hoses.  The use of the word &quot;most&quot;  concerned
me here.  Is it okay to use these products on the water cooled vanagon?
Is one better/safer than another?  What exp. have ya'll had?

Thanks!
Ivan
