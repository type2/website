A few years ago I met a fellow who applied a waterproofing agent
to his canvas pop-top with the best of intentions.  He didn't 
realize that it shrank the canvas until he opened the pop-top a
few days later and it ripped all the way around. :(

My own pop-top tent disintegrated about five years ago from lack
of a good rubber seal around the fiberglass.  A sailmaker friend
helped remove the old canvas (to use as a pattern) and replace
it with a brand new tent made from awning canvas and bug netting.

I also replaced the rubber seal.  Works and looks great.
