Subject: Re: Engine misfires?

&gt;I have a problem with the engine on my 85 Vanagon GL &quot;stumbling&quot; or
&gt;misfiring on an intermittent basis.  It usually misfires or bucks once or
&gt;twice and then runs fine for a while (10-20 minutes).  Other than this
&gt;problem the engine runs great.  (This van has 194000 miles, with about 15000
&gt;miles on a replacement, VW-remanufactured engine).
&gt;
&gt;I have tried to determine if it occurs under particular conditions (cold
&gt;engine, warm engine, cruising, accelerating, etc) but can't be sure.

&gt;Our 85 Westy did the same thing. Never figured it out. I hope someome does.
