Subject: Mystery Benz

	My friend Steve is contemplating buying a Vanagon-
looking at regular, Westie and Country Homes, some synchros.
He enjoys camping, but really enjoys skiing/snowboarding.
He's also spotted a Mercedes Benz Westfalia, a 207 D,
for $8500 or so. Original owner. Anyone recognize this
model designation? It is less powerful than a 240 D sedan? 
He owned one of those.

	Cheers!
	Bill
