Remember... you shouldn't have the pilot lit while driving!
To get the pilot really lit I'd suggest putting a bunch of ice in the 
icebox, and a case of beer.  The case of beer should get the pilot of the 
bus lit pretty good.

Actually, you probably don't have propane power.  If it has an ice tray 
and a drain is really just an icebox.  Or... it might be a 2-way power 
fridge (12V/110V).
