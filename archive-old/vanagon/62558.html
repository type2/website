To insulate the roof in a Westfalia, raise the roof, unfold the upper
bed, spread about four wool blankets and lower the roof. The only part
left uninsulated is the gap in front of the skylight. I suppose this
could also be insulated but I haven't found it necessary in our typical
-20C to -40C winter chills.
