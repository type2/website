Syncronauts,

I'm planning on doing a Syncro off-road trip as an adjunct to the next
California Camping trip scheduled for Red Rock Canyon the weekend of =
April
27th.   Red Rock Canyon State Park is located about 25 miles north of =
Mojave
California and is a desert campground.  The southernmost stretches of =
the
Sierra Nevada mountains are just a short trip away. =20

I don't know exactly what the California Camping Crazies are planning, =
but
I'll be bringing the kids (8 &amp; 5 yrs old) and planning a family style =
weekend
of fun and Syncro outing or two. =20

I have a couple of friends that may go and bring their Jeeps.  I know =
the
Jeeps don't fit in too well with typical VW buses, but they'll mesh =
nicely
with the Syncros on the trail.

Let me know if you're interested. =20

I know that some of you are on the Vanagon mailing list and will be =
getting 2
copies of theis message.  My appologies.
