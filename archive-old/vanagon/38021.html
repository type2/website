Subject: Weber Progressive 2bl VW carb.

	I have a weber progressive 2 barrel carburater forsale for
$130/obo.  It has one barrel that comes on for moderate driving and a
bigger one that one comes one when you push the accelerator in past 80% or
so, for that extra boost of power.  It comes with an intake manifold and
mounting hardware for a volkswagen air cooled engine.  It was intended for
use with a dual port bug or bus engine; but can be used on a single port
engine, as it comes with the extra attachments that attach to the heads.
	It has the standard size main jets.  But you can buy differerent
size jets from Bow Wow.
	It is in like-new condition, still in the box.  I was going to put
it on my bus when the carb. went out, but the old carb. seems to still be
working and I haven't gotten around to it.
	Bow Wow sells them new for $375.  I am asking $130, which
seems fair; but I will consider all reasonable offers.

John
