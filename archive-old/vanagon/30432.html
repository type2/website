&gt;Yup, the Bentley BMW repair manual makes the Bentley Vanagon seem
&gt;like a Chilton.

My guess is that Bentley just publishes what VW originally
used as their Workshop Manual.  I have the 1968 VW Workshop
Manual for split window buses (two volumes) and inside
it looks just like (same crazy format) the Bentley I have
for my '84 Vanagon.

&gt;&gt; 2)  Yes, if your rear heater core leaks, turn it off until
&gt;&gt; you can replace it.  If shutting it off solves the leaking

&gt;Crude, turning off the core did stop the leak.  Any ideas on
&gt;where to find a replacement and cost?

Not aware of any source but VW and boneyard.  Not enough
demand for after-market, I guess.

&gt;&gt; 6)  You should not need to block off your radiator on a trip
&gt;&gt; to Milwaukee unless it gets way below zero (F).

&gt;Even better!  But I thought I would ask.

I just drove to the bank, to get gas and to the office.
Weather RIGHT NOW is 3 degrees F, winds at 22mph.  By the
time I got to the bank (3 miles) warm air was coming from
the dash.  By the time I got gas (another 3 miles) I hated
to shut the Vanagon off and go outside for the fill-up.  By
the time I got to my office (another 5 miles) I could remove
my gloves without fear.  Another few miles and I would have
probably been backing off the lever from maximum.

&gt;Since I only subscribed last night, what is The Old Bus
&gt;Rescue Squad?  I will be traveling the length of Illinois on
&gt;December 26.  St Louis to Milwaukee via Bloomington and
&gt;Chicago.

Actually, the Old Bus Rescue Squad just *started* last
night, so your timing was impeccable!  See the Wannabus to
Gottabus thread.

&gt;Many thanks for taking time out to reply!

&gt;From your description, you will end up going north on
Interstate 55 from Bloomington and then around Chicago on
294.  Make sure you time your arrival to avoid rush-hour on
294!  Alternative route (unless you WANT to see the windy
city) is to take Interstate 39 north from Bloomington to
Beloit, Wisconsin and then Int. 43 to Milwaukee.  The Int.
39 route also (By The Way) also puts you within about 10
miles from my *bus and breakfast* here in DeKalb.
