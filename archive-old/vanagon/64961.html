Subject:      AMC spain??

I got this encouraging mail from Tom:


&gt; I hear of good success repairing heads, but AMC of Spain also makes
&gt; replacement heads that are good, and a lot cheaper than VW original.

So who is AMC of Spain? How to get in touch?
What does AMC mean, American motor company? Searched the net for a while
but no hits in Spain

Have fun!
