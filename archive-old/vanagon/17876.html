&gt;&gt; Is there a special type of windshield wiper for the late 70s vans? I
&gt;&gt; just bought an Anco 16&quot; Blade for the passenger side of my 77 camper.
&gt;&gt; It leaves a big section, just right of center, untouched.

Me too! I also have a smaller one on the drivers side.  I have thought about 
buying Bosch wipers arms to replace the junk that I have now.
