Subject: solex 28 pic &amp; 28 pict



Again while cleaning up the garage, I came upon the boxes of bug stuff that
I've been humping around for years (I once owned a '69 1200 beetle, don't
laugh it was faster than the diesel vanagon).
I have 2 carbs, a 28 pic or pci (can't get it straight), the one with the
manual choke, and a 28 pict the one with the electric choke.

Are these of any use to old split owners? I'll sell or trade them for
beer, wine, goodwill, whatever!


Alistair, currently enjoying a homemade california common beer, ahhh
