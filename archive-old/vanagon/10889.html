&gt;
&gt;Am I correct in my understanding that it is possible to subscribe in digest
&gt;form?  If so, how.  I want to keep up but with the volume of mail I'm
&gt;getting now it's really difficult to filter through all this stuff.
&gt;

Send this message

SET VANAGON MAIL DIGEST

with nothing else to

LISTSERV_at_LENTI.MED.UMN.EDU
