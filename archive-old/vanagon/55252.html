Subject:       Re: Vanagon Heat Vents.....

&gt; &gt;  I just discovered lately that these vent on my '88 seems to blow 
&gt; &gt;  either fresh cold air, or heated air depending on valve position, and 
&gt; &gt;  whether heat is directed to dash from the heater panel.
&gt; 
&gt; This is exactly right.  The heated air from the dash vents was one of the
&gt; enhancements in the 1988 model year vans.
&gt; 
And a dran good thing too, since I'm putting off fixing the front 
blower fan. There's just enough heat from convection to keep 
comfortable, if I leave the rear heater on low. Someone mentioned a 
while back about marking a spot &amp; drilling an access hole to the 
bearings on the front heater fan. 
Has anyone tried this? If so, what lube did you use? I'd really like 
to get the fan going, but it's not quite cold enough here to convince 
me to pull the dash... I know the fan is not seized - it will run for 
a few minutes sometimes, then gradually slow down &amp; stop. I'm hoping 
a lubrication job will give me a year or two longer.

tia.
