Subject: Re: FS &amp; Wanted: Bentley Manuals

The price for a new Bentley sounds about right. Went to several
places here in Seattle and prices were around 80 something dollars
(American of course, haha). There is a mechanic who will give me
a call if he gets used manuals in. Hasn't happened in five months.
Should he get more than one, though, I'll let you know.

&gt; I'm hoping someone near me might have a 80-91 Vanagon Bentley manual 
&gt; they no longer need (haha...)
&gt; Cheapest I've seen is $90 CDN or so - is this about right?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have a 75-79 Rabbit/Scirocco Bentley Manual in as new 
&gt; condition which I'd like to part with, so I can afford the above... 
&gt; ;-)
&gt; New is around $39 CDN, sell for $20 CDN

&gt; Thx.
