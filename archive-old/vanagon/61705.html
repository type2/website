Mike, I'm also interested in this type of project. I have heard the 15&quot;
Mercedes steel wheels are readily available in canada, where they are
remove form cars at the port and replaced with chrome or alloy wheels.
Perhaps 16&quot; would be available. I know the lug bolts have to be replaced,
but that's not too difficult.
