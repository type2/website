Sami: I don't have an answer to the cat question but if you are going to
Quebec there are several places to visit that are very worthwhile: Quebec
City (one of the oldest cities in NA); Montreal (fabulous old port circa
17th c); and Tadoussac  (&quot;twin peaks&quot; or &quot;two breasts&quot; in Montagnard) which is
about 2 hours from Quebec City and the best place for whale watching in
the St Lawrence-lac St. Jean area - just my two cents worth (having lived
in Montreal for four years)....DC
