Subject: Re: question: '76 or '77, possible purchase, what to look for

&gt; The color scheme you describe (beige outside with green/brown plaid
&gt; inside) was not a VW combination (neither were the hand-painted
&gt; swirly designs).  If there is green in the plaid, this bus was once
&gt; either chrome yellow (school bus colored) or tiaga green (green-M&amp;M
&gt; colored).  The color of the paint inside the engine compartment or
&gt; in the interior will probably clue you in.
I must disagree with this. I have seen at least 2 '78 Westfalias that had light
beige paint, and an interior plaid of fine green and brown '70's glory.
Just another useless fact, I know...
