Here's a good tale!

	After putting the new motor in yesterday, we decided to take the
bus to go get a tree.  Everything was fine and dandy, except one minor,
teeny weeny problem.  Halfway thru the journey, the brakes diminished
almost, but not quite, to nothing.  The pedal goes down to about an inch off
the floor, and I have to really push hard to get it to stop!  Pumping
them does absolutely no good.  It was too dark when i got back to check
the fluid level, but I think an entire brake job is in order!
