Subject: AAA info request..

Hello folks,
  As the countdown to crank-up approaches zero and road trips begin to get 
marked down on my calendar, I feel a need to get signed up with 
AAA....just in case I need one of those 100 mile tows.

  I have found some AAA sites on the web, but am not sure if I must 
register within my own state or not.  Can someone provide me with a 
little information on AAA membership for me and my '71 Westy?  The 
web-provided information at  http://inwinc_dot_com/1006/index.html
was not entirely clear.  Do I have to register as an RV camper?   

Anyone going to the New Orleans Jazz Fest on April 26-27th?  

Greg
