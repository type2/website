Subject: Parting out '59-'74 busses

 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was planning to work on a couple of busses that I own, but,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because of the cold weather and lack of storage, I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to part them out. '70 Westy, some major rust, but 85%
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complete '73 Westy, no pop-top, good sink, complete '73 bus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Automatic, solid body, no motor, trans in unknown cond. I 
also have random parts for '59-'67 busses and pick-ups.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If interested, please respond via E-mail, or call Brian or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Josh at (303) 377-7779 in Denver, CO USA.
