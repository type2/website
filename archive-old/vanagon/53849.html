Subject: fuel guage flux ('83.5)

Good morning!

Seems my fuel guage has been a bit indecisive of late. It can't decide if
it's half full or under a quarter full, or somewhere in between. Seems ok
from full to slightly above half. Any ideas?

Also, seems that my mpg has dropped from about 18-20 to about 10-12!! A bit
hard to tell with the problem above, but this has just been noticeable
within the last 2 weeks or so. Any ideas?

Off to the archives I go!
