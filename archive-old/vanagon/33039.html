Subject: Re: Idiot factor



This has the signs of developing into a great thread, complete with VW
content! Come on, VW freaks/hacks/nuts... what was YOUR silliest/most
embarrassing embodiment of blank stupidity, incurred while working on
a VW?

A few guidelines (&quot;Guidelines??? We don't need no steenking guidelines!!!&quot;):

1.) It should be while WORKING on a VW, or trying to diagnose a problem
or strange condition in a VW. Embarrassments/stupidities committed while
driving a VW, or buying one, should maybe go to another category?

2.) It should be an act that any person with the intelligence of a
modern toaster, would never have committed, and for which there can be
no possible excuse other than lack of a brain (i.e. leaving the rotor
out of the distributor, an action for which I proudly claim credit).

3.) Extra points are awarded in three categories:

3a. Lack of any possibile excuse for the Idiotic Act. Replacing front disc
pads because of a funny noise, only to find that the noise was coming from
your radio due to a loose antenna connection, gets fewer points. This is
because it's sometimes true that disc brakes will make a funny noise when
they need replacing.

3b. amounts of inconvenience involved in fixing the Idiotic Act.
Forgetting to install the clutch plate before re-installing the engine,
scores higher than forgetting to install the distributor rotor,
since you have to pull the engine again to fix the clutch goof.

3c. amounts of inconvenience caused for persons by the Idiotic Act. The
inconvenience need not be confined to the person committing the Act, i.e.
if you leave the nut out of the center of the oil strainer after an oil
change and make a big puddle on your garage floor, it's a small
point-getter... UNLESS you don't discover it until it's time to drive your
daughter to her wedding, no other cars are available, and you already have
your tux on. In this case it gets mucho mucho points.


Any other suggestions? Come one, come all, don't be shy! Only those of you
who have perfect records of VW maintenance, need not apply (what are you
doing on this list anyway?).

Let the good (bad?) times roll!
