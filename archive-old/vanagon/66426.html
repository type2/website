Subject:      Re: Injector Wiring Order?

I am not 100% sure on the '84 system, but on the Bosch L-Jet in my '81,
it does not matter how you wire the injectors as they all fire at the
same time.  I imagine it would be the same on your '84.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Is there any specific order that the injectors must be wired
&gt; on an '84 digijet model?  I would have thought that they
&gt; needed to be wired in an orderly fashion like spark plugs.
&gt; However, they all have the same color wires and, other than
&gt; two being on each side, I don't know which wire goes to
&gt; which injector. Could they all be firing simultaneously, and
&gt; thus can the wires go any which way?
