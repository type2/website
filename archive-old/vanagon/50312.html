Subject: Clutch cylinder rebuild kits?

Are clutch master and slave cylinder kits available
anybody know.  Got in the '81 for first time in 1-2
weeks readying her for the camping this weekend and boom
pedal falls to floor.  Inspections shows cylinder pumping
nothing, removal shows internal corrosion (not too bad)
and seals shot.  I hope to take the '85 cylinder out and
swap tomorrow morning when I get light, if I can figure
out a way to bleed it myself.  I guess its MityVac time.
