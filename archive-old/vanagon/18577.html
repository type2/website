Subject: Timing

Just trying to find out who times at what, according to factory specs,
deviations for altitude and so forth.  Also, I want to know who times
statically with a test bulb, and who does it with a strobe light.  Thanks for
responding to this small survey.  I will send results to all who respond.
 Thanks!!!
