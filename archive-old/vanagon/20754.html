&gt;Eugene, can you tell me how I can get a hold of one of those Kragen 
&gt;lights for my engine compartment?  Thanks, Jim

Kragen is a western Friendly Local Auto Parts Store, most stores will have
this kind of generic item, a white lens, base, and push switch.  Also try a
RV supply or marine store, they often have appropriate sorts of lights.
