Subject: Re: Engine transplant operation

I dropped by the shop that's moving a '78 FI motor into my
old '73 chassis and a few things came up that were somewhat
unexpected.

The throttle cable in the '73 enters the engine compartment on the
left hand side.  The '78s cable passes through a metal tube on the
tranny support and into the engine compartment on the right hand side.
Not that big of a deal, really.

The '73 has an instrument cluster on the far left side of the dashboard.
It's got a fuel gauge and 3 lights for oil pressure, hi-beams and alter-
nator.  The '78 also has the fuel gauge and those 3 lights, plus a few
that are related to the FI such as oxygen sensor.  I assume that these
lights are important so I will probably rob the instrument cluster from
the '78 so everything is hooked up properly in the FI circuit. Chances
are they are required for the CA smog check.

The right hand heater box has a small crack which will be welded up.

I hope that's all there is to it - the less dinkin around with
fabricating stuff the better.
