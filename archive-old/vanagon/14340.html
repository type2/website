&gt; &gt;What other neat camping toys does anyone know about?
&gt; 
&gt; 200W inverter to power laptop computer from storage battery.
&gt; Cellphone with modem attachment and gain antenna for 
&gt;   checking and posting to vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu from campsite.

Yes yes yes!!  But why stop at 200W?  I would like to have an 800 watt
inverter so I can bring my desktop computer, monitor, laser printer (for 
printing maps for excursions!), external disk drive, etc.  It has to be able 
to handle the power surges when I'm playing Marathon.  Also, 800W would be
good for powering a small microwave, which I would love to have in the
camper.  And yes, I know that 800W ~= 80 amps.  :)
