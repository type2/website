Subject: Re: parting out Buses, Bugs, and Ghias in Denver ('55-'81)

It wasn't real clear who actually wrote this:
:
:  &gt; I am parting out several VW projects in Denver:
:  &gt;&gt; '56 Ghia, '57 Ghia, '59 single cab, '63 single cab, '64 Ghia, '64 T34

However, I'd be very interested in the shifter assembly from the '59.
That'd be everything from the shift lever back to the rod that
connects to the nose cone on the tranny.

If someone knows for sure that the shifter assembly from a single cab
won't work in a kombi, please let me know.

Thanks much.
