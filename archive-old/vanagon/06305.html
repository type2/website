&gt; All this discussion reminds me of the song from Kinky Friedman and
&gt; the Texas Jewboys (I belive)...
&gt; 
&gt; We're red necks...
&gt; We're red necks...
&gt; We don't know our ass from a hole in the ground...
&gt; 
I always thought that was Randy Newman -- at least I think he covered 
it.  I have a Kinky Friedman novel around here somewhere I need to read...
