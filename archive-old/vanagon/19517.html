&gt;I want a knove.
&gt;I've got every tool known to modern man and a few that haven't been invented
&gt;yet but kno knoves.  (I'd like a shiny one, please.)
&gt;Indeed, if knoves are specifically required for Vanagon blower switch repairs
&gt;we should ALL have a knove in our tool kit, even if they cost three bucks or
&gt;more and were heretofore only available in the State of Main.

Kno Knoves?? knot even a knew one??? oh, how sad. :)

however, in place of a knove, one may use a dodah (off the oppogie, you know;
the one for making fluggiebogs with). or a left-handed widget.

besides, only knaves have knoves.
