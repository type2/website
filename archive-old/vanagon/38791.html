&gt;&gt; &quot;TACO BELL BUYS THE LIBERTY BELL
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I heard about this on a news blip.  Taco Bell got jammed with angry
&gt;phone calls and e-mail.  It is an April Fools Day joke.  I heard even
&gt;the parks dept. is miffed.  They did it to kick off a new add campaign.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No sense of humor = No life. Your tax dollars at work!   :^)
