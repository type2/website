Subject: Re: Distinguishing between 68-70 busses

In a message dated 95-07-12 19:02:33 EDT, you write:

&gt;To tell a '68 from a '69 I'm not so sure. I used to think that a '68 could
&gt; be recognized by the lack of a metal partition between the engine
&gt;compartment
&gt; and gas tank &lt;you can see the tank from the engine hatch&gt;, but someone told
&gt; me that some later '68s have the partition. There's always the VIN......
&gt;
&gt;

The easiest way to distinguish the '68 from the '69 is the design of the
wiper arms.  '68 wiper arms usually mounted on the wipershaft using a pinch
bolt and the base fully encloses the end of the shaft.  The '69 wiper arm
base has a hole for the shaft to go thru with a locknut (6mmx10mm hex) and
also has a plastic cap covering the base/shaft end.  Another difference in
the wiper arms is the '68s are always silver and the '69-on is usually black.

That is unless someone changes out the whole wiper assembly from a '69 to a
'68.....which I've done and don't care to discuss it unless you're into
contortion.

Oh yeah, the accelerator cable is 10mm shorter (3660mm verses 3670mm) - Dare
someone to pull it and measure it :)

And as the earlier post says, look at the VIN Number :)
