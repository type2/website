      Call the 800 number listed on &quot;vanagon_dot_com&quot;

      I got the one for my '91 for $10 (ordered with a credit card)

      The Westfalia Suppliment was free.

      That probably explains why the Syncro suppliment was free, too.

I just called these guys this morning.  Guess they didn't like the sound of
my voice as they charged me $15.71 for an '84 manual and an 86 Camper
supplement.  They had no 84 or 85 Camper supplements.  The woman I spoke with
also did not recognize or comprehend &quot;Westfalia Supplement.&quot;  Her computer
refers to &quot;Camper Supplements.&quot;

Oh well,
