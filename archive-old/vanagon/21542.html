Subject: Re: Reenforced Deluxe splitties

&gt;Richard Kurtz say-ed:
I am reasonably sure my 69 sunroof bus has the reinforcment panels, as
&gt;did my departed 67 sunroof deluxe.  I assumed all sunroof buses had them,
&gt;as well as poptop westies.
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rusty just had to mention:

&gt;From what I've seen I'd exclude the early (pre 68) Westies. Covering my
bases let's narrow it down to &quot;not on my '67 westy but a big 10-4 on the
Vanagon westy.&quot;
