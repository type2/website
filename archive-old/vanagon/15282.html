&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Generically speaking, any VW 1.8 with at least 90bhp should be spunky
&gt;&gt;enough for you to use as a daily commuter/beater car.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think Jettas (A2) are pretty cool; I drive my wife's every chance I get...

I wasn't bothered by the Jetta but rather I was amazed by its speed. I think
that particular jetta is not a very new one. It probably has a 100hp engine.
That doesn't seem a lot but it does go fast.

For commuting it shure is a nice one to ride on. My vanagon is getting too
old (105k).
