 (*) I checked the front end for &quot;tightness&quot; by lifting the bus and
 trying to rock the wheel in all directions. Is there a better way to
 do this? &gt;&gt;

The only way to test the ball joints is as follows:

Lift front wheels a few inches off ground,

Place pry bar between tire and ground

Lift wheel with pry bar

If any movement at all, lower joint is shot.

They are available after market through Beck Arnley
