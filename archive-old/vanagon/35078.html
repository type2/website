Subject: Oil sealing washers on valve shafts.

When i took apart my heads, I noticed that there were no oil sealing 
washers on the sharts of my valves.  Haynes says there should be.  It 
is a 1700cc pancake.  Who is right Haynes or my heads (-: If I do 
need some, where do I get them? I have not seen them in any 
cataloges.  Is oil leaking down the valve guides a problem with 
horizontal guides? Thanks

Aaron
