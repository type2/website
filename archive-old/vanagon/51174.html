Subject: deep cycle big battery

Don't forget folks that I found a huge 150 amp hour or something along those
lines deep cycle excide battery to fit under the drivers seat. I sent in a
post to the list about a year ago or so on this model and the considerations
cause it does stick up higher than the tray but this can be accommodated
with little downside at the end of the day. It was an exide, I think like
group 27 size, and only the cheaper of the two exides of that size actually fit.
