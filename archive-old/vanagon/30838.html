Subject: Re: '79 blue smoke 

(For some reason my personal reply came back.)

&gt;&gt;What do you mean by &quot;the blue smoke attracted a smokey....?&quot;
&gt;&gt;Does your bus have smoke coming out of it???
&gt;&gt;I'm concerned, should I be?
&gt;&gt;Paul
&gt;
&gt;On the freeway the first night out, I noticed bluish smoke (while sitting on
&gt;the side of the road, since the police lights illuminated the smoke). .
&gt;.evidently I'm told it IS oil, not an over-rich carb.  Valve problems?
&gt;Maybe. Today, however, it wasn't doing it, and I drove it over 50 miles at
&gt;around 45-60 mph.  (Legally -- had a friend take me to the DMV for a
&gt;temporary permit.)  The mechanic told me over the phone to keep an eye on
&gt;the oil level, which I shall do.  He's going to look at it again at 500
&gt;miles anyway, but it's got to pass emissions by next Tuesday. . .damn,
&gt;shouldn't he have checked it before releasing it?  I mean, the job really
&gt;isn't half done if all the fancy engine work won't pass emissions, right?
&gt;(This is the garage that gave me an estimate of $600 the day before I got
&gt;the bus back for $1,313 -- then told me &quot;Oh, that was just for the
&gt;carburetor, so-and-so probably didn't know about the other stuff. . .&quot;)
&gt;
&gt;But it's driving good, so I'm happy at the moment.  One day at a time.
