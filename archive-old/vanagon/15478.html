&gt;What is the name of that stuff you &quot;slosh&quot; a gas tank with?

Dunno, Thom, but POR-15 is selling a gas tank restoration kit. From _their_
description, it sounds like a good product. I don't have the catalog here,
but if you're interested I'll check price and description tonight.

BTW, I ordered a quart of their main product (also called POR-15) and it
almost seems too good to be true: it's *better* to paint it over (surface)
rust than over smooth, shiny metal. In other words, I don't have to bother
too much with sanding down the rust spots.

Whaddya think?
