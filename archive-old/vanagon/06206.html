&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, which is more severe, 10 miles in stop and go traffic, or 50 miles at
&gt; &gt; 65mph, through mountainous, sometimes freezing conditions?

&gt; 
&gt; 	IMHO, 10 miles stop and go. The engine doesn't make much heat in
&gt; stop and go, so the oil probably doesn't warm up until the end of the trip,
&gt; if at all. Plus wear on the clutch and brakes. Cold outside, even freezing,
&gt; isn't bad for a running car. If you can make a steady 65, it ain't that
&gt; mountainous!

Has any one mentioned the impact that short driving has on the muffler
system; esssentially condensation is not burned off on short journeys and
the muffler begins to rust from the inside out. Ever noticed how bad the
mufflers are on cars that are hardly used? DC
