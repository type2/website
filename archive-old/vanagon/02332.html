Subject:      window rubber



Well I'm about to go ahead and do it. After two years putting it off I am
going to order window seals all around for my 71 bus. Any suggestions were
from? You got your BFY, your West Cost Metric, your Bus Boys, your Keith's
Foreign Auto Parts, and of course your JC (what' s an 800#?) Whitney. Is there
any difference in quality or does one rubber fit as well as another. Recently
someone complained on how impossible it was to get the window scraper on the
drivers side on, I think he said he ordered from BFY. Keith's Foreign Auto
Parts seemed to have the best price (their catalog is the same as WCM, go
figure?) but when I called for an updated price list, (205) 251-8965, the
recording said the # was no longer in service.
  Well, any suggestions or words of wisdom would be most graciously received
from one who has never even seen it done. Thanks.
