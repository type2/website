Subject: Re: gas heater fuel pump needed

Dworkin,

Your original problem (fan not shutting off) was very likely an out of
adjustment or broken flame detector switch.   The fan should continue to run
after the heater is switched off for 150-210 seconds (this is normal).  This
helps cool off the heater innards so you don't melt your combustion air fan
and exspel all the unburnt remaining fuel vapor so you can start up clean
next time.  If your run-on time is too long, this is the adjustment
procedure from the BN4 service manual:

&quot;1-- Turn heater on. Pull temperature regulator switch all the way out.  Let
heater run for five minutes.

2-- Turn time switch knob into out-position warning light goes out.  Start
stop watch.

3-- The combustion air blower fan, contraolled by the flame detector switch,
must continue running 150-210 seconds.  This run-on time is based on a
nominal voltage of 12 volts and an outside temperature of about 20 deg C (68
deg F).  At lower temperatures the run-on time is shorter.

If proper shut off time is not attained, the flame detector switch must be
adjusted (if run-on is too long, turn adjusting screw clockwise; if run-on
is too short, turn screw counterclockwise).  If the run-on does not shut
off, the quartz rod could be broken.  The quartz raod must be replaced.&quot;

If this doesn't get it adjusted remove the switch and see if the rod is
broken.  If so, you'll need a new one.

There were two types of Eberspacher BN4 heaters, the 1971 and earlier model
and the 72-up.  The earlier model uses a diaphram pump while the later style
uses an in-line metering pump. Make sure you really need a new fuel pump
before buying a new one.  Run the pump straight off the battery and see if
it vibrates/pumps.  If it does, make sure voltage is getting to the pump at
the right time.  If you have the earlier style heater, it could be that your
temperature regulating switch is dirty or the cable has come loose leaving
the switch in the off position.  This will break the 12v to the pump.

In any event, good luck.  I don't have a spare pump, but I'd be happy to
help you troubleshoot it if you have any more problems.  Maybe Tom Johnson
has a spare pump?  Tom, you out there??

&gt;Well, I've had two different shops tell me I need a fuel pump for my
&gt;gas heater (Eberspacher BN4).  I suspect the first shop managed to
&gt;break the pump, since the problem I asked them to look at originally
&gt;was that it heated fine, but the fan would sometimes never cut out.
&gt;In any case, does anyone have any ideas on where to find a fuel pump
&gt;for this guy?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
