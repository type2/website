Subject: Hesitation at low RPM

My '87 Syncro still has the following problem:  after warming up,
at low rpms, there is very little power, and under load, seems to
switch between normal (a bit of power) and low-power mode, causing
a slight bit of jerking.

By low rpms, I'm talking under 2500.  Somewhere between 2000 and 2500
rpms, suddenly every thing will start working correctly, and I'll get
a big burst of power (noticeable only in first gear).

Turning off the engine, and turning right back on gives me between
30 and 60 seconds of really good acceleration from a start.  After that,
my starts from lights are _really_ slow, unless I keep the revs above
3000 (bye-bye clutch!).

For the FI experts out there:  Is this an indication that my computer
is/has gone bad?  Or is there some sensor that the computer ignores
in the first 30-60 seconds that is bad?

This behavior is fairly consistent, whether the engine is cold or
warm.  I seem to have a longer reprieve from the low-power demon on
cool, cloudy mornings.  

I've checked the obvious things, I have new plugs, rotor, and cap,
iginition stablizer thingy hums, air and coolant temp sensors seem
to read OK (but I don't have a coolant thermometer to be sure).

One thing that struck me odd, is that the air and coolant temp sensors
have readings that are not equal in the morning when I assume that both
should have cooled to the ambient air temperature.

Any ideas?
