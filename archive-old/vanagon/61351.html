Subject: A/C Condensation Hose Outlet

Hey All,

I ran the A/C yesterday on my 86 GL and noticed the condensation was
flowing from my left rocker panel.  I don't remember where it normally
exits the vehicle.  I looked underneath and couldn't find the end of the
hose, could someone tell me specifically where the end of the hose
is/should be on the left side.

TIA
