Subject: Major oopsies (was: Isadora Duncan)


&gt;once you find out about someone who strangled themselves with a sports car,
&gt;it's a little hard to forget. :)  regardless of their previous 
accomplishments
&gt;and so forth, that's the sort of thing that sticks in your mind. like the
&gt;fellow, Wrong-way Corrigan (i think that was his last name). :) or old
&gt;Won Wing Lo, the chinese pilot who invented landing in cross-winds. ;)

Then there's the guy with the Cessna 172 (four-seat, single-engine,
150-hp, private airplane), who found his battery was dead one fine
morning when he went out to fly it. Not wanting the other pilots to
see the results of his lack of maintenance, he closed the hangar door
before walking in front of the plane and giving the propellor a BIG
heave. The engine started, plane surged forward, and pinned him against
the hangar door where the prop started chopping him into little bits.

He survived, BTW. But gave up flying.
