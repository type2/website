Hi,

I posted the original set of questions and received a number of great
responses directly. I didn't forward them on to the list because I thought
I was the ONLY one who didn't understand the issue and the list seemed
tired of head stuff!

As far as I'm concerned the matter is closed (for now :) )

Someone was going to keep a history of the people who had problems
and the results of their dealings with VW in getting a settlement.
Was this you Derek? How is this coming?

Thanks to everyone that responded.
