Subject: Re: RE: drum brake adjustment

in regards to the poundy thing (there must be a name for it (I call it a
poundimiform, actually), i also have a pair of sockets in the appropriate
sizes, 3/4 &quot; drive, a slider breaker bar the same, also a converter to 1/2&quot;
so  i can use it with the 1/2&quot; ratchet or breaker bar, as the urge strikes,
but the poundymiform is cheaper to buy than that pile of stuff.
