&lt;&lt; My neck of the woods in here in the KC area had 8&quot; of wet snow last night
 and a major blackout that may not be fixed for several days. ....Sooo, Zorm
to the rescue!  Started right up and made it to work. &gt;&gt;

Great to have a back-up vehicle!!

When I woke up this morning I noticed someone had left a Blue '87 Westy where
my Blue '87 GL used to sit...well at least it looked like it.  The snow on
the roof of my GL looked exactly like a Westy camper pop-top.  I gave some
thought to spelling out &quot;Westphalia&quot; with sticks on my new &quot;roof&quot; and taking
a picture but didn't have any film. 8-(
