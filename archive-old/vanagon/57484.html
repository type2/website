Subject: Re: Desparetly need right coolant flange.

Funny you should ask that.

I had a fanbelt break and chop off the same plastic coolant flange. I
live 300 miles from the nearest VW mechanic and 1500 miles from the
nearest competent one.

So, I went to the modern day equivalent of a blacksmith a few doors down
the street. He drilled out the flange and inserted an empty AIR VALVE
used to pressurize ag equipment. The front of this beast looks like a
steel tire valve; the rear has an O-ring, a nut, and a threaded flange.
Its outside diameter is just right for the VW hose. The fix took five
minutes and cost (banking unspecified future favors) was zero.

Another alternative is a drillout, followed by epoxying a suitable pipe
in place.

The real VW part cost $20 and took three weeks to show up. Turns out
they are now metal rather than plastic, and far more durable. Never
bothered to install it.

Still desparately looking for a clean late Synchro. Preferably west but
not westy with diff lock.
