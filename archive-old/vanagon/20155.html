&gt; Do they have upright motors, and in that respect similar to the 71's.
&gt; or did i just get my leg pulled a few inches....

Ummm, all VW busses are type II's.  :)
I believe there are bubble window busses made in Mexico, yes.  I
know for sure they are in Brazil.  They have upright engines with
dual carbs, and small windows on the sides like the oldest busses.

By the way, the Brazilian bus pics are back online, as well as the
pics of my bus, Derek Drew's synchro, and Thom's 56 Kombi (freshly
painted!).  I'm working on getting the rest back but it looks like
I'm going to have to buy additional disk space to make it happen.
Suggestions welcomed...

&gt; If this is so,
&gt; are these buses legal on the streets in the us?

No.  At least in California, you can't import a car that wasn't
manufactured for sale here in that year, or some such rot.
