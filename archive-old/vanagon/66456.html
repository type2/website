Mark -

It depends on exactly which year/model odometer you have.
Different for different years.  Bottom line is that friction holds
the shaft in place.  Silly design to expect a rotating shaft to
not move axially without restraint.  I tried to fab a stop that
touched the end of the shaft to keep it from moving.  Either
my fab work or whatever prevented that from working.

I eventually ended up finding two broken instrument cluster
housings for $50, and mixing and matching with my own
resulted in two functioning clusters.  I used the gear from the
sliding shaft odo and put it on a odo that had a broken gear.
If you have an unbroken gear, you are lucky.  They break
easily when resetting trip odo while moving.

I overpaid for the broken clusters BTW.

My odometer stopped turning last week, and it appeared that the mileage
counter wheels were falling away from the face of the instrument panel

the right side (low digits). Sure enough when I removed the speedometer,
the axle the wheels turn on had fallen out of the plastic &quot;bearing&quot; on

e
right side. I was able to push the axle back through from the other
side,=

but couldn't figure out how to make it stay. I put it back in the dash,

nd
sure enough it worked for about a mile before it fell out again.
I've searched the archives and haven't found an answer to this
particular=

problem, any ideas on what holds it in place?
