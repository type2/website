Subject: Mudflap measurement needed


Hello Everybody,
I am interested in purchasing a set of rear mud flaps from The Bus Stop 
(RMMW) called Euro Style with the VW logo on it pg 63 Part #938-790.  This 
type of flap is typically used on older buses.  The PO of my Westy put 
aftermarket tires and wheels and tires which are wider than normal, and I am 
worried that the mud flaps may be to narrow to be effective.  If any one has 
these mudflaps, could you please get a measurement on the width so can 
determine if I can use them?  Please respond directly.

Thanks in advance.
Peter
