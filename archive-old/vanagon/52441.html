&gt; SMAW = Shielded Metal Arc Weld, aka stick welding.  A solid metal rod

               ========================================                       
&gt; running though).  Weld rods are relatively short, not on a coil.

Never thought of this. Get the jumper cables out. Hook up one to the
object, one to the welding rod. Pang, boom, Done!!! Free and portable 
arc welder. (Bonus: only need one cable when welding on same vehicle!)

Has anybody tried? I was under the impression that the voltage
to start the arc is a lot higher than 12v in a typical welding
transformer. When started voltage drops. Any tricks to vary
the current? (Yeah, I know: el cheapo jumpers = low current,
premium...)

btw Why the difference between FCAW and SMAW? I thought I've seen
sticks in both varieties (flux on the outside or in inside channels),
and that there isn't much difference in use.
