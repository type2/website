&gt; Many thanks to those who responded to my &quot;Temperature Related Performance
&gt; Problems&quot; posting last week, and shared the information in Technical
&gt; Bulletin 24-92-01 which describes a decade long problem [fuel starvation
&gt; symptoms after extended constant speed driving] and the cure [either wiring
&gt; harness part number 025 906 302---$100 or a self installed capacitor] 

There's also the rumored 3rd fix for this problem (aka The Don Lancaster
Solution), which is resoldering some steel-leaded (!) resistor or another in
the ECU.  Hey Gerry - is that Electronics Now article describing the fix (Feb
'95?) ever going to make it into the archive?  I *have* heard from Vanagon
owners who had the ghost harness installed and it didn't make a lick of
difference; at least it didn't fix the &quot;cut-out&quot; symptom which seems to be
associated with the lurching and bucking.  Anybody else had the harness
installed to no avail?
