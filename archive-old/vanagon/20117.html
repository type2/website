Subject: High Altitude Performance

Later this summer, my 1980 Westy will be changing its homebase from the
Prairie (alt. 700 ft.) to the High Plains of Wyoming (alt. 7000 ft.).  Are
there any simple changes I can make in tuning it up that will make this
fuel-injected, air-cooled van happier at high altitude?  People I've talked
to so far seem to think that the fuel injection system automatically
compensates for the lower density air and I simply have to live with a loss
of performance at higher altitudes.  One person, who knows nothing about
VWs, has suggested that I replace the air filter with one manufactured by K
&amp; N, if they make one for this engine, to decrease air-flow resistance. 
Any Colorado van owners out there with real life suggestions on keeping a
van happy on thin air?
