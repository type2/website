Subject: Re: '87 Fuel Injection &amp; General

&gt;some questions about the way the van drives.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Why do the RPMs stay at 2,000 between shifts?

you shift quickly.
&gt;
&gt;2.  The tempature gauge stays low, barely out of the &quot;white area&quot; on the low
&gt;side.  In stop and go traffic it goes up to just beyond the red light and I
&gt;hear the fan come on.  Otherwise it stays low.  If I were to replace the
&gt;thermostat what temperature should I ask for?  Is the fan coming on at the
&gt;right temperature?  Where should the temperature needle be under normal
&gt;conditions?

that is normal workings, maybe a bit low, on steady highway needle should
sit over LED.
&gt;
&gt;3.  I understand the FI uses sensors to adjust fuel delivery.  What do they
&gt;sense, temperature? air density? Could someone lay out the sensors and tell
&gt;me what each one does?

See the Bentley
&gt;
&gt;4.  What would create a slight flat spot (hesitation) during accelleration
&gt;after a shift?

the weight of the vehicle?  Max torque is at 2800 RPM, shift at 4000, will
drop to 3000 and it will run best.


&gt;5. Is there a good fuel injection reference manual you'd recommend?

Bentley diagnostics are fine, after that there is a Bosch FI book.
