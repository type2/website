Subject: EuroVan Pison Slap diagnosis

OK, all you EVers.  Need your help.  My EV is currently in the
shop (VW) for engine noise diagnosis.  Even though I am confident
the noise is &quot;piston slap&quot; that's been reported by many on the list,
they're saying it doesn't sound like it, and they think it's more
like carbon buildup.  My money, or should I say engine, is on the
piston slap theory as it sounds exactly as has been described on the list.

Anyway, they're going through &quot;required&quot; tests before VW authorizes them to
disassemble any of the engine.  So far they've done oil pressure and
compression tests.  Now they say they need to run the engine with
a special oil additive that breaks up carbon.  

Do any of those diagnosis steps sound familiar to folks that have
gone through this with their EV?  Meanwhile, nobody seems to be listening
when I ask them to follow up with VW about the piston slap problem.  Another
thing, the EV's been in the shop one week and they haven't even finished
with their preliminary (pre-teardown) diagnosis.   Sounds like other listers
have had their EVs back in less time, even with new pistons, and in some
cases,  new engines.

Another question: is there anyone at VWoA, other than the people that answer 
phones, that you can get to when you need to lean on the dealer?  How do you
get to the regional service rep?

Thanks for any help!
