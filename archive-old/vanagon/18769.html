Subject: Squeaky brakes on '73 bus

Here's a weird one!  Hopefully someone can help me out with it.  The front
brakes on my bus work just fine for the first five minutes or so of driving.
 After that they squeal like crazy every time I stop.  I took off both wheels
and checked them out and the pads are fine (almost new).  Any idea what could
be causing this horendous noise?  Both wheels squeak.  I'm tempted to just
replace the pads this weekend even though they look fine and hope that the
problem goes away.
