&gt; Subject:       Vanagon Stereo Upgrade Question

&gt; I want to replace my cassette/radio  with a dash mounted CD player.
&gt; 
&gt; Following Ajax' hints from a few weeks ago, I ordered a Crutchfield catalog
&gt; as basic reference material. After drooling for a while, I called the 800 number to find 
&gt; out what size reciever would fit in the Syncro Westie. The sales rep said I could 
&gt; not exceed 6 1/4 inches in depth. That pretty much excluded 95% of the head units
&gt; they had listed, including ALL the dash mounted CD players.
&gt; 
&gt; Who has been down this road before?  Is the 6 1/4&quot; restriction for real?
&gt; 
Tom,

You have a 90 Syncro so I am guessing here but. . . .
This restriction is listed because of a mounting rack behind the 
stereo hole.  I removed mine in 2 minutes with a air grinder.  It 
might also be possible to bend it back and forth to make it break but 
I wouldn't recommend that approach.  If you 
don't have one, I'd bet that almost any mechanic shop would do it for 
you in no time.
