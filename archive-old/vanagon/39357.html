To All and Mr.  Ludwig,

We saw Babe and Indian in The Cupboard last summer...it was the best
night of the year,  except for the night in August my daughter was
born { one week after the drive in }.  People were amazed at the
wonders inside the westy,  namely the jiffy pop on the stove and the
fridge full of goodies.  It would be great if we could get some type
1s there too.  Imagine the whole back row all pop-topped,  heart be
still!
