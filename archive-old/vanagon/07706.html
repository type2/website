Subject: Should I buy a '70 single cab with a blown engine for $1200?


	Folks,
	I've found a single-cab with a blown engine, 1970 model,
new side gates in addition to the rusty ones on it, for $1200, old
engine pieces included.
	Its clean, repainted the same cream-white it came from the
factory in, redone interior, no water leaks in the cab, moderate
surface rust in the likely places. I can't see any major body damage,
although there's a tap-spot over some previous bondo in the right
rear corner.
	Before a friend of his blew-up the engine, the owner had
put in a new tie-rod and new tires on the front. 
	It has all the inspection covers and bleeder-caps on all
four brakes, dash is intact, windows work. Brakes still firm, although
the vehicle hasn't been driven since August last year.

	I'm looking for a hauler, and I suspect this may be it.
	Reactions? 
	The engine has no pistons or cylenders, owners friend was
crusing at 85 when he burned a piston.
	It comes with a '71 front axle the owner was going to install
to have disk brakes.

	I'm MIGHTILY tempted by this single-cab.

	Bill
