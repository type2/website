BTW Vanagoneers, didja know that St. Muir writes one for soobs, assuming of
course that they like us are &quot;compleat idiots&quot;

FS:  1984 Subaru 4WD GL Wagon.  210Kmiles.  Silver, 25mpg. No rust,bondo,or
major dings.  3500 CASH.

I sold it in one day.  

But that was 1993.

My soob, eeyore, went places other 4wds only dream about, munched it's way 
through many &quot;Y&quot; pipes and a $900 certified Japanese 30k motor and two 
clutches in 204Kmiles.  Most reliable beast and truly inexpensive per mile.

FAARRR ahead of syncro ownership.  Hell I've put more into the repairs on ruby
than I put total into 210K on eeyore including the purchase price.

Eeyore currently resides in Weaverville and is slightly over the 300K mark
(third motor at 295K).

Awesome, lets see a gasovw beat that.  My ancient bunkerburner 83 jetta went
194k before sold tho.
