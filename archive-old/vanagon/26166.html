&gt;Splitfire plugs???
&gt;Worthless as tits on a bull.

and HE should know!! :)

but, seriously, folks ... you can try the triple-prong Bosch plugs or the
triple-prong NGK plugs at about half the price of the Splitfires. i've been
running the Bosch triple-prong plugs in my 88 bus for 27,000 miles now and
while i can't prove they are the cause, my fuel economy is creeping upward.
go figure. it also seems to have better lower rpm power.

but i have NO numbers or data or anything but mental instability to back up
any half-baked claims of Superior Performance and Increased Horsepower, &amp;tc.
:)
but i can say this: they do last longer than the previous Champion plugs i
was running. which, if you think about it, would figure: three prongs, so
each prong gets eroded only one-third as much (as a single-prong plug) in
the same number of firings. eh?  i like them. :)

i'm stoopid enough to pay $3.00 per plug for these Bosch (cause Bosch has
been around for a looong time), but i ain't gonna pay $6.00 per plug for
Splitfires. and that's the tooth!

unca joel
