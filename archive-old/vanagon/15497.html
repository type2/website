Subject: /f Mermen show, teeshirts

	Folks, its THURSDAY and I'm just getting the digest from MONDAY-
S l o  o      o      w          e     m     a     i    l     .     .         .

	Actually, I didn't make it to the show myself. I spent most of
the lighted part of the day getting parts for my single-cab 
and working on it, and my brother was kind enough to help through
all that, and so I finished dinner with a friend at about 11:20pm.
I figured the band would get along without me ok. I'd triple booked
the day :-)

	My friends Sarah and Lorne and Joe went, and Joe reports
that it was pretty much the same as their CD Food For Other Fish
(their first CD, and my favorite- recorded in 2 days direct to
2 track DAT). Joe also said it was wickedly loud in the club, and
people who arrived later packed like sardines, with a line outside.
The Mermen played a solid hour and a half set from 10:00 to 11:30, and then
took a break, to presumably return and play from 12:00 to 1:30.
My friends left at the break. 

	DO take ear protection if you see these guys in a small place!

	I hope to make the May 19th show, and won't have anything except
work that day :-( But I like the sardines in loud sauce thing- reminds
me of body surfing!  And I'll bring extra ear protection for friends.

	You'll be able to tell who I am because I'm going to go
to Kinko's Copies and turn my .sig file graphic into a tee shirt.
I'll report on how well this works, and whether they can do the
same thermal printing on flannel. As far as I can tell, the process
is a   C O L O R  transfer, so I'm going to try a big water-color
wash over the b&amp;w image, as well as straight b&amp;w. (or gee, do it
green or amber on black!) I figure white and maroon, and white and
sea blue are the hot setups.

	I blew-up the image below to fill an 8 1/2 X 11 inch sheet
(A4 for non-north americans) in two steps, 200% enlargement and
then 195% enlargement. So anything that fits in 10(V) X 29(H) characters
would take the same 390% enlargement to 8.5 X 11. I'm actually
hoping the tranfer image size is 11 X 14, we'll see.

	There are a number of wonderful .sigs in this group, and
being able to turn one's .sig into a shirt at onesy-twosy prices
and effort would be cool- imho. Heck, we could trade autographs
at the tour and such...

	Just a thought.
