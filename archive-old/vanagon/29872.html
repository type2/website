No.  You only need remove each driveshaft from where they attach to the 
hub (one end) and transmission (the other end).  The driveshafts are 
removed with the CVs attached to them, and the CVs are attached to the 
hub/tranny by 6 bolts at each end.  This is all mechanically very 
straighforward, as you'll see once you crawl under there.

Check the CVs before you rush out and buy replacements--you may not need 
to buy new ones for all (or any--cross your fingers!!) of the CVs.  Them 
puppies are expensive!

While you're at it, be a big shot and buy brand-spankin' new CV boots all 
'round.

St. Muir gives a good run-down on how to do the job, and Bob Hoover 
recommends marking the orientation of the outer CV race to the inner, and 
which bearing track each ball bearing came from, then putting it all back 
back in exactly the same way.  Sounds reasonable to me, and certainly 
will do no harm.
