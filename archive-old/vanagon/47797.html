&gt;I have to stop here and let the cat out of the bag.  Thom sheepishly
&gt;admitted that he is considering a watercooled daily driver.  As I 
&gt;suspected, the comfort level of his '56 is severely lacking on these 106 
&gt;degree days. :)  Sorry Thom, but I just couldn't resist letting that 
&gt;out.....  :)
I know I've given in and gotten a wasserboxer, but I thought _some_ 
people around here had some integrity!  Thom, it's too late for me, but 
I'm shocked that you're weakening!   ;-)
