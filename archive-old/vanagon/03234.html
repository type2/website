Our EV has been very good to us in the first 22,000 miles...  However,
the dealer's behaviour had something to do with it.   During the past
winter I noticed a change in the engine sound.  I asked the
dealer to check it out, they said it was somewhat different, but also
that they could hear the same tones in a brand new EV, so it was probably
a harmless fluke.  After hearing of the &quot;piston slap&quot; problem
common to EV's from James Lindley (formerly of Penn State , now somewhere
in Alaska), I asked my dealer to check for that problem specifically, and
they replaced the engine.  In James Lindstrom's case, they replaced
only one piston.   I know the Dealer in their neck of the woods.  They
have earned the distrust of their most loyal customers, including
my cousin, so I would not trust them.  I feel a lot more comfortable
with a brand new engine in it.   I'll keep this list aware of any new problems
that come up.  So far, so good...
