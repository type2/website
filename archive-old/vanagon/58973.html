&gt; Well, after finally finading some Prestone Long Life coolant, I am
&gt; preparing to change it today.

Consider leaving some room for Redline Water Wetter. This will greatly
reduce corrosion and allow the coolant to transfer heat better. This
product breaks down the surface tension of water, allowing it to hug the
cylinder head walls much better, causing less eddys and turbulence and
therefore pitting and corrosion. I just bought some and will install
soon. Type Water Wetter in at Alta Vista and there are web pages on
this. As well there have been discussions on the list about this.
