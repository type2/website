Subject: Baja Bus Run in 76' Westy-long

Well we made it back!!

We left for Baja on the 27th from the San Fernando Valley, CA in the Early
Morning.  This was the 1st big trip for us in the bus. We left with three of
our friends.  The Caravan(Excuse the use of the word) consisted of the Bus,
my friends 80's Jeep Cherokee, and my other friend 80's Pick Up.  Basically
the bus and two 4X4's---I figured we were going to be in trouble keeping
up!!  The plan was for 1 night camping--I know kinda wimpy--and 2 nights
hotel--friends did not want an all roughing it vacation.

Day one:  Wednesday--Traveled to area just south of Rosarito-Baja Newport
and stayed there for the night.  The bus kept up on the highway 60-65 MPH
for long extended periods--I was impressed!  The only casualty---Truck
passing from the opposite lane dropped a stone about the size of a
baseball---Truck going 45-50 MPH---Bus going 65 MPH combined force at impact
110-115 MPH---REAL FAST---about 2&quot; above where my VW emblem would be if I
had one.  End result--3&quot; diameter dent about 1/2 inch deep---Lets not talk
about how loud it was or how it scared the crap out of us.

Day two:  Thursday--Friends surfed in front of the hotel--then Headed South
for San Quintin.  Hwy 1 is really bad about 75% potholes---The Michelin XZX
did great.  We were in search of a Surfing Area near San Jacinto.  We turned
off the main road about 2 1/2 hours south of Ensenada--and it was off road
for us.  Well here is where my  wife Laura started to believe in the bus.
We were able to handle all the ditches, wash outs, high centers etc.  My
frieds with the 4 wheelers kept telling me how well the bus would do, but
now I beleived them.  We were off road for a quite a few miles and started
to think we might be lost--no signs etc.  Finally in the distance we saw a
really strange sight.  There was a ship wreck listing on its side at about
45 degree angle.  The sun was almost down and as we got closer we saw
campfires...we had found the surfing areas.  We camped 50 feet from this
100+ foot long old Freighter called the Vista Del Carmen--It was truly an
incredible experience.  

Day Three and Four--Back at the hotel for the night of day three--just some
partying and hanging out.  Two hour wait at the border coming back on day
four.  

All in all a great trip!!---one other casualty though...found a 1/2 &quot; crack
in the winshield.

If anyone is interested in more infomation about the campground feel free to
E-mail me.

Thanks to all of you who gave me advice on what to take with us.
