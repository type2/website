Subject: Elec. Leak Draining My Battery!

There is an electrical leak somewhere in my van that drains my battery dead
over about a 12 to 24 hour period. Short of feeling every thing in the van
to see what parts are getting hot, I am not sure the best way to trace this
and I need the help of my VanaNetziens. 

What I have tried is this: I have disconnected the ground strap from the
battery and incerted an LED under the theory that the LED would be lit if
there was a current draw in the system somewhere. (The LED is attached on
one side to the battery and the other side to the disconnected ground wire).
Unfortunately, the LED seems to be lit all the time, even when I disconnect
every fuse. 

Next, I tried took the little light over the driver's side and tried the
same trick. This light was never lit at all except just a little tiny flash
when I plugged the car stereo in. 

So I am thinking that perhaps the little light demands too much current to
flash and the LED needs too little current to light up and that I have to
experiment with a very small incandescent bulb.

But then I am wondering--how to you trace an electrical leak by the book? 

There must be a simpler way to trace this. I wish I had some kind of Ammeter
and knew how to use it. Then I could see what the amp draw is and determine
when it goes away after I disconnect various fuses.
