Subject: Arizona (New Mexico?) Bus Bash



Ok, here's the list I have of people in AZ:

(we might want to take this discussion out of the vanagon list
 once we know that all the AZ and/or NM people are listening.)

Dyer Lytle (Tucson) (me!)
lytle_at_noao_dot_edu

Todd R. Schroeder (Phoenix)
todds_at_sunnet.chotel_dot_com

Dave Phillips (Tucson)
phillips_at_aries.tucson.saic_dot_com

Dave Black (Sedona)
dblack_at_argus.lowell_dot_com

Seems like there was someone else over at UMC who was asking
me about carburation problems recently, can't find the mail file
tho....

What about NM people?  I think there was only one, probably in
Albuquerque...  (anyone remember how to get this info from this
listserver?)

Todd sez:

&gt; While we're discussing that neck of the woods, how about Tuweap
&gt; (aka Toroweap) on the Arizona Strip. Do you know the place?
&gt; It's smack dab in the middle of the Grand Canyon.  The camping
&gt; area is basically one big rock. Only major drawback is that
&gt; it's about 65 miles of dirt road from Fredonia, AZ, and if
&gt; one is prone to sleepwalking, there's about a 3000 foot drop, 
&gt; but a cool photo op!

Never been there myself, heard of it though.  Sounds nice but it might
take quite a while to get there with that 65 mile dirt road drive.

&gt; Sound good to me -- is Peppersauce (outside Oracle) still there?
&gt; I though it may have been gobbled up by the Biosphere. I still
&gt; like the Chiricahuas, like over Memorial day......

Peppersauce is still there, gets overrun with ghetto-blaster toting
teens quite a bit in the summer, might be OK this time of year, and
there is great mountain biking there too!

Yep, I like the Chiricahuas too but its not very central, a long
trip for Dave Black.  (I specially like the east side!)

Dave Black sez:

&gt; Hey Dyer and Todd (and anybody else, for that matter), if you guys are 
&gt; serious about this, I'd like to get in on it.  I don't know much about 
&gt; AZ yet, though, so I can't make many recommendations.  There's also the 
&gt; little problem of my Bus being holed up in my garage, and not wanting 
&gt; to come out!  Hopefully I can get it fixed soon (don't know whats wrong 
&gt; yet), but if not, I'd use one of my other cars (yes, I admit to owning 
&gt; something other than VW's and Volvos!)  However, if you choose a spot 
&gt; close enough to Oak Creek, I can probably *push* it there!

Hmmm, Oak Creek Canyon is really nice even in winter.  Of course there are
Mogollon rim areas, white mountains, etc.  A ski/camping trip?  Sunset crater
area is nice in winter although cold!

So, who is seriously interested in some sort of AZ get-together?  Or AZ/NM?
Or AZ/NM/CO/UT  :-) ?   The Four-corners bus bash!
