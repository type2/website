&gt;Sorry,guys,when I said any 12v relay would work I was just assuming I was
&gt;talking to fellow technicians. You do need a reasonably strong one(the Ghia
&gt;horn relay always worked fine, a radiator fan relay from a rabbit or
&gt;Vanagon should work fine).

Some are fairly technical, some aren't.

In my experience Newark is that they almost always have what you want in
stock and can efficiently get your order out to you very quickly.  On the
price side they range from a little high to a lot high.  The current price is
almost always higher than the current catalog (even is it just came out
yesterday) but will often sell it to you at the catalog price or some
discount anyway if you nag them a bit.  I guess you gotta pay for that in
stock and speedy delivery service.
