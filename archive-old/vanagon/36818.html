Subject: Year model...

I was checking one of the model description lists in the gopher archives
and found info that disagrees with info that I found in a book.  The gopher
archive for models between '49 &amp; ? says that The Bozobus (682457) is a '60,
but the book said that the same S/N was a '61.  Mr. Bozo's manufacturing
date (from VW AG) is 11/15/60, which would lead me to believe that he's a
'61 model year vehicle.  Any truly definitive answers?  I wouldn't want my
data in the weakly stats (or in my alternate signature file) to be wrong...
