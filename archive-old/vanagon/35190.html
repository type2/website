&gt; While searching for probable causes of my bust's lousy performance I went
&gt; out and got a compression tester and a fuel/vacuum pressure gauge.  I've
&gt; never done a compression test on this motor before so I thought it might be
&gt; a good idea.  I figured it would be ok because the bus starts great and runs
&gt; ok -- aside from the up and down idle speed.
&gt; 
&gt; I pulled the plugs and did a compression test, here's the results:
&gt; 
&gt; Cyl          Compression          Plug condition
&gt; ---          -----------          --------------
&gt;  1                0 (or Oh-Oh)    Looked perfect, like the day it was born.
&gt;  2               70               Some carbon deposits, a little oily.
&gt;  3                0 (see #1)      Carbonated, oily build-up.
&gt;  4              101               Not quite a briquette's worth, but close +
&gt; some oil
&gt; 

G'day from Down Under

One of the tricks my Grandad taught me was;
before doing a compression test,
1. loosen all plugs by half a turn
2. start the engine
3. switch off, remove plugs and then test
(remember to keep the throttle wide open when testing)

The reason for this? Especially in older engines there is a carbon 
buildup around the plugs. If you just remove the plugs the carbon falls 
into the cylinder and when you test, this carbon can get stuck under the 
valves and result in &quot;strange&quot; readings.

If you start the engine, this carbon gets forcibly ejected.

Try it and see if anything changes.

Good Luck!
