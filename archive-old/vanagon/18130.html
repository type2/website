To all who replied to my message about the windfall in tires ...

I honestly did not post it to gloat (at least not at this time,
 although I reserve that  choice when the full measure of my DEAL HITS ME). :) :) :)

I was sharing another option that, at least, I had not considered before and perhaps if 
you find a similar dealer in your respective areas, you may want to invest a few 
minutes to explore the possibility.

I've driven by that dealer's location many, many times without stopping or even 
considering a stop. I can't explain why I wanted to stop this time.

I believe, fate, destiny &amp; fortune comes in pairs (and even threes) sometimes.

If 'little ole me' can find a deal out here in the cruel East, the opportunity for some of 
you exists also.  Go for it!

Stay tuned for the gloating ... coming up right after GNATT and Post-Trip messages!
