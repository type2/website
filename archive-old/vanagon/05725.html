&gt;5$ w/latches - thats a steal!
&gt;
&gt;Good ones (little rust) go for about 60 quid over here - if
&gt;you find any.
&gt;
&gt;I've never seen the spoon type latches so I don't know what
&gt;they look like. Mine's just a '64 so it's got the late ones.
&gt;The latches can go for up to 20 quid over here.

The spoon latches are all chrome, while the later ones have little plastic
knobs that you grab to open the windows.   With the spoons, the ends look
kinda like a sugar scoop, and you hook your finger under them to open them,
rather that gripping the little knows.  Also, the spoons open the window
over _twice_ as wide as the later ones, so you get some serious airflow.
I've seen spoons for $20 apiece at shows.

BTW - they are interchangeable!

I'll keep my eyes peeled!
