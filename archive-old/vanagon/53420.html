Subject: Radio &amp; Electronic Anti-Theft Security Code


Well....mankind has done some stupit thinks
(no a mispelling )  &amp; here are two of them:


1. VW has this %^&amp;*ing EAS system in radios-
(service guy at parts say see my problem alot)

2.I did not keep my my code in van.

Can you help with a way to unlock the secreat
to music???? Tried a night in the  freezer - no
go!

 BACKGROUND RANTINGS
While on a family outing put a frozen tape in a
frozen radio &amp; it jammed on fast forward -
pulled the fuse to stop the unit from burning
out -put fuse in to get back interior lights -tried
code once- left children in van-children tried
code once and one half-got home found code-got
2 of 5 didgets entered and was &quot;locked-out&quot;

I will be making an eight hour trip to Cape
Breton Island with no radio, no tunes !!!!

Dealer wants C$120 and says it has to be
shipped.

And advice, comments , suggestions, or
co-miseration????? 

EVEN MORE RANTING
Got: no tunes; no radio;.......... no guru; no
method; no teacher; just me and nature in the
Westie, with the Father,  the Son and the Holy
Spirit,...........Think I'll be singing a pile of  &quot;Van
the Man&quot; tunes while following my star to Cape
Breton Island.

CHRISTMAS RANTING
&quot;Celebrate the Joy&quot;
