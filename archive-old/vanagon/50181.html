Subject: Help,  Need L/H Drill Bit

Okay, living in a pristine wilderness does have a couple of drawbacks.  One
of them is that there are no easy sources for off-the-wall tools and such.
So...  Does anyone have a source for L/H drill bits.  Either mail-order or
maybe a local source and you could mail it to me??  I need to remove a
broken 6mm screw, so I suspect that something around 1/8&quot; would do.  If you
have any suggestions, please drop me a line.
