&gt;Yes, they are the same fuel pump, PN 251-906-091.  They fit Buses/Vanagons
&gt;75-91 and Beetles/Convertibles 75-79

Hmmmm....strange that the same pump fits so many years and models.  Even
stranger that my VW dealor wanted $250 for a new one for my 85 Westy.  Can

85 Westy, 76 Goldwing, 51 Plymouth, 75 Mercedes...need more toys!
