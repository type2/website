Subject: Re:  Speaking of CB Antennas

Ric &quot;(antenna) whip me&quot; Golen wonders if:

&gt;So I am about to replace it, and I'm wondering if anyone out there
&gt;has had any experience with those &quot;black boxes&quot; that are supposed
&gt;to allow the radio antenna to be used as a CB antenna? Or am I
&gt;doomed to drilling some holes?

'Sorry, no experience, but I saw someone mention the magnetic antennas..
Have you tried one of them?  I have the one that those Car&amp;Driver guys
appear to use on their tests and my opinion of them is that they're good
for up to 3 miles (assuming you don't have a hill in between), somewhat
convenient in that you don't have to drill holes, BUT, if you're anal
about your paint job, you must be sure that the mounting surface is clean,
and that the antenna cable to the CB is securely attached so that it 
doesn't rub into the paint from wind buffeting.
