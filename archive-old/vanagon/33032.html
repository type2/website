Subject: odd brick

Driving home, I noticed a '70s-era brick with what looked to be almost a=
 radiator along the front -- I guessed it was some kind of ventilation unit,=
 it looked very good, like it had come from the factory that way -- anyone=
 have any guesses as to what it was..?

Then there was the v.cool Eurovan pickup I saw a while back...
