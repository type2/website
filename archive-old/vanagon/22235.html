  Joerg,

  I don't think that either the size or number of batteries will affect
  the alternator. The school buses that I drove when I was in college
  had a very standard, dinky little Delco alternator charging two of the
  biggest batteries that I've  ever seen &lt;enough cold cranking amperes to
  start an 850 cubic inch diesel engine&gt;.
