Subject: Brakes - Adj &amp; 12mm Rotor


I did some brake work on the '89
Westie Syncro (cost detail follows), and
have  3 questions. Also &amp; looking for
tips on adjusting park break &amp; getting
air out of lines.

Any members of the list live near 700
block of Aberdino St, Fredericton, NB?
Could use a test pilot to try the brakes.

Cheers

ADJUSTING STARS...
QUESTION 1: When listening for
shoe-to- hub contact, should you rotate
the hub using the lugs or by pushing on
the top of the hub?


BACKGROUND:
I adjusted the shoes &quot;out&quot; (pushed
down from above?) until the noise of
the break was audible when the hub
was turned using the lug studs. Then I
re-adjusted the shoes &quot;in&quot; until the
noise disappeared when turning the
hub with the lug studs. However; when
I rotated the left hub by pushing on the
top of the hub I could hear a scrap!! I
re-re-adjusted the shoes &quot;in&quot; some more
until no scrape sound was audible
when rotating the hub with a push
from the top. Did I do the right thing??

editorial comment &quot;God bless John
Muir! I would never have figured the
stars out using the Bentley.&quot;



FRONT ROTORS
QUESTION 2:
Should I worry about rust collecting  on
a spare pair of 12mm rotors that I want
to store? If yes, how do you prevent the
rust? 

QUESTION 3:
The Bentley says that 13mm is a
minimum - any one got experience
using rotors measuring 12mm.


BACKGROUND:
The original front rotors were turned &amp;
when I got them back I misread the
calipers &amp; mistakenly concluded they
were 9mm thick. When you use the
caliper correctly they measure out at 11
 or 12 mm. I put them on until the new
pair could be ordered, and drove
gingerly for about 500 km. There was a
squeak that got progressively worse.
The new rotors arrived and installation
went well - no squeak. I am hoping to
store the old rotors as spares. (editorial
note - since this was my first break job
the squeak could have been from the
workmanship not rotor thickness)
