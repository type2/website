Subject: public thank you


Thanks to everyone for making last nite's party here such a success!
I still feel embarassed that I was totally empty handed wrt food and
drink, but you all came through as if you owned restaurants!  The
food was outrageous in both quality and quantity.  

For those of you who weren't able to make it, probably someone will
post the details, but one of the highlights was a gigantic
wrestling match with David S, Shelley, Bradley, and Sarah.  It's
a wonder they're all still alive  :)
