Subject:       Re: DEALER SURVEY PLEASE RESPOND.

I deal with Guildford Motors, in Surrey, BC.  I have been dealing 
with them since 1988.  They have an excellent track record with me.  
I have recommended several people to them, and they are also very 
satisfied.  They have good parts availability, and their mechanics 
really know what they are doing.  It's rare these days to find these 
qualities, but it sure is nice being treated like a person instead of 
a number.  They have been  100% fault-free on my '87 Golf Diesel, and 
my '90 Syncro Westy, as well as my Mother-in-Law's Golf.  

You pay for this service though... $75/hr!  But I have never had to 
go back for anything, and I am a very picky customer.  I wouldn't 
dream of taking my vehicles to another dealer.  They are loyal to 
their customers, and customer satisfaction is their top priority.

After reading some of the horror stories people have presented on 
this list about dealerships, I feel quite lucky to have such a 
responsible dealership.

Harry.
