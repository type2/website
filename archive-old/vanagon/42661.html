Subject: Digest mode question 

I have a question for people using digest mode and who read their mail
using VM in emacs.

When I do a vm-burst-digest, the digest message is nicely separated
into each unique mail message. Unfortunately, the subject field is
blank in the INBOX Summary buffer.


How do I get the subjects to appear?

Thanks,
