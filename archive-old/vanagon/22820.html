&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Allen, 
&gt; &gt;Is there still a gathering planned for Hatteras this fall (creeping up upon us)
&gt; &gt;?   I'm interested.....
&gt; 

&gt; I thought I would reply to your message as Allen can't seem to get
&gt; our sys admin to fix his email.  Yes a group of bus people/surfers
&gt; are going to be in Cape Hatteras September 4-10.  We are going to
&gt; go to BBTA in St. Louis September 1-3 then on to Hatteras.  Final
&gt; details to be worked out in the next week.  Look forward to meeting
&gt; you if you can make it.
&gt; 
That is, of course, if there's anything left after the hurricane.
Current forecasts have it hovering over the coast for a day or more,
destroying a lot of stuff. They are evacuating all the coastal area. It
sounds as though this may be pretty serious.
Then of course, there could be some BIG waves!!!
:)
Richard
