Subject: Re: EV w/MXL in snow


I have to agree with Moe (who lives just down the road a piece..), the MXLs 
are a whole hell of a lot better than the Contis that came with my EV in ALL 
conditions. Rignt now my Michelins have close to 20K on them, and its the 
second winter that I've had them on, and even with 20K miles on them, they 
are better than the Contis were from day one!
