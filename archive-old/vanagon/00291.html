It would be interesting to me, as a 1986 Westphalia owner/Interneter to 
also hear how everyone powers and uses computers and technology in their 
vans, and if you use cellular or satellite or some other comm. method to 
connect with nets/compuserve, etc. while traveling?

I have one of those acoustic couplers that are supposed to work with pay 
phones, But it's not too reliable. Sure would be nice to sit at the edge 
of the ocean at Big Sur, California (two hours away) and connect up to 
the net!
