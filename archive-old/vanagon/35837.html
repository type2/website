&gt; consider putting that $200.00 towards a real oil cooler set-up.  My
&gt; van has 16 plate flat cooler in front of the radiator, thermostat controlled.
&gt; Done lots of these instalations. Works great.  Maintains temp 210 or less
&gt; most conditions.

Do you really need that on a diesel? I've never had any overheating problems
with VW diesels. Not even pulling a boat with my Westy diesel. Nor
driving 100+ mph on the Autobahn in a Audi 80 turbo diesel.

I would think that the vw diesel requires less cooling than the corresponding
gas engine. The 2.0 GTI gas engine has basically the same block and head
design as the 1.6 diesel, but the 2.0 GTI engine generates more than twice 
as much waste heat at full power compared to the 1.6 diesel. Don't the
VW gas engines do fine with the same oil cooler setup as the stock Vanagon
and the turbo diesel uses? (If I remember correctly the Rabbit/Jetta
non turbo 1.6 diesel came without an oil cooler at all)

With the winters we have here in Rochester NY I would appreciate some 
way of keeping the engine temperature UP. I can hardly use the heater
without having the temperature dip into the &quot;unfilled square&quot; first
part of the scale.

Am I completely wrong or?
