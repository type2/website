I found the bus models that were recently the subject of discussion.

I the Arden Mall here in Sac, one of the kiosks had them, as well as
little bugs.

I got one of the black and yellow ones and one of the red and yellow
ones (that has (LA on the top)

They are actually pretty good models.  They resemble an early '50s panel.
They have a sliding door, but the impression for the two doors.  They have
bubble tail lights and 3rd brake light, but I'm going to put a dab of red 
paint on them 'cause they're the same color as the body.  They need 
semaphores!  Also, the windshields have a thick secondary frame, kinda
like safari windows!

I think I might paint one of them to match my bus (once its done)

The best part, is they were only $4 each.  On the other hand, he only
had one black/yellow and a few red/yellows.  He said he's been having a
hard time getting them.
