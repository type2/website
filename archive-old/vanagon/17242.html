I had a ball joint replaced on my syncro. It made a klunking sound.

It cost about $2,000 to replace plus another $2,000 of diagnostic time.
Plus, of course, about $50 in parts plus other parts they replaced but
didn't have to.

I am not kidding you--I have the receipts to prove it.

All under warranty, of course.
