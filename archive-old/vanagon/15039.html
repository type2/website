&gt; fragility?? Not to discourage Dave Kautz, but to rebuild on your own looks
&gt; like a gamble to me. Purchased rebuilts may not be better, but at least
&gt; they usually come with a warranty.

  Good point, Sami. I'm leaning towards a GEX rebuilt long block. At $300 
  for heads plus another $300 for pistons/cylinders plus another $100 for
  bearings and gaskets I'm most of the way to the cost of the rebuilt
  already. Not to mention my depression.......Between Dave Black, Chris
  Bridge, Dave Phillips and myself I think we have reached the critical
  mass for a new SulkNet VW group!
