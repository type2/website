Subject: Time for a new starter?
Date: Thu, 20 Apr 95 10:07:41 EDT

 I know that sometimes, if your van won't start, (as in nothing at all
happens when you turn the key) you can bang on the
starter and solenoid a bit, and get it to start. This usually happens
when parked on hills. My question is, since this is happening, is a new
starter in order? I think this occurs as a result of the brushes
settling away from the contact points, so perhaps just putting in new
brushes would solve things? Anyway, all advice welcomed, as I have never
really messed with these things.
