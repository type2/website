Subject: locks and keys

Thanks to those who have been providing all the info about rekeying locks.  It
never even occurred to me to try and do this.  Now when my next lock goes I'll
be ready.
 
I've got a few questions regarding my '67.  First, does anyone know where I can
get the squeeze bulb for the windershield wiper fluid bottle?  BFY has them, but
they cost $30.  I'd be perfectly willing to pay that much if it was a moter, but
it's too much for a squirt gun!  Second, does anyone know where I can get
original VW keys?  I've seen these thru '66, but not for '67.
 
Thanks, Bill in WI
