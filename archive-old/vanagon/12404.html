&gt;&gt;So David Kao says:
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I did was I bought a pair of 6 1/2 inch subwoofers. I flush mounted
&gt;&gt;&gt; them below the original Blaupunkt speakers and changed a little bit of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; wiring. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You lost me on this mounting bit David.  Are you saying you mounted the
&gt;&gt;subwoofers (I have a hard time calling 6 1/2 inch speakers woofers) below
&gt;&gt;and perpendicular to the Blaupunkt's or what?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Steven
&gt;&gt;

Sorry I did not make it clear. I did not believe 6 1/2&quot; could qualify
as (sub) woofer untill I tried them with my stereo in the house then I decided
to put them on my 84 vanagon. The subwoofers were on my yuk BMW 2002, not exactly
bought from a store but I paid to get the BMW...

Below the Blaupunkt there is a space enough for flush mounting a 6 1/2 speaker.
Window glass does not go down that low so it won't get in the way of the glass.
You don't need to cut any sheet metal either. Does it sound more interesting
now?

If you take the door panel off you will see the sheet metal opening there. The
opening is not round but you can mount a speaker with 4 screws neatly.
Actually, the sheet metal opening is not exactly big enough for 6 1/2 speaker.
Especially my subwoofer has a fairly big magnet, it did not fit in. I had to
mount the speaker 1/2 inch above the mounting surface by adding a 1/2&quot; thick
plywood cut to fit the back of the frame (rim) of the speaker. I wrapped the
plywood rim with balck tape so it looks really nice. I cut a hole from the
door panel and reinstalled the panel back. Then I flush mounted the subwoofer
(sandwitched the plywood rim) to the door. The plastic pocket on driver's door
needs to be moved. It can be moved without leaving any scar.

The subwoofer, mounted in such location, is about at my (and the passenger's)
foot tip on the door. It won't get in my foot's way but I did kick it
by accident from time to time. I got a dent on the speaker grille already.
SO look for a stronger grille for the speakers.

The subwoofers I got have great bass indeed. The door provides enough room
(functions as the speaker box) and the bass gets ereally low.
Hope this helps.
