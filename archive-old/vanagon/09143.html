     Hi Chris,
     
&gt;Hi everybody, I've got a '69 Camper that I was thinkin about 
&gt;dropping a bigger motor in.  Are there bigger beasties that 
&gt;might plug right in?  Anybody ever tried it?
     
     
Well now, you could go two ways here. Either stick in a big-bore (1835cc) Type I
motor with dual-port heads, twin carbs, a mild cam, a larger oil pump, a 
external supplement oil cooler, a lightened flywheel, and a CrMoly balanced 
crank. That's give you about 100bhp. Or you could get hold of an 1800 Type IV 
motor from a 412 GL and stick that in - thats got about 85 bhp stock as I 
remember, the only trouble being that you loose the rear removable section under
the engine lid. But be aware also that the Type IV motor is expensive to repair!
