John:

My first impression ...you are not a TREKKIE (Star Trek fan)!!! :)

I'll set up the VCR and meet you at Jacques Sunday evening at 6:00 pm.

If any of the other folks in the area would like to join us the address is:

	Jacques, 3012 N. Wilson Blvd in Ballston, Virginia

We've been trying to get something moving since that meeting.

I've sent several follow up messages but ...
