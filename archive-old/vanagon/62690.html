Subject: Painting with HVLP?
Date: Sat, 12 Jul 1997 08:20:14 -0700

I'd like to hear from list members who have any experience painting with
the high-volume-low-pressure (HVLP) non-compressor sprayers.  I mean the
kind that have an electric powered turbine, large diameter air hose, etc. 

A couple of years ago, before the list was split to Vanagon and air-cooled,
I thought someone posted their story about using one of these to
(economically) paint their van.  I recall some talk about buying a
reconditioned unit from the Damark catalog for $100-$200.  My search of the
archives turned up nothing.

My friend, John Hess, wants to paint his Dormobile and he is considering
this method.  Any info.on this would be much appreciated.  

Thanks, Volks!
