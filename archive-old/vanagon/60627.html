Subject: Service Manuals

I am on the verge of ordering a sevice manual from the Bus depot.  Is
$66.95 an average price for the book. I know they are much more
expensive other places.  I am just wondering if I should wait until I go
to the next VW show to buy one.  I would not mind having a 
pre experienced copy.

You have to be when you own more than one, if you want to keep them all
running.

Your input is appreciated.
