Subject: Air Conditioning Changeover?

I have an '86 Westy with what I have been told is an &quot;after market&quot; 
airconditioning system, although it appears to be the standard one used 
in Westys. 
It uses CFC as a refrigerant gas that I am told will be nearly impossible 
(read VERY expensive) soon and that there appears to be no safe 
alternative available.

So now what? Does anyone know of a pending replacement for the Freon now 
being used that is a direct replacement, or will it use whatever the 
newer airconditioners use that I am told destroys all the seals on older 
units not made for it. NOT interchangable with the Freon units. Will I 
enventually have to replace the entire airconditioning system - if so 
does anyone know which one is recommended and how much that will cost?
-Jack
