&gt; &gt;probably answer this better, but i overheard some vw folks talking about just
&gt; &gt;this.  Seems that the gauge is somewhere on the &quot;top&quot; of the engine.  you've
&gt; &gt;got to open the back hatch, and take off the &quot;cushion&quot; (if you've the camper
&gt; &gt;variety) and take off the metal plate, so that you are looking down onto the
&gt; &gt;top of the engine.  After this i got lost, since i was not &quot;looking&quot; at the
&gt; &gt;time.  Tho you should be able to find out where the gauge is from one of the
&gt; &gt;various vw bibles (engine books--libraries are great for this).  Also heard
&gt; &gt;that this problem (taking off the metal plate) was only for certain years.
&gt; 
&gt; this is a fix that allows you to replace the sender without removing the
&gt; engine ... but it initially requires CUTTING that hole in the 'luggage area'
&gt; back of the rear seat. my non-bentley vw repair book gives specific
&gt; dimensions for making this cut. my brother actually did it on his 73 bus,
&gt; but imho, it looked kinda crappy with that little piece of tin screwed over
&gt; the hole afterward. still ... it was a lot quicker. and you only have to cut
&gt; the hole once (yeah, but how many times do you expect the fuel tank sender
&gt; to croak?)
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, if anybody wants a copy, lemme know. or i could type it up for here.

so thats what the hole in my 78 westy is for.  mine s really crappy, as 
it was sealed with duct tape
