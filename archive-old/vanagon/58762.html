Subject: Re: bought 97 ev sell 86westie!

Some time ago I reported on test driving both the '95 and '97 Eurovan
campers by Winebago. I concur with those who would rather stick with the Westy
That's why I spent 4 months searching for mine and am having it shipped back
from MN.

Although the 2 I test drove had many differences - I still could not force
myself to buy one due to the interior &quot;lack of&quot; quality - In my opinion.

I actually found a brochure on the '93 Eurovan &quot;weekender&quot; which had much nicer
seats and interior (by VW of course) that &quot;match&quot; those in my '91 Westy ! the
grey velour, euro style!

Just my 2 cents worth!

&gt; 
&gt; IN the new Eurovan, the rear passenger seat is molded, which equates with
&gt; comfort for passengers riding, but does not create a great sleeping surface
&gt; (ridges and bumps). So what has Winnebago (Bag-a-Wino) done to rectify this
&gt; situation?
&gt; 
&gt; There is a very thin (about 3/4 inch) mattress that unfolds from the back
&gt; area and *SNAPS TO THE SEAT AND BACK area* to attempt to flatten out the
&gt; ridges. I personally tried this out, and found it cumbersome, ungainly in
&gt; appearance, and extremely uncomfortable!
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps it might be good for someone who doesn't toss and turn, but with
&gt; about 8 small diameter snaps to snap the top mattress to the rear seat
&gt; bench, I have a feeling that this feature may not be popular with many
&gt; Volks. (The snaps are about the same diameter as on your rear hatch
&gt; screen.)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the rear area is &quot;slotted,&quot; ostensibly to allow moving larger sheets
&gt; of plywood, or furniture, so the &quot;top mattress&quot; covers this area and the
&gt; spacer piece that covers it. ...Seem to me --lots of pieces to get lost
&gt; over the years!
&gt; 
&gt; The rear closet has a sliding door, which is a good thought, however, the
&gt; sliding door on the vehicle I examined was made of cheap mortarboard, (sort
&gt; of like thin wall panelling). It did not slide easliy, and looked as though
&gt; the last person had popped it out of its track.
&gt; 
&gt; Way Prefer my 89 Westy!
&gt; 
&gt; My 2 cents!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; differences between the two some bad some good In all honesty I would
&gt; &gt;&gt; say the westie version camper is better thought out almost like one
&gt; &gt;&gt; designer went camping and the the other didnt...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        Could you give some examples?  I have to believe that the Winnebago
&gt; &gt;designers have done some camping.  Is it a difference between European and
&gt; &gt;American camping?  I keep hearing on this list that Westfalia conversions
&gt; &gt;are better than the Winnebago, but I haven't seen any specific examples.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanx.
