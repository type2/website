Ladies &amp; Gentlemen ( and I do use the term loosely),
I can't strongly enough recommend getting a  little 12 volt air
compressor for your vanagons!  I got mine for free, but Kmart sells
these things pretty cheeply.  Why?
Well imagine driving anywhere in the snow and upon having a flat having
to change it.  I have to tell you that changing a tire in &lt;0 weather
was not what I wanted to do tonight, but my vanagon wanted me to do this.
However, I have to say that pumping the thing up with the compressor
sure did save a lot of wear and tear on me.  If the flat comes from a
slow leak, it lets you get to a comfortable place to change tires, at
least.
Strange, once you see how simple these air compressors are, you begin to
wonder why car makers don't include these things as standard equipment.
Gosh, after tonight's experience, I'd sure say they ought to.
