&gt; Yes, the majority voted for Jan. 6, 7, 8, which is the first
&gt; full weekend in January, and the preferred location (democratically)
&gt; is Pfeiffer.  At least two people are coming from as far away
&gt; as Canada.  C'mon, you east coasters!!!!!!  :)
&gt; 
Hey, since they're doing it so far in the future, we definately should do
something as well.Just because there are like 10 times as many people
out west doesn't mean we can't have fun here too. Any suggestions?
I can recommend lotsa great places in North Carolina, and it is kinda
central for the east coast. Any takers?
Richard
