&gt;The engine was rebuilt 20000 miles ago by Volkswagen/Audi of Canada.  I
&gt;assumed it was a 78.  However, the engine number indicated a late 1975
&gt;crankcase.  When I took the push rods out, they were the hollow ones used
for
&gt;solid lifters(approx 261 cm long).  I preceded to remove the lifters and
&gt;confirmed that I did have hydraulic lifters.  So why do I have the wrong
push
&gt;rods?  Should I purchase the ones for hydraulic lifters or is there a reason
&gt;why VW put the ones in that they did?

You do not have the wrong push rods as the pushrods are different lenghts for
solid and hydraulic lifters.  Not interchangeable.
