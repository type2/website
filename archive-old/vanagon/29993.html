YEP,

did this 2 weeks ago in the '78 though I did not eliminate the
control box as mine is OK, merely plugeed it off.  On the westy the rear
duct is under the back seat perfectly located to suck the cold air from
back low back though for reheating.  I detailed similar conversions on
the list before in the '76 but had not thought at the time to use
existing heat duct as the port though which to get the air.  I cut a 3&quot;
hole in the engine tin to bring the pipr through, used aluminized heater
tube from Automotion.  This is the best thing yet I've done with no
noticeable interior holes like I had done before.  Here is an even
better idea I though of later and did not implement that involves cutting no
holes.  Disconect the heat to one side of the Y shaped piece above the
axle and block off the Y or if you Y is shot eliminate it straight
piping it from one heat exchanger through flew down to the big center
tube.  now attach a flew from rearmost vent to the  output side of the
disconnected exchanger.  Replace the current fan with an inline blower
connecting the two engine compartment tubes and run the air sucked in
BACKWARDS though one heat exchanger into the other then into the car.
I'm willing to bet that you will experince better heat even though the
flow might be less but using one of those high CFM inline booster fans
from Whitless I'm betting on more heat.  The true glory this works if
your Y is messed up, if the front box is messed up you can eliminate
like he said, hell al you need are 2 good boxes.  No cutting or
anything, all can be returned to stock.  1 problem remeber the cooling
fan supplies some of the air into the exchanger so the rectangular duct
from it will need to be blocked on the one you run backwards, simply
stuff some foam in it or something.  And less people worry that our
leaky bays won't allow in enough fresh air to since wer're
recirculating, fresh air is still admitted from the cooling fan duct to
the remaining forward running exchanger.  This whole thing is only as
much as the blower fan and tube cost, and I'll lay odds it will be
great, plus no need to cut the body, firewall, tin or anything.

Think about it bay owners youll get my idea.
