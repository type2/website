Happy Holidays!

Let's try this again. FYI, I'm selling this for a friend. I'm not a westy
owner so please forgive any mistakes. I do know it's from an early to mid
80's Vanagon, stainless steel sink w/poly tank, fridge (but no tank),
cabinet is in excellent shape. My friend wants $100 firm. This doesn't
include shipping from Cincinnati, Ohio.

thanks,

tony
