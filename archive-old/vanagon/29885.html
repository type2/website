Subject: Australian campers (to rent)

I'm off to Australia on Sunday to visit my SO's family for Xmas and want to
ask a favour of anyone who lives in or near Sydney. Do you know of a place
that rents air-cooled VW campers? (or even Beetles) I'm sure I saw an ad for
such a place when I was there a few years ago but haven't been able to find
out from here. We want to drive down the coast to Melbourne and back and I
can't hack two weeks driving one of those gruesome T*y*ta contraptions.
Sorry for asking about this at the very last moment but we only decided to
go on Wednesday so I'm rushing around buying Xmas prezzies and mince pies
and the like. BTW, don't ever expect to be able to buy flip-flops and
sunblock in the Midlands in November :)
