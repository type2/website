Subject: Fwd: Zodi hot showers re: operative URL

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

Martha wrote about convection heaters available from Zodi, but the URL she
had was a bad address.

Try http://www.inconcepts_dot_com/Zodi/product/html

Search: http://www. Hotbot_dot_com 

The site gives good descriptions, but no prices.

You may e-mail for a catalog or for other purposes.
