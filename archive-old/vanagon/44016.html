Subject: Help: Need 15&quot; Wheels for VANAGON

Hi,
I trying to find tires for my '89 Westie and I'm having some trouble.  While
looking, I noticed that there is an excellent selection of tires that will
fit and carry the load in 15&quot; sizes.

I'd like to get some 6x15 or 6.5x15 steel wheels to solve the tire
availability problem, but I'm unsure about bolt patterns, wheel offsets and
the like.  Could anyone that has done this offer some hints?

Note: I tried a set of late model Mercedes alloys and as reported, they have
the correct bolt pattern, however, the bolt holes are smaller and the wheels
are thicker.  So different lug nuts / lug bolts would be required.  Anyone
know where to get those?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Bo Kersey
