&gt; if you can gopher in to halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu and look in Miscellaneous/
&gt; Vanagon/Files, there are a couple of Road Tests on the vw eurovan camper
&gt; and the winnebago camper, and a short take article on the vw camper. these
&gt; articles have some specs/stats in them.

Here are some interesting specs from the brochure I picked up:

1995 Rialta 21RD

Length:				20'8&quot;
Exterior Height w/roof air	8'4&quot;
Exterior Height w/o roof air	7'5&quot;
Exterior Width			7'4&quot;
Interior Height (max)		6'2&quot; (David's Note: ONLY IN THE DOORWELL!)
Interior Width			6'10.5&quot;
Exterior Storage		4.5 cu. feet
Fuel Capacity			21.1 Gallons
Fresh Water Capacity w/ heater	20 gal
Holding Tank Capacity		19 gal
LP Capacity			28 lbs
GVWR				7,000 lbs (David's Note:  ACK!!!)
GCWR				9,000 lbs
Wheelbase			152&quot;

2.5L Fuel-Injected Gas engine
Electronically controlled Automatic Transmission
280-Amp battery/120 Amp alternator
Optional rear auxiliary air springs
Electrical Control Center:
	110V AC/12V DC, 40 Amp
	Remote Converter/Charger
	AC/DC Circuit Breakers
	30 Amp Power Cord
Furnace: Electronic Ignition, 19,000 BTU
Generator:  3,000 Watt, Gas, w/Hourmeter
Water Heater: 4-Gal., Electric w/Motoraid

This is what they had to say about the engine:

&quot;This is no typical 2.5L engine.  Our VW-designed 2.5L
Exchanges the peak, narrow range of power for a more
optimal power band over a wide range of operation.  This
means Rialta offers increased performance under all
driving conditions, including passing and towing.&quot;

All I have to say about that is... HAH!  :)

There's tons more stuff in this brochure, but I don't have the
stamina to type it in.  Maybe I should mail it to Joel?  :)
