Subject: OK, Everybody now.....

A song that kept running through my head the last couple of
days in anticipation of Friday:

Old MacDonald had a Bus
E I E I O
And on that Bus he had some BALL JOINTS!
E I E I O
With a CLUNK-CLUNK here, and a CLUNK-CLUNK there
Here a CLUNK, there a CLUNK, everywhere a CLUNK-CLUNK.

Old MacDonald had a Bus
VeeWee VeeWee O
And on that Bus he had some CV JOINTS!
VeeWee VeeWee O
With a WHINE-WHINE here, and a WHINE-WHINE there
Here a WHINE, there a WHINE, everywhere a WHINE-WHINE.

Old MacDonald had a Bus
E I E I O
And on that Bus he had a MUFFLER!
E I E I O
With a BANG-BANG here, and a BANG-BANG there
Here a BANG, there a BANG, everywhere a BANG-BANG.

Old MacDonald had a Bus
VeeWee VeeWee O
And on that Bus he had a BATTER TRAY!
VeeWee VeeWee O
With a RUST-RUST here, and a RUST-RUST there
Here a RUST, there a RUST, everywhere a RUST-RUST.

Ad nauseum..

Any other good verses you guys could be singing while
winding down Americas Heartland?
