&gt; also: if you like the wheel covers but don't want to pay the dealer $50
&gt; EACH for them, check the yellow pages of a city near you: there seem to be
&gt; springing up some junkyards dedicated ONLY to hubcaps and wheelcovers. you
&gt; might have to actually go look, however, as the folks that run it don't
&gt; seem to be well versed in vw models. :(

Your dealer must be having a wheel cover sale.  As I posted earlier $71
is the asking price for the mesh wheel cover with the fake lug bolts.
Hub Cap Annie Inc. is a franchise that deals in used/new wheel covers.
The guy here in Raleigh NC was very knowledgable and could order what
ever I wanted.  He showed me his catalog that listed all of the available
VW wheel covers that he had access to.  Seemed quite extensive to me.

&gt; also: if you'd really like new wheel covers, at about half the price, check
&gt; with a Hella dealer. Hella makes wheel covers identical to the vw ones for
&gt; the 1986-1991 vanagons ... but at $100 for a set of four. you can specify
&gt; chrome-plated, or silver-painted, or white-unpainted (so you can spray them
&gt; body-color).

I called Hella a couple months ago with regards to wheel covers and they
no longer carry them.  They were having problems with quality and so they
dropped the product.  That was two months ago, so maybe they have picked
up something else since then.
