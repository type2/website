Subject: Re: Cleavis pin HELP (and adventure of t

  Brandy Smythes's story on clutch cable broken clevis pin reminded me of
my preparation last summer for 10,000 mi trip when van had 150,000 mi
already on original engine and clutch- I prophylactically replaced the
clutch disc and cable, noting the disc still had mm of material before
rivets and cable looked fine- but the clevis pin was worn to about half its
thickness!  So in went the new one with lots of grease........MB in NJ
