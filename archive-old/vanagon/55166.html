Mike:
Possibly an air bubble. The reservoir has a sensor screwed into the top
of it which consists of two metal probes. When the coolant drops below
them it triggers the idiot light. Try bleeding the system. Might as well
practice on this engine. You want to make sure you &quot;got it down&quot; for the
new engine!
Good Luck
