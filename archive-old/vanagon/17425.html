Subject: Re: Add-on Oil Coolers

&gt;
&gt;I'm waiting on a new GEX longblock to come in for my '76 Campmobile and 
&gt;have had (too much?) time to think about some other things I may want to 
&gt;do at this time.
&gt;
&gt;One is add an extra oil cooler.
&gt;
&gt;I do not like the ones I've seen mounted on the outside of the van, but 
&gt;something that would fit in the engine compartment (in corner across from 
&gt;battery?) would be OK.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone running one of these?  How do you like it?
&gt;Anyone want to tell me why this might be a bad idea?
&gt;  I'm sure this is a frequent thread here....
&gt;
&gt;I have never had overheating problems, but want to protect my new 
&gt;investment, and am considering a several month long trip to the west 
&gt;coast that would include time in the desert (NM,AZ).

I have one of these pups on the Frau--there's a small hood on the outside to
direct the air inside, but the rest of the stuff is in the spare battery corner.

I didn't install this--she came with it, and I'm not sure I'd have one
again.  Mainly because the hose connections need to be kept close watch
on--they always seem to want to leak.  And you need to remember when you
last changed them--you can imagine the mess if one burst.  Frau's cooler has
a filter as well, and I do like that.  She's never had any problems with
overheating, but whether that's because of good fortune, perfect maintenance
;) or the cooler, who knows.  (Otto, who has no extra cooler, has never had
overheating problems either.) I've never driven her in a desert climate, or
in mountains rougher than the Appalachians, so take this all fer what you will.
