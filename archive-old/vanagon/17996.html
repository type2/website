Subject: Manassas VA Bugout. Coming?

I hereby offer my services for creating a list of people that
will be attending the Manassas Bugout on May 28th.

If you will be coming, please write me personal e-mail
with your name, expected number, and what VW will be bringing
you. (DOnt worry, if you dont being a VW, we wont laugh...too long)
If you will be wearing something unmissable, make some note
of that. (I will prob. paint or mark something like the mailing
list address on the back of my shirt, or something...)

I will post a synopsis, so we can keep an eye out for 
others while cruizing the lot.

(and there was much rejoicing)
