&gt; Unfortunately, the aircooleds air slowly dying off.  What a lost.
&gt; A whole generation of history slowly rusting into the past. :(

  Never, never will they be completely gone! As long as Thom Fitzpatrick has  
  his MIG welder, as long as Martha has fuzzy flannel &lt;to cover those rusty
  spots&gt;, As long as there is epoxy and fiberglass, as long as those cases
  and heads can be welded back into an approximation of their former selves,
  as long as there are valves to burn, seats to drop, oil to leak, wasserboxers
  to laugh at &lt;and die for&gt;......I learned to drive in a VW bus 25 years ago,
  I really can't imagine driving anything else.
