Subject: E-brake cable + turn signal unit

Guys:

Vehicle: '71 Bus

I failed my safety inspection (for the first time in 11 years!)
for two reasons:

First, and most difficult: The emergency cable on the driver side
works fine, but the one on the passengers side wont bite at all.
What can I do to free up the cable easily? Any quick fixes?
I am not driving it freqently right now, so anything to get
it to work right now should be OK. The adjuster nuts
on the floor are both the same tightness, mabye I just
need to adjust the shoe? (Man, and with a foot of snow around
the parking spot and 11 degrees outside!)

The second is that the turn signal unit is not tightly connected
to the steering shaft any more. (Can you believe they failed me
on that?) The screws that clamp it are stripped, and 
I dont have a spare part. I will look for something to 
rebuild the threads, but what are my chances? Mabye
someone out in net.land can send me just the right
side of that unit, the clamping part??? My high beam
unit is not working either. First I discovered that. Not
much use for it here in the urban jungle. I hope it is
just a burned fuse or pulled off wire. The relays are kinda hard
to find and expensive.

What a bummer!
