The CHP (California Highway Patrol) is randomly pulling vehicles over 
to perform a smog check.  No citation if you violate.  You get a 
readout of results, but cannot substitute for a smog check. Supposedly a 
check to see how the smog test program is working.  However the test 
to meet requirements is different than the one they use for 
evaluation, apples &amp; oranges!  They'll be visiting 138 surface 
streets and do 4300 tests over several months, locations kept 
confidentialof course.

Here's my problem with the way the test is performed.

I observed a standard front wheel drive car.  Drive (front) wheels on 
the dyno.  To provide air to the radiator (to simulate air flow) they 
placed a fan in front of the radiator.

My question -
Has anyone ever had a VW dyno tested?  and if so what 
about the lack of airflow to the engine.  How did they deal with 
that, or was the test short enough to not heat the engine up?  I know 
that my bus relies on travel through the air to provide cooling to 
the engine compartment, as idling raises temperature quickly.
