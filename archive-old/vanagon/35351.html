Sean,

Go back to the dealer and pester the Service Manager for more information.
 Not all dealers have this system installed and those that do are often
unwilling to discuss it but the list has been trying to find a way of
accessing such a system for some time, the object being to have the CD and
software available for remote access.

See if you can get a lead on the dealer's contact, either within VOA or  from
where ever they obtained the disk and software.  Publish the information as a
general post to the list so others can follow it up.

PS -- Remember you're dealing with someone who started life as a used car
dealer.  Take a pretty girl with you.  Have her get naked and dance on his
desk.  It may get his attention.

PPS --  Don't give them any money.

PPPS -- Don't give them my name.

PPPPS --  Give me the girl's phone number.
