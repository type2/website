Subject: Let's Keep Joel Busy, Chapter 2

What about our vehicles pet names?  Shouldn't Joel be keeping a list of
these?  Why not tell your fellow netters your wagen's name?  Unless it's
&quot;Dude&quot;, in which case just keep it to yourself, please.  Does anyone
have a van named &quot;joel&quot;, and if so, is it true that it's built for
comfort, not for speed?

As yet, I haven't named my '84 Vanagon.

Does anyone have one named &quot;Hitler&quot;?  I think it would be great to have a 
Volkswagen named Hitler.

Will
