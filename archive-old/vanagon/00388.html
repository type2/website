&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The last of the real buses were produced in '67.  Everything   
&gt;&gt; without a split window is a shameless imitation.

&gt;Does that mean my '91 is a &quot;Tart&quot; or &quot;Hussey&quot;  ;)

I got to thinkin....if Steven's is a &quot;Tart&quot;, then my Eurovan is
a Slut. Then I realized that the EV would not like being called
a Slut. Instead, I took an axe and split its window...now its
no longer a shameless imitation.
