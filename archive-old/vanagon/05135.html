&gt; &gt;A friend of mine has recently purchased a 1973 bus with a non-Westfalia

&gt; &gt;and we went to Austin VeeDub Salvage and bought a Westy bed for $100.
&gt; 
&gt; $100????  A buddy of mine and I each got westy beds, and we paid $20 (US) 
&gt; apiece!
&gt; 
Ouch!! This bed had been recovered with black and grey apolstery.
What kind of condition were the $20.00 beds in?
