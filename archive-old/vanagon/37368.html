Subject: Re: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus

AHA,

somebody else as well, on the '78 $400 westy from hell the correct
function occurs.  This is the delay position, about a 30 sec fixed
delay.
If it no longer works, I would imagine someone had swapped out a dead
delay relay for a regular older one.  Now what I wonder is if the
commonly
available water pumper variable delay relay will fit the '78 Bus.  When
mom's
passat goes on trade this year, I'll take the relay I bought for her
and find out.
And everybody though I imagined this before.
