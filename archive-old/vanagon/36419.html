I'd suggest calling Parts Place Inc. (Formerly &quot;Recycled Bugs&quot;) in Detroit 
Michigan-  they have a tremendous selection of new and used vanagon parts, will 
give expert free advice over the phone, and will ship ups with credit card 
orders.  Their number is 810-373-2300.  Also ask for their catalog- it is huge 
and packed with vw parts numbers, tech tips and info.

be fine.
