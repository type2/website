Subject: engine substitutions

I can go on at any length about this, since I'm still euphoric over how easily
an amateur (me) got a Porsche six into a Vanagon.  I am working on a very
limited budget, so the engine was a 71 911T 2.2 liter, but the performance
difference is still very rewarding.  Now I'm trying to put together a 2.7
liter engine, figuring that if 125hp is good, 158hp should be better.

There are some tough parts, but absolutely no show-stopper problems in this
conversion.  You have to build a box on the engine cover on the luggage floor
of the Vanagon to accommodate the height of the engine, but the only external
changes to give away that you have extra cylinders are the exhaust (both
appearance and delightful sound) and the oil tank, the bottom five inches or
so of which are visible behind the passenger side right wheel.

I recommend this conversion highly, and will be happy to share details with
anyone interested.
