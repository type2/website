Subject: Late Westys: Remove Your Stove/Sink Lid Latch (&amp; make coffee while driving)

APPLIES TO: Vanagon Westfalias

I have come to the conclusion after long use that there is little reason for
there to be a latch on the big cover that lowers down over the sink/stove
assembly and that this latch should be disabled for ease of access. The
easiest way to do this is to remove the little metal flange to the left to
which the latch grabs a hold. This is a 30 second job and requires only a
screwdriver.

One ease-of-use feature enabled by removing this latch is that it is
possible for the driver to access the sink/stove while driving down the
highway. Last weekend while driving down the New Jersey Turnpike I was able
to fill my water kettle, turn on the propane, light the stove, boil the
water, and make instant coffee in the drivers seat, all while driving down
the highway at 70 miles per hour. I was alone in the vehicle and would have
had to pull over otherwise. 

The purpose of the latch seems to be to hold the stovetop down in the event
of an accident and to keep it from vibrating on the road. But no matter how
bad the road, the unit does not seem to vibrate (due to its weight) even
with the latch removed. Also,  I cannot see what the problem would be if the
stove top were to open in the event the camper went on its side in an
accident. Nobody's head is there.

All camper owners should consider printing out this note and using it as a
reminder to remove the latch next time they get into their campers. Even if
(for some strange reason) it makes you uneasy to make coffee while driving,
removing the latch eases access to the stove/sink area from other positions
in the van too.
