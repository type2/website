&lt;&lt; If I am not mistaken the Audi wheels are the right size bolt pattern

 Europeans to confuse us Yanks. I would not use them on my van because of
 the offset.   &gt;&gt;

Have you used the audi turbo wheels on a Vanagon??  I think not.  I have, and
so have countless others without a problem aside from machining the
centers..35,45..makes no difference.
this thread has been thru the wringer soo many times, and if there was some
safety hazard in running these wheels (which they're isnt) then it woulda
come up already.
what is the offset of MB wheels?
how about any other aftmkt brand?
