Joel wonders:
&gt; what the heck is a muskeg? is that anything like a Rhubarb?
Muskeg is essentially a bog (an old swamp) with lots of peat, moss, 
sedges (reed type plants), and mosquitos.  We have the largest 
reserve of peat in North America.  Don't laugh, someday your next 
prescription will be derived from organics held in the 'muskeg'.  
Also, muskeg is home of the requisite equivalent of the banjo player 
from Deliverance however, they don't go noodlin'.

&gt; &gt;But what do we do if we actually SEE another member?
&gt; 
&gt; why, stop and pass gas, silly! :)
ahhhhh..... (so to speak)
