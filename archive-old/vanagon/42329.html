&gt; the water, how far do you take it in to the water? Surely it can't be 
&gt; good to submerge the engine?

NO!  the anti-freeze leaking from your engine is detrimental to 
aquatic life :)

The solution is to be sure to buy a &quot;roller&quot; trailer so you do not 
have to back in very far to launch or load the boat-- it just pushes 
off easily and cranks up onto the rollers.
