Subject: Re: RE : Gerry Skerbitz's fuel pump problems

Gerry, this will work.You need to place a pressure guage on the fuel feed
line and plug all other lines then apply air to one of the vent lines.If the
fuel feed is leaking it will drop in pressure(you possibly could have another
return or the other vent line leaking but thats the risk...)at least this
will confirm a leak or no leak in the tank thereby avoiding a costly tank
replacement when not ness. I find it hard to swallow that your feed line
could be fractured as this is a one piece line to the pickup,but stranger
things have happened.If you remove your tank and sending unit, you can see
and touch the pickup screen and tube through the top opening, unfortunately
you cannot plug the pickup end w/o cutting an access to the tank or bending
the tube up to the top.Then again...if there is no pressure loss... Are you
sure the return line isnt kinked or clogged/collapsed? This would cause a
pump noise due to a load on the pump....although pressure would increase on
the regulator side(have you checked regulated pressure at the tap point?Let
me know.
