With all this talk about seatbelts/airbags/idiots, did anyone
catch the study done in Virginia recently on the news...
aparently the accident rate for people driving cars with airbags
is 70% higher, or at least for drivers at fault, than drivers
without airbags.

The study concluded that airbags give these drivers a false sense
of confidence, so that they take more risks, etc.

Now my personal bitches regarding other drivers:

1. Friggen Blue hairs who go like a bat out of hell from a side
street onto a main street and then immediately drop from 40 mph
to 5 mph....

2. Godddamned immigrant types (Screw politically correct!) who
let their toddlers stand up on the front seat or have grandma,
grandpa, three aunts and uncles, mom and dad and 5 kids in a 
5 passenger car ALL without seatbelts...

3. Certain groups of people who think lowered clapped-out
Toyota Corolla 1800s with huge stereos are cool...it proves
the old axiom...bitchin stereo....piece of shit car!

4. Idiots who drive on your back bumper with the high beams
on...one cure for this...Osram makes a neat hand held,
self-contained emergency spot light about the size of
a tennis ball...plugs into a lighter...

can you say...full phazers MR. Chekov!! Just take that sucker
in one hand, reach behind your head, and point it out the
back window...and flick the switch!!


5. Real old farts (as opposed to some of us old farts on the
net) who drive in the left hand lane of the interstate at
55...the cure for those types is to pass them and then
immediately cut in front...let them gasp for a bit of air!!
Coronary?? no problem....that's the last time they'll ever
drive on the left again!!


Well thanks for the opportunity to vent!! Its been a shitty coupladays..

wife's in the hospital...and the kids' cat ran away...I guess I shouldn't
have said anything about Nigel in an earlier post... &lt;sigh&gt;

Hey, tomorrow's another day...
