Hi

I'm new to this list and new to Westfalias.  In fact I don't even have one
yet, but I'm hoping to get one this fall.  Does anyone know of a site that
I can get some real basic info about them?  I've been enjoying the posts on
this list, but they are a bit too technical for what I need to know at this
point.

Thanks in advance

Trish
