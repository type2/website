Call me back at 140,000 miles.  From all the reports I've read &amp; experienced,
70,000 miles seems to be near the minimum for the duration it takes for the
corrosion to get bad enought to leak.  While there are exceptions, I'd
venture that about 80% of head leaks occur between 70,000 and 130,000 miles.
 If you get 140,000 or more, I might take you up on that Pgh. water!!
