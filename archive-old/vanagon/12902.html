&gt;I hate to be disagreeable BUT....  not all Splitties are created equally.

ohboy!! a wordfight!! :)  very true, but just as we are all considered
&quot;buses&quot;, most folks consider splits as the same &quot;generation&quot;.

&gt;very significant design changes apart from the obvious &quot;barn door&quot; in the back
&gt;and no overhang/overhead air box in the front...    Just my zwei pfennig

but if we go by that sort of &quot;differences&quot;, then we have at least TWO
generations of vanagons (the air-cooled, vs the water-cooled, with the extra
radiator grill just above the bumper), and perhaps THREE generations (the
air-cooled, the 1.9 liter with old-style sliding door and old-style plumbing,
and the 2.1 liter with new-style sliding door and new engine plumbing).

so, all i'm saying is that we have a different definition of the word
&quot;generation&quot; ... vw considers (according to my sources, anyway) all the
splits to be one &quot;generation&quot;, and all the vanagons to be one &quot;generation&quot;.

within each &quot;generation&quot;, you will have several different &quot;species&quot; ...
differing by engines, cooling vents, and other sometimes-hard-to-see
changes like that. for example, which &quot;species&quot; is a 1971 bus? it has
completely different wheels and front brakes from the 1968-1970 buses ...
but it is externally different from the 1972 bus by it's rear air vents and
taillights.  and the 1973 has different front turn signals and bigger brakes.

so you seem to be saying that a &quot;generation&quot; is a fact of technical
&quot;improvement&quot;, whereas i am saying that it is a grouping of commonality.

doesn't really matter ... just kinda confuses the newbies. ;) as long as
we talk about the year and model, i think everybody can follow along.

besides ... i still am kinda pissed that the breadloafs and vanagons can't
have Safari front windshields!! :)
