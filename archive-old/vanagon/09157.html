&gt;&gt; The 1700 type IV engine has almost reached a state of maximum entropy in my
&gt;&gt; basement but I am having trouble splitting the case.  All the bolts are
&gt;&gt; out, so I assume it is just the 20 year old gasket/sealant holding the case
&gt;&gt; together.  Is there an easy way to split the case without resorting to
&gt;&gt; potentially destructive measures?

&gt; Are you absolutely *sure* you have all of the bolts out?  How about the
&gt; nuts?  I thought I was sure, but there are a couple that are very well
&gt; hidden.  If you have all of the hardware off, and if the case was sealed
&gt; with the proper stuff when it was assembled, it should come apart easily.
Here I go with one of those &quot;me too, what he said!&quot; posts that seem to
irritate some people.  But I agree with David:  If you have all the nuts
and bolts off it should come apart easily.  I had the same trouble with a
2000 case.  There are some that are pretty much hidden.  I think there were
one or two that were kind of in a &quot;hole&quot; in the case, such that you had to
use a socket on a long extension.  I called a VW mechanic for advice when
I couldn't get the case apart and he said &quot;check again.&quot;  He was right.
