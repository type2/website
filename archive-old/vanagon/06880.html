my impression of an 80 rabbit diesel with two large bubbas in it was that
it was a very peppy car, especially considering atlanta, ga, traffic. there
was a very horrific downside to the car, however: you had to fill up the
fuel tank EVERY month!!! :)

one must remember that Ph.D. degrees are not necessarily handed out to the
most intelligent of our species.  more often, they are conferred upon those
who are the most tenacious and obnoxious of spirit and manner ... oh, a few
smart ones get by, now and then, but around this state (which are my only
real reference points), Ph.D. stands for 'Piled Higher and Deeper'. :)  it's
understood that the holders of said degrees WOULD have become lawyers, but
they just didn't have that &quot;killer instinct&quot;.  ;)

no offense intended to those out there who actually EARNED their degrees
(rather than politic-ed into them, as is often the case down here).
