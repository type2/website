Subject: Re: Clutch - German/Brazilian???


A call to RMMW last week revealed that the clutch parts they sell are
Sachs Brazilian.  Others have said to get German parts where they are
available.  I will let you know how my Brazilian ones hold up.  Jim

Sachs makes VW parts in BRAZIL???

Hmmm... the V6anagon's PO and I have put two Sachs clutches in it in the
last 6 months, 6,000 miles. The first of these, had &quot;Made in Germany&quot;
engraved on it in various places. I didn't check the second-- box and
packaging look the same, brand was the same, etc.

Hmmm...

World Parts Depot sure had low prices on those things.
