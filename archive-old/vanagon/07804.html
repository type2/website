&gt; Please Dave, don't ban me from the vanagon list. I depend on it to keep up my
&gt; vanagons to give me rides and it is too important for me. 

Oh jeez David, I was only kidding!  That's why I put the smiley (tm) after
that line.  You know about smileys, right?  Anyway, I cannot (and would not)
ban anyone from this list - only Gerry could do that, and if he hasn't
banned Ric, he probably won't ban anyone.  =)

The fact that you own at least one Vanagon *and* you have a cool name
makes you an okay guy in my book, no matter what you believe about
cooling flaps and thermostats.
