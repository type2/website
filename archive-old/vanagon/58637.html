&lt;&lt;  One more thought, a set of the folding 
 weekender middle seats would really improve access to the rear seats 
 for someone trying to dual purpose the Westy as a daily kid hauler,  &gt;&gt;

Another idea for someone wanting just one extra seat, would be to use the
rear-facing theater style removeable/flip up jumpseats out of a '87 up Wolfs.
Ed or Carat 7 pass. and mount it behind the pass seat in a westy.
Easy to put in/ take out, and they have seatbelts attached to the hardware.

these only came in grey velour, tho you could always re-upholster since the
seatcovers are the same as the front seats. (get a spare front seat and use
the cover off it)
