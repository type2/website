Subject: Re: Puddles inside the bus

&gt; It rained last night and when I hopped into the '74 this morning I noticed
&gt; a puddle of water on the floor in front on the passengers side. Window open?
&gt; Nope. Went looking around on the outside and found - Yikes! - RUST UNDER THE
&gt; WINDSHIELD!! This must be the result of bad karma from having given Sami so
&gt; much grief about driving in the salt of Missouri. But seriously, what has to
&gt; be done to fix this? Does new metal need to be welded in? Has anybody on the
&gt; list made this repair?
&gt;
&gt; Unhappily realizing that the years are indeed passing by for &quot;Young Fred&quot;
&gt;

Sounds as if it's time to replace the windshield seal &amp; fix the rust that's
probably all over the place underneath.  (Other seals may be bad too--poke
around a little)  I had this same problem on the Camper (Frau Blucher) and
from various horror stories I'd heard about removing the windshield
oneself, I had a body shop do the seal &amp; fix the rust, which was extensive.
$300+ a bit if memory serves correctly.  If you don't catch this it can
turn into a real mess, with the metal shot &amp; water leaking between the
layers of the glass, turning it milky around the edges.
