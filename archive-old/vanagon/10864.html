&gt;      ps, Hmm I've been thinking if I take the heater cable off the heater 
&gt;      boxes and attach it to a piece of Uranium then fix another piece of 
&gt;      Uranimum to the floor inside the bus. Then turning the heater control 
&gt;      would bring the two pieces of Uranium together. You could adjust the 
&gt;      amout of heat produced by screwing the nob in or out. Oh, and remember 
&gt;      to adjust the cable so that the Uranium pieces don't touch! Than have 
&gt;      a little fan blowing the hot air onto your body - yum nice and warm.
&gt;      Can anyone see any flaw/drawbacks in this seemingly easy way to heat 
&gt;      your bus?? ;-)

Sounds like a good idea. Does this mean you could use cold fusion 
during the summer for cooling? ;-)
