Subject: Vanagon heater fan

Does anyone have experience replacing the front heater fan in a vanagon.
I have had two 85's that the fan works erratically. Dash removal does
not sound like much fun. I have been avoiding it for several years, but
now it is time. Tips and parts locations would be appreciated.

If anyone wants to convert a dog automatic to manual, I did it with
great success

Thanks
Bryan
