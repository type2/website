I used the 3M Weather-strip adhesive.  Make sure the drain tubes are clear.  
This is the usual cause of these things leaking.

I have an '85 Weekender. The sunroof leaks. Before I tape the seam up, I'd
like to try replacing the gasket.

I bought replacement gasket material from a dealer.

What adhesive did you use? 

Any tricks?

Thanks for any help.
