&gt;I drive a Toyota Starlet now (sorry to admit it!!!) and it goes fast on
&gt;the freeway.  I'm not defending passing on the right mind you.

Why not? I do, when it's the only available lane.


&gt;But, I speed on long trips in order to maintain my alterness.

I guess you meant &quot;alertness&quot;, right? 'Less you're into Krishna
conciousness...   ;)

Personally, I speed on long trips to get there faster. If it keeps me
more alert, so much the better.



&gt;Sometimes the big picture says &quot;pass on the
&gt;right&quot;, especially when someone is tooling along in the middle lane.
&gt;Again, I'm not defending my actions.  They are ethically wrong

Uh, no they're not. What on earth are you talking about? I know, the
left lane is &quot;the fast lane&quot; and the rightmost is &quot;the slow lane&quot;
(where, incidentally, all upright-fan buses should stay unless actually
passing someone-- a rare event!).

But if some airbrain is doing 55 in the leftmost lane, and the right
lane(s) are clear, then the only choice is to pass him on the right.
Unless, of course, you self-appoint yourself Driving Instructor for
a Day, and sit behind Dweeb-o flashing your lights-- a typical tactic
of a chronic victim.

Personally, that's not what I'm on the road at that particular time and
place for-- I'm trying to get somewhere, not give driving lessons to
persons who haven't even benefitted from the ones they got in school. I
arrived at that conclusion after noticing that the &quot;lessons&quot; are usually
ignored, and sometimes even provoke adverse reactions-- undesirable
results in any case. If swooshing by on their right, doesn't arouse
some spark of comprehension in their dim brains, then nothing else
will either.

I *never* drive my bus in the leftmost lane, unless ALL the right lanes
are poking along and the leftmost is CLEAR. In which case I pull into the
left lane, pass the group, and get back over immediately. Someone will
probably come along soon, going faster than me, and wanting to get by the
same group. It *is* &quot;ethically wrong&quot; IMHO, for me to block the only
available lane by staying in it any longer than absolutely necessary.

&gt;and I
&gt;apologize to all the slowpokes young and old I might have offended and
&gt;raised the anxiety of.  I'm sorry...

Hee hee... don'cha love it... I'm sooooo sorry too.... idiots.


&gt;&gt; Case Study:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On the trip down there, on Hwy 80, going about 70 in the middle lane,
&gt;&gt; several people would zoom up from behind in the #1 lane, slide over 2
&gt;lanes,
&gt;&gt; pass me, and then zoom back to the #1 lane.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; C'mon - be a MAN - pass on the LEFT!

Why do you care?
But if for some reason you do care, YOU move over to the right!

&quot;KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS&quot; -- age-old wisdom. Learn it, live it, love it.
