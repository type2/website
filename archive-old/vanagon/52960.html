Subject: how to perform a leak down???

hi all 

got another question. can i perform a leak down test? i was checking out my
compression tester this past weekend and notice that it disconnects from the
gauge and leaves me with a hose with a fitting at each end one screws into
the spark plug hole and the other has a male air fitting that i could hook
my air compressor to. is this enough stuff to do one?  what would the
pressure be regulated to in p.s.i.? i understand that the cylinder must be
at top dead and that i check to see where the air is escaping to. but are
there any precautions or problems that i should be aware of to perform such
a task? must the motor be run for the day and then checked or on a cold
motor? sorry if i ask alot of questions. i just like to have all the answers
before i run into more questions. thanks Jonce
