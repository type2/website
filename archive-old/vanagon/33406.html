Subject: moving to california emissions?
Date: Monday, January 22, 1996 1:21PM

There is a chance i may be moving to California in the next 3 to 5
years.  i was wondering what it takes to get a vehicle californeized.
Should i just forget about my '72 bus and find another when i get
there or is there a chance that this original detroit smog machine is
saveable?  The engine and carbs are original but is any extra
equipment required?  How about my '76 cutlass? that thing is just a
body, engine, and carb.  while constructing this beast my whole
philosophy has just been &quot;make it go faster&quot;.  my cars have always
been old enough to be exempt from the now completely defunct michigan
emissions laws so not a single one of em has any polution controlls
at all.  If california has those nasty safety inspections some states
have i may as well forget the whole thing.
thanks.
Ed.
