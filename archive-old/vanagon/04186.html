&gt; I read in VW Trends that there will be a Bus &amp; Bug in south central Indiana
&gt; this weekend.  I'd love to go, but have familial commitments and won't make
&gt; it.  Is anyone out there planning on going?  I saw from the survey that
&gt; there are a few other folks from Indiana, and would love to get a report.
It's Sunday at the Big Lots store in Bloomington and is sponsored by the
Central Indiana Volks Folks.  Many show classes, free swap area, car for sale
area, etc.  I'd probably be going, but I'm on my way to Cleveland this
weekend to scavange a few needed odds and ends from Bill Claspy's '71 parts
bus before it's off to the bone yard.  :-)
 
&gt; I just bought my first VW Bus about 3 weeks ago, and have begun the bonding
&gt; (not bondo!) process.  It's a 1979 Westphalia Camper, &quot;sage green&quot;
&gt; exterior.  Question:  What was the original color of the bumpers on this
&gt; model?
The bumpers on the ex-girlfriend's '78 non-camper were kind of a flat white,
but I don't know the factory name or whatever.
 
&gt; Just wondering, as I'd like to restore it to as-near-to-showroom-condition-
&gt; as-is-economically-feasible.
I hear you.  That's the route I'm trying to take with my Westy, too.
 
&gt; I've been quoted around $1,200 for a some minor body work (rust around the
&gt; lower perimeter) and paint job.  Does that sound about right?
Does to me, but of course prices vary.  I'd shop around before making a
decision.  A good rule of thumb is to take it to several places, throw out
the high and low estimates and pick one in the middle from someone you feel
comfortable with.  That's what we did with her bus.  Had a BIG dent square
in the driver's side, very slightly bent frame, rusted door steps, and a few
other minor rust spots and dings.  And it needed to be painted inside and
out, two tone.  Estimates ranged from $400 (old man working out of his
garage) to over $6,000 (an ultra-sano, white-tile-floored-estimating-room,
estimator-wears-a-suit, here's-your-two-and-a-half-page-computer-printout-
estimate-sir place).  A lot of places wouldn't do rust, more just late model
dents where they could easily get panels and weld them in.  Ended up spending
$3,200 to a guy that specializes in old car restos. and it looks nice.  So
nice in fact that I had him do my '71 without shopping around again.  $2,200
for two tone, inside/outside job with a few dings and not much rust and no
giant side dent.
 
&gt; Look forward to hearing from any other Indiana (I'm in Ft. Wayne) VW
&gt; enthusiasts, so I can get up to speed on the ups-and-downs of ownership,
&gt; etc.
Welcome to the list from another Hoosier!
