Subject: vent/lever Q


OK, I know we've brought this up before, but new material has
since been learned, and so it's time to go at it again.  I think
this pertains mostly to those of us with '80-'83 aircooled vanagons
and westies, but may apply to others as well.  After comparing my
'81 westy with others, we notice a discrepance in the number of
levers to operate the climate control.  The guess is that:

cars with AC have 3 levers, looking like the lower 4th lever is missing
cars with no AC have 4 levers

Now, even if this is true, it still doesn't explain why some of us
have hot air blowing ALL THE TIME (no matter what) from the side vent
defrosters, or cold air blowing ALL THE TIME from the front defoggers.

Does anyone have a magical answer about all of this?
