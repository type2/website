Subject: How tall is a Westy????

Well, just taking care of the last minute details about getting back my '82 
Westy from Orlando. I'll be on the Amtrak Auto-train from Orlando to 
Washington,DC. Amtrak is telling me that the max height of the van can be no 
more than 85&quot;. Do you think it will fit? Anyone feel like measuring theirs?
Not you Synchro guys with the big BFG T/A's, though!!  :)  Thanks!

Just want to make sure I don't scrape the top in the train!
