Subject: Comissioning/commiserating/co-misse-berating party

	Ok, enough shilly-shallying around. I've been using up
bandwidth talking about my someday working '70 pickup (Little Martha)
long enough.  My beloved brother and I are going to give it full effort the
weekend of December 9-10. No band-rehearsals, Odessey of the Mind
coaching or other distractions. 

	With any luck, we'll get electrical system comissioned, 
the engine + tranny in, axles connected, start it and drive it by the end
of Sunday. Or something will go wrong and it won't work, which will
NOT reflect on the quality of help recieved. If it all goes perfectly,
you can marvel at how the Zymol makes it shine :)

	In any event, there will be pizza at 6:00pm, Sunday evening.

	Anyone who wants to come by to see/watch/help/laugh/supervise
or marvel at how long I've been milking this job is welcome. Anyone who
wants to help and can arrive earlier will certianly be appreciated and
I bet we can find something for you to do. Pictures will be taken!

	4660 Westmont Avenue
	Campbell, CA 95008-5830
	408 374 8073

	How to get there:

	X marks the spot, across the street from the Westmont High School
parking lot. My house is on the corner of a little cul-de-sac that doesn't
have its own name. London Drive is the closest cross street. My house
is white, with a calico roof (to match the cat) and will have a Lotus
White 1970 VW Pickup parked in the driveway, natch.

		MY HOUSE!  4660 Westmont Avenue


	From Highway 880 (going South) or 17 (going North)

	Get off at Camden/San Tomas Expressway, get on San Tomas, take
Winchester Blvd South exit from San Tomas Expwy. Hacienda is the 2nd
light after you get on Winchester, turn right, go 1 mile to San Tomas
Aquino Road (2nd stop sign) Turn right, go 1/4 mile or so to Westmont Ave, 
(first stop sign) turn left. 2/3 mile up Westmont is a stop sign, and the
road narrows. When it widens again, look for my house on the left, just
after the white fence. If you come to a second stop sign on Westmont, 
you've gone too far. 

	From 280

	Get off at Lawrence Expressway or Saratoga Avenue, depending on
which direction you're coming from. head for Saratoga/Los Gatos. 
Lawrence becomes Quito road when it crosses Saratoga Blvd. Stay on it,
or turn left as required. Westmont is at the second light, about 1 mile 
from the Saratoga Blvd/Lawrence-Quite intersection. 
	At the light, the right turn is Sousa, the left is Westmont. 
My house is about 2/3 mile down Westmont, just before it gets narrow 
(2 lanes, no parking). You'll pass London drive just before my
cul-de-sac. If you come to a scond stop sign on Westmont, 
you've gone too far.
