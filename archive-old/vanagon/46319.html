&gt; We are pretty sure we will get the Yokohama Y370 tires however we still 
&gt; have a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; are these highway all season or all terain?
Mine are rated M&amp;S, not A/T, so I guess they are All season. They 
*are* a bit noisier than the passenger tires I replaced, but the 
difference in handling makes up for that.

 &gt; is the C rating alright or should we 
get the D rating? &gt; 
The shop I went to had the D in stock since he did a lot of buses.
The C should be fine I guess, but I'd opt for the D if you can.

&gt; what is a reasonable price for these?
I paid $108 (less $28 for trade in of near new el crapo tires). This 
is in CDN $, but for comparison, Conti reinf 185R14 were $104, and 
Michelin LTX were about the same.

 &gt; what is the mileage warranty?
Didn't check - I don't pay much attention to this since it's like a 
battery warranty - prorated. ie: If an $80 tire wears out at 60,000 
on an 80k warranty, they'll only give you $20 towards new ones.

 &gt; are these good with fuel consumption?
i can't compare with anything else, but I got from 21-24 mpg on our 
last trip to Ca &amp; back, driving mainly curvy steep roads (US 1 &amp; 
101). Since they are good to 65 psi, you can run them hard on the 
highway which should improve mileage.

 &gt; are these good for long road trips?
Yes. No problems in 5000km over 2 weeks. I drive a lot of rough roads 
and feel comfortable with the extra load rating and durability also. 
Sharp rocks have marked up my Conti's, but don't seem to affect the 
Yokos.

  &gt; are they noisy?
as noted, they are a bit noisier than the soft car tires I had, but 
it's barely above the wind noise at 60 mph.
