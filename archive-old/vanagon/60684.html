Subject: Buses on the Blue Ridge

I can not leave until early Sat morning.  Does anyone want to canivan
over  to NC from Knoxville TN around 7:00am. Contact me I can alter me
time by an hour or two either way.  I really hate I will miss the
drive-in movie on Friday night.  Please take some pictures of 80 Buses
watching a movie.
