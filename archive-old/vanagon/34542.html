Subject: Re: Intake Questions on a '74


&gt;Today I was looking at my bus (1974, non-FI) and noticed some weird 
&gt;things in the airscoops.  There seems to be some metal tubing that comes 
&gt;up out of the engine, bends and heads back down into the engine 
&gt;compartment.  This tubing is about 1/4&quot; in diameter, and at the top there 

It's the breather pipe for the fuel tank. It always looked a bit
over-complicated to me.
