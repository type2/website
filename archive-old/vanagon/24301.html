Ok, I did some more research on the Bus from Gopher and through everyones 
great help here.  Still can find all the info I need.

Info recorded from the two plaques and sticker:

VOLKSWAGENWERK AG

Typ 22
 Heizg Typ   2/255 APrute ~ S45 - What is this?
 Fargest-Nr. 226163526 - Someone said this was the VIN others say it is
 the chassis number.  If it is chassis number it starts with the 1?

If anyone can fill these gaps it would be greatly appreciated.
