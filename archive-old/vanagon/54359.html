&lt;&lt; I am a proud owner of a VW type II
from 1956 (Bus).  I am thinking of
swapping in a chevrolete 6 cylinder
engine in the middle =  of the bus........ &gt;&gt;

Tom: 

Right on.  

Try the folks using the &quot;VW air-cooled&quot;
news group. I am shure they will  gladly
share  past experiences doing similar
conversions and provide all kinds of help
and technical information. You may find
a member of the news group willing to
help. 

Sounds like an exciting project.

Post your street address and I'm shure a
few &quot;vw-water cooled&quot; news group
members will drop by your house. 

You will likely want to install:
seal-skin seat covers;
leopard-skin floor mats; 
a whale-bone shifter knob; and,
2 nucular war heads (small ones) as side
view mirrors.

Warning don't tell the folks in the
&quot;vw-water cooled&quot; news group  about the
war heads...they may wish to install
these in another  location... and that
location will not be on the bus nor will
that location be visiable to you (ouch!!).

Good Luck With The Project
