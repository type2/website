&gt;That's exactly why I sorta suggested the flannel strip tied to the &gt;antenna,
although I did get a good chuckle out of Dave's prune label &gt;suggestion.
&gt;We ARE a unique group and stickers are all to common.  C'mon you folks,
&gt;there's gotta be other ideas!?


How about this?:

1)  a big VW logo with a caricature of Otto Bahn (you know, the stick
figure guy) with a PRUNE for a head superimposed over the VW logo.

2)  skewer a prune on the antenna and attach a strip of flannel below
it ala Baron von Prune.  Ain't nobody gonna be doing that who ain't a
listmember!
