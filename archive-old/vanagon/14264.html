Subject: RE: redrock video viewing!

I have a 9&quot; color tv, with built-in video cassette player, which I
can run off AC, or the cig lighter (if Burdley will ever finish
fixing it!!!!).  Anyway, i'd be happy to meet at the 9th
for the swap, and we can watch it in who ever's van.  Jon,
could you send us some specs on location, directions, time,
etc. for the whole group?

We could still do a potluck if you like...
