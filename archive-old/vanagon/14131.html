Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome

 

***  Also, I'm trying tho clean the headliner the best I can.  I've used foam
upholstry cleaners, and simple green.  My headliner was installed new in '87
and has upheld very good, but I am trying to find something that will bring
a brighter white back.  Any ideas on cleaners that are good in lifting dirt
would be helpful.


If you don't leave it on too long (and don't get it on your hands... yuck!) I've 
used Super Clean by Castrol with great success.  I've used it to clean up the 
material for the interior panels before putting 'em on new board, I've used it 
for part of my headliner, and more.  It's good stuff, but if you don't get all 
of it off it will start to do damage.  It can even take off paint if it's on 
long enough.

Brendan, sorry I missed you this weekend.  I tried calling around 4 on Saturday, 
but you were already gone.  Talk to you later.

Aaron
