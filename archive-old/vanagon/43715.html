&gt;  One interesting thing today here in the State of Minnesota.  We have a
&gt;liberal U.S. Senator here by the name of Wellstone.  The Republicans, in an
effort to
&gt;embarrass him plan on following him around in a '67 VW Bus.  They claim the
&gt;Bus is supposed to represent the obsolete liberal past.  I saw the thing on
TV
&gt;and it looked nice.  I mean the thing is damn near 30 years old and it still
goes
&gt;good.  Looks cool too.   Maybe I just didn't get it.  See ya all on the road
&gt;in a year or two.

I haven't seen it on TV, yet, but there is a color picture of it in today's
Saint Paul Pioneer Press.

P.S.
Senator Welfare is the conservative name for Welstone.
