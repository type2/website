Subject: just an observation

        Has anyone else ever noticed that the inside pattern of an Oreo
cookie is just like the VW logo. Does VW own stock in Mr.Christie or vice
versa?
        And no, I am not one of those poeple who sees the head of Jean
Chretien in a Safeway potato, or the face of jesus in a sheet of toilet
paper.

happy happy joy joy.
