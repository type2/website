Subject: Wife's bug running hot
Date: Wed, 17 May 95 17:04:17 PDT

 I think it was Jason who posted this and didn't get much of a response:
 &lt;being a &quot;digester&quot; I often don't get to this stuff 'til late&gt;

 questions

 1) why wont she idle
 2) why is she hot
 Please this is a serious plea for help

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The combination of these two symptoms makes me think &quot;vacuum leak&quot;! First 
  place I'd check is those rubber boots where the steel part of the intake
  manifold connects to the cast aluminum part. Those puppies can crack and
  create a leak which will trash your idle and lean out your mixture enough
  to make it run hot. Loose connections, busted hoses elsewhere in the
  induction path are suspect too. I'm assuming that you have already 
  checked the easy stuff &lt;dwell, timing, etc.&gt;.

  Maybe someone with more experience with the upright fan motor can give 
  some better advice?

  Good Luck, 

  Dave
