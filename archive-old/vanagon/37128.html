&gt; Hi Everyone.  As we are getting the van ready ready for camping 
&gt; season, my wife asked if we should wash our top bunk cushions.  Since 
&gt; the inside of the cushions are lined with a foam-type material, I was 
&gt; wondering if washing would be wise.

we bought our '87 from a smoker   :(
thoroughly washed everything in the van, including the *covers* but 
not the foam itself.

on our '87, it has that greyish, checked/striped velourish stuff.  
the covers unzip off the foam pads and wash up VERY well.  warm water 
with a mild detergent.  i think i air-dried them instead of tumble 
dry.  anyway. they did not seem to shrink or fade.  installing the 
covers over the foam is a bit like wrestling a drunk bear but they do 
go back on.

i don't know about the foam itself... do dry cleaning places do that?
