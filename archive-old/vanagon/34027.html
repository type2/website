&gt; Dear VWers,

&gt; I am considering to replace a panel on my 80 vanagon. This panel goes
&gt; from the roof to the bumper on the driver side nose of the car. It is
&gt; just left of the front left head light.

Vahid, you are a brave one!  I don't have my Vanagon right
in front of me (won't fit in the office), but I think I
understand the piece you are talking about.  No, I have not
done anything similar, but it would seem to be a
particularly difficult area to work on because of all of the
pieces involved (under the dash and behind the nose).

&gt; Any info on how to take the old one off?

Removal of that would seem to involve a LOT of precise metal
cutting and then grinding the surfaces clean of all old
metal before fitting the new piece.

&gt; Any tips on how to put the new one in?

Without a good mental picture in my mind of all the places
that piece would need to be welded into place, it's hard to
provide any advice.  A recent issue (or two) of DB&amp;HVWs had
a series on removal and replacement of a rear quarter panel
on an older bus.  There would be some similarities involved
in the work you propose.

&gt; Are there any books on this stuff?

There are books on body removal and replacement and there
are books on VWs.  The only book I've seen on VW body work
was worthless.  Someone else on the list did find a
reasonably good book (I think), but I'm not sure about the
name or author.

&gt; Appreciated &amp; Regards,
&gt; Vahid

You don't say much about how familiar you are with removal
or replacement of body panels.  If this is your first, you
may want to let a professional do it.  That is, if you can
afford the cost.  There are other areas of the Vanagon, and
other vehicles, which are much more straight-forward than
the nose to learn on.

You also don't say *why* you want to do this.  Is the area
smashed in?  If it is smashed, that area would also impact
the operation of the door and the damage may have gone all
the way to the back of the door and its jamb.  If it is
intact, it might be fixed by just *pulling* it back out.
Body shops have hydraulic straighteners for such work which
simplify it.

If some of that piece is rusted pretty badly, you may be
better off just removing the rusted area and welding in a
patch.  In the DB&amp;HVWs article I referenced above, they only
replaced the lower rear quarter panel because the upper half
was still good.  Even that approach takes a lot of work.

Either way, I wish you good luck.  Let us know how it turns
out.
