Subject: Re: Beck Spyder Web Page

&gt;Hi volks,
&gt;For those interested in the VW powered Beck Spyder kit car, I have put
&gt;together a web page.
&gt;
&gt;http://www.sky_dot_net/~bpolys
&gt;
&gt;Click on the GIFs to see the car.

For those interested in talking to someone who built one of these lovelies,
I'm your guy! Mine even has IRS and a worked 2180cc.
