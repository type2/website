&gt;I just had a 74 Bug I'm thinking of buying checked out.
&gt;
&gt;The mechanic says it needs:
&gt;
&gt;	back up light repair	$32
&gt;	brake pedal sticking	$72
&gt;	muffler		$160
&gt;	engine seal		$40
&gt;	alternator belt	$22
&gt;	shift coupler/bushing	$100
&gt;
&gt;He says the compression checks out at 135, 150, 130, 110.
&gt;
&gt;The owner is asking $1650.
&gt;
Some of those prices seem way high.  Look around fand price them to make
sure.  $22 for a belt??  It'll take YOU 5 minutes to put it on, and you
should pay less than $5 for it.  The belt for my 911 cost $5 from the
Posche shop!

What exactly are they going to do for &quot;backup light repair&quot;?  or &quot;brake
pedal sticking?&quot;  

The only repair thats anywhere near difficult is the engine seal, but
that too can be conquered with some careful, methodical work.

I say take at least the cost of the repairs off the price, and do them
yerself!
