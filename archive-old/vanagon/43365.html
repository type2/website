Subject: Lunacy and gratitude

First, let me thank everyone who responded to my woes about a leaking bus.

Second, let me just say that I think we're all complete lunatics,
especially those of us who have chosen nothing but older VWs to get us
around.

I had a perfectly good running Toyata 4wd pickup.  Really nice, lo miles,
no dents or rust, worked great.

Then I had Maggie, a 76 westy, running, with problems and rust and stuff.

So I needed a computer for school, hit my parents up for the bread, $2300.
It came time to pay them back, and they wanted me to sell Maggie (then
sitting in their driveway, much to the dismay of the neighbors) to pay em
back.  I'm thinking, OK.  I love her, but I can't really devote the time
she needs, I'll find her a good home.

I had barely gotten her out of my parents driveway heading home when I
realized, no way, I can't let the old girl go.  She's too good.  So I'm
heading down the highway, tranny fluid and oil gushing, rust accelerating,
crosswinds blowing her about, even grey haired granny's passing me on the
interstate, get back, sell the truck.  And I couldn't be happier.  Am I a
lunatic or what?

Eric
