&gt;I just took off the right stub axle on my '71 van.  I am replacing a cv 
&gt;boot.  I noticed that the cv joint that connects to the wheel has the 
&gt;black grease in it but the other one (transmission side) has oil in the 
&gt;cv joint, in fact about a half cup leaked out when I removed it.  Is this 
&gt;normal?  Whats up with the oil instead of grease?

What you see there is a mix of gear oil and CV grease.  Take a look see
inside the drive flange the CV Joint sits in.  There should be a hard rubber
cap in the center that prevents trans gear oil from getting out and dust/dirt
from getting into the differential.  If the cap is ripped, gear oil will seep
through.  While you have the CV's apart, replace the cap (VW P/N 002-517-289A
- about $4).  While you're at it, check the final drive seal that the flange
rides on as well for any damage/leaking.  Replace if also bad (VW P/N
002-301-189C - about $8).

Clean the CV and repack with the appropriate grease and put it back together
for another 30,000 miles.

Keep 'em runnin' :)
