&gt;         So, would everyone who wants to please send me directly the year 
&gt; (and month if possible) of their vanagon wasserboxer and the mileage 
&gt; currently on the chassis. If you have had serious motor work that involved 
&gt; replacement of the engine or say pistons/main bearings, could you indicate 

Hi Tim.  We could compile quite a database of statistics here!  This 
is great.  Here's my contribution;

1990 Syncro Westy.  Date of manufacture Dec/89.  Currently has 
112,000 km.  Only problem to date was with engine waterpumps.
Original went at 3500 km, May/90.  Just blew the second pump at 
109,000 km, Sept/94.  Burns almost zero oil.  Last compression check 
I had was Sept/93 _at_ 96000 km... even _at_ 140 psi.  

Harry.
