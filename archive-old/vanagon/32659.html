&gt; My options seem to be going for 195/75,

&gt;too thrilled about the 215's since they will throw the speedo out
&gt;of whack (larger diameter).. (also, would they fit the in
&gt;the spare weel compartment?)
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions or comments? What are you fellow vanagon/syncronauts
&gt;running?

I am very pleased with the BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain tires in the
LT27-8.5-14 size.  I was worried about extra tire noise, however I was
relieved that it was a very minimal increase.  I was also very pleased that
this increased tire size corrected my odometer reading to be within about
0.5% (that's one half of one percent) of the odometer check signs on the
highway.  With the 205/70 size tires, it was considerably over-reporting
speed &amp; mileage.  If you do change the size though, remember to by 5 tires so
the spare will be identical to the rest.
