&gt;Funny you should ask:
&gt;
&gt;My 1980 Westy was an &quot;L&quot;, and my 93 EV is a &quot;GL&quot;.  Bottom line is:  &quot;Sh*t
&gt;if I know!&quot;  Based on my experiences with the EV, I've just assumed that GL
&gt;stands for &quot;Good Lord!&quot; or &quot;Grand Larceny!&quot; or something like that.

Hi...

I had several people from the list respond and though I would pass the
scoop on to you as given to me by one of them (the others agreed with
him).

The below is clipped from email send to me...
&gt;I also have an '85 GL and was told by the Local dealer that the 
&gt;only difference seems to be Interior trim ie: cloth (velour) seats and 
&gt;the fold-down rear seat, they also said most GLs came with at least one 
&gt;A/C unit and some came with front and rear A/C... oh and most had the 
&gt;full plastic hubcaps...
and from another...
&gt;Basically, it indicates a higher level of trim.  You have caroeted floors
&gt;instead if rubber mats,  velour or cloth seats instead of vinyl, and all the
&gt;metal inside the van is covered with headliner type material, etc.  GL does
&gt;not indicate any improvements in the drive train unfortunately.  In 85, you
&gt;should have a tachometer and power steering as part of the GL package.

Just thought you might like to know.
