Earlier, Dan, Dave, and Joel were tryin' to figgur out axels:

&gt; &gt;  Joel, you've actually swapped them, right? What did you figger?
&gt; 
&gt; well ... cause it seemed like a good idea at the time. :)
&gt; actually, i'm wondering if it will make any difference. there was No Clear
&gt; Consensus from the list (or anywhere else), so i'm gonna see if they last
&gt; another 75,000 miles this way. if they do, it doesn't prove anything. but
&gt; if they tear up, i'm sure gonna suspect something!!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; i'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, by reversing the axles, that the balls
&gt; will move into new wear areas of the races ... and so maybe last longer
&gt; (instead of wearing the old paths even deeper). no basis in science or
&gt; history supports this claim, however.
&gt;
I won't claim omnipotent knowledge in this area.  The dealer I took 
mine to swapped end-for-end for the exact reason stated above.  I 
dunno, maybe we should just buy new Toyotas (oh, settle down-- I 
kidding)
