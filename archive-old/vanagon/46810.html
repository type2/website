Subject: shift rod bushing lubricant


Starbrite makes a teflon based lubricant for trailer hitches called, 
oddly, &quot;Trailer Hitch Lubricant&quot; that works very well for the shift 
rod bushings.

It is a translucent white, shiny goo that the manufacturer claims is
impervious to water, road salt, and slow possums.  I have used it
for the last 500 miles and i'm all smiles so far.  it comes in a
handy 4 ounce (or so) screw-top jar that is easy to store in the
van, because like anything else, it don't last forever.
