&gt; I need two cup holders for my '87 Vanagon.  These are the &quot;Flip-Flop&quot; square
&gt; version.   Any color is okay (blue if possible)  I know it is a small item
&gt; but I have kids and want to keep the interior as free as possible from spilt
&gt; drinks.  Think of me next time you go to the salvage yard.  TIA

Me too! Where do these fit? I've never seen stock cupholders and was 
about to buy some that clip on the window ledge. I'd rather have 
stock if I can find them.
