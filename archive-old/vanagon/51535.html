Subject: Tire update on Yokohama Y370G
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 17:14:54 -0500 ()

I purchases a used Vanagon Camper with Michelin MXL tires which needed 
replacing. After reading the list archives, talking to numerous 
dealers, calling tire company hotlines, and getting advice from 
numerous people, I decided to purchase Yokohama Y370G tires 
(LT 195/75 R 14 Load Range D). Harry Yates is absolutely sold on these 
tires and I had the local dealer order a complete set of tires for me 
and a friend who also needed tires for his camper.  Cost was $80 per 
tire mounted and balanced.  The dealer was amazed how little weight he 
needed to use to balance these tires. Said that usually on a load range 
D tire that he needed to use a lot of weights. 

I took the van on a 8,000 mile trip through many Western states 
and encountered very heavy side winds in Montano and Wyoming. The van 
handled beautifully and I couldn't have asked for better stability in 
high winds and when trucks passed.  The difference between these tires 
and the MXL's was very noticeable.  These tires make the van handle 
great and rain traction is excellent.  I haven't had them in the snow 
yet, but reports from Harry and others say they are great snow tires.

My friend who also bought the Yokohama's is an experienced Van owner 
and has owned three vanagan campers.  He has put over 12,000 miles on 
the tires and says the Yokohama Y370G is the best tire he has had on a 
van. He loves the stability they provide compared to other tires he has 
had.

I am sure there are other good tires for the 14&quot; rim on a camper, but 
the Yokohamo Y370G has my vote.
