Re: next CCC's date is set!
Mentioned that they would like something as far east and south as possible
(from California's bay area) ...

VanBondo suggests Jerome, AZ for a future next CCC meet!
Arizona Bus Club Jerome Jamboree!

Located between Flagstaff and Prescott, AZ in the northern half of the
state, Jerome was a once thriving mining &quot;cowboy-era&quot; town which was over
taken by hippies and redneck hermits alike in the 60's and '70's. Worse yet,
it gravitated toward the tourist seeking vegatable/crystal hugging/Yanni
listening/convergence hoping beasties since. 
Once per year the Bus Club invades the &quot;Abandoned Mining Town&quot; located in
the western part of the town. We tend to &quot;shake their bag for them.&quot; Shake
and bake time. Two years ago, the event included a unscheduled/unofficial
magnesium fire which prompted the entire Jerome/Cottonwood Valley volunteer
fire depatment to show up thinking that all hell and hills were on fire.
Nope it was just the light reflecting off of nearby mountains/hills. It just
looked like a little ol' forest/range fire from town. The same year included
&quot;entertainment&quot; by a hyped up (cranked?) tall conga drum player, Kurt Cobain
reincarnate, who basically had to be shot, gagged, and tied up to get quiet.
=) It was like, &quot;OK Ricky Riccardo we get the picture now shut the fup!&quot;
Alot of folks saw it as entertainment and loved it. Then again, alot of
people voted for Nixon. I was playing the crazy and whacky guy and trying to
get some sleep. Under threat of death from the town folk and owners of the
&quot;Abandoned Mining Town&quot; efforts were made to quiet the event &quot;a tad&quot;.
Last year was much mellower in general. The lucky VanBondo-Trapp family
singers tried to park &quot;away&quot; from the noisy crowd and accidentally parked
*right* next to the only group of hooting and hollering folks with portable
stereos blasting Nirvana/NIN/&quot;The Henry Rollins Orchestra&quot; ;-) and imbibing
in too much home brew. Probs home to Milwaukee or a flock of Cydesdales from
St. Louis or something. Rusty was forced to share &quot;some&quot; of the Clydesdale
Special just to be &quot;neighborly.&quot; ;-)

Typical events include a 200 van caravan from Phoenix to Jerome,(130 miles
up hill bumper to bumper with the 36hp up front tends to piss off the
truckers REAL well!), a swap meet, a chilli cook-off~ just great for a large
community camp out event ;-), car judging, enough raffle prizes to choke a
horse, slow drags, alot of laughs, dust, heat, no shade, opportunity to see
the folks who have been gossiping about you all Summer, Proud reving engines
with stinger pipes at odd hours, babies incessantly crying, teenaged kids in
slammed bugs away from Mom and Dad for the weekend (oh joy), a chance to buy
really cool AZ Bus CLub Tie dyed T-shirts (to increase that &quot;GDdancing bear
/NORML sticker&quot; effect with the troopers) and too much of Jerry Jess on the
microphone.
Don't ask me why but regular attendees seriously come from all over
California, New Mexico, ElPaso, TX, Colorado, and of course from all over
Arizona. Maybe we can convince the CCC's to make an appearence. Hey it aint
Death Valley but it's just as far and just as &quot;good!&quot; Perfect for the whole
(Manson) family!

Outside of exaggerated my smart*** description it really is a fun weekend.
