Subject: RE: Cold Start Problem


&gt;I have an 82 fuel injected gas Vanagon.  Started getting hard to
&gt;start late this winter.  Tuned it up, new thermostat, new cyl.
&gt;head temp sensor.  Runs great once started, but still doesn't
&gt;like to start when cold.

The first car I ever owned ('70 squareback, or most of one) acted
exactly like this, especially on humid or rainy days. In my case, it
was old, oily spark plug wires. Did you replace these in your tune-up?

If not, pull off one wire from a plug, stick an unbent paper clip
into the end, and tape it. Then use a glove to hold this about 1/4&quot;
from metal, and crank the engine. It may start, so be careful. You
should see a spark jumping from the paper clip to the metal.

The spark should be a bright white or bluish-white color. If it's
sort of orange or yellow, then you have some weakness in your ignition
circuit. If the plug wires are real old, then they could be the culprit,
even if they look dry. The coil is another possibility. It's oil-filled.
If you can see anything leaking out of it, then it's on the way out.

Hope this helps.
