Subject: Sad Scene in Oakland

	Yesterday, while at the farmer's market at Jack London Square,
we motored past the remains of a burned vanagon westy. Driver's door
removed, pass. door and sliding door attached but open... Looked like the 
fire started in the engine compartment. Not sure if it was abandoned before
or after the fire, but the driver's door being neatly gone makes me think its
being stripped. Sad.
