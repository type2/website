A point of clarification. Would a reasonable substitute for a C rated tire
on a Vanagon be a higher rated standard car tire? If I understand Steve's
point a stiffer sidewall would provide better handling so it might be wise
to go to tire rated for ahigher speed to gain that advantage.

Right now I have 185C Michelins on the back and regular 195s on the front
- the fronts will need to be changed soon.
