Subject: Thanks for the 'yard tip!

      Tim Schlaile posted a note about an '84 westy that was
used by a vet; it was in a 'yard in Rockvile, Maryland.  I was 
there this morning and FINALLY go a complete set of curtains
and all the factory support rods, screws, spacers, etc.  He
was right, the interior in in very near mint condition.  Stove,
poptop, etc.  The pop top looks brand new.  I also found the
screen that snaps over the rear end when the hatch is up.  Perfect
condition, no tears, $5.  The curtains were $30.  I have looked 
for a long time for those, and they were complete.  The stove 
doesn't have a scratch on it.  I must admit, however, that I 
also got the westy window that was just above the stove.  I have
lusted in my heart for the westy type windows; now I won't have 
to jump up in the night to get the plastic screen out before I 
can shut the window when it rains.  But my getting the window 
now means the interior, and particulary the stove, will be 
exposed to the weather.  If any one wants a really nice stove, 
you really  ought to come get this one.  I closed all the doors
and rolled up all the windows, except one, before I left.  Even 
rugs are in excellent shape.

	It is a 4-speed, and the seats, bed are in excellent 
shape;  the  front seats swivel.  Some one else got the right
cylinder head (?); there is no body damage, fuel injection 
is complete.  I didn't notice the mileage.
