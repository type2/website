Subject: Re: 87 HELP!!!


       I had a very similar problem that the dealer could not fix!
       It was the middle of the winter and I didn't have a place out
       of the snow to work on it. So I thought a VWoA dealer was the 
       best thing. Man was I wrong. They wanted to put a computer in.
       6 weeks later after the snow was melting I fix it by replacing
       a wire. I simply traced out every wire in the engine compartment
       from the computer to the engine. Found the temperature sensor
       not making a connection. Pulled on the wire right there in the
       engine compartment where the engine rocks and found the break.
       I then replaced the entire wire to the computer. I haven't has 
       that problem since.
    
       Your symptoms sound just like mine. The only other think I 
       know of that will can cause these symptoms is the O2 sensor. To
       check this just disconnect the single wire plug. This is a good 
       temperary check. Or a temerary fix to get you home.

                 let us know what you find
