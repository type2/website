Subject: Re: Tire Sizes

One slight clarification Bill:)

&gt;My understanding of tire sizes:
&gt;
&gt;r75/185/14
&gt;
&gt;Starting at the end:
&gt;
&gt;14   -  14&quot; wheel (diameter - ed.)
&gt;185  -  tred width in mm
&gt;r75  -  ratio of tire sidewall height to tread width

I have been told by well informed &quot;theys&quot; that 75 here denotes the &quot;series&quot;
of the tire and would be the side wall height as a *percentage* of the
tread width.

This would work out to about (nothin' up my sleeve: PRESTO!) 139 mm for the
185 mm width.

Occasionally, but irrelevently for we rolling-box owners, another letter
shows up in the mix to denote the &quot;speed&quot; rating or max safe speed for
continuous use.

In the immoral words of Rocket Jay Squirrel: Thank you Mister Know-it-all!
