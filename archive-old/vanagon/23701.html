Subject: Re: door hinge r&amp;r suggestion

Ray Hale door hinge dilema ,any suggestions?   ray

Rusty suggests:

How about:
a) take two pieces of wire coat hangar/mechanics/bailing wire (per hinge). 
b) Bend a 90 degree angle maybe 1/2 inch from end of each wire. 
   Use one wire as above for each hinge hole.
c) locate secondary helpful set of hands.
d) remove one screw from each top and bottom. 
e) insert wire into the single empty hole of each hinge. 
f) carefully repeat for remaining hinge screws.
g) carefully slide door w/hinges along the length of wire until door is off.
h) remove wire from bottom hole of one hinge and insert door hinge screw.
i) tighten screw.
j) repeat for top hole for each hinge.

Reverse process for installation of new door. I'm thinking that the wires
would be used to hold the plate some what in place as the replacement
door/hinge is slid down the length of the same wire(s)

Let me know if this works. I ran into a similar situation during an engine
decklid r&amp;r. Thankfully, the plate was laying on a (supported by the)
horizontal surface.
