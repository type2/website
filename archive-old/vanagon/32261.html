Bob's last conclusion:

&gt;Don't allow David or Bradley near anything made of magnesium.

Should that include installed/operative tranny housings and engine blocks, or
only those removed from vehicles?

Nice to meet the many folk at the campout,  and to see the faces that match
names (now if I can only keep them all properly matched in my volatile organic
memory).  

I might add that particularly on Saturday afternoon, as I returned home early,
the coastline between Big Sur and Carmel was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS due to clear
sparkling weather and brilliant sunshine.  Especially nice lighting on the
rocks, cliffs, and surf.   Naturally, I had left all my camera gear at home!!
