Subject: Hoo boy. The list doth split...


Addressing misconceptions and solar flares:

1. Bandwidth.  The split had to happen sooner or later because v_at_l is so
popular that its very existence is threatened. It's happening now. Despite
our gratitude to the long-suffering University of Minnesota, the tolerance
of that august institution for supporting hitch hikers is finite, and my
understanding is that it was basically split or die. It's splitting.

2. Community. We aren't moving to another country, people. It's just that
we, the airheads, are getting our own room down the hall. There is no
reason you can't subscribe to both lists if you like. And there's no reason
you can't cross-post to both lists if the content is appropriate for that.

v_at_l is a phenomenon, this nobody candy nigh. ;) But there's no reason we
must lose anything we've gained. We're simply sending engine-specific
messages to an engine-specific place. We're keeping the Lore, but we're
making the Procedure a little more refined. This is important to me: v_at_l
and type2 are symbiotic. Each will be a better resource for it. Splitting
will make the signal-to-noise ratio better while simultaneously making the
mail load less burdensome for all concerned, even while sacrificing little
or nothing.

3. Logistics. I want to emphasize that unless you end up subscribed to the wrong
list, no action is required on your part. The list that's appropriate for
you should start coming to you seamlessly.

Here is the posting address for the aircooled list, to which you
should send public messages:

  type2_at_primenet_dot_com

Here is the automated address for the aircooled list, to which you should
send commands (such as &quot;subscribe type2&quot; and &quot;usubscribe type2&quot; and
&quot;who type2&quot;):

  type2-request_at_primenet_dot_com

Here is the automated address for the digest version:

  type2-digest-request_at_primenet_dot_com

The server thinks of the digest as an entirely different list from the
real-time list. If you want to change from real-time to digest, unsubscribe
from the one and subscribe to the other.

***************************************************************************
Again, do not fool with any of this yet; it's just here so you'll have it
if you need it. I have had people trying to subscribe already; don't do
it--we'll do it for you. Only mess with this if Gerry and I and Joel screw
up somehow.

Here is my own human address, in case you have really tried hard but just
can't figure it out:
