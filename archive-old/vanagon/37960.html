Subject: Re: Overheating symptoms?


&gt;Without a temp gauge, how do I know if my engine is getting close to
&gt;overheating. I know the engine compartment seals should be in good shape, and
&gt;not to overwork the engine, blah blah blah. I know the preventative measures,
&gt;but if I'm driving mountain passes on a hot summer day how do I
&gt;know if I should pull over and let it cool?

I think Muir says you should *almost* be able to hold the dipstick in your
hand at full hot. I just put my face in the cave; you can tell if it's
overheated. It shouldn't feel any hotter than standing over a watercooled
would. Also while crouching behind it, if it's too hot it makes your knees
uncomfortable.

That's about all the non-ordinal tests I can think of. Probably these guys
have many more.

Assuming all the mechanicals are in order (particularly altitude timing),
there's no reason it should overheat in the mountains if you are moving at
speed. Even if there *was* such a thing as a hot day in a mountain pass. ;)
Low-speed high-torque manuevers are reason to be awfully careful, though.
