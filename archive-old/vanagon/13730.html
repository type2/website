&gt;&gt;Did you know that your sh*t will float if you are getting enough fibre in
your diet?

&gt;I think we have a winner for the most intelligent post of the year.
&gt;Sarcasm at its best.


Easy now, the poor shmoe that posted the orginal VIRUS WARNING probably has
a pretty good idea that he/she made a mistake.  I am glad to see however,
that most of us don't fall for these hoaxes.  I have seen many of these
types of stories and some even have made it into the local newspaper, and
you wouldn't believe the number of people that they fool.  Everytime the
story gets transferred to someone it changes ever so slightly.  

Oh did you hear......Volkswagen is recalling all of its early 55hp motors,
they found that moving below the speed limit on hill climbs is a hazard to
the flow of traffic. :-)
