Subject:        naming the bus (was Re: Updated Web Page)

 I've owned Chevy's and Toyota's, but never grew so =
&gt;&gt; fond of them to give them a name.
&gt;
I have a 71 westy which is named dumbelle, cause of its color and 
high suspension (Dumbo), and because it is a beaut (Belle).   My '87 
Dodge Caravan is called Stella, just because it stalls so damn much!
