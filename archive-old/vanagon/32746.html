Subject: Re: Call for Papers: Journal of Vanagon Addiction

&gt;Okay, now that I've got your attention...
&gt;
&gt;I was just sparked with an idea. I wonder how many of you would be
&gt;interested in seeing a brick-oriented journal. If you've ever read a
&gt;journal, they're filled with &quot;scholarly&quot; articles and such that try to
&gt;expand thinking about a particular field.
&gt;
&gt;I enjoy reading journals because they offer snapshots current (or past)
&gt;thinking in a discipline. Wouldn't it be cool to have a brick-oriented
&gt;publication that came out twice-yearly, written by people who really had
&gt;something to say about bricks?
&gt;
&gt;Topics might include particular or obscure mechanical procedures,
&gt;reviews of particular year-models or particular features, tire selection,
&gt;why vanagon addiction occurs more in certain geographic regions,
&gt;coffee-making...you know, the kind of stuff we talk about here on the list.
&gt;
&gt;Well, anyway, it's an idea. I'll be happy to pursue it a little further if
&gt;there's enough interest. The one catch I can think of is the cost.
&gt;Journals tend to be expensive and I don't have any relatives in the
&gt;printing business. It would seem that it might have to be one of those
&gt;&quot;vanity&quot;  sort of publications where people pay to have their own books
&gt;printed.  The other option is to make it an on-line journal. I'm sure that
&gt;would be possible...and we could even provide printable files for people
&gt;to FTP and print their own formatted copies.

I think if the journal were made available electronically, it would
eliminate many of the administrative difficulties regarding printing. My
guess is that if you would try to make it available in both hard and
electronic forms, the formatting, printing, binding, packing, addressing,
and mailing, not to mention the accounting and record-keeping etc. would
consume much more time than the transmission of information.

Besides, there already is a somewhat captive audience of 500+ here. :)
