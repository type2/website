Subject:      Australian VW websites

Hi Volks,

If anyone out there is interested in checking out some different
VW websites,the following may be of interest...

      http://www.alpha_dot_net.au/~clubveedub/index.html

This is the home page of the club I belong to and is full of
good pics and links to other VW sites in Oz.Check out some pics
of Aussie Vee Dubs from the VW Nationals which is held every year
over the Easter Holiday.See all the Manx buggies,a 351 Chevy powered
Beetle and much more.

               http://www.volkswagen_dot_com.au

Volkswagen Australia's home page.See all the latest range of cars
and the full range of Vans,Caravelles and Pickups available
in Australia.A very good VW site with heaps of info and pictures.
Hope it doesn't make some of you a bit jealous!

               http://www.razorback.aust_dot_com

Heard of the VW razorback ? Come see the VW pickup that Australia is
exporting back to Europe! I won't say more,just check it out!

There's many more too but the above sites will link you to them.
I'd especially be interested in what you think of the Razorback.

Cheers,
