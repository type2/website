&gt;On another, older topic:  In the tire thread, someone had asked if
&gt;&quot;reinforced&quot; was the same as &quot;Load Range C&quot;.  If that got answered, I missed
&gt;it.  Izzat the same thing?
IF YOU FIND OUT, LET ME KNOW.

&gt;&quot;next week&quot;.  I gave up and bought some Dunlop's.  Amazing!  They seem to
&gt;improve the handling - they certainly make less noise while cruising and in
&gt;hard cornering, and they look like they are wearing better than the Michelin's.
WHAT KIND OF DUNLOPS? I, TOO, AM DESPERATELY SEEKING REINFORCED MICHELIN XZX
BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THEM.
