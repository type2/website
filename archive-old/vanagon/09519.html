&gt; The only problem with Joshua Tree is that it is fairly far from the Bay
&gt; area, where most of the West-coast vanagon owners seem to be.  Another
&gt; nice place is Red Rock Canyon, which is farther North on highway 395.
&gt; It features a large campground and beautiful sandstone formations like
&gt; those in Bryce canyon (Utah).  It's kind of isolated though.  Either of
&gt; these places would be fine with me for the next pre-tour.  How does
&gt; late March sound?
&gt; 
  
  In late March most of the passes over the Sierra to Hwy 395 are still closed.
  Access to 395 involves taking hwy 80 or 50 up around L. Tahoe or looping down
  underneath via Bakersfield. Those of you who survived the stormy weekend
  in Big Sur seem real interested in a &quot;desert&quot; environment for the next 
  outing..... Anything to do with rainfall? 

  Pinnacles National Monument, like Death Valley, is unbearably hot during
  the summer and might be a good place to visit during the spring. I don't
  remember exactly where it is though, relative to North &amp; South Calif.

  Sorry we didn't make the Pfeiffer outing - With all the rain and wind, I had
  a wholesale family mutiny on my hands. We thought of you all as we ate the
  brownies that were intended for the potluck. Thanks for the phone calls, 
  though - Were those with Bradley's new cellular? Fantasticly clear, if so.

  BTW, It's STILL raining!

  Drenchedly yours,

  Dave Kautz
