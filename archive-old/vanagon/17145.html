OK, so I'm replying already,

Just joined into this group, however, I have been a frequent Bus and Bug
owner for years.

Now working on my third 1971 Bus, first Westphalia model though. Also have
just purchased a 1970 Westphalia that need motor and body work (is there
anything else to work on?)

I live in Vernon, British Columbia.
