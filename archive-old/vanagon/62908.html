&lt;&lt; 	I just did this last week. I have also heard that you can use ATF,
 but I used a product that I think was called engine flush, the manufacturer
 is Gunk. You just put it in the crankcase, making sure you aren't
 overfilling with that addition, let the engine idle for 5 minutes, then
 drain it and put in new oil and a new filter. You can't drive it during the
 flush, or rev the engine.
 	I did it for 2 lifters that wouldn't pump up. I had tried another
 product by JB that you add to the oil and drive normally, changing the oil
 within 1500 miles, but it didn't help my noisy lifters. The gunk product
 worked fine, the lifters are now quiet.
 	I was warned later by Kyle Wade of Volks-Motorsports that He's seen
 the flush products cause problems(not the one by JB, He's the one who
 recommended that one to me). Apparantly they can kick so much junk loose
 that they can cause a problem with the oil pump, so be careful if you use
 it and watch your oil pressure afterwards.

I personally know someone who used &quot;motor flush&quot; on their '87 vanagon with
40k (why, I dunno) and collapsed the lifters, and ruined the engine.

use caution....
