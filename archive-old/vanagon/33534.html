Subject: Clutch pressure plate


To All:

If you'll examine the typical clutch pressure plate you'll see that it is not
finished very well.  The steel stamping that forms the shell often has turned
ends and the holes for the mouting bolts need to be champhered for the same
reason.

Spending a few minutes cleaning up the pressure plate with a file will not
only make it safer to handle, since the edges are razor sharp, it will also
make it fit better, since the turned edges prevent the clutch from laying
perfectly flat when you bolt it down.  

Since pressure plates may lay on a dealer's shelves for years, they are
usually coated with grease or cosmoline as a rust preventative.  If you will
clean alway all of the grease with paint thinner you'll eliminate the
possibility of getting grease on your pressure plate.  The cosmoline is also
a problem when it comes to balancing.  If you leave the rock-hard cosmoline
on the plate its mass will be included in the balancing process, but when
installed and the plate heats up, the cosmoline will be thrown off.

After cleaning your pressure plate give the stamping a light coat of gloss
enamel.  It keeps it free from rust and sends a subtle message to the guy
doing the balancing.  The components of rofessionally built engines are
either plated or painted, wherever possible.  The cast iron pressure plate is
not painted of course, since it is a friction surface.  Protect it from rust
by wiping it down with an oily rag.  Scrub it clean with lacquer thinner or
MEK before installation.
