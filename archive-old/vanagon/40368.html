&gt;&gt;Anywho, while I was at a junkyard looking for some various parts I saw the

&gt;&gt;Inside there was the Cinzano umbrella ...

I think the P.O. of the bus had a long-drug induced hallucination that 
spawned said bus.

&gt;now, i don't know about the rest of you folks, but i recognize the bus from
&gt;Ernist in Wonderland when i see it! ;)  and i'll bet that White Rabbit was
&gt;just around the corner, right?

Well, there was a yellow Rabbit two heaps down, but its front end was 
crushed and the engine gone ;)
And believe me, I have never been to wonderland, and never smiled like a 
Cheshire cat.

&gt;sounds like SOMEBODY dipped into the homebrew while it was still 
fermenting!

That is a normal occurrence here in Orygun.
