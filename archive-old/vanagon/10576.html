&gt; Hi I'm new here.I own a 1979 bus. I was considering retro fiting a 
&gt; westfalia top from a 1971 bus. The guy wants $100 canadian for the
&gt; top. Has anybody done this before? Is it a pain? Is it worth it.
&gt; thank you for your help
Yep, I put a '70 top on a '78, although I did have the sunroof hole cut
already... A good day's work for two people.
