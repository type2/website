Really, why 90 &amp; 91?  Aren't these critters the same from '86 on?
I just bought some new seals that are sitting in the poly bag ...

 &gt;
 &gt;the big question I have about this harry and the rest of you guys is whether
 &gt;there are now a new kind of injector seals and that we have to avoid buying
 &gt;some of the old stock items from before then began manufacturing upgraded parts.
 &gt;
 &gt;Anyone have a clue on this one?
