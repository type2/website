Subject: Help! installing new muffler - 1st time
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 94 20:42:01 EDT
From: randy johnson &lt;Randy.Johnson_at_lambada.oit.unc_dot_edu&gt;

the facts:

73 camper

GT Style muffler from RMM

It would appear that all i need to do is remove the old muffler (cut bolts
off? mostly likely) and then bolt the new one on using the new gaskets and
new bolts.

Is that correct?  Oh i hope so.  But somehow i doubt it.  Nothing ever
seems to work THAT easily :-)

This is tomorrow mornings project.  Randy
