&gt;&gt;Thanks, Joel &amp; Jamie.  If Jim and Joel and Jamie all recommend 2500 miles,
&gt;&gt;why then, 2500 miles it shall be!  That's plenty good for me!  How convenient,
&gt;&gt;I'm at 95,000 miles right now.
&gt;
&gt;that'll work. but just remember, you need to find out what works FOR YOU.
&gt;don't do it just because WE do it. :)  i can't say that 2500 is any better
&gt;(or worse) than 3000 or even Steve's 5000. it just makes me feel better to
&gt;do it at 2500, based on MY experiences.
I agree;  I aim to change my oil at ~2500Km intervals, but by the time I've
collected the oil and filter, and found the time to get greasy, I've found
that I'm closer to 5000Km.

&gt;**by the way, did i mention that my bus 'uses' about 1/4 quart in 2500 miles?
&gt;which is another reason i change at 2500 ... so as not to let the level get
&gt;too low.  
Good point.  I too seem to 'lose' oil at that rate.  As an aside on
hydraulic lifters, if I top up the oil when it is about 1/2 a quart low, I
notice right away that the engine runs significantly quieter... there's much
less valve clatter.
