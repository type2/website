&gt;| &gt; I have this thing too. We are doomed!

        Well, unless you can find a dead syncro in a wrecking yard with a
good front diff... (And if the tranny is there, get a stronger locking diff
for the front)...

&gt;| Still I think that it could be worth to see if a Torsen diff could
&gt;| replace the prescious VC. No problem for me thou, my company has big
&gt;| bucks, but I know some people dont... Could be a budget alternative.

        Would it be possible to replace the VC with a solid link? I believe
Tim Smith replicated the locking mechanism for the center driveshaft, so if
one's VC died - this might prove to be a temporary fix to keep the van going.
