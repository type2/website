&gt;Now that I've put aomewhat over 20,000 miles on the 'new' water pump
&gt;on my '87 weekender, a thought comes to mind: should I buy an extra
&gt;water pump and keep it in the van from now on?  (From what I gather, the
&gt;average life span of these water pumps is around 30,000 miles).  The
&gt;VW mechanic's guide lists the labor to be 4.5 hours to replace it, which means
&gt;I could do it in about 8 hours if I were to get stuck.
&gt;Any ideas, insights? am I being too paranoid?

yeah, i think you're being paranoid. maybe not TOOO paranoid. but paranoid. :)
my bus had the water pump replaced at about 20,000 miles or so, and now has
88,000 on that pump with no problems. if they did a good job, you shouldn't
have any problems.

however! i'm the guy that carries spare fan belts around under my rear seat
cause i don't figure that Bubba is gonna have them at the Possum Trot Auto
Repair and Tanning Salon out there in Armpit, AL. so .... it's certainly
something to consider (carrying spares around with you), but don't forget to
get any gaskets and a tube of sealant as well.
