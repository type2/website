&gt; 
&gt; there is, however, one possible trick to doing this, but it involves some
&gt; paperwork.
&gt; 
&gt; if, for example, you bought a bus from a junkyard in california (if the yard
&gt; will sell it to you AND give you a bill of sale/receipt/salvage title ...
&gt; whatever is legally necessary in that state), you could then 'move' the bus
&gt; (on paper, anyway) to some other state, say, alabama (where the title laws
&gt; are not so restrictive).
&gt; 

In fact, they are so unrestrictive, that I believe you don't even need an
official title for cars built before some year ('67 comes to mind).  All
you need to do is have a bill of sale and pay your registration fee.

Or so I was told when I lived in Alabama.
