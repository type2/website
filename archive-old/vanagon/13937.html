&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have a suggestion for a better deal somewhere?

My windshield had a large crack in it for many years.  I finally got a
good one from the junkyard ($30) and had it installed by a couple of, umm,
guys running an auto glass business from the back of a truck ($30).  I
was impressed by how good those guys were, since the bay windows are
easy to break.  Total cost $60 - I used my old seal which was in reasonable
shape.  Had it not been, I probably would have gotten that at the junkyard
too, since new ones are close to $100, I think.
