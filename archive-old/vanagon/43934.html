Subject: Grateful Bed &amp; Breakfast (was ATTN VWer in Puerto Rico) (no VW Content)



 &gt;my fiancee amanda and i are considering honeymoning in puerto 
&gt;rico and would like any suggestions, reccomendations, etc. we want 
&gt;to avoid the touristy areas and see the real puerto rico. 
&gt;considering staying at the Grateful Bed and Breakfast. 
&gt;jonathan and amanda
&gt;
My wife and I went to P.R. for our honeymoon, and stayed at the 
Grateful Bed &amp; Breakfast for several days.  We loved it!  Marty, 
the owner, was fantastic. He made us feel right at home. The scene 
was great, the other guests were really nice, and Marty was 
invaluable in pointing us toward non-touristy things to do.  We 
want to go back to P.R., more to re-visit the Grateful B&amp;B than for 
anything else!

If you want an out-of-the-way place, spend a day or two on the 
island of Culebra.  We rented a car in P.R. for the week, and took 
it with us to Culebra on the ferry.  Not a whole lot to do there, 
just a tiny fishing town on a tiny island, but plenty of 
unpolluted, uncommercialized beaches and a very relaxing pace.  A 
fellow named Druzo rents out some really neat bungalows that he 
built himself on the hillside facing the ocean.  Ask Marty for 
Kathy's number on Culebra, and she'll probably have Druso's number.

Sorry, do not know of anyone who rents VW campers in P.R.  In fact, 
didn't even see one VW camper there.  Maybe if Angel responds, he 
knows of someone.

Email me privately if I can be of more assistance.  Enjoy your 
honeymoon.
