Ok,
	The entire project is done now.  Instructions will follow in another
post.

	The electrical problem was in the twin wires that connect at the starter
and go to the front.  They were all taped up, so I started peeling the tape
off to reveal burned insulation and brittle wire - one ended up breakin
off when I was holding it to take off the insulation.

	I also insulated the entire top of the engine compartment with this
stuff called &quot;THe Insulator&quot;, an impulse purchase at the local speed shop.
I used Liquid Nails and 3M 90 Spray adhesive.  I also insulated the rear
apron, although I'm not sure how well this stuff can take the heat.  It does
work as far as keeping the apron cool, though...  I also insulated the 
engine lid on a whim.  The bus is much quieter now, at least engine noise
wise.  I can hear the tranny whine real bad now (damn solid mounts!)
	
	Also, on the famous reserve valve.  It _does_ shut off all the
gas!  I put it back in and set it to where I thought it was supposed to be...
The engine ran for about 1 minute or so and then sputtered to a halt...  
Took me a few minutes Muir-ing it over to figure out what happened...

	Thanks again for all your suggestions and encouragement along the way!

	Next stop(s)

	Finish heavy bodywork (dents)  - a week or so???
	Do detail bodywork (scratches and pits) - 2 weeks???
	Paint - 3 days (sealer one day, paint next day, clear the next after, 
      plus a week to bask in the sun)
	Re-assemble
	Interior 
	(and so on)
