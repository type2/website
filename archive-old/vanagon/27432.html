&gt;&gt; long enough for me to get my arms full of the stuff I'm trying to unload
&gt;&gt; and then begin to let go, eventually bonking me in the head if I don't
&gt;&gt; duck out of the way in time.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to recondition these things?  Maybe (hopefully) just
&gt;&gt; relube the plunger seals?
&gt;
&gt;Nope, not that I've ever heard.  They're $45 each new.

Or you can drill through the cylinder and plunger (with plunger extended) 
and use a cotter pin or the like to secure the hatch. Beats buying those 
doohickeys all the time.
