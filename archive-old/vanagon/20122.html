Subject: Bus visit

    Went to visit my bus today be for it left for a big stroage place about
100 miles a way.  I was good to see it again.  I have not seen it since I
remove the engine about 6 mo. ago.  The body is in better shape then I
remember it.  Almost not rust, just a little arount the edges of the doors
and along the bottom.  The panals above the wheels are great still have black
goop on them.   
   One minor disappointment though, I wanted to take pictures of the bus as I
have none.  Loaded the camera and took about 32 pictures.  When I got home I
wanted to finish the role and take it to Osco to get devleoped.  So I started
taking pictures of our 4 cats and 1 dogs, and kept taking pictures.   I
didn't load the camera right and did not take any pictures.  This sucks.
  I also got some information about who turned the bus into a camper.
        Contempo Campers, INC
        San Fernado, Concord California

   I think the Contempo number for the Camper is 8048    72.
Does any one have info about this company?  Does is still exsits etc?   

Thanks
