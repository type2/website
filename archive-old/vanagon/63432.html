Subject:      bus candles and sighting

Hey all,

Today my sister got me a very cool Bus candle.  It's a rather large hunk of
blue wax molded into the shape of a splittie.  It is fairly well detailed
and accurate.  It's a splittie panel van.  Where the VW symbol should be up
front, there is a peace sign.  The hubcaps are yin/yang symbols.    It's
like a well-detailed cartoon of a Bus, made into 3D.  Coming out of the
roof are three candle wicks.  It reportedly glows under black light, but I
haven't checked that out yet :-)

I have no idea where she got it, but I suspect that if you visit your local
deadhead shops, you can probably find it.

Also, my folks are watching the Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Absolute Power&quot; in
the other room.  I stepped in for a second.  Clint was getting out of his
car in a parking garage.  In the background was a very sweet split window
Bus, white over green, with safaris (passenger side safari was open).
Kinda cool :-)

Sean
