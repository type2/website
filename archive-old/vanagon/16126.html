Car oiling is very popular in my rea (NW PA).  I have a guy that  
drills and plugs doors, sprays the entire under carriage and fenders  
and charges $25.00.  He uses new Chain saw chain oil that is  
supposed to stick better.  Granted it is a messy process but it  
works.  I looked at a '80 dodge pickup that has a had this done  
every year and it has been abused in every other way, but it is rock  
solid.
