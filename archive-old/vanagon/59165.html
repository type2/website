&gt; the exhaust has a strong smell of gas and is quite smokey.  It is an
&gt; intermittent problem.  I have checked all of the FI components and I do
&gt; not see any problems there.  Am I missing somthing?  Is the engine shot?
&gt; HELP!!

i had the same problem. My engine was reading 120 psi on all four
cylinders and barely ran, but when you got it away from idle it ran fine.

eventually it got so it would barely start, and then die immediately, the
plugs would be dark black.

when i drained my oil it was very thin and smelled strongly of gas, the
carbon had been cleaned off of a lot of the internal component from all
that gas washing over em..  (engine apart for valve work, nothing to do
withthe afm problem.)

the solution: The AFM butterfly was stuck in the wide open position.  This
was causing the injection to feed the engine enough fuel for WOT at idle.
teh bushings were wearing out and the butterfly was scrapin gon the sides
of its housing.  I stuck a piece of sandpaper betwen the butterfly and the
wall of the housing (gritty side toward the butterfly) and worked it back
and forth until enough had been worn away that it would move freely.

this is a prety temporary fix id guess. As the bushing/bearing continues
to wear it will sticck again. Best bet is to buy another one and keep the
sanded down one as a spare (if you indeed have the same problem i did..)

also, there is a procedure in the archive for checking to see if the
spring is worn.

this may not be your problem, but it sounds to me like  has something to
do with fuel delivery.

peace,

steve
