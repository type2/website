&gt; 3.  Where's the best source for small parts - I'm missing a few minor trim
&gt; pieces (e.g., one curtain tie-back, some trim screws, etc.).

For things like that: Your local HW store.

&gt; 4.  What consumables would you take on a trip of this duration - I'm
&gt; planning to take a set of belts, some hoses (the ones that attach directly
&gt; to the engine), fuel, oil and air filters, and a set of spark plugs. 
&gt; Anything else that I should bring along?

I have a diesel, so I'm not familiar with the peculiarities of
the gas enginge. My philosophy is to bring tools for most repairs,
but not soo many parts. What you mention above sounds fine. Also
bring things for &quot;jury riogging&quot; i.e. wire, extra nuts and bolts,
(m6 is a very popular size on the diesel engine ;) metal brackets
with bolt holes, expoxy &quot;radiator&quot; glue (JB weld, PC7 or other)...

&gt; 5.  I will need to tow a light trailer.  What's the best source for a
&gt; trailer hitch?  Additionally, I have a really nice flat bed trailer that
&gt; tows great, but I'm having trouble finding a 4x8 waterproof box to go on
&gt; it.  Any recommendations for such a thing, or can someone recommend a good,
&gt; light trailer to buy?

I towed a hobie cat and canoe on a two month trip last year. The van
(yes even my diesel!) tows it fine, but I'd stongly recommend against
it on a long trip. Finding parking is so much more difficult, and
it is also a bit scary to leave the trailer somewhere when for
instance visiting a city.

A more compact alternative is one of those &quot;hitch hauls&quot; that Harbour
freight and JCW sells. It's a platform which mounts in a receiver
hitch, and extends about 2 ft behind the van. Good for storing wet
and dirty stuff you don't want inside.
