Subject: Recall Notice on GolfIII

My brother bought a 1994 Golf III (new).  Over Thanksgiving he received a 
recall notice.  As he read the letter, everyone was hushed in nervous 
anticipation of what bad mechanical tidings Volkswagen had to tell him 
of. Seems there may have been some faulty workmanship in the...jack.  VW 
even offered to put the new jack (which would arrive shortly by UPS) in 
place in the trunk if he took it to any authorized dealer.
We played with the idea of blowing a tire and calling VW for roadside 
assistance to replace the tire.  They would do it for free in a case like 
this.  Granted, a failed jack can be dangerous, but you just have to laugh...
BTW the Golf III is an excellent car, and worthy descendant of the 
original econobox (we've owned one of each).
