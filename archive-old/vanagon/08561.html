Jerks; tell them if they don't give you better service than that, it'll 
be remembered and known around the world.  Tell them if they can't make 
separate checks, then the gratuity should be 10% since they're saving a 
lot on time and receipt slips.   Tell them if they don't give you a 
better deal, you'll all park your vans in a semi-circle in the parking 
lot blocking the entrance and exit.

Bet you're glad I'm not going, eh? &lt;grin&gt;.
