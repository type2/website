Subject: dagnab varmits

I left my Westfalia at a trailhead for five days and returned to find
evidence of a full blown mouse party. They seemed to prefer the instant
oatmeal, but sampled most of what was available in the main cabin area and
left their little calling cards everywhere. Anyone have any experience
varmit-proofing a Vanagon? The only possible entry points I can think of are
the fresh air intake and the battery vents. Please respond directly as I
haven't yet resubscribed after my vacation.
