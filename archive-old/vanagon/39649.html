Subject: cooling tin, thermastat

I don't know why I waited untill Friday to post but here it goes. I'm 
still looking for cooling tin for my '81 Westy, California model. The 
dealer says the part is OBSOLETE! Since I'm stuck on the east coast 
with my motor in the garage I thought I'd ask the West coast members 
for some help. If you know of a junkyard that might have the tin that 
goes over the Cat. Conv please send me the phone #.
 Also if there is 
anyone with a '81 or '82 California Vanagon I would love to know 
exactly how this piece is attached. I can see the hole in the block 
but there is not one in the heat exchanger. If I can't find a used 
one maybe I could fabricate a replacement from sheet metal. Pleaseee
HELP!
My other question is how important is the thermostat if you are in 
moderate tempatures? Mine is completly gone.
Thanks
BTW I've got 2 brown Vanagon Seats if anyone is interested.
