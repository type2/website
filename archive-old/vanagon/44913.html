&lt;&lt; Popping out of gear is usually a sign of a dying trans.  Worn out gears is

 &gt;I have an 84 Vanagon who's transmission just started popping out
 &gt;of 1st gear during hard deceleration.  Has anyone every run into
 &gt;this problem before?  If so, what was the solution.
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks in advance.

 'Popping out of 1st could be bad synchro hub or main shaft bearing.
 Relatively easy to fix if you find right Transmission person.
