&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt;  
&gt;  I'm thinking about adding some sort of extension to my front bumper. 
&gt;  I've seen them on some web pics of vanagons and am looking for a
&gt;  source.  Specifically, I'd like the one that protects the headlights and
&gt;  radiator from brush etc.  I did see one that had a winch on it that
&gt;  looked real cool, but I don't need a winch and I can't remember where I
&gt;  saw it.

MSDS (Martin Schnieder Designed Systems) makes a brush guard for Vanagons.  I
looked at Marty's first hand since MSDS is only about 10 miles from where I
live.  I decided it was a lot of added weight for relatively little value and
didn't purchase one.

You can contact them at:
