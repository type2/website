The fuel-injected '75 bus, which otherwise runs nicely, keeps stalling
more and more frequently and I'm starting to get quite annoyed. After
stalling, it will not start up again, unless I go wiggle some wires at
random. Pulling the wire harness to one side appeared to be a solution for
a while, but response to this treatment is fading. I removed the harness
last night and checked the individual wires, but couldn't find anything
wrong. Reinstalled it this morning, using WD40 on the connectors. After
that it ran fine for about 80 miles, but subsequently the symptoms
returned with a vengeance. 

If anyone has even the faintest idea of which connector to which F.I. part
is responsible for this, I would really appreciate a message. I plan to
resume the return trip from NJ to MO tomorrow (Sunday) morning.

Thank you very much for any help you could provide.
