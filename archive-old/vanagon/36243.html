Subject: Re: high energy ignition

&gt;I read Bob Hoover's sermon on upgrading the stock ignition with a CD type
&gt;ignition and, of course, *need* to have something like that! Looked
&gt;through a recent HotVWs magazine (featuring an article on an ignition
&gt;conversion sold by CB Performance) and also checked an old JCWhitney
&gt;catalog. There is a choice of solutions and a choice of brands (Crane,
&gt;MSD, Allison?, Universal, and more), and probably also a choice of prices. 
&gt;While some kits worked for --or were available for-- all distributors,
&gt;others would only replace --or work with-- an 009 (my FI, type4-powered
&gt;'75 bus, however, wouldn't run well w/ an 009).  I would be grateful for
&gt;any information (options, prices, etc.) that can help me make a choice. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance!  --Sami
&gt;
&gt;PS: a system universal enough to work with various cars (including those 
&gt;with 6 cylinders) would be great!
&gt;
The Pertronix Ignitor works well with the Type IV engine, as well as 009,
050 or any vacuum-advance BOSCH 4-cylinder distributor.  It just replaces
the points and condensor; the coil, rotor and distributor cap remain the same.
