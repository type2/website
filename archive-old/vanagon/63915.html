Subject: BUS BOYS SCREWED ME!! Don't let them do it to you!!!

hello listees-

This is a bit dated, but I figured I shoudl alert you
guys/gals as well.  I have yet to be able to get BusBoys
on the phone since the day this happened.....

I should have known if I said something good about
someone- they'd turn around and stab me in the back!!!

BUS BOYS did just that!!

In early July I ordered VDO gauges from BusBoys.
They said they were on back order.  I said ok.
They call me two weeks later to tell me they can't
get what I wanted.  I SPECIFICALLY stated that I 
wanted to get them all from the same source.
I SPECIFICALLY stated that I wanted to CANCEL
my order.  The guy on the phone said OK. DONE.
Handled, no problem, ORDER CANCELLED!!!

That was over two weeks ago.

I called the bank today to check my balance-
OVERDRAWN- WHAT!?!?!?!  I check the detailed
debits/credits there is a charge for $211.06.
I'm at loss- so I call the bank to inquire.
They look it up and say 'yes- that came from
a place called Bus Boys.'  I tell her the story,
she tells me to call them then call her back.
I call them, damn machine!

Here's what makes it even worse!  I'm leaving
for phish tour in the morning.  I'm low on cash
as it is.  I have a DAT tape order about to hit
my account! The lady at the bank said there is
no way to for me to get the money back this week.
To top it off, I will not get the overdraft charge
back ever!!!

I'm not a violent man- but if Bus Boys was 
within driving distance......

Do not give your card # to someone you do not
trust completely.  From this day forward anything
shipped to me will be COD. (with the exception
of the honest people I have had good dealings 
within the past.)

Any suggestions?  
Who can I report this blatant example of 
BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES to?

PISSED OFF-
Rob
