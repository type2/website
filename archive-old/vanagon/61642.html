What could be the benefits/&quot;misbenefits&quot; with a Torsen differential instead of 
the VC? Torsen diff distributes power to the side that has traction, instead 
to the side that rotates freely, like a normal diff.

Hi Peter,

might be a pretty good idea to use a TorSen diff instead of the Visco. As it 
is mechanical it won't be completely resistant against wearing out. But it 
seems to work in the AUDI quattros quite well.

Don't know if it would be possible to adopt an AUDI TS Diff instead of a VC to 
a T3 syncro or a T4. You can buy them aftermarket for the Range and Land 
Rovers and some light trucks. I'd really prefer VW adopting the whole AUDI A6 
drivetrain to a Transporter included the V6 TDI, but that's another story ...

Ever heard about the 'Bucher Duro' a swiss army light Truck similar to the 
UNIMOG ?

They have three TorSen diffs in the vehicle and it seems to work quite fine 
otherwise swiss army would not have purchsed it.

Only disadvantage is that there has to be at least *some* traction on the idle 
wheel to make the TorSen diff work. (So worst case you have to engage your 
breakes a bit)

BTW: Did you purchase the TriStar you were mailing about a few weeks ago ??

What about other syncro drivers up in scandinavia ? Have they all quit and 
bought Toyotas or what's the matter up there ???


Best regards and a nice week-end

Tom N.
