Subject: 83 idle prob persists

Hi All,

I took my westy to a local mechanic who supposedly specialized in VWs. I
asked him if he knew about vanagon WB motors and he said yes. He said he
checked the engine over and concluded that the fuel injectors must be at
fault because the HCs were very high. This after doing a compression check.
He got readings of 115,115,120,125. He wanted $650 to fix it. I went and
bought a compressiuon testers and followed the bentley and got readings of
160,155,150,155. I guess he did it wrong or didn't do it at all. I got
ripped off big time ($130 :(  )I checked the injectors and found that one
had a slighlty weaker spray then the others. I am replacing this injector
but still think it might be something else. Does anyone know how I can test
the ECU to see if its the problem. I popped the cover off and noticed some
small dark spots in two locations on the circut board. I have checked
everything ignition and fuel item except fuel pressure. Can someone please
give me some pointers on checking the ECU. I have basically ruled out
everything but the injectors and the ECU. Thanks.
