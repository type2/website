Marlin askes...
&gt; Greaaat!  Any ideas as to:
&gt; 
&gt; A) Where I can get a schematic, etc

Treat it like a 34PICT, it has the same adjustments.  Check the Bentley
for particulars.

&gt; B) Where I can get a replacement (not necessarily NOS but HEY! when
&gt; dreaming dream big I always say!)

All VW FLAPS either carry or can get the Brosol carbs.

&gt;&gt; would rather just have everything as it &quot;was&quot; so I can look at the entiure
&gt;&gt; engine as '68/'69
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -MarlinThat would be the Brosol 30/31PICT carb.  Modern Brazilian carb.  It
&gt;is commonly sold as a 34PICT replacement, with an adapter base.
