&gt; Heck, my '58 Bug doesn't even HAVE a gas gauge and I've never yet run out of

Just keep in mind that your gas milage can fluctuate quite a bit.  I
got 200 miles out of my first few tanks and figured if I always
gassed up at 150 I'd be OK.  Duh, the difference between nice
long trips on the highway in the fall and short trips in the winter
when it's 7 degrees F is a lot.  Let's just say one time I
put 10.4 gallons in my 10.6 gallon tank and since then have
been fueling up at 100 miles :-)
