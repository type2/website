_______________________________________________________________________________

I have a '71 pop top with a slotted strip of aluminum on the top of the 
sliding door frame to hang a curtain.  Does anyone know where to get the 
little sliders that go in that slot from which to hang a curtain?

   The curtains in my '76 Westy had a channel sewn as the top seam
   and slid over the strips -- if you really need curtain sliders,
   I'd guess trying a shop that sells curtains (makes more sense for
   VW to have chosen existing curtain/marine curtain hardware than
   reinvent the wheel)
