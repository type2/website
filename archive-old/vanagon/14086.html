&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have the following problem. Sometimes, I the motor has ignition failures, 
&gt; especially with low rpm. Two of the ignition cables were quite loose, so I 
&gt; replaced them. But nothing changed.
&gt; 
&gt; So, what is the problem now. I also noticed that the contact of the 
&gt; distributor arm is a bit &quot;charred&quot;.

Examine the dist. cap carefully for any cracks or holes, inside and out.
Very often the fault lies in the cap, if you have a spare try swithcing
caps. Also, if you have some sort of shield on the cap examine that for
any spots that would allow the spark to short out to ground.

It helps to examine the dist. and sparkplug leads in the dark while the
engine is running. That way you can see any arcing. Also, if you listen
carefully you might be able to hear the short.

All of this presumes that your problem lies in the ignition spark shorting...
