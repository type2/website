&gt;to alignment problems, etc.  Frankly I am steering clear of Pirelli
&gt;in general as a friend had bad luck with P6's on a CRX.  On the

I've had good luck with Pirelli Winter 190 snow tires and would highly 
recommend them. They have a filler reinforced sidewall that is way stiffer 
than the 8-ply Yoko Y370s I just put on. They handled/wore well (in 
winter/spring!) but didn't have decent load capacity, lots of bulging unless 
van was 'empty'. They were only 4 ply rated 35psi max. so I expected that. 
P6s have been NOT recommended to me by Pirelli dealer, they must be warmed 
up and driven aggressively to maintain stickness, death in rain slick stuff.
