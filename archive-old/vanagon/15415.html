Subject: Re: rusted vent-wings

&gt;To whomever originally posted this thread of thought-
&gt;	the rear left wing on my 78 Westy was rusted horribly when i 
&gt;bought it.  Living up here in the land of eternal drizzle, (no- not San 
&gt;Fran.- more north-- Seattle), the damn thing leaked so bad on the P.O. it 
&gt;rotted out the carpet, wood sink/stove/fridge cabinet back and bottom, 
&gt;and made the poor guy's interior a stinkin' mess.  Why he never addressed 
&gt;the root of the problem ( the vent wing had ancient-looking 
&gt;shipwreck-type rust corrosion), I do not know.
&gt;	But *I* did address it.  
&gt;	After garaging it and letting it dry some, I ripped out all the interior
&gt;stuff, replaced bad wood/carpet etc.
&gt;	Then came the fun.  Bye-bye frustrating leak- I kicked the *poop* outta 
&gt;that whole back side window- vent wing and 3/4 glass- and replaced it with a 
&gt;pretty-lookin' new seal encircling my 1-PIECE window.  
&gt;	No more leaks there, mom.
&gt;

Interesting, my DPO did the same thing, but only on one side!  The other one 
needs attention as well.  Maybe this summer.
