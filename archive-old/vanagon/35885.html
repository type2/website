Subject:  Small cars in the night. 

&gt;The rain cell was as small as it was intense and the stream of
&gt;traffic punched through with little trouble.  Coming out of it, I
&gt;acquired a mascot, a pair of headlights clinging to my sixty mile
&gt;per hour coat-tails as the mad rush swirled past.  The headlights
                                                    ---------------
&gt;were close together, the vehicle one of those tiny things driven
-----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;by people who can't afford a real car
--------------------------------------
I remember those from when I was a kid. Funny looking little car
made in Germany with an air cooled engine. Bugs I think they called them;-)
