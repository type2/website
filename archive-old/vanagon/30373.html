Subject: Re: Sleeping in Campers - headbanging

In my 73 westy, i no longer have, there was a shelf over the rear of the bus
which one could konk your head on sitting up unawares.  I always slept head
to the rear, howeveer.  I called the shelf &quot;the headbanger&quot;  and talked about
putting metallica and ozzy stickers on it...
