&gt;I'm still thinking about a winch for the Thing, but probably not for the
&gt;EV.  Yup, that Macho reason.  Goona put all the silly geegaws on it that
&gt;the 'Off Road Pickups' do (not that most of them EVER leave asphalt -
&gt;except to drive on concrete).

Then on the same day I write:

I'm going to get my roll bar and put 5 KC Lights on it for 10,000 candle power
of light, and get my brush guard and pusher bar with more KC lights on them
for another 10,000 candlepower, as well as my neon pink hydraulic steering
dampener, and jack the Thing up 5 feet off the ground, with my big Mickey
Thompson mud tires, and to top it all off, I will get a $2000 clearcoat
paint job with wild graphics, that scratch easily. The farthest I will take it
off the road is to park it in my front yard.;-))))

BTW How would a Whale Tail look on my thing?:-)

Is it Friday yet, I'm sick of this week.
