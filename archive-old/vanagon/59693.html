Subject: Help - I'm looking for a newer Westy to replace my rusting 87

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  As connoseurs of VW's you know how
hard these are to find.  I'm looking for a newer Westy in great condition
(body, engine, &amp; soul).  I currently own an 87 with a lot of New England
rust.  I would like to get an immaculate Westy to become my new summer
traveling van, and still use my current van as my winter car (no matter how
bad it gets I just can't part with it).

Any leads appreciated,
Keep Truckin'
