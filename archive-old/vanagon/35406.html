So thorsland_at_bigvax.alfred_dot_edu says:
&gt; Since I am a new list member myself I believe that a lot of new members
&gt; may get the idea that old VW busses (and new ones) are not that reliable.
&gt; Hearing everyone's problems can be somewhat discouraging.  So lets hear some
&gt; good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage busses
&gt; have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
&gt; one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt; without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
&gt; be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.

I think the best testimony is the amount of older buses still on the road.
How many other vehicles that old are still being driven.  There are a few
other brands, but for the most part, VW is still king of the oldies but
goodies.  Yuk! And I hate that phrase. ;)  Anyway, I wouldn't be too depressed
about what you call bad news on this list.  After all that's what this
list is for.  Sharing technical information about one's VW.  And hell,
haven something to do on the old beast is part of the pleasure of owning
one.
