Subject: Sad thought :(  My Bus For Sale?

Well,

     The day may soon be near when I must unsubscribe to this list. 
Due to the fact I may sell my good ole Westy. I enjoyed it while it 
lasted, but right now I dont have the time nor money to maintain it 
and keep it alive. I was wondering if one of you could tell me how 
much I could get for it (rough estimate of course).

     Its a 1973 VW Kombi, Westfalia interior, pop top camper (the 
canvas is gone), not sure of miles on motor (odometer broke). I was 
told the motor was rebuilt in California right before it came to UT, 
when in UT was never registered by owner (still had CA plates). I put 
a couple thousand on it is all.  Body has minor rust nothing major, 
and rear corner panel needs replaced.

Any input would be sadly, I mean greatly appreciated.

Rich
'73 Westy
