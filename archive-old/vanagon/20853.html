I once had an out-of-body Belzona experience if that counts.


No but seriously, I have heard good things about JBWeldbond on engine
blocks and have tried it on the muffler of the vanagon. It breaks up with
the extreme heat in about 
 2 days. JCWhitney sells something along the lines you are describing for
half the price....


Also FWIW I have mounted two ultrasonic deer warning devices on the roof
of the Westy (they look like small halogen headlamps). Picked them up at a
dollar store for a... dollar. What the heck can't hurt and keeeps people
wondering...I have no idea if they work. After the drive through Penn (a
LOT of dead deer) I'll try anything.


Also FWIW Radio Shack sells a replacement switch for the Westy
battery/water/fridge LED panel. Fairly easy to install if anyone's is on
the fritz.


Also FWIW I adjusted the linkage on the Westy gear shift (the one right
rear of the gas tank). Found that by lengthening the rod the trans will no
longer jump out of first and it is much closer to the seat for easier
shifting.
