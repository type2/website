Subject: Oil leak pinpointed?

My 79 only leaks when I add oil, basically.  A few drops other times, but
not really.  I add oil when level is at min mark, about 1/2 quart.
I start the engine, and 30 secs later, it starts coming out above the oil filterand comes down the side.  It is a new filter, and tight.Could this be coming from the oil cooler?  I know its not the filter, because I've replaced
it a few times recently.  Anyone have same experience?
Desperately seeking no leaks, Paul
