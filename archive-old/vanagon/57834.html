Hi Volks,

A ex-listee friend who no longer has net access has asked me post this
request. He is looking for the following engines for some of nhis many
projects:

'80 2.0L air-cooled engine (longblock only needed) - for Westy

'85 1.9L water-cooled engine (longblock only needed) - for GL which may be
for sale

You can reach him, Charles Bennett, at 212/371-1142 (home), 212-332-3815
(work), or 212/332-4410 (fax).

BTW, don't let him fool you. He knows and has a *LOT* more than he lets on
:-) Very nice and honest person too.

Thanks!

tony
