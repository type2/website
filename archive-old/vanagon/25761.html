&gt; Anyway, I'm holding off no matter what you volks say, but I was curious 
&gt; about the degree of rarity for 1960 double doors. I was born in '60 and 
&gt; always wanted a vehicle from '60...a VW bus of that year would be the 
&gt; ultimate!

They're not rare like doubledoor barndoor 23 windows are, but not common.
I passed on a '61 a few weeks back.  It had had everything, except the nose
was caved in, wheel wells cut out.  It came full to the gills with
parts, too.  It had some rust, but not as bad as some I've seen.

he wanted $400
