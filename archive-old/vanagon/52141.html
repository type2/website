On another thread the following web address was given to look at =
Vanagons.=20

http://www.vw.co.za/history/frame.htm

On this page I selected the 1990's link and there at 1991 is a picture =
of a vanagon that has quad round headlights.  I have  four rectangular =
headlights on my '87 Westy.  Is a conversion to quad round headlights =
available?  I have only seen dual round headlights.
