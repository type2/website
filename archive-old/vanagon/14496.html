Subject: Re: NetWisdom Needed: Rear Engine Carrier

&gt;Well, I found out why my fan belt mysteriously smoked
&gt;and broke yesterday.....seems that the two top carrier
&gt;bolts on the '71 bus have sheared off at the case (the
&gt;bottom one pulled out of the carrier long ago. 

This happened to me, years ago, on my '71 Bus.  since I was broke, stranded
in a desolate region, and didn't have the proper tools to fix this, I
abandoned the Bus.

&gt;Query -- can I put on one of those bug engine -to- bus
&gt;adapters (the ones that bolt to the oil pump cover), even 
&gt;though my case does have the casting bulges for the carrier
&gt;bolts? It would seem to be the best way to get the thing
&gt;home, where I could do the job right at a more convienent
&gt;time,

If had had this option back then, I would have used it.  I don't trust
those weird rear engine carriers, but if it means saving your Bus, go for
it.  then fix the baby once you get home safely.
