Subject: engine swap memories...


 When I replaced the motor in my 86' with a 90' motor...

 Well, the 90' motor came out of an auto, so i had to make the 
 necessary changes in order to put it into my manual trans.
 install: flywheel,set the endplay, install pilot bearing...
   lots of fun..

 when i put the motor in and was pretty for into the switch, i 
 realized that the studs on the bottom of the engine case were about
 one inch too short and i could not bolt up the bottom too
