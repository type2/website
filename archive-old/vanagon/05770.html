&gt;What do you think about changing the transmission oil regularly? My 
&gt;manual says you never need to change the transmission oil of a 
&gt;vanagon because there is a lodestone which collects all the metal.
&gt;
&gt;I know Joel changes his transmission oil every two years. But he is also 
&gt;a model vanagon driver. ;)

I've got Uncle Joel beat.  I change the fluid in my 911 and my bus 
(when running) about every 6 months.
