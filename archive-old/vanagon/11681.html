Subject:       Neato workshop manual

This one may not come as a revelation to those of you outside the US 
but I'm impressed.  Bought years ago and sitting on my bookshelf 
because it was strictly 'air-cooled' is:

SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS'
WORKSHOP MANUAL SERIES No 48
VOLKSWAGEN with specs. repair and maint. data
covering type 2-transporter series 1200-1600

Printed by Kenmure Press Pty. Ltd., New South Wales, 1971

Now what's cool about this manual is that it's chock full of 
exceptionally clear black and white photos of carb, starter, 
generator, trans, engine assemblies that just beat the pants off of 
Haynes or Clymer and even Bentley!  It is very specific as to Bosch, 
Solex etc model numbers.

Where I really hit the mother-lode (again, I was thinking 'what use 
could an aircooled manual be to me?') is that this is the first place 
I've seen with measurement specs on the starter solenoid plunger!  
Since I'm having that grinding problem with my starter I gotta tear 
it off and check this.  Maybe I've been blind all this time but all 
the OTHER reference material I have doesn't go into this.

In the spirit of Unca Joel, copies of pertinent sections will be 
available for the asking (and as time permits).

Now a question:
Is this publisher still producing manuals-- would they have one on 
the wasserboxer?  A King's ransom....
