Subject: tunnel-to split conversion, sadness

I put the newly-rebuilt transaxle from the `63 kombi into my `66
camper this week. It's a pseudo-split case (Has a few split-case
characteristics, like the brake setup.) which someone had already
(thankfully! I had enough problems getting the E-brake to work!)
swapped nosecones on, for my convienience. I drained the oil in it
first, and I don't think I've ever seen such clear oil come from a
transmission before! I felt that after 20+ years of sitting, the
viscousity might have broken down, may have partially transformed
back to dinosaur status, etc.
	There was nothing sadder for me this week than watching my
`63 kombi getting hauled away by the wrecker; headlights pointing
straight back at me, looking accusingly at the person who just
couldn't fix her. *sigh*. It was time to take the patient off life
support.
