Subject: Horror story revisited

First, thanks for all the warm, fuzzy responses I got regarding the story
of my topless pop-top Westfalia!

The latest is this:

The insurance company of the mover says they will fix the bus, and this
is a breakdown of what they intend to do:

	Refinish/Install fiberglass top		$100.00 (!?!)
	Replace pop-top gasket			$ 75.90
	Replace rack gasket			$ 24.15
	Replace top latches			$ 30.00
	Replace top trim (not sure what this is)$ 40.00
	Replace tent section			$295.00
	Replace fold out cot			$150.00
	Replace carpeting			$100.00
	Replace wood headliner 			$150.00
	Misc. paint &amp; materiels			$243.00

Including labor, the estimate came out to just under $2,800!!  If this
turns out OK, I will have a very, very nice Bus!

The guy doing the work says it will be a very ambitious project (gulp!).
He's been doing work on VW's since the late '60's, but has never seen one
with the kind of damage mine has.  He seems confident that it will work
out, though.  My problem is that I'm new to the area, and I don't know
this guy from Adam.  I'm pretty much at his mercy (gulp, gulp!).  I could
check around for other shops, but I don't know anything about any of them.
Anyone from Arizona know of Carroll's foreign auto in Glendale (near
Phoenix)?

Fingers crossed; I'll let everyone know how this turns out.

BTW, the car shipper to avoid at all costs is Desert Auto Transport of
Phoenix!
