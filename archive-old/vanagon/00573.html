&gt; Water under the front of the Van!?!  No, really I have had three - count 'em
&gt; - three leaks on my '84's radiator (time to save for a new one).
&gt; 
        Excellent explaination of the radiator removal and test/fix for leaks 
	deleted.

&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps someone!!!

Excellent article Hank.  I don't think I need to ask Joel to put this in the
FAQ database.  It'll sure beat going to the dealer and bending. ;)
