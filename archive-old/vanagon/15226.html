Thanks to everyone who showed up for our bash to make it
such a success.  I think we all had a great time video
viewing, snapshot looking, and last but not least,
emptying some 30+ bottles of beer.  At least the
group's reputation is constant.  :)  Thanks to all
for the tremendous gourmet culinary contributions!
