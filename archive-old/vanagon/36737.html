Thanks for your letter.
&gt;
&gt;VW's thinking of putting a different engine in the Eurovan?  The Eurovan
&gt;is the new Vanagon.

Not even close!

  Just like the Golf is effectively the new Beetle.
&gt;The Jetta is the new Super Beetle.

Again, nope.
&gt;
&gt;Why would VW bring back an obsolete vehicle?

I don't think the Vanagon's obsolete by any standards.  It's just VW is
tring to compete, very poorly, with the Big three Mini van's.  Front wheel
drives the big thing. Even in Europe. But with VW's base prices about 5K
more than the others why would anyone buy a VW.  I can buy a caravan for
about 18K, with big HP V6 and lots of extra's. I'm just to loyal to VW to
buy into the Caravan market. New VW's look to much like every other car on
the road.  Besides, the Beetle design was old in the 1950's but they kept
on making them, and still do in Mexico and Brazil, until 1979. Just because
somethings old doesn't mean you throw it away. The Concept 1 is a 'rebirth'
of the beetle with refinements.  The Vanagon was the last,best, refinement
of the original Microbus. Eurovans are just tryin' to keep up with the
Jone's.

.  VW's American organization is too
&gt;dumb to know how to sell it maybe...

On this we both can agree.


I'm also told that back in '83 VW was almost ready to installed a modified
In-line 4 into the Vanagon,this would have been the smartest thing they
could have done, but somehow ended up with the patents and rights the Scats
watercooled flat-4 design. The person that told me this said that the new
Vanagon would be a US only  Car, like the concept 1.  Thanks again.  That
was my 2 cents.  Take care.
