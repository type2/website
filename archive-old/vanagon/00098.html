Subject: Re: Summary of Door rubber 

&gt;From: Mitch Hendrickson &lt;mitchh_at_hops.gvg.tek_dot_com&gt;
&gt;To: cchubb_at_ida_dot_org
&gt;cc&gt; Next on the project list: The granddaddy of all rubber---The
&gt;cc&gt; sliding door seal. (And mabye a new windsheild gasket too.) But
&gt;cc&gt; first those cylinder heads.
&gt;
&gt;Oh my!  If you should find a cheap acceptable source for those (even
&gt;Whitney wants hundreds of dollars, as I recall), we'll be glad to hear
&gt;it.  Me? I'm thinking hard about fabricating something myself....
&gt;

I have listed in my current copy that the '68-'79 Price for the cargo
door rubber is $38.00. It is only the earlier, 7 piece set that
will cost a significant portion of your life savings. I hear, and
have examined my door to reveal, that the cargo door is MUCH tougher,
becasue it goes in some kind of groove/clips most of the way around.
Harder than just slipping it in the notch like on the front doors.

If you still want to fabricate something, JCW sells some 'rubber
weatherstripping by the foot' that is kinda generic/'70s American.
I had some before, for an unrelated project, and it was of good
quality, and VERY close to the door weatherstripping. The problem
I have with going this method is that there is not enough of the
oringinal rubber left to see what the cross section would look 
like.
