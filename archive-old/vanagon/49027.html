Subject: autotrans '85 Q?: reliability

Hi folks, it's masochist night..  now that I've bought an '85 with autotrans
can I hear every bad luck tale of woe ever about these things, as well as
any positive info?  Maintainence needs?  Flushing (the trans, not NY) Weak
links: flex plate? Driveability/mileage? Email me direct and I will
summarize all replies (any?) and post the result.  Many thanks, tim
