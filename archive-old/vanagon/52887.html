Derek,

It sounds like it could be a pretty well known problem.

Check the second service bulletin on the pages Skip maintains:
http://killer-whale.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/bulletins.html

If this is your problem, its an easy fix, either with a VW part 
($100) or some homegrown solutions discussed in the archives.

Good luck,

Tom F.
