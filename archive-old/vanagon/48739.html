Subject: Re: Head Count! BBTA next week!

Unfortunately, we will only be able to attend Busses by the Arch on
Saturday, having to leave before dinner/BBQ time. For Sunday night,
though, we're thinking that it might be nice if members from both
lists could all meet in St.Louis's main activity place, the &quot;Loop&quot;
area, for beer and burgers at Blueberry Hill. I imagine that, by then,
some of you will have grown a tad weary of the (probably soaked and
muddy :)  campground. 

The Loop is St.Louis's &quot;in&quot; place, very hip, very pleasant; it has
plenty of bars, cafes, restaurants, art galleries, and also Tivoli's,
the restored Art Nouveau movie theatre. The Loop is at the 6500 block
of Delmar Blvd. Send me an e-mail if you're interested in such a
get-together and/or if you need directions. 

We can discuss details on Saturday. Also, if you would like my
cellphone number (in case of emergencies, if you get lost, or just
want to say hi), send me an e-mail at dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu.

Sami ('75 Westf.)

PS: I suggest we use David Schwarze's &quot;Da Boat&quot; as a meeting point at
BBTA.  His blue '74 Safare high-top definitely stands out. :)  David?
