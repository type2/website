&gt;Boy, that sure sounds tempting...  Does it have the original bumpers?
&gt;Are the wheelwells cut?  Any rust?  How are the gates?

Original front blade only. Wheelwells are untouched. And the only rust on
the whole vehicle is located on the gates, at the hinges.

However, as clean and presentable as this truck is (hey, remember, I've
loved it---mechanically AND emotionally---for the past ten years) I
wouldn't recommend making a dash out here from Kansas to inspect it.

I'd appreciate it, however, if you'd pass the word on to your colleges whom
might be located a wee bit closer to California.
