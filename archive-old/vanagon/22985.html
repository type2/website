&gt;	Finally, the document (this is starting to sound like The
&gt;Celistine Prophesy...) describes rubber-bag car-jacks, operated
&gt;by engine exhaust. Lay it under the car, connect to the exhaust,
&gt;run engine, raise car, close valve, change tire or whatever. 
&gt;Sylvia Plath jokes optional. A regular jack is certainly simpler,
&gt;probably faster and likely safer, but what a cool idea! Has anyone
&gt;ever seen one for sale? 

A friend of mine has one for his RangeRover. They are intended for off-road 
use where the ground is too soft or uneven to use a regular jack, the bag 
spreads the load over a big area.
