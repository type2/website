Subject: Re: Relabeled Non-VWs

hmm...thinking of the VW logo wired onto the grill reminds me of my own 
situation....

when i moved into this house ther was a mercades emblem haging in the 
garage..you know, the size of the VW logo on a bug..well, cince the vw 
emblem hanges on teh rearview, &lt;PO's addept at decroming..filled the 
holes, i never got around to anything..etc..&gt;, i figured why not?!, and 
imidiatly setabout wireing the mercades chrome onto the hood (bonnet) of 
my poor decrepit bug...everyone loves it...

&gt; &gt; I passed one of these today on I495 (DC Beltway) and suspect it was
&gt; &gt; someone with a weird sense of humor.  Looked like the various logos off
&gt; &gt; of a vanagon.  Had a VW vinyl cover for the spare tire as well.
&gt; 
&gt; I passed an older Buick back in the winter with a VW bus (chrome) logo
&gt; wired to the grill. (The Arkansas version of the above story) All I
&gt; could think was that a) this yahoo has an old broke-down bus parked in 
&gt; the woods somewhere. b) some poor slob is now missing his chrome
&gt; emblem. 
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I think it was Clinton's brother driving ;) Joe
