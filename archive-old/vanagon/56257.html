Subject: source for Aux. battery

I'd like to put a 2nd battery into my 85 Westy and have learned
that deep-cycle batteries are better for running accessories than
the standard car batteries.  The FAQ and archives have been helpful
but I can't find a source for such a battery that fits in the
compartment for the 2nd battery under the driver's seat.  I don't
really want to modify the seat or compartment to fit a larger battery.

Can anyone give me the name/model for a deep-cycle battery that fits?

Thanks
Don
