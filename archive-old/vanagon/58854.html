Does anyone have any more info on the Neuspeed city lights?  They sound =
pretty neat.

Also, I am the original owner of my 87 GL Wolfsburg w/ Alloy wheels. I =
have a steel wheel for the spare tire.  It seems as though a lot of you =
have an alloy wheel for you spares.  Does any one know if mine should =
have come with an alloy spare?



Thanks
