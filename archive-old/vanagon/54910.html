Did you replace the fuel filter when you replaced the pump?

Have you checked the vacuum lines?

Can you refresh my memory on it's exact behavior?  Especially on
no-starts? i.e. does it turnover but not catch, can you hear the pump
hum, does it do nothing?  When it misses, does it cough-sputter-chug and
gradually die or what?  I remember a grimlin-inhabited van, but not the
details!
