Subject: sliding door swivel hinge

I was just on Demented Dworkin's Used Bus Bits web page, and saw a couple 
people requesting this part for thier breadloaf.  What is is?  Is it the 
spring loaded thing at the rear of the door that pushes the door away 
from the body?  And what goes wrong with it?

On the subject of sliding doors, mine wasn't opening very well.  I 
noticed that the little wheels weren't turning, so I cleaned and lubed 
them up.  Works great now, the door pops right open.
