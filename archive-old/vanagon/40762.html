for what it's worth...

Bell 47's w/ Lycomings are the &quot;MASH&quot; helo's with the steel tube tail structure.
Hiller 12's look similar but have an aluminum monocoque tail and have
Franklin Engines.
both engines are 6 cyl vertical opposed.  flat/opposed engines are the norm
in general aviation aircraft.

Dr. Ferdy's aviation roots are pretty evident in his people's car, eh?

&gt;     They were Hillers with, I believe, Lycoming(sp?) engines... air cooled.
