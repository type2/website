Jim -

The only visible distinction is the air intake for the engine.
1980 was the only year that did NOT have a plastic vent cover.

- Jeff
'80 Westi

&gt; Does anyone know of any visible distinctions between the 1980 &amp; 1981
&gt; Vanagons?  I mean if one were to see a 1980 or 81 driving down the street,
&gt; how could you tell which year it was?
