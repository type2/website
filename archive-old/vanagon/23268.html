Subject: Re: Pilot Bearing



To All:

Time: Summer, 1949
Place:  400 West Avenue,
            Turlock, California

Me:   Why do they call it a pilot bearing?
Dad:  Because you have to 'fly' the tranny shaft in there.  (said with a
straight face)
Grandfather:  Because a pilot is a guide.  It guides the mainshaft into
alignment with the clutch.  (And threw a greasy rag at my dad, who caught it,
laughing.)
