Subject: '84 1.9L rebuild fears
Date: Wed, 6 Nov 1996 17:41:54 +0000

   I am finishing up reinstalling my 1.9L after rebuilding and am hoping for
good compression and separation of coolant and oil.

   When I purchased new piston rings I asked why so expensive and my local
VW parts distributor recommended a Brazilian equivalent which I purchased
and are now installed. Now, I am having second thoughts.  I'd be a bit more
content if I felt more resistence when I turn my rebuilt engine over by
hand. Does anyone know if VW Brazil made vehicles with 1.9L engines?  Could
piston rings from Brazil really be an equivalent for the 1.9L?  

   Wish me luck. I may be attempting to start this engine tomorrow.

New parts include: main and rod bearings, lifters, camshaft and bearings,
crankshaft shims.

Thanks to all for the input on this project,
