Dave,

	I have a bunch of pix of various stages of my bus, but alas no scanner.
If I sent them to you, could you scan them and post them to the ftp site?

	I wish the trip were a a month later.  I'm real close to having my 
bus running, but it would be a major squeeze to get it done by the 6th.

Thom
