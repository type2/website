&gt;Now a question...  My Vanagon is a &quot;GL&quot; and I know this must signify
&gt;something as my insurance company charges me higher rates for the
&gt;privlidge of having those two letters on the back of my bus, but I
&gt;don't have any idea what they signify.  Could someone enlighten me?
&gt;
&gt;

Basically, it indicates a higher level of trim.  You have caroeted floors
instead if rubber mats,  velour or cloth seats instead of vinyl, and all the
metal inside the van is covered with headliner type material, etc.  GL does
not indicate any improvements in the drive train unfortunately.  In 85, you
should have a tachometer and power steering as part of the GL package.
