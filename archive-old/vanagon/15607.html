So leo mulvihill says:
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to say it, but you can tow a nice trailer with a Caravan/Voyager 
&gt; and still beat a Vanagon up the hill

That may be, but it's still more of a pain in that ass (IMHO) than my 
'91 vanagon GL.  What's the point of taken the trip?  To get there as
fast as you can or to enjoy the drive on the way?
