Subject: Replacing Throttle Switch

I gather from the comments I got on the slight backfiring that my '85 is
doing while coasting that my throttle switch is no longer working.  This
makes sense because part of the time I have owned it, it was hanging loose
and I didn't know what it went to.  When I found out what it was, I had my
mechanic reattach it when he was doing some other work for me.

My question is this--mine is the single switch model, and it is now
invisible--does it mount below the throttle?  The only arrangement I have
seen intact is an '84 that has two switches mounted at the top.  Do I need
to remove the throttle housing to get to this.  Bentley shows only the two
switch arrangement in pictures.
