&gt;Subject: Horn &amp; Backfire

&gt;Also, my bus has started to backfire some.  What causes a backfire?

&gt;Any responses would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;Thanks,

Doug,

My first response would be BEEP!

But seriously, if you are getting good horn when you ground
the wire to the column and not when you hit the button
something simple is awry.  This is on your '65 right?  The
wire that comes up through the column should fasten to the
horn button with a small set screw in the middle of the
button.  All the button does is ground that connection to
the steering column (which you confirm works).  If you're
not getting horn then you are getting no connection between
the horn button ring and the column when you press it.

I don't have one in front of me at the moment, but the horn
button is little more than a brass ring held in place by a
spring and a clip if I recall correctly.  One of those
pieces grounds to the steering column when you press the
button.  Is the horn button corroded or greasy inside?
Either of those might prevent conductivity.  Maybe when I
get home from the office I'll pull one of mine for more
specifics.

As to the backfire problem, my first guess would be to check
your timing and make sure your distributor is tight.
