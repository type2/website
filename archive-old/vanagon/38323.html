Subject: My Vanagon has new engine! Now it's time to deal with linkage!

My '85 now has a brand new 1.9 Litre, and now I am $3,600 poorer.  I got the
factory remanufactured job, new clutch kit, new radiator expansion tank,
water pump and some hoses.  It runs really sweetly now--much quieter with
noticeably more power (and no more overflowing radiator refill tank).  I'm
pretty happy with it.

My next problem is the shift linkage.  This seemed to coincide with the
change over to synthetic tranny oil but that may be only coincidence.  First
has to be engaged slightly depressing the shift lever, second sometimes is
blocked also until you push down.  Once the transmission is in gear it seems
fine, no popping out, no unusual noises.  When the van is cold the shifts
don't seem to be blocked.  Any suggestions?  I looked in Bentley for the
adjustment procedure and it looks easy enough but the instructions seem vague.
