This sounds reasonable, but the fluid seems to go just as far as the
intake tube for the clutch master possibly ruling out (I hope) a leak into
the vacuum diaphragm. In the event that either the clutch,
master or clutch slave ARE leaking what is involved? A simple rebuild,
new master etc etc...? TIA -- DC
