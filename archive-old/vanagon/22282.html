All this talk about Arlo Guthrie and missing coolant has sent me into 
the old &quot;way back machine&quot;...I remember one night my very blue collar
dad took me to the local drive in for no special reason;  special for the
pop-corn and the company,  yes,  but a real weird double feature.

Imagine being around ten and watching &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;  followed
by &quot;Alices' Resturant&quot; with your dad at the local drive inn.  I do 
beleave that I had a profound change of life that night in the front
seat of the old Volvo 122,  and a strange new view of my dad.

Now for the coolant...'83 1.9 litre wasser boxer...great runner,  great
looker....no leakage of coolant any where....no &quot;odor&quot; of coolant from
the exhaust...plugs are a little grey {fuel additive}...coolant changed
yearly,  phosphate free.... VW says no leaks and exhaust analyzer shows
a healthy engine...why would I be loosing around 500ml of coolant
every 1500 miles or so???  It has never done this before in its
60K mile life.  Evaporation?  Bastard neighbors messing with my mind?
Am I worrying about nothing?  Help!
