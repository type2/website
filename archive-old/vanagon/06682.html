Steven Johnson (sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com) asked...

&gt;&gt; Hey, I don't remember seeing the 'Samba' name for a T2 VW.  Can you educate
&gt;&gt; me on what it is and why it's called a Samba?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Richard Kurtz
&gt;&gt; &gt; 67 Samba, 64 Deluxe Microbus (under construction)...
&gt;&gt; &gt; 

I don't remember exactly where I first saw/heard the reference.  I have
seen it in a couple of books I have bought recently;

	VW BUS Custom Handbook		VW TRANSPORTER/BUS 1949-67
	Laurence Meredith		Walter Zeichner
	Bay View Books			Schiffer Publishing Ltd
	ISBN 1-870979-47-8		ISBN 0-88740-196-1

The Samba is the Deluxe Microbus with Sunroof and Roof-line windows.
It was the very top of the line model, with the Deluxe trim, two-toned
paint, luggage bars (jail bars) in the back.  It was introduced in 1951
at the International Automobile Exhibition, April 19-29, 1951, and went
into production in June 1951, and continued through the 1967 model
year.  Up to 1963 it had 23 windows, but from 1964-1967 two back corner
windows were eliminated, hence the 21-window Deluxe Microbus.

As to the name, Samba, I can only guess.  The advertising I've seen in
Walter Zeichner's book calls it the &quot;Sonder-Modell&quot;, or Special-Model.
My guess is that Samba is a shortened Sonder-Modell.
