Mark,
I have experienced the same symptom on two separate occasions in the past
which turned out to be a failed cat converters. The cats had broken up inside.
A piece of the stuff actually would intermittently block the output end of the
cat resulting in a loss of power. The van wouldn't get over about 45MPH. When
I would stop to looking things over and RPMs dropped to idle the chunk of stuff
would drop back into the cat making everything seem fine.  It was a hard one to
diagnose as it ran fine at idle when I was checking things out.  There are lots
of things which can cause your described problem but this might be worth a look.
