I found out very late in life how easy and cheap it is to have the edges of a
swatch of carpet bound.  The carpet store will have a couple colors, and black
is always in good taste.  Binding will make your custom-cut remnant look great,
even if your cutting looks like beavers gnawed it.  Only remaining problem is
having to buy 5x12 when you need 5x5.5.  And deciding which of the five browns
in the Vanagon interior you want to match.
