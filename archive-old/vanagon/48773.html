&gt;Help!
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone removed the front heater blower motor.

I exchanged one from an aircooled version into a
watercooled version. 8 hours reassembling, 8 hours
assembling the whole dashboard/heater.

&gt; I have
&gt;managed to loosen the screws that secure the unit.  It
&gt;appears that the cooling hoses must be disconnected as
&gt;well the as the upper dash panel before the assembly can
&gt;be removed and disassembled to remove the blower motor.
&gt;Can anyone confirm this?

First remove the dashboard, disconnect the cooling hoses
from the heater and remove the whole heaterbox.

&gt;  Also, does the steering column
&gt;need to be disconnected to raise the dash up enough to
&gt;slide out the assembly?

I had no tools to remove the two screws connecting
the steering column with the dashboard. I disassembled
the steering column near the pedals and the steering
column support near the windshield (two screws under! the
dashboard).

&gt;Would appreciate any advice and assistance.  I looked for
&gt;advice in the archives, but could not find anything.

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Fred
