Sorry to ask dumb questions, but I just got my 86 GL ( my first VW, but for
sure not my last) and haven't got a Bentley manual yet, my clutch seems to
be quite soft and engages very low, there was a new clutch put in about 10k
ago. Am I dealing with a hydraulic clutch system that needs fluid? If so,
where is the fill located and what type of fluid does it use? I looked last
night to no avail. Couldn't find the Brake master cylinder either. any
input any of you fellow v-dub heads have would be greatly appreciated.
