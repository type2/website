While we're on the subject of State confiscation of private property,
here's a little charmer from the Glorious People's Republic of New Jersey.

Chris?  Any comments on this?

&gt;OK, Patriots, listen up. I just saw this posted on some bulletin
&gt;board at my place of work. Some here may already know about it. Most
&gt;probably don't. Whether it's true or not...well, it sounds pretty real
&gt;to me. Anyway, here is a verbatim transcript:
&gt;
&gt;                    ATTENTION ALL MOTOR VEHICLE OWNERS
&gt;
&gt;                Millions Of Vehicles To Be Affected By New
&gt;                        VEHICLE CONFISCATION LAW
&gt;
&gt;On June 2, 1995, Governor Whitman signed legislation #SCS-1700. It is
&gt;NOW LAW, and will be fully implemented against all New Jersey car and
&gt;truck owners as soon as the necessary testing facilities and remote
&gt;monitoring stations are constructed - expected sometime in 1996-97.
&gt;Briefly, SCS-1700 states the following:
&gt;
&gt;All motor vehicles over four years old will be required to report to
&gt;new CENTRALIZED TESTING FACILITIES for &quot;ENHANCED EMISSIONS
&gt;INSPECTIONS&quot;. If your car or truck fails this test - the vehicle MUST
&gt;be taken off the road. Only three percent of those vehicles failing the
&gt;test and having already spent a minimum of $450 for repairs will be
&gt;granted a waiver allowing them to remain on the road for two more
&gt;years. You have no appeal and no other options.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;                            NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS
&gt;
&gt;Motor vehicle inspections will cost $24. The I/M ENHANCED EMISSIONS
&gt;TEST, in which an operator &quot;drives&quot; your car through a simulated
&gt;dynamometer road test, is DESIGNED TO FAIL 60% OF ALL CARS, this
&gt;according to the EPA. Almost no vehicles over 10 years old are expected
&gt;to pass. You have no protection against damage or the destruction of
&gt;your vehicle by such stress testing methods. 97% of those vehicles
&gt;failing the new enhanced emissions test will have their registration
&gt;renewal automatically denied by the state. Such vehicles cannot be sold
&gt;to any other individual or dealer and essentially become FORFEITED TO
&gt;THE STATE... which will receive &quot;pollution credits&quot; they can sell to
&gt;industrial polluters for every vehicle they take off the road. Owners
&gt;of failed vehicles must surrender their license plates within 45
&gt;days...and since NJ law already prohibits you from having an
&gt;unregistered vehicle on your own property, local law enforcement can
&gt;then seize it at will. Assisting it in this effort, NJ DEP recently
&gt;revised the state's definition of &quot;quasi-public&quot; to include ALL
&gt;RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAYS AND PARKING LOTS&quot; - Yes, you've also lost your
&gt;private property rights!
&gt;
&gt;Repairs can only be attempted by a STATE CERTIFIED REPAIR FACILITY...to
&gt;which you have no say about work quality or cost. You can no longer
&gt;legally perform emissions related repairs yourself, nor can you take it
&gt;to your trusted mechanic (unless they first receive state certification
&gt;and invest $100,000 in equipment).
&gt;
&gt;As part of SCS-1700, roadblocks will be established throughout the
&gt;state to randomly test a percentage of all vehicles. Automated sensing
&gt;devices will be installed along New Jersey highways to monitor your
&gt;vehicle's emissions as you drive by. Violators of the new emission
&gt;standards will have their license plates PHOTOGRAPHED; thus enabling
&gt;the state to issue summonses through the mail. Severe penalties, fines,
&gt;and jail time have been attached to all violations of this new
&gt;legislation. In fact, the state will begin kicking back a commission to
&gt;local police for their help in seizing your car!
&gt;
&gt;Remember, SCS-1700 is aimed at TAKING YOUR CAR OFF THE ROAD! It is
&gt;aimed at producing one car families. Collector, hot rod, and hobbyist
&gt;cars are history. A spare car for local trips, a teenage driver,
&gt;student, or the commuter park and ride is history. That classic Mustang
&gt;convertible has been redefined as a &quot;gross polluter&quot; and is now
&gt;targeted by the state for the crusher. Many car and truck related
&gt;businesses will suffer or fail. Ironically, state officials are
&gt;recommending you start saving your money now to buy a new car-an
&gt;impossibility for most individuals given our current local tax burden
&gt;of around 50%.
&gt;
&gt;The issue here is ever increasing government controlling not only your
&gt;mobility, your life and your freedom, but even your ability to work and
&gt;earn a living. It has almost nothing to do wih clean air. Remember that
&gt;you have NO LEGAL RIGHT TO DRIVE in this state. New Jersey considers it
&gt;their PRIVILEGE to allow you to drive on their roads...and starting
&gt;sometime in 1996 they will be taking it back. As stated by EPA Region 8
&gt;administrator William Yellowtail, &quot;Cleaning up cars and the roads is
&gt;only half the solution...the much more difficult half involves getting
&gt;people out of their cars.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sound far fetched? Can't happen? Remind you of a Soviet or Nazi style
&gt;police state? FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. Call Legislative Services at
&gt;800-792-8630 and ask for a free copy of SCS-1700. Ask for your
&gt;legislator's phone number and voice your concern. Call DMV Director
&gt;Dick Kamin at 609-984-9827 and request all administrative and DEP
&gt;requlations associated with SCS-1700. Call Governor Whitman at
&gt;609-292-6000. Ask for a repeal of this horrendous legislation. Most
&gt;importantly-SPREAD THE WORD! Copy and distribute this flyer everywhere.
&gt;Fax it to business associates. Warn your friends. Till now, you've
&gt;heard very few details regarding SCS-1700...since politicians
&gt;desperately want to keep the nightmare they rammed through the
&gt;legislature quiet until after you reelect them. Remember this election
&gt;day that you finally have alternatives to the two party system that
&gt;once again stomped all over your rights...and VOTE!
&gt;
&gt;            TODAY NEW JERSEY.....TOMORROW YOUR STATE!!!
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    Well, there it all is. Sounds pretty rude to me. Maybe things are
&gt;  starting to heat up. I'm really surprised that anyone would vote
&gt;  for this kind of storm-trooper legislation. But apparently some
&gt;  people have. Wouldn't it be ironic if the next American
&gt;  Revolution is the result of the confiscation of the one thing that
&gt;  provides most of us with what little freedom we have left...
