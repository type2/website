Someone mentioned how they thought my idea of a power supply fan would
be ineffective.  Well I tested it by using a 9V battery, and blowing 
thru an 18 foot linoleum roll.  The result?  Pretty darn good, and 
prolly a bit better than the amount of air you get up an the windsheild
of a split window bus anyway.  So I'm going to go ahead with my plan.
The only difficult part will be finding scraps of pipe to use - I don't
wanna but a who length just for this experiment!

Also, I bought another very small fan to use with the fridge on the
inside, and another, temperature sensitive one to use on the coils.  Now
I just gotta get some wire and a thermometer to finish setting it and and 
conduct some tests.  Specifically, how long it takes to cool a six pack :)
