Subject:       CB radio coolant warning light (for real!)

Did y'all know that an ungrounded, clamp-on, gutter mounted CB
antenna will activate the warning buzzer and flash the
coolant light when transmitting?!!?  I had removed the little, sharp
grounding screws on the clamp-on antenna to save the paint. spurious
emissions were the result.

to fix it  i just crumpled some aluminum foil in the gutter clamp and
it worked fine then.  wierd.  wonder what the ECU thought of all that
RF voltage floating around??
