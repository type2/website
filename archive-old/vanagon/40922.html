&gt;What exactly does the drag co-efficient number mean?  I have figured

&gt;Thanks oh ye guru's of air flow.

&lt;grin&gt; Man, are you ever barking up the wrong tree! Ask Maher or Hoover.
Ask me a question I might know the answer to, such as

&quot;How does one cultivate a lawn with lots of weeds in it?&quot;

--Ken  &lt;-First yearly session with the lawn mower today. Sucks.
