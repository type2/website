Subject: RE: here's who's what: 1952-1967 buses

and to think i was in oz' in 91' and didn't get a split bus! Too bad they
are RHD. I must confess a certain affinity to old Holdens too (Are the
middle 60's one's called E-types, or am I getting mixed up w/ Jag's)

&gt;&gt;Oh it's just to good to be true.

&gt;
&gt;OH duhhhhhhhh!  Don't forget that any Aussie on the split list is also RHD!
&gt;
&gt;I doubt anyone could match a Devon camper conversion though (gnash!)
&gt;
&gt;Another AUS strangeness is that whilst anything Karmann is extremely rare there
&gt;are LOTS of splits and early bugs around (and not worth much at all - i.e.,
&gt;they are not yet considered collectible).  It is not that unusual to see these
&gt;vehicles in basically sound condition (and rust free) being sold for $300 -
&gt;$1000 Australian.
