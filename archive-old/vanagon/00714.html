Subject:      buses by the arch &amp; blatant LiMBO plug

buses by the arch is a get-together put on by LiMBO (Late Model Buses Owners,
international) and NEATO (North-East Association of Transporter Owners).
LiMBO is for 1968-1979 Buses, 1980-1991 Vanagons, and 1992-? Eurovans. they
put out a newsletter every other month with helpful hints and pictures and
stuff (ads for t-shirts, parts, buses for sale, all that sort of stuff).

NEATO is for the 1949-1967 split-windshield buses (the north-east version of
SOTO).

anyhoo, twice a year, these yahoos get together near St. Louis, MO, to mix
and mingle with other bus types. it's in O'Fallon, MO ... Ft. Zumwalt?? some
sort of park. and the next exciting Gathering of the Buses is due on 27-29
May, 1994 ... just three weeks off. &lt;i haven't gotten my SASE back yet!! :( &gt;
if you are interested, send a Self-Addressed Stamped Envelope to:
Buses by the Arch 6
1514 Wild Goose Run
St. Charles, MO 63303

it's not as immediate feedback as this list, but it's neat to be able to
see other people's buses and what they've done to/with them. :)
