Subject: Gas leak  HELP me please

Hi, I have a gas leak . I can see the spot on the ground(getting bigger)
but can't find the leak. I checked the overflow tanks and tubing but  it
is ok. If you are under the van and look at the passenger side support
strap it is wet with gas but I CANT FIND THE LEAK!!!!!! PLEASE help me
before I go insane or WORSE like blow up. Thank you

You may have the infamous &quot;rusted tunnel&quot; problem.  What happens is the
trough that the front heater duct runs through rusts through over time,
resulting in gas leaks when the tank's been topped off or the van's been
jostled a bit.

If this is the case, your only alternative is to swap tanks.  But before
you do that, if at all possible, check all the lines you can see/feel for
cracks/breaks.  The only way to really check your tank is to drop it,
since there are vent lines on top you can't get to without dropping the
tank.

Sorry.  I had to drop mine 6 times before I figured out the problem.  The
trough was coated with a 1/4&quot; layer of dirt that I (repeatedly) mistook
for the tank surface.  Rust had made a fine home underneath the dirt and
ate through the tank over time.

Someone's got an old post of mine that details the whole procedure for
dropping the tank.  It may possibly be on Ron's site, I can't recall.  If
you need a copy let me know and I'll dig it out.

Good luck,
Jack
