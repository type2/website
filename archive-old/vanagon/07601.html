Subject: Low Coolant in fill tank...:(
Date: Mon, 5 Dec 94 10:21:09 PST

With all this discussion about coolant changing and jacking
the car up at both ends I decided to check my coolant level
this morning along with the oil check.  Lo and behold there
was no coolant in the excess fill tank (not expansion tank)
I didn't have time to check the expansion tank and just filled
the excess tank back up and hoped that I didn't get too much
air into the system.  I think the loss of coolant is linked
to the cold weather and hence the use of the aux heater.  And
you know what that lead's to.  The dreaded leaking aux. heater.
I'll be checking that out tonight as well has bleeding the 
cooling system to get rid of any air bubble nasties.

Any suggestions as to the bleeding procedure other than to
jack the front end up?  Do I just open the bleeder valve in
front, or is there other things I need to do to bleed this
system properly?  

Oh.  I'm talking about a '91 GL Camper here.
