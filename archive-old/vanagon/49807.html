Subject:  rebuild again? 

well, i have 1000 miles on a rebuild now (top end), and i''m hearing the
same symptoms that i heard 1000 miles after the previous rebuild
(complete), and that is a chirping sound on acceleration.  it only happens
in neutral at the moment, but if past experience proves worth anything, it
will soon move to first, then second and third.  it sounds exactly like it did
when i had a dropped valve seat.

background:  full rebuild by mechanic (has done 5 other rebuilds of
air-cooled vanagons this summer alone, has been doing this for many
many years) in june, drove 3000 miles, heard chirping and lost major
power, mechanic said valves were not seating.  sent heads back to
mark stephens, they did a valve job, replaced exhaust guides, and flycut
heads (no charge except shipping, although what i really wanted was a
different set of heads). 2nd rebuild done earlier this month, 1000 miles on
it now, seems to be starting with same symptoms as rebuild last time. 
after the rebuild this time, i took it to another mechanic to make sure
valves were initially set properly and they were.

the dilemma:  i need to move from michigan to oregon next tuesday one
way or another, as i have accepted a job there.   i could convoy with my
brother in his 88 and draft him the whole way and hope for the best.  i'm
wanting some other perspectives on this, any ideas on what is
happening? my feeling is that the heads are in some way defective. if
that is the case,  i hope mark stephens stands behind them - what good
is a 100,000 mile valve seat warranty if things aren't right in the first
place?  dennis suggested after the first rebuild that the case might be
worn and the heads were not sealing properly to the surface, and the
metal shim in between was vibrating like a reed.  mechanic didn't seem to
think this was the case the first time.  any other ideas or experience
would be much appreciated, i'm kinda stressed about this, not to mention
the fact that i didn't even have the $$ for the second rebuild, and
certainly not a third.  the mechanic warranties his work, but since he
says it is the heads (which i supplied through mark stephens) i have to
pay for any further work.

thanks, matthew
