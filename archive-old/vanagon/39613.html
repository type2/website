Subject: Shocks..are these good ones?

hey now,

after spending all morning looking for some shop that had shocks that would fit
my van and not liking the prices they gave me, i've decided to do them myself.
it can't be that hard...right? :-) anyways, i was looking at JC Whitney's
catalog and say some._dot_can't remember the name...Gasomething..not gabrielle..
hehehe, gas shocks, about 19.95 each. anyone have a jc whitney catalog handy?
anyone know about these shocks?
