Subject: more stickers


Listies - I just received my beautiful oval, silver stickers from
Richard Palmer a few days ago.  I like them so much, that I'm ordering
some more, and I urge those of you who haven't done so, to order.  Or
those of you who think you can never get too much of a good thing,
to do so as well.  :) I think Richard still has around 200 left.
