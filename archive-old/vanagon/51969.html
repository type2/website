Hi Everyone.  A few weeks ago I mail ordered something from the US, 
and today I got a card in my mailbox for a parcel.  GREAT, I think!

I ordered some auto parts from Connecticut for $35.00 US.  Canada 
Customs wrote me up for the following:

Value:  $35.00 US X 1.3316 = $46.61 CDN
Duty:                 $0.84 
GST:                  $3.32
Handling fee:     $5.00
Total Payable:  $9.16

Ironically, I ordered the EXACT same thing EXACTLY a year ago, and 
none of these charges were applied.  

So, fellow Canucks, be aware of the tax man when ordering from 
outside of Canada.  I am a little confused as to why I have to pay 
GST for something that wasn't purchased in Canada.  Hmmm....

Harry.
