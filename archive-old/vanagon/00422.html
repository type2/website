Hello all,
		Many thanks for the generous responses.

&gt;From DAVE:)
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an idea that I have been turning over for a few years.  In my motor,
&gt; there is an unused pulley behind the fan housing.  It was originally used
&gt; to drive the A/C compressor.  I have been toying with the idea of mounting
&gt; a second (55 amp) alternator where the A/C compressor was and driving it
&gt; with this pulley.  That would (theoretically) give me 110 amps, and with
&gt; 3 large batteries in my bus, I could use it :)  What do you think?

BINGO BINGO BINGO 
I just wanted to hear someone else say it. I think a little fabrication here
and there and this would work perfectly. I just removed the ac stuff and
was thinking of converting it into a fancy shmancy heater, but I'll ask
more about that later.

With regard to the ammeter, I want to find one with a digital sender ($$$)
so that I can keep track up front. (ANY IDEAS?) I also want to have a 
seperate reading for each circuit (ala Aircraft technology). Anybody
have an address for aircraft/boat sales places; I don't find alot of
this stuff in Iowa.
