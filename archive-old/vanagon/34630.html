A friend of mine is considering buying a '61 kombi.  The body is apparently
immaculate, but he's troubled that it *might* be underpowered.  I stiffled a
snicker and said  &quot;That's the way it is, man&quot;, but he wants me to find out
how easy it is to swap engines with, say, a later model breadloaf. (I'm
pretty sure he'd want to keep it a VW engine) I DON't think he's into
modifying the current (36hp, right?) engine.  I poked around the archives
and FAQs and couldn't come up with an answer for him.  Any comments?  He's
also wondering how much extra power the reduction boxes will take . . .?

the 61 would have come new with a 40hp motor.   What is ACTUALLY in in I
cannot say - look at the case number at the base of the generator pedeestal
and check it in the back of the Idoit Book.

as to swapping, is is easy to pop in a later bug motor or any upright bus
motor.  The AE or AK cases with dual oil pressure relief have larger oil
passages and thus are sturdier.   The same motor in a split gives you more
pep than in a bay window as it is a lighter, nimbler beast.  dual port heads
crack, and motors bigger than 1600 have less life (on a 1600 case) but that
my own personal biased opinion, if you want to sacrifice durability for
power, go ahead.

in order to hook up the heat well, you will want the motor to have the
smaller diameter heater boxes, to match the bus.  Hopefully the engine in the
bus has them. 

If your friend doesnt want that old slow piece of junk, PLEASE let me know,
 I am looking for a 63 or earlier kombi or microbus  (3 windows on side, with
smaller back door) with a nice body, mechanicals and interior unimportant.
 hm- ought post this to the list just in case.
