Subject: Info Wanted: '66 Bus Cargo Floors

Over the summer I bought a '66 Bus to drive through the fall and restore 
over the winter.  Well, winter is still several months away and I 
couldn't wait to start doing some work.  

The only rust on the Bus is the usual surface rust around the windows and 
some major holes in the cargo floor section (primarily on the passenger 
side).  While the floor itself is in bad shape, the barn doors still 
close solid.  The previous owners idea of fixing it was to put down a 
sheet of plywood followed by linoleum (sp?) followed by shag carpeting.  
What a mess, took most of the day to tear out to figure out all that is 
needed.

To me, it doesn't look too serious.  However, I do need to buy two new 
floor sections (about $220.00 from Wolfsburg West).  

How hard/expensive will this job be?  I do not have any welding 
experience and will have to pay someone else to do it.  Should I find a 
VW shoppe that can handle it or can a welding shoppe do a decent job?

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  This is the only major item 
wrong with the bus and something I can't do by myself.  All other work is 
going great.. reupholstered almost all seats, new carpet is on order, 
just finished the shortblock stage of a new 1600cc engine..  Cool!
