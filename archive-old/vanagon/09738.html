Subject: Idle and Timing

Lately it appears that my van is running too rich.  It idles really rough, and I
just had to replace the cat.  The van seems to idle fine when cold but gets
worse when warm.  I've tried to adjust the idle and timing according to the
Bently manual without any success.  It seems that for some reason I can't
increase the idle.  I can turn the air screw all the way out but the idle only
increases to a point, approximately 900 rpm and will not go any higher.  This is
with the idle stabilizer disconnected.  I've replace just about all the sensors,
ie:  temp, O2 etc, and adjusted the timing with a timing light.  The van seems
to run better when the distributor is turned counter clockwise, but is this
causing it to run richer?  My compression appears fine, approximately 140 lbs on
all cylinders.  Anybody have any thoughts or similiar problems?
