Subject: Other 'ethical', emissions, environmental concerns

&gt;
&gt;&gt;As long as we poor oldie-buffs are willing to keep our &quot;horrible&quot; cars in
&gt;&gt;first-class shape, I hope you will find it in your heart to allow us
&gt;&gt;to do our thing, since in fact we are hurting nothing.

Our task is not easy though folks.  Legal emission standards aren't the only
cause for concern.  Brake bleeding, oil changes, blown oil lines on external
coolers, fuel line work, engines in, engines out, tranny fluid changes,
brake lining asbestos, etc.  There is plenty of opportunity to
'accidentally' dump toxic waste with these vehicles, sometimes it's all I
can do to keep a clean work site.  Sometimes I don't meet even my own
standards.  What do you do with flushed brake fluid for instance?  How bad
an oil leak does it have to be before it should be repaired?  I can't say
I'll be surprised if I end up with skin cancer on my own hands after all
these years.  I just hope my latest engine build doesn't leak, I certainly
spent a great deal of effort trying.  I believe the backyard effect on the
environment is at least as great as the actual driving.
