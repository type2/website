Subject: Clutch problems?

Driving back into London last night, after a weekend away,
I started to get a few problems selecting 1st gear from
neutral. After lots of stick wiggling and a few crunches
I finally made it home - too late to take a look.

Any advice? The clutch cable was replaced about 6 months
ago - do they stretch a little when they're new and if so
is this an easy adjustment job or could this be the
start of something serious. The gear stick may have felt
slightly sloppier than usual - but then again I may have
imagined it.

Words of wisdom please,

Rob.

PS. It's a 76 bus, left-hand drive.
