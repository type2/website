My edition of the Muir book has a little * where it tells you about 
the timing on a '71 bus.  If you read this it says to take it to a 
shop unless you have a timing light.  Let the shop set it, drive it 
home and check where it is timed and mark the pulley right there.  On 
mine it is about 10 deg ATDC.  Myself, I still can't get the thing to 
work with that carb/dist setup.  Of course, it has more terminal 
problems.  My new motor will have Kadrons or some such.  No more 
Solex for me.  Places to check for an air leak include the brake 
booster thing and the little nipple on the left intake manifold.  Did 
you end up hooking up all that altitude stuff?  If so, your problem 
might be in there.  Maybe try bypassing it again.  Let us know.  Jim
