Subject: purchasing a used vanagon

Hi all, 

We're sitting here trying to figure out which is the best year/model
Vanagon to buy.  It will be used primarily as a workhorse for an
independent construction person who totes around a lot of materials,
tools, and a big Rottweiler.

We're in a pretty good market selection-wise (Northern CA) so once the
right range is identified we should be able to find one.  Specifically,
we're curious to know if any models were made for the US with full
paneled sides (no windows) for commerical use.  I know we've seen them
in Europe.  Also, can the top handle a roof rack for lumber?  

Any wisdom/tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Liz Freelund
