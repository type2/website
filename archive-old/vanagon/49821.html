Subject: Re: NEEDED: Reccomendations on FI Manual



&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;if anyone can give me some reccommendations for a manual dealing with Fuel
&gt;Injection..specifically for FI in a VW '77 Westy i'd appreciate it. i'm
&gt;kinda at a lose trying to learn about the FI system.

I have an &quot;AFC Fuel Injection Troubleshooting Manual - Type 2 Model 1976&quot; 
that I picked up at a local VW swap meet for five bucks.  Blue cover, about 
10&quot; square.  Very useful troubleshooting flowcharts specifically for the 
late bus FI. Has been a tremendous timesaver for me. It was published by VW 
and carries a number on the back of 42-00-5955-1.  I suspect it is no 
longer available, but perhaps it is worth checking with the local dealer, 
or as least taking a look at his shop copy if possible.  In any event, I'll 
bet you could find a copy at a VW swap meet.
