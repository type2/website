Subject: need faucet top


I have an '81 westy, and need a replacement part for the very
tip-top of my water faucet (the round, flat black plastic piece).
I tried the dealer, but they said they can no longer get this
part.  Further, they can't even get the whole faucet.  Does
anyone who's replaced their faucet happen to have an extra
lying around?  If not, for those of you who have replaced your
faucets, what did you replace it with?  I have the kind
attached to a DC pump (thanks to BradleyM, who diagnosed
and fixed a leak in my old one this past weekend!), so it
needs to be able to bring up both city or tank water.

TIA
