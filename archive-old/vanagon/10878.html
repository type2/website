&gt;OK, I want to take care of this (I swore, remember?).  What can I do

&gt;and dealing with the problem when it really raises its ugly head?

if you can get the distributor out, and take it apart, so you have the plate
with the stripped-out hole away from everything else (i can't recall if this
can be done), you could delicately (but forcefully) hammer/chisel the edges
of the hole ... by flattening the plate, just around the hole, you'd make the
hole smaller, which might give you enough 'bite' on the screw. you might have
to 're-thread' it, however. this has worked for me before, but not on a
distributor.

good luck!
