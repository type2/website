&gt; I like the idea of a newsgroup.  That way when I go away for the weekend
&gt; I don't have 250 new mail messages waiting for me.  I can easily browse
&gt; a newgroup and look at the threads to see if I am interested.  I think
&gt; that is a major reason why people join a list, get way too many messages
&gt; and then decide to be removed after seeing how much traffic it
&gt; generates.
&gt;
Ditto!! I was going to write the above myself.  Someone told me I could
put a filter on my email to route this list server mail to a separate
folder, but I haven't had any luck yet.  (I'm using Netscape 3) I have
to sort thru email to find the stuff that needs immediate attention
now.  I imagine that's the reason people drop this list.  When I leave
town for a week or two, I have to unsubscribe or I'll have a mess when I
return.  I can always go to the archieves.  
 
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose a list prevents alot of SPAM and unwanted junk mail....
&gt;That's not a real problem.  Just skip it.
