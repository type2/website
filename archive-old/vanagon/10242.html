Subject: Antifreeze smell with heat

I looked at an '87 Vanagon last night (I'm still a wannabus) and smelled that
sweet smell when I turned the heat on.  (I think it was mostly from the
rear heater).  Is this something to be concerned about?

FWIW, it's a 87 GL Wolfsburg with the weekender package, AC, 4spd, 105K mi,
in excellent condition.  Asking 5500$.
