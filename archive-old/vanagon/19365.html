Well, I gone and done it.  Set up a new account for myself at an internet
service provider called teleport, in Portland Oregon.  I moved some of the
VW page over there, but none of the large pics, only the thumbnails.  The
links still work, though, and the text stuff is all there.  There is a
link to this page where my old VW page used to be, or you can get there
directly by going to:

http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw

I hope to have the full size photos and the access counter working
again soon.
