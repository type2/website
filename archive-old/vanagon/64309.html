Subject:      back to school...

Hey all,
Well, the time has come, time to sign off the lists and go back to school
for the fall.

I will be leaving in the morning (Friday) and will arrive in Fredericksburg
Friday afternoon.  Then, my girlfriend and I will spend Saturday at Busch
Gardens Williamsburg.  On Sunday, I move into my dorm and regain internet
access, and classes start Monday.

The van is loaded down, but with plenty of room left over.  Amazing how
that works out.

So next time I e-mail it will be from school.

Please don't reply to this message at this address as I will not receive
it.   I know someone will do it anyway, so let me speak loudly and clearly:

PLEASE DON'T REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE
PLEASE DON'T REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND YOUR OWN BODY, DON'T REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE!

There, I think that ought to do it.

My address is now changed to sbart7kb_at_www.mwc_dot_edu.  If you have any mail to
send to me, send it there.  Do NOT reply to this message or use this
address for future mailings to me.  I will not receive them.

I'll let the lists know how the van did on the trip up, but I'm expecting
it to do really well as it has done in the past.

Hope everyone else had a good summer, I know I did :-)

Sean
