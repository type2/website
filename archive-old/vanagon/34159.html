&gt;What happened?  When I checked, three years ago, a catalytic converter at 
&gt;the local VW dealer was $800.00+. ('86 GL)

That's what I thought.  By the way,  gutting the CAT will decrease
performance as the exhaust flow is no longer smooth.  Cat should be replaced.
 If VAN is running properly, vehicle will still pass most emission
inspections.  CAT prides assistance for abnormal conditions.  If any one
needs info on Emissions, I have written some articles that expalins the test
purposes, (GROSS POLLUTERS).  I can E-Mail them to you.  Also, deliberately
gutting the CAT is a FEDERAL Offense.  Find a good used one!
