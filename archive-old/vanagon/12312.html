Subject: Replacement speakers for '87 Vanagon

Can anyone recommend a good replacement speaker for the front and back
factory installed Blaupunkt stereo speakers? I recently installed a new
Clarion tape deck, but the sound is very tinny, I think because of the
speakers. Also, the front speakers need to be flush mounted because of
the window crank being so close, so that limits your options.

Thanks,
