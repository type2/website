Subject: Re: Gas Tank Update

Howzit,

Thom, do you know what bus year you grabbed the tank
from?  I ran out of gas, AGAIN (fifth time, 2nd this month),
simply because I had commuted during the windy days last
week, thus my gas mileage plummeted, and, cough...kachunk,
uh oh, damnit, no mo' gas!

I don't have near the tools and know how that you do, that's
why I'm lingering while you iron out all the details.  I love
guinea pigs q:-&gt;

Also, anyone know of a good gas can that keeps the odor to
a minimum.  The plastic piece-o'-poo that I have gives me
a buzz, no matter where I hide it (currently under rear seat).

Thanks,
Danny D.
