&gt;motor are 
&gt;available.  
&gt;

Tim, where are you shipping from? Also, what happened!!???!!!???

Uh, on first thought, I think I bid for everything. On second thought, here
are some specific bids for specific items. I'd probably bid for more, but I
cannot think right now, so let me know if you develop a list with prices.

$150 each for front and rear bumper (not including air dam)
$20 glovebox
$110 instrument pod (tach/speedo) with switches ($75 without switches)
$20 each for vent window glass
$23 mudflap
$100 rearfacing seat and base (foldup kind, grey)
$120 for curtains (hard to name a price until I know if you have the full
westfalia set. I'd pay $120 for a full Westfalia set, including rear screen,
skylight cover piece, and front.)
$75 brain
$25 tail light idle stabalizer brain
$25 idle stabalizer valve
$50 distributor
$70 muffler
