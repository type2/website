Subject: Clutch Replacement

I wanted to get some input from someone who replaced the clutch on a
waterboxer.  I'm not sure whether to machine the flywheel or if it is
un-necessary.  My '86 has 125,000 and I'm not sure if it's the original
clutch, but I think it is. Please Help!

Thanks,Matt
'86 Vanagon GL
