Alan,
If you still have an engine for sale, I need one for my 1984 Vanagon GL.
Please let me know.

Thanks, 

Scott Maurer

&gt;&gt; I bought an 1984 Vanagon with a seized(?) engine.  I got a tow home and have
&gt;&gt; been reading Bntley and lurking ever since.  I dismantled the engine and
&gt;&gt; discovered much sludge and not a drop of oil to drain at the plug or oil
&gt;&gt; filter. When I took off the oil filler tube from the crankcase out poured
&gt;&gt; clean oil.  I split the case and found a piston rod seized to the
&gt;&gt; crankshaft.  I called the local (Portland, OR) auto salvage yards and found
&gt;&gt; no replacement engine.  I did find an 1983 1.9L core for $250.  They said I
&gt;&gt; had just missed a &quot;runner&quot; sold for $550.  I now have the 1983 salvage
&gt;&gt; engine core dismantled as well.  I found head and valve damage in cyl. #1.
&gt;&gt; I hoped not to have to split the 1983 case, but there was excessive
&gt;&gt; crankshaft endplay(?), and my concern of the impact the cyl #1 valve damage
&gt;&gt; (the rocker assembly shaft was bent and the push rod loose to the side under
&gt;&gt; the valve cover) had on the camshaft, bearings and case.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I phoned Camelback Volkswagon (from vanagon archives
&gt;&gt; &quot;A-Few-Parts-Suppliers&quot;) for parts price quotes.  Is there a better source
&gt;&gt; for quality replacements for the following?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; head gasket set
&gt;&gt; main bearings
&gt;&gt; rod bearings
&gt;&gt; camshaft and bearings
&gt;&gt; piston rings
&gt;&gt; distributor drive gear
&gt;&gt; water pump
&gt;&gt; pushrod tubes
&gt;&gt; flywheel crankshaft seal
&gt;&gt; muffler and clamp
&gt;&gt; exhaust pipe
&gt;&gt; C.V. boot
&gt;&gt; brake shoes
&gt;&gt; right and left rear hatch struts
&gt;&gt; passenger side mirror
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Should anything else be replaced/done while the engine is out for a strong
&gt;&gt; rebuild?
&gt;&gt; Is it OK to combine crankshaft shims from both engines or should I buy new
&gt;&gt; shims?
&gt;&gt; Should I replace the pilot bearing in the crankshaft that mates with the
&gt;&gt; automatic transmission?
&gt;&gt; I plan to reuse the piston rods unless I find excessive wear.  Is it OK to
&gt;&gt; reuse the rod nuts and bolts?
&gt;&gt; Is it OK to reuse the valve lifters with the new camshaft if they pass the
&gt;&gt; Bentley check for wear?
&gt;&gt; I have a sears click type(?) torque wrench.  Bentley says not to use
click type.
&gt;&gt; Is this critical?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Last but not least, these heads.  Could these heads be OK after 120K-130K
miles?
&gt;&gt; I removed some of the valves and have valve/guide wear within tolerance.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am not sure you can classify me as a Vanagon owner yet for stats, but I am
&gt;&gt; a Vana-Want-to-Be.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
