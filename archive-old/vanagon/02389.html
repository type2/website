Subject: RE: shower in a westy!

My wife and I were considering a similar concept, though I like to figure
out a way to make the tank more permanent so that it could stay attached
(and heating) while one cruises.  Ten gallons would be plenty for several
get wet - shut the water off - scrub - and quick rinse type showers.

If one could attach the tank to the main sink pump, one could use the warm
water for dishes as well, eliminating the hassle of heating water to do the
dirty dishes.

Having ten gallons of extra water on hand would also come in real nice for
those weeks in Joshua Tree, Baja, etc. where a clean water supply may be
miles from where you want to camp.

How does 80 pounds on the roof affect handling?
