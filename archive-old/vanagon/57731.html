Subject: 84 Tranny questions
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I thought I saved the thread from awhile back, but I guess not.  
Couldn't find it in archives either.  I was all set to change the gear 
oil in the 091 4 speed in my 84 Westy and have a few questions;

1. Bently shows technical specs for the 091/1 but not the 91.  Anyone 
know what the gear oil capacity is for the 091? Is the 91 tranny the 
same as the 091/1?
2.  Crawled under the tranny and could not readily locate a drain plug. 
 The fill plug doesn't look too healthy either.  Looks like it hasn't 
budged in years (probably hasn't).  Any technique on loosening the fill 
plug and locating the drain plug?  I want to make sure I can loosen the 
fill plug before I drain the old oil out (great advice from a 
listmember).
3.  After reading several testimonials, I probably am going to go with 
the Redline stuff.  Can't find it in FLAPS, any advice on who has it? 
(I'm in D.C. area).

TIA,
Scott
