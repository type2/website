Subject: Baja equipment



To All:

CB radios are handy when running in convoy anywhere south of the line.  They
are also illegal or subject to various restrictions.  Despite that, everyone
uses them.

The best CB for use in Baja is the cheapest piece of crap that works, with a
mag-mount antenna and a power lead that pokes into the cigarette lighter
socket.  You take off the mag mount when you're not using the thing, reach
out the window and slap it on if you need it.  Cheaper is better because some
police decide they need the illegal things more than you; if you've got an
ultra-expensive SSB Cobra with an illegal linear amp, the more they will lust
after 'confiscating' the thing; cheap crappola rates little more than a
passing snear.  (Look for cheap rigs at garage sales and flea markets; five
bucks is about right.)


But the thing that makes a CB useful runs counter to conventional wisdom:
 Don't use the radio.  Zero chatter.  No happy-talk.  Leave it on Channel 9
and then LEAVE IT ALONE, unless someone starts shooting at you or the flames
have finally reached the cockpit or you see a sign advertising cold beer at
one peso a liter.  Because surer than hell, if you use it like a toy there
won't be anyone listening when you really got a problem.

If you're bright enough to come in out of the rain you can sit down and take
the no-code ham radio test and get a Cheater's License (REAL hams all speak
Morse).  This will allow you to use some very sophisticated VHF equipment.
 With a Mexican ham radio permit in your wallet the cops give you a little
salute, a nervous smile and leave your equipment strictly alone, even if it
includes a kerosene powered Death Ray mounted on the roof of your van.  But
the ham stuff is expensive, and when running in a convoy in the remote
regions of Baja you rarely need the benefits of static-free FM or the
extended range provided by ham gear.  (I once wiled away the muggy miles
between Mulege and Loreto chatting another desert traveler.  In Australia.
 [Thanks to the globe-girdling capabilities of the Amateur Radio Service.])  

Travel in Baja isn't all that dangerous but it doesn't hurt to skew the odds
in your favor.  CB does the job at minimum cost (and makes prime trading
goods under certain circumstances).
