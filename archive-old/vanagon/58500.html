Hi !

&gt; While driving a rented Suzuki on Phuket Island, Thailand,  I was passed by a
&gt; Eurovan which I later caught up with.  I noticed the tires were larger than
&gt; normal and it set diferently than other Eurovans...  It was a while before I
&gt; saw the &quot;Syncro&quot; emblem on the rear.  This was right hand drive etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; I lost him in traffic, so there was no chance to see if the emblem was a joke
&gt; or for real...
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone heard of a Syncro Eurovan,  or have I been in Thailand too long???
&gt; 

Here in Sweden we have lots of them.
