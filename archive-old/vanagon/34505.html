Subject: Intake Questions on a '74

Today I was looking at my bus (1974, non-FI) and noticed some weird 
things in the airscoops.  There seems to be some metal tubing that comes 
up out of the engine, bends and heads back down into the engine 
compartment.  This tubing is about 1/4&quot; in diameter, and at the top there 
is a section that is about 1&quot; in diameter and about 6&quot; long.  Is it some 
kind of sensor or mechanical thermostat.  I know there is one under the 
engine, but is this part of it.  The tubing seems to be on both sides of 
the bus.

Any ideas what this is?

Thanks,
Craig
