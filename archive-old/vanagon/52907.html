Subject: Re: Fridge problems

Its best to check the simple things first:

1) is the fuse blown? (on my Westy the fuse is located at the bottom of
the column, behind and to the left side of the drivers seat)
2) is there voltage at the wire connected to the fuse?
3) trace the wire from the fuse to the fridge. Is there voltage there?

&gt; I have a 1979 Westy with a troublesome fridge.  It works when hooked up
&gt; to house power, but doesn't want to work when switched to battery.  This
&gt; one only works on electric, so I can't run it any other way.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything I can check to see if the fridge is getting power, just
&gt; not cooling?  General troubleshooting suggestions?  Any hints, comments,
&gt; or pearls of wisdom are appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
