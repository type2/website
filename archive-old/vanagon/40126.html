i can't believe the saga, there seem to be so many people falling over 
themselves to rescue this &quot;free&quot; bus that iy is actually might be worth 
something.

perhaps the operative thing should have been to keep it under yor hat drag the 
thing home _and then_ post to the list. sometimes it seems that by letting too 
many people know all it does is jack up the price of the machine.

hope that somebody grabs it real soon before it gets expen$ive!

keep us posted
