While all you guys are slaving away at your 9 to 5's, I'm out in my drive
R&amp;Ring my syncro transmissions. I thought I would test out the trans from
the parts van I bought. I have a strange feeling this &quot;parts&quot; trans is
going to be OK :-) Things are going fairly good but a few occurences
brought to mind the list and a few of the current threads. That guy from
the &quot;old folks home&quot; mentioned casually about disconnecting the neg strap
from the battery, of course I know better????. Well, yesterday when
removing the orginal trans from the westy, some idiot (Me) forgot to do so
and the same idiot had pulled the rubber boot from the starter back far
enough that when in contact with the fiberglass insulation, reminded me of
the beautiful fireworks display my city holds every 4th of july. Not too
cool when the insulation covers the gas tank. The other thing was while
installing the clutch cylinder I felt the rubber boot and felt some kind of
pressure behind it. It wasn't until I ripped it a little that I realized
someone (girlfriend) had depressed the clutch pedal and blown the
cylinder:-0  Actually, it was probably already blown, but I have to lay the
blame on someone and I've already fessed up to the above. 

If anyone is wondering my whereabouts:
Drew J.   Expect a telephone call tonight, I still have your number.
Pete and Jack     I have your checks and the parts are in UPS's hands.

BTW, I got a little upset with the clutch cylinder and ripped the plastic
hose off and burned it in the driveway....
