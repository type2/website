Subject: RE: Has anybody had any problems like this? VW Taxis 

My experience in traveling overseas is to only pick up taxis at taxis stands or hotels.

This is not limited to Mexico.

If at all possible, call the taxis company and order a taxis, if a stand is not available.

This is a real problem at airports.  They will see that you are an american and try to get 
you to take their taxi without using the que.
