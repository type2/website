Subject: GrassRoots Festival Info

hey now,

many of you have written me wanting info on the Grassroots Festival in Ithaca,
Ny...well, actually Trumansburg, NY. I'll be cruising up there from Raleigh NC
july 16 and returning july 23. the festival itself is from july 18-22...it's
a GREAT time, GREAT bands, KIND people, relaxed atmosphere.

some of the bands this year:

Burning Spear (great reggae band!)
Donna the Buffalo
Hypnotic Clambake
Red Hots
colorblind james experience
The Horse Flies
Steve Riley &amp; the Mamou Playboys
Solas with Seamus Egan
Preston Frank and hiys Zydeco Family Band
John Speckler
Rasta Rafiki

and many many others

plus contra dancing, bluegrass, folk, vendors, etc.

i'd expect some more bands maybe some well known ones to show up...10,000
Maniacs were there one year. it's a beautiful scene in the Finger Lakes Region,
beautiful beautiful country. perfect for vw'ing.
