&gt; welcome to come for the send-off soiree.  Email me for my address, or call
&gt; me at home at (604) 689-2660.  Some folks are arriving a day of two early,
&gt; so we may have a practice party Saturday night.

&gt; Two weeks to go, then northward ho!

Caron and I would like to join in any evening festivities.  We also want to pad out 
the caravan (carabus) up to Shannon Falls on the 22nd (is that right?).  Neither of 
us can afford the vacation time to do the trip but it would be nice to be part of a 
huge carabus up Hwy 99.  So how about everyone from BC and WA try to make it up to 
give these people (carzies? psychos?) a proper VW sendoff on the morning of their 
departure.
