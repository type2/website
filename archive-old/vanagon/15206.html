Subject: Whistling Noise Update 71 Bus

Hi folks,

I pulled the engine on my 71 Westy on Friday to investigate the whistling 
noise that occurs in all gears (more noticeable in 3rd and 4th) but 
disappears when the clutch pedal is depressed 1/2 way or so.  Things I 
found included a transmission input shaft that certainly had play--no dial 
indicator to measure though--also, the throwout bearing had play in the non 
rotational direction so I replaced that.  I wanted to replace my gland nut 
just cause it's been on the engine for so long, but I broke the new one 
torquing it on!!--a little tooo much torque.  So I used the old one.

The one interesting thing I found was that my endplay was a whopping .011&quot; 
!!!  I bought some new shims and brought it back down to .004&quot;  but I'm 
wondering now if a vicious cycle has started that means the demise of my 
beloved engine.  The &quot;How to rebuild Your VW Aircooled Engine&quot; book says 
that there's a .006&quot; wear limit...Now does that mean .006&quot; over and above 
the acceptable .003-.005&quot; endplay range or just .001&quot; over .005&quot;???

So did my whistling noise go away?.....No, I'm afraid it didn't.  But it's 
so subtle I'll just wait and see now unless there are any other ideas.  
BTW, the pressure plate and clutch looked good (only 10,000 miles on them).

I did install some nice new engine seal rubber from WCM--I really needed 
that--especially on the &quot;firewall&quot; side.  I also cut the holes for my gas 
heater and did a nice job (if I do say so) with a hammer, chisel, aviation 
snips and a metal cutting hand saw--no power tools here folks!!

New weekend I'll wrap up the gas heater installation.  For now I'll be 
living with a little whistle in my life.
