Subject: Oil leak problem---help!!!
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 1995 23:23:16 -0500 (EST)

while driving my bus today i noticed a significant oil leak over the left
exhaust manifold.  i have yet to determine where it is coming from, so any
suggestions would be really helpful.  this is a major worry for me, as you
probably understand.

thanks in advance
