Subject: Wanted: Decel. Valve (?) for '78 2L


A friend needs this part and says he has looked everywhere for this part 
and &quot;that computer list you talk about is my last hope....&quot;.
I don't want to let him down.

He says it is called a deccelaration valve (?)
he says they are electrical or vaccum, his is vac.  Has 2 &quot;part numbers&quot; 
but doesn't know which is which.... 071133551 and 022133551B

I made him describe it and then went and found it on my bus.  It's a 
flying-saucer lookin' thang mounted on the front firewall.  2 lines out 
left side, 1 out right.

He believes it has failed and is causing the fuel injection to &quot;sputter&quot; 
some.

Please speak up if you know where we can get one.  Used is fine.
One '78 Camper &quot;Brown Bear&quot; would be very happy.
