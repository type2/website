Subject: Brake lights

The brake lights on my 79 bus do not light up until the pedal is pushed 
about 1/2 way to the floor (long after the brakes have actually engaged). 
The braks work great otherwise, I just want the person behind me to know 
that they work too. Is the fix as simple as changing the two switches on 
the master cylinder? If so, does brake fluid squirt out if the swithces 
are removed? Finally, if I am on the right track to fix this problem, 
does anyone know where to get these switches (GEX perhaps)?

Thanks,

Sean
