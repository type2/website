Why just water-cooled engines? 

Mine is a '75 bus.
-first engine went at 65,000 miles, catastrophic failure from sudden
over-heating.
-complete rebuilt (with new block) went after only 500 miles. something
was wrong with a valve. 
-VWoA paid for third rebuild. Still running nicely with 120,000 on the
odometer, i.e., 55,000 on this rebuilt.
