Subject: Westphalia Refrigerator lighting

I'm open to any suggestions about problems I'm having lighting the gas
refrigerator on my 1980 Westfailure.  I pulled the refrigerator out and
repaired a gas leak near the burner.  The burner now runs merrily when it's
dropped out, but it's impossible to light when it's put back in.  The
little airpump on the top appears to no longer pump air; when you try to
light the burner, all you get is a poof of exploding gas with no lasting
flame.  I've tried to get a replacement for the air pump with no success. 
Even the American manufacturer claims to no longer carry the part.  If I
blow air up the drain line from the front it doesn't seem to help.  Any
suggestions before I give up and carry a lot of ice?  The frig works fine
on 120V, but civilized campgrounds are not our cup of tea.
