Subject: SYNCRO - recovery procs - tow hooks 

Hi,
I just found your &quot;You Beaut&quot; list. I've bought a 88 SYNCRO with a TRAKKA
Camper conversion to go round OZ for 6 months.
I have not been able to find out where to mount recovery hooks for speedy
recovery like if you get stuck on a tidal river crossing (Gulf of
Carpentaria and Cape York).

Dealers just tell me to hook on to the bumper bars. But I've seen those
ripped off when snatched out of a bog.

Any help would be appreciated.
Cheerio
