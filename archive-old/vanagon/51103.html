I looked for the same set for 6-8 months, and then found 5 sets at my local
target store.  Bought all of them, and haven't seen any since

&gt; Just visiting a local Bradlees I finally found the VW set of 
&gt; Micromachines.  For those not familiar, these are very small toy cars 
&gt; that come in packs of five.  I'd been looking for a number of months, 
&gt; ever since my friend informed me of thier existence.  The set includes:  
&gt; A Bug, Bug convertible, Karmen Ghia, Rabbit convertible, and a split 
&gt; screen bus.  I'm not sure of the year (im a Vanagon guy;)) But it has a 
&gt; sunroof and the corner rear windows (23 windows?)
&gt; Just thought someone would want to know...
