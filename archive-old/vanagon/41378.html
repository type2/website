Subject: hinge plates?

I had the unfortunate experience to have to drill out the plates that my
engine lid hinges (`70 bus) are screwed to and now I have no idea how to get
them out or if I am going to have to tap them..  Any takers? The good side
of this story is that the hinges that I had to remove (the pins were shot in
them), a friend of mine tapped them out and replaced the pins for me and now
they are perfect!  Guess you gotta take the bad with the good sometimes..
