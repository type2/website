Subject: Re: alternators-Bosch or otherwise?

So where does one buy brushes and diodes anyway?  I doubt from the
FLAPS.  And how much do these cost?

TIA - Frank

 &gt;Sorry Dennis, I disagree with you here.  I have the original alternator 
 &gt;still in my 77 Rabbit.  I replaced the brushes 6 years ago and have never 
 &gt;had to touch the bearings.  This alternator has slowly gone from 23 
 &gt;Amps output 3 years ago to its current (little pun, there) 10 Amps.  
 &gt;
 &gt;Obviously the diodes are going and while I could get another diode pack 
 &gt;and put it in, I'll probably opt to buy a lifetime warranteed rebuilt 
 &gt;unit just so I don't have to go through this again (in another 10 
 &gt;years...:) ).   
 &gt;
 &gt;Electronic construction processes being what they are (ion implantation) 
 &gt;any electronic device will _decay_ or lose it's effectiveness over time, 
 &gt;particularly one in such a hostile environment as an automobile engine 
 &gt;compartment.
