Subject: Data base requests

For those who want to be included in the data base:

At this time, we *only* have pre-68 buses included.
To those who have e-mailed with post-68 info,
thanks very much, but that's outside the scope
of our current database.

If you have particular repair/parts/welding questions,
Anthony is still knowledgeable about bubble buses and
Vanagons. We *do* have VWs thru 60's and 70's - but
his preference is the splits. But we don't see a lot
of them around! So we do socialize with the bubble
buses and Vanagon people (cos we're outnumbered!!).

We were at a camping weekend recently where we were
the only split. It seemed the older folks who used
to have splits have graduated to the Vanagons! So,
everyone wanted to see our 27-yr old bus which was
actually on the road and functional. They couldn't
believe it.

The Saturday nights of these camping weekends tend 
to be communal dinners, everyone brings something.
We were the only ones (this was pointed out to us)
that actually cooked our food there. Mostly everyone
else cooked their items at home &amp; stored them in their
*refrigerator* (what's a refrigerator - &quot;Honey, we
need more ice!&quot;).

Thanks again for your responses - You can still e-mail 
me or call us at home (201-347-4081) for VW info. 
Hopefully there are some more split people out there, 
too. (I guess you could accuse Anthony of having a 
&quot;split&quot; personality!)
