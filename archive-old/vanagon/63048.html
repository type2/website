&gt; What is going to happen to our archives?

&gt; Are they going to be ported over to a new location from lenti or are
&gt; they--worst of all possible worlds--going to be stored on two separate
&gt; servers, depending on whether messages are pre or post 7/97.

We will house them ALL here on GERRY, but give us some breathing room to
work the bugs out of the new listserv. I've gotten over 300 messages today
from GERRY notifying me of all the 'bad' subscribers ... on vacaton,
bounced mail, mailboxes full, no longer active amil address ... and I'm
supposed to be vacationing today!

We hope to provide FTP and WEb Service in the near future. Hopefully, the
site will become your one-stop-shop for vanagon related info.

Tally Ho!

Chris
