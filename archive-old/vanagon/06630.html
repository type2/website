So Joe Clark says:
&gt; 
&gt; [Snip -- ah say, snip]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; h) move to Florida 
&gt; &gt; upside - Marlin fishing 
&gt; &gt; downside - may become a bubba 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Indee -- ah say, indeed, suh!  Frankly, your ethnic sensitivity
&gt; shows need of some schoolin'.  Howevah, I am willin' to ignore your lack
&gt; of good mannahs, especially in light of the fact that should you choose --
&gt; as have several million of your blue-skinned northern brethren -- to
&gt; repair to these southern climes as our genetically superior ancestors did
&gt; lo these many generations ago, please do rest assured that, so long as you
&gt; select a place south of I-4 (even, sadly, many places north of it), you
&gt; are sure to be among like-minded, black-speedoed, dunlop-bellied Canadjuns
&gt; -- with nary a bubba in sight. 
&gt; 
&gt; Joe &quot;Earl&quot; Clark
&gt; 

Well I Dee-Clare.....  I never knew we had Fog-Horn Leghorn on the list!

Ah say, ah say Boy!  Pay attention boy!   :[ ]   ;)
