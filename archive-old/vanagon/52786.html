Subject: EV campers: ground clearance

Several EV Winnebago Camper owners have mentioned in the past the
problem with the low ground clearance of the LP and grey water valves.

We also managed to scrape the shield when driving slowly over potholes.
No serious damage so far, but I believe that for backroad trips
this means an accident waiting to happen.  Furthermore, I am worried
about corrosion damage due to constant exposure to water, salt, dirt.

My dealer didn't know what to do about these issues.  I wonder how
frequent a problem this is among the 95 and 97 EV's with this feature.
Maybe sufficient ground swell would lead to a design change on future
models, possibly even a recall of existing models.
