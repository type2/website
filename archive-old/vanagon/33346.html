I saved this from the list a while back ( I don't remember the original poster):


  I've found a repair shop where the proprietors are HONEST, FAIR, and
SKILLED at VW Type IV repair and diagnostics.

GANDALF'S GARAGE,
Specializes in VW Vanagon, Transporter, and Type IV
1681 C &amp; D Old Mission Road
South San Francisco, CA 94080
(415) 755-2580

Rodrigo and Gretchen Castano, Proprietors

A friendly and warm couple, shop is very busy, mostly of course VW Vans &amp;
Vanagons and all the older watercooled cars.
    Rodrigo was able to accurately diagnose my COLD &amp; WARM MISS problems
as an ECU that had failed on 1 of the 2 Injector Trigger Channels.    He
confirmed my deductions that my trigger points, grounds, harness and
temperature sensors were all O.K..   I felt good about this since I had
systematically followed the 914 Fan Web guide on Bosch-D Fuel Injection
and ended up concluding that the ECU was only bad element.  Sure enough,
switching only the ECU instantly cured the MISS problem...hooray!

 GANDALF's did not try to mark up parts, or charge for misdirected labor
(they eat there own mistakes).  GANDALF9s does not try to 3stick2 you
just cause the label on the outside says 3Porsche2, they charge VW
prices for VW work.

  Gretchen Castano runs the front office and is very knowledgeable about
automotive repairs and VW9s herself.  Gretchen is totally fun to talk
with especially if you are an old VW fan.  In her native Nicaragua, NEW
BRAZILIAN-made Beetles and COMBIS are the backbone of transportation.
Gretchen had me drooling over the prospect of taking a container full of
very young (or even new) VW models home that haven9t been available in
the U.S. for at least 20 years!

GANDALF's is very very busy, so there is some wait in getting repairs,
but I'm very satisfied.

you will be too!  very nice people

I have to disagree. I went there for a smog check on my '69. The previous
owner had given me a smog check, and the numbers were well below the
limits, BUT it was out of date. To make a long story short, I didn't
register the bus for several months and now find myself with a fixit
ticket.....

I went to this shop, freshly tuned motor..new plugs, wires, rotor cap,
points and condenser, shiny clean oil, timed spot on, valves, etc. After
checking the emissions on the machine, Rodrigo informed me that my bus
failed to pass. He suggested that it was because of the &quot;illegal
distributor (009).&quot; He also told me that I must have the cable from the
thermostat to the air cleaner. He would, of course, be happy to perform
this work for &quot;around $500.&quot; He refused to show me the print out from the
smog machine. He said it didn't matter what the numbers said, my car was
illegal.

I said no way. I called the Bureau of Automotive Repair and they say that
all I needed was a throttle de-accelerator, which I have (brand new). They
said that the mechanical advance aftermarket distributor was perfectly
legal!

I took my bus to a generic shop, Don &amp; Jerry's, and they ran it for $35.00.
It passed with out any problem, again the numbers were well below the
maximum. I'm reporting Gandalf's to the BBB. It's a cheap shot to use the
smog requirement to sucker unnecessary work out of &quot;valued customers.&quot; I
suggest you be very wary if you visit this shop.
