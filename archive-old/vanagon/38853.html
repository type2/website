*I* was grossly misquoted as saying:
&gt;&gt; - since i put Bosch triple-prong plugs (into my 88 vanagon), my
&gt;&gt;anal-retentive recordkeeping :)

then Dan &quot;Obesely Compulsive&quot; snorted:
&gt;i thought this list determined that &quot;Obsessive/Compulsive&quot; was the
&gt;correct diagnosis?  Which is it?  I mean, we can't be using the
&gt;incorrect term when the correct term is available, can we?  That's
&gt;what's wrong with society nowadays, we settle for the mediocre and
&gt;'pretty good'.  Where has exactness gone?  Orderliness?  Linear
&gt;concrete thinking?  I mean I'm not being obsessive about this am I?
&gt;Or is it compulsive?  :)

well, *I* always thought &quot;anal retentive&quot; meant &quot;an asshole that keeps
everything&quot;. sort of a packrat with an attitude.

while an &quot;obsessive/compulsive&quot; is just one of those really pushy people
who are always in your face about everything ... sort of like your brother-
in-law, after about six beers.

i think i was more right. :) ask Tobin and Christa where i keep my oil
filters. :)
