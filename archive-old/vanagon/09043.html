... Posting Sweepstakes ...

well, first of all, that's NOT why i posted the things. i was concerned that
too much was being said by too few folks ... but, like i said, it turns out
that a rather high percentage has at least said Something. while it is true
that a small very vocal minority doth make many the squeeking noises, i think
that, in my experience, this is true of any group.  my purpose was not to
extoll the virtues of Blabbering, but to kinda let folks know ... well,
something. i'm not sure exactly what. kinda like the friday stats: what
exactly does that show/prove/whatever? that if a few more of the Unknowns
would 'fess' up, we'd have over a 100 buses? so? what we have, we have.
if the Don't-wanna-talk's don't wanna, that's their right.

so, anyway. i'm not really sure what the Posting Sweepstakes mean, but i
kinda don't like that phrase ... i didn't mean for it to be a sweepstakes or
results of any sort of race. i still don't believe i talk that much.

&gt;Someone a few weeks ago suggested that perhaps a list like this is sort of
&gt;like a bar and that you have to expect a certain amount of bar talk. I

i prefer to think of this list as an on-going seminar or business meeting
... either or both of which must, at times, include some tension-breaking
levity or foolishness. too much work doth make Jack a dull boy. too much
play don't pay the bills. :)

&gt;Incidentally, the news that Macklow is planning to sell his syncro is
&gt;stunning. I find it stunning because he is poster number nine on the list. He
&gt;says he is burning out on paying so much on upkeep to keep his van running. I
&gt;had sort of assumed that we all knew our vans were not practical vehicles ...

well ... practical is maybe not the right word here. &quot;economical&quot; is what the
vw buses are not. well, at least vanagons are not. maybe eurovans will be,
and the older buses are certainly economical ... hell, except for the beetle,
they are probably the cheapest, most reliable vehicles around. perhaps, one
day, the vanagons will evolve into that status. but for now, vanagons, and
especially the syncros, are NOT economical. practical? yeah. fun? yeah.
but cheap to buy and cheap to run and cheap to maintain, they ain't.

the Worst Part is, when someone like Jim says he wants to sell his bus,
people like me, start looing at things in and around the house, trying to
figure what i can sell so i can buy his bus!!! but alas. i couldn't afford
his old 79. and i can't figure (yet?) a way to get his syncro. :( sigh.

&gt;I wonder if someone could sign up for the list and become so terrorized
&gt;reading about hundreds of possible repairs and modifications that they would
&gt;immediately decide to sell their van?

if this were true and possible, then it is better for the van and for the
people ... for they truly did not 'belong' in a vw bus to begin with. many
of our buses have come from such folks. and i know lots of folks who would
never ever learn to love a bus. my sister for one. my brother for another
(but he loves rabbits/golfs/scirocco. go figure).

and maybe some of the folks who have signed up and then dropped off later
have done exactly that: decided that vw buses were too troublesome and
expensive for them. if so, good. then we have served our purpose well. for
we wouldn't want someone to hate vw buses, would we? and if those folks kept
one, they soon would hate it.

don't forget folks: about 240 of us on the list is just one one-millionth of
the population. give or take a decimal place. :)

yeah, i know it's rambling, but i get sidetracked easily!
