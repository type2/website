Subject:      Please clarify. . .

OK, it's officially friday and I have a question not regarding repairs and
stuff.

Wanabus? Adventurewagen? Sambabus? Huh?

I know about type2s, 3s, Westys, Syncros and Carats (although I don't
EXACTLY know *everything* that makes the latter 2 different).

Will one of my loving listmembers please write and let me (and I'm sure
others on the list) know what the differences are between every designation
of Vanagon?

I am deeply in love with my '87 GL Weekender and am starved for any info
that I can get about vanagons. I'm also looking to purchase more vanagons in
the future but need to know what's out there.
Also, I'm in the stage right now of realizing that there are improvements
that I would like to make, but know LITTLE about mechanincs in general, let
alone VW quirks. Any suggestions on the quickest way to learn (short of
ripping my engine apart and trying to rebuild it)? Bentley my best bet?

Thank you for any help that you can offer.
