&gt; Had a nice lunch and afternoon with Schwarzemeister, Shelly, and Pete 
&gt; Sellers.  Got finished with lunch at ~2:30, so figured no use trying to 
&gt; get to the ferry until after rush hour, as thy wanted to at least SEE 
&gt; Vancouver downtown, and that would put them S bound on Granville at 3:30 
&gt; with is an awful idea.  
&gt; 
&gt; Pete has gone on south now, as he was concerned about the time/money 
&gt; involved in gettiong to the island for a night.  David and Shelley ARE 
&gt; coming, and I led them to the Oak street bridge at about 6:15.  If we're 
&gt; lucky, they may make the 7:00 sailing.   They tried very hard to contact 
&gt; you to tell you thaey are running late, but apparently they never got a 
&gt; telephone # from you, and couldn't find a Bell listed on W Saanich Rd.  
&gt; So they were stuck, and felt really terrible about it.  
&gt; 
&gt; If the ferry is full, they will be on the next sailing (9:00?).  They 
&gt; have the map and directions you sent them.

thanks for the update Tobin. I hope they make the seven ferry.
