Subject: Re: The Forever Car (or Bus)



&gt; Automobile-based &quot;planning&quot; has created cities where it is considered
&gt; acceptable to spend a couple of hours in the morning, and a couple of
&gt; hours in the evening, crawling along a clogged highway with a few other
&gt; hundred thousand similarly herded unfortunates.  Maybe the situation is
&gt; worse in the vancouver area than elsewhere, but rush-hour travel time by
&gt; car from, say , downtown to a major suburb like Surrey or Twawwassen is
&gt; at least 1 1/2 hours and usually more since some bozo typically runs out
&gt; of gas in the middle of a critical bridge along the way.  Three hours or
&gt; more every day driving in rush hour traffic jams?

I think you should call the police immediately, to arrest the guy who
pulled a gun on you and forced you to live that far from work.

Come on, guys. Aren't we getting a little hysterical here? I'm guilty too--
got a new job 65 miles from home, and commuted for a year, in a situation
quite similar to what you described.

But then... I MOVED. Now I drive ten minutes each way, or bicycle when
the weather's nice if I feel like it. Sold the house to do it (took a loss),
but the time I got back was worth it. I don't like traffic jams any more
than you do.

&quot;It's considered acceptable&quot; to live in your car? Considered by whom?
Anyone who feels that way has a screw loose somewhere. And that includes
those who do it day after day, year after year, and don't do anything
to change it. I should know-- I was one for a while.

Don't want to lose the equity in your house? Fine-- you've chosen to put
equity above having a real life. But don't tell me somebody forced you to
choose that way. Especially these sinister, shadowy &quot;conspirators&quot;... give
me a break.

90% of the people sitting around you in that hours-long traffic jam, are
whining that they have no other choice. Don't want to move to a &quot;worse&quot;
neighborhood that's within 10 miles of where you work? Get together with
your neighbors, contact the cops, be obnoxious to the neighborhood sleazes
till they leave. I know, it's a pain, and some of you could get bruised or
worse. So bring friends. Don't have any there? Make some. I'm sorry the
world's not a safe place, and some parts are worse than others. Who let
them get that way? (Hint: it's not &quot;someone else&quot;.) It's also not an easy
place-- never has been.

Well, off the soap box now. But every time I hear about poor, oppressed
souls unable to get out of the situation they're in... for one out of ten,
it's probably true. For the other nine... sheesh.
