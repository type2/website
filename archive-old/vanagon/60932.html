Subject: Fast idle

Okay, Vanagon wizzards, here is a problem for you. My '88 Vanagon does not
like to idle. When started (cold) It will idle at 2200rpm. A quick blip on
the gas pedal will cause the engine to idle at 1100rpm - but as soon as I
start driving, the idle jumps back up to 2200rpm. It is really odd, and
annoying.

I have not had a chance to look this up in the shop manual, but understand it
could be a vacuum leak or idle compensator. Does anyone have any tricks for
testing the idle compensator?

Thanks
