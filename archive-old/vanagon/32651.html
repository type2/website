Subject: Swimmin' with the Fiches

I bought the VW/Audi microfiche today (well, I'll get them Monday).  I'm 
*sooo* excited.  The set sounds very complete from the description over 
the phone (the stack is about 5 inches tall).  The parts manager rattled 
off the models and years covered and it sounded good to me.  He was firm 
on his price, so I agreed to the $100 value.  Joel may this think this 
foolish, but this is not the first time I have been a fool for VW stuff.  
I want to keep a full set of VW fiche, but it sounds like this may have 
two sets (or a lot of duplicates).  Not sure what I'm going to do next (I 
want to get them first, sort them, and see what I have), but I'll keep 
the list posted on the availability of any extras.  The set was 
refreshed in 1991 or 1992 and saw very little use since (they dropped 
the VW line in early 1993), so they should be in good shape.  Now I need to 
get access to a scanner and CD-R equipment (for personal archival purposes 
only, of course). ;-)
