Subject: camping on bureau of land management property


I just got the GREATEST book!  By Michael Hodgson, it's called
&quot;America's Secret Recreation Areas&quot; - Your Travel Guide to the
Forgotten Wild Lands of the Bureau of Land Management.  

Does anyone know much about camping on BLM land?  I'm thinking
this will be a very useful resource for our group campouts.  It
means:

a.  no Winnebagos
b.  no generators
c.  privacy (and do we ever need it)
d.  no problems with reservations/space
e.  cost-free!!!!
f.  unadulterated land often in the wilderness and off the beaten
    track - away from businesses, tourists, etc.

Anyway, will be getting into reading this very soon, and curious
as to what other listmembers can add...
