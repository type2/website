&gt;Yes, but what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

depends on how many coconuts he's carrying. if he's an African Swallow,
of course. :)

&gt;You know, I can't even remember what the original post was about, but I
&gt;sometimes wonder how many of us list members share common interests in
&gt;homebrewing, Python (Monty), and just being fun-loving prankster types
&gt;in general.  Scary combination, eh?

homebrewed python??? boy, i haven't had one of those in a long time.
used to have a python, but i didn't name it Monty. i called it Alger, you
know ... after that guy Hiss. :)

actually, it was just a garden hose ... i was too poor to afford a real
python.

:)    well, it's Friday SOMEWHERE!!!!
