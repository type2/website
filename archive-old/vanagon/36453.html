&gt;All,

&gt;I've been thinking (now,now David don't hurt yourself), since the busses
&gt;in Mexico are watercooled, do they suffer the same head gasket leaks
&gt;that the Vanagons get?  If not then why don't those that are looking at
&gt;replacing the heads of their Vanagons look in to ordering them from
&gt;VWoMex? If they do then the point is moot of course.
&gt;
&gt;Someone who speaks spanish could call them and ask if they are running
&gt;into complaints from owners regarding head leaks.
&gt;
&gt;Just a thought,

The Mexican Vans use the Rabitt based engines.  These engines are reliable
and easy to fix.  parts are available and reasonable.  Since VW had the
rabbit in the van, I still do not know why they spent the money to engineer
the Waterboxer nightmare.
