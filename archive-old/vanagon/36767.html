Subject: Used wheels, are they OK?

During this weekend's snow storm, my wife was going around a
corner and the rear end slid out and the wheel banged against
a curb. It bent the rim so the wheel needs to be replaced. 
 
I found one at a local junkyard for $35. 

Two questions: Is this a reasonable price? Are used wheels generally
&quot;safe&quot; to purchase?

Thanks in advance.

Oh, if anyone has an extra wheel they want to get rid of, let
me know.
