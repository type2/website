Subject: It's rebuild time for my '86 Vanagon

Finally took my `86 Vanagon off the road, no oil pressure and nasty sounding
engine knocking. 

I've been following the discussions about the cost of a rebuild and options
like different engines and the 2.5 upgrade.  Anyone interested in collaborating
on this endeavor?  I'm in no real hurry and want to do this right, but with
a reasonable cost.  Possibly a mass order for the Oettinger 2.5 liter parts
mentioned recently?
