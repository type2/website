Sorry to reply to something almost a week old... I'm a little behind. :)

&gt; 
&gt; My first piece of advice is to install an electric fuel pump
&gt; with a regulator instead of sticking with the engine-driven fuel
&gt; pump.  My '72 bus has happily run through 100,000 miles worth of
&gt; fuel pumped by a cheap (~$40) electric fuel pump, chosen at a
&gt; FLAPS by picking the smallest one that slightly exceeded the
&gt; fuel pressure and flow specs given by the Bentley Manual.

Ahh... but the '76 is fuel injected, so it's already electric, hence the
cost. I think the '72 only needs ~3-5psi, the fuel injected engines need
about 30psi.  So I don't think most of the elcetric pumps will cut it.  But
perhaps David can find one in a wrecking yard... the same pump is used on
FI bugs (~76-79) and the bay window and Vanagons (75-83).  I have
personally compared the fuel pumps of a '79 bug and a '80 Vanagon... same.
I saved the one off of the Vanagon I cut up as a spare for my '77.
