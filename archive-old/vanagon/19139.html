Subject: Reimo. Was: Vanagon louvered side windows?


&gt;Have you been holding out on us Andy?  What catalog is this?  I'd sure
&gt;like to have a copy.  Could you please dig up the info. and post the
&gt;catalog ordering info. and/or phone number?

I borrowed it from a friend so I don't know any details, but will try and 
find out. I think Martha has mentioned them before, so maybe she will know. 
Reimo is a German company and the stuff is top-notch quality but, 
unfortunately, so is the price :(
BTW there was a lot of stuff for Eurovans in there as well, but not much for 
pre '80 buses.
