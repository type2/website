So Bradley says:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds good to me!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm in!  And Bradley can bring the rest of that unburned case too! ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry Steve... I let Al Knoll have the last half case.  I think we 
&gt; should let Thom arrange the get together, since he brought it up.  :)
&gt; 

I vote for Thom to set it up too.  A great way for him to get back into
the list!  :)
