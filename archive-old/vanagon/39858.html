Subject: next CCC's trip


Several of you have asked me about the next California Camping
Crazies' trip.  I think I've responded to most of you individually,
or in small groups, but just in case, thought I'd post something here.

The next trip is over the weekend which contains April 27th, and will
be a Red Rock, as planned, and as previously announced.  While I was
away in Europe for 3 weeks, Jack Stafford kindly took over organizing
this, and I believe has made some general posts about directions, 
etc.  

I'm not yet sure about my attendance on this trip, as I am far from
being caught up from having been away, but that shouldn't deter anyone
from attending.  In fact, a lot of people are already committed and
plan to to be there, so please go if you can - it is quite an unusual
campground there in the desert.
