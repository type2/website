Here's an addition. to columbus vans fs
I realized my life long dream of owning a westy camper.Problem,I bought
a water cooled for $5500.00 I've put over $5,000. in it.My SO does not
share my love for the westy and won't stand for the repairbills. heres
the deal shes in Baltimore Oh,near Columbus runs great very clean, make
me an offer. I'm too old to start a new life. I'm very serious folks
this is a great westy it's an '87 auto 130,000 miles with lots of major
repais made ie cvj's
heads
coolant lines to the tune of $900.00
steering box and universal
belts
tranny pan gasket
excelerator cable
and more

the stove has never been lit,make me any serious offer.
