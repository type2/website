Subject: '79 2.0 liter engine &amp; tranny for sale

The original tranny and 2.0 liter long block from my one-owner 
'79 bus are for sale, along with a good pressure plate and 
flywheel.  Both engine &amp; tranny worked fine when I replaced them, 
I just wanted to have a &quot;new&quot; bus.  A couple of the hydraulic 
lifters in the engine were developing clicking noises and need to 
be disassembled and cleaned or replaced.  The bus had 132,700 
miles when they were replaced.  It was well-maintained, with 
regular oil changes and the tranny always kept toppped off with 
90w hypoid oil (no leaks).  I could use the money to spend a 
couple of months in Mexico/Central America this winter.
