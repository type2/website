&gt;&gt;To All,

&gt;&gt;I just finished making some cool bumper stickers for list members.  I
&gt;&gt;bought Richard Palmer's window stickers, and I think they're cool, but 
&gt;&gt;here's something a little different:

&gt;&gt;They're black on white with good line drawings of a Splittie, then the
&gt;&gt;VW-in-a-circle symbol and a Late Bus ('72-'79) to the right.  Under 
&gt;&gt;this it says _vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu_ in large type that's legible 
&gt;&gt;from a little distance.  If I can find good line drawings of a Vanagon 
&gt;&gt;and EV, I can scan them at hi-res and make similar bumper stickers for
&gt;&gt;Vanagon/EV owners.  Maybe a Splittie and a Vanagon for one, and a 
&gt;&gt;Splittie and an EV for another.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; If you make Vanagon versions, let me know.  I'd love to get a bunch of them!

Ron,

I just finished printing the stickers with a '54? Splittie and an early 
'80s Vanagon separated by the VW symbol in a circle.  They look great!

Also have the same sticker with a '72-'79 Late Bus instead of the 
Vanagon.

They're three for $5 or seven for $10, postage paid, to:
