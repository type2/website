Howdy,
I don't have any Vanagon experience, but I just bought some Kelly
Safari all terrain 850x27r14 tires for my '78 bus and am very 
happy with them.  They steer easier with 30 psi than the old tires
did at 35.  A friend at work got 40K plus out of Kellys on his 
Dodge 4x4.  The tread is quite aggressive, and I expect them to do
well in the snow this winter as well as in the desert dirt.  These
were not cheap at $85 installed, balanced, and new stems, but they]
are truck tires and quite a bit heavier duty than the regular 
passenger car tire.  They ride nice, and I can't say they are any
noisier than the worn out ones I took off the b us.

Happy trails,

Tom pettit
