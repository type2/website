Back in June of 95, Martha Rubin reported on some stuff called Kool Seal
that she used on one of her buses. I'd be curious as to Martha's six
month review...as well as whether she has the &quot;full sized&quot; camper top or
the smaller one.

See the post I just made on this stuff.  The 6 month, or maybe by
now even 12 month report is that I'm still happy with the product.  I
very much like the fact that I can easily, quickly, and inexpensivley
touch up or even re-do the surface in a flash.  Incidentally, I have
the full-sized, westfalia pop-top.  The surface hasn't leaked, and I
have no complaints, other than it would probably have given me
better gas mileage to have it now shiny and smooth.
