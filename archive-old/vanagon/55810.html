Subject: RE: Needed - EV Oil Filters


&gt;Ouch! What's the difference with the EV filters? I though the Audi 5=20
&gt;cyl used the same old VW filter used since the early 70s. Is it like=20
&gt;the Corrado filter with a big nut on the end, or what?
&gt;
&gt;Around here, the dealer is $6.50 for a standard gas VW filter, $7.50=20
&gt;for the diesel, haven't checked on the EV though. $8.75 =3D abput $12=20
&gt;CDN though...


The difference is the big nut on the end of the oil filter....eventhough =
I have not personally changed the oil, I did get to watch once (does =
that make me a lubrication voyeur?)....

The oil filter is in a real tight place, and it does not appear that the =
usual slip wrench would fit into the area.
