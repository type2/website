Subject: 83 Westy update

Just got my 83 back from Alex.  Update on work done to date:

Adjust shift linkage - worked like a charm:  good to have 1st and 2nd gears
back! (sorry Ron - forgot to ask Alex what he did.  Will follow up with a
phone call).

Bypass heater core, coolant flush &amp; fill, brake/clutch fluid replacement, 4
new CV boots.

All of the above for $295.  Very reasonable.

Also, 4 new Michelin MX 185SR 14 - 6 ply tires, $340 total cost.

I myself changed tranny fluid to Valvoline 75W-90 100% synthetic gear oil
after struggling with the drain plug.  A combination of a 17 mm hex socket
adapter with a 17 mm open end wrench on part of the hex did the trick - no
room for the adapter  attached to a ratchet or breaker bar as the exhaust
cross tube is in the way.  Noticed shift linkage boot missing while
searching for fill plug.

Replaced all vacuum hose, checked distributor advance/retard diaphrams with
a vacuum pump and cleaned plug wire ends, adjusted clips for a tight fit and
coated them with silicone dielectric grease to attempt a cure for throttle
on hesitation and rough acceleration.  All of this helped but still have to
get RPM,s up for a smooth start in 1st - almost as if no vacuum advance is
taking place.  Notice that Alex sealed the air meter plate as it was
formerly loose.  A problem with moving contacts?  Looked like new inside
earlier.

Added a can of Slick 50 fuel system cleaner to help with above.  Came highly
recommended by the pros at a local NAPA.  Waiting for the plastic fuel
pre-filter to arrive so I can install the main fuel filter.

Plan on switching to Castrol Syntec 5W-50 100% synthetic at next oil change.
Have used it with excellent results in BMW's, Toyotas, and even in the
1600cc type II engine in my 69 Westy.  Cuts oil consumption to near zero in
sound engines.

Nephews thought the Westy was the coolest thing since Nintendo.  Enjoyed
crawling around in the bunk and yelling at passing friends through the
unzipped window.  Promised to take them camping (when I am confident of no
break-downs!).
