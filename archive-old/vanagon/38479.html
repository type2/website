Subject: what year did california get it's own bus?
Date: Thu, 28 Mar 1996 05:25:03 GMT

Does anyone know when vw started bulfing Cal. and no California
models.
I'm thinking of moving there in '97 and would hate to get attatched to
a bus (I'm looking to buy a westy now.) and then have to get a Cal
model when I move there.

Thanks 
MIke
