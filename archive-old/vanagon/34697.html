Subject: EV

I'm shortly going to be in the market for a new Mom's vehicle to replace the
country squire and all of the enthusiasm about the EV is beginning to have an
effect. 

I recently got a promo tape from from VOA(in respose to a request for the
Jerry Garcia poster which they didn't include) and noted that the EV was not
mentioned in either the tape or the promo material. Is the EV, or something
like it, still offered? I've only seen a couple and never been in one. Is it
honestly a match or superior to the Chrysler products. Same price range?

Thanks for your opinions,

Weston
