&gt;Hi Peter!
&gt;
&gt;I have an '81 air cooled Vanagon L with the Deluxe Camper package,
&gt;and an automatic transmission. Wish it was a manual stick though.

============

Oh, a Vanagon.  So I supose it's a *real* automatic X-mission, like in
other cars.(?)

The reason I asked is that I've owned several *stick-automatic* (or
auto-stick) bugs: where you still have to shift between three gears but the
clutch is replaced with an electrically activated (from the shift lever
itself) vaccuum servo and there is a torque converter that takes up the
slack.

On these vehicles the flywheel is replaced by a &quot;flex-plate&quot; that bolts up
to the torque converter in the bell-housing on the X-mission.  I used to
have a helluva time keeping the four bolts that connect the flex plate to
the torque coverter tight; they'd loosen up all the time (even though they
had lock-washers) and eventually contact the inside of the bell housing
which would make them loosen even faster and would quickly destroy the flex
plate, which was merely a thick, balanced piece of stamped sheet metal with
four steel nuts tack welded on the perimeter of the plate.  Crappy and weak
as it was, it was still expensive, and the nuts were soft and thus easily
cross threaded.

The really weird part was that at low RPM the bolts wouldn't contact the
bell housing (as they loosened) but at higher RPM this horrific grating
noise would suddenly appear as this plate &quot;flexed&quot; enough to cover the
distance to the bell housing and the bolt heads made contact.

Anyway, there were auto-stick buses in the seventies and I was just going
to tell you to use red Loctiite on the bolts to keep them in, and if you
ever heard the signiture grinding noise of the bolts on the bell housing to
STOP IMMEDIATELY and tighten them up.  Even glued up with loctite I still
had them come loose, just less frequently.

Well, I've typed so much that I think I'll make this a general post, just
in case there are some autostick list memebers out there.  And I'm glad
your engine isn't hosed.  Or would it have been better if it was the
engine? Oh well, I hope not---

Yours,

Peter
