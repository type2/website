Subject: Check those brakes too, folks

Eddie Hintz had a fine cautionary tale about spewing gasoline.  My
cautionary tale is about brake line grommets, those little rubber
doughnuts that keep your metal brake lines from rubbing on other
metal parts.

Given the unprecedented hot spell here in balmy southern Michigan,
(temps in the 45 F range!!) I was rooting around under my '62
getting ready for a valve adjustment, when I noticed
that the rubber grommets were missing or broken from
both my rear wheels' brake lines.  Fortunately it had happened
recently enough that there was no shininess or chafing evident
(&quot;chafing,&quot; don't you hate that word?).

I don't want to think about what could have happened if the line
had worn through and spewed all the fluid from my single-master-cylinder
system.

Be careful out there.
