Subject: Reprise: Sheet metal parts from J.C. Whitney?


I repost this in case everybody missed it.  I didn't get a single reply.  I
thought I'd get at least one...

  My '87 Synchro needs a little body work around the right rear wheel opening.
  One piece that will have to be replaced is the external skin of the arch
  itself.  I noticed that J.C. Whitney sells the piece for (I think) $50.
  Knowing what I've paid for other parts for my Vanagon, I would surmise It'll
  cost me a lot more from the local VW dealer, although I haven't checked.

  My question is: Has anybody on the list had any experience with Vanagon
  sheet metal from J.C. Whitney (good or bad)?  Vanagons were imported in low
  enough numbers that I doubt it would have been profitable to retool the
  part.  My guess is they're getting the parts from the OEM.

Thx,
