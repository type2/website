Who needs ground coffee?  Shove the beans in your mouth, chew, wash down
with rum.  Repeat.
=======================
ACTUALLY -- I have been introduced to something like that.  See's candy (here
in California) makes (chocolate?) covered coffee beans that you actually do
pop into your mouth, chew, and swallow.  I was introduced to them by my oldest
son.
