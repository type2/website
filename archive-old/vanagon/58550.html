Subject: Re: Cool Paint Ideas

I have been wanting to paint my '83 &quot;Sand&quot; Westy into a  Desert Camo
paint finish for quite some time. I figure, since I will probably never
sell my bus, I can paint it any way I want. The basic sand color has now
faded to a pretty good flat condition, so the addition of some
interesting blobs of light and dark brown, with some black details might
look just about right. A few choice markings - the tire air pressure in
k/bars - , the fuel tank capacity in liters-, etc, stenciled in a few
choice locations... A real butch bus!

Has anybody else done this?
