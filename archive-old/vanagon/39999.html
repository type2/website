I ordered a full carpet set from Rocky Mountain Motor Works (Bus Stop)
for my '73 Sportsmobile and was extremely pleased when it arrived!
Everything was a very good fit and the price (I thought) was
reasonable.  I happened to order a nice medium grey, but they have many
colors available.  It may not match your original perfectly, but RMMW
was one of the only places I found that had this carpeting precut and
in stock!

Usual disclaimers, just a pleased customer....
