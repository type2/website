&gt;When I was a kid just learning to read I took delight in road signs.   I
&gt;thought the most common town name was Falling Rock... except we never seemed
&gt;to arrive.  I wondered if it were a ghost town and kept a sharp watch for it.

=======================

When I first moved here to Texas a few years ago, I thought it was really 
weird how you could get to Crossover, TX from just about any road in the 
whole darn state.  It's on the left...

Still a kid I guess,
