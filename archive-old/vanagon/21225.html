Subject: Re: Garage door opener woes

&gt;Sue sez:
&gt;/  Our garage has a vintage Genie door opener which performed quite
&gt;/  well until recently.  It started opening and closing of its own
&gt;/  accord.

Same thing happened to my opener about two years ago. It kept doing this
until one time it kind of &quot;blew up&quot; and started smoking.

The fix was pretty straightforward. The problem was caused by a burned out
condenser of the large variety. Went to a local garage door repair place,
bought a new condenser, put it in (simple screwdriver job) and it's worked
ever since.

Hope this helps.

Jeff
