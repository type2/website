&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.

I have a couple &quot;emergency&quot; radios, and a regular sized car CB with
mag-mount antenna.  I don't have my regular one mounted because I couldn't
think of where I wanted it.  I have thought of something cool that I'd like
to do.  I want to be able to remove the radio, because I normally don't
want to have it in the bus.  It's really only handy when caravaning here on
the West coast.

I was thinking I would make it so I could slap the CB in the bus... and
hook into power and mike wiring already in place.  I would put a mike jack
on the drivers and passengers side, and and have it so the drivers mike
over rules the passenger (I'd always be driving). :)  The mike cord is a
bit short... so this would put less stress on the cord, and make it easier
for me to use the mike.  It would also allow another extension to be added
in the rear of the bus... should I get really wild.  Chances are I would
velcro the radio under the dash.
