&gt; Now, the possibility exists that they sent me the screen for the 97 instead
&gt; of the 95, although they did ask me which one I wanted and I told them.
&gt; But still, the missing snap was mentioned in the instructions so I'm
&gt; inclined to think that they simply screwed up.

	They screwed up.  I had the dealer install my screens (for free) as
part of the original purchase.  It took most of the day as they had to send
the canvas out to have the snaps relocated.  Now properly modified and
installed, the screen is great.  Fits very well and keeps the critters where
they belong.
