So Dan Houg says:
&gt; &gt; Well I still see mats at the dealer and occasionally look them over.
&gt; Dr. Intel :) asks:
&gt; &gt; some kind of material that will
&gt; &gt; protect the carpet.  I'd like to get something down before it gets
&gt; &gt; too worn.
&gt; I use the awful stuff your Aunt has in her home to protect carpet 
&gt; walk-ways, you know, that clear patterned vinyl stuff that comes in 
&gt; huge rolls at the fleet stores.  Actually, it installs very well with 
&gt; minor trimming and is not obtrusive.  At the rear edge, unscrew the 
&gt; OEM trim strip and place the back edge of the vinyl under that.  Then 
&gt; trim the parking brake area and up by the shifter.
&gt; 

To Dan and all the others that replied,

Did everyones grandmother have these?  ;)

Thank you all for helping to turn my luxo-van into an old persons
home.  ;)
