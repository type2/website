Subject: Re: '87 Syncro Engine Idle

&gt; This is the first time I've really had to work with an electronic ignition
&gt; system, and I haven't come up with the $60+ to buy a Bentley yet (too bad
&gt; there isn't a Haynes for this).  When it's hot and the AC is on I'm used to a
&gt; higher idle in cars but I think that 2,000 to 3,000 is a_bit_on the high
&gt; side.  My only prior experience with W/C VW's is with two Rabbits (1 gas and
&gt; 1 diesel).  Is this normal?  I don't think so!  What can I do for it?  Please
&gt; help!

This sounds like the symptoms of a bad idle stabilizer. When the idle 
stabilizer isn't doing its &quot;stabilizing&quot;, the idle settles in around
2000 to 3000. 

Is your idle high only with the AC on? When my idle stablizer went, 
it didn't matter if the AC was on or not. The idle would always be over 
2000.

It is a simple repair, although I don't remember how much the part cost.
