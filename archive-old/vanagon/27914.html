Subject: re: Tire recommendations wanted

Make sure you get a load range C or D tire on it. This will make a world of
difference in the handling - there is a lot of weight on these vehicles!
Some people on the list have had luck with
Michelin XZX tires, which apparently have reinforced sidewalls so that
they're at least approaching a C rating. I didn't have a lot of luck
finding them, or many other 14 inch tires with a C rating.  So I got a set
of Dunlop LT tires, range D, 185R75-14. These are basically
commercial-grade tires, no racing slicks here. I previously had 205R670-14
Armstrongs on it, they were very squirrely.
If you need to know more, let me know and I'll go out and look for the
specific numbers.

&gt;My &quot;new&quot; '87 Westy syncro came with chewed up tires which I need to replace
&gt;immediately. Any recommendations? Bad experiences? I'll be doing mostly
&gt;freeway driving, with some logging roads and a trip up the AlCan in the next
&gt;few years.
