Subject: Re: bra's

For $105 dealer price, the VW Vanagon bra is designed fot the Vangon - with a
hole properly situated on the dirver's side. I usually hang the bra over the
antenna, hook up the passenger's side hooks, then hook up the driver's side
hooks.

The bra also has the word &quot;vanagon&quot; embrodered in white on the front.

I have seen a bra twice that actually covers the front bumper of the '88-'91
Vanagons. I believe that it is sold by someone in Calif. It is more $$ and the
first one I saw was owned ba a woman in CA wha had had her local repair shop
pop-rivit snaps to each side of the front because she said that the bra would
not stay on in high wind conditions. It is set up set up with the &quot;foldover&quot;
covered flat strips like the VW one uses on the top of each side. The VW 0ne
has classic &quot;hooks&quot; that seem to hold much better. They simply slide onto the
edge of the metal.

&gt; Well, Vanagon bra's, actually.  Anyone know if the stock VW-brand
&gt; bra's come with a hole for the antenna?
&gt;
