&gt; Subject: Hard shifts

&gt; Hi all. This is my first attempt at posting a message after
&gt; spending 34,000 hours readin all the others!

You spent 3.87945 years reading this stuff?  Crazy! But
welcome to the land of the free and list of the brave.  I
hate to see someone write for the first time and not see a
response.  It's hard enough for people who write
occasionally to be ignored.

&gt; My first question - My beloved '86 syncro Westy sometimes
&gt; gets very hard to shift into first gear, say at a light. We
&gt; were cruising around central NH, saw two other vanagons -
&gt; are you there?, and towards the end of the trip the
&gt; engagement into 1st got difficult. New clutch at
&gt; 103,000miles, now 113,000+ miles. Is it possibly the fluid?

I have an '84 GL (non-Syncro) so I don't know if this could
be your problem too.  There was a recent thread on the
linkage and (usually, lack of) boot where shift linkage
enters the tranny housing.  This has a tendancy to get
crudded up over the years.  May or may not be your problem,
but it is worth a shot.  Lube all the linkage, check where
it enters the housing and clean/lube that.

Since you only have 10K on the clutch, shouldn't be a
problem, though the clutch slave cylinder may be going due
to the cold.  See if any brake fluid is leaking around the
slave cylinder on the tranny.

&gt; Shiftless minds want to
&gt; know. Tia. By the way , what is Flaps?

&gt; Michael Elkavitch

Shiftless minds and shifty eyes go together.  Flaps
is Friendly Local Auto Parts Supply or some such.
