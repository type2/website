&gt;  Hi,
&gt; 	If my girlfriend (Judy, BTW) and I want to join the trek we'll need to
&gt; meet up with it in spring (earlier the better for us) and combine it with
&gt; a US tour. Can anyone offer advice about the practicality of this, in
&gt; particular we'd need to buy a reasonably reliable &amp; habitable camper (in
&gt; California? New Mexico?) and insure it and then sell it after the trip.
&gt;  Unless, of course, someone could lend us one? We'd be happy to leave a
&gt; generous deposit &amp; promise to look after it :-).

It looks like the big &quot;trek&quot; will not get started until May at the earliest,
because many people can't make it until then.  More on that later...

&gt;  Could I get some idea of cost &amp; availability of a camper fitting this spec.
&gt; and maybe what it would cost to insure? Would we be able to take an out of
&gt; state van into California? How hard would it be to sell at the end of the trip?

There are plenty of campers for sale in my area (San Diego, Ca.) in the
$1,500-$2500 range that would probably be suitable.  I don't know about
insurance for you, since you are from out of the country, but my insurance
company (20th Century) insures my camper for almost nothing (about $30/mo).
You might give them a call when you get here...
&gt; 
&gt;  This is a serious possibility if these problems can be worked out, Hell we
&gt; might even be able to manage the whole trip!

That would be fantastic!  I hope you are able to work it out.  If there is
anything I can do to help, please let me know...
