&gt;I have begun receiving messages which indicate the original sender as sender
&gt;rather than the vanagon list as sender. I don't know if this is something
&gt;Gerry is doing or if my AOL software has begun doing this. 

I have the same problem, but we just did a ton of sendmail configuration
changes, so I figured it was a problem on _our_ end!
