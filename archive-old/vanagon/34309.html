&gt;Someone once mentioned that they might be working on a list of parts

&gt;have had bad luck with their door seals.  Others got seals that said 
&gt;WCM.  I know some of you order brake parts, seals, bearings, etc with 
&gt;regularity.  My problem is that I don't always know exactly what I am 
&gt;doing.  I mostly order from RMMW and pay a little to a lot more but 
&gt;know that they will send me a quality part that fits.  I would like 
&gt;see some positive and negative recommendations about what can safely 
&gt;be ordered from JCW and what cannot.  I need to save money where I can
&gt;and I still have a lot of brake and suspension parts between me and a 
&gt;run to Baja.  Jim

If your buying chrome parts beware!
A couple years back I bought a front bumper and headlight rings for my
'69 bug, EVERY time it rained they turned orange with rust! Very poor
quality but what can you really expect for $19 bumpers.
 Recently I gave them another shot, I bought a gas tank for a old
Willy's Jeep,JCW was the half the price of the other vendors and the
quality was good.

I guess JCW is like a box of chocolates... you know the rest.
