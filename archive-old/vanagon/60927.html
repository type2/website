The difference in rates is probably a statistical anomoly.  By chance, and
not due to safety problems, claims paid have averaged higher per vehicle
insured on one model as opposed to another.  Rates are based strictly on
the statistical record of claims experience.  That's how insurance
companies decide what's safer.
