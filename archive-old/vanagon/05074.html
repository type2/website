Well,

	I rained cats and dogs the day before yesterday, and when I came home
from work, I looked at the bus sittin' there in the driveway and thought,
&quot;hmm, I should pull the tarp down over the windshields a bit better; I 
_know_ they're gonna be leaking&quot;  So I go to grab the tarp, and it doesn't
budge.  Hmmm.  I look inside, and the tarp that is s'posd to be covering 
the bus is in the bus.  You see, I took the sunroof bow out to clean them
up in prep for the new top, so a pool of water formed in the top where there 
was no support, and it grew and grew until it almost reached the floor!

	The poor little bungee cords that were holding the tarp on were 
thretched worse than if Roseanne Barr had bungeed off the Golden Gate with 
them!

	So I bailed it all out, cleaned it us best as I could.  I guess I really
need to put the sunroof back in now...
