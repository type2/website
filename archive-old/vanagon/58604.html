  The Westphalia top came out of an 86 or newer (I remember it had

  from behind the front seats to about where the rear seat starts
  (when
  down flat) by the width of the van.  The roof is really set up well
  for
  having the hole cut...just remember the wiring.  There is a rear
  plywood
  section that was put on top of my existing roof (maybe this is
  integrated into the roof on a real factory job).  No holes were made
  for
  this.  The flip over section that completes the upstairs bed had to
  be
  raised about an 1.5&quot; above where it was originally designed to sit
  using some simple wooden spacers.  I like that though because I can
  leave food in my kitchen shelf when the bed is down.  So I think the

  whole unit sits up higher but the bed has enough clearance when it
  is
  flipped in its stowed position and the top is down.

  If I had a digital camera I could post pictures....
