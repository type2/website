So Bradley &quot;Pyro-boy&quot; says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What do ya mean 'don't need'???  There ain't no such thing as a VW
&gt; &gt; van I don't need....  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Says the man with one 1990 watercooled VW.  Follow in Thom's footsteps 
&gt; Steve... buy a couple old ones. :)
&gt; 

Believe me, I'd love too.  I'm looking for a split single or double cab.

I haven't purchased up till now because mucho buck were tied up in a
second house.  I still have to be careful with the finances!

Responsibilities my boy!
