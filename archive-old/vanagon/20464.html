Subject: Re: John Muir


I need to correct Steve's remarks a la Muir...I NEVER  have fallen
on the bash-Muir bandwagen...like Steve...Muir got me into the
repair my own...and then into the repair other's VW business...

I do however admit to being a member of the &quot;Chilton makes
good toilet paper in a pinch&quot; Club.
