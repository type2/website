Nope.  I have a 1995 Eurovan Winnebago.  The top resembles the 
configuration I had with my 1988 Westy, i.e. luggage carrier over the 
driver and pop-up top with tent over the passenger compartment.  That's 
where the second bed goes.  BTW, the top is on pressurized struts, like 
a mega-version of hatchback struts.

Apologies to anyone who thinks this exchange was superfluous...
