Subject: pittsburgh, anyone??

Is there anyone out there around the Pittsburgh area (+- 1hr) who is
willing to give me a hand in diagnosing and evaluating the engine of
my '73 bus? 

I acquired it recently and would like to get some comments on the
condition of the engine, hints for making it run better, etc.
Unfortunately my knowledge in mechanics is very limited, but I'm
definitely looking forward to having fun with it.

Please get back to me by e-mail.

Cheers,

-Jose A.
