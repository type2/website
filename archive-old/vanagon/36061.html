Subject: One Intake Manifold Hot!!!

I have an '83 Camper with the air-cooled engine and have discovered that the
#3 intake manifold is running very hot while the other three are still
running cool.  Is the signs of a bad valve?  Can anyone give me a list of
possible causes to check out?

Thanks

Greg Henry
