Subject: Butting Heads with Transform

To All:

Seems to be my day for it.  First, JCW overcharges me ninety bucks for a pair
of front wheel bearings then Transform sends me some junk... and has the gall
to tell me &quot;You received exactly what you ordered.&quot;

Isn't that neat?  Jeff the Omnipotent, guru of customer relations at
Transform is apparently able to project his mind the hundred miles from his
office to my shop and peer over my shoulder as I opened the package.

Having pulled the tranny on my '65, I saw it as a good opportunity to replace
the nose cone and hockey stick, installing a '67 or later nose cone to get
the backup-light switch, and a new hockey stick, which 'Jeff' (no last name
offered) at Transform implied they carried.

What arrived today was a nose cone WITHOUT a backup-light hole, although the
bill read 'NC RB Swg-bus w/switch hole'.  So much for 'getting exactly what I
ordered.'   To top it off, the nose cone, which was used, as I expected it
would be, had a nice shiny coat of paint glopped onto it... but spots of
hardened crud on the inside.   And the hockey stick wasn't new, it was used,
although plated with cadmium to bring the shaft back to spec. 

I wanted a NEW hockey stick.  I've already got USED hockey sticks that are
closer to spec than this piece of crap.  If I wanted junkyard parts I'd go to
a junkyard and pay junk prices, not the $107.51 floating there on the bottom
line.

Called them.  Got the 'exactly what (you) ordered' bullshit.  I said
something appropriate to the occasion, hung up.  I've no time for idiots.
 Then Jeff calls ME,  upset that I might have 'misunderstood', finally agreed
that I could return the mechandise &quot;...if that's what you wish.&quot;   Eh?  Did
he think I was just kidding when I ordered a post-'67 nose cone?  Or that I
would really pay forty bucks for a USED hockey stick when I've got a coffee
can full of the things under the bench? 

Having been in business, and dealt with the public, I understand that errors
can occur in the best-run organizations.  A good rule is to make things right
with the customer and try to learn from the exception.  What I ran into with
Transform was the assumption that they were incapable of error -- that the
customer HAD to be wrong (&quot;You received exactly what you ordered.&quot;)

When I was in business I had this quaint notion that I should listen to my
customers before shooting off my mouth.  Just old fashioned, I guess.
