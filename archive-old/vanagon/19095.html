Subject: RE: 77 price comparison

Truly! I saw a couple 1990 Vanagons and a 1990 Westy advertised this past
weekend... the Westy was +10,000 more than the plain Vanagons! Same with the
bay windows... micros are as far out of my price range as Vanagons and
Eurovans...

Seems very high, even for mint shape. My '78 in '84 cost $2200 Cdn in 
average shape. And you're talking US $$!!  Non-Westys just don't hold their 
value that well!  tim s.
