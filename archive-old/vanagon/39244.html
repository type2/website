Subject: Turbodiesel vanagon conversion

I'd like to know if anyone has installed a VW turbodiesel engine in a 1982
vanagon diesel
1.Are there clearance problems with the left motor mount?
2.The manifolds and turbo will be bolted on a 1986 diesel (hydraulic) block;
any difficulty with oil return lines, oil feed lines or downpipe to muffler?
3.How important are the oil squirters that spray the bottom of the pistons?
The '86 block has no squirters.
4.Does the turbodiesel engine have a thicker head gasket?
ANY info. anyone has to share about this conversion will be greatly appreciated.
P.S. This is a GREAT service; glad to be on board.
