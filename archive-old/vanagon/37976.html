Subject: One-piece exhaust for '78 Transporter?

Hi all

I was noticing the other day in a JC Whitney catalog, that there is a
one-piece exhaust system that can be installed in place of my several-
piece exhaust system on my '78 Transporter.  It handles everything rear
of the heat exchangers.

I need to replace most of the equipment rear of my heat exchangers, so
I was wondering if anyone has had any relevant experience of this or similar
setups, or if I should go the (many) extra bucks and more time for a
complete replacement of all the original parts.

Any input would be real real helpful!  Samiam's getting a little too
loud for comfort, and I'd be wary of any exhaust leaks...

	Thanks
		Jay
