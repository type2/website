Subject: Cost of restoring '67?

Hi Everyone,
	I have a question for those who have spent time and money 
bringing old tired buses back to life.  I was wondering if I could get a 
ballpark figure about the costs of restoring a 1967 bus with a camper 
interior. I hope to do most of the work myself. The interior is in good 
shape, in terms of the wood panels and cabinets. The body has rust holes 
in the rocker panels, rust and holes in both the cab and back floors, the 
front panel is dented, and the support members for the jacks are almost 
non-exsitent.  It has been sitting in a barn for 10 years and has no 
engine. I realize this may be somewhat incompelete info and each project 
is unique but any ideas or information would be greatly appreciated.
-Greg
