Subject: Heater boxes a rip off?

I need heater boxes for a '81  2Liter -- the cheapest I've found any are 
$201.00 each. This is absurd! And yes, I've looked in the junkyards -- none
exiest in the state of Wisconsin as far as I can tell. There is a very nice
yard in Luxemburg, WI with mucho VWs, BTW. Called SAS, Inc. But they sold all
of theirs. Anyway -- does anyone know of a cheaper source? If I could get the
square connectors, I'd probably just fabricate a pair. 
   Please e-mail me direct as I only read the list on the www now. Thanx.
