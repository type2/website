Subject: tune-up 84 westy

Im looking for tips on tune-up of 84 westy. I was unable to find
anything about it on the archives(although Im sure it must be in there
somewhere). This will be my first attempt at a tune-up so any
information would be greatly appreciated. I have a bently, a timing
light, and dwell meter but have no experience with using them. T.I.A.

Dave
