Subject: .82 gear for 4th gear?

Dennis Haynes&quot; &lt;dhaynes57_at_msn_dot_com&gt;wrote
&gt;...It may also be feasible to replace the 4th gear 
&gt;instead of both ring and pinions. This would be a relatively low cost &gt;way to 
&gt;change the final drive ratio. 
	Anyone done this to a syncro? 
	What was the reduction in RPM's?
	How much in parts/labor?
I think this, coupled with a larger tire, might be the way to cover
distances out here in the West more easily.
