FYI Gene Berg sells those dipstick oil guages too. Very cheap (compared to
all of his other stuff, and pretty useful IMHO

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;      About the dipstick oil temperature guage..... I had one on
&gt;&gt;&gt;my '67 bus for many years.  It was electric, not mechanical like the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;on my bug.  I thought it was great.  No problems; I bought it from
&gt;&gt;&gt;J C Whitney.  Just one data point for you.

&gt;I made one for my 71 beetle years ago. I found out that oil temp was
&gt;lower running on freeway than in town. My vanagon's coolant temp has
&gt;similar effect. The temp gauge tends to go slightly lower on flat freeway
&gt;(not hills) than in town.
