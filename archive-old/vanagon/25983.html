Subject: Re: Hit from behind by a car going 90mph

You have my sympathy.  I lost my 71 last year due to an idiot that was 
too busy doing other things to drive her car.  I'm still dealing with the 
ins.  I found in my price digging that a 71 westy in the condition that you 
described is woth 3-4,000 dollars, at least here in N.J..  There are 
publications, such as the old car guide, that list prices.  A appraisal 
by a known VW authority, doesn't have to be a dealer, helps too.  Is 
there anyway that the bus could be fixed, or is it more than just 
rewelding new panels and pounts in?  Good luck with everything and keep 
me (us) posted.
