&gt;Sigh. Now we'll really have to get a Syncro Westy...

Well, if there are a few, we could *do* the Gap.
I trust you are listening, Derek!

I've spend some time in Ushuia, BTW, visited several times
as part of a former job. It is set in the mountains, directly
overlooking a dramatic strech of the Beagle Canal. Like much
of Argentina, a very diverse and interesting  culture, very cosmopolitan
compared to other towns in that part of the world. 

Never seen an organized campsite there, can't imagine where it might be,
though there is winter skiing, great hiking, and plenty of world class
fly fishing. Even in mid-summer, weather can be raw, rainy and windy.
You'll want your Propex heater!
