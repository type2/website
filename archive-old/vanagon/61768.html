Subject: Re: Fuzzy Gasket

I'll try this one.  The Vanagon (and I presume Caravelle) versions had
vents in the upper rear cabin area for fresh air.  There are four levers
on the dash control.  The fourth (bottom) lever opens a fresh-air flap
at the bottom of the heater unit.  This allows air to travel through a
metal channel in the dash (which makes it a bitch to get to anything
under there, through the doors, up the door posts and through to the back
vents.  The Transporters all seem to lack this lever, flap, gaskets and
vents.  The early Westfalias were built from Kombi models, and also lacked
these.  Later Westies were built from &quot;Camper&quot; bases, and this feature was 
on these.  I have only seen the vents on the passenger side, and the
driver's side probably does nothing (I don't have a late westies, so please
correct me!).  The passenger versions have vents on both sides (two per
side in the rear).  I am busy adding these vents to my doublecab, but have
not started to change the heater unit to one with the proper flap.  The
DC has fixed rear windows (as does the Kombi) and really *needs* the
ventilation.  

The blue lever on the lower doors does not connect to this system on any of
my versions.  It is also not covered in my owner's manuals.  I have no idea
what (if anything) this contraption does!  I am a believer that VW never
spent a cent they did not have to.  Anybody know what the blue lever does?
My '80 is in the Bay Area so I can't check, but I thought the function of
this thing was covered in *that* owner's manual.

&gt;  I just replaced both fuzzy gaskets on my 87 westy. i bought them from a 
&gt; wrecker for $5cdn each - they connect the vent (blue sliding heater 
&gt; control on bottom) passages to the rear (above sliding door in Westy). 
&gt; Why there is said passageway on drivers side door I have no idea - where 
&gt; does it go? No vents in left hand valence. I believe they are available 
&gt; from VW for about $30 or something.

&gt; &gt; Hi Listees:
&gt; &gt;             I'm looking for the 'fuzzy gasket' that goes between the
&gt; &gt; drivers (or passengers) door and the door post. I assume that it is for
&gt; &gt; the heat or air transfer from rear to front. This is for an 86 Westy.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks if you can help, or even if you can't. You are all the greatest
&gt; &gt; and am learning a bunch..........
