Subject: S. African Type2 article


In the June 1995 issue of VW Motoring (from the UK) is an article
on South African VWs...most of which deal with the Type2s over
there. Included is a photo of an Audi 5cyl crammed into the 
engine compartment.

If anyone wants a photocopy of it...send me a stamped self addressed
envelope, and I'll send you a copy.
