Subject: Re: Middle Seat for 87 Vanagon GL Westphalia Camper

I'd be surprised if the threaded inserts are missing from the floor on the
camper -- they are there on my kombi, and I just bolted in the rails from
another van (actually, I got the seat and rails from an '82 Westy -- kinda
odd...).

The bolts (and the plastic plugs) are accessible from above, but the real
flooring is corrugated metal.  If you're not down to the body-colored metal
floor, you're not down far enough.  I think by '87, the campers typically had
that raised-square-patterned vinyl flooring -- you'll need to go past this.
On most Vangons, there is another layer of formed foam-padding below the
carpet -- it has a pattern molded into it to fit the corrugations in the
floorboards.  

I don't know if the standard middle two-person seat from a 7-seat van will
fit in a camper with the refrigerator in place -- the one I pulled this seat
from had the refrigerator removed at the time.  It looks promising, though.
My seat is 46&quot; wide, and the space between the refrigerator and the closed
door (on an '80 Westy) is about 48&quot; -- so it might *just* clear.

Anybody know why one of the seat rails is longer than the other?  I think
you'll have to cut the long seat rail -- or get two of the short ones.
