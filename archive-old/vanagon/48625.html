Subject: Re: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS and greed and so forth...


&gt;I am deeply saddened by Richard Palmer's post about the t-shirts and
&gt;stickers and how he has to refrain from using the &quot;type2&quot; list name because
&gt;the list administrator has &quot;plans&quot; for it.

&gt;I have to admit also that the greed of the new list admin bothers me.  I am
&gt;glad it's not the case here on the water-cooled list.

While everybody here has a perfect right to his/her opinion, and
additionally a perfect right to base that opinion on inference, prejudice
or whimsy as he sees fit, the admin in question would like to interject:

The &quot;plans&quot; I have for the type2 list name are to print stickers and
T-shirts, in order to sell them for more than they cost me. If I can't, I'm
in the red, not you lot. If I can, the extra can go a few inches toward
paying what the list costs. It costs a good bit, *all* of it straight out
of my wallet.

(Getting this? The aircooled list is completely and utterly free for its
almost 400 subscribers around the globe because I pay for the bandwidth. No
tax money. Accusations of avarice are just a little hard to take when I'm
the only one paying out.)

I have no intention of ever trying to make a profit off the list. I do it
because I love Busses and I love the people involved; they (and you) are
excellent people. But I *might* not be reviled for trying to mitigate the
cost of bringing it to its subscribers by selling them something they want
to buy at prices they agree to pay. And if stickers and T-shirts were a
gold mine, then Poor Richard wouldn't still be poor, would he?
