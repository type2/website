&gt;From: Mark Janello &lt;mjanello_at_umich_dot_edu&gt;:
&gt;There was a thread recently on rec.autos.tech about MAACO and the
&gt;consensus was that they are crap.  People told of peeling, oxidided,
&gt;finishes in 6 months or so, and general shodiness (shoddiness? is that
&gt;a word?).

I had my Toyota Celica painted at MAACO (independently owned and
operated) about 9 months ago.  The whole episode left a bad taste
in my mouth about them, but that notwithstanding, the quality of the
finish appears to be worth what I paid (~$500 with some minor body
work).  Some metal filings were left on the surface which have now
produced tiny rust marks through the paint.  The body work was good
and the condition (peeling, fading) of the paint (silver) 
at this point appears good.  A couple of years in the Arizona sun 
should fix that, however.  :-)

When they got the car, it was promised in 2-3 days.  After 10 days 
headed into two weeks with more promises, I started getting mad.  It
was obvious they hadn't even begun the job.  When I gave them a 
deadline that I was coming to get the car, it got painted, but just
before I arrived.  The clown peeling the paper off the car managed
to scuff the hood (like a paper cut, only to the new paint).  They 
tried to pass this off as a *bug flow* and attempted to touch it up.
I demanded a repaint of the hood, and they gave me a new appointment
2 months hence.  At that time, rather than repaint the entire hood
like they should have, they sanded and spot-painted the scuff, so 
that now I have a two-tone hood.

FWIW, all the places I went to in that price range seemed like
scumbags.  MAACO seemed a little less so, but I learned otherwise.
What great service, eh?  I won't be taking the bus to them for any work.

Caveat Emptor.
