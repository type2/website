Ok, Joel, can you tell us how you're going to hook that up to your 
3270 Terminal? &lt;major grins&gt;  (I know you have a PC -- I'm just ribbin' ya).

Don't worry guys, he isn't a real person.  It's really a decoy.  There's 
this huge database of VW info stored at VW of America, and they've put it 
on random... it just spews out stuff every once in a while  (How else do 
you explain the volume and precision?)
