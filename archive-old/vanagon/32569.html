List abusers,
I'm looking for someone to buy me list stickers. I'd like to have some, but
I think someone should buy them for me. (What a selfish jerk, eh? &lt;grin&gt;)

So, if you can spare $5 to a good cause (keeping me [somewhat] happy so 
I keep running the list) I'd appreciate it.

E-mail me directly and I'll get you my snail mail address and a repost of 
the sticker advertisement if you've lost it.
