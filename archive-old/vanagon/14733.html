Subject: Re: DIESEL VANAGON QUESTIONS

Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 31-Mar-95 DIESEL VANAGON
QUESTIONS by Susan &amp; James Kramer_at_igs 
&gt; 1) How long does the engine last, or better phrased, how much shorter is
&gt; the life expectancy than in a Rabbit?

130K miles on my vanagon (had a fresh head installed at 125K miles)


&gt; 2) After the 5 minute acceleration lead-up, at what speed can the Diesel
&gt; Vanagon cruise comfortably on level highway?

Mine has seen 69 mph (downhill -tailwind -drafting a truck -fresh hamsters)
but seems most comfortable around 55~60 mph


&gt; 3) What are people's actual experiences with mileage around town and on the
&gt; highway?


Currently gettting ~23 to 25 but either injectors are worn or pump is
set too rich.  I hope to pick up fresher injectors soon, then twiddle
with the pump.

&gt; Any feedback about pros and cons particular to Diesel Westfalias would be
&gt; appreciated.


Pittsburgh is not the place to own a diesel vanagon. Too many hills.
I'm almost constantly winding it against the governer trying to maintina
with traffic.   Probably a whole lot sweeter somewhere where it's level,
like Fla.
