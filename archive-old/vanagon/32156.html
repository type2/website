Subject: Re: Alternator Bearings (90 Amp)

&gt;for the 90 amp alternator.  I'm being told &quot;no&quot; here.  Anybody else had any
&gt;luck getting these bearings?

All bearings have enough info on them to look them up and cross reference if
needed. Can you get them out?  Can you get your alternator rebuilt for less
than VW/FLAPS quotes?  Older VW manuals were thorough about starter and
generator/alternator rebuilding, no more.... Tim
