On my '85 and '87 the plastic fan is rubbing on the housing, nice plastic 
screech as it grabs.  Very bad in cold weather when everything has shrunk or 
warped from the temp change.  A hot heater core and cold plastic still don't 
work.  On the '85 I removed the motor WD-40'd and re-installed, oh, yes had 
to remove the dash ;&lt;, 7hrs (dealer said 4 _at_ $65/hr, fan was going to cost 
$250.00 on top).  Currently the '87 is screeching like the '85 before it 
froze solid. When this happens I turn it to 3 an let it spin/grind. Been 
doing this all summer. It has gotten better! Used to lockup if left on 1, 
screech on 2. now fine on all levels.  Moral: run the fan as much as 
possible, let it wear in.  The motor is fine!! but it won't be if it keeps 
binding, you will bake something, blow fuses.   Tim Smith
