Subject: PNW gathering

With all this talk about 'tree trimmings' and reunions at Big Sur, I'm
wondering if there is enough momentum for a PNW gathering of the VW owners
this year.
Last year's kind of petered out before it ever got started, but maybe
there's enough people with working heaters this year?

I know this great spot on the coast - waves, surf, rain, wind - in other
words a typical PNW winter vacation. And I just happen to be free over Xmas
break. For me location is more flexible than time - my wife is a teacher
and has a pretty set schedule (unlike us software types with a bit more
scheduling leeway!)

Anyway, interested?
