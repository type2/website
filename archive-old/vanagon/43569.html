Here's what I have from my T4 brochure library:

Diesel 1.9 litre (non-turbo)
61 hp _at_ 3700 RPM
127 Nm Torque _at_ 1700 - 2500 rpm
4 Cyl.

Diesel 2.5 litre (non-turbo)
78 hp _at_ 3700 rpm
164 Nm Torque _at_ 1800 - 2200 rpm
5 cyl.

Diesel 1.9 litre Turbo (Known as TDI in US)
70 hp _at_ 3700 rpm
148 Nm Torque _at_ 1800 - 2400 rpm
4 cyl.


I picked up a brochure on the Turbo Diesel in France this past January...its 
about 9&quot; tall by 3 &quot; wide...on the cover is the front end of a T4 delivery 
van....with the message &quot;Open here&quot;....the hood on the brochure cover opens 
up to reveal the message &quot;Turbo and more!&quot;

Hope this helps.
