Subject:      Re: Skylight in pop-top

&gt; The skylight in our Westy has been cracked several times, due to intense
&gt; heat, no doubt.  After several attempts at home repairs we are now ready
to
&gt; replace the entire unit.  The VW dealer in our area (Ontario) retails the
&gt; piece at a wholloping $380 (CdN)!
&gt; (or about six bucks U.S.!)  What other options do we have?  I suspect
we'll
&gt; replace this unit more than once.


I have replacement skylights  for $119 with list member discount.  Would be
US $136 including air-mail delivery to Canada.
