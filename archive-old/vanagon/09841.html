&gt;That exhausts my ideas - anyone have this sort of a problem before and
&gt;have this WONDERFUL simple and elegant solution that will get me back
&gt;slogging through the rain.

once, a long time ago, in a land far far away, i had a similar problem with
a 71 bus. it was the mechanism: it needed greasing, and was too dry to be
moved by the motor. i had to remove the wiper arms and let the wiper arm
shafts drop back down into the dash and spread grease all over them (and on
the joints of the arm-moving mechanism). then put it all back together. and
it all worked fine.

i also had to do this on my 80 vanagon ... and it is a BITCH on a vanagon:
you can't get your hands up in there to grease the shafts ... you'll have to
get a long handle spoon-type thingie to reach down in thru the ash tray or
up behind the glove compartment or up beside the master cylinder. but it does
help.

hope it helps.
