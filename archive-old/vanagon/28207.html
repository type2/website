&gt;     hi everyone,
&gt;  i talked to a local vw &quot;mechanic&quot; today and i don't know how we got on that
&gt; subject, but anyways: he says he routinely disconnects the thermostat in bus
&gt; engines (remember, that accordeon-looking thingie under the right lower
&gt; engine tin with the wire connection to the cooling air flaps in type IV's).
&gt; his reason was that if it ever fails (i.e., gets stuck in the &quot;cold&quot;
&gt; position) the engine fries. according to him, no damage is done if the flaps
&gt; are always in the open position (i.e., thermostat disconnected). is that
&gt; generally true or is it just because we have that REALLY mild climate here
&gt; on the oregon coast? any opinions out there ?


  I've got one. Your local VW &quot;mechanic&quot; is an idiot.

  First of all, when anything fails in the thermostat hardware, it fails
  so that the flaps open. The thermostat PULLS them closed against a spring.

  The last thing your poor cylinder heads need is to be subject to the 
  stresses introduced by continuous heating and cooling. The thermostat
  helps them stay at as constant a temperature as possible. Leaving the 
  flaps open doesn't prevent overheating - when the engine is warm and
  working, the flaps open up allowing, you guessed it, the same amount
  of cooling air as if there was no thermostat. 


  Dave
