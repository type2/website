Subject: RE: Overflow while filling the gas tank

&gt;From: &quot;Ervolina, Thomas R. (Tom)&quot; &lt;ervolina_at_watson.ibm_dot_com&gt;

&gt; suddenly fills up and spits back this huge spray of gasoline that gets all
&gt; over my coat, shoes and gloves.  So the whole way home we get to enjoy
&gt; those wonderful fumes -- yuck!  Has anyone else experienced this?

I think we all have experienced this.  I believe it's a combination of the
small pipe diameter and the opening being just above the tank.  That's how
I see the problem.

I usually slow down the gas just before it gets close to full.  This should
avoid the overflow.
