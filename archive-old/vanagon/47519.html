&gt; but dual exhausts would seem the way
&gt; to go to reduce backpressure.  Just a thought.

Yeah, but it would play hell with the FI, which counts on a single O2
sensor.  My Acura has dual exhausts (all stainless, drool drool) and they
did it right, dual O2 sensors, and the FI senses on a per-bank-of-three.

Doubt that it would be retrofit-able to a veedub.

Do type 1 exhausts fit?  The little bugger sure looks like a wet type 1,
and not like the type IV at all.
