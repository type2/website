Subject:       Re: What is VW Karma?

&gt; When I bought my '86 Vanagon GL, it had little star stickers on the 
center of
&gt; the wheel covers.  One day I peeled one off - to my horror I discovered an
&gt; embossed (gasp) Chevrolet bow tie logo.  Thinking quickly, and with no regard
&gt; to my own safety, I pulled the other wheel covers off and rammed them into the
&gt; trash can.
&gt; 
&gt;  My wife, watching from the window, commented: &quot;Now it looks like hell.  Why
&gt; did you do that?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;Karma,&quot; I replied, &quot;bad karma to leave a situation like that to fester. 
&gt; Volkswagen vehicle requires Volkswagen wheel covers to insure safe operation.&quot;
&gt; Wife stared at me for a long time, finally said nothing and closed the window.
&gt; 
&gt;  It took about two weeks to find original wheel covers and now all is well.
&gt; 
&gt;  But to my question.  What is Karma?  I've tossed that phrase off over the
&gt; years without really knowing what it means.  How does one maintain good Karma?
&gt; How does one eliminate bad Karma?  Is Karma like Luck?  Is Karma like a bank
&gt; account? Can you build up good Karma by helping old ladies across the street
&gt; and use it later when driving home after a few beers?
&gt; 
&gt;  More specifically, what is VW Karma?

Sounds very much like when we got our 85 Jetta - it had cheap fake 
chrome wheel covers, which I promptly removed. But I was pleasantly 
surprised to find the original VW centre caps underneath, which had 
been sprayed black! A few hours work with Autosol cleaner and her 
Karma was restored! Why anyone would paint &amp; hide stainless steel 
caps is beyond me. 

As for defining VW karma, I won't even try. I just pity those poor 
souls who have never experienced it...
