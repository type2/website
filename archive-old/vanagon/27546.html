&gt; &gt; You'd also have to rewire the heater so that power is supplied without the

&gt; My gas heater does not require the ignition to be on to function.  I 
&gt; thought this was the case for all gas heaters.  Hmm, learn something 
&gt; every day!  I find it surprising that gas heaters would be wired through 
&gt; the ignition, since part of their appeal is for heating the camper when, 
&gt; well, camping.  I don't leave my keys in the ignition when I'm 
&gt; camping--don't know about the rest of you FREAKS out there...  :-)
&gt; 

Your heater is just wired to a terminal that's &quot;hot&quot; whether the ignition 
is on or not.  Moving the connector would be simple, if you wanted the 
heater to shut off automatically when you stopped.  But that's how 
they're supposed to be wired.  The only time you should be able to run 
them w/o the ignition on is by the timer, since it bypasses the ignition 
wiring.  Check the schematics for the appropriate terminal location.
