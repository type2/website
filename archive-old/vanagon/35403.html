Subject: Little off topic - but what the heck...


Hi Ya'll

I know this is a bit off topic, but I couldnt help sharing the news of 
my discovery.  Youre all so concerned how to fix and maintain your VW 
machines, I thought Id throw in a possible way to fix the HUMAN 
machine.  The following info may not apply to all of you (I hope 
youre all healthy), but if you or anyone in your family (or any 
friends) have any of the symptoms of CELIAC they will thank you with 
the bottom of their hearts knowing about the informations. Its taken 
me 31 years to hear about it and only then by using the INTERNET.  
Needless to say it has caused a great deal of misery and suffering 
throughout my family tree.  I only hope I can help just one of you 
with my new and tremondously inproved health.

Little bit of other family improvements:

The latest scope is I convinced my younger brother to join me.  Even 
though he doesnt have alopecia or any history, he does have some 
symptoms of celiac disease.  Anyway, he 16 and has had a bad case of 
acne for about 2 years as you would expect for a kid his age, right.  
Well, this weekend I convinced him to join me on my diet and in just 
3 days most of his acne has disappeared.  Those are the facts.

Excuse me for getting off topic.

                         Celiac LISTSERV, Fact Sheet

                       Celiac Disease Information Guide
                        (Gluten Sensitive Enteropathy)

Copyright by Michael Jones, Bill Elkus, Jim Lyles, Lisa Lewis, and

Celiac disease is a chronic disease in which there is a 
characteristic though not specific  mucosal lesion  of the  small 
intestine that  impairs  nutrient absorption by involved bowel and
prompt improvement of nutrient absorption and improvement of the
characteristic intestinal  mucosal lesion on withdrawal  of wheat
gliadin (the toxic alcohol-soluble gluten fractions) and  the
equivalent barley, rye, and oat prolamins from the diet. (i)

                                Introduction:

In the United States, estimates of  this disorder are not available.
(ii)  It can be called celiac sprue, gluten sensitive enteropathy,
coeliac  disease, or celiac disease.  Previously  it was considered a 
children disease, while  the similar disorder in adults was called non
tropical sprue.

For celiac disease to be active, the celiac must have the genetic
potential to develop the disorder, there must be a source of gliadin
in the diet, and there must have been  a trigger factor.   Exploring
the  genetic background,  celiac disease may not  be found, but 
disorders that are  related to celiac  disease through the immune 
system may be  found.  The  associated diseases include  a skin
disorder, Dermatitis Herpetiformis;  Insulin Dependent Diabetes 
Mellitus (type I);  Systemic  Lupus  Erythematosus;  Sjogren's 
Syndrome;  Scleroderma, Grave's Disease; Addison Disease; Myasthenia
Gravis; Autoimmune Chronic Active Hepatitis; and Erythematosus. (iii)

It is an inherited disorder.  Information available suggests that 8 to
 12% of first degree relatives  (children, siblings,  parents) have 
the potential  to develop celiac disease. (iv)  Relatives should be
educated about the potential for developing celiac disease.

The onset of the  disease has no age  or sex restriction.   Medical
cases  are available showing celiac disease developing in infants
after  the introduction of grains and in mature adults who consumed
grains for many years.

Various trigger  factors have  been  reported.   Some  appear to  have
 celiac disease triggered by  the trauma  of surgery.   Women  often
develop  symptoms after delivering a baby.  Some celiacs report having
a virus  infection, which never recovers.    The 'virus  infection' 
continues  for weeks  until  it  is diagnosis as  celiac  disease.  
Severe  psychological stress  has  also  been reported as a trigger
factor.  Divorce, death of a loved one, or loss of a job can occur in
proximity to the onset of the disorder. (v)

                                  Symptoms:

Although symptoms  vary widely,  the most  common  manifestations are 
chronic iron-deficiency anemia,  which  is  not corrected  by  iron 
therapy,  chronic fatigue, and weakness.   Persistent  iron deficiency
 anemia may  be the  only symptom with which a celiac may present.
(vi)

Weight loss may be reported and a history of low body weight despite
excessive caloric intake.    In  young  women  with  undiagnosed 
celiac  disease,  this combination is often  mistaken as  an 'eating
behavior  disorder' (bulimia  or anorexia nervosa).

The degree  of intestinal  involvement and  complaints  varies from 
diarrhea, excessive gas, and abdominal pain to constipation or 
alternating constipation and diarrhea. (vii)  Frequently, the
variability of these symptoms leads to  a misdiagnosis of 'irritable
bowel syndrome'.

Other signs and  symptoms of  malabsorption may  be present  depending
on  the degree of damage to  the small intestinal mucosa.  
Additionally, other  organ systems are known to be affected.   Liver
enzyme values have been shown  to be elevated in 47% of a series of 
132 persons with celiac disease. (viii)  Many studies have  reported
decreased  spleen size  (hyposplenism)  in adults  with celiac
disease. (ix,x,xi)  Gall bladder contraction is  also impaired in many
untreated celiac adults.   Mechanisms  which may be  responsible for 
abnormal gall bladder contractions may also be operative in decreased
pancreatic enzyme secretion. (xii)  Untreated children with celiac
disease have also been  shown to have pancreatic deficiency. (xiii)

Untreated women  with  celiac disease  may  have obstetric  and 
gynecological problems.  Amenorrhea and  spontaneous abortions are 
reported more often  for untreated women than for  controls. 
Infertility was  shown to be more  common among untreated celiac 
women.  Fertility  and ability to  carry an infant  to term, returned
when the women followed a gluten-free diet. (xiv)

Dental abnormalities, specifically permanent-tooth  enamel defects,
have  been shown to be associated with celiac  disease in both adults
(xv) and children. (xvi)  They have also been  found in first degree
relatives of  celiac disease patients. (xvii)

Behavioral changes, such as irritability and inability to concentrate,
 may be reported in undiagnosed children.  Adults often relate
difficulties  in short- term memory  and  concentration.    Many
adults  report  that  these  problems persist, despite strict,
long-term dietary adherence.

Loss of calcium and the resulting decrease in bone density may be 
observed in the untreated  celiac.   Bone pain  or a  tendency to 
fracture bones  without regard to age can become a critical problem.

Celiac disease has  been called  the 'great  mimic' because  so many 
symptoms could be caused by other disorders.   In addition, the
symptoms can  vary from person to person.

A common problem for the undiagnosed  celiac is lactose intolerance.  
Lactose is the sugar in diary products.  It must be broken down by  an
enzyme, lactase before it can be absorbed.  This enzyme  is produced
on the tips of  the villi which line the small intestine.   When the
villi  are destroyed, as in  celiac disease, lactose from diary
products is  not absorbed normally.  When  lactose reaches the colon,
bacteria 'eat' the lactose and produce acid and gas.  Water rushes
into the intestine to dilute  the lactose.  The result is  watery,
acid diarrhea, bloating, and excessive gas.

                           Blood Sample Screening:

The recent  development of  blood tests  for the  detection  and
screening  of celiacs and  their relatives  have  produced a  useful 
aid to  diagnosis  and monitoring.  The tests have a clinical utility
in:

     .    Screening at-risk populations to identify biopsy candidates

     .    Providing information to support a diagnosis of GSE

     .    Monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet (xviii)

The blood samples required for  the tests can be  taken at a medical 
facility and shipped  to  a  lab  for  processing.    Laboratories 
that  performs  the serological tests are:

     Immunopathology Labatory,  Dept. of  Pathology, 5233  RCP,
     University  of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, 200 Hawkins  Drive,
     Iowa City, IA 52242-1081 (319) 356-2688/8470

     Pediatric Gastroenterology &amp;  Nutrition Labatory, UMAB/Bressler 
     Research Building, Room 10-047, 655  West Baltimore Stret, 
     Baltimore, MD 21201, (410) 706-1997

     Specialty Laboratories, 2211 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA
     90404, (800) 421-7110

                                  Diagnosis:

Laboratory values indicating nutrient  malabsorption, such as
decreased  serum carotene, folate, cholesterol, calcium, albumin, and
magnesium may aid  in the diagnosis.   Differential  sugar absorption 
tests  may point  to  generalized malabsorption. (xix)

The diagnosis is confirmed by:

     1.  A small intestinal biopsy consistent with diagnosis of celiac
     disease. 2.  Clinical response to the gluten-restricted,
     gliadin-free diet.

                                  Treatment:

Damage to the  small intestine  in those with  celiac disease  can
usually  be repaired.  Ravages of malabsorption of nutrients which are
seen in  other body organs can also be reversed.  The enzyme for
breaking down lactase  may return and lactose  intolerance  may  no 
longer  be  a  problem.    Infertility  and behavioral problems may
also  be reversed.  This  occurs when all wheat,  rye, oats, barley 
and  their  derivatives  are  eliminated from  the  diet.    The
treatment is effective, safe, and has no side effects.

If lactose intolerance is present, decrease the amount of lactose in 
the diet for the first few months.   This can be  accomplished by
eliminating the  high lactose containing diary products in the
celiac's diet, such as milk.

It is not  uncommon for persons  with celiac disease  to have
additional  food sensitivities.   If  a  celiac  is  still  having 
intestinal  symptoms  after eliminating ALL  wheat,  oats, barley, 
and  rye  from the  diet  and  lactose intolerance is not the 
problem, there may  be additional food  sensitivities, transient or
permanent.  (xx)  A  frequent food sensitivity  problem could  be soy.
(xxi)

                                  The Diet:

Get the most up-to-date  and accurate information on  the requirements
of  the gluten-restricted, gliadin-free  diet.   Use  the  resources
of  a  doctor,  a dietitian, and a celiac support group to  ease the
transition.  In a  few days the villi will return to normal,  the body
will absorb nutrients, and  general health will return.

The celiac must read every label from food to medicine, before it is
consumed. This must be  repeated for  every purchase, as  product
ingredients  routinely change.    Items  with  nebulous  terms  must 
be  omitted  until  the  actual ingredients are found to be
gluten-restricted, gliadin-free.  Labeling laws do not require  the 
referencing  of  ingredients  which  are  added  because  of
processing or packing.  Products which are 'dusted' or acquire
'contamination' from airborne grain dust must be avoided.

This is a diet for life.  Initially, the changes to your  lifestyle
may appear to be impossible.  The diet is extremely difficult for the
new  celiac because of the lack of  a one 100 per  cent accurate
guideline that  can be used  when purchasing foods and  medicines.  As
 many celiacs will  attest, you learn  to adapt and life can be very
enjoyable.

The  celiac  will  become  acquainted  with  mail-order  sources   of 
gluten- restricted, gliadin-free products.  Some primary specialty
vendors for the new celiac are:

file Vendor Memo.

                  Potential Long-Term Problems for Celiacs:

Decreased bone density  (osteoporosis and osteomalacia)  is a serious 
problem for celiacs.   Adequate  bone density  is  dependent upon 
many things.    One essential ingredient for strong bones is adequate
calcium.  If calcium  is not absorbed, due to small intestinal damage 
caused by untreated celiac  disease, bones are not as dense.   As
aging progresses, bone  is lost at a  predictable rate. 
Unfortunately, for those beginning  the process with less than 
optimal bone mass, the 'fracture threshold' is reached at a much
younger age.

Celiacs have a 78% greater occurrence  of cancers and lymphomas of the
 mouth, bowel, and  esophagus,  the  risk can  be  reduced  after 5 
years  of  strict adherence to a gluten free diet. (xxii)

A celiac's immunology is prone to many more allergies, secondary
reactions and subsequent diseases including chronic hepatitis,
arthritis, thyroid disorders, vision problems and eye disorders,
dental problems, ulcers, or cancers on oral mucus membranes.

                               Support Groups:

Celiac support groups  complement the information  available from the 
medical profession.  A goal of the support group is education and the 
distribution of information about the  disease.   For additional
information,  contact one  of these groups.

For additional information on a local or national group, refer to the
document Support Memo on the Celiac LISTSERV.

                             Cooking Techniques:

Most celiacs will change from modern cooking methods to more
traditional techniques.  Many libraries have  comprehensive  books or
the library's Inter- Library Loan Program can ease your transition to
these 'old' cooking techniques.  A cookbook that should be owned by
every celiac is Bette Hagman's, The Gluten-Free Gourmet and More From
The Gluten-Free Gourmet.

The use of alternate flours will enable the celiac to enjoy bread,
pastas, and desserts as before diagnosis.  Some of the flours are:
white and brown rice, tapioca, soy, potato, potato starch, and corn. 
Better results can be obtained through the use of a blend of these
flours.  Xanthan gum and guar gum are useful to prevent the normal
tendency for baked rice flour items to fall apart.  Red Star Yeast
operates a hotline for celiac bread machine questions. The phone
number is (800) 4-CELIAC.

A bread machine is a simple way for celiacs to obtain fresh bread with
a minimum of preparation or difficulty.  The selection of recipes
available for these machines will fill your desire for any type of
bread.  Prior to purchase, check with a local support group for their
recommendation on brands and where to buy a machine.  Some machines
are better than others and the design of a few machines  preclude the
use of alternate flours.
