Subject: Gas Prices, portent of things to come?, honeymoon

	Bay Area gas prices just went up pretty painfully- 
I can remember ( :) ) $1.37 for 89 octane, just paid $1.69 last
night. NPR story I vaugely remember hearing was that the major
oil companies saw no end to the rise in prices but I missed why
it was.

	Wedding and honeymoon went off without a hitch EXCEPT that
Little Martha's clutch cable failed the morning of the wedding and
I haven't had a chance to get back to fix it :( Hope this isn't
a sign of things to come now that its finally legal and has
a license plate and all. 

	Music at the wedding was performed by one of Martha Rubin's 
former music students, very well performed too. And my brother and 
sister-in-law carried the presents home for us in their Vanagon!

	Honeymoon in Pacific Grove: Saw many T2 &amp; Vanagons, including
a T2 Single Cab painted plastic-watering-can-green and a Splitie Single
Cab painted dark brown overall. Looked but didn't see any listmember's
stickers.
	Last time I was at Point Lobos was 1969- its fabulous and 
I recomend it to anyone passing that way. The new Outer Bay exhibit
at the Monetery Bay Aquarium is pretty cool too- two schools of tuna
+ baracuda, etc, behind a clear wall the size of an aircraft hanger.
And many jelly-fish exhibits.

	We ate many fabulous meals and spotted a extra place  we didn't have
time for, so if you're looking for a good meal in Pacfic Grove:
	Fandango. Very expensive. Worth it. ($60 dinner for 2 + $42 wine)
	The Fishwife. Moderate prices, excellent food &amp; service. 1/3 seats
		are reserved and 2/3 open, but the wait can be 1 hour+.
	El Crocodilo. Moderate prices, neat, central-american influenced food.
		(same owners as The Fishwife, it turned out)

	or Carmel:
	Cafe Gringo - new-wave Mexican/American, and tasty. Moderate-cheap.

	We didn't have a change to eat at La Boheim (sp?), but $21.50 fixed 
price for the nightly special, and no reservations taken, make it different
from the rest. Walked by two nights in a row, having already made other
plans, and it smelled WONDERFUL. We'll go back.

	Happy Motoring!
