&gt; Just catching up on the mail I noticed that David points out that you can't
&gt; lactate the oil temp at the pressure gauge. 
  ^^^^^^^
	That was an interesting slip!  :)

&gt;					I have heard this before, and that
&gt; this isn't event the best place for the pressure gauge, 

No, it's a fine place for the pressure gauge, but a bad place for the
*temparature* gauge...

&gt;							but I also ran across
&gt; the suggestion in a Bus Boys catalog that you could use the combo pressure
&gt; gauge and and a temp. gauge in the t fitting they sell. 

I don't see how they could use a temperature gauge in a &quot;tee&quot; setup at
the location of the stock oil pressure sender.  I really doubt that they
have a sensor extending down through the tee into the journal, which
would be the only way to get an accurate reading.  Otherwise, you would
be getting the temparature of the (stagnant) oil in the tee, which would
likely be a lot cooler.  I suppose it would be better than no temp gauge at
all, though...

&gt;						     They also have a nice
&gt; little plate that lets you mount three gauges in that space below the radio.

I hope they aren't asking much for it.  I got a similar thing from Car-Quest
for something under $10... chrome with three gauge holes, mounts at the
top to the bottom of the dash.

Cheers,
