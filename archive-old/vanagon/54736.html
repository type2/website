&gt; 'tis... Above idle my 81 Fuel Injected standard Vanagon runs great. BUT at
&gt; idle it runs very crappy. It never stalls, but it would be nice to have a
&gt; good idle. I've got a new battery, hotter spark plugs, new cap, rotor, and
&gt; points.

Why &quot;hotter&quot; plugs?  Because it's running rich?  If so, you need to 
adjust the idle mixture.  If you back out the idle mixture screw all the 
way and don't see improvement, then I'd try airflow meter adjustement as 
described in the archives.

Since you don't have an O2 sensor to use as a poor man's CO meter, you 
might want to have the idle mixture adjusted by a shop.  Just be sure 
they put the meter IN FRONT of the catalytic converter, not up the tail 
pipe.

&gt; By the by, are Vanagons supposed to be slower than a fully loaded 18 wheeler?

No, but they are not too much faster.
