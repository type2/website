&gt; Should the canvas be sprayed with anything, like water proofer?  Or is it
&gt; just important to pack it away dry and clean.  If there is a preservation
&gt; product, what is recomended?
&gt;
I got a non-aerosol bottle of tent water-proofer for about $10 at my local
outdoors-type store. It works really, really well. Just make sure the canvas is
reasonably clean before coating it.
