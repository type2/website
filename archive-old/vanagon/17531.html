If you are not subjected to California-style smog control, then you can do
without at least having to make it *look* functional. You should, however,
close the pipes. Otherwise, you will suck in fresh air (as opposed to
inert exhaust) and the engine will run too lean and get a bit hotter.

My '75 has an EGR valve that is operated by vacuum. It was easily closed
by disconnecting the vacuum hose. I'm not sure how the EGR is operated on
an '82; maybe by a rod on the throttle valve, which could be disconnected.
I believe the EGR system is designed so that no exhaust is recirculated at
idle; the point is to fool the EGR control thingy that you're always at
idle. Anyone correct me if this is BS. Thanks.
