Subject: Re; Auto stop and other propane

I have found  *no* propane technicians who know how to fill the tank.  You
must almost always coach them.  The knurled knob on the right is opened to
let air escape as propane goes in.  It is connected to an upended tube inside
the tank that is at the 80% level.  As the level of LP rises above that
point, Liquid Propane, rather than gas, comes out the valve.  This is when
the refueler shuts off the pump, and then the knurled knob is screwed closed.
 At this point, there is a lot of very cold propane shooting out right by the
knob.  It is helpful to carry some heavy rubber/rubberized canvas gloves, or
some channel lock pliers in the van to close this.  Note: do not overtighten
the knob. It is designed to shut off when finger tight.

If the tank won't take gas, the button on the left side of the valve (covered
with a removable robber boot) should be pressed in.

Also note.  When I changed out my tank due to rust (Inspect your tank!) I was
not able to remove the old auto stop valve (which wans't working anyway), so
good luck.  I was able to find one on an 87 junker.  Bought the tank and the
valve for $50.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not a propane expert, but I suspect mine doesn't work properly
either. I'm talking about the small, cylinder like (1cm diameter)
thing that sticks out to the right of the fill hose connection.
I understand that when the tank is full overflow propane is supposed to
come out there when the tank is more than 80% full. Is that right? 
Nothing comes out of mine. This hasn't caused any problem so far. I've 
used for about a year like that. The attendants at the propane filling 
stations I've been to just stop filling when they notice no more propane 
goes in. 

If my diagnosis is correct a possibly dangerous situation could occur
if the tank was filled to 100% (that is 100% liquid propane, as opposed
to max 80% volume liquid and 20% volume gas). The propane system could
be damaged due to heat expansion of the liquid, when there is no
gas to cushion the increased liquid volume. Right?
