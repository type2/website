Subject: Movies for Saturday Nite's Drive-in Night

Ok folks, 

Here's the lineup for the VW Van lists/LiMBO Drive-in Night at the Rustic
Drive-in, Rt. 146 Smithfield RI, just north of the junction of I295 &amp; 146,
this saturday night, August 9th.

Screen 1 - Hercules &amp; George of the Jungle

Screen 2 - ConAir &amp; Face-Off

Screen 3 - Buddy &amp; Men in Black


As you can see there's something for everyone...movies start about 8:15 or
so...be there around 7:00 - 7:30 for a good spot.

See you there!

Ric
