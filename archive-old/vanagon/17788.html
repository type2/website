Subject: RE: Rain-x



I have used rain-x once and was very impressed with it's
water beading qualities.  Unfortunately the windscreen
wipers would 'shudder' and 'jerk' across the windscreen
quite violently, so I haven't used it since.  I think the
problem is with the hinges that allow you to pull the
wiper arms away from the windscreen, which are sloppy from
wear and tear.
