Subject: Re: Westy Mystery Bracket

My, my... the telepathy running wild on this list. I was JUST thinking
about sending a post in search of a used swivel table for my '77. That is
what the two braces are for, the ones left of the sink in Westies.

So who knows where to find a table??

Also, how do you determine if the engine &quot;runs lean&quot; or &quot;runs rich?&quot; The
black carbon deposits on the plugs of my '71 Super is an indication of
one or the other, right?
