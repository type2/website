Subject: overheated AC fan switch/86 Westfalia

The air conditioning fan/thermostat switch (VWA part # 175 272 327, cost
$42.00) on my 86 Westfalia last about 14 months before it fails due to
overheating of the switch internal components resulting in loose terminals
and charred insulator material around the &quot;B&quot; terminal of the switch.  The
ac fan works ok and the correct fuse is in place.  This is a different
switch from the non-Westi air conditioning unit.

Has anyone experienced this?
