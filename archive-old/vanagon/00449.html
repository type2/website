&gt;&gt;I just put a set of Blaupunkt 5 1/4 speakers in my scirocco
&gt;
&gt;The Vanagon comes from the factory with Blaupunkt speakers in the front.
&gt;
but the ones in the Vanagon SUCK!!!!!!!!!

The only other problem about using the stock holes is that the window crank
sweeps over them, and they are half (ok, maybe a quarter) covered by the
dash when you close the door!!!  If you use the stock holes you have to find
something that is flush mounted, or has a very teensy grill.

That's why I moved mine.  You could mount them anywhere, but on the bottom
there is a hole the the inner sheetmetal, and it's close to the hinge (less
G's on the speaker when you slam the door, less likely to work loose)
