&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.

I installed mine behind the dash, with the connector for the microphone
emerging just to the right of the lighter.  I am using a Cobra HH-70, which
has all of the controls in the handpiece.

I mounted a permanent antenna just above the rear right-side reflector.
