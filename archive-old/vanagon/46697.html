Subject: FWD: [FS] `89 Syncro Westy

El Listos,

I know nothing of the below vehicle, apart from what you see below.  This came
to me via a classifieds bb which has a great number of westies, though all
mostly
way overpriced.  So for anyone who wants what appears to be a reasonably priced
sycnro . . . .


    VW - Vanogon,   '89,   -   $10,988,     Seattle
       - Dealer, (206)641-2002 
       - Options: Conversion / camper, AT
       - Desc: SYNCRO Nice (Dealer number: 11088) Dealer
