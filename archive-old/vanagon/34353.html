&gt; Subject: where did J.C.whitney get my address?

&gt;     any ideas as to where whitney gets their mailing lists?  i'd
&gt; really like to know cause anyone that actively researches what kind
&gt; of vehicle i drive and where i live,  and then sells the information
&gt; deserves a serious reaming.
&gt; thanks.

I, too, got the JCW catalog yesterday.  I have not been on
their mailing list for several years and this popped up out
of the blue.  My inclination is to compare the mailing
address label from JCW to mailing addresses for
club/magazine subscriptions because the information has to
come from somewhere.

I find it's a good practice to subscribe with a slight
variation in mailing address for each magazine, so when
something comes in that you didn't expect, you can tell
where the information was sold.

It's as easy as:
James P Bryant
James Bryant
Jim Bryant
J P Bryant
Jim Byrant

And when something comes in to &quot;Byrant&quot; the culprit is
obvious.  But...having the VW-only JCW catalog isn't all
that bad, is it?
