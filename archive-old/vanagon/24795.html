I don't think we've dealt with this one before if so, go ahead
scold me.  The '78 had a couple major MAJOR chips of unknown
age.  To get her inspected I had to have one repaired, as a
used glass was going to run me $50, professional repair bout
here $40, and your average parts store kit $6.99 ($7.99 for
Locktite's but I only found it later) I went this option.  I'd
make a few comments on the process and results.  I had a Clear
Star Kit (claim to be the origional) a sryinge (sp) to apply, 2
with resin and catylist, a base, instructions (Locktite resin is already
mixed I don't know how it cures).  My chip was a big stone impact
causing severe 1&quot; round starburst pattern, the worst case scenario.
I followed the instrustion meticulously, basically these work in
a cool manner, you use the plunger to first draw air out of the
chip, then to inject under pressure, then repeat the vacuum to pull
remaining bubbles out, then pressure for 4 hours.  The process only
takes U 30 mins then you leave it drying 4 more.  Anyway to make the
point, I am quite pleased with the result, the stuff miraculousy
saturates the chip and left only a 1&quot; slightly odd circle with good
color but different refraction properties, hardly noticeable except
for 1 of the 15+ star crack surfaces that must have been too closed to
fill with resin.  Now additionally mine has a bunch of small dirt
particles in it that had worked in so if you need to do this, do
it immediately after you get hit (pro guy said this as well) before
wour wipers smear crap into the area.  Still I give it thumbs up with
an 80% restored visibilty I'd say, and if done earlier would have
been much better.  Now if insurance was paying for a pro repair, I'd
go that way (I've seen very nice results and I always think it's better
to repair than risk windshield damage or leaks)  but for those of us
on a tighter budget, definitely give these a try.  Same quality as
the cheap Whitney version I suppose and great results.  Durability?
Who knows suposed to be everlasting.  I stress for someone getting the
Locktite version (I like their products and would have) they say
something like if needed repeat the suction and pressure steps but
imply you can get away with doing them once.  REPEAT THEM, this is where
it really pulls out the air, I'd even repeat em a 3rd time (one extra
compared to the Clear Star instructions) and results may be perfect.
Anyway one of those things I always wondered about that seems to be
nearly as good as it says IMHO.
