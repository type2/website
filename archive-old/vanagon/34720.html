&gt;Mine sags too (the bus's rear end, not my own personal...), but doesn't
&gt;present any clearance problems. The rear torsion bars are adjustable,
&gt;but it's a pain to do, requires the right tools, and a pretty knowledgeble
&gt;person. Often takes multiple tries, I'm told, to get the height &quot;about 
&gt;right&quot;.

Doing this job right the first time reguires using an adjustable protractor
&quot;bubble&quot; level and some careful measurements before and after.  The early
service manuals have procedures on doing this.  A four wheel alignment should
be done after this work.  All buses appear to have the sag.  Put two adults
in front and see if it's level.  Job is a bear but avoid using lift shocks as
these cause other problems.
