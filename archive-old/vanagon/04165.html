Well, since you're on America Online, I'm not sure what you can tell 
them. &lt;grin&gt;
Wait, I got it.  Just tell them that there's no way they can afford it 
&lt;grin&gt;.

Here's something you can do.
You (Derek) send a message to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with the line 
help 
as the only line.
Save the message you get.
When people ask you how to do the &quot;listserv thing&quot;, send that message to 
them.
