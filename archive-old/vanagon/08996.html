&gt;Locked?  What is locked?  Is the '56 that different from my '61?  The doors
&gt;simply &quot;open&quot; from the inside - the locking of the outer handle has nothing
&gt;to do with the operation of the inner handle.  If someone has already

I didn't think I could get out out if I'd locked it from the inside.
Hmm, I'll have to try that.  Better have someone hadny to rescue me in
case I do the classic &quot;locked my keys in the car.  Took me an hour to
get out!&quot; trick
