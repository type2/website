Subject: JC Whitney orders from Canada?

Any fellow Canadians tried ordering from JC Whitney? I'd like to get 
some interior lights (fluorescent type, like in earlier Westies) to 
go in mine, and I can't seem to find anyone else who sells them.

I was thinking of trying JC Whitney, unless someone can suggest 
another source...

Thx
Shawn.
