&gt;This past weekend, I had the pleasure of visiting a store in Oakland, CA
&gt;called West Coast Marine, which is apparently a chain, as well as a catalog
&gt;operation.  It is huge and has many items that could be used in the
&gt;camping/RV industry.  They had products I'd never encountered before

That's the place I went to when I was in CA over X-mas. Felt the same way
as you: lots of neat stuff at good prices.

This is where I bought the inline fan to boost my heating system ($19,
instead of $70 at JCWhitney).
