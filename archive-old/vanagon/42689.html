I can't imagine that the AT would run with gear oil in it.  What makes you
think it has gear oil in it.  VW has used a couple of colors of ATF,
including one that looks like the color of oil.  It is not necessarily red.

&gt; Secondly, the AC compressor doesn't turn on - there is some freon in  
&gt;the system - is there a pressure switch, 

Yes, there is a low pressure cut-off switch.  If there is not enough pressure
in the system the compressor will not turn on.

&gt;and/or is  it so that this AC set-up is also tied into the ECU? 

No.

&gt;How would one diagnose where the problem lies?

I'd first check the fuses &amp; then take it to a shop and have them check for
freon pressure &amp; leaks.
