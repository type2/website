Subject: RE: pancake vs. up-right


&gt;How would I spot a pancake motor vs. an upright motor if i was looking
&gt;at the crank case broken down and the cylinders lying on
&gt;a table next to it?


I believe the fuel pump mount is different, and possibly generator
mount too. Both mount on top for the upright-fan bug and pre-72 bus
engine, but someplace else on the pancake engine (for a type 3, right?)
I believe that the openings for each of these in a bug engine, don't
exist for an original pancake engine.

These are vague recollections from MANY years ago. Anyone have more
recent experience, and can support/disprove?



&gt;[Anybody know serious problems putting a 1973 1600 from a Bug on my
&gt;1971 bus? I believe it also is dual port.]

I put a '74 bug engine in my '69 bus years ago. The 68-71 busses have
an extra engine mount in back (FIF), which bolts to three bolt holes
around the oil pump. Early bug engines didn't have these three bolt
holes, but many later ones did-- these crankcases are called &quot;universal&quot;
cases, or &quot;busmount&quot; cases.

The '74 engine I put in my bus, had three places for holes, but only
two of them were drilled-- the third was a blank boss of metal. I
didn't have taps and dies, so a quick trip to the machine shop with
the engine in the right seat space of a '64 convertible, the guy
drilled and tapped it right then and there, and it bolted right in.

Check the area around the oil pump in the '73 bug engine. Should be
a hole (or a place for one) on either side, and one below. If it has
them, you're golden!

Good luck!
