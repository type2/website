&gt;Is it possible to install a helicoil in a stripped spark plug hole with

David Schwarze replied:
Yes, it is possible.  It's also possible that while doing this you or your
mechanic might inadvertently allow some metal shavings to fall into the
cylinder.  Instant cylinder-wall scoring and loss of compression.

...I've done this in a bug- after drilling, blow out the cylinder, and then
use a piece of tubing attached to vacuum cleaner to suck up any shavings
(which are a lot softer metal that the cylinder walls/rings). Then use one
of those Sears mini-lites on a stalk about 1/8&quot; wide to shine right down
inside cylinder and eyeball it (or use fancy endoscope if you are a surgeon
or very rich).  This might be harder in a late type 2 where the plug hole
is very deep behind the air shrounding...  The expert who showed me this
claimed remains go out the exhaust.       MB in NJ
