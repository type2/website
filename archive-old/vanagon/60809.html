&gt; Now what do I do?  Is there a procedure for replacing a broken bleeder
&gt; screw?  Is is safe to drive as is?
&gt; Unfortunately, the low pedal pressure remains...
&gt; TIA for any sage advice,

maybe not sage, but its what I did when the same happened to me...

remove caliper and mount in vice. Use an &quot;easy-out&quot; or drill the whole 
bugger out. Flush/clean. Install new nipple.

Its a bear but its the only sure way.
