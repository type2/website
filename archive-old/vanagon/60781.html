Cool!
 
&gt; Problem #1... I like to change ALL fluids in a used van that I buy. It
&gt; gives me a little piece of mind.  Everything is done except the
&gt; transmission and differential.  I found the plugs on the differential
&gt; and the drain plug on the transmission, but I can't find a fill plug.

The fill plug is on the right side of the transmission set in deeply between
a pair or ribs.  Keep looking.

&gt; The differential lockout valve seems to be located in the position one
&gt; would find a fill plug on a manual trans..  Do I have to remove this
&gt; valve to fill it or is it somewhere else?

No need to remove the differential lock actuator.

&gt; Problem #2...  The fuel tank keeps pressurizing on me.  Bently doesn't....

Don't know.  

Good luck,
