Subject: The Corvairs go to Hollywood...


I just now talked to the man with the Corvairs on the phone. He called me,
I did not call him. I made him a low offer for each engine I carried off
and a lower offer for each trans, and said that I might not take all of
them. That there were some cars I wasn't sure I could get a lift to, there
was too much brush. And that I wouldn't haul the cars off for him.

He protested the cars wouldn't be &quot;worth anything&quot; to a &quot;collector&quot; without
engines. I wasn't the only person interested in these cars, you know. Pft!
These are basket cases.

He said he'd get back to me and hung up sounding discouraged. Calling the
crusher to see whether they'll still give him a little if the cars are
stripped, I imagine. We shall see.
