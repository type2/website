&gt;still having problems with water-temp light, but no acceleration problems 
&gt;at all
&gt;car runs same as before the $130 and the $15 for a pressure cap for the 
&gt;coolant tank
&gt;arrrrragh!
&gt;ps- it seems like the car is using too much coolant too......

ARRRRRRAGH is right. Are you getting bubbles in your coolant tank 
while the engine is running? You might have a warped head or a blown 
head gasket. I've been there three times. One time the fan belt broke
and over heated the engine and warped a head. All in the time span of 
about 60 seconds...  I hope your problem isn't in your head :-)

Good luck,
        Paul   87 Syncro
