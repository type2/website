Subject: List explosion!

This is a good (tm) thing, not a bad thing.
Thanks to alert reader, Joel Walker, of Tookalooka, AL, for bringing the 
expansion of the list membership to my attention. As of today, the 
list membership broke 300.  There are actually 302, but only 298 of them 
are active (the other 4 are &quot;postponed&quot;)

Donuts are in order.  Donut gift certificates can be mailed to:

Gerry Skerbitz
1366 Palace Av
St. Paul, MN  55105
&lt;grin&gt;

Thanks to everyone for making this a successful list!
