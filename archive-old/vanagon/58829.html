&lt;&lt;   What kind of gas mileage do you folks get? We're getting 13 to 15
mpg in town and on average 20 mpg on the highway. Our vw mechanic thinks
we should be doing better than this and have more power too.  New (1984)

   I get 15-16 mpg around town: 17-19 on the highway at 65-70 mph,
depending on wind conditions.  When following a long line of splitties,
however,  highway mileage jumps to nearly 23. &lt;G&gt;
