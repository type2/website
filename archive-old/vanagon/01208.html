&gt; &gt; you see, it involves Supply-Side Economics, Ripple-Factor Monetary
&gt; &gt; Distribution, and Fraudulent Check Bouncing.  By driving faster to
&gt; &gt; more than one bank, you can actually withdraw enough money to keep
&gt; &gt; a Water-Cooled VW Bus running.  And running it must remain, in order
&gt; &gt; to stay one step ahead of the High Sheriff and his Process Servers!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Remember that when the going gets real bad, a Vanagon Syncro is the 
&gt; _only_ way to escape to mountains and let the process servers eat 
&gt; your dust.  He he he.
&gt; 

God! I thought that's what the bed and breakfast setup was for, so you
could camp out at all the ATMs  ;)
