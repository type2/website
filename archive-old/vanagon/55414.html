&gt;Just saw that, 
&gt;
&gt;I recommend life in prison for that stunt!

I don't think that'll be necessary.
The driver of the stolen Army tank got stuck on the median on a freeway, right
before he tried to drive the thing head-first into oncoming traffic, and while
trying to maneuver the tank free, cops climbed up onto the tank, pried open the
hatch, and fired one round from above which went straight thru his neck down to
his heart killing him.

I guess he was prepared to die anyway, after a rampage like that.
It was unbeleiveable that nobody else got killed, though there would have been
many innocent people killed if he had made it over the median into the oncoming
traffic...

oh, well. One less psycho in the world....
