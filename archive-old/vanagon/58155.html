Subject: Re: Sticking sliding door

I've been having occasional sticking side door. I just noticed
that the inside panel is 'loose' and catches on the the rear
lip or edge of the car, causing the 'catching' sometimes.
Figure I'll figure a way to re-fasten the rear edge of the
inside panel (the fabric panel) and stop that sticking.
