Subject: VW magazines

I am planning on subscribing to one of the various VW magazines available
and I was wondering which one was &quot;best&quot;.  Actually the only two I've seen
are Hot VW's and VW Trends.  Are there others?  I would like one that has
articles that pertain to my '77 Westy.  Thanks for your thoughts on the
subject.
Brett
