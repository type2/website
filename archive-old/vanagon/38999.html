I have been in the planning stages of a similar engine buildup for
my buggy, using a type IV engine.  Plan on spending BIG BUCKS on
performance parts for the type IV.  Unless you stuck with the
stock sizes of pistons and cylinder, expect to pay $300 or more
for big bore pistons and cylinders.  Cranks can go from $200 on
up past $800.(I'd expect the $200 ones aren't a real high quality.)
The heads are about the same, maybe a little higher for big valves
(not sure about porting).  Cams are about twice as much and rods
(besides stock) are pretty high dollar.
You will then have to convert the type IV to upright, either using
custom shrouding (more high dollars) or convert stock parts and
type one parts, (like the Next Generation Book shows) which is
the way I will go.  

Depending on the engine, and cost of the engine, maybe take a
1800cc or 2000cc type IV, leave it stock other than convert to
upright.  That might be the best way to go for the both of us.
Anyway, just my opnion, hope it gives you something to think
about.
See ya
