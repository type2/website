Subject: Re: Buying the VW Shop: The Fantasy


&gt;The Carolinas at $60K, or Tennessee for $150K?

For Pete's sake. Nobody who has ever seen both Memphis and the Carolina
coast would regard this as a dilemma. ;) Memphis is an armpit.

I have this nagging suspicion that Ric is one of the Parties Involved? In
any case rumors of the shop on the island make me wish very hard that I
were a competent mechanic...
