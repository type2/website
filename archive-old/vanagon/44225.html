Thanks to all the comments and suggestions on anchoring my VW emblem to the
front of my bus. Here is how I ended up doing it:

I went to Ace Hardware and got 4 blue plastic #8 wall anchors. They fit
perfectly into the holes on the front end. The emblem posts fit the anchors
like a glove, and the anchors expanded into the hole. I couldn't get it off
if I wanted to now.
 (the emblem that is) :-)
