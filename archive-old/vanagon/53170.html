Subject: head cap nuts- 'torque to hold'
Date: Mon, 16 Dec 96 12:12:52 -0600

or Torque Toehold, the infamous World Wresting Champion...

but onto your nuts.

as these 'head cap nuts' are torqued, greased with a slather of *yellow*
sealant from VW (they make a special sealant just for these nuts), one will
notice that it *is* difficult to reach a consistent final torque.  this is
due to the stretch of the long studs, the compression of the gaskets, and
the springy rotational resiliency of the stud itself.  it all means one
word:  patience.

when torquing these nuts, they should be brought up to final spec in stages,
working evenly around the head in the pattern set forth in Bentley.  as the
final torque is reached, it must be held until the nut stops turning.  this
takes time.  alot of time.  typically, a specification will be given for a
'torque-to-hold' time of say 30 seconds.  Bentley does not offer such
wisdom.  in my (very) limited experience, it takes 'as long as needed' to
have the nut stop turning.  obviously, this is necessitating a beam-type
torque wrench vs. the click type.  get comfortable, brace your arms, and
plan on holding the final torque spec a while.  you'll definately feel it
stop. breathe.  go on to the next one.  those of you predisposed to worry,
will feel the the stud may snap, strip, or break.

it may  ;-&gt;
