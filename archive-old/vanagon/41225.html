Subject: Re: news group, ENOUGH!

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no polling, there is no discussion.  It's Gerry's mailing list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;If someone wants to make a Newsgroup, then do it.


There is a news group, rec.autos.vw.watercooled, use it if you wish.  I 
dislike newsgroups because I end up having to scan 800+ messages to get the 
new stuff on the list, and my mailer doesn't delete newsgroup listings I 
haven't opened.  Maybe there's a tweak.  I'm also on a Porsche list and 
Biomechanics list, both in digest mode, both with 1200+ members, not a mere 
700. This is an option newsgroup hungry folks may persue, kinda like getting 
a fresh newsgroup list everyday. In the meantime, &quot;Gerry is my listmeister, 
I shall not wont...&quot;  and I wish this discusion would stop generating 
messages, it's dead, the list lives. As does the strong sense of community 
this list embodies, unlike rec.vw.....
