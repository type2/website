Subject: Re: I've go to sell the syncro

Where are you located?

&gt;Hi folks-
&gt;
&gt;It's a sad time for me.  My wife and I are looking to buy a house and the
&gt;first thing that needs to go is my syncro.  (cash will help with the down
&gt;payment).  Anyway it's a 87'.  Here is a brief history....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Bought new 1993 with approximately 45,000 miles
&gt;
&gt;Since then I have taken excellent care of it.  ie oil changes every 3000
&gt;miles, drained and replaced blue goo coolant every year.  Replaced just about
&gt;all sensors.  Had it tuned and maintained by VW.  With some hesitation.
&gt;
&gt;Heads were replaced by VW at approximately 55,000 miles, no leaks etc.
&gt;New muffler and cat.
&gt;New rotors
&gt;New tires
&gt;Has a few small dents other than that exterior real good
&gt;Interior excellent, no stains etc.
&gt;Current mileage 70,000
&gt;Diff lock not working
&gt;
&gt;What should i be asking for it??
&gt;I paid approximately $8,000 for it.
&gt;Your help would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;ps.  once we have the house I've already warned my wife that i will be
&gt;looking for another one!!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks 
&gt;Mike
