Subject: change list to newsgroup?

The first day I joined the list, I was swamped by the e-mails.  Since
I receive my e-mail at work, and I get a lot of work related e-mail.

Someone suggested I put it on DIGEST mode.  This means that once a day
I get one big e-mail with all of the e-mails that people have sent.
I spend about 15 minutes going through it and then delete it.  No problem.

I REALLY don't like the idea of a newsgroup

Kedar
