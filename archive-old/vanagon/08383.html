Subject: Re: vanagon oil warning system


At the risk of digressing, I have a quick story of an '85 Golf.  It's oil 
pressure light flashed and the engine made a horrible clattering noise. 
The oil change guy (a specialist, no doubt) put 10W30 in the crankcase.  
This was in the summertime (avg temps 90F); at any rate the replacement 
of this oil with 20w50 fixed the problem immeditately...

Back to our regularly scheduled vanz........

&gt; This warning system (although hearing it referred to as a &quot;cold&quot; warning 
&gt; system is news to me) is the same as on my '85 VW Jetta.  I had problems 
&gt; with the system after of all things, washing the engine.  Apparently I 
&gt; was not allowing the engine to cool down enough before rinsing the 
&gt; engine cleaner off and the cold water was frying the oil pressure switch 
&gt; that was mounted on the oil filter flange (Jetta, remember).
&gt; 
&gt; After wasing the engine, and tooling down the road, the buzzer would go 
&gt; off and, looking in the engine compartment, I'd find a steady stream of 
&gt; oil running from the oil pressure switch.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, this system does not seem to have so much to do with cold oil as 
&gt; it measures an unusual difference of pressure between two oil pressure 
&gt; switches.  In the Jetta, it measured the difference between the switch 
&gt; at the oil filter and the switch on the cylinder head.  The system only 
&gt; activates itself above a certain RPM (2,000 to the best of my 
&gt; recollection).
&gt; 
&gt; It was also my understanding that in the earlier model years, the 
&gt; circuit boards that are mounted behind the speedometer were rather 
&gt; buggy.  I ended up replacing one of them after it decided to start going 
&gt; off for no reason and it never gave me another problem.
&gt; 
&gt; On my 92 Passat, occasionally this system will sound for a split second 
&gt; when starting the car, I don't know whether this is an occasional test 
&gt; or a bug in the system--it's never gone off when I've been driving the 
&gt; car.
&gt; 
&gt; The are diagnostics in the Bentley manual for the Jetta and the Passat, 
&gt; and I think in the Vanagon manual, I haven't read that far yet, but I 
&gt; think I saw the subject headline in the contents list. --
