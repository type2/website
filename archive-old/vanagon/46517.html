&gt; 
&gt; vanagon drivers over a certain age will always wave,
&gt; under will not.
&gt; 
&gt; My theory is that old vgon drivers used to have buses, are are fondly
&gt; remembering them (at the same time they are blessing their functioning
&gt; heating systems).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else notice this?

	Hi Mark... (Waving enthusiastically...)

	One of the &quot;over a certain age&quot; Vanagoneers who waves at ALL 
VWs...

	there are a 1/2 dozen folks where I live who own Wasserboxers 
and we All wave to each other ( one womans' little ones 3-4 year-olds 
get all excited when they see my Van, usually 'cause my Beagle Pup is 
doing a &quot;Snoopy Vulture&quot; with his nose in the Defroster vent...)
