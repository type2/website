Listees,

  I still have the 86 and up air flow meters for sale at $100.00 Each
Plus S&amp;H.

  If any of you plan to keep your Vanagons for a LONG TIME, You'll be
needing one of these sooner or later.  These will last on the shelf for
a Long Time.

  I also have SYncro Parts For Sale,

  New Front Axles, $250.00 Each

  I also Parted out a Syncro recently.  I have the Trans and Viscus
Coupler.  If there's anything you might need let me know and I'll see if
it's on the van?
