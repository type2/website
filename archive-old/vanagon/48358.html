The dash pod on my '80 had a couple of broken mount points.  I 
removed &amp; replaced that pod zillions of times due to speedo problems. 
 Most of the pods I saw at wreckers has at least one broken attach 
point, seems pretty prevalent.  Another interesting point is that the 
material for the flexible wiring changed from a yellow base to a blue 
base at some point, the blue is MUCH more flexible.
