Subject: pushrod tube fix

Hi Mike,


read the oil leak note, take it easy there.  To replace pushrod tubes the
heads need to come off.  I'd bet you'll also need a new head gasket, $30,
and if the heads are going south maybe a head/2. To get the heads off you
need to take off the exhaust pipes, which may lead to stripped
headbolts/broken pipes if old. Sorry to paint such a picture, but slight
problems could easily triple your bill, and once underway you are committed.
There is no adjustment of the hydraulic valve lifters BTW (hasn't been since
1978).  I hope this mechanic is experienced in wasserboxers???

If the oil leak is a real pain and endangers engine life you might consider
the following.  Take of the rock covers to get a good look at the tubes.
Degrease them thoroughly with GUNK etc and a tooth brush then figure out
which one(s) leak and where.  If leakage is from the (rusted) accordian
pleats you are pretty much beat. 

If it is around ends, past the seals, you MAY be able to 'lengthen' the
tubes by carefully pushing a knife blade in between the pleats and wiggling.
This will push a bit harder against the seals.  Do a small bit at each
pleat, not all in one.  If the tubes are rusted they may tear/crack!  Also,
if the heads are well degreased you can goop around the tube and seal it
onto the head/block.  This is not ideal, but may stem the flow somewhat. The
goop will pull off eventually due to expansion of block etc.

  Having said all that, if you only have one or two dead tubes you can buy
split tubes, ~$30/, which are easily installed....  remove valve cover,
remove two bolts holding entire rocker arm/shafts assembly and pull out the
pushrod in the leaking tube. Rip out the tube, clean up seats and install
new seals then the split tube.  Then reassemble rockers checking that NO
BINDING has occurred.  Do this in your drive, takes an hour or so. Jack the
van slightly on the side you are working on to tip the oil back into the
block. No need to crack the heads/exhaust off, or 'adjust' the valves. No
incidental damage likely either. 

Bye, Tim
