&gt; An &quot;old&quot; VW mechanic told me last week that when he worked for VW they came
&gt; up with an easy way to fill a Vanagon with coolant.  He said that he would
&gt; drill a 1/4 in. hole through the edge of the thermostat.  Once that was
&gt; done the bus would purge itself of air just by driving. Has anyone ever
&gt; heard of this?  I just don't see how it would work, but he swore that it
&gt; worked.
