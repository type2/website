Subject: Nasty window rubber fake chrome trim inserts (phew!!:&lt;)

Well, I've done it now... :&lt;)

I noticed the little aluminum spacer thingie on the window rubber trim insert
was falling off on my Vanagon's LR window. Well, I tried to press it back on,
but the nasty brown, faded shriveled up sorry excuse for fake chrome plastic
trim had shrunk - and there was no trim there for the spacer to grab onto.
(Ya know, the early Baywindows did have REAL aluminum trim....VW had to cut
costs somewhere... :&lt;)

So.... I got to thinkin' .... this trim strip sure does look ugly ( I had
contemplated painting the strips flat black in the past) ....Hmmm... I wonder
if..... So I got a little screwdriver....hmmm... I wonder how easy this comes
out...maybe I'll just try to pry it out a little bit and see what's
underneath........

The next thing I realize that I've pulled all the trim strips out of every
window rubber, windshield and all..... 

so anyway, now that I've reduced what was left of my faded out window trim
inserts to a pile of cracked up little plastic bits laying on the driveway,

Are my windows gonna leak now??  (they still seem to be a pretty tight seal)
anybody else done this before and wished they hadn't?

I guess I'll find out in the next downpour.....  :&lt;)
