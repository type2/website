 I just used to crawl under the bus and wire them open in the winter and 
leave them shut in the summer.  You can still regulate the heat with the 
vent wing windows in the door.  I spent about $15 bucks and put some 
cheap choke cables in the floor to work the heat but they rust and pull 
loose eventually.  Hope this helps.
