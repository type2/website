Subject: Hi ya!

Damn it's hot! Had to take a break. Just did an oil change on my daily
driver, a '93 Geo Metro. I feel like I just ran a marathon. Whew! Boy,
it's gonna be fun putting the engine in the 'Westy tommorow. Well,
gotta go finish up. Need to clean up all 3 plugs in the Metro. I
wish I still had my Bugs though. Used to have a beige '68 autostick,
and a robin's egg blue '66. One rotted apart, and some moron rear
ended the '66 2 weeks after I got it. Oh well. I have fond winter memories
of driving with one hand and scraping the inside of the windshield with
the other. Talk to you later.
Lisa
