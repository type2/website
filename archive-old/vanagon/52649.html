Subject: 2nd Annual Mid-Atlantic Holiday Fest

Yes, folks, its on: 60 Walnut Ave., Takoma Park MD, Sunday December
15th, 1-4pm ! 

As last year, we welcome all listmembers as well as their families, SOs,
etc. This is a social, not technical event, though we certainly will
do show 'n tell on Propex installation, visit my '64 Standard waiting
patiently in a garage a couple of blocks away, and of course check out
*your* bus as well. 

If you know you are coming, drop me a line, but do not feel you
must RSVP if you decide to show up at the last minute. Of course, 
we will welcome any food/beverage contributions.

Busses are coming from far and wide, and guest accomodations at our
place are nearing capacity (limiting factor: one bathroom), but at least
one other DC area listmember has generously offered to find more space
if necessary - email me directly. 

Directions:
&gt;From DC Beltway (I-495), south on New Hampshire Ave (Exit 28)
about 4.5 miles (McDonalds on left), right onto Eastern Ave
to first stop sign (Kansas Ave), continue straight and make
the first right (where the Jersey barrier ends) onto Walnut Ave.
#60 is a light blue house about halfway down the block on your left.
If you come to a second stop sign on Eastern, you missed it, but make
three rights and you'll be back on Walnut Ave. (301) 270-8073 for
emergency assistance.

See you there!

Tom F.
