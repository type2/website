 Continues to flash while running. Checked 14 point connector at panel,
tightened 
 nuts on gauge, replaced both sensors on thermo housing and sensor in bottle.

 Coolant level (Sierra) full. However, that side of panel is goofy, fuel
gauge 
 wanders and clock has stopped. Related? Becoming discouraged.  
  &gt;&gt;
Is the container actually full while the light is on or is the coolant
getting pushed out of the bottle while the ngine is running and then
refilling the bottle when you turn it off?  If this is the case, either the
system is not bleed properly or you have problems!
