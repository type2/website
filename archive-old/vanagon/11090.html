Subject: CV joints in an '85 Vanagon


	Earlier today I just did my first CV work ever. (woohoo!)
Minor problem:  One of the cap screws on the outer joint has no head on 
it.  This would probably explain the noises coming from that part of the 
car, making me suspect the CV.  Hopefully I can get it with some 
vise-grips this weekend.  In the meantime...while I clean and pack, does 
anyone have any advice.  I've got Muir and Bentley, and everything seems 
relatively simple.  Will I have a problem installing the shaft in that 
trailing arm by the outer joint?  It wasn't so tough getting it out, but 
it looks like installing it back in there, and tightening everything up 
will be tricky and tight.  Also...Muir mentions nothing about the 
orientation of the axle shaft.  Will anything happen if the axle shaft is 
installed backwards (outer becomes inner)?  
	Thanks for any help.
