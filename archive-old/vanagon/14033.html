Subject: Re: Why me?

I'm very sorry to hear what happened to your engine.

&gt;problem is the motor has no crossmember holes.  I know I heard some people 
&gt;talking about some adapter or some such thing, has anyone ever really used 
&gt;one of these things for a long period of time?   
&gt;
Those things look pretty cheesy to me.  The whole motor hangs from the oil
pump cover studs.  And those studs are tiny!
