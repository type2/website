&gt; I'd been planning the new tires for the parents '77 for a couple of
&gt; weeks now, old ones were OK, simply not reinforced.  So it was all
&gt; leaning toward the Conti's from Tire Rack at $55 each when I happened to
&gt; stop at Sears to order a couple of new Reinforced XZX's for the rear of
&gt; my '78 for $65 each (best price going as far as I can tell).  The guy
&gt; mentions he has 11 of these LT195/75R14 Trailhandler A-T tires in stock
...
&gt; before I left.  OHH but the result.  On the way home I was amazed as
&gt; ever, like I said it had be shod with unreinforced Michelins, really
&gt; bad in the wind wandered like hell, steering very heavy.  These tires
&gt; transformed the Bus, steering light and responsive (as much as it could
&gt; be) no sway, no buffeting by semis, rock solid.  

I did not get a reduction in my swaying, buffeting, blowing or wandering
after putting Trailhandlers on my '89 Westy. I'll recheck the pressure
though, since it could be off a tad.

However, I tend to take the beast out into some very evil conditions,
since the Jetta doesn't exactly camp well. ;)
