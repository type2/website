Subject: 1986 Vanagon Synchro

Hi everyone,

I recently looked at a 1986 Vanagon Synchro GL for sale in the 
midwest.  It had about 96,000 miles on it.  It had a fast idle 
problem the day I looked at and so the owner was working on it.  
I didn't get to drive it then.  He has corrected this problem and got 
the vehicle to pass the state emission testing.  The vehicle is rust 
free, apparently it is from Alabama and the interior is in perfect 
condition.  The left rear side has some body damage from a PO 
sideswiping the door frame of their garage.  It has air 
conditioning which has been disconnected because it stopped 
working.  The current owner is asking $3300 for it.  Does this 
sound like a good price and what are the potential problems that 
a 96K synchro might be ready for? Any thoughts or advice would 
be greatly appreciated.
