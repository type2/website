Subject: Re: Busses To Drown Vanagons?

Derek: maybe we should encourage only those who have vanabusses to join.
This would satisfy both groups because of the considerable overlap of parts...
yeah, and  maybe the people on the West coast can drive half way across
the continent meet up with the Easterners and swap vehicles. Those with busses
could trade with the vanagon people for six months of the year. In this way
each of us
would learn to appreciate the problems that others are experiencing., yeah
and maybe I could swap my air-cooled engine  for your wasserboxer?

 Hey as long as there is at least one person on the list who can answer my
dumb questions, I'm satisfied. DC
