Steve Wall:  Great!  You're on for bouillibase!  I've duly noted
you on the list of contributors as bringing :
BIG pot, tomatoes, onions, herbs, etc.  

Wrote you privately earlier to bring seafood per person, but considering
what you've offered here, nix that, and bring the herbs, onions, tomatoes
instead, ok?  I put you in charge!  This will be great, especially as I
love this dish.  Don't forget at least a LITTLE garlic, ok?  I mean, it
should be ok if we ALL have it, right?  :)
