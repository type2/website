&gt; that he understands that the first owner owned a VW dealership and

Sounds like a Wolfsburg to me.  Mine ('85 Wolfsburg) has the two battery
set up to help power the readily removable fridge.  The Dometic
Refriderator t6hat is in my Vanagon had two handles to facilitate
removable and a 12 volt plug that plugs into the jack under the passenger
seat.  Perhaps the PPO kept the fridge for personal use?
