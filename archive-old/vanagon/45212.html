Subject: Re: Solenoid relay


&gt;And for wiring, I believe the bosch relays have numeric codes imprinted next
&gt;to each terminal.  I think 30 would be from the battery and 15 would be out
&gt;to the solenoid, but I'm not sure what the numeric designation of the
&gt;&quot;trigger&quot; would be.  Hey, I paint by numbers, why can't I wire by numbers?!
&gt;ZZZzzzap.


My relay had a schematic on the side. 85 &amp; 86 are the 'trigger' (what is
the proper term??), 30 is from the battery, and 87 is power out (to the
solenoid in this case.
Ken (is that insulation burning?)
