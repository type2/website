Subject: Sounds of dying Vanagon?

Hey there Listees-

I'm afraid my 83 waterboxer is in terrible shape. I am planning on taking it
in ASAP but would like as much info as I can get before I go have it looked
at.  

Here's the scoop- I just put on a new cat, o2 sensor, muffler, bosch plat
plugs, dist. cap, changed the coolant and flushed with water, changed
oil&amp;filter, airfilter, checked the timing, recarpeted the interior (not
related but am very proud of my $25 carpeting job!).  I was having some
nagging valve noise so used some hyd. lifter cleaner in crankcase on advise
from this list.  

After loading up the van (rather heavy), I was driving up I-80 towards donner
summit (in CA) and the van was running great, lots of speed until somewhere
past Auburn where I was getting into some consistant uphill (5000++ft) and
the van lost a lot of power and let loose with a sound similiar to what it
sounded like when the cat and muffler broke off a couple of weeks previous.
 Sh*t, I thought I had really flubbed up and one of the manifolds had come
loose, however on inspection they were all tight.  I finished the drive over
the 8000 ft summit with the (spine chilling) sound occuring off and on.  It
seems to kick in when the engine has to push extra hard up a hill, it's fine
on flat or gradual/short hills.  I suspect it has something to do with one or
more of my exhaust valves.

The lifter cleaner was still in the crank case (it had only been about 4
days) and have since changed the oil and filter.  I have driven it once
since, still loaded and up some smaller hills, about 30 miles total and no
big sounds.  However, it still makes light valve noise (I think) all the time
and idles really rough and uneven.  When I take the van to a shop, it is
going to be Sacramento or even farther away.  It is going to take a lot of
days and driving.  I would like to get it all done at the same time before
more snow falls and I get too much into work.  So if you have any advice
please let me know!  Thanks in advance.
