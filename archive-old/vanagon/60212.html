&gt; My question is if you can replace the trim without taking the window out?

if you are referring to the windshield, then the answer is no. the trim 
is &quot;T&quot; shaped in x-section and the leg of the &quot;T&quot; which is the part that 
goes into the rubber is barbed. its not like the other kinda windw trim 
which can be inserted while the glass is in place by means of a &quot;spread 
and insert&quot; gizmo.
