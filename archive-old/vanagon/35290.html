(Background:  Van won't start)

I presume a few things in my answer:  the battery terminals are clean, 
the ground straps (2 of 'em) are in &quot;good&quot; shape, along with the positive 
cable, and that the battery is not too old or has one-too-many complete 
discharges under its proverbial belt.  

Now I go into uncharted waters (nope, I haven't done this yet):  Do you 
have a hygrometer?  Then you can test the individual cells.  Maybe one 
went bad.  

Your local battery shop should be able to do a load test on 
it (for free) and then determine its condition.  

Good luck!  Hope your bus gets back on the road soon.
