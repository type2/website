Subject: Re: Busses &amp; Baby Grand Pianos

&gt;The piano, carefully disassembled, made it fine.  My lower
&gt;back is ruined, (there's nowhere to stand if you're inside,
&gt;on the receiving end!  Nowhere!)

This is the true beauty of a double-double-door Panel - you're never
trapped - just back out the other side...

Rumor had it that the Eurovan was going double-sided on cargo doors in '96...
