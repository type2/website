Subject: Re: MORE 'you MAY be a devoted VW bus owner if:'

-You have to think of which VW is running that day before you drive to work.
-In social situations people avoid you because they *assume* that all you
are going to talk about is VWs. =)
-People you dont even know recognize you because of all of the VW events
that you have attended and or swapped at.
-All of the FLAPS employees recognise your voice over the phone and know
your name/club discount card number(s) without you providing the info.
-You and or your SO have a laundry &quot;grease load&quot;
-When spotting abandoned/carport derilect VWs you have ceased to figure out
&quot;what year&quot; and have skipped directly to the &quot;how much&quot; question.
