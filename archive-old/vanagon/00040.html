&gt; ]Also, does the metal
&gt; ]lever next to the valve alter the flow of coolant?  If so which position
&gt; ]is open and which is closed?  If that is not it's function then what the 
&gt; ]hell does it do?
&gt; 

According to the owner's manual in my '87, it's for regulating the amount
of coolant that flows thru the core.  Moving the lever forward opens the
valve.  Moving the lever to the rear of the van closes it.  My owner's 
manual suggests moving the lever back during the summer to help increase
airflow through the interior.
