Well, I did mention several times that I would keep you all posted.  
Here goes:  I haven't had much luck getting out to the garage except 
on the weekends for the last couple of weeks.  As a result, progress 
has been slow.  The learning curve is way up there right now.  Or is 
it the ignorance curve?

Last night I was down to installing the generator in the fan housing. 
I got that done.  The pulley cracked when I was removing the fan bolt 
so I had to install my new (used) one.  I bought a generic woodruff 
key at the hardware store that needed a little filing to get the 
height down.  I was so happy with my success at getting that to fit 
that I proceeded to put that thing on and draw it down with the bolt. 
Nice and tight.  I was quite chuffed.  Wait, something looks a little 
funny.  Doh!  Backwards!  So, today I am off to the store for a 
puller.  One came with the bus but it doesn't fit.  I guess it was for
something else.  Sometimes I wonder if I don't do things so I have an 
excuse to buy an new tool.

So, if that doesn't give me too much trouble I should be running 
sometime in the next six to eight weeks. :)  I have to install the fan 
housing and tweak that intake manifold.  It has a little support thing
that is less than perfect, very close, but not perfect.  I have to 
bolt on the muffler too.  The engine compartment is all pretty.  My 
new battery tray is looking good and the battery is straped in there. 
I also installed new wiring all both ends of the battery and a new 
rear trans seal.  Oh, new engine seals all the way around.  I am 
hoping the carb doesn't give me too much trouble.  I have the Weber 
progressive with the choke on the front.  I have some heavy duty rubber
stuff and am going to use a piece of that on the fan housing to keep 
things from grounding out there.  I have also been told that I might 
have to move the throttle cable hole up for a better movement of that.
One of the adjustment screws in this carb sits on the front (FIF) of 
the carb.  I can reach it but it does take some energy to get it to 
turn.  I wonder if there is a wingnut type of thing I could afix to 
this screw to make things easier.  Anyone?  Also, the air cleaner is a
rectangular deal about 3&quot;x6&quot; (I haven't really measured it).  The guy 
at the flaps wants about $20 for one of these.  Any other ideas?  

There you go.  I am getting very good now at dealing with the 
disappointments that can come from a project like this.  My respect 
for all of you grows even more each day.  The thought of leaning out 
over that steering wheel again and watching the world go by keeps me 
going.  Hopefully I can get in a little fall camping before the snow 
starts piling up.  Later, Jim
