Yeah, I was in Brussels for about two weeks this July (NATO research)
and saw plenty of pasenger vans that were not VW's. The most common
were the Renault l'Espace and the many Japanese varieties (with the
odd Chrysler van thrown in). Granted the Peugeots, Citroens and Mercedes were 
mostly non-passenger but that is probably because they are so ugly
(utilitarian) that they would not sell well as passenger vehicles. By the
far the most popular van is the Eurovan style VW. I also saw a much
larger VW van that was quite interesting and much bulkier...any know
of it?

I did see the odd older Vanagon (all water cooled) but none have the
add-ons common to the  NA market and none had square headlights. 
I also saw plenty of Deux Chevaux which if there were no VW's in the
world would be the topic of this newsgroup no doubt.
