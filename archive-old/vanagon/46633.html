Subject: general parts questions

        As I will be leaving on my 2 week trek shortly and have started
gathering things I'll hopefully not need to use but will bring anyhow, I
need some clarification on whats what. You may tell by what Im about to ask
that I dont have a very extensive mechanical knowledge but damn am I ever
willing to suck it all up and become the human learning sponge.
        `So then...it was suggested, and other poeple take them in their
'travel supply kits' from what Ive read around here , to bring some extra
'points', and 'rotors' when I hit the road. I have NO IDEA what these are,
so could someone enlighten me a bit?
        My Bentley should be here on monday so hopefully it'll clarify alot
of my curiosities, but till then any help would be appreciated.

TIA
