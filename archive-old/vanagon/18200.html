- Whenever I get in the bus to go to work or come home (I'm a 9-to-5-er,
+/- an hour), I turn the key and the engine starts, runs for a second, and 
dies.  If I try again immediately then the starter just spins the engine but
it doesn't even try to start.  Waiting for about a minute or so allows me to 
repeat the cycle (the engine tries to start).  IF however I immediately
and aggressively rev the engine to around 3k rpm or so when I first try to
start it, then I can usually keep it going on the first try. 

   Is the starter healthy? what kind of carburetor do you have on it?
   is there a butterfly type valve that could stick in the carb? (shot
   in dark, but it solved a problem I had once upon a time in my Type 1)
