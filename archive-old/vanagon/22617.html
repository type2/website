&gt; some corrosion off, since they'd been exposed to the elements.  I forgot,
&gt; and left them in ALL week!  Now I have nothing.
&gt; 
&gt;         I Guess the VW gods can take it away just as fast as they give it
&gt; to you.  Must be because I've had impure thoughts of other busses!
&gt; 
&gt;         You can find me dangling from the ol' oak tree round back...

   How about holding your head in the acid bath for a week instead?  ;)
