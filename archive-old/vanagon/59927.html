Hello all,
We are kind of late in deciding this, so we need some help. Where can we 
go on Mem. Wknd to camp in the WV, Virginia, Tn, NC, KY area (mountain 
regions)? I know there are listmembers who have camped in the area and 
might be able to give 1st hand recommendations. We want someplace we can 
hike or bike (road bikes), but not on the Bl Ridge (we are doing that 
later this summer).  We wanted to go to the smokies, but hear that it is 
a zoo on holiday wknds. is this true?  We don't need hook ups (though it 
would be nice if it's chilly), but we do like hot showers (don't have our 
sunshowers yet).  We also would feel better if we could make 
reservations, we don't want to drive 6 hrs to a 1st come place, cause 
there probably won't be anything left.  
Thanks
Lee and Gretchen
