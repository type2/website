Subject: Bus covered with hemp...


&gt;If you were to drive a hemp graphic ladden VW around here I dont
&gt;think anyone would really care, and you would not have to fear getting
&gt;checked out by the cops all the time.

Well, I think you ought to include license plates along with the artwork.
Registered in the land of Hohna Lee. The 12th province?

And in order to pass inspection your emissions would have to be very high...
