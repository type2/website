The front similar to the Vanagon and Volvo Diesel must almost be a VW LT 4x4.

Little chance that it is a Steyr-Puch-Noriker a prototype based on the VW LT 
with axles deriving from the Pinzgauer.

BTW: ThVolvo six-diesel: It is the other way round Volvo used to buy Diesel 
engines from VW (2,5l six-Turbodiesel) and still do buy Diesels from AUDI 2,5 
(five-TDI)
