&gt; Just got off the phone from VWoA to check on an order for a copy of the 
&gt; Jerry Garcia bus ad poster...They ran out and had to order another 
&gt; printing, which they expect to receive in two to three more weeks.  I 
&gt; know some folks out there have been waiting, so I thought I would pass 
&gt; that along.  If you haven't ordered your's yet (and you want one) the 
&gt; number to call is 1-800-444-8987.

I got mine a while ago, and it was a big disappointment.  It was
basically an 8.5x11 printout of the logo on the web page.  I could have
made a duplicate one with one of those HP color inkjet printers (not
that there was much color in it).  Still, it's pinned up in my garage.  :)
