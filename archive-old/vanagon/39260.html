Subject: Re: 87 syncro: Dead #2 cylinder. Injector?

&gt;
&gt;Recently, I started having injector problems with #2 cylinder (when looking 
&gt;in the engine compartment the one closest on the right).  The cylinder does 
&gt;not fire.  I'll start up, and drive--the vehicle will vibrate very much and 
&gt;no power.  Stop, pull #2 cylinder plug wire from distributor, no difference 
&gt;in engine.  Pull any other wire and engine gets noticebly rougher.  Put wire 
&gt;close to distributor and hear/see good spark and still no difference for #2. 
&gt; Last month I put in new platinums.  Have swaped plugs on #2 with no change. 
&gt; Compression is good in all cylinders.
&gt;
Could this be just a bad plug wire or dist. cap?
