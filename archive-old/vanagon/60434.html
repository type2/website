I have one on my 86 GL that works great as a baby seat, or spins around to
share the swing-out table.  (I did see a double wide one, but it seems one
would have a hard time with the fridge door.)  Neat option ordered by the PO.

P.S. the bottom of the seat is a strong box for storing valuables.  Very
handy.
