Jeff,
I don't know if this will work for you ,but here goes...I have an `82
Diesel Westy. I've been using it in Baja Calif since `88 for months at a
time. What I did is to re-do the battery compartment to accommodate a group
27 (120 Amp Hr) deep cycle RV/Marine battery. As it stands, I can be on the
hook, so to speak, for over a week without starting the van to charge it.
That's using lights, radio (occasionally), small fan. I don't know if
there's even room in a gas Westy, you'd have to look. Works for me...

&gt;Hello-
&gt;
&gt;I've been to Vanagon_dot_com and read the info on adding an extra battery to my
&gt;83.5 Westfalia. Thanks for that. But I have a few questions.
&gt;
&gt;My auto electric guy was a little leary about adding a battery. He said the
&gt;alternator's life would be dramatically shortened by having to charge an
&gt;additional battery. Especially if that battery is often completely
&gt;discharged. He also said the deep cycle wheel chair batteries were way
&gt;expensive and heavy and I should go with a boat battery.
&gt;
&gt;Electricity isn't my strong suit. So I only know the basics myself. Is this
&gt;alternator concern warrented? And does a wheel chair battery have advantages
&gt;over a boat battery?
&gt;
&gt;Also I glanced at wheelchair batteries at Sears which seemed to be about $60
&gt;ot $70. That doesn't seem so pricey to me. Are these my best bet? Or does
&gt;anyone have good experiences with another brand to recommend?
&gt;
&gt;Oh I should mention. My electric guy said I should have a separate battery to
&gt;camp then put it on a trickle charge when I get home. This seems a little
&gt;excessive. And what if I never come home?
&gt;
&gt;TIA
