Subject: Re: List Vultures/Parts Dealers and the List

I'm upset with the statements made by Mr Smith!

  I can't understand why a person would make such statements!  The part of it that troubles me 
the most is that Ron was the person involed.

  Ron Salmon is a very trusting and reasonable person.  He has been there for many other people 
in time of need, What has Mr. Smith contributed that shows to us all.

  Ron seems to bend over backwards for aqnybody he can help.  If someone has a problem with 
someone else maybe they should get the facts straight before making a &quot;Complete ASS&quot; out of 
themselves.  Or atleast e-mail the person directly,insyead of posting (Ranting) to the list.

  How long has Mr.Smith been around and what has he done to help other list members??

  I'm sorry but this struck a nerve with me due to the fact that I to am a person that would bend 
over backwards to help out anyone in need!  I have a huge resource of VW parts and Knowledge.  
Should I keep that to myself Mr.Smith?  

  I'm sorry that some people may think that people are being Vultures, but that's not the case!

  If anyone has any problems with me they may find it in their best interest to e-mail me 
personally!
