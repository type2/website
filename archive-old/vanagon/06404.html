Subject: REAL owner's manuals

I recently got a hold of a 55-ish bus owner's manual, as well as a 66 bug
manual. These books are GREAT! they tell in detail how to tear down and rebuild
your carb, how to trouble-shoot brakes, distributor, and a whole bunch of
really useful stuff. With this book alone, you could do most of your repairs,
short of a major overhaul. In contrast, newer manuals are pretty much, IMHO,
useless. They tell how to open windows, adjust your mirrors, and other
superficial stuff. Anyone know why they cut out the good stuff???
