     Well, someone moved pretty quickly on this and it wasn't me.  Just spoke 
     with the gentleman selling this item and found that it sold at noon today.
     
     Looks like someone got a good deal.

Saw this ad in the WWW page for San Jose Mercury News.
     
VW Van Tent $50  578-3820
     
I presume the area code will be 408, which is San Jose. Slight chance 
it might be 415 instead. And now you know as much about it as I do.
