Okay,
	
	(refresher: brakes don't work well on my '56 bus, and they wouldn't
bleed right)

	I did two things: 

	A) Tried to re-bled the babies with the e-brake OFF.  That got the back
right one to bleed!  The front right works well, front left is marginal.
Turns out there are new lines on the right side of the car, but not the
left.... 

	B) Tested the line on the rear/left sise by taking loose fittings until 
I got some pressure.  (there was only an anemic trickle coming out of the 
bleeder valve)  The rubber line was clogged beyond belief!  I took it
off and tried to blow air thru it with the compressor, to no avail!

	So, today I picked up a new front line and a new back line.  I'll
put them in tonight!  

	One final question -- if the front right line was good, and the left one
bad, why does the bus pull to the left?

	Go ahead and post suggestions if you wish - I check my mail several times
a day over the weekend....

Thanks
Thom
