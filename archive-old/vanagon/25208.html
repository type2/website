So Bradley says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please subscribe Vanagon Marten Hebert
&gt; &gt; mphebert_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; This must be why he didn't come to look at my Vanagon today like he said 
&gt; he would.  He got hung up trying to subscribe to the list.  We need to 
&gt; get him a camper and some beer for the next camping trip.
&gt; 

I have an even better idea.  Why don't you also make his camping site the 
honorary central site for the group.  ;)
