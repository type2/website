As I was out riding, just riding along,
A'steering my bus and just singing this song,
When what on my dashboard should sudden appear,
But a green looking Santa with tiny green deer.

So I says to this Santa, &quot;Here, aren't you quite wrong?&quot;
&quot;You're all the wrong color, and Christmas has gone.&quot;
To which he replied, &quot;Son, just lend me your ear ...
and if you've got any, could you give me a beer?&quot;

Well, I had just a six-pack, right there on the seat,
So I gave him one quickly; he finished it neat.
Then he sat back, and burped once, then burped once again,
And he started to tell me this sad, sad refrain.

Of how, in the world of the Fairies and Witches,
The tele had put them in serious stitches,
Cause kids had no reason to give them belief,
So half of the Fairies were off on relief.

And one of them who was just laid off last week
Was the Leprechaun fellow with the green little cheek,
So now Santa's working on St. Paddy's day,
With his green little reindeer a'pulling his sleigh.

&quot;But I've not got it right yet&quot;, he said with a frown,
&quot;This gold pot malarkey is wearing me down.
&quot;The people are chasing, and grabbing and snatching,
&quot;And they hope that it's me that they'll soon be a'catching.&quot;

Then he sighed, and he got up, and went to his sleigh,
Said, &quot;Thanks for the beer, but I'm off on my way.&quot;
Then he poofed out of sight, as he said with a sneer,
&quot;To all a good night, and to all a green beer!&quot;

:)

remember: Will started it!!!
