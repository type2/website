Subject: Excess Air In Coolant System

Hi All,

The saga of Brownie Bus (84 GL) continues.  In all hopes of a speedy and
effective coolant bleed session last weekend, all hope was lost.  Just as
before, efforts to bleed the system were unsuccessful.

Once the system appeared bled, a test drive was taken only to find a *lot*
of air *and* pressure came into the system after only 1/2 a  block.
Previously all this pressure stayed in the system for 24 hours.  Much more
than the 15 lbs of normal pressure.  A cold compression check the motor
yielded 120-125 lbs per cylinder.  The seller of this 85 1.9 motor told me
it had cooling problems, but no external head leaks.  It has a new water
pump on it.  My conclusion is somehow there is an internal leak by the 
O-rings, so the motor's a rebuilder after all.  Guess I'll use the 2.1 I'm 
putting together in the Brownie Bus now.  8-/
