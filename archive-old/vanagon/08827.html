&gt; &gt; So, for the question -- has anyone else had experience removing a 
&gt; &gt; flywheel attached with the 5 hex head bolts and if you did, how did you
&gt; &gt; get it off, and after you got the 5 bolts off, did the flywheel come 
&gt; &gt; right off, or did you have to force it off with the large bolt or what?

Holding the flywheel is not trouble

&gt;  Then put the biggest wrench 
&gt; you have on the flywheel bolts and tweak those muthas off.  Oh, if the
&gt; bar you are using turns out to be too big, you may need to use longer
&gt; bolts than the ones that held the pressure plate on, and you may have to
&gt; use the holes at 12 and 4 o'clock instead of opposite ones if the bar
&gt; blocks access to the flywheel bolts.  I have always been able to make this
&gt; work in one form or another, though.

Yeah, but I can't find a 1/2&quot; drive that fits the 10mm hex head bolts.
We bent a 3/8&quot; drive one and destroyed a hammer driven impact wrench.
