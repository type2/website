On Tue, 14 Jan 1997 22:38:24 -0600 you said:
&gt;Does anyone know how to remove the instrument cluster bulbs that light the
&gt;speedometer, tach and clock? One of them burned out and I cannot for the life
&gt;of me figure out how to get that little black bulb holder off?! I check
&gt;Bentley which said &quot;Remove bulb holder&quot;... Hmmm...

yup. been there. done that. :)  see the little black &quot;feet&quot; on the bulb
holder?? think of those as arms on the clock (at 6 and 12). turn them 90
degrees (to 3 and 9) and the bulb holder just lifts out. so just grip the
holder in your fingers and twist ... if you think of the printed circuit
as the x-y plane (remember that shit??), you want to rotate the holder in
(around) the z-axis.

now, once you get the holder out, the bulb is still a bitch to get out. pliers
will only break it. :(  find a drinking straw about the same diameter as the
bulb, and push it down onto the bulb. push all the way to the bottom of the
bulb &quot;slot&quot;. this will surround the little wire &quot;feet&quot; on the bulb and you
can pull the straw back out with the bulb. :)

yes, there is a little special stupid tool (looks like some tiny ice tongs)
to do this. the guy at the parts counter showed me the straw trick. :)

good luck.
