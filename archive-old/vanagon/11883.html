&gt;With the sliding door with two windows it sounds like it could be a (ex)fire 
&gt;tender. I know a sliding door was an option on late split window panel vans 
&gt;but does anyone know about the two side windows? If they are factory windows 
&gt;they are recessed into the panel and if they are flush with the metal they 
&gt;were probably added later.

I have a picture of a 21 window with a sliding door, and it has two 
windows in the slider.  The picture is from a VW ad brochure, so I
assume its legit.
