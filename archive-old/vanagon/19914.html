Subject: RE:Philly Area VW Gathering?


Ric,

I will try to meet up with you on Saturday at 5:00,
Franklin Mills Mall. I live in Allentown, so maybe I
head down to the Philadelphia art museum for the day 
and have dinner with you. The only thing is, I've never
been to the Franklin Mills Mall. Do you know of directions
from the PA turnpike or the Schuylkill express way?
