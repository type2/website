Subject: Interior colors for '69 type 2

	Richard Endersby wonders what color to paint the interior of
a 69 UK spec. type 2. Light grey? Its Lotus White (L282) outside.

	Richard, my distinct recollection of my father's red '68,
my own green '69 and my current white '70 pickup truck is that the interior
metal is painted the same color as the exterior. So, for example,
the pipe carrying defrosting air up to the vents in the dash is 
whatever the rest of the body color is. Body color on the inside of the
doors and anywhere else not covered by interior vinyl or head liner, etc.
Body color in the door jambs, under the seats, etc. 

	Peeling back the carpet and mats should show more of the same,
and the engine compartment should also be body color.

	Bolted-on pieces like the steering, parking brake, gas tank,
engine tin, suspension, etc, were satin black. 

	Interestingly, the pedal and steering box cover I got
from a junk yard for my '70 is medium grey- dove/haze/machine color.
Like a glossy version of the matte grey that heater boxes and mufflers
used to come in.

	So your interior should be Lotus White too, if my experience is
a guide.
