Hey Guys,

I was in south philly yesterday and spotted the twin of my 86GL, same
color and all.  Of course it was parked so I have no idea who the lucky
person is who owns it.

This might seem like no news to you west coasters, but this is the first
Vanagon with square headlights in the Philly, Atlantic city, New York
area.

I got goose bumps.
