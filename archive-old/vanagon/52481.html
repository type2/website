&gt;Syncro on the Dunes?

&gt;How well does a Syncro Westy fare on sand dunes? We have a pretty
&gt;good set of dunes on the west side of Michigan (Silver Lake, Sleeping
&gt;Bear, etc.), and have been considering taking a Syncro out on the
&gt;sand.
&gt;

Not recommended by me - not enough ground clearance. You're supposed
to let some air out of the tires so that they will be less likely to
spin in the sand, but this lessens the clearance even more, and it's
just too easy to get high-centered and stuck.

Getting mud and sand caked around the steering unit can cause the
seals to wear out faster, leading to rapid loss of power steering
fluid and an expensive repair.

My opportunity to drive on sand dunes was at the Great Sand Dunes
National Monument north of Alamosa, Colorado. The Forest Service road
from Westcliffe over 9,950 ft. Medano Pass and down to Medano Creek
and the dunes is a well known SUV attraction.  I was able to get my
Westy Syncro to the top of the pass from the east side, but the deep
gullys in the road on the west side were too much and I decided to
turn around and go back.  The Monument's campground is a great place
to camp if the wind isn't blowing, the dunes stretch for miles to the
west; huge mountains of sand where Astronauts trained for the moon
landings. The 4wd road to Westcliffe leads north from the campground
and down into the wide, sand filled Medano Creek.  The big problem is
where the road descends the creekbank, it's just too soft and steep
and getting back up it would be difficult.  The sandy creekbed is also
treacherous.  So I consider the section of this famous trail from just
north of the campground to the top of Medano pass to be off limits to
Syncros, even tho the scenery is spectacular.
