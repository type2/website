&gt; Anybody have any experience with these?

Yes,  I have aftermarket Cruise control on my 85,  It was professionally 
installed by the retailer, it worked for three or four months and died.  
It was repaired by the retailer, worked three or four months and died. It 
was repaired again, after which it worked... (go on guess!), you got it, 
three or four months.  The warranty was now over so it has subsequently 
just ridden around completely useless, wherever the Vanagoon goes.

Thanks &gt; 

You're welcome,  But if you want to get one, let me know how well it works.
