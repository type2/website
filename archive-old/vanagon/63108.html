Subject:      gas in oil and bad flooding

Hey all.

I left for a trip the other day and had some problems not 15 minutes from
home.  (I had already been driving earlier so it was not a cold start)  The
van (85 kombi) started to run rough and stumble.  I kept going hoping it
was bad gas or something.  Sometimes white smoke would puff out (not oil
smoke, it smelled like gas)   By the time I turned around and got home the
right side of my motor flooded bad and I got gas in my oil.

Since I have been home i have:

changed the injectors on that side (used ones I had) one seemed to be leaking
changed the oil twice
checked the temp sensorII
and I am starting to check everything else I can think of.

It still runs rough, and has no power.  The oil is still coming out &quot;gassy&quot;
(how many changes to get the bad stuff out?)

If any one has had any experiences like this and knows what to do please
get back to me.

Or if you want to make an offer on my van (please), I live in northern
ontario (Canada)

TIA
