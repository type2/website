Subject: Re: Copy of: Front speaker replacement

&gt; &quot;secret pin&quot; was.                 ( methinks to spite me?!? )   Anyway, at
&gt; present, is seems that the only other alternative is to (a): bust off the
&gt; plastic tabs on back, or (b): Pry 'em out from the front with a large
&gt; screwdriver and totally shred the hell out of the doorpanels (which is what the
&gt; PO of my '84 did on his quest to &quot;upgrade the sound system&quot;
&gt; ( ie. JUMBO Sparkomatic speakers in the front doorpanels with foam rubber
&gt; cemented over the now gaping 8&quot; + or - diameter holes ) Looks real cool and
&gt; sounds even better. Oh yeah! gotta have that premium sound, ya know. 
&gt; 
&gt; What gives? Does anybody know how to unscrew them without screwing something up?

I guess I'm just lucky - or are '88s different? My speakers came out 
fine, although the driver's side wiring is somehow dead...
