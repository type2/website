Use a large screwdriver, carefully turn it by inserting the blade between
the teeth of the flywheel and leveradging against the motor mount stud at
the bottom of the case.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Just curious:
&gt; 
&gt; How do those with air-cooled Vanagons turn the motor over manually?
&gt; I've seen in Bentley the picture of the special tool that engages the
&gt; slot in the fan hub, blah blah but I don't have that tool.  I was trying
&gt; to do it over break and I couldn't get it.  I tried getting a socket on
&gt; one of the fan hub bolts, but I couldn't get this thing to turn over at
&gt; all, tho that worked with the '78.  Couldn't get enough grip on the fan
&gt; belt to turn the engine either.  So, for those doing points, etc, how do
&gt; you turn the engine over?
&gt; 
&gt; Sean
