Subject: syncro ?

A friend of mine is interested in buying syncro.  He wanted me to ask you
guys what year vw started making the syncro and when did they stop.  He owns
a 84 Westy now.  But of course he thinks the Syncro would be the ultimate.
 Completely self sufficient and all that.  Thanks for any reply's.
