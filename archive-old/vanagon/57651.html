Jim Davis querries:
&gt;So, you're saying that they made an MV and an MV &quot;Weekender&quot;? 
&gt;And that the &quot;regular&quot; MW had a fixed roof?
&gt;And that the &quot;Weekender&quot; MV has a pop-top?
&gt;Did VW use the &quot;Weekender&quot; term, or is that &quot;popular&quot; terminology?


Yep, there is an MV and an MV Weekender...the MV has the fixed roof, jump seats, bed, table, flourescent light and curtains.

The MV &quot;Weekender&quot; ( term used by VW in the US and in Europe) has the above but also the pop top, the &quot;six pack&quot; cooler, and screens.

BTW, the MV is referred to as the Multivan (therefore the MV) in the European markets.
