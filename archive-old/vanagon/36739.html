Subject: Re: I heard a 'nasty' rumor!

Actually Tom's idea (yeah, I bit at first) wasn't such a bad one. If VW 
wanted a real winner, they'd beef up the old splitty design (add heat, a 
little more power, better steering, and modern brakes) and sell it to 
people like me. 8) Well, I can dream...of course, my kids are STILL 
watching out the windows for the 54 in a little old lady's barn that's 
been parked and tarped for 40 years. 8) Joe
