Subject: Vanagon Floor Mats - description

I just received three sets of the Vanagon mats that I ordered for list 
members who asked for them (see archives).  Now that I've seen them, I can 
tell you a little more about them.  They are heavy black rubber, with 
Vanagon written on them in brown and white.  Unlike the pair that Parts 
Place sold Chris Pittack, these ARE mirror image left and right mats. 

As far as fit, I tried them in my '85 as best I could without removing the 
cardboard packaging (since they're not my mats).  The notches to fit around 
the wheelwell arches are exactly correct for a Vanagon, as is the indent 
for the gas pedal.  However, there are indents on the opposite side of the 
drivers side mat (to the left of the clutch pedal), and on both sides of 
the passenger mat, that aren't neccessary in a Vanagon.  I get the feeling 
that the mat is probably cut from a template that is meant for several 
vans, not just the VW, but nonetheless I was surprised how well it fits 
around the wheelwell arches (unlike the generic Pep Boys mats I have in my 
'85.)   Hopefully, one of the three listmembers who receives them can give 
us a report after actually using them.
