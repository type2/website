Joel's post on the bus video reminds me of a recent question on
assorted VW toys and models and such.  There is a company in NJ called
&quot;EWA &amp; Miniature Cars USA&quot; that has oodles and oodles of books, videos,
models, and even manuals for all sorts of cars (not just VW).  Phone
numbers are: 
  (800) ewa-4454 for credit card orders
  (908) 665-7811 for ?? (ordinary queries, I guess)
  (908) 665-7814 for fax

They also have an internet address: ewamincar_at_delphi_dot_com
                                 or 73424.1057_at_compuserve_dot_com

I once ordered a video on the early years of the bug from them and was
quite pleased.
