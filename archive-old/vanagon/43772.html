Subject: Re: URGENT: combustion chamber depth spec.?????

&gt;My favorite garage is working on my 91 GL and needs to know the combustion
&gt;chamber depth spec. ASAP.  At least we think that's what the info. would be
&gt;called.
&gt;The heads needed to be milled (I don't know anything about this stuff) and
&gt;he says he needs this spec. to put it all back together. Help please and
&gt;THANKS.
&gt;
&gt;I question why the heads are being milled.
