&gt; a word?).

You wanna talk crap?  Okay, let's talk crap.  Earl Scheib and One-day
are both crap.  I have personal experience with both of them.  At least
Earl Scheib doesn't charge a lot for their crap, but One-day is *really*
bad.  Plus they took 11 days to paint my car, and I took everything off
for them - bumpers, taillight lenses, etc.  Then they botched the repair
work they did on the fender.  Grrrrrr!  I was much happier with MAACO -
I don't feel they ripped me off, although I still don't consider them to
be a high quality establishment.  At least they were courteous, did the
job when they said they would, and it lasted more than 6 months.  BTW,
the Capri I let them paint won 2nd place in a car show 2 months later.
