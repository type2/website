Subject: More Bus Pix On My Web Page

        I have added a couple pix of my '56 at the beach, and a really cool
rendition of a factory brochure picture.

        A friend of mine (a graphic artist) had the picture as the
background on his mac, and went on vacation.  His cohorts snagged the
picture, made some modifications, and then put it back...
