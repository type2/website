Subject: '74 bus bearings

 Just got back from a week in Albuquerque visiting my in-laws and started
 tearing in to my engine again. Pulled off the flywheel and everything looks
 pretty but the bearing can be rotated easily about 10 degrees. Is this okay?
 Seems to me like the cases should be hanging on to this thing a bit more
 tightly.

 BTW, spent much of the evening reading through an accumulation of digests
 climaxed by the flamewar over caravan handling &lt;?&gt;. I would like to suggest
 that, when a few people get excited enough about something to start insulting
 each other about it, that they take it to private email so as not to burden
 the rest of the list with it.
