Subject: Re: Digest format

&gt;Is this list available in a one-a-day digest format?  If so I would 
&gt;like to receive it that way.  I would have mailed this to you only, 
&gt;Joel, but I can't seem to find your address.  Thanks.

Another good possibility might be an INDEX format.  Another active list I am 
on sends the titles once a day and lets you send a batch file back 
requesting only the messages you want.  On that list you simply send a 
command string &quot;set *listname* index&quot;.  After that you use the following 
batch file to order:

//       JOB
Database search DD=Orders
//Orders DD *
Select * in &lt;listname&gt;.&lt;message database no.range&gt;
Print &lt;message no. desired&gt;
/*
//       EOJ

I apologize to list members not interested in this meta, but we might 
preserve the participation of some members who just can't deal with *all* 
the mail.
