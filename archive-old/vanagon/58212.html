Subject: A different solution forPop Top Vents!

-- 

  Listees,

  I just got a New source for the Pop Top Vents!  They're made of Fiberglass!  They're 
NOT see thru, But they're MUCH stronger and the price is a whole lot better than the 
$139.00 for the Plexiglass ones!

  I'm selling these for $75.00.  They come UN-Drilled, so you must drill the holes on 
your own, but at this price, and the quality of the craftmanship, I think it's worth 
it.

  Anyone interested in these let me know.  I installed on of them and was very pleased 
with it.  I'm going to order a Quanity of them, so I can offer them at this price.  I 
don't have any right this minute. But should have them by the end of the week or 
Monday of next week.

  Kyle
