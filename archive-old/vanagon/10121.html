I once drained my coolant about 2 years ago and it was my first time to do so
on my 84 Vanagon. I followed the procedure in the Bentley book. 

I drove it to work the next day. After a few days later I found out the coolant
reservoir was completely empty. I refilled it and found out a few days later
that the coolant level went slightly lower. It remained at that level since
then.

My interpretation of this is that the cooling system still had some air in it
after my initial refilling. The system sucked more coolant in later and emptied
my reservoir. I thought the system will deplete the air out unless there is too 
much air in the system.
