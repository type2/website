All this seat belt talk has made me a little nervous. Right now
my '65 bus has the lap belt type.  I would like to put in the shoulder
belt type in the front seating area but haven't found any that would
fit or could be attached.

Anyone know where or how I might do this? Could a later model bus's
shoulder belt be attached?

Thanks.
