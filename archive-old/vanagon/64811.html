Subject:      Re: Brake Pads

I recently replaced the factory original pads on my '91 Westy at 65K
(along with the original rotors, arrgh!!).  Very similar mileage to my
'82 (twice replaced, at about 50K each time), however about 50% of my
driving is in-town, short commute type trips.

Went with dealer/OEM pads and rotors, since I'd had some unpleasant
experiences with aftermarket pads on the '82 (squeeked will driving/howled
while braking;  grabby).  Not sure if it was worth the extra $$ (~ $450
!!), though the replacement brakes are very smooth and absolutely quiet.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; with 7 year old, water saturated brake fluid. They did manage to screw up the
&gt; &gt; rotors and put on the cheapest, smelliest brake pads I've ever seen, but they
&gt; &gt; wore out in 10K miles.
&gt;
&gt; I've got 141k on my vanagon.  Still running the original brake pads, and
&gt; they are still about half there.  So, when 280k comes around, what should
&gt; I look for in brake pads?  Does everyone elses brake pads last as long?
&gt; Always had to replace them sooner on my other cars.
&gt;
&gt; Just wondering.
