Ok, I'm gonna catch some flack for this, but...

I personally like the babes in bikini's. Yes, I'm a family man over 40,=20
but I'm not upset at having to look at scantily clad women on every =
other=20
page. Quite the contrary.=20

I do however agree that the writing in these magazines are about 6th=20
grade level and could be improved, but pleeeze, don't take away the =
babes!

Running for the hills now....


Way to go, Capt!  Being a dedicated VW fan all of my life, I always =
found comfort in knowing I would attract as many babes with a '64 Micro =
as with a Camaro.
