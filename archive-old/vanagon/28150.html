I had the same problem with my '74 a few years back and changing the
ignition switch fixed it once and for all. I don't remember it being that
difficult either.

&gt;&gt; I'll turn
&gt;&gt;the key all the way off and back on and sometimes it will crank and start
&gt;&gt;after a slight hesitation, other times nothing.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like a problem with the ignition switch.  I'd start by checking it
&gt;first.
