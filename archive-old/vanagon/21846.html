Ken,

I used to have a '72 Campmobile which did the same thing. Being a little
less adventurous in my younger days, I tended to hold my hand out the
driver's side and pull down to keep the top from lifting--and woe to the
bus, the next owner put a screw right through the roof to keep it down 8-O.
I wouldn't have sold it to him had I known that would be his approach! My
'71 has the same top, but a sort of latch up front. When the top's down,
the latch catches the front of it; when it's up, the latch is not engaged.
I don't know how to describe it well except that it's something like a hook
and an eye, with the eye side on the bus and the hook side on the camper
top (pointing forward to engage the eye with the top down). This simple
contraption works great. In fact, the tie downs in the rear section of the
camper top are missing completely...and there's never been any lift (in the
50-or-so miles that I've driven the bus since I got it).

BTW, she's back on the road after teaching me a two-week lesson about CV's
bearings, spacers, brakes, and axles. I feel as though my education is
progressing well, 8-), even if I am a slow learner. Thanks for all the help
from list members.

Good luck with the top!

&gt;
&gt;I was driving accross the golden gate bridge on the way home from work on
&gt;what must surely have been the windiest day of the year. Of course my bread
&gt;loaf was all over the road, but that's another story.
&gt;
&gt;MY camper top kept lifting up slightly, and then banging back down. It
&gt;seemed pretty violent.Ddo I need some type of additional hold downs on the
&gt;front. The back is held down by the usual rubber strap and hook. I'd like
&gt;to mount my surf racks on the roof, but I'm loath to have the whole mess
&gt;blast off the car.
&gt;
&gt;I would welcome any suggestions for beefing up the present system.
