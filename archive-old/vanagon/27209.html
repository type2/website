Subject: 74 bus,1800

I have a question. What on earth is the use of the little gadget on the 
underside, foward of the right side rock guard on the 1800 74 bus.I have 
just purchased this bus and am trying to figure out what has been done to 
it. This gadget has cloth tubing( cut or disconnected) going in and out. 
BTW, it is between the tran and engine. 
  Also, what is  easiest way to figure out the location of the various 
senders. Some listing are of interest but I am unable to find out where they 
are.    Many thanks     John Jordan   Spfld, IL
