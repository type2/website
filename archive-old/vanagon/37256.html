Subject: 'lurching' vehicles

Believe it or not - check your motor mounts!  And I mean +really+ check 
them, not just &quot;yeah, they're there, so what?&quot;  Plus, it's really fun to 
do in a Vanagon; pop the engine lid &amp; have someone drive around for you 
while you're on your stomach watching the road rush by - cheap thrills - 
anyway have him/her feather the throttle on-off &amp; it will soon be obvious 
which mount is bad: &amp; remember, one having gone probably ruined the 
others, so.......
