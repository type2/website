&gt; The polarity should not matter with a tantalum capacitor. By definition
&gt; they are un-polarized. Only with regular electrolytic capacitors do you
&gt; have to watch
&gt;  the + and -.
&gt; The higher the voltage rating, above the voltage that you are applying to
&gt; it,  the better.
&gt;  As far as 22 vs 10 that depends on what your are trying to filter .

Ken,
	I beg to differ. Tantalum capacitors are polarized. They have a marking
to show the positive connection. The actual symbol for identification
can vary but it is there. Have a look at any comprehensive parts catalog
and it will identify the positive connection.
