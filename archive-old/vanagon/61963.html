&gt;The compressor seems to make alot of noise (as if the bearing are worn)
&gt;I was wondering is this normal?

	Are you sure the noise is bearing noise? If it's an intermittent
	(or even steady) squeaking/squealing sound, it may be that you 
	need to adjust or replace the A/C compressor's belt...
