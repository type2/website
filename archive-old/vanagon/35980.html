Subject: Re: Westfalia Awning wanted

&gt;I have been asked if I will ask via the Vanagon list for any advice, help or
&gt;info regarding the availability of a full length Westfalia Awning / Tent -
&gt;early sixties type. Totally impossible over here..any ideas out there as to
&gt;how one could be sourced? Cheers!

 I found an add in the Hot VW's which reads:

 VOLKSLWAGEN POP-TOP CAMPERS
 *Pop-Top Kits for all Models
 *Side Awnings for Campers &amp; Vans
 *Over 100 Beautiful Custom Colors
 *Ask About Other Items

 For more info send SASE to:

 VW CANVAS
 5505 Cordell
 Austin, TX 78723
 (512)926-6195

 I have not dealt with this company which brings the point that I couldn't
comment neither about its quality of neither nor its service. I'm trying to
locate an awning for my vehicle and just ran across the ad figuring I would
try and send for the information.
