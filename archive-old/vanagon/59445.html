&gt; To all:
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had problems with cracked heads on the 1.9L?  The hairline cracks
&gt; I have found are between the intake and exhaust valves on each head.
&gt; 1.  Is there a way to repair the cracks?
&gt; 2.  Will it really effect the engine preformance if I don't repair them?
&gt; 3.  Anyone have a set of used heads (not cracked) laying around?
&gt; 
&gt; Any info available on the 1.9L heads is much appreciated. Thanks

There is a real possibility that one of the valves will drop onto a
piston and cause much more damage.  You pay your money or you take your
chances.  I would recommend new heads.  Many of the rebuilt heads have
cracks.  The incremental additional cost is a small fraction of the
total cost.
