&gt; I have a Bently Vanagon Service Manual for sale ($45.00 including
&gt; postage).
&gt; 
&gt; Last week my Vanagon lost all coolant on I-15 near Hesperia, California.
&gt; After a mechanic repaired the leak on the lower radiator hose, he told
&gt; me that the heads needed repaired (something I already knew about).
&gt; Since some un-named and unknown criminal stole all of my tools somewhere
&gt; in Houston, Texas, I traded my Vanagon in for a VW Jetta. I enjoyed the
&gt; Vanagon for the past 18 months but I couldn't afford the time or expense
&gt; to repair the engine.
