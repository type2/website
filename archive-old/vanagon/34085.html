&gt; Programmable W/W on the MV?? Am I missing something? How do you program

If W/W means windshield wipers (excuse me, but it took me a while to figure
out what IMHO meant... yeah, I know, I have an internet book for my mac,
but that sucker is thicker than all the computer manuals I've ever owned,
stacked on top of each other, and I never read those either! 8^))...

the wipers in my GL (all EV's?), are &quot;programmable&quot; in effect.  Just your
basic intermittent switch, except you set it by briefly turning on the
wipers for one swipe, then waiting till the drips accumulate to the point
you'd like them gone, then put the lever on the intermittent setting.
Swipes come at the interval you chose...  I like this better than the dial
types on most cars, because you don't have to take your eyes off the road
to look at the switch, in fact you look at the road (throught the
windshield) to determine the setting.  Only thing about the VW wipers that
I don't like is that when turning on the washer to clean bugs and birdshit
off a dry windshield, the wipers start to move before the window is wet.
My 80 westy had that, too.  Oh well, here in So. Cal, the ozone will eat
the wipers before they can wear out anyway...

Oh yeah, if I'm wrong about the W/W interp, please disregard the above
paragraph, or at least forget the idiot's name that sent it! (8^))

&gt; So what EV news do you have for us news-hungry EV owners? What did you
&gt; see?? Any new models?? What did you drive there?

Ink me IN for this news, too!
