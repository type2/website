Subject: T-shirts/Stickers/Mufflers


We have finally got shed of the type2 T-shirts and stickers, they're in the
hands of the United States Postal Service. Exceptions are two people for
whom I have no addresses and whoever the hell lives in Davie. But the
inventory is accounted for and we'll get those worked out. We didn't get
the merchandise until Friday, thank the wholesalers, and the Cruise
Director worked all day Saturday addressing and stuffing (I didn't even ask
her!). Hopefully we've made it in time for Kelley Park.

Listen: The first time you wash your T-shirt you should do it in cold water
and you should put a belt of white vinegar in there with it. This won't
stop the fabric from fading eventually but it will definitely prolong the
life of the silkscreen ink. Not an old wives tale; this works.

THANK YOU to everybody who ordered. Once I get these last three ones done
(shipping costs) we'll have enough data to post an accounting of where the
money went/will go. Nobody asked for it but some people sent donations and
in that situation it's only right.

If you don't get your order within a reasonable amount of time, let me know
and we'll do what we can to fix it. Overseas people (not Canada), we had to
send them surface, airmail was ridiculous. Like a pound of airmail to
Australia is over $12. However those of you in VAT regimes will note than
anything this colorful and lacking a packing slip counts as an Easter gift
as far as my paperwork is concerned.

Newbies who keep writing to me, we did order about a dozen extra shirts in
order to lurch into the next price tier. These are a mixed bag of L and XL,
black and purple, first come first served. They're $20. I know that's high
but everybody else paid $17 in advance and waited patiently for five weeks
and longer. This doesn't buy my beer, it pays for our bandwidth.

Again, thank you all!

MUFFLERS: This week I start on the next project. For them that don't know,
there is such a thing as a stainless steel muffler for the aircooled VW,
but it isn't imported into the US. They're manufactured in England, and we
aim to bring over a raft of them at no markup for listees only, if we can
make the pricing manageable.

They DO make Type IV mufflers as well as Type I. I don't know whether they
make California spec. I'll ask about waterboxers, don't know that either.

Don't know pricing, I expect that depends on volume and skill at chiseling.
It'll be wholseale or below or we won't do it. This is basically a forever
exhaust. Those of us who replace a Kadron once a year can scarcely imagine
such a thing, but it is. ;)

We are NOT doing this on the list because there is no sense posting on it
to everybody when only some are interested. So it's gonna be a separate
mailing list. Also I'm sure we can get Beetle ones, too, so if somebody
wants to forward this to vingagevw they can get in on it:

If you are genuinely interested in a stainless exhaust, one-time only deal,
reply to this message using the following subject line:

   Mufflers

If you don't use that subject line I won't be able to filter your message
to put you on the mailing list and I'll probably just ignore you.
