Subject: Re: Vanagon power vs. hills and loads

&gt;ok vanagon owners, i know the vanagon is not tops in performance but i am 
&gt;wondering, if i load one down, will its performance SERIOUSLY decrease 

Not seriously, but you will feel it on acceleration. Trick is to get it up 
to cruising speed 65+mph/3600RPM and KEEP IT THERE. The vanagon has poor 
power below 2800 RPM. full or empty. Momentum is on your side for all but 
long hills stuck behind transports. I've towed a 1700lb car on a 500 lb 
trailer for 900 miles and never caused a traffic jam on undivided highways. 
Lots of momentun there. I usually hit 3rd gear on long grades with passing 
lanes  tim s.
