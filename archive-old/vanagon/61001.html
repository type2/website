Subject:  '89 Synchro looses power in rain

Hello all,
I recently purchased a 1989 Synchro that behaves in a peculiar
way when it rains and is forced to drive in city traffic, it looses
power.  If I turn the mobile on and off quickly it will usually regain
power.  I have tried to have the problem diagnosed with no luck.  
The previous owner probably had the same problem and failed to
resolve it, as the starter was brand new when I bought it.
