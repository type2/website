&gt; Hi VW Van Fans
&gt; 
&gt; Wife and I are about to sign ourselves away for the 1997 EV Winnie. Does
&gt; anybody have any words of reservation or encouragement? We need your
&gt; advice. We appreciate your advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it a good product?
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently heard that VW service at the dealers is very costly, and
&gt; frustrating?!
&gt; 
&gt; Will it hold its value and does it hold up well?
&gt; 
&gt; Anything else we should know before me make this (nervous) commitment?
&gt; 
&gt; wishing you well: THANKS!Let me know a summary of what you find out, please&gt;  I too am interested 
in a 97 but have not heard the best ( I have 91 Westie). Lee
