I'm not a propane expert, but I suspect mine doesn't work properly
either. I'm talking about the small, cylinder like (1cm diameter)
thing that sticks out to the right of the fill hose connection.
I understand that when the tank is full overflow propane is supposed to
come out there when the tank is more than 80% full. Is that right? 
Nothing comes out of mine. This hasn't caused any problem so far. I've 
used for about a year like that. The attendants at the propane filling 
stations I've been to just stop filling when they notice no more propane 
goes in. 

If my diagnosis is correct a possibly dangerous situation could occur
if the tank was filled to 100% (that is 100% liquid propane, as opposed
to max 80% volume liquid and 20% volume gas). The propane system could
be damaged due to heat expansion of the liquid, when there is no
gas to cushion the increased liquid volume. Right?

Are your symptoms the same as mine, or do you have a differnt
problem (ie the valve leaks)? Are you going to replace the thing 
yourself?

&gt; Oh yeah- I don't have one of those fancy electric water pumps for
&gt; my sink either so I rigged up a hand pump that fits neatly behind the
&gt; drivers seat. There must be some kind of cheap electric pump that can
&gt; be modified use for the same purpose...any ideas? I refuse to pay VW
&gt; for their over-priced parts

Electric in tank waterpump:

Mine is broken also. It stopped working last summer,. I dissassembled
it, and found that the motor was full of water and rust. After
cleaning it, and soaking it in WD40 for a while it ran again.
Not for long though, it broke again this christmas. Here are the
replacement alternatives I know about: (From memory, may not be accurate)

$47 Bus boys. Quality as good as orig I hope.

$29 Camping world. Probaly same as JCW below, but at Camping World price.

$19 JC Whitney. Likely cheapest quality possible.

$9 and up: Marine bilge pump. I don't know if these would work well.
Maybe too little pressure, and too much volume. Fitting is for 3/4&quot;
hose. I think the orig Westy is 3/8&quot;.
