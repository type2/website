&gt; flavor, for that matter? Just my $.02... BTW, I'm looking for a sunroof or
&gt; ragtop Ghia in the Austin or surrounding areas (Houston, San Antone,
&gt; Dallas). Needs to be around the $1k area, and restorable. With or without
&gt; engine. If anyone knows from whence it may come, kindly send thy message.
&gt; Thanks for all your help and advice-I do appreciate.

There were only 2 types of Ghias: Coupes and Convertables. Sunroofs and Ragtops 
came on the bugs only, to the best of my knowledge. (OK, there were also Type 
III Ghias, but that's a different animal).
