&gt; Actually, since we're at it, let me ask about something of a delicate nature.
&gt; Does anyone out there carry a porta-john? Those available commercially seem
&gt; flimsy. I'm 6'4&quot; and 215 lbs and I don't want to gamble on paper thin plastic.

This is one item not to try to build yourself! The Porta Pottis made by 
Thetford are inexpensive, last almost forever, and work great. The key is 
the valve which keeps odors totally contained, even on a hot day with the 
windows closed. The larger ones need emptying less often, and are taller 
(thus more confortable.) Sears and Camping World have good selections.
