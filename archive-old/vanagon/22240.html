                      RE&gt;PTFE as Transmission Elixur?              8/7/95

RUN don't walk back to the seller and get rid of that stuff!!!!.    Syncros in
a tranny require a certain optimal amount of friction,  and PTFE isn't the
answer.  For a straight transmission, Redline Synthetic Oil corp. makes a
Manual Transmission Lubricant, (MTL) that is specifically designed to retain
the right amout of friction for the syncros, while providing proper
lubrication.  It is especially good in cold weather to relieve stiff shifting
before the gearbox warms up.   I THINK that they make another version for
transaxels like VWs use, or that MTL is compatible.  You can check with them
at:  Redline Synthetic Oil Corp., 3450 Pacheco Blvd, Martilnez, Ca. 94553. 
(510) 228-7576.

The standard disclaimers apply, I have no connection, get no benefit (other
than the fact that with  MTL in my 136Kmile  5 sp tranny on a BMW the tranny
sure is a lot happier with MTL than wihout it)  etc  . . .

Tim Smith recently warned against using anything with PTFE for engines.
Does the same concern hold true for transmissions? I recently bought some
transmission cure-all in desperation (Shifting is quite stiff and I'm
reaching for a cure), but I haven't put it in the tranny (even though I
changed fluid this weekend). I don't like the tight shifting, but I can
live with that for the next six months as I save up the $$$ for a rebuilt
or new (yeah, dream-on, bubba) tranny.

The retailer told me today that I could bring it back in the next day or
two if I decided I didn't want to risk it. Should I put that $10 bill back
into my own pocket? or should I go for it.
