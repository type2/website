&gt; &gt; I would really like to get a Vanagon Pick-up.  I know they were imported to

&gt; &gt; a person could get one?  I guess one obvious answer would be to drive to 
&gt; &gt; Vancouver BC and visit a car dealer.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember seeing an add a few years back in HVW. A outfit in 
&gt; Coeur d Alene, Idaho that sold Pick-ups. Best of all they sold 
&gt; SYNCRO Pick-ups, and crew cabs. I don't have any back issues at hand
&gt; maybe someone else might. Ive seen one driving around in Whittier, Ca.
&gt; (SYNCRO Pick-up that is).

Uh-oh, I can already hear Joel drooling..... I'll bet he's already dreaming
of his plans for a trip to Idaho.  Don't forget to change the sheets Joel!

Cheers!
