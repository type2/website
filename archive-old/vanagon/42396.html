&gt;I wonder how deep you can ford with these things. Aren't the air intakes
&gt;approximately 5 feet off the ground? Does ignition get flooded out 1st?
&gt;

 The exhaust would be under before the air intake.  The added backpressure
would reduce power or stall the engine.  The air intake is 5' off the ground
but not water tight.  I have forded about 18&quot;.  The hand book said only
11.3&quot; wadding depth.
