&gt; I would like to put a set of 27 x 8.5 14 BFG All-Terrain tires on
&gt; my '86 Westy. FLTS says this is completely ok, yet it has not been
&gt; presented on the list(at least to my knowledge). 

Cory, I, and two other syncro owners I know, have and love these
tires. What kind of driving do you want to do?

The BFG A/T  might be good for you, even without syncro. They will turn 
your non-syncro into a better off-road and marginal road performer, and 
you will be very happy driving in snow and rain. Other non-syncro 
owners have put them on and like them very much.

If all your driving is highway, them why bother? If you want
the increased size, BFG makes other LT tires in 27 x 8.5 14 with less
agressive tread.

One syncro owner with the BFG A/Ts is very happy with them, but is 
acquiring a second set of rims and will mount more conventionally sized 
tires for long highway drives. On the other hand I  put 4000  miles on 
mine last summer driving cross-country, and have no complaints about road 
noise or ride. I like the inch of additional ground clearance, and the 
slight increase in cruise speed (or gas mileage) from the increased 
circumference. 

Overall, I think the BFG A/T are a GREAT compromise tire if you are
going to be driving in marginal conditions, syncro or non-syncro. But
if you are going to be mostly on dry pavement when you drive your Westie,
you should at least consider the less aggressive options.
