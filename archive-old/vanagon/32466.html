I mentioned to my brother how bad the headlights were on my '85 (Phillips 
Halogen lights), so he got me a Pair of Hella H4 headlights with 
replaceable bulbs for christmas (what a guy!).  They're technically not 
legal for use as headlights (designed for rallye racing), but the beams 
are engineered to put light exactly where you need it, without blinding 
oncoming drivers (low beams). The beams come up to about chin height on 
oncoming drivers, and also put a lot of light on the right lane, and 
roadside (so you can see the deer before it sees your grille).They shine 
like the sun when there's no one around (high beams).  I recommend them.  
If you dim them when you're supposed to, no cop is going to know the 
difference...
