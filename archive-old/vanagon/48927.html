 Hi! I just purchased an 85 Westy and have a couple of little 
 problems, the skylight leaks a little around the edges, the rollers 
 are gone and the whole thing looks like it could stand to be 
 replaced. Any thoughts on where to find one and how much they cost? 
 Also, the flip covers on the drivers side that cover the electrical 
 and water hookups need to be replaced. Otherwise I'm really happy 
 with it and to have found this list!
 Thanks, &gt;&gt;


Delta Six Industries provides this stuff to Westfalia.  they are no called
Euro=American RV products.  I've temporarily mispalced thier number.  I will
post it when I find it.  Someday I will clean up my paperwork mess and get
the important stuff in the computer.

Dennis.
