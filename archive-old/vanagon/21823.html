Subject: New Starter Cost with Install

I just had to have a new starter put in on my 76 westy.  It is running 
me about $180-$200 for a new starter and labor.

This didn't sound too high to me but I just though I would ask.  I 
pretty much trust the people doing it, but though I would get some 
input.

Let me know what you all think...

Thanks



Joe
