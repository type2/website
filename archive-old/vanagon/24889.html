&gt; As some of you know I have been looking for a front  axle beem for

&gt; few '74s. Will they work? I would like to be driving this weekend.  
&gt; any info would be greatly apreciated.

Based upon studies a few years back, I'm pretty sure it would work.  The 
big change came in 71 with the upper bolt mounts becoming spaced 
wider, about 4 cm.
