Subject: Wanted:VW Bus Tranny

I'm looking for a tranny for my '69 Westy.  I've heard that all Type 2 
transmissions will all fit from '68-'79 (With minor modifications) so I'm 
looking at anything that'll work.  Let me know what you got, what you want for 
it and where are you located.  I'm in Yakima but I'll travel for the right 
deal...

I'm trying to sell a Eberspacher Type B/2 gas heater out of a '69 bug for $125 
so I would be interested in a trade/cash deal.

e:mail me or phone (509)248-8066 

Jerry
