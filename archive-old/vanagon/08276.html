Subject: Re: Syncro Westy wanted EAST of the Mississippi 


Heck, I am getting pretty darn jealous of our friend with the 1.9L 
Vanagon diesel.  But what can I do?  Ask for specifics.

This is the 1.9L Umwelt diesel?  Can one buy a Vanagon/Transporter with a 
turbodiesel?  Will VW ever let me order one, here in the UUUUnited States?

Until then, my gas-o-leeen-burning 70 Kombi will have to suffice.
