Subject: Ignition wires 

I've been informed that a set of Bosch wires costs only 22 dollars.  I had
been told one person paid $80 and was quoted over the phone $138 I didn't
want everyone to think that I am that cheap that I won't spend $22 I guess I
have been groesly mis-informed.  Does anyone know what I would have gotten
for $138?
