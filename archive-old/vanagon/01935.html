&gt; check the little microswitch on the throttle housing. if that thing is
&gt; mal-ajusted, it can make the engine thing the throttle is not completely
&gt; closed, and it will run funny.
&gt; 

I checked this, and it was off (was closing too soon).  Adjusting it 
didn't affect the problem.  Are there any troubleshooting guides for
the Vanagon?  Or am I just asking for an ad for the Bosch Fuel Injection
bible?  I find that the Bentley manual isn't very helpful for tracking
down problems.

&gt; i'd almost bet on that idle air valve thingie, that is supposed to open
&gt; up as your engine gets warm. it's the thick rubber thing with an electrical
&gt; connection, kinda in the middle (but slightly to the right rear) of the
&gt; engine. it's supposed to 'hummm and vibrate' if it is in good shape.
&gt; (although i never have been able to tell if it is doing anything).
&gt; 

Mine hums.  I guess it must be working!?!
