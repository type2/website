One thing to watch out for is using these on rough roads with part of 
the carrier resting on the sheet metal. I now have two dents in my 
hatch from doing this, even though the carrier had large 4-5&quot; wide 
cushions on it. The bottom part of the carrier holds all the weight, 
and placing this part on the glass made it too high on the van. 

I returned it &amp; bought a trailer hitch type (which I haven't used yet 
on the Westy, but works fine on the Jetta)
