&gt; the bastard 40 HP motor was used from 19 May 1959 (chassis # 469 447) until 1

&gt; the likelihood of finding one of these motors is pretty slim as they tended
&gt; to self destruct quite quickly- which is why they were discontinued in just
&gt; over a year.   i think VW replaced the motor free of charge as they were so
&gt; embarassed. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have only seen one, which is now sitting in my garage. 

clara, those production dates are correct.  my crew originally had one.  
i have seen three others that are still complete.  they were all in low 
milage bus's.  there are a few tell-tail ways to tell if you have the 
bastard in your bus.  well actually, you can't tell if it is a bastard 
case unless you take it out, but...

the fuel pump has the fuel out line sticking straight up instead of at a 
angle

the cylender head tin has a large bulge on it running the length in front 
of the sparg plug holes.  it is about .75&quot; high, 6&quot; long ans 1.25&quot; wide.

the heads had a steal plate bolted on to it just below the intake port on 
the side parallel with the valve cover.  actually though, my heads do not 
have the plate there, but the head casting is the same.

the valve cover also has a cut-out to clear the plate on the head


the intake manifold for these heads is different although the difference 
is minute.  the manifold is a little narrower then a 40HP one.  i have 
tried to switch then with no luck.  the proper manifold that goes with 
the bastard has no extension letter in the part number.  otherwise it 
looks like all other 40 HP ones.

**** Does anybody have one of these laying around out there?  i could use a 
new one.

The distributor will be a early cintrifugal advanced type.  i am unsure 
if the model though.

as for as the case, it has a extra large rear main seal.  that is the 
tell-tail clue with out splitting the case.  a normal main seal will fit 
inside the bastard one.

if you split the case, the main berrings are different.  they have a 40HP 
ID and a 36HP OD.  hence, they are real thin and failed quickly.  the 
reason they were replaced.  when the factory/dealer replaced the motor, 
usually they just installed a new true 40HP short block and remounted all 
of your old parts.  that is the reason that alot of original 60 bus's 
still have some of the old bastard parts.

my crew cab is like this.  the dealer left all of the other parts alone 
and just replaced tha case.  if you are trying to put together a original 
looking bastard motor, the things above are the parts that need to be 
found and installed.

take care and God Bless
matt.


clara, is that what your bastard looked like.  this is what all the ones 
i have seen and researched into have/had
