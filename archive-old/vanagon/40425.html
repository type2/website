Steve,
	I don't want to seem TOO humor impaired but this not being friday 
and the plea for help genuine I don't find your reply very helpful or 
indeed advised.  This then is an official flame. Shame on you!

To the original poster...

   Having also had to deal with this problem AND having never found an
adequate solution other than load the car up with perfume and sell to
unsuspecting dealer! I have recently seen stickers on used cars that say
they are certified odor free so you may try calling a dealer about this
problem or try a rental car agency!
