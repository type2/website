Subject: 

Can anyone recommend something for the stomach for when you leap on an '84
Westy in &quot;excellent shape&quot; that supposedly has 35k original miles on it
which turns out to be bulls**t and the price goes from $4500 to $5000 before
you complete the deal as the owner has had the transmission rebuilt suddenly
but has no warranty as a buddy did it and then the first time you fill the
gas tank it spills out all over the pavement and the dash lights don't work
and the speedo doesn't work and ALL the brakes need replacement and the
second time you use the zipper in the pop top it completely comes apart in
your hand (on your first camping trip during a thunderstorm) and people keep
listing what look to be much better deals all over the country and now the
back-up lights either don't work at all or they stay on all the time (making
people behind me VERY nervous) and now we should all feel guilty since VW's
were invented by Nazis anyways?????  

KB-'84 Westy, the &quot;Brown Beast&quot; (on bad days) but I love her anyways and all
the postings to this list have made me feel much better since misery,
especially with a healthy dose of humor, loves company, and I've gotten good
answers to all of my questions.  Anyone ever notice the &quot;stubborn
expression&quot; (I know, it's anthropomorphic) on the front of a mid-80's VW van?
