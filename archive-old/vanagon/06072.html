&gt; I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both

&gt; idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
&gt; even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
&gt; of Yosemite.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking of something like maybe a weekend, Friday evening
&gt; through Sunday afternoon in a campground in Novemeber, December,
&gt; or January. 
&gt; 
&gt; Would any of you be interested?

  Yup!    But maybe someplace on the coast (Pismo Beach, Morro Bay???)
  would be warmer, considering the time of year. Also, Seqouia NP is bit
  disrupted right now because they are moving the Giant Forest Lodge.
