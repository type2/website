Text item: 

     Hi John,
     
     I'm afraid I don't know a lot more than I told in the previous posts 
     which is from my personal experience.  I do know that if anything you 
     shouldn't be running the thing off your battery.  On a full (I think 
     full- ~2lbs?) tank of propane I get about two weeks of continuous use 
     out of my fridge.  And that's boiling water twice a day in addition to 
     the fridge.  Once in the am for coffee and at night for dinner. Normal 
     gas grill tanks are 5 lbs.  Think about how many barbeques you get 
     outta one of those puppies.
     
     Whoever told you not to use the propane has robbed you of one of the 
     mose useful features of the westy.
     
     I'm wondering if anybody else is experiencing numbers about like this. 
     Anybody else wanna chime in?

A person who knows propane refrigerators!  When I bought my 84 Westie, I was 
told not to bother running the refrig on propane because the tank is too 
small, that it doesn't hold enough to do the refrig and use the stove.  Can 
you give me some info on how long the propane supply lasts, etc.
