John,  (and the List)

Thanks for the vote of confidence.  

I'll keep writing.  And the nay-sayers will keep doing what they do.  

Such people are an interesting phenominon of electronic communications, where
all messages have equal value, at least at the outset.  Indeed, there is a
wider issue here, lurking unseen just below the surface.

In responding to me, many people expressed surprise that anyone would find no
merit in my articles.  To look at that a different way, they liked the tales
(at at least saw no harm in them) and assumed their opinion was shared by the
majority -- and because of that saw no reason to 'vote'.  The upshot was that
I saw more nays than yeas.

This leads me to think that if I were some kind of survey, if I did not use a
randomly selected population and did not require a response from each, no
matter what issue was raised the negative voices would always 'out-vote' the
positives, ending up with minority rule.

In traditional forms of publication people 'vote' with their pocketbook and
so long as the number of paid subscribers does not decline, dissenting
opinions, while of some value, do not sway the majority.  But with electronic
publication,  a vocal minority can give a wildly skewed perception of an
article's merit so long as the majority remain silent.  

I wonder if this explains the generally short life span of most mailing
lists?

-Bob
