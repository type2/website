Subject: speaking of paint

I'd like to get my bus painted, but in order to cut the costs I want to 
do at least the prep work myself.  Does anyone have any suggestions on 
how the prep the car, besides sanding.  I especially am curious about the 
small areas, such as the rain gutters, under the sliding door mechanism 
cover, and in the air intake vents.  Thanks.
