Subject: suddenly won't start

After driving a couple of hundred miles today, the final stretch of about 80
after having stopped for ten minutes, I turned off the engine, and a few
minutes later it wouldn't start.  There was spark, it turned over, didn't
sputter, just wouldn't start.  After about 30 minutes it started up again
and ran fine.  What's up?
