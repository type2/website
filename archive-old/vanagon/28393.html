&gt;
&gt;Martin, Martin, Martin &lt;snicker...snicker&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Your comment: &quot;I can't belive how many uptight, politically correct
&gt;'sweety boys&quot; there are on this listserver.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;First off Martin, its so refreshing (he say's with a magot grin)
 to see that you have someting to contribute...after all this is the first
time I have read anuything from you on this listserv....(don't read much do
you?)
&gt;
&gt;Second, It is obvious that you are the typical reader of VW T&amp;A
&gt;and DB&amp;HVWs in that you aparently do not read CONTENT, but rather
&gt;look at pictures (probably while locked in the bathroom)(Oh, is that where
 you hang for your kicks...I bet you could suck a golf ball through a 
 garden hose)
&gt;
&gt;If you DID read content, you would have read, and hopefully
&gt;comprehended the fact, that my gripe with VW T&amp;A deals with the
&gt;idea that the magazine editors write poorly, write at a 6th
&gt;grade reading level, and use the bimbos in the magazine as
&gt;a way of either masking their lack of editorial and production
&gt;quality or appealing to a group of pre-pubescent mastibatory
&gt;motorheads who don't give a rat's ass about content, quality, etc.,
&gt;but would rather drool over the fact that this month's
&gt;&quot;Sano Resto&quot; has a blonde whose breasts have more cubic displacement
&gt;than the engine sitting in the back of the vehicle...(Oh, you have
 such a way with words...I'm getting so hot...keep going )
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From your command of English and your own literary style, it appears
&gt;that you are in the second of this group. For that, my friend, you
&gt;have my sympathy.
&gt;
&gt;I do agree with you on one point, this T&amp;A discussion has reached
&gt;its saturation point...and its now time to look forward to such
&gt;technical subjects as Friday Funnies....or Joel's lists...or
&gt;even how we get the tables on our EVs to stay in place.(Ric, your 
 superior taste and breeding reveal to all the world that you surely
 must move on rather than read the dribble of us poor illiterates!)
&gt;
