&gt; Amazing.  What's the HP rating on those and how much does the van weigh?

&gt; Thanks.

Can't remember HP rating (and the van is off at the shop getting trim 
work fixed)  I was at first unhappy with the power until I finally got 
the van out on the open road.  I don't really like the automatic 
transmission but its tolerable.  I still don't know how fast she'll go 
since the roads are way to packed around here.  LOTS of power at the high 
end.

I'm even considering the Rialta (Winnebago conversion) - my wife thinks 
the pop-top conversion is too small - I traveled the country coast to 
coast with a family of five in a '72 Westy so I don't agree - but all 
good husbands know how that disagreement will end. ;)
