&gt; If the Borbet wheels are appropriate, and will cause no problems - would
you

&gt;  New factory Alloys are $425 list/$300 if you're lucky

You can get used ones (when you can find them) at about $400-$500/set of 4.

&gt;  Borbet Alloys are $125/115 each from the TireRack - and look almost like
the
&gt;  VW Wheels.

If you don't have a particular attachment to the &quot;original&quot; wheels or keeping
the original size (like using existing snow chains), then I'd suggest you opt
for the aftermarket Borbets.  Buy 5 of them so you can include in tire
rotation pattern and also have a matching spare if one gets damaged.

The slightly larger size will likely make your odometer a bit more accurate,
but cause your &quot;calculated&quot; gas mileage to drop slightly.  I doubt any
measurable change in actual gas mileage.
