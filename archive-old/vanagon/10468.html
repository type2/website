Subject: 71 Westy that won't start
Date: Mon, 23 Jan 1995 08:02:09 -0800 (PST)

So Jay-If I only had a brain.. says:
&gt; back the Westy wouldn't start via the starter but would pop start. So I parked 
&gt; her, planed on 
&gt; working on it, and never got around to it until now. So here is what I did. I 
&gt; rebuilt the carb (solex 
&gt; 34pict3), put on a new cap, points, (why is it plural when there is only one?) 
&gt; and rotor. Drained the 
&gt; old gas and poured in some new stuff, and put a new/rebuilt starter in the old 
&gt; girl.
&gt; recent collage graduate, soon to be vagrant :-)

Well Jay, quite simply, If I had the problem you're having, I'd just start
by picking up my copy of John Muir's &quot;How To Keep Your VW Alive!&quot; and flip
to the procedure that covers the VW not starting.  It gives a good step-
by-step procedure of diagnosing the possible causes for not starting/
not running.  I'd go through it till I found the problem.
