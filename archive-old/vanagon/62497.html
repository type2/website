Subject: Re: Heater Slider Lever


&gt;Mechanic now says he disconnected the heater boxes.  I had complained that
&gt;there was a bad smell from using the heater (when I first bought the bus
&gt;from him).  He says it was because the heater boxes were soaked in oil.
&gt;Engine was leaking when he bought it from previous owner.  He rebuilt the
&gt;engine, so the problem is solved, but he says I should wait a few more
&gt;months for the boxes to dry out completely, and then he will re-connect
&gt;(says it's a 15 minute job).
&gt;
&gt;Does this sound reasonable? 

(In my limited experience) I don't think the boxes will 'dry out'. The fins
in mine were covered with burned/dried up oil. Reconnecting isn't too bad,
but I would try to get him to flush or clean the oil out rather than leave
it to get burned on.
