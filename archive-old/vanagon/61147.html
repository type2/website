There is apparently a special 'tool', but you can fabricate one from a
coat hanger.  You'll notice a small hole on both sides of the face
plate.  You insert your 'tool' into each hole which squeezes in the
prongs behind the dash that prevent it from coming out.  You'll want to
make sure that your coat hanger is good and stiff.  A slight pull on the
face plate and the radio should slide easily out.  (I think if your
hanger is stiff enough, you should be able to push both wires outward
and pull and let the 'tool' pull the radio out for you).  Hard part is
getting the wires out of the way when you try to shove it back in.

Good luck!
