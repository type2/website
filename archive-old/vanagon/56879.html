Date: Thu, 6 Mar 1997 09:30:08 -0800

Hopefully someone can help me out with this.  The conditions are as
follows:

1. Dead cold morning start:  starts and idles fine until as long as you
don't touch accelerator pedal.

2. As soon as you start driving the rpms will only drop to 2,000 between
shifts.  If you are driving above 2,000 rpms and take you foot of the
accelerator it will only also only drop to 2,000.

3. Stop at Starbucks for the morning &quot;fix&quot;, 2 to 3 minutes after dead
cold start.  Motor will not hold 900 rpm idle.  Slow idle down by
letting clutch out a touch, but idle creeps back up to 2,000 and holds
there.

4. After warming up (normal op temp), rpms still don't drop below 2,000
between shifts.  However I can now &quot;force&quot; 900 rpm idle by letting out
the clutch a tad, the rpm drops, I push the clutch back in or put in
neutral and it will hold 900 rpms.

5. And finally, just to throw a wrench into this.  Sometimes, maybe 10%
of the time, Lewis will idle but never do the rpms drop below 2,000
during shifting.

What the heck is going on here?

Thanks in advance.
