&gt;I have heard bad reviews of the VW synchro from mechanics and owners.  
&gt;Apparently the cylinder heads are flakey.

This *post* is flakey! 

The cylinder heads are the same between syncros and non-syncros so this
makes no sense. Also, most bad reviews are either self depricating humor or
syncro owners trying to make everyone else feel better about owning a lowly 2WD.

Post what ye know, not what ye muddled brain dredges up from the mire.

Uh... 

...I feel impish today, I guess...
