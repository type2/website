Hey there!

	One day I'll do one repair without breaking or doing something
else along the way that makes for another entire job :)  I can't
believe some people are actually naturals at fixing things!!  :)

	Well last night while replacing the wiper motor, I discovered
an amazing way to check for holes in the heater duct that runs under
the bus.  Late at night when it is dark out, drop your small mag light
flashlight down into the piping!  I removed the plastic &quot;Y&quot; that
guides &quot;hot&quot; air up to defrost the windows so I could replace the
motor.  And wouldn't you know it, slip, slide, and away:)  so it was
under the bus, remove the skid(?) plate that protects the pedals and
such, remove the patches I placed there to cover the holes, and use
the magnet on the stick to retrieve the flashlight (good thing it was
a metal one).  But in the process I could see the light shinning out
of a hole on the top I never saw before.  Oh well, duct tape to the
temporary resuce.

	I did get the wiper motor in eventually, and now I no longer
rely on Rain-X.  And even better this weekend we move into a new house
with a GARAGE.  Wow, no more repairs in the rain and wind on those
cold winter nights!!!!  Oh, summer is comming.  Oh well, better late
than never at least!

take care all and have a good weekend!
