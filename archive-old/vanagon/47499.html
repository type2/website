&gt;What are the pros and cons of tinting the windows in a westy?
&gt;Have you done it?  What is approximate cost?

I've had it done on both my vans.

Cons:
*Costs money
*Reduces ability of other drivers to notice where your're looking
*Reduces your ability to see out to the rear of the van
*May be illegal on certain windows in your state, in CA it recently
  got me a &quot;fix-it&quot; ticket after driving with tint for about 12 years

Pros:
*Keeps the interior cooler
*Protects dash &amp; upholstery from harmful sun rays
*Looks &quot;cool&quot;

I'd definitely add tinting while living in any hot / sunny climate.  Have a
tint specialist do it.  Have you noticed some tinted windows with bubbles &amp;
streaks?  Those are the ones that were done at home.  I'd have the front/side
windows tinted with their light grade of tint, if at all.

I paid a little over $100 for each of my vans to have all of the windows
tinted except the windshield.  I think I got quite a &quot;deal&quot;.  I'd expect to
pay around $150 or so.
