|I failed my safety inspection (for the first time in 11 years!)
|for two reasons:

|((stuff deleted)) ......

|What can I do to free up the cable easily? Any quick fixes?
|I am not driving it freqently right now, so anything to get

	i know that virginia is notorious for
	its safety inspections; but, one thing you
	might try is going to another inspector.
	i did this with my chopped bug, and it
	worked! you have to find an inspector that
	has a heart. avoid the stiff dry-cleaned
	pressed shirt uniformed types with the 10 gallon
	wide brimmed hats shiny shoes and dark sunglasses.

ps that bug is nolonger registered, for any of you  informer types.

		good luck,	guntram
