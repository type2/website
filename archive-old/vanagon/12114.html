&gt;I'm taking one of my diesel V's down to Mexico City soon, sure would feel
&gt;better if I had some extra oil on board....

the copley's used two plastic jerry cans to carry extra gasoline, so it
should be ok for diesel. and in places, they actually had to use all of it.
you might want to take along some really good strainer/filter ...
i understand that fuel contamination can be a problem down there in some
places.
