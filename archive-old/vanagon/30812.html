At the time that this thread was running around I mentioned that I had 
found a 2 for 1 pack at Checker/Kragen.  I noticed today that their 
circular shows that they're offering it again.  For $3.97 you get a 12 
oz. Techron Fuel Injector Cleaner and a 12 oz. Gas Treatment.  

The best deal around if you're baby's hiccuping.

Jack
