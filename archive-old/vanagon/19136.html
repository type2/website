So Andy Erskine says:
&gt; 
&gt; If you can get hold of a Reimo (or is it Riemo) catalogue, they have every 
&gt; conceivable Vanagon gadget you could hope for, as well as stuff for other 
&gt; campers. I haven't got one handy to check but I think they have agents in 
&gt; most countries so you can probably get their stuff where you are.
&gt; 

Have you been holding out on us Andy?  What catalog is this?  I'd sure
like to have a copy.  Could you please dig up the info. and post the
catalog ordering info. and/or phone number?

Appreciate it,

Steven
