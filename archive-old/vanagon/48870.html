Subject: how to change coolant tank?

Hi.  I'd like to change my coolant expansion tank, and I was wondering if 
anyone has any tips for doing this?  Should I use anything to clamp off 
the hoses before disconnecting, or should I just let the fluid run and 
then reconnect the hoses?  

Thanks for the help.
