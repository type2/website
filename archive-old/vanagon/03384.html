Well, I've been thinking about everyone's posts concerning the VW vs. Chrysler
vs. any other minivan mfr. debate and it's certainly true that bus/
camper/van owners are a breed apart, and I'll tell you why:

When it came time for our family to get another set of wheels, a VW was the
ONLY product that we considered.  We were so sure that we wanted a Eurovan
that we did not look at any of the competition, did not drive any of the
competition, and furthermore, did not even test drive a Eurovan before
purchasing one!  OK, OK, I know what you're thinking  :-) , but, hey, some-
times you just have to take a leap of faith and see what happens...
Besides, I thought it was a pretty minor gamble; my family's always had a VW
somewhere (mostly type IIIs) and I figured most auto scribes had their heads
up their butt anyway.  I haven't been disappointed, and I'd go so far as to
say that if the current bus offering from VW was an updated split window,
hell, I'd go buy that.

I'd like to see Mr &amp; Mrs Appliance Buyer have that kind of faith in an 
automotive product!
