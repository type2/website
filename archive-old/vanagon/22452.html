Tim,
In your response you mention Martin Schnieder (MSDS).  It seem that he would
be a natural to manufacture an aftermarket exhaust for the Vanagon since he
has an aftermarket exhaust business, has a Vanagon Syncro, and offers a few
Vanagon parts already.  I talked with him the other day about making a dual
exhaust for the wasserboxer and he seemed to think there wasn't enough of a
market to bother with it.  It seems to me there could be a consideable market
especially with the high dealer cost of Vanagon parts.  Maybe he could be
convinced to make this item? How many people out there would be interested in
buying a dual exhaust for there wasserboxer?
