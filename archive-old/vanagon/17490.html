Well my roomate just got back from Houston and to
vex me he picked up an auto trader, I thought I'd
list em.

1972, new engine w/warr $2500 (713)-337-4238 dlr. (I swear it
looks brand spankin new in the picture, and has louvered side
windows so I guess it could be a no pop top Westy)  In fact there
are about 20 other VW's in the background here so definitely worth
a call.

1978, Westy, pale yellow, pop top, runs good, reblt 4 spd., good brakes
tires, clean in and out.  $2400 asking (again in the picture looks simply
beautiful, got to love Texas.) (713)-370-9061 individual

1977, Westy, new paint, no rust, exc. int., new engine, w/warr
$4000 (713)-337-4238 dlr (same guy as above must do this VW thing
as a living.)

1976 Westy, new motor, trans (BOTH!) tires, cv's, etc (WHAT AIN'T NEW
on THIS BEAST?) has sink, nice int, SIDE TENT!!, table breaker box,
ice box and more, drive anywhere, very dependable, $3500 obo, 4x4
trades considered (why would you want one?) (713)-493-1221 (this has got
to be the best deal if engine and tranny are reputably done, thing also
looks immaculate but it is only a 2&quot;x2&quot; picture)

1985 Vanagon, new engine (go figure, heads maybe?) clutch, tires, exc
runner, $3500 nego. (713)-666-1494 (713)-561-7138

if anyones interested, also listed a clean '58 stock Bug for $5500
(show car) (713-443-4659, a '56 Bug (fairly custom $9000 in it) $4995
(713) 493-1221, and a '69 project Ghia coupe with new carpet and
interior (body looks nice) sans engine for only $550 obo (713)-809-5495
or (713)-726-1303

Hope someones interested
