Subject: Re: Error Condition Re: subscribe

I do not really know how to start subscription to a topic such as this.
I remember something like this procedure that I did from a few years
ago, and so I sent it this way. Anyway, I did want to subscribe to
vanvagon_at_lenti...  Please put me on your list of subscribers.

Thank you.
