Subject: RE: crank bearing removal

Give hot and cold one try before you take it to somebody with the right press.
Put crank in the freezer overnight, then heat the bearing with propane torch
or boiling-water rags.  

I'm starting to think that my macho-man, I can do *everything* myself approach
to garage life is over-rated.  A job like getting the bearing off the crank
is a way of finding nice-to-work-with, appropriately priced experts for the
times when I know I'm way out of my depth.
