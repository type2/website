Subject: Bus Boys VS. Bus Stops Center console prices

hey now,

i was just browsing through an old (1994) bus stops catalog an saw the
center consol that i bought from bus boys. i paid $90.00+ for the console.
bus stop (a division of RMMW) has them for $74.95. now i realize that prices
may have gone up in 2 years but $20?

and for some reason, which may be of my own imagination, i was under the
impression that bus boys had these things manufactured for themselves. ie,
i thought bus boys was the only folks that had them.

maybe i'm just in a daze.
