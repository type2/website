Subject: Help: 87 Westy, Checkout for purchase
Date: Wed, 26 Jun 1996 10:03:33 -0600

I am going to look at an 87 Westy tonight. Considering buying it.  Ad in
paper says: 119k miles, new tires, $7900.  The guy told me it's a GL in
great shape.  Tires are reinforced Michelins.  I have a 78 Westy and an
82 Vanagon, but I don't know waterboxers and I'm not familiar with
propane Westies.

What should I &quot;look for/test/beware of&quot; that is specific to this model? 
I know how to check out a used car in general.  I'm looking for things
that are different on these late model Westies.  I've read the FAQ's on
recalls, etc.  I brought my tools and jack, so I'm ready.  Just point me
in the right direction! TIA.

Dave Brooks
