 Hey Larry,
    Because of the price of gas here in  PGH. PA., this is a very
    big topic to me. My Syncro just reported a 16.8 MPG. Now my
    2 wheel drive Vanagon is never less then 18.5 MPG. Maybe you
    could gather everyones fuel milage and report back to the list?
   
   I think everyone would be interested to no that I, (on a very
   strange trip   got almost 30MPG out of my 2WD.
