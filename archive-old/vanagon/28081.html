Maybe I'm a little confused here --- what seal are you talking about? The 
canvas tent-like thing that is part of the pop-top? Or the rubber-grommet 
sort of thing I saw on an older westy awhile back, went around the bottom 
of the pop-top? I have never seen one of those before, and I've seen lots 
of westys -- or maybe I just never noticed --- but there is no trace of 
one on  my '73.

    All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace!
