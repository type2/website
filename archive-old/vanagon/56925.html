Yes, it *is* available through The Bus Depot.  &quot;Dealer Only&quot; parts are 
typically around 20% off dealer list.   Generally about the same as what 
Camelback charges out West, give or take a percent or so.  Sometimes 
cheaper though; one of the importers I deal with gets some &quot;dealer only&quot; 
stuff directly from VW in Germany and has them for less than VW of America 
prices.
