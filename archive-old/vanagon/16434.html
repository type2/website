Subject: Re: Engine out routine

&gt;I would like to see how close I can 
&gt;get my shifting to new stock.  I am hoping there is much room for 
&gt;improvement here.  I have only driven one VW bus and it sure does feel

Aside from making sure all the linkage is 'tight' under the bus, there are a 
couple of fixes if the trans is out. Where the shift rod enters the trans 
the end cover can be removed to expose the selector rocker arm. This piece 
slides to select either 1/2 or 3/4 gears and rocks to get 1 or 2 say. The 
faces on this wear out, giving lots of slop at the stick, or you simply 
can't get a gear. Replace it with NEW, don't try for a fixup. Where the 
shift rod enters the case/end cover may be worn also, not as big an effect 
on shifting. Check the end of this shift rod where it contacts the rocker 
arm also.
        If you have the 'pop out of gear' syndrome in 4th on acceleration I 
don't have a fix. It's never happened (yet) to me. Flushing the gear oil 
can't hurt and is cheap. tim s.
