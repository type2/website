Subject: Vanagon stuff I need.

Hi Volks,
   I'm looking for a few things for my 82 Westy.
           1st: Front door panels, dark brown, good shape w/no speaker holes.
           2nd: Refrigerator interior parts, ice tray, door self guards the
ones
                 soda in place.
           3rd: Mudflaps, especially the one that protects the propane tank.
                I've never had a vanagon westy that had that stupid flap.
           4th: Table, the big one near the closet, w/pole.

Well I guess thats it. I hope someone can help me out.  Thanks for the help.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
