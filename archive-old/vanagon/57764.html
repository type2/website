Subject: change in CCC's mailing list


Thanks to all of you who responded with additions and deletions to
the camping mailing list.  Since this morning's announcement on that,
we've gone pro - thanks to our very own Ron Lussier, who's set up
a &quot;real&quot; mailing list for us.  To subscribe to it (and I highly recommend
you do), do the following:

Send mail to 'ccc-request_at_vanagon_dot_com',
with the following word:

     subscribe

Please note - because of this great new easy method, I will no longer
be sending out info to all of you as I have in the past.  This means
if you want to receive info about the upcoming campouts, you will HAVE
to sub to Ron's list, or pray that I happen to remember to send the
same info to the air- and/or water-cooled bus/van mailing lists.  AKA,
this means I&quot;m retiring in a sense from the mailings, but not at all
from organizing and helping to get the info out there to you.  This
new system will just make everything faster, easier, and more convient
not only for me, but hopefully for all of you, as well.

Thanks,

Martha
