Subject: RE: 911 motor in a VW transporter

A. Burczyk inquires whether we're discussing Porsche fours or sixes.  Sixes.
Actually by definition a 911 has a six; if it had a four it would be a 912.
912 or 914 engine not worth the trouble to swap into a van, I think.  Nominal
HP increase of 15 or so not matched by change in peak torque.

Six is a different story.  The exhaust note alone is worth the price of
admission.
