Subject: Re: Cool Oil

Yo, this may be an old question; any recomendations for a particular
make and model for after market oil and water temp gauges? I like to
monitor myself into a coma with such instruments with their (assumed)
accuracy. Also, I seemed to have missed something when I signed on not
too long ago and did not recieve info on how to access the archives.
I have an 85 Westy GL....thanks!  Kit Carter
