Vanagonians,

I just returned from the parts store over lunch.  Not having owned an
gasoline powered car since 1980, its been a while since I purchased
spark plugs!  Now that we own a wasserboxer I thought I'd replace the
rotor, cap, wires and plugs.  Did you guys know that spark plugs now
have THREE &quot;prongs&quot;!  Never even heard of these critters before!

Anyone out there using these 3 pronged jobbers?  Comments?  What do
three prongs do for you?
