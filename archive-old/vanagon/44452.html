&gt; 	I am trying to locate a campsite somewhere between Santa Cruz 
&gt; and San Francisco that we can reserve for the holiday weekend. 

I found some detailed information on beach campgrounds in the
_California_Coastal_Access_Guide_, third edition, 1983, Univ. of Calif.
Press.  If you can find a more recent edition in a library, I'm sure it 
would be a great reference.

I also have the _Official_Guide_to_California _State_Parks, 1992 edition. 
It is published by the California Department of Parks &amp; Recreation.  It 
says, for info on state parks, call 916-653-6995.  For info on state park 
publications, call 653-4000.  For state park reservations and reservation 
information, call MISTIX at 800-444-7275.
