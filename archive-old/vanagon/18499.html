Subject: Bug-Out happenings and 59 single cab update


Troy and I got a ton of stuff at the used section, including a 36 hp '55
beetle engine for 50$ the guy had it set up and running. We put it in the
pick up to check it out yesterday and did a compression test (our other 36
is fine but we wanted to play). It passed the test! We really did get lucky
at this swap meet, I guess cause it was raining. I have never seen so much
inexpensive NOS stuff in my life. One bummer was that people were selling
used crapped out Muir books for 15$, and I saw new spiral editions for 20!

Didnt really get a chance to look at the T1 and T3 show cars, but did check
out the T2's, unfortunately we didnt get to meet any other list members.

59 single cab: Rebuilt brake cylinders all the way around (except passenger
rear, that wheel just doesnt want to budge yet, any suggestions?). New and
repacked front bearings. Beggining to install glass. Put in &quot;new&quot; engine.
Did a littile primer work. Took her for a test drive and decided the shift
mechanism needs some of those WCM rubber bearings and such cause the stick
is really LOOSE.

Bye the way I have seen crappy and nice busses at dead shows, My bus may
look crappy on the outside but so do I! It was the dreadfully ugly 71 westy
with the complete interior parked in front of the armory (in full view at
the entrance gates, we slept there the night B4)at the bug out.

later
