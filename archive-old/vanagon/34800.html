Subject: humble begger...hubcaps for an 83

Friends,
Does anyone out there have some volkswagen wheel covers that they would 
be willing to part with?  15 inch.  I'm sick of driving around with two 
different kinds of caps.  Looks Hoopy.  Help me make my bus all it can be!
E-mail me directly...I don't want someone else to snag them.
