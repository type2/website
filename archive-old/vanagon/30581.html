In a message dated 95-12-08 23:21:30 EST, you write:

&gt;  Not only does the
&gt;eigine warm up more quickly, adding to improved efficiency and fuel
&gt;consumption, but it also makes for warmer passengers and cleaner windows.
&gt;the
&gt;air from the heat vents after the car has been parked for two days at -6
&gt;degrees reaches +68 degrees in 30 seconds.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
Has anyone out there in colder climes tried in-line coolant heaters?  If so,
where is the best place to install them?  Will the constant heat break down
the corrosion inhibiters faster, or is there an insignificant amount of heat
generated (compared to real engine heat)?

Thanks,
