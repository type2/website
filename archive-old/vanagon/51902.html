&gt; face/eyes/ears/hair/etc. when you pull the sensor out, some coolant will
spill
&gt; out .. maybe a pint (?), so be prepared with a bucket or pan or something.
&gt; also, the rubber o-ring may not come out with the old sensor, so you'll have


Do you need to bleed air out of the system after replacing this sensor, or is
it just plug and chug?

Thanks......
