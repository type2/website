Subject: Road trip!

Hi all

well, I'm taking a trip down to California to get a change of view, dry out
from the wet etc.   My friend Duncan &amp; I are driving the 66 micro, leaving in
a couple hours, if all goes well.  I'm packing the tool box, and other
neccessary items.

more later, 

oh, this is this bus's first long trip.  It was revived about 4 months ago,
and now shall stretch her legs.  :)

well, gotta run

clara
