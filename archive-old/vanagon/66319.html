&gt;  Howdy all, and greetings from the somewhat motivationally challenged here of
&gt; the North Carolina Triangle Area Busses. (That's the Research Triangle area, as
&gt; in Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, etc)
&gt; Anyway, we have decided to meet this coming Thursday, October 9th, for a
&gt; potluck dinner and bus talk/comparing/showing off session.
&gt; We'll meet at my house, which already seems to attract busses, and handily has
&gt; a large parking lot across the street, Thursday evening around 7:00 or so.
&gt; If you want to bring something ready to eat, that's fine, or else we can cook
&gt; in the busses in the parking lot, for that official Shakedown Street feel, or
&gt; else we can use my kitchen if necessary. We'll all just pitch in for a lovely
&gt; smorgasboard of delicious food...
&gt; Also, if anyone has a little too much fun to drive home, you can camp out in
&gt; the lot.
&gt; I live in Raleigh, about 2 miles inside the Beltline off Hillsborough St.
&gt; Here are directions-
&gt; &gt;From the I-440 beltline, take the Hillsborough Street exit. Head in towards
&gt; downtown for about 2 miles or so. Look for IHOP (International House of
&gt; Pancakes) on the right, which will be the corner of Hillsboro and Park Ave.
&gt; Turn Right onto Park Avenue, go up, and you'll see all the busses in front of
&gt; my house. (2 '67s live there, along with a few latemodels belonging to various
&gt; SO's and friends). Park in the YMCA parking lot across from my house...
&gt; Anyway, I hope to see lots of the various listvolk there...
&gt; Join us!
&gt; E-mail me if you have any questions...
