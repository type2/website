How hot can it get?

&gt; &gt; I have this same question.  I have about zero use for an air conditioner 
&gt; &gt; here.  Is there any possibility of running hot water through the air 
&gt; &gt; conditioning system?  Has anyone done something as crazy as this?  I 
&gt; &gt; guess I can't imagine just the dash vents keeping up with the cold when 
&gt; &gt; it gets below zero.
&gt;  
&gt; How about running an air conditioner but with the condenser in the cabin
&gt; (instead of outside) and the evaporator (which is normally inside) in the
&gt; engine compartment.  Essentially, you have a heat pump here.  Heat pumps work
&gt; great anywhere that the temperature (outside) is above 40-45 degrees.  What
&gt; you are doing - for those who don't understand an what a heat pump is - is
&gt; trying to cool down the outside (helps on global warming ;-) ) and trasferring
&gt; that heat inside.  Think of putting that home window A/C in the window
&gt; backwards.  A/Cs don't create cold - they just transfer heat from one place
&gt; to the other.  Reverse the direction of the transfer.  I would guess that a 
&gt; VW A/C unit would probably be rated at about 20KBTU (average for a midside
&gt; american car,  van is much bigger that that).  Run in reverse, you would get
&gt; about 20KBTU of heat in the car - about the same as a 4000 watt 
&gt; (333 amp _at_ 12 volts) electric resistance heater.  By putting the evaporator
&gt; in the engine compartment, you should have temperatures above 40 degrees even
&gt; in the dead of winter.
&gt; 
&gt; Dave (no bus/vanagon westfalia yet - but looking :-) )
I agree entirely w/ the concept:)
20KBTU cooling seems moderately reasonable; but by the 2nd law of 
thermodynamics &lt;energy is always wasted/converted to a lower state i.e. heat&gt;
A heat pump cycle should be more efficient. Water as a medium has a very high
latent heat (i.e. it takes a long time to absorb and release energy)
Oil on the other hand (I have no waterpumper :)  well not yet at least) 
has a signifigantly latent heat and therefore absorbs and releases heat 
rather quickly. [makes you wonder why they use it as a coolant:) ] As far a 
modifying the existing hardware, yes the condensor and various thermodynamic 
apperati would need to be removed but the fans and fins and all of the vitals 
just happen to be located in one neat, sano little package once refered to as 
the air conditioner. Perhaps some of you racerdudes can provide insight into
how adding approx 30ft of line and perhaps an aftermarket pump (in series w/
the stocker)  to the existing oil circuit would be a problem.

KEEP UP THIS DISCUSSION, I'M VERY INTERESTED AND WOULDN'T REQUIRE MUCH
PERSUASION TO PLAY LAB RAT.
