  I have an '82 Diesel (remember, the one that leaves its mark *everywhere*),
but I would be very interested in learning the best way to grease CV joints on
older busses in the event that I find a masochist who owns a non-water-box
up here in the arctic who needs some help from somebody who enjoys scrubbing
grease from his fingernails. 

Does anybody on the list have a best-way-to-grease-cv-joints story?

..Was this an adequate enough invite?

Why is it that when I call a  FLAG, and say &quot;I have an '82 Diesel Vanagon&quot;
They know *exactly* who I am?
