        Dear Pete:
        
        The &quot;S&quot; switch changes the shift points in your automatic 
        transmission.  The &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;sport&quot; according to my owner's 
        manual. I have used it sparingly because it increases the 
        &quot;windout&quot; time and lowers my gas mileage.  There is some sort of 
        electric gizmo (Joel help me here) that the switch activates to 
        accomplish all of this.
        
        If your 93 has a tach, try driving with the light off first then 
        the light on and watch the difference in rpms.  It was especially 
        inefficent in local traffic (lots of rolling hills) so I rarely 
        use it.
        
        If I remember correctly, you have the Weekender package in your 
        93.  I got your address earlier but have not had time to ask for 
        your opinion about it.  E Vans are rare around here and that 
        package is practically nonexistent.
        
        Skip Correll
