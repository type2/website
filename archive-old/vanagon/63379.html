Thirsty Volks:

I bought cupholders that sound identical at Camping World.  The cupholders
come in various colors including brown.  They are less than $10 and have the
fold-down cover which becomes the base, and can accommodate a juice can up to
the big 32-ounce mega-drinks using the adjustable wings which fold up to the
sides.  I like the wings because the center between them is open so a coffee
cup handle can still fit in.  When folded, they are square.

There are lots of these places along the major highways in California, I'm not
sure how many there are around the country.  Check them out.  They have a web
site:  http://www_dot_campingworld_dot_com/, but I couldn't find the drink holder on
it.
