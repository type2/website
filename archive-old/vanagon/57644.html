Subject: Headlights Problem


Here's the problem:

I've got a 1980 Vanagon L Camper.  All of a sudden the headlights won't 
turn on.  

I checked all the fuses too.  The brake lights will come on, but when I 
turn it all the way down for the headlights, the red &quot;Brights&quot; light 
comes on, and no headlights.

Then when I turn on a turn signal, the lights flash between the green 
turnsignal and the brights light, much as it does with the hazards on.  
But on the outside the turn signal does work.

The hazards work too.

Any suggestions?

thanks,  Kyle
