Subject: FRAM filters

	On the way to work this morning there was an advertisment on the
back of a bus for the new Dual Gaurd Fram Filter. It had some statement
underneath the big Filter picture that read something along the lines of:
rated #1 filter for (so many) years! Anyone know anything about it?
	I have a FRAM filter on my van, and so does another freind who owns
a van. I'm not sure I could even notice a difference between one type and
another, bu then again I have NO expereience or comparison to gauge
against.

my 2 sense. :)
