&gt;Hey Nancy,
&gt;     My van too has deer hair caught in the grill and body seam on the
&gt;drivers side.  The deer I hit seemed to want to be hit.  I changed lanes
&gt;twice to avoid her.  She ran out of the ditch on my right side of the road.
&gt;I swerved left then back right as she made the far side.  She then ran back
&gt;accross the highway  I swerved again and she changed directions again!!.  I
&gt;hit her as she tried to make it to the far side of the road.  Luckly I had
&gt;time to slow down, so the damage was not bad on the van.  A bent bumper , a
&gt;dent  between grill and turnsignal, and a smashed fog light.  Tried to find
&gt;the deer but she ran/crawled into a dense thicket.  It's been 6 months and
&gt;the hair is still there.

I would not lose sleep over this deer.  It was obviously a case of suicide.
