OOOOH, neat! I think BMW lost something special when they stopped making
the Isetta :) BTW I just received a poster from Germany advertising an
Isetta rally in Munich. Races ( at the Schloss Nymphenburg) and displays
at the BMW museum.

Ooooh can you imagine a Unimog, a Vanagon and an Isetta parked in your
driveway?
