Subject: '66 steering



Went for safety this morn and we failed on a few small items (already fixed)
and one potentially bigger item: loose king pins.

Haven't played with them yet (which means they may be tightenable?),
but what are my options re replacement?  New? Remanufactured? ???

What can I expect to pay for these animals under the various options?

Thanks for the help:  I'm almost there:-)
