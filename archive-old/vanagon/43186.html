&gt;Or being told, when asking for DOT-5 sillycone brake juice &quot;Nobody uses 
that
&gt;stuff.&quot;

Then there's the parts store (can't call it a FLAPS) that has your part,
and closes at 5:00. So you leave work an hour early, fly over, get there
at 4:50, and notice the little white mini truck with the parts store's
logo on the side zipping out of the lot as you approach the dark, cold,
lonely, LOCKED doors of the store.


&gt;&quot;Oh, you mean AMERICAN metric fittings.&quot;

The kind you install with a metric crescent wrench?   :^)
