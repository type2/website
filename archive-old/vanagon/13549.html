Subject: Major Child Problem /f


My kids (11yrs and 7 yrs) seem to love the Vanagon(s) and the EV... 
Then again, out here in (semi) rural PA, people either drive minivans
or Suburbans....

&gt;   Ok Folks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the 
&gt;   school dance tonight in the bus...

Why not put a big sign (I mean BIG) on each side of the Vanagon
that says:  &quot;(Your Kid's Name)'s DAD&quot;  when you drive to school to pick him up?
I think it would calm your son quite fast...


&gt;
&gt;   So, am I alone with this? Any net.experience on remoulding
&gt;   recalcitrant posterity?
