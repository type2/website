Subject: C.F.I. Fuel Injection help?

If any of you technical wizards know anything about that great 80's 
phenomenon called Carbuerated-fuel injection, please e-mail me at

rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu

I would post details, but it's for my girlfriend's (argh) Buick 
(she hasn't come around yet...)
Thanks,
  Richard
