So Richard says:
&gt; One thing I did notice about continuous mountain driving, is that there
&gt; seems to be a gap between 2nd and 3rd gears. Anyone else noticed this?
&gt; What I mean is that you must rev 2nd really high, then shift, and then
&gt; 3rd still revs kinda low. this is really irritating while climbing hille
&gt; at 10,000 feet. 

Yeah, actually I notice it more on cloverleaf on/off ramps.  Revs too high
in 2nd and lug too much in 3rd.  I usually just slow down in 2nd and watch
the people in the rear view cussin' and swearin' at me. :[  

&gt; So, if anyone has any desire to do any camping out west, or just want to
&gt; try out a Vanagon to see how it is, I 100% recommend Roamin Holidays.
&gt; I Can put you in touch with Tom Brouilette, or NEATO members already can
&gt; get in touch with him. Another list member, Ron Lussier, has already
&gt; reserved one for later this summer. It was super fun, and I had a great
&gt; time.

I thought Tom Brouilette was on this list.  Did he drop out?

&gt; I found quite a surprise at the Monticello, UT. KOA; the owner's father
&gt; was one of the first VW dealers in Ca. He had in a garage the first Bug
&gt; that was imported there, a '54 oval Bug, with working semaphores, and
&gt; only 35,000 ORIGINAL MILES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Uhg!!!  I'd love to have that.  That was the year of my birth!!!  


Sounds like a nice trip.  Good story.

Cheers!
