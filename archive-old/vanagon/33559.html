And I gotta agree with William...

I fully intend to drive the '54 when the time comes.  I have a friend with
a '55 Deluxe and he's talking this madness about heated storage, yada yada,
me, I'm gonna drive it!  Maybe not on camping trips (where to sleep?)
or surfing (where to put the board?) and competing in monster tuck rallies,
but I would like to drive it around town, etc...
