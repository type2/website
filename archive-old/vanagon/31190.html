Subject: RE: 3 feet and as many hands

&gt;All of this cobbled gymnastics reminds me of the recent &quot;Rescue 911&quot; show
which retold the story of a Mexican National family driving a pick up truck
with a broompole and coathanger apparatus for a brake pedal. They approached
a ferry landing to cross to the US for a day of shopping.  The brake
contraption failed, the truck zoomed into the Rio Grande and the whole
&quot;familia&quot; almost drowned. Saftey first, VW amigos! A good number of us have
been forced to cobble our treasures together in emergency situations. 
Lets make an extra effort, especially during the holidays, to make sure that
our family, friends and others around us are not placed into danger due to
our neglect. (Unexpected mechanical failures aside).
