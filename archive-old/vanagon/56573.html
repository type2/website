Subject: Re: oil additive(s)

Whew!  I'll try to clean-up my act!

Actually, I change the oil every 3000 miles or sooner.  I should have 
realized that such an oversight might lead to the automatic assumption  
that I don't.  
Also, there are 151k on the original engine, unfortunetly, I don't know 
how diligent the PO was.
BTW, are &quot;YOU PEOPLE&quot; polar to &quot;us people&quot; or are there other dividing 
lines I'm not clear on?

Thanks for the Vanagon info.

&gt; &gt; Like many listees, I have occasional noise from a sticky lifter.  It used 
&gt; &gt; to only manifest itself occasionally when I started-up and always went 
&gt; &gt; away and stayed away by the time the engine warmed up fully.  I also used 
&gt; &gt; to only use the van for long freeway trips.  For the last year I have 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; been using it as a daily driver, only 4 miles to work, all uphill and the 
&gt; &gt; engine doesn't fully warm up on this short trip. 
&gt; (snip)
&gt; &gt; slower city driving.  I wonder if simply more dirt has accumulated (if 
&gt; &gt; this is actually the problem!) and would some long freeway trips at least 
&gt; &gt; reduce the noise to the way it used to be.
&gt;     Yes there is &quot;MORE DIRT&quot; becuase the motor doesn't get hot!
&gt; 
&gt;   I also wonder if it is time 
&gt; &gt; to replace the lifters.
&gt;      Waste of money.  CHANGE THE OIL REGULARLY

&gt;       YOU say nothing about how often you change the oil. THIs is the
&gt;       best thing you can do to fix and prevent this problem.
&gt; 
&gt;                 Change the motor OIL every 3,000 miles.
&gt;                       
&gt;       Last night I took a motor apart that had 4 oil changes in 80,000
&gt;       miles. We were fixing a gasket problem. After seeing the
&gt;       inside of the motor, we are now replacing the engine!
&gt; 
&gt;                 Change the motor OIl every 3,000 miles!!!!!
