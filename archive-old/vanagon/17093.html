&gt; could be a bad ignition switch, the circuit must still be closed in order
&gt; to run the starter. 

The solenoid could be sticking also, in which case it wouldn't matter 
whether the ignition switch was faulty or not.  The starter &quot;circuit&quot;
doesn't really include the ignition switch, since the starter is operated
remotely by a solenoid.  I would suspect the solenoid before the ignition.
