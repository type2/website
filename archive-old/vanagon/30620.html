&gt;	Besides disconnecting the battery before removing the brain box,
&gt;etc, I'd STRONGLY recomend getting a ground strap and conductive, grounded
&gt;workplace for this kind of thing. VWs are obviously more stoutly built,
&gt;but more than 10 Watts of radio (like Ham radio) from a vehicle mounted
&gt;antenna blows up Toyota engine management systems. A Ham friend of my
&gt;brother's blew-up his Camry wagon's control box and was denied
&gt;warranty coverage. A killer dose of static is easier to couple into
&gt;a brain box when its open than RF...
&gt;
Also, there's voltage present at the tip of the soldering iron (if I remember
correctly), so there's always the possibility of damaging sensitive
components that are normally static sensitive.  I haven't tested the tip of
my soldering iron personally, so don't know if this is true or not.
