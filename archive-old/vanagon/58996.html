I live in St. Louis Missouri and I'm luck to see one Vanagon a day.  =
I've never seen a double cab or singe cab here.  I've only seen and few =
Eurovans, maybe 10.  The most common is a water cooled Vanagon.  I drove =
to Boulder Colorado (in my 87 Wolfsburg) about a month ago and saw more =
VW's than I've ever seen in my life!  The coolest by far was a single =
cab split window w/ canvas top.  BTW I migh have a lead on some kind of =
VW double cab!  The guy I talked to said he thinks it's a vanagon but he =
really didn't know.  I'll let you all know how it turns out.
