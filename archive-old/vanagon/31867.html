So Erik Soule says:
&gt; Hi Kids,

Ahhh.... Even I get a thrill out of that...  ;)

&gt; It's been a real long time since I've contributed to the list.  Work has 
&gt; reduced me to one of those &quot;snivelling lurkers&quot; that Joel affectionately 
&gt; refers to every week.

I know the feeling.  *snivel*  ;)

&gt; 
&gt; 1.  We're dealing with a plain jane '87 Vanagon (ok, it's blue if you want 
&gt; to know).
&gt; 2.  The van won't start most (but not all) of the time.  It turns over 
&gt; fine, and really WANTS to catch, but it won't.
&gt; 3.  The problem occurs when the motor is cold or hot.
&gt; 4.  Usually he'll crank it for a few minutes, give up, and come back in 15 
&gt; minutes to try again, only for the van to fire up instantly!

Check the fuel pressure.  There's a 'T' fitting for it in the engine compartment.
I don't know what it's suppose to be for the later F.I.  28 psi for the early
F.I.  Could be the pump is dying or a new filter is needed.
