&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I got it back and figured now I could try out the propane fridge.  I
&gt;followed the direction carefully in both the owners manual and on the fridge
&gt;itself.  I couldn't get the pilot light to light (or at least the flame
&gt;gauge to show that it was lit).  The fridge seems to work when I plug it in
&gt;to the 110V.
&gt;
&gt;My questions are:
&gt;
&gt;1.  What do I have to do to get the pilot light to work?
&gt;
something you might look at is the wire that runs from the igniter switch
on the top panel down to the combustion chamber. My Dometic
(non-Westphalia) had a similar problem.
You only have to lift the stove up to check it. After it failed the 2nd
time I judiciously applied duct tape to lock the wire down to the top of
the fridge. Works fine now.

&gt;2.  It appears I need to take the fridge out to service it, so is there any
&gt;trick to getting it out or do I simply remove the obvious screws, LP gas
&gt;fitting, and unplug it and then slide it out?

If you do decide to take it out, let me know how hard it was. I'd like to
see where the condensate on mine is coming from and from looking
under/behind it I can tell it needs a good cleaning!

&gt;3.  Is there a good manual on these Dometic fridges?  I went to our library
&gt;I didn't have much luck.
&gt;
Mine's out in the Van, and it's late and cold out. If you can't find one, I
can at least give you the address, and at most make you a copy. You should
let me know the model number first though.
