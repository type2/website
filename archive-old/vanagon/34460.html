&gt;What is the best case sealing glue to use when mating the crankcase?  
&gt;Does Permatex make any? I heard something about Permatex gold, but I 
&gt;don't know if this is correct.
&gt;Thanks

I've had excellent results with Permatex Super 300 and the FEL-Pro Blue can
gasket dressing,(Rubber type adhesive).  I use thre Fel-Pro on transmission
flanges too.
