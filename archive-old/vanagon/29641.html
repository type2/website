hi everyone,
	well this turkey weekend my sweetness and i took a great trip.
however on our way back to portland we decided to stop at carson hot
springs for a soak.  on the way to the springs, the bus starts
back-firing a bit and lugging/losing power.  i noticed the windshield
wipers acting pretty slow earlier in the trip.  the gen light comes
on, and at the top of the final hill, good ole uky (the bus) shuts off
and takes a nap.  i can roll start it (since we are cruising down hill
now) but it goes out pretty quick.  we roll into a parking spot and go
soak. afterwards it is raining and dark so we make some sandwiches and
decide to camp there and work on the bus in the morning.  

in the morning things look ok, i tightened up the alternator belt (it 
was pretty loose) checked all the connections, get a jump and we are
on our way, figuring things should be fine.  the gen light never goes
out after starting and 15 minutes later the bus starts back-firing
and lugging, to a top speed of 5 MPH.  uky naps out again, we get a
jump, go to a gas station and charge the battery for two hours.  this
gives us enough juice to get home, bus running GREAT, cruising along,
not a problem.

however, i think the alternator or regulator is shot.  if you remove the
positive wire from the battery, engine dies right away.  tonight i
would like to check/test the alternator and regulator and replace them
tomorrow morning if need be.  HOW can i test these two things?  i have
a VOM, but am not sure how to test the alternator yet.  is it difficult
to replace these things, the regulator looks easy, but i don't know
about the alternator.  if i replace one, should i replace the other as
well (didn't someone say they go together like bread and butter?)?
how much should i be looking at to spend for these two items?
anything else i should test / replace / check while i am at this
chore?    

as always any advice is much appreciated.  thanks in advance, and i
hope every one had a great holiday!!!!!

take care,
	brandy
