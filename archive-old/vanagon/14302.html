Subject: RE: Rabbit/Jetta engine swap

&gt;Martin Schneider Designed Systems (MSDS) in their writeup 

I remember the one on P -&gt; Syncro, in an old EuroCar. They've done others? 
Likely gas engine bellhousing is same in 2WD/4WD, but I think I need a 
diesel bellhousing to fit a Wabbit engine in, or KEPs $320US adapter. tim s.

Anyone out there with a dead oilburner engine they are parting out, and cheap!?
