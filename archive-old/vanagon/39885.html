Subject: SAN DIEGO ANYONE? HELP?

                                           8:46 AM             4/16/96

Is anyone living in or near the San Diego area who could take a look at a 61
23 window for me?

Ii's apparently good mechanically, complete with very minor rust , a few body
dings etc.  

I would appreciate it if someone could help me out by having a look - if it's
as good as it sounds I'll buy it.  If you could help please email me and we'll
work out phone no.s etc.

Rob K
