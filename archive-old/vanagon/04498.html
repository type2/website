&gt; was in palo alto last week on the company and stopped at the

It's fun to watch the Cessnas there, too! :)

&gt; Saw a eurovan, two vangons, a loaf and an 'owl-face' (my version
&gt; of split) all packed into a little space. One of the bird watchig 
&gt; groups came up and drove off as i watched and didnt 'see' anything unusual

Seems pretty VW-crowded to me!

&gt; Here in upstate NY if you see an owl-face you honk and jump up and down
&gt; in surprise .....

They're not THAT common here! I jump up and down and honk if I see one. 
Yesterday at lunchtime, I was driving through the parking lot near Una
Mas! in Otto ('59 Single) and what do I see across the lot but a dark blue
or primer big-tailight split crewcab. I followed her all the way through
the lot and honked, but she didn't see me. I have the same question: 

&gt; wasnt anyone on the list was it ????? ;)
