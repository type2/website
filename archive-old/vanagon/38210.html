&gt; Just saw this in the paper:
&gt;
&gt; 1993 V.W Eurovan
&gt; 25000 mi, bad side damage
&gt; $1500 (907) 488 7863
&gt;
&gt; Thats all I know.  On the slight chance that someone is interested, I'll
&gt; look into it and shipping.

Judging from what I've seen for asking prices on wrecked, late model
vehicles around So Cal., My guess is that this EV must have been hit HARD,
and/or the engine/transaxle have already been removed.
