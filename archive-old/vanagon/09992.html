&gt;OK, I'll take a shot at this...

Bang.  (uhh Norman - ya got me)

&gt;PJ (or do you prefer Patrick?):

PJ (purleez).  (Patrick is only on my .sig since certain horny 
gimps started to believe that my use of initials meant that I 
was a 'girlie'.  Thankfully, they are not on this list, peopled 
as it is with charming, courteous, warm-hearted nice types.  
And me.  &lt;bleurgh&gt;   And anyway, how many bearded girlies do 
*you* know? &lt;hur hur hur&gt; )

&gt;OK, that said, I would begin your troubleshooting by 
&gt;removing the blades  from the wiper arm and looking at 
&gt;the assembly; what happens when you press  on the 
&gt;center of the blade?  Does it spring back with some 
&gt;energy, like it's  supposed to?  

Yes.  The wiper is nice and new and springy.  Actually, it's 
even springier since I re-shaped it to try and cure the 
problem.

&gt;I would suspect that 
&gt;you're getting some binding where the rubber blade 
&gt;slides by the little metal tabs that hold the rubber 
&gt;blade in  place.

Dunno.  The hint about bending the arm seems to have brought a 
modicum (nice word) of improvement.  It's going to be raining 
tomorrow and I'm going to Dublin so it will be a good test.  
Spent a while washing the blue thing thins afternoon, as it 
happens.  Have you any suggestions on how to prevent my paws 
from cracking up after exposure to cleaning chemicals?  Gloves, 
you say?  That's only for sissies.  *Real* men don't wear 
gloves.  :)

Ric, this proves that Norman needs help (and sooon.)   ;)

&gt;3) Your wiper motor's messed up; you need to buy a Ford 
&gt;Windstar ASAP!   :)

&gt;Good luck, guys, I hope you rectal-fy your wiper 
&gt;maladies!

That's a bum quote ...   :P

Rear wash/wipe extra.
