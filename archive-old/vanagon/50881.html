Subject: Re:vanagon stalling/propex heaters

Hi y'all !.. 2 subjects have recently been appearing on the list quite
frequently, and I thought I'd join in regarding same... First... A lot of
listmembers seem to be having the stalling/ lurching/poor running conditions
in their later model Vanagons 86-90 models.  I have an 89, and I'll relate my
problem, and remedy.    The van would always start quickly, and then idle
somewhat roughly with slight surges in rpm while sitting still.   As I drove
away, and vehicle starts to warm up with temp needle to middle, for the first
several miles, at each stop, it continued to idel somwhat rough as before,
and as I started from a stop, or slowed position,  the oil light lit,  the
engine started to stall, and I had to let off the gas, until it seemed the
engine was catching again; or I'd throw gear into nuetral (AUTOMATIC), and it
would allow me to rev up to higher rpms, whereupon I could throw into gear
and hope to keep moving!  After several miles of this,, it seemed to go away,
and normal driving.  However,  If I ever stalled completely,   It would
re-start sometimes right away, or sometimes not at all for 30  minutes.  I
had replaced the plugs, the rotor, dist. cap, C02 sensor, and had checked
timing alignment, flushed coolant, changed oil, you name it!   Well,  I had 2
last resorts,  (I had a new ECU put in last Summer and discounted this)... it
was my ig. coil, or my oil pump( tech bulletin said could cause valves to
hang open)... I checked ohms with multimeter against Benley's stats, and
found high resistance in one pair of contacts... I upgraded immediately as it
says in Bentley to the GREEN label ignition coil, and bang, NO MORE PROBLEMS!
 Couldn't believe it.  I'd checked everything, including archive discussions
of problem including engine to ground cable being broken,  02 sensors, etc.
you name it!  All I can say is that when dealing with electronic ignitions,
it can be anything in the loop!  By the way,, I'd already also checked the
throttle, and idle valves,  the idle stablizer valve ( I took it off and
hooked a big battery to it to see if it worked cause it didn't vibrate or hum
and suggested it would),  and it worked fine. .  I checked electric to
injectors.  I could and WOULD go on adinfinitum, except  CHECK THOSE OLD
IGNITION COILS FIRST!.

Now,  as for the Propex Heaters... I had written to Propex requesting infor,
and their regionla acccount manager sent back a letter saying that the
Compact 1600 heater is &quot;about to be susperseded by an all new propane blow
air heater-the Carver P4&quot; 
He included the phone (wats) and address of local company for info on new
heater.. herewith;  Ssure Marine Services, Inc., Seattle Wash.. phone
800-562-7797.. Hope this helps out on heaters and with all you folks out
there with irksome stalling and idle difficulties..
