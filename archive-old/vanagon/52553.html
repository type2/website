&gt;  who out there has converted the ol' non self adjusters to being so?
&gt;  
&gt;  imean, we have people putting t-3 irs into everything from ghias and 
&gt;  bugs, to buggys, so why not v-gon brakes in a loaf? hmm..:)
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; The parts will actually bolt into the 73 and up busses.  Personally, Although
&gt; I like the convienence, I do not like the design.  The self adjusters operate
&gt; at the top of the shoes with the cylinder.  The bottom of the shoes never get
&gt; used.  In order for this to work, the drums can not be oversized at all (only
&gt; 1 cut) and factory mettalic shoes ($$$) should be used for reasonable life.
&gt;  WHeel cylinders are the same except for a spring to push the pistons out.
&gt;  Many aftermarket repalcements leave out the springs for the late vans and
&gt; they still work.  Sometimes an extra pump will be needed to get a firm pedal.
