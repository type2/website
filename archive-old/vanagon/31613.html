Subject: EV Ventshades


A couple of people have mentioned wanting ventshades for their
EVs. My plan to get $$$ in advance perhaps is a bit undo-able, considering
I'm leaving for France on New Year's Eve....

So here's what I'm going to try to do...should funds (or AMEX) permit,
I'll try to get a couple of sets of ventshades for EVs...and then
when I get home, it will be first come first serve.

BTW, the University's computer system is going down for a 24hr maintanance
today at 4pm EST...until tomorrow at 3pm...so I will be off of here
until Saturday night...

If anyone wants to discuss ventshades, etc., call me at (508) 990-0907.
