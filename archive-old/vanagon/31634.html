Subject: 5-lug to american rims

&gt;
&gt;It is in a tire commercial.  Too bad 9 out of 10 Sears can't balance the
&gt;old five lug wheels.

        Speaking of balancing wheels...  I just got mine rotated and
balanced for free at America's Tire Co. They give you free rotate/balance
jobs every 6k, no  charge at all. While there, the guy doing the job
mentioned that when he was in AZ or NM hew saw adds for conversion pieces
that make the old 5-bolts into standard american bolt patterns. He said
they're just like metal plates, bolt it on, then bolt on the new rims.
Anybody seen/used these? Might be useful because of the widespread problem
with balancing the 5-lugs.

Peace,
