&lt;&lt; I have been experiencing something weird regarding the order the postings
 that arrive at my E-mail box.
 
 Two days ago I sent out a message to the list.  I received replies to it the
 next day, but my original post didn't return to my box until today.  I
 noticed this also on the post marked &quot;mpg?&quot;.  I got replies to it before I
 received the original text.  What is with this?  Just for the record I am
 sending this on 4/24, and I will let you know when it comes back to me.
