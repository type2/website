Hey Now!

I'm repairing a faulty electric lock motor.  Had a faulty yellow power
wire.  Locks now work great except they are out of synch.  They cycle up
down endlessly.  I figure that I've got the bigger white gear (inside
the motor) in the wrong position.  Does anyone which position the gear
needs to be in?  Do you line up some marks or something?

TIA!
