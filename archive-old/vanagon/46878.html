Subject: water wetter??

Hello everyone,

        While in Pep Boys the other day getting oil I noticed something
called Water Wetter. It claimed that it reduced engine temperatures by
increasing the the ability of the coolant to transfer heat from the engine.
It also said that it lubed the water pump and prevented corrosion. It was a
pink solution that appeared to be carbonated (I dropped it on the floor).
Has anyone ever heard of this stuff? A friend who is into corvettes says
that they sell this stuff in every aftermarket catalog and that he heard
that it does work.( heard from a friend who heard from this guy, who knows
someone who used it ;-) ) I wanted to know if anyone has first hand
experience with this stuff.

Also, my brake pedal appears to be getting lower to the floor. I checked
the fluid level in the res. and it was not moving. I did not see any fluid
on the calipers and I looked at as much of the brake line as possible. Is
there anywhere else to check? I recently changed my clutch master and slave
cylinders. Could there be air in the system? I bleed the clutch until I
thought it was air free (my first time so the probability of a mistake is
astronomical) Thanks for any info.

dave
