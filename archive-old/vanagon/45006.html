Subject: Fuel Pump Removal?

Hello all,

Im inquiring on how in the hell to remove my fuel pump. Ive read in 
St. Muir's guide and an older book Clymer that you must remove the 
whole freakin motor to take it out, but on the other hand Ive read in 
the Haynes Transporter book that its not neccesary. Which is true? Im 
still trying to conquer the mighty lack of power situation and 
thought Id check the pump. Any help would be tremendously appreciated.



Thanx.
Rich
