Subject: Q:  Rust in seams

I'm back from digest mode.  I found it too hard to respond and keep 
current.
Vanagon questions:

My 84 has the slight indication of rust in the seams along the 
drivers side.  How quickly does this progress?  I am thinking about 
trading up into a later model van, like a 89 or similar, but I have 
done so much mechanical on my 84 I don't want to take on another head 
job etc.  Should I worry about the rust, or is it a slowly progessing 
problem?  Any opinions welcome.

thanks.

brian.
