I am glad you get the same kind of reading as me with a Single port 1600 in a
70 westy. When it gets real hit (over 90) and I am on the freeway it always
runs just over 250.

   I'm in a '76 Westy and if the temp gets over 230, I'm lookin' for a shady
spot to rest for  a while... last year I took it down south to the beach, got
the oil light on AS I coasted into a parking space: zero oil! walked to the
market and bought several quarts. Runnin' a little hot that day, I guess... had
it brought closer to spec _at_ the mechanic, now it runs below 200 (knock wood)
and we're both happy...
