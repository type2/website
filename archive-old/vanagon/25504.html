Subject: Brake resevoir tube seals (71 bus)

Hi folks,

I remember a discussion about this a while back but I don't recall the
solutions.  I'm referring to the plastic tube that runs from the upper brake
resevoir down to the resevoir mounted on the master cylinder (I believe for
all bay window buses?).  At both ends of this tube is a cylindrical black
rubber seal.  These seem to degrade over time and leak.  The dealer no
longer offers replacements--what does everyone use?

And/or:

Any chemists out there know what types of synthetic rubber or substance one
could make a seal out of that would be suitable for use with brake fluid.

Thanks,

 
Ron
