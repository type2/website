Subject: Sniveling Unknown Lurker

Well, I guess it's time to come out of hiding.  My name is Brett 
Fairbanks and I reside in Delaware, Ohio.  Current VW's include a '72 
Sportsmobile and a '73 Thing.  I've been lurking on the list for about a 
month now and I have really enjoyed reading about air AND water cooled 
Transporters.  These vanagon folks even have me thinking of finding a 
nice Wasserboxer for a daily driver!  

Hats off to Ken for taking on the effort and expense of hosting our new 
mailing list.  Make mine air mail!
