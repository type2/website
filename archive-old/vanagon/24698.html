Subject: Re: Tragic yet comforting bus news 

&gt;  I'm not sure if I ever posted the story of my friend who found the
&gt;creampuff '84 westy automatic, with *12,000* original miles !!!!!!!!!!
&gt;For only $6,000 !!!!
&gt;anyway, horribly, he, his wife, and her parents were driving down the
&gt;highway, when their super-friendly huge rottweiler climbed into the
&gt;passenger seat. The dog knocked the van into reverse, which locked up
&gt;the rear end completely, and rolled the bus 3 times.
&gt;  Thank God, no one was hurt at all. He was the only one wearing a seat
&gt;belt even. Luckily as well, no other vehicles were involved.
&gt;So, on the bright side, score another super-safety point for vanagons...
&gt;:(
&gt;And of course the other moral is-don't drive an automatic!
&gt;:)

As the driver of an '85 automatic, i am wondering: could the transmission be
shifted into reverse without the button being pressed.  I always thought
that it could not be shifted higher than neutral without pressing the button

??
