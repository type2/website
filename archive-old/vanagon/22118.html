&gt; that while we are supposed to be getting a spot which is
&gt; phenonemally beautiful, rustic, unadulterated, that we probably
&gt; WON'T be getting the usual amenities such as:  showers, toilets,
&gt; AC, water, etc.  That means we need to truck a lot of stuff
&gt; in, and be prepared for being as self-sufficient and as self-
&gt; containted as possible.  If *I* can go w/o showers, I'm sure
&gt; the rest of you will manage....:)

Martha, martha, martha...if I remember correctly, you and
Scharzie were the only 2 to actually use the shower :) Prunehead
and I bathed in beer and magnesium, and Argo in tomato juice.

I will be leaving early on Friday morning, but it takes almost
4 hours to get to Ukiah, then Eureka is 3 more hours from there.
How far past Eureka is this place?

I shall plan on another breakfast, maybe eggs, biscuits/gravy,
bacon. Will Al be there this time? Anyone have a good recipe for
biscuits/gravy?

Argo is ready to go!
