Subject: Vanagon Stereo advice needed

Ack!  Help!

My 85 Westy was vandalized over the July, 4th weekend.  I managed to replace
almost everthing broken or taken.  I have some junk speakers and an old
am/fm/cassette player so I have some music to listen to for now (although it
sounds terrible).

I have about $700 to spend on a new stereo system.  I am looking at
purchasing a am/fm/cass, trunk-type mounting CD changer &amp; new speakers.  The
problem is I don't know much about channels, watts, etc... when it comes to
stereos.  

Is there someone that has experience with stereos in Vanagons that can coach
me with this little project?
