Subject: Re: '86 Headlight replacment?

If your reflectors are shot, then new bulbs and heavy wiring/relays won't
help much. There aren't any upgrades for the rectangular reflectors and
unfortunately replacements are quite costly. 

For about $200 you can retrofit to pre-86 round headlights and use Hella
reflectors and H4 bulbs. That's what I did on my '87 and the headlights are
much much better. See 1986 archives for details.

&gt;A short while back someone posted a report of the replacement of vanagon

&gt;headlights.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone replaced a '86 or newer vanagon's high/low headlights with a
&gt;better performing rectangular reflector/bulb combination?  My reflectors
&gt;are in bad shape because of moisture and some 80/100 watt bulbs that
&gt;exploded (But that's another story.).
&gt;
&gt;I checked the voltage on the high beams of the outer lamps at the bulb.  It
&gt;was 9.8 volts...
&gt;And this is with the inner high beam lights running on a separate relay.  I
&gt;guess relays all around are a next project.
