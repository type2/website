Subject: Alaskan Vultures!!

Vanagon gang, got this in my mailbox from the Inuvik Trip site, and thought
I'd pass it along, just in case anyone is living up North (or driving up
there anytime soon) is looking to sell.  Please follow up with Jerry, not
me.  Tobin

&gt;
&gt;If you know of any of the people who are doing the Arctic and coming
&gt;through Fairbanks who would like to sell a syncro and fly home, have them
&gt;contact me. I am looking for a late model one. Thanks.
