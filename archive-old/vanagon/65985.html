&gt; My collection of Microfiche date back 20 years.  So I should have what
&gt; your looking for.   I do have type 3, 4, Ghia and 181.  I also found
&gt; that the beetles are broken up into 2 films,  1200-1300= Standard
&gt; beetles and 1302- 1303= superbeetles.  The standard beetles do go back
&gt; into the 60's  I found a couple of pre '67 bus films but I think they
&gt; will stay with me.  However, I can be persuaded.   Take care.

I have access to them all and the boss is ok with me borrowing them for
use of copying. I have the early beetle, 61-67 type2, bay windows,
sheesh I even have quantum and rabbit diesel if you want.
I am going to try to copy some and will be willing to mail them out to
who wants them for the price of copies and stamps.
I'll check for a place to copy them and get back to everyone.
It might be a fun project to get them all scanned, but it will be a
bear.
Some of the ones I have acces to are really scratched.
