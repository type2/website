&gt;&gt;got
&gt;60k miles only. I am trying to determine if I should seek VWoA to &gt;pay the
&gt;(majority) cost to fix it.
 VWoA should pay for some of the repair cost, although I don't think they
will tell you how much until the work has been done (especially on such an
old car).
They may say that the car is too old.
It's definitelt worth a try.
