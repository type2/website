&gt; Two weeks ago I put in 15-50 Mobil One synthetic.  I haven't been on
&gt; any long drives yet, but yesterday driving up a grade I got the temp
&gt;

&gt; 
The day I put synthetic in my Bus will be a cold day in hell,
it already leaks oil enough, as to temp I will share my Corrado
experience, befor sysnthetic (Mobil-1) 220 most of the time, after
220 most of the time.  Mileage before, 25-27 after 25-27, I have
seen no benefit whatsoever and merely hope that I am reducing
wear and prolonging engine life but as the tto the other wonder
synthetic claims, BS IMHO.  I do feel better for the Corrado though
as I am only going to change at VW interval, no ridiculous 3000
milers for me and like the idea of the synthetic for the regular
change interval, typically I change in fall and spring with
appropriate grade changes.  I also note it was the concensus of
the Corrado list that going synthetic is a sure way for oil leaks
to spring up everywhere, particularly, valve cover and oil pan
gaskets, this has been nearly all of the lists experience, as to
a reason, who knows?

'71 Westy Virginia (I liked the idea, thanks) '90 Corrado G60 (does
anyone name modern VW's? seems too odd an idea as they are almost
normal cars, maybe I'd name a EV if I ever own one)
