Subject: Re: Valve Propane Tank



&gt;OK.... I have to have at least a new fill valve on my '85 camper.  Is 
&gt;this a part that is available at any gas bottle supplier or is it one of 
&gt;those dreaded OEM things?  

I had a local propane place install a generic valve on my '85 tank, for 
about $20 installed, as I recall.
