Subject: Ackworth, Tires, and Oil


Joel Walker wrote that he couldn't find Ackworth, Iowa on the map.
Any truly good map should have Ackworth--it's the smallest inorpor-
ated town in Iowa, for God's sake.  68 people!  And we're conveniently
located on Hiway 92 between Indianola and Pleasantville.  Besides, there
a 2 functioning Busses in Ackworth (mine) which must give it an amazingly
high Bus to people ratio. :)

Now on to serious stuff.  I blew a tire on the '79 and have decided to
replace all 4, as they suck (Kelly-Springfield Star tires--don't buy them)
Do I recall that during the tire thread a month or two back people really
hated Continental tires on their Busses &amp; Vanagons?  (I'm thinking either
Michelin or Continental 185 SR 14's.  Continentals are  $8 cheaper each.)

Oil.  The garage mechanics where I take the Bus when I don't have time
to fix/maintain it myself (more frequent than I'd like...) are berating
me for running 20-50 year 'round.  (Actually, they berate me for using
it at all...)  The VW manual suggests 10-30 or even just 10 for subzero
F. temps, and we have a fair number of those during winter.  Would me
busses be happier with 10-30 winter &amp; 20-50 summer?  Expiring minds want
to know!

Thanks all.  Great work on the TGIF follies!
