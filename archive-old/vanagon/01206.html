&gt;so along in 1980, VW brings out the third generation body style, still
&gt;officially known as a Transporter, but sells it with seats as a Vanagon.
&gt;but it turns out that Vanagon is a U.S.-only name! it was sold in Canada and
                                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Wrong.  The Canadian version has always been a Vanagon.
  
&gt;the rest of the world as a Caravelle (they couldn't call it that in the u.s.
&gt;cause dodge already had that name).
&gt;
&gt;likewise, when the 4th generation came out, still officially known as a
&gt;Transporter, it was sold in the u.s. as a Eurovan, but in the rest of the
&gt;world as a Caravelle.
            ^^^^^^^^^ Once again, the Canadian version is the Eurovan as well.
&gt;
&gt;now, the Vanagon/Caravelle and the Eurovan/Caravelle are only the ones with
&gt;seats and windows ... all the others (no windows, no interior) are just
&gt;trucks and are still called Transporters, no matter which generation they are.
&gt;
&gt;ok. so what about the Campers?  well, somewhere back in the 50's, a little
&gt;company named Westfalia-Werke (Franz Knoebel &amp; Sons) who used to make custom
&gt;horse-drawn carriages, got hold of some VW transporters and converted them
&gt;into little houses-on-wheels. the name Camper got stuck on it by VW (i think)
                                        ^^^^^^ nowhere in my VW docs does
the name Camper appear.  It is a Westfalia.  Mine is named by Volkswagen as:
Vanagon Westfalia L.  The L means that there is a fridge and stove (an
option in the Westfalia in 1980).  I think 'camper' is a generic term.  Of
course I can only speak for 1980 models.  In Canada there were no GL's in
1980.  Also, only four
colours were offered: ivory, banana yellow, blue, and brown.

&gt;and has continued to this day. Westfalia is the name of the company who
&gt;modified the interior and put the pop-up top on. so, as far as the VW camper
&gt;that was sold at most u.s. dealers, a Camper and a Westfalia are the same
&gt;thing.
&gt;
&gt;well ... there are exceptions to that in other parts of the world. Westfalia
&gt;was NOT the only company doing this. Dehler is one german company that comes
&gt;to mind; Devon is/was a company in Britain; Dormobile also made conversions
&gt;and their pop-tops were hinged on the side (not the front or back). there
&gt;were/are also several other companies in the u.s that made conversions.
&gt;Country Home Campers still makes conversions of Vanagons. Adventurewagen was
&gt;another company. most of the u.s. companies have long since gone out of
&gt;business or changed over to converting u.s. dodge/ford/chevy vans.  
&gt;
&gt;and for 1995, it seems that there will be yet another change in the terminology
&gt;for the campers: the u.s. company, Winnebago, will be making two versions of
&gt;the Eurovan for sale: one, sold by Winnebago dealers and called the Rialta,
&gt;and the other, sold by VW dealers, and called the ??? Camper?
