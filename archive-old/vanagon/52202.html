Subject: Gene Berg Shift Kit

 &gt;&gt; Gene Berg sells a short-shift kit for the vanagon. $20. WELL worth the
money! i've had it now on three buses and love it. but be SURE to follow the
directions about marking the position of the base plate BEFORE you start
loosening it!! :) last time, i figured i was too smart to need to do that ...
took me two weeks to &quot;adjust&quot; it back to where it should have been. :( &lt;&lt;

 Joel:

 Just finished installing the kit and it works great!  I marked the washer
locations with a small felt tip pen like you recommended - made adjustment
easy.

 A couple of comments for those thinking about installing a Gene Berg short
shift kit in their Vanagon:

 Measure your shifter before you order.  The shaft is 12 or 14mm and the
people at Berg will need to know which one you have to complete the order.

 Read the instructions thoroughly, beginning to end, before you do anything. 
Don't look for the &quot;included&quot; Loctite mentioned, there isn't any.  Buy your
own tube. Gather up your 10 and 13mm wrenches, the drill motor and a couple of
rags.

 If the sleeve won't slide easily over the bend in the shaft, DON'T BEAT ON IT
WITH A HAMMER, like I did.  You will need that sleeve, preferably unblemished,
later.  The shifter is bent just a little too much for that sleeve to pass
easily.

 Other than that, it's an easy job.

 Happy Motoring!
