&gt;2. CONSOLE Am planning on removing plastic shroud around dash under
&gt;middle section behind stick shift and bolt a tray there for the &gt;ubiquitous coffee cup/console use. See any objections (besides &gt;clearance, etc.)?

I thought that shroud also served as an air-duct! Go carefully here.
Search the archives on cup-holders, and you'll get led to copies
of the OEM unit, which is nice and sturdy, the factory installed
them -up front- on the sides of the right wheel wheel, in the 
aisle area. This worked great for us.

&gt;4. WATER TANK There is a small black plastic key which has the teeth
&gt;broken off, and I cannot open the water tank. Would I be damageing &gt;anything if I were to remove the faceplate (hinged and locked) by &gt;removing the screws?

I don't even *have* the key, but have used a paper clip, straightened
out with a vaguely 1/4&quot; 90 degree bend at the end. Insert the
bend in the lock, and just turn the wire. Works every time, for me.

Good luck,

Tom F.
