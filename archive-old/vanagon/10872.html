Subject: VW-1600 '71 BUS-GAUGES FOR THE EXTRA SLOT

Recently, someone asked about the blank gauge hole on his/her Bus next to
the speedo.  The same thing has bugged me for years as I don't need a
clock (I'm going to be late anyway) and I certainly don't need a tach
(there's only four relevant RPM points on my Bus: off, lugging, racing out
of control, or running just fine).  What I've always wanted was a combo
oil temperature/oil pressure gauge to fit the hole.  I've looked in VW
magazines aplenty but I haven't seen any like this.  Does one exist?

Thanx,

Nick
