Subject: Suburu engine transplants

 As a new owner of a 1987 watercooled Vanagon with a bad engine I wonder if
anyone out there in the VW Bus World has any experience or information
concerning tranplanting a 2700cc six cylinder Suburu engine into a vehical of
this type. Any info would be appreciated.
