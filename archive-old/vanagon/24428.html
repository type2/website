Subject: Sad Friday, Westy Blown Away :(


Last night a storm blew through Austin.  One third of the city lost 
power.  I came home from working on my engine at a friend's house and 
found that the wind had taken the poptop clear off my '68 Westy.  I had 
planned to fix the engine so I could take the bus to Ennis for the show 
on the 24th (not to show the bus, before the storm it would be termed 
&quot;rough, unrestored&quot;, now it's &quot;very rough, not driveable&quot;).  Part of the 
frame is twisted and the wooden parts are mostly broken.  The tent was 
ripped before but is now in shreds.  I'll have to take a close look at 
the fiberglass.  When I looked at it last night it was still in one 
piece.  The recent posts on fiberglass and gel coat will help, I'm sure.  
I had planned on fixing up the fiberglass anyway but this is much more 
than I'd planned.  Anyway, I'm not giving up.

                                 Thanks for listening,

                                    Martin.
