Subject: Bus trip Vancouver to Artic Ocean

Has anyone found the web site out there that is talking about a trip in the Summer of 1996 from Vancouver north to the Artic Ocean in Canada?
I was looking around the other night and found it but now cannot find it again, I did'nt write down the address.
Any help would be appreciated.
