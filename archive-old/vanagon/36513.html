Subject: Re: '78 Westy vs '88 Westy ?

&gt;I now have a tough decision to make between two nice Westies (or 
&gt;maybe neither):
&gt;
&gt;1&gt; a '78 with 37K on rebuilt engine, 137K total. New paint, interior 
&gt;original and complete but in poor to fair shape. Paint job of average 
&gt;quality only (ie: poptop painted, but failed to remove seal first...)
&gt;Will need: 4 new tires, poptop seal right away. Canvas, brakes and 
&gt;shocks will need attention soon.
&gt;Calif. bus, so no major rust (or *very* good body work to hide it)
&gt;Drives well, clutch feels good, throttle &amp; trans linkage good. 
&gt;Steering feels tight, but shocks may be gone, as it dips &amp; leans a 
&gt;lot. 3rd owner, but has all receipts.
&gt;Asking price $5800 CDN, may get it for $5000-5500
&gt;Add in $500-1000 for new parts needed = $5500-6500 CDN
&gt;
&gt;2&gt; an '88 with 320K total, 160K on new engine, trans &amp; driveshafts. 
&gt;One owner, all receipts. Looks immaculate, new tires, new paint on 
&gt;front section.
&gt;Have not driven yet, so can't say much more.
&gt;Needs new poptop seal.
&gt;Asking $9995 on dealer lot, would offer maybe $8000 if it checks 
&gt;out ok.
&gt;Total price, maybe $8000-8500 incl new parts needed.
&gt;
&gt;So, my questions are:
&gt;1. I like the '78, but I'm having a hard time believing it's worth 
&gt;only ~$3000 less than one 10 years newer. Does this seem a bit high 
&gt;for a '78?
&gt;
&gt;2. I would buy the '88 mainly to get more space, a 3 way fridge, and 
&gt;better hwy driving. My thinking is that when the heads/gaskets go, I 
&gt;would spend the $2000+ on a conversion to a Jetta 4cyl engine, either 
&gt;gas or turbo diesel, instead of putting more money into a poor engine 
&gt;design. Is this sound logic? How hard is it to find the engine 
&gt;mounts, tranny, etc from a diesel van to complete this conversion? My 
&gt;thinking is that $1000 will buy a very good used or rebuilt 4cyl engine,
leaving 
&gt;another $1000 to complete the conversion.
&gt;(I know the above topic's been discussed a lot, I'm just wondering 
&gt;how feasible the idea is without going into the details.)
&gt;
&gt;TIA.
&gt;
&gt;Shawn.

Shawn,

Sounds like a lot of money for the '78 (what's the exchange rate, U.S. to
Canadian?).  However, '78 is regarded by many as the best year for
late-model buses (i.e., Baywindows).  It has hydraulic lifters, which means
never having to adjust the valves.  It's also got fuel injection, but so
does the '88.

The '88 has a lot of mileage (or kilometerage).  If you think late-model
buses ('72-'79) are expensive to rebuild, get a quote for a new ANYTHING for
an '88, especially a motor or tranny rebuild.  I don't know much about
transplanting a Jetta, Scirocco or whatever engine into it.  These
conversions can be really time-consuming.

Rust is a very important consideration.  Check the '78 really carefully,
especially the rocker panels along the side, front floorboard, wheel wells
and under the window seals.

Who rebuilt the engine?  Any warranty left?  How's the compression?
(Definitely run a compression test.)  How's the front end (e.g., steering
box, wheel bearings, ball joints, tie rods and ends)?  Bring up any
deficiencies of the bus; make the owner an offer considerably lower than the
asking price and dicker from there.
