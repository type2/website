Subject: '72 bus CVs, rear bearings, and torsion bars?




Hi all,

Well, I'm planning to disassemble parts of the rear end of my '72 bus
so that I can, at the very least, regrease the CV joints.  There is a
knocking back there that I hear when I drive over little bumps in the
road that I'm thinking might be a CV joint problem.  Also the CV boots
are tearing a little where they are clamped to the axles so I want
to replace all the boots.

Reading the pertinent sections of Bentley and Haynes (haven't gotten to
Muir yet) I see other things that might be the problem and/or might need
servicing while I've got things apart.  Things like the wheel bearings
and the rubber bushings under the spring plates.  How hard is it to replace
the rear wheel bearings assuming I have removed the axle assembly from
the car?  Will I need a hydraulic press?  Can I use a three arm puller
or just drift the races out with a proper sized socket?  And the torsion
bar bushings, how can I tell if these need replacement?  What is the
symptom of bad torsion bar/spring plate bushings?

I hope some of you have had some experience with these things.  I will
attempt to produce a detailed report of my experience when I am done,
perhaps even with scanned in photographs on the WWW.

Thanks for any help in advance!
