&gt;=========================================
&gt;C. MANUAL TRANSMISSION ( Syncro, All Wheel Drive):
&gt;1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  NEVER! (Unless I suppose
&gt;you've disassembled part of the drive train to prevent problems!)
&gt;2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground: NEVER! (Unless I suppose
&gt;you've disassembled part of the drive train to prevent problems!)
&gt;3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van for unlimited speed
&gt;for unlimited distance. 
&gt;
&gt;==========================================
&gt;
&gt;So it appears that either all four wheels ON the ground or all four wheels
&gt;OFF are both acceptable towing solutions.  A while back I had to tow my
&gt;Syncro about 60 miles &amp; elected to use a friend and a tow bar to tow the van
&gt;on the ground.  The cost of a tow-truck tow was much too high!

     Your right Jim did'nt read all the way to last line of Bentley.

&gt;Scarry!!  I've had a big hunk of plate steel fly through my windshield at eye
&gt;level once.  It took the rear-view mirror with it to come to rest above the
&gt;back seat after missing my face by about 3&quot;.  Gives me the &quot;willies&quot; just to
&gt;think about it.  What if I'd been driving just abother few inches to the
&gt;right?  What if you windshield had been just a little weaker?

Wooa!!  Talk about lucky.  Since the rock misshap I try to stay clear of
large trucks.  Especialy the ones carring gravel or junk.

&gt;Did the tow truck driver's knuckles drag the ground.  It's so comforting to
&gt;know who you have to put your trust in sometimes.

Did'nt notice his arms, although his forhead did seem somewhat large.

&gt;
&gt;How did you get a Syncro that's only 86&quot; (inches)?  Everyone elses is 179.9&quot;
&gt;long
..
Should have been 86' 

&gt;By the way, what year is your Syncro?  Mine is an '87.   :)

My Syncro is an 1986 GL bronze exterior and tan and brown interior.  It is
equiped with a locking rear diff.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
