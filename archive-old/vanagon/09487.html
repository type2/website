Subject: Re: silver socket and collapsible spare tire

David, my camper is a VW Westfalia.  I was just at Big Sur with John Hugenard, who has the same year, also a Westfalia
conversion, but a slightly different model, and he has the silver socket, but I do not.  I
assume we're talking about the thing to the right of the
steering column, inbetween it and the climate controls, right?
