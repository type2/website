Subject: Re: Replacement speakers for '87 Vanagon

Sami,

I replaced my front speakers with Boston Acoustic....   The grills are square 
(as opposed to the stock round grills) and you will be able to see an 
indentation in the upholstery from the stock grills for about a month, but that 
should go away after a few warm days.  BA has a few other arrangements that me 
be favorable to our needs so check them out at one of your local (reputable) 
stereo shops...

&gt;Can anyone recommend a good replacement speaker for the front and back
&gt;factory installed Blaupunkt stereo speakers? I recently installed a new
&gt;Clarion tape deck, but the sound is very tinny, I think because of the
&gt;speakers. Also, the front speakers need to be flush mounted because of
&gt;the window crank being so close, so that limits your options.

I know nothing about speakers, but I am contemplating adding a
non-directional sub to improve the bass response. Do you think something
like that would solve *your* problem?
