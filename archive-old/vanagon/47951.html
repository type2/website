Subject: Re: (headsup) wasserboxer cooling system failure dujour

I figured I couldn't be the only one ..

It's scary.  I just got back from a long drive, Raleigh to Atlanta
and back.  The damn thing could of come apart at any time. 
I &quot;fixed&quot; it by grinding the surface flush then slitting a piece of big 
radiator hose and wrapping the tube.  This and two hose clamps plus
a plug in the heater hose got me back on the road.  

I assume this thing is expensive.  So between now and late fall I need 
to fugure out if I'm going to replace it or find another way/place
to junction in the heater hose.  I'm leaning toward buying a piece 
of steel pipe, taping in a 1/4&quot; nipple and putting the pipe inline 
with the big hose on the bottom of the unit.  Probably easier than 
replacing the dist. unit and a whole lot cheaper.

 &gt;Yes, the distribution unit that you mentioned does seem a little frail.  
 &gt;Mine did exactly the same as yours and broke off at the heater 
 &gt;connection.
 &gt;
 &gt;The thing was a real pig to change also. Those one of a kind pipe clamps 
 &gt;would not move easily.  Ended up breaking some of the other junctions 
 &gt;off the unit in order to remove the pipes from the unit itself!
 &gt;
 &gt;You made a good point to KEEP AN EYE ON THIS PUPPY, it would leave the 
 &gt;car in a dire hole if it were out in the middle of no where!!!!
 &gt;
