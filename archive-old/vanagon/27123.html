Actually, I think adding sex to this would be a mistake.   It would dilute the 
strength of the metaphor: the struggle of the common man to overcome the worst 
the modern over-mechanized world can throw at him.  Never giving up, our hero 
manages to succeed inspite of all obstacles.

If I can work in &quot;post-capitalist deconstruction&quot; I think I can get a PhD out 
of it....
