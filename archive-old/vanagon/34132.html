And yet another...

Dr. Death left another body behind in another VW bus; don't know
what year, didn't see a picture. Don't know if it was the same bus
as last time or a different one.


In the current Highlander episode ... SPOILERS




The oldest immortal on the show, Methos - somewhere near 5000
years old or so, and a lady friend drive off in a 68-71 Westy;
to drive all over Europe. Goes to show that many years of 
experience will lead one to choose the correct transportation :)
