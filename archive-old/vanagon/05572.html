&gt;One example of a &quot;good neighborhood&quot; that doesn't have individually perturb-
&gt;able property owners is a college or university campus.  You may need guidance
&gt;from an Internet contact or a passerby as to where students park their cars
&gt;overnight, but once you find that area you'll typically get better security
&gt;patroling than surrounding areas do, without being in an all-night-traffic
&gt;situation.  

I have done that twice but with security uptight about it.  The first time
was when I arrived a day before dorms opened and could not get a hotel room.
I decided to sleep in the commuter lot but was told to leave when they saw
me.  Ended up sleeping at a mall parking lot.

The second time at another school security would go through the lots
with spot lights and flashlights looking for any strange activity.  I was
asleep on the foldout bed and with tinted windows they did not see me
eventhough they looked in.
