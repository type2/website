&gt;I am particularly looking forward to the in-dash, four-wheel
&gt;constant-monitor tire-pressure gauges.  I forgot....might
&gt;need five of those!

Depending on the year, you might need a sixth for the windshield washer
fluid container (my '69 bus had one with a Schrader tire valve stem on
it)!     :^)
