Hey all,
Since I go to the same school as Erik, I also must leave.  I'm leaving
later today and will be unsubbing then but I'll be around for a couple
more hours so if anyone wants to e-mail me, better do it now.

I will have access to a computer and the list this summer and I can be
reached at 76065.3075_at_compuserve_dot_com, which is my mom's account.

Thanks to everyone for all their help and anything else since I've been
here, it's a great list.

Take care everybody,
Sean
