Subject: Rubber elbow connecting filler neck and gas tank on 77

Well the used rubber elbow I put in a few months back is cracked enough now that it 
needs to be replaced.  The problem is that nobody seems to make this thing.  It's a 
2.25&quot; inside diameter fuel hose that's about 5&quot; long with a slight bend in the 
middle.  Now the dealer says they can order it from Germany for about $150CDN and it 
will take six weeks.

Every used one we've been able to get our hands on has cracks already forming in it.  
So this part must be in fairly high demand if they all form leaks.

Has anyone gotten a new one of these from some aftermarket dealer?  If someone can 
point me in the right direction by early afternoon (PST) tomorrow then I'll try and 
get one and hold off putting the tank back in for another day or two.  Otherwise 
we'll just use a straight piece (which is maybe what everyone else does) and hope the 
pressure of bending it doesn't cause problems.

We tried BusBoys today and they had the rubber boot at the top of the filler neck 
(that part going to The Bug Shop in Vancouver is for me by the way Jim) but not this 
elbow.  California Imports also doesn't know of anywhere that we can get it from.

Any help would be appreciated.
