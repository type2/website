Subject: My bus is leaning!

The left (left is left :) ) side of my bus is about 1&quot;
lower than the right side.  It's worse in the back. Either I never noticed
it before, (seems unlikely) or it just happened.  I did
carry a relatively heavy load the other day (we just
moved, and man am I glad to have a bus).

Any ideas on what causes &quot;leaning&quot; or what I can do?

Thanks a lot. . . . .
