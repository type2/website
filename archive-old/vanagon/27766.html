Subject: How 'bout a newsgroup...

Hi all! New to this group (but not to internet or VWs).

I subscribed to this newsletter/list yesterday, and when I signed on last
night, I found 77 messages in my mailbox! The Vanagon folks are quite
prolific!

The reason for this message is to inquire whether the group has considered
the possibility of using a Vanagon newsgroup /in addition to/rather than/
the mail list. The advantage of a newsgroup is, mainly, that one can pick
and choose which messages to peruse. Now that most sevice providers are
providing access to newsgroups, nearly everyone would be able to reach
&quot;rec.autos.makers.vw.vanagon&quot; :)

What say the rolling public? (I'm sure I'm not the only one to have
suggested this; just the most recent).

Enjoy,
Dave

'88 Vanagon (We have an agreement: she owns it, I maintain it, we enjoy it)
