Whoops, sorry about the empty post...

I replaced my dual-diaphragm vacuum advance distributor in my 73 with
an all-mechanical advance (009) model.  Part-throttle driveability
was not very good, and I have since gone back to the stock distributor.
Another VW book gives the advice, &quot;Don't second guess the VW engineers&quot;,
and in this case I think it applies.
