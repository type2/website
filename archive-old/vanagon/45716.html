Brandy: Congrats. Enjoy it while he doesn't move under his own power.
       About 1.5-2.5 years from now, you'll be getting way more
      help than you want;-)

&gt;	A new subscriber to the list, River Psmythe!!!  Last saturday
&gt;evening Amelia pushed a beautiful baby boy out into my waiting hands.
&gt;He's already had a ride in the bus (slept the whole way, feeling safe
&gt;and secure in there of course), and I went over the procedure for
&gt;changing the rear brake shoes with him yesterday, just before I did
&gt;it.  He seemed pretty excited to be hanging out in the garage with
&gt;poppa:)  Amelia and I couldn't be happier!
&gt;
&gt;take care all,
