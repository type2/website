Subject: alternator brushes
 
I took it to a local place that rebuilds them and they tried swapping
out the regulator without any luck.  They did say that the brushes were
extremely worn but they didn't have any of the right ones that they
could put into it.  Now my alternator is back at home without a dime
being spent on it yet.
So, where's the best/cheapest place to find the brushes?  
Thanks all,                            Tonya

Hi Tonya.
When experiencing alternator problems on my '89 Syncro, I discovered that the
only problem was the commutator was corroded, so the brushes were not making
good contact.  A little bit of Emery cloth fixed that.  Spin alternator by
hand, and hold cloth lightly against commutator.

Well, OK, you asked about Brushes/Regulators.  I discovered that they are
available at NAPA.  But NAPA seemed to not know that most VW Regulator sets
seemed to look the same.  They list some vehicles, and not others, even though
it looks like the Regulator looked the same to me.  (I was comparing between
my '87 GTI, the wifes '86 Scirocco, and a Regulator from a motor from a '90
Vanagon)

So maybe if you find a NAPA store, with a knowledgeable salesman who kan use
his head???  Also try Rossi/Big Wheel.  They had Regulators as well.

UMMMM, now that I think of it, aren't the brushes integral to the
Regulator????  If swapping out the regulator did no good, check my comment
above about the commutator.  The circumstances of my case were that the
vehicle had sat for quite awhile without being run.  A glaze had built up on
the commutator.  It was not obvious that the commutator was glazed, but the
emery cloth did the trick.
