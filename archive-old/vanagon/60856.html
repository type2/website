Subject: new Microbus ?

&gt;&gt; I'll take mine with syncro and TDI&lt;&lt;

in your reply to my &quot;brave new world&quot; thoughts you mentioned a &quot;new microbus&quot; 
in connection with the &quot;new Beetle&quot;. This morning while queueing at the Audi 
shop I glanced through a late issue of &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; the german VW mag.

They presented a design study called Concept 2 with lots of remenisences to 
the T1 Microbus. Was that the one you were talking about ?

The article said it had been drawn by an englishman and was published also in 
&quot;VW Speed&quot;.

As soon as I have my scanner fixed again I will send a sample.

Bye Tom N.

PS. Anybody on the list who knows details about that Concept 2 ?
