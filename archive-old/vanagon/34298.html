Subject: Quality of Whitney parts
Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 09:36:41 -0600 (CST)

Someone once mentioned that they might be working on a list of parts 
that are reported to be good from JCWhitney.  I haven't seen it.  Some
have had bad luck with their door seals.  Others got seals that said 
WCM.  I know some of you order brake parts, seals, bearings, etc with 
regularity.  My problem is that I don't always know exactly what I am 
doing.  I mostly order from RMMW and pay a little to a lot more but 
know that they will send me a quality part that fits.  I would like 
see some positive and negative recommendations about what can safely 
be ordered from JCW and what cannot.  I need to save money where I can
and I still have a lot of brake and suspension parts between me and a 
run to Baja.  Jim
