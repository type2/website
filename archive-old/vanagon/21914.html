Subject: Oversize Tires for Syncro Westies


     I recieved several direct responses to my post regarding oversize
     tires and how the fifth one might - or might not - fit in the spare
     tire well. There were also some questions from others, so I
     put all the pieces together  so that someone with similar questions
     can find the answers (or opinions) on the list or in the archives.

     Thanks to Derek, Joel, Harry, Paul and Tim, from whom the following is
     cut, pasted and deduced:

     What: Upgrade Syncro to LT 27x8.5x14 tires. In my case, I am going for
     BF Goodrich AT (AT=All Terrain, I believe). Other tread patterns and
     other manufacturers also available, but my first choice,
     Goodyear AT-S Wranglers are not available in this (slightly oddball)
     size. LT is for Light Truck, with heavier sidewalls, higher weight
     capacity, and running at higher pressures.

     Why: This will increase ground clearance by 1&quot; but you will have worse
     acceleration. Be clear on whether you prefer ground clearance or
     acceleration. VW calculates that you lose 10% acceleration power with
     this larger tire. Heavier sidewalls improve ride. But the tire turns
     the Vanagon Syncro into a sleeper--a killer off road vehicle though
     you wouldn't know it from looking at it.

     Where:
     (1) Only on the factory alloy wheels, these will not fit the
     narrower steel wheels that came stock on many Syncros.
     (2)  The spare BF Goodrich 27 x 8.50 14 tire fits in the spare spot,
     but with grunting effort. Seat the tire slightly toward the passenger
     side or it will hit the steering shaft under there.
