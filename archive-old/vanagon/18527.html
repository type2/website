Vanagon at Altitude: No Problem. I lived at sea level and took
weekend trips to 8000'. Now I live at 8000', and take it over
10,000' passes. It runs fine. Of course it is underpowered and I
am constantly shifting gears when going up long inclines. The fan
comes on too..just like it is supposed to.

&gt;
&gt;Hi all,
&gt;I've been poking around in David Schwarze's Web Site, down loading various
&gt;pictures and stuff (Making myself envious of the various west coast van 
&gt;trips).  Any way, I grabbed a bunch of pictures, and the first 
&gt;Martha_stuck.mpg.
&gt;The pictures all turned out well on my gif/jpg viewer, but the mpg was
&gt;impossible to watch, jumping and thrashing all about.  It was my first
&gt;time using the mpg viewer, so I don't know if it is my software or the
&gt;file. (or if it got corrupted in downloading).  Has anybody else had
&gt;any trouble with this file?  Has anybody else downloaded it?
&gt;
&gt;Gerry, If this is the wrong place to ask these questions, sorry, please
&gt;don't boot me off.  :)
&gt;
&gt;Schwarzie, has anybody else mentioned problems with the mpeg?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all.

&gt;
&gt;I just got my '80 Westy this past winter, so over the past month or so I've 
&gt;been doing my first camping with it.  I love it!  Former owner threw in a 
&gt;Westy tent in the sale - he said it was in demand and worth $.  I thought 
&gt;&quot;yea, sure&quot; - little did I know.  This thing is great!  It looks like new 
&gt;(hangs from heavy metal frame with orange, blue &amp; white striped door) and it 
&gt;doubles the usable enclosed space.  Anyone who camps should beg, borrow or 
&gt;steal on these things... but you can't have mine :-)  
&gt;
&gt;The only problem I had was attaching the tent to the raingutter.  This was 
&gt;QUITE a chore.  Was I doing it wrong?  I attached after setting up tent - 
&gt;should I have attached this first?  Is there a trick to this or is it always 
&gt;a bear?  Maybe the rubber strip was just stiff from not using it.  Anyway, 
&gt;any advise appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;BTW - On a sadder note, I've noticed some fluid stains on the floor under 
&gt;the pedals.  Looks like my clutch master cylinder is leaking.  Clutch still 
&gt;works but it looks like I'm gonna have to replace it.  Oh well, these small 
&gt;things are worth it - I LOVE THIS BABY!!

&gt;Dan,
&gt;
&gt;The two times I've needed my tank filled (it seems to last forever), I
&gt;took the camper to RV dealerships. They know how to use the 80% valve
&gt;and what to leave open for bleeding. I just stand back and watch. They
&gt;don't charge very much to do it. Would this be a possibility for you?

&gt;I've got one on order and wanted to know if there's anything special
&gt;to watch out for when replacing one. Since it will arrive one day
&gt;before I leave for vacation, the odds of my destroying something

&gt;
&gt;Please provide some details on this tent. Is this basically an awning? Is
&gt;it OEM? Where can we get one?
&gt;
&gt;Last Friday, I installed an oil cooler thermostat in the 82 Westy and also
&gt;switched to 15W50 synthetic... This is what I have to report so far:
&gt;a) engine head temp 350 C (this is not changed); oil pressure at startup:
&gt;70psi - cold;  45 psi at 3000 rpm  with oil temp at 180 F. The oil temp
&gt;sender is located in the sump but the thermostat (and oil fan switch) are
&gt;down stream. Since the fan is designed to come on at 180 but has not yet
&gt;come on it seems that the oil in the sump is much hotter than the oil that
&gt;flows
&gt;by the switch. I guess this is a good thing because  it means the oil
&gt;flowing into the engine is  actually cooler that what is registered by the
&gt;gauge... I hope this makes sense...having the sensor located in sump
&gt;might not be a bad idea - this is where the oil is likely to be the hottest..
&gt;
&gt;Two other items of note: synthetic sheds its heat much quicker. After a 15
&gt;minute shut down - the pressure and temps will be back to near normal
&gt;temps and psi levels as compared to dino oil. Some have suggested that
&gt;this means that the heat is passed on to the engine block - and there may
&gt;be some truth to this. The difference may not be important, however. The
&gt;other point is  that synthetic does leak much more easily. It took several
&gt;tries of removing both valve covers and repositioning the gaskets before a
&gt;good seal could be obtained. Similarly the drain and sump gaskets needed a
&gt;little extra tightening.

&gt;Today; we went to fill up the BBQ and Westy propane tanks at Superior
&gt;propane in Ottawa. The BBQ tank was no problem; but the fellow could not
&gt;get the nozzle to fit the Westy tank (this will be our first fill-up). The
&gt;problem was not the nozzle itself which was the right diameter and thread but
&gt;that the &quot;protector plate&quot; below the tank prevented the right &quot;angle of
&gt;attack&quot;. These are big nozzles used to fill up taxis. I have two questions.
&gt;a) has anyone else had this problem and b) does anyone in Ottawa know of
&gt;a place other than Superior that fills tanks? 
&gt;Thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt;BTW has anyone ever used their BBQ with the Westy tank - in other words is
&gt;there an adaptor that would allow the two to be connected?
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Guys,
&gt;
&gt;Probably a silly question but are your taxis running on LP (liquid petroleum)
&gt;gas or propane?  There is a considerable difference in the butane content of
&gt;the two fuels and LP gas is not suitable for burning in propane cookers and
&gt;heaters.  I am not sure whether it is a health/fume or flammability thing but
&gt;in AUS it is strictly verboten to fill propane cylinders from the LP gas
&gt;pumps.....
&gt;
&gt;In terms of filling a propane cylinder/tank you do just loosen the 'safety'
&gt;or filler valve and fill the tank until gas starts squirting out the valve
&gt;(theoretically should be located on the top of the tank even if tank is
&gt;horizontal?) - then close the valve fully and stop the fill.  
&gt;
&gt;(It is actually safer to have the valve fully open and squirting *for
&gt;non-smokers anyway 8-)*.. than have it shut when filling..._dot_depends whether
&gt;you want a fire or pressure explosion.  Actually it's pretty safe - I think
&gt;you'd find not enough oxygen in that plume to burn....)

&gt;
&gt;Due to the lower air density at higher altitudes your engine may run slightly
&gt;rich and therefore cooler.  The general rule of thumb is that you may advance
&gt;your timing one degree for each thousand feet of altitude.  And with that
&gt;stated let me offer some personal advice.  If you do not have a degree wheel,
&gt;and are not running electronic ignition the chances are that your timing will
&gt;wander a bit even under ideal circumstances, thanks to the plug gap, wear in
&gt;the distributor shaft, rubbing block and so forth.  If you intend to operate
&gt;above 5,000 feet elevation for a prolonged period of time (ie, a move to
&gt;Denver, etc) then by all means, re-time your engine.  Otherwise, leave it
&gt;alone, unless it gives tells you in an obvious way that it would prefer a
&gt;different setting, in which case crank in a degree or two -- whatever the
&gt;engine likes -- to return its operation to harmony with your driving habits,
&gt;load carried, type of gas and, for all I know, the color of your hair and
&gt;eyes.  The point is, the settings in the manuals refer to new engines
&gt;operated under a set of fixed conditions.  Reality is seldom so kind, yet the
&gt;engine is always willing to let you know when it is happiest.
&gt;
&gt;The symptoms of altitude sickness usually resemble retarded timing; lack of
&gt;power, poor economy, possibly a bit of black smoke or start-up or when
&gt;attempting to accelerate.  However, if you are running a hot CDI or other
&gt;all-electronic ignition module, the symptoms may be partially masked by the
&gt;cleaner burn and longer spark duration provided by most CDI's ( which are
&gt;easily retro-fitted if you're not presently using one.  Coupled with platinum
&gt;plugs, the combo virtually eliminates tune-ups for air-cooled veedubs.)
&gt;
&gt;You may put aside any fears of high-altitude (ie, low-pressure) vapor locking
&gt;(as opposed to high temp vapor locks).  Since about 1980 all automobile fuel
&gt;sold in the United States has a vapor pressure that allows it to be used
&gt;safely to about 12,000 at 100 degrees Fahrenheit (an unlikely combination).
&gt; For the past twelve years the Experimental Aircraft Association has been
&gt;using mogas in aircraft, reporting the results to the FAA and the EAA
&gt;members.  Several certified aircraft engines are now permitted to use mogas,
&gt;or 'tractor' gas as pilots tend to call it.  Works fine, even in old
&gt;Volkswagens; no problems with low-pressure vapor-locking.

&gt;
&gt;To All:
&gt;
&gt;Not sure if this will ge germain to Westy-specific propane problems...
&gt;
&gt;I use a sausage-shaped 3-gal and the regular 5-gal jug on my '65 when fitted
&gt;out for camping.  The tanks are demountable.  I mounted the pressure
&gt;reducer/regulator permanently, provided it with a high-pressure hose that
&gt;will mate  to either tank.  Low pressure output is plumbed here and there
&gt;using 3/8&quot; dia aluminum tubing, the dead-soft stuff (3003).  All fittings
&gt;down-stream from the regulator are SAE flare or standard flared plumbing
&gt;items.
&gt;
&gt;I use a variety of adaptors to charge little propane cylinders (torch,
&gt;lantern, etc) from the big bottle.  Other adaptors allow any bottle to be
&gt;used with any of the lanterns, stoves, etc.  The adaptors were acquired over
&gt;the years but I assume a propane supplier would be a good place to find them.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;At least one of the adaptors is unique to Mexico (but quite common there).
&gt; It allows me to 'borrow' a bit of propane from a farm tank.
&gt;
&gt;Propane dictates a strict set of safety rules that are self-enforcing -- your
&gt;first mistake is usually your last.
&gt;
&gt;Filling a bottle with propane is a bit of a shock if you've never done it
&gt;before, what with the noise, frost and plume of vapor.  To keep from freezing
&gt;a finger it might be best to have someone walk you through the procedure.
&gt;
&gt;Propane makes an excellent vehicle fuel.  If it is commonly available in your
&gt;area at a resonable cost, you may wish to consider using it.  But it's a bit
&gt;of a chore to use such a vehicle for long trips since pound for pound propane
&gt;contains less energy than gasoline.  VOA's industrial engine division (usta
&gt;be in Chicago) offered a full range of pressure reducers, etc, needed to
&gt;operate air-cooled VW engines from gasseous fuels.

&gt; FINALLY, I got everything hooked up and ready to go. It took about two 
&gt; minutes of cranking with the plugs out to get the oil pressure light to
&gt; go out &lt;dipstick went form max to min&gt;. Put the plugs in, hook up the
&gt; new electronic ignition, set the timing and ...... sputter sputter. After
&gt; finding the loose clamp on the gulp valve &lt;air injection stuff&gt; it 
&gt; started right up. Running smooth, oil and alternator lights off - it even
&gt; idles! Wheew, what a relief.
&gt;
&gt; One casualty to all the wrenching is my 21 year old muffler. the right flange
&gt; cracked along the bottom  when I was tightening it up. The crack quickly 
&gt; spread up into the muffler as the engine heated up. What is 
&gt; best to do as regards replacement? Get another stock one &lt;about $150 from
&gt; RMMW&gt; or get an extractor &lt;about $70&gt;. $150 sounds like a lot, but if they
&gt; last 20 years, maybe it's not so bad. I used extractors on my '64 and I'd say
&gt; that 5-7 years is all they last. On the other hand, how many more years is
&gt; the faithful '74 going to be around?
&gt;
&gt; If I do go to an extractor, is it necessary to re-jet? Any other caveats?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's great to be rolling again &lt;albeit noisily&gt;!

&gt;Greetings
&gt;
&gt;       So I just finished rebuilding my 1600 DP yesterday.  As I was 
&gt;adjusting the valves for the first time, I noticed that the exhaust valve 
&gt;on no. 4 cyl was sticking.  All it took was a gentle tap with a piece of 
&gt;wood to get it to go in.  Figuring this was a problem, I pulled the head, 
&gt;squirted more oil into the lifter and proceeded to move it back and forth 
&gt;with my finger.  It stuck a little when I pulled it towards me, but moved 
&gt;in when I pushed.  OK, that's not too bad.  Put the head back on, 
&gt;readjusted the valves.  It's still sticking.  After banging it back in on 
&gt;the rocker arm, I began turning the engine back and forth very gently 
&gt;getting the valve to move.  It only sticks when the lifter has been 
&gt;pushed all the way out by the cam.  Before maximum throw, the valve 
&gt;spring easily moves the lifter in and out.
&gt;       So I figure, this isn't too bad.  I'll start the engine, it will get 
&gt;moved so quickly, it will come loose.  Wrong.  The engine runs quite well 
&gt;considering that valve is still stuck open.
&gt;
&gt;       What do I do?  Do I need to pull the engine and crack the block 
&gt;again?  Or can I pull the engine, take off the one head, cylinder, piston 
&gt;and rod and get in there with a very fine emery cloth and buff the lifter 
&gt;right under its lip where I presume it's sticking?  Agghh!  This is a 
&gt;set-back.  Any advice?

&gt;
&gt;&gt;After many a &quot;wanna syncro westy&quot; posting, I think that I've found one! A 
&gt;&gt;91 with 21,000 miles... I have to sell my kids to get it....I'm most 
&gt;&gt;interested in comments about specifics to be checked out on the rig 
&gt;&gt;before purchase,  any comments?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;At 21,000 miles it should be perfect! No H2O leaks, no visible 
&gt;corrosion/dried anti-freeze build-up near the headgaskets and bolts. Same 
&gt;warnings as to any wasserboxer van I guess. Check fridge, H2O pump, connect 
&gt;to street H2O and make sure all that is tight. Canvas OK? skylight ? roof 
&gt;rubber... Syncro bits, how easy is it to shift? Mine is terrible to get into 
&gt;1st or 2nd from neutral, low is ok. Locking diff ok? Does the engagement 
&gt;light come on when knob is out? Drive it in a tight circle on DIRT road only 
&gt;and see if the inside rear wheel is really churning up the ground, this will 
&gt;show the axle is locked. Any major underbody damage from offroading? Ball 
&gt;joints? (any clunking on washboard roads) Wheel bearings? (any droning on 
&gt;the highway). CV joints all PERFECT, no tears, no stray grease. 
&gt;U-joints/seals, look for leaks where shaft exits trans / front diff. Brakes? 
&gt;Power steering rack leaks? Heater? AC?
&gt;        Try the thing for a weekend before you commit, you need to drive it 
&gt;a fair amount to detect any bugs, ie. the ball joint won't show up in 
&gt;highway driving. A quick drive on potholed dirt roads will let you hear what 
&gt;is loose. There are other '91s on the list, maybe more concerns?  tim s.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The only problem I had was attaching the tent to the raingutter.  This was 
&gt;&gt;QUITE a chore.  Was I doing it wrong?  I attached after setting up tent - 
&gt;&gt;should I have attached this first?  Is there a trick to this or is it always 
&gt;&gt;a bear?  Maybe the rubber strip was just stiff from not using it.  Anyway, 
&gt;&gt;any advise appreciated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;You will get strong wrists doing this, just force the vinyl strip on really 
&gt;tightly, lots of twisting and pushing and pounding. The tent is really for a 
&gt;pre-vanagon, so the vanagon is an inch or two higher and makes for a tighter 
&gt;fit. Also, do you have the plasric trim over the edge of your raingutters? 
&gt;Taking it off will help, but isn't really neccessary. Put the vinyl strip  
&gt;on before you peg/tighten down the rest of the tent back.
&gt;         One important note... the tent poles are colour coded with strips 
&gt;of red and green tape. The cross pieces must match, ie. two green taped 
&gt;cornerd plus green centre T piece. I can't remember whether red or green 
&gt;goes against the van. It makes a BIG difference since the tent/frame is 
&gt;taller on the van side. If the upright poles want fight you for where they 
&gt;touch the ground, then the frame is likely backwards. Don't bend the poles 
&gt;lots, this will crack the corner pieces.  Great tent, good way to make sure 
&gt;your campsite isn't stolen when you motor off for the day.   tim s.

&gt;I've had the same problem at gas stations (where the nozzle is designed

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;I've been poking around in David Schwarze's Web Site, down loading various
&gt;pictures and stuff (Making myself envious of the various west coast van 
&gt;trips).  Any way, I grabbed a bunch of pictures, and the first 
&gt;Martha_stuck.mpg.
&gt;The pictures all turned out well on my gif/jpg viewer, but the mpg was
&gt;impossible to watch, jumping and thrashing all about.  It was my first
&gt;time using the mpg viewer, so I don't know if it is my software or the
&gt;file. (or if it got corrupted in downloading).  Has anybody else had
&gt;any trouble with this file?  Has anybody else downloaded it?
&gt;
&gt;  Do you mean the &quot;driving&quot; one? I FTP'd/snagged it and between the
&gt;  jerkiness of the MPEG (what is it, like 14 frames per second?) and
&gt;  the bumpiness of the road, it is kind of hard to watch. I got a real
&gt;  kick out of it, though... imagine having someone see these in a hundred
&gt;  years... &quot;Gosh, that was a Vanagon!&quot; The one with Ms. Rubin's ride
&gt;  being pushed from wherever it was stuck is a lot more fluid and easy

&gt;
&gt;On our '90 Westy, the procedure is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;1.  attatch propane nozzle to tank
&gt;2. open spit valve... this is located near the top of the tank and 
&gt;has a knurled nut on it.  You can usually undo it with your fingers.
&gt;3. squeeze trigger on propane nozzle to fill tank.  
&gt;4. When white cloud appears at spit valve, the propane nozzle will 
&gt;kick off.  Immediately close the knurled nut.  This will be VERY 
&gt;COLD, so using heavy rubber type gloves is a must.
&gt;5. Tank is filled to 80%.  Maximum capacity is 12 litres.
&gt;
&gt;On my Westy.. which has the standard Manchester tank, has two safety 
&gt;overfill valves.  The inlet valve where the propane hose gets 
&gt;attached will kick off, and the spit valve is the second indicator 
&gt;which will visibly indicate that it is 80% full.  One should NOT 
&gt;overfill beyond this.  I usually fill in the cool of the day.
&gt;
&gt;I usually fill my tank every 10-15 days of camping, and put in about 
&gt;7 litres at a time (~half full).  I believe it is safer to have a 
&gt;full tank.. less vapour.  The fridge is our primary consumer, as we 
&gt;don't use the stove burners that much... unless it is raining :(
&gt;
&gt;ALWAYS make sure that the propane valve is OFF.  In Canada, you are 
&gt;not allowed to fill the propane yourself... the station attendent is 
&gt;responsible for filling.  The proper nozzle attatchment fits above 
&gt;the bottom guard without any problems.  If it doesn't, the station 
&gt;must change his adapter.  I've never run into filling problems in 5 
&gt;years, and have filled up across Canada.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps.

&gt;&gt; I would rather keep the VW, but my wife wants the Toyota. So,
&gt;&gt; its gotta go.
&gt;
&gt;I'll admit that although, it's still runnign the engine is getting 
&gt;close to needing some valve work.  Otherwise it's in pretty good

&gt;Message-ID: &lt;9505301425.AA14696_at_decws3.coe.wvu_dot_edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;      The implication of a cleaner acting as a 'primer' is that no
&gt;&gt; priming is actually happening, but cleaning helps. That's certainly
&gt;
&gt;This is what I inherently believe but I'll share another perrspective.
&gt;I would normaly be inclined to believe that 1,1,1 Trichloroethane leaves
&gt;no residue, certainly doen't seem to on brakes, and I personally hate
&gt;the new enviro safe ones that don't flash evaporate, never seem to get
&gt;all the crap off, anyway back to the story.  Working on my masters I
&gt;have done a lot of experimental stress analysis using strain gages
&gt;bonded to metallic, fiberglass, and carbon fiber substrates using a
&gt;variety of adhesives, now the simplest adhesisve is nothing more than
&gt;super glue.  In fact the major strain gage manufacturer in this country
&gt;simply relabels Locktite super glue and sells it for use, now the
&gt;interesting part is this, before applying the superglue you do an
&gt;extensive, degreasing with 1,1,1 tri.. surface abrading, acid cleaning,
&gt;neutralizing, then right before you lay down the superglue you put
&gt;down a &quot;catalyst&quot; on the gage, if you don't the superglue will take
&gt;forever to set up and won't be worth crap, guess what that catalyst is,
&gt;yep 1,1,1 tri..., nothing else MSDS tells all.  Now you let it
&gt;evaporate fully before applying the glue, and no residue should be left,
&gt;the surface has already been totaly cleaned but without it bad results,
&gt;with it the superglue sets nearly instantly.  I've tried it when using
&gt;superglue for other uses and results are similar, it makes superglue
&gt;WORK and well, I figure it does much the same for Locktite, in fact for
&gt;Locktite I also often use cans are totaly pure 1,1,1 tri... that dad
&gt;got somewhere.  As a sidenote, recently the strain gage manufacturer
&gt;started sending a different &quot;catalyst&quot; that only works about half as
&gt;well as the previous one, due to problems shipping that evil 1,1,1
&gt;tri...  This one is simply reagent grade isopropyl alcohol.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;      I'm loosing my patience with Mill Supply. I've not yet recieved
&gt;&gt;      I hear their stuff is good, but their customer service stinks!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;      Bill
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Sorry to hear this, as one of the people to reccomend them earlier,
&gt;I can truly say I got good stuff with no problems but this is entirely
&gt;out of line.  If you paid with credit card as I imagine you did, I
&gt;would let the credit card sharks attack or would at least threaten
&gt;the company with such a possibility, it's really helped me rectify
&gt;some disputes with computer parts companies in the past, even with
&gt;just the threat of action.

&gt;Do you think it would be OK to drill and tap my type 4 oil galleries without taking the whole thing apart.
&gt;You know how difficult it is to drill and tap freehand without mounting the case on a drill press  --and the 
&gt;aluminum (or magnesium?)  chips could get wher you dont want them.  Or would it be better to peen the 
&gt;hades out of the aluminum around the pesky plugs and run straight 40 wieght casterol to  prevent/mimimize 
&gt;oil loss.

&gt;
&gt;Here's a little snippet about what was happening at the Bug-Out in Manassas, VA
&gt;this past Sunday.What a weekend!
&gt;
&gt; My Bug-Out experience started on Saturday, during the prep for the show.At
&gt;about 4PM, I decided to polish the wheels on my Notchback. (I still haven't had
&gt;time to rebuild the Vanagon tranny yet!) As long as I had all of the wheels off,
&gt;I also decided to give the brakes a quick flush/bleed, as it had been a couple
&gt;of years, and the pedal was getting a bit spongy. Well, I'm doing the one-man
&gt;method where you use a hose from the bleeder to a jar of fluid. I like to just
&gt;barely crack the bleeder screws, so that it takes a lot of pedal pressure to
&gt;force the fluid out. So I'm happily bleeding away, pushing REAL hard on the
&gt;brake pedal, and the pedal suddenly sinks right to the floor! I press the pedal
&gt;a few more times (as if I expect it to magically recover) as I bemoan my fate.
&gt;Turns out the metal brake line from the front to back rusted out. So I had the
&gt;fun task of replacing that animal. By time I get to the store, buy the parts,
&gt;remove the seats and carpet,install the line, bleed the brakes again, and polish
&gt;the very tarnished wheels, it is 1:30 AM on Sunday.
&gt;
&gt;Sunday morning: Up at 6:00 am. Drive to friends house, and on to Manassas.
&gt;Stopped at supermarket for supplies. I didn't know how may burgers I would give
&gt;out to Listmembers, but to be safe, I buy 15 lbs of hamburger and mondo rolls,
&gt;chips,etc. Got to Manassas right at 8:30 AM---IT IS PACKED IN THERE!! Guy at
&gt;gate doesn't want to let me in the show, says it is filled. Squirm my way in
&gt;anyhow. (I gotta get there earlier next time!) Set up Notchback in show area and
&gt;start looking around.
&gt;
&gt;First stop: SWAP MEET!
&gt;I love the swap meet section. I used to take down loads of parts until they
&gt;started charging $50.00 per spot! Not too much going on there. Saw one pair of
&gt;crusty Safari windows, and a set of side windows (louvered) for a 1960's Westy.
&gt;Two different individuals had the complete breadloaf Westy setup for sale.
&gt;Another was selling just the stove unit for one. Several Bus IRS tranny's, also.
&gt;One guy had a blue '81 Westy for sale--$2500!! It was in decent condition, small
&gt;amounts of surface rust and worn paint.
&gt;
&gt;Next stop: VENDORS!
&gt;Saw a few things down there. First, there was a guy selling class III trailer
&gt;hitches for Vanagons--I think it was Derek's buddy. I bought a new, genuine VW
&gt;windshield for my Vanagon for $145.00. Does anybody know if this is a good
&gt;price, or did I get squealed?? Most of the other parts were for Type I's.
&gt;
&gt;Next stop: SHOW!
&gt;Headed right for the Type II section. Very impressive turnout. Saw everything
&gt;from splitties to Eurovans. Saw fellow listmember Pete Krough's '85 Westy in the
&gt;show. God, I need a pop-top! They are too cool!! Seriously thinking about
&gt;selling my '88 and getting a Weekender or full Westy.
&gt;
&gt;Next stop: LUNCH!
&gt;Fired up the grill and relaxed, taking in the VW ambience. The view from my spot
&gt;was incredible! Directy behind me, a forest green '59 Single cab. Next to it, a
&gt;two-toned blue '86 (?) Crew cab fron Ontario. Further down, a wonderful
&gt;red/white 1960's crew cab. Life was good. Threw several burgers on the grill,
&gt;and sat back with a few cold ones. During the course of the day, met listmembers
&gt;Pete Krough, Chris Chubb, Bill Killian &amp; Wife &amp; baby. Ran into
&gt;many-non-listmember VW friends, also. Went home at about 4:30 pm-wet and tired.
&gt;
&gt;Oh yeah, I might have forgotten that it rained. Minor technicality!
&gt;
&gt;Also, if anybody runs across a diesel Vanagon, Westy or Non-Westy on the East
&gt;Coast for sale, let me know! Thanks!

&gt;Message-ID: &lt;9505301851.AA01695_at_hops.gvg.tek_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi folks-
&gt;
&gt;I hope someone can shed some light here.  I'm trying to put some new
&gt;shocks on my bus (in this case, KYB Gas-A-Justs) and have encountered
&gt;some confusion. 
&gt;
&gt;I mail-ordered new shocks all around and the rears went fine.  The
&gt;fronts that arrived claimed to be for bugs up to 65, but the supplier
&gt;claimed that they were also the right ones for the bus (I beleive
&gt;71-79 or some such).  Unfortunately, the sleeve in the lower end of
&gt;the shock will not fit over the stud on the bus.  The
&gt;currently-installed shocks don't have a sleeve on the lower end, just
&gt;the rubber bushing. 
&gt;
&gt;I called the vendor again, and they suggested that I &quot;just pry the
&gt;sleeve out with a screwdriver.&quot;  No dice; they are bonded to the
&gt;bushing, and I chewed one up trying.  I called RMMW and they verified
&gt;that they sell the same shock for that application.  The KYB number is
&gt;KG4521, by the way.  
&gt;
&gt;So; what gives?  Did VW change the shock mount in mid-71?  Is that
&gt;oversize stud on my bus really the old sleeve self-welded to the stud?
&gt;Anybody got any clues?  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any insight,
&gt;
&gt;-Mitch
