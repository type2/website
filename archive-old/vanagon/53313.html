Subject: 95 EV Winnie potential defect

To those few of you with a Norcold refrigerator, who may have had LP
starting problems; mine gave up on cold or rainy days. Thought I'd share 
the results of several months of warranty headaches until the 
intermittent problem was finally diagnosed and fixed:

apparently the igniter wire to the burner box has such light insulation,
that it can short to adjacent metal; the fix was to replace with more
heavily shielded cable.  

Since it is not safety related, Winnebago won't recall, but is fixing 
them individually as they turn up. I called their Owner Relations Dept.,
asked for a list of known defects, was told there aren't any.
