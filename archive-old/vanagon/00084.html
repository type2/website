Subject:      Re: Kombi, Kombi, who's got the Kombi ... (differences)

&gt;Rubber mats for a Vanagon?  Would they be easy to retrofit to my '84 GL?
&gt;Are they readily available?  I thought when I got this thing I asked at my
&gt;local VW dealer and was told they weren't available for an '84 Vanagon,
&gt;but it might be as simple as getting mats for an earlier one.  I can live
&gt;with the cloth seats (they're more comfortable when you get into a hot bus
&gt;here in Texas, anyway) but my carpet looks like you'd expect in a utility
&gt;vehicle with 110,000 miles on it.

yes, indeedy you CAN!!! all it takes is a small texas fortune!!! just the
front rubber floor mat was $250!!!! not including that little piece between
the front seats. i was too shocked to price the big one in the back seats!
i wanted to replace the carpet (also dirty ... i really don't think you
can keep carpet clean ... unless you cover it up with some sort of rubber/
vinyl covering) in my 88 bus and ran afoul of Mr. Budget!

&gt;BTW, what's a Caravelle?  I thought that was a Renault ripoff of a Karmann
&gt;Ghia.  Is VW using that name for the Typ II in other markets?

it IS a renault, but vw uses that name for the Vanagon models we call GL.
they (vw) also have a model called Magnum, which i think is about the same
as the Carat. i was lucky enough to get someone to bring me back a rear hatch
emblem of 'Transporter'. :) it just popped right into the old 'Vanagon' holes.

&gt;Ummm....  If these are German sources, how much could they apply to U.S.-
&gt;spec VWs?  I know they've sold quite a few models in Deutschland that we
&gt;have never seen on this side of the pond.

that's the problem ... what influence did VWOA have on all this? were all
Kombi's sold in the u.s. upgraded to a certain level? or were only a certain
trim level even shipped? that part i don't know.
