Subject: next CCC's trip!


I'm raring to go camping again, as usual, and judging by my
mailbox, so are many of the rest of you.  Am therefore going to
propose that we again go to the place on the Kern River (north
of Lake Isabella, and sort of equidistant for CCC's coming either
from southern or northern California).  This is the place we
discovered this past weekend, and should be again a welcome
escape from this AWFUL heatwave we are having.  

Anyway, here's some possible dates, please let me know of
your interest and vote:

weekends of:
May 24th
May 31st
June 14th
June 21st
July 5th
