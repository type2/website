                           Easy Oil Temp
                        For Upright Engines


Just to the right of the oil pump on the rear of every Type I
engine you'll see a slotted plug.  It is about half an inch in
diameter and the slot is moon-shaped, rather like the cut-out for
a Woodruff key, unsuited for removal with a regular screwdriver.

The plug closes off the drilled passage that supplies oil from
the sump to the oil pump inlet.  Inside the crankcase the oil
pick-up tube is a press fit into the drilled passageway, the
pick-up prevented from turning by being secured to one of the oil
sump plate studs.  

The inlet to the oil pump is one of the best places to measure
your oil's temperature, since the oil has been drawn from the
deepest part of the sump and gives an accurate indication of the
average oil temp which can vary by more than a hundred degrees
(F.) depending on where the temperature is measured.

J. C. Whitney provides an adapter that matches the threads of the
slotted plug (13-xx-9267-A, $4).  The adapter is internally
threaded to accept the standard oil temperature sender
(12-xx-6195-Y, $8) that matches their electric oil temperature
gauge (12-xx-6193-T, $17).  

For less than $30, plus shipping, you can add a durable,
reasonably accurate oil temperature gauge to your engine and do
so in an entirely professional manner.  The wire is well
protected and does not interfere with the sump plate or dipstick. 
The only 'gotcha' in the installation is removal of the threaded
plug and this can be accomplished with vise-grip pliers once a
suitably shaped blade has been made to accurately fit the curved
slot in the plug, a task that takes only a few minutes if you
have a vise and file.  Once installed, the temperature pick-up
does not obstruct the oil flow in any way.

For those of you with early-model buses, finding room to install
additional instrumentation has always been a trial.  One location
is to use the cover plate on the overhead ventilator.  Indeed,
the cover plate is large enough to support four 2&quot; diameter
instruments and a 3&quot; diameter tachometer, the wiring being
concealed in the windshield corner post and carried back to the
engine compartment through the driver's side frame member.

The only disadvantage of the overhead location is that it
requires the driver to shift his/her eyes farther away from the
windscreen than is usual and may induce some steering wander. 
Once accustomed to the location however you'll find scanning the
overhead instruments more convenient than scanning those mounted
below the dash or package tray and certainly less of an eye-sore
and knee-gouger.  The use of tapered wooden shims under the
bezels of the instruments to cant them toward the driver makes
them easier to read.

When pulling wire through the frame member you'll probably find
it works best to use a fish-tape fed into the frame member from
the middle.  It would also be wise to pull as many wires as you
might possibly need in the future, including at least one heavy
gauge cable such as a #10 for auxiliary power.  

The handiest way to get the new wiring harness into the cockpit
is to drill a new hole near one of the existing wiring harness
pass-thrus and install a rubber grommet.  If you do a bit of
planning you'll be able to come up with an installation that
looks as if it were done at the factory and one that will cause
no problems with existing wiring or plumbing.

If you can afford it, plan for the installation of an oil
pressure gauge, oil temperature gauge, voltmeter and tachometer. 
If you order from J. C. Whitney (&quot;Illuminated Preision Electric
Gauges&quot;) all of the gauge faces will be of the same design.  If
you wish to have a symmetrical arrangement of two 2&quot; instruments
on either side of the 3&quot; tachometer, you may consider an engine
hour meter or even a clock to fill the fourth hole.
