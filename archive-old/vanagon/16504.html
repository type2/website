Hi List!  Lisa here, and after a year and half of waiting for
the right time I'm working out the details on having the Frau's
window seals, rust holes (minor), and paint work done! Yahoo!!

Gonna order the seals from West Coast Metric, as per list
advice, and the holes will be cut out and replaced with new metal,
a' course.

My only dilemma...the paint! I'll look up the archives as the
recommended brands and such to 'suggest' to the shop, but I
can't decide on color. (sigh) Right now she's the original
'eggshell white', but I really want something a bit more fun.
She's a splittie so in general I'm thinkin' white/offwhite on
top and a contrast color below.

Suggestions? Cautions? I'm planning on having the work done
at the end of May.

Thanks, Lisa
