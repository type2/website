Hello,
I was just told of an interesting idea for remote engine warming.
Apparently, this has been used in Alaska with success.
The idea is this:  take an iron pipe and stick the end of a propane torch
in it.  Light the propane torch and place it under your engine.  
I was told that in about an hour, the engine will be ready to start.
It would, however, be nice if some type of permanent heater could be arranged
which is based upon the same principle, but connected to the onboard propane
tank.
