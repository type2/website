Subject: Re: Primary Battery Removal:  How to?

Gee, Greg, I hope it's a top post.
Look at your FLAPS or discount store for a &quot;battery carrier.&quot; It's a plastic
strap about 12&quot; long with a flat piece of steel crimped on each end with holes
just a little larger than the battery posts. The steel ends just slip down over
the posts, you grab the strap in the middle and lift.
