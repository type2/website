Subject: RE: RE: 89 syncro, binds in tight turning

Hello Tom, et all.  My '90 behaves like Tom's '89 Syncro.  I don't 
have oversize tires  (I have LT195 75R14... a little bigger than 
stock), and find that although steering effort is higher nearer the 
full lock positions, it isn't what I would call &quot;high&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; .. 
just a little more resistance.

Harry


&gt; Diff lock off: No shuddering or binding. Steering effort is high 
&gt; toward the stops, which I always thought was due to the expanded 
&gt; footprint of the oversize tires. Other than that, nice smooth circles.
&gt; 
&gt; Diff lock on: Shudders, enough that I did not want to keep on doing 
&gt; this to the vehicle. Shuddering definately decreases as I approach 
&gt; straight line. No visible tire scuffs  on the asphalt, but it is
&gt; not a dry surface.
