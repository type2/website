Tim, thanks much for response.  I had the problem of this &quot;slipping&quot;
prior to having the fluid changed and screens cleaned.  I was hoping
that the service would improve it but it really made no difference.  I
do not know what adjustments are there, but will look into this.  Also,
I'll have to ask the mechanic who did the work what type of ATF he used.
 I'll let you know.  Thanks again, Ed

&gt;
&gt;&gt;My 90 Carat with 106K automatic trans is starting to act peculiar.  I
&gt;&gt;had it serviced (fluid and screens cleaned), but no help.  Symptoms are
&gt;&gt;when shifting from 2nd to 3rd on low level of acceleration, seems to
&gt;&gt;shift to 3rd,  then release and apparently head back to 2nd.  Engine
&gt;&gt;revs like it is almost in neutual.  After a few seconds, it goes back to
&gt;&gt;3rd and seems OK.  Under hard acceleration, it shifts as expected/as is
&gt;&gt;should.  No other funny noises.  Has anyone else had this?  Am I looking
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I was/am considering doing the same flush/screen work (on Audi and crewcab),
&gt;but was advised by a friendly (but British car) mechanic that all new ATF
&gt;will clean out the clutch packs too well and they will then slip.  Also...
&gt;there is a gear pump inside the trans to power the pistons/actuators that
&gt;work the brake bands for controlling shift.  Maybe something is 'too clean'
&gt;in there now? Now a lower pump pressure?  I think the bands are adjustable
&gt;somehow.  Did you put in synthetic ATF? Please post your responses to
&gt;me/list? thanks, Tim
