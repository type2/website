The last time I bought brushes I had to go to either a FLAPS or an 
electrical motor rebuilder, I can't remember now.  I haven't priced 
diodes since you need a press to get them in and out, which I don't 
have.  But since you've put me on to the task, I'll check it out and let 
you know.

&gt;  &gt;&gt; the widings are not abused to cause the insulation to fail.

&gt;  &gt;Sorry Dennis, I disagree with you here.  I have the original alternator 
&gt;  &gt;still in my 77 Rabbit.  I replaced the brushes 6 years ago and have never 
&gt;  &gt;had to touch the bearings.  This alternator has slowly gone from 23 
&gt;  &gt;Amps output 3 years ago to its current (little pun, there) 10 Amps.  
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Obviously the diodes are going and while I could get another diode pack 
&gt;  &gt;and put it in, I'll probably opt to buy a lifetime warranteed rebuilt 
&gt;  &gt;unit just so I don't have to go through this again (in another 10 
&gt;  &gt;years...:) ).   
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Electronic construction processes being what they are (ion implantation) 
&gt;  &gt;any electronic device will _decay_ or lose it's effectiveness over time, 
&gt;  &gt;particularly one in such a hostile environment as an automobile engine 
&gt;  &gt;compartment.
