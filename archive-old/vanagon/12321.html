&gt; 
&gt; So Steve Wall says:
&gt; &gt; So, has anybody thought of coming up with some kind of identification
&gt; &gt; badge that can be placed on our vehicles to identify us as members of
&gt; &gt; &quot;THE list&quot;?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Comments?
&gt; 
&gt; Nice idea, but I have a real aversion to putting stickers on my car.  
&gt; However, I wouldn't mind hanging a piece of flannel on the antenna. ;)
&gt; 

I (for one) don't have any space for bumper stickers...
But I like the idea of the flannel strip from the antenna!
