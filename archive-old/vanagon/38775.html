Subject: Resubsciption and Req for Info on '78 to '73 Engine Swap

After disappearing for a year, I am re-subscribing.  Sorry to be gone so
long, but after I got back from my personal cross-country tour last spring
things got a bit busy.  I send this so Joel can revise revise the stats list
and to explain why I am re-subscribing.  

I no longer have the '78 bus.  I drove it to Florida two weeks ago and used
it to rear-end a pickup truck. Hard.  No injuries, but totalled the bus.
Because I had a fresh engine and fresh tires on it, I was unwilling to
abandon the carcass, so I looked about a bit and found a genuine '79 Florida
beach bus (fine on top, but completely rusted beneath). After performing a
roadside engine/tire swap, I drove the engine (and attached rust bucket)
back to Alexandria, VA.  Got as far as Fredericksburg, VA before the rusty
gas tank clogged the gas filter and I was afoot again.  Had the '79 towed
the rest of the way, but in the process of driving and towing it back formed
a very negative relationship with this body, and am determined to get rid of
it.  I have now purchased a '73 Westy and intend to transplant my '78 FI
engine into it.  Has anyone out there ever retrofitted an FI engine into a
non-FI body?  As I see it the problem areas are:

Fuel System:
        swap gas tanks (after cleaning out the rust)
        mount electric fuel pump
Electric:
        Strip rear wiring harness from '79 and '73
        Install '79 rear wiring harness in '73

Body:
        chisel off and install air filter support bracket
        switch fuel tank cover plates (for decel valve anchor arm)

Questions:
        What have I forgotten?
        Where are the hidden pitfalls?
        Anyone done a complete rear harness replacement?
        Am I too old to do something this dumb?

Further Westy questions:
        How does the fridge work?
        Where can I get replacements for:
                pop-top canvas
                pop-top to roof seal
                drop table hinge?

                        WALSTIB,
                        Steve
