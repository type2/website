Subject: fuse(y) box


Ok, so the 82 Vanagon L, along with the 85 and perhaps every other van of 
those years has these little brass(?) connectors in teh fuse box.  The 
fuses slide into them when you push them apart.  Here is my problem, two 
of mine are broken on the bottom and several are really corroded.  So, I 
have fuses wedged into place right now (I really like brake lights), but 
would like to do a good fix.  How?  Do you replace the little clip, or 
should I go for the whole board or what?
