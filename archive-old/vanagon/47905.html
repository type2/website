&gt;     Yep, 80's VW products had something Blue that looked like an LED

&gt; my guess is a lightbulb with a blue plastic cover. If its an LED, it'll
&gt; turn ON in micro-seconds, if an incandesent lamp, milliseconds, so  if
&gt; you're sharp-eyed, or can make a highspeed film or video of it
&gt; you can tell without sawing the thing apart. An led will conduct only
&gt; one way (its a diode after all) while a lamp will conduct both ways.

On my 85 Jetta, I'm pretty sure it's incandescent for two reasons: it 
has a blue plastic 'cap' which covers a clear bulb fitting in the LED 
socket, and I've burnt out 2 of these, but *never* burnt out an LED 
in any of my VWs...

(I've never tried to buy one though - I had a spare cluster to 
scavenge one from..)
