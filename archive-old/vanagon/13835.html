&gt;Do any of you know whether folks interested in Porsche 914's have a mail 
&gt;list?  Real Porsche enthusiasts seem to hate the 914, but it does have a lot 
&gt;in common with the bus, so I thought that I'd ask here.

Try porschephiles-request_at_tta_dot_com

Send him a message with who you are, what you drive, etc, and he'll get 
you set up. 

Bruce Anderson, Henry Pellow, and they guys from Automobile Atlanta 
(914 gurus) are on this list.
