Subject: 78 Westy: Green plaid seat fabric
Date: Wed, 12 Jun 1996 16:01:36 -0600

I am trying to locate some of the &quot;lovely&quot; 70's era bright 
green/olive green/yellow-orange/black plaid seat fabric
to use for rebuilding the front seats of my 78 Westy.
Anyone know of a source for this kind of stuff? TIA.

Dave Brooks - 78 Westy, 82 Vanagon
