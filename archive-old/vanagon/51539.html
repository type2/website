Subject: Head Gasket - 86 Syncro?
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 96 16:50:00 CDT


While reading John Muir's book, &quot;How To Keep Your Subaru Alive&quot; last night, 
I began to wonder about my 86 Syncro's frequent need for coolant in the 
overflow tank.

Muir's book indicated the possibility of a faulty head gasket.  In a 
previous chapter titled &quot;Driving for Longevity&quot;, he suggested anticipating 
problems before they leave you stranded on the side of the road.    I'm not 
trying to imply my Syncro is anything like a Subaru, but here must be some 
general similarities.  Here are the symptoms:

1.)  Need for coolant in the overflow tank

2.)  Tendency to run hot (?) at times.  Especially when tooling around the 
city or when I pull off the highway (perhaps that's normal)

3.)  Exhaust emissions, are, at times white or somewhat gray after the van 
has warmed up.

4.)  The smell (an educated guess) of coolant when the heater is run.

5.)  The overflow tank has a bunch of black crap stuck to the interior wall 
(which may be a stop leak compound the pervious owner added)

****  Aside from the above concerns, she runs well.  I just want to think 
more like Muir and take care of possible problems early.

     On the opposite side of the scale, I changed the oil recently and it 
was black as an ace of spades.

If it is a blown head gasket, is it possible to replace it without dropping 
the engine ??

Paulo
