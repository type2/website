Subject: RE:OK, barndoor nuts! What's this?


Maybe this is a dumb question...but with the bullet turn signals,
are you sure this is a barn door? We had a dsicussion about what
a &quot;barn door&quot; is in this group a while back. And a &quot;barndoor&quot;
refers to the very large engine lid on the rear of the van. The rear
window does not have a hatch (a la later vans), and therefore is 
stationary. You should be able to see the fuel tank and spare tire
inside the engine compartment.

The original poster of this discussion thought the term &quot;barn door&quot;
referred to the two cargo doors on the side of the van.

Just curious...
