Subject: Re: TYP I&amp;II ENG. different??

Really from 1968 to 1971 because 1972 and on had a Type IV any way. Actually
whoever had my '72 Westy took out the original 1700cc and put a universal
1600 upright (with alot of sheet metal to fill in the gap) and never even put
the rear cross member back let alone the rear motor mount and only had the
two lower studs and one upper bolt holding the motor in!  And I drove it
around for 5 years (only 14,000 miles) with it like that.  So, what I wonder
is is it really, REALLY necessary to have that rear mount?  Inquiring minds
want to know!
