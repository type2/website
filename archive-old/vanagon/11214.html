joe:

glad you enjoyed the lit. while you are up here robbing my house, i will be
vacationing in tallahasee (like about 10 billion other canucks!) and
searching out your address to liberate you of all those add-a-rooms you got
at far to cheap a price ;) !

BTW when you photocopied all of those metric pages, you mentioned that you
did it on A4 sized paper. Did you have to photocopy each of those pages
individually?? I don't think i would want to trust that old paper to the
&quot;feeder&quot; on a phtotocopier. My worst angst laden fear would be to see that
old paper swallowed into the bowels of a Xerox machine!!

I go through enough angst watching the pimply faced teenager working the
colour photocopier on all my old lit. EEEEK don't fold the pages back!!!!!!
#$%#%_at_!!

&gt;Thanks to Ron and Pat and Michael for your generous recompense for the
&gt;Westy manual copies.
&gt;
&gt;Ron, your check's already in the bank.  Dinner was excellent, thank you.:-)
&gt;
&gt;Pat, now I see what Sami (I think) said about keeping your tent from
&gt;filling up with water.  Thanks for the bux, too.
&gt;
&gt;Michael, you dog of a Canadian, you.  I'm coming up to rob your house.  That
&gt;brochure like, totally _roools_, Beavis.  Thanks for spending $645.00 CDN
&gt;for the postage to send it here.  'Course that's only about $1.98 US. ;-}
&gt;
&gt;Who was it that wanted a copy of the gas heater manual for their early
&gt;60's bus?
&gt;
&gt;Heh-aheheh.  This list is _cool_.
&gt;
&gt;Busshead.
