I see a separate list forming on the horizon,  hmmm lets see
the SubaVW group.  In the past few months I have seen a variation on 
the theme below several times.  Below is the address of one who did it.

&gt; I have been in contact with Volks Folks re
&gt; conversion to a Subaru engine. Anybody done this and would you reccomend
&gt; it?

Why have I been saving these message I do not know, but I have been.
Maybe it's the '87 Subaru with 178K on it I have with no engine work.

Derrek  -

Another listee posted similar desire to install Subaru into a Vanagon.
Here's a copy of my post, and his email address.  Y'all get together.

&gt; My intention is to put a subaru 2.2L motor in it.  

Copy of previous post follows:

Tom -
Last year someone did a Subaru 1600 into their Vanagon.  Posted 
quite a bit of details of his conversion.  Contact him at:

I think he posted this stuff on a web site too.
