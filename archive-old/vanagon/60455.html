Subject: no start/road trip

I'm posting this for my husband who has broken down on a road trip.  
While crusing down the highway he experienced intermittent lost of 
power.  He pulled over and turned of engine, and when he tried to 
restart, the engine would crank but not start.  He is wondering if this 
is the ECU.  He installed new ignition wires, cap and rotor and last week 
he installed a new oxygen sensor to cure a low idle problem.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Phil's wife, Carol
