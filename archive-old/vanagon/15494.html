Subject: next BA. bash!


Steve Johnson, Bradley Prunehead, and I have been putting our heads
together thinking about the next bash.  None of the three of us
will be attending the mid- or eastern- US part of GNATT during
the time it is scheduled, as we either can't take off that much
time, or it presents a schedule conflict.  But in the meantime, we
thought it would be nice to have some sort of Bay Area/Sacramento
(and anyone else who'd like to join in) gathering somewhere nearby.
This goes back to the Bodega Bay idea, and weekends we're looking
at are:  

May 26-28 (memorial weekend)

or

June 2-4

-

How many of you would be interested in attending, and if so,
which dates do you vote for?
