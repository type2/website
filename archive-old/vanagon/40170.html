Subject: Re: Joel change the stats (60 kombi)

Well it is official I now have the 1960 model 235 Kombi in my (so to speak)
hot little hands :).
-------

congrats !   it sounds great
    

Upon closer inspection of the &quot;cargo&quot; section of the bus i noticed it has
the mounting holes for rear seats. Does anyone know if busses that cames w/
the mounting holes of the seats necessarily _came_ with seats (or whether
or not ths would be reflected in the m-code tag?). Basically I am curious
to know if this bus had seats at one point and time.

kombis came with a rear seat, the middle seat was an option, it would come
with the mounting places.    only the delivery vans did not come with seats
