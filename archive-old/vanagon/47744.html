The heck with that, check out the previous VW classifieds you can go to
on this page, somebody is selling an actual VW SP2, unreal I had never
thought this car made it legaly to the US and certainly very few exist
period.  The styling I always thought was incredible, nicer than a 911
IMHO, and a real piece of history (the origional car for which the 041
head was made I believe and likely a number of other neat OEM performance
mods)  and a pretty impressive performer with a great power to weight
ratio if I recall some of the period reviews.  Oh I'd love to know what they
want for it.
