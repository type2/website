Subject:       Re: Wrong coolant type in 84 Vanagon
Date:          Thu, 10 Aug 1995 07:34:24

&gt; A month ago before taking the van for a 2 weeks vacation, I had a VW
&gt; dealer did a cooling system flush and add coolant.  Everything works
&gt; normal until last Sunday: The engine is overheated.  Today they checked
&gt; and said the water pump needs to be replaced.  The cost is $90 for the
&gt; pump, $183 for labor and $15 for coolant.  I left the van at the 
&gt; dealer and would let them know tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; I found out that the coolant they put in last month (ZVW237104, comes 
&gt; in 4L jug by VW) is not the correct type which is ZVW237102 (comes in 
&gt; 1.5L bottle) and also they now know that too.
&gt; 
&gt; The question I have is:
&gt; 
&gt;     Can the wrong coolant type do any damages to the water pump and 
&gt;     other parts of the cooling system?  I do not know much about these
&gt;     2 types but would think the ZVW237102 is for aluminum block.  The
&gt;     cooling system seemed fine even before I had it changed.

The wrong coolant can definitely cause some serious havoc, but I'm not to 
sure it's your water pump that'll be affected.  It's well know that use of 
antifreeze solutions containing phosphates (which is the majority of them) 
will cause corrosion in aluminum, eg. aluminum engine blocks.  The most 
common result is the dreaded &quot;blown head gasket syndrome&quot; (progressive 
corrosion and seepage between the head gasket and head, culminating in a 
blown head gasket and warped/pitted heads).  But water pump, I don't know 
if that's got aluminum in it.  

In any case I just happen to have a jug of ZVW 237 104 sitting here in 
front of me (don't ask me why), and it says:  &quot;Phosphate Free Formula for 
Use in Volkswagon &amp; Audi Water Cooled Vehicles&quot; (it's also labelled as a 1
gallon container).  Got it from my VW dealer last year.  So my guess is, 
your dealer added the correct stuff, even though it had a different P/N.  
Still, the obvious thing to do is verify that the stuff they used is rated 
for your vehicle, and in particular is phosphate free.  (Off-hand, I can't 
imagine a VW dealer even STOCKING a phosphate bearing antifreeze.. geez, 
talk about asking for trouble ;)

As for the water pump, well one possibility is coincidence.  How many 
miles might the thing have had on it?  They all crap out sooner or later.  
Another distinct possibility is that the flushing process may have 
dislodged corrosion products or other particles (I guess it's supposed 
to), which may have gotten forced into the water pump shaft seal or 
bearings.  I don't know about automotive water pumps, but this can 
definitely be a problem with industrial equipment.  The pump design 
generally tends to expel particles from the seal/bearing area when 
running, but if fluids are forced through, under pressure, with the pump 
idle, material can lodge in the seal (causing wear, and finally leakage 
into the bearing) or into the bearing directly, causing bearing failure.  

Anyhow, you've got a new water pump now.  One less thing to worry about 
for oh, say 40K miles!
