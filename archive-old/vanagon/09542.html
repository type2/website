&gt; Todd Schroeder mentioned the Twentynine Palms area.  That is on the

cut

&gt; area, where most of the West-coast vanagon owners seem to be.  Another
&gt; nice place is Red Rock Canyon, which is farther North on highway 395.

Especially Red Rock Canyon sounds good! But be aware that end of March 
might be a bit crowded in some places due to the University Spring Break!
