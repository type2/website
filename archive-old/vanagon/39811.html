Subject: Winni-EV-MV-Westy--Add a room

Yes the &quot;Add a Room&quot; is what I was looking for.  It seems that this &quot;Room&quot;
uses the support of the hatch to hold the room up.  How long does it take to
get it set up?  
(This is important because we frequently take day trips that would require it
be disassembled and reassembled).  Is there a zippered section into the van?
or is it open?

Do you also have the side awning?

Thanks for your help,

Scott Martel
