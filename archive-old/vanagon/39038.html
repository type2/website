Subject: Vanagon theft deterent


 I have just installed an effective theft deterent on my 84 Westfalia that
someone else might like to try. I have simply taken the gound wire from the
fuel pump over the fuel tank and into the cab and connected it to ground
via a switch hidden under the carpet.  All I have to do when I park is press
the hidden switch and the car is disabled.  Very unlikely that any thief will
have time to find out what I have done as there are no tell tail wires around
the ignition.  It took about 60 mins to install and cost about $3.00.  I am
thinking of fixing it up so that the horn comes on if you try and start the
van whithout flipping the switch...
