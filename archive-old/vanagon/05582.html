Subject: Headlight/Hazard switches


Does anyone have (or know where I can get) a headlight switch and a 
hazard switch for a Vanagon (gotta fit an '85 but I assume that they are 
all the same)?  The light in my hazard switch is burnt out which isn't 
really a problem, but if I could get a working one for a coupla bucks, 
thats better.  And I want the headlight switch a clean looking dash 
mounted fog/driving lamps switch.  So... If anyon can help... E-mail me 
with your price and we'll take it from there.


Cheers                                                 ***
