Subject: Oil Splatters in Engine Compartment (Me too)

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;	When I got home from work yesterday, I noticed the bus was dripping 
&gt;oil, so I opened the engine lid to find oil splattered all over the back (FIF)
&gt;part of the engine compartment! It was concentrated around the crank pulley
&gt;area.
&gt;
I have been having this problem too, please include me in this thread

thanx
