&gt;Does anyone know if there are roof racks for a Vanagon available and where?

I have two types of roof racks for my Vanagons.  

One is the carry-all luggage type rack, made of bent tubular steel in a loos
&quot;cage&quot; configuration.  It is about 1/2 the length of the roof.  I bought it
second hand, but it appears to have a VW part number on it.  I think that it
is one of the non-VW products that VW America bought &amp; marketed through its
dealers.

The other is a Thule rack system.  These are basic load carrying bars that
other attachments (bikes, skis, tents, canoes, boxes) can be added to.
 Vanagons use what Thule calls their &quot;High Foot&quot; mounting bracket to get the
bars high enough to get over the highly curved Vanagon roof.  Yakima &amp; others
make similar products.
