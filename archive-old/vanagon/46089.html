&gt; Ah. How do they open? Just curious. Are they cabled to the cab?

They don't: they are a stamping in the body.

&gt; Somewhere in my memory is a datum: There were only two with the vertical
&gt; vents, they were prototypes, whereabouts unknown, missing presumed dead. Is
&gt; that right? I probably read that somewhere.

Probably.  The only one's I've seen (pix) that had vertical vents
were protos./

Perhaps the correct word would be louvers, instead of vents, but actually
vents is still correct...
