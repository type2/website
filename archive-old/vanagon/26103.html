&gt; How about using a propane heater used for camping in your bus?
&gt; I don't know if this has been suggested before, but it sounds reasonable.
&gt; It would be safer than a gas heater, cheaper, and probably as cost
&gt; efficient.  Just called local camping surplus store, he said this
&gt; would be great for vans.  From $24.95 and up, some come with
&gt; safety mechanism where it shuts off if tipped over.
&gt; Could this be the solution to our problem?
&gt; I know about an odor or that it might ruin headliner, but my bus
&gt; smells anyway plus the headliner is faded yellow in some parts.
&gt; Sound good?!?!

Just make sure it is securly tied down, if there were ever an accident, 
even if it has an auto shut off, I'd hate to have that hot, very hot, 
heater flying around the car.
