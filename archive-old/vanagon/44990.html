 So...anyone know how accurate those funny little red markings that are
supposed 
 to indicate when to shift are on an '81 FI'd Westy?  How religiously should
I 
 try not to exceed the speed in each given gear?  Again, I go by feel with
this, 
 so if I am doin' wrong by the Code of St. Muir, you have my permission to
set me 
 straight using (preferably) ancient methods of torture and
interrogation....who 
 knows what other sins be lurking in my heart?
  &gt;&gt;
Excedding those marks for short intervals not a problem.  In all oppsed
engines, exceeding 4000 rpm for any lenghth of time will heat up the oil and
pound out the main bearings.  This pounding even happens to Waterboxers.
