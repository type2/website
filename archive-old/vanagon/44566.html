&gt;Might as well while you have it torn apart.  They aren't expensive.

With new rings in used cylinders, the rings may not seat.  You will have
just replaced a perfectly good short block with one that has no
compression.  If you get new rings, take the cylinders in and have them
honed.  Do not even consider replacing the rings without doing this.  And
by the way, it's not easy getting the pistons/rings back into the
cylinders.  I've tried twice, and broken a ring twice.  Maybe I'm just
clumsy, or maybe it really is something that should be left to the
professionals.  I know what I think.
