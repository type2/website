&gt;I've discovered a trick for the '86-'90 Vanagon Higbeams....  buy a 100 Watt 
&gt;H-3 bulb, cut the tab off of the perimeter and slip it into your H/B 
&gt;reflector/lens assembly....  It's so bright that you cannot look directly into 
&gt;the H/Bs when they are on!!

Wow. 

Should I do this too? 

I already upgraded my low beam 9004 to illegally bright wattage. I didn't
know you could do the high beams too.

What wattage are the old high beams? Where do you buy this H-3 bulb? 

Should we all do this?

(Not that we really need any more light, what with our high beams
illiminating the entire universe as it is.)
