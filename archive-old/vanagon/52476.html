Subject: iiGOT mine!  84 gl!

-- I just wanted to share a few words with the list;

   My family has had VW's since before I was born, (I'm 31).  My mom had 
a notchback when I was 2, we had that car untio\l I was 8.  We then got 
a 69 bus, (Fire Engine Yellow:()  We had that van for MANY years, I 
learned ALL about working on Air-Cooled engines.

  Today Mom still drives a VW(71 Type 3)  I can't get her to change, but 
anyway just a bit of history.

  I drive VW's all day long, somebody else's that has one problem or 
another, I drive everything from 55 Oval windows to Eurovans.  I've been 
driving a 79 Scirocco for the last 4 years!  I've never had a want to 
have a Vanagon until Ron Salmon left his 84 Westy with me for a couple 
of months,(Thanks Ron).

  Last week I bought my own Vanagon, a 84 GL, grey in color.  Blue 
interior 7 passenger!  The tranny was blown up, had the common broken 
off Alternator bolts ect.

  I SAVED this Vanagon from the PO.  He was a person that just drove it 
and drove it and still drove it!  I've found the bailing wire holding up 
the fiuel filter, american water hoses on it, ect.

  Just wanted you to all know that I'm a List-member and a Vanagon 
OWNER, not a Wannabuser, are you listening Joel?

  Thanks for letting me rant on, but I'm happy to be out of the Scirocco 
and into the Vanagon:)
