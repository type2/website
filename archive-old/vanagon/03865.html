sadly, the 71's and 73's are being lost to other pursuits, while those
sneaky eurovans are quietly gathering numbers over there in the upper
right corner. gotta watch them front-engined folks! :)

for all you Unknowns, this is what i do with the info that folks send
me about what they drive and where they are. :)

everybody have a good weekend. that's an order! ;)
