Subject: Thanks

This list is great.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I got tons of 
responses on the recent values of crew cabs y'all have seen out there.  I 
got pointed to the Edmunds Old Car price guide, then someone posted it to 
me.  I got advice on how to deal with insurance companies, and much more!!!!!

I've got to sort it all out.  I'm not unreasonable.  I'll do all my own 
work, but the settlement will buy the tools and parts......

Thanks again.  Opie feels worthwhile again.

Dean
