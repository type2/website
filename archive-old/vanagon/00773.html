Subject: Low idle speed when cold

Hello folks,

I've been gone for a couple of weeks with the Vanagon...it's running much better
with a good water coolant temperature sensor for the ECU installed.  As an aside, 
I asked my SO to call the VW dealer where I got my replacement part to confirm 
the price.  She couldn't remember exactly, but they said thrity-something 
dollars.  So, I think I got mine one time for cheap ...

Anyway there is one other small problem I'd like to ask about.  When the car first
cold starts in the morning the idle speed is 700 RPMs, or close to it.  
After the engine warms up the a bit the idle speed is 800 RPMs.  This is fine now 
in the summer (I'm in Boston), but in the winter I have to hold my foot on the gas 
pedal for a few minutes after cold starting to keep the engine from stalling.  
My '84 seemed to have a &quot;high idle&quot; which this '87 does not.
Any comments on the correct behavior or opinions of what might be wrong, and 
possible fix, are most appreciated.

PS  Joel, thanks for the fiche.  I'm building a homemade viewer with my 12 year 
son.  It's a great woodshop project for us.
