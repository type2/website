Subject: Re: Midwest Gathering

&gt;By coincidence, Gerry Skerbitz &amp; I have just been talking about the
&gt;possibility of, next year, trying to have some sort of gathering here in
&gt;south-central Iowa.
&gt;
&gt;Before you start screaming, southern Iowa is quite pretty--plenty of short,
&gt;steep grades to challenge those of us with the old upright engines, even.

Put me on the list to contact with specifics.  Took a really nice trip in 
the bus with my daughter a year ago last April.  On the way up, visited the 
Amish comminities around Kalona, the Field of Dreams, then on to the river 
road (Mississippi) in Wisconsin to the &quot;Little House&quot; log cabin at Pepin and 
surrounding area.  Came back down through Minnesota and Iowa to see the Bily 
Clock Museum, Dvorjak summer home, another &quot;Little House&quot; home (the theme of 
the trip!), the Capitol Building in Des Moines, etc.  (Oh, yes, - we also 
walked my old paper route in Charles City, and visited relatives, and saw 
three houses I used to live in.....)

Anyway, let me know.  It might be time to go again.

TIA,
