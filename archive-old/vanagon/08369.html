Yesterday, I wrote:

&gt;Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
&gt;plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
&gt;repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
&gt;white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
&gt;panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
&gt;be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.

and John Gladu responded:
&gt;You could also mimic the local transit company's bus paint scheme
&gt;(something that I'm seriously considering as Mr. Bozo's next coat of
&gt;paint).  The Houston buses say &quot;METRO&quot; - I'll make mine say &quot;MICRO&quot;.

Local transit company?  No no.  We live in a town of 68 people.  Having
2 Busses makes us the local transit company.  Therefore, anything goes  :)
