Subject: Parallel or Series and diode drops

&gt;I dis-agree, Bob has it right about batteries in series.  He also has it
&gt;right about the voltage drop across an iso unit as I can attest.  I just
&gt;installed one when I put the second battery in and my voltage has &gt;dropped from
14.5 to 13.4-8.  I am not particularly concerned about &gt;this but it is
interesting.

But Bob the Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com said:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Forget the idea of using two 6-volt batteries in series.  Dodge
&gt;&gt;tried it years ago and abandoned the idea as impractical.  The
&gt;&gt;problem is, no two batteries are identical, there will always be
&gt;&gt;a slight current flow between them unless they are physically
&gt;&gt;isolated (knife switch, etc) or you use expensive high-amperage,
&gt;&gt;low-loss diodes.

Well if the batteries are truly in series, the only current flowing through them
is the current going to the load.  Batteries in parallel will have circulating
current due to voltage differences.  This is the law (Kirchoff's not Ohm's) and
is basic to everything electrical.

As for the lower voltage due to the isolator, the forward drop of a diode is
typically 0.5 to 1.5 Volts, depending on the diode construction, current flow
through the diode, and temperature of the diode, so your drop of 0.7 to 1.1
Volts is normal, expected, and in spec.

peace,

               engineer to pay for the bus)
