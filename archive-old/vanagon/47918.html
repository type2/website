Subject: Bus Boys Center Console For Sale/Middle Seat also

hey now,

I've decided to sell the center console i bought for Rumba. it's black with
four cup holders, change holder and storage compartment. i believe it will
fit 72-79 models. it's been sitting in my van while the rebuild was being done.
nothing is wrong with it...i just don't think it is what i want. selling for
$85 plus shipping. bought it for $100.

i also have the middle seat for a '74 bus for sale. $15. hopefully if you want
it you are in nc cuz i don't think i'll ship it. i don't need it since i have
a westy interior in the van now.

drop me an email or page me at 919-508-4303 if interested.

thanks!

jonathan '74 Retrowestie Rumba (it runs now! :-) )
