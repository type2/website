Subject: Re: Eurovan: oil over-fill
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 94 9:56:04 PDT

&gt; I have had a small oil leak since I had my oil changed at Jiffy Lube by
&gt; a couple of HS students. I should have suppected a problem when I had
&gt; to get under the van and show them how to get the access plate off to
&gt; get to the filter.  At one point, the manager also was up under the van
&gt; as well.  When the dip stick was shown to me when the job was finished,
&gt; it appeared that the oil level was correct.

	It's not cost effective for me to change my own oil, so I go to
	Oil Can Henry's, BUT, I supply my own oil in quarts. That way,
	they're less likely to overfill.
