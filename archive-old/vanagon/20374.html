Subject: RE: peanut butter storage in Campers

Peanut Butter is one of those 'staples&quot; I would not allow to be absent from my camper.

You'd be (maybe) amazed at the things I've done with peanut butter, particuarly at the 
last minute!  (No I won't go into them) :)

I try to keep an unopened container in place. I checked with one of the manufacturer's 
&quot;food advisors&quot; and was told that as long as the unit was vacum sealed the peanut 
butter should last for a very, very long time. Once the unit is opened (or the vacum 
seal punctured) the peanut butter should be consumed with some reasonable dispatch 
(several weeks-to-months).

I have (when the family allows it to stay at rest) kept a jar around for an entire 
summer (approx. 4 months) with varying frequencies of opening and closing the jar. I 
leave it in a cool place or, at least, out of direct sunlight. After a few months of this, I 
get the 'stale' taste and want to dispose of it.

If you've had it there for a long, long time ... I would:

Get rid of it.
===================================
or

Check your medical insurance stipulation(s).

Get married, if you are not.

Assemble a witness or two for the next 24 to 48 hours.

Place an AD in your local newpaper, with the stipulation that if you do not call by the 
last minute deadline, the AD should be published.

Make a sandwhich and consume a generous portion.
=======================================

The result of this last action, if you should elect to follow it, would be, either:

1. You'll have a stale taste in your mouth for a while but you'll know for sure.

2. Your digestive system will let you know, for sure!

3. You won't be around to care but there'll be witnesses to attest your demise was not 
due to foul-play and ...the world will know!  Additinoally, everyone will be notified 
there's a new &quot;Rich-Widow&quot; available for companionship and 'grief-relief&quot;. :)

Hope this helps.
