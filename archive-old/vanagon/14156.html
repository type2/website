Subject: Re: cheap fix to vanagon hesitation problem (harness fix)

	Do you know how to fix this problem in a '71 bus. I'm having the same 
symptoms. stalling after long periods of driving and hesitation when 
doing in town driving with a lot of stop and go movement.
	Any advice would be helpful. 
			Thanks
