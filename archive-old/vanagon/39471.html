That should teach you a lesson about women!  But, at least she's selling it
back to you.  I'm interested but I won't be in your neiborhood for 3 to 6
weeks.  *My girlfreind wants a bug*...However, if I bought it for her, I'm
SURE I would regret it later.  Maybe I could just let her drive it and that
way she wouldn't DARE leave me ;)

&gt;Howdy all. I will spare you all the long sob story, but I shall just say that
&gt;an old girlfriend of mine, who decided I was unworthy of her company, has now
&gt;decided that her bug that I built for her is unworthy as well. Since I paid for
&gt;pretty much everything to begin with, she is selling it back to me instead of
&gt;someone else.
