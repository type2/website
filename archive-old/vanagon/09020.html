Subject: Re: cops and busses

&gt;From: Bradley &lt;bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com&gt;:
&gt;told me to get them fixed and let me go.  The only other response I've had
&gt;from cops is that one drove in front of me and laughed when he saw my bus. 
&gt;I don't really think it's funny looking... much.

Well, my bus is funny looking.  Because I'm a ham radio operator, I have all
sorts of appendages hanging off it at odd angles.  One day tooling from San
Jose to Sacramento on the freeway, I got pulled by the CHiPs.  The guy said
I was over the limit of 6-inch protrusions from the side of the vehicle.  He
said he usually only gets people with surfboards for this one.  He wanted me
to take the antenna off right there in the middle of the freeway.  When I 
told him it would take me a half-hour to do it, he said to take it off as
soon as I reach my destination.  (I took a different route home.)  Nobody
ever hassled me about it before or since across several western states.
