Subject: Re: key numbers

During the long period in which I had the motor out of my
then-recently-purchased '76 I managed to lose the only copy of my ignition
key. After calling down many curses from the sky I had the idea of looking
through the owner's manual for code. Good Fortune! The original owner wrote
the key-code in the &quot;key&quot; section of the manual. Now, all the dealers I
contacted swore up and down that this was not a valid code. It looked
something like this...
                                   ##L###    # = number, L = letter
What I did was I gave that code to a locksmith that had a computer database
of key codes and the key was cut in a matter of minutes. This is cheaper than
bringing the lock in and having them &quot;fit&quot; a key.
