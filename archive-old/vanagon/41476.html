Subject: Wipers wont work

All,

Today while driving to class it started to rain, turned on the wipers,
and after about 5 minutes of operation they stopped.  When I got to
school I checked them out a little, and I found that when both blades
are pulled away from the window they will work, but I can stop them with
little force.  When I put one or both blades against the window they
stop.  I got in(getting wet and all) and turned the switch I could here
the motor running but no action from the arms.  This is for my 79 Westy.

suggestions, comments, helpful hints etc appreciated.

Also, if I am not mistaken, the dash has to come out to get to the wiper
mechanism right?:-(

Waiting with wetted windshield,

David
