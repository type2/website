&gt;&gt; Hi Vanapeople!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is there some way I can get my pass. seat's arm rests back on!?!?  or
&gt;&gt; should I take it to a pro? what dya think they cost?!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;      The armrests are held on by what I believe VW calls a cotter
&gt;pin (cheap). It's a hollow pin a couple of inches long that must be
&gt;pounded through the hole in the metal bracke tin the arm rest itself,
&gt;and the hole in the round knob of the bracket on the seat.  The
&gt;downside is that the holes have to be lined up, and the operation
&gt;performed in the very limited space between the back of the armrest
&gt;and the side of the seatback by compressing the foam padding and
&gt;cursing at regular intervals.

Arm rests turn on a post - they are held on the post with a hex-socket bolt
hidden beneath the round plastic cover, which easily pops off (and rolls
out the door).  The post bracket is attached to the seat with a few screws.
If the bracket is loose, you need to take of the arm to get access to the
screws.

If the post is broken off the bracket, take it all off and get it welded
back together.  Or get a new one.

No cursing necessary.
