Subject: She's parked, need advice...


Ok, here's the scoop.  I've got a 1980 westy that I can't get started.  
It will start right up, but then die just as fast.

I checked the oil, gas, battery, and even changed the fuel filter.  No 
luck.  So now I don't know whether to replace the fuel pump or not.

There is an import auto parts place that has one for around $200.  Or 
there is a Parts America that has a &quot;universal&quot; one for $30, but I'm not 
sure about that.

Should I fork out he $200?  Could I get one used at a junk yard, or is 
that not a good idea?

What do you think?  

Kyle
