Probably should have clarified, but I cross-posted this from vintagvw.
It's not my neighbor, mane :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   My neighbor has a nice three door pickup in his shed that
&gt; &gt;   he said he'd like to sell. The gates are rusty, but that
&gt; &gt;   seems like about all. It has no engine at the moment.
&gt; &gt;   Oh yeah, I think it's a '63. It is in WA state near Portland
&gt; &gt;   OR. It is very important to him that it goes to a good home.
&gt; &gt;   E-mail me for details.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you mean a double-cab? I'd love one, but the logistics seem to be
&gt; against me. Depends how quickly he wants to sell; I could tow it over
&gt; X-mas, but probably not sooner. Also, are there any pictures? And what's
&gt; the asking price? :) TIA!

&gt; 
&gt; PS: Btw, I'll be glad to scan and post any pix on the web.
