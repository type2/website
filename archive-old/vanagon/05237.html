&gt; What's the purpose of those &quot;cab separators&quot; or whatchamacallit panels
&gt; behind the 2 front seats? They would be in my way if I wanted to install
&gt; nicer and probably bigger seats, wouldn't they?
&gt; 
&gt; Can I just saw them off or would that compromise structural integrity?
&gt; 
Someone kindly (?) did that to my '67 before I got it, so it is now a
walk through of sorts... I know those were stopped in I think '77, since
my '78 didn't have them. The main purpose fir them, I think, is so in a
rear-end collision, the seat won't snap backwards. I read a book
strongly disparaging the safety of Beetles (called The Small Wonder -
Small on Safety I think), and it told of how in rear-end collisions,
seats would snap backwards, and passengers could fly out the back
window. This was documented for Beetles. Of course, the short chapter on
buses said almost exactly &quot;Get 'em off the road - they're totally
unsafe&quot;
Oh well, off I drive to die horribly someday... :)
