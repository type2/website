Subject: Re: Industrial Motors/air compressors




&gt; 
&gt; While we're on the topic, does anyone have any info on using a VW engine
&gt; in-tact as an air compressor? Is it possible to screw a fitting into one
&gt; of the spark plug holes and inflate a tire (without hurting your engine)?

i dunno if this hurts your engine or not but i have heard of such a gadget in 
use, i guess they were offered back in the 60's dunno if it was a factory option 
or not?

thoughts?
