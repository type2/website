Subject: High Idle problem, help!

My 87 Westie is in winter storage but I start it once in awhile in the
gararge to make me feel better about these Wisconsin winters.  Well I just
started it and the engine reved to 4,000 rpm plus!  I restarted it and the
same thing happened.  No matter what I do I can't get the idle down.

Is something stuck?  I checked the accel. cable and it doesn't seem to me
stuck.
Any thoughts appreciated,

Thanks,
Ajax 87 Westy
