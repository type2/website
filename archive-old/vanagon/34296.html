I received in the mail yesterday my JCWhitney VW catalog.  In it they 
show an air filter for my Weber DFEV 32/36.  One model is paper and 
about $4.  The other is cotton/gauze and is about $6.  It is claimed 
to be reusable.  Any comments on these or other filters for this 
carburetor?  The only one I can find locally is at a speed 
shop and they want $20 for it.  This, again, is one I can clean and 
reuse.  If the cheap ones filter effectively I wouldn't mind just 
throwing on a new one every few thousand miles.  Of course, I am a guy
who likes to change his oil every 1,000 miles.  I didn't trust GEX to 
tap the case for a filter.  Thanks, Jim
