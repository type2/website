Actually, the only real 5 speed transmissions were on some 1982 &amp; 1983
Vanagon Diesel models.  The gearing and bellhousing are specifically suited
to the diesel engine.  The Syncros use a &quot;4 speed + low&quot; transmission where
there are only 4 normal gears and the extra low gear for getting unstuck, or
off-roading.
