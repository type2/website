So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	Is there anything else *you'd* do if you had the engine out?
&gt; 
&gt; Detail as much of the surrounding area as you can.  This is you big chance.
&gt; You might also consider  putting in new motor mounts, the rubber pieces that
&gt; go on the bottom of the tranny on the fram horn.
&gt; 

I don't know who the original poster was, but as long as the money is flowing
you may as well yank the gas tank out too and clean it out and if the gas 
guage wasn't working properly, then this is the time to fix it.  

The main thing is that with the engine/tranny out, you have excellent access
to alot of thing that are either inaccessible or a PITA to get to/fix other-
wise.  So have at it and you'll have more peace-of-mind when you drive.

That's all,

Steven
