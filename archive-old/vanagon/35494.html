&gt;Anyone else have any sources for this type of &quot;normal-replacement&quot; item?
&gt;I saw a reference some time back about parts from Walser VW in AZ offered
&gt;at 20% over cost.  I haven't called them yet, as I'm wondering if folks
&gt;have found other non-VW sources for brake items.

Take them off and go to a local brake specialist in your area,(yellow pages).
 You can have them re-lined.  The originals are a semi-mettalic.  Ask for the
same materila if possible.  VW used mettalic shoes on the vans,(yes the
rears) starting in 86.
