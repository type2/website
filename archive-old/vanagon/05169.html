Subject:      a Tyre, a Tyre! My Kingdom for a Tyre!

ok. this is what i've &quot;collected&quot; so far. one thing that seems to be showing
up is that camper-folks do NOT like the reinforced car tires, but seem to
like the Light Truck tires. makes sense: campers weigh more and are more top-
heavy.   also personal driving 'style' (as Gallagher would say) likely has
a lot to do with how 'good' a set of tires 'feels' as the Good Bus Bollytrop
careens around yet another corner.

so maybe we ought to separate this by camper and non-camper?  at the very
least, it is a starting point for someone looking for tires ... at least
they know the brands/size/models of some tires that fit the buses and that
other people have used. but other than that, it's somewhat like &quot;what's the
Best Year for a VW Bus?&quot; ... and we all know how THAT goes. :)
