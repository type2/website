Subject:      '81 thermostat necessary?

I am putting a rebuilt engine into my '81.  Several people (including the
parts manager at VW) have told me I would be better off not bothering with
the thermostat.  Some have said to just wire the flappers open.  The guy at
VW said to just remove the flappers completely.

Has anybody done this?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  I live
in Arizona, where it doesn't get too cold, and when it does, I won't be
going camping.

Thanks,

Bill                    (Bill_at_freeholder_dot_com)
