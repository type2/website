Subject: RE: Help finding an engine


&gt;I am in need of an engine as faithful readers are already aware.  I would
&gt;like to get one that matches the year of my bus (1969).  Does anyone have
&gt;any suggestions?  For junkyard/dismantler suggestions I am in Northern
&gt;California in Stockton which is 1 hour south of Sacramento.


Well, I've found that an '81 Chevy 2800 V6 fits fine... and suits the car
much better than the original VW engine!   :^)

No, I'm NOT kidding...
