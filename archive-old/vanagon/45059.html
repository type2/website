Subject: on  Dormobiles


&gt;Gotta ask-- what is a Dormobile? An English/European version of a Kombi?
&gt;Inquiring minds want to know.

It is/was the camping conversion by Martin Walter of Folkestone, England.
The Dormobile roof was also put onto some Devon campers. It's the one which
elevates up hinged along one side of the van, with stripey red canvas and
glass windows in it. The complete Dormobile conversion is rare -- apparently
only 4 splitty ones in the U.K. I've never seen another one. Unfortunately
mine 
has had some 'home improvements' made to it in the past &amp; is incomplete. 
I'm hoping to add a Dormobile page to my website some time soon. If there 
are any other Dormobile owners out there (not just splitties), get in touch.

dormobiles were buildt on sunroof combi bodies, the pop top is that big.
  there are also two cots upstairs, in addition to which ever kit is
downstairs.    I've seen a couple nice dormobiles with SO42 and SO44 westy
interiors, but not one with the complete dormobile interior.

there is a nifty skylight or two in the roof, so it is nice and light inside.
  i have heard that the plasticy canvas doesn't breathe very well and it can
get kinda steamy in one of those  :)
