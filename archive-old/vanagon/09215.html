Subject: '56 kombi tranny - what might be wrong
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 1995 14:44:01 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

I went and talked to the place I bought the tranny from about the problem 
I was having.  I ended up talking with the owner of carter's gearbox shop,
and it comes down to this:

	A) I might have a stuck synchro, which would be cured by putting it
in reverse.

	B) The fulcrum plates might have slipped behind the axle when I was
putting it together.  THis would explane the leak (excessive clearance)
and the stiff rear end.

	I am now resigned ot taking it all apart again, but actually I only 
have to crack one reduction box, so it shouldn't be _too_ bad.  We'll see.
