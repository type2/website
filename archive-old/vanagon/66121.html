Subject:      Old, New, Wait - Help....

I've not yet found my 'dream machine' yet - a moderately-milaged
syncro Adventurewagen (got one???)...and I'm trying to decide if I should:

        A)  buy an available '87 syncro w/ _at_130 K miles on it
                in 'OK' shape
        ii) buy a 'good' non-syncro and wait for a syncro to come around
        3)  wait and trust my stars that one will surface in the next
                few months.

Regarding 'A' (which has had no major work done on it), what can i expect
to go wrong &amp; how soon &amp; how much $$?  I'd guess an engine within
40K miles (?) tranny at 200k (?)....?  How long does the
viscous synro coupling last?  What else is probably needing work judging
by the miles (i'll take it into a mechanic for a look-see when/if i get
serious about buying it).  Are how much more costly to maintain or
tempermental are these here syncros?  Are they worth it?

What do you think?

thanks

Stephen
