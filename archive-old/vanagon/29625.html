&gt; So I made my first significant trip in my '77 camper this weekend, to Death 
&gt; Valley.  Actually, I only made it as far as Barstow because my starter 
&gt; solenoid got stuck at a gas station.  The handy advice in the Idiot's Guide 
&gt; worked like a charm to get me started again, but I abandoned the trip since 
&gt; I didn't think Daeth Valley was the right place to be headed without 
&gt; feeling pretty comfortable about vehicle reliability!
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I'm running again my questions are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  How often can I expect the solenoid to stick from now on?

Every time you're dressed up, in a hurry, or when it's dark and cold
outside.  :)

&gt; 2.  Is this a sign it going to fail permanently soon?

No.  Mine has been that way for years!

&gt; 3.  How much will it cost me to get it fixed if it does fail?

Probably the price of a rebuilt starter/solenoid.  Maybe 100 bucks?
