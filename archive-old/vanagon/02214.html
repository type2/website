Subject: Re: Late nighter's and early risers (trip talk)

Since I've been in both camps from time-to-time, I've had feelings about
and for the 'other' camp.

I would expect that we'd publish (and frequently) up date an agenda for
the short-term.

The 'early' group(s) can be about the business as they like;
the 'late' groups(s) can get up, pack up, saddle up and catch up as they like.

Not only should this apply to those who may be in the 'early' or 'late'
camps but as the trip moves there will be combinations of people and
places that will be more attractive to some than to others (read that to
mean some people may split away from the main cluster to spend a bit more
time in one place as opposed to another).
