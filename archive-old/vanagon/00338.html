&gt;To which Ric Golen, defender of EuroVans replies:

They need a lot of defending.

&gt;1986 Caravan (neighbor's shit box):

Measure the long wheel base model

&gt;What I see here is one of two things. The first VWUS is doing a piss-
&gt;poor job of selling their product, or at least informing the buyer
&gt;about the product and how it is different, better than other vans; or
&gt;the second, most of you are taking your positions in this &quot;discussion&quot;
&gt;with little or no factual or actual EV experience. I will assume that
&gt;it is the former not the latter.

VWUS can do nothing when they have a van that nobody wants, just look at the
sales figures. I looked and drove the Eurovan and I kept going, putting that
dog Audi 5cyl engine in it did nothing for it. It sounds like a truck and
just is not refined as the Chrysler vans... Explain to me why Chrysler has
over 50% of the market and one of the highest percentages of return buyers.
VW has been building crap for a few years now, especially what the Mexicans
build.

&gt;As to the &quot;minivan&quot; designation, we all know how RELIABLE Consumer
&gt;Reports is when it comes to VWs. On the dealer sticker for the EV
 
Consumer reports does not like to see people get burned and with VW's track
record they are just telling the truth...I cannot believe that they llike
