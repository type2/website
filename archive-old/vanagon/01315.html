Subject: Re: Porcupines in Pantyhose. Barbecued Brake Lines. Inquiring minds

&gt;lemme see here now ... we've got porcupines eating tires and brake lines.
&gt;we've got Ralf and Jim working on vw's in panties and a braaaaa ... and
&gt;we've got the rubber-hose-fan-belt-brake-line-eating Little Foot out in
&gt;the woods who makes you drag a log to get down the mountain if you didn't
&gt;bring the concertina wire to surround your car.
&gt;
&gt;are you guys SURE it's not Friday?

OF COURSE WE'RE SURE.

Don't you know.............

IT'S SUMMER.
Let's go camping.
