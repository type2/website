&gt; I confess. On behalf of my 1965 VW EZCamper, I am on the vanagon list. We

Cool... so you're gonna go to the Camping trip at Red Rock next 
weekend... right?  It's in your neck of the wood, so to speak.
Last trip, I had the oldest and ugliest bus.  I'd like to see some other 
split window buses there.

And speaking of the Red Rock (lobster)... I, as well as Martha and perhaps 
Sam (sglw_at_aol_dot_com), might be driving down on Thursday evening from the 
Bay Area.   Personally, I'd like a place to sleep that wasn't a rest 
stop.  So, anyone want to offer a driveway or a curb late that night?
