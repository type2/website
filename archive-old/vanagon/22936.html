&gt;           shop owner wants to sell but doesn't know how to price.  i
&gt;           told about this list and he actually suggested i inquire as
&gt;           to it's value with y'all and bring him a reasonable dollar
&gt;           amount.  i got him to take it inside out of the elements and
&gt;           it awaits.  so, anyone got any ideas as to value?  i'm lost
&gt;           but want the darn thing.  thanks   ray  gainesville, fl
&gt;           oh yeah, it's the big table that folds up on the driver's
&gt;           side about midway back.

So a wise acre who knows nothing about the relative value says $1.98.  To 
make the buyer happy and $200.00 to make the seller happy.  Okay I'll 
shut up now.
