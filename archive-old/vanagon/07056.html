Subject: Hot Tip Subaru Motor

Actually, I am under the impression that the Subaru engine is the hot tip for
water cooled Vanagons since their motors are similar and will fit in the
space without raising the engine cover or cutting through it. 

I remember a fellow in Canada describing his Subaru-into-a-Vanagon setup in
an eary isssue of the Limbo VW Van newsletter.

I wonder what the gain is from such a conversion though.
