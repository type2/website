Subject:      More syncro questions

First off, thanks to all who responded to my initial tire and exhaust
questions - I really appreciate it.

As you can imagine new questions pop up every day.
Here are a few more - I'll try to keep them short and to the point.

1. My locking rear diff. works fine, w/ a short delay before it kicks in
which I assume is normal.  My question is in regards to the indicator
lights, there is one for the rear diff. but there are also two others.
Were center and front diff. locks an option?  If not, what are these
for?

2.  Seam rust.  I'm surprised how little of it there is on a car that
has lived out its existence on the east coast but I'd like to take care
of it before it really takes off.  Can anyone give me any suggestions or
advice on how to fix this problem?

Thanks,

Dave Dempsey
