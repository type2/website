Ron Salmon asks:

&gt;
&gt;I am trying to locate a campsite somewhere between Santa Cruz 
&gt;and San Francisco that we can reserve for the holiday weekend. Even 
&gt;this early, some are booked up, and others don't take reservations.


Big Basin State Park off Hwy 9 between Santa Cruz and San Jose gets
my vote.  Big redwoods,  streams, miles of hiking paths, some bike
trails, waterfall(s), flushing toilets, shower facilities...what more
could a city slicker want?   :-)  Oh, and I thought the camp fees were
pretty reasonable too (at least they were a couple years ago).
