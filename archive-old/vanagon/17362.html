&gt; His first inclination was to get a ring and valve job done and stop there.  I
&gt; said that my experience with the aircooled engines (Type I) was that if you do
&gt; the top end on an old engine, you should also do the bottom end.  

Probably true for type I's, but the type IV &quot;bottom end&quot; has a reputation 
for being extremely strong.  For a low buck rebuild, I think you would be
okay leaving the bottom end alone, as long as there hasn't been any sort
of catestrophic failure that would introduce fragments of metal into the
oil.

&gt; So what's the consensus out there, should he:

&gt; 1) Have his mechanic put in a GEX rebuild, or

	Probably the safest option, probably not the cheapest, though.

&gt; 2) Have his mechanic decide if a bottom job is needed, or

	If you trust the mechanic, this is the option I would choose.
