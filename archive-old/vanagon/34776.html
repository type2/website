Subject: EV - fan resistors

Did you EV folks with the fan resistor problem notice a major increase
in coolant temp (as indicated by the gauge) when the resistor(s) burned
out?  Hopefully there's an indication before the AC, etc. is going to blow!

(BTW Hal, VW of Attleboro is where I bought my EV.  I don't live too close 
to there so haven't used them for service.  But if they're good (are they?)
I'd like to know...)

On another subject, VWoA has agreed to cover 50% on replacement of
coolant tube supplying the aux. heater.  For the benefit of those EVers
that haven't followed that string, there's a hairline crack in one of the
plastic tubes (it's actually two connected tubes - supply and return).  
Another lister has had the exact same problem, and it cost him dearly to have
it fixed.  Further details available upon request...
