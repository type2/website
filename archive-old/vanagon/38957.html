&gt;   At first starting out cold I would think that's OK. But after they

&gt;   to stay high (2000 rpm in the 2 wheel). The colder it is the more
&gt;   the idle will creep up from 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm. Man is this killing
&gt;   my gas milage! The only fix I could find (for the 2 wheel drive)was to
&gt;   pinch off the idle stablizer valve. After I did that the only problem
&gt;   was, at cold startup It won't idle at all. Once warm It run better
&gt;   than any stock Vanagon. 
&gt;
&gt;  I have done the following: replaced throttle position switch with
&gt;    up date. Check for the obvious vacuum leaks. Complete tune up
&gt;    check. Check for cloggs in preheating. What am I missing??? 
&gt;      Any Ideas???      ERic ZEno

You either have a bad valve or there is a problem eith the idle speed
controller.  Unplug the valve, if the idles does not drop, the valve is bad.
If the valve checks good, check the idle speed controller. It is mounted in
front of the reght rear tailight.  Make sure the Oxygen sensor circuit is
working correctly also.  A slightly rich mixture will cause a fast idle that
the idle controller may not be able to controll.
