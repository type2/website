&gt; opinion first. any help would be gratfully apreciated-I want to keep this
&gt; &quot;Noble Beast&quot; running for at least 10 more years.

In the part of Canada where we live, the road warriors use lots of salt
on the roads. It is impossible to keep the van from developing some form
of rust. What is very popular here is a yearly oil spray with rust
inhibitors. The oil is light enough to penetrate the seams where real
nasty rust starts and sticky enough to stay there. This process almost
completely stops the rust but does nothing to hide it. For example my
1980 Saab 99 GL has only two rust spots and they are not growing. The
most popular companies that perform this spraying are &quot;RustCheck&quot; and
&quot;Krown&quot; (Krown was formed by ex-RustCheck franchizers)
