Subject: Re: Midwest Gathering

There had been some discussion that the Fall version of Busses By The 
Arch in O'Fallon, MO, might not happen (or at least not at the old site - 
Ft.Zumwalt Park).  Fear not!  I spoke with Bill Bowman today and he said 
that they have a new site (a private campground) approx. 6 miles from the 
old site.  The rates are only a little higher.  He will have more details 
soon and will send a flyer to those on his mailing list.  I, or someone, 
will post the details as they become available.  The Midwest Gathering 
lives! ;-)
