Subject: 82 Vgon supplemental heater questions

Hi all, 
I have an 82 vanagon, AC I must admit but still a vanagon.  I have a
question about the gas powered heater in the vanagons.  This is the one
that operates by the green switch on the dash with TEMP on it.   I think
they were intended to supplement the heat while the engine warmed??  
I have owned the van for 1.5 years now and fired it up once.  Black
smoke and soot poured into the passenger compartment, it wasn't warm
and cozy but smelly and dangerous. I have never used it since.

My question is how good are these for heat?  Are they reliable?, fire
hazards? , what maintenance do they require? Are they repairable?
Should I disect mine to check it out?  Do people use them for heat?  Is
there hope for this one?  Any insight or other info you may have would
be appreciated.  Are these the same as the BN4 or BN6s I see talked
about on the type II list?

Thanks for your help in advance
