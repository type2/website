Subject: RE: Bad Temp Sensor?


I had a problem similar to what you describe in my '80 Westy.  Ran fine when
cold, then faster (up to 4000 rpm) when warm.  Had a mechanic look at it and
he found that when we disconnected the D-valve (part of the vacuum system),
the idle remained low.  Wish I could tell you more about it but since I
punted on this one that's all i know.  Oh, the D-valve is located at the
front, passenger side of the engine compartment, looking down on the engine
from the hatch.

&gt;
&gt;My 82 Westy has developed a strange problem that I hope some of ya'll
&gt;can help me with.  When the engine is cold, it starts and drives OK. 
&gt;But as it warms up (either the weather or the engine) it begins to run
&gt;faster and richer until it just begins to dump gas into the cylinders. 
&gt;It begins to smoke and runs really rough.  I believe that it is some
&gt;sort of temperature sensor that is going (or has gone) bad. 
&gt;Unfortunately, I dont have a Bentley book yet and I dont know where the
&gt;sensor is and how I can check it.  I have checked all the connectors off
&gt;of the pig-tail and with the exception of taping up a few breaks in the
&gt;insulation, there seems to be no broken or disconnected wires.  Can
&gt;anyone give me some insight or instructions?
&gt;Thanks, Chaz
