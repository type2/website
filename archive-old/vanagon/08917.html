For my 1971 Dark Blue VW bus (not my '71 White/Blue bus):

I need help in finding a deal on a transmission.
The last time I bought a rebuilt one was about 7
years ago and it cost me $350 here in San Diego.

As you probably know, transmissions were nearly identical
from 1968-1972. The 1971-72 group has a different bell-
housing and a different release bearing. So if I use
anything from before 1971 I have to swap the bell
housing or use the old release bearing and clutch.

What should a rebuilt tranny cost outright? My trade-in
might not be rebuildable. On the other hand, a good used
tranny mught be better, since the rebuilt one that I bought
last time only lasted 7 years.


Any help will be appreciated.
