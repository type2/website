&lt;&lt; I'd figure anywhere between $2000 and $4000 minus $10 for every braid in
 the Roy Rodgers rope.  ;) &gt;&gt;

&gt;According to my black book the deduct for Roy Rodgers style rope is $7.50 per
&gt;braid, this is of course a mid-west edition price guide.  The deduct may vary
&gt;from region to region.

Things are starting to look better. I might make some money back after all.
Did I mention this was hemp rope and not the poly kind :-)
