Anyone saw last night's episode of Deep Space 9? Twas part 2 of a
two-parter. Major Kira and Chief O'Brien beam back into time into the late
sixties in San Francisco. They can't hear each other because Jimi
Hendricks is being played real loud in a nearby basement bar. They're also
standing next to rocking(!) VW bus. Two stoned hippies get out and
hand them flowers. At that moment, they're beamed back to their spacecraft
and the flower kids think that waaayyy cooooll!
