Subject: EV Wipers

Well, the EV manual isn't as bad as my reading 
comprehension!  After the discussion about programmable 
wipers on the list, I thought I should check it out.  Lo and 
behold! - a programmable interval from 1 to 22 seconds!  And 
a totally intuitive control system!

So I went back to the manual, and there it was.

As they say in the world of software, RTFM!
