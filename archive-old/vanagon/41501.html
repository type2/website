Subject: Urgent Bus SOS!!

I need help in Tacoma, WA with my '78 FI bus!  I'm supposed to take a 
friend home to California, and another to Colorado at the end of the week 
before returing myself home to Texas, but the bus is not healthy for some 
mysterious reason, and I need help to get on the road by Friday afternoon..

Here's the story:
  Last night, I tried to take my girlfriend out to dinner, and as I give 
the van gas to back up, it dies.  I restart and try again, and every time 
I give it gas, it dies. &quot;Hmmm...&quot;  Thinks I, just before borrowing a 
friend's car for the date.

  Earlier in the day, I had reset the point gap.  Today, I again checked 
the points (seem fine), then the valves (again, fine), then I replaced a 
vaccum tube that I had duct-taped, then I put a new gasket on the 
air-intake maifold for #3 and #4.  Now, it runs even wors, like it's not 
firing on all four.  It also dies whenever I press on the gas.

  There's no nasty metal on metal sounds, so I don't think it's a serious 
mechanical problem.  In fact, my first guess is it's a timing issue, or 
some sort of fuel injection caliberation issue.   But I don't know what 
exactly it is.  

  The bus got me up here, and it's gotten me around all year.  I'd sure 
love to be able to go home for the summer, too.

  So, first, I'm gonna check to see if the seals came off from around the 
injectors on 3 and 4 while I had them off, and then I guess I'll put the 
old vacuum tube back on.  I would be really, really grateful if you all 
could help, and even more grateful if someone who knows busses can come 
give her a look and help me fix whatever the problem is.

  AARRGG!! only one week left, and of course it's finals time!!

Thanks in advance,
Ben Heavner
