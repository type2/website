Subject: Re: R-12 Replacement for Vanagon AC

&gt;Joel Walker recently posted a article about a replacement for R-12.  Has
&gt;anyone had experince with this &quot;stuff&quot;?

I have been visiting the R-406A/GHG-X4 web page every now and then to see
what it up with that product, but I don't know if this is the &quot;stuff&quot; that
Joel was referring to. R-406A and GHG-X4 are replacements for R-12 that are
fully compatible with R-12 systems. R-406A is already approved for &quot;stationary/
transport (cargo) refrigeration&quot;. GHG-X4, a variation for automotive AC
systems, has been submitted to EPA for mobile (automotive) approval. GHG-X4
has also been submitted to ASHRAE for an R number and safety classification.

My dealer quoted me a price of about $125 for recharging my Vanagon's AC.
Ouch!!  I am anxiously waiting to see what GHG-X4 will cost and for its EPA
approval...

If anyone wants to visit the R-406A/GHG-X4 web page, it's URL is
http://worldserver_dot_com/R406A. I have no connection with the company at all...
