&gt;	Yes, Jim I think you're right.  You were trying to be helpful and 
&gt;the recipient of your info should probably been a tad more gracious, 
&gt;whether he was going to use the listings or not.  Please don't let this 
&gt;turn you off being helpful though.  Those of use who live in the rust 
&gt;belt have to look south for good vehicles to restore and drive.  Keep up 
&gt;the good work.  Kudos!
