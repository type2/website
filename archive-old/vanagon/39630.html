Hello,

I'm trying to help a friend unload a severely damaged van.  She rolled =
her 1967 camper last year.  The engine survived and is relatively new (I =
don't know, when it was rebuilt but I'll get the specifics if anyone is =
interested.)  Here's what I do know. =20

Camper Van 1967=20
1600 CC
40 hp
single port heads
Natural Pancake engine.

Salvageable Accessories:

I think this is a Sunbeam Camper package (how can I tell????)

Seatbelts
Side Door Hatch
911 rubber moldings
Awning
Steering Column and box
heat vent tube
tail light housing
All the glass
Ashtray
Saffire Radio
67 rear view mirror (long or double wide)
VW emblem
67 front bumper
rubber mats for sides
seats   (front bench)
rear hatch door
engine door
barn doors (scratched but saveable, I think)
door handles
67 transaxle and 69 motor....

That's all know....so far....if there's any interest, pose the questions =
and I'll do the best I can to post an answer...

OR, If anyone has a 1967 body that needs the engine, etc, my friend =
might want to buy your bus and use her parts in a restoration..
