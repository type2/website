&gt; Ok I found out yesterday that my '64 bus has an early bug transmission in
&gt; it.  The reductions boxes are UP SIDE DOWN, to make it go foward not 4
&gt; speeds backwards (which would be kewl anyway).  So how do I fix my e-brake
&gt; cables?  The cables are just hanging there and the holes in the backing
&gt; plates are on the wrong side.  Can I just switch sides (the plate sides)  or
&gt; is it recommened I cut holes in the plates to put the cable through.  Also
&gt; what type of problem will I have with putting new brakes in.  The current
&gt; ones don't have the e-brake levers.
&gt; 
&gt; I was also told this type of setup is a strong at hell, is that true?
&gt; 
This sounds ridiculous!  I imagine the oil in the boxes would have a hard 
time lubing the brgs as VW intended.  I would swap the ring&amp; pinion and 
get things put back as they were intended to be, IMHO.
