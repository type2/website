Subject: And Still MORE #_at_!! Filter/Pumps






To All:

I wasted the afternoon visiting three VW parts places, where I examined a
total of five bubble-packed filter/pumps.  All were -.005 to -.0055 too
small.  At one place the owner took exception to my conclusions, boldly
plugged the thing into a new engine case.  It rattled.  He insisted it would
be fine with a bit of sealant.  I offered him a stock pump I'd brought along
for comparison but he'd lost interest by then.  

One of the pumps I examined was from the back room, apparantly returned.  I
got the impression they were aware of  the problem.   The sight of a customer
pulling out a micrometer drew a crowd at two of the places. 

Does anyone know how we can bring this problem to the attention of the
magazines without stuffing one of the pumps down the cleveage of a semi-nude
girl and having her sprawl across the editors desk?  I've reported similar
problems (hydraulic lifters, distributors) to Dune Buggies &amp; HOT VW magazine
in the past without acknowledgement nor seeing anything of it in their
'technical' column.

I've now personally handled ten of these suckers.  Nine of them were too
small.  That's a 90% failure rate.  If it hadn't of said 'Taiwan' right there
on the package I would have sworn it was from Detroit.  So don't buy them.
 But if you absolutely positively gotta have one of these things, take your
mike and check it first.  And stop buying them from J. C. Whitney, period.
 By the time you check it and return it, you could have cast the metal and
made one from scratch.

PS  -- The five I checked were priced from $65 to $39.95.  Same part, same
bubble package.  Whatever you buy, it pays to shop around.
