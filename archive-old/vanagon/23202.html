Subject: Re: CV Boots/Bolts Question



&gt;&gt; fit anymore. then i tried with some vise grips. no give. then i tried
&gt;&gt; saturating it with WD40. no give. any suggestions? i'm guessing if i 
can't
&gt;&gt;get
&gt;
&gt;     Soak 'em in WD40, wait five minute, take something suitable
&gt;     and give them one distinct, concise tap each. Wait thirty seconds.
&gt;     Try it again. I haven't tried it with CVs but with more than
&gt;     one other recalcitrant bolt...


In my '69 Bus many years ago, its CV bolts were hex socket bolts,
needing an allen wrench to get them off. Don't know if yours are
the same.

I did the WD-40 thing overnight, then a sharp tap, then more WD-40,
then put my allen wrench on, and a 10&quot; crescent wrench on the allen
wrench. This got them all off. I didn't break the allen wrench (it
was a Sears Craftsman), but I probably came pretty close a few times.
I _did_ bang my share of knuckles when the crescent slipped off the
Allen wrench a few times. Maybe there's a better way, but this worked.

'Course, if your hex-heads are all stripped out, or if you don't
have hex-heads, then  *** Never Mind *** .
