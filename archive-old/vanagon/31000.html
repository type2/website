I installed some fog lights today; I made these brackets out of 1/4&quot;
steel and out them below the bumper, set back a couple of inches.
I still have to figure out a switch.  I don't know if these are really
considered &quot;fog lights&quot; - they are the little Hella chrome units that
have a lense that is exactly like the backup lights on '67 and later
busses.  It would be really cool if I could get some yellow lenses for
them.   I wanna get 2 more, and mount them on the back: one for a backup
light, and one for a rear-fog light.

For a switch, I was thinking of installing a second headlight switch, with
one &quot;click&quot; for the front lights, and the second for the rear.  Whadaya
think?

I gave my old vinyl sunroof cover (which was in good shape except for a
couple of small tears) to this guy I know with a '63 23-window.  He
paid $200 for it, but that was prolly too much...  This thing has
midwest-style rust on it - floors are just about completely gone, parts
of the skylight window frames are gone...  He was very grateful; he has
a shower curtain over the sunroof now...

I also installed my &quot;Its not a car, its a BUS&quot; plate on the front.  I got
the plate with the bus, and its been sitting around all this time
waiting for the right moment...
