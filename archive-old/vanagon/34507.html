Subject: Re: &quot;EV&quot; Panel Van Sighting???

Moe mentioned seeing an EV panel van in Canada...from what I understand, 
the Canadians don't have that &quot;Chicken Tax&quot; to worry about, and so they can 
get panel vans.

Speaking of T4 panel vans, Brian Verbeek from this list sent me some shots 
of a dual-sliding-door Federal Express panel van a while back. When he and I 
met in Brussels last week we exchanged presents...I gave him a copy of the 
25th anniversary edition of the Idiot book....he gave me a T4 delivery van 
model! (I think I got the best of the deal!!!)

As I was walking to class one afternoon I came upon a T4 panel van with a 
window on the sliding door. Naturally I looked inside. It was a flashback to 
the 60s....inside was a bunk built into the back, a seat from a loaf or a 
vanagon in the center of the van...and a set of brackets in the back for a 
cot to be hung. Looked like the interior of a lot of split window vans I 
remember back in the late 60s/early 70s!
