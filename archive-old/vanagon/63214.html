Subject:      Camping co-op? Westfalia Working Group?

     All-

     Did I not once read a fleeting remark about the existence of an
     informal sub-list of list members who could be counted upon to provide
     a parking spot for urban camping and/or friendly comiseration in the
     event of a road problem?  (No, not the CCC.)

     Or am I thinking about the LiMBO membership list (which I haven't
     joined yet)?

     Anyway, I wouldn't mind meeting some of you if you are passing through
     Albuqueruqe (particularly the Westfalia owners).  And I wouldn't mind
     being a local &quot;where do I find...&quot; reference for anyone who has a
     breakdown nearby.

     Unfortunately, most of the, &quot;I'm hitting the road,&quot; messages seem to
     be done just before the traveler logs-off and locks the front door of
     the house.

     -Blaine
