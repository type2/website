&gt; 
&gt; $690 for labor
&gt; $168 for the gasket kit.

Doesn't sound *that* bad to me, compared with prices I have seen
quoted on this list before for vanagon repairs...
&gt; 
&gt; This shop also mentioned that they can have new valve stems 
&gt; put in for about $45 more. (they would have to send that out to a machine
&gt; shop though...)

Did you mean valve _guides_?  Or just valves maybe?  In any case, I would
get this done, and also the valve seals if your heads have them.
