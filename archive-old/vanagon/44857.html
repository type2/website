Subject: Re: Cooling Intake Air?

&gt;        With all the talk of oil temps (ok, I started it : )), I was
&gt;thinking of ways to try and keep the intake air cool. IN my 77 I was
&gt;thinking that running some duct, like heater hose, from the air intake
&gt;around and up into the air scoops on the side of the bus would help the
&gt;engine run alittle cooler. Basically try and route the air intake away from
&gt;the engine compartment air, and closer to where the air actually comes in.
&gt;


I would actually think that this would both not help the heat situation and
make your motor run worse, not better.  By the former I mean that
difference it might make will be minimal.  By the latter I mean that warmer
air tends to absorb aersolized gasoline (such as that coming out of your
injectors or down in your carb) much more rapidly, efficiently and
completely, thus giving a more combustible air/fuel mix.

Of course, this is just slightly informed speculation on my part...
