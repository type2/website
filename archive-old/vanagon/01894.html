I ordered and received a catalog from Bus Boys about 4 years ago.  The 
catalog
was rather small(about 20 pages).  They sent a note with the catalog saying 
a new
expanded catalog would be out soon and they would send it to me.  I never 
got it.
I do recall seeing them advertising quite a bit and listed as a parts source 
for some of the mags project cars.  I have never tried to order anything 
from them so I can't help
there.
