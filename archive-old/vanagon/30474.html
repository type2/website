Subject: Bentley Response to EV Manual Querry

I thought you EV'ers would be amused by the following from Bentley
regarding the EuroVan manual.






Mr. Golen
-Terribly sorry about the Eurovan manual.  It is a complicated story, and as
you know, the EuroVan was withdrawn from the US market and is being
reintroduced next fall (I believe).  In anycase, *much* work on the EuroVan
info is to happen in the next 6 months.  Manuals should follow by late summer. 
        -Michael


&gt;
&gt;I've been calling your company every year since 2/93 to ask when
&gt;the VW Eurovan manual will be available, and each year I've been
&gt;told &quot;It will be out by this summer&quot;. Will THIS be the summer
&gt;that the EuroVan manual is finally out? If so, could you please
&gt;let me know so that I may purchase one.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you in advance.
&gt;
&gt;Richard Golen
