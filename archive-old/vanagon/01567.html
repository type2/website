&gt; Ok i got my '73 bus up and running yesterday.  It had been sitting for
&gt; quite some time - like a coupla years.  Occassionally i would start it up
&gt; and tool down the drive.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ater hitting the road for about 15-20mins yesterday, i smelled burning
&gt; brakes.  Sure enough the front pads were firmly against the disc.
&gt; Hammering against them would loosen them, but once i pushed on the brake
&gt; they would lock up again.
&gt;
&gt; Is this problem fixable?  Has anyone else ever had this type of thing
&gt; happen?

Randy,
You may also want to check the flexible rubber brake lines to make sure they 
are not blocked.  I have had the experience on both my '70 Bus and '69 BMW 
that after sitting in neglect for along time, the brake fluid had caused the 
rubber to deteriorate and swell internally.  The result was that as you 
applied the brakes, enough pressure was generated to force the fluid past 
the constriction in the brake line.  When the brakes were released, the 
pressure cannot bleed off and the brakes drag.  Hope this helps.
