Hey all,

The answer was lame for what the question was.

The &quot;correct&quot; answer was the fire was started because the kid put in an
oversize battery then his friends sat on the back seat.

The real correct answer, as I read the question, is the kid was changing
his Voltage regulator, 3 srews (1 ground, 2 to hold it on), and changed
the battery (3 bolts/nut combinations) and forgot to put the plastic
back over the positive terminal, then they sat on it etc.

But hey, who needs to be specific; screw, nut, bolt, there all the same
aren't they?

&gt;  Hi all: So, what was the answer to the following &quot;puzzler&quot; that was posted
&gt; earlier?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I know its not Friday, but this would be really stale by then.  Did
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;anyone catch Cartalk this weekend?  Their puzzler was as follows:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Larry's VW Beetle he had in college caught on fire when he and 3 of his
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;friends piled in the car for a night on the town. The mishap had to do
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with a repair he'd done 6 weeks earlier when he loosened 3 screws and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tightened 3 bolts. What was the repair? Why did the car catch fire?&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(You can e-mail an answer to them at puzzler_at_cartalk_dot_com if you want)
