Subject: Kyle Wade saves the day

Last night as I was passing through Santa Cruz, CA  on my way to San Francisco
in a 86 Syncro I realized as it was getting dark that I had no headlights.
Luckily Kyle form Volks Cafe was nice enough to sacrifice his Friday night to
get me back on the road.  He diagnosed the problem in the ignition switch and
had the car fixed in no time.

Kyle at Volks Cafe is not only a very nice person but also very knowledgeable
about all VWs and a great source for affordable parts.

Thank you so much Kyle for your help.
