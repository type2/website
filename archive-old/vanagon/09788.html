&gt; Hi all. We recently did a ring job and replaced the heads on my sister's
&gt; Camper's 1700 cc (type IV) engine. It has a 2bbl Weber carb on it, and
&gt; did run OK, despite having terrible compression on the cylinder 3/4 side.
&gt; After putting everything back together, we are unable to start the van.
&gt; There is good spark at the plugs, and it will start with starting fluid
&gt; and run for a few seconds (until the fluid burns off), but it never seems
&gt; to be getting any fuel.
&gt; This wouldseem (to me) to be a problem with the carb, but it was working
&gt; fine before the engine rebuild. There is fuel getting to the carb ...
&gt; 
&gt;  Any ideas anyone?

First things first.  Did you give the motor a compression check?  Did you 
check the (static) timing?  When cranking the engine, is air being sucked
through the top of the carb?  Only if all of these tests came out okay
would I suspect a problem with the carb...
