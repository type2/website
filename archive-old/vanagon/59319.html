Subject: Windows and struts

My '88 Vanagon has bad rear hatch struts - in fact one is spitting fluid. The
local
FLAPS does not carry them, anyone have suggestions?

Also, I find the fact that the windows (power) only work with the ignition on
annoying - this may just be because I can't seem to find an accessory postion
on the ignition switch. So I have to sit with the engine on waiting for the
windows to roll up. Has anyone ever rewired the windows to have power all the
time

Thanks
