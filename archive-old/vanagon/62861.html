&lt;&lt; Just spoke the dealer to get a price on replacing the lost front mud flaps
on
 my 83.5 Westy. $99 each!! We both had a good laugh. (Although I've got to
say
 he seemed to enjoy it more than me.)
  Does anyone know of a supplier that has them at a lower price?
  &gt;&gt;
yeah, I was fortunate to find a comlete set of flaps front and rear, but for
less than the dealer wanted for one flap....

economical alternative is the bus flaps from bus boys or Rcky mtn etc.
they can easily be fitted to the vanagon, and also have the large vw symbol
on them.
