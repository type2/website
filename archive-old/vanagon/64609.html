Subject:      Re: Repair Front Rack and Pinion?

I assume this is power steering? Usual problem is leaking fluid at the seals,
which if left alone will get so bad you will have to add every 50 miles or so.
You should be able to get a rebuilt unit for about $250 from Bus Depot or
Sherwood Automotive (Old Volks Home). Also get the rubber mounting bushings if
it's leaked fluid on them. Good time to replace the boots too.

Replacing is pretty easy - if you have a puller for the tie-rod ends, and a
soft-jawed vice to hold it in while staking the tie rods to the new rack.

I recently got my 87 Westy Syncro realigned and the mechanic told me I
needed a new Rack and Pinion. I don't have the $700 required to fix it.
What happens if I don't get it repaired?
Thank you in advance,
Brent Gardner

P.S. Does anyone know of any good Vanagon mechanics in Eugene, Oregon?
