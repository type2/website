I have a '73 with a Webber progressive carb kit installed.  It took me about 
3 years to work out the kinks.  If you have a Webber some of this advice may 
also be for you.  

1) The stock advance/devance distributor used on the stock dual carbs won't 
work with the Webber.  The vacuum ports don't match the stock setup so the 
timing is off.  Get a Bosch 009 and the problem goes away.

2) Check the vacuum line to the brake booster servo. On mine the rubber under 
the fabric outer cover was rotten and the source a major vacuum leak.  They 
looked fine from the outside.  You should be able to put a clean hose end on 
the engine end of the vacuum line and apply mouth suction with no noticable 
loss of vacuum.  If there is a noticable loss of vacuum then you must fix it 
or the idle micture will be very far off.

3) The Webbers have 2 barrels, a primary and a secondary.  The idea is that 
the primary must be fully open before the secondary starts to open.  If you 
do some serious looking and research into it you will find that the secondary 
barrel has an idle circuit in it and progression holes.  On mine the secondary 
barrel was completely shut at idle making the secondary barrel idle circuit 
ineffective. I used some vice grips to turn the secondary barrel stop screw 
out a little to prop open the secondary barrel at idle and low and beyold it 
idles at 800 rpm and doesn't fall out of idle.  Be carefull, if the secondary 
is open too far then it will idle completely on the secondary and the primary 
idle speed and mixture adjustment will be ineffective.  I found that 1/4 turn 
from full closed was enough to give a great idle.

I would advise agains the delorttos since they will probably become unavailable 
in the future due to tighter emmissions laws and a shrinking market.

I'd try items 2 and 3 above first and then save the change for the 009 if you 
have some success.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; My '73 bus is having problems with the current carburator setup. I
&gt; bought the bus with an &quot;after market&quot; (as the mechanic calls it)
&gt; carburator, different from the original double side setup. Right now,
&gt; the bus is having serious carburation problems, it stalls, and dies at
&gt; low revs. I was thinking in getting the original setup and try
&gt; rebuilding it, but the mechanic suggested me that a Dual Dellorto
&gt; single barrel kit might work better...
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions on this? Has anyone had any experience with this
&gt; Dellorto setup? Will I be better off going with an original rebuilt
&gt; setup? Any help would be appreciated, i recently acquired the
&gt; bus and i'm kind of going in the blind with this since i don't have
&gt; much experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
