Subject: Dear Egallant,  wrt your reference to the Microbus:

In reference to your view of the VW Microbus 
at http://www.got_dot_net/~egallant/guilty.html;

I suppose you could be angry that the VW bus travels so slow.  It's 
never really been a concern of mine though.  After having a GSXR-750 
there is really no point in owning a fast car.  Even the new Porsche 
Turbo that goes 0-60 in 3.5 seconds takes twice as long to get there 
than my Gixer ever did.  Now I just lope along in my Vanagon and if I 
don't get to where I'm going in time I pull over, open the fridge and in 
turn a nice cold one, and have a siesta in a full length bed that these 
VW's tend to come with.  Cheers, and don't bust a vein in your forehead.
