        Dennis:
        
        I do not think you went overboard.  I faced the same sort of 
        problem about 2 months ago except the left head cracked big time.  
        After limping home (fortunately only 2 miles away) and pulling 
        the engine (72 Westy, no poptop), I relaized that this was more 
        than a head off/head on job.  I loaded everything out into the 
        back of a p/u and towed my bus to the local VW 
        guru/diety/mechanic.  Basically, everything from the pistons out 
        needed rehab or replacement.  The other head was in decent shape 
        but I elected to repalce it anyway.  I decided it was pay me now 
        or pay me later.
        
        Took a month of off and on work (I was willing to trade time for 
        price so it didn't cost as much) I got the bus back.  Bottom 
        line, I just did not trust that other head.  IAE, I'm back on the 
        road and the bus hasn't run this well in years.
