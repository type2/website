Thanks to all that responded to my question to converting my bus to a camper.  
I think I may have found a donor.  I now just have to wait for some of the snow
to melt so I can go see it.  One more quick question,  Whats a good price for a
steering box for a 69 bus.  I think It may be time to replace mine, and the
parts bus that I am looking to buy to convert mine to a camper also has a bad
steering box, so I can't use that one.
Thanks
Brad
