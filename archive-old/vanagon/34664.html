&gt; I think it would be good if we can decide collectively where to place
&gt; the beautiful new stickers.

I would think anywhere on the drivers side windows would be appropriate
as it can be seen pretty well when passing.  I would think on the rear
window (behind the cabinet for campers) would be a good place.  Hell,
I stare at all VWs I see when I'm driving.  It's like an automatic
lock-in.  :)
