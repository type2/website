Subject: Clean fire extinguishers

While dry chemical fire extinguishers are quite effective, they are a
royal pain to clean up after.  I would like to carry a cleaner type to
be used first in the case of a small fire, but I can't seem to find
one anywhere.  I was thinking of a CO2 or halon type.  (Halon may have
gone the way of R-12, but perhaps there is a replacement.)

Any suggestions?
