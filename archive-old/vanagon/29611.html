How silly of me...I knew this but forgot. This is the definition of TDC 
anyway. Thanks Martin!

&gt;&gt; no way I

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Joe, Joe...to find TDC remove the spark plug in #1 cylinder
&gt; turn the engine till the mark on the pull lines up with the 
&gt; crack in the crankcase AND the piston is at it's closest point
&gt; to the plug hole(use a screw driver or straw to measure).
&gt; That's TDC. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then turn the distributor so that the rotor is pointing to the
&gt; #1 plug wire and you've got the distributor ballparked.  Take
&gt; out your timing light and fine tune the timing to specs.
