Subject:      Try this on for size...

A couple of months ago, when we first started talking about
exhaust systems, I called those raping bastards at the same
dealer that tried making rent on my van a few days ago, and
asked them about replacing parts on the exhaust.  Below are
some of the quotes I got FOR PARTS ALONE:

025 251 053 E  Muffler             $267.35
021 251 185 E  Tailpipe             $20.54
443 131 701    Catalyst (?)        $754.00
025 251 521    Strap                $44.10
025 251 172 G  Exhaust pipe, rear  $164.20
N901 316 01    Gasket                $6.60  (need 6)
025 251 171 G  Exhaust pipe, front $149.85
025 251 147 D  Exhaust pipe        $185.65
025 251 217    Exhaust elbow        $79.65
(I don't think 85s have the exhaust elbow - THEY sent ME the
diagram! It was labeled with prices marked.)

Oh yeah and don't forget the OXYGEN SENSOR for $105.95!!!
I think mine is a ONE WIRE sensor (should be about 1/3 the
price!).  Anyway, if one were doing this stuff (keep in mind
they left off a few gaskets) it would amount to a grand total
of $1810.89 FOR PARTS ALONE!  Is it just me or
