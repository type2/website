Subject: splittie door hinge r&amp;r

	I ran into a problem that seems simlar when reassembling a driver-
GE saves $0.000001 per drier by having some tool that holds the
driver basket and the bearning hub and washers, etc, then you just
thread-in the three spline-headed screws and you're done. The screws
are about 2 threads longer than they need to be to hold it all together,
and there's NO WAY to hold the washers in place AND the hub lined up
with the basket, etc.

	Solution? I bought a big length of threaded rod, made three
shorter lenghts, installed the washers and the basket over THAT and then
substituted the screws for the threaded rod, one at a time.

	Could the door-hinge problem be similarly solved? Take out
one screw, thread-in a long piece of same-thread rod (or a same-size
bolt, long, with the head cut off) Then take out the second screw,
install second threaded rod, etc. Installation reverse of removal
and all that. Use generously long rod or bolts- several inches -
so that there's NO question of the li'l plate getting lost. Screw in
each rod/bolt a bunch of turns too.

	This doesn't help retrieve the threaded plate that fell to
the bottom of the door, but assuming it can be gotten back somehow,
one ought to be able to stick the same threaded-rod/headless bolt
in and capture the plate for reassembly.

	Good luck!
