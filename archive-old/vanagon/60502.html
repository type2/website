Subject: Re: Redline Water Wetter

&gt;I used the Redline Water Wetter when I replaced the coolant after
&gt;installing a new engine.  The mechanic that replaced the engine used 100%
&gt;anti-freeze as well.  I think that the engine is running too cold.  While
&gt;replacing coolant with water when repairing leaks I would guess that I
&gt;have mabye 33% water in the system now, and the guage still very rarely
&gt;moves out of the white.  Only if I let it idle for 20 min or so will the
&gt;needle escape the white.  The needle used to always be at the redlight.  I
&gt;am going to replace the coolant without using the water wetter.  The
&gt;Vanagon just has a huge cooling system that should have no problem cooling
&gt;the engine. YMMV.

As I recall from tech school many years ago, 100% antifreeze is a no-no.
It is a poor heat transfer fluid, and will seep through gaskets.  67% gives
the lowest freezing point, but 50% is adequate for most uses, and a better
heat tranfer fluid.

If the engine doesn't heat up, too much water is getting past the
thermostat.  The engine should be able to operate at correct tempoerature
(~180F) over a range of ambient temperatures of -40F to +130F or greater.

I'd check the thermostat.
