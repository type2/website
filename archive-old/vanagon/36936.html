&gt;Ok, this problem with my 87 Syncro goes back a while.  When I initially 
&gt;posted about the cold starting problem, where the idiot lights come on, and 
&gt;a faint humming is heard from the engine compartment, but no starter 
&gt;selenoid click or starter crank, just silence when the engine is cold, the 
&gt;List seemed to converge on the main relays in the relay box on the left side

&gt;of the engine compartment.  I tried replacing both relays (main and fuel) 
&gt;but the problem remains, and is degrading:  frequency of no start is 
&gt;increasing (sometimes it'll start right up, other times there is a prolonged

&gt;hesitation) and the length of hesitation is increasing.  Until this morning,

&gt;wouldn't start for about 15 min and finally turned over, same symptoms.  I 
&gt;took it to the dealer.  His eyes lit up when I said intermitent electrical 
&gt;problem $$.  Two guys to diagnose at $58/hour.
&gt;
&gt;Does the List have any suggestions about this problem?
&gt;
&gt;later,

&gt;relax and spin
&gt;87 syncro 
&gt;
&gt;

Probably a bad starter solenoid.  I've come across this problem with a lot of
bosch starters in various vehicles.  Dirt/water gets in and ruins the main
contact bar or rusts the plunger assembly.  My 87 Syncro now has this
ailament.  This starter is a fun job to replace.
