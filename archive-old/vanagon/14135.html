So Al Knoll says:
&gt; 
&gt; My little $$$plastic$$$ cover has gone to uv heaven so I hesitatingly inquired
&gt; about the price of another.  $5 measly bucks compared to some previously 
&gt; mentioned price vrom ze friendly local folkxvagen folkx.
&gt; 
&gt; Naturally I bought $10 bucks worth and dutifully covered the flue and 
&gt; squirreled away the spare.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have such needs he said he'd mail order.
&gt; 
&gt; The dometic P/N is 2929489009-13
&gt; The outfit is AAA RV in Sacramento 916.292.9777

COoooooOl!!!  I'll definitely do some moseying myself.  If anyone wants,
I'll pick up as many as needed and bring them to the next get-together.
