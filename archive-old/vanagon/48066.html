&gt;Very, but North Carolina is just a little too far to make in a weekend.  I
&gt;looked on the map to make sure.  How about a campout in Tennessee or
&gt;Alabama somewhere so some of us Texans could conceivably make it?  I really
&gt;miss camping!

If I might, somewhere between Dallas and Raleigh is Fall Creek Falls,
Tennessee, which is gorgeous. This is accessible also to the Missouri,
Arkansas, West Virginia and Georgia contingents (and Kentucky if there are
any of those); while it's maybe a long haul for the Atlantans, it's a damn
sight closer than Northern Califoria. I miss camping, too.
