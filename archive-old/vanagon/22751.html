&gt;&gt;my 3 HP compressor is probably the best and most used all-purpose
&gt;&gt;shop tool i have bought.  it is a purchase no tinkerer will
&gt;&gt;regret.

        Just my $.02 on buying a compressor. First, choose your air tools. Now,
I don't mean the brand, rather the type of tool. Then look at the specs of the
tool. It will mention the SCFM (Standard Cubic Feet/Min) at some PSI. Make sure
that you get a compressor that will outproduce the tool! Rotary sanders, air
ratchets and die grinders consume vast amounts of air. Impact tools and spray
cans require far less. Personally, I have the Sears 5hp/30gal at my house.
