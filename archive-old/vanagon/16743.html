Hi y'all- 
I've been pretty quiet lately... i work under somewhat the
same atmosphere as Thom.  However, i need some consolation... our
&quot;new&quot; 87 Westy just got pasted yesterday by an old man that didn't
see it (TITAN RED mind you).  After he smacked into the middle of the
drivers side his wife jumped out and said &quot;he just ran right into,
didn't he.  i try to watch for him but he didn't stop&quot;  My wife, who
was driving, and our 3 year old son are unhurt and safe so it
could've been much worse.  now comes the frustration of insurance and
repairs.  The worst part was that the man was totally self-centered 
on his vehicle and did not apologize nor inquire if my wife and son 
were hurt.  Not all old people are nice, grandfatherly types.

I realize the importance of transportation to the elderly.  Even 
after this accident i have a hard time decreeing all compromised 
drivers should be banned from the road.  An elderly friend of ours is 
'partially sighted' at best yet still drives.  It is his last bastion 
of a vigorous and productive life.  To not drive would mean moving 
from his birthplace farm on a lake to an assisted living apartment 
in town.  Yet, the likelihood of a serious accident is high.  I 
dunno.  sometimes life just ain't fair.
