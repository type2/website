Subject: mystery part?????


maybe you all can help me out here.  i got ahold of a chrome engine 
decklid cover the other day.  i thought it ws for a early bus, but turns 
out that it is not.  it looks real similar, but won't fit.  anybody out 
there know what it is or what it is off of?

the outside diameter is exactly the same as the real one.  the hole in 
the center is about 1/8 larger then normal.  the tabs in the rear are 
also wider apart by 1/8 inch.  this makes it too large to fit in the 
standard hole on the deck lid.   the cover plate that swings away to 
reveal the hole is also larger.  it is a full circle that is about 1/4 
smaller in dia then the outer ring.  the original one is similar to a 
rain drop.

anybody know what this may be.  it came from sweden originally.  (i think)

thanks and God Bless
matt
