Are you certain it's the solenoid and not the wiring/ignition switch that 
make the starter seem to fail?  This is a fairly common problem with VWs 
that's easily taken care of by the addition of an aux solenoid _before_ 
the starter to shunt battery current directly to the starter solenoid.

Give us more detail so that we can help you troubleshoot the problem.
