 SyncroBeast           Westy - Weekender - GL???
I should know, but I need someone to tell me all in one place.

1.  A Westfallia is a full camper conversion with closet, sink, fridge that
apparently doesn't work well, and probably swivel seats.

2.  My GL has a fold down rear seat to make into a semicomfortable bed.  Even
my rolled CARAT had the same fold down erar seat, and in addition had the jump
seats, and a table that swung out of the wall.

3.  What is a Weekender package.  Is it something in between 1 and 2 above???

Thanks.
