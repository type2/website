No just wait a minute Lil' doggy...I am currently rewiring my '69 Bus, and I
can tell you that there is a much,much easier way and perhaps even safer
wayu to go about this.  All you guys would have had to do was to loosen and
remove the four screws that are holding the ignition/signal housing in
place.  Then carefully slide the whole shootin match towards you as you are
sitting in the driver's seat.  The steering wheel need not even be removed.
Then remove the switch (two screws) and chase the wires to where they are
connected (labeling them of course) unless you have a wiring diagram and the
rest is all downhill.  I don't want to frighten you, but that severe
fatiguing of the steering column mount could prove dangerous whilst driving.
By bending it and then bending it back again the guy streesed and weakened
the metal.  It could crack at that spot.  Probably nothing to worry about,
but I htink I'd think twice before letting that guy do work on it again.
(IMHO).
