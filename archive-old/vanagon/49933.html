Subject: Re: Question about water tank lock

&gt; 
&gt; p.s. Since you posted this to the Type 2 list, I assume you are not on the
&gt; Vanagon list. I will cross-post this to the Vanagon list for you, since
&gt; there are more subscribers there who have Vanagon Westies and may have a
&gt; better solution.
	
	My better solution was to take the whole cover/filler pipe and plate
with locked cover off the van, removed the lock from the inside by
disasembling the lock tab and removing lock cylinder from cap..
	took the cap down to my local RV center and they sold me a new locking
cap for 'bout $8.00.... 

		the trick was to reattach the flex hose to the filler, not alot of
extra hose to play with...


		hope this helps...
