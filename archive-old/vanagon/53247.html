Subject: 6V gas heater for sale...

Hi all,
        I am not on the list so if you would like to get a hold of me you
will have to e/m me directly at &quot;aschultz_at_smartt_dot_com&quot; (note the two &quot;tt&quot; in
smartt)

        A friend of mine is willing to sell his gas heater out of his Bug.
It was first installed it a mid 60's Bug and then in a 73 Bug. He has all
the parts in a box as he was going to keep it to put into a boat. He says it
is complete and in working order, I saw it and it looks in good shape only a
bit dusty and some cobwebs. We both live in Vancouver B.C. Canada. He does
not see himself in a boat any time soon as he now has two small kids, he is
not anxious to sell but if he can get a good price for it he will consider it.

                                Top of the season to you all...
  Arnold Schultz,  P.O.Box 26083,  Richmond, B.C.,  Canada, V6Y 3V3
