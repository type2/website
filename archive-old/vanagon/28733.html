well, there i was, walking along in the toy store, when i heard this little
tiny high-pitched piston-slapping voice call out to me: &quot;buy me! buy me!&quot;
... i looked around and sure enough, there was a tiny little Eurovan Caravelle
hideen down amongst the other tiny cars in the showcase.

so i bought it. :)

for those of you similarly inclined, it's made by Wiking, order # 296-00-18,
VW Caravelle. medium blue in color. on the bottom of the bus, it has written
&quot;Wiking VW T4&quot;. it's 1:87 scale and cost (me) $8.99 + tax.
