&gt; if the noise sounds metallic, and is worse in cold and going around corners
&gt; and going up hills, it's probably the cv joints. time to take 'em off and
&gt; clean and regrease 'em. :) messy, messy, messy. but 'fun'. be SURE to use
&gt; much more grease than the vw/lobro kit comes with: imho, vw never put enough
&gt; grease in there. use at least twice as much as 'normal', and i'd suggest
&gt; using three times as much.

  I've heard that noisy CV joints can sometimes be cured by injecting grease
  into them using one of those giant &quot;syringe needles&quot; attached to a grease 
  gun. This avoids taking the axles off and getting dirty &lt;not that we mind,
  right?&gt;. Does anyone have an opinion on swapping the axles from one side
  to the other so as to run the CV joints in the opposite direction and 
  move the wear to the ball races on the other side?
