Subject: O2 Sens. Replacement


Hello all,
	I found in the archives that there are generic 3-wire O2 sensors 
available as well as some Bosch units that do not have the correct 
connector and need to be spliced.  There are 2 white wires and one black 
one. How do you make sure that the white wires are correctly matched? Or 
does it matter? Thanks in advance.
