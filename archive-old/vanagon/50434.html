Subject: Replacement Struts for Rear Hatch on Vanagon
Date: Mon, 14 Oct 1996 21:20:02 -0400


Does anyone know where to get replacement struts for the rear hatch of a
1991 Vanagon.  Mine have finally given out completely.  (Boy is that rear
door heavy without them!)

I priced them at the dealer today and they want $55.80 plus tax for each of
them!!  And of course they have to be special ordered!

I was able to get the part number from the dealer:  251829-331B or
251829-332.  

There must be a mail order company somewhere that offers a better deal.
