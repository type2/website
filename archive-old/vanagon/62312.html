Phil:
Sorry to hear about your dilemma but take heart, it's downhill on the way
home (;-).
Inspect the tip of each spark plug. This may point you to the right
direction if you find one of them that is fouled or different than the
other three.
You might try checking the spark also. Disconnect the electrical plug to
each injector (for safety) while you crank the engine. You should get a
healthy blue ark. This may be hard to judge if you have not looked at it
before.  If possible, timing and advance should be checked. If it idles
Ok initial timing is probably OK but a problem in timing advance could
certainly affect power.
While you have the plugs out remove the center lead from the distributor
and ground it (for safety). Remove one bank of injectors and point them
into a glass jar. Plug one injector in and crank the engine. You should
get a nice cone spray of gas. 
Good luck and no smoking during gas tests.
Ken Lewis
PS
A can of gas treatment would not hurt.
