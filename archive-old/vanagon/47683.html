I think the general wisdom is not to remove the thermostat. It's a good 
thing, helps your engine warm up quicker (even in the summer), and 
regulates the temperature of the engine for optimal performance and minimal 
wear and tear. It's there for a purpose and you don't stand to gain 
anything by removing it. This applies to all air cooled-engines. It's 
amazing how often this question gets asked.
