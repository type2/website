&gt; At least it wasn't impailed on the front grill or stuck in the windshield
&gt; with the driver laying dead.  Too many deer and not enough hunters I say.
&gt; I've seen far too many accidents in N.E. P.A. from the little corn
&gt; munchers to care how many get killed during hunting season.  By the way,
&gt; it was all of the development in this country that forced the deer into
&gt; tighter home ranges which in turn caused them to over-populate.  Keep
&gt; killin them.(P.S. this is not meant to be a flame,but I have had with all
&gt; animal rights people.) 
&gt; 
&gt; 
Boy, that's a great attitude.  I'm not an animal-rights person, but if
the people hadn't developed too extensively in the first place then deer
wouldn't be out wandering the highways.  If we take away their homes
they've gotta go somewhere.  I just figure it's the &quot;deer's revenge&quot; and
that's what we get for destroying their homes.  Running into a deer on
the highway is absolutely not a good thing at all, but it's only going
to get worse with time.  

PS - this is not meant to be a flame, but I have had it with all
ignorant people.
