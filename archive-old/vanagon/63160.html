&gt; &gt;    I wonder what a orderly, group request for information and assistance
&gt; &gt; on a Subaru to Vanagon conversion would have if send to Kennedy
&gt; &gt; Engineering. Obviously they acknowledge a market for the conversion kit
&gt; &gt; dismonstrated by their research in to the matter.
&gt; &gt;    If they were to receive serveral hundred inquires about the process
&gt; &gt; they MAY offer other services.
&gt; &gt; ( list discounts or conversion installation)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   As a business person, I would be very motivated to provide services to
&gt; &gt; a group of 100 people offering ???$2000???  for a viable engine
&gt; &gt; alternative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   What do you think?
&gt; &gt;
