Subject: Re: 86 Vanagon Speakers

While at the VW midwest nationals in OH, I chatted with a rep. from the
German Air Sucker Society, In his Vanagon doors he used Pioneers.  Me, I
put a pair of Alpine 6.5&quot; in the lower part of the front doors. 
Considerable better sound, but you have to cut out the door pannels.  (The
door itself has an oval cutaway in the bottom big enough for these or even
6X9&quot; speakers.)  Take a look, just pop the door panel off (unsrew the
handles first)
Sorry, all this is a reply to the question about replacing the 4&quot; Blau's
in the front doors.
Another option could be: The speakers in the rear of the Vanagon Westy's
are interchanable with the ones in the door...
