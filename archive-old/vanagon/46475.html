Subject: &quot;Kitchen&quot; Light Bulb for '81 Westy

In a recent fit of preparedness, I removed the bulb from the interior light
over the sink from CampoFelice (my '81 Westy) and started hunting for
spares -- just in case.

Checked a few auto supply stores and had no success.  Then before I could
find spares for the bulb, I LOST it!  I seem to remember it was marked
GE790, but haven't been able to find a cross-reference for a replacement.
And of course, I can't schlep it in to an electronics shop for a match.
The fixture is a single-bulb installation, and seemed to put out a lot of
light for one small lamp.  The glass bulb seemed pretty heavy and it wasn't
a screw-in or a bayonet mount; it's connector consisted of two rather heavy
bare wires which are inserted straight into the base socket.  Could it have
been a halogen bulb in a 1981 vehicle?

Can anybody give me a replacement number for it?  Or would one of you  '81
Westy owners pull your bulb out and send me any identifying numbers you
find?

Since this might not be of general interest, reply by direct Email if you
don't want to use up bandwidth.

Thanks,

Lee
