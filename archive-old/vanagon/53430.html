Hi folks, Let me clarify, the '89 Westy I posted on the list was NOT MINE. It
was one for sale in my area.    Oh, and I found out why it was really so
cheap..........

FLOOD CAR from Florida. (saltwater flood). Insurance Co. totalled it out and it
doesn't have a clean title anymore. It has a salvage reconstructed &quot;R&quot; title.
Been thru god knows how many auto salvage auctions and wholesalers up and down
the east coast. Been lifted up by a forklift countless times (crushes the gas
tank) and both the tables and rear cushion etc. were probably stolen while it
was sitting in some salvage wholesalers lot somewhere. Flood cars are electrical
nightmares. 
A/c compressor shot. (saltwater will do that)  While the current owner had it
(all of one year) he was hit on the side from front to back. he took the
insurance money from the accident, and &quot;fixed&quot; it himself. Looks terrible.  The
front and rear fiberglass bumpers are still both cracked on the edges from the
impact. He didn't fix them. Also both alloy wheels are damaged too, again from
the accident. 

He was actually &quot;given&quot; the westy in &quot;payment&quot; for doing some stonework on the
salvage yard owner's house. 

It sold, though...

Not such a &quot;sooper good deal&quot; afterall...seeing is believing..actually not worth
anywhere near what he was asking for it....
