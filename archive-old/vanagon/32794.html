Subject: Re: Penetrating Fluid Recommendations

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm looking for some suggestions on penetrating liquid to use to
&gt;&gt;free up bolts that have probably not been moved in 30 years.  I've been
&gt;&gt;using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
&gt;&gt;there that is better.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Thom,
&gt;  Go to a GM dealer, yes a GM dealer and ask for heater valve lubricant.
&gt;Or GM Super Lub. I use these two everyday and they work great.  Especially
&gt;on Rusty exhaust bolts.  Its quick and it works.  Good luck.
&gt;
