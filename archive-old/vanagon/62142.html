Subject: FS: '83 w/c vanagon, good parts

     To all of you who are complaining about tranny's, A/C, doors, 
     interiors, etc:  I have a perfectly good '83 watercooled vanagon L 
     that has a deficient engine (needs rebuild or major work but core is 
     good).  All of the expensive non-engine stuff is quite usable.
     
     I live in a t/h community so massive parting out on-site may be a 
     problem so I would like to sell it to someone who can use it and deal 
     with the dismemberment (that pains me) and re-sale or as a rebuild 
     candidate.
     
     e-mail to attached address or call (410)750-8769
