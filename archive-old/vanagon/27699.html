Re: The post about the materisl used in sound proofing/insulating aircraft.
............................................................................

I contacted the recommended email address for the noise/thermal insualtor
material (soundprf_at_pdsig_dot_com). The article was sent almost immediately. I
then called the phone number listed in the article regarding pricing.

Aircraft Reman, 
1531 Avohill, Vista,
Ca, 92084  
(619) 749 0239

The answers found in the article were that there are two types of materials.
First is FAA approved, has a more open celled and thicker foam construction
than the second type. Is used widely in larger/commercial aircraft but is
relatively new to the lighter and smaller aircraft world. Is available in
rolls of 50' x 40&quot; and costs (roughly) $400. per roll.
The second type is non-FAA aproved, is of a smaller cell/higher density
foam. Is available in pack of six sheets cut to 48&quot; x 64&quot;. Costs about $100
per pack.

The gentleman mentioned that either one roll or two packs of the material
would &quot;probably&quot; do a VW bus (whatever generation). He claimed that the
materials in his products give the greatest noise reduction to weight factor
on the market (vs his competitors). A strong case was made for the
insulation capabilities also. &quot;Just in case your bus has a tendancy to get
hot in the summer or cold in the winter.&quot; (Just maybe)

He also emphasized that his operation was set up as a mill distributor and
that nearly all of their business is conducted via mailorder. Other
suggestions were that they were not the only ones making &quot;similar&quot;
materials. He suggested to check &quot;down by the airport&quot; and see if there are
any uphostery shops that cater to the airline industry. A few distributions
points are identified in the email article. Check it out.

It sounds great, but I'm gonna have to stick with the Pink Panther stuff for
right now. I might wish that I had used this product from time to time but...
