&gt; Can anyone fax me a copy of the manual pages for 
&gt; changing/flushing/bleeding coolant, etc.? My fax no. is 415-364-5945 for 
&gt; 1985 vanagon Westphalia. Any tip sheets also appreciated.

&gt; I've got a temp light on, temp. gauge toping out, no hot air when I turn 
&gt; on the heater.

I have the same exact problem!  ONly, i got water running out of my 
engine.  I can see residue surrounding the head gasket which makes me 
thing it is leaking from there.  My light and needle go up, and stays 
for a couple seconds then drops back down.  You should check for a water 
leak now, my got worse quick!


&gt; 
&gt; We initially put in some Prestone coolant/water mixture but I just
&gt; and on checking, we found the refill and expansion tanks were both empty

Again, this is exactly what is happening with mine.  AT first I could see 
no leak, but, I was running out of water.  Then, it started to pour out.
