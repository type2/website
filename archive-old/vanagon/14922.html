Subject: Things that make you go &quot;Hmmmm&quot;

A fellow stopped by here yesterday (seeing the assortment in my yard)
and asked what &quot;He should look for when buying a bus&quot; as he was in
the market for a P-van/camper/bus and was comparison shopping.

I sent him off on his merry way after expounding on the benefits to
be gained by adding any breadloaf to his family tree.  

His question brought up another question though. After rifling the
archives, and digging back through voluminous posts I failed to find
a FAQ on common ailments and/or &quot;potential pitfalls&quot; which most of
us VolksFolks have faced at one time or another.

I certainly don't want to cast negative aspersions on my favorite money pit,
but thought a FAQ of this sort would perhaps serve as a
helpful checklist next time we find that &quot;Buy of a lifetime&quot;. 

A few minor observations on a major subject:

BODY/Cosmetic
 Floor pans by the wheel wells go all too quickly!
 Metal under the accellerator gets soft/rots causing doorhinge surgery!
 Splities &amp; Breadloafs rot windshield frames quicker than instant soup!
 Battery trays disintegrate, Wolfsburg replacement tin doesn't fit...

ENGINE/Drivetrain
 Jumps out of gear, time for a rebuild
 Lose reverse, park in open spaces
 Front seals always go AFTER you reinstall engine

There's actually scads more, and lot's I haven't thought/heard of
anybody care to add NetWisdom?
