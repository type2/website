Subject: 6V -&gt; 12V

&gt;Well... I did it about 3 1/5 years ago, and no fires yet.  Hell... even
&gt;the 6V wipers still work (anyone have 12V ones froma '67?).

Yes, but it's MINE!  I'm still running the '72 SuperBeetle motor attached
to the cam-n-rods that came stock in my '61, but it's getting a little
cranky.  About a month ago, I turned them on and they just twitched.
Messed with the fuse, the plugs ('72 SB controls, too) and the switch, but
they just twitched.  Left them on anyway.  It was like watching Mickey's
big hand move - took about 5 minutes to go all the way across.  After
they'd finished the initial pass over the windshield (right-to-left) they
ran normally.  I don't get it.  Either the grease in the gears is now glue,
or the motor has to be HOT to run.  But this pattern is repeatable.  So I'm
hoping to put the '67 setup in, someday.

My brother ran his '66 stuff through a weird and elaborate voltage-reducer
built by an electrical engineering student at Rice University.  Toasted the
wiper after awhile.  Never did anything with the starter - just ran it
twice as fast.

The starter held up until an escaped mental patient broke into his bus and
hot-wired it (but didn't connect the coil).  Got about a 1/4 mile on just
the starter motor, and then it expired.  My brother push-started it for
months by putting it in second, hooking up the wires (never fixed the
ignition switch) and just - pushing. No popping the clutch.  He caught up
with it every time...
