&gt;From: Dave Kautz &lt;dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com&gt;:
 I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
 to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
 easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
 go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
 and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
 it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?

I can't say on a '74, but on a '69 it is much easier just to do the engine.
You're not a very big guy, if I say so myself, and unless you can get a 
helper, heaving the combination around and getting it lined up is a lot of 
work.  Leave the tranny in the car unless there is some reason to have it 
out.  You just have to reach behind the shroud to do 2 nuts - shouldn't be 
a problem.
