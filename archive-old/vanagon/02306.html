&gt;
&gt;This is directed to the owners of aircooled vanagons. I am doing a 
&gt;mini-survey in order to find out what kind of performance characteristics 
&gt;are typical of an air cooled Vanagon. Part of the reason is determining 
&gt;major faults that may be of interest to all of us. Another reason is 
&gt;curiosity 
&gt;- why did VW replace these engines after only three years of production? 
&gt;
&gt;If  you have the time please forward the following information to me:
&gt;
&gt;Year and type of Vanagon
 - 81 Westfalia (but without stove and fridge)
&gt;How many years owned
 - 2.5
&gt;Age of van
 - 13
&gt;Age of engine
 - 4 months
&gt;First engine?
 - third
&gt;Clutch replaced?
 - 30 K miles ago
&gt;Transmission replaced?
 - no
&gt;
&gt;Daily use?-
 - no - frequent weekends and long road trips
&gt;
&gt;Mileage -
 - 135K
&gt;MPG - city/highway -
 - ~20 ?
&gt;
&gt;Replaced Parts - electrical
none
&gt;Replaced Parts - emission
O2 sensor
(EGR filter burned through but not replaced)
&gt;Replaced Parts - fuel system
fuel pump
&gt;
&gt;Max speed - 
maybe 80 ?
&gt;
&gt;Oil pressure at speed (if known) -
&gt;Oil pressure at idle -
&gt;
&gt;Major body work -
&gt;Major suspension work -
&gt;
&gt;Major items  (body/engine) requiring improvement in your 
&gt;estimation 
&gt;
&gt;Any other points you would like to add - 
bought with 102K miles, previous owner had a GEX motor put in at 93K
miles.  I replaced cylinders and heads at 119K miles due to low
compression on 1 and 3.  GEX engine looked like hell when I took it
apart.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance - DC
