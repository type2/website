Thom,

I don't know if you can put a locking T-handle, however here are a 
couple of options.

1. If you want to use the T-handle, then find a single cab
pickup, especially a pre-64. The tool compartment doors under
the pick-up bed use the T-handle, but also are keyed. As I
recall the locking mechanism is about the same size as the
latch mechanism on your engine hatch. However, this would 
require you to drill about a 3/4&quot; hole about 1&quot; to the
side of your current &quot;T&quot; handle hole to accomodate the
key lock.

2. Get an engine lid from a 65-67 van, along with the  rear
body pan...the one that the engine lid locks into...then
get a locking engine compartment latch like the one that
you can buy for a 65 or later beetle.

Hope this helps!

Ric
