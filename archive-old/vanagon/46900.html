Subject: The Magic rust remover?

IN the late '70s JC Whitney sold a rust remover called Rust-biox.
Advertised to eat rust but not paint, it was non-toxic, non-caustic, and
bio-degradeable, and in a gel form.  And IT WAS ALL THAT and worked
(although slowly).  The idea was that there was some &quot;natural&quot; chemical
reaction that ate the rust.

While it worked slowly, it did it's job and ate rust and not paint, and I
mean ATE it.  The rust would be gone.._dot_completely.  And bare metal with a
&quot;zinc phosphate&quot; coating would be left in it's place.  It was great for
superficial rust and for touch-ups.  Not as good on heavy rust.

This miracle stuff disappeared from the catalog in the early 80s and in the
mid 80's some new similar stuff took its place.  This &quot;new stuff&quot;   was a
liquid which made similar claims to the Rust-biox but didn't do as good a
job... but it did work.

I don't believe that either product is in the catalog any longer, although
it's been years since I checked.  I don't have a current catalog.

Soooo, does anyone remember this stuff, know how it worked, know how to get
it, etc?

We should research this stuff and find a source for it.  What market would
be better than a bunch of transporter fanatics fighting the constant war
against rust?
