Subject: more on head replacement

Thanks to everyone who wrote back regarding my situation.  I should have 
mentioned that I'm not stuck (I can still get up to 65 on the 
interstate), but I am living out of my bus at the moment.   So, it would 
be nice to fix the problem.  I have a few questions still.

Does anyone have the phone # of Mark STephens?

At least one person who wrote back suggested that I replace all vacuum 
hoses, injector seals, fuel lines, and clutch while the engine is out.  
Are there any opinions out there on what should be done for sure given 
the cost of taking the engine out??

Thanks again for all the assistance.  It has made this much easier than 
trying to find answers around town.

david
