Subject: sanding poptops


If you sand your fiberglass poptop, please make sure you wear a
mask, preferably a gas mask!

I'd shy away from using any type of regular paint on a poptop, since
it needs to be more rubbarized to have more give in it.  I think regular
paint would crack very soon with all the opening and closing of the top.
Military grade 2-stage epoxy would probably work great, but be a 
terrible to pain to apply.
