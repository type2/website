Subject: Over-carpets

When I bought my bronze-metallic Vanagon in '85, I knew it would take 
some rough use, so I determined to protect the carpeting to keep it clean 
and keep resale value high.

I guess the resale issue is dead, since I still have the bus and probably 
will keep it till it dies &lt;g&gt;.

Still, you might like to know that you can go to a carpet shop and have a 
relatively inexpensive carpet matched for color (and texture, if you 
wish) and have the shop make up some very nice carpets that will fit 
right on top of the floor.  I don't fasten mine down.  The edges are 
finished with some kind of sewing so they look good and don't unravel.

In the back, I used a carpet over and under the pad so it didn't wear on 
either side.  I suppose a cheaper pad underneath would have been OK.

Besides keeping the original floor looking almost pristine, the bus is a 
bit quieter and warmer in my subjective opinion.  It's easy to just pull 
the over-carpets out and beat or vacuum them.

I don't know what this would cost today, but I'd do it again if I buy 
another &quot;rough use&quot; car like my bus.
