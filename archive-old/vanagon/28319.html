Subject: Alternator question

All,

I feel stupid for asking this, but as they say &quot;The only stupid question,
is the one you don't ask&quot;(or something like that).  While putting my engine
back together today I found my self in a quandry, there are 2 wires coming
from the alternator, one with a plug that only fits in one part of the engine
compartment, so I'm sure I got that one right, but the other I'm not sure
of.  It is the right length to reach the starter, it is red, and it has a
connector that is the right size to fit over the post of the starter.
However, when I went hook it to the starter, I thought that something was not
right.  My question is where does this second wire go?  My instincts tell me
it is a ground, but I was under the impression that VW colored ground
wires brown.  If it is a ground, is there some place that is should be
attached, or would any bolt on the body work?

Waiting anxiously,

David
