Te letters do mean something   find out what the G and B mean 
don't trust sears or any tire center to know what is right for a van 
whatever you get must have a reinforced sidewall at least 6 ply and a load
rating of 
1600 lbs per tire 
I learned about sears the hard way 
when it comes to vanagons especially syncros there database is WRONG!!!
