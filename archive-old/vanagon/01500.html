Subject: GIFs

I'm interested in GIFS of bricks also.  I've grabbed the ambul.gif file. 

Whoever posted this made a slight error:
&quot;
There' a nice GIF of a split-screen ambulance (with a fire-wagen in the
background) on ftp.uhb.fr . It's in images/vwgif.dir/ambul.gif
&quot;
It's actually ftp.uhb.fr:/images.dir/vwgif.dir/ambul.gif

I've also put it on our ftp server as
lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:/pub/vanagon/ambul.gif
and in the gopher as 
VW Ambulance

If you're in the US or Canada, this is a more appropriate place to get 
the file.

A long time ago I had a picture of another split window -- I'll look for it.
I'd really like to see some vanagon pics out there. (bias bias bias) &lt;grin&gt;

Have fun!
