In Massachusetts what makes an vehicle be an RV is the presence of a toilet,
or so I am told.  Jim.

&gt;I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be insured
&gt;as an RV (at least with State Farm).  My insurance on the '84 Westy is
&gt;about half of what it is for my '86 Jetta.  Many years ago, in
&gt;California, the requirements for RV insurance were that it had to have a
&gt;bed, a sink, and a stove.  Here in North Carolina, the agent just
&gt;processed the RV application without telling me the details.
