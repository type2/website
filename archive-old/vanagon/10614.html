Ok, something got screwed up royally with that post.  Let's try it
again.  And the first one was so elegantly stated...

The gist of it was that I bought my 90 GL in 93 with about 20k on the
odo.  As far as I know, it had the original tires on it (Michelin MXLs).
Here is the sad tale:
 - at 32k the front left tire developed a bubble; used the spare for it 
   (still had the little new-tire knobbly bits on)
 - at 35k the front right developed a bubble; got a no-name brand
   non-reinforced replacement (this happened out in the sticks, of
   course).  Interestingly, not as much sway or mushiness as I expected
 - and now at 37k the right rear developed (yes, you guessed it) a
   bubble (belts breaking, I suppose).
Not much mileage, and all tires had a fair amount of tread left, but
still, they were 5 years old.  Time to get a new set.  

We all know how difficult 205/70R14's are to find, so the NTW guy
recommended Pirelli P300's.  Not reinforced, but made with nylon plies
instead of polyester, which is claimed to make it as stiff as some
reinforced tires.  In fact, the little Pirelli sales blurb claims it as
&quot;all season performance for vans, pickups, SUV's, and 4x4's.&quot;  I don't
usually load the beast full up anyway, and first impressions are an
extremely quiet and well cornering tire (ok, as spirited as one dares
to corner a Vanagon.)  Treadwear index 330, traction A, temp B.  And
finally the little number we're all interested in: $73 per tire plus
balance, valve stems, etc.

A nice little sidenote: the tire guy was surprised at how nicely and
well the beast handled.  Ok, he didn't drive it across the Golden Gate
Bridge with a stiff crosswind, but I wonder what he was expecting ;^)

Joachim, longwinded but happy that he doesn't have to worry about tires
for a while (instead there's the damned h2o pump on the Scirocco...)
