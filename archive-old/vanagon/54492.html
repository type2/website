Subject: Re: Looking for Mirrors

&gt;I'm gonna try some Mid-Winter improvements on MY THING.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone got a pair of mirrors (left &amp; right) that are in &quot;decent&quot;
&gt;condition and can be acquired for a cheap price?
&gt;
&gt;I'm sending for the door-hinge mounts and would liek to set up the
&gt;mounts, mirrors, painting and all that stuff in one process, if posible.
&gt;
&gt;While I'm not very well versed in this stuff yet, seems I remember
&gt;hearing that mirrors from several years' bus will fit nicely.
&gt;
&gt;regards,
