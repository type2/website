Subject: Temp. gage

I have FINALLY got out and bought me a cylinder head temperature
gage... installed it... and am enjoying watching the needle of the
gage (by VDO) go up.  However, I have no idea what the normal
operating temperature is for my air-cooled 1982 Westy (2 liter,
FI, etc.)

Can somebody please email me what numbers I should watch out for...
normal operating range; on-the-hot-side; and &quot;you're done for-doomed-
kaput-may-day-meltdown&quot; temperature.  The temp gage goes up to 600 F.

I am hardly on the computer these days so I'd appreciate a quick email
response.  Thanks, people.
