Subject: MA Crazies (was Something Positive)

Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com  referred to the &quot;Middle Aged Crazies&quot;
&gt;&gt;People accused me of going through one of those a few years ago when I
bought a used Thaiyoter Jellybean Van on impulse.

Rusty VanBondo feels like he has been going through the middle aged crazies
since about age 28. It was age 28 when I finally &quot;grew up.&quot; I think the
later fourties and fifties are going to be more docile. Either that or I
will just percieve them that way.  Kinda like a psychadelic Ronny Reagan
waking up from a nap.    = 8P)
I blame it all on Dave Eccles record collection...
