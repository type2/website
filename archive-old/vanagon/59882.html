&gt;Thanks for all your help with the AC question we sent out last night.  Now we
&gt;have another question for all you Volks Heads.  When the AC is turned on the
&gt;van wants to die and becomes sluggish.  We know the engine is miniscule for
&gt;the size of the car, but it should not drain the power that badly.  Any ideas
&gt;and suggestions appreciated as always.  P.S.- Althea has an automatic
&gt;transmission.  Thanks again, Dan &amp; Christine

There is an idle stabilizer shown on page 24.53 of the Bentley manual that could cause this 
problem and how to test it. When my 91 refused to idle, I found in my 91 a big hole melted in the 
hose running between the intake duct and the oil breather. BTW I tried to get the hose from VW and 
they gave me a piece of 3/4&quot; heater hose. Check all the hose connections on the intake system 
first.
