&gt;I am also having a strange problem.  I am getting a squeaky out of the front 
&gt;right wheel.  It squeeks witht he car in the air and me turning the wheel.
&gt;It appears to be the brake shoes rubbing on the drum, but instead of the
&gt;scruff-scruff that would normally may, its squeeking!  It has new wheel
&gt;bearings and brakes, so I don't think there is some sort of failure, just
&gt;an annoyance that I don't know if its serious or not though.
&gt;
&gt;Also, whoever it was that emailed my about offering to help with wheel
&gt;clips, can ya write me again?  I hosed my mail file...           

How about the pads craeking on the pivots?

Also Thom, I talked to my electronics prof. about your 6 to 12 volt 
converter.  first thing he asked was how small do you want to make it!  It 
seems to be not much of a problem to make a converter for 6-12 at 5.5 amps 
output.  He drew the scematic for me, and I simulated it, but haven't 
finished a design.  Basically, once you have the design, this thing could be 
as small as a fist, and cost 20 -30 bucks.  The design is theoretically 100% 
efficent, but that would drop a little.  Let us know what you're going to do.
Chris.
