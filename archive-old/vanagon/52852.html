Subject: CCC's Jan - got a place!!!



Details will soon be forthcoming, but wanted to let all of you
know asap that we do indeed have a cabin now for our Jan 17-19th
trip to the snow.  I'll have more info in the next few days,
but wanted you to know that the event will be firm and happening
on these dates, and that we have a place which will be reaonably
priced an accomodate our size.  It's in the Tahoe area - in
the vicinity of Homewood, so you can get oriented.  Cross-country
skiing is available out the door, and of course all of Tahoe's
other offerings nearby or far, depending on how far you choose
to drive.  This place is about a mile from the lake, has full
kitchen facilities, woodstove, bedrooms, loft, etc.

As time gets closer, we'll work on the food-potluck plans; stay tuned.

Here's whom I have down as attendees:

(please let me know of changes)

Kathy Myers/Mark Blanchard (if not bad weather)
Joel Walker
Coyote Ron Lussier and Dan
Jack Stafford
Bradley Prunehead
Sam/Susie Williams
Bren Smith &amp; family
Eugene Palmer

Ann Prunehead
SGREENAWALT_at_SCUACC.SCU.EDU (name?)
Dave Kautz and family?
Wagners?
Holsers?
Johnsons?
