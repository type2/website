Subject: Return of Die Frau!

After a rough summer, I'm happy to report that Frau Blucher is back among
the rolling Busses!

Sporting her new clutch, push-rod tubes &amp; various seals, Die Frau has also
had a great deal of welding done to her underside &lt;no doubt she's blushing
at my sharing something so personal&gt; and soon will be turning heads as she
becomes a silk-screen project for an advanced 2-D design class.  Add new
curtains and seat covers, and she'll no longer be the dowdy old Weekender
I've come to love.  

Soon, new heater boxes and exhaust, and probably ball joints (funds ran out...) 

And to think I almost parted her out when for mere hundreds of dollars and
hours of filthy back-breaking labor she's farting merrily along once again!

To quote Da Spouse, who in his inimitable way noted, &quot;You VW people are
nuts.  I hope you realize that.&quot;

Yup.
