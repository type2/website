Subject: Re: Don't Use: Click type torque wrench?

&gt;&gt;For some reason, throughout my repair microfiche, my manual urges again and
&gt;&gt;again something like:

&gt;&gt;Do not use inaccurate click type torque wrench

&gt;&gt;Every time I read that I go &quot;Uh!&quot; and then I wonder how inaccurate these
&gt;&gt;wrenches are likely to be.

Some of the aircraft repair books have torque specs that must be applied for
a period of time. Example: Lycoming head bolts: 32ft-lbs for 30 seconds.

With the old deflection beam or dial torque wrenches, you can apply a
constant force. With the click-type, once it clicks, who knows what torque
you are applying. Personally, I use the dial-indicator type. They are a bit
expensive for home use, though.

I get a kick out of a local tire chain where I buy my tires. They advertise
to hand-torque the lugs to manufacturer's specs. While watching the tire
jockeys, I noticed that they did use a click-style wrench, but continued to
turn it after the click was heard! Whoa, way accurate!

 IMHO, of course.
