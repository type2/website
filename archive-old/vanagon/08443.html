Subject: Re: need Wesphalia info

Thanks for your input. IHow do you feel about the new Westphalia vs the 80s 
version? Do you prefer gas or diesel. I guess the syncro is not available in 
diesel is it?

I'm in Winnipeg, and most winters a syncro would be a great idea. However 
this year, it's been incredibly mild thus far.

&gt;Hi Murray.  I live out in the Vancouver area and have a 1990 Syncro Westfalia.
&gt;We have owned it since new, and the only problem I have had with it is a
&gt;waterpump failure this past September.  I currently have 111000 km on it,
&gt;and it's been quite loyal to us.  We have made three jaunts across Canada
&gt;in the van.  Last year we spent 3 months on the road, and covered 25000 km
&gt;without any problem.  My wife and I are highly organized when we travel, and
&gt;there is always room for something else in the Westfalia.
&gt;
&gt;Prime examples over a Class B motorhome are such things as excellent fuel
&gt;mileage, and unlimited road access.  The van has an excellent turning radius,
&gt;the Syncro allows excellent off-road capabilities and climbing power.  We
&gt;can fit into almost any campsite due to our short length (approx 16 feet), and
&gt;it's cheap to travel on ferries because of it (important on the west coast!).
&gt;Need more info?... just ask.
&gt;
&gt;Thx.
