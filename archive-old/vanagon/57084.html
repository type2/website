&gt;running at warmer temperatures/longer stretches is a band aid not a
&gt;solution.  I may be an idiot on this one too, but why did they get
&gt;rid of the crankcase breather intakes with FI.  I mean the thing has
&gt;the oultet back into the damn air intake, but how is water ever going
&gt;to get out of the system once in without a filtered air intake, does
&gt;the FI car have one? I don't know where if it does, somebody
&gt;enlighten me, all in all it seems to me that it lacks a complete
&gt;breather system like the carbed vehicles had.

Inevitable blow-by is actually filtered air intake, isn't it? It
pressurizes the case and pushes the steam out and that's the only way to
get the water out of there. If low temperatures are the cause (and I think
that's correct) then higher temperatures aren't a band-aid, they're a cure.

I'm not convinced this is more prevalent in FI, either.

Once the mayonnaise messages stop and the bike rack messages start, it'll
be spring in Busland. ;)
