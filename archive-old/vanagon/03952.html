Subject:      and while we're at it ... (he's after the Unknowns again!)

yes, friends, it's that time of year again! that Great Membership Drive
to Secure Peace in Our Time on this, our Only Inhabited Planet (that we
know of, anyway)!

actually, it's more of a nagging curiosity that i'm after. there are a
bunch of folks on the list who never said what sort of microbus/bus/vanagon/
eurovan/greyhound they have/drive or want to have/drive. so if the following
folks would care (or not) to let me know IF they have a bus, and what sort
of bus it is ... i'd appreciate it. or if you don't have one and someday
maybe possibly could-be want to get one, then i can change your 'status' to
Wannabus instead of Unknown (more acceptable in Polite Society, don't you
know).  or if you don't want to tell me, that's ok too ... it'll just drive
me crazy and i'll probably go to work for the post office and end up doing
something nasty and perverse to all the packages!!! :)

there's no particular reason for this ... other than it started out as a
curiosity and has now grown into a full-blown Obsession (and i don't mean
it smells like perfume)!.

and if you already told me, i'm sorry ... i musta goofed. please tell me
again (us old folks are hard of hearing ... musta been them grenades in the
army). and the 103? well ... it was a Quick Fix to the dippy little 'program'
that comes up with that 'report' of the bus years, and like most Quick Fixes,
it never got 'fixed'. 90 percent of the 'software' in this country has
kludges and quick-fixes. ;)
