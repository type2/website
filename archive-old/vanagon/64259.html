G'day Volks,

As the new to me custodian of a 89&gt;syncro&lt;GL van, with overheating tendancies
- bad fan switch - being replaced - new aircon resistor - works great ! - i
now would like to move on to the radiator - should i pull it and have it
&quot;professionally&quot; flushed etc. or do it my self ? - what would i do.

Thanks Ron and ? for taking over the admin of this great service.  PS. why
would i get responses to posts before the originals get to me ?
