Subject: King pins &amp; link pins


Dyer,

Before you go off the deep end, dismantle your spindles and inspect them.

And think about finding another shop.  Link pins have needle bearings, not
bushings.  And you can replace them yourself simply by removing the old and
installing the new, assuming the races are not seriously worn.  Even then,
it's a simple job with an arbor or hydraulic press.

King-pin replacement requires reaming the new bushings to fit the new
king-pin.  You press out the old bushings, align the new ones to the grease
ports and press them in, then ream them for a firm sliding fit to the new
king-pin.  Lasts about 200,000 miles if kept lubricated.  Link pins seem to
last forever if kept lubricated and adjusted, which should be done at least
every other oil change.  Pull the cotter keys, loosen the clamping bolt,
check the adjustment, re-tighten and re-safety.

King-pins are truck-stuff.  Ball joints are car-stuff.  You want to keep your
truck-stuff.  Easier to maintain, lasts longer, makes your tires wear beater.
 VW ball-joints are crap, difficult to replace and not fitted with lube
fittings, last mebbe 60,000.  Nicer ride, though.

Several dealers offer kits for both king- &amp; link-pin repair.  They are not
expensive but you need the tools, reamer and skills.
