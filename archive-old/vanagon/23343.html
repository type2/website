Subject: 1971 Bus passes CAL smog

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Yes, it's true.  Here in the Bay Area a 1971 bus has successfully passed
it's biennial inspection, late news at ten.

Some of the gory details of The Old War Horse;
AS41 case with a Berg CW 69mm crank &amp; lightweight flywheel
90.5 P/C kit makes this a 1776cc engine, 6.8:1 CR (.1&quot; barrel shims) 87
octane gas
aftermarket one-piece muffler with empty heat exchangers
Correct smog 'stove' pipe in place with the hose nicely clamped up to the
air cleaner
Fairly new 34PICT-2 carb with all the throttle positioner smog fixings
stock 1971 air cleaner with two fittings, hoses in place
funky aftermarket oil filler tube and crankcase vent fittings
electric fuel pump, old one still sitting on the case
older crank pulley with the wrong notches, 0,5,7.5 BTDC marks
engine timed and tuned at 5 ATDC!  This requires both air and mix screws to
be turned out several turns from the 7.5 BTDC setting.
used platinum plugs
almost new plug wires
same stock distributor, cap, rotor and capacitor as I used two years ago

All my fuel injection harness stuff was simply stuffed behind the fan
housing and battery, I took the O2 meter off the dash.

I wondered how much trouble I would get for this engine as presented, given
it's obviously tampered condition.  As it turns out, very little.  In the
past I have had smog techs whine about there being an extra fitting on the
air cleaner (I had one with three, the third plugged) and flunk the car.  At
another shop, with virtually nothing changed, it passed.  This tech looked
things over and was curious, but accepted all the connections as they were.
He checked the gas cap to make sure it was vented.  He commented on the
electric fuel pump hanging in full view and thought it was a good idea.  He
asked if it flooded, I said no (it doesn't).  The only attachment made to
the engine was the inductive #1 spark pick up, and the tube up the exhaust.
Other techs have strobed the engine to make sure it was timed correctly,
this one did not, he just marked down 5 ATDC on the form.  It could have
been timed anywhere as long as it passed.  There is a place on the form for
whether the engine is supposed to be dual exhaust, I'm sure a dual exhaust
would be flunked.  This tech did not actually check to see if the stove was
in place, simply making sure the preheat hose was in place.

The data, after the 2000 rpm run for thirty seconds (for which there is no
specification for 1971 buses but they have to do it)

idle emissions          measured        allowable

HC (ppm)                69              700
CO (%)                  .17             6.00
CO2 (%)                 9.7             NA
O (%)                   6.8             NA
rpm                     838             NA

The tech said it was the cleanest 1971 bus he'd tested.  My cost:$21.70,
with the certificate.

The car actually drives OK around town as it's tuned, though it seems to be
running hotter.  I see no reason to goof with it until I have to drive
freeways and hills and fight the overheating.

wOw
Eug,
'71
