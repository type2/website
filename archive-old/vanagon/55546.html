Subject: Re: squeaking bushings

I think the manual says something about spotwelding the bushings in place
so they don't rotate?   Anybody done that?   Could they be drilled and
pinned?

&gt;Hello fellow Vanagoners!

&gt;I've been following the postings about passenger side squeaky upper
&gt;control arm bushings, a problem that I have as well...my local repair
&gt;shop tells me that the bushings are about 35 bucks apiece and the
&gt;labor to install them brings the damage to about 200 bucks. Does this
&gt;seem reasonable? I've always had good experiences with them, is this
&gt;a job that is best done in the shop? They tell me the problem is
&gt;mostly just the annoyance factor right now but that eventually it
&gt;will effect the handling, in about six months, Thanks for any advice,
