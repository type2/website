Subject: replacing rotors: checking lateral run-out 

I'm in the process of installing new rotors on my 87 syncro and the box
containing the replacement rotors has instructions saying to check the
lateral run-out after installation and refit if necessary. Is this really
necessary? Seems like that in addition to getting a gauge to measure this,
I'd have to remove the front drive axles to spin the wheels to do the
measurement. Comments?
