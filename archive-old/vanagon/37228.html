&gt;   This week I was sick as a dog so I had lot's of time to think
&gt;   up Questions for the Vanagon Syncro Gurus. OK .. out of all the
&gt;   Syncros I've seen (that's not many here in pgh., about 15) more
&gt;   than half have had the transmission replaced or repaired. Anyone
&gt;   have some reason for these failures? I am planing on using my Syncro
&gt;   for some real work: dragging junk car out of the woods, removing
&gt;   tree stumps, some towing of stuck cars. Am I looking for
&gt;   trouble??   TO all who have a Syncro- did your trans. require work??
&gt;

Syncro transmissions fail frequently because they are under a lot of stress.
 In addition, some of the gears run at very high speeds which causes alot of
wear on the bearings.  Especially the low forward and reverse gears(creeper
or cross country).  The ring and pinion assemblies get alot of stress as the
front and rear wheels are allways fighting each other with only viscous
coupling keeping the &quot;Windage&quot; under control.  Common failures include the
following:

Ring and pinion
Pinion Bearing
3/4 slider hub cracking and breaking(poor design, repalcements improved)
cross country housing failing and blowing up(bring a lot of money)
Input shaft main bearing.

Many of these failuers i've seen are lubricant related.  Gear oil either
leaked out, or was cooked out due to excessive the excessive load and heat
these units see.  Secret to long life is maintenance.  Maintain proper oil
level and use best oil you can find, and change it often.  

As for doing work!  The syncro vanagon excels as a people mover or camping
vehicle that nothing else compares with.  It is not designed to pull stumps
and drag cars out of the woods.  Even the chasis will not hold up to this
abuse.  As these vehicles are no longer available and there is nothing else
in it's class,  I feel that abusinsing them in this way is a pathetic act.
 You should sell it to someone that will appreciate it and buy a rundown
jeep, blazer, or subarbun to do your dirty work.  These things will do that
work with liitle trouble and no one will care when it is destroyed.  You will
also save a lot of money on repairs.  The Syncro Vanagon is an excelent
vehicle when used and maintained as designed.  When mistreated, it will
become a piece of junk real quick and you will hold a grudge against the
breed forever.  Just my 2 cents.  Trying to keep the breed around forever.
