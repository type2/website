I use a Coleman potable propane heater in my 86 Wolfsburg.  I get a few
hours on one of the screw in tanks.  I crack a window, and don't go to sleep
with it on.  It is also wise to rig something so it won't turn over.  I
spent 2 winters in Germany and France using this device.  It works ok and is
a lot cheaper than the $600 bucks you will pay for a permanantly mounted
heater.  I still have the heater and use it once in awhile here in
Louisiana.  I also have used a truck piston as a radiator on the propane
stove of a 78 Westy with good results.  I am a retired soldier, and I have
roughed-it in some of the best snow, mud and sand that the world has to
offer.  You may be looking for more comfort than I am.
