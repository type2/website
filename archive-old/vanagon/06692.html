&gt; Admit it, your a Northern kinda guy.  Just admit that your from San Jose. 

	Hey, I'm *from* (was born in) San Francisco. So I happen to
have lived for the last 15 years in the same 1/4 mile area of San Jose,
which the post office insists is Campbell, it don't mean nuttin'! 
	Nuttin, copper! 
	I'm a guest worker, that's what I am. They told me the streets
were going to be paved with gold, that all valves were set at .006 and
everyone ran straight 30 wt and changed their oil every 3000 miles. I
had NO IDEA what I was going to find...

	But if you must know, yeah, I'm a Northern Californian. But hey,
some of my best friends live in Southern California...
