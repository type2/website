Subject: Busses by the Arch (short report)

As always, it was much fun, but the main reason Maria and I went was
to meet the many listmembers (vanagon_at_, type2_at_), of which, it seems,
more and more show up every year. Plus, of course, the fact that we
only live about 30 miles from the campsite... :)

Unfortunately we couldn't stay there overnight because of other
commitments and neither did we join the 5 hour caravan to Illinois
and back, so I'll let others report on BBTA per se. We were just glad
to meet --or see again-- in no particular order (name dropping to
start here) David Schwarze, Dave Easterwood, Jim Brill &amp; Heather, Pete
Sellers &amp; Rose, Tom Forhan &amp; Michelle, Jon Christensen, Jim Kirk &amp;
Cate (?), and I know I must be forgetting somebody else. I did NOT see
Bob Hufford, nor his 21-window superfind (Bob, where were you?) or Dan
Soiney (sp?) and his Manhattans.

I think there was also some talk about organizing a Great Lakes tour
for next summer. Would anyone who was there elaborate?

Anyway, hope everyone made it home safely!

Sami ('75 Westy)
