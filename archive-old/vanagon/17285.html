I replaced the pump on Marth's van.  We got a small pump at Camping 
World for around $40.  There was a 3A fuse on the pump, so you might want 
to check for that.  And the 16A fuse is easy to get to, it's in the hole 
behind the drivers seat, and powers the whole kitchen unit.
The pump under the sink doesn't require water to run.
