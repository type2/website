Subject: Re(2): Nervous about heads

Jaime,

I am using a coolant called &quot;Sierra&quot; which is suppost to be Phosphate free to
prevent corrosion to the system.  It seems to be working fine, but the damage
could be going on even as we speak.  I'm wondering also if it is worth paying
the extra cost of using the VW antifreeze.

Charles
