&gt; First year with the van, being up here in the northeast with all the ice and

&gt; I'm very hesitant to open the top on my van during the winter for fear that
&gt; ice/snow might get under the top and into the canvas or that the top won't
&gt; seal back down to the van correctly due to ice/snow.  Does anyone agree or am
&gt; I being paranoid?

My EV is a non-poptop non-weekender style so I don't have a pop top on 
the EV BUT we did have a '72 pop-top.  Only problem we had in snow was 
the rubber getting to stiff to bend abd store properly.  The canvas parts 
were fine.  We learned this by the way in the middle of July in a snow 
storm in Yellowstone Park not in the real winter.

I don't seem to remember us going out of the way to avoid using the 
pop-top in the winter with one other caveat.  As bad as the 
non-insulation of the metal and fiberglass parts were the canvas was MUCH 
worse.  We might not have had many problems with the canvas because we 
left the pop-top down because of the heat loss thing.
