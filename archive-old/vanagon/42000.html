Subject: Electrical Thanks

Thanks for all those that helped me on my '69 Westy Electrical question.  I
had indeed connected the wires to the left light backwards.  The key being
that they are the reverse of the right side and not identical (this is
because the light bulb is 180 degrees different from the left)  BTW, it is
impossible to install the light upside down so the wires are the only cause
if you ever do that!

Now.....

1.  There is a high-pitched whine coming from the engine compasrtment when
I turn the key to the 'On&quot; position.  Any reasons? (no engine back there
remember)

2.  The tail lights are constantly on as soon as I turn the key to on.  Any
reasons.  The light switch is off.

3.  My steering column has something wrong. The little plastic thing at the
bottom broke and I have no idea how to replace it.  Any ideas?  The result
is that there is now a large gap between the steering wheel and the turn
signal switch. Thanks

4.  Where is a good place to get the 12 point tool for removing CV joints
with the dreaded connections?  Thanks
