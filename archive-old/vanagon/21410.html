i know i am kinda of late on this thread but i am curious:

my van was sold to me as a 68(i haven't done any number checking).
there are two anomolies that stand out to me that i have not seen before.

1. door handles are thumb activated buttons instead of the finger
   activated lever type.

2. there are no vent windows in the rear of the bus.

what do you think?
