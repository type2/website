Subject: Syncro long range fuel tanks found.

For all you Syncronauts,

This may be old news but I've found a (German) source for extra fuel 
tanks to fit T3 Syncros.  Made from stainless steel, left and
right hand tanks are available in  67 or 75 litre sizes (each tank).  
They are TUV approved with a delivery time of 2-4 weeks.  
Ask them for shipping details - they seem willing.
