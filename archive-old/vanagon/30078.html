Subject: 80 Westfalia engine compartment , Bentley manuals, Weekend work 

I read in either the Muir book or the Haynes manual that the engine compartment is a sealed system with the upper part of the engine &quot;sealed&quot; from the lower 
part.  This is to increase cooling efficiency and keep dangerous fumes out of the vehicle.

On my 80 Westfalia I noticed some places where the sheet metal is not intact.  I know about the engine compartment seals but what I describing could be from 
previous modification or rust damage repair.  Does anybody have any suggestions abut how to seal or replace open or weak sections of the engine compartment 
sheet metal.

Also,  what is the group's opinion on the Bentley manuals.  I understand there are two schools of thought on this one.

Thanks.
