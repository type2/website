Subject: 84 Vanagon Westy - Fuel Pump Noise

About 2 months ago I replaced the fuel pump in my '84 Westy and not it
seems to run loudly and almost continuously.  I agree this does not seem
right.  With the old pump it seems like it ran intermittently, like the
pressure regulator was turning it on and off.  Could this problem be
caused by a faulty pressure regulator?  Anybody have any other ideas about
what to check.

Thanks,
John Brown
