Subject: Re: '64 Bus front end &amp; Berkeley info

     Bill,
     
     &gt;I'm looking at some work on my '64 Bus front end.  A couple of people
     &gt;have recommended replacing with a '68 front end -- &quot;it just bolts 
     &gt;up&quot;, they say.
     
     Yep, a '68 front beam has the same bolt pattern as the split so is 
     fits straight on. The '68 was fitted with drum brakes the same as the 
     splits, but because the '68 has balljoints you can fit the disk brake 
     setup off a late bay window bus - the only trouble is then you loose 
     the large 5-stud wheel bolt pattern.
     
     The major problem with the '68 beam is that is rides higher than the 
     split beam. This means that if you fit the '68 as it is the bus will 
     be about 2 inches higher at the front end - and it's noticable!
     
     The only was around this is to lower the beam. This can be done in 
     many ways, but an adustable lowering kit is the best solution as it 
     allows you to tune the buses ride height exactley.
     
     Lee.
