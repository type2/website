Subject: Why's one side hotter (1600 DP)

Something funny's going on. One side (the thermostat/cylinders 1&amp;2 side)
of my '71's 1600 is always hotter than the other side. Since the rebuild
I've had other problems which have kept me from longer trips, so I don't
know how hot she'll get, but driving 4 or 5 miles, I can reach in and
touch the manifold, heat exchangers, heads, exhaust...any part that's on
both sides...and notice a considerable temperature difference--I'd guess
40 or 50 degrees if I only drive 4 or 5 miles.

Would the cooling system be designed to cool the cyl. 3/4 side that much 
more? I thought # 3 was supposed to get hotter.

One variable, which I don't think should have any bearing is that the 
spring for my cooling vanes is off; so the vanes are always open.

Should I be concerned about my cyl. 1/2 head? 

Ideas appreciated.
