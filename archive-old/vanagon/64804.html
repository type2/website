Helmut


Hey Listees,

This is a short introduction to who is who in the german (and other
european countries) names for what this list calles the vanagon.
But-even in europe its different from country to country.

 -Basic version. TRANSPORTER badged panel-van, here called Kastenwagen
                Windows only in the front-compartment and rear window,
          even the rear window could be wanted to be from metal.
          All engines available, autos also available, but most
          of them sold as diesels or turbodiesels with 4-speed.
          Two sliding doors available.

          High-roof version (Hochraumkastenwagen) also available
          from the factory with two versions of sliding-doors,
          normal one and enlarged (higher) one, sold zillion
          times to the post-offices (Deutsche Bundespost) and
          when worn out, converted to home-builded campers.

          Pick-ups and Twin-cabs are also called Transporters,
          pick-ups called Pritschenwagen, also available in a
          wider cargo-bed version, called Grossraum-Pritschenwagen.
          Twin-cabs (or duoble-cabs) are called Doppelkabine.
          All these are badged TRANSPORTER.

 -Kombi        Also a very basic version, some years KOMBI badged.
          Comes with a body like the vanagon, that means its got
          windows all around.
          Available with 2 (vinyl) seats only in the drivers
          compartment or with up to 9 seats. Skyliner only above
          the front seats, rest is covered with hardboard. Very
          loud and basic car, very often commercial used to carry
          builders to and from work or as delivery cars. The car
          that the boss gives to his employees, not for his own use.
          High-roof versions also available.

          hand-made synchros ever builded for vvvips, one still known
          with a wbx6 oettinger).
          Sold as busines cars.
          80% of those you see here in germany have been used by
          VW factory as first owner.

 -Multivan     The multi purpose van with a westfalia made folding bed,
          folding desk, one seat behind the drivers seat against
          driving direction, 12 V DC/220 V AC -cooling box (peltier)

          pvc covered in the back, clip in curtains, 2nd battery.

          It seems, the basic car is a Caravelle C with all the above
          mentioned goodies including a CL steering wheel.

 -Redstar Sold in late 92, some seen with 93 registration.
          Made because of the enormous response of the LLE, dont
          know how many, not seen offered at the dealership,
          spec like the red LLE w/o LLE Badges.
          Many of them sold to VW factory workers. I have only seen
          1.6 l TDs yet.


 -Tristar The ultrarare 4 door Twincab with High-end-Interior.
          Special Edition, seen in white, green and red. I ve seen
          four over the years, three TDs and one 2.1 digifant. I ve
          only seen synchros so far, but with a number of four that
          does not mean too much.


 -Westfalias   The campers came from Westfalia-nearly all of them.
          They were badged TRANSPORTER or CAMPING, I think that
          depends on the year.
          Different specifications, not everything available all
          years.
          Two different roofs, pop up top (like pre 79s) or fixed
          polyester high-roof (not the above mentioned commercial
          high-roof).
          4 berth, fridges LPG/12V DC/220V AC,
          sink, gas cooker, turnable passengers seat, 2 batteries.
          Eberspaecher petrol-heater available. 2WD and 4WD synchro
          versions available, all known engines available, from
          special 1.6 l (yes!!!) and 2.0 l aircooled to 1.6 l Diesel, TD,
          1,9 l petrol to 2.1 digijet/digifant injection, depending on
          the year.
          All Westfalias are called JOKER. JOKER and SPORT JOKER
          are basic versions (it seems they are based on the KOMBI)
          CLUB JOKER was the higher range camper that seemed to base
          on something like the Caravelle C or CL.


Vanagon        Yes, we have had Vanagon badged busses here. In 1991
          when the Caravelles have been sold out and the T4
          (Transporter, 4th Generation, official VW-slang) was new,
          some intelligent people still wanted the old shape and
          got it- from the US and Canada, where some were
          still sitting in the dealers showrooms.
          They have been re-imported to Fatherland, converted to
          German Headlights+++ and sold by the VW dealership.
          I guess it must have been about 500 cars, but thats only
          estimated.

          But more than that have been oficially sold by VW- the
          two camper versions called &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Atlantic&quot;.
          Both are 2WD 90s, non Joker but VANAGON badged campers,
          sold directly by Volkswagen, as far as I know assembled in
          Hannover, not Westfalia-Wiedenbrueck.
          They have been slightly cheaper than the Club-Joker
          with the same high-end interior and power steering,
          power lock plus the carat styled bumpers.
          Californias are white or dark red, Atlantics are
          calypso light green metallic, TD or 2.1 digifant. I ve
          seen Californias with both roofs, but can only remember
          to high-roof Atlantics.


Thats it with german vanagon (or T3, transporter 3rd Generation) history in
short form.

I will never forget that weekend back in late 79, when I was sitting in my
58 on a
campground, looking to the brandnew camper beside us and telling my
girlfriend, that I would never get used to that shape...now its history and
I wished I had kept my 88 2.1digijet auto multivan...Goodthanks I have
never sold the 58.
Please excuse my terrible english. Is anybody out there a teacher who could
send me a corrected version back (still try to learn...)?

BTW, I have problems to get in the List-Digest mode. Listserv always sends
me back
a message that I would not be subscribed, but I still get mail.
For the next three weeks we are going on tour with our 77 westy, so I will
have
to unsubscribe from tuesday to avoid undelivered mails (mailbox is only 100
mails deep).

I hope to find you back in a few weeks time,
best wishes from Germany,

Michael Meier
(20 mls from Wolfsburg)
