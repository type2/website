Subject: Vanagon back hatch

Vanagon owners!
	I'm relatively new in the vanagon scene but I've noticed
with many of the vanagons that the ...I'm not sure what they are
called...maybe support struts that hold up the back hatch have
been under designed.  They must go bad after about 7 years.
It was interesting to see the creative ways of proping   ping up that
deADLY hatch.  I'm currently using a tomato stake.  Anyway
is there or has there been anything designed to replace
these wimpy struts?
