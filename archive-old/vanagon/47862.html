Subject: Re: valve adjustment proceedure

Dave,
Finally got someone who agrees with me. I just kept asking people until I got
the answer I wanted. I, too, have always been hesitant to rotate the engine
backwards, especially when it's been sitting all night and there's no oil on
anything. I don't depend on remembering any sequence to tell me which valve I'm
supposed to be working on. I always check the position of the rotor and the
timing mark before I adjust each valve. 
Thanks. You made my day.


&gt; I've always taken the little bit of extra trouble to set them in the
 &gt;1-4-3-2 order, turning the engine clockwise, since the idea of turning
&gt; the engine counter-clockwise and thereby sending the oil in the oil pump
 &gt;and feed lines back to the sump doesn't appeal to me. I really don't 
 &gt;know if this is a legitimate worry, however. Any thoughts?
