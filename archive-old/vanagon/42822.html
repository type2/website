&gt; I doubt you blew out the alternator from a second battery.  Must have been
&gt; combined with other overload and or short circuit.

Keyword, ammeter.  Dave had 2 batteries that he used to run his fridge all
weekend.  When he ran the engine the batteries started charging, pegged the
meter, and it then ceased functioning.  But Dave is the one that can talk
about his follies best. :)
