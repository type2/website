Hi guys,
	Thanks alot for the suggestions - penetrating oil, whacking with hammer
and a decent screwdriver did the trick although I broke one of the star points
in the process. 
	Everyone told me how hard it would be getting the hubs off, no one said
how hard they'd be to get back on again! I managed it in the end - is the trick
to put the hub &amp; wheel on separately?
	Ok, so rear hubs are get-off-able, now I'm having problems with the front
ones - how do you get the cover/seal thing in the centre of the hub off? (not
the chrome hub-cap, the thing inside in the middle - sorry, I don't know what
it's called). Muir says use screwdriver and hammer, but mine isn't budging. It
doesn't even look like a separate thing! Am I trying to do something stupid?
	
Cheers,

Sarah
