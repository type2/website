&gt; &gt; But who'd want a cat stuck in their ventilation system?  They'd get wet
&gt; &gt; from the condensation and smell worse than a diesel...
&gt;
&gt;How about soaking the cats in diesel or any heavy lubricant before
&gt;putting them in the vent. system?  Even if they get stuck, they'd
&gt;smell no worse than the diesel :-) :-)


Try my popcorn-in-the-heater-boxes trick (see &quot;Manifold Destiny&quot; thread
from a few weeks back). Stuck or not, those cats/ferrets/mice will be
outta there, one way or another, fast! Bus will smell better, too.
