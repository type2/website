&gt;Today I bought a Westfalia accessory tent (The Drive-Away model with floor)
&gt;and it brings up a question about tent poles.  Perhaps some of the people
&gt;with tents have had a similar experience.  The tent looks good and all the
&gt;poles but one seem to be in reasonably good shape.  That pole is one of the
&gt;upper corner poles and is a little over-bent.  That is, the pole naturally has
&gt;a bend in it of about 60 degrees or so but this one is bent about 75 degrees
&gt;and there is a bit of a crease in the underside and very small cracks on
&gt;the outside edges.  I need to straighten this and reinforce it.  Has anyone had
&gt;any experience doing this?  What I though I would do would be to slowly bend
&gt;it back to the normal angle, tapping the sides with a hammer to remove the
&gt;crease, then weld the cracks closed and weld on a small, flat piece of metal
&gt;for a brace inside the bend.  (The poles seem to be steel since my magnet
&gt;sticks to it.) Other observations so far: This is a well made, *heavy* tent.

Hi, can I ask you a few questions about the Westie tent?

     1.  Where did you get it? :-)

     2.  Is this the tent with the yellow and blue 'racing stripes' on it?

     3.  If there is a part number on the tent, is it 216 010 433 045?

Thanks in advance!
Ron
