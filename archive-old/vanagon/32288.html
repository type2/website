Subject: chrome lock strip

 
Hi people,

	Does any person out there in computerland know how much the 
locking strip that goes around all the window rubbers cost?

	If (HA HA !) it is expensive, is there an altenative product 
that will replace mine?

	Mine has turned all brown and dull.  It has also started to crack 
on the windshield sections.
