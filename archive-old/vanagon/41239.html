&gt;does anybody know the maximum battery dimensions for fitting under the

I recently came across a battery in a stereo magazine that might do the
trick.  I have not bought one yet, though, so I cannot give any sort of
review.  Here are the details:

Stinger dry cell Power Master  (Model SPB-1000)
     True Deep-cycle battery
     Withstands more than 400 cycles of 100% discharge
     6 9/16&quot;L x 7 13/16&quot;W x 6 11/16&quot;H
     32.4 lbs.
     5 year service life

               Draw:       Capacity:
              ------       ----------------------------
               2.3A        46   amp hours    (20 hours)
               4.2A        42   amp hours    (10 hours)
               5.1A        40.8 amp hours    (8 hours)
               7.8A        39   amp hours    (5 hours)
              33.5A        33.5 amp hours    (1 hour)

It looks very good.  For more information, call Stinger Electronics at
800.477.2267.
