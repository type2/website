Subject: Re: 82 Vgon supplemental heater questions



&gt;My question is how good are these for heat?  Are they reliable?

Yes, but they must be run every month or so year round to keep them 
in proper operating condition.

&gt;fire hazards?

In my opinion, not really, if the safety devices are properly 
operating.  This heater has a number of safety mechanisms that are 
supposed to shut it down instantly in the event of a malfunction 
that can cause a hazard.  In my experience, the design is 
overcautious if anything; that is, it is more likely to shut down 
your heater when it DIDN'T have to, then fail to shut it down when 
it did have to. 

&gt;Are they repairable?

Yes.  Rudimentary repair info is in the Vanagon Bentley manual.  I 
have more detailed info if you need it.  There are several sources 
for parts, some of whom advertise in HotVW, VW Trends, etc.  
Junkyards are also an option.  (By the way, many parts are 
interchangeable with those from the BA4, which was stock in the 
type 4 and sometimes easier to find at a junkyard.)

&gt;Should I disect mine to check it out?

Yes. But be careful, as this is a gas furnace and could potentially 
be unsafe if incorrectly reassembled.

&gt;Do people use them for heat?  Is there hope for this one?  Any 
&gt;insight or other info you may have would be appreciated.

I put one in my '77 Westfalia and was VERY happy with the heat 
output.  Better than the heat in my present water-cooled Westy, and 
no waiting for the van to warm up!
 
&gt;Are these the same as the &gt;BN4 or BN6s I see talked about on the 
&gt;type II list?

No, this is a BA6, which was optional on type II's from '76 on.  
The BN models were only used on earlier buses, and mounted in the 
engine compartment rather than under the vehicle.
