&gt; I can remember when there were only the following Typ2s on the
&gt; road:
&gt; a: None at all
&gt; b. Split Windshields
&gt; c. Split Windshields and Bread Loaves
&gt; d. Split Windshields, Bread Loaves, and Bricks
&gt; e. Split Windshields, Bread Loaves, Bricks, and those WAY COOL
&gt;    EuroVans
&gt; f. Don't remember anything.....too many experiments back in the
&gt;    60s with mind altering drugs
