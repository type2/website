Ding,Ding,Ding  We have a winner

We call her Rosa (roll the r) for short.

&gt; well, ursine may be Bear, but my sign is Capricorn (or is it Sagitarius?)
&gt; which is the Goat (or is it the Crab??) ... well, no matter. i've been called
&gt; an old goat, and i've been called an old crab. but technically, i belong to
&gt; the clan of the cave bear ... cause when the days grow shorter, i tend to want
&gt; to hibernate. :)
&gt; 
&gt; and besides, i'm a omnivore and big enough and hairy enough to be a bear.
&gt; not a Grizzly, mind you ... more like a Panda with an attitude. :)
