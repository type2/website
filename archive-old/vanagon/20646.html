     &gt;&gt;&gt;Uh, I also found my die-cast Millenium Falcon but you guys probably 
     &gt;wouldn't
     &gt;&gt;&gt;care about that.
     &gt;
     &gt;This is also a good thing,  I just watched the triolgy on TBS last 
     &gt;week.
     &gt;Supposedly Star Wars is to be rerelased in '97(20 years, yech), with 
     &gt;updated
     &gt;F/X
     
     I heard that they are going to make the first three episodes as well.
