Thanks for all of the info so far!!
So it sounds like I can put mid 80's Audi or Mercedes Benz 15&quot; wheels on 
my 87 Westy....some folks mentioned that some machining may be required 
to do so. Are there ANY known years for Audi wheels that will just 
bolt on??? It would be nice to just go through the wheel adds in the car 
magazines and pick out wheels for a mid-late 80's Audi and have a chance 
of them fitting!!!!
