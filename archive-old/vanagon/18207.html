Subject: Help a paint newbie!

Hey folks!

After much prodding by my wife (and others), I've decided to look into
getting myself set up for doing paint work at home.  I know there are some
of you out there who do this (Arne and Thom come immediately to mind) so I
hope you can shed some light for me.  The line of argument for doing this
is that I've got the '68 bug to paint.  From my thumbnail sketches, I won't
save any (or much) money painting it myself, but the investment in
equipment, and learning the skills, will pay off with subsequent projects,
which, cleverly, my wife is assuming I will undertake ;-)  Fortunately, the
body of the '68 is completely straight and already in primer, so there is
nearly no bodywork or de-rusting that needs to be done.  I've looked
briefly through a couple of how-to books, but that is the limit of my
experience.

My questions follow two tacks:  practical and how-to.  Right now, I'm
mainly looking at the practical, to see if this is something I can really
do.  If I decide to go for it (which, if you couldn't tell, I'm leaning
towards right now), I'll get to the more particular how-to questions later.

So for now, what basic equipment will I need to get myself going?  Here is
the list that I've put together.  Please send me comments on any or all of
these items, and, especially, let me know if I've left anything off.

Compressor.  I'm limited to the (dedicated) 120 volt line in my garage.
Why didn't I put in 220 while I was at it?  I don't know...  I'm assuming
that I should get the most horsepower and largest tank that I can afford.
What sort of cfm rating will I need for painting and media blasting?  Any
brands better than any others?

Hoses.  Type?  Brand?  How many feet will I need?

Gun.  HVLP?  Brand?  Remote cup?  Greg, if you saved those files from
VINTAGVW as we discussed, could you send them my way?

Respirator.  Type?  Brand?

Sanding equipment.  Anything other than elbow grease?  Will I need a random
orbit sander?  Also, how much paper of each grit should I count on needing?
FYI, this car is already in primer- little or no heavy sanding is needed.

Blowing attachment.  Do I need one?  This is the little gizmo that sticks
on the end of the hose and just blasts air out with a trigger.

Sand/media blasting equipment.  The only things that need blasting on this
project are the wheels and possibly the fenders (which are new, but in
cheesy primer.)  What kind of set up will do for this, or should I send
them out?  What media would I use for best results?

Cleaning/Solvents.  What will I need for cleaning both the car and the
equipment?

Finally, are any types of paint more suitable (er, easier!) for beginners?

I know this is a ton of questions, but I'm really looking forward to doing
this project and I'm going to need a little guidance.  If anyone has saved
files relating to these questions from previous discussions, please send
them my way.  Every little bit will help at this point.  Also, I'd be more
than happy to compile this information into a FAQ if there is interest.

Thanks!
Bill
