&gt; thinking about changing over, and don't want to have to worry about a huge
&gt; amount of sludge dislodging and clogging up my filter (and hoses and oil
&gt; galleys).
&gt; 

Just my $.02.  I've heard that on the ail-cooled engines that because of
the thin quality of syntheitc oil, that it easily seeps out of the gaskets
and leaks.  For this reason, I would shy away from synthetic oil.  Besides
I tend to change the oil fairly frequently.
