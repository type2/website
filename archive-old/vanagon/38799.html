Subject:       buying a used tranny.

I was wondering how you can tell a good tranny from a bad one at a 
swap meet.  At the last meet I went to there were some all painted up 
purty and supposidly rebuilt.  Others were just pulled and their 
sellers calimed they were in good condition.  When people want cash 
only and you know you will never see them again, how do you protect  
yourself?
Ed.
