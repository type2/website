Subject: replacing windscreen seals

Sarah,

I don't know who you talked to about the windscreen seals,
but with four hands, a piece of twine (I prefer nylon), some
lubricant and 10 minutes, the glass should go in with no
problem.

Getting the glass *out* is a task more prone to breaking the
glass than getting it in.  Since you're buying new seals
anyway, just use a sharp(!) blade to carefully cut the
inside of the seal off so the glass slides out with no
stress on it.

Simply put, put the seal around the glass, wrap the twine
(twice) around the outside of the seal and push the
(well-lubricated) assembly into the opening from the
outside.  The helper on the outside keeps pressure from the
outside while you on the inside s.l.o.w.l.y pulls the twine
out of the channel in the seal which pulls the seal over the
lip in the windscreen opening.  The outside pressure should
follow the string around as it is pulled out.  The &quot;twice
around&quot; method helps to assure that if a spot gets missed on
the first pass, it will be made up on the second.
