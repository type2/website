&gt;Hello, I'm looking for the ecu without the aid of a Bently :(
&gt;Can anyone please tell me where specifically it is and what it looks 
&gt;like? I opened a couple of black boxes connected to wire harnesses, 
&gt;but all I found was two relays in one and wire harness connectors in 
&gt;the other. I'm trying hard to not win the record for most money put 
&gt;into a van in one year award.

It's under the rear bench seat on the right side.  It is covered by a black,
sheet metal cover.

Good Luck,
