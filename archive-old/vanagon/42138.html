&gt; &gt;are you SURE it was a Trooper?? and not maybe an imported VW Ilitis??
&gt; &gt;VW makes a trooper-looking sort of vehicle for the german army.
&gt; 
&gt; I think he could be right (again!):
&gt; 
&gt; This vehicle was seen in the Washington DC area, where you can often 
&gt; find non-US models of foreign cars on the streets, because diplomats 
&gt; don't have to comply with those pesky US DOT and EPA regulations. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the German military (airforce?) has a substantial presence
&gt; in the DC area, as they have a training facility or something out at
&gt; Dulles airport. They bring their own military vehicles.

Color was burgandy and I'm pretty sure it had Virginia plates.  Driver 
had a full beard which didn't look very military.  The vehicle did have a 
tubular grill guard kind of thing though.
