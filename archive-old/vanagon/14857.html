&gt; I'd suspect you may be leaking gas rather than burning it. Do you smell
  gas? Especially when cornering with a fullish tank? If so, you may be
  leaking from the rubber elbow where the fill pipe  connects with the
  tank. Another possibility is a leaky fuel pump diaphragm. There is a 
  little hose on the pump that directs leakage in to the cooling air
  stream below cylinders 1 &amp; 2 &lt;it's the one that goes thru the sheet 
  metal&gt;. Pull it off at the pump. There should be NOTHING coming out 
  of it. 

  My '72 had 137.5 main jets and never got great mileage &lt;17-20&gt;, but it
  never got as bad as 14. During the time I had that bus I had several 
  fuel leaks from various places: Cracked hoses, leaky fuel pump, one
  of the little brass tubes where the hose connects to a carburetor came
  loose, etc., etc. It's not expensive and probably a good idea to simply
  replace every piece of rubber fuel line between the tank and the carbs
  if you've got the time.

&gt;  My gas mileage has hit an all-time low of 14 mpg. I have a 72' 1700
&gt; and I'm at my wits end as to how to get more miles for the buck. I've
&gt; changed the ignition system completely (i.e. brand new), I've checked
&gt; the compression and its A-OK and I've changed the cut-off jets in the
&gt; carburator. All of these things were done on the advice of
&gt; mechanics... What I have not yet attempted is a carb equalization. I
&gt; didn't think it needed one because the engine runs like a Swiss
&gt; timepiece. Any suggestions? Is the &quot;volume control&quot; screw really just 
&gt; an idle mixture screw? If not, then is there a volume control screw on
&gt; the passenger's side carb? AAArgh, I hate not being able to drive my VW...
