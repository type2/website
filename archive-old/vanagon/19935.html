Yes, count me in as one who is saving the world by fixing up a very 
old and rusty VW bus.  At the very least it keeps my attentions away 
from thoughts of killing the neighbors and their barking dogs and loud
cars and stereos.  Not to mention the fact that some of them might 
make a living at a bank.  This push-button world is certainly 
spiralling into something.  I am not smart enough to know where 
exactly but it sure doesn't look good from my vantage point.  From the
moment I first laid a 13mm wrench on a VW motor I knew it was right.  
Muir is much better at explaining this, but the sense of 
accomplishment that comes from coaxing a hunk of steel to life with 
nothing more than a few handtools is the beginning of big things.
When that motor died I set out to put in a new one.  I am days away 
from yanking out the old one and putting in the new one.  In the 
meantime I ride my bike and walk.  When I am done fixing it myself I 
will drive it to hell and back, or at least California.  Now, where 
does Joe or Jane Citizen get the same sense of satisfaction?  Can it 
be from driving the Taurus through Jiffy Lube?  Hey, they even to the 
carpets!  Good thing I don't have any in the bus.  I would really be 
getting ripped off.  Let me jump off this soapbox now.  Jim
