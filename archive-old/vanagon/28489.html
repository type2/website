&gt;I certainly would. That'd be a good place to start rusting. You wouldn't 
&gt;notice it for awhile, hopefully. You shouldn't have to use your spare. I 
&gt;might even squirt some silicone rubber stuff on the screws you use to 
&gt;attach the mounting bracket. 
Dammit, Jim, what's this fixation with silicone you have??  It's comments
like this that lead to the eventual downfall of civilization...  oops...
Never Mind.  :-)

================================
We should probably pardon  Capt. Kirk (AKA Jim) for his preoccupation with
silicon -- It has long been hypothesized that there are silicon based life
forms &quot;out there&quot; in contrast to the carbon base life forms here on Terra, and
he is probably haveing flashbacks to previous voyages. (Voyages not Voyeurs!!!
