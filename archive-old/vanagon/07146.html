Subject: Re: vw magazines


&gt;who knows of what magazines out there, specifically ones dedicated to vw's
&gt;(and buses if you know of one)?  i know there is a british magazines and one
&gt;in france as well, that you can receive from some folks in the states (EWA
&gt;i think is the one ... but the subscriptions are rather costly).


There are two German ones as well:

Gute Fahrt
I suppose it is written by VW itself and therefore quite biassed. Non-technical.

VW-Szene
Deals with all VW models. It has quite a lot of good ads. Sometimes they 
write a technical article, but not often.

T.S.
