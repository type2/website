Subject: Re: Steering Locks


As far as I know steering locks were available for all years of splitty's 
although if there were barndoor ones made, i can imagine what price one of those 
would fetch.

I seem to recall that steering locks were more of the &quot;de-rigeur&quot; over in 
Europe, and were rarer over here in N. America.

Both steering locks and gearshift locks were available. I am unaware of steering 
locks being repro'ed (they can still be found at swap meets)but I am pretty sure 
that Bob Scott's Vintage Parts (or whatever the correct name of the business is) 
In Cali. is still selling gearshift locks. Anyone better able to confirm this?

BTW can anyone authoritatively tell me if steering locks also require a 
different steering box set up than the conventional one? What is exactly 
entailed in installing a sterring lock and getting it functioning? I would like 
to hear from anyone that has installed a steering lock
