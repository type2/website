&gt; 
&gt; What is the allowable speed range for the fifth &quot;creeper&quot; gear in the
&gt; Vanagon Syncro transmission?
&gt; 

It has exactly half (twice?) the gear ratio of first gear, so whatever is
the maximum allowable speed in first, divide by two and you have the high
speed granny gear!

&gt; Were Syncros available with automatic transmissions?
&gt; 

Not in the US.  Probably not in Europe either, but who knows?
