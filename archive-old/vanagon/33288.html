Subject: sunroof drains.

	Mike,
	My actual experince is limited to my Rabbit and Corrado, but
on them the drains are located at the front corners of the cut-out 
the sliding roof sits in. A piece of wire would be a good start for
cleaning it out- bend a little hook on the end and pull the crud
back up and out rather than trying to push it down and through, my
advice. Pouring a little hot, soapy water through probably wouldn't
hurt.h

	Bill
