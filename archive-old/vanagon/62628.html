Subject: Replacing Outside mirror glass

Is it possible to replace the glass in the (manual) outside mirror on an 
'84?  I have one with a broken mount and good glass and one that's the 
opposite and would like to make one good mirror.  The local junkyard was 
all out (gave me the broken one free) and the dealer seems unable to 
order left side mirrors (the keep getting right side mirrors that are 
mislabeled!).

Bill
