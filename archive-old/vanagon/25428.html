Subject: Re: Gas Heater Documentation


I believe the same BN-4 Eberspracher (guessing at that spelling)  was 
used in the Things and Buses.  The 181 Registry has reprints of the 
manual available.  email at &lt;Vwtype181_at_aol_dot_com&gt;.  Don't have a phone 
number handy.

good luck

&gt; Hey, where can I get documentation on the gas heater in my '71 bus? I'd
&gt; like to go through mine before really cold weather sets in, but it didn't
&gt; sound like there were any really good places to have work done. When I
&gt; bought the bus, the PO said the heater worked. She also told me lots of
&gt; things I've found to be true from her perspective and false from mine. 
&gt; I'm reluctant to fire up the heater until I know more about how it works. 
&gt; I'd rather be cold in a bus than warm by a charbroiled breadloaf. Any
&gt; pointers toward info will be appreciated.

&gt; Thanks! Joe
