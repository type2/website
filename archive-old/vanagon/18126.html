&gt; So Jeff P. Schneiter says:

&gt; &gt; Your basic 1972 Westfalia, engine in many many pieces, but it used
&gt; &gt; to run :) Body is in good shape, very minimal rust, good brakes and
&gt; &gt; transmission. And an aux. heater!!

&gt; So will this put you back in the wanna-buy category Jeff?

Not for a while. I am currently looking for a job in Colorado, so I
can live with my bro, pay off bills, then when I do have enough
money I will once again be on the hunt.

I guess I will be in the vw-on-the-brains category.

Any Colorado people out there?
