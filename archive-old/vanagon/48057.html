&gt; &gt;water clear lens when off.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; I know radio shack has these water clear LEDs at a good price.
&gt; know if we can just buy the caps???

well, these don't use caps.  i meant 'water clear lens' when the LED 
is off electrically.... a true blue light LED.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;$7.31 for one or $5,417.75 for 1000.
&gt;                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; we better think of _a_lot_ of places to use them :-)

aye.  that's a whole lot of high beam indicators.
