Subject: Opinions on later models (vanagon/EV)

For those of you with '82+ vanagons and EV's, 

I have a friend who has asked my opinion of VW's for his needs.  They are:

Salesman. (his territory covers Miami to New Orleans to Raleigh/Durham)

High-mileage driver (55K+ per year)

Non-mechanic. (shade tree or otherwise)

His car needs include the ability to go long distances reliably, be
comfortable to drive long distances, must be air conditioned, std trans,
good gas mileage, and the ability to pack the thing with a large amount of
high bulk/low weight samples.  He would also like to have a hitch to tow his
(~21') Sea Pearl boat short distances.

My experience is limited to air-cooled Vdubs, and I love crawling around
under them, but my definition of reliable is: &quot;I can change the engine out
at a rest area&quot;.  I realize that his needs are a bit different, and wonder
if any of you do the travelling salesman/high mileage thing with a VW.  All
opinions welcomed.

                             TIA,
                             Steve
