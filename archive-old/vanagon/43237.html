Subject: VW Vanagon Official Factory Repair Manual

Greetings,
  I saw listed for $79.95 in the JC Whitney catalog the Volkswagen 
Vanagon Official Factory Repair Manual.  I generally buy all such manuals 
for vehicles I acquire.  So I asked a person who runs a service facility 
about this, and he called a local dealership for me.  He learned that 
they charge $70.30 &quot;trade wholesale&quot; for it and $84.95 &quot;list.&quot;  Then I 
checked a chain book seller.  It was interesting to find that their CD 
based information data base had three different spellings for Volkswagen, 
and each produced different outputs.  Beware if you chase data base info 
on these machines.  That effort showed a listing which is in a print-out 
before me.  The ISBN number that all book sellers will want to locate a 
volume is 0-8376-0336-6, and their publisher's code was 00003549.  This 
shows yet another price, $89.95.
  A local dealership employee said they'd disposed of all those manuals 
as they took too much room and are now on their micro fische.  Much 
anguish.  I know JC Whitney often includes catalog wide discount coupons, 
so their $79.95 becomes less 10% plus shipping.  Dealer wholesale is 
possible, to which tax would be added.  These are options.  The book 
sellers discount card price is still uncompetitive.
  OK, is this the best single book for maintaining and understanding 
Westfalias?  It's supposed to be 1200 pages.  If someone has a used copy 
they'd like to sell, I'm an interested party.  Perhaps someone else has 
some insights into my desire for documentation.  If so, please jump in.
	Thankzzzzzzz,
	John Wakefield
