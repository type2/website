&gt; Thanks Al, for that GREAT and informative trip report!

&gt; I, for one, am happy with staying at either place, and will let
&gt; the rest of you decide.  However, I must tell you that I'm a patsy
&gt; for pot-bellied pigs (NOT human ones).

Well, I looked over my map and couldn't find it, but I think I figured out 
about where it is.  I think I would rather go with the more northerly 
place.   :)

I don't really want to drive my bus 370 miles each way.  And I'm not sure 
if I'll really be free that weekend, but I mostly am.  But is there any 
one that would want to give me, my beer, and a load of firewood a ride?  
I don't even have to bring food... just beer, and I can scrape a prune 
out of my pocket, I'm sure.

Logistically, a pickup would be best for the wood, and Thom is planning 
on going....  :)

Bradley
