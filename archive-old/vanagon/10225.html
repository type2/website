Subject: Re: Brazilian Bus: The Plan

ric seems slightly pessimistic about this plan.
how about i make the bus water tight and use it as a boat to florida where i
will be rescued as a haitian refugee, then i will tell the coast gaurd i was
just going for a float in my new van with a US VIN.
this plan must work seeing as the coast gaurd must be dumber than the border
patrol.
