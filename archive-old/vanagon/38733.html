Subject: seeking METAL 1/3 roof rack

  Howdy all. I currently have an all metal crew cab-length roof rack, which I
liked very much on my '67 standard. However, as I have moved up to a  '67
pop-top, it is now too long. So, I would therefore like an all-metal 1/3 length
roof rack, which would fit nicely behind the pop-top. I do not really want a
wood slat rack, as they are too expensive, and valuable, and also I would be
afraid of over-loading it, and messing it up. So, then, if anyone has such a
beast, and wants to sell it cheap, I would be interested. Late model racks will
fit splits, at least as far as the ones I have seen. I would also not mind
trading for my rack, but it looks pretty rough (but structurally sound). My
other choice is to have a welder chop about 18&quot; out of the middle of mine.
Anyway, any interest???
