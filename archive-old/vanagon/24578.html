Subject: Hot Air Ballon Festival in NE
Date: Mon, 11 Sep 95 16:19:50 EDT

I just thought I'd mention this as it is a pretty cool
event.  This weekend in Morgantown, WV there will be the
somethingth annual hot air balloon festival.  Been going
on quite a few years now and draws quite a crowd and a lot
of ballons, like 20-50 I don't know, haven't been in a while.
It features a &quot;night glow&quot; this Thursday night where they
all raise after dark for a truly spectacular sight, then
ballooning all weekend.  If anyone is interested, I'll look
into the schedule and reply to you, makes a pretty interesting
weekend and there is some OK camping about.  Morgantown is
about 3.5-4 hours Bus time from DC, 1.5 hours from Pittsburg,
etc.  You can just wonder around looking at the baloons,
pay for rides, etc.  Hell if a few people are interested in
coming, I might organize a picnic on Saturday.
