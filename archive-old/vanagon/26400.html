Subject: Re: Vans in europe?


&gt;&gt; An English friend of mine said there used to be a bridge in or
&gt;&gt; near London where traveling Australians would hang out, buying
&gt;&gt; and selling VW buses.  Apparently they got hounded out of
&gt;&gt; that area, but I'm sure they just moved somewhere else.  Any
&gt;&gt; UKers or Aussies know any more?

&gt; Well originally it was Earls Court, but they all moved on from there
&gt; a few years ago, and I'm not sure where now. But I understand the Oz 
&gt; network is alive and well and still buying/selling campers.
&gt; They've got their own magazine that you can find around the place
&gt; which would be a good way to start. Failing that, 3 times a week
&gt; an advertising paper called `Loot' (costs around a pound) is released that 
&gt; quite often contains camper ads.

 Last I heard (sometime over the summer) they'd moved to Market Street, which
 is close to King's Cross in central London. For more Aussie info, as well
 as free magazines there's even an Aussie radio station which operates over
 the summer.
 
 Rob.
