Buying time? I have the  opportunity to purchase a 1983 Vanagon. It has
the full camper package.  The body and interior is in excellent
condition.  There is not a knob missing in the whole van. The clutch has
less than 3k on it.  The PO stated that a problem in the fuel system
forced gasoline into the oil and caused the motor to fail.  It was
parked before the motor locked up, but he limped it home by changing the
oil 4 times in 600 miles.  The oil is water thin and snells of gas.
PO suggested regrinding the crank and putting in larger bearing would
fix the problem. This job is beyond my abilities, and possibly billfold.

I can purchase the Van for $2000.
Is that to much for a none running camper.
How expensive will repairs be?

specs:  4 speed
	AC needed repair
	newish clutch 
	110k on body
	one rip in canvas
	top seal is brittle
	no rust in body
	Van has been sitting for 3 years.
   Should I rebuild or swap engines?
   Would this make a good motor up grade candidate?	
   If so what engine?
Any input will be appreciated.
