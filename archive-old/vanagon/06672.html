So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648 says:
&gt; Why ASCII.  Why not a Web page with map of the world.  Click on a dot, get
&gt; full color photo of van and owner, click again for full scanned repair history
&gt; with receipts.  Other hypertext jumps for each cat, musical instrument, 
&gt; fish dish, flannel pattern.  C'mon Joel, it's almost 1995, and whatever we
&gt; *can* do, we *must* do.  It's the Internet way.
&gt; B.
&gt; 

Yeah, like all of us have access to scanners and such....
