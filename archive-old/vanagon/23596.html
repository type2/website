Subject: Save this Bus, I can't
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 95 21:04:08 EDT

     If anyone around WV is interested, the guy I mentioned
months ago still has the '65 Deluxe (non sunroof), running
up to 35-40 mph (at least), stops, needs lots o floor on
passenger side behind double doors, otherwise OK, origional
1500 sp, all lights and signals, wiper motors work, interior
mostly trash, missing middle seat, all yours for probably
around the whopping sum of $100-$150.  Certainly could part
the thing for $500, maybe could save as driver, really only
needs the common front floor side panels, and the cargo
floor panel to be runnable.  Interested parties, email me
and I'll go make an offer for you.  I would save her but
got no storage for the beast.  Also I recently noticed a
fairly restorable, '67 non pop top Westy, last plated '78
OK shape, solid floors all round, only some surface rust getting
out of hand, and lack of passenger side rocker that could
probably be available if someone was interested, can't seem
to ever find the owner, but if anyone needs, tell me a reasonable
offer and I'll leave it on the houses door.  Plus if of any value
as well, I found a '67 pop top Westy in a yard, nasty front
hit, and interior pretty trashed, but GAS HEATER in place though
engine cover gone for many years and heater exposed, might
be worth parts, this Bus also has of all things an aftermarket
A/C unit inside custom fit under the dash, go figure A/C and
gas heat on a '67 certainly a stylin Bus till it met a wall or
something nearly as big and hard.  Anyway any interest, email
me and I'll make inquiries.
