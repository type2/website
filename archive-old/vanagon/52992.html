&gt; In my pursuit to increase gas mileage I came across this item . It is a
&gt; device that fits over the fuel line that reduces emissions and increases gas
&gt; mileage. Is this a hoax or a scam???

Here's the stuff from the site about the product, with my comments:

Drawing of a box like apparatus around a fuel line with clusters 
broken up after device.
----- start their sales pitch stuff ----- as found on the 'net

Magnetic Fuel Saver
For Carbureted &amp; Fuel-injected Vehicles

Increase Fuel Economy an Average of 11.6% and
SAVE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR... for Only $19.95!

     You go farther on a tank of gas! 
     Dramatically reduces pollution (see chart below) 
     Keeps fuel injector nozzles clean and removes carbon and varnish 
     buildup your engine will have more power, run smoother, last 
     longer and require less maintenance.  Eliminates need for expensive 
     high-octane fuel and additives (unless recommended by manufacturer) 

The cost of this device is a very small price to pay for the money you'll 
save, the performance boost you'll enjoy and the good you'll be doing 
for the environment!

When gasoline remains in your tank for a while, the fuel molecules start 
to cluster. The molecules on the inside of these clusters can't be 
exposed to the oxygen necessary for combustion. The result: 
Incomplete fuel burn with the unburned molecules emitted as pollution 
or remaining inside your engine as damaging carbon/varnish deposits. 

----- start soap box mode -----
They never qualify what &quot;awhile&quot; means, 1 hour, three weeks, how 
much agitation is needed to keep this from happening (say like driving 
around?)

Clusters of what? Fuel molecules, as opposed to whatever else is in 
there?

Of course, no info on sample size, range of mileage improvements, etc
----- stop SBM ----

This compact device fits easily over the in-bound fuel line (straps 
included, no special tools required). It delivers an abrupt magnetic field 
designed to break up these fuel clusters, exposing all molecules to 
the oxygen and assuring the best fuel burn possible! Works on every 
vehicle, every time the EPA Accepted Laboratory Test and repeated 
demonstrations at authorized diagnostic/emissions inspection centers 
prove it.

EPA Accepted Laboratory Results for Fuel Saver

*HFET fuel economy per 40 CFR 660.113-88

&quot;After performing the HFET fuel economy per 40 CFR 600.113-88 EPA 
Accepted Test...we see a significant decrease in hydrocarbon, carbon 
monoxide and oxides of Nitrogen, and an 11.6% increase in fuel 
economy after installing the Fuel Saver on the test vehicle.&quot;

----- end of sales pitch -----

If you are interested, in doing something like this, save your self 
$20 and go get some magnets and duct tape them on your fuel line.
Report back to the list on your results.  From their description, use
the strongest you can find.  Can't hurt, other than the ridicule from 
others as they see stuff ductaped to your fuel line.

But, if it DOES improve anything then you'll have the last laugh.

$20 for a pair of magnets!? Free enterprise at work!  Get what you 
can before they catch on to you.  Then again if they tried to sell 
them for $3, nobody would think that they would do anything.  Just 
like art, the higher the price, the more likely the sale (to some 
extent anyway)
