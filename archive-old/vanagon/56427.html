&gt; ARI stands for Traffic Information System, every Radio station has it

&gt; ON/OFF.
&gt;

But not in all countries - the ARI system has been superceded 
throughout much of Europe at least - outside of Germany I find that 
it doesn't work much!

&gt; PCI Yes I Know the name, but the function ? I think its an tool that
&gt; scan the FM Band for good (powerfull) stations ????

Selecting the PCI button makes the radio look for a transmitted 
identity code from the radio stations and, if found, it displays the 
ident instead of the frequency.

To adjust the front/rear balance, try pushing the volume control in 
and turning it.  Similarly, pulling the volume control out should let 
you adjuct the left/right balance.
