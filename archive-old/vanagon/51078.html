Subject: Re: Syncro Westie pages


Tom, for some reason I don't get to the things like &quot;Fixing the Differential
Lock&quot; when I click there (using Netscape on a Sun Workstation). I get to
some mail archive, where the subject is &quot;Re: bass in a bus&quot;!

Any ideas?

As an aside, I went off perusing the &quot;Sermons of Bob Hoover&quot; under
&quot;Aerodynamics&quot; where he lists the .30 figure for COF of the original
bus.  I recall that the folks at VW/Porsche/Audi were more than a bit
miffed when their new darling, the Porsche 928, a perfect &quot;pumpkin seed&quot;
if ever there was one, had a HIGHER COF than the VW Bus (and higher than
the Cadillac El Dorado of the same vintage).  The Vanagon, despite being
a classic brick, is quite clean aerodynamically -- at the low speeds where
it drives.

Bob also mentions that adding wings and engine would make a bus fly.  This
is already being done, I think, in Ireland, and the resulting box-with-wings
is called a Shorts.  Gotta love those whacky Irishmen!  It is really too
bad that sexy looks and low-speed aerodynamics don't mesh so well, because
we end up with planes like the Shorts and Pilatus Porters (another truly
un-sexy plane) and cars like Volkswagen Vanagons.

hmmm, I wonder if Kennedy sells the adapter plate to put a 928 engine into
my Vanagon...
