Well, ah hate to be cynical and all.  And I understand that some
of us are tryin' to do the best we can with the given system.  Recycling
and holden on to our cars as long as possible.  But... the only real
way you can put any kind of dent in the dealers/salesman/goverment system
is to turn you back on them completely.

   [anyone who's not cynical is not paying attention!] Not buying a
   new car suggests that there is such a thing as &quot;enough&quot; -- my old
   bus is enough for me. says something, but I don't expect it to change
   the world (what it mostly does is piss off yuppies driving behind
   me -- tailgating will not make this vehicle move any faster)

That would mean giving up not
only your VW, but your TV/Cable connection (if you have it), your home,
your grocery stores, your CD player/collection, your PC and any other kind 
of consumer item you can think of.  So as long as you keep buying they've
got us all by the short and curlys.  It's only varying degrees of how much
your willing to give up and put up with.  

   There are lots of great tools and things to acquire, if you're
   acquisitive, but like watching television, picking and choosing
   just a few things rather than being a hog _at_ the trough makes
   life better.

I do the best I can, but it's tough, real tough.  

I apologize for the wet blanket.  Don't stop trying.

   A wet blanket could be a real handy thing in the event of
   an engine fire.
