&gt; Old ones are mostly on vanagons before 89
&gt; New ones all Eurovans and late Vanagons
&gt;

I have an 87, but it has the 'new' code scenario you speak of.  The
first time I had my battery disconnected, I asked the dealer what to do
to get the radio back on and he did NOT have access to any codes (keep
in mind that this is the same dealer that doesn't know which oil
pressure switch I need).  However, he said there was really only a few
codes used.  He 'guessed' and the first one he tried was right.  Some
security feature.  I seem to recall him saying that the first digit was
always 1.  Whoever had that friend with the quantum, if they can at
least deduce that they have the 'new' kind, it may only take some time
to go thru the various possibilities.  My code only has 1's and 0's if
that helps.
