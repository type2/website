&gt;&gt; &gt;A betty is a surfing term used to describe the non-surfing women 
&gt;&gt; &gt;who hung around the surfing crowd.  There was also the corresponding
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;barney,&quot; but nobody seems to use that...
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Ellis further clarifies:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Betty&quot; is an abreviation of a reference to a cult like following of Bettie
&gt;&gt; Page, the 1950's porno S&amp;M &quot;goddess.&quot; To anyone apparently born prior to
&gt;&gt; 1965, the current piercing of everything imaginable (and beyond!) and
&gt;&gt; leather collars, leather Brando &quot;Wildone&quot; motorcycle hats, chaps, vests,
&gt;&gt; handcuffs etc. as rather typical of the Sado-Masochistic or kinky leather
&gt;&gt; crowd. Now-a-days it's &quot;just the style, Dude!&quot; The Betty Page reference has
&gt;&gt; all but been lost. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;A &quot;Thrashing Betty&quot; is a chick (er ah, young lady) who
&gt;&gt; surfs/skates/snowboards and has moves/cuts with the best of them. A Thrasher
&gt;&gt; girl.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Thrashing Betty&quot; was what Mr. and Mrs. VanBondo called their Black '57
&gt;&gt; Oval prior to selling it. =((( It seemed appropriate if we didn't come to a
&gt;&gt; COMPLETE stop prior to shifting into first gear.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Gee! ...and all this time I though that Betty and Barnie were the
&gt;slightly odd, but not far off the beaten path, couple who lived next
&gt;door to Fred and Wilma....
&gt;
&gt;Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks (driven by Betties and Barnies?)...Oh, my!
