Subject: Kennedy developments

Just spoke with Kennedy to order my catalogue, and the lady who 
answered the phone said that they are working on a kit for the Subaru 
2.2 that will include wiring diagrams, banjo fittings, and an air 
intake duct which will make the whole thing fit in the proper space 
(a requirment for camper owners).  I will post the significant points 
when I receive my paperwork.
