Subject: Re: Testing Generator and Volt. Reg.

Rachel:
  I had to do this to my bus last month.  The gen. light came on while 
returning from a &quot;dawn patrol&quot; in Rhode Island.  Apparently my voltage
regulator (VR) went on the fritz.  I disconnected it and continued on home.
It took me awhile before getting the VR (I didn't know the exact one needed
as my '65 micro was retrofitted with a '73 1600 DP) By the time a got one and
the periodic connecting and disconnecting of the VR - I had to use the bus as
it is my daily driver, - I fried the generator.  If you cannot ascertain if the
generator is good/bad via Muir or other manuals, try this- disconnect the fan
belt such that the generator turns freely.  Then hook up the wire from the 
Polarize the generator as discribe in Muir- this should make the generator 
run like motor.  If it does this then the generator is good and the VR is 
most likely bad.  good luck.
