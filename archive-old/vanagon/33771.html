Went by this guys place today to look at an air compressor
he has for sale (5hp, 60 gallon, 220v, $300 delivered - sold!)

This is the guy with the Okrasa Motor.  He has such and unbelievable
pile of stuff!  A friend of mine (who bird dogs the &quot;for sale&quot; rags,
which is how he found this) got a NOS set of  bus bubbles and a
bunch of other goodies (25hp seamed fan shroud) for $100!  Yow!

He has a '64 single cab that he just sold to a guy, that is in really
good condition.  New motor, new trans, very, very nice gates,
double cargo doors (!) and only little splotches of rust in a couple
places.  Floors and bed are real clean, dash is nice, and still has 
the original floor mat and vinyl covering under the seats!  Straight
body.  Very easy project car.

He used to own a VW shop in Stockton, which incidently was where I
got some of my parts in the old days.  He _gave_ me a 6V radio,
(may or may not work) the rear piece of tin for my 36hp, and a 25hp
fan.

He has a shop chock full of new and used parts, including gas 
heaters, early convertible mirror visors, headlights, taillights,
yada yada yada.  Incredible!  My friend got all the good
bus stuff, but I'm sure there's more to be gotten.  I'm going
back in a week so, $$ in hand to shop!
