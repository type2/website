Subject: Oh no, the dreaded leak

hey now,

Opal helped me find a leak i never knew existed. somewhere on the front left
site..prolly the seal. i'm looking into replacing the seal but what can i do
until i can get the time and stuff and decent weather to do so....will
sillicone seal it well for a temp. fix? that's what i've heard. i was driving
down I40 and felt water hitting my leg. after all the rain stopped i noticed
that the carpet is wet and now i've got that great wet smell in the van. need
something to stop it until i can get the seal replaced. any ideas?

thanks,

jonathan
