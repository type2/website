Dan,

       First off, I far from being as kowledgeable as most on the list.
 However I think I might be able to give a possibility to your problem.  It
sounds to me like your temp sensor needs replaceing.  Your symptoms seem
right for this.  &lt;&lt;Appears problem only happens when engine is warm and
restarted.  Appears to be electrical (sudden death) and not fuel related (no
coughing, bucking,etc.)&gt;&gt;   It would happen that way because when the engine
is cold it would appear to the &quot;faulty&quot; temp sensor as being ok, but once the
engine warms up/gets hot the &quot;faulty&quot; temp sensor (thinking the car is over
heating) imeadiately shuts the car off.  From my understanding this is a
fairly minor problem in cost.  Others will be able to give you more details
(if this is in fact the case) or check the archives.  Had to put my 2 cents
in, been silent for too long :) .
