what if there is air elsewhere in the system?  Am I to assume that there

there's still no air in the radiator.

Actually, if I open the expansion tank ANY time, it does that.  I know
there is SOME air in the system, because I can see it bubbling slowly 
into the expansion tank.

&gt; I've parked it back end high for initial filling, then front high for
