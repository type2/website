 Hey,
 All right, one of you gurus explain to me what the gross vehicle weight
 rating (GVWR) found on the sticker in the doorjamb really means.  Is it
 the actual weight of the vehicle?  My '81 Westy has a GVWR of 5093 lbs.
 
 If this is not the actual weight, what is? 
  &gt;&gt;
The GVWR refers to the total wieght of the vehicle when fully loaded.  it is
the maximum the vehicle can wiegh.  The other numbers on the sticker refer to
the maximum wieght for each axle.  GCVW refers to the total wieght of the
vehicle plus a trailer.  Note that VW does not rate the van with this number.
 They must be telling us something!

Dennis
