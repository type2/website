Subject: Re: intermittant wipers?


Sean,

If the wiper switch in your Vanagon is anything like the ones in a Rabbit,
you will need to pull the steering wheel, and then remove the switch. You 
will notice a small black piece of plastic which prevents the wiper switch 
from moving into the intermittant position...this piece just pops out...

Again, this assumes that the switch is similar to a Rabbit switch. Also, in 
your relay panel you will see a simple piece of metal which is used to 
bridge two contacts where the relay goes. Remove the bridge.
