Hey everyone:
	I took the Mustang up to Carlsbad to go racing today, and promptly
got lost.  While I was wondering around the back streets, I noticed a large
number of VW vans sitting in a lot, and drove up to investigate.  Turns
out the place was a wrecking yard, but not the typical type that I usually
go to. 

The place is called Interstate VW, and apparently they are not a licensed
auto dismantler, but just a family of people who decided they wanted to
have a VW junkyard.  (??)  They were very friendly, and let me poke around
in their lot.  I'd say there were at least 30 busses there, mostly bay-window
but with several vanagons and a couple splits too.  They had a huge stack
of heat exchangers ($25-50 each) and of importance was a 72-74 bus style
drivers side heat exchanger that was almost new!  Still had grey paint on it.
I asked the owner about gas heaters, and he said, &quot;You know, people just
weren't interested in them, so I put them all in storage.  I have about 25
of them from all types of VW's (some type II's) and I want to sell them as
a lot.  On the other hand, I just sold one to a guy yesterday for $75.  How
much for the whole lot?  Well, I'd like to get $50 each or around there&quot;.
He also mentioned that he only wanted to sell the heaters as units (sorry 
Jack R.).

Now I don't suppose anyone here would be interested in buying the whole
lot of them, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  Anyway, I talked to the wife of
the owner, who was doing some paperwork at the desk, for awhile.  I tried
to find out if she had access to internet (she didn't) and I spent the next
fifteen minutes trying to convince her that she *needed* a computer and
a compuserve account so they could join the list!  :)

Anyway,  here is the information for this junkyard (from their business card):

Site Address:	1303 Engineer Street, Vista, Ca. 92083
Mailing Address: 770 Sycamore Ave. Ste J # 127  Vista, Ca. 92083

JIM LUCCA (owner guy, I guess)

Cheers,
