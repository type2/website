Subject: price of an '86 synchro?

Hi folks!

I am the happy owner of an 1986 GL Synchro, who unfortunately (:~() may
soon find it necessary to liquidate my only real asset &amp; travelling
companion. (It is still a tough choice, sell my Mac&amp;accessories or the
Van??) 

I have pretty good idea the value given in the used vehicle books (Edmunds,
etc.), but given the rarity of these vehicles &amp; love owners have for these
beasts, I am wondering what is a fair price for my synchro:

        1986 VW Vanagon GL Synchro
        General
        -134,700 miles
        -well maintained by VW mechanics
        -never in an accident
        Exterior
        -grey w/ silver+red 4x4 stripe at mid-body
        -still holds a polish (no sun fading)
        -minor rust (paint bubbling/flaking; no holes) on some body seams
        -one minor dink at left front headlight (I still don't know where that
         shopping cart came from)
        -three of 4 original hubcaps
        Interior
        -blue fabric seats throughout (great condition; the most
comfortable driving    
         position of any car I have owned)
        -blue carpet
        -air conditioning (it takes a while on really hot days, but it
works well)
        -new AM/FM cassette deck
        Mechanical
        -standard 2.1 engine &amp; manual 4sp+granny gear
        -regular oil change (every 3000 miles)
        -regular tune-up (~once a year)
        -no leaks (engine compartment is unbelievably clean)
        -does not burn oil
        -standard Vanagon intermitent overheating problem
        -plenty of wear left on 205-70r-14 tires
        -recent brake job

Thanks,
jso
