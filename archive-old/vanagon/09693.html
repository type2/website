Subject: Re: Front Floor Mats--WhereToBuy?

This was posted back in August:

&gt;Someone last week asked about floormats, so here's my contribution to 
&gt;the search:

&gt;Lloyd Design Group
&gt;8435 Telfair Ave.
&gt;Sun Valley, CA  91352
&gt;(818)768-6001

&gt;For the Vanagons they make a 1,2, or 3 piece floormat set (I hear the 
&gt;1 piece is the one to get) for the front.  Depending on whether you 
&gt;have the forward facing bench or the rear facing captains, there is a 
&gt;rear passenger floormat set that will fit.  Lastly, they also make a &gt;
mat to cover the rear cargo area.

&gt;Now for the bad news:  They (Lloyd) only sell to VW dealers, repair 
&gt;shops, and independent parts/service dealers, so you may have to
&gt;search around for these mats (or samples to look at).

I spoke to these folks, and they are the manufacturers of the mats sold 
at the dealerships. The good news is that they also sell the same mats 
to other folks so - you guessed it - you can buy them for much less.

Give 'em a call and they can tell you the nearest retailer to you.
