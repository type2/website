Subject: BITE ME....5 millionth Chrysler Minivan...MY A$$....


Ok, I'm a bit insenced over this &quot;most produced van&quot; crap....

I dug up some figures....as of March 8, 1990 (the 40th anniversary
of the first VW Transporter), there were 6.7 million Type2 built..
that's just the figures for the first 3 generations...

I just love the way Chrysler is using revisionist history...they
invented the minivan...SURE...they invented the &quot;sports shift&quot;...
gee what about VWs automatic stick shift...porsche's sportomatic
and tiptonic...

I wonder if Chrysler is using the Josef Goebbels Advertising Agency..
&quot;The bigger the lie, the more people will believe it!!&quot;...


Offendingly yours,

Ric
