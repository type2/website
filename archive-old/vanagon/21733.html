Subject: T-SHIRTS- Big fat correction - important

From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

 The little boy was so happy that everyone liked his idea, that he ran
off and told everyone about it. He was SOOOOOOO excited. Soon, he began to
think that perhaps he should start on the idea, and talk to the people
who would make those wonderful, happy shirts that everyone wanted. His
radio station always worked with a certain shop, who gave them a great
deal. He called, and began to discuss prices. Because these
super-special shirts had to be perfect, he wanted the best.
&amp;^%$&amp;*^(*(*&amp;(*&amp;
CRASH
oh my, those prices were a bit higher than he thought, as the price
breaks for 100 or so shirts are definately better than those for 25. 
-high-quality, natural colored shirts(37 or less) $8.50 each
-5 different color screens (each $15) - $75.00
-art preparation charge- $25.00
And these are all at &quot;preferred customer&quot; rates.
Anyway, much to my chagrin, I would say that $12.50 would be more like
the cost. So with tax, I must pathetically ask for $15.00, to cover
postage as well, and $20.00 for international orders. We *can* get
shirts for $10.00, but they would be boring plain white t-shirts with 2 or 3
colors (black outlines included). Since I want these to be the best, I
must red-facedly ask for this. I hope this is agreeable, and sincerely
apologize for the stupid confusion, caused by my excitedly jumping into
this project without doing a little checking first.
