Subject: more TIRE story

Sears called and told me my new tires were in . 
 They ordered the wrong ones  
they upped me a speed rating   not a sidewall rating 
WHY don't they understand      Dana Thomas does   but he's not there everyday

anyone who knows exactly what a '89 syncro should have for for tires 
LET ME KNOW 
I'm holding out for the best   a spare  and a 4 wheel alighnment 

there bending over backwards for me and I what to take full advantage  
Has any one followed my thread ?
                                                            MIKEY
