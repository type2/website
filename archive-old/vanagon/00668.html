This weekend I was preparing the Camper for a trip to Vancouver Island.
Couldn't get the LP gas refrigerator to start. Called Dometic's 800 number.
&quot;Keep pumping the air pump&quot;. After 500 or so pumps, still wouldn't start.
Called the local Dometic repairman. &quot;Did you just have your tank filled?
Well, they over-filled it. Do it every time. Bleed off some propane and
try it again&quot;. Did that, almost suffered frostbite. Called him again.
&quot;Bring it over. 2 hours labor just to get it out. Probably needs a new
ignitor. Or you can pull it yourself and bring in unit&quot;. Voice in
background:&quot;Do it yourself removal is *not* advised&quot;. While pondering the
hassle of driving crosstown and paying $$$ to the repairman, something
possessed me to apply compressed air to the refrigerator drain plug. I could
hear the tiny pop of igniting gas when I did this. Hum... wonder if the
refrigerator vent is blocked? Took off the vent fitting and looked in.
There was an arachnid condo in there. After clearing the webs out, the
refer started right up. The trip was saved and I didn't go broke at the
refrigeration shop. Seems that spiders love gas. I knew they liked to
colonize natural gas pipes, but they like LP as well.
