GruBe Vanagonian Collective,

I have a friend with a problem.  His '85 GL has the Hesitation Blues and I am
trying to help him out.  Problem is that I drive Diesel and haven't worked
that much with gas motors since I had a '70 Bug &quot;Bernie&quot;. 

Situation:
Starts right up dead cold and immediately starts hesitating.  Generally
hesitates and bucks under 3,000 RPMS.  Hesitation happens consistantly, not
randomly.  Sometimes Barbara stalls out completely but starts right back up. 
Doesn't buck at higher RPMS, but loses power up hills under load.

What we've done:
Run several tanks of high octane with Techron cleaner through.  This helped
alittle.  We've changed the air filter and fuel filter.  Helped alittle. 
&quot;Recent tune-up&quot; but I don't know what that means.  Assume that it wasn't a
top notch job!

I have Bentley and eargerly await any input the collective might offer!

Chris P.
