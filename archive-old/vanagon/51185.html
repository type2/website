Subject: Re: NEEDED: Reccomendations on FI Manual



&gt;if anyone can give me some reccommendations for a manual dealing with Fuel
&gt;Injection..specifically for FI in a VW '77 Westy i'd appreciate it. i'm
&gt;kinda at a lose trying to learn about the FI system.

Bentley makes such a manual.  I had a chance to look through it for the 
first time the other day, having just received a copy that I ordered for 
myself. Seems very complete, including sections on F.I. theory and basics 
of each system, troubleshooting flow-charts, service info, and even a 
section on high-performance mods. Covers all FI systems used by VW, plus 
other European makes. It is available from any Bentley dealer for somewhere 
between $30 and $35, I think.  (I sell it for $24.)
