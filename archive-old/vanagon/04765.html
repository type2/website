&gt; 
&gt; To normal people, a mature adult that willingly spends their hard earned
&gt; money on any Volkswagen Bus/Van (and then proceeds to force spouses,
&gt; children, dogs, etc. to ride in it), is far more foolish than any kid who
&gt; chooses use money he makes from his after school job to trick out his ride
&gt; in the style du jour.
&gt; 
&gt; This is especially true when you tell them just how MUCH money you just
&gt; spent on your Westphalia Syncro, how MUCH time you just spent repacking
&gt; your CV joints, how MUCH space you have to set aside in your rig for the
&gt; spare engine when you go on trips, etc.
&gt; 

	Good point.............scr
