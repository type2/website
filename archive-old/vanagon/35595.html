Subject: Re: Painting dilemma.....

Last Year I finished restoring a '74 Camper.  I did all the body work myself
and paid someone else to paint it.  I highly recommmend this course of
action.  To pay for them to do all the work would be several thousand
dollars.  If you have a welder or access to one and an air compressor, just
buy a book on body work.  You will wast a lot of time learning how to do
things but after which, it goes pretty quickly.  Furtheremore,  most body
shops will not spend the time to do as good a job as you will.  You can get
it sprayed for around $300 (one color).  Assuming you have all the equipment,
it will cost you around $100-$150 to paint it yourself.
