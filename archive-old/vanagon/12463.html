Subject: Re: Puddles inside the bus

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;LOL!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sorry, :-), but this describes my bus exactly.  Water runs in from around
&gt;&gt;the windshield, down the front of the bus behind the dash, and onto the
&gt;&gt;floor.  The floor is not rusted where it puddles (just a few pits), phew...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Age and the bus, in salty ol' New York... say no more...

How about the nose you were looking for? Rusted out or smashed? Or never
had one? Just trying to imagine how newyorker beast should look like.
