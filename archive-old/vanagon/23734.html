Subject: Prime &amp; Paint w/ a friend, John Cage

	Sorry, I'm corrected, the John Cage piece where you don't
play piano is &quot;4'33&quot;&quot;. In 3 movements according to a source I trust.
 
	Progress this weekend! Not only did I work on the pickup truck,
my sweetie Jean helped! :) We vaccuumed-up the sand-blasting sand my
neighbor had filled the engine compartment with, wiped-down the bare
areas with laquer thinner and sprayed Rustoleum Rusty Metal Primer 
from spray-can. I wore a good quality resirator mask while painting
and didn't smell any solvent until I took it off. I'm a convert to
masks- I still get exposed to fumes and liquids through my skin, but
I don't get a color match when blowing my nose anymore! Jean stayed
upwind and sprayed primer on the outside only, in a couple of small
areas. I need to buy a second respiratior for her.

	Bless her, Jean did the abrading of the star-burst cracked
Bondo that covered a minor dent at the right rear corner. Probably
a parking lot accident, and one that answers the question: What's 
wrong with Bondo? Well, as long as no further damage happens, and
provided its well mixed and applied and finished, nothing. But hit
the same pannel again, VERY lightly, and the $)(%)# pink junk cracks
all the heck and suddenly you've got a maintenance project.

	I bought one of those gray spongy looking synthetic wire wheel
replacements and she used it with a generic Sears 3/8&quot; reversing drill.
It cut the Bondo quick, didn't block-up, took off what rust
there was under, etc. So now I have a gentlely gouged margin all
around the actual dent.

	Neighbor Bill's oxy-acetylene welding of the replacement battery 
tray had burned the paint on the exterior skin in several places, so we 
abraded that paint and primer, etc, off. It was bubbled and slightly 
discolored, and we just removed all such with a little margin. Surprise, 
unharmed paint was harder to remove. None the less, the $6.85 synthetic 
wirebrush seems to do a good job, and I recomend it. This is the double-
thick one, and works well edge-on or side on as well. I believe it's
superior to cheap wirebrushes of the same size (6&quot;/150mm)

	The neighbor had sand-blasted the whole engine bay because some
DFO had applied black hammertone trunk paint to the compartment, making
a dark and mysterious place of what should be light and obvious! They
hadn't done any prep I don't think and I was going to flush the junk off
with grafitti remover, but Bill beat me to it. He also took some VW paint
off in places, and so I'm just spraying the whole thing with a fresh top
coat and primering where I see bare metal.

	We ran out of primer and had to get a second can, so top-coating
followed final priming the next day. I'm using Rustoleum Antique White,
which is not a bad match for Lotus White (eg Grey Beige). Its not the
actual color, but it gives the impression you tried :) Remember,
this truck is not a 75 point restoration, much less 100. Its a truck.
I even managed to miss a little of the sand and have some in the first
top-coat :(. Well, I'll hope to knock it out when I scuff the topcoat
for the second layer, and oh well, its a truck :)

	I sincerely hope this vehicle gets a complete bare-metal repaint
at some point, but until then I plan to do nothing that any future owner
will hate me for, while preserving as much as possible. Its also a way
of learning what's important and what's not. We'll see how it comes out.
My normal process is to go all out until I get overwhelmed, then give up.
I'm hoping to learn to do *just enough* this time, and take it to
completion.

	There was really bad rust damage on the sheet-metal ahead of (FIF)
the engine lid seal at the top by the hinges. You can see
through the sheet-metal in two places. I should have hit it with
rust converter but instead just entombed it in primer and paint. I
figure it'll wait a couple of years until I get a chance to get
to it. But here's a rust-out spot to add to the battery tray and
the bottom of the engine hatch when inspecting a vehicle for sale!
	
	I guess I'm going to add that one in the To-Do list when I
learn to weld- might be one of the places I start- with the hatch
off, access is pretty good :)

	The screws that hold the hinges to the hatch opening are
shot- I'll get a chance to try my left-handed drills and the new
Easy-outs soon!

	I'm going to apply brushable seam sealer to the gaps around
the new battery tray before the last top-coat, and do a little color-sanding
with 1000-1500 grit paper around the places we painted on the outside
when its all done. Oh yeah, and I could have done a MUCH better
job of cleaning the whole area before I started painting- oops!
Another lesson for next time. The top-coat just covers the primered
areas now, no overlap. I'll wash and then block-sand the edges between
new paint and old before shooting the final top coat.
'
	I've devoted all this bandwidth to this simple touch-up
in the hopes that my mistakes and experience may 1) inspire others
to do a better job 2) inspire me to do a better job 3) provide some
calibration for people like Thom who break their tails doing this
stuff and make Doing It Right seem relatively easy- it ain't! Even
doing a agricultural job take time and effort and patience!
