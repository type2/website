&gt; Has anyone tried changing the thermostat and fan switch to a lower temp

&gt; noisy beast, you may not want to do this, but it *should* run cooler, no?
&gt; You might also look into a product called &quot;Water Wetter&quot; from RedLine;
&gt; it won't magically keep your needle from moving, but if it does start to broil
&gt; in there, it really does hold the temp. down (I've seen it, on the wife's car).

I have to second the recommendation for Water Wetter.  It's well known and 
respected in the Mustang world.  A side note, my mom tells me her 94 Eurovan
Westfalia is overheating in traffic (in Germany).  She's gonna take it into the
dealer to try and have it diagnosed, but I was a little disappointed that such
a new vehicle would have a problem like that... I'll report on it if I learn
anything interesting.  She just got back from a 6-week camping trip in it, btw...
drove all the way to the arctic circle and beyond, with no trouble.  Some people
have all the fun, *jeez*!
