Subject:      Problem with vanagon digest

I own a Mac performa 578.  I have recently turned on the digest mode (which I
have never used before), because I have gone back to school and won't be
reading my mail quite as often as I used too.  Well everything seems to be
working fine, I mean, I get the condensed version with the file attached and
all that.  The problem begins after download the file.  When I try to open it
a blurb comes on the screen which reads, the documents or file, I can't
remember exactly, are to large to be opened by simpletext.  Does anyone know
what this means?  I miss reading the postings and as you can probably see I
don't have a lot of experience with computers.  Any help is greatly
appreciated.  Oh yeh, please respond to me directly seeing as how I can't
read what is happening on the list.  Thanks.
