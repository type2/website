I've never thought I'd care for a 4x4-type rig before but a Unimog!  YES!  I
want one!  That would be the ultimate all-purpose vehicle!  I would definitely
want mine with the camper option including the huge fuel tanks for extended
trips to Baja and who-knows-where!  Ooo!  Ooo!  8-)
Who cares if it costs as much as a house?  With the camper option you could
live in it too!  I wonder if the credit union would give me a mortgage on it
though?

On other topics:  my home email access has been renovated for the worse so I
haven't been able to respond to all the topics I've wanted to.  I've been
really enjoying this list lately, though.  I've been getting a lot of chuckles
out of postings like the Unimog one and Steve's response to my Short List of
Essentials.  Also, I propose that we adopt &quot;UrineVan&quot; as the list-approved
slang for the latest generation of bus.  Good one, Wizzer!  (All in favor say
&quot;Aye!&quot;)
