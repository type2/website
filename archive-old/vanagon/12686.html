&gt; &gt; 2 TV VW sightings:
&gt; 
&gt; Did anyone else notice the nice split-window bus in &quot;Ruthless People&quot;?
&gt; I almost cried when they drove it through a wooden fence...
&gt; 

I saw a stupid Chuck Norris 'rescue the hostages' flick and the only
reason I was paying attention was there was a vanagon in an airport
scene where they're planning to raid the plane to free the hostages
and it falls apart.  Another hilarious scene is where Chuck and another
guy end up in this Christian Priest's (they're in Lebanon) bread-loaf
VW bus with a big cross on it.  It ends up being a chase/shoot-em-up
scene which was totally unreal.  Bullets flying everywhere.  Chuck
would've been dead in the first strafe(sp?).  He's in back shootin 
out the back window being chased by jeeps and stuff.  I think the
bus would've rolled over at the first turn.  Oh, well, it was a 
movie.
