Subject: Add-on Oil Coolers


I'm waiting on a new GEX longblock to come in for my '76 Campmobile and 
have had (too much?) time to think about some other things I may want to 
do at this time.

One is add an extra oil cooler.

I do not like the ones I've seen mounted on the outside of the van, but 
something that would fit in the engine compartment (in corner across from 
battery?) would be OK.

Anyone running one of these?  How do you like it?
Anyone want to tell me why this might be a bad idea?
  I'm sure this is a frequent thread here....

I have never had overheating problems, but want to protect my new 
investment, and am considering a several month long trip to the west 
coast that would include time in the desert (NM,AZ).
