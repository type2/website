&gt; &gt; You should call 800-225-3323, or write to Grtaful Dead Merchantile Co.,
&gt; &gt; P.O. Box X, Navado, CA 94948.  They should have what you want.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Navado is actually Novato.
&gt; 
I any case, I just called them.  They were very nice and are whisking 
a catalog my way as I type this.  Well, in four to five weeks at 
least.  :(  It is what the stylish bus driver has in their glovebox 
this year.
