&gt;&gt; &gt;Any other ideas?  Anyone else with like experience?  It's not a normal

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.  Every time you're under the bus.  And have your next engine
&gt;&gt; properly balanced.  The engine/tranny interface is a prime nodal junction for
&gt;&gt; harmonics set up by an improperly balanced engine.  Often times folks buy a
&gt;&gt; long block, stick on their flywheel and go.  Massive imbalance.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;This brings a question to mind. Since my recent 
&gt;rebuild, my windows vibrate and it seems sometimes 
&gt;the entire bus vibrates. How do you &quot;balance&quot; an 
&gt;engine?
