Subject: Re: More cylinder numbering


Is it possible for you to wipe the message below out
of your memory? Hopefully you did nothing on last
weekend.

I took a reference on my manuals and there comes:

          ^
          I         driving direction
         ___
        I   I       gearbox
        I   I
     ___I   I___
    I 3       1 I   engine
    I           I
    I 4       2 I
    I___________I

Firing order is 1-4-3-2.

The Diesel engine cylinder counting is:

          ^
          I         driving direction
         ___
        I   I       gearbox
        I   I
     ___I   I
    I 4     I       engine
    I 3     I
    I 2     I
    I_1_____I

I'm sorry about this,

I was a little bit confused about that what was written
on the list, but now I remember:

My manual said that cylinder counting starts at the
left front cylinder, that the second column.
Where as in-line engines counting starts in the front.

The firing order, which is stamped on a sheet thin
in the engines compartment, is 3-2-1-4.

Do I check the manual and send you the references?
