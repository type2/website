&gt;Is it possible to make a parking brake on an 84 Vanagon do anything
&gt;besides take up floor space?

Then,  nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu (martha rubin) chimed in with:
&gt;Hey, Chris, I'm glad you brought this up.  I've had my repair
&gt;shop look at mine, adjust it, and insist it is ok, but it doesn't
&gt;hold/grip worth a darn.  Do these cables or whatever clamps
&gt;down on them lose their &quot;power&quot; somehow?

if you pull up slowly on the parking brake (from a fully DOWN position), and
you count the click-noises ... if it takes more than 3 or 4, you need (1)
the parking brake cables adjusted, or (2) new rear brake shoes.
now one really simple thing that everybody forgets to do is to adjust the
self-adjusting rear shoes. ;)  supposedly (i can't tell if it makes any
difference, if you want to know the truth!), you are supposed to put the car
in reverse, and back up at about 5-10 mph, then hit the brakes really hard.
do this about three times, and that's an &quot;adjustment&quot;.

like i said, i can't tell if it makes any difference. i've replaced the rear
shoes at 80,000 miles, even though they still had a lot of material left,
just so i could get more parking brake (and cause i was kinda paranoid about
six-year old brake shoes ... i mean, they ought to be wearing out, don't you
think??? :)
