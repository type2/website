&gt; OK,
&gt; 	I have a dilemma here.  I am contemplating the rebuild of my bus's
&gt; motor, or more correctly the rebuild of an engine that will replace the one 
&gt; in my bus - I want to ditch the 40-horse.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Maybe I've answered my own question, but does this sound like I should
&gt; stuff my P/C + heads on the rebuild short block and go that route?

I was under the impression that &quot;short blocks&quot; include pistons and cylinders.
You shouldn't have to use yours.
