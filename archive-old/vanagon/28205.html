Subject: What kind of bus do I have?

&gt;From: Bob &lt;zaphod_at_ATC.AMERITEL.NET&gt;
&gt;Subject: re:   What kind of bus do I have?

&gt;I think I got this off of the Gopher server at lenti, but I
&gt;don't remember for sure.  It should have everything you
&gt;need.  Of course, the plate behind the passenger seat in my
&gt;'67 Kombi doesn't jive with either of your plates nor does
&gt;it jive with this list but oh well...

&gt;Bob.

I have seen this Gopher site and it *is* very helpful to
most of the splittie group.  Your problem with the Kombi is
the same problem I have with 3 1967s.  VW changed the Model
Codes in 1966 when they went to the 9-digit chassis number.

I have been entering Old Bus Registry forms for NEATO and
have seen all sorts of model numbers show up for 1966 and
1967.  Most numerous are:

22-15 Microbus
23-42 Westy Camper
23-11 Kombi
24-12 Deluxe
24-13 Deluxe
26-16 Double Cab

I suspect that if you look at your ID tag you will see 2311
behind the seat and 23-11 on the air vent, though I have
found that the 66s may only have Type 23 on the vent ID.

Once I get through all of these forms, I hope to compile a
list to add to the list you forwarded.
