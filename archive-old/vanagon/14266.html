Subject: window cranks


On the Red Rock trip, I broke my driver's side window crank.  Went
to see about getting another today, and stopped in at the place
that did my rebuild.  They said they could order the one I needed,
but instead recommended an after-market heavy duty one (black),
which is all metal, except for the plastic round knob one grabs
onto.  Anyway, I installed it immediately (both actually, I though
I should buy two, so they would match, about $4_at_).  Anyway, I loke
them a LOT better than the stock originals, which seem rather flimsy
by comparison. 

If anyone is interested, I don't know if they do mail order, but
you could call them...
