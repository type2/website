I found all four drains. The rear two drain from a tube located behind the 
rear air intakes, at the top. A wire with a hook helped me pull the crud 
downward... there's really no way to reach the hole from above to push it 
out or pull it up.
Next, the forward drains exit through a round hole next to the forward jack 
pad. Again, go from the bottom with a hook. The hot soapy water thing might 
work well, too. Check this all out well, as the cavity of the curio area is 
capable of holding a few gallons on each side, and it will get 'cha if it 
doesn't drain out.
