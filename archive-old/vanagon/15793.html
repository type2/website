Subject: Re: Cheap places to camp

There is a book available for about $12 at places like Camping World,
called something &quot;Free Campgrounds.&quot;  Tobin/Dave Schwarze, can you help
me out on the title?  Anyway, it lists places to camp for free, like
acreage on Bureau of Land Management property, etc.  Don't expect
hot showers  :)

         water, laundry, or  dishwasher, but I'M WORKING ON IT, OK!?
