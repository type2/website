Subject: '87 Vanagon GL

We are in the process of evaluating a local 1987 Vanagon GL for sale.
Anyone have any suggestions as to what to look for (i.e., any &quot;known&quot; areas
of concern)?

This Vanagon has 55,000 miles, 4 spd, Wolfsburg edition, no (apparent) rust.
We just aren't sure what else to look for.
