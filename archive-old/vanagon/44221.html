Subject: Re: The Mystery Machine Lives..but costs


&gt;&gt;JC Whitney has Vgon rotors for $49.98 (early) or $52.98 (late) apiece,
&gt;&gt;or around $100/pair plus shipping. Not for Syncro, tho-- was yours
&gt;&gt;a Syncro or a 2WD Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;        It's a 2wd 83 Westie. Is JC Whiyney a US thing or is it Canada to?
&gt;I havent heard of them before, but then again I havent had a need for auto
&gt;stuff before : )


JC Whitney is a US mail-order auto parts place, really huge, that operates
out of Chicago. Their phone number is 312-431-6102. Call them, and they'll
probably send you a free catalog. Or, you can order the rotors right over
the phone with a credit card-- part no. 83NY0640T for your '83, $49.98 each
plus shipping.

In one hidden spot in the catalog, I noticed a little paragraph saying
&quot;Prices in US Dollars, may be higher in Canada, call for special shipping
rates to Canada&quot;, etc. Their shipping rates are already pretty high, even
to nearby US Customers, so I'd call if I were you. Their prices are usually
pretty good, though sometimes not the very lowest; but their exchange/refund
policy is excellent, if you don't mind waiting 3 weeks or more.

They have lots of bug parts, &quot;some&quot; van parts, and zillions of accessories
and a pretty good selection of ordinary tools. Quality ranges anywhere
from crappy to pretty good. I recommend their 300W 4-ch stereo amplifier,
even though when you get it it says 225W. It'll still shake your windows
if that's what you want, and can be heard over even the noisiest VW engine.
And their 4x8 folding trailer kit is excellent, at a very good price.

Hope this helps.
