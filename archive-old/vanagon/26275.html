Subject: CV Joints?

Howdy All:

Finally I am in San Francisco and settled. The Bus made it out across the v=
ast plains, mountains, etc. without a hitch. However, (there's always a how=
ever) there is a LOUD clicking from the left rear wheel. The clicking is ON=
LY when the car is in gear (no sound when coasting).

I will assume the worst and ask CV Joints?  Also, can anyone recommend a re=
laible Vanagon shop in San Francisco or the BAy Area.

Thanks

Matt
