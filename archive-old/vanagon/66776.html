Subject:      Re: 4X4 Eurovan??

&gt; Were there any?  Are there any?  Is it possible to get one in the USA?
&gt;
They were available in Europe, probably still are.  As of now, *NO* Eurovans
(the US anme for the T4 Transporters) are available in the US except those
impoerted by Winnebago for conversions.  The Syncro T4's are more like
a 4x4 Dodge Caravan -- not something you'd want to take off-road.

&gt; Also, what is the history of the Tri-Star Crew-Cab pickups?  Are they
&gt; available in the USA?

I know of two, but neither are available -- no pickup versions have been
offered of the Transporter line in the US since 1972 or so.  This includes
Kombis, Panels and Pickups (although there are many newer Kombis about)

&gt; Canada?

Yes.  18 TriStars were imported to Canada, I'm been told, one was destroyed
during shipment.

&gt; What are they worth lately?

Whatever the market will bear.  They are not well-known, and are now getting
old.  I'd say that you'd expect to pay about $25-$35k for a real nice one.
Even in Europe, these go in the $15k(US$) range.

&gt; Is Tri-Star
&gt; just a model name? or a converter like Westfalia?  Or a coachbuilder like
&gt; Karmann?
&gt;
&gt; David Ulicki
&gt;

Just a model name for the four-door Doublecab.  Most were Syncros as well,
most had many options (since the TriStar package itself was *way* too
expensive, I hear.

On that note, let me ask a question of our Canadian listees:  Does anybody
know what a regular Doublecab Syncro would have sold for new in 1986?  How
much more were the TriStars?
