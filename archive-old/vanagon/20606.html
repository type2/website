Well, everyone know what FORD stands for.  :)  

And now for a little VW content (and American car bashing)... 
This weekend I saw a couple shiny new Amurkin mini-vans come throught 
where I work (I collect park fees) that had broken windows.  These where 
really new looking vehicles, so I pointed to my old beat up '66 and said 
cheerfully, &quot;Hmm... my windows work fine.&quot;  Of course they only slide, 
but hey, they work almost like new after 30 years in service.
