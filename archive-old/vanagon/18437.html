Subject:       Re: urgent propane fill question!

On our '90 Westy, the procedure is as follows:

1.  attatch propane nozzle to tank
2. open spit valve... this is located near the top of the tank and 
has a knurled nut on it.  You can usually undo it with your fingers.
3. squeeze trigger on propane nozzle to fill tank.  
4. When white cloud appears at spit valve, the propane nozzle will 
kick off.  Immediately close the knurled nut.  This will be VERY 
COLD, so using heavy rubber type gloves is a must.
5. Tank is filled to 80%.  Maximum capacity is 12 litres.

On my Westy.. which has the standard Manchester tank, has two safety 
overfill valves.  The inlet valve where the propane hose gets 
attached will kick off, and the spit valve is the second indicator 
which will visibly indicate that it is 80% full.  One should NOT 
overfill beyond this.  I usually fill in the cool of the day.

I usually fill my tank every 10-15 days of camping, and put in about 
7 litres at a time (~half full).  I believe it is safer to have a 
full tank.. less vapour.  The fridge is our primary consumer, as we 
don't use the stove burners that much... unless it is raining :(

ALWAYS make sure that the propane valve is OFF.  In Canada, you are 
not allowed to fill the propane yourself... the station attendent is 
responsible for filling.  The proper nozzle attatchment fits above 
the bottom guard without any problems.  If it doesn't, the station 
must change his adapter.  I've never run into filling problems in 5 
years, and have filled up across Canada.

Hope this helps.
Harry.
