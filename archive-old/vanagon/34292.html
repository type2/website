Harrah's Auto Collection in Reno had a one-only built car named the Julian,
built in 1925, that had a horizontally mounted mid-engine 5 cylinder radial
air-cooled engine.  If I'm not mistaken, The crank was bolted to the frame
and the engine rotated, as in the early aircraft.  The Julian was also the
first car with &quot;air shocks&quot;.

&gt; behemoths.  Hmmmm...
&gt; Who needs a Corvair when you could have an unmuffled Conti...  (cooling
&gt; might be a bit of a problem without that BIG fan :-).  And with the right
&gt; carburetor you wouldn't have to worry about running while inverted ;-) !

Franklins (american pre-WWII cars) had air-cooled straight sixes and eights
(I believe).  Company was in production for quite a while (don't know the
earliest dates, but at least during the 20s), so must have been able to
work out the cooling pretty well.  A friend's dad had a 6-cyl roadster.
Moderate-size car for the time.
