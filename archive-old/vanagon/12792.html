Subject: Those pesky exhaust valves
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 95 17:50:58 PST

 Chris Bridge asked about the appetite my '64 had for the number three 
 exhaust valve and dared &lt;!, chuckle&gt; to suggest that perhaps the valves  were 
 not adjusted often enough &lt;probably true, btw&gt;.

 In my opinion, the valve consumption of that motor &lt;a 1500&gt; had more to do
 with how it was driven than how it was cared for. That poor thing spent most
 of it's life at full throttle. I like to drive at 60-65 mph on the interstate
 and while that's all in a days work for a type IV engine bus, it pushes the 
 upright engine near it's peak output for sustained periods of time. Also, for
 much of the time I had the '64, I lived in the Santa Cruz mountains and my
 daily commute included a 1500 ft. elevation change, mostly at full throttle 
 considering the output of that engine. I think that an upright fan engine 
 can accumulate many, many more miles than I did provided it is treated
 reasonably and cruised at 55-60 mph on road trips.

 One last thought, and this is really just a hunch: I think that to get long
 life out of any of the air-cooled engines, it is really important to keep them
 in tune, especially the timing. I do check my valve clearances a couple times
 a year, but they are seldom out of spec. The point gap and timing seems to
 me to be more variable and I check that more often. I haven't bought one
 myself, but those electronic ignition conversions might be a good investment
 in engine life simply because they help keep the timing spot on for long
 periods of time.


 I would also like to add that I think this list is made up of really wonderful
 people. I have been lurking on the Land Rover list recently and was really
 disappointed to find that many of them are quite mean-spirited and there is 
 way too much of this &quot;my vehicle is better than yours&quot; kinda stuff. The 
 atmosphere on this list is much more positive, helpful and pleasant and the
 collective sense of humor is *much* better too!


 Best Regards,

 Dave
