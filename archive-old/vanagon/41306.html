Subject: Re: bike racks

The Thule rack with the high mount bracket is the way to go . We can carry 2
mountain bikes and 2 kayaks with no problems at all, though toll booth gates
can be a little tricky. Performance bike catalog can get you what ever you
want or need, and if they don't have it in stock they will have Thule ship it
direct. They also will beat any price without hassle.Their phone # is 800 727

       Hope this helps
