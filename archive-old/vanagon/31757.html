&gt; To All:
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to replace the coolant hoses on my 1965 bus before making the run
&gt; to Big Sur this weekend.  
&gt; 
&gt; Left Hose: 89 cents

Doh!!
&gt; 
&gt; Right Hose: 89 cents

DOH!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Total:  $1.88

DOH!!!!
 

&gt; Had I purchased the hoses from Volkswagen, they would have cost a total of $3
&gt; !

Oh Shut up!  ;)
