Subject:  wasserboxer head gasket procedure?

i found reference to the 'HeadGasket Procedure'  in the archives, but
couldn't find it.  anyone have a copy?  a good friend's 84 westy is getting
air in the cooling system (again - the first time was a cracked reservoir) -
any info/advice would be appreciated.

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
