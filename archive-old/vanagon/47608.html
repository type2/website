Subject: FS: crew cab gates

If anyone is working on a crew cab resto project out there, I have gates
that fit '68 and up crew cabs.  An honest assessment of their condition:
driver's side gate is real rough (lower portion is gate is rusted through on
outer skin but the hinges are still there); passenger side gate is pretty
good (some rust but mostly surface rust--nothing rusted through); tailgate
is also pretty good (not rusted through).  All gates have the necessary
hinges and hardware.

Lemme know if you're interested in them.

Bob
