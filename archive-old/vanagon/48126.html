hey now,

i've gotten into a new habit yesterday. our yard is producing oodles of
beautiful flowers. we cut and cut and cut some more but always have soooo
many. know what i do now? i always carry a fresh bunch with me and put them
on vw buses when i seem them parked in the Triangle area of North Carolina.
i've gotten Richard Palmer's old bus twice in two days! muahahahahahahah
so if you are in nc and see a beautiful flower under the left hand wiper on
your windowshield, you know i've been there!

i even put them on wasserboxes. seeing as flowers like water more then air! :-)
