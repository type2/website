Subject: Brakes for '67 - Where to buy parts?

Hello all!

I'm seeking brake parts for my '67 Westy and am wondering who would be the
best to mail order them from.  I've ordered stuff from the Bus Stop before
and have had good luck.  However, I've compared their prices against JCW's
prices and they're like twice as expensive.  So, is RMMW gouging the
consumers or does JCW sell crappy brake parts?  I need wheel cylinders,
shoes (maybe more, I haven't dismantled the bus yet), and a new brake hose.

Any input is appreciated as always.

Bob J.
