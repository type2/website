Subject: Re: Journeys under difficult conditions

Jim and Listees,

I would like very much to add skidplates to my Vanagon.  Though it
already has the stock Syncro skid rails, I'm nervous about the propane
tank, the front diff and rear engine/transaxle castings exposed through
the stock skid rails, and the exhaust system.  All it takes is some bad
luck with ONE ROCK 20 miles out into the desert, and you're in big
trouble.  

How do I get a copy of the &quot;Journeys Under Difficult Conditions&quot; plans? 
Has anyone out there used them?  Thanks for your help.

&gt; in adding skid plates to their bus.  If you would be interested, please
&gt; drop me a note.  Don't have a price yet.  Still need to do a little more
&gt; research.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I have nothing for syncros.  :(  Guess with AWD one doesn't need
&gt; skid plates.
