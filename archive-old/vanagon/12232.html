Boy do I have the set-up for you!

I have a 13 gallon vessel with a bottom spigot, fits ontop of a huge 
propane burner (heats 10 gallons of water to boiling in about 15 
minutes) AND I have a nice 12v water pump with good volume for that 
luxurious shower.  

Trouble is all this is in Northern Minnesota   :(

Is it the thought that counted?
