So Derek Drew says:
&gt; I was able to knock one of my labels off but I can't get the other label to
&gt; come off yet. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you think you can remove your label, by all means DO IT. I used a chisel
&gt; and a sledge hammer and a lot of bending back and forth once it started to
&gt; come off.

Oh yeah, I can just see myself now.  Tap-tap-tap-tBOOOOOOOOOM!!!!  ;)
