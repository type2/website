&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; A few months ago I reported that the transmission in my '81 ( &gt; 200K
&gt; miles) was starting to whine in 1st and 2nd.
&gt;
&gt; Guess what....  It hasn't gotten any better, and 3rd is starting to whine
&gt; too!
&gt;
&gt; So at some point I'm going to have to bite the bullet and fix this.  Can
&gt; anyone recommend a transmission rebuilder in the SF Bay Area (or Northern
&gt; California in general) or other reputable source for a replacement trans?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I have a transmission I took out of a wreak that I could put in, but
&gt; I'm not sure of its condition.  I assume there's no reliable way to tell
&gt; if it's OK short of installing it in the car and driving around?

I have had great luck with German transaxle of America in Bend, OR. They
reman and ship trannies all over the US.

I'll get their phone on monday if you would like.
