Subject:       Re: '48 Bug

&gt; Any split window bug experts out there?  I've found the mortal remains of a
&gt; '48  and it *may* have some good body panels.  If any one knows about
&gt; splits could you email me off the list?

That brings up an intersting point.  I was browsing though the 
newspaper, and on occasion they run a little column called &quot;Misc. 
Facts&quot; or something to that tune which comes from the Associated 
Press.  This weeks had something of interest to me.  

Paraphrased it said:

In 1949 Volkswagen imported its first cars to the united states.  
That year they sold two cars.

Wow I thought, how would it be to have one of those?  I assume they 
were bugs!  So I would assume either they are wrong or else anything 
49 and back are probably German sold models shipped over here.
