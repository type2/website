Need some help...

    I've lost one of my wheel covers.  It has 9 aluminum-like fake
    &quot;spokes&quot; = as well as fake lug nuts(black in color) surrounding
    the center of the = wheel cover.  There is a graphic in the
    center of the cover that looks = like the Arc de Triumph or a
    castle (use your imagination here).  I = thought these were
    aftermarket, but I've seen them on other 80-81 = Westies.  Noone
    seems to know where to order them.

Sounds like those are stock hubcaps, and the castle is the 
Wolfsburg castle also found somewhere on most VWs. A good  autowrecker 
should have them.
