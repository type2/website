Subject: '56 kombi update - motor is in

Woohoo!

	Ok, got the new motor in!

	Had some fun though.  Ended up getting a new fan ($23) for the
doghouse cooler setup.  The doghouse fan is 1/4&quot; wider than normal, so
that should flow better air += better cooling.  Also had to make a
run to the junkyard to get the front tin pieces that go beneath the
cylinder tin, and thied to find the ones for the back, butonly found one.
Also bought a new crank pulley ($27) because I roached mine up pretty good
trying to get it off without a puller.  I prolly shoula spent the cash
and bought a puller.  Oh well.  I got the stock, cadmium plated pulley,
not the funky aluminum one.

	It took a lot longer than we thought to get everything switched over,
and we ended up doing some things twice, because I was adding things I 
didn't have before, so we didn't know the order of operations.

	Finally, about 7:00pm or so, we were ready to fire it up (after cranking 
for a minute to get the oild (10/40) sloshed around.  Fired right up!
We let it idle for a while, and then took it for a spin.  Its a totally
different bus!

	Here is where it gets funny!

	Pulling back into my driveway, wher I park the bus on this strip
of grass next to the driveway proper, Ray sez &quot;Thats looks a little soft&quot;
&quot;Naw&quot; sez I, &quot;I park it here all the time!&quot;  Well, sure enough, I got 
stuck in the mud in my own front yard!  It was a hilarious scene, I'm sure,
with us trying to get the bus out.  Finally, we said to hell with it and got
Rays bus and a rope, and he puller me out.  It was reall funny with the 
angles everything was going at, like a bus ballet.  He couldn't pull me 
straight out, so he puller the front end from the side, which made kind of 
a ditch witht he front wheels.  I have really torn that strip up - time
to put in concrete I guess!

	So, I have to park on the street again, which makes me kind of nervous,
so we'll see what happens...

	I didn't get any of the welding I wanted to get done :(

	The engine ended up costing $800, not including the extra gasket
kit ($8) fan ($23) pulley ($27) oil cooler, intake mfl and tin ($65)
clutch ($100) and a bunch of miscllaneous stuff, prob'bly about $50
or so.  I have a solid grand into this engine conversion, easily.

	On a side note, my old engine was DIRTY!  All kinds of dirt inside,
like when we pulled the gen stand and fuel pump - just loads of this thick
gooey mess.  Its like it sucked in a lot of dirt somehow, and it mixe with
the oil.  Absolutely disgusting!

	Next will be the new transmission.

	If anyone wants info on the doghouse conversion, mail me.  I think
its a worthwhile job!

Thom
