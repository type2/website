&gt;SSVC archives tell me that on post 64 vans the first two digits are indeed
&gt;model nr (22 = Microbus) and the third digit is the year..but it cant be 1961!
&gt;The next six digits refer to the actual number built (sequential production)

And then he asked about the plate behind right seat. As per the original post : 

0 - 5: (somehow, the build date?) 

426: (unknown to me, possibly bench front seat belts) 
025: lap belt anchors 
114: 6 pop-out windows 

UN 2213 421781 1308189: Station Wagon (eight or nine seater, 
with the full width front seat), left hand drive, Blue White over
Turquoise, Como green interior. 

So, 130189 confirms the vent box's 22-1308189.

I could have misread 7308189 as 1308189 twice, once on the vent box and then behind the 
seat, but unlikely. Further, it has two non-67 items: the square key gas lid and the 
Turquoise color. So I discount this possibility.

Go figure!
