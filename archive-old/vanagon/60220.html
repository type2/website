&gt; &gt;how to reset this light?
&gt; &gt;some past list discussion said to look for switch behind speedo, but i'm
&gt; &gt;not finding it.
&gt; 
&gt; there's a little black box, in the speedo cable ...it's about bumper
&gt; level, just to the left of the spare tire. follow the speedo cable up
&gt; from the left front wheel. you should be able to get to it without
&gt; lowering the spare tire.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, on this box, there is a button, hidden down inside a &quot;tube&quot; or
&gt; shield. push that button (with a screwdriver or pen or something) until
&gt; it &quot;clicks&quot;. you should hear/feel it click, but it might not be a very
&gt; loud noise/feel. that should reset the gizmo and the light will turn off.
&gt; you MIGHT have to click it two or three times to get it reset.
&gt; 
&gt; good luck.

It's a whole lot easier to disconnect the light bulb.  :o)
