The answer to the mystery question is that if you raise tthe left wheel
about 10&quot; off the ground, then you can safely slide the vanagon diesel
engine out on cardboard -- with enough lifting to be careful of the pan.

Leave more room if you have the engine on wheels of some sort.
yay!!!! It's out!
