Advertisement from Thomspson VW in Waterville, ME:

&quot;September Sale; everything must go!  Includes...Eurovan (one left).&quot;

This one is the demo with about 4500 miles on it.  The only thing I know
that many may not  like is that the driver smoked a lot.  Heck, they always
have sprays to kill the odor!
