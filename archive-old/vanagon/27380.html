Subject: Re: 1980 Vanagon

Oops, oh yeah, read the &quot;Subject&quot; title Ellis. *1980*

&gt;&gt;In defence of &quot;Capt'n&quot; Kirk, an aquaintence of mine recently purchased an
early/mid eighties Vanagon that was converted from water to air following
the demise of the waterboxer motor. It runs great but will interesting if he
ever has to take it somewhere for repairs that are beyond his capablitites
and forgets to mention the change. It would be fun to be a fly on the wall
in that situation.

&gt;&gt;Jim Kirk wondered (tm) about the radiator looking thing in his aircooled
Vanagon.
