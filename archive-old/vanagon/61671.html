I was having the same problem on my '84.  Some on the list suggested
adjusting the wiper arm in the air box in respect to the air damper. It
made a great improvement on mine but I haven't adjusted it with a CO2
meter yet so it's not perfect. If you need details, it was refered to as
&quot;vanagon syndrome&quot;.  If you can't find it anywhere mail for details.
