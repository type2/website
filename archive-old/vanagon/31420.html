So Tom Forhan says:
&gt;      last winter there was a big thread among Westie owners about putting
&gt;      an inverted clay flower pot over the burners of the propane
&gt;      stove, getting the pot to radiate some heat.
&gt; 
&gt;      But I could not find any final report. Did anyone try this?
&gt;      I know I can buy a protable catalytic heater, etc, but I am
&gt;      wondering about a improvising something to use the Syncro
&gt;      Westie as a warming hut while cross-country skiing.

Well, David Schwarze uses this method and if you try to read his posts,
it becomes *real* evident what the effects are. ;)  

Seriously, from previous threads about this, as long as you keep a 
window cracked open while doing this setup, you should be okay.
