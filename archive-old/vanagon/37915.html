Volks,
	I got a lot of requests for information on the Beer of the month
club, so I'm going to post it in hopes that people will be inspired.

A quick search of the web turned up the following URLs:

http://www.tdmdesign_dot_com/hops/club.htm
http://jan.ucc.nau_dot_edu/~twb2/beer.html
http://florida_dot_com/beer/
http://maltbev.cohesive_dot_com/MOTE/

Finally I found one site that has compiled a list of all of the
different beer-of-the-month clubs - yay!  Check out:

http://realbeer_dot_com/celebrator/9412/BOMClubs94.html

We may have to take up a collection cause it's a little more expensive
than I thought - near $20/month.  I'd even be willing to handle
collecting the money - I could post a list of contributors on my web
page... yes, this could work!!!

So how many listmembers out there would like to buy Gerry a cold one?
If I get enough volunteers, I'll make it happen.  Please reply
privately.

-David
