&gt; Boushwa!   
&gt; 
&gt; A problem like this should be amicably settled between parties without resorting
&gt; to Liars.  Go make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue on your own.  If you're 
&gt; unhappy without the results OR the shop hasn't lived up to it's end of the bargain,
&gt; THEN get yourself an attorney.  Or just ask yours to write a letter.  You'd be amazed
&gt; at the results you can get with just a letter.  Lots cheaper too.

I would recommend that you contact the Dept. of Consumer Affairs,
Automotive division and check your rights in this matter...

Be advised that the shop only has the responsibility to perform in
good faith. I do not believe that a mechanic can be sued for
malpractice. The Consumer Affairs people can bring you up to speed
on any explicit guarantees provided by the state..

Also be advised that in many cases there is nothing that can be done
unless fraud was involved. This must be tempered with the implied
covenant of 'good faith and far dealing' associated with any
contract...and yes...you had a contract with these people..
