Subject: VW Camper Van wanted in CA...

Hello,

I am new to this list and I hope that my question is not inappropriate. :-)

I went camping last summer with some friends who have a VW Camper Van '91.  I
was so impressed that I wanted to buy a new van.  After months of waiting to
test drive the new model, I discovered that the insides were made by
Winnebago.  I was not impressed.

I then had the opportunity to drive a new Eurovan in Canada.  It was
perfect!!  After 3 months of discussions with US Customs and the EPA, I have
been convinced that I can't import one from Canada into the US.  (Has anyone
had any success with this?)

So, it looks like the best option at this point is to buy a used van.

I would welcome any suggestions about used vans available in the US.  What is
the best year of the more recent models?  Anything that one should look out
for?  What is the best way to find VW Campers for sale?

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.  :-)
