&gt; the time it is scheduled, as we either can't take off that much

Geez Martha, I've volunteered my place as a stop-over point, I was hoping
that some of the &quot;hip crowd&quot; from the bay area (or San Fran, I know how
much you hate that name :)), would be able to attend. Clams, crab and
home-made cider?
