Subject: Help! Broken Accel Cable

A friend of mine called me last night to ask me about his accelerator 
cable.  Of course they never break in the driveway on a sunny day.  Last 
night here in Austin it happened to be cold and drizzly.  Anyway, I 
explained to him how to replace it but we have a question.  His van is a 
'73 but he has a beetle engine instead of the type IV.  Should he buy a 
cable for a '73 or will a cable from an earlier year work better?

                                  Thanks in Advance,

                                           Martin.
