Subject: Heat smells rubbery

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas about this. It's finally
gotten cold enough to use the heat in our van for the first time
since installing new heat exchangers and control boxes. We're
getting lots of heat. That's the good part. The bad part is that
there is a strange rubber smell when the heat is on. Anyone have
any thoughts on what is causing this? All the heat channels and
hoses are sound, so it isn't exhaust causing the odor. Thanks.

Lisa
