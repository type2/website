Subject: Syncros

Having a 76, I don't usually read the posts with &quot;Syncros&quot; in the subject.
But occaisionally I read a post about scyncros that doesn't say it in the
header and stuff.

Reading some of the posts, I get the idea the people go mudslinging in the
syncros.  Is a syncros a real 4X4 kind of vehicle, like the toyata 4wd pu I
had?  I thought it was 4wd in the same sense as my dad's subaru legacy is a
4wd, i.e. better on road traction, no jumping logs and boulders.

Just curious,
Eric &amp; Maggie.
