Dave,

I'm the 2nd owner of my 87 GL Wolfsburg w/alloys, but I have the
original sticker.  I do have 5, not 4, but the sticker doesn't indicate
whether you should have received 4 or 5.  The alloy wheel 'extra' was
$420, which included bumping the tires up to 205/70s instead of
185/80s.  Although I suppose I could be misinterpretting that.  The
Wolfsburg was suppose to come with &quot;Color Keyed Wheel Covers&quot;.  I
suppose that the PO could have acquired the 5th one, but who knows. 
What does your spare look like?  Like the standard wheel or something
someone just stuck there?

A note about gas mileages, according to the window sticker, the 87
Vanagons with auto. were suppose to get 14 mpg city, 16 mpg highway
according to the epa.  I've gotten fairly consistently above that except
when something was broken.
