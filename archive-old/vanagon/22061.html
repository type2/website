&gt; Not to detract from David's accout of overcoming a broken accelerator cable,
&gt; but there are a couple of tricks that can get you home, or at least off the
&gt; freeway should your cable break.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you advance the idle adjustment screw to about 1,500 rpm you can make
&gt; about 30 mph.  You gotta eat a little clutch to do it, but it will get you
&gt; off the freeway.

Or the even more desparate approach: sticking a big screwdriver in the 
throttle body (or lever) and &quot;simulating&quot; a 1,500 - 2,000 rpm throttle.  
Not at all elegant, very bad form, but will do the trick if the cable 
breaks leaving the vehicle in a dangerous position.  Don't ask me how I 
came to try this one out.

[the bailing wire throttle cable]
&gt; The trick?  A bungee cord.  And grease.  Two wraps around the fuel pump then
&gt; wire the bungee cord to the throttle arm.  Grease the dickens outa that
&gt; sucker before you push it into the tunnel.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem?  Your foot's going to get awfully tired fighting that bungee
&gt; cord.  And it ain't doing the carb much good, either.

Bungee cords are also good for getting you home (or probably a few 
thousand miles if you have to push it and it damn cold outside) if your 
cable is getting sticky because of fraying, rust, or some other 
yet-to-be-identified reason.  In this situation, it's easiest to attached 
the bungee at the accelerator pedal, with the other end pulling it up 
towards the dashboard.  There are lots of good places to hook it to under 
there.
