Do you know why they want to sell the turbo diesels in Canada?
VW cannot sell them any more in Germany, the tax on this engine
will rise over DM 1,200.00 a year, compared to a tax of about
DM 700.00 a year for a TDI. But two of my friends driving the
TD EV, great engine but a little bit noisy because the engine
is in the front. What kind of engine will be sold in US?
