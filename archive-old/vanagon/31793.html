Subject: Re: List Stickers, shall I make them? 

Hey Rich,  I'd definately sport the stickers on all of my vehicles, shoot I
might even put one on my dogs rear window (just kidding), really--I think
its a great idea. I was a little late on the netvergnugen t-shirts a few
months ago.

&gt;Howdy all,
&gt;Hope everyone had a pleasant Holiday vacation. Over mine, I did some
&gt;checking up on making up list stickers. My main concern is that I would
&gt;have to order 500 (yes, five hundred) stickers as a minimum, to get the
&gt;best price possible. So, basically, I just want to make sure I can sell
&gt;enough to cover myself. Though I won't describe the design (just a tad
&gt;paranoid), I do believe they will be pretty nifty. One of the big points
&gt;of these stickers, I think, is to place them in a standard spot, on the
&gt;rear left corner/window, to be able to instantly identify fellow
&gt;members. So, they will stand out, but NOT in a tacky fashion. They are
&gt;very tasteful, and simple, yet elegant, and with lotsa symbolism present
&gt;in the design. :)
&gt;  Bottom lines are these-
&gt; Cost would be $5.00 for 3, $10.00 for 7, and generally $2.00 each. BUT,
&gt;I don't really want to sell singles, as $2.00 checks are kinda silly. 
&gt;Sending cash would probably be most convenient, but there can be many
&gt;problems with that, so that's kind of risky.
&gt;  Shipping would be easy, however, as I would probably ask everyone for
&gt;a self-addressed, STAMPED envelope. one stamp should be good for up to
&gt;10 stickers, and 2 stamps certainly for 10 more. 
&gt;
&gt;So, then, should I take the plunge? If everyone out there got some, then
&gt;there would definately be plenty of demand. Please let me know, since if
&gt;I can do it without going to the poorhouse, I'd really like to.
