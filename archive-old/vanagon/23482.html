Subject: Fuel Filler Hose
Date: Thu, 24 Aug 1995 22:34:07 -0600 (MDT)

Okay, so I got the fuel tank cover off and replaced the hose on my '73. 
It was a pain, but it had to be done. One problem. As some of you know, 
you can't get a new fuel filler hose. (Unless someone knows of a source 
-- I couldn't find any), and so the best second choice is to find a place 
that has fuel filler hose and buy two feet (at $15 _at_ foot) and then cut 
off about 7&quot; or so. 
    The problem is that the original is L-shaped, and when you bend a 
piece of straight hose, it kinks. Kink your garden hose once and see how 
much flow you get. So I took the biggest spring I could find, and rigged 
it with another piece of stiff wire down at the end that had to be kinked 
on the inside so the hose couldn't close off all the way. 
    This worked, sorta'. Now when I fill up, the pump nozzle has to be 
set on the lowest setting or it quites right away from the backflow. 
Bummer. Takes a while to fill up. Of course, now I can actually fill up, 
and there are no fumes in the van, and no gas leaking all over the engine 
compartment from the massive leaks in the rotten hose. But it is slow to 
fill.
    Anybody got any fixes for this?
