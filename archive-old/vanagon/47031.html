Subject: Just got a 1987 Westy Syncro!!

From: &quot;W.R. Transue&quot; &lt;trans_at_castle_dot_net&gt;

I just got a 1987 syncro GL Westfalia camper! Wolfsburg gray. Mint body &amp;
interior. It has 121,000 miles (~90,000 on current engine). Leaks oil from
front &amp; rear seals, looks like it has a punctured cv boot in the front (and
a bootie from a stabilizing bar in the front also is broken), may need a new
u joint on the drive shaft, and a mufflet pipe (only one from manifold to
exhaust pipe piece. I figure between $1 &amp; 2,000 to fix up. 

Any suggestions?

On that note, can anyone recommend an HONORABLE VW mechanic in the
central/northern NJ area? I work in Somerset, so close to work would be
perfect (I saw a place called Autobahn on rte. 22. Small and pretty seedy,
but maybe?).


I also can't seem to light that damn refrigerator on gas... any suggestions
there? I've read the fridge suggestions on the syncro page (I tried rapid
fire ignition plunges.. holding the B button down for 30 secs, etc.. but to
no avail... any tios would be GREATLY appreciated!!). 

Thanks for any insights!!

Bill
