So Jan Allbright says:

&gt; Help Me Oh Mighty List!
&gt; 
&gt; Was doing the valves on the old '72 and now I have a distinct
&gt;   PUTT PUTT PUTT...
&gt; Rolled into a gas station and a young fellow (another bus owner) said
&gt;  &quot;sounds like you need to do your valves, man&quot;
&gt; I had set the valves to .006 (as per St. Muir). This always worked
&gt;  on the Bugs....Is there something about the Bus that I do not know?
&gt; Are the valves too loose? Too tight? Should they be set at .004?

I'd just re-adjust them.  Maybe you did something wrong and just
need to redo it.  Heads might need re-torquing, but readjust first.
