&gt; Subject:       diesel torque secs.

&gt; Hi volks......IT&quot;S friday ....saturday is vanagon day
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone send the torque spec. for a vanagon diesel flywheel to crank shaft 
&gt; bolts and preasure plate to flywheel bolts, also the oil pump bolts torque.?
According to Bentley:
Diesel flywheel to crank: 54ft/lb
They only list one for pressure plate to flywheel: 18ft/lb
(assume it's same for all clutches)

Picture shows two different torques for oil pump:
7 ft/lb for short bolt(s)
18 ft/lb for long bolt(s)
also 7 ft/lb for &quot;oil deflector&quot; inside pan.

&gt; I am working on replacing my  vannagon diesel with a jetta diesel engine. 
Good luck!
