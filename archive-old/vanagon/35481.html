 &gt; once you find out about someone who strangled themselves with a sports car,
 &gt; it's a little hard to forget. :)  regardless of their previous 
accomplishments
 &gt; and so forth, that's the sort of thing that sticks in your mind. like the
 &gt; fellow, Wrong-way Corrigan (i think that was his last name).

Corrigan died just recently.  He was denied clearance to Europe, took off &quot;for 
California&quot; and wound up in Ireland. &quot;I must have flown the wrong way&quot; he 
maintained till the day he died.

What kind of plane *did* he fly across the Atlantic?
