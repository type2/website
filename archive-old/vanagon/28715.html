&gt; &gt;I have a friend - a non-list member - who recently bought an '89 Vanagon 
&gt; &gt;that was equipped with alloy wheels.  As I recall from my Vanagon shopping 
&gt; &gt;days ('91 Westy) the alloy wheels, though gorgeous, had some pretty 
&gt; &gt;daunting care requirement/recommendations, such as weekly washing, 
&gt; &gt;avoiding certain detergents, etc, that were apparently related to 
&gt; &gt;corrosion problems.

Geez, like alloy wheels are brand new, come on people, my '86 Quantum
had em, the Corrado has 2 sets, 1 winter, 1 summer.  Hell a friends
'78 Challenger has em, my aunt had alloys on her '78 DIESEL rabbit.
I mean alloy wheels are hardly cutting edge in the 90's.  Sure, if you
never ever wash em they corrode.  If you wash em even 1 time a month
and wax them carefully 4 times a year, they will last indefinitely.
If you never touch them, and let the brake dust cake black over them
they will pit, corrode, look like hell.
