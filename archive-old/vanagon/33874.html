Subject: Re: Bus Sightings


Since everyone seems to be talking about bus sightings, I'll add one of 
my own.  I live in Seattle, where there is a fairly high bus/VW content.  
On my block alone there are 5(count'em 5) buses.  I have one, my neighbor 
has 2, and there are 2 others about 5 houses down.  Plus there are about 
5 bugs as well.  I think I probably live in the area with the highest 
aircooled VW density in the city.  Anyone have any higher stats where 
they are?

Also, does anyone know how to remove the heater control flap, the rear 
one that is in front of the engine?  Mine is stuck shut and I can't seem 
to unstick it.

Thanks
Craig
