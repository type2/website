The NEATO list had a lot, but not all.  Anyone know how they
got the ones they did and if there are more?  I'd be willing
to coordinate Mcode listing efforts and put them on a web
page.  



I think someone looked through old dealer books.  I misplaced my NEATO
newsletter,   but someone could write the author and ask where the info came
from.
