Subject: BUS BLUEPRINTS

Howdy,
	I am looking to obtain a set of blueprints, exterior dimensions 
for a VW bus prior to 1970-73.  If anyone has any knowledge of where 
these can be obtained I would appreciate it if you could drop me a line at:

			3mmj2_at_qlink.queensu_dot_ca

I would greatly appreciate any input.  I'm planning on building a scaled 
down fibreglass shell of a VW bus.  Thanks for all your help.

					MARTIN
