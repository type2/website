Subject: Ben Pon's Mother Goose /f

A few selections from Ben Pon's Mother Goose:

Jack's split it ran quite rich,
his wife's it ran quite lean,
and so between the two of them
they fooled the smog-test machine.


Diddle Diddle Dumpling, my son John,
screeched to the left and couldn't go on
one shoe off and one shoe on,

Little Miss Moptop,
sat in her Poptop,
a stately Vanagon Diesel;
along came a Spyder
tailgating behind her,
so she floored it and oiled the weasel.
