Subject: RE: Vanagon Side step, low cost shocks



&gt;P.S.  Who sells good low cost Vanagon shocks?

I bought four Gabriels from Sears for $16.99 each on sale, and they
bolted right on to the '80 V6anagon. Seems like an OK, soft shock,
lifetime warranty. They aren't Konis, but they also aren't $100 each.
