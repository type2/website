Subject: Re: Defeating '75 bus self-destructs

My previous TII was a '75 that was great when it ran, but was very frustrating,
as it was my first experience with fuel injection.  I believe that '75 was the
first year that the TII's were F.I.'d, but it looks like you have carburetors
(since the distributor for F.I. is a special unit), you have escaped the
biggest of your woes.  If not, carefully inspect and replace ANY hose that
looks old (I was going to do this, but waited too long, resulting in the second
saddest experience of my life--watching my Westy torch itself on the side of
the road).  

If I remember right, the tool I used for the oil filter was a cheap, stamped
looking unit (probably from Kragen) that had a short handle, completely
enclosed the bottom of the filter (i.e. engaged all the flats), and could take
a 1/2 inch socket drive.  The  handle was short enough to clear the
obstructions, allowing the device to snuggle up against the filter bottom. 
Then using the driver, I could loosen the filter enough to remove it by hand.

BTW, the saddest experience of my life was when I totalled out Dixie, the '65
Plain Bus I had before The Clone, my '75 Westy.  Dixie met her fate through a
combination of stupidity and lack of attention on my part that resulted in her
taking down a street light with her right front corner.  Dixie had been very
good to me and deserved better.

Anyway, best of luck on your new acquisition.
