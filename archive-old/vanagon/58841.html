Subject: RE: Rebuilt alternator for my 91 Carat

&gt;I have always wondered about this.  They should charge at anything over 13.2
&gt;volts, but I assumed there was some &quot;breakover&quot; voltage that was applied
&gt;in excess of the 13.2.  I, too, have seen cars running at 14 volts and above,
&gt;batteries bubbling away.  What are the factors in this choice?  Does
increasing
&gt;the voltage above 13.2v decrease the charge time?  At what voltage will the
&gt;the battery start overcharging?
&gt;
&gt;Anybody know the best voltages for maintaining a charge without overcharging,
&gt;for quick-charging a battery, and for daily driving?  

Batteries will charge at any where from 12 to 15.5 volts. But you are right
about the implications of higher charging. A way we used to condemn
batteries was to put a heavy charge to them and if they went above 15.5
volts the battery is suspect to being bad. If you use a maintenance free
battery you don't want to charge it at a higher rate because you could boil
out some of the acid. A 13.5 volt charge is good to keep the battery alive.
You can charge it at 14.5 volts but keep an eye on the fluid. HTH
