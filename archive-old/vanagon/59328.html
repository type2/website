Subject: Help, I'm loosing oil

Howdy volks,

I'm going through about a quart of oil every time I fill up (thats about 1
quarte every 225 miles).  Thats an awful lot of oil.  I rebuilt the engine
about 15k ago.  It was happening before I rebuilt the engine and still
continues now.

I don't show any kind of leak.  Although, there is a tiny drop hanging at the
bottom of the oil pressure sending unit.  Maybe its all blowing out from this
when the engine is under load.

I don't see the usual blue smoke coming from the exhaust that is usually
associated with burning oil.  Although, I can't tell when I'm driving down
the road (for obvious reasons).

I'm running 10w40 (10w30 is too light).  Oil pressure remains at about 55 lbs
(I have a analog guage that I installed) after then engine is up to operating
temp.

Here's the results from my last emmissions test:

Test      Standard     My Van
CO        1.20            0.01
HC PPM  220           95
Dilution    6.00           13.51
RPM        1600          1068

Does anyone see anthing unusual right off the bat?  Anything I should check
or test for?
