WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIP-OFF
AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

About the supposed &quot; new &quot; release of Bill Fisher's classic work, &quot; How t=
o
Hot Rod Volkswagen Engines &quot;.

This is now being marketed and sold with a new front and rear cover in a
sealed plastic bag, mine was from Bugpack. I haven't done a line by line
comparison but THIS IS NOT AN UP DATED VERSION. I was assured by the sale=
s
guy that this had &quot; lots of new information &quot;. WRONG............. As
examples, not one word of the now common 90.5mm or 92 or 94 pistons, no
mention of the new fuel injection systems, no mention of either Pauter
Machine, Bergman, etc. As far as I can tell there is absolutely no
difference between this &quot; new &quot; edition and my original from 1971.

I still think that this is one of the single best volumes ever written
about air cooled VW's and should be read by everyone with more than a
casual interest in them.

I don't like the whole idea of the sealed plastic bag &quot; you opened it so
now we can't let you return it &quot; marketing strategy. This is just plain
prevarication and the old bait and switch.

Do get one if you don't already have this book, BUT................ don't
be dumb like me and spend your money on a old book with a new cover.
It is NOT updated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is NOT a new edition!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT IS A REPRINT OF A FINE 70's VINTAGE BOOK
