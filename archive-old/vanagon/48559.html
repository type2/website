Subject: Propane tank removal

Hi,
	my propane tank is *very* rusty. I have to remove it from the 
Westy before I try to pass swiss vehicle inspection next week or they'll
fail me big time. It so happens that it's conveniently just out of propane.
Is it a difficult job to do to remove it? Are there things I have to be
particularly careful with? How can I cover up the connection nicely afterwards,
until I get another tank (or put back the old one at least for my 2 weeks
vacation in september). It has to look good because the inspection guys have
a nice well-lit pit from which they enjoy a full view of the underside of the
van.

Thanks.
