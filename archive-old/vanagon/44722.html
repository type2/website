Subject: Re: CB &amp; VW humor

&gt;&gt; With all the talk lately of CB's in VW's, I just couldn't resist....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;..and eleven long haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse Microbus.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you don't remember, your bus is older than you are.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Indeed, my bus is almost as old as I am.  But this I don't remember, why
&gt;don't you enlighten me?

        From C.W. McCall's runaway 70's CB hit song &quot;Convoy&quot;. And the
resulting Kris Kristofferson movie based on same. Or song based on
movie-doesn't really matter with so little plot. Cheesy but immensely
funny. I highly reccomend CW McCall's Greatest Hits tape for road trips,
fun listening with ever so little cheese...    ;-)

        This came up a couple of months ago, search the archives for more info.


        &quot;Say, you'd better back off a bit, them hogs is gettin' intense up
here!&quot;

Peace,
