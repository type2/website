Subject: High Top Vanagon???

I was just looking out my office window, when I saw a white
vanagon with a white fiber glass high top go down I78. I've
seen many different buses and vanagons go by on the highway
but this was a first. Does anybody know anything about such
a vehicle (other than the heads leak)??? I've seen buses that
have high tops but never a vanagon.
