Subject: AC in Air-Cld vs Water-Cld, Opinions Please!


RE: Air-Conditioning and our Beloved VW's

I have an 86' Westy with AC that doesn't appear to affect performance,
over-heating, etc., when it's running. Can the same be said for AC on an
air-cooled VW?

What's the story on AC in an air-cooled VW (say a 70's or 80's vanagon,
1.8, 2.0L) ?

Would running the AC in the extreme conditions (i.e., HOT!)
have a 'disasterous' effect of the air-cooled engine ?
What are the short- and long-term effects ?

I'd like to hear the experiences from those running AC on their air-cooled
vanagons, type2's, and from those of you with practical-
technical-theoretical thoughts on the subject.

Thanks, Chris

P.S. I'm considering selling my 82' 2.0L, air-cooled vanagon to a fellow
listee in Texas, who wants to install AC for obvious reasons. But, I'm
leary of selling him a vehicle that may not meet his needs (asumming AC
on an air-cooled engine in the middle of Texas is not such a great idea).
