Subject: Good news and bad news

The bad news is, I'll be signing off for a while... since I can't keep up
with the list volume right now, my &quot;other life&quot; is calling!  I'll be gone for
a week or so, but don't worry, i'll be back before you miss me  ;^)

And now for the good news... there may be a '65-'67 splitty restoration in my
future!  More on that when I return...

Peace,
