Subject: trip report (short) odd vanagon

Howdy all,
        My wife and I and some friends have just returned from a couple
weeks off the List and Westie camping in the Florida Keys. We camped at Long
Key St. Park the entire time. A beautiful place to camp. All the sites are
water-front and mostly shaded with swimming,fishing,boating and whatever a
few steps from your site. Lots of aquatic life, unusual birds,fish, and
plants to observe. An ideal Westie area.
        Also interesting to visit, is Key West, a city of full of a mellow
tropical ambiance. While spending the day there, I happened to notice an
unusual Westie with a sloped front end configuration (similar in appearance
to a Ford Aerostar front) . I couldn't tell if it was a custom modification
or some type of Brazilian/Euro hybrid. It was raining and the owners wern't
around and I didn't have time to thoroughly check it out (I was being
harassed by my vanagon Illiterate companions) but from a quick glance at the
rear, it might have been a diesel. Anyway, it was odd to see the single
radiator grill sitting just above the bumper and protruding forward a bit.
