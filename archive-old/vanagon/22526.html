&gt; I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.

So are you if you want to pay $3500 for it.

&gt; It is sort of rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.

That's horrible!

&gt; The engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression 
&gt; on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic 
&gt; transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.
&gt; I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a 
&gt; Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is 
&gt; too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into 
&gt; a camper.
&gt; 

Wait a while, you should be able to find a camper with a good engine
and very little rust for that price.

Water damage is very hard to totally fix.
If you have experience in welding, bodywork and mechanics, offer this
guy $350 for it and be willing to put another $3000 into getting it 
running.


I don't know where you're from, but people in David Easterwoods area!
Keep an eye out for him will ya?
