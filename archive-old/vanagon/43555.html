Subject: HELP - NEED YOUR ADVICE ABOUT BRAKE


	My '66 Westfalia arrived today, I would like to hear out your 
advices about front wheel brake, it is locked. I can't move it. I tried to 
bang on the disc brake wheel to loosen up the disc unfortunate it didnt 
work that way. Oh yeah its kinda rust and didnt run for 19 years.
