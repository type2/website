 The stuff is called Stabilant 22A and
&gt;has a VW part # of ZVW-186-001.  There was a TSB that calls for it's use
&gt;in solving a variety of Digifart problems.  It is really expensive, and
&gt;I've not tried it out myself.  VW wants $40 for 2oz.  Below I've attached
&gt;the manufacturer's phone number, address, and prices.  If anyone has used
&gt;this stuff I would like to hear about your experiences.  Supposedly it 
&gt;works wonders.  TIA.

Yes, it *is* expensive...
Yes, the company listed will sell direct....
Yes, it works, with this caveat;  works great at small signal levels, ie
low amperage/voltage conditions, but doesn't seem to have much of an effect
at high voltages or amperages.  Esp. good for things such as temp senders,
dashboard connectors, etc.  Absolutely super for the wiper contacts of the
air flow meter, and the harness connectors throughout the engine
compartment.  And a *little* smear goes a long way - it can also be diluted
with alcohol to seep into things like switches that are difficult to
disassemble, push buttons on older radios, etc.
