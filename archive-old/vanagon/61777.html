I've seen a few of these at Burnsville VW, Burnsville, MN.  Didn't look real
close though.  Can't afford one anyway. :-(

&lt;&lt; Anyone with an interest in the new Eurovan Winnibago/Westy, that is
 within driving distance of Niagara Falls Canada may want to attend the
 June Jitter Bug show on June 22 1997.  I was at the cruise night tonight
 (Sat. June 21/97) and what should show up, but a VR6 Eurovan Winnibago
 version of the VW Westphallia.  This vehicle will be at the show
 tomorrow.  It is on loan from Volkswagen Canada, and is a stretched
 Eurovan with Winnibago's version of the Westy.  Very interesting.  It
 apparently is not available yet, but it certainly was there in the flesh
 for everyone to look at.  It will be set up at the show. &gt;&gt;
