Here's the info on the rest stop at Tulare:

It's Rest Area No. 42 (the number may not be posted)
in Tulare, on Highway 99, south-bound, 2.5 miles north of
Tipton, which I assume must be an exit/street, or something
noticable.  They have:
rest rooms
place to sleep
water
picnic tables
phone
handicaped access (for the mentally insane of this list)
  but NO sanitation station, so I guess we'll have to
  empty porta-potties on &quot;someone's&quot; front right tire  :)
Anyway, I propose we meet there, as this saves the
cost of the KOA.  It is vaguely possible, although it's
just a guess, that they might have showers.  But if
not, we can probably &quot;gerry-rig&quot; something up!  :)
