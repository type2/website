&gt;There is an 86 Wolfsburg Weekender  (the WWW) which had the following:
&gt;
&gt;Fold down rear seat (into bed)
&gt;Refrigerator
&gt;Westy Poptop
&gt;Alloy wheels
&gt;Fiberglass bumpers

I don't think so, unless someone added the wheels and bumpers themselves.
Fiberglass bumpers weren't introduced until '87, and then they were only on
the Wolfsburg Ed. 7 passenger vans. Ditto with the alloy wheels.
