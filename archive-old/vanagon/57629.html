&gt; For some unknown reason the dipstick in my 85 sticks in the tube if it
&gt; hasn't been removed for a couple of hours.  The first time this
&gt; happened, I gave it a good yank and the bottom part of the dipstick
&gt; broke off at the upper notch and fell into the motor.  It took a while
&gt; but I was finally able to remove the 3 inch piece with a magnet after
&gt; unbolting the oil filler pipe from the block.  Some time later I
&gt; discovered another broken dipstick that the PO had stashed under the
&gt; front seat.
&gt; What could cause my dipstick to stick?
Maybe another dipstick.
