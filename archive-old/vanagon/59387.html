Subject: Eurovan wheel bearings

I just finished replacing the front wheel bearings on my 93 Eurovan. It has
about 80,000 miles on it.

Symptoms: Chuging noise/vibration from front at 20 to 50 mph. Not bad but
getting worse with time. Slight tendency to make the noise during slight
turns (either way)

I am the second owner and some work had been done before I bought it (Left
outer CV boot, both rack boots, waterpump &amp; timing belt). 

As you may know EV parts are very hard to get from other then dealers. I
called my local parts store (Axel's in Danbury, CT 203-797-0490) and he
found a supply. Instead on the $110 from the dealer I paid about 80. I may
have gotten them cheaper but Axel is local and I can hammer on him in person
if the parts are bad. 

First, to do anything to the EV front end a holding tool must be
made/bought/stolen to stop the upper control arm from swinging down too far.

With this tool in place the procedure is very much like on a Syncro.
Disconnect upper/lower ball joint, tie rod, brake caliper. Then its just
like a Golf/jetta/syncro for removing the bearing from the housing. You can
do this with a special tool on the car but I have access to a press and did
it off the car. Took about 2 hrs per side.

With the new bearings the noise is gone.
