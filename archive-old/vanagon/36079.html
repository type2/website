&gt;Now the question. There has been a thread the past few days on the operation
&gt;of the air flaps and the thermostat etc. My uneducated observation while
&gt;working on the seal tells me that I have flaps but no thermostat and control
&gt;cable working those flaps. The spring is in place and under tension so I
&gt;assume that the flaps are being held in an  &quot;open&quot; position. Is that a
&gt;correct assumption and if so, now that we're into near spring weather is
that
&gt;an ok situation ?
&gt;
&gt;

If installed properly, the flaps do fail open.  The thermostat should be
restored to provide proper warm up and emissions operation.
