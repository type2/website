Someone asked me to try to get the price and dealer info of the EV VR6
Winnebago I saw last week at the dealer here in Asheville, but I
accidentally deleted the message -- so everyone gets the info:

97 Eurovan VR6 Winnebago - A/C &amp; auto with stereo, etc....
MSRP: $34785

The VW sales rep, Prescott,  at Deal Volkswagen seemed very knowledgeable
about the vehicle and was eager to talk about it and show it off.

Here's the dealer scoop:

Deal Volkswagen
136 Merrimon Ave.
Asheville, NC
704-252-1363

Sorry for the bandwidth for those uninterested...
