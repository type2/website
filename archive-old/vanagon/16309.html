Subject: Re: Squeaking from front end (spare tire?) of Vanagon

Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 25-Apr-95 Squeaking from front
end (s.. by Matt Weatherford_at_atl_dot_com 
&gt; My vanagon is just about the noisiest animal I have ever
&gt; experienced- (a notch above riding on the back of a wild boar)
&gt; Id like some advice on eliminating one of the most annoying sounds:
&gt;  
&gt; The spare tire under the front end seems to squeak and groan
&gt; as it rubs against the metal sandwich it is contained in.

I _JUST_ had this noise repaired in my van, The Slug.
It was worn upper control arm bushings making the offending racket.
QUITE a difference...

It _COULD_ be your spare, but sak the shop that did the front end work
if they swapped out the control arm bushings....
