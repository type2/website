Subject: ASCII map

Why ASCII.  Why not a Web page with map of the world.  Click on a dot, get
full color photo of van and owner, click again for full scanned repair history
with receipts.  Other hypertext jumps for each cat, musical instrument, 
fish dish, flannel pattern.  C'mon Joel, it's almost 1995, and whatever we
*can* do, we *must* do.  It's the Internet way.
