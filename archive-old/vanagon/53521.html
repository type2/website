Subject: Christmas Eve Breakdown

Hi All,
        I hope your Christms was enjoyable as ours, although we did have
one little hitch. Becky and I always travel to Olympia (about 110 miles
north of home) on Christmas eve for a get together with my family. We
left the party at about 11:30PM and expected to be home at 1:30. I got
within 20 miles of home and broke a water hose under the Vanagon. It was
bad enough that I couldn't continue, and after A half hour of tinkering
and trying to fix it (in a driving rainstorm) enough to limp home I
decided to call a friend to come and tow me home. I got the poor guy out
of bed at 2:00AM on Christmas Morning. What are friends for? He showed
up with a smile on his face and we towed my Westy home(he understands,
he is a longtime VW owner also). I am privlaged to have such good
friends. We got home at 3:30 and had to be up at 7:30 to start
preparation of the Turkey dinner for Becky's family who spent Christmas
day at our house. We had a good time with the family but were beat by
the time everyone left. The Westy is sheepishly sitting in the driveway
awaiting repairs. I have half a mind to just let her sit!! Apparently I
was a good boy last year. Becky gave me a really cool copper 3D
weathervane that is shaped like a VW bug. It even has a license plate
with my name on it! I wish you all a Happy New Year!!
