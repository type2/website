&gt;Subject: air in my hydraulic lifters?
&gt;About a month ago my '82 camper developed noisy valves when first
&gt;started. Although it would go away pretty quick it certainly got my
&gt;attention.
&gt;It has 8,000 miles on a rebuild done about a 10 months ago..yes it's
&gt;still under warantee. I took it back to the shop that did
&gt;the rebuild and subsequent tuneup and oil changes. They said there was
&gt;air in the hydraulic lifters and had squirted something into the
&gt;valves to prevent it from happening again. Is this a common thing, a
&gt;sign of future problems, both, or should I just relax and not worry?
&gt;Thanks, I appreciate any thoughts/ideas

My 82 Westy valve clattered also ---but when I topped off my oil it went away 
----if the oil got halfway between high and low marks on the stick ----the 
valve would clatter so I always topped it off.  Then it got worse --------
little by little ----come to find out it was my valve seat slowly giving way 
in the head.   Ask your rebuilder if he used new heads or rebuilt heads 
(rebuilt heads heads rewelded to cover the cracks) ----if they are rebuilt 
you are doomed ---if they are new and made in Spain --perhaps you will get 
40,000 miles out of them.  If they are German and made of titanium -it must 
be the air in the lifters  If titanium please tell me where you got them and 
who financed the purchase!!
