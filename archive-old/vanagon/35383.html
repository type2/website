Subject: Re: VW parts on CD-ROM

&gt;I went to the local VW dealer the other day to order a couple of VW
&gt;parts.  They had a really neat computer program where you look up the
&gt;specific vehicle that you're trying to locate parts for, you look up the
        &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;cool!  I asked him if it was on CD-ROM and he said it was.  Now why
&gt;doesn't VW sell this CD-ROM to customers like we???  Also, this
&gt;particular CD-ROM wasn't just for air-cooled VWs.  I think it had EVERY
&gt;VW ever on there.  It was pretty comprehensive.
&gt;
&gt;They need to get us those CD-ROMs!

        Hey, if we can get our hands on one we can set it up somewhere and
maybe download just what we need. Maybe we could get together a pool if VW
wanted to charge big bucks. Don't want to infringe, but Coyote Ron recently
posted that he had no space problems at Chaco. Whadda y'all think? I'd sure
love to see these goodies...

Peace,
