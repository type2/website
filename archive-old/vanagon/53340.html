If ancient chemistry memory serves me correctly, while an ozone molecule
does have a greater mass than a 'regular' oxygen molecule, it's less
dense.  That's why it rises, because a liter of ozone is lighter than a
liter of oxygen.  That extra oxygen atom is really trying to get out of
the ozone molecule (3's a crowd--remember) so the molecule is bigger, so
it's weight is taking up more room, making it less dense.  The reason
ozone forms is because one oxygen atom is let go by the
fluorcarbon-types and can't go around unescorted, so tags along with a
couple of oxygen buddies.

That's all for Friday's chemistry lesson class.
