&gt;My Vanagon came with a deep-cycle gelled electrolyte battery that actually
&gt;fits nicely in the unmodified battery comparment. Unfortunately, I think
&gt;the battery is no longer manufactured in this size. The batterly was
&gt;manufactured by Sonnenschein (German import) and is model Prevailer DF75. I
&gt;did some research and learned that Sonnenschein was purchased by a US
&gt;company, East Penn Manufacturing Company Inc. Apparently, East Penn
&gt;discontinued manufacture of the European-sized batteries. If anyone wants
&gt;to research this further with East Penn, their phone number is
&gt;610.682.6361.

The Prevailer DF75 was 8&quot;l x 7&quot;w x 7&quot;h, but unfortunately they no longer
make this battery.  East Penn now only carries the Type 24 and Type 27
deep-cycle batteries.
