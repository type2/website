Subject: Faucet Fun, window sliders, &amp; cupholders - '91 Westfalia

     All-
     
     1.  Working through the Westfaila stuff without benefit of a Factory 
     Manual.
     
     Propane tank full courtesy of PO.  Stove lights - I'm not ready to 
     deal with fridge-on-gas yet.  Move on.
     
     Filled the water tank for the first time.  Tried to get water to come 
     out the faucet - nothing.  Turning off the engine, noticed the sound 
     of a pump running, but nothing coming out of the faucet still.  
     Manipulated the knob, and got the noise (obviously the pump) to stop 
     (why doesn't this run through the &quot;master&quot; switch on the front of the 
     sink/stove/fridge?)
     
     So, before I start randomly taking stuff apart, is there a likely 
     problem?  Remember, it sounds like the pump motor is running, just 
     nothing coming out.
     
     2. I'm betting that wear of the Nylon slides is the reason my windows 
     sound like the dreaded &quot;fingernails-on-chalkboard&quot; when I open and 
     close them.  Garth seemed to intimate that the required number of 
     these thingies is 8 per vehicle; true?
     
     3. Can I use a reasonable length sheetmetal screw to attach a cup 
     holder to the floor on either side of the gear selector (automatic - 
     on top of the &quot;hump&quot;) without risking puncturing something on the 
     underside?
     
     TIA
     
     -Blaine
