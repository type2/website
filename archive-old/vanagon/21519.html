Subject: Type IV head removal

Hi,
I'm in the process of rebuilding my '73 engine and I'm having the dickens of a
time trying to get the heads off.  What's happening is that the cylinders want
to stay attached to the heads and not to the case (why is Muir so adament about
not letting the cyls loose anyway?).  I'm really afraid of cracking some
cooling fins so I want to be gentle.  What happens if I do crack a fin on the
cyl?  Would I have to replace it?  Does anyone have any ideas.

Oh yeah, another thing is that there doesn't seem to be a thermostat around on
my engine.  What does the thermostat actually control on an air-cooled engine? 
I also need a timing degree marker thingy that screws on in front of the fan. 
Mine seems to be missing.  Can I get one of these anywhere?  Hmmm, actually,
there's a lot of stuff missing on this engine.

I'll keep you updated if anyone's interested.

Thanks,
Erik
