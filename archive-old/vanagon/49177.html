Subject: RE: EV - Help Tire Needed!

Trace,

Why not give Tire Rack or one of those mail order places a call. I =
ordered 4 Michelin MXL Reinforced tires for my EV last year from them, =
and I paid $80 or $90 each.

The MXLs were a hell of a lot better than the Contis my EV came =
with...and may be better from what I've heard than the Goodyears.
