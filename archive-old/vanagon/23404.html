Subject: Wailaki oil cooler.

    dear wailakers,
  it is with great sorrow that i must tell you i can't make it to our
busbash this weekend. FESTUS is still in pieces on the workbench, so i'm
not goin' nowhere rite now...i was really looking forward to finally
meeting some of you I.R.L. (= &quot;in real life&quot;, learned this one from &quot;THE
NET&quot;, Martha !) maybe we'll do something like that again some time ? and
speaking of engines: anyone know how much to torque the 3 bolts that hold
the oil cooler in a 73 bus ? St.Muir doesn't say, and i don't want to squish
the oil port gaskets...
  have fun in Wailaki !

        ciao, Gregor \ 73 westy &quot;FESTUS&quot;
