Hey waitaminute....I've got another Martha and the Vanagon song!
(with appologies to Grand Funk)

Sweet sweet martha was doin her act....
She entertained the whole crew, and thats a natural fact....

We're a Vanagon fan
We're a Vanagon fan
We're commin thru your town
We're 'merica bound...
We're a Vanagon fan


Much too much caffene and much too much free time this week....
