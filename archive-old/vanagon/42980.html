I read your message about using a spray bottle and thought of 
spraying myself made me cringe.  :-)  Yep, you guessed, it, I live in SE 
Nebraska and it gets very humid here.  The western part of the state out 
past Ogallala gets alot more tolerable and then the spray bottle thing 
would work well.

This all gets me to wondering though...on the VintageVW list, this same 
topic came up last year about water to help cool you down.  The typical 
threads about swamp coolers, rust factors, etc. soon ensued.  But I was 
wondering, couldn't a person get one of the humidifier devices that puts 
out a super-fine mist of cool water and run that?  Has anyone tried this 
in the &quot;drier&quot; areas of the U.S.?  Does it work?

Thanks for you thoughts...

Slater!
