&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1974 Thing for sale.  I am located in Santa Monica, CA (near
&gt; LA).  The Thing has about 30K miles on a replacement engine
&gt; (Mexican-built).  The engine does not leak oil and runs great.  I
&gt; replaced all the weel brake cylinders and the master cylinder about 1
&gt; 1/2 years ago.  It has a removable, fiberglass hardtop.  The wheels are
&gt; white-spoke and oversized.  The tires have about 15K miles on them and
&gt; are 215 R 15 in back and 205 R 15 in front.  I am asking $2750.  Please
&gt; send any inquiries to landerho_at_law3.law.ucla_dot_edu or call 310/394-2679.
