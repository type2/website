Subject:        Re: Synthetic Oil(s)

Why did you choose a 5-50? My local VW shop recommended either 5-30 or
10-30 (Mobil 1). My driving conditions are mostly highway. Weather temps
vary between low 40's up to high 90's depending on the season. My '90 Westy
has just under 7k miles.

Any recommendations?

TIA

Chris
