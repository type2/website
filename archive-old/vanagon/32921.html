Subject: Remote Purchase: Was NEED INFO ON 91 VANAGON GL

Cindy, 

I've happily bought two vanagons sight unseen last year. There is
some risk involved, hut if its a vehicle you want, and can't find
in your local want ads, go for it.


Here are my suggestions:

First. If you can get a listmember to look at it, great. Use that 
information to confirm what the seller told you. It doesn't have to be a 
complete check-out, you are just trying to find out of the seller  is on 
the up-and-up. If no listmember, call the local Better Business bureau
trolling for complaints, or talk to the person the seller says maintains
the car, anything you can think of to find out if the seller is
legit. Meanwhile, if possible, drive as many Vanagons as possible, 
those of friends, on used car lots, etc. You need to collect data  for 
step five.

Second. Agree on a price. Yup! Before having a mechanic look at
it, before anything else, agree on a price. Hammer them down, do
your usual beat them to a pulp negotiation, and make sure you 
have a price you are happy with if the vehicle is in the condition
stated. 

Third.  With the deal, offer a deposit (like $200). (If possible 
or you are suspicious, put the deposit on a Visa card, so you can contest
the charges if the seller trys anything funny.) Tell the seller the 
deposit will become non-refundable after you have a third party check the 
van out to your satisfaction and you decide to proceed with the purchase. 
Assure the seller you will move with all deliberate speed, and explain 
your timetable.

Fourth, have a local VW mechanic -who knows about the heads- 
check it out for you. Make sure they drive it, and check each
and every knob, switch and gear. Ask them to examine it for signs
of body work, as well. If its perfect (or as advertised), proceed!
If not, decide if you still want the van, and at what price. Either 
renegotiate, or get you money back. Worst case at this point is 
that you loose the money invested in the mechanic's inspection.

Five. Show up on the scene. Do a karma check (see St. Muir), sitting
in and driving. If you are happy, complete the deal. If not, walk away 
from it. This is the worst case, and you will be out the deposit, travel 
costs, and the inspection. But the step by step procedure and a 
little luck should protect you from reaching that point. 

Good luck
