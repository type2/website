Caution!  Check the size of the fische that this reader will handle. I have
heard that the size used by VW fische is different from whatever is &quot;standard&quot;
Here.

Suggestion:  Many libraries  have fische reader/printers for patrons to use
with library fische, there is no reason you can't bring your own fische - I
have done this with a repair manual for an oscilloscope and used the public
library's reader/printer to make a hard copy at  $0.10 per page or so.
