Subject: ANNOUNCE: Transporter Chat Server


There comes a time when you get some of the bugs worked out of a program
and you get very sick of fussing with it. This point in the software life
cycle is known as the &quot;release date.&quot; ;)

Transporter Chat. Happy hour is at 6:30 p.m. Pacific, nightly. Read the
readme file; if you can't deal with Javascript mail me and I'll send it
you. The chat server itself requires a 2.0 or better browser. I've had
reports that it won't work from a NeXT browser; use at your own risk.

It's a blind dir, you can't get to it from the home page. Please don't
propogate this URL, especially don't post it to any newsgroup.
