I guess I was typing too fast this morning.  In pretending to be
miffed by the shower teasing, some of you (many, actually) took me
seriously.  I was just teasing! (it's Friday, remember?  :).  Nobody
loves this group more than I do.  

Besides, as one person suggested, if I REALLY wanted to get back at
you all, I'd charge you for showers at Baja.
