Subject: Brake Drum removal -- 87 Vanagon

I can't get either of the rear brake drums off.  I've ordered the Bentley
book but haven't received it yet.  Is there some trick?  So far I've:
pulled the wheel, removed the two 11mm bolts, released the parking brake,
and yanked, banged.  The drum rotates freely and seems to be frozen on
rather than simply being held up by the brake shoes.  Is it simply a matter
of getting violent with it?  There doesn't seem to be a good way of getting
a good grasp on it to yank.  Thanks for any help.  (

Please cc: or respond directly (I'm in DIGEST mode)
