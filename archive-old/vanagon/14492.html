Subject: Re: Need Information about Eurovan(s)/FFFFF

&gt;&gt;my life has been the van on the A team and I think that is a vw bus..

sarchasm...in response to the &quot;helpful&quot; response from someone else..
btw, if you dont think the eurovan looks alot like a minivan and alot 
different from the traditional vw van, you're insane. 

&gt;&gt;(blah, blah)... 5 cylinders right?, just like the
&gt;&gt;later vanagons... so power is probably equal..
&gt;
&gt;YIKES!  I'd like to have Steven Johnson jump up and tell us his '91 Westy
&gt;has 5 cylinders!  While the EV does have 5 cyls, the only N. American Vanagons
&gt;with more than 4 cyls that I know of have Porsche flat sixes stuffed in 'em,
&gt;and they sure didn't leave Hannover that way...

ah contrair.. i almost purchased a 1990 vanagon with a 5 cyl, (someone beat 
me to it while i was at college, DOH!)  im sure of it. and it was unmodified 
and everything.  It DID have a weekender package, although i dont think that 
that has anything to do with it, but maybe the 5 cyln is only on that option..

&gt;hmm...  vt_dot_edu...  what is that?  Virgin. Tech?  what exactly is a &quot;Hokie&quot;?

im not 100% sure but i think its some kinda turkey, but hey, im an engineer 
so i have more important things to worry about than school spirit.
