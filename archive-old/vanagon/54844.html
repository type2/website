Subject: RE: Temperature needle low: thermostat or sensor? 

Before I ordered a new sensor, I would pull the old one and check for corrosion.

Corrosion around the sensor where it screws into the engine will affect ground and can cause 
a change in gauge reading.

Simply clean it up, apply an antisieze compound, screw it back in and see what kind of 
readings you get.

&gt;On the gauge the needle does not get beyond the 'block' on the left (20% of
&gt;max), driving for half an hour in traffic with outside temp between 5 and
&gt;10 degrees C. Is this long enough for the needle to get to the middle?
&gt;There is plenty of heat from the front and rear heaters.
&gt;
&gt;I have ordered a new thermostat, but could it be the sensor itself that is
&gt;at fault? Is it worth getting a new sensor?
&gt;
&gt;For a brief time after changing the coolant, the temperature did swing to
&gt;the middle and back. Can I assume this was just due to an air bubble which
&gt;has burped itself out - the radiator bleed screw lets out coolant.
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, and almost certainly unconnected, the red LED in the middle of
&gt;the gauge does not flash even if you pull out the wire going into the
&gt;expansion tank. Is this normal?
&gt;
&gt;Thirdly, I have also ordered an expansion tank pressure cap just to be safe
&gt;- is this too paranoid?
