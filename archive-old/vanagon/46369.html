&gt; I have an 1988 Westy with a small (about 14&quot; x14&quot;) plastic vent in the

&gt; the perimeter.  I have had two replaced under warrenty.  The third time (out 
&gt; of warrenty) my dealter informed me that the price was $175 (what a 
&gt; suprise).  I contacted the original manufacturer in California and they 
&gt; couls send me a replacement for $150.  Does anyone know of another source 
&gt; for the vents?  How do I prevent the cracks from developing?  I don't drive

$150 !!! Mine has some hairline cracks (minor) and a chip out of one 
corner. It doesn't leak, so I haven't bothered with it, but I did see 
a cover which looked almost identical for $25 at an RV place. I'd 
take some measurements &amp; shop around...
