Subject: Re: corrections on capacitor fix air flow box (22MFD vs 10MFD?)

&gt;The procedure you sent out is incorrect,was also incorrect form the Lars
&gt;Herrnsdorf in Sweden. The capacitor (+) could go to terminal #2 and (-) to
&gt;teriminal #4(ground). Below is the post form the file archives.Also note
&gt;the added ground wire. I bought a tantalum 22MFD 35VDC capacitor cost me
&gt;$4.50, the tantalum types cost more other types. Also the electronics store

yes, use 22microfarad, 10 works but not enough.  The original posting for
this was drawn from a LIMBO??  article and mentions using both 10 and 22
versions. Like someone else posted, just nick the wires and solder in the
cap, then tape over and roll back the boot.  Mine was done 2 years ago, a
day after my first high speed/distance run, dead every 1/2 mile after
1/2hour driving time elapsed.  No repeats, no starting probs etc.  and the
$0.41 price is right, caps are cheap. Electronics shop guy just handed me
it, for nada.  Tim
