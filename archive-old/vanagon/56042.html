Subject: FS:  '89 Westfalia in Pa. (Repost)

Just a quick note that the 1-owner '89 Westy that I posted to the list some 
time ago is still for sale.  Excellent condition, fully loaded, Kelley Blue 
Book value is $16,200, asking $12,500.  Really need to sell it, as my motor 
has blown up on my '85 daily driver and I have no $$ to fix it. Email me 
directly for a full description.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
