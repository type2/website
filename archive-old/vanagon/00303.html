Hello All:)
	Sorry about the blurb earlier. I was trying to do an archive search
	before asking some questions and was obviously unsuccesful. Could
	someone help me out with the search??? 
	I have a 78 bus and am making some electrical mods including a larger
	alternator and 2nd Battery. The bigger alt is installed (whew) and I 
	have a deep cycle battery but have not hooked it up. I would appreciate
	any knowledge anyone has gained/borrowed/stolen on the subject; bore me
	to death with all of the technical details, I'm an engineer and have 
	already accepted the fact that I have no life outside of tinkering 8) 
	I want max juice and am willing to make any logical mod. Thanks!
