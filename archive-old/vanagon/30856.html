Hello,

If you have a good public library nearby, see if they have &quot;SAMS&quot; 
(actually, Howard W. Sams PhotoFacts).  These are schematics and test and 
diagnostic procedures.  They are available for most radios, TV, VCR's etc. 
ever sold in the US, regardless of country of origin.  These packets are 
also available through your local TV &amp; electronics supplier, but probably 
cost $30 or so, which may be too much to pay to just get started on 
repairing an old radio.

Mike
