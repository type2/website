Subject: What is that thing under the seat?

OK, OK, I've read all the manuals that came with my Westy, I looked at a
friend's Bentley but ran out of time before we had to leave.  So I'm doing the
cheap thing and resorting to the list to ask a simple dumb question I ought to
be able to figure out myself but haven't...

Under the rear bench passenger seat, on the right side (looking toward the back)
is a small black box mounted to the side of the cabinet.  It has some vent holes
and is clearly associated with electricity.  In fact is appears to have
connections to the 110V outside plug and to the battery 12V system.

A guess would be that this thing trickle charges the battery (maybe batteries)
when your connected to outside power.  Could someone give me the quick and dirty
explanation?  Maybe even tell me what this thing is called so I can find it in
Bentley?

I'm grateful already.
