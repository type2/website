Subject: Buy this Westy??

Hi,

I have the opportunity to buy an '87 Camper GL, manual trans, power windows etc.
with 63K miles in excellent condition. Anybody have a current NADA book or
want to suggest what it's worth? I've been looking for a long time and
think I might go for this one.

I'm in digest mode so please reply directly to me because I have to decide soon.

Thanks!!
