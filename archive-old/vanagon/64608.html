Check with the Bus Depot for AFMs - they often have both new and used, and
will know the differences. Old Volks Home (Sherwood Automotive) may also have
at similar price - I haven't received their catalog yet.

However I suspect your O2 sensor may be the culprit - it can cause similar
symptoms - and a failed one often makes the engine rich no matter what else
you do. (primary feedback loop for steady-state operation.) Try just
disconnecting it and see if runs nearly normal - they often do. If so, replace
with a good Bosch.

The Platinum plugs should be fine - I've used them forever.

Does it make a big difference what kind of bosch plugs I am
using? I am using platinums right now because they give me a more favorable
I
have had them in for 6 mos. They appear to be burning clean. My 02 sensor
however, has a thick black deposit on it indicating that it is running a
little too rich. It sure smells like it is. I have tried to lean it up some
but like I said before the idle and mixture adjustments are not working.
Any
Idea's? Thanks
