Subject:      Re: Westy tire question

     What size are these tires? What type of tread do they have?
     What is the ride like?

&gt; Well its time I joined the ranks of tire seekers for my 85 Westy. So far in
&gt; Reno Nevada all I have come up with is;
&gt;
&gt;   Bridgestone model RD603V - 6 ply sidewall, 45 psi rated, C load rated
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Found it for $76 (mounted, balanced, etc). Does anyone have any experiance
&gt; with this particular tire. TIA
