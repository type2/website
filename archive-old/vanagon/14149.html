Joel:

Now that I think I have enough of an idea of what's going on so as to prevent 
totally messing up, I'll reply that...

I'm in the Northwest/West suburban area of Chicago, IL, and currently have an
82 (I think) Vanagon. I say I think because the Owner's manual says '81, but it 
was built in '82 and is titled as an '82.  Also have a '70 Bug and a '94 Jetta, 
and recently sold my '82 Diesel Rabbit.
