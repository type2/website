So J. Meade says:
&gt; 
&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your comment.  I'll replace the screw, as you suggest.  I did 
&gt; raise the front end, but I'm coming to the conclusion I need a good full 
&gt; day off in good weather and go through this thing from start to finish 
&gt; while the parts stores are open.  I think I can get at it this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Jim,

Replacing the plug is about 10 - 20 minute job.  Depends on how long it
takes to remove the old one.  Especially if the head breaks off in your
hand. :( !!  I'd just replace it and do the bleed on the weekend.

Cheers!

Steven
