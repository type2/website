The things you see!

Just got into work.  We have some contractors in doing renovation work on one
of the buildings.  And what do I see in the contractors carpark this morning
- a 56 single cab.  Had a good walk around/peek under it  and it's
*rust-free*!  A little bit of rust in the bottom of the gates and that's
about it! And somebodies using it as their daily work truck! (looks like a
plumber).  Is this where you slip a note under the windscreen making a cheeky
offer?
