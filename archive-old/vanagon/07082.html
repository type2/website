&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Regarding the late 70s fit:  The Porsche engine is taller than the Type 4 
pan-
&gt;&gt; cake, especially if you use a CIS engine.  On the Vanagon, all the extra 
&gt;&gt; height is within the bounds of the engine lid, so you need to modify an 
engine
&gt;&gt; lid, not the van.  The breadloafs either have no hatch over the engine (&quot;Gen-
&gt;&gt; tlemen, start your Sawzalls&quot;) or a hatch that I think may be too small.  So
&gt;&gt; you would need some bodywork on the back deck to get the extra inches of air-
&gt;&gt; space you need over the engine.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Your van's a little lighter and more aero than a Vanagon, tho': Could be hot!

&gt;
&gt;  The engine compartment on the 70's bus is tall enough to accomodate an 
&gt;  upright-fan VW engine (similar in dimensions to a 912 engine). Is the
&gt;  911 engine taller then the 912's?  The height of the rear &quot;deck&quot; in a 70's
&gt;  bus is taller than that of the Vanagon, but I don't know by how much. How
&gt;  much height clearance did you have to add to the Vanagon engine lid?

I've seen a 69 bus with a 911 engine and it fitted in easily with space to 
spare. There might be differences in cooling fans between different 911 
engines though. This bus had been clocked by another car at 110mph (way off 
the bus's speedo).
