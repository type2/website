Yep.  I will again do my best to encourage all of you VW Van freaques that
have to have a new van to seriously consider the EV [I just recently &quot;lost&quot;
a cohort at work that had driven VW vans longer than I - over 22 years - to
a Honda Oddity, I mean Odyssey!].  If nothing else, let's let VW know that
we don't want their definition of the &quot;van&quot; to become extinct due to the
proliferation of those ridiculous Mopar Minis and their ilk!  There are all
too few EVs and Synchro Westys out there, and way too many &quot;compromise&quot;
vehicles!

&gt; We couldn't be happier with our MV.

I was looking for an MV Weekender when I bought my GL.  VW's 800 number was
great at locating all the new EVs in the US.  Took them about a week to do
it.  Turned out that there were only 2 MV weekenders left, in Hawaii, and
they were both automatics, so I bought the GL.

&gt; We got ours during the dog
&gt; days of '93 after Consumer Reports scuttled the Yuppie market with their
&gt; typically biased (against VW) treatment of the EV and VW dealers were prac-
&gt; tically GIVING them away. By playing two dealers off against each other we
&gt; got our EV for $100. above dealer cost and got the GE Extended Warranty
&gt; thrown in at dealer's cost ($435.) as well. For once we got lucky.

We shouldn't feel so picked on:  One reason Consumer Reports didn't like the EV
is because its based on a van... Shit!  They didn't like the Miata because
it rode like a Sportscar... !!  They didn't like our Montero because it
looked and rode like a 4X4... !!  How do you win with these idiots!  Some
of the stuff about the EV was downright WRONG, making me wonder if they
just didn't have time to look at them thoroughly, and LIED.  They certainly
weren't objective.  One thing they said in particular was that it &quot;leaned
sharply&quot; in turning.  Folks, this is not, and never has been, true of VW
vans.  If anything, they DON'T LEAN ENOUGH before they just plain tip over
(which would take a lot with the EV).  Handles a lot better than any other
van I've ever driven (most that are out there).

&gt; EV Panel Vans ARE sold in Canada at very low prices. I saw one at work in
&gt; Montreal last week. Also, last fall I found a VW Dealer in Edmonton Alberta
&gt; advertising on the NET. Their Transporter Panel Van, apparently available
&gt; with a 2.4 litre 5-cylinder diesel engine, lists for $20,995 Canadian. That's
&gt; about $15,785. US. Don't know what one would need to do in order to bring
&gt; it into the States.

That's an awesome price!  [which makes me wonder, why does VW list the
basic van used to make the 95 camper at about 22K?  I figured it SHOULD be
around 16K.  If you add their 9K for the camper interior (cripes!) on top
of that, it still wouldn't be too expensive, and I'D be driving one today!
I doubt very much if you could import a diesel truck to use in California,
at least.  As far as the rest of the US???

Don't understand why VW doesn't bring the trucks back to the US.  People
are actually DRIVING those Japanese substitutes!
