Subject: RE: exhaust manifold leak fix?


&gt;I have a '62 t-bird that has an exhaust manifold leak do to the
&gt;gasket crumbling after 30 years.  What can I put in that crack
&gt;that will withstand the high 1,000 + temps.?  JB weld will only
&gt;go to 600degrees.  Help!!!


I had that problem on my '66 Mustang with the 289 V8, this time due to
headers that wouldn't sit flat. In your case, replacing the gasket is
one solution of course, but you've probably alrady consideed it.

Your FLAPS probably has some Exhaust Manifold Repair paste, from Qualco
or other similar company, for two or three bucks a tube. I used this on
my Mustang, and it hasn't let out a peep since. The tube comes on a carb,
which shows a guy putting it directly on an exhaust manifold. I got it
from Kragen here in California, aka Checker in the midwest.

I don't know if this stuff gets hard enough to make later seating
difficult, if you ever dotake the manifold off later to replace the gasket.
Might be tough getting this stuff off at that point. But it sure worked
for me, so far!
