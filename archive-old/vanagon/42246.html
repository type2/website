Subject: 69? beater in Toronto
Date: 16 May 1996 12:41:20 -0400

Hi guys,

I just moved into a new  apartment here in Toronto and one of the guys
upstairs has an old '69 (I think) camper (no poptop) parked out back. I only briefly
asked him about it- broke down last november and he hasn't moved it
since. It's been neglected, no doubt, but this fella's moving at the
end of the month so someone might be able to pick it up for pretty
cheap. 

If anyone it even mildly interested I'll go check it out (not that I
have a clue what to look for, but if you have some specific
questions...) 

BTW, anybody know what Peter's Garage on Robert St. off of College is 
like- people tell me they're the best VW mechanics in town. Anybody
have any experience with these folks? I've got an 85 Westy than needs
some attention....
