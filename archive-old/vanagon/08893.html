So Donald Baxter says:
&gt; &gt; A couple of days ago someone mentioned that hormones that might be 
&gt; &gt; eaten in treated turkeys revert to their &quot;component proteins&quot;. NO, 
&gt; &gt; NO, NO! These things do (sometimes) get chemically modified by the 
&gt; &gt; metabolism processes, but for the most part, they get pissed away - 
&gt; &gt; they're steroids, not proteins - that's how they do steroid drug 
&gt; &gt; testing on athletes, as the steroid (sometimes modified) comes out 
&gt; &gt; the other end.
&gt; 

Speaking of turkeys, A turkey baster (had to check the spelling on that
one ;) ) is great for getting a shot glass or less of oil into your cylinders
for like compression testing or if you plan on not driving your van for
a while.

And you were wondering what turkeys had in common with this list (besides its
members ;) ).
