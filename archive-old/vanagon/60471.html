Subject: Re: Eorovan Door latch stuck-Update plus synchro vanagon info

To all--sorry for the typos! An update: for those interested in this problem. 
The dealer says he can't fix it! He ordered a new latch ($70) and will try 
again, this time by trying to chisel off the mounting screws through the barely 
opened door. He THINKS this might cause some need for body repair! I believe the 
better way is to take off the inner door panel, which will probably need to be 
cut off, as the access to the mounting screws are on the edges, and can't be 
reached. This is preferable to me than doing body damage, which will probably be 
poorly repaired. Does anyone know of a good left door panel in gray for an EV? 
I'm sure the dealer price is at least $3-400. By taking off the opposite side 
first, maybe I can see if this will provide access to the affected area of the 
latch, at least that way if it can't be reached I won't have cut through the 
perfectly good door panel. 

As I am new to the list, please allow me any errors in etiquitte. I love synchro 
Vanagons, having had an 87 which with ALL the usual problems kept us going for 
115K miles before I sold it to buy the EV. If anyone is interested in my 
experiences with that car please post.  Most notably, I got VOA to pay for the 
SECOND redo of my motor due to failed cylinder head seals at 96K miles. I have 
all the documentation on how I did this if anyone is interested.

Prior the the VANAGON, we had a type 2, 1974, with over 140K when we sold it. It 
took my wife and I cross country and back on several occaisons, up and down the 
east coast and from LA to Colorado and back several times.  THOSE were the good 
old days.
 
I threaten to my wife that when I retire, I'm buying a SYNCHRO WESTY, and we 
will repeat the 10K oddessey we made in the summer of 1975, and then some!
