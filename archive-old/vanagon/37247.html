Subject: Can I field-tune a 34 PICT-3?
Date: Sun, 10 Mar 1996 16:14:21 -0600 (CST)


 Guys, is there any way I earball this carb? My utterly reliable Honda 
 decided to snap a timing belt, and I need this bus on the road today.
 
 I don't have a vacuum guage or an oxygen sensor. The bus runs but it has 
 abundant flat spots and backfires on deceleration. I have on it a fairly 
 new Brazilian Solex (ran for only a few months on one of my other buses, 
 but that bus was loaned out and I have no idea how screwed up the tuning is).
 
 How can I get this thing close?
