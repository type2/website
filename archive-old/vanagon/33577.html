Subject: Driving with Parking Brake on (fwd)


Several years back, When I was studying to become the unemployed Motor Vehicle
Mechanic that I am today, I worked for a Lincoln Mercury Dealership who would
in turn sponsor my training. Forgive me Volks Folks, but it was a good deal,
and at least I showed up in the Vanagon every morning.
One morning upon arriving, I was walking from the van toward the service dept.
and I passed a Mark VII that just reeked of, what I assumed to be, burnt
clutch.  Anyway, I went in and to the service writer to find out what I could
do (usually oil changes, and clean ups, I was the young new trainee guy), but
the service writer liked me (because I had complimented his Ghia on my first
day, even before I knew I'd be working for him) and so he gave me a set of
keys, and told me to take the Mark VII around the block and see if I can find
out what's wrong with it.  The owner had said that It had no acceleration, and
no power, but the engine sounded like it was running well.  I said &quot;It's a
slipping clutch, I could smell it on my way in&quot;.  It's good to impress service
writers, they think you might be smart enough to do somthing other than oil
changes.  So he says &quot;good, take it around the block to see, then into your
stall&quot;. (woah!  I was actually going to get to replace a clutch disk!  A real
job for once, No more pumping the brake pedal while someone else bleeds them)

So I go out to the car and put my foot to the clutch to start it up.  Ummm
maybe not, It's an automatic.  So Much for the slipping clutch idea, I don't
think I want to do a tranny disassembly, I start thinking, maybe I'm not ready
for such a big job... Can't I just change some oil?
Anyway, I start the thing up and listen to the engine, Sounds fine.  Release
the parking brake and put it into 1, drive it out to the road, runs perfectly.
Off of the red light I punch the throttle and it gives no indication of
hesitation, this could not be considered poor acceleration by anyone except the
occaisional 911 driver.  I slow it down and put it into 2, again nail the gas
and away we go. In drive it drives well, in OverDrive it drives well.  Back at
the Service parking lot, I reverse a ways and that's good too.
Okay, I'll take it inside, and probe around the exhaust pipe, maybe there's a
banana or somthing up there, and the pressure doesn't really get bad until
highway speed.  I put it in to my service bay and decided I could sniff around
to see if the smell was coming from the exhaust, or the belts or what.  I was
hoping it wasn't tranny related, because I wanted to be able to do the job
alone.
After sniffing around, it became obvious that the smell had been coming from
the rear wheels, Hmmm, draggin' shoes, I can adjust that.  I go to tell the
service writer, and in a few minutes, I get the go ahead to do the work.
YES!  :)
I lift the car up to working level, and am just about ready to pop the wheels
off and I notice that they are able to spin easily for wheels with dragging
shoes.  Then I notice the tyres, The rubber around the rims is all bumpy and
cracked, with a few bloating pimples.  I look at the other side, a little
cracked, but not as bad.  The front rubber is in great shape.  These rear
wheels had gotten damn hot, you don't suppose that the guy had driven here with
the parking brake on do you?

D'oh!!!

Oh well, We sold him two new tires, rear shoes, I learned to turn (lathe)
drums, and do the work.  But I did feel stupid about not catching on a bit
sooner.
