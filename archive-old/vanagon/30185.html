&gt;Subject: Help me get my front seats apart!

&gt;Hi all!  I got my big load of interior stuff from RMMW today
&gt;and started to work on putting in new seat cushions for the
&gt;front bucket seats of my '79 bus.  Can anyone tell me how to
&gt;take the seat apart (it's out of the bus already) and get the
&gt;vinyl off of the back and the seat without ripping it.  I'd
&gt;like to put the same vinyl back on the seat.  Thanks.

&gt;Ken - '79 bus and '79 Westy

I'm sitting here trying to picture '79 seats in my mind.
I've dealt with splitscreen seats a lot and remember my '73
seats not being much different, and my '84 seats are pretty
much the same as well.

Unless there is a major difference between '79 front seats
and other bus seats, the two halves bolt together with a
pivot bolt on each side and the vinyl is held in place by
sharp, bend-over tabs at the bottom.  In the splittie, the
bolt has a slot for a screw and is shaped to provide a
collar for the seat back to pivot on.  I think the Vanagon
bolt is covered with a plastic cover and has an allen head,
but the concept is the same.

For the upholstery, you should be able to pry the tabs up
and pull the hem (probably with wire or rod inside) free
from the tabs.  Once that is done, the vinyl covers slip
(tight fit) back off the top.  Make sure you work in a warm
place so the vinyl can stretch where necessary.

Does this mean I'm gonna have to get a bay window bus around
for reference?  Hmmm, there's an idea.
