Subject: Drive-in Nite 8/18/96



Here's the information on the VW Van Drive-in nite....

This Sunday, August 18, at the Rustic Drive-in in North Smithfield, RI - on 
Route 146 (about 20 minutes north of ProvidenceRI, about 5 minutes north of 
I-295 and 146 - if you are coming from Boston or Southern RI/CT)

The two films are Phenomenon shown at 8:15pm and House Arrest at 10:30. Both 
rated PG. The other screens are showing a combo of PG13/R films, and the 
concensus seemed to be wanting to see family type films.

We will meet at Majestic Honda on 146 North, just south of the Drive-in 
around 7:15 pm and then caravan over to the drive-in.

If you have any questions, etc., e-mail me.

See you there!

Ric
