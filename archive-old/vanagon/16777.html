Subject:  Radar Guns?

Why all this talk of radar guns? My 71 stock bus shouldn't be driven 65 or 70
anyway and since that is the speed limit in most places I suggest:
1) A seperate list for 71 and earlier stock busses that don't create jobs for
the Highway Patrol (or equiv.)
2) A special car registration credit for cars that can't really speed!
