Subject: Mr. Forhan, I've got a customer for you

My apologies to everyone else, but I didn't save the msg on the '85 Westy 
for sale this weekend only, and I don't have Mr. Forhan's e-mail address.

Mr. Forhan, please Email me (see .sig).  I mentioned this jokingly to my 
folks and they are seriously interested.  We are in DC and would like to 
look at the van tomorrow.
