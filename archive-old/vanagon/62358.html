As much as I hate to part with it, my 82 Westy Peewee has just become
too much for me to continue to fix, money wise.  So... I'm offering him
for sale.  Here's the rundown.

82 Westfalia Camper  119k approx.
Interior is in ok shape though could use new carpets.
All appliances work, except good old Dometic Referigerator won't work on
120v.  Go figure.
Engine runs but needs FI work. PO was second owner and didn't know
ANYTHING about any previous maintenance.  Since I'v had it (approx. 30k)
it has had regular oil changes (every 3k).  Tune up after 15k... will
need another when fixed.
Canvas is in ok shape but was on my list of things I wanted to replace.
Also, clutch cylinder (under the brake master cylinder) leaks. Another
project.  
Some exterior rust and a couple of dents on the drivers side aft of the
drivers door.
New muffler and tail pipe.
Replaced tranny with a used one 1 year ago.  Has approximately 85k on
it.
Also has a class 1 trailer hitch with female wiring receptacle.
Want $1K firm.

Here's the hook...
I live approximately 40 miles WSW of Lubbock, Texas and this would
definately would be a tow-away.

Any bites?  E-mail me.
Chaz
