&gt;&gt;Got a problem..		

me too.

&gt;&gt;There is an intermittent short in the engine electrical system that results
&gt;&gt;in 
&gt;&gt;a 
&gt;&gt;dramatic loss of power.  The condition lasts for 15 to 20 secs and
&gt;disappears
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;to again 	
&gt;&gt;reappear at irregular intevals.

i have a similar problem, im guessing that i should check the electrical
connections, but here is the symptoms..

occasionally the van will start &quot;bucking&quot; holding the pedal down has no
effect and the bus will buck and make slight popping noises, i already put
some fuel injector cleaner in and same thing happens, after awhile it will
go away. electrics im guessing, any ideas otherwise?

&gt;Problem is probably not ignition related.  Check the connections to the O2
&gt;sensor,  temp sensor, and all low voltage grounds.  See if you have a groung
&gt;wire connected at the base of the crankcase breather.  If so, move it to a
&gt;solid metal connection.  This wire is the reference ground for the O2 sensor
&gt;circuit.  Any voltage drop here renders the system in operable causing al
&gt;sorts of grief.  Also check that your O2 sensor is working properly.  It can
&gt;become intermittant and become affected by weather.  Especially if the sensor
&gt;heater is not working.
