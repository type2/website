Subject: Er:  Test walk and stuff...

Well, in my original post I went for a test drive and returned with a
smokin' hot driver's side front wheel.  I pondered bearing replacement or
brake caliper replacement.  I yanked the wheel off and whacked the caliper
with a hammer.  Aaaaahhhh.  Put the wheel back on, give 'er a good spin
and...wow, that's pretty smooth...no noise.  Guess it's not the bearings.  I
think after sitting for half a decade the caliper just decided to stick
where it was.

I spent about 40 minutes coaxing the brake pads out and now I'm wondering
what to do with the caliper.  After applying the brakes a few times I
finally got both pistons to move but now they won't go back in.  So, since
I'm a professional VW mechanic (well, maybe not, but I own some metric
stuff) I went to Wally Mart and bought a C-clamp.  I figured I could push
the pistons back in with that and then hit the brake pedal, get the pistons
stuck again, and use the C-clamp to push them back in, ad infinitum.  Anyone
got a better idea?  Am I going to need a new brake caliper after I do this?
Good think it's too dark (and cold) outside to try this now.  Maybe tomorrow
night.  Please stop me if this'll kill something...

Bob.
