&gt;So Ric: how long have you had this fetish for air-cooled engines, does
&gt;your wife know? Do you find yourself sneaking off at night to be alone
&gt;with your beloved bug? (I read somewhere that you skiied behind your VW
&gt;(is this true?) :) DC

How long??.....hmmmmm...howabout 25 years ago when I was given a
1957 bug which had a 65 engine and tranny installed, and its
beautiful polar silver paint was covered by a hideous 1958 VW
coral pink....

It was love at first sound....

Does my wife know?? Damn right she does...who do you think I dragged
to Wolfsburg with me this past January? Who pisses and moans about
the stacks of VW magazines/books located next to our bed...in our
kitchen...in our living room (for confirmation of this...ask
anyone who has visited my house...)? she does..

Who made me buy the '79 convertible?? She did...well actually
she wanted more &quot;seat&quot; time in my '56 and I wasn't about
to comply!!!

I don't really sneak off at night to be alone with my bug...but I 
have been known to take the LOOOOOOOOOOONNNNGGGGG way home
from time to time...on a nice sunny day...or a starry night
the 6 mile ride home from the University has taken me up
to 2.5 hrs!


Skiing behind a bug? Of course!!!

So, there you have it ....my sad, sad, story!!

Ric
