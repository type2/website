Subject: EV Sliding windows.

Here is another interesting problem I have had with the EV/MV.
I have sliding side windows on the EV.  Last spring when I bought it, the
passengers sliding door window latch fell off on my way out of the
dealerships yard. (what an omen!)

I have all the pieces for the latch, but after reviewing the latch there
apears to be no way of putting it back on without taking the sliding door
interior trim off and I'm not real shure that that will be enough to allow me
thread the screw back in from the bottom.

Any suggestions....???

Happy Holidays,
