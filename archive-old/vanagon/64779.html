&gt; Anybody else have this happen?

&gt; Where can you buy factory-grey-colored trim to repair these shrinking

Hello all,
        Wood Werks columbus,Ohio.614-575-2400, has plastic t-mouldings,
 I know of black,and possibly other colors,just pull out the old and
carefully hammer in the new. I'll check out sizes and colors available
and repost on tuesday or wednesday.Also I have an '87 Westy for sale.
very clean,and runs great.Many new parts,like Heads,cooling
hoses,stering box,w/ universal,tires upper ball joints,cvj's,wireing,and
a nifty third break light in the back windo that really makes Betty Boop
light up from the rear.
later friends,
Ed
