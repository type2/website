&gt; You hit the nail right on the head.  Although Vancouver is not known for
&gt; being rainy (he said sarcastically), ...   You have described the conditions
&gt; under which this happened and the exact reaction of the parking brake. It
&gt; rained last night and again this morning the brake was stuck on, although
&gt; not to the same degree as last time.   I will try your remedy and see what
&gt; happens.  I will let you know the outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Funnily enough my last vehicle was an 87 Acura.  The parking brake seized on
&gt; several occasions but the problem evolved much differently.  My wife thinks
&gt; I yank on the handle too hard.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again.

&gt; &gt;First, I'll start by telling you about your weather.  It was raining when you
&gt; &gt;parked the van and you drove through several puddles on that last drive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When this happens, rust can quickly build up on the inside of the drum and
&gt; &gt;bond the shoe to the drum.  I'm not certain if this affects other vehicles,
&gt; &gt;but it's happend to my 87 Syncro a couple of times.  This can happen
&gt; &gt;overnight, and a mild case can happen (where you feel the resistance and
&gt; &gt;then, THUNK, it unsticks) just during a day at work.  It certainly hasn't
&gt; &gt;happened to any other vehicle I've driven.  In order to prevent it, I ride
&gt; &gt;the brake just a bit before I park, hoping to heat up the drum enough to
&gt; &gt;eliminate as much water as possible before parking.  I can't say for sure
&gt; &gt;that this works, but I haven't had this happen since I've started doing this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Good luck,

&gt; &gt;&gt; My first problem with my Westy (91).  I went to leave the driveway today
&gt; &gt;and couldn't move a bit.  I determined one of the right rear wheel was
&gt; &gt;locked.  I jacked it up, pulled the wheel off and wacked the wheel with a
&gt; &gt;hammer a few times.  It's good as new for now but I am afraid it will
&gt; happen &gt;again.
&gt; &gt;  Can anyone suggest any preventative maintainance for this affliction?
&gt; &gt;
Kelly,
I have an even simpler solution to your parking brake problem-don't use
it. If you have a manual transmission, put it in low or reverse. Unless
you park on a steep hill or have a tired engine with very low
compression, the parking brake serves no real function. An automatic can
be parked in (what else) park. The cold winters in my part of the
country taught me to never use the p brake-they would very often freeze
on and required thawing with a propane torch. Not much fun at 20 below.
