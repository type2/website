Subject: Re: Pop Top Seal Deal - It's a Go (&amp; more info)

Hey Ron,
I am interested in also purchasing a seal.  How will I pay you or the
company.  My address is:
Jeff Layton
Campus Box 6954 Stetson University
De Land, FL   32720

I have a 1989 Westfalia.

Thanks a lot.

&gt; I got more than enough list response from the $35.50 poptop seal offer to 
&gt; go ahead with it.  If anybody else wants them, let me know.  I will 
&gt; probably order them Monday, so there's still a little time.  
&gt; 
&gt; Again, this is the complete set of seals for the Westfalia poptop, 
&gt; including both the pop-up and luggage rack sections. Just to repeat, since 
&gt; a couple of people asked, the seals cover the three sides where the top 
&gt; meets the side of the Westy.  The top seal (that goes horizontally across 
&gt; the roof) is NOT included (although that seal rarely goes bad anyway). 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you e-mail me, please include the year of your Westy, and your ZIP 
&gt; code (so I can let you know shipping costs).
