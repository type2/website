Yes the TD and the regular heads are apparently quite different. The Part
Place catalog lists some of the differences.

Here is a (maybe dumb) idea:

Get a warped head cheap/free.
Carefully tap out one of the precombustion chamber insert with a drift.
Check dimensions.
If a fit, heat your head, freeze the insert. Drop insert into head.

Now Bentley explicitly says that VW does not sell the inserts. There
may be a reason for that. On the other hand a head without an insert is
pretty much worthless anyway, and this if it works saves the $3-400
for a rebuilt TD head.
