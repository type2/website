Subject: EV Chain Manuals....


I spent an hour at the dean's copy machine copying about 2/3s of the
electrical system manual (approx 300 pages!!)....

During the past few days I've received numerous responses to the
&quot;Chain Manual&quot; posting. A couple of you haven't given me smail
addresses....so make sure I have a place where the USPS can find
you.,


I think what I am going to do is to make my list...check it twice...
and where I have almost an equal number of requests for manuals and
an equal number of sections, I'll send a copy of a particular
section to each person...it will be that person's responsibility
to then send it to the next person on the list, etc..etc...

I would appreciate the first person who receives the copy set
to send me $$$ for postage....and the last person on the list
to send me back the original, so I can archive it and send it on
to any EVNewbies (tm)...
