Subject: Odd plate?

Hi, it's me, the other wanabus.
Anyway, I just came in from looking at a near perfect '86 Westie. I saw 
what I thought was an oddity on the motor though.
To the left of the distributor was a flat plate with 2 bolts holding it 
in place. It looked very out of place there and I'm wondering what goes 
there normally.
Please help, I think I'm gonna buy this one if this is of no consequence.


Thanks all,
