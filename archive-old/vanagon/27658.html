Subject: Early Bus Window: Reassembly Part I
Date: Sat, 28 Oct 1995 14:59:36 -0700 (PDT)


Last night I wet-sanded a couple of pieces of the window frames and
shot another coat of paint on them to make them all pretty.

This morning I decided to tackle the job of putting the windows back
together.

The first problem I discovered was the the paint on the swoopy things had
lifted, again.  I prolly should have sanded, and then let them dry for a
day (I exposed some fresh paint underneath - put too much on to start wit)
before I messed with them.  How important are these things, anyway?

Last night I installed the vent wing-to-frame rubber on 1 frame.  What a 
pain!  A couple nights before, I'd installed the piece that goes all the
way around the outside, which was also difficult.  It didn't want to
slide much even with copious amounts of dish soap.

So, this morning, I started glueing the felt chanels in, and ran into
ugly discover #487:  The lower felt chanels were meant for later windows,
and not my early ones.  The early sliding windows do not have a hole drilled
in the glass, and have a metal piece they fit into, and its the metal
piece that does all the sliding.  The later chanels are not wide enuf to
take the metal piece, so for the time being I am going to have to use
the later glass, until I can find the proper rubber.

I then went to install the vent wing frames.  I had to re-rivet these at
the top to the frame.  I have to drill one of them out now because I should
have put a backing washer on it and didn't.  I also scratched one of the
frames with the rivet gun. &amp;*(_at_&amp;*(_at_#$&amp;*$

I think I'll go ahead and disassemble the old frame and get the glass off and
clean it, so I can reassemble these and put them in tomorrow.

Well, back to work!
