Yesterday Bruno, the 65 Campmobile, was pulled from the driveway where it
had sat for 8 years (thanks to Doug and Mike for their help).  A flatbed was
called and it was delivered to my driveway. :)

Upon arrival an effort was made to remove leaves and dirt from around Bruno.
 This stopped as soon as we pried the engine compartment door off.  The view
was not pretty: rear engine seal metal rusted out, battery hanging by its
wires, bumper mounts gone, bumper rusted beyond repair and the muffler was
being used as a rodents home.  This portion of Bruno was closest to the
slope of the driveway and had been buried in dirt and leaves.  Any attempt
to get the wheels spinning was abandoned and we decided to yank him out.  
   
Rust

Getting Bruno up the incline was accomplished using a 95 Trooper 4WD with
nylon tow ropes wrapped around the big nuts on each rear wheel.  All 4 tires
were flat but the leaves and dirt provided a slippery enough surface for the
Trooper to pull him up and out to street level (burning clutch permeated the
air).

                                           Rust

We then inflated the tires and the 2 front tires held air but the rear tires
had major leaks around the seal.  Using a compressor and air tools borrowed
from my cousin, we then tried to remove the rear wheel lug nuts but quickly
found that it would take more time and tools than what we had available.

                                                                            
           Rust

So Doug and Mike left, I called the towing company and they dragged him out
into the street and onto the flatbed.  At this point the front wheels were
turning with a terrible grinding sound but the rear would not budge.  

                                            Rust

Back home he was anchored to my 68 Westy and the flatbed poured him onto my
driveway.

Rust

Since there were two vehicles blocked by Bruno, I had to get his wheels off
the rear and put my 68 spare and his spare on the rear drums to get some
height under the chassis for floor jacks. Sounds easy, right?  I Wish!  Had
the compressor, and a hammer working overtime to loosen the rusted lug nuts.
 Wound up drilling out one lug nut and destroying one wheel in the process. 
Oh well, so it goes.  After I got four tires on with air I then used a floor
jack to move Bruno around, using a crossbeam just forward of the engine, and
tucked it off to the side.

Rust

There is so much wrong with Bruno I feel overwhelmed.  I think I'll start
removing the interior first to get a better idea about the extent of the
rust, did i mention the rust. :)  Then the engine......
Then...
