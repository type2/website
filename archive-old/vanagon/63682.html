Subject: bus

hello
  I was in panama city beach, FL last week and saw a sweet looking cherry red
bus. It was a third or fourth gen. i think but i don't know what year.  It
was parked in the burgerking parking lot at the holiday inn. i saaw a few
rust spots. they were asking 2400 for it. I did not get to really check it
out though b/c i saw it the first day and was planning to call the owner and
come back to really check it out but it was not there the next day.  I also
lost the number of the owner. Is there anyone in the area of the bus or that
knows the owner of the bus. I would really appreciate it if someone could
find the number of the owner for me. I live in North GA so going back to
panama to look for it if it is already sold would be a big bummer.  I
thankyou all in advance.  Also if you would like to give me anymore info on
it if you see it. Like if i should not bother going to check out the
condition of  motor, etc. because is not worth it i would be indebted to you.

smiles and hugs 
jessica
