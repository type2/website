Hi Tobin -

Can't say myself which color goes where and stuff, but the seals are
different sized for the head and engine case. (oops - dunno which is which
here as I sit at home, I'm not at the shop).  Anywhooo, I'm not a fan of OE
made seals as they just don't seem to last very long, especially in hot
Redding (or formerly So Cal) summers.  I've been privately making VITON Seals
that are far superior to factory ones since the early 80s that I sell by the
thousands to the major FLAPS suppliers (WAWD, IMC, NAPA, Beck/Arnley, etc.)
under the &quot;Old Volks Home&quot; banner and retail/minor wholesale through Bus
Boys.  Set of 16 Seals is $16.00 (Our PN 021-198-345AV).  Fits all Type 4
Based Engines.  I've had a set on my current 80 Wanagon for about 2 years and
35K since the last major engine work.

My .005 cents worth :)
