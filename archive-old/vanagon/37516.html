Thomas,

Thanks for backing me up, I let that one slip by.  I use ball bearings.  I
knew Eddie wouldn't have any ball bearings, figured a mable would do as
well... except I forgot to mention the obvious :-)

Unfortunately, calculating the volume of a small sphere calls for an accurate
micrometer or caliper.  Instead of calculating the volume it's easier to
measure it directly using the syringe.  

Remove the plunger.  With your thumb over the outlet, fill the syringe about
half way.  Twiddle your thumb until the thing is level at some line.  Make a
note of the volume.  Now drop in the marble.  Make another note.  Subtract
the first from the second.  The difference is the volume of your marble.

You may now shout 'Eureka!' if you wish.

-Bob
