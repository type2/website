&gt; ok, folks. there are ENTIRELY TOO MANY Unknowns out there!!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; all i want to know is what model bus you drive/own/sleep in (and the year)
&gt; and where (country/city/state/province) you are in (or reasonably close to)
&gt;


Well, no private email address found, so I guess it's spam time.

Don't know what category your put me into. I have a '71 Transporter. 
Fixed metal roof, seats eight (only one-piece-windshield I've ever seen
that has an all-the-way-across front seat that seats three. All others
have been step-thru), I live in San Diego, and when some idiot is tailgating
me in the right lane (&quot;slow&quot; lane, remember?) I tend to wait a little
longer between letting out the clutch and hitting the gas. Drives them nuts!
