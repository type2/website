Subject:      Emmissions help.

Hi all,

My '86 Westfalia has failed the CT emmisissions test (for high hydrocarbons and
CO), and the VW service station I took it to couldnt find an easy fix (short of
replacing the mass air flow sensor - or new fuel injectors - mucho $$$$$$).

Anyway, they recommended I get some &quot;Emmissions Cure&quot;, pour it into the gas
tank, drive it for a while, and then take it right in to be tested.

Does anyone have any experience or suggestions, ie - how far should I drive the
van, and do I need to run the stuff out + refill the tank before I get it
tested.  Also - any other experience with possible reasons why I failed
emmissions?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot!

Jamie
