Subject: Seattle Spot Bus Census

Hello everyone,
	Since I started reading this list, about 4 months ago I have 
become very interested in VW Busses.  Like others on this list have 
started craving multiple busses.  As part of my budding addition, I have 
started improving my bus identifications skills. I decided to do a spot 
census on my daily commute, 3 miles on a bike from the U of W to Phinney 
Ridge.  On average I see about 21 VW busses, 2/3 of which are bay 
windows, and the rest are Vanagons.  I average less than one EV, and less 
than one Splitty.  BTW not one for sale sign. 
	This is probably not a good average for Seattle as a whole, I 
probably live in a high bus area, inter city middle class neighborhood 
near a university.

	Thank You.
