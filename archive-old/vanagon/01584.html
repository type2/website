&gt; As if there weren't enough horror stories about mechanics working on 
&gt; your car. . .I was sitting around last night talking to a friend who 
&gt; used to work in a transmission shop when he was in high-school.  He 
&gt; said that the owner told him to tighten everything within a half turn 
&gt; of breaking the bolt.  I asked if they didn't use or own torque 
&gt; wrenches.  He just laughed kinda sick like.

This is what gets me.  What are they thinking?  Do they think that this
is going to give them repeat business or are they just doing this out
of anger or revenge.  What's really frustrating is that people that don't
know how to work on cars know for a fact that they are being ripped off
but do not know what to do about it.  The best I can tell them is to
keep looking for mechanics that will work on your car right.  I know
my mom gets really ripped off every time.  Show owns a Caddy and goes
to the dealer.  What can I say?  I offer to take the car in for her,
but she just doesn't want to do that at all.  :(
