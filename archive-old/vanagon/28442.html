&gt;&gt;&gt;  I am new
&gt;&gt;&gt;to my area so I asked at the local import Parts store where to get a good
&gt;&gt;&gt;alignment at a reasonable price. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm over in St. Louis (not TOO far from Carbondale), and I've had great
&gt;&gt;service from a Firestone dealer.  I'm always charged the same rate as
&gt;&gt;everyone else, they have great equipment, and they always do a great job.
&gt;&gt; They actually like to see me come in, because they can align both the front
&gt;&gt;and rear, which makes it easier for them (so they say, anyway).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Good luck!

&gt;I've had similar luck at my local Les Schwabb.  When we got our bus it
&gt;wasn't fun to drive on bridge decks or grooved pavement, crosswinds, past
&gt;trucks, you know...
&gt;
&gt;  The 4 wheel alignment was $24.00, and the guy showed me the numbers and
&gt;said the he loved working on it because it was the most &quot;alignable&quot; car he'd
&gt;worked on.  Apparently he wasn't kidding because it goes straight down the
&gt;worst of roads hands off.  We've put over 50,000 miles on those tires and
&gt;they still look new.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
Thanx Cliff... I did take the Super to the local goodyear place and got the
alignment for $25.  They treated me as a human and not some kind of idiot or
freak because I own/drive an air-cooled VW.
