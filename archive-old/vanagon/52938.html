Subject: Re: Vanagon sighted in Germany

&gt; On German roads near Dusseldorf I sighted a light-blue Westy
&gt; with a Vanagon emblem on the rear hatch. The plates says
&gt; MYK-?? ??? which is in the middle west section of Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a turbocharged Diesel and as I know the real Vanagons,
&gt; this is a simple emblem mismatch. The driver visited the US,
&gt; I'm sure.
&gt; 
Ahh!  That must be the TD Vanagon I special ordered from VW! Please 
have it sent over asap, since it obviously belongs here. Charge it to VW Canada!
!  

;)))
