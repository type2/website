Definition - &quot;Mission Dollar Highway&quot;  - what you think of when travelling on
a rock ledge that passes for a road  700' to 1200' above the vertical drop
off immediately beside you, with no guard rails.  When it was built it
apparently cost some one a &quot;Million&quot; dollars = &quot;Million Dollar Highway&quot;.  I
love to travel and this is the most fabulous 1 days drive i have ever done -
did it on New Years day in 95 - little snow (lucky) -  incredddible.  Had to
replace the wifes arm rest the following day.  Had a 87&gt;syncro&lt;GL with
studded snow tires on.
