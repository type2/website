Wouldn't the ads, and the phone numbers in the ads, be copyrighted also? 
Seems to me that NEATO published proprietary VW information.  Otherwise, for
anyone to publish any M-code should be public.  They aren't the same as Tech
articles, or any stories.  It wasn't a photocopy either. 
Of course I'm no lawyer, thank god (sorry Ric). 

What I'm getting at is that the M-codes are like engine codes.  It is 
information that has already been disseminated.  I hope Bosch doesn't 
take down the site with FI info just because it has part numbers and 
interchange references.
