Hi Y'all,

Just curious...is there a formal cutoff year between what is considered 
'early' vs. 'late'?  Often in manuals and posts I see things like: 'In 
early models' do this, use that ,etc. with no reference to the year.

Sorry if this has been covered recently, I haven't checked the archives.

TIA, 

Mitch
