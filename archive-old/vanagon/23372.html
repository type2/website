Subject: Bumper Fasteners

	Hi :
Using little thought, I disassembled the bumpers on my '72 Bus for
sandblasting and repainting, and I've lost track of which bolts, etc I
need. Most I planned to replace anyway due to corrosion - one or two will
need to be tapped out. Does anyone have, or know where I can get, specs on
the fasteners for complete reassembly? Any help is appreciated!
