Kevin,

It sounds as if you've blown a seal.  I can't tell if it's the tranny seal
(10%) or the engine seal (90%) but the repair -- which must be done as soon
as possible -- calls for you to drop the engine and replace the seal.
 Neither seal is expensive and they are available by mail order if you're out
in the woods someplace.

If you've never dropped your engine before, come on over to the vanagon list
(vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu, use the normal list-servor protocol for
subscribing [ask if you need to]) where someone will be happy to lead you
through it.  If you've access to the web, pop up to
http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/ where you will find a list of 'sermons,' some
of which cover removing an engine, replacing seals, why the sky is blue and
if the Dodgers really think they have a chance against the Chargers.

Blowing a seal may or may not be a symptom of more serious problems.  Right
now, you need to replace the seal and the clutch disk --  once the disk is
contaminated with oil there's no effective cure.  And removing the clutch
disk is part of removing the flywheel, which is necessary to replace the
engine seal.  If it's the tranny seal the repair is a no-brainer, but you
still need to replace the clutch disk.  Oily is bad, in bell housings.

If it's the engine seal you will need some unusual tools.  One is a piece of
pipe about five feet long.  Another is a piece of 2&quot; angle iron the same
length.  A third is a bathroom scale.  (I'll pull it all together in Chapter
Three - trust me.)  You will also need a 3/4&quot; drive socket that fits the
humungous nut holding on the Volkswagen flywheel.  I know -- modern cars use
five or six small bolts for this job.  The engine in your bus was designed in
the early 1930's; they did things differently back then.  So start checking
around.  You can usually rent such tools.  If you plan on maintaining your
bus yourself you may wish to buy them -- a $50 will get a complete 3/4&quot; drive
socket set delivered to your door from Harbor Freight.  If you want their
phone #, ask.  And no, I don't own the company.  Whatever you do, don't walk
into an auto-parts store and say &quot;Gimme a breaker bar and a 36mm socket.&quot;
 You'll have to float a loan, they're so expensive.

The size of the socket you'll need is 1-7/16&quot; for Earth-people, 36mm for all
others.  You'll need a breaker bar to turn the socket.  Not a flex handle or
a ratchet but an honest breaker bar.  The mysterious piece of pipe must have
an interior diameter large enough to fit over the handle of  the breaker bar.
 You will need the additional leverage to loosen the nut -- and to torque it
to the proper value after replacing the seal.  The five foot long piece of
angle iron is euphamistically called an 'Anti-torque tool' in the Volkswagen
manual covering 'Locally Fabricated Tools &amp; Fixtures&quot;  You will need to drill
two holes in it, spaced to match two of the bolts holding on your pressure
plate, the thing the clutch-disk is hiding under, and large enough to accept
the bolts.  5/16&quot; is about right but check it out.  With the anti-torquing
tool bolted to the flywheel -- and you standing on it, if you slide the pipe
(appropriately called a 'cheater') over the handle of the breaker bar you'll
have enough leverage to loosen the flywheel gland nut, which is torqued to
over 200 ft/lbs.  Siddle out a little farther if it doesn't come loose.  If
you use the whole five foot length you can flip the Titanic across the room.

Putting the thing back on is equally simple, except this time you stand on a
bathroom scale and push down.  If you grip the breaker-bar/cheater four feet
from the end and press down until your weight is REDUCED by fifty pounds, you
will have torqued the nut to precisely 204.361 ft/lbs, which is as God
intended and all will be will, my son.

However, to further raise your brows I'm afraid there is another task for you
to do before you can replace your engine seal.  You must find out if your
engine is playing too much.  (It will be.  71's are notorious for it.)  When
the engine was assembled a stack of three thin metal washers called 'end play
shims' was installed over the end of  the crankshaft before the flywheel was
bolted on.  They press against the thrust-face of the #1 crankshaft bearing
(which is sealed by the seal, now unsealed and dribbling and the reason we
are here), and the thrust face of the flywheel.  Each time you depress the
clutch you push against the spinning engine with a force of over 500 ft/lbs.
 Imagine what you would do if someone weighing 500 pounds stepped on YOU?
 Your engine does exactly the same thing.  In time, all of those pushes wears
down the end-play shims, or the bearing, which is softer, or the flywheel,
which is the hardest thing of all.  Your job, as an honorable veedub owner,
is to restore the engine's end-play to about three thousandths of an inch
from the ridiculous gap it had worn to, and which may have cause your seal to
pop.  Don't do it and life will still go on, as will your engine.  But not as
long.  And you'll probably blow another seal.

Okay, all of that sounds do-able.  The catch is, you're dealing with THREE
shims and a tolerance of only a couple thousandths of an inch.  The proper
tool is a dial indicator, a nifty machinist's gizmo (they call them 'clocks'
-- I'll let you figure out why) that will measure your engine's end-play to
within a gnat's ass, or 1/1000ths of an inch, which ever comes first.  A
cheap clock costs about $15 bucks, a good one about $100.  Cheap is okay for
end-players.  Knowing what the end play IS, and knowing what it SHOULD BE,
you subtract the one from the other, hie yourself down to the Volkswagen
dealer and say &quot;Please sir, I would like an end-play shim stack that's xxx
thousands of an inch high.&quot;

When he stops laughing, give him the greasy scrap of paper on which you've
noted your end-play readings.  After he tells all the guys and they all get a
big laugh and look in the door to see if you're real, the parts guy will make
you up the proper shim stack and charge you about three bucks.  Cheep.  He'll
also sell you anything you want, except Alice.

There's a few minor points I may have dashed passed but we can save them for
another time since you're eyes are already starting to roll and you're not
too sure if this is a joke or a bad hair day or what.  

It is an Or What.  And you've GOT to replace a seal.  I hope it's the tranny
(smell the oil.  Thick and sulphury?  Sounds like tranny juice to me.  Crawl
under, take out the side-plug and give it the finger.  Low?  Probably the
tranny seal.  Lucky devil!  Now you don't have to fool with adjusting your
end-play.  Mebbe next time.)

There are books that will tell you all this stuff.  But the first one you
should read -- John Muir's &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive! - A Guide for
the Compleate Idiot&quot; contains some dangerous errors.  And some dangerously
good drawings.  (Nude cars!)  You can't afford the factory manual for you bus
so don't ask.  (Alright!  Robert Benchley Publications.  But you'll be
sorry.)  I don't know if Haynes Publications has a manual for your bus; ask
the Vanagon list -- they know everything.  Don't waste your time on the
Chilton manuals -- one of  their air-cooled VW books contains a long section
on anti-freeze, forcrysakes!  If you speak English or other foriegn
languages, there are some books from England that are good.  But you got to
watch those Limeys.  (They put bonnets on their cars.)

You need a book.  A book always impresses your friends.  Walk around with a
book, smoke a pipe, you can pick up babes who take bathes and wear clean
clothes.  Get a book.  But this is fun, too.
