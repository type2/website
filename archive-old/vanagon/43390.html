Subject: Re: Bus wheel colors

wheels and bumpers were painted white.   Unfortunately, i cannot right now
say what exact white for which year.  off hand i'll say the white used as
white for that year. ( for some silly reason it is not listed in the Parts
List)   :(   this is except for the pressed early (through 58) bumpers, which
were two tone.  um, i'll have to check for the two tone buses, but the others
had the bus color on the whole thing, then white painted over it on the
raised bits.  wait, hold that, as the 53's rims (yes - 5 original rims) were
painted thedarker (upper) colour  of the bus. 

curiously, until 62 the lower colour was painted first, then the upper on top
of it.  this gave the dash the tone of the lower half of the bus.  later the
upper colour was applied first, then the lower.    white dash city.  this
also determined the colour on the door edges around the panels.

commericial vehicles had painted (grey) hubcaps,  passenger vehicles came
with chrome ones.

the vee wee symbol was painted the colour of the top half, with the line
between vee and wee painted in by hand the colour of the lower half.

ack, better stop.  I will find out more for the mango green/seagull grey type
