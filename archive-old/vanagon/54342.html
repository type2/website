Subject: $20.00 Syncro Air Filters!

Listees,

  Many different people have e-mailed me on these filters.  There have 
been Many different questions on the difference too!  The Archives have 
a wealth of Info on these filters.

  Just to reiderate on these;  OEM Syncro style air filters, (Metal 
Housing) normally sold in the range of $70.00 in the states.  I'm told a 
person can and will pay up to $145.00 in Canada!

  I'm posting to let the people know that Did e-mail me and I might not 
have given a complete response too that these fiters ARE VW fiters and I 
had 60 of them and I'm not trying to gouge anybody on these filters, 
just passing on a Graet deal I've come across and sharing the wealth 
too!

  Anybody wanting one or more of these e-mail me and let me know.

  Kyle
