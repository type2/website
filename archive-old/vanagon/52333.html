The bikie folks have dealt with air pumps in great detail.  First you need a 
pump suitable for the task.  If you need to set the bead on a tubeless tire
you'll need to go to ~60+ pounds depending on the tire.  A good bicycle pump
will do that.   Then you'll need to push a lot of air, read high volume, so 
you don't spend your vacation expiring along some desert road pumping up a 
ten liter tire with a 10cc pump.  These things considered, try a regular
steel barrelled bicycle pump (floor model) with say a 1.5inch barrel.

Silca $$$ makes a good one.  YFLBS (yer friendly local bicycle shop) carries
less expensive ones too.  Keep the leather cup oiled and pliable and it'll 
last longer than your tires.

Or you could try the famous seven strokes to 125psi concentric dual chamber
track tire pump hand made in the Hewlett Packard model shop in the early 
seventies of polished stainless.  Several still exist, none are for sale,
the original cost was in excess of..m;'alskv.?
