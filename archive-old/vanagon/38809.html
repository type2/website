Subject:  '84 parts - thanks

thanks for the info, i called &quot;Parts Place&quot; and they were out at present...
shipping from Michigan will probably kill me (i'm in the Yukon), but
$75US is the best price i've heard of yet...new, they (the locals) are asking
$360CAN or something...

parts from junkyards:
seems like you gotta be in the right place at the right time for parts of
'80s vans...up here i'm outta luck.
