Subject: 2nd Annual Meeting of VW Owners and Lovers

Hi folks! Today I was preparing my Westy to attend the 2nd Annual Meeting of
VW Owners and Lovers in Aibonito, up in the mountains of Puerto Rico. This
event is very peculiar because the VWs go there only for display, is not a
really a regular auto show. In this meeting the owners compete among them in
various events as trivias, hood races, sack races, jeans contests, pie contest
and others. Last year my Camper was the first bus to arrive the show and
because that I got a trophy. Here I met a lot of good friends and talk a lot11
about VWs!!! I'm a expecting a very nice show tomorrow and as soon I get home
I will make a report on the event. Here in Puerto Rico we have about six VW
shows per year, which the most important one is called VW Bug-In in Aguadilla
a town in West coast of Puerto Rico. The group of VW enthusiasts (or better
called VW freaks) is growing and growing day by day. I hope to see one day
many of you guys visiting our paradise of VWs in the Caribbean. 
Talk to you later.
