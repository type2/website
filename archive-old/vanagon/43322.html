Subject: Re: A bug squashed on a bus....

The book I saw the Bug squashed on the Bus was
VW bus Custom Handbook
by Laurence Merideth
 isbn (almost said isdn) is 
1870979478

It was written and publish in Britain- could be an import.
I picked it up from a store in Columbus, Ohio- only copy they
had, sorry. If anyone is interested, I can scan the bus/bug
photo and make arrangements for them to view it (with
proper crediting, of course).
