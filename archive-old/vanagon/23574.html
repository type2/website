&gt; &gt; At lower engine revs the turning of the alternator isn't enough to power 
&gt; &gt; all added equipment.  Suspect that the speed of the engine affects what 
&gt; &gt; percentage of the energy consumed by the alternator is elctrical and what 
&gt; &gt; is mechanical.
&gt; 
&gt; I estimate the mechanical load the alternator places on the engine (i.e.
&gt; friction in the bearings and inertia during acceleration/deceleration),
&gt; to be around 1/127th of a horsepower, on average.  :)

I guess that I'm misunderstanding the terminology here...but isn't 
an alternator just a power conversion device?  It's taking the mechanical
energy from the engine and converting it to electrical energy, therefor
the mechanical load placed on the engine is NOT just the mechanical losses
in the alternator, but equals :

Mechanical losses of alternator + electrical energy produced by alternator +
electrical losses (current^2*resistance) losses

All three of these combine to create the load that the engine feels.
However, if there is any signicant electrical load on the alternator,
the mechanical losses are almost negligible in comparison though they are
still there.
