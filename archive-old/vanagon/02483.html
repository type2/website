&gt; &gt;OBtravel.anecdote: When I visited the folks this weekend I paced an
&gt; &gt;unmarked police car for 2 hours at 75mph. Looks like I'm not the only 
&gt; &gt;one that spits on the &quot;Basic Speed Law of the Commonwealth of PA&quot;...
&gt; 
&gt; I read in a recent ca.driving thread that you can pace a police car from
&gt; behind for as fast and as long as s/he is in FRONT of you;  apparently
&gt; they can only ticket you from behind.

Ah, the reason that I mentioned is that the state law specifies that a
police vehicle in this state cannot only legally travel at that speed if
its emergency lights are on. They were not. So, the state trooper in
question was as much in violation of the law as I was.  I was tempted to
pull him over and attempt a &quot;citizen's arrest&quot; but that is really pushing
my luck. :)

&gt; Judging by our recent thread on the Type II speed demons, some of us
&gt; might want to teach the kids/pets how to spot those cars/planes.

&quot;Officer, you must be mistaken. Do you really think this van can go 80mph?&quot;

I got a warning instead of a ticket that way in a '78 Westfalia. :)
