&gt; Dave Kautz, says this is a no-brainer, well I guess I qualify. Will stick
&gt; those paper towels around and report back Monday. DC
&gt; 
&gt; 
  I didn't mean to offend. What I mean is there are only so many places it 
  can leak when it's not being pressurized. Patience and the &quot;paper-towel-
  wrap should reveal all.        

  Apologies,

  Dave Kautz
