Subject:      keeping your drinks cool/hot ...


and now, for something completely different ...

Trailer Life Magazine, November 1994, page 72.
Product Evalution:     Comtrad Thermafrost
   by Ken Freund

If you're like me, you enjoy getting on the road early to cover some
serious miles before stopping.  But life isn't worth living without
a hot cup of java in the morning or a cool drink on a sweltering
afternoon.

Until now, this meant pulling over to make hot coffee or prepare a cold
drink then rummaging through the trailer to find a vacuum bottle,
stopping at a roadside cafe, or going without that favorite beverage.
We recently tried a new product called Thermafrost from Comtrad
Industries that promises to change all that.

Thermafrost is a compact heating and cooling device that's designed to
hold two containers of beverages in the passenger compartment.  Using
technology derived from the space program, Thermafrost is heated and
cooled by a tiny thermoelectric module that replaces the bulky coils
and compressors found in conventional refrigeration devices.  The only
moving part is a quiet fan that circulates air through the rear of the
high-tech unit.

Its compact size, at roughly 6x6x6 inches, allows it to fit easily into
most cockpits.  Installation consists of simply drilling two small holes
and screwing the mounting bracket to any convenient surface, although
the unit can be used without installing it.  An optional floor-mounting
bracket is also available that is similar to a cellular-phone mount.
The 4-foot-long power cord is protected by a 5-amp fuse.

TESTING
Thermafrost is designed to operate from a cigarette-lighter socket (or
power point in late-model vehicles) on 12 volts DC.  We found that it
draws close to 5 amps of current during both hot and cold operation;
the manufacturer rates it at 4.5 amps.

We put two beverages in the Thermafrost and tried both the heating and
the cooling modes.  A slide switch on the top of the unit allows the
user to select HOT or COLD, and a red or green LED indicates the
respective mode selected.  An aluminum 12-ounce can filled with water
was placed in one position, and the optional aluminum beverage container
which was also filled with 12 ounces of water, was placed in the other.

In the cooling mode, starting at an ambient temperature of 75 degrees F,
the interior of the Thermafrost beverage holder quickly became cool to
the touch.  Within an hour, both drinks were cool enough to drink. After
about two hours, the water was down to 46 degrees F, and the temperature
slowly continued to drop afterward, finally leveling off at 44.7 degrees
F.  Although this isn't exactly instant, keep in mind that it takes time
for drinks to cool in refrigerators, too.  Cooling just one beverage
should take considerably less time.  With those that are already cold,
Thermafrost should be able to keep them cold for as long as you want.

In the heating mode, the Thermafrost unit brought two containers from
room temperature to a peak of 116 degrees F in about an hour.  Again,
if the beverages are already hot to begin with, Thermafrost should
have no problem keeping them that way.

SUMMARY
We found the beverage cooler/heater unit to be convenient, easy to use
and a welcome addition in the cab.  Thermafrost is available for $69
pluse $8 shipping and handling.  The optional beverage container costs
$9 plus $2 for shipping.  (Virginia residents must add 4.5 percent sales
tax.)

Comtrad products are covered by a 30-day, &quot;no-questions-asked&quot; money-
back guarantee.  Thermafrost also comes with a 90-day manufacturer's
limited warranty.  Orders may be placed 24 hours a day on the toll-free
line.
