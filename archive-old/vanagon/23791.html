Hi jonathan,

I ordered [and paid for] a junk CV axle for my 77 Bus, got an
apparently remanufactured one with new grease and new boots, and
am pretty happy with for some 15.000m now. 
Couple of weeks ago I ordered the rear brake shoes from them, 
since cheaper than at the Busstop, and, except for the wrong
axle tool, got what I wanted. 
  They also have a SummerFest with everything seriously off. 
Happened to happen last year shortly after some _at_#$%^&amp;* thought 
he needed the luggage off the rear bed and busted my rear window. 
Driving to Auburn Hills on my way to NY/VA/FL, I found a new 
window for $10 and another happy fella to help me put it in. 
He drove all the way from Minneapolis to get the discount and 
save shipping on an order of Rabbit parts.
  I'd buy again there. Jens.
