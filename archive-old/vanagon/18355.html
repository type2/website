Subject: Update on the `72&amp;`74 busses-EFI ??'s

  Well, going over the nonexistant paperwork, (which wasn't anywhere
near as detailed as I was led to believe!) I have discovered some
good/bad things--
 The `72 standard was driven regularly up to `94, (so hasn't been
sitting as long as I was ltb!) and the motor does turn over, but
I'm still going to drain the tank/add new. The wiring has been
`modified' by some idiot with wire cutters and a Bentley, (and
NO CLUE!) and doesn't work that great. Should be no problem to
fix.
 The `74 camper might have been driven as lately as `90-91, (when
it was last registered.) The DPO did say he drove it this winter,
but I'm pretty skeptical. gas in the tank is still good/crud-free
after a short draining, so he may be telling the truth. The wiring
was also overmodified by the same idiot. This is actually a pretty
neat electrical setup with dual batteries (For the propane/12V
fridge?) and it was obviously a professional job. :)
   Anyway, is there anything special I need to do to `prime' the EFI
so I don't blow it up? I've heard rumors that if they run out of gas
you're pretty screwed. Should I just take the coil wire off, and crank
for a few minutes, put it on and pray, or ???? Push the FI off a cliff?
Put dual Dellorto's on? (I heard they stopped making them for VW's?)
Take the EFI off, and run a petcock valve straight off the fuel line to the
manifolds? (You know, 1/4 turn for city driving, 3/4 for highway?)
THAT WAS A JOKE. I would never do something like that. I DO know 
a person that did do that. (To a non-VW; *whew*!) It'll probably
take me a little while to redo the wiring on the `74, so I'm not going
to do much to it until I get some response about the EFI...Are there
any EFI gurus, or has everyone done the dual carb thing?
