In my infinite spare time I did the sticker protos and Steven mentioned that 
putting nifty line drawings of Splitties, Breadloafs and Bricks on the 
sticker might be nice.  If someone has the West Coast Metrics Catalog for 
aircooleds (like maybe Thom) I could get a couple of line drawings and include
em on the sticker.
