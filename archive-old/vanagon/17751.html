I have to agree with Norman and the other EV owners...our EV
is a great Van!! VW finally got a PROPER (sorry Vanagon types)
and Bullet Proof watercooled engine in their vans. The engine
is the 5 cylinder Audi unit which has been around since the
early 80s. It has plenty of torque and can cruise all
day at 85 with the AC on, and can even pass cars going
up hill with the AC on.

Its comfortable over long distances, we have the MV version
with the table the rear-facing jump seats and the folding
rear seats. When we travel with the kids, we pull out
one of the jump seats, put in a plug-in cooler and
off we go!

There is lots of storage room both behind and underneath
the rear seat.

VW was able to take the perfect vehicle and make it even better!
