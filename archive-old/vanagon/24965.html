Subject: Delta Six renamed to Euro-American RV

Just thought that I would pass this on, 

Delta Six Industries has been renamed to:

Euro-American RV Products
5517 Cleon Ave.
No. Hollywood, CA 91601
Phone: 818-760-4214
FAX:   818-760-4216

Their latest flier shows parts for the vanagon skylight, the bus
butane system, various electrical and plumbing parts as well as
exterior hook-ups and vents. But it didn't include a price list.
