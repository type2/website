Thanks Sean!

Just ordered a new one from Kyle for $65, should get it tomorrow. They say
it might actually hit 30 F by Sunday. Heck, I can do the repair in shorts
by then! :-)

&gt; &gt; Yep, I know caps are yelling, I AM YELLING!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's about -5 F w/o the wind chill here in Cincinnati, OH. My '83.5 was
&gt; &gt; sitting out all night defenseless :-(  I came out of this morning about
&gt; &gt; 6am, hoppped in pressed the clutch and shifted to nuetral, started
right
&gt; &gt; up, got out and took the dog to do his daily, came back in about 5
minutes,
&gt; &gt; hopped back in and NO CLUTCH! Nothing, the pedal went straight to the
floor
&gt; &gt; with no resistance at all! It felt OK prior to starting.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What gives?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looked at the Bentley and made out 2 different cylinders. I'm assuming
one
&gt; &gt; of these is the problem?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any advice?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; tony 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Tony,
&gt; The slave cylinder (the one on the transmission end) is usually the one
&gt; that fails in extreme cold on Vanagons.  You can get a rebuilt or new
&gt; one and they even sell rebuild kits, but it's better to get the rebuilt
&gt; or new slave cylinder.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Sean
