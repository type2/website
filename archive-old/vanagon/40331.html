Subject: so-34 doodad prices


i a on the &quot;hunt&quot; for the ever elusive so-34 (white laminate interior) doodads. 
if you dunno what an so-34 interior is than you should prolly disregard the rest 
of this ost causes it is fairly esoteric :) 

anyways i have a lead on the following items

6 &quot;beakers&quot; (those spun aluminum glasses) they are in fair/good shape
the little cone shaped light (w/ dhade)  

waht is a reasonable price for these items?

michael
