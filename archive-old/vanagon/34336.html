Subject: Mileage on original engines

There have been a few recent posts about the mileage achieved from the
original engines of Vanagons.  One was an 84 with 150K and another was an
86 with 170K.  We have an 84 Westy with 165K and it is still going strong.
What would be the usual or normal mileage achieved from the original engine
- or is this like asking how long do people live!!  What is the most
wileage experienced in this group?

We are not keen to have a breakdown in the sticks and I have been told to
watch for loss of coolant or oil as the first sign of engine trouble.  Any
other things to watch for?  Thanks.
Don
84 Westy (Amazing GRACE)
