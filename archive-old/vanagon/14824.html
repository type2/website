Subject: GNATT, waves and queries.

Hello.

	To Martha and David Schwarze- count myself and my wife (and our 
beige 78 Westy) as intent on meeting up with the Washington- B.C. leg of 
the Gnatt (sounds like a bug, not a bus ;)  tour in late May and early 
June.  A way cool &quot;I'm about to graduate!&quot; excursion... 
	Changing gears, I wave at all buses now.  I didn't at first (have  
owned the camper for just two months).  But after a road trip thru central 
Oregon and up the Oregon Coast last month, I came to realize that those 
friendly &quot;wassup?s&quot; and waves of fellow bus-owners are a spirit-lifting
practice; it truly is better to give than receive!  Either it's &quot;hey man, 
glad to see yours is runnin'&quot; or it's &quot;don't despair- you aren't in this 
alone...&quot;.  Um... I'm like, uhh, rambling now.
	Okay- topic #3.  Las Preguntas.  Die Fragen.  The Questions

	-How do you get spilled, used oil out of your new, light-colored 
bus carpet?  That's what'cha get for being mr. enviro- recycling is not 
always so noble- especially when it lands on your rug, not in the Texaco used
oil receptacle.

	And what is the best way to paint a weathered fiberglass westy 
top?  I checked out West Marine in downtown Sea., but gel-cote crap, 
primer/sealer and paint would run over $100!  Can I get away with 
pressure washing, priming and painting with glidden-type exterior paint 
of some kind?  My camper is not for show, tho it's starting to look real 
nice; I'm interested in thoughtful and effective alternatives to shelling 
out more than 25-30 bucks.

	New record- this is my longest post to date!
				Thank you for any advice,
