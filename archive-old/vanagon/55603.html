Subject: '87 low RPM/idle problems.


I have an '87 Wolfs.

The idle seems a bit low, about 800-850. This is what I notice

If I nudge the RMPs up to 1200 or so (using gas pedal) RPMs repeatedly
drift down, in cycles, every few seconds. This happens warm or cold. I
think this makes initial acceleration through the low RPMs sluggish.

Other things: it may die repeatedly until warm (idles slower and rough
when cold). In 2nd or 1st going very slow, with no gas pedal pressure, it
sort of bucks and jump. Occasionally, it *will not* accelerate from a
stop, major sluggisheness for 2-3 seconds, then it roughly gets going and
is OK once I'm at the higher RPMs.

Anyway - main question: what causes the low RPM downdrift? Is
something (wrongly) telling something else to cut out/slow down.

Aloha,

Gordon Smith
