There in an aftermarket kit available which allows to raise the rear of
an EV. This is an air driven add-on suspension.

For Vanagons I know only special springs to lower the vehicle.

     Along the same line...
     Does anyone know of, or if, there are spacers available that go under 
the
     rear coil springs of the Van/Westy to counteract the inevitable spring
     sag?, i.e., raise the rear to spec. height or more?

     Thanks,
