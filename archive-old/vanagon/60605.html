 Definately not.  The passenger mirror on my '91 works fine but the drivers
 side on has very limited range and gives me the clicking noise you
 describe.  I too would be interested in hearing of possible fixes.  &gt;&gt;

You can extend the range of motion of both mirrors by removing the mirror
surface and cutting off the stops on the backside with a hacksaw.  Done this
to 2 vans (4 mirrors) works great.
