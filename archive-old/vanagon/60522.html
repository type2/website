The K70 was VW's first watercooled, front wheeled drive car. It actually an 
NSU which started life as a small version of the NSU Ro-80 with a 
Wankel-type engine (NSU was the first manufacturer to produce a 
rotary-engined car.....NSC holds the design rights to the wankel, or 
actually VW does) in 1969...the K70 appeared in 1970 as a 4 cylinder, 1605 
cc sohc in-line watercooled car with either 105 or 88 hp. 

Thae car was never sold in the US, and was not a success for VW anywhere 
else. It disappeared from the market in 1975.
