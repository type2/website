&gt;Does this sound like a head gasket to you guys (generic term)?

if you have oil in the coolant and vice versa, check out the oil cooler
first! it was a known problem on the rabbits and sciroccos ... the oil cooler
is cooled by the coolant! and if you get leaks between the oil side and
coolant side, you'll get the mix. AND you'll get overheating (cause the
oil isn't being cooled). and it's a lot cheaper to fix that the head
gasket.

but if you check it, you'll have to do it under pressure ... those things
LOOK ok, but have tiny leaks between the two sides.
good luck.
