Subject: Re: Tan paste on inside of oil cap

The &quot;tan paste&quot; is from moisture in the crankcase. My guess is that you do
allot of short distance driving, anything less than twenty miles hardly
warms up the oil enough to boil off the moisture. Be sur the crankcase
breather hoses are all connected. The oil light should come on any time the
oil pressure is below about 8-10 PSI. Which of course is true when the
engine is not running. HTH

&gt;I own a 81 Westy and was wondering if anyone knows the reason for the tan

&gt;problem?  Is the oil light supposed to come on when you start the van in
order to show it is working? I assume this is why the other
&gt;lights come on at start up.  Any responses would be appreciated.  Thanks
