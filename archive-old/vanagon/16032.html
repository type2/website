Subject: Re: Time for a new starter?

&gt; I know that sometimes, if your van won't start, (as in nothing at all
&gt;happens when you turn the key) you can bang on the
&gt;starter and solenoid a bit, and get it to start. This usually happens
&gt;when parked on hills. My question is, since this is happening, is a new
&gt;starter in order? I think this occurs as a result of the brushes
&gt;settling away from the contact points, so perhaps just putting in new
&gt;brushes would solve things? Anyway, all advice welcomed, as I have never
&gt;really messed with these things.

You could try crossing the selenoid and B+ terminals with a screwdriver to
be sure it isn't some other gremlin.  The parked on hills thing makes me
think there is something loose, either the engine mounts, trans mounts, or
starter bolts themselves.
