&gt; 
&gt; That's right! But it was my impression that some people, including you,
&gt; David, planned on getting here early. I suggested going out for dinner,
&gt; because there is no other planned activity that Thursday evening. I am NOT
&gt; suggesting that people come early *just* to make it for the dinner... ;-)

It wasn't the dinner part I was questioning, but the part where you said,
&quot;Afterwards we can all caravan to the BBTA campground&quot;.  I assume the
campground would be open, but I didn't think there would be any BBTA
people there until Friday.  Not really a problem, I guess.  :)
