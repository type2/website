&gt; the Medi-Van fleet modifies all their vanagons for wheel chair access, each van

&gt; structure that allows them to meet some DOT requirement for wheel 
&gt; chair transport without a lot of costly modification.  additionally, 
&gt; their headroom is adequate without the roof extension added to the US 
&gt; products.  it is interesting that the EV appears to also meet these 
&gt; requirements and is being modified.

This headroom requirement is probably also the reason I find the EV more 
confortable than an American tall station wagon - I mean mini-van.  Even 
without the wheelchair.

EV's and Vanagons are probably also easier to deal with than the 
'full-sized' American truck vans.  Better ride for passengers for sure.  
I guess the lack of Vanagons in my area is a sign of the 'yuppieness' of 
Northern Virginia.  Vanagons are 'too old' I guess.

One thing I like about this list is the way people can feed reasons to 
almost any observation or question.  Thanks guys (in the spirit of that 
American Holiday approaching tomorrow) and have a good Thanksgiving...

You 'foreigners' have a good time as well.... :^)
