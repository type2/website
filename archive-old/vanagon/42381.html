 &gt; btw, what a hassle with the oil change.  I take muirs advice, one hand
 &gt; halfway up the wrench for 10mms.    Ive been paranoid about sptripping bolt
 &gt; holes, as i have done that

I use 1/4 inch sockets for that.  You can't get as much torque that way.  I 
switched when my airplane's mechanic saw me using half-inch drive stuff on my 
airplane and told me it's REALLY easy to strip steel threads going into 
aluminum that way.
