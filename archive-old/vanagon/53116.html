Phill:

Air gets into the system through leaks, so the only way I know of to 
determine if it's the master or slave (or something else) is to start
looking closely for fluid.  If you rebuilt/replaced the slave (I think
you said this in an earlier post) then it's probably the master cylinder.

Have you noticed that the carpet under your driver's seat has been wet from
all the recent rain?  If so, it's probably not water, it's fluid from the
master cylinder.

There's really no &quot;trick&quot; I know of to changing the master cylinder, but it
helps if you're a professional contortionist!
