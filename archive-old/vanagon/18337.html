Subject: '71 Timing

OK, we're getting ready for the trip to South Carolina with the two 6 
week old kitties. Everything is pretty much set. I have a question. I was 
out working on Blushie (my '71 pop top) and installed new points, 
condenser, &amp; plugs. I think I remember somewhere that the maximum amount 
of advance at hiway speeds is 28 degrees BTDC. Is this correct? I've also 
heard a figure of around 34 degrees. I'm running a stock 1600 dual port 
with a stock carb and an 009 distributor. I set it up to go no farther 
than 28 degrees at speed and the idle kicks in around 6 degrees.
Any suggestions would be helpful. I'll be setting my Vanagon list to 
nomail sometime Friday evening, or Saturday morning, so if you would 
please e-mail me directly in case my carrier doesn't pick it up till it's 
too late. Thanks a bunch, in advance.
