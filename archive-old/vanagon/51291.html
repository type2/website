Subject: I can't find it...

OK, 
Call me an idiot but I can't find the freakin' paint code sticker.  The
manual says it's on the left side under the dashboard.  All I can find
there is the tire inflation sticker and the wasser sticker.  Where is
the paint/body/engine/transmission code sticker in relation to that?
Failing that, does anyone know the L-code for the medium blue paint.
John Anderson, what's your L-code?  Mine's the same color.

That's the &quot;Smurf Blue&quot; color :)

It says in the manual that a copy of the code sticker is in the warranty
booklet, so I open the warranty booklet and of course, the dealer didn't
fill it out completely :(

			      Later he saw that each weed
