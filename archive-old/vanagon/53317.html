&gt; Also, RMMW wants $24.95 for a set of two adaptors (I think the bulbs are 
&gt; included).  That seems kind of pricey.  Has anyone seen this type of
adaptor 
&gt; before in a FLAPS?  I haven't.  
&lt;snip&gt; 
&gt; Should I go for these halogen dealies?  Anyone have them on their van?

I've bought &amp; installed halogen back-ups from JCWhitney and while they were
brighter than the originals, I wasn't particularly impressed.  If you compare
a &quot;before &amp; after&quot; you can see the difference, but no one's gonna say, &quot;wow!
look how much light those back-ups throw out!&quot;.

I don't know if the RMMW bulbs are they same as the JCWhitneys, so that could
certainly make a difference.  The JCWhitneys did &quot;seem&quot; like high quality
bulbs and each pair was packaged in a box with form fitted foam for each bulb
- a nice touch to protect the bulbs.  No, there was no evidence of a &quot;brand
name&quot; on the Whitney bulbs.

Good luck,
