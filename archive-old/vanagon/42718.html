&gt;     SUBJECT:  VIRUSES--IMPORTANT PLEASE READ IMMEDIATELY
&gt;     
&gt;       There is a computer virus that is being sent across the
&gt; Internet.   If you receive an e-mail message with the subject 
&gt; line &quot;Good  Times&quot;,   DO NOT  read  the  message,  DELETE  it 
&gt; immediately.  Please read the messages below.  Some miscreant 
&gt; is sending  e-mail under  the title &quot;Good Times&quot; nation wide, 
&gt; if you  get anything like this, DON'T DOWN LOAD THE FILE!  It 
&gt; has a  virus that  rewrites  your  hard  drive,  obliterating 
&gt; anything on  it.  Please be careful and forward this mail to 
&gt; anyone you care about.

&gt; WARNING!!!!!!!  INTERNET VIRUS
&gt;     
&gt;       The FCC  released a warning last Wednesday concerning a
&gt; matter of  major  importance  to  any  regular  user  of  the 
&gt; Internet.     Apparently  a   new  computer  virus  has  been 
&gt; engineered by  a user of AMERICA ON LINE that is unparalleled 
&gt; in its destructive capability.  Other more well-known viruses 
&gt; such as  &quot;Stoned&quot;,  &quot;Airwolf&quot;  and  &quot;Michaelangelo&quot;  pale  in 
&gt; comparison to  the prospects  of this  newest creation  by  a 
&gt; warped mentality.   What makes this virus so terrifying, said 
&gt; the FCC,  is the  fact that  no program needs to be exchanged 
&gt; for a  new computer to be infected.  It can be spread through 
&gt; the existing e-mail systems of the Internet.  Once a computer 
&gt; is infected,  one of  several things  can  happen.    If  the 
&gt; computer contains  a hard  drive, that  will most  likely be 
&gt; destroyed.   If the  program is  not stopped,  the computer's 
&gt; processor will be placed in an nth-complexity infinite binary 
&gt; loop -which can severely damage the processor if left running 
&gt; that way too long.
&gt;     
&gt;       Unfortunately, most  novice  computer  users  will  not
&gt; realize what is happening until it is far too late.  Luckily, 
&gt; there is one sure means of detecting what is now known as the 
&gt; &quot;Good Times&quot;  virus.   It always travels to new computers the 
&gt; same way  in a  text email  message  with  the  subject  line 
&gt; reading &quot;Good  Times&quot;.   Avoiding infection  is easy once the 
&gt; file has been received- not reading it!    The act of loading 
&gt; the file into the mail server's ASCII buffer causes the &quot;Good 
&gt; Times&quot; mainline program to initialize and execute.
&gt;     
&gt;     The program is highly intelligent- it will send copies of
&gt; itself to  everyone whose  e-mail address  is contained  in a 
&gt; receive-mail file or a sent-mail file, if it can find one. It 
&gt; will then proceed to trash the computer it is running on. The 
&gt; bottom line  here is - if you receive a file with the subject 
&gt; line &quot;Good  Times&quot;, delete  it immediately!   Do not read it&quot; 
&gt; Rest assured  that whoever's  name was on the &quot;From&quot; line was 
&gt; surely struck  by the  virus.   Warn your  friends and  local 
&gt; system users  of this newest threat to the Internet! It could 
&gt; save them a lot of time and money.
