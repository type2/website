&gt;Hi Dave... is there an archive somewhere that explains the 
&gt;differences between the many models of camper packages...??
&gt;
&gt;	I've seen you mention SO-42 and such, where do I find out about 
&gt;them...?? I just bought a '67 westy pop-top walk-thru and wanna get an 
&gt;idea if it is worth restoring ie: rare interior or just 
&gt;run-of-the-mill...
&gt;
&gt;		any info would be most welcome....

I am by no means an expert on the Westy interiors, but here is what I 
think I know...  :)    (corrections welcome)

1956-58  Campbox interior (don't know the SO number)  Wood cabinets 
         including a roll-top desk type cabinet over the engine &amp; 
         gas tank shelf that blocked the view out the back window.
         Submarine roof hatch.

1958-61  SO-23 interior.  Arguably the classiest and most sought after 
         Westy interior.  Wood cabinets w/ brass trim.  Put into bench 
         seat Kombis.  Submarine roof hatch.

1962-63  SO-34 interior.  Wood cabinets w/ brass trim.  Jump seat 
         between 2 rear cabinets.  Put into walk-thru Kombis, but seat 
         back bulkheads were cut out and a boat type bench flip seat 
         was installed.  Submarine roof hatch.

1962-63  SO-35 interior.  Same as SO-34 except white Melamine or 
         Formica over plywood cabinets w/o brass trim.

1964-67  SO-42 interior.  Most common Westy interior.  Cabinets were 
         plywood w/ woodgrain Formica finish.  Came in both bench seat 
         and walk-thru Kombis.  Came with or without poptop.  If 
         original will have A42, B42, or C42 on vin plate behind 
         passenger seat.

1964-67  SO-44 interior.  Another sought after Westy interior.  Were 
         used in some Westys and a lot of Dormobiles.  Cabinets were 
         plywood w/ woodgrain Formica finish.  Came in bench seat 
         Kombis only.  There was a row of cabinets behind the front 
         seat bulkhead that housed a stove and icebox.  I suspect 
         Dormobile chose this as one of their interiors due to the 
         extra structural integrity of the front seat bulkhead keeping 
         the frame rigid even after cutting the huge hole in the roof 
         for their top.  I've never seen an ORIGINAL walk-thru Dormobile.

Rick &amp; Susan Crandall in Washington did some good articles on Westfalia 
interiors about a year ago in the Old Bus Review, NEATO's bi-monthly 
newsletter (yet another shameless plug for NEATO!).  

When Tom sends me transcriptions of the back issues I will format them 
and add them to the NEATO web page at 

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html

(the plugs just keep plugging!)

Michael Heron and Clara can probably add to what I have here.  Your 
interior is most likely the SO-42.  Check the vin plate.

Dave
