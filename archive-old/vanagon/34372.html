&gt;Question: at 150,000+ miles (and I don't know of any rebuild history), 
&gt;should I do preventative maintenance and replace the gaskets, or do it when 
&gt;they go bad (ie, is there a warning before the whole engine is toast)?
&gt;
&gt;

At 150K, do not fix what isn't broken.  Save money so when it does break, you
can engine properly rebiuilt with new heads if needed.  It owes you very
little.
