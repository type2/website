&gt; Plain and simple Tim, dealers and most other garages don't want to work

&gt; park the car and give it the sunshine treatment and work on more lucrative
&gt; problems.
&gt;
&gt; Your best course of action that I can see, is either one: pursue it legally
&gt; and see if you can arbitrate them to either fix the vehicle or buy it back.
&gt;
&gt; or two: If you really want this van and want it to run right without all
&gt; of these problems, you're going to have to get your hands dirty and check
&gt; out out yourself.
&gt;
&gt; If it were my van, I'd probably start with number one and see how much
&gt; trouble it was.
&gt;
&gt; In the mean time, while I had the van I'd check every damn wire connector
&gt; and connection made on it.  Don't assume anything just because it's only
&gt; 3 years old.  Start at the battery and work your way along the circuits
&gt; that have the accessories that have failed or are intermittent.  Check
&gt; every wire every connection whether you're looking at a junction, a
&gt; 'T' or a component.  Make sure there is always a good clean solid
&gt; connection.  You want to rule out the possibility that there is no
&gt; continuity problem in the wire interconnects.  That is what I suspect
&gt; is wrong as most intermittent problems like yours are.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect, that if you do number two, that you'll probably find the
&gt; problem yourself long before any legal proceedings would start....

Steven:

I think you're absolutely right.  I'll pursue option (2) first, actually.

thanques,
-Tim.
