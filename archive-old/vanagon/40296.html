Subject: resistor platinum plugs...


 without thinking i bought a set of WR7DP plugs for my 2.1
 now i realize, that resistor plugs with resistor wires, might
 cause a bit of an ignition problem...
 someone one the list, wrote of a three conductor platinum non-resistor
 plug which is better....
 could someone send me that info???
 later
