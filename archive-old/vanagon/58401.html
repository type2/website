Subject: Misc ranting on shoddy work...

Late last week the front wheel bearing on my Jetta finally packed it 
in, with a pleasant howling sound.
Knowing this was on the horizon, I'd already scoped a few shops, 
including the dealer, who could press the bearing in for me. I pulled 
the hub assembly &amp; dropped it off at Beetle AutoHaus in Victoria this 
morning. Picked it up, $26 labour (1/2 hr) + $29 for the bearing. Ok. 
Better than 1.8hrs labour for them to do it, I thought.

I get home tonight, haven't lunch today, but decide to do it before 
dinner, since it only took 15-20 minutes to pull it, I figure it'll 
be a cinch... (1.8hrs they said...)

Well, it would've been, but obviously this particular VW *specialty* 
shop does not have all them fancy tools shown in the Bentley, 
'cause they screwed up the driveshaft splines when they pressed the 
bearing in!! Argh.

So I spent 25 minutes carefully filing the splines to fit the drive 
shaft, then only 10 minutes putting it all back together.

I hate to be overly negative, but I have *yet* to pay any so-called 
pro to work on my VWs, and NOT have them screw it up somehow. Do I 
have bad karma or what?
