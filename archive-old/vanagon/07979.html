Subject: 1987 vanagon engine spontaneous runaway 

My 1987 vanagon recently began a runaway engine behaviour.

After the car has idled, or been driven for 2-5 minutes, the engine
will spontaneously race.  If underway, the car will easily maintain
45 mph in 3rd, with no application of throttle.  If clutched, the engine will
speed to about 3000 rpm, with no application of throttle.  Application
of throttle will raise the engine speed.

Cycling the ignition from off to on several times will clear the problem
until the next time the car is allowed to cool, such as overnight, or 
half a day, while working.  After that cooling, when run again, the
same behaviour will repeat.  At first, driving in the morning, after
garage storage overnight would not show the problem.  Since cooler weather
has come, even mornings are not immune.

I had the car to a VW dealer, who checked the function of the f-i
components, and pronounced them to be in good working order.  They
had the car for about 3-4 days, during which time they ran it morning,
and night, and the problem did not exhibit itsself.  Needless to say, 
every time since then that I've driven, the problem has been present.

The offered to begin shotgunning control components, on a non-refundable 
basis until the problem goes away. I'm hoping for a bit more deterministic
approach to isolate the problem without so much expense.


Any experiences, or references?  A reply by email would be appreciated, in case
work keeps me from the newsgroup too long.
