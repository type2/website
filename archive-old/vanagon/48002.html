&gt;This is a way cool vehicle, saw one at the vintage meet here in Seattle a 
&gt;few weeks back. I talked to the owner and he said there were only 3 of 
&gt;these imported into North America. As he has one and imported another for 
&gt;someone in CA, this would be the third. May be a real collectors item in 
&gt;about ten years!

While this is a rare vehicle, there must be many more than three in the
states.  I know the owners of three of them here in Southern California
alone, all being imported from Canada.
