Subject: Re: FW: Extra Gas?

yes, i would think that putting the can inside of a bag is a bad idea..

anyone have any opinions on using a paintshop item:
rag buckets are made of VERY heavy metal and have an airtight lid.  This
is to prevent spontaneous combustion of rags, and the metal is to contain
any fire that might occur.

i would think that attatching one of these to the floor would be the
safest way to go.

is there any way/place to put a small jerry can on a bus/vanagon?

take care,

Steve

&gt; If  you want to carry extra gas in the car, do it in an approved
&gt; container only.  Other containers may be subject to breaking down from
&gt; the petro-chemical make up of gasoline, let alone impact resistance,
&gt; legality, etc.  Also, I would recommend purchasing a container that is
&gt; stronger than the $2.98 metal cans, and make it a small size- just
&gt; enough to get you to a station; this would be safer.

&gt; &gt;     No I do not believe it is safe.  I have read that gasoline fumes are a 
&gt; &gt;     carcinogen.  Understand that what constitutes prolonged exposure may 
&gt; &gt;     not be the levels experienced while traveling in your van. 
&gt; &gt;     
&gt; &gt;     Why would you want to smell it?  A great number of people experience 
&gt; &gt;     far more immediate side effects of gasoline vapor inhalation such as 
&gt; &gt;     nausea.
&gt; &gt;     
&gt; &gt;     Why not just strap it to your roof?  That's what I do.  I've never had 
&gt; &gt;     anyone steal my container, and it just looks cool up there.
&gt; &gt;     
&gt; &gt;     But if you are hell bent on keeping it inside your van, search out 
&gt; &gt;     some type of vapor containment device.  Several outdoor companies make 
&gt; &gt;     dry bags for rafting/kayaking that you could certainly put a small 1 
&gt; &gt;     gallon gas can in.  It would certainly save you the stench.  Maybe 
&gt; &gt;     even a giant zip-lock back.
&gt; &gt;     
&gt; &gt;     Hope this helps.......

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I was wondering if it is safe to carry an extra gallon of gas in a gas 
&gt; &gt;canaster inside my 1980 camper.  I'm sure some people do it.  Could you 
&gt; &gt;put the canaster in one of the cabinets?  (since my gas meter is broke, I 
&gt; &gt;have to judge the level on milage)
&gt; &gt;     
&gt; &gt;Any advice would be great.
