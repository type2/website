&gt; I have just installed the new rubber seal on the top and luggage rack

&gt; bolts
&gt; on the luggage rack back into the top when trying to align the luggage
&gt; rack
&gt; while bolting it back on?  I just don't want to take out the headliner
&gt; if
&gt; there is any other way to do it.  HELP!

A dab of glue (auto GOOP) on the bolts and adjacent rubber washer will
hold the bolts enough. Be careful to not get glue in the upper threaded
portion.

&gt; I couldn't believe all of the trash that was between the luggage rack
&gt; and
&gt; the top of the camper!  It appears that anything that washes through
&gt; the
&gt; four drain holes gets trapped between the luggage rack and top.  There
&gt; is
&gt; no way out!  Has anyone else run into this problem?  I'm thinking
&gt; about
&gt; putting tape over the holes or putting a screen in the holes.

Small pieces of aluminum screening glued to the under side of the
carrier does neat job and keeps the debris out. The problem is that the
clog and must be cleaned or else the carrier carries water.

&gt; While I'm on the subject, does anyone know a source for the metal tie
&gt; down
&gt; fittings on the top of the luggage rack?  Mine are quite rusted and I
&gt; would
&gt; like to replace them.

Aluminum paint does a reasonable job.
