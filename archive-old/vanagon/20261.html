Subject: RE: engine swap heat

Porsche-into-Vanagon swap kits I'm familiar with are Martin Schneider (read
his instruction manual) and homebrew, solve problems as they come up (what
I did).  MSDS does some things real nice (eg engine hanger, sheet metal),
leaves other things for you to do (eg, I think, accelerator linkage), but
was not, IMO, worth $1700.  Get the instruction manual for $25 and see what
you think.  Probably the closer you are to his prototype (3.2 into wasser-
boxer) the more useful his kit would be.

*I* think that Porsche engines belong in aircooled Vanagons, but I don't live
in sunny southern California where heat is just for defogging on each month's
rainy day.  MSDS includes a flyer on someone's electric heater.  Others on
the net have talked about running a new duct, basically duplicating the 
heater system that an aircooled Vanagon would have had.  The third idea that
comes to mind is to use a front oil cooler for heat.  I put my front oil
cooler behind the front grill (only grill on my 81, upper grill on your 
waterpumper) about three inches ahead of the passenger's toes.  With some
hassle, you could use that for heat, but you might have to wait a while in
cold weather before the thermostat puts the front cooler to work.

ICE (see ads in VW and Porsche mags) have told me in a phonecon that they
would be happy to sell an airconditioning system with Porsche engine mount
for the compressor and all the rest Vanagon, since they do Porsche and Vanagon
systems.  About $1500, I think. 

Other questions?  Porsche-into-Vanagon discussions are MUCH more fun than work.
