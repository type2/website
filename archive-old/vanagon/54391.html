&gt; &gt; So what if someone is making money with this list.

Echoing another agreement to this statement.  I see the same thing in 
ferrets which those who recognize the name will remember I have some 
involvement with.  Those with a hobby that is a strong enough passion 
want the &quot;purity&quot; with no room for profit.  

&gt; run-o'-the-mill economists would probably predict that if *everyone*
&gt; on this list behaved mercantilistically, charged what they could and
&gt; paid what they had to, we might all generally be better off (this
&gt; counter-intuitive proposition has always been hard to teach to
&gt; undergraduates).

I can see why that would be harder to understand.

&gt; I have adapted to the situation by charging people what I think they
&gt; would charge me.
&gt; 
&gt; My 2 cents,

So are we supposed to send you the two cents for this posting?  
Professional services and all?  &lt;g&gt; (Okay thats why I really replied... a 
silly joke)
