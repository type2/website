Subject: Re: Fw: Ques: squeak under passenger seat.


Both of mine do this (86 with 160k miles, 88 with 90k miles) and only
in cold weather.

 &gt;I too have this only in cold weather. I thought it was the spare tire at
 &gt;first, but no go! Again, only in cold weather. Any ideas?
 &gt;
 &gt;BTW, the squeak is on my '83.5 (temporarily NOT for sale, might be keeping
 &gt;both :-)

 &gt;&gt; Helloall
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front passenger
 &gt;seat
 &gt;&gt; |on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a passenger is seated.
 &gt;&gt; Any suggestions?
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; Thanks.
 &gt;&gt; Lulie
