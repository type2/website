Subject: European VW dealer

     &gt;You know, what we really need is a European VW dealer
     
     I would agree. I spoke to a parts guy at the local BIG VW dealer. He 
     was into NSUs' himself so he was very helpful with parts for my '64 
     bus. I had a look through the microfiche with him and saw such parts 
     as Deluxe trim, sunroofs etc.. I asked him how many parts were still 
     available for the Split buses and he replied about 80% in Germany. I 
     was amazed. I've got some numbers of warehouses in Germany that boast 
     Schwimmerwagen gearboxes in stock!!! Just gotta get these VW dealers 
     on the net now...
     
     
     Lee.
