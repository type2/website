&lt;&lt;  I may be approaching the 3rd water pump changeout on my 84 Vanagon..
    
    What gives?
    
    Why does my bus eat water pumps every 35k miles?
    
    Is there a heavy duty version available?
    
    Is this a do it yourself job? &gt;&gt;


What is failing?  The bearings or the seal?  Bearing failure is usually
caused by excessive belt tension.  Seal failure is caused by excessive
temparatures, pressures, or grit in the cooling system.  It is very important
the the proper anti-freeze water mix is used.  Repalacing a water pump is a
do it yourself job.  Figure 2 to 3 hours depending on skill and practice.
