Subject: Odometer Repair

My odo is out on the 82 Diesel Westy and have shopped far and wide for
the best price on a quality repair job as having done similar work in
the past, and hearing the training evolutions many on the list are
engaging in doing thier own, I found an outfit on the web that anyone
w/odo probs might like to check out. It is an overseas speedo shop in
Austin Texas, says he will repair my odo w/1 year no ?s asked warranty
for $65 plus $3 return shipping (UPS still out?!!). Just send in the
speed and he sends it back repaired. This price seems like half of the
best price of what I found here in the Houston area. See them at:
