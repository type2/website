Subject: At least my Tow rope works!!!!

Driving from Palo Alto to Sunnyvale on 102 this afternoon I saw a white 74
westy on the side of the road. I stopped and tried to help. My jumper cables
could not get their engine to turn over , so I found my tow rope and towed
them but no luck. I then towed them to a gas station and we put gas in their
bus. It then needed another tow and they were running.
They did not tell me who they were but they came from Seattle and their bus
has Virginia stickers on it and mice holes in the rockers.

At least I know that my tow rope works but my jumper cables are not too
swift.
