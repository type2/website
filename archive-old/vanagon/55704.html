&gt;How about doing some phenomenal trip with both groups in the year 2000

&gt;technically I guess this happen in 2001, but it seems the rest of
&gt;the world is fairly focused on 2000, so I thought we should be, too.
&gt;
&gt;How about a marathon trip to somewhere REALLY obscure for most of
&gt;us - like Tierra del Fuego?
&gt;
&gt;I know this is off in the future, but with something of this
&gt;magnitude, I figure we'd need lots of time for people to plan
&gt;for vacations, time-offs, sabbaticals, etc., not to mention
&gt;getting their vehicles ready and/or upgraded.

Excellent idea, Martha.  I'll even offer to organize the trip and do P.R.
I think that the idea of Tierra del Fuego is a good one.  I'm especially
interested since it would be a nice counterpoint to Inuvik.

Note however that we can't drive there without shipping due to the Darien
Gap.  The Gap is a large area of rainforest (populated by Choco indians!)
that has yet to be successfully crossed by road.  Part of the reason is
that the Gap is seen as a natural barrier to the dissemination of
infectious diseases such as aftosa or &quot;hoof and mouth disease.&quot;

There's a great web page on the Gap at:
    http://www.sofcom_dot_com.au/4WD/Places/CentralAmerica/Darien.html

There's a recent film about the Gap:
    http://sundancefilm_dot_com/sundance/festival/films/highlights/darienga/

It's certainly possible to do this trip, however.  Tim Cahill did it in 23
1/3 days in 1987, from Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe bay.  He left from the
end of the earth on 9/29/87 and hit the Canadian border 21 days later.  The
truck they were driving was put on a container ship to cross the Gap.

Tim's biggest complaint was that they didn't have enough time.  He also
worried about dying a lot.  This isn't a trip for the faint of heart.

My guess for a trip using busses (and the associated break-downs) is 2.5
months.  Anyone up for this sort of sabbatical?
