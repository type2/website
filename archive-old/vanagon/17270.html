Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff

Interesting...  If the transducer (antenna) itself is under dash, it sounds
like they are wasting a lot of EM energy to transmit past all the metal it's
encased in -- unless they found a decent way of using all or parts of the
body as the antenna.  I'd like to hear more about this...

 &gt; much superior to ext. antennae, and way tidier to install. Dakota is known
 &gt; mostly for their high-tech instrument
