Subject: '71 engine apart (mostly)

Well gurus,  football season has ended, so I finally got outside and 
pulled out the engine from my '71 Westy.  I have torn it down to the
point where the next step is splitting the case.

I haven't noticed anything really obvious (to me, anyway) that is
broken, worn, melted, etc., except the following:

1)  a bent pushrod

2)  some slight scoring (I can see it, but can't feel it with my
fingernail) on one of the cylinders, which looks like the piston
skirt was rubbing (similar marks on the skirt as well).  Bentley
says this may happen with overheated motors (?).

The oil pump looks ok, there is slight scoring on the cover, but
not enough to fill up the oil with metal shavings like I saw!

What would cause a bent pushrod?  Only thing I can think of is
a stuck valve or something.  The heads are brand new, and I kept
the valves properly adjusted.

Do I need to split the case (tell me I don't!!)?  I just don't
see how the pushrod could be connected with all the metal shavings
in the oil.  I *can* see how it may be the cause of all the noise
I heard, but I fear that it's just another unrelated problem.

Right?
