Subject: Re: external oil cooler for 82 vanagon? Heating up????

\&gt;
&gt;I have an 82 vanagon and I am thinking of installing an exterval oil
&gt;cooler. I have a VDO temp guage on the sump and the temps are running
&gt;around 230-250. I know that is too hot. I have brought it in to get
&gt;checked out and they say that everything is fine with the cooling system.
&gt;So I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on why it is getting so
&gt;hot and how much and should I get an external cooler to hopefully solve
&gt;the overheating problem.

250F is certainly getting up there.
I'd suggest make sure that your engine is running on all four cyls. Maybe a
compression &amp; leakdown test.
