Subject: Re: Trip Report: Weekend in Lake George, NY (Long)

 When we reached the nearest civilization we were
&gt;soon surrounded by VW buses!  Wow, this is really strange, I wonder what's
&gt;up?

And I thought the Westie Vanagon (gold) and the regular Vanagon (silver) I
saw on my way home today (5 miles) was really something.
Ah, humility!
