Subject: Westy Resto from... Update

Over a week ago I mentioined that the Bodyshop from Hell promised to have
the bus painted in a few days. Well, the genius who is doing the work had
trouble cutting the infintite layer of dust on the bus and needed to order
some &quot;Ting&quot; to cut the static electricity and then rub it down again. &quot;Paint
definitely to go on by the weekend&quot;, he said. I stop by Saturday AM to
babysit. Paint on by two O'clock I'll call you. No call The weekend passes.
I stop by Monday AM still no paint. Stop by Tuesday night and &quot;just missed
him by five minutes. The neighboring mechanic said that the bus was painted
white. Some minor runs and dust &quot;that can be color sanded out.&quot; The neighbor
said that the genius expected me to stop by Weds. morning. I stop by this
morning and still no genius. Phone calls. Answering machine. The genius is
now juggling a UPS job for the holidays amongst paint duties. When I stopped
by this AM another fellow was there with a front cage to a prerunner that
&quot;needed painted before Bug-o-Rama this weekend.&quot; The genius said that he
would work non-stop on my bus during the last two free days before the UPS
gig goes full time. Count it as another job jumping in front of me. Oh well,
it's only been FOURTEEN MONTHS!!!!! AAAAHHAHAAAAAAGGGGGG!!!!
It's a good thing that I don't have any other stresses in my life! (not). So
much for the Nicoderm Patch I'm back to a pack a day. Grrrrrr....
Some how I feel less than genius for getting sucked in so deep. Shiest,
NEVER again!! Then again... ;)
