Hi there,

	I learned something:)  CLEAN AND GREASE YOUR ADJUSTING STARS
AND SCREWS!! It makes a world of difference!

	Well, yesterday, the little chitlin (5 days old) and I tackled
the rear brakes.  One of the adjusting screws, was frozen, and the bus
needed new shoes.  It turned out to be pretty easy.  I took the wheel
and drums off, then the shoes and all related hardware apart.  With no
dust plugs over the adjusting holes, the inside was FILTHY!  So I
cleaned the backing plate and all the parts still on the bus, then a
dip into solvent and a wire brush for all the removed parts.  A quick
spritz of rustoleum on the spring locking cup after cleaning away the
rust.  wire brush everything until it shines, put it all back together
with new  shoes (the old ones were half as thick as the new ones), the
main thing was I cleaned up the adjusting stars and screws.  The
sticky one, was just about rusted together.  Lots of scrubbing and
chasing the screw in to the star.  A good coat of grease over the
threads and on the outside of the star as well as where it seats, and
wahlah!  Now I have brakes, and I mean good ones!  Next the CV joints,
get greased, and then... I pull the engine.  YEE-HAW, life is good:)  

take care,
	brandy
