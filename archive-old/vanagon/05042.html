&gt; needs work, but I'll tackle that when I eventually drop the tank and have
&gt; everything cleaned. Until then I rely mainly on the trip odometer, I seem
&gt; to get a consistent 360 miles to the tankfull.
&gt; 
&gt; (also my fuel pump buzzes when I'm really low, kinda built in warning device)
&gt; funny you should mention this, this happened just prior to shut down.....
&gt; 
This is a diesel I hope, otherwise you are getting amazing mileage.... 
I am lucky if I get 250 around town and 300 on the highway -DC
