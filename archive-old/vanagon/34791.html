Subject: Re: 1974 VW Bus Price?

wow do i envy you lucky folks out west ! i visit utah every so often
&amp; think the wasatch range is spectacular.
i've got 3 type 2's &amp; they are ,shall we say, a bit rusty... for a solid bus-
even a late model aircooled- that price would be an impossibly good steal.
you guys could make a billion selling solid stuff at a well-publicized event
back here in the old world !
peace, thom

&gt; I know there is a great range out there but I am looking for a
&gt; ballpark price on a 1974 VW standard Bus.  The Bus looks pretty clean
&gt; and straight with all the trim and glass there, and the insides and
&gt; seats are in pretty good shape as well.  The engine was very recently
&gt; rebuilt localy and seems to be ok.  The owner claims to have just put
&gt; $2000 into the Bus and wants to sell it for $2500.  This seems a
&gt; little steep to me but thats why I'm posting this to the list.  What
&gt; would a clean, strong running 1974 Bus sell four in your area?
&gt; I also recently aquired a 1983 240 DL Volvo and might be able to work
&gt; some kind of a trade on the Bus.  Let me hear from you bus people out
&gt; there.
