Subject: Bill's honeymoon


Rusty van Bondo had a great suggestion.  Bill:  can you get
married in time to spend your honeymoon with all of us at Baja?
You and Jean can use my shower FREE, and if you swing it right,
Jeff Schneiter may let you guys sleep with his dog Argo.  After
he eats the beans and has the tomato juice bath to get rid of
that skunk smell.  

We promise not to tip your van or wake you guys up, or anything  :)
