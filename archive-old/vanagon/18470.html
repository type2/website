Propane problems solved.

The entire problem was not having the 80% valve cranked wide open.  
Van is filled, kids safe.

On a related note:
We got a call from Dave Schwarze today!  We are trying to meet up 
with him in the Black Hills and now it looks like we are going to 
miss connections.  My wife had a tooth pulled today (nasty infection) 
that has been delaying our start but we'll head out on Thurs, 
dentition willing.

My wife spoke to Dave and he said all is going well and the GNATT 
schedule is still holding.

thanx all for the propane help and we'll be seeing ya!
