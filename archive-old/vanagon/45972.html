Subject: CCC's Sat. nite explosives/bombs/fireworks!



It's settled for sure, based on the response. Tomorrow nite, which
is Saturday, we will meet at the Kautze's house in the south bay,
taking as many cars as is necessary, and will head out to find a beach
where we think we can get away with all this stuff we are burning to do.  :)

We're meeting at Kautze's at 7:30, and everyone will have already eaty
dinner.  If you need drinks, BYOB.

Most especially, bring any- and everything cool you can think of to
blow up, set off, ignite, detonate, etc.  We'll be doing this into
a body of water like the Pacific Ocean, hopefully, and not a national
forest.  So, it maybe be cold, and you should probably dress in
layers, despite the recent heat wave here.

Bring matches, lighters, fluid, gasoline, butane, acetylene, etc.

If anyone needs directions to the meeting place, phone me at
510.376.4321, or e-mail me.

See you there!
