Subject: Re: used parts

&gt;Does anyone have a good index for fair prices on used parts?
&gt;We are getting several used items and want to know if these are
&gt;reasonable prices:
&gt;speedo/odo - 50
&gt;fuel guage - 20
&gt;sliding door lock mechanism - 50
&gt;driver's side window regulator - 40
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any idea if these are good prices or not?
