I second the machine shop suggestion.  Here in Indiana there aren't too
many VW-only automotive machine shops, but there are some very good general
ones, and this sort of problem is common to other makes of course.  This
happened on a '78 2.0 liter I was rebuilding and the local place had their
cylinder head specialist fix it for only about 10 bucks or so.  (Mine didn't
need welding, just the stud drilled and removed.)  They have the experience
and equipment.
