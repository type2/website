Subject: Evaporative Cooler Info?

Hey now,
        Sometime fairly recently someone posted info on a study done about
evaporative cooling in humid environments. I've gone digging in the
archives and can't find it. Anybody know the subject line, or have the
pertinent info handy? For that matter, I've got a '70 II, anyone out there
with a comparable bus running AC-original or aftermarket-and have any
comments? Esp. the rotary compressor systems that are being sold by an
outfit here in Texas? Thanks in adavance for the help...

Peace,
