Subject: Im back...with a new clutch and a dilemma.

        Well I managed to get a new account...for free again. Yipeeee.
Unfortunately, in the week that I was off the list something rather crappy
happened. The clutch went on my 83.5 Westie one day after I left the list.
Bad karma or what folks? 
        Anyhow, I managed to get a clutch for under $200 new, and then had
to shell out $400 for all the labor. I would've attempted it myself but I'm
leaving today for a 3 day camping excursion, so I wanted to make sure it was
done well, and that in the event that it craps out again, I can at leasttake
it back under warranty.
        It sure hurt the pocket book, and now Ive been getting pressure like
mad from my folks, and freinds that I should think about selling it. Granted
I have had to dump alot of $$$ into it in the past year, but I dont want to
give up on it that easy. So what I was kinda wondering was wether or not
anyone else here has come to a 'crossroads' with deciding wether or not
there van is a money pit or not, and how they dealt with it. 
        I'll always love VW vans, but Im wondering if I should trade this
one in, or what.....Im kinda confused. Maybe the weekend camping trip will
set things straight.

confused.
