Subject: Re: Factory Tools List Vanagon

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a complete VW tools
list for 1963-1967 micros. Or does anyone need to know that a
VW 737 is a Vent wing appliance?
VW739/1 (Glass installing tool)
Or the VW codes for all the paint? (Yellow-green is LKM 12)
This list would take me quite a bit of time to organise/enter, and
it would be fairly long, and I'm not even sure if the nomenclature
is still valid, (Although it would appear so from the vanagon tool 
list.)
