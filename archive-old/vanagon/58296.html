&lt;&lt; The winder handle of the sunroof snapped off on my 1984 Caravelle GL. I am
 dreading the cost of a new part. Does anyone have a spare from a broken
 roof? Preferably in the UK. I will find out how much the dealer part is
 tomorrow.

Believe it or not, you can just use a window crank from any door window of
any VW. Or you can go to the junkyard and get a sunroof crank from any VW or
audi. They're all the same.
