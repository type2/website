Subject: DC area - Mid atlantic events


Alright as of my last post for suggestions/thoughts/ramblings/hate mail for 
some kind of event for the DC/Mid Atlantic/East Coast, I have had about as 
much luck as Charlie Manson getting parole.   The total reponses were one 
direct email and one telephone call.  I am certain that we would not want to 
have our west coast brethern/sistern be going on all these exciting camping 
trips while we sit at home and polish our hubcaps :)   

Anyway First) are there any votes out there for a weekend evening to plan an 
event or should we do it over the net.  Second) What would be a likely place 
to go or not go.  I myself would be willing to travel anywhere from N. 
Carolina to the Catskills and from the Applachian Mtns. to the sea.  All of 
which is within a five or six hour drive for me.  Of course we are just going 
to have pizza and drink to plan, Baltimore, Washington and if enough people, 
I will slide down to Richmond on a Fridray or Saturday night.
