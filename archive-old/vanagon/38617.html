Subject: tire sizes?? 83 westy


Thanks for all the input on the tire brands!!  I am not sure what size to 
buy.  I know that it had 185's on it but I see listings for tires up to 205.

QUESTION:  what advantage/disadvantage do the bigger tire have?  In your 
infinite VW wisdom, which do you think is the best size?

If this is archives stuff I am relly sorry.  I lost my instruction sheet 
for getting into the the info bank.
