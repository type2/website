:
&gt;&gt; or 110 VAC (330 Hz) _at_ 150 W
&gt;
&gt;So why is everybody so afraid of this 330Hz? I agree, don't test it
&gt;on your laptop (to expensive experiment), (and stay away from that 650V 
DC),
&gt;but I don't see why feeding a standard E or ring core transformer 330Hz
&gt;instead of 50 or 60 would be such a big deal. Sure, lossess due to 
hysteresis
&gt;would be slightly higher, but the risk of saturating the core would
&gt;be less. I have used standard power supply E-core transformers up
&gt;to several kHz without any problem.

Better lend your flamesuit to the guy with the inverter for his first few 
tries at using it.
