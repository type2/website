         On my 181 I have a temp sendor that screws into the same hole that
 the oil pressure odiot-light uses I got it at my FLAPs and as I recall it is
 a VDO part.
         Real easy instaliation 1.disconnect the wire from the existing oil
 pressure sender (unplug the thing) 2. un-screw the sender from th engine 3.
 screw the new sender in 4. plug in the oil pressure and oil temp wires 5.
 start engine, watch it heat up.

Now this is the Sensor instalation that is useless.  No oil actually flows by
or near the sensor so the temp reading is actually one of the case and
surronding atmosphere.  This is a good instalaltion if you only want to see
low readings.  VDO does make sensors that actualy repalce the pressure relief
plugs.  I use these myself.  They are in the full line catalouge.
