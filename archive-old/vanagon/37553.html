Subject: 1967 camper for sale in NC

Howdy. After a big long adventure (see  my post), I have a 1967 camper for
sale. It is in Raleigh, NC, and will immediately need an engine. It is a
project bus that never got finished, so it will take a little to get it on the
road, and a little more to make it a really nice camper. It is a walkthrough
pop-top. There is some rust, but nothing horribly excessive. I am asking $850,
but that is negotiable, as I really need the money to fix up my other 67
camper. If anyone is interested, please get in touch with me for more
details...
Thanks,
