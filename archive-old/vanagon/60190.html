I was very clumsy this morning and just deleted a message and request for
help/advice on a 1984 VW Westfalia in KNOXVILLE TENN,with 71 k miles on
it for sale for 4000.00U.S. ,she wanted to know about  the price,if it
was a good deal,I accidently hit the delete key in my haste to answer,My
answer is ! if you don't buy it I well, and I'm in Santa Rosa, Ca.
landline me at 707-584/1199 and we'll talk about it, if it's as good as
you say ,and goodness can be verified, it's a steal,hope to hear from you
soon, message was written on 20 may 1997.to all recipients, 

                                  Regards, Roy, roy_at_juno_dot_com
