Subject: Re: 84 exhaust prices

I agree that stock exhaust prices are becoming ridiculous, even at our cost
and very thin margin.  However, VAG only offers stainless steel for the 2.1
engine replacements (and it is a poor grade of stainless IMHO).  1.9 is still
being offered in regular (unleaded?), but still at a ridiculous price for the
poor quality outa Denmark (not to mention the crazy Mark/Dollar Exchange Rate
as well).  At Bus Boys, we have recently started to offer a real sweet USA
Made System for the 1.9 (83-85) that comes with a Turbo-Style Muffler
(permanent tailpipe too) which has the O2 Sensor hole and is CAT compatible
(or make yer own straight pipe :-) ).  Price for this system is $346.50
COMPLETE (less CAT which is $174.95 extra).  Header Cage System only (which
ya use yer converter, muffler and tailpipe) is $199.  Turbo-Style Muffler
w/Tailpipe by itself is $147.50 and can be used with stock pipes &amp; CAT.  We
only have the 1.9 style right now, but were workin' on having 2.1 2WD and
Syncro Systems by the end of the summer at the appropriate reasonable prices.
 Would love to make 'em in stainless, but prices were stratospheric
everywhere I checked, at least in a quality grade.  I have a local customer
who installed one of these on an '85 Westy - looks and sounds great and the
local smog guy passed him.  I think I'll put one on my '84 Westy when I get
around to building another engine (spare time? - HA!).

C.A.R.B. be damned - full speed ahead :-)
