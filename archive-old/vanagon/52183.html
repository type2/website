Subject: Re: Plastic flange (was: &quot;Sierra &quot; Brand Acceptable Vanagon

&gt; &gt;out yesterday that I need to replace my flange.  It is dropping a few
&gt; &gt;drips every once and a while from the nut and on the flange.  Is the
&gt; &gt;flange plastic?
&gt; This flange was originally plastic, which was stupid. The replacement part
&gt; is metal. It's a real good idea to replace this part before it breaks or
&gt; starts leaking.
&gt; 
Can someone please clarify which part were talking about here? I'd 
like to check if mine has been replaced?

Thx.
