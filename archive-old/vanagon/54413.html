Subject: Need Front Seats '76 Westi (Faded Yellow or Orange Bus)

Hi all,

The front seats are shot and need stuffing and some repairs around the
edges. Any ideas? I'm located on Long Island, NY.

I've been read'n the list for a while waiting to see some info on
'76ers. I'm not sure what other years are similiar to possibly get junk
yard replacements for seats and other stuff.

I'm impressed with the list quality (people and info)!..Plz don't
flame..Live and let live. Delete quickly and often if you don't like
something.

Best Regards,
Jeff
