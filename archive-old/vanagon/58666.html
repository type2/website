&lt;&lt;  Another idea for someone wanting just one extra seat, would be to use the
 rear-facing theater style removeable/flip up jumpseats out of a '87 up
Wolfs.
 Ed or Carat 7 pass. and mount it behind the pass seat in a westy.
 Easy to put in/ take out, and they have seatbelts attached to the hardware.
 
 these only came in grey velour, tho you could always re-upholster since the
 seatcovers are the same as the front seats. (get a spare front seat and use
 the cover off it)      chris &gt;&gt;

The &quot;Light Grey&quot; velour was the most common color.  The color is almost
identical to the &quot;Grey&quot; velour that my van has as standard.  I added the rear
facing seats in my 87 (emial me if you'd like instructions) and I'm certain
that no casual passenger would notice the difference.  The &quot;Grey&quot; color has
the same color background, but with a small darker grey squares pattern.

They came in at least two other fabrics as well.  1989 Vanagon Carat
Wolfsburg Limited Editions used a bold diagonal pattern, and the 1990 &amp; 1991
basic Vanagons (no GL) used a grey tweed cloth.
