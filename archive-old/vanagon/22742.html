Subject: Saphire I


I've just aquired a Saphire I radio and have no idea of how it works.

Currently my questions are:

a) are the buttons programable?
Ok, probably not, but I had an old radio where you pulled the button out 1/4&quot;
and then pushed it all the way back in to program the buttons.  This one doesn't
appear to do that.

b) where did the light go? 
When I pulled the radio out of the bus, there was a bulb, on a wire, hanging
behind the radio.  Did this bulb go in the radio?

Thanks,
...Markus
