&gt;the late 70's). The guy asked &quot;Were you in the Korean War?&quot; and Hugh
&gt;said yes, he was. They guys said &quot;I wasn't, but my uncle was there, he
&gt;was in the 99th Division&quot;.
&gt;	Hugh thought about that for a minute and said &quot;I never heard of
&gt;a 99th Division in the U.S. Army...&quot;. &quot;Oh no&quot;, said the guy, &quot;My uncle
&gt;was in the Chinese Army!&quot;

when my brother was finishing naval officer candiate school, a required
class was some final paperwork processing, and one of the questions that was
required to be asked was,
&quot;Have you or any member of your family ever advocated the overthrow of the
United States government by force of arms?&quot;

so one guy raises his hand. the instructor nearly freaks out ... all these
people had been through all the training and security classes for three
months! how did this guy slip through?

so the instructor asked WHO in the family was the advocate. the guy says,
&quot;my father&quot;. upon further questioning, it turns out his father was in the
german army in WWII and came over to the u.s. as one of Werner von Braun's
rocket team. :)

Believe it or don't! Truth is stranger than Fiction (because fiction has to
make sense, or people won't buy your books!).
