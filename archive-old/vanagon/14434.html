Subject: Re: Blinking Temperature Light


&gt;So far everything has been fine since the original blinking
&gt;incident this morning.  Does anyone want to comment on
&gt;this?  I know I can't count on you all!
&gt;
If you get an air bubble up front, in the rad or heater core, then as the 
RPM/pump builds up pressure these bubbles get compressed and the water level 
in the reservoir drops, hence the LED. My '87 Syncro does this after a 
couple of miles when I hit the highway if water is low and a bubble exists. 
My '85 panel does NOT have a level indicator, the only time the LED comes on 
is when meltdown is imminent, and the front fan kicks in and the temp needle 
flies to the top.
        Just keep an eye on things, make sure overflow and reservoir bottles 
are properly filled. If it persists, get the system bled. If it returns, 
you've got a leak, costing $$ to $$$$ to fix.  tim s.
