Subject:        Tires

I'm going to be replacing my Michlin XZX 185 R  14's soon and stopped by my
local Costco to see what they had. The only thing they stock is a Uniroyal
AWP Lariat 195 75 14, load range C,  LT tire. $261.70 out the door. They
can order a Michlin XC45 185 R 14 for $365.14 out the door. Anyone have any
expierience with either of these? I hate the thought of not being able to
use the XZX's anymore cause the work so well. Later,

I think you are referring to the: Michelin XC4S, size 185R14, 6 ply load
range C tire. If so I am on my second set. Bought the first set on 06/18/90
_at_ 89,501 miles. Cost with tax was $329.46 complete. My second set went on
03/07/95 _at_ 118,500 miles. Doesen't sound like good mileage but here in the
California Central Valley the sun damage can be brutal. Plus I wasn't as
particular about tire rotation then. This last set was purchased from the
Costco tire dept. The special order took less than a week. Net cost was
$76.13 each plus tax and mounting for a total cost of $357.12. I'm quite
satisfied with the tire and its' bolder and hopefully better off road
traction tread.
