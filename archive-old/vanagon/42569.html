Subject: Fridge problems

I've been fiddling with my 90 Westy fridge for several weeks now.

Runs fine on 12v driving around town. It does not work at all on house 
current or propane.

I've pulled it twice, cleaned up the cumbustion chamber, adjusted the 
thermostat, check to make sure voltage was in the proper places at the 
proper time (as far as I could reckon) and still nothing.

Anyone have any similar problems?  The nearest Dometic dealer is an 
hour's drive away and I'd like to fix it myself if I can.
