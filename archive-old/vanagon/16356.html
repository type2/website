Subject: Re:  Camper tops '68-'71


&gt;The small square pop-tops were only used until '67. After that, from
&gt;'68-'73, the tops hinged from the front, and had a small cot up top.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

the above statement isn't technically 100% correct

actually a 73' bus i had originally came with a samll pop up top *very*
similar to the pre 68' westy's. this van was an aftermarket conversion so i
don't know if it really counts.

also for the sake of discussion, i beleive the samll pop up tops (the ones
that go straight up) were still available in euopre after 67. anyone know
better than i?
