Subject: Gas heater parts?

Hi All,
Well, I did it again, burned up the fan on my BA6.  I'm in the market for 
another if anyone has a good spare.  Please don't refer me to JB or Ark, 
I already know about them and they're too high.

Thanks in advance for any info.  BTW, if you know of a yard that may have 
heaters they'll part out I'd be interested in knowing about them.

Jack
