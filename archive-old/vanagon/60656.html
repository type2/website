Subject: Re: Anti-sway bars

I'd like to hear about experiences  too.   I've just ordered the lowered
springs from BusBoys for our 90 Westy, and will report to the list after
I've installed them.    (...and if that doesn't fix the swaying, I'll put
the heavier anti-sway bars on too, and if that doesn't do it, I'll extend
the wheels out a foot on each side, pour 6&quot; of concrete on the floor, put
55-series tires on, and fill the shocks with motor honey...)
