&gt; Yeah. I'm one of those that feels that dumping cold air on the head of your
&gt; kids in the back seats is NOT nice. I never open the back FRESH AIR vents in
&gt; the winter.  Also, pushing hot air up is cunterintuitive to me.  I leave the
&gt; windshield one closed halfway when I really want to heat the van -- I NEVER
&gt; get fogging -- even with no blower fan (case right now) The air will rise by
&gt; itself eventually -- you don't want to push it there do you?  The &quot;flow&quot; is
&gt; FRESH AIR.  NO HEAT in this air.  Do we really want to push cold air to the
&gt; back of the bus?

I don't have any kids, and I find that the side windows don't fog up as 
much if you keep that arid outside air blowin' across them.

I also tend to open the wing window (triangle) to keep the fogging down.
Those windows do tend to fog up with me huffing, puffing and screamin'
at all the idiot drivers who cut me off.
