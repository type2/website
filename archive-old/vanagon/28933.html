Subject: Upper Ball Joints

Hi All...

I recently tried to get an alignment done on Yertle (84 Westfalia).
I was told my upper ball joints needed to be replaced. The
Bentley manual isn't detailed enough about ball joints
(or at least not detalied anough for my embarrasing--but slowly
improving--mechanical skill level). - so where do I begin?

Any help would be greatly appreciated...:-)
