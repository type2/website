I hollowed out an old sparkplug and made a device to check the TDC mark.
I found an old rod that fit snuggle in the middle of this spark plug and
screwed it into #1 cylinder. I then attached a wrench on the pulley nut
and rocked it  back and forth around TDC while watching the feeler follow
the piston up and down. TDC appeared right on the money .

&gt;wonder how close the pulley mark is compared to the TDC sensor and
digital test
&gt;rig that
&gt;VW uses. (I've also compared two timing lights - same result.)
