Subject: Re: tire rotation on syncro

&gt;&gt;I'd like to begin a 5-tire rotation on my syncro so that I can get some
&gt;&gt;mileage out of my spare. I realize that syncros require identical size tires
&gt;&gt;on all four wheels to prevent viscous coupler damage. Is there any risk in
&gt;&gt;putting my brand new spare on when the other tires have about 10K miles on
&gt;&gt;them?
&gt;
&gt;I don't think so and I sure hope not.  I've just done the same thing on my
&gt;van.
&gt;

With a 27&quot; tire diameter, a difference of 1/8&quot; in tread depth corresponds to
a difference of less than 1% in circumference:

(.250) / 27 = 0.93%

I can't find any specs in Bentley regarding tolerances for tire
circumference on syncro vehicles, but a 1% difference sure doesn't sound
like it would be enough to matter.
