Subject: Westfalia roof vent

     All-
     
     Erik's note about a template for the roof vent (??) reminded me of a 
     question I wanted to ask:
     
     A PO replaced the no-doubt hammered stock item with a 14&quot; square RV 
     type vent.  The muttha' sticks up plenty high and the vehicle will 
     never clear the garage door (even with the air out of the tires, I'll 
     wager).
     
     Since it looks like the hole was enlarged to fit the new vent, there's 
     little if any rational hope in returning to the stock piece in order 
     to regain the clearance.  Has anyone found an aftermarket vent that 
     sits down a bit snugger on the surface?
     
     'Course, if I never clean out the garage, I won't have to feel bad 
     about not parking the vehicle in it!
