Subject: RE: more bus work


&gt;	Also, does anyone have anything to say about using a battery box in
&gt;a bus?  My battery had already chafed part of the paint from its new tray
&gt;off, and rust was starting.   I sanded it, re-painted it, and then
&gt;put down 2 layers of fiberglass cloth and resin in the tray, and up about 3&quot;
&gt;along the walls in there, too.

After discovering corrosion all around the battery area in my 71 (gone 
 now and I miss her) I ground it away and layed down some fiberglass 
 matting then a piece of 1/2 plywood covered by more fiberglass that 
 wrapped up the side of the engine compartment. This worked great and I 
 think I will do it to my new project to prevent the dredded rust 
 through, but you have me thinking that a marine type battery box might 
 br the answer.
