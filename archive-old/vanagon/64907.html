Subject:      re ev poptop raincover

&gt;I have a 1997 Eurovan Camper and I live in the soggy PNW.  I was thinking
&gt;about attaching velcro pads between the inside lip of the poptop and the
&gt;canvas tent.  From this I was thinking about attaching anything from a cut
&gt;and fitted shower curtain to an insullated/waterproof  curtain of some
&gt;sort.  The free end of the curtain would then be bunggied to the window
&gt;from, mirrors, or the base of the van to keep the curtain fairly tight.
&gt;I would probably need to prop the roof up so it doesn't get pulled down.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways,  this is what I was thinking about to better cope with camping in
&gt;the rain and snow of the winter months.  Does anyone else have any
&gt;suggestions, or is their something on the market already?
&gt;

I've had my '95 out in high wind &amp; rain storms in February along the Oregon
coast and it stayed quite dry inside. The canvas is coated with something
to make it more waterproof. Manual (Winnebago) recommends a vacuum or hose
down with a light brush. Dry before folding. And don't use detergents or
solvents that may remove the waterproofing.

But then seeing the other persons comment on the '97 I wonder if they
changed the fabrics or something. Anyone seen both?
