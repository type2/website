Subject: Re: Ecu &amp; Idle Stabilizer
Date: Thu, 9 Feb 95 9:00:44 EST

I had the idle stabilizer replaced on our 82 at a VW dealership in Palo
Alto. The engine would cut out after a high speed run or when driving
around town, even though it would start flawlessly.

I assumed, incorrectly, that the VW dealership would have the diagnostic
expertise and tools to determine the problem immediately. Wrong! They were
more interested in fixing and selling Porsches than dealing with a VW van
(the tech head to his credit immediately replaced the door springs as part
of a VW recall for that year- even though I knew nothing of the recall). 

Initially the VW techs said the problem was a collapsed hose - replacement
cost - 40 dollars (the one from the air distributor to the aux. air
regulator). Problem still exists.

Then they said that the problem was a collapsed air hose from the air
intake sensor to the air distributor. No change and another 20 dollars.

Then they said that the problem was an air leak on the left intake gasket.
No change and the bills are mounting.



Finally  I insisted they swap parts until
they fixed the problem, which they did and at their expense. Diagnosis? A
faulty idle stabilizer and judging from its looks it is made by and for
AUDI. The cost for the part? 100.00 dollars. Labour for all this mess?
another 150 dollars..... The lesson? Don't take your Vanagon to a dealer
with a problem the day before you expect to go on a big trip (we were).
You will be more willing to part with your money for the convenience of
having someone do the work you could normally do yourself or at least
learn to do yourself.

I should also point out that I did  eventually end up replacing all of the
hoses myself and testing all the other FI components and installing a new
full throttle switch, so the level of
technical expertise that I now have is at least on par with most VW
techies. In
other words the learning curve might be steep but its a great investement.
