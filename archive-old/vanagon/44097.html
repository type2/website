Subject: Wipers spring (Westy 85)

Hi,

I have recently buy a wiper spring helper, it's something like a
spring with two hooks that goes around arms. After some try (it's
raining this spring here), it seem to help the wiper to do a better
job. the product is name &quot;sure wipe&quot; and I found it at a Canadian
Tire.
