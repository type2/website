Subject:       Re: ATK/VEGE Engines

I bought a new VEGE engine for my '69, and it's been fine (hey 
musical).

It cost about 550 quid I think, it's a 1600 and I had to provide an 
exchange crank case. Over here, if you don't have an exchange engine, 
they charge about another hundred quid.

As far as I know, they only exchange like for like, they didn't offer 
bigger engines or anything.

I assume we're talking about the same VEGE, they're dutch aren't 
they? Top quality Euro parts anyway.

B ) 'later...
