So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; but I hope at the very least I won't have to crack open the reduction boxes.
&gt; If this trannyis toast, then I will, though :(  The weekend after the big
&gt; trip, I'll yank it out and check the nosecone install - if thats OK, then
&gt; I'll RMA the tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; 	If anyone else has any ideas or experience in these matters, I'm all
&gt; ears!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your patience!
&gt; Thom

This is probably a response that Derek doesn't care for much. ;) But....
Thom, it sounds like I'm going to have to buy several boxes of nose tissue
because I know you're going to have a pretty good sob story to tell on
the way down. :(  ;)  Anyway, I agree with removing everything again but
don't be too hasty in doing so.  Go slow, and kind of talk a stand back
and look at it from a non-judgemental stance.  You may see something that
just sticks out like a sore thumb.  As you've mentioned before, you'll 
probably think of it in the middle of the night and toss-and-turn till
you get it done.  I know this is hard to do since you planned on being
alot further along than where you're at.  I've had many a 2 hour jobs 
turn into long weekends for a variety of reasons.  As the Great Muir
said, perseverance prevails!

Oh well, not much help but.....

Cheers!
