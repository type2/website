Subject: Bus as primary residence...

I'm sure that, like me, many of you have made your Bus your home. At one 
time, it might have been your only domicile ( I lived in my camper for 
two years while working at IBM: much nicer and more flexible than most 
studio apartments...and did I mention *cheap* ? )

Where did you park?

Company parking lot:	Nope, might ruin your chance at advancement due to 
			your close-minded boss.
Shopping center:	Nope, cops wake you up at 2:00 am, thinking that 
			you must be a drug dealer. (I was harassed by the 
			Secret Service because I was parked too close to the 
			airport the night before Bush came to town...) 
Residential street:	Nope, Nancy Neighbor KNOWS you must be a child 
			molestor.
Deserted dead-end:	Hey, I'd rather be harassed by the cops than ....

Best results for me were achieved at apartment complexes--preferably of 
the student variety: less cops, people don't know all their neighbors' 
cars....

Do you have better suggestions?
