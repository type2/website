&gt;makers of the Audi. The name Audi is Latin for 'listen', which is 'Horch'
&gt;in German. The name was suggested by the schoolboy son of Herrn Horch.

The way I heard it was that Auto Union, Damlier and another compnay I 
don't reacl the name of joined together, which also explains the Audi
logo.  I'll try and find it in one of my Porsche books tonight.
