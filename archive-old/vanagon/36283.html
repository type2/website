Subject: Re: 68 vw bus $550 runs &amp; looks great (Concord, Bay Area)


&gt;The engine has a case number of B5XXXXXXXX  Can anyone identify that for
&gt;me?  Is this a Brazilian Bug block?

My '69 bus had one of these when I first bought it many years ago. It
had been bored out for large cylinders by the PO, which I quickly found
out was a big mistake. These B blocks are original German, I believe,
but they are made of an alloy which was slightly more brittle than later
blocks (AE, AF etc.). So when you bore them out, they crack very easily,
and can ruin your whole day. Mine got to the point where it vibrated so
badly it kept breaking throttle springs (?), and blew out all of its oil
in less than 30 seconds through an ever-lengthening crack from the oil
cooler mount to the cam gear bearing mount. It also eventually shot the
#3 spark plug all the way across the engine compartment, but I think that
was a seperate problem.


&gt;The lid did say it had been rebuilt
&gt;13k ago but it sounded kinda rough.  It kept dying at first and then he got
&gt;it to idle but I was a bit uneasy about it.

Could be carburetor, could be valves, could be a vacuum leak (which won't
do the valves any good)... can you do a compression check on it? Also, try
spraying WD-40 on the carb, manifold joints, etc. If the engine changes
speed when you do this, you've just found a vacuum leak. Typical locations
are the throttle plate bearings, the gasket the carb sits on, and the places
where the manifold bolts to the cylinder heads.

Something Bob Hoover once pointed out to me, is the round plug in the throat
of the carb. It's about the size and shape of a dime, or a titch smaller, 
and
is pressed into the carb just above the gasket it sits on. If you open the
rear hatch and look at the bottom of the carb, you're looking right at it.
A hefty backfire can blow this plug out, and then you'll be lucky if the
engine runs at all.


&gt;The electrical seemed good and the clutch/tranny were fine.  The steering
&gt;was way rough.
&gt;
&gt;The cargo section under the rubber was major rusty.  It looks like it was a
&gt;delux with all the chrome trim but....

How major is major? rusted thru in large areas? If not, I'd be inclined to
go for it.

If worse comes to worst, you can put a good used dual-port engine in it, 
with
doghouse cooler, for around $400 and an afternoon's work. Or you can get
a rebuilt long block for around $650 (good one) or $350 (caveat emptor),
and rebuild the carb if it needs it.

If the bus has a floor, pour some motor oil on it, wipe up the excess, put
the rubber mat back down, put some plastic drop cloth over it, some carpet
from the local carpet shop, and hold it down by bolting the seats and belts
over it.

BTW, is there any rust right below the windshield? This is chronic in
Baywindow buses, and can be a b*tch to fix, since the metal carries the
windshield wipers and can be heavily stressed at times.

If the floor's gone, though... Hmmm. Either become real good friends with
a skilled welder, or save your money for a more rust-free one.
