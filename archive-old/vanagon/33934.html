Subject: Just #$%*in' great!


I'm depressed today.

I went out with a few friends last night to dinner, and then on our way 
to a local bar (The Bow and Arrow for Sami and Michael) I was sitting 
behind a Nissan Pathfinder at a light.  When the light turned green, the 
Driver of the Nissan Patheticdriverfinder Threw it into reverse and took 
off like a bat outta heck.  It didn't even damage his car, because the 
bloody rack for the spare tyre protected his panels, but my '85 has 
discovered a few new spots to start working on the rustination project.

Why couldn't this happen to aerostars only?


Cheers
