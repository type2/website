&gt; &gt;&gt; It is poetic justice that he died
&gt; of heart problems stemming from his years of drug use 

&gt;Actually, it was shown that he didn't have much, if any, drugs 
&gt;in his system when he vapor-locked, which proves he died 
&gt;of a drug _under_ dose...

I forget who was quoted after his death, but the quote went something like this 
-

&quot;He was on and off drugs for years, but he never could shake hot dogs and 
cigarettes.&quot;  

Which were probably as much to blame for his heart giving out as anything.  By 
the way, there was a small blurb in USA Today today today (4/8) about the 
ashes/ceremony, etc.
