Subject: Ceramic coating (was Monza (sp?) muffler)

&gt;&gt;I called Jet-Hot coatings, and they told me that they derust and repair any
&gt;&gt;small holes in your &quot;piece,&quot; and ceramic coat it inside and out.  It is a
&gt;&gt;baked-on metallic-ceramic coating that is very resistant to corrosion,
&gt;&gt;heat, and vibration.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for asking, Wolf. If you, or anyone else for that matter, get a
&gt;price quote, please let me know.
