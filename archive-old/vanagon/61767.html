Subject: Fuel Gauge inaccuracy


	My recently acquired '91Westy seems to have an inaccurate fuel gauge, 
	a fact my son and I learned this weekend by running out of gas just
	past the last Gilroy exit southbound on 101 (which, of course, 
	fortunately has a Chevron station clearly visible from the emergency
	call box...). 

	I guess feeblemindedness is creeping in, otherwise I would have 
	filled the tank immediately after the vehicle officially became 
	mine (after dropping off the PO at his home) AND zeroing the trip
	odometer. Somehow, this required act when taking delivery of a 
	new vehicle slipped through the crack and we ended up driving on 
	the PO's tankful.

	So...the fuel gauge shows slightly less than 1/4 full when completely
	empty :-( but the needle will park past the red zone when key is 
	off. Any suggestions on debugging this problem? If it's the sender, 
	I'll forget it until the tank needs servicing; if it's the gauge or
	a resistance/conductivity problem on the instrument panel printed
	circuit motherboard, I can probably fix it...
