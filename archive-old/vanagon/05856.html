Subject: Bosch Platinum Spark Plugs

Hi Folks. Has anybody used these spark plugs in the Vanagons?  My '90
Syncro Westfalia just chews through the stock Bosch Supers (w7cc0).  VW
says 48000 Km or 2 years for spark plug intervals, and after 32000 Km
and a little over a year the plug gap is over 40 thou!  I bought a set
of the Bosch Platinums (wr7cp) and haven't put them in yet.  They are
supposed to be the ultimate plugs, and they will wear 2 - 3 times longer..
..so I have been told.

Anybody have any experience with these plugs?  I picked up a set for
a little over $15 Can. at Canadian Tire.

Thx. Harry.
