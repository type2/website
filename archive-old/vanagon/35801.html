Subject: vanagon shock installation

Good Day Vanagon owners,

Over the weekend I installed KYB shocks on my '86. A fairly straight
forward job which took me about 3 hours to complete. Required tools
included: two 19mm wrenches for the rear shocks, one 21mm wrench
(actually I used a four socket lug wrench, which happened to have a 
21mm), one cresent wrench and one vise grip to do the front shocks.
I also used two jack stands, the VW jack and liquid wrench.

I started with the rear shocks since they looked less complicated 
than the fronts. Removed hub caps, loosened lug nuts and jacked up 
the passenger rear. Removed this wheel and lowered the van onto a 
jack stand but to facilitate the installation of the new shock you 
have to put a jack stand under the swing arm. Soak the bolts with 
liquid wrench and take a little break so it can do it's thing.

With the two 19mm wrenches, the bolts came loose with a minimal amount
of grunting. Remove old shock, see how easy it is to compress it, 
pretty sad state when you thing about it. Now cut the plastic band off
of the new shock, let it expand, now try to compress that bad boy,
just a tad harder than the old one 'eh. I installed the top bolt and
then compress the shock, as it expanded I lined up the lower bolt.
Install the wheel and repeat for the other side.

Now for the fronts, these are a little different since the shock is
inside the coil spring. At the top of the shock is a nut that is threaded
onto the shaft of the shock. I didn't have a 13mm open end wrench to
get this one off so I used a cresent wrench. You have to hold the shaft
from turning with the vise grips. Not much extra space here, but the two
wrenches will fit. The bottom bolt has the 21mm nut which came off with
the four socket lug wrench. At this point the question is, how to get
the shock out from within the coil spring? The answer is down through
the swing arm. The shock maybe stuck here and you have to knock it loose.
Again compress the new shock and let it expand before installing.

Now for the test ride. What a difference!!! The van doesn't dip when you
hit the brakes, entrance ramps don't create that tipping over feeling
and bumps are smoother. Well worth the investment. I got my KYB's from
a FL(foreign)APS and paid $88 for the front pair, and $90 for the rear
pair. KYB's are a gas assist shock and have a life time guarantee.
