&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5. try the circuit out with your new resistor to see if the resistor 
&gt; &gt; heats up excessively, if it does, the wattage rating isn't high 
&gt; &gt; enough and you need to get a higher rating one or hook 2 resistors of 
&gt; &gt; twice the desired resistance in parallel.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This last idea won't work. Putting two resistors of equal resistance in 
&gt; parallel halves the resistance. So the voltage would be too high.
&gt; 
&gt; 
In order to drop the voltage the input should be on the outside of
two resistors in series and you pull the output from the center tap
between the resistors and one side, but I strongly caution these things
will have to be heavy heavy resistors, like 10W or so ceramic
encapsulated to run a wiper motor and even then we are talking some
serious power dissapation ie HEAT, maybe one should actually buy the
volt drop, they aren't that expensive.  A solid state switching device
to limit voltage is definitely a better idea.
