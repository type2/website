Subject: Re: Replacing Propane Regulator

Keeps grit from getting into the regulator. Keeps flying things from hitting
it too.

Hole underneath plastic box is to allow a faulty regulator which is leaking
to leak its propane downward out that hole.

&gt;&gt;I already know the deal about getting the Marshall 290 (cuz they don't make
&gt;&gt;the 260 no more) and trimming the plastic shield.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, no answer to Paul's question. Instead I'd like to know the function
&gt;of the plastic shield. Mine broke off. Thanks.
