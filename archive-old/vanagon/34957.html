Subject: The Bus Life...

When I lived in Humboldt Country up in northwest California I knew a 
fellow who after school was out in the spring would drive his camper 
cross country to Boston/Provincetown and sell it.  he worked in P-town 
during the summer and didn't need a vehicle.  

He made enough to afford first month's rent, food, play money, and a 
plane ticket back to northern california because of the price 
differential between coasts.  He'd then buy another camper and use it for 
the year before driving cross country again.  

He thought it was a great way to maintain positive cash flow...
