Subject:      Re: Eurovan Timing Belt/Waterpump Seize

Did the waterpump seize without warning?  I had a Honda that had a noisy
pump that got progressively worse.  When the noise stopped the pump had
seized :-).  (And self-destructed)

My point is: I'd be surprized to have a pump seize out of the blue and ta=
ke
the timing belt with it.

On my EV the waterpump developed a leak at 41K.  It was recommended to
replace the timing belt as well as most of the labor is the same for both=

procedures.  Got the pump replaced under the powertrain warranty and paid=

the extra $ for the timing belt.
