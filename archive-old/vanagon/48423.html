Subject: Air flow meter box wanted

A guy came up to me in a parking lot because he saw my westy.  He said he had 
an '86 sitting at a nearby gas station and they said he needed a new air flow 
meter box, for $600.  Does anyone have a good used one?  I know I replaced 
mine about 2 years ago for about $125.  Any leads would be appreciated and 
I'll pass them on to him.

Thanks,
Bryan
