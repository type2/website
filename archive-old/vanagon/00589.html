&gt;as i was stealing Hank's account of radiator testing, i got to thinking:
&gt;just what exactly does everybody want in a FAQ??? and should we have a
&gt;FAQ for T1 buses, another for T2 buses, T3, and T4 buses? or by engine
&gt;types (1950-1971, 1972-1983, 1983.5-1991, 1992-?)? or what?

&gt;anybody have any suggestions/desires/complaints/needs? i'm open to opinions.
&gt;(one of these days, i'll learn to keep my mouth shut!) :)

&gt;i haven't been putting the key stuff and the electrical stuff in the FAQ
&gt;cause there hasn't been any real definitive how-you-do-this kinda stuff.
&gt;but that's cause that's the sort of stuff *I* would expect in a FAQ: how do
&gt;i fix this, etc.

&gt;anyway, here's another topic for discussion, thrown to the wolves, as it were.

Hey Joel ....

1st of all, you are doing a great job just doing what you are doing
now!

My $.02 .... I would love a FAQ on known Gotchas in bus buying.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What I know now about '72 T4......&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Keep on keeping on!
