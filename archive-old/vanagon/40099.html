Subject: '69 Westy Engine Advice needed

I know we JUST had a thread about this but PLEASE excuse the repitition -

I need some good advice on where to purchase a newly rebuilt engine for my
'69 Westy.

I am in the process of rebuilding one I have but as I get further and
further into it I *KNOW* that this is not something I want to keep.  The
case is nowhere near nice (chips along the seam, hodgepodge bolt holders
where it mates to the tranny etc etc).

SOOOO, I would like to know where I can get an engine which meets the
following criteria:

1.  Is a 1600 single port, single relief
2.  Is the best &quot;buy&quot; for the money
3.  Relatively inexpensive.  I said RELATIVELY! :-)  I know it is not cheap
but I am not the Franklin Mint here!
4.  May or may not have some accessories (carb,gen,etc)

Thanks in advance.  Lazarus is coming home from the body shop soon and I
would like to get him on the road ASAP.  Also, the best place for window
and door seal would be nice as well.
