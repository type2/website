Subject: Funny noise on 79 Westy and other ??'s

I've been driving my bus around a lot the last couple of days to make up 
for the 4 months of storage I have missed out on. I had noticed it before 
but with recent multiple readings of Muir, wasn't as aware of 
significance of noises in terms of my air-cooled's health.  Three techie 
questions therefore....

1. When coming to a stop from low speeds (ie from second or third gear) I 
have noticed a fairly resounding thunk coming from the rear right of my 
bus. What might this be indicative of? CV joint...boots?  Suspension? I'm 
more curious than worried as the Bus seems to handle fine and it was 
checked out by a reputable VW mechanic just before going into storage.

2. When I go to start up the Bus I get a whirring sound from the engine 
compartment on the second notch of ignition (with the two red lights).  
Is this simply my fan being loud? or does it switch on that early in the 
ignition process?  I can't seem to find any help on this from Muir's book.

3. Tightening the alternator belt on the 79. The Muir book says to loosen
the allen head nut under the plastic cover and to adjust the alternator
body slightly to the right to tighten the belt, then secure the unit with
the retightened nut. But...er...what's the best way to &quot;adjust&quot; the
alternator unit to the right? I rassled with the thing for a few minutes
with my &quot;oversized &amp; guaranteed-for-life-flat head screwdriver&quot;(tm) to
provide some leverage and managed to slide it only incrementally over to
the right, but not enough to really tighten the belt.  Any suggestions on
this? 

Tips and suggestions are appreciated...Thanx
