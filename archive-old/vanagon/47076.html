Subject: another question on exhaust

I've received mixed responses on the urgency of replacing the Cat. 
converter, but at least a couple of people believe that I could cause 
additional damange by not replacing it.  In any case, I would probably 
have to change it if I want to legitimately pass the local emissions 
test. 

So, I'm probably going to replace the converter, muffler, and tailpipe.  
My question relates to the assembly and installation of these parts.  I 
assume I just put the gaskets b/w them and tighten the bolts.  Anything 
to watch out for?  How tight should I make the bolts?  The bentley manual 
doesn't say much except take it off and put it back on (but it does have 
a nice picture).  Most of the bolts seem easy to access except for the 
ones behind the muffler which are related to the muffler bracket.  Any 
tips on getting to those bolts?

THanks for any help.
