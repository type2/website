&gt; Right of the top of my head I would say re-check your valve adjustment.
&gt; Did you use the Bently procedure ? I could be wrong but when I did it
&gt; three years ago there was something peculiar about their procedure. It
&gt; states to adjust #1 then rotate crank 180 degrees CLOCKWISE and go to
&gt; NEXT cylinder. First , what is NEXT cylinder? Second this seems
&gt; backwards to what Muir says in the idiot book. If memorey serves me I
&gt; rotated COUNTERCLOCKWISE and did #2. Any way, if you got two lifters in
&gt; a bind you could have trouble.

    Setting Valves
     Open up the distrubuter. Point the rotor to anyone of the 
     Cylinder. Now watch the crank pulley and turn to line up the 
     timing mark. The Cylinder that the rotor points to is ready
     to be set. Otherwise known as Top dead Center (TDC). Do the
     Same for the others. Can't make a mistake.
