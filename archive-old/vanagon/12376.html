So Sami Dakhlia says:
&gt; 
&gt; Now, parenthetically: last night I attended the monthly meeting of the
&gt; local VW club. Nice bunch of people, although I did not experience the
&gt; warm fuzziness of pizza-eating, Pfeiffer &amp; Red Rock-camping,
&gt; flannel-talking, and Joel-admiring vanagon-listers. I guess, if there is
&gt; one way to stereotype the differences, it would be in the groups'
&gt; representative preference ordering between flannel and bikini strings. :)

That's exactly why I sorta suggested the flannel strip tied to the antenna,
although I did get a good chuckle out of Dave's prune label suggestion.
We ARE a unique group and stickers are all to common.  C'mon you folks,
there's gotta be other ideas!?
