Sounds scammy to me, but for $20 bucks is it worth cutting your fuel line? 
Get a tune up instead.

&gt; Hello:
&gt; In my pursuit to increase gas mileage I came across this item . It is a
&gt; device that fits over the fuel line that reduces emissions and increases
gas
&gt; mileage. Is this a hoax or a scam???
&gt;
