I too will send $$$. More if necessary. Would any others like to see the
list become a newsgroup? This could be the time to address that issue.


&gt;I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt;purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt;cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a T1.
&gt;
&gt;If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt;host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
