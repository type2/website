Subject: Not a bus in sight on Independence Day

OK maybe slim VW content but...

I just went to see Independence Day and I wanted to complain about the lack of 
VW's.  They showed an orange Beetle while New York was being blown up but that was 
about it.  Now usually this is not unusual but in this particular movie they had 
scenes with hundred of campers driving across the desert.  I had hear about this 
scene and figured &quot;what a great oppurtunity to show a bunch of 'long hairs' in 
their splits and loaves camping while the world is being destroyed&quot;.  But not a 
one.

/end rant
