I also have the attachable rain gutters mounted to the side of the pop top.
 Used silicone to seal the holes as well.  I also mounted a Yakima &quot;Gorge
Rack&quot; to the standard Thule rack.  This was accomplished by fabricating
brackets to bolt the Gorge rack to the Thule rack. The Gorge rack is a
vertical rack that is approx. 30&quot; high with 4 or 5 horizontal bars attached
to the vertical bars.  Looks like some sort of funky radio or TV antenna.   I
carried up to 4 windsurfing (AKA sailboards) boards on the gorge rack plus a
bike in a thule bike holder plus two windsurfing masts.  

Total weight = appox. 100 - 120 lbs.  

Problems: the only problem(s) encountered in using this set up for several
years were driving in strong cross winds (usually found at windsurfing sites)
was an adventure.  Loading the boards was also a bit of a chore, usually took
two people one to hold and one to stap them down.  BTW, be careful when
climbing/walking on poptop (no flames please) I stepped on the skylight,
cracking the clear panels which started to leak.

I now pull a 5' x 10' utility trailer with racks inside to carry all of my
stuff.   Much easier.

If anyone (other board heads) is interested in the gorge racks I might be
convinced to part with them.
