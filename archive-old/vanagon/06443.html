&gt;	I am thinking that I have pretty much made up my mind
&gt;just to break down and get a GEX rebuild for my bus.  Does sound
&gt;like the way to go?  Also, would anybody either have the goofy little
&gt;blower things you need to make the gas heater work and the temp sensing
&gt;wiring harness?

Hi Matt, the engine in my bus is from GEX.  I got a long block from 
them last May, and have 15,000 miles on it so far.  The only problems 
I've had can be assigned to operator error, and parts that I took off 
my old engine.

If I were to do it again, of course I'd try to rebuild the engine 
myself(and will when this one comes due), but if you have the $, GEX 
seems like an ok company to deal with.

Every day I learn a little bit more about my bus, but unfortunately, it 
comes at the expense of making me look like a total and complete idiot
