Subject: Friday Fart Joke #2


An old timer goes to his doctor complaining of a rather unique malady...

&quot;Doc, every time I fart it makes a funny noise...&quot;

So the doctor asked...&quot;What noise?&quot;

&quot;When I fart it sounds like 'HONDA'!&quot;


The doctor thoroughly checked out the old timer and couldn't find anything 
wrong, so he sent the old timer to a specialist.

The specialist couldn't find anything either...and sent the old timer to a 
second specialist...who, as you guessed it...couldn't find anything wrong.


After a years worth of traveling to specialists, the old timer was bemoaning 
his tale to the waiter at a Chinese Restaurant. The waiter, after hearing 
the tale, said, go see my cousin Dr. Wu, he will have a cure for you.

The next day, the old timer saw Dr. Wu. After the exam, Dr. Wu said: &quot;Sir, I 
have found your problem....you have an absessed tooth.&quot;

&quot;Absessed tooth? I don't understand the connection with my farts and an 
absess.&quot;

Dr. Wu replied: &quot;Its very simple....Absess makes the farts go Honda!&quot;
