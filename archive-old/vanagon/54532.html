Subject: Re: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling

Heres my weird Vanogan problem-The van-85 Vanogon-150,000miles, about 12,000
since new heads. It runs perfect most of the time, delivering up to 26 mpg on
the highway.
       The weirdness: after Ive been driving at highway speeds for a
while-over an hour-and if its snowing- the engine sputters and acts like its
going to kill but not bad enuf so I cant keep driving. It dosent do this in
the rain or when its dry.I sthis the same as previously mentioned&gt;?
