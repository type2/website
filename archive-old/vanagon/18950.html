Subject: More Junkyard Bugs

Howdy all.  I don't get a chance to post here often cuz well, I don't
have much to say I guess.  Just thought I would tell you all about my
nice afternoon in Fairbury, NE today.

I hit a post with my bug last weekend and dented the door and running
board pretty bad (ouch!) so I was in need of a 72 Super Beetle door (ya
know the one with the squeeze lever with the 2 rounded notches for your
fingers?) so I trekked on over Peitzers auto salvage and found some more
goodies.

Out here in the Midwest, VW Busses are *VERY* rare.  I have only seen 2
running on the road and they were both newer one piece window busses.
In this junk yard was one of the newer busses which is almost all there
minus the engine and a few of the internal items.  It's pretty well
rusted out though.  I did find about 3 to 4 old splittys although they
are all carcasses and minus their engines, and one has the old bullet
style turn signals on the front in tact!  The plastic lenses are cracked
but the housing and all is there.  All the splitties had some kind of
fresh air console unit up front on the ceiling.  I am guessing this was
standard.  One old bus has the split doors on the side whereas the others
were sliding doors and this same bus with the split door had the pop-out
windows all along the side but alas, not a 21 or 23 window (I still want
to find one of those! :-))

I was able to get 4 VW logos off the various
bugs, got my door I needed, a 1963 turn signal, glass headlight cover,
and a 72 wiper motor which I hope works!

There was one fastback carcass, and quite a few type III carcasses but no
Ghia's anywhere to be seen.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a VW_412_S
(?) which is all complete (minus it's VW logo) and out of all these
VW's it was the only one with a COMPLETE engine in it.  I have a hunch
that is why it was there in the first place is cuz of engine troubles.

That just about does it for my afternoon at the junk yard.  Heck, he even
gave me the tools to go out and get my parts I needed!

I believe I'll start hitting these junk yards more often out here in
rural America and see what surprises await me.  It's unreal what you can
find as I am sure many others of you can attest to.

Slater all and keep on postin'...I have learned a lot so far!
