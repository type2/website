Subject: Searching for a '93 Eurovan Westfalia Weekender

Hey volksfolks,

I'm in search of a 93 Eurovan Westfalia Weekender to replace the one I
rolled a few weeks ago.  The weekender (without the stove, etc.) is VERY
hard to find, as they were only imported in 1993.

Please email kndgrn_at_manoman_dot_com if you know of one available for sale.  Or
call 415-626-6626.  I am in northern california, but will extend my search
to the lower 48.  I really like these vans.

Ever evolving and ever hopeful,

Carter
