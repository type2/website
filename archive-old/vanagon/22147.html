Subject: Matt's Yearly Tip


This is my good tip for the year...
 
That one big green book is always talking about
plugging this hose or that hose with
&quot;a suitabley sized cork&quot;.  Well, I am
a few corks short of a full load, so
I just took some plastic wrap, pulled
out the hose, put the wrap over the top,
and plugged it back it.  Instant blockage.
 
I had to do this to check my auxillary air
thingie...
