Notice that it was the 2nd Generation folks that broke the magic 100
mark first. :)  now, as to the Unknown folks, most of you have told me
that you don't have a bus yet :( but there are still some folks that
haven't said one way or the other, so let's get those cards and letters
flowing in. here are the one's that i don't know about (on the list):
