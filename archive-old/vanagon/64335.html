Subject:      rear sliding windows

Hey Helmut,

What would be the possibility of importing some of those windows to the US?

&gt; &gt;Qustion to all eagle eyes:
&gt; &gt;(Before anybody flies to SA) Did you notice that the SA rear windows are
&gt; &gt;bigger than the regular Vanagon and Transporter ones ?
&gt; &gt;But I feel to remember to have seen Campers with rear side sliding
windows
&gt; &gt;pver here, don't know if stock or aftermarket.
&gt;
&gt; In Germany you will get plastic double screened rear slide windows for
our
&gt; Vanagon style body. But we had this thread already, the SA body gets
bigger
&gt; middle and rear windows and is missing the small dent just below the
window.
