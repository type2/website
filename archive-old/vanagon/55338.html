Hey all,
Thanks to everyone for all the advice I've been getting regarding CVs.
The advice is about evenly split between those who say it'll be OK with
a new boot and some grease and those who say &quot;Replace that sucker!&quot;

Her folks have determined that they want to take it to the shop so I'm
not allowed to play with it ;-) but it looks like the question of
replacement will probably be decided by how much excessive wear is
showing on the joint.

Of course, if anybody else still wants to comment, please feel free!
Just send them to me directly so list spots aren't wasted.

Thanks all,
Sean
