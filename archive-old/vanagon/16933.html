Subject: Re: Please don't mix used brake fluid and used oil


Well, I know this is regional but may apply to other areas with municipal
or county recycling.  The recycling program in San Jose permits us to
leave oil in containers they provide for weekly curb-side pick-up.  I
don't know about other fluids.  Other recycle centers around the area may
accept brake fluid, coolant, etc. as well as oil.  I don't have specific
info on the various recycling centers around here, but it's an option 
worth looking into.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Out here in CA (Sillycone Valley), Jiffy Lube will no longer accept used motor 
&gt; oil from drop offs (i.e. people who are just recycling their own waste oil).  
&gt; Brake fluid and anitfreeze contamination has become such an issue that very few 
&gt; establishments accept waste oil from a hobbyist any more in our area.  
&gt; Fortunately, there are a few establishments left in the area, who will accept 
&gt; waste oil in bulk, but they make me feel like I'm some sort of criminal on 
&gt; parole every time I make a dump (10 gallons at a time....  we have 7 VW's)!  It 
&gt; is a sad commentary on just how an irresponsible minority of car owners have 
&gt; impacted the rest of us!  Nur mein zwei Pfennig...
&gt;
