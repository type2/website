Hi all-

Martha's mention of a trip to Tierra del Fuego inspired a lot of us,
especially those who have read Tim Cahill's book Road Fever, about his trip
from the tip of South America to Alaska.  This reminded me of other great
books about wanderlust, which is probably what led all of us to drive VW
campers in the first place.  The first I can remember reading as a child
was John Steinbeck's &quot;Travels With Charley In Search of America&quot;.  Later I
particularly remember William Least Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways&quot; and
Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainence.&quot;  Anybody know any
similar books that I may have missed over the years?
