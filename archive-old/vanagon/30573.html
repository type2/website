&gt;One more thing about my new (old) Westy... I need a windshield to pass

&gt;&quot;recycled&quot; one from those guys out in Michigan (Parts Place in Auburn 
&gt;Hills)...

Hey Anton, Congratulations on your bus!!  I LOVE my 71 westy.  As for
your windshield, the Parts Place in Auburn Hills won't ship
windshields.  I tried last summer.  I was very surprised to find that
the local glass company STOCKED them.  They only wanted $189 to
deliver and install it.  I thought that was a pretty good deal.  I
wouldn't suggest installing it yourself.  I have had two successes and
two failures.  The failures were rather costly.....

On another thought, I was able to pickup two used windshields from
junk yards.  I don't know how much luck you will have in Brooklyn
though...

Now for a thought on your heater cables.  I would also suggest getting
new cables.  They are about $10 each, but can be a pain to put in.  On
my 70 westy, the cable had rusted right through the plastic to the
tube it resides in.  I had to cut this dube in many places until I got
it out.  But, it is nice to avoid those startup exhaust fumes.

Good luck!!
