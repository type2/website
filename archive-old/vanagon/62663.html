Subject: Re: Best Value Auto Clubs?
From: s_j_wacker_at_juno_dot_com (STEVEN G WACKER)

Ivan: I use Wards Auto Club (unless they go bankrupt whith the parent
co). They, like all the rest, offer a lot for the money.  The trick
is....will they come thru when the time comes. I've had this service for
five years, but only used it one time when the battery died on my wifes
car. They responded quickly that time.  As my father used to say  &quot;You
don't need a chain very often, but when you need one, you REALLY need
one!&quot;
