Ok - one last change, and I apologize for all this last minute
wishy-washiness.  I last said that we'd all meet at 5 at the
Marin Brewing Company in San Rafael.  My work schedule for
tomorrow has been a bit pre-empted beyond my control, and I
won't be able to make there until 6, as I'll be unable to
leave Menlo Park until around 4:20 or so, making a quick
stop in Hayward on the way north.  

I'
I promise to get there as soon as I can - you are all still
welcome to meet there at 5, drink on, and I'll join you when
I can.  Go ahead an order supper if you like!  :)

Al Knoll MAY join us there, again not as early as 5.

Thanks for your patience!
