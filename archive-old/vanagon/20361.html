Subject: WTB:'66-'71 type II engine hatch

Hi gang!

I'm in the market for a straight and rust-free '66-'71 engine compartment lid
for Ms. Moneypenny, my '71 Westy.

After purchasing her ~2.5 weeks ago, and having her &quot;prepared&quot; mechanicallly,
I'm finally going to have her in my hands by the end of next week... hooray!

Next on the agenda is to get rid of her bits of rust, including a new hatch, as
her present one is dinged and a tad rotten, which would most probably lead to
inefficient air circullation in the compartment.

Color's not important, as long as its in good, and hopefully great shape. I
will also pay for all s+h.

Thank you!

Scott
Ms. Moneypenny, my '71 Westy
