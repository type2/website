Subject: Bodega Bay


Ok, the response has been profound about Bodega Bay! I'm talking like
maybe 9 vehicles!  Way to go, you geeks!  Now, the verdict is not yet
in on the date, but I wanted to call attention to something at least
one of you pointed out, and that is that Memorial weekend is THE
weekend everyone goes out camping/picnicing, etc., and that everbody
and their brother will be out then (sorry, Brad, that's an &quot;expression&quot;
that we &quot;old&quot; people used to use in days of yore  ;)&gt;  Anyway,
keeping that in mind, I rather wonder whether the first weekend 
in June might be preferable to avoid as many crowds, and to get a
better site.  

Next item on the agenda:  I have maps and am looking at camping
possibilities in the Bodega Bay area.  I know there are a lot of
diehard campers out there with considerable experience, and 
am wondering if someone can give a recommendation for a truly
inspirational location?

In the meantime, I strongly suggest that all of you go out and
rent the movie that made the town famous:  Alfred Hitchcock's 
The Birds.  After seeing that movie, I thought it might be kinda
fun if we all go boating up there on the lake, and see if we
can find the lawyer's house.  I think one can either bring your own
boat, or rent them there, but I'll see what more specifically I
can find out.   Another thing to do would be to visit the restaurant
which is in the movie.  No great shakes, I'm told, but we ought
to be able to pick up a decent bowl of clam chowder there!
