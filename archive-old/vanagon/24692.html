&gt; A nagging problem I have had with my 81 Westy through several engine

&gt; the starter housing seems to overheat the solonoid, causing it to fail to
&gt; engage.  The cure is to crawl under with a tire iron and rap on the case,

My '80 Westy has recently developed this problem too.  Only seems to 
happen on long trips of several hours drive time - not local drives.  If 
heat causes it, do you think it'll stop happening in the winter? ;)
I hope so, cuz I don't think I'll want to crawl under there with my big mo' 
screwdriver in the snow.

I don't know the cure but I've seen other posts about adding an additional 
ford type solinoid (a la Muir).  Might this help our situation?
