&gt; &gt;As far as personalized license plate frames go:  I have a friend who 
&gt; &gt;I kindly refer to as 'the key chain king of Western Canada'.  He has 
&gt; &gt;all the goods to make personalized key chains, license plate frames, 
&gt; &gt;t-shirts etc.  I spoke with him and he said he could put together 
&gt; &gt;anything we may need.  If anyone is interested in doing something 
&gt; &gt;like this let me know and we can find out how much it will all cost, 
&gt; &gt;or if you want you could contact him directly (Jim) at the following

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I ordered a set with my email address. Perhaps I should have put
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Vanagon.Internet.List&quot; or something like that since my email address will
&gt; &gt;&gt; surely change some day (I starting to hanker for a 128K ISDN line).
&gt; &gt;&gt; Moreover, there's no indication that I'm on the list.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Still, anybody on our list who saw a &quot;drew_at_interport_dot_net&quot; licence plate
&gt; &gt;&gt; would know I was on the list, wouldn't they?
