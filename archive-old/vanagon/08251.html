Subject: Re: Hella H4 Headlights


&gt;Regarding those Hella rear fog lamps, I second your opinion; they really can
&gt;be a lifesaver and everyone driving in the CA Central Valley ought to have
&gt;'em.  (and not hooked up as a stop light, either!)
&gt;
&gt;On a related note, the T4 has those two cutouts on the back bumper that are
&gt;meant to house the rear fog lamp.  Ric, have you looked into these?  I 
&gt;think they'd *really* look way-rad back there!

Rear fog lights are compulsory in Europe and they are definitely a good 
thing in dense fog but they are also the cause of my biggest gripe about 
driving. Too many people drive with them on in the slightest bit of mist 
when you can still see for miles or, even worse, in the rain when they are 
reflected off the road  and every drop of rain on your windscreen. It's 
worse than being dazzled by oncoming headlights because the driver is 
usually too stupid to realise they're blinding anyone behind them.
