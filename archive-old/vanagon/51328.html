Subject: Drivability issue--momentary rough idle after long drive

        I recently drove my van on a 75 mile trip to and from Madison, WI
and did 65-70mph most of the way.  A couple of times when I would slow down
to a stop the engine would sputter, the tach would drop to zero and back to
2000rpm a few times and then everything would just go back to normal idle
at just under a 1000rpm. The engine never stalled.  This whole scenario
would last maybe 5-10sec.  BTW this is on a 90 Vanagon Multivan.  This was
about a week ago, and I have drove it every day since without this
happening again.  My daily trips are only about 8-15 miles.  Anybody got
any ideas of might of been going on.  Again this would only happen as I was
decelerating from like 70mph.
