This is non-VW, bus it is, if you know the whole story.

To you Dilbert fans, this may be familiar.

My previous boss, with whom I disagreed almost violently on VW email,
was recently promoted to, read for this?

Director of Product Engineering.

Spell it out. No joke.  This is dead serious, but to funny for words. 

ROFLMAO!!!
