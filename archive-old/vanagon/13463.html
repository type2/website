Subject: Re: Cut off Jets

&gt;Just had my van back from the shop after a tune up (82 air 
cooled,2litr,twim carb)
&gt;It seems that one of my elecromagnetic cut-off jets is not working. Muir says
&gt;they are a waste of time and can be replaced by a screw in jet.


They were put in to prevent 'dieselling on' when the carbon crud in your 
cylinders keeps igniting the gas (thus spinning the engine) that would get 
sucked through otherwise. Put a screw in first, shouldn't affect anything, 
just use a short one with a seal/gasket/silicone goo. Then by cut-offs if 
needed. 
        Which carbs do you have on? All models in Canada since '75(?) have 
had fuel injection. Is this the 'factory equipped' setup, if so what kind of 
mileage are you getting? thanks   tim s.
