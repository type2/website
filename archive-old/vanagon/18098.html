Terry,

Regarding clogged brake lines, you may wish to consider installing stainless
steel lines and using silicone-based fluid.  The alcohol contained in regular
(DOT3) brake fluid absorbs moisture, hence the need to replace it every few
years.  Failure to do so eventually produces rusty brake lines.  The silcone
stuff contains no alcohol; it has no periodic replacement requirement.  And
of course, the stainless steel lines don't rust.
