Subject: RE: vanagon brakes

Yes, yes!  I have symptoms identical to W. Davidson's -- as if the brake
vacuum boost is too strong, so the pedal hits a stop.  My workaround has been
to plug off the vacuum boost and exercise my right leg.  The problem survived
replacement of the master cylinder.  I am waiting till I see what happens
with FI rather than carbs; I've been hoping that the carbs produced too much
vacuum.  Would appreciate any insight that helps determine whether a new
brake booster is in my future.
B.
