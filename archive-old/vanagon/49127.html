Subject: Re: ??? Vitamins Below Retail ???

Let me gently explain something here.  I happen to be on this recipient 
list not once, but twice.  Many of you hate to receive this kind of 
spammed garbage, I hate it doublely this week I can tell you.

The ONLY way to stop this is:
DO NOT REPLY
-or-
if you feel the need to reply try to figure out how to reply ONLY to the 
original sender, NOT the sender and ALL the recipients as you all have 
been doing.. jamming up mine and many others mail boxes.
-and/or-
forward the post to postmaster_at_ or webmaster_at_ domain name of the SENDER 
ONLY.. this will get the people in charges attention .  This is my tactic 
with this garbage
