Tom,

I noticed the same thing on my '90 a couple of years back (had to
replace the a/c drain pan).  I simply fashioned a couple of thin
aluminum plates (about 3x5x0.125) to go between the bolt heads and
plastic cover.  This way the weight of the a/c and cover would be spread
away from the cracks; no problems since.  I never did look into VW
springing for a fix, or reimbursement of my fix and a new drain pan,
since I bought the van used...for a song from a Nissan dealer, no less,
who had no idea what to do with the beast.  But that's another story.
