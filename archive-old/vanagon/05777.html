Subject: Metalic Brake Pads =&gt; Squeek!

We DID have the rotors turned, well tried to, but they were out of 
tolerance and had to have them replaced. I took it back to them 3 times 
over the next 3000 miles to kill the squeek, but nothing worked. Finally 
had to have the pads replaced. 
Looking back, the point of the thread has been lost - this is about 
metalic pads on Westfalias.
