Subject: Re: Best place to buy a bus

There seem to still be plenty of old busses out here, although you have 
to watch out for rust here too.  They tend to migrate toward the beach as 
they get older, and the salt air can have the same effect as road salt, 
except slower and in different places.  My favorite place to shop is the 
Auto Trader.  I could send you some sample prices if you like.

&gt; My '77 bus is starting to have some serious corrosion problems.  
&gt; She's been here in Illinois for most of her life, and the salt and 
&gt; rain are taking their toll.  So, I've been contemplating taking a 
&gt; plane somewhere out west and finding a bus with considerably less of 
&gt; the red stuff.  Does anyone out there know what the market is like 
&gt; for busses in places like San Diego, Phoenix, L.A., Alburquerque, and 
&gt; elsewhere out there?  Does anyone have any suggestions on the best 
&gt; place to go?  Also, are the classifieds the best place to seek out 
&gt; these vehicles, or do you know of other places to look when shopping? 
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, as far as colors go, my bus (Matilda) is beige and white 
&gt; with various graffiti covering the whole of it.  She also has some 
&gt; Texas longhorns mounted on the front below the windshield.  She draws 
&gt; alot of attention.
