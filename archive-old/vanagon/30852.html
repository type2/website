Subject: Many Thanks to all: Lola's Steering Wheel is off (an onagan..)

Thanks to everybody who responded to my steering wheel problem...

The wheel was too tight to knock with a rubber mallet, as some had
suggested, and it already has enough cracks in it which will have to be
repaired eventually...

I went to Hi/Lo here in Austin and picked myself up a 6&quot; gear
puller....with two twists of the puller the wheel came right off... so much
for the guy at Austin VeeDub who &quot;wrestles&quot; his off, taking (as he says) up
to half of an hour -- screw that!

Once again, thanks everybody!

J89
