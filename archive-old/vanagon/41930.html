Subject: '84 Van misses when hot

Hi Folks -

My '84 van starts fine and runs strongly, except when in traffic after 
an extended stretch on the highway.  Then it seems to want to hesitate 
and die, until I get it back up to cruising speed.  I haven't done any 
FI system checks yet, but wonder if this is a common symptom and if 
anyone has pointers on what to check first.  

Related idea, I wonder if this is a symptom of things getting hot in the 
engine compartment and confusing/upsetting one of the FI sensors.  It 
bugs me that the only engine area ventilation (that I can see) is 
outside air pushed/pulled thru by vehicle motion.  Has anyone 
experimented with adding a booster fan to increase the airflow thru the 
engine bay?  I'm thinking of a 6&quot; axial fan in the 2-300 cfm range (eg 
Rotron &quot;Major&quot;), mounted at the bottome of the inlet air duct and aimed 
towards the engine bay, controlled by a 120F thermostat switch... or 
something like that.  Ideas?
