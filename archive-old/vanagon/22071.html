I was in this club and went to the first three shows, missed #4 being up here
in Minnesota and will miss #5.  This is always a good show and has grown
every year.  #3 was held in a double screen drive-in theater on the far east
side of Columbus, one side for the show and the other for parking.  #4 was
held there,too.  They said the they outgrew the drive in at that show.  This
one should be REAL good.  Sorry I'm going to miss it.

P.S. The one in Dayton is at usually at the Harrah Arena and I'm not sure
what weekend that one is.  Two years ago it was the same as Central Ohio's.
