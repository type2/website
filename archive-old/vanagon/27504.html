 I thought this might be of interest, considering the &quot;forever car&quot; thread
 of earlier today.....

&gt; Technology - Mercedes could have fuel-cell car by 2000 - Anthony Lewis
&gt; {(photo of a small 2 door coupe. Much like the Smart body type.)
&gt;  MERCEDES A-CLASS: fuel-cells able to fit even the smallest models.}
&gt; 
&gt; STUTTGART - Daimler-Benz is optimistic about the development of its
&gt; revolutionary now fuel-cell vehicle and has said it will present a
&gt; smaller system next year.
&gt;      Research director Michael Kraemer said he was confident Mercedes
&gt; would eventually produce a fuel-cell car and was expecting to make a
&gt; decision about production before 2000.
&gt;      Daimler has reduced the equipments size by a factor of four but
&gt; its aim is to shrink the fuel cell by a further two thirds with the
&gt; intention of fitting it in any Mercedes including the A-class and
&gt; Smart. The biggest problem remains cost as the price of a fuel cell
&gt; vehicle is many times higher than one using a comparable petrol or
&gt; diesel engine.
&gt;      The company is working on the project with Ballard Power Systems
&gt; of Canada which makes the fuel cells. The technology works by passing
&gt; hydrogen through polymer cells which, with the aid of catalysts,
&gt; convert it to water. In the process it generates electricity which
&gt; powers a motor. Unlike normal car engines, the process has no
&gt; combustion or moving parts and is emission free and noiseless. It is
&gt; also more efficient than a Petrol or diesel engine.
&gt;      There is nothing new about fuel-cell technology, but its
&gt; application has been limited to submarines and spacecraft due to the
&gt; size, weight and cost of the system and the problem of storing
&gt; sufficient hydrogen. Daimler's first prototype system filled the
&gt; entire van it powered.
&gt;      Daimler is considering using methanol, a liquid derived from a
&gt; variety of sources including natural gas and plants, as a convenient
&gt; way to store hydrogen. When passed through an on board converter, the
&gt; methanol is split into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide
&gt; is not toxic but is said by scientists to be one of the main green
&gt; house gases.
&gt;      The vehicle produces one-third less C02 than a conventional one,
&gt; however, and if the methanol is produced from plants, it only gives out
&gt; the C02 the plant absorbed while it grew.
