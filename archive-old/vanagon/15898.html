Jim,

I don't have any info offhand, but I would start with a Hot VW's mag or a VW
Trends Mag, I'm sure there's a source, such as Fast Freddy or CB
Performance, that can get them.  It's true the shaft bushings wear, maybe
try it yourself?  Knock out the bush, install something from a metal supply
house and drill &amp; ream to fit?

Sincerely,
Eugene
