Subject: 2 month trip to Florida
Date: Tue, 14 Nov 95 10:17:59 EST


Thanks to everybody who sent me recommendations on campgrounds
and places to visit in Florida. If my plan holds we'll be leaving for
our two month trip tomorrow, driving the almost 40' combination of
Westy and catamaran down the US east coast. The weather forecast looks
grim (snow storms here in the north east), but I hope they will
keep at least the major expressways open, and we look forward to
reaching the more pleasant temperatures in the south.

If I can get email access somehow during the trip I'll keep you
posted about any adventures that happen. Otherwise, thanks again
for the advice, and I'll get back with a trip report in two months
or so.


All anxious to go,
Martin, Choh Man, '82 Westy diesel and Hobie 18.
