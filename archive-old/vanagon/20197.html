Subject: Re: ' Westy waterpump/fridge relay * update

&gt;I think I've finally gotten this thing sorted out, with the help of a few
&gt;of you, especially Derck.     The   relay is an ordinary relay and must be
&gt;good for at least 30 amps as it must switch the fridge power.  The relay
&gt;is for making sure the fridge only works when the ignition is on.  The
&gt;power to the water pump bypasses the relay to allow the water pump to
&gt;opperate any time.      So there, not so complicated after all.  Why is
&gt;there not a wireing diagram of this in the workshop manual ?  

The wiring is documented somewhere, I am sure of it, although not in some
versions of Bentley. I think the wiring is probably shown either in the
special wiring microfiche or in the printed wiring manuals available from
Dyment, or both.
