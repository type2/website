Subject: Re: parts


What BULLSHIT!!! Parts available only by region!!!! Your parts
manager must be one lazy SOB!!!

ALL VW parts departments are on line to the Regional Distributor
network....which is in turn on line to the National Distributor
network. Yep, it takes that lazy SOB a little work like
typing in a part number and getting an immediate reply
that there is nothing in the local inventory...then a
slightly delayed reply that a part is/is not available
in the Region....and yes, if he puts in a national
search, he may not get results until the next day...

But &quot;regional parts shortages&quot; is bullshit. My parts manager
has found me parts for the '56 ferchrissake...he took the
time to do the search. I guess your parts manager's world
ends in his little cubbyhole.
