Subject: Engine out routine
Date: Thu, 27 Apr 1995 11:48:13 -0500 (CDT)

I tried this yesterday but maybe it was too specific or confusing.  I 
have done that before.  If a person were pulling a motor from a '71 
bus could someone please tell that person everything, tranny and 
shifter related, which can only be done with said engine out.  I do 
know obvious clutch parts, etc.  I would like to see how close I can 
get my shifting to new stock.  I am hoping there is much room for 
improvement here.  I have only driven one VW bus and it sure does feel
loose and tight in all the wrong places.  Ideas?  Thanks, Jim
