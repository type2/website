Subject: Should I Buy

I had a '86 Vanagon GL, loved and hated it to death.  I had to sell it to 
pay for school last November.

However, since then, I got a real job, make a wee bit more money, and am 
in desparate need of another VW Van.

I found a 1993 Blue Eurovan GL, pretty nice shape, 30,000 miles, auto 
trans, one sliding windows.  They want, $15,800, should I finance my life 
away and get this thing.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
