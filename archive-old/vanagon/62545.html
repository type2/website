Subject: RE: Need help identifying ground wire in engine bay

&gt;The ground strap normally connects to a boss on the left cylinder head near
&gt;the hose connector at the top back of the head - near the water pump.
&gt;(This is
&gt;under the A/C bracket.) A metal coolant line is tied down with the same bolt.

Tom,

Thanks, this will give me something to start with.  The piece of strap that
remains is still attached to the top of the cylinder head, the other end is
just dangling down toward the front of the engine.  I will look to see if I
can find were the other end of this strap was attached which should near
the ignition coil.  I purchased a new strap from the dealer last night
($22) and it was described as an ignition coil ground strap (a little
misleading in that it is not attached to the coil, right??)

Thanks a lot

Tim
