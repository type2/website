Subject: Removing T4 valve guides!!!

I can't get the darn valve guides out of my T4 1700cc heads!!  The 
intake guides are within specs, but the exhaust guides are way out so 
I am going to remove them and replace.  I have tried to bor one out 
and then hammer it out with a steped drift, heated to 300F and then 
tried agian. Didn't budge!! Then I tried to tap the rocker side with 
a 3/8 inch tap and thread a 3/8 inch bolt in it so I could put a 
drift down the guide and hammer on the bolt in order to stretch the 
guide and break it loose, Didn't budge. Heated, retried, didn't 
budge.  Now I am very frustrated. Any hints or help would be 
worshiped.
Thanks
