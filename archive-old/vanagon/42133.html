&gt;How's a 1989, GL, 63k sound?  Did they make a syncro with the jumpseat /
&gt;table arrangement?  Thanks for any help.

An 89 would be a very good choice in the Syncro.  In 1990 &amp; 1991 I believe
they only made the Syncro in two models, the Camper GL and the base Vanagon
Syncro.  While the Camper GL had all the comforts of home (sink, stove,
refer, etc) the base Vanagon Syncro was kind of a stripper model.  It did not
have armrests on the front seats, fresh air ceiling vents in back, carpeting,
etc.  But it did have the rear facing jump seats, although no table.  If you
could live without some of the niceities, I think you could add a table
without too much fuss.  Personally, I could not live without the front seat
armrests, but I suppose those could be added too.

Good luck,
