     AMAZING 2-for-1 SALE!!! Need to get rid of a 1964 van with camper
   interior. Needs body work but mechanically sound...best of all, a new
        1600dp motor and lots of extra parts.(this would the perfect
    first-timers project)...BUT WAIT, THAT'S NOT ALL... if you buy this,
   I'll throw in this 1982 Vanagon Diesel van at no extra charge! (needs
    tires and TLC, but the body is very straight). First $1000 takes all
   and you must arrange movement. Both vehicles have clear titles and the
     '64 has current tags. (I might also consider a trade for an early
                  beetle[running] or a good 17&quot; monitor+$)
