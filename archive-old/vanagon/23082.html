&gt; &gt;&gt; I have tried Castol 40 following the recommendation of a VW mechanic and
&gt; &gt; in terms of pressure and oil temperature there was no difference between
&gt; &gt; it and 20W50. The only noticeable difference was at cold startup - the 40 took
&gt; &gt; much longer to &quot;run through the system&quot;. I was also told that 30W should
&gt; &gt; be used at engine break-in (500 miles)...which I followed, then switched to
&gt; &gt; 10w30 (for 1000 miles) then 20w50/5W50 (for 15000+ miles).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With today's quality multigrades why would anyone want to use a single weight
&gt; &gt; oil?

&gt; 
&gt; Well one reason is that the viscosity extender additives, that keep the 
&gt; oil from thinning under higher temps, aren't really very effective 
&gt; lubricants (I think they're some sort of polymer), and in the extremely 
&gt; wide range multi-vis oils can sufficiently dilute the oil to the point 
&gt; they impair efficiency.  I've read some stuff to the effect that you 
&gt; should avoid products such as 15W50, 10W40, etc. for this reason.  Of 
&gt; course there's potentially a trade-off.    Operating out of the recommended 
&gt; temp range also impairs lubrication:  Too hot, the oil thins and doesn't 
&gt; coat adequately to protect;  too cool and the oil can't penetrate the 
&gt; tighter clearances.  Personally, I find that with 4 changes per year 
&gt; (3,000miles / 3 months) I can avoid using the extreme multi-vis products.
