Subject: FS: Golf/Jetta headlights (non-Van)

I'm selling my used, but in good shape, headlights off my '87 GTI.  They
are the stock &quot;aerodynamic&quot; style.  I'm asking $60 apiece or $100 for both
including delivery.  I'll consider other offers (but lets be reasonable).
Let me know if you or anyone that you know is interested.  Thanks.

James
