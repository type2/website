Subject: End of Summer Run
From: drifter888_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Drifter)

Hey all!  
 
Been lurkin a spell here but thought I'd jump up again! 
 
Just a reminder... ABATE of Oregon (Washington County Chapter) is having a
run Sept 20 thru 22nd at Hornings Hideout in the North Plains - Pumpkin
Ridge area (West of Portland). Live music Friday and Saturday, Saturday
evening being the local group Reckless Abandon - I hear they are a killer
band! 
 
Bike games on Saturday, kids games to so bring the young 'uns along. We are
at a 40 acre site with campsites, fishing, swimming, paddleboats, all that
good stuff. 
 
This was a great run last year and we expect it to be even better this
year. For the record, ABATE is not just a bunch of Harley riders, either.
Yea, we have Harleys at our meetings... but there's also the Hondas,
Nortons, Ducati's.... you name it!  It ain't  WHAT you ride, or even IF you
ride. It's the love of motorcycles and out freedom that brings us all
together! 
 
Come on down (or up, whichever) and join us for the End of Summer Run. Have
some fun, meet some good people, and just enjoy yourself!! 
 
Advance tickets $16, at the gate $20 (drop $5 from the price if you're an
ABATE member). I have tickets available if you want them. 
 
See y'all there!!
