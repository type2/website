NuBus Update ('82 Oil Burner {and leaker})


Had a new muffler installed today. It was a NAPA muffler
from my FLAG for $133.00 installed (American). Lifetime
warranty. 

Got an estimate for the oil leaks...Between $190 and $250
for the 3 &quot;front&quot; seals and valve cover gasket. This seems
a little lower than Steve Smith's 8 hour estimate. I'll
get it done on Wednesday.

btw (Steve Smith mostly)...Vaughts (the FLAG) doesn't do 
the diesel auxiliary heat. 

no rhymes, no songs, no nuthin but VW stuff ;-)
