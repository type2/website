&gt;In The Biggest Little State in the Union (RI), the only *permitted*
&gt;stickers are the state inspection sticker. Of course I've got 2 town issued 
&gt;beach passes and a local resident transfer station pass. So in my case,
&gt;I'm already 3 over the limit for the font window.

Beware! ... The STICKER POLICE will get cha!!!  ;)
