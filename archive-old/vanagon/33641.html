Subject: Terrible milage in an '85


Hello all,

I used to read this list, but I haven't been around for quite some 
time.  Now I'm back with a problem.

I have an '85 Vanagon with about 192k miles.  I bought it w/ ~146k and I 
have always consistently gotten 20 mpg, no matter what.  Recently, 
however, my mileage has been horrendous (~6-10 mpg).  With a smaller 
mileage drop, I might think that it was burning too rich, but with 
this massive mpg drop I fear that I might have a fuel leak!  

I don't really know where to begin with this problem.  I'll check the 
plugs tonight.  Even if they're black, I still find it hard to believe 
that I could possibly be burning _that_ rich.

Any and all help would be appreciated.  E-mail is prefered, as I am not 
currently subscribed and I only read the list from the web.


Thanks,

Ben
