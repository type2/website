Subject: Vanagon Heat Vents - Update

Hi all,
Last week there was a little discussion about getting heat from the dash
vents (not the defroster vents) in Vanagons.

I stated that 87 &amp; earlier vans could only produce non-heated air from these
vents, and that heated air from these vents was a feature that began with the
1988 models.

A couple of people wrote to prove me wrong.  I've gathered a little more info
and can say with a little certainty that this change was made in mid 1987.
 Here's what I know about some 87s and their dash heat

My (Jim Davis) 87 Syncro: VIN 007589, No heat, USA model
A friends 87 Wolfsburg: VIN 050426, No heat, USA model
Dave's 87 Wolfsburg: VIN 060438, Has HEAT, USA model
Tim Smith's 87: VIN 069457, Has HEAT, Canadian model

&gt;From these four data points it appears that between #50426 and 60438 they
made a change to allow heat from these vents.

Any other 87 Vanagon owners want to add a few more data points to test this
hypothesis?  

If so, just send me the last 6 digits of your VIN, the country of original
sale and whether or not your 87 produces heat from the two vents on the face
of the dash.

Regards,
Jim Davis
87 GL Syncro
88 GL Wolfsburg
