&gt;Hi Everyone.  The 2.5 litre engine in the Eurovan is an Audi diesel

        Here's a point for someone to clarify for me,  as I understand
(having driven a heavy truck (18 wheeler, realy a 22 wheeler, but whose
counting) and owned several diesel autos and light trucks).  All diesels are
direct injection,  the fuel is injected into the individual cylinders by a
single (noisey) injector located roughly where a spark plug would be placed
(1 per cylinder) if the engine were gasoline powered.  My point is this,
what does direct injection mean?  Quite bluntly, I think that it is nothing
but add-hype.

        Next question,  has anyone put a turbo diesel (off of a VW Qunatum)
into a diesel Vanagon.  It looks like it will bolt right in, any special
proublems to get ready for?  I don't plan to do this right-away but I found
out that a differential for the car will cost more than the car did, and the
van is begging for a turbo.
