Subject: Re: diesel fuel line

Your sources are wrong, the line from the fuel filter to the injection oump
on a diesel is not pressurized. Unless you are considering the suction from
the injection pump as a negative pressure. You can use any good quality fuel
line. Make sure the ends are tight, if the connections let in any air it
could mean trouble. The clear line is helpful in that respect, you can see
air bubbles in the line.

&gt;While installing my rebuilt starter today, I noticed that the fuel line

&gt;mounted to the pump.  I tried cutting it and reattatching it but it was 
&gt;too brittle. The local FLAPS told me that it was &quot;too high pressure&quot; for 
&gt;anything they carried.  So I called VW.  The parts guy said that this 3 
&gt;foot plastic tubing would cost me $39.40!!!! He also said that it head 
&gt;&quot;special metal ends&quot; on it which mine does NOT have. SO my question is, 
&gt;would it be a problem to run a length of regular diesel braided fuel 
&gt;hose, like the ones that run between the injectors?  Right now I have 
&gt;some rubber non-vw hose which Ive clamped on. Its working fine now, but 
&gt;Id rather have the better line.  Any ideas?
&gt;Do any diesel owners have the linethat the VW guy was talking about?
