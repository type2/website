Subject: 	Shore cooling

Hey now,
        Ok, folks. Time for me to show my ignorance and let some of y'all
clue me in.
        I'm thinkin' about this long trip to Inuvik in the middle of the
hot summer, and I'm thinkin' about how nice it would be to have AC. Of
course, I don't want to run it off my poor little old DP1600, so I'm
thinking shore power. Maybe a window mount unit, or one of those RV units
that sit on top. The other idea is a small generator to power the dumb
thing. Maybe in that left hand corner of the engine compartment which is
empty at the moment.
        The most obvious drawback to this is the heat from the generator,
I'd probably want to somehow vent it to the outside rather than let my
engine draw cooling air from it.
        This is more theory than anything else, as I seriously doubt I'll
have the cash to do this, and am not even sure if I would do it given the
cash. But theories are fun to kick around. How big a generator would be
needed for this? Would it fit in that little space? How much gas would it
suck up? Any other comments? Have at it boys and girls...

Peace,
