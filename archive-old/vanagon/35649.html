Subject: It's the CV (was: I shift; bus don't go)

Well, chalk one up for the idiot factor. The CV I repacked last Fall came
loose; that's what caused my problem today. I guess I didn't torque the
bolts/screws tight enough. Can't imagine that being the case, but obviously 
it's so.

Well, I lost two of the bolts/screws out of it and several of them seem to
have damaged threads. I'll check the local hex-head bolt vendor and see
what I can come up with. Fortunatly, nothing LOOKS damaged...except,
perhaps my confidence in other repairs I've performed. ;0 (Guess this 
makes a good case for going back and double checking reparis from time to 
time.)

Thanks for all the good tips. I'm glad all the expensive ideas were off base.

8) Joe
