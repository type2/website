Subject: Re: Pushrod tube seal question


Thanks, David.  The fit on the tubes w/seals, both old and new, was so 
snug that using a well rounded off vice grip was the only way to remove 
them.  Who knows how long they'd been in there.  I knew I was dealing 
with VERY SOFT metal, and was careful not to nick or crush the tubes.  
Installation went very well, with a solid thunk, as each tube found it's 
way home.  I was also careful to make sure that the spring wire was 
correctly situated.  

I plan on using Bob's idea of Loctite Ultra Grey this weekend to staunch 
the flood and will let the list know how I do.

Thanks again,
Jack
