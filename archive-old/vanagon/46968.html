Subject: Mis-delivered mail.

Yesterday AT&amp;T WorldNet(sm) Service experienced some difficulty delivering 
some E-mail messages to our users. It is likely your message was misdelivered 
to the wrong person and did not make it to the intended recipient.  If 
possible, you may want to resend your message. The recipient name and the time 
it was posted to our E-mail servers are detailed below.  

To assist you in determining which message was likely misdelivered, we're 
providing you with the Message ID generated by your mailer below.
Understand that different E-mail packages will produce different headers
which means you may or may not be able to see the message ID.
