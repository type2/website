Subject: F.S. '90 Westy AT 85k $11,900 RV Dealer

OK, heres one for all you big spenders. A local RV Dealer has just got in on a
trade for a new Rialta Eurovan RV (how do those things get out of their own
way?) ,a '90 Westy - burgundy w/ grey velour int., AT,A/C, wheelcovers(not
alloys, though I'll sell ya some-shameless plug :&lt;)  85k mi. one owner (i met
these people when they still had it  it was ANOTHER older couple and of course
the van had to be spotless (why do old people have to take such good care of
their vehicles!) Anyway he said everything worked, and that it had been dealer
serviced. The RV dealer,                    &quot;All Seasons RV&quot; located in Easton,
Pa (right on the border of NJ and PA) said they were looking to get around
$11,900 for it . I'm not really up on those '89-'91 Westy prices, but if i were
interested ( i'm &quot;interested&quot; in it , but then again I'd be &quot;interested in a
classic Mercedes Gullwing too- neither of which i have the $ for)  I would try
to talk them down on the price. 
Their phone # is (610) 253-7700
good luck to all, 
chris
