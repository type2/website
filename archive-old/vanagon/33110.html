Not VW related but owned one at the time...


Years ago...
Just got the '85 Toyota PU out of the body shop after a minor accident and
stopped at the Circle K for requisite Thirst Buster etc. Some one came
running in shouting &quot;Does anyone in here own White Toyota PU?!!!&quot; I
responded in the affirmative. &quot;Well your truck just rolled down the driveway
just missing other cars, pedestrians, gas pumps and is now in the middle of
24th St. blocking (rush hour) traffic!!!&quot; Holy Smokes! luckily no damage to
anyone or anything. I coulda swore I left it in gear, with the E brake on!
(DOH!)
