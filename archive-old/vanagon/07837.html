Seems to me that all air-cooled VWs (at least all those I've been in) have
that problem with stinking heat. Nevertheless I felt uneasy about the idea
of sniffing in carbon monoxide. So I stuck one of those CO detectors on
the bottom of the windshield above the defrost vents. The detectors are
supposed to change color if CO is present. Cost about $5 and I got mine at
Walgreen's.

Also: I believe that the problem with smelling air can be reduced if you
make sure that the big foam seals all around the engine compartment is in
place and if you otherwise make sure that no air from beneath the engine
gets sucked back into the engine compartment and hence into the heater
fan.
