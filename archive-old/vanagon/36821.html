Subject: 74 Westy Cold Weather Problem

To the VW Collective;

I could use some advice concerning a long time problem with the old bus. 
 When the engine is cold, it runs really rough until it warms up.  It feels 
like it just isn't hitting
on all cylinders.  The idle is rough and unstable, and when
driving, it doesn't seem to have any power when you shift.
Especially when shifting from first to second.  After shifting into second 
and releasing the clutch, it just seems to not want to go unless you nurse 
the gas petal a little bit.
It also loves to stall at the first few stop signs you get to.
After the engine warms up good, everything is fine.  It runs great, feels 
strong and powerful.   By the way, the colder it is, the worse the problem 
is.


Here is the setup:

1800 cc pancake
Weber 2 barrel progresive
Bosch 009

Here is what I've done:

New fuel pump &amp; filter
New plug wires (Bosch Silcone)
New Coil (Bosch Blue one)
New Plugs, points and condensor
Reset the Timing
Adjusted the Choke (even tried it disconnected)
Replaced Air filter
Adjusted the Valves
Said a few choice words at it that I wouldn't say in front
of my mother!

Nothing seems to help.

Is this just the nature of the beast or is there a cure for this behavior? 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

TIA
