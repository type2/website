Subject: News &amp; views of EV

Below is a message that Peter Simmons sent to me for my opinions of
VWofAmerica's support of the Eurovan and Eurovan Owners/Operators.

I got his permission to post this to the list.

I think it appropriate for other EVers to see this and perhaps to
comment back to Peter. This way he can get a 'fairer' impression.

I hope other Eurovan Owners/Operators will take the time to comment,
either publicly or in private.

I check out the Vanagon list from time to time as I'm working my way up
to a decision about a camper some time this year. I have been trying to
get a handle on the facts, to help me decide whether to buy a used EV
(can't afford a new one) or a new Dodge/Ford/whatever van which can be
locally camperized for the price of a used EV. So of course I'm appalled
at your notes re keeping a '93 EV going. Have you had the van since new?
Has it been treated well (apart from you paying the full shot for VW
service, I mean)? Do you have any reason to believe that yours is just a
lemon, or do you think your case is typical?

The list is handy for discussions of tire pressures and synthetic oil,
but being the home of VW fans (and sometimes 'fan' as in fanatic)
............. Anyway, thanks for the honesty.
