&gt;Do y'all think this is a physiological, psychological, or mechanical

it's definitely psychological ... otherwise, there is no reasoning behind
the idiots who, when coming up behind a bus, will pass and then slow down
(so you have to pass them to maintain the speed you were driving before!).
and it's definitely psycho for those folks who, when passed BY you, will
immediately pass you (cause they cannot stand being behind a big bus that
they can't see through/around/over).

and it's not just diesels ... the DGFF (Don Garlits Figit Factor) also
applies to idiots who stack up behind my 88 gas bus at red lights. i think
it's just the ME-ME-ME!!! attitude of the world today.
