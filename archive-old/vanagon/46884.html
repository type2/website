Subject: Archives reminder


Just a reminder to all, and i'm as guilty as any, that there is a 
wonderful set of archives at:

gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

this is searchable author, topic, etc.  for example, search &quot;fram 
filters&quot; in just about any year and you'll be overwhelmed at the 
information and number of posts.  Additionally, under the 
heading &quot;Files&quot; is a collection of articles and information on 
commonly asked questions ie

Refrigerators (!)
Coolant types
How-To on lotsa stuff

I don't mean to post this to castigate anyone for asking questions 
but if there is a slow response to a question it may be because it 
has been discussed extensively in the past.  I use the archives alot 
but still find myself asking questions that have been discussed.  
it's okay.  but the information is often out there already!
