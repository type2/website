I think they should at least offer to give you a gas heater.

It really doesn't make any sense, the HEAT, A/C and fresh air options in
the Vanagon I had were extraordinary.  When compared to the Vanagon, the
EV HVAC system sucks.  Front A/C and heat are pretty good, rear A/C and
heat is ok. 

What I hate the most is the lack of combinations of ventilation.  In the 
Vanagon I could run fresh air and heat, fresh air and a/c or even heat 
and a/c at the same time.  Or if passengers were cold in the back, I 
could run heat in the back and a/c in the front.

Has everyone else noticed that in the EV your choice is pretty much 
limited to ONE or the OTHER.  If the front A/C is one the rear heat won't 
come on.  My biggest pet pieve so far though is that the defroster won't 
run without the compressor on.  Why does VW think you need to run the 
compressor to blow heat onto the windshield?
