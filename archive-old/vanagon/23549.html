Subject: Re: air scoops on splitties


&gt;&gt;VW does apparently think that scoops work, or at least that global warming
&gt;&gt;was such that they were required as of the 1968 model year, and ever 
since.
&gt;
&gt;Bigger motors, higher speeds, perhaps?


Bigger motors, tighter smog regs (leaner burning), heavier
buses, taller gears, slower-turning engines for a given speed,
thus slower-turning cooling fans while gas pedal is held closer
to the floor, IMHO.
