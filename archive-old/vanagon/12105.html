So Derek Drew says:
&gt; But my real question is this, what if Gerry goes under his Vanagon and his
&gt; jackstands fail? Or what if he gets fired from his edu cause he thinks about
&gt; VWs too much? Or what if the US Congress cuts all the edu's budgets and they
&gt; have to cut out all those freeloading sites put up there by fantatics in
&gt; love with some specialty? 
&gt; 

What are you tryin' to do Derek?!  Scare us!  You stop telling these 
kind of fantasies or you'll be sent straight to bed with no more
vanagon mail for tonight!   ;)
