So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; hmmm. maybe they got it 'fixed' and i've been getting the last of the old
&gt; inventory. symptoms are coolant level starts getting lower, chaulky white-

Yep.  I bet they see you comin' a mile away.  ;)

&gt;symptoms are coolant level starts getting lower, chaulky white-
&gt; blue (depending on your coolant) deposits somewhere round about the tank
&gt; or below it.
&gt; 

Well, I know I haven't been getting anything like that.  And I don't have
any LED light symptoms as Richard indicates.  I'll check for cracks around
the neck of the tube and elsewhere for that matter, but I think it's okay.
No obvious coolant loss.

Thanks,

Steven
