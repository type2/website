&gt;So, two gas tank
&gt;removals and one installation, in about... 14 hours of work.

Oops, what was I thinking?  I meant, 18 hours.  12 on Saturday,
and 6 on Sunday.  Whee!

For the bean counters, here's a breakdown:
3 hours, removal of 77 tank.
3 hours, removal of 78 tank.
1-1/2 hours, trip to FLAPS.
3 hours, spiffing up the joint (attacking rust).
2 hours, place tank into 78, install new filler neck--what a pain!.
4 hours, bolting down tank, running new gas line,
  checking for leaks, reinstall firewall and air intake apparatus.
1-1/2 hours post-op, puzzling over poor running condition.

As you can tell, we spent a lot of time talking, planning, puzzling,
reworking, and generally attempting to be meticulous.  If you actually
knew what you were doing, you could probably cut our times at *least*
in half!
