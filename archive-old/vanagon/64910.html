Subject:      Re: Maintaining your Vanagon

Huge thanks to everyone who responded to my questions! I've placed an
order for the manuals and started rounding up tools. The Vanagon goes in
today for an over-all check-up; hopefully, I'll be alerted if there's
anything really strange or monstrous that warrants attention. If there
is anyone out there who is a tad reticent about stepping up to publicly
claim mechanical ineptitude, E-mail me; I'll synopsize (new word? :-) )
for you.
