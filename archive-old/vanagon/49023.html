Yup , Eric is right. This seems to be a VW design problem that is
plagueing us vanagon owners. I wonder whether this was one of the reason
VW took the Vanagon off the market. 
&gt;      OH NO,  This is a simptom of a head gasket. Having to much in 
&gt;      there isn't a problem. How it got there is. Keep an eye on it.

&gt; &gt; Hi all, got back from the Lawrence MA VW show yesterday. It was okay,
&gt; &gt; seemed better last year. only 5 vanagons in the 80 - 91 class, don't know
&gt; &gt; if Siegfried won anything because we had to leave. Anyway, the coolant
&gt; &gt; overflow tank seems to be ove the cold fill line. I checked yesterday after
&gt; &gt; getting back and the tank was very full. Today it is about an 1/8th inch
&gt; &gt; above the line. Should I slurp some out or is this okay? TIA
