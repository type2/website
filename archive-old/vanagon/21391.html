Subject: We're off.....

It starts tomorrow...the trek of the summer (for me anyway!) on a merry
treasure hunt for V-Dubs and Dub goodies.
Some of you net floaters may have followed a thread started by fellow
Vanagon member Richard Palmer and I over in Vintage regarding our &quot;projects&quot;
and the desire to undertake each others burden.... Well, starting tomorrow!

I will be leaving here in central Florida (bright-n-early) and trekking my
65 Single Cab up the backroads of the warmish Southern U.S. to Richard's
nesting place in Raliegh N.Carolina.... Not too terribly far (675+/- miles)
for a new car, but I've been spending countless hours tweaking steering and
drivetrain preparing for this day.

Once I get to Richards we intend to oogle each others VW, swap titles, pat
each other on the back and whisper good byes to our ex-projects as we look
forward to starting over again on similiar tasks, but on neater vehicles...

On my return trip I will be side tracking to Winston Salem (home of IVWA)
to pick-up a sweet partially restored 1959 sedan ragtop from a fella and
to poke at a local junk yard I used to visit years ago.

The road back hopefully will be uneventfull mechanically as I will be looking
more in the back yards and junk yards along the side of the road for lurking
treasures waiting to be discovered.

Anyone living alongside Highway 301 (of Tom Petty fame) keep your eye out
for a funny little yellow pick up truck with lots of parts in the back..
