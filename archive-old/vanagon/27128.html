Subject: re:limited slip differential

though of only  passing interest to those with vanagons,  my edition of the
VW Type 2 Parts List  for splitties,  dated late 66  (this is the book the
dealer had to look up parts in),  M 220 is listed as Limited Slip
Differential.   So,  yes,  you could order your bus with this modification,
  and wouldn't that be fun when you're off road in mud.    Raaad!

Bet there aren't any in stock.

Or if there are,  They are $4000.   VWOA  has this habit of raising prices on
old stock .    Iheard new flat windshields are available for $160 each.
  yea.    So when they don't sell it, periodically they gasp!   bulldoze it
and write it off on their taxes at the inflated rate no one bought  it at.

Barndoor brakes shoes have been found recently in Canadian dealerships for a
reasonable price.    Very old stock.   I wonder....
