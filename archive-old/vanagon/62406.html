&gt; Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; This seems like a great idea!  My only concern would be securing the bags
&gt; against theft.  Do you use any deterents?
&gt; 

2m above ground! (Deters shorter, non-agile thiefs ;-) 

Seriously, no I haven't found a good way. If I leave the Westy unattended
in a city I take them off and throw them inside. You could use a cable
lock through the D-rings on the bags, and lock them to the rack, but 
anyone with a knife can just slice the vinyl bag open anyway.

/Martin
