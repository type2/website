&gt; I'll be taking our '90 GL to R134a in the next two weeks.
&gt; The local dealer quoted around $1500 for the swap (with a new compressor,
&gt; because, they claim, I need it).

Ouch!  How much of that $1500 is the new compressor?  The fittings, seals,
and coolant should be pretty inexpensive...  If they're replacing hoses too,
of course, that will set you back a considerable amount.  I have one leaky
hose, which I'll have to replace whether I do the R134a swap or not.  :-(

&gt; The warning that they all give me is that the coolant isn't as efficient
&gt; (about 15% less so) and that if I don't get the whole system replaced with
&gt; something with more capacity I may not like it.

Something with more capacity?  Like what?  Did they have recommendations?

Have you looked into FR12/Frigc?  According to Pennzoil's Web page on it
(http://www.frigc_dot_com/), there are a ton of places in Houston that can
install it, and they claim that:

- it's more efficient than R143a
- it doesn't require any equipment changes

I don't anything about it beyond what they say, of course, and I don't
expect them to be wholly objective.  There isn't an installer for it near
me, so it may not even be an option for my bus.

&gt; I say that 85% more cooling is better than it is now...

Amen, brother.
