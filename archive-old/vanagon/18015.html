Subject: Re: '92 Westphalia - Safety Net

&gt;Can anyone help me locate a safety net for my '92 Westy, for use accross the
&gt;opening to the upper bed, and used to prevent children from falling through
&gt;the opening?  The VW Camper Supplementary Manual makes reference to this
&gt;accessory however the dealers in B.C. here are unable to locate.
&gt;
&gt;My 2 year old son tends to move through the night and I'd hate to see him
&gt;drop through the hole.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
&gt;

I have a 92 Westfalia as well  and was planning to put a net to separate
the rear section (where my son likes to nap) from the rest of the van.  I
was considering using a pick-up tailgate net.

They sell them at Canadian Tire for about $29.
