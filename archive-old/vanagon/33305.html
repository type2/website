Subject: 2000cc piston needed(long)


Hi everyone,
	I finally pulled the engine on my '79 bus yesterday to find out 
why it stopped running on me a few months ago.  The problem was that I 
had driven it to run some errands and when I came out of what proved to 
be the last stop of the day, the engine tried to turn over and thupped 
pretty hard and then wouldn't budge.  I checked the starter and that was 
not the problem.  The engine would turn *almost* 360 degrees but not 
quite the whole way round in either direction.  Anyway, pulled the engine 
yesterday and found that the Valve Seat (I think that's the proper term) 
had fallen out from behind the valve and dropped into the cylinder and 
had proceeded to get munched up while breaking the cylinder and piston.  
It was a head that the PO had gotten from JC Whitney and which had less 
than 3000 miles on it.  

The previous owner had left another JC Whitney head and a spare cylinder 
in the van when I got it so I have these two items, but I need a piston 
to get this back together and on the road.  

Now for the questions,
1. While inspecting the head, found a crack along one of the openings for 
the push rod tube.  Since this is not an area under too much stress, will 
I be safe to put some JB Weld along the crack and then hone out the hole 
so that the washer on the end of the push rod tube will seal tightly?  
(limited cash, new head=~$175)

2.Will I be safe to put a piston into this spare cylinder?  Volkswagen 
will sell me one piston/cylinder set for $250, Whitney (don't want to use 
them if I can avoid it) has a set of four for $250, and RMMW has a set for 
~$300+ with 20% off (I think)...

3. Does anyone out there have any ideas on how I might get either a 
single piston, or a piston/cylinder for somewhat less than the above 
alternatives?  I would gladly purchase one from any list member who might 
have one they could spare.  I have tried the local used parts places and 
the two local VW garages with no sucess.

Any help/advice will be greatly appreciated.   
TIA,
dave.
