Subject: [f] Story!  Conclusion!


CONCLUSION of the gripping detective story, the Case of the Counterfeit 
Emblems.

Story so far:  Jokker Von Wokker, the Stolen VW Emblem King, got the blonde 
dame to lure me to his apartment.  Turns out he just wanted to talk.

  &quot;Look, Wokker,&quot; I said, why not just be reasonable and come to my office and 
talk?  Why all this cheap mystery-story fol-de-rol with the gat?  The gat 
looked amazingly like a fuel pump from an 84 Vanagon.
  Wokker waved the pistol.  &quot;Willy, he intoned, &quot;I know from sad experience 
that this is the only kind of reason you are going to listen to from me.&quot;  He 
waved it again.  &quot;Remember?&quot;
  &quot;Put that damned thing away,&quot; I growled.  He had his point.
  Jokker got up out of his chair.  &quot;What I've got to tell you can't leave this 
room,&quot;  he said darkly.  He started going all around the apartment, looking 
behind furniture, looking in the closet, frowning like a new bus owner 
searching for rust spots after an East Coast winter.
   &quot;Are the paranoids out to get you?&quot;  I quipped.  Count on Willy for a
quip.
   &quot;Look, Willy,&quot; Von Wokker croaked--his version of a whisper. &quot;If this gets 
out we're done for.&quot;
   &quot;Von Dub, you old thief,&quot; I sneered.  &quot;If you can't take the compression get
out of the combustion chamber.&quot;
   &quot;But Willy, that's just it.  I am not a thief.&quot;
   &quot;Yeah, you and Richard Nixon,&quot; I quipped.  Clip and save these quips, hey?
&quot;And stop calling me Willy.  I got enough the willies already.&quot;
   The blonde cut in.  &quot;What Jokk is trying to tell you in his own clumsy way,&quot;
she crooned, &quot;is that none of those stolen Vanagon emblems we've been selling 
were really stolen.&quot;
   &quot;Not any?&quot;  I cried, bewildered.  (No big deal on bewildered, you can 
bewilder me with high beams.)
   &quot;Well, hardly any,&quot; she said.  &quot;We've been manufacturing them.  But we've 
got to pretend they're stolen so that people will buy them.  Folks want the 
real thing.&quot;

   My teeth clattered out of my mouth sounding like a blown engine in Bozeman, 
Montana.

   &quot;Here's the scoop,&quot; Von explained.  &quot;I got the moxie and the dame's got the 
front desk but we ain't got nobody with the brains.&quot;
   &quot;Ho hum, tell me something I don't already know,&quot;  I yawned.
   &quot;We gotta have somebody with brains to run the emblem machines.  They keep
breaking down.  We gotta have you, Willy.  You run the machines.&quot;
   &quot;Are you suggesting,&quot; I rasped, &quot;that I should give up my lucrative 
Automotive Detective business to play Knick Knack on your Mechanisms?&quot;
   &quot;We gotta have ya, Willy.&quot;  Von Wokker was pleading.  I'd never seen him
like this before.  As unexpected as the feeling you get when you give your old 
van a new engine and a paint job.
   &quot;Well, I'm gonna have to think,&quot; I enunciated thoughtfully.  &quot;I can't make a 
big decision like this in a day.&quot;
   &quot;Willy, this is the concluding episode!  You gotta decide now!&quot;  Von Wokker 
was waving his arms, looking like a freshly blown-out tire on hot pavement.
   &quot;No, I don't,&quot; I said firmly.  &quot;I'll give you my answer in a week.&quot;
   &quot;A week!&quot;  Von Wokker was turning purple with dispoplopsia or what the hell 
that is.  &quot;Willy!  THIS IS THE LAST INSTALLMENT!&quot;
   &quot;Next week,&quot; I said quietly.
