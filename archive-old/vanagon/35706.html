Subject: Split Window Bus Sheet Metal
Date: Tue, 20 Feb 1996 09:11:16 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;


As a favor for Mary and Clay, I cranked out a quick web page for 
Das Bulli Haus.  At 

http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/dasbulli.html 

you will find a short description of their operation and images of 
their catalog for replacement sheet metal panels for early busses.

I still have to implement the image map portion, so you can click on
a section and get the price info, and I also have to type in the
price list, but this is a start.  Maybe I can get at least the price
list done in the next day or so.

I don't really have any connection to Das Bulli Haus, but since the
subject of repair panels keeps coming up, and people keep buying the
Wolfsburg West panels and other companies stuff, and then writing in
to complain, I figured I'd just try and save people the hassle next
time.

Maybe when I get a chance I'll do the same for the bay window folx
