Subject: Ouch: $10 lug nuts

I was thinking of putting some factory alloy wheels on my Westfalia to allow 
for some slightly larger tires (as well as a slightly better appearance, I 
think). The used parts division of a nearby VW dealer bought out a 
distributers stock of wheels and is selling them for $150 each (brand new). 
Still pricy, but much less than the $400 or so if you walk across the 
parking lot to the new parts counter. So I asked if the $150 wheels include 
lug nuts. &quot;Nope, you'll have to get those from the new parts department.&quot; 
Figured I better see how much I would have to shell out for lug nuts, so I 
checked with the new parts department and was quoted $9 to $11 each. I 
didn't wait around to see why some were $9 and some were $11. $200 for a 
complete set of lug nuts. No can do.
