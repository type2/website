Subject: Re: Gas spillage &amp; other oddi...

&gt;kind of hits low rpms for a gear, usually 3rd and 2nd, but this has
&gt;happened out of the blue a few times.  Anyway it will suddenly switch to
&gt;its other personality: it will putter and cough in 1st and then I shift
&gt;to second and give it some gas and... nothing happens, it coughs a little
&gt;and smoke puffs out with each cough, its like the car is out of gas... I
&gt;have found that at this point the best thing to do is pull over turn off
&gt;the car and swear at it for 30 seconds and then it starts back up in its
&gt;good personality. I figure this is some problem with my fuel line or fuel
&gt;injector? but i know little about engines so if anyone knows whats up
&gt;please help me out


Sounds to me like a) needs auxiliary airbox wiring harness, or b) more likely
bad ground in engine compartment. Dennis Haynes had this problem with the
smoke coming out the exhaust and it was a badly designed ground on his 87
syncro camper in the engine compartment.
