Subject: Filling the gap in the pop-top

My DPO was kind to the bus in three ways:

1. She sold me the bus so that I could fix practically every component.

2. She fixed the canvas on the pop-top.

3. She installed a plywood bed across the top.

Most campmobiles I have seen are void of any bed in the top, either having 
the cot removed, or not having had that option to begin with. The bed I 
have, however, is quite simple and quite functional. It's perfect for 
the kids when we go the local drive-in in the summer. $5/carload....back 
row, please! Best of all, the bed creates an insulated buffer between the 
chilling exterior and the bus interior. It almost fills the void, leaving 
only about 14 inches of clearance at the end (just enough for an adult to 
squeeze up into the bed).

The bed is made of 1/2 or 3/4 inch plywood covered with a permanent,
cloth, foam-filled mattress. It is attached to the roof near the front of
the bus on hinges and lifts easily when one wants to unzip the rear
window. It's a little awkward holding the bed on my shoulders, but not
overly so. I suppose a stick could be used to keep the bed proped up and 
increase the air-flow in the camper on warm evenings, but I won't have 
to worry about that for several months. In the back, two rubber stops 
create a levelness to the bed and prevent it from slamming into the top 
of the bus.

I don't know if this type of bed is common in campmobiles, but it is, for 
me, very practical. It provides some degree of protection from the cool 
air sneaking in through the top, and adds to the utility of this already 
amazingly useful vehicle.

I'll be happy to share more details to any interested volks. 

Thanks! Joe
