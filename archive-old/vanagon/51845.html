Subject: Remote starter button how to hook-up vanagon?

Still another question, I need to me able to turn the motor over using the
a starter button on the vanagon. Working along need to know. Do you have to
hook direct to the starter (if so I guess hook the + to the term.30 and the
- to ?) or can you do it closer in the engine compartment?
