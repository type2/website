&gt;I was at a junk yard this AM getting a used alternator for my 87 vanagon
when
&gt;I noticed an 84 camper with its interior camping stove/fridge (hardly used
&gt;as the van was a mobile vet truck) in mint condition along with pop-top,
&gt;canvas, etc.

Dang it - why are these always on the other side of the continent? :(  Would
love to have the interior to make a hardtop Westy outa my '80 Wanagon.  Oh
well, maybe some other time.
