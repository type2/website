Subject: Diving right in...

Well I finally found this list.  I heard about it from a windsurfing mailing 
list as we were discussing great vehicles for lugging around all the gear we 
need.

I own a '88 Westfalia (burgundy) with about 120k miles.  I would consider my 
relationship with this brick as love/hate.  I use it alot for camping, 
windsurfing, and commuting.  I live in the Boston area.

I have a few issues you may be able to help me with.

1.  I'm losing the gasket around the pop top.  Where is the best place to get a 
new one and is it easy to install?

2.  Ever since I had the heads redone I tend to over heat in the summer or at 
sustained high speeds.  I don't know if the two are related or not.  One guy I 
took it to ( I go elsewhere now) could not figure it out so he put in a toggle 
switch that would let me turn on the high speed fan when I was stuck in traffic 
headed for the cape.  The switch tend to burn out so this really is no 
solution.  To add to this the low speed setting in the fan doesn't seem to 
work.  I don't think that is the ultimate problem.

What do you think?

3.  I also have a problem with the low rpm oil pressure sensor after the brick 
has heated up.  I get no valve tap at low rpm but the light blinks at idle.  
The weird part is that this will go away by itself until an oil change.

And finally:  Are there some web sites out there I should check out?

Thanks,

Paul
