Subject: Cross Country Runner needed


Somebody just posted an 81 Vanagon FS, calling it a &quot;Cross-Country Runner.&quot; 

Obviously, this was my motivation to ask if anybody has or knows of anybody 
that is selling a Camper/poptop/Westy etc (in CA), that is just itchin to 
do some travelling around the Western US. 

I plan to be in Calif by mid-February, and am open to any suggestions. (I 
can also look in the Phoenix area if need be).  Feel free to pass this on 
to anyone this may apply to. I've been checking the Recycler On-line, but 
this does me no good since I'm at present on the wrong coast. It would be 
awesome to buy from a list member, since if you are part of this list, you 
must care about your VW! 

I promise to be extra nice to your bus if I buy it, Good Karma, Positive 
Zen, and blessings etc. (And just think of the fab post cards it will 
send!)

You can contact me at mjeschelnik_at_gph_dot_com 
or 301-725-9515 in the evenings (Eastern time).

Thanks heaps for your help. 


Soon to be a &quot;Camping Crazy,&quot;
