Subject: Cost of restoration

	My experience is that restorations, other than wash, wax and vacuum,
cost only about three times what you could possibly have expected, BUT
they take about eight times a long. You will also see a PERFECT example
of what you want, for sale for less money than you've already spent,
before you get done.
	Don't forget that $1000 invested produces no more than $500 
resale value.

	So decide how much you can REALLY spend- that is, how much
you would spend on the car and then on stuff for it ($500? $1500?, more?)
and use that as your budget. Expect between $100 and $500 work will
be required on the day you buy it, whatever it is, whatever 
condition it appears to be in. Leave yourself a couple-a-hundred
or a nice clean credit card after you pay for the car, sales taxes,
registration, etc.

	Number one place to find the car of your dreams is the local
enthusiast show for your type of car- VW, Porsche, British, Italian,
etc. Number two place is the maillinglist, newsletter, shop or 
garage bulletin board. Newspaper ads are third best, seen on street
are frequently people who don't really know if they want to sell or not.

	Got the money and its burning a hole in your pocket? Put it in 
a mutual fund. Don't even THINK of buying a restoration with credit-
you'll need all your borrowing ability later...

	Go to local VW shows with a downpayment ($100+). Make contact 
at the show, maybe even drive at the show, but for anything over $1000, 
a reasonable seller can expect the reasonable buyer will have to wait 
until Monday to pay for it.

	As you check what's available, look even if it isn't the exact
thing you want, for practice and to see where rust forms, what breaks,
etc. Keep track of what cars like the one you want sell for, and what
condition they are in. $3000 for a mid-60s bus could be a great deal
or a complete rip-off, depending on condition, features, etc.

	Above all, patience.

	It doesn't hurt if the seller is like you, but its generally
better if the seller is gentler, neater and more inclined to have a
professional work on it than you are. Maintenance records are nice,
but try to buy something thats better cared for that what you drove
up in. :)

	Good luck!

	I haven't taken much of this good advice yet, and I always pay
for it. At least I now know to look for damage underneath...

	Bill
