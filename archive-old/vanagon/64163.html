Subject: Re: &lt;Syncro/all&gt; fender lip rubber


Hello all,

I got some request and I like to answer in this private mails.
Does someone repost this to the current listserver? I have some
own problems with e-mail and don't know with is the right one
at present. But see below.

Jim Davis &lt;SyncroHead&gt; 1 Set 14&quot;

Tim Smith &lt;smitht&gt; ? Set 1?&quot;
 Tim, please send me your order, which one you like to have?

Patrick Eagan &lt;EAGAN&gt; 1 Set 14&quot; TUV comment:
 The fender lips makes the Vanagon wider and in Germany it is required
 to get a TUV approval. But this not difficult to get. This fenders lips
 are required if the Vanagon is equipped with 7&quot; or 8&quot; wide rims.

Chris &lt;JordanVw&gt; 1 Set 14&quot;
 It's serious, and I will include the Transporter badget for you, but
 I haven't found the Bus logo in the new '85 design until now.

Derek Drew &lt;Derek Drew&gt; 3 Sets 16&quot; Comment: 14&quot; does not fit:
 Derek, I'm sorry, but Winkler's catalog offers only one option, that's
 I'm sure for 14&quot; wings. If they are different to the 16&quot; I can not
 count you for this purchase. But I will check with Winkler.

Rick Koller &lt;Rick Koller&gt; 1 Set 14&quot; Comment: How to do the group purchase:
 Regularly I ask to send a check to Martha. She puts the money to a bank
 account where I have access to. I like to send the fender lips in one
 parcel to one of the US (Canadian) members who likes to have one. The lips
 for him will be free, if this meets his postages to resend the other lips.
 Anyone interested in this?

Jim Catterson &lt;James Catterson&gt; ? Set 1?&quot; Comment: How to do the group 
purchase:
 See above. Send me what you like to order.

Tom Forhan &lt;Forhan, Thomas&gt; 1 Set 16&quot;
 Tom, I'm sorry, but I don't think that this lips will fit the 16&quot;, if they 
are
 different to the 14&quot; wheel wells. I will check with Winkler about this and
 I keep the list informed. Isn't it that you are running the Synchro Web 
Site?
 Is it possible to host a picture of this fender lips to show the list 
members
 what they will get? This will be great, I will send you all the details 
about
 this lips.

If I'm missing someone on the list, please e-mail me privately. At present I 
have
some problems with e-mail. Someone changed my present postoffice in Germany 
and
all mails from the list are blocked in a queue in Finland. I'm on holiday 
with
remote mail and can not redirect the mails because of no access to the 
Finish
network. Please use Helmut.Zeidler_at_ntc.nokia_dot_com for privat mails. Thank 
you.

Helmut
'80 Camper

Sorry, someone changed my mailserver during my holiday and I lost my remote
access during the last two weeks. But now I'm back on work and try to
continue on the tread above.

Helmut
