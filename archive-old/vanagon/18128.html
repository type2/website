OK, maybe I shouldn't jump in here, since I don't read r.a.vw very often, 
and am very, very happy with the vanagon list as it is, so this whole 
thing is really academic to me (and not tven that, actually), and the 
r.a.vw people can do whatever they want, even if it includes:

		rec.autos.makers.vw.vanagon.with.showers.and.washer/dryer

:)

Really, why break it up like that?  If you don't like hearing about 
lowered cabrios with underside black lights, or how some wienie just HAS 
to defeat their daytime running lights, then just add the subjects to 
your kill file and call it a day.  My kill file for r.a.vw takes out 90% 
of the traffic, so I don't realy care about this air/water thing.

The air/water split doesn't work for us (just me?) anyway, as many of the 
discussions conducted here on vanagon apply to all of us.  Hell, I might 
even (*gasp!*) own a water-pumper some day ( :-) ok?), so I find these 
discussions germane. 

Leave the USENET people to their own games, I say, and let's talk about 
splits, loafs, bricks, and eurovans!

'Nuff said?
