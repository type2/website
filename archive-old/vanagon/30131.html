Subject: Re: Cost of Operating Vanagon


Oops, thanks to the ever scrutinizing Unca Joel for pointing out that I 
dorked royally on my cost per mile calcs.   I had miles per dollar figured 
out, 3.7mi/$, and moved the decimal point, One dunce award please.  Cost was 
$0.27/mileCDN, $0.194/mi US.  My apologies to the Swiss bankers, gotta stop 
counting on my fingers.    Tim
