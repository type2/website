Subject: How to clean WHITE on POP top/Curtains

Hello,
I would *REALLY* like to get the poptop WHITE, I mean WHITE (!) again.
Tried: Soft scrub with bleach, SOS pads, Fibreglass boat cleaner, et al=8A
But it still looks grey. I believe the dirt is at a microscopic level. Any
Suggestions?



Also: Saw a camper with custom curtains: The sliding door curtains had been
re-done to touch the floor, instead of just the shorty original curtains.
Great idea, as sometimes, when changing or whatever, I like to keep the
door open. With a to-the-floor curtain here, it works well. Another
suggestions that works well: When re-doing curtains, try backing them with
a day-block fabric. This blocks out light very well, and makes van harder
to see into (shadows and such) at night!



Please forgive earlier typos=8A that old carpral tunnel acting up again=8A
Thanks!

Louise
