Subject:       A Virtual Toast   /f

I propose we all raise our collective virtual glass in a birthday toast to 
the moderator of our group, without which we'd all be more ignorant 
and probably be tempted to drive something boring.

So here's to you, Gerry, Happy Birthday
May your rods never seize, your pistons never score
Let all your van experiences leave you wanting more.
