Subject: Gopher Searches

At this time I'm having difficulty supporting the gopher/wais search stuff.
I love the way it works, but I can't seem to get it built for Solaris cleanly.
If anyone out there can help me, I'd appreciate it.  

If anyone out there can't help me, I suspect I will abandon the gopher server
entirely and write cgi which will do the search stuff.  This *will* be slower.

If not having gopher access to the archives (HTTP access will be provided
instead) will inconvenience you, please email me privately to let me know.
