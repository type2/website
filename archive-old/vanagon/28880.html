Subject: Seek and Ye Shall Find... Foam!



To All:

Background:  I want to spray a 1&quot; layer of rigid urethane foam on Grendel's
ceiling, possibly other surfaces as well.

Problem:  I couldn't find any spray foam in consumer-sized quantities.

Solution:  I kept looking and...

The stuff is called 'Spray N'Fill', brand name is Inst-Foam Products Inc., a
division of Flexible Products Co., 1500 Cedarwood Drive, Joliet, Illinois
60435-3187 USA, tel 800-800-3626, local tel. (815) 741-6800.

'Spray N'Fill' is sold by Harbor Freight(!),  their item # 31951-1AJA,
$19.99, which is nearly $20.  That buys you one cubic foot, which you may
spray as thin or as thick as you like; the stuff cures instantly.  Cured
R-factor is R-5.6

What You Get for $20:
   You get a red cardboard carton about 13&quot; high, 6&quot; wide and 3&quot; thick.  They
don't want you getting into this carton but the lower four inches are cut
away forming a pocket/handle into which is curled a pair of hoses attached to
an applicator, plus a couple of plug-in nozzles.

To use the stuff you plug one of the nozzles into the applicator, turn the
carton upside down, pull firmly on a rip-cord and fit the pulled cord into a
slot so it stays 'pulled'.  What you've just done is compress the valves of
the two spray-cans inside the carton.  The upside-down position puts the
valves downward and the HCFC propellant in the cans forces the two liquids
through independent hoses to the nozzle you've plugged into the applicator.
 The nozzle contains a mixing chamber where the two liquids are swirled
together and a spray-nozzle where the mixed urethane foam spews out all over
everything, hopefully by design.  But for the unwary, the applicator is
fitted with a caming valve that will pinch-off the tubes if you twist the
valve strongly enough, shutting off the flow of liquid to the mixing chamber.

One of the liquids is white, the other brown.  When they encounter each other
in the mixing chamber they combine to form a fast-curing, high-density
urethane foam.  If you hold the applicator about a foot from a surface, the
foam will spray onto it just a fraction of a second before it becomes fully
cured, long enough for the droplets to weld themselves into an homogenous
mass and bingo!  You're in the spray-foam business.

Is It Worth It?

I don't know; too early to tell.  At about two bucks a square foot it's
certainly one of the more expensive forms of insulation but it is quick,
relatively easy to apply and has a good R-factor.  Plus it is an
'all-position' kind of stuff, just as happy clinging to a ceiling as a floor.

I can see a lot of negatives to Spray N'Fill but some of its positive aspects
are unique, things you can't do with any other form of urethane insulation.

I've a hunch Grendel's insulation will consist of several different forms of
urethane foam, with Spray N'Fill reserved for areas such as the overhead,
that don't lend themselves to regular canned foam or the rigid stuff.   And
the use of urethane alone isn't carved in stone, I'll be using other
insulators as well.

I'll keep the list informed of my experiments and use of spray foam but I
hope others will give the stuff a try since a single opinion is hardly a fair
evaluation.
