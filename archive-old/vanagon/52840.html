Subject: Syncro Clutch? [Was: Vanagon plea from western Belize...]


&gt;Don't give aid to missionaries. They destroy indigenous cultures.

&gt; I think we all need
&gt;to be aware of our impact on developing countries.

&gt;...It is about genocide,
&gt;practiced today, against helpless people in the name of god. These
&gt;destroyers are called Christians...&quot;
&gt;

&lt;sigh&gt;

If you sanctimonious twits would read the actual message, you wouldn't be
&quot;giving aid to missionaries&quot; if you tell this man where he can get a fuel
pump and a rebuild kit. You would be aiding a school.

Does the 86 Syncro have a different clutch cylinder from the regular van?
