&gt;I feel so stupid.  What is a DohrMobile?

nah. don't feel stupid ... most of us have never really seen one. ;)
a Dormobile is just another company that made campers out of vw buses. it's
claim to fame was a side-tilting top (instead of the front-flip or rear-
flip of those campers made by Westfalia).

there were many companies that made campers over the years, most are no
longer in business or selling them in this country. some others were
Devon, Komit, Dehler, ASI, Country Homes (still going in california),
Adventurewagen, and many more in germany.

now there's a thought ... your $30,000 would just about buy a Dehler Profi
... a really really neat package, made in germany, with stand up shower and
sit-down toilet built into the same old vanagon bus. :) high roof with
air conditioning and windows in the roof. really neat, but super
expensive. :(  looks like david schwarze's bus ... except made by mercedes!
:)
i have no idea what would be involved in bringing one back into the states.
