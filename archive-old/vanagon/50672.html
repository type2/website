For those that missed it the last 3 or 4 times...;)

I'd suggest you read this all the way through before you lay finger to 
van to familiarize yourself with what you'll need in the way of parts and 
the general flow of the work.  It's not that it's all that complicated, 
it's just that my stream of consciousness style of writing isn't meant to 
be an instruction manual but more of a general information guide to the 
task at hand.  Plus it's a lot less daunting once you've got a picture of 
the job in your mind.

Basically what you're going to do by installing a relay prior to the 
starter solenoid is to create an amperage amplifier.  The wire from the 
ignition switch that normally runs to the solenoid will instead be used 
to dump voltage/amperage that's very near to the battery's full potential 
directly to the solenoid.  The reason that you'll be doing this is 
because the wiring, connectors, etc. between the ignition switch and the 
solenoid have degraded due to corrosion and resistive build up to the 
point that not enough current gets to the solenoid to fire it when the 
starter is hot.  In some extreme cases you won't be able to turn the 
engine over even when it's cold.

The solenoid itself can be gotten from Checker (or its equivalent) for 
around $5US.  Just ask for a generic Ford truck solenoid.  It should come 
in one of two configurations, either a cross, with the two fat terminals 
(outputs) in one plane and two smaller terminals (inputs) in the other plane.
Or the two output terminals are in one plane and the two input terminals 
are on one side of the output terminal plane.  If you're not sure what's 
what ask the counterman (or woman, as the case may be).

I'm going to preface the rest of us this by saying that since this is a 
generic document, if things aren't exactly the way I describe on your 
vehicle, don't panic, I'm just describing my setup and yours may vary 
from it.  If you can't figure it out ask the list or write me direct for 
advice.

Before you start doing anything at all back by the starter, I'd suggest 
that you disconnect the negative battery lead and lay it to the side of 
the battery.  That way you won't accidently fire the starter, get your 
hair, shirt, whatever, stuck in the pulley, get your face ripped off and 
your wife, girlfriend, whoever won't sue me for a bazillion dollars for 
not warning you about this in the first place.  If you don't know enough 
to disconnect the electrical system when working on the starter, 
alternator, etc., I'm not sure you should attempt this in the first place.
Read the Idiot's Guide for a good primer on basic safety techniques.


Find an appropriate place to mount the solenoid by the starter.  If the 
only place to attach it is to the starter itself, make sure that it's a 
ground point and that vibration won't somehow cause the solenoid to come 
in contact with a hot lead (positive 12 volts), usually a red wire.  But 
not always, so check with a voltmeter if unsure of the wire's polarity.

Remove the wire from the spade clip on the end of the solenoid and attach 
one of the post type connectors that you picked up at the same time you 
bought the solenoid.  Forgot 'em?  Better go buy some and take the 
solenoid with you to make sure they're the right size.  The old wrap the 
wire around the post and tighten the nut trick won't work if you want 
this to be a trouble-free installation.  Pick up a few feet of battery 
cable and a crimping tool while you're there.  Read on for the rest of 
the parts list.

Attach the ignition wire (the one you just removed from the solenoid) 
to one of the input terminals, it doesn't matter which one.  Then run a 
new wire, preferably a black or brown one, to a ground point on the body 
from the other input terminal.  Once you're sure that everything's tight, 
run a fat (8-12 guage, whatever you have) cable from a direct battery 
connection to one of the fat terminals.  I used the battery connection at 
the starter, you can do the same.  Then run another new line (also ~10 
gauge) from the other fat terminal to the exposed spade clip that the 
original ignition wire went to.  You can use the original connector, so 
long as you didn't cut if off too short and you can use an electrical splice 
to connect the two ends.

Several things to make sure of:
Make sure that all connectors, posts, are clean and bright.  Polish them 
with emery cloth if they're not.  Make sure that all your crimp 
connections are tight by trying (a bit more than half-heartedly) to pull 
them apart.  Redo the connection if they are rent (asunder, that is).  
Make sure that all screw/nut connections (like the hot lead on the 
solenoid) are nice and tight as well.

If you're not sure which of the wires to the solenoid is the one from the 
ignition switch, put a volt meter in line between the wire you think is 
the correct one and ground.  With the volt meter on the Volts setting, 
have handy friend temporarily reattach the positive lead to the battery 
and turn the ignition key to the start position.  If you get 
approximately battery voltage, you know you've got the right one.  Make 
sure handy friend removes the battery cable before proceeding.


I did this to my Rabbit and van about two years ago after experiencing 
more and more degradation of the starting system and have had 0 problems 
since.  I used a Bosch fog light relay on the Rabbit in lieu of the big 
Ford solenoid since I didn't think it was necessary (and because I had a 
spare one).

Take your time, don't cut your wires until you're sure they're the right 
size and you should have a nice, neat installation.  Use cable ties to 
keep possibly errant wires out of the way of spinning, moving things and 
to prevent them from rubbing against sharp metal edges and shorting out 
the whole works at midnight in a blizzard after a bachelor party.  Hell, 
you shouldn't be driving then anyway, go crawl in the back and go to sleep.

Write me if you need more help or clarification,
Jack
