I have to tell you about a new mechanic we hired to our company. He 
works like me as a mechanic in a mine. He got his pickup, a Crewcab EV, 
droved it for a couples of weeks. I asked him about his car, what he 
thought of it. NAH, he said, i should have a syncro like yours, i have 
to change the rear wheels already, theyre just spinning all the time!
But, I said, your pickup has front wheel drive! No, he said, &quot;no pickups 
has front wheel drive&quot;. We argued a little and then went out to look.
Under his pickup, at the rearwheels: nothing!! no driveshafts!! no 
nothing!! Just the brake drums!! But but but.....
Some serious driver, eh!
