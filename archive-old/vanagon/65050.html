Subject:      Stereo Wiring Help

I'm trying to install an Alpine stereo in my '87 Westy.
Unfortunately, I have neither the manual for the stereo or
wiring information for the Westy (I know, the Bentley is
on order).

Anyway, on the Alpine stereo I have a connection for a
Battery Lead, Ground Lead and a Switched Power Lead (Ignition).

Looking at the stock VW stereo, there are three wires, that
I can't quite identify, marked as follows:

/--\
|--|    (Circle with line through it) - Brown Wire
\--/


+       (Plus sign, I know should be easy) - Red Wire
        (? positive battery lead, or positive ignition)


\|/
- -     (Looks like the sun) - Blue Wire
/|\

All other wires are speaker wires.  Any help identifying the
Brown, Red or Blue wires would be appreciated.  I plan on
tackling this Sat morning so ASAP would be nice.

Is there something special to wiring it so that the power
does not cut out when the ignition is off?

Thanks,
Stephen Jones
'87 Westy (El)
