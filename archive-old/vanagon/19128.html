Subject:       Re: mpg on 87 syncro

Hi there.  Mileage on my '90 Syncro Westy is fairly consistent at 
23-24 mpg (imperial).  We don't use the van in town, so my mileage 
figures are strictly highway and loaded with camping gear.  The van 
has 116000 km on it now (72000 miles).  

Of late, I have put in Bosch Platinums, and had new injectors 
installed (VW recall campagn in Canada), and on a recent trip of 
nearly 2000 km (1200 miles) I averaged 24.7 mpg with a high of 26 and 
a low of 23.  That is going over 6 mountain passes, and with a/c on.

Harry.

&gt; I have an 87 syncro with 120K miles.  I am getting 15 mpg.  My question is
&gt;  -- is this normal???   Normal or not can I do something to improve it.  If
&gt; not, can I put an extra gas tank so that I don't have to stop for gas every
&gt; 200 miles.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.
