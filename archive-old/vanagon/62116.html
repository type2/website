Subject: A/C problems: used parts

     To those who have been in search of A/C sol'ns, I have an '83 w.c 
     vanagon that has good a/c parts including interior panels.  I want to 
     sell it whole but a part-out is possible.   It also has a good tranny 
     (4spd) w/ new clutch kit.  e-mail me if you have interest.
