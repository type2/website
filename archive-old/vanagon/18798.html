Subject: f/  VW Tents


                 Camping, Tents, Baja and Buses

I don't use a tent when I knock around down in Baja, not that it
doesn't get cold and sometimes, rarely, there are reports of
rain.  (I've seen rain in Baja, but only from a distance.)

Standard Baja camping equipment is two tarps and four metal
poles; metal, because if you use wooden ones some damn fool will
put them in the fire.  Lotsa rope; rope is very handy stuff in
Baja.  

You use one tarp as a shade.  The only tree in Baja is in front
of the mission at San Ignacio and they don't like you to camp
there.  So you tie one side of the tarp to the roof rack and prop
up the other side with your metal poles, lash everything down
with rope.  Use bridge spikes as stakes to secure the rope. 
Bridge spikes are those humungous nails you've seen at Home Depot
(and wondered what they were for).  Now you know.  Bridge spikes
are Baja tent pegs.  (Because you can't drive a wooden tent peg
into the ground anywhere south of Maneadero.  And some damn fool
will put them in the fire.)

You use the other tarp as a ground cloth.  That's where you
sleep, on the ground cloth.  Under the shade.  (Down in Baja it's even sunny
at night.)  You set up your table on the ground cloth, and your cot, and your
Coleman stove.  Leave the porta-potti in the bus, along with the icebox.  And
the magazines.  Put the shotgun near the Coleman stove, down by the propane
bottle.

In Baja you fish; that's why it's there.  You don't shoot; guns
are illegal everywhere in Baja except in Tijuana and then only at
night in the downtown section.  Everywhere else you gotta use a
machette.  But a machette or even a pistol is no good against
flies, least ways not against Baja flies.  Oh, I used to use a
pistol on them; most guys start out with a pistol.  But if you
don't hit them suckers square you won't kill them.  And a wounded
fly will get madder than hell.  So use a shotgun.  I know; it's
not a sure-thing either, but it will knock them down, give you a
chance to go after it with your machette.  Once you got the wings
off them suckers you can get in close, finish them off with your
pistol.

It takes about thirty minutes to set up camp in Baja, unless
you've got women along.  It takes longer with women along; give
yourself lots of time.  Set up camp, take a stand, knock down the
Boss Fly to let the others know you mean business, then go
fishing.  

Women always want you to bring a tent along.  And extra clothes;
stuff like that.  Truth is, you don't need that much in Baja; the
fish don't give a damn what you got on.  But woman are handy
things to have around, especially in Baja, what with all that
gutting and cooking to do.  So mebbe you'd better plan on a tent. 
And wearing clothes.

If you've got a VW bus you can get one of those nifty little
tents that hooks on to the spray rails, sets up quick as bunny,
lets you get the boat in the water that much sooner.  But they're
hard to find; you might have to make one.

Here in southern California they've got these fabric
supermarkets, big as a football field; sells nothing but fabric. 
Sailcloth.  Upholstery stuff.  Foam.  Dacron for airplane wings;
every sort of fabric you can think of and all the gee-gaws to go
with it.  Go down there and get you a buncha' tent-fabric, take
it to an upholstery shop.  Or a sail loft.  Hell, mebbe they even
got tent shops; check the yellow pages.  The fabric will cost
more than the sewing and he'll need a pattern.  I'll leave the
pattern up to you; mebbe you could ask a woman, they mess with
patterns.  If your wife is handy that way, mebbe you could just
take the tent fabric along the next time you go to Baja; give her
something to do while you're out fishing; let her run up her own
tent.
