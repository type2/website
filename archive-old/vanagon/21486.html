Subject: Getting rid of interference from distributor?

Hi All!
Another question. We're trying to put cruise control in the '81 Westy.
But, it wont'work because of the interference from the distributor.
This Vanagon still has the points type ignition. Has anyone success-
fully sheilded the distributor? My Bently book has a picture of a
&quot;radio sheild&quot; that goes around the distributor that's supposed to cut the
radio interference. Is it like just a tin can? It's kinda frustrating.
The thing is installed. Bob made the wiring harness for it out of sheilded
cabling, but it seems the control module is still getting interference 
from the points. Wahhhh! :-(. Any help would be appreciated.
Lisa
