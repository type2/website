Subject: bill of sale question


I need to know some info from anyone who's bought/sold a vehicle
in California recently, as today as Saturday, and I can't phone
the DMV.  

Is a pink slip with the previous owners signature and date sufficient
to transfer owndership?  What if he forgot to sign and fill in and
date the odometer reading?

Is a bill of sale in addition to the above necessary?  Exceptions?

Thanks - need to know this as soon as possible.......
