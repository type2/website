&gt; No, I meant '69  ;-)
&gt; and I run 185-70R14s.  Apparently there were four versions of this 
&gt; tranny, with normal and mountain gears, with and without limited slip.
&gt; I examined my case and it is stamped 'CA' which means 'normal'.  However,
&gt; I still have the 4K rpms at 60 mph, so I suspect someone has put
&gt; other gears into it at some point.  Since I have other minor problems
&gt; with the tranny, I'm investigating having it rebuilt with a lower
&gt; ratio gear set.  The guy at the buggy shop told me today that I want
&gt; a '74 or '75 T1 tranny.  Anybody know for sure?  He also said the dune 
&gt; buggy guys are snapping up all our bus trannies, making them scarce.  
&gt; Dirty rotters.

  Your tires are part of your problem. If you are running 185/70
  tires the overall diameter is 24.2 inches. The stock tires, 185-R14 have
  a profile of 80% and the overall diameter is 25.6 inches. I suspect some-
  thing is still fishy with the transmision though - If the 185/70 tires
  are on all 4 wheels, the speedometer will read fast as well. 

  The '74-'75 transmission does have a numerically lower final drive but
  this is offset partly by a numerically higher fourth gear &lt;.89 instead of
  .82&gt;. The nice thing about the '74-'75 gearbox is the improved spacing
  between third and fourth gears- great for climbing hills. If you want
  &quot;long legs&quot; for your bus, the gearbox for the 2 liter went back to the
  .82 fourth gear.


  Shiftlessly yours,
