So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry that you have had tons of problems with your VW...perhaps
&gt; you have a lemon...perhaps its bad karma...or VANma as the case
&gt; may be...but your sample results don't jive with my sample results...
&gt; therefore IMHO, your sample results are not valid!

I don't think Sergio has a lemon, I strongly believe the service department
did not analyze or did not complete fix his van in the first place.  His
complaint should be with the VW service department and not VW engineering
or any other VW car make.  I think his best avenue for getting the problem
with his van solved is through legal help.  If I were you Sergio, I take
all the paperwork involved and have a discussion with an attorney.  See
what can be done and go from there.  Your only other alternatives are
to sell the van &quot;as-is&quot;, deal with VW arbitration or fix the problem
yourself.

I'm also sorry that you had these problems and hope that you can reach
a satisfactory agreement with the VW service department.  Not all VW
cars are dis-satisfying, even my van which is quite similar to yours.
Otherwise, why would all these folks on the list(s) drive them?
