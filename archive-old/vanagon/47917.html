Hello all,

Going on vacation for 2 weeks ... Banff, Jasper, Edmonton, in my '84 Westy.
First real good test since I've had it.  Thanks for all the help with regards
to my fridge.  I pulled it out half way (didn't know I had to loosen the vent
pipes at the flue outlet) and put it back in.  Since then no problems lighting
it or having it stay lit.  (I'm one who doesn't want to run it on 12V)  
I also put on a new pop-top seal and tail gate struts.  My mechanic put new
gas lines in because mine too was leaking like a seive when I filled it up.

Time to unsubscribe for awhile.  Look forward to rejoining the list when I get
back.
