Subject: 71:timing:carb...the solution,


 there is only one way to solve this problem,
 just sell it to me for fifty bucks...

 seriously, sounds like the time i put a stock single solex
 onto a 1835 motor, didn't run to good...
 so either you have a block in the main circut of the carb
 or fuel starvation for some other reason.
 check the carb and fuel pump.
 
 don't worry you'll fixit it's just a matter of time...
