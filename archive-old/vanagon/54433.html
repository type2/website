Subject: Re: Part Needed: Rear Heater Valve for '89 Westy

I've gotten the part number for the rear heater coolant valve.  The part is
867819809B and the O-ring is 861819297.  My &quot;VW Dealer&quot; has not got them in
stock.  Any idea where I might get one?

&gt;Hi,
&gt;The valve for the rear heater is leaking at the valve stem.  The part looks
&gt;like a plastic throw away item.  Does anyone have a part number? source?
&gt;price? for this part?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
