&gt; Is the Vanagon Westy insulated? When I fixed some rust around my
&gt; fridge flue vent and hookups I found about 2&quot; of fiberglass in that area.
&gt; Could somebody who has looked behind the other body panels tell me
&gt; if there is insulation there also?
&gt; 
&gt; 
Well here is where I have found insulation in addition to the fridge
side-panels: above the driver and passenger and in behind the sliding
door. There doesn't seem to be insulation in three key areas though: the two
front doors; the frontal area and the rear hatch.

The roof/styro idea is a good one but having driven the Westy in -20C
weather last winter there is in my view a more important area: the front of
the van. The main concern here is: cold air leaking through the fresh air vent
intake. Solution: block it off completely. My experience has been that the
stock heater is good for temps down to about -10 and even belwo that there
is plenty of hot air (from the stock heaters) but not enough to compete
with the ambient temps.

Two related questions: did the vanagon westys ever have a some kind of device


device that blocked off to the front grille? Did they work?
