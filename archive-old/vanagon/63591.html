Subject: VW / Audi / Porsche SUV?  AutoWeek Article

Hi all,
The 7/28/97 issue of AutoWeek has the following news article about a future
SUV from VW....I mean Audi.....I mean Porsche.....Read for yourself:

================================================
SUVW--and Audi and Porsche
Volkswagen and Audi are working on car-based sport/utility vehicles, and VW's
could become the basis for the SUV that Porsche wants to add to its lineup.
VW's will be a compact SUV, similar in size to the Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V,
and it will be based on the Golf/Audi A3 platform.  Audi will build its SUV
off the new A6 station wagon chassis.
A VW spokesman didn't discuss potential launce dates, but did say that
Porsche has talked with VW about getting a version of its Golf-based SUV.
 Porsche had talked with Mercedesabout doing a version of the M-Class, and it
continues to study the development of its own sport/utility in the event that
it is unable to find an acceptable joint venture.
=================================================

My comments:
First, it seems quite odd that Porsche would consider a vehicle in its lineup
that would be sourced from VW, especially something as small &amp; &quot;economy
minded&quot; as a Golf derivitive.  I would think that Porsce would be interested
in competing with the likes of Range Rovers, Lexus LX450s, and the new
Mercedes M-Class.  Go figer...

Second, I wonder what all this talk of Golf based SUVs means to the potential
of a VW van based SUV.  I wonder if VW has the inclination to poke it's nose
into two completely different ends of the SUV market at the same time.  The
photo on the Vanagon_dot_com page appears to me to be a car based SUV.  It
certainlt ain't no van.
