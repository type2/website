A couple of comments:

Martha was talking about the Basic Designs Solar Showers and said..
&gt;Forgot to mention that the shower head on the end of my 5
&gt;gallon unit (and I assume  all their units) has an on/off
&gt;push/pull action, so that the flow is controlled at the 
&gt;end point of the shower. 
I own one of their 5 gallon showers and my wife and I both find that
push/pull valve to be impossible to close with soapy hands, so be
warned!  I was thinking of adding a pinch type thingie that squeezes
the tube shut to stop the water flow. I've got a nice one I use for
homebrewing beer, but don't know where else I'd find one of these.

Martha was also describing the &quot;Stove To Go&quot;. Don't forget that
there's a great stove in every car: the engine!  Get a copy of the
book &quot;Manifold Destiny&quot; and learn how to prepare and cook foil-
wrapped meals by sitting them on your engine as you drive!  The
flat Vanagon engine looks to be an excellent design, but kinda hard
to get to if the area over it is loaded with your camping/travel
gear...
