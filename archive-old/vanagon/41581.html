Subject: Re: Tale of morbidity based on fact

&gt;Well, we took up off'n the highway an' we come upon a sign.  It
&gt;says, `Black Bear Road--you don't have to be crazy to drive this
&gt;road but it helps'.... &quot;

        &quot;gall-damn, boy, when I say put a rock under the tire I mean a
*ROCK*! Lookathat you got there-ain' no bigger' n' a grapefruit!&quot;

        I highly reccomend the C.W. McCall's Greatest Hits record-very
funny record. Probably his most well known song was that god-awful '70's
hit &quot;Convoy&quot;. &quot;Breaker one-nine, this here's the rubber duck. You got uh
copy on me Big Ben come on?&quot; Come on, I know some of you are smiling out
there...   ;-)

Peace,
