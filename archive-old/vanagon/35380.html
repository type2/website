I've had my '74 bus for almost 17 years and over 200,000 miles. Been from 
Nova Scotia to Key West to Vancouver Island and many places in between. 
This summer I headed out with three friends on a week long camping/road 
trip in my friend's '84 Vanagon. About 30 miles outside of Rainier National 
Park, the Vanagon ceased to run. None of the obvious fixes worked, so I 
called AAA and had it towed to a parking lot and caught a ride back to 
Seattle to fetch old reliable. We cruised all over Western Washington, no 
problems. Also hauled three kids and two large (triple) sea kayaks to Lund, 
British Columbia. I haven't been let down or stranded by this bus since 
sometime around 1979 when I burnt a valve driving a sustained 85 mph to 
catch a ferry to the San Juans. This fall I managed to scrape up enough $ 
to buy my dream car, an '87 syncro Westfalia. I can't bear to part with the 
'74 though--it's really become a part of me. Is this a testimonial or what?
