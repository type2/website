Subject:      Re: To Stefan Ufer re:German wants to join list...

Also spract Joachim:
&gt;&gt;Hallo Stefan,
&gt;&gt;jasowas...no a Schwob.  I bin a gebuertiger Augschpurger, leb abr sho
&gt;&gt;lang im Exil (London, USA, usw).

Then Sami spoke up with:
&gt;&gt;Nun recket et hen, ihr Suedlinge! Wir snacken ja och net Platt uff da
&gt;&gt;Gombuda Liste! :-0 :-) :-) ;-)  Sami

now, since SStones is apparently asleep (or getting this via Digest),
here's what they were saying:

Joachim:
&quot;Yes, i was. No, a slob. I've been birthing tigers at the Auger Zoo,
laying about, sho nuff, long time in Exil (a small town near London, USA,
in the micro-south-west). &quot;

and Sami replied:
&quot;The nun wrecked the hen, and we're walking (Suede-lining it)! We snack,
on octagonal net plates, off the Gumbo List (apparent reference to Justin
Wilson's Cajun Cookbook).&quot;

doesn't make as much sense as when Sstones does it, though. :)
