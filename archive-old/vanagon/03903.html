Martha:  (or anyone, really),

What happened to the caravan thing?  Was it just one
of those things that died?  Was my name taken off
the list?  Just because I refuse to travel in the
USA doesn't mean that I'm not interested in the 
discussion or the final plans you all might come
up with.  Huh?  Someone fill me in please.  I
forgot who's managing the list.  But whoever you are;
why did you take me off?  I don't remember asking to
be removed.  Or did the logistics of the thing just get
to be too much and it died a quiet death?

The usual bowing and scraping in thanks,
                                        --Ralf
