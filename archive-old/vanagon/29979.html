Subject: Syncro pricing (was 89 Syncro for sale)


Here is another data point for the ongoing syncro pricing thread.
In june we paid $5500 for an '87 poptop weekender syncro (Westy with table
and beds but no neat camping stuff), with 105K miles and no rust.
The tranny had allegedly been rebuilt (why do we see so many 
syncros with rebuilt trannys?) and there were
 $2000K  worth of receipts to prove
it, but it still grinds from second to third so we are potentially
lookin into 2K worth of work. That will bring the total cost to
around $7500 which I believe is reasonable. I think the 10K for the
'89 is far too much unless it happens to be a Westy.
