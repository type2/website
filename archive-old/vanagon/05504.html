RMM publishes a catalog exclusive to air-cooled bus parts called 'The Bus Stop.&quot;Make sure you air-coolers ask for this.  I think (?) they have a waterboxer 
catalog, ask.

RMM is in Woodland Park, CO 80863 if any of you local-yokels wanna take a drive
or make a pilgrimage!

Again, let me praise Dave Pennell.  Not only is he a nice guy, but is a bus 
enthusiast as well!!  Since RMM works solely on commission, and bus people
ALWAYS need $$$$ ( ;) ).....  Let's just say that of the five or so folks I
have spoken to there, Dave has been the most helpful and willing to stay on the
phone for long periods as I sort out my order.  Nice guy.

For NET-iquette freaks:  THIS IS NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT!  I am in no way 
connected to RMM, this is just a personal recommendation.  I live in DC!

For our trusty VANAGON/LISTSERV staff, perhaps you could add this to the Gopher
'Some Parts Suppliers' area?  Just a suggestion.

Gruss Dich!

P.S. I CC'ed you personally, Jack.  Sorry for the info overload!
