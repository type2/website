Subject: Re: swamp coolers

&gt;
&gt;I posted something about this about 8 months or so ago, but now
&gt;that our list membership has expanded so, I'll take a chance
&gt;and repost.  I'm looking for one of those car swamp coolers -


Yeah I remember these, drove with one hanging off the front of an old 
Landrover, later transplanted to an almost as old Saab 96 for trip over 
Maroc Tunisia. They work great, nice to have cool water when you stop. It 
was simply heavy coarse canvas, several layers. You soak them overnight, 
then fill and hang in the breeze. Get one made, use part of the filler neck 
from a wine box (quality no less) and stitch it all together.
         I have seen an airconditioning unit working on this principle BTW. 
An airbox on the of of the vehicle, ducting air over/through  wet fabric and 
into the van, and a water tank + drip rail that had to be filled daily. No 
moving parts, no CFC, no work when stationary.   tim s.
