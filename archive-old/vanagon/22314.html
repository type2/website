I wear mine, ever since a head-on back in '84 (in a Toyota
truck). Totalled the truck and spent a coupla weeks in the hospital,
major reconstruction of my face (look more like my dad now than ever
before - they used him as a model!), jaws wired shut for 6 weeks,
etc....  I'll take a couple broken ribs or whatever over a smashed
face anyday....

-Mitch
