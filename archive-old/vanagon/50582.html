Subject: Valve Propane Tank

OK.....I have to at least put a new fill valve on my '85 camper's propane 
tank.  Is this a part that is available at any gas bottle suppplier or is 
it one of those dreaded OEM things?  Is there a source for new tanks that 
is not VW?  If so, does anyone know where and how much.  I hav about 
1-1/2 weeks to put this thing together before we leave.  Anything I order 
from the west coast will take at least 8 days UPS.  Apreciate you 
suggestions.
