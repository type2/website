Subject: Anyone interested in a `74 Adventurewagen? (project)

I've decided that I have way too much stuff, and this poor bus has
been languishing in an outside storage area for too long, and should
probably go to a good home.

Good things:
great interior, complete.
body straight
no rust
has an engine :)
good tires

Bad things:
multicolored
Really hacked wiring (DPO)
No clutch/throttle cables
unknown motor condition
Late `74-motor is fuel-injected (Is this a Bad Thing?)

DPO said he drove it this last winter. Kinda doubt it.
Bus is in Federal Way, WA.
Asking price? Probably around $500 obo.
