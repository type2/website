Subject: Camper Top Transplant


Has anyone ever heard of or transplanting a camper top on a Vanagon?
I have an 88GL and am thinking of cutting the metal roof off at the top of
the posts and doing the same to an old 81Westy and then welding the camper
roof to the GL body thus making a pop-top camper out of the 88GL,  Any
feedback on this?  What do you think a welding shop would charge?  I can do
the cutting - they can do the welding.

Happy Holidays to All!
Gary
