Subject: Re: Front wheel bearings

I know this is slightly off topic, but my 77 Rabbit has need for front 
wheel bearing surgery and I was wondering if anyone had any experience 
with the bearing puller/installer offered as a rental by &quot;Recycled Parts&quot; 
out of Michigan.  No one I've talked to has any experience with these 
things and it would be much easier to perform the swap with one of these 
then by pulling the entire wheel bearing housing and running it down to 
someone with an arbor press.  

Any thoughts, experiences with one of these would help me decide whether 
it's worth the trouble to rent it and do the install myself.  

Jack
