   No it's not! It's just sleeping.  I had a emgine with NO compression on
2 cylinders and it was a simple vavle adjustment.  After that it has run
fine and still is.  No compression can mean a bunch of things.  Don't give
up so quickly.  If after a valve adjustment you still have no compression
then I'd say it may be toast but it still may be just a head not an entire
engine!  I don't want to replace an engine or rebuild a bottom end unless
I REALY have to.
