Subject: Additional stop and running light capability?

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees, 
Has anyone any experience installing additional tail and stop light
capabilities such as &quot;Cyclop's&quot; eyes or horizontal &quot;strips&quot; of lights
mounted on/in a Vanagon?

I have a white '84 Westy, and twice this week, I've been told that the tail
and stop lights on the vehicle are hard to see.  

Thanks,
