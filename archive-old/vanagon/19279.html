&gt;&quot;What creative ways have you discovered for the ashtray in the middle
&gt;&gt; of your Vanagon dashboard?...&quot;

In a beetle I once owned I fitted a microswitch behind the ashtray so the 
engine only ran if it was pulled out by the right amount (a couple of mm). A 
thief would have a hard time finding it, even by chance. In the bus, I keep 
spare bulbs and fuses in there.
