Subject: Re: '91 Westy gasoline heater

Hi Neil.  I've seen that heater.. a whopping $1500 option when new.  
I don't have one, but know about them.  They aren't that great as you 
can't run them for more than 20 minutes at a time, etc.  We were 
going to order it, but the dealer talked us out of it... glad he did!

The winters here are quite mild... and usually the stock rear heater 
is more than sufficient to warm the van while driving.  Your friends 
heater is to be used when camped only (I'm pretty sure).  I live in 
the Lower Mainland, and I could try and help the guy out.  Is he on 
email?

Harry.

&gt; A friend in Vancouver has a '91 Westy with gasoline heater. The controls
&gt; for the heater are on the left side of the dash; little LCD display, as I
&gt; remember. Anyway, the thing is stock VW.
&gt; 
&gt; He hasn't got a clue as to how to use it. This brings up two questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Clearly the winter weather in Vancouver is not that bad, as he's had the
&gt; car for four years, and
&gt; 2) I guess the manual didn't come with the car.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone can kindly send instructions, I'll forward them. What with
&gt; global warming coming any day now, it all seems academic to me, but you
&gt; never can tell.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
