Subject: putting bus to bed

Hi All!
I am just working out the last bits of my contract with an employer in
Singapore, which means I will be leaving the country at the end of the
month, for at least a year.  This also means that the Duckmobile will need
to go into hybernation for some time.  Any suggestions on preparing it for
the sleep.  I will be leaving it at my parents' house, so they can run it
up and down the driveway once in a while.  Would it be wise to put it
under a cover?  It has some seam rust, and will be in Connecticut...
TIA
Mark
