Subject: T-shirt/Sticker Orders


I'll be receipting the following people tomorrow for their orders. If your
name appears here but you do not get a receipt by pmail within 48 hours,
you should get with me (merely means I screwed up). More importantly, if
you sent an order but your name does not appear here, the order is lost so
you should get with me ASAP.

It's too late for T-shirts and it's too late to change your T-shirt color.
It's not too late for stickers, though, because I had to buy a whole roll
of them. If you want a sticker but haven't ordered yet please contact me
for an order form.

Delivery time on these should be approximately three weeks from now.
