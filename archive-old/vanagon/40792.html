Actually, we are talking about replacing the nut aren't we? The bolt is a 
stud with a cap nut, at least in the drawings in Bentley. From what I can 
tell by reading the manual, there is no need to seal the stud, just the cap 
nut. And is there need to use a new nut or can the old one be cleaned, 
sealed, and reinstalled?

Thanks for the help with this Dennis.
