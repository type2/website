Subject: cold start/idle problems with 2.1 digifa


Hello all.........

When I start my engine after it has sat all night (ie. a cold start) it will 
not stay running unless I keep slight pressure on the gas pedal.  It will 
also stall while idling at a stop light.  This behavior continues until the 
engine has warmed up, then it runs fine.

I think this is because of a bad coolant temp sensor (sender?).  Since it is 
bad, the default setting is for a running engine and when cold the engine 
requires a richer mix.  Without the input from the temp sensor the engine 
runs as if it were warm (to lean) and stalls.  I got a temp sensor (with a 
blue connector) from the dealer, that looks like the one in my bentley, but 
I cannot see it on the coolant manifold on the front left side of the engine 
(looking into the engine compartment from the rear).

I replaced the idle stabilizer valve in my attempts to correct the problem 
with not difference (it was not humming or vibrating)

 -do these symptoms really indicate a bad temp sensor?
 -did I get the right sensor and am I just blind?

Thanks,
Fred Porter
