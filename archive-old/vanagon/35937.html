Subject:      going somewhere??? ...

then you might want to have a map of how to get there from here ... or maybe
just a map to show what's where when you are there. in either case, this is
a neat place that has all sorts of maps that you can't usually find in the
bookstore:


Map Link                          maps of the world, u.s., canada,
25 East Mason Street              mexico, and nearly all other countries
Santa Barbara,  CA  93101         around the globe, city maps, and some
(805) 965-4402                    topological maps of the u.s., canada,
(800) 627-7768 FAX toll-free.     mexico, france, britian, and some
catalog $3.00                     others. neat stuff for map freaks.

they take credit cards and are nice folks to deal with. :)
