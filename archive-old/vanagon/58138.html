Subject: VW Stickers
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I have a few &quot;drivers wanted&quot; stickers that a friend gave me.  If 
anyone wants one, I'd be happy to mail them out.  First come, first 
serve.  They're about 8&quot; x 2&quot; and have a small blue VW emblem with 
&quot;Drivers wanted.&quot; next to it.  They're the type of sticker that goes on 
the inside of a window.  e-mail me directly please.  
Scott
