Subject: Apologies...

Martha recently wrote to me:
&gt;I will probably choose not to attend trips which Glen and
&gt;his wife and Ron and Dan choose to attend, but that seems
&gt;my business.  And if they decide not to attend trips I am
&gt;on, that is theirs, and I will certainly understand.   I
&gt;think I would probably have better R &amp; R to be around
&gt;people with whom I have more in common,
&gt;and judging from the responses I got, our group size
&gt;hasn't been much impacted.   Three people told me 
&gt;privately they wouldn't camp unless I was there, and
&gt;that they will not show up if any of the above 4 do.

I apologize to the three people who wrote to Martha and said that they
would not attend camping trips with me.  I feel really bad about this, as
it was not my intention to fracture the group.  My intentions were really
the opposite... some group members were hurt by plastic burning, and I was
trying to make the campouts a friendlier place for everyone.  I really
didn't expect that some people felt so strongly about burning plastic that
they would shun me.

I would like to correct this situation.  If the three people Martha has
mentioned would write to me, perhaps we can come to some understanding.  As
I said before, I just want to make the CCC camping trips a pleasant
experience all-around.

Oh, and I care for Martha very much, and would never avoid a campout
because she was there.  I also apologize if I gave this impression.

Thanks for your patience,
Mea culpa, mea culpa...

Ron (Coyote)
