Subject: AC RETROFIT R12 to R134a

                      VANAGON AIRCONDITIONING
           RETOFITTING R12 SYSTEMS TO R134A SYSTEMS
                       MODEL: 1985-1992

    This infomation came from Mitchell international 1995 data

   Cautions: Part numbers for reference only. check with your
             parts dept. for latest info.

             Always use seperate refrigerant recovery, recycling
             recahrging and etc. equipment. Damage to equipment
             will resault.

             Do not blow compressed air and nitrogen through the
             compressor or expansion valve. Refrigerant circuits
             retrofittied to use R134a must not be rinsed with R11.

             Always replace receiver drier if refrigerant circuit
             it left open.

             Due to residual amounts of mineral based refrigerant oil
             in systems retrofitted the newly installed PAG refrigerant
             oil will discolor immediately after use. This is normal
             does not indicate a refigerant related fault.

PROCEDURE:

-- Discharge and capture refrigerant R12 using appropreate equipment.

-- Evacuater system to remove any R12 contaminants.

-- Remove compressor, unscrew oil drain plug and drain refrigerant oil.

-- Replace defective components. Add PAG oil directly to new system
   component, as per the following chart. Never exceed the total system
   oil capacity.
                     Condenser          0 cc
                     Evaporator         60 cc  (2 fl oz)
                     Receiver Drier     10 cc  (.3 fl oz)
                     High Pressure Hose 10 cc  (.3 fl oz)
                     Low Pressure Hose  10 cc  (.3 fl oz)
    Vanagon          Total System Oil   240 cc (8 fl oz)
    Eurovan  1 comp. Total System Oil   135 cc (4.5 fl oz)

-- Refill compressor, with remaining amount of PAG oil to equal the
   total system oil, and install with new o-ring seals.

-- Replace receiver drier. Use new o-ring seals.

-- Install correct R-134a service valve, from adaper kit.
      high pressure-  3/8&quot; thread
      low pressure-  7/16&quot; thread

-- Evacuate system for a minimum of 30 minutes.

-- Charge system with refigerant R134a.

-- Perform a/c system quality check and leak test.

-- Install new R134a adhesive labels over R12 labels.


        A personal note:
 That's all there is to it in a Vanagon. I have installed AC in
 a few autos but have not tried a R134 conversion yet. It sounds
 to easy to be true. But to the best of my knowledge the source
 of this infomation is very reliable. If anyone gives this a try
 please Email me with the results.

  P.S. As I uploaded this file my secretary handed me my mail
       with info on FRIGG FR12. Form Fit and Function compatable
       with R12  HUmmm????
