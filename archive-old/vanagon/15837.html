&gt; Hi everyone.  Just FYI here that Westfalia's are still available in 
&gt; Canada.  Apparently the Winnebago will be coming north as a 1996 
&gt; model.  This information is from my dealer as of yesterday.  They had 
&gt; a white one listed at $38,025 CDN in the showroom... 5 speed, a/c, 
&gt; cruise.  No ABS.

Same over here in Victoria, Speedway Volkswagen has a slew of them in the
parking lot, tops-popped.
