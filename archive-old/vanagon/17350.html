Subject: Re: arm rest vents

&gt;
&gt;Looking at my plumbing, that thingy that always gets crudded up
&gt;with pencils, pipe cleaners, straw papers, &amp;c is heat only. The vent
&gt;to the back would seem to have to come from under the dash and get
&gt;distributed to the doors to empty out in the rear....I don't seem
&gt;to see any provision for that in mine....Hmmm.
&gt;
&gt;Is there anyone out there with a non-Westy '71 with the air channels
&gt;on the doors, so we can compare notes (I'll show you mine if you
&gt;show me yours!)?
&gt;

I think they would be the same as in a '78 7 seater I had. Part of the fresh 
air distribution pipes came out under the dash near the door hinge with a 
felt gasket around it. Closing the door sealed the amrest onto the outlet, 
for air flow. The arm rests went all the way across the door panel, and 
ended with a typical ventilator louvre facing the passengers in the middle 
seat. Should be an easy mod., but there is no need for air there in a Westy, 
since the cabinets or jump seat will block the louvres. That floor duct was 
heat only.
