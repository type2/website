&gt; 
&gt; Also make sure the oil level is proper - not empty (since you're leaking) 
&gt; and not too full, since that will put extra pressure on the seal (or
&gt; what's left of it...)

How much trans. oil should be in there? I was always told to fill it
until the level was even with the filler hole on the side. Is this too
much? If so, how does one tell how much to put in?
