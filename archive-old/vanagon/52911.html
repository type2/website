So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; Europe in my '56.
&gt; 
&gt; With this in mind, my wife bought me a neat birthday present...a Grundig 
&gt; 50th anniversary 960 table model AM/FM/SW desk top radio. Its neat...got a 
&gt; wooden case, big tuning knobs, gold cloth speaker cover..push 
&gt; buttons...typical of German 1950sroduct design, much the same as my '56..
&gt; 
&gt; So if you are looking for a neat christmas or whatever idea...try this.

Oh sure... I'm sure my wife can find one 'off-the-shelf' at Walmart... ;)

Congratulations Ric.... you lucky dog....  Or should I say you luck 'old'
dog!  ;p    :)
