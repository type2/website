Subject: Re: CB placement

&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.

Hey Brett,
     I installed my CB below the radio and differential lock controls at the
center of the dash.  The CB is a large unit 7&quot;x9&quot;x2&quot;, the bottom of it is
about 2&quot; off the floor.  The mic hangs below the heater controls.  This
location is out of the way and still accessible.  It is a bit of a reach to
change channels though.  '86 Vanagon Syncro.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
