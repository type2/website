Subject: Thank you!, 70 single-cab saga...

	Thanks to Gerry, David, Richard, Joel, Joe, Bill W. and Alistair
for their kind suggestions on my CV bolts. As you all read, Ian got them
out for me after thoroughly cleaning 4, and pounding-in the 12 point
tool, and used the universally recomended vice grips on the last 2. He's 
quite a guy, my brother!

	And I'm chagrinned to admit that my cleaning of the area was
less than it could have been. Ok- no excuses- I should have cleaned
better.

	Joel suggests using all 12-point bolts to simplify removal
later and its a good suggestion. I'll add 24 new bolts to the list
of stuff to buy.

	I've got 4 new CV boots, 4 new CV joints and another $500
on the credit card this morning, but the axles are ready to go in.
I used Gunk Engine Brite (tm) to clean the worst gunge off the tranny
and took it down for new final drive and main seals this morning too.

	As I was throwing away the empty Gunk can, I was disappointed
to read that it was illegal (and presumably wrong) to flush Gunk
engine cleaner down storm sewers in California. One is supposed to rinse
with minimum water, collect the residue and evaporate the water, 
disposing of the remaining goo with the hazardous waste people.

	Well heck! I didn't mean to be an environmental disaster. I
guess I know now and will have to put together a parts-cleaning bench of
some kind, or leave it to the pros. 
	Like, I can really see myself cleaning a transmission in a
trash-can to catch all the rinse water... On the other had, I guess
it would work, and I don't want to drink used Gunk anymore than
anyone else...


	I've heard Simple Green spray cleaner spoken of well as a 
degreaser- for bicycle chains for example. Anyone tried doing engine
tin with it?  Well, I will and I'll report my results. Orange hand
cleaner is another possibility I suppose. Might be just the thing for
the last of the sticky crud that I haven't gotten off the tranny case
yet.

Worst comes to worst, I suppose I can take the tin into the shop that I've
just done $$$$ business with and ask them to degrease it in their setup.


	Someone posted that they'd been on digest mode for a day and
missed everyone- I can definately relate! Wish I didn't have to choose
between getting my job done and staying on top of this list. People
on this list are wonderful and I'm proud to know you all!
