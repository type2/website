Subject: [A] FS: 1976 Bus, 77000 miles (WV)

Well I hate to do this but I've been putting it off long enough. For Sale:
    1976 VW Transporter, basic 7 passenger Bus with no real options.
    4 spd., 2.0 liter Bosch fuel injected Type IV engine.
    Repainted AFRICAN RED to the roof line to look like an older bus on last
paint including doors, hatch, and inside windshield frame, inside floor and
roof PASTEL WHITE.
    My father bought new for $5,500 in 1977 from Griffith VW, Clarksburg, WV.
    Genuinely 77,000 miles, odometer has always funtioned.
    Clean interior taken from a '73 with seats repadded, front seats OK but
drivers side has 1 split, standard fitted rubber floor mats.
    All new WCM window and door rubber including vent windows $$$
    Engine replaced at around 68,500 miles, oil pressure light burnt out
then the oil pump failed and presto, seized engine, was replaced in 1985 or
86 with genuine $1900 OEM rebuild, bought from VW.
    Dad was an engineer at a couple of radio stations and only really drove
this bus once a week 40 or 50 miles to transmitters in the middle of nowhere,
so although low miles it led a rougher than average life as an equipment hauler
and as a ten mile a day 3 kid hauler while we were in school (we killed interior
So when given to me with 73,000 in early 1987 those back roads had taken their
toll and the steering mount though not rusted fractured off the front beam, so
it got sidelined in late 1987, since the engine was basically new at the time
we just couldnt get rid of it and we decided to take it apart, do some body work
etc. It had had a so so quality repaint in 1984 and Dad had crumpled the left
rocker on a stump and backed it into a few things and with less than average,
since it was ZIEBARTED when new, ten year old Bus rust from the salt belt it
needed a little work.  Unfortunately we took it completely apart in our garage
and it took a bit longer to get together than anticipated (sigh, good project).
     In general all glass removed, both rockers replaced in steel, rear corner
damage sandblasted and fiberglassed since we didn't know steel was available at
time, dents or rust spots to bare metal, treated and filled, finished and primed
by me then pro sprayed in hardened PPG acrylic enamel ($300 I supplied materials
     Finished in 1993, started weekly and driven a mile or two monthly during wo
gas stabilizer used etc.  FRANKLY THIS IS NOT A LONG TERM (FOREVER) KEEPER. Thou
correctly maintained since new it was worked and had above average small
accident damage and ten years of rust belt exposure.  The bus looks near
new now and is mechanically perfect and with the basically new engine should run
another 100,000+, no cancerous rust ever but surface rust will surface as always
through fiberglass in another five or so years.
    Two years ago I purchased a 73 1/2 from New Mexico and dont need the '76.
I have put about a couple thousand miles a year on it since we finished it and
is great as driver. Recently all new OEM Brazil HD COFAB shocks and front rotors
Only current needs, inner cv's will fail by 100,000 (slight pitting now) and all
the larger vacuum lines on the f.i. could used replaced as well as the lines on
fuel ring although no current problems, lines up to ring replaced as well as all
small vacuum lines. Needs fuel gauge sender and tires are new but got them free
friend and are car tires suited primarily for city driving if you aren't used to
?handling?  Gets 18 mpg city and highway average and thats all it ever did.
Cruises 75 mph comfortably and f.i. starts and runs perfectly.  Heater boxes and
exhaust new with engine.  I have my heart set on buying a nice 1 owner 1974 Thin
just found so if you are near and looking for a solid running Bus call me and co
give it a look, probably one of the nicest drivers in north WV, east OH, sw PA,
and west MD. Sorry I went on like this I do love the thing so.

$2900 obo.
