&gt;THE FOLLOWING FORWARDED POST IS
&gt;ABOUT PHONY POLLS, BUT THE INFORMATION
&gt;IN IT CAN BE APPLIED TO SHOW THE
&gt;AMAZING POWER OF E-MAIL
&gt;========================================
&gt;
&gt;PHONY POLLS, PHONY BALLOTS
&gt;
&gt;How many of you have ever been &quot;polled&quot; by any of the major
&gt;media, the wire services, or any joint effort of same (No, Bill, not 
&gt;that kind of joint), by the people who report these things in the
&gt;media at large?  How many of you know someone who has been
&gt;similarly &quot;polled&quot;?  How many of you know someone who knows
&gt;someone who knows someone.....(ad  infinitum)?
&gt;
&gt;There's a book called &quot;Votescam&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Get it.
&gt;
&gt;Read it.
&gt;
&gt;Consider this:  Studies have shown that by 4-5 (at most) &quot;friend
&gt;of a friend of a friend.....&quot;-type linkages, anyone in the world can be  
&gt;associated with anyone else in the world.
&gt;     [APPLY THAT IDEA TO E-MAIL]
&gt;To support that statement, I offer the following simple analysis:   
&gt;Every
&gt;one of you reading this has at least 100 acquaintances with whom you 
&gt;are on a first name, speaking basis, and probably a whole lot more.  
&gt;If you don't, you're a hermit.
&gt;
&gt;Therefore:
&gt;
&gt;Friends --------------------------------------------------------- 100 
&gt;Friends of friends --------------------------------------------10,000 
&gt;Friends of friends of friends ----------------------------- 1,000,000 
&gt;Friends of friends of friends of friends ---------------- 100,000,000 
&gt;Friends of friends of friends of friends of friends -- 10,000,000,000 
&gt;      [APPLY THAT IDEA TO E-MAIL]
&gt;There are less than 6,000,000,000 people on the planet, and again,
&gt;100 is a low estimate for the number acquaintances of an individual.  
&gt;I hope it's clear that by way of, at most, friends of friends of friends 
&gt;of friends of  friends, everyone on the Earth is acquainted with
&gt;everyone else.
&gt;      [HIT THAT 'FORWARD' BUTTON]
&gt;So, how many of you have been &quot;polled&quot;, or knows someone who
&gt;knows someone......
&gt;
&gt;I became aware of the above analysis through conversations and
&gt;research concerning the FBI's much-coveted roving wiretap, phone
&gt;record blanket subpoena, and &quot;guilt by association&quot; legislation (the 
&gt;&quot;terrorist&quot; bill, et
&gt;
&gt;al) but then that's another story........
&gt;
&gt;Again, I ask, how many of you have been &quot;polled&quot;?  How many know
&gt;someone who knows someone.....?
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, how many of you know someone who has AIDS?
&gt;Chances are, you know AT LEAST one.
&gt;
&gt;How many of you know someone with MS?  That's a pretty rare
&gt;disease.
&gt;
&gt;How many of you know someone who has Bell's Palsy (paralysis of
&gt;one or both sides of the face)?  That's extremely rare, yet I've known 
&gt;two people so afflicted.
&gt;
&gt;How many of you know or have met: a celebrity of any sort; a rock
&gt;star specifically; a sky-diver; an author; someone who knows
&gt;someone who won the lottery?  I can answer affirmatively to all of
&gt;the above, and most of you can, as well.
&gt;
&gt;One last time - how many of you even knows someone who knows
&gt;someone who.....?  (I don't, and chances are that you don't)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Do you see where this is going?  THERE AIN&quot;T NO STINKING
&gt;POLLS!!! NADA!!!
&gt;
&gt;Maybe they're asking the &quot;Neilsen Families&quot;, I don't know.
&gt;(Just kidding.  Ever heard of TEMPEST?)
&gt;
&gt;There are, on the 'net, several references to and reviews of the
&gt;book &quot;Votescam&quot;.  Go to:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.altavista.digital_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt;and enter the search term &quot;Votescam&quot;.  Read all of the reviews.
&gt;Buy the book.
&gt;
&gt;The ballot box has been &quot;fixed&quot; in this country for many years now.  
&gt;The prerequisite for &quot;fixing&quot; the ballot box, in this age of mass
&gt;communications, is to first &quot;fix&quot; the &quot;polls&quot;.  That way, the  
&gt;validity of
&gt;the &quot;outcome&quot; is never questioned and the illusion of &quot;Democracy&quot;
&gt;(hold on while I wash my hands) is maintained.
&gt;
&gt;Go to the local shopping mall, stand outside Orange Julius or
&gt;Banana Republic (that's right, you're looking good), and ask people 
&gt;who they're going to vote for.  Are you ready for the big surprise?  
&gt;Neither &quot;Bill&quot; nor &quot;Bob&quot; is going to get even 20% of the total.  A whole 
&gt;lot of people are going to look at you as though you just puked on their 
&gt;shoes.  A whole lot of the people are going to tell you, with despair in 
&gt;their voices, that it doesn't make a damned bit of difference.
&gt;
&gt;On second thought, save yourself the trauma, get &quot;Votescam&quot;, read it, 
&gt;then give it to a friend.  It's a hell of a lot less scary than the  
&gt;sight of the
&gt;walking wounded that you'll get at the mall.
&gt;
&gt;The biggest problem in this country is the utterly ignorant, spoon-fed  
&gt;electorate.  Would you PLEASE WAKE UP!?
&gt;

&gt;(Don't forget, &quot;Votescam&quot;)
