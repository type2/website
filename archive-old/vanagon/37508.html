Subject: ARCHIVES:  Propane fill valve repair

it's that time of year.  thoughts of s'mores, mosquitos, and propane. 
 since there is no NEW knowledge in the universe, i'll draw from an
 earlier post of mine from the archives.

the installation of this kit fixed my leaking fill valve that would 
spray propane back out that tiny pin-hole.

------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

&gt; today i received and installed the propane fill valve rebuild kit.
&gt; thanks go to Derek for the tip on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; the kit consists of 4 O-rings, a small inlet screen and a *very*
&gt; small amount of lubricant.  for those of us that have had problems
&gt; with propane leaking back out after a fill, this _may_ be the ticket,
&gt; time will tell.
&gt; 
&gt; the fill valve itself is a simple affair (well, as simple as affairs
&gt; go) basically held together by 4 screws in the cover.  i rebuilt mine
&gt; with the valve removed from the tank but it would be possible to do
&gt; it with the valve still attached, just harder to get everything clean.
&gt; rebuild consists essentially of cleaning the old grease out and
&gt; installing and lubricating the new o-rings.  pretty cake stuff and a
&gt; nice set of instructions are included with the kit.  oh, when you get
&gt; that special enclosed grease on your finger ready to greeze (as we
&gt; say in the woods) everything up-- don't wipe yer nose and lose the
&gt; grease... there's enough to do the job, period.
&gt; 
&gt; here's the scoop:
&gt; PN V20128  PISTON O-RING KIT W/LUBE
&gt; avail from Manchester Tank 800/877-9923
&gt; cost $4.01 per kit (a veritable bargain)
&gt; COD's done over the phone but it cost me over $9 for shipping/COD
&gt; 
&gt; note:  the invoice says &quot;THIS IS A ONE TIME ONLY SALE PLEASE CONTACT
&gt; YOUR LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR (yeah, right.  in northern MN?) FOR FURTHER
&gt; ORDERS.&quot;  so do it once and do it big!
