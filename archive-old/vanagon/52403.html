&gt; I wrote:  &lt;&lt; the Westy rear seat can be  clicked into  position facing
&gt; backwards, forming a nice chaise which we find comfortable for reading before
&gt; bedtime. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You responded: &lt;&lt; How exactly do you accomplish this wonderful trick? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;    Here it is:  With the seat in the bed mode, we're sitting on the middle
&gt; portion, feet up on the large mattress pad facing rearwards; then reach back to
&gt; pull the seat cushion up into place in order to serve as a backrest.  There
&gt; should be a click as it locks.  Our weight on the bottom cushion prevents it
&gt; from attempting to convert itself from a chaise back into a forward facing seat
&gt; as we lean back! &lt;G&gt;

Cool!! I just had to run out to the garage &amp; try this! Now I can't 
wait for our next trip to test it out! German engineering never 
ceases to amaze me... :)
