Subject: TDC Sender
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

When is the TDC sender used on the 2.1 engine? How much do they cost and do I really need it? The one on my engine has been broken off and I
figured since the engine is out of the van It would be a good time to
replace it with a good one.


Thanks
