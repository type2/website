&gt; 1)  Trying to replace coolant temp. sensor for FI.  Part given to me is
&gt; #025 906 041A.  Part I think (or thought) in van is #251 919 372.  Part
&gt; (again I thought) is at top of coolant expansion tank in rear corner of
&gt; engine compartment.  New part doesn't look like old part and old wire
&gt; connector won't fit into new part either.  Am I trying to stick this
&gt; thing in the wrong place?  Or do I need a different sensor?  HELP!!!

The item in the top of the coolant tank is not a temperature sensor.  It is a
level sensor.  When the coolant level gets below the bottom of the level
sensor probes, the circuit is interrupted and the red light in your
temperature gage goes on.
 
&gt; 2)  Have had power problem for the last year.  
&lt;snip&gt;
  &gt;Symptoms--original: after driving for an hour or so, severe loss of
 &gt;power; okay again after it cools completely.  No indication of trouble
 &gt;when going on short trips around town.  Newest:  Won't budge, idles
 &gt;okay--little rough maybe; pressing gas=very rough, loss of RPMs, nearly
 &gt;dying.  Put it into reverse or forward and it'll idle/coast.  Press gas,
 &gt;wants to die.  NOTE:  Will work perfect for 1-3 weeks (even when I push
 &gt;it and drive all day) after--it seems--I fool enough in engine
 &gt;compartment.  i.e. new plug wires--worked for 3 weeks; got new intake
 &gt;boot on all the way--worked for 1 week; wouldn't go anywhere for a week
 &gt;then I replaced vacuum piece at throttle body and it made one round trip
 &gt;to Baton Rouge (roughly 3 hours of driving including errands) before
 &gt;dying again at home.
 
Some of the symptoms sounds like it might be the catalytic convertor.
 Although other symptoms do not, it might be worth a check.
