&gt;Agreed, my guess is that the bulk of the 13 Canadians on this list come
&gt;from a) BC and b) Ontario with some 4,500 miles between them!. If it
&gt;matters, I come from Ontario (Ottawa).

nyuk nyuk nyuk. i keep track of the province (and cities) on this stuff,
but the dippy program hasn't had enough minor amounts of major modifications
to dump it out yet. here's the CAN tot-sheet:

British Columbia  - 2
New Brunswick - 2
Ontario - 7
Saskatchewan - 1
Unknown - 1

so at least we can rule out Alberta, Yukon, and the Nortwest Territories!
Saskatoon is gonna be tricky, though. :)
