Subject: Alternative Instrumentation

With all this discussion about instrumentation, ie Cylinder Head Temp, Oil
Temp, Oil Pressure, etc. I'm wondering if anyone on this list has ever used
a small microcontroller to sample instrumentation sending units through a
DAC and output something that would be useful for a driver to see?

One might go further and add a gas flow meter, wheel rotation sensor, etc.
and make a complete onboard driving computer.

Just wondering.
