Subject: Re:lifters, help.

&gt;Make sure that your pushrods are seated into their pockets at the lifters, 
feel around a bit. I rotate the rods with my fingertips while tightening the 
rocker shaft nuts, its fun coordinating all the rods together. If that 
doesn't help, make sure the hydraulic lifters are themselves all the way 
down their holes and move freely when you turn the crank. After that I'm 
beat! DON'T shim your rocker mounts, if you drop a pushrod out of place 
while running and it opens the exhaust valve way into the cylinder you'll 
bend a valve stem, at least. Be prepared for some valve rocker clatter while 
your lifters fill up to the right clearance when you start it up. If it 
doesn't pass after a minute or so shut it off! 
        For good measure did you throw in new pushrod seals?, don't use a 
sealant, the seals move to allow for thermal expansion of the cyl. barrels. 
I've used hi-temp silicone sealant, it pulled away and leaked within a month 
on the '78 2.00litre I used to own.    tjs
