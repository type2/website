Subject: Re: Fwd: Best Value Auto Clubs?

Volks,
If you have access to USAA auto insurance, the USAA Road and Travel Plan
cannot be beat. I dropped USAA auto insurance years ago as to expensive,
but have kept my Auto Club with them: Points:
1)$42/year
2)Towing of $100: You pay up front with whoever you choose and are
reimbursed- 
3) Lockout of $100: Again hire anyone and get reimbursed
4) All the regular amenities: Trip Routing/Maps etc., flats changed
The Towing and Lockout I beleive are superior as I can use whoever I
want and get good quick service. The will dispatch a wrecker from thier
800#, but thier network is limited.
