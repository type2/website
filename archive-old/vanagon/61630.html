Subject: Friday fun: GDead and VWs

After I told him I was buying a Vanagon, one of my Deadhead friends
sent me this article from Car &amp; Driver (allegedly) about the
connection between the Grateful Dead and VWs, in particular the
Transporter.  I won't post it to the list because it's long, but
it's on my VW page (see .sig).

Enjoy.
