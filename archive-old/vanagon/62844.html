Subject: Re: Camping suggestions in Vermont New Hampshire?

    Louise, don't forget the Grand Isle ferry 20 minutes north of
Burlington... That ferry is the shortest (12 minutes) and there is a
kinda neat campground right there off the ferry landing (2 miles)

    On Grand Isle itself is a Great campground at the north end of the
Island in North Hero... &quot;North Hero State Park&quot; Very small (35-40 sites)
all sites are surrounded by trees(can't see your neighbors) and you only
have a short walk thru a wetlands area to the Frigid waters of Lake
Champlain..

    Access to all manor of Unique North country sights including &quot;the
Fort that No- one wanted&quot; a fort above Rouses Point NY (Right on the
Border) that for many years was said to belong to both the US and Canada
and neither one claimed it!

    Also a Library near St Albans VT that has the US/CDN border running
thru the middle of the building...

        Tons of Places to camp up and down NH too...

        here in NH the Local supermarket has a  section for free Camping
Brochures (NH loves Campers)and it has stuff for MA, ME, NH, CT, RI, VT,
and I think NY... Both State and Private Campgrounds as well as local
attractions...
