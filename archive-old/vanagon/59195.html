Subject: Dometic fridge update- my .02

Hi all, 
	Here's the latest on my on going path to Dometic discovery. Following
Derek Drew's excellent archives article, I installed a $15 Radio Shack
thermometer(w/remote sensor)and a tiny 12v. fan in my fridge. I opted to
mount the micro-mini toggle switch for the fan to the right of the gas
on/off control. Actually, I drilled directly through the center of the
Dometic emblem(a small satisfaction)and clipped the length of the switch
to a nub. This is important due to fridge door clearance when closed! 
	The wiring runs along the inside top right corner of the fridge and
then out underneath the top hinge of the door. It looks very clean and
the emblem hides the switch pretty well. A tip- test the thermometer you
buy BEFOFE installing. Mine was on the &quot;celsius&quot; setting and gave me
heart palapitations after I had meticulously
finished running all the wires. One more tip on lighting the thing, run
it on either 12 or 120v for a bit, then(while on knees, pray) try
lighting it AT NIGHT. This lets me see through the site glass when it
fires. I think the flame can get blown out by continually
clicking/pumping the peizo. Anyway, thanks for all the gems you've
passed on to me.
Jay
