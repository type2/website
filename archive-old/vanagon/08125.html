	John,

	I'd drain the system completely. Then I'd put in a gallon or so, 
drive about 10 miles, drain it again and replace the fuel filter at the
second draining. Remember to drain the filter, accumulator and associated
hoses on the first go-round too. Since the injection system recirculates
the fuel, a couple of minutes running will bring any pockets of bad gas
to equilibrium mixture with the 'rinse' gallon. 

	You could burn-off the bad gas, in small batches, or give it
to your local municipal toxic waste collection place. Label it clearly
if you put it in any container with a lid. Please don't just dump it
out on the ground, or mix it with your used oil for recycling to deal with.

	Bill
