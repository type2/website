Mmmhh.. Maybe you can glue or weld a small, flat nut under the plate
(making sure it will not interfere with the advance mechanism)? 

Or retap the hole to the next bigger size and use a bigger screw? (then
you'll probably have to widen the hole in each new set of points, too). 

Or hope someone on this list has an extra (defectuous) distributor to give
away?

Or maybe go breakerless with a $100 compu-fire (or similar) setup. :)
