Subject: oil temps 200what?

 Where can I get factory info on oil temps?  Many people have different
stories.  What is a good open road temp.  I am running a self rebuilt 1600dp
in a 71 bus and using a dip stick guage the engine is set up for full flow
but am running only external oil filter till i am sure the engine is dialed
in then i will add the cooler and fan.  on the open road its running just
under 210 and in town at 185 I ran up an mountain pass today from 7000 to
9500 feet in 7 miles and the temp went just over 250 and cooled back down the
other side.  some people say never over 215 others + a VW mag says never over
265 what gives now that i have some investment in the bus where or what is
the correct info.

Tim
