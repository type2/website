The awning/screenhouse is just what I've been looking for with no success !
Could you post more info please ?  How much ?  Who is the manufacture ?
Will it fit a Vanagon camper ?  I've contacted. RV dealers around here
(Ottawa) and they didn't know of anything that would work.  Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Frank
