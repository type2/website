Subject: Re: hoses for pipes

Has anyone given any thought to using Aeroquip braided stainless hoses
on their watercooled/wasserboxers made from the years 1983 to
whenever(manditory bus content, don't want to get refer to the
webmaster)  Anyway I dont think it would be 1200.00$ to replace the
pipes with braided stainless from someone like Earls Supply, they can
supply any size or end that would work
