&gt;valve adjustments pretty often? My Diesel has now 150,000 km
&gt;and I had no need for valve adjustments. I would not say any
&gt;wrong, but there should be hydraulic lifters.

COMMENT: I believe that later VW diesels had hydraulic lifters.  Too late for Vanagon,
         though.

&gt;&gt;what to look for:
&gt;&gt; have someone drive it (hard), and follow behind.  Too much
&gt;&gt; diesel smoke may mean at the very least neglected valve
&gt;&gt; adjustments.
&gt;
&gt;Black smoke on full acceleration means worn-out injection jets.
&gt;I still have the first jets in, pushing out the black smoke.

QUESTION: Is this because the jets are not atomizing the fuel effectively, resulting in
          poor combustion?
