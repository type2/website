Subject: vanagon questions to the folks that know

Hi all-
 Just subscibed to this list because I may in the very near future be a
Vanagon owner but have a lot of questions first...
    the vanagon in question is a 1984, barebones Vanagon.  The only
'feature' it really has is an awesome (probably 3' x 3') sunroof....it has
4 new tires, new water pump, all newly done brakes, mostly new exhaust and
only 37,000 original miles..the asking price is $4500.  My fiance and I
test drove it the other day and really liked it except for the lack of
power and the fact that it felt like it was about to blow over any time it
got windy.  We were pretty much set on buying it but then yesterday I went
to the library and read what Consumer Reports had to say about the 84
Vanagon and they didn't really have anything good to say about
it.._dot_complained a lot about the power and emergency handling of it.  We
told the person selling it that we didn't want to buy it due to what was
read in the consumer reports and he told me that consumer reports was
slanted toward Japanese vehicles and if we really wanted to know about
Vanagon's we should talk to Vanagon owners; hence, my subscription to this
list.
    so....I have a few questions...1)how does $4500 sound as a price? 2)
Are there shortcomings specific to an 84 that would've contributed to
consumer report's horrible review of the vehicle? 3)The head gaskets look
to be in good shape, could somebody give me a liklyhood (in a percentage)
that these are going to start leaking and become a costly repair?
    Any additional information is welcome...

thank you-
mike
