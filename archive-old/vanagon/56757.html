Subject: Crazy Oil leak-86 2.1 L Syncro

Hey Vanagonauts

My 86 Syncro developed a new and unusual problem recently.  While running
(only while running) oil streams out from the rear of the engine (close to
the bumper)  It seems to be flow according to the speed of the engine.  I
know that my rear oil seal is bad, it always leaks oil.  I usually just
check the oil level and copmpensate accordingly, but this problem is
strange.  Could this be the same seal accelerated to drastic proportions??
Or, is it something else?

I'm getting nervious, this van is supposed to take me back to work in only
1.5 months, I'd hate to fly.  If it can't make the journey around the city
of Minneapolis it certainly can't make it to Denail Alaska.
