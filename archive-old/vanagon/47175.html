Subject: Re: '93 Eurovan

EV at 45Miles: (5spd):

We had VWoA replace the engine at 18K miles due to piston slap, but the
vehicle has been a delight to own an drive otherwise.  Even the engine
replacement was not after getting stuck on the road or anything.  I heard
of the problem on this list, checked the symptoms, convinced the VW
dealer to diagnose our vehicle and replace the engine.  The only other problem
was the low quality continental tires it came with.  We recently had some
real soft-rubber type tires with a real 'chunky' thread pattern installed,
we're hoping they'll do well in Pittsburgh winters (the dry road handling
has actually suffered a little).  I'll report on their performance later
when we get into Pittsburgh Winters.

&gt;&gt;I've had lots of trouble with my 93 EV in the past (thankfully), but it's a
&gt;&gt;5-speed.  Lately I love mine.  It just turned over 42K miles and is still
&gt;&gt;running well.
