Rodney Boleyn wrote to me directly, but I have
taken the liberty of answering to the list as
well.


    &gt;    I probably belong in the idiot files, after having a cold bucket
    &gt;    of water poured down the back of my neck more than once... from
    &gt;    clogged sunroof drains. My sunroof recesses fill with water (at
    &gt;    $120, the new seal didn't help) and I get the shower when I stop
    &gt;    or head down hill.

    Dan,

    I was depressed to see this post, because, as you kow, I'm hunting
    for the elusive sunroof bus.  The one I'm considering buying has
    a leaky roof.  I was wondering if you could tell me *why* yours
    leaks after replacing the seal?  Was the replacement seal of poor
    quality (where'd you buy it--sounds like RMMW's price)?  Does
    your sunroof fit poorly, are the lifters adjusted correctly, etc.?

Rodney,

While I was not the guy who replaced the seal, mine are original,
my roof seals are surely leaky and/or the roof does not properly
seat against the seals.  Arguably, leaky seals should not be a
very big problem -- the drains are backup.

However, I think there is a small design flaw in the sunroof
that goes like this:
        sunroof open at speed inevitably exposes roof storage
           compartment to blow-in of small junk
        low flow of rainwater that inevitably breaches seals will
           transport small junk to drains but will not clear the
           drains
        drains are a series of &quot;gutter-style&quot; conntections betwen
           metal fittings ultimately connected to plastic tubing
        mechanical clearance of a blockage (such as by threading
           in an electrician's snake) are prone to disconnect
           the tubing from the fitting -- which is a vastly worse
           situation
        ipso facto, clogs are inevitable and water flushes are
           the only safe answer

The reason I'm copying the list is to invite dispute.
