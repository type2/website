Subject: re Bus needs a bra

boy what an opening. But I'll restrain myself.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would like to get a bra for my splitty bus.  I would like to hear about
&gt;your experiences with bras' , for your bus that is.  Tell me about your likes
&gt;and dislikes regarding the different companies, styles, etc.  Who has the
&gt;best?  Who should I avoid?
&gt;

I don't know about brands but a couple of rules that apply to all of them
(if you care about your paint job):
- don't leave them on continuously in bright sunlight. You will eventually
get 'tan lines'
- remove them after rain and clean them out. Rain will carry/wash particles
into the thing which will abrade your paint.
- remove them regularly anyway and clean them out. any dust in there will
also abrade the paint.

Basically, I'd put it on for road trips, and leave it off when around town.
Unless you like attending to these things with such anal detail.
