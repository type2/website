Subject: VW of America customer service

The discussion on recalls and VW of Americas failure to respond brings up
lots of bad memories fo me too.  And just in case anyone from VW of America
subscribes to this list, &quot;THEY&quot; are the reason I bought a Honda Accord
instead of a Jetta in 1995.  I hated to do it but after the way they failed
to handle problems with my 86 and 91 Vanagons I just didn't want to deal
with them ever again.  Yes, as demented as I still am, I still drive my 91
GL (and my 83 diesel Rabbit) everywhere.  I let my wife drive the Honda.
