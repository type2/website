Bless 'Em All!


Bless 'em all, bless 'em all,
The long and the short and the tall,
Bless old man Nordoff for building this bus,
But I know a guy who is raising a fuss,
Cause he tried to go over a wall,
In his camper that wasn't so small,
The windows blew out and the wheels flopped about,
Cheer up, my lads, bless 'em all.

Bless 'em all, bless 'em all,
The long and the short and the tall,
Bless all policemen who watch me drive by,
Then want to stop me to see if I'm high!
And it's just cause I'm driving a van,
That they just seem to not understand,
All us buses aren't hippies, we're not even yippies,
And we don't all belong to a band!    :)

Bless 'em all, bless 'em all,
The long and the short and the tall,
Bless all those clerks who work at DMV,
Bless them for saving the world just from me!
For, we all know how paperwork cures
Every socially ill that endures
And we can't have let you through, til we're certain it's you,
And the van that you're driving is yours! :)

Bless 'em all, bless 'em all,
The long and the short and the tall,
Bless those mechanics who worked on my car,
I'd like to trust them, but can't throw too far!
Cause you see, they don't seem to know much
'Bout my bus and its engine and such,
They mumble and fumble, and leave me to grumble,
My wallet is all that they touch!

Bless 'em all, bless 'em all,
The long and the short and the tall,
Bless those suppliers who sell through the mail,
I hope they rot when they get down to hell!
Cause they never will ship what you need,
They say it's back-ordered, you see,
But they all take your money, and that ain't so funny,
Well, no one said Learning was free!

Bless 'em all, bless 'em all,
The long and the short and the tall,
Here's to the buses we've owned in the past,
Here's to the ones that we now drive too fast,
And to all of the buses we see,
No matter what year that it be,
Whether Euro, Bus, Split, Vanagon, it's a hit,
So we wave and we smile, naturally.    :)
