Subject: Re: a racial issue??????



Excuse me Lars...but first off it was not a minor parking lot
ding....nor was the twit (I CAN use this word without offending
anyone can't I?) at all apologetic...in fact he was very
arrogant AND indignant about the whole thing.

The car had just been painted less than a week or so before...
there were plenty of EMPTY parking spaces in the lot, and 
the idiot (&lt;--- no racial overtones here) decided to park
right up next to my car...

Was the Scratching of the car a &quot;get even with the RACIALtype
description&quot; as you say?? Hell no...I would do the same
if the proverbial little old lady (oh, crap I've now
committed the sin of attacking the elderly and the 
penis-impaired) pranged my door and told me to FCK off...

If you want to read racial over tones...incidentally in 
1978 Cadillac began to change its marketing strategy
because its marketing types found that the demographics
of the car in the marketplace was perceived to be heavily
black...and yes there were two blacks driving the Cadillac..
I couldn't help that...but I digress...

If you want to read racial overtones in this story...fine
go ahead...no anti-racial intent was implied...

perhaps I should have written:

Two parking-ability-impaired non-gender or non-race specific
persons parked their large, gas-guzzling automobile next
to my small, recently painted automobile....

The door-pranging non-gender, non-race specific passenger said
&quot;ah, fellow human being, do not fret (oops does that imply
I'm picking on Southern-US types) because your automobile
is only a lowly small automobile compared to my friend's
large, luxurious automobile...and I do not regret
my actions in my negligent damaging of your car....&quot;


Bottom line...no racial overtones were intended, I reported
the event the way it happened...if you want to read into
it anything else...so be it.

Politically Incorectly Yours,

Ric
