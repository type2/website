&gt;Which quantity do I go by?
&gt;3.2 quarts or 4.2 quarts or should I just fill it (levelled) til it won't
&gt;hold anymore (as on The Bozobus)?

&gt;

Fill to the proper level with the trans level.  That so called lower fill
level to ease shifting is bogus but that level is suffecient for proper
operation.
