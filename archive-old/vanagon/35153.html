&gt; To put the belt on for the A/C you would need to remove the fan housing,

&gt; case).  I haven't figured out how to remove the fan, and housing without
&gt; dropping the engine, but it has been said that it can be done.

I don't believe you have to remove the housing to install the belt, just
the fan.  And, it is not only possible to remove the fan housing
with the engine in place, but downright easy.  Well okay, maybe not easy
but certainly do-able.  First, remove the oil filler pipe, rear half of
the engine seal, and three rear pieces of engine tin.  Remove the cover
over the fan hub and undo the three 13mm bolts holding the hub to the
crank.  Don't lose them, cause they are a special length (45mm I think)
and not easy to find.  now pull the fan off.  You shouldn't need a
puller - just wiggle and tap on it till it comes off.  Now look inside
the cavity where the fan was and you should see the pulley and four 13mm
nuts that hold the fan housing to the case.  There is an additional
support on the passenger side that bolts to the heat exchanger (on my 73
at least) but removal of that is straightforward.  If you were
installing the A/C belt you could probably just slip it on now.  If you
are removing the fan housing, unbolt the two small metal caps on the end
of the heat exchangers where they meet the fan housing.  Take out the
upper and lower alternator bolts and let the alternator hang there.
Undo the four nuts holding the fan housing to the case (be careful about
the washers under the nuts!).  Remove the thermostat cable.  Unless I
forgot something, you should now be able to tilt the top of the housing
backwards and lift it off of the engine.  Oh yeah, the alternator
cooling duct will need to ge unfastened.  You can either remove it at
the alternator (phillips head hose clamp) or from inside the fan housing
(metal clip).  I *always* remove the fan housing before dropping or
installing type IV engines (makes it *so* much easier!) so I have done
this procedure a few times.  One last thing, I can't remember if I have
ever removed the fan housing without having first dropped the exhaust.
While I am pretty sure you don't have to drop the exhaust to do it,
there is a chance you might have to loosen the exhaust manifold bolts at
the heads and drop the exhaust down an inch or so to get the fan housing
off, but you should just be able to tilt the housing  and lift it out.
