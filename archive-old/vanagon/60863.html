Subject: Key for water lock?

Hi,

When I bought my 87 westie last month the owner gave me the wrong key
for the lock to fill the water tank.  My friend has an 85 westie and her
key fit in the lock, but would not turn it.  Does each van have a unique
lock?  Or perhaps each year?  Anyone have any suggestions?  The PO is in
NM and im in CA, so id rather not bother them.

thanks,

jeff
