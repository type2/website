&gt; I agree with Derek.  Running rich is much better than running lean.  The
&gt; reason is that a lean mixture will cause detonation (pinging) which will
&gt; destroy an aluminum motor in short order.

  I agree with all that has been said so far. BUT, folks with catalytic
  converter cannot afford to get sloppy with the mixture at all, IMHO.
  Rich mixtures will cause the catalyst to overheat and load up - It's
  an expensive part!
