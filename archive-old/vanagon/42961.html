&gt;Folks,
&gt;There is a large gas leak in my 79 bus.
&gt;The problem started out as a bad gas smell which would come and then leave.
&gt;It left for 2 days, then returned as a big gas leak.
&gt;Gas is leaking from the passenger side, right on to the cv-stub axle.
&gt;I just pulled the firewall to get a good look at the gas tank, but nothing
&gt;looked obviously wrong.
&gt;The rubber filler hose going directly in the tank is worn, and I will replace
&gt;it, but it is not wet.  Other parts under the vehicle are wet, though.
&gt;
&gt;This leads me to believe there is a problem on the underside of the tank.
&gt;BTW, all the fuel line under the vehicle was replaced recently.
&gt;
The fuel line attaches to the tank on the bottom passenger side, about over
the starter.  Had one leak on a '78 once.  There are two connections there,
out and back in from the FI.  You can just BARELY get the tank out by
removing everything from the top of the engine, including the dist. cap, and
disconnecting the rear motor mounts and lowering the engine an inch or so on
a jack.  This one was converted to a carb, so there wasn't THAT much to
remove.  A radiator shop brazed a brass fitting over one hole and a penny
over the other (unused, now) hole.  The brass fitting was essentially a nut.
This allowed the tank to be installed easier, as there was less hanging down.
Once it was in place, a barb screwed into the brass fitting and the fuel line
attached to that.
