&gt; Your Vanagon is probably quieter than my EV.  Plan on insulating behind

Slightly off the subject:  Just got onto the list.  Somebody a while back
was asking for an inventory of us EV owners out here.  Well, ink me IN!

-Tim Parker.
1993 EV GL 5-speed (I don't BELIEVE in automatics)
(sold my 1967 11-window, bone-stock original Microbus with only 375K miles
on it to justify that purchase.  Boy that was HARD, but I got tired of
leap-frogging the trucks on the way to and from work 70miles a day)
1960 Singlecab.  A thrasher, but functional as hell (especially when it is
running).
1929 Ford Model A Fordor sedan (BONE-stock, 3/4 restored).
