Subject: Re: Paint/Int. Code Confusion

&gt;&gt;ie i ASSUME that 523907 on my 65' westy means that my bus originally was a
&gt;&gt;(52) pearl white westy w/ (39) mesh grey (is this the same as &quot;salt n'
&gt;&gt;peppa&quot; fabric??) interior and a (07) ??? . Any thoughts on why Pearl White
&gt;&gt;is assigned as &quot;13&quot; on a Kombi and &quot;52&quot; on a westy. am i making ANY sense??
&gt;
&gt;There seems to be some confusion regarding the paint/interior codes
&gt;on the VIN plate, so let me clear up what I can.
&gt;
&gt;Ex.     121872
&gt;        ^ ^ ^
&gt;        | | |_____Interior Code             72=Aero Papyrus White
&gt;        | |_______Above Beltline Paint Code 18=Cumulus White
&gt;        |_________Below Beltline Paint Code 12=Sea Blue


MUCH clearer, but i wonder why VW couldn't just use the same L numbers they
had for paint (i.e. L87 for Pearl White) on the VIN tag, as opposed to
creating another set of numbers (i.e 13 on kombi's and 52/39 on westy's),
which leads to more confusion.
&gt;
&gt;My question comes into play when the Westfalia enters the picture.
&gt;Westfalias were made from Kombis (model 231).  Both mine and
&gt;Michael Heron's Westys which are Pearl White/Pearl White/Mesh Grey
&gt;have the code 523907 instead of the code 131383 (which my two
&gt;Kombis DO have).  Another listmember Josh has a Velvet Green 67
&gt;Westy has the paint code 523642.  A Velvet Green Kombi would have
&gt;the code 383883 (as I think Michael Heron's Panel Van does).

yes you're right my velvet green panel does have those paint code numbers
&gt;
&gt;I am wondering why the discrepency in the paint codes.  I am
&gt;pretty sure the Kombis were shipped to Westfalia painted, unlike
&gt;some commercial vehicles that could be shipped in primer, to be
&gt;painted later.

as far as i know the kombi's were shipped to westy already painted, and
then had the camper interior put in them (this would make sense to me), but
perhaps this isn't the case
&gt;
&gt;&gt;btw if i had salt and pepper seats, would the door panels be made out of
&gt;&gt;that gray hardboard material or covered in salt and pepper fabric? most
&gt;&gt;westy's i have seen have they gray hardboard panels but there is a pic of a
&gt;&gt;westy in a book by walter zeichner that shows a westy w/ salt and pepper
&gt;&gt;door panels???
&gt;
&gt;Mesh Grey is more commonly known as Salt &amp; Pepper.  Kombis (which
&gt;were the base for the Westfalia) had hardboard interior panels.  The
&gt;Standard and Deluxe models were the only ones which had the vinyl
&gt;with cloth insert interior panels.

got it.

one final thought, as far as i know my van was pearl white on top and
bottom, so why are the paint codes different on VIN?

&gt;Ex.     523907
&gt;        ^ ^ ^
&gt;        | | |_____Interior Code             Mesh Gray
&gt;        | |_______Above Beltline Paint Code Pearl white
&gt;        |_________Below Beltline Paint Code Pearl White

so my question is if the paint is/was the same above and below the beltline
(in my case pearl white), why are there two different paint codes assigned
(i.e. 52 for below beltline and 39 for above beltline)??

whereas in my panel van, the VIN number reads

&gt;Ex.     383883
&gt;        ^ ^ ^
&gt;        | | |_____Interior Code             Mesh Gray
&gt;        | |_______Above Beltline Paint Code Velvet Green
&gt;        |_________Below Beltline Paint Code Velvet Green

which makes more sense because the panel is velvet green above and below
the beltline.

Why is it that bith van's (westy and panel) both would have come w/ the
same mesh grey seats, yet in the westy mesh grey is assigned the number of
07 and the panel is 83?

Boy it seems like VW threw the VIN consistency book out the window when the
made westy's. Sending a man to the moon is less of a technical feat that
figuring out obscure M codes and Westy VIN's!
