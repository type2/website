Subject: famous singer on list!


This may be your one big chance to here it live - Bill Abbott of
vanagon.lenti fame will be singing the Led Zeppelin favorite &quot;Stairway
to Heaven&quot; at my house this coming Sunday, May 21.  My 15-odd (emphasis
on odd) piano students will be performing in a recital here then, and
Bill has kindly agreed to solo towards the end of the recital (3-5 pm)
with one of them.  I'm thinking about turning this into a vanagon
bash after the recital if enough people are interested; may fire up
the spa - bring swim suits, etc.  

If you're interested in attending and need directions, just drop
me an e-mail, and they'll be in your virtual mbox either tonite or
tomorrow.  The morning promises a potential brunch/breakfast gathering
at JD's in Castro Valley, so it's really a &quot;vanagon&quot; day on Sunday....
