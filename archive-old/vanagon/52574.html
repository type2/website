Subject: '73 oil in exhaust?

  I think I found out where the other half of the oil I'm using is
going. I know the thing needs seals but it was using more than it was
leaking. I put my hand over the exhaust pipe and discovered that oil is
spurting out with the exhaust! i always wondered how it ended up
covering the entire rear of the bus. A real tough job getting off the
back glass.
  So whats this? Excessive blowby? Valves? Oil sneaking in somewhere?
The bus runs fine, it doesn't smoke ( only when I'm heavy on the peddle
in low gear ) or foul plugs.What does the collective expertise say?
