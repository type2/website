Subject: '56 Bus Electrical Problem

Well,

	This evening, after a hard day of rescuing lusers from the
misery of their own existence, I set to work on the '56.  All the wires
and cables were in good shape (they're all a lttle over a year old)

	The only thing I found amis was one of the two bolts holding the tranny
mount on was real loose, like almost gone, and his brother was wiggly.  I 
tightened up a couple more various bolts, and it seems fine now.

	Ya see, I don't have a ground strap - I have a solid tranny mount.  I
think that was the problem, we'll see.

	Thanks for the help!

Thom
