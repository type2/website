Subject: NEED INFO ON 91 VANAGON GL

Thinking about biying a '91 Vanagon GL sight unseen from a 
private owner in Alabama (thanks to the e-mail from Joel Walker 
at U of A).

Being very novice about all of this what should I be asking the 
owner

VW Vanagan GL &lt;sic&gt;
    '91 auto, AC, CD, 1 owner, 43,000 mi, new tires, books &amp; 
records,
    asking $10,900.
    
    Any info and assistance from GL owners would be 
APRECIATED!!
