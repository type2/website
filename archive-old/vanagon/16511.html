Subject: Ottawa Pizza Night?


Hi,

  I've just been emailing with Frank Condelli and we were toying with
the idea of a Pizza Night for Ottawanians that are on these lists.
There appear to be a few of us!

Location:	To Be Determined (recommendations solicited)

Date:		Thurs. April 4th or Sat. April 6th (I prefer the Thurs)
                Note:  we are pretty flexible on the dates so if these prove 
		impossible for someone we can accomodate!

Time:		Guess that depends on children, date, etc
		
Who:		Hey, if you've got a VW tie-in, welcome! (wannnabe's included)
		SOs, husbands, wives, children, ...
                (We aren't going to be a big crowd so the more the merrier:-) 
		


At a minimum Frank and I will meet and eat pizza:-)

I'm digested so please drop me a line at this address.

c ya!

...Markus
