Subject: syncro uneven tire wear?

Hey folks
	I was looking at a possible syncro purchase and it had one tire that was worn
a lot more that the rest.  The passenger front tire had a lot less tread
overall and even more wear on the outside edge.   The rest of the tires have
very little wear on them (less that 10,000 mi).  The tires don't seem to be the
right size either, they are 205/something r14.  I checked on the door frame and
they were not listed there.   Any ideas how serious this is?  Thanks for your
time, all your help has been great.
