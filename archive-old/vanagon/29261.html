Subject: Starting a flooded engine.  

I took my '84 Westy to Sears (dumb move) for an alignment.  They screwed 
up the alignment and the tech flooded the engine so badly that it would 
not start.  In the six months that I have owned this van I have never had 
any problems starting it.  I finally got it started after leaving it for 
six hours.  Does anybody know of an easy way to start a flooded engine?
