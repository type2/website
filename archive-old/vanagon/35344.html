Subject: RE: cheap Syncro Vanagon Tires?

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I switched from the POs Michelin MXL 205s to 185R14C 8PR, 100/102P 
&gt;all-season
&gt;&gt;blackwall 8 ply tubeless steel belted radials.  Whew!  They're 40,00 mi.
&gt;&gt;warranty, made by Kelly but called Jupiters YP-821.  I hope you'll agree 
&gt;that
&gt;&gt;I got a bargain _at_ $43 ea. plus mounting, balancing, tax and Merchant's 
&gt;&quot;Tire
&gt;&gt;Protect Policy&quot;- repair/rotate/balance for life of tire for $64.87 total.
&gt;
&gt; ... Let me know how they handle...

I opted for some Toyo truck tires (185-75 R16) which are 8 ply rated
on my '86 Vanagon.  They're a bit skinny where the rubber meets the
road, but they seem to handle very well.  They're pumped up to 45psi
now, but I may drain a few lbs out of them to take some of the bumps
out of the road.  My only concern is traction in the dirt.  I plan to drive
it in Baja this Spring and I'd feel better with a wider footprint.

It had Kleber 185-75's on it previously and they seemed mushy in
comparison.  It now seems to be easier to turn, more firm around
corners, and feels more solid.

I believe I paid about $75 per tire at Winston for them, and they're
supposed to go about 40k miles.  Sounds like some shopping around
may find a better deal.
