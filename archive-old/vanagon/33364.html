Subject: Fram problems and more.

I've consistently encountered a problem with the last 3 oil changes 
i've done using Fram filters.  i'm normally an 'Autobahn' sort of guy 
but i'm trying to use up some filters in the garage and always seem 
to be lacking an Autobahn filter when the weather breaks for an oil 
change.

the problem is leaking at the filter gasket to oil cooler interface 
in cold weather (cold being defined regionally-- like less than -
10F).  on initial cold start-up, a quantity of oil is puked out at 
this juncture.  i've resorted to tightening the filter with a wrench 
but still can't keep it completely contained.  i've *never* had this 
problem with a VW filter.  

BTW, the leak is NOT from the oil cooler to block interface!  i've 
replace that O-ring to solve THAT oil leak.

so.... between the flickering oil light with Frams on my '85 and the 
puking oil on the '87 i am convinced there is a 'problem' with them 
for MY engine, in MY climate.  you need to be the judge for your own 
conditions.  they work well in many other people's vans.

here's the 'more' part--
when it was so cold here (-48F) i backed my Toyota out of the garage 
(unheated and door open), shut the drivers door and the passenger 
side rear window shattered into a bazillion pieces.  there's just no 
getting around it... things break in the cold, even if they are made 
in Japan.   :)
