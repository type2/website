I've been happy with the transmission I got from them a few years ago
for the Gerbil (also a '66).  It's not quite stock, in that it has a
taller fourth gear for highway driving and came with a later-model
nosecone (i.e., I can put in backup lights if I want to).

Currently, it does have the annoying tendency to pop out of fourth.  I
haven't yet convinced myself it's the transmission versus adjusting
the bracket up front.  I believe it started happening after I let a
shop dink with the vehicle as a whole, so anything could have
happened.  I've since gone back to doing as much myself as possible,
as I've had really bad luck with the shops around here (and I needed a
hobby).

:  I can't afford the downtime while I do it myself.

Note that swapping the tranny will take you a while, also.  It took me
a couple of days of on-task time (sandwiched in as an hour here, a
couple of hours there).  The problem isn't so much the transmission
itself, as it is that you find out that other things are broken along
the way.  Make sure you've got a helper lined up, too....
