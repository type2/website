&gt;  it's time I moved up &lt;?&gt; to F.I. and got a '75 for myself. BTW, what makes
&gt;  you think that the engine would run cooler with F.I.? I agree with all the

I was hoping you wouldn't call me on that one, Dave. I read it somewhere,
in one of those recommended books, either the Idiot guide or Berg's
catalog, I think. The rationale, I believe, is that a well conceived FI
system will provide the optimal richness over the *entire* RPM range and
over a range of other parameters, such as temperature. Hence the engine
should neither run too rich, nor too lean. Carburation, however, just
isn't that flexible, which --among others-- can be a reason for hot
engines. Please correct me if this BS. &lt;Show Me, I'm from Missouri :) &gt;
