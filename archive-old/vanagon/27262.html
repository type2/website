&gt;&gt; story.  Imagine that, towing a Syncro Westy behind your motorhome.  Maybe
&gt;&gt; they towed a compact car behind the Westy.  Maybe they towed a motorcycle
&gt;&gt; behind the compact.  Oh well, I'm drivelling now.........
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Actually, I'd rather not imagine this, if they indeed TOWED a Syncro
&gt;westy behind a motorhome, I hardly imagine they towed it on a trailer
&gt;with all four wheels off the ground, which could add up to a terrifying
&gt;nightmare of VWoA parts prices.  Might explain why it was being sold
&gt;with 15,000 miles.

We discussed towing Syncros a few weeks ago and the bottom line is that the
Bentley book states that a manual transimssion Vanagon (both 2WD &amp; Syncro)
may be towed with 4 wheels on the ground for an unlimited distance at
unlimited speed.
