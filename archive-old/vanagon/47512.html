Subject: next CCC's location


OK, volks - we've done a reconnaissance mission on your behalf to try
and locate camping sites.  A few days ago, we did a 350 or so mile
trip around the south bay and Monterey areas, looking for hidden secrets
on National Forest property.  We in fact found a few potential places
which we liked a lot, but due to mosquito problems, these would probably
be better in months other than July/August (although a few are on dirt
roads, and therefore not accessible during wet season unless you have
4wd).  

Anyway, I nominate that we go with the area Steve Johnson suggested
to the list.  Steve?  - can you help refresh my memory as I neglected
to save this, but my recollection is the area is east of Sacramento,
heading up toward Tahoe?

This is for the next upcoming camping trip, which is for not this weekend,
but the next, so it will be the first weekend in August.

This weekend, remember, is the party here at my place for our list
leader (well, ok, water-cooled list leader now) Gerry Skerbitz and his
family.  Party is this Sat. eve. - e-mail me if you need directions.
