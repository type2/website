I was addressing _safety_.

Does it make sense to cool with propane when underway? Actually it does 
have some advantages:

1. Most 3 way friges cool much better on propane than 12 volts.

2. When stopping for lunch, etc. you don't have to remember to do 
anything or switch anything. It keeps cooling.

3. The almost 20 amp draw of the fridge on the alternator does draw some 
engine power and effect milage somewhat.

4. The propane usage is relatively small.
