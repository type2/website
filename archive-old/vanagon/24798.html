Wish it was that easy.  The European rodents are terrified of Ferrets (or 
actually their genetically darned similar European Polecats) but these 
American rodents don't know what a ferret is.  The rats would run since 
their Norwegan imports (okay so they're Norway rats but probably not from 
Norway).  We've had mice sneak into our basement where the 'hordes' of 
ferrets live.  One saw me and ran to hide....  thats right under the 
ferrets!  The stupid ferrets just watched - they'd rather play with the 
mice than eat them.

We've just imported some English ferrets - they would know what to do 
with mice since they are still working rabbit hunters over there.  I know 
some German ferrets that are too fat and lazy to chase mice too.  But the 
German ferrets feel right at home in our Volkswagens!  No mice in the EV, 
thank you.

One of these good hunting English ferrets would definitely run the mice 
out of the ventilation system.  Think that one of the smaller girls MIGHT
fit...
