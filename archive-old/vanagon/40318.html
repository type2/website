Subject: Oil Press. Sender location(T4)

To the list,

I have a 1.7 liter engine that I am trying to mount an oil pressure 
sender on.  The threads on the sender are the same as the threads on 
the stock oil pressure switch.  The problem is that the sender is so 
darn BIG that the hole in the tinware is too small.  Has anyone found 
a succesfull way to mount one of these electric sending units on a 
type IV engine, while the engine is in the bus?  If so please help 
me.

Thanks
