Subject: Re: Horizontal propane tank

    Definetly exaust the junk yards first!  You shouldn.t pay over $75 
for a used one and MAKE SURE IT ISNT OVER 8 YRS OLD if it is you will 
have to get it &quot;re-cerified&quot; and it may not passs.  New ones ( I just 
bought one) can come from most any local propane dealer.  The tank I 
bought was made by Manchester Tank in Tenn.  You wnat 8&quot;diameter and 
about 5.9 gal. This will fit nicely.

&gt;Does anyone know where I can find a (small) propane tank like the ones 

&gt;attached to the breadloaf campers or the vanagon campers? I wonder if 
a 
&gt;junkyard search would be hopeless....
