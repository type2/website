Subject: Re: Where can I get one?

&gt;I have recently rebuilt my 34pict3 and need a vacuum advanced distributor,
&gt;as it has been suggested that a 009 doesn't really work well with the
&gt;34pict3 in the bus... where can you pick one up these days, and what type
&gt;am I looking for?

        Ok, I'll bite. Why doesn't the 34p3 work with the 009? This is what
I run, I'd be interested in finding out what I should be running.

Peace,
