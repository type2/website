Subject: Re: Ice/snow/wind tales


&gt;I recall following my thesis advisor (I think he had a '76 bus at the time)
&gt;thru Canada on a group trip to Nova Scotia, we were in a boring level 
&gt;section of highway in New Brunswick, where there would be ~1/2 mile of 
&gt;mature forested land followed by ~1/2 mile of cleared land, every time we
&gt;came out of the protection of the trees his bus blew over into the oncoming
&gt;lane of traffic - seeing this, I was able to slow down and merely swerve a 
&gt;lot, but it was quite the phenomenon to watch.

What an incredible coincedence, I drove this stretch of land this week-end
on the way home from Moncton, NB and there was very high wind indeed.
Coming over a strech called Folly Mtn, The wind popped my camper top with a
huge noise and wrenching sideways feeling. Not good, thought I.
The rubber Holders that fasten the top down had failed. They were 25 years old. 
Now the question is with what do I replace them? I used a hose clamp
sideways to hold it down and get it home.
Everyone should carry hose clamps.
I also noticed that the sliding bracket on the front drivers side had sheered.
