Subject: My dream bus...or bus dream...

I'm dreaming about old buses now, isn't that odd?  

Last night I dreamed I was pursuing a '69 red van in MINT condition -- it 
kept slipping away down alleys, the wrong way, and I couldn't get near 
it.

Then the owner painted the whole thing, windshield, windows and all, 
battleship grey to throw me off.

I think I have bus lust.  Is there something to do about it???

Nancy
