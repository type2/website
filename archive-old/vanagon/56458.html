 I put my triple gauges in an on dash cluster over the ash tray (after
removing it, the wires go down the hole and the cluster has been
modified to 'hang on to' the hole) on my 1983 Diesel.  I added oil
pressure, cylinder head temp. and voltage.  I am still trying to find a
good way to mount the cylinder head temp. sender.
