&gt;I'm seeing more urst and the vinluy is peeling.

Pete, is that like angst and a bad sunburn?... :-)

Seriously though, I'm interested in what you said
about modifying the engine cover to access the oil
filter.  I know my back would certainly like hear 
about it!

As an aside, it's been raining around these parts
quite a bit lately, and I noticed that a good por-
tion of the front doors were filled w/ rain water,
so make sure those two drain holes/door are clear
of melted rust protectant, or you'll be experiencing
more &quot;urst&quot; than you care for.
