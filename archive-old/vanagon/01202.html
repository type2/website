&gt;Would someone tell a newbie to vw busses what the differances are
&gt;with the Westfalia, Vanagon, Camper, Bus, and all the diff. models ?

ohhhhhhh boy-oh-boy-oh-boy!!! a New Thread!! :)

ok, this is the way i understand things about buses:

Volkswagen has always called it a Transporter. more correctly, a Type 2
(the beetle is a Type 1).

now, the first generation (1949-1967) buses were called T1 (Transporter 1?)
the second generation (1968-1979), T2; the third generation (1980-1991), T3;
and the current/fourth generation (1992-????) is called T4.

well, all that doesn't translate too well into sales brochures. so they came
up with some other names.

Originally, the Transporter was a truck. that's it. then VW decided to put
some seats and windows into it ... and they called it a Station Wagon.
actually, VW decided to call it Bulli ... that was their 'name' for it, to
make reference to its pulling power and dependibility. a Bulli is supposed to
be an ox or wagon-pulling-horse. something like that.
someone else decided it looked like a Microbus ... and the name stuck.
when the body style changed in 1968, the term Microbus got lost in the shuffle
somehow ... VW still referred to the bus as a Station Wagon, but most folks
just called it a Bus.

so along in 1980, VW brings out the third generation body style, still
officially known as a Transporter, but sells it with seats as a Vanagon.
but it turns out that Vanagon is a U.S.-only name! it was sold in Canada and
the rest of the world as a Caravelle (they couldn't call it that in the u.s.
cause dodge already had that name).

likewise, when the 4th generation came out, still officially known as a
Transporter, it was sold in the u.s. as a Eurovan, but in the rest of the
world as a Caravelle.

now, the Vanagon/Caravelle and the Eurovan/Caravelle are only the ones with
seats and windows ... all the others (no windows, no interior) are just
trucks and are still called Transporters, no matter which generation they are.

ok. so what about the Campers?  well, somewhere back in the 50's, a little
company named Westfalia-Werke (Franz Knoebel &amp; Sons) who used to make custom
horse-drawn carriages, got hold of some VW transporters and converted them
into little houses-on-wheels. the name Camper got stuck on it by VW (i think)
and has continued to this day. Westfalia is the name of the company who
modified the interior and put the pop-up top on. so, as far as the VW camper
that was sold at most u.s. dealers, a Camper and a Westfalia are the same
thing.

well ... there are exceptions to that in other parts of the world. Westfalia
was NOT the only company doing this. Dehler is one german company that comes
to mind; Devon is/was a company in Britain; Dormobile also made conversions
and their pop-tops were hinged on the side (not the front or back). there
were/are also several other companies in the u.s that made conversions.
Country Home Campers still makes conversions of Vanagons. Adventurewagen was
another company. most of the u.s. companies have long since gone out of
business or changed over to converting u.s. dodge/ford/chevy vans.

and for 1995, it seems that there will be yet another change in the terminology
for the campers: the u.s. company, Winnebago, will be making two versions of
the Eurovan for sale: one, sold by Winnebago dealers and called the Rialta,
and the other, sold by VW dealers, and called the ??? Camper?

there are many, many other versions of the basic Transporter made by VW for
sale around the world:
Pritschewagen - a single cab pick-up truck. looks just like a microbus/bus/
                vanagon/eurovan in the front, but has been cut off behind
                the drivers seat and made into a flat-bed pickup truck (with
                sides that fold down). really neat. not sold in the u.s.
                after about 1968-1970. there is also a version with a really
                wide bed that sticks out about a foot or so on each side.
Doppelkabine  - also called Crew Cab. a double-cabin pickup truck. only real
                difference is that the body was cut after the middle seats
                and the pickup bed is only about six feet long (instead of
                nine feet). super neat. you can carry six people AND a load
                of manure! :)
Hoch-Dach ?   - not sure of the name on this one, but it's very easy to
                recognize: the roof is about three feet taller than normal!
                you can transport baby giraffes in this thing.
and other specialty models made for police, fire departments, army, etc.

did i leave anything out? more than you ever wanted to know about buses,
right? :)
