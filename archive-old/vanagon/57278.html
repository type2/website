&lt;&lt; This past weekend we had a nice crappy storm with snow, sleet,
 freezing rain the works.  Anyway, I'm tired of driving around without a
 rear wiper on the camper. It makes it very difficult to see bout back. 
 If anyone has one in decent shape they would like to sell, please let me
 know. &gt;&gt;

I've retrofitted a wiper assembly into a hatch that didn't originally have
one.  I suppose switching the hatches might be easier, but if you could just
buy the wiper assy, installing it into the &quot;wiperless&quot; hatch isn't too bad a
job.  It helps if you have a hatch with a wiper in it to use as a guide
though.  You'll need to install a second rubber tube on the right side of the
hatch to contain the washer tube and a couple wires.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
