Subject: anti-theft for diesel vanagons?


&gt;
&gt;   Hello,
&gt;   Has anyone considered an anti-theft device for the diesel vanagons?
&gt;   I mean, not an alarm, etc?  What options are there for these things?
&gt;   I have considered putting a relay over the glow plug line which would
&gt;   only allow the glow plugs to heat if the switch is thrown, but there
&gt;   are probably other alternatives which might be better.
&gt;   Does anyone have an idea?
&gt;   Stuart

Maybe just a big sign that says it's powered by
a 1600cc 47 (galloping) Horse(s) output engine? :-)
