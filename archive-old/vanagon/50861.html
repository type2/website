I've worn out the latest set of Michelin XZX 185R14 Reinforced tires on
my
85 Vanagon GL. The local distributor seems to think these are no longer
available. Anyone know if that's true? &gt;&gt;

These tire are still available and very common in Canada.

&lt;&lt;My Bentley is the old 80-85 edition and shows the rim size for the
185R14 as
5-1/2 J 14. Is this same rim used on the post 86 Vanagons with the 205
series tires?&gt;&gt;

I'd stick with 195 or under on 5 1/2 J 14 wheels. For 205 series its
better to go to the 6 J 14 wheel (also available). The problem is the
amount of side wall buldge with the 205 on 5 1/2 increases the risk of
side wall damage from rocks, curbs, DKW's, 2CV's.
