Rusty,
	Be good.  Let people write how they may.  In context, you'd be 
surprised how much Spanish or Swahili you'd be able to understand, 
Sahib.  We are negotiating between machine and people.  That is this 
list.  Let's not scare our non-english speakers off of the list.  Many of 
them have probably learned how to write english better than us.  Gary Gibson
