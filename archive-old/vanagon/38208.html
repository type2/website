Subject: Shocking Blue

Just got our '67 Bus back from the restorers today...basically a paint job as
final (dream on) phase ...
Purists stop reading now. It was originally sea blue/cumulus white...about six
years ago we did a holding job and it went deep blue and cream (no codes!)
..and this time we chose weiss and cornat blue (later discovered to be T3
brick colours).
Picked it up today...boy am I glad Cee got me to stick with the cumulus white
and drop the weiss...and the blue? Well it's a shock! It looks beautiful...but
it sure don't look like OUR bus! If you have ever seen the blue version of the
NEATO club sticker..well that's just about what our bus now looks!
I think I'll get used to it..from the front I love it...from the side
...hmmm...it's still a shock!
Anyway...a smoke and coffee in the back later I realise it IS our bus after
all....the inside is everything we remember and love...then I step outside and
look back...God whose loud bus is that? Aaagh it's mine!
Well it's distinctive I suppose....I think I'm just a little bit too old...my
kids think it's &quot;well cool&quot;......
