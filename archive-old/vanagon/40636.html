The $10 filter is marked as a VW/Audi part, but there is no manufacturer 
stamped on the part. Doesn't look like it's a Mann filter. Here's how it's 
labled:

VW Audi   025 129 620A    XND USA

One problem with air filters is I never know exactly when to change them. 
If I use the cheap ones, then I can change them every year whether they 
need it or not. My van came with one of the syncro filters that still looks 
serviceable. I think I'll keep at as a backup and install it when it's 
needed.
