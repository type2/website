Subject: RE: Hey, a Minivan Westy!


&gt;Standing outside the other day for one of those &quot;smoke breaks&quot; (yeah, I
&gt;know, I know) I saw what I thought was a D*dge Minivan with a poptop roof.
&gt;I thought, &quot;Hey man, I didn't know that Chry*tler Corp made a camper! Wow.&quot;
&gt;The minivan made the turn and then I saw the familiar logo. Er, oops,
&gt;nevermind. I guess the shape of the '96s have changed a bit. Sorry for the
&gt;flamebait.


A Sharan, maybe?
