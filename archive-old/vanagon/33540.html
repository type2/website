Subject: Semaphore repros: any leads?

&lt;snip my original sob-story&gt;
&gt;I came home once to find some Neanderf--- had taken the taillight lenses
&gt;off my 60 Singlecab while I was at work (daytime on a busy street!!).  This
&gt;after I had just bought them at a SOTO meet.  This was before any of the
&gt;repros were available, too!
&gt;When I put the new ones on, I soldered the phillips heads on the screws
&gt;flush, so you'd have to melt them clean to get the lenses off without
&gt;breaking them.  You might try this on your *next* set of  semaphores
&gt;(bummer, lenses were about 40 bucks, a lot less painful).  I wouldn't try
&gt;that on the gas cap, though. 8')

I enquired at a local shop today about semaphores: &quot;new old stock&quot; is
$295.00, EACH (!!!); &quot;used&quot; is $195 Each.  Cripes!  Does anyone know of any
reproductions being made?  I mean, how tough can it be -- it's basically
just a shaped piece of transparent plastic (with wiring for a light inside),
a little solenoid, and a curved strip of metal on the outside (which could
be made in colored plastic just as well.)  Any leads?

Of course, I told the counter person of my recent theft, described the
semaphores (bright orange metal), and he promised to keep an eye out if any
kids come in trying to sell them (at those prices, no wonder they get stolen.)
