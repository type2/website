-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

This is a long message with information garnered as a result of posts=
 on
this and other lists, including rec.travel.latin-america, and the Sou=
th
American Explorers Club list.  My wife and I have been planning a tri=
p to
the Tip of Argentina destination such as proposed by Martha.  All was
proceeding well until the announcement that the Crucero Express, the =
ferry
between Panama and Colombia had ceased operation in about September.

With the demise of the ferry, Darien Gap-crossing expenses soar.

FYI, we're ready to go as soon as we can figure out how to traverse t=
he
Darien Gap. One solution would be to negotiate a group rate for a num=
ber of
Vanagons with a recommended carrier out of Panama City, Panama.

I have two additional information-laden and reality-inducing messages=
 which
I have filed. Iif anyone, or the entire list, would like to have them=
, let
me know.

&gt; &gt; Chris,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I enjoyed your note to the Vanagon list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We've been planning a similar trip to South America my wife, Aura=
 Nell
and
&gt; &gt; I , with 84 Westy and two old Dachshunds. I have most of the prob=
lems
&gt; &gt; resolved, including parts &quot;reserves&quot; in the States, likely necess=
ary
spare
&gt; &gt; parts to carry, and information on insurances, dog visas, and oth=
er
similar,
&gt; &gt; , estimable subjects.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I am lacking is the information about crossing the Darien Ga=
p and
on
&gt; &gt; the Latin America equivalent to the carnet de passage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We are mature folks in a two-wheeled drive van, so the option of =
an
&gt; &gt; overland route is excluded from our thinking.  The Crucero Expres=
s, the
&gt; &gt; ferry between Panama and Colombia has ceased service.  Another op=
tion
is to
&gt; &gt; ship the vehicle via freighter, specifically recommended was the
Nordana
&gt; &gt; Line.  Tarriff is steep _at_ $60.00 US per cubic metre. A Listee
calculated
&gt; &gt; the vanagon at about 18 cubic metres in volume. The passengers th=
en
have to
&gt; &gt; fly at another $400.00, or so.  Instead of a $600 trans-Darien Ga=
p
&gt; &gt; experience, the investment begins to compare to the US Budget Def=
icit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The carnet de passage is a document issued by the Canadian Automo=
bile
Club
&gt; &gt; which lubricates passage of vehicles in Europe and in Asia. The T=
exas
AAA
&gt; &gt; gave me the application forms, but the carnet is invalid, or not
recognized
&gt; &gt; by authorities in Central and South America.  I am told there is =
a
similar
&gt; &gt; document titled &quot;la libreta&quot; which is the cross the border withou=
t
bonds,
&gt; &gt; bribes, and delays etc., recognized by the authorities in those L=
atin
&gt; &gt; nations.  Are you aware of that document and how to acquire one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Re the &quot;Folder,&quot; somewhere in your e-mail software I'm told, ther=
e is a
&gt; &gt; capability to create a file folder for mail from a specific addre=
ss.=20
When
&gt; &gt; you figure that out, let me know. I'm a technoboobie.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We reside in Texas, maintain a home in Palm Springs, and we would=
 like
to
&gt; &gt; consider a caravan with nice folks.  We're post-50s folks and wid=
ely
&gt; &gt; travelled.  We'd prefer a east cost Mexico route to depart  from =
Texas
and
&gt; &gt; a Pacific route to return to California.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Tom Hanlon
&gt; &gt; Palm Springs, CA.
&gt; Well, I am not sure where to start...I guess I'll pass the info as =
it
&gt; occurs to me.
&gt; A very important issue, many times underestimated, is a decent know=
ledge
&gt; of the spanish language. Without it, your trip will loose about 80%=
 of
&gt; its enjoyment potential, and I am not exaggerating. It is essential=
 to
&gt; speak the language when crossing borders, asking for directions (th=
ere
&gt; is a lot of this), as a tool to prevent or minimize bribe situation=
s,
&gt; (Police, border &quot;authorities&quot;, etc) when communicating with a mecha=
nic,
&gt; and in the event of an emergency.
&gt; About the Darien Gap: At the time I did it (1992), there were no re=
gular
&gt; scheduled ferries from Colon (Panama) to Venezuela or Colombia. It =
was
&gt; just a matter of waiting in the dockyard, talk to people and get in=
 a
&gt; boat. We had bad luck with this, and after almost a month in Panama
&gt; City, decided to transport the vehicle by plane, to Bogota. This wa=
s not
&gt; only expensive ($ 2,000) but a really bad idea. Our van, the longes=
t
&gt; version of the full size Dodge, fitted inside the cargo plane by a
&gt; matter of inches, only after 10 employees raised and moved it sidew=
ays,
&gt; since it had to be loaded diagonally to be able to fit through the =
cargo
&gt; door!! They let 2 of us travel in the cargo plane, the rest had to =
fly
&gt; by a commercial airline. It felt like being in an Indiana Jones mov=
ie...
&gt; On top of that, the crate that unloaded the vehicle in Bogota damag=
ed
&gt; the fuel tank and some of the rear suspension... Anyway, I've heard=
 that
&gt; ferries are running periodically now, and that the fares are a lot
&gt; cheaper. A very good source for this is the South America Explorers
&gt; Club,(http://www.samexplo_dot_org/index.htm). They have a lot of storie=
s and
&gt; info about people that have done the Darien crossing.
&gt; I also have a small collection of articles about the Darien, people=
 that
&gt; pioneered it by car, horses, etc. as well as about people and
&gt; expeditions that have crossed the Americas from north to south or
&gt; viceversa(again, by foot, horse, bicycle, 4x4, etc).
&gt; I know of a couple of books (one written in german) about people
&gt; traveling the world in their Westfalias. However, I have not been a=
ble
&gt; to locate these at my local library. I am also attaching some leads=
 from
&gt; the internet.
&gt; There is not such thing as crossing borders w/out delays...
&gt; We never got the carnet de passage, nor &quot;la libreta&quot;,although we we=
re
aware of both, didn't really
&gt; need them. The carnet is &quot;required&quot; for the South American countrie=
s
only. I recall some paperwork in Quito, done through the US embassy,
&gt; that permitted us to cross Ecuador and get into Peru. I have all th=
e
&gt; records of the trip. Expenses, maps, gas prices, exchange rates, bo=
rder
&gt; paperwork, slides, etc etc. (I was going to write an article about =
the
&gt; trip, so I gathered all the info I could).
&gt; Anyway, I'm realizing that there is just too much info to cover the
&gt; whole thing in just an e-mail. Hope this is helpful for now. If you=
 have
&gt; other specific questions, I'll be glad to help you.
&gt; I wouldn't recommend taking pets with you. They become one more sou=
rce
&gt; of problems/delays/bribes at border crossings.
&gt; Of course, knowing your vehicle is a must. Roads are not as bad as =
they
&gt; say. We did not have a single flat tire in the whole trip. The issu=
e of
&gt; parts, though should be paid attention. Parts for old american vans=
 are
&gt; available in most Latin American countries and the same goes for pr=
e-72
&gt; VW buses. With a Vanagon, you would have a hard time with this. (No
&gt; vanagons in Latin America, with a few exceptions).
&gt; Keep in touch!

&gt;                             The Darien Gap.
&gt;=20
&gt; The Darien Gap remains the last gap in the Pan-American highway fro=
m
&gt; North to South America. It was ever the major obstacle to one of th=
e
&gt; last epic car journeys to be achieved - the trip from Alaska to Tie=
rra
&gt; del Fuego.
&gt;=20
&gt; Now, Patricia Upton has produced an Adventurer's Guide to Crossing =
the
&gt; Darien Gap (details below). This 40 page guide includes a wealth of
&gt; information for the expeditioner - getting there, shipping, embassi=
es,
&gt; paperwork, customs and legal matters, accommodation, health and
&gt; medicine, contacts, sources of information, politics and
&gt; guerrillas(!), and of course the route.
&gt;=20
&gt; Patricia Upton is well qualified to write about the Darien Gap. Lor=
en
&gt; Upton has traversed the area (with others) in 1976, 1977 and 1979, =
and
&gt; with Patricia and others in 1985 - 1987 and 1995. Between 1985 and
&gt; 1987 they completed the first all land crossing of the gap in a 196=
6
&gt; Jeep CJ5 (earlier crossing included floating vehicles down rivers o=
r
&gt; through the Atrato Swamp). In 1995 the Uptons, with Juan Rivas,
&gt; traversed the gap using a two wheel drive Rokon Trail-Breaker
&gt; motorcycle.
&gt;=20
&gt; The guide includes such sobering notes as
&gt;=20
&gt;      1976 One expedition member mysteriously shot and killed.
&gt;      1977 Jeep lost in accident in Ecuador.
&gt;      1979 Jeep lost to an unsavory encounter with a Columbian Park
&gt;      official.
&gt;=20
&gt; This is plainly not a trip for the novice.
&gt;=20
&gt; La Tortuga
&gt;=20
&gt; When Frank and Helen Schreider were contemplating driving from the
&gt; Arctic Circle in Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in South America in the
&gt; early 1950's there were three main obstacles - southern Mexico,
&gt; southern Costa Rica and eastern Panama (the Darien Gap) which requi=
red
&gt; shipping by rail or sea. Consequently the Schreiders chose to use a=
n
&gt; Amphibious Jeep (Seep) so that they could take to the ocean and sai=
l
&gt; around these problems. It sounds simple but was very hazardous. (ht=
tp:
&gt; //www .sofcom _dot_com.au/ 4WD/ Mil/ Mil.html)
&gt;=20
&gt; Early Darien Gap Expeditions
&gt;=20
&gt; The first vehicular crossing of the Darien Gap was made in 1959 - 1=
960
&gt; using a Jeep and a Land-Rover. Upton records that the exact route f=
rom
&gt; the Panamanian / Columbian border is unknown, possibly being by boa=
t
&gt; down the Atrato River.
&gt;=20
&gt; Around 1962 an expedition sponsored by General Motors failed in an
&gt; attempt to take three Corvairs, surely improbable vehicles, across =
the
&gt; gap.
&gt;=20
&gt; The British Trans-Americas Expedition drove two Range Rovers from
&gt; Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in 1972. This was partly to promote the
&gt; recently released Range Rover. They had numerous mechanical problem=
,
&gt; breaking differentials due to overloading and the use of over-size
&gt; tyres on the Darien Gap section. That section was undertaken as a
&gt; major expedition with British Army support.
