Subject: Friday Haiku

Hold on to your hats, gang.  You're here for a real Friday first,
finally real proof that the Vanagon list is a class act after all.

This is real haiku in its native Japanese language, featuring nothing
less than the indomitable Volkswagen!

Here it is:

Dandan to
Kono Kaki-iro no
Min-sha iku

That should be read in separate syllables/beats as

Da N Da N To
Ko No Ka Ki I Ro No
Mi N Sha I Ku

the classic 5-7-5 of the haiku form.  It means

slowly
this persimmon-colored
volkswagen goes

(Persimmon-colored for Fall imagery, you know; &quot;Min-sha&quot; is literally 
&quot;people-car&quot; and thus a tolerable rendering of &quot;VW&quot;.)
