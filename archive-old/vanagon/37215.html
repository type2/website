rcooled westfalia.  On a Baja trip we clogged our catalytic
converter and did seriuos damage to our engine.  Instead of a rebuild we
spent the extra dough for a brand new VW engine.  Our Mechanic bought it from
GOLDEN GATE VOLKSWAGEN in Daly City, CA.  

This new engine is now burning oil at the rate of at least 1 quart per 1000
miles.  In the last 400 miles it burned 3/4 quart.  Nick Fernandez at Golden
Gate VW maintains that this is &quot;normal&quot;.  I don't agree with Nick.

Does anyone have any official info on oil consumption?  Has anyone had this
experience? Any advice on how to get results from VW?
