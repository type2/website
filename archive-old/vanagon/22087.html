Subject: yard list

Dubsters,

 I recently got a list of yards and parts available from someone on the
list, which I promptly saved to read later, only to find that I don't have
the senders address and I would like to follow-up.

 I'm interested in the location of:

86  Westfalia, for pts                              H &amp; H, WI

 If I'm lucky, there might be a bolt or two left for me to salvage....

 Thanks Much!                                                   R.

PS- anyone have an owners manual for an 87 Synchro or Vanagon that I can copy?
