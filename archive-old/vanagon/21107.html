Subject: Re: Road Trip From Hell

I missed it too! (deleting frenzy during my 62 hour workweek).
Can anyone send it to me?
Hey, can we search for it on a gopher as well?


&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately I seem to have missed the story you
&gt;all are talking about...(probably whilst in a deletion
&gt;frenzy :(  ) - Could any of you e-mail me
&gt;a copy? - Please?
