Subject: VolksWorld Subscription Info...


After my posting regarding the T4 syncro, I received a couple of 
requests for info on VolksWorld and VW Motoring. So here's the
info:

VolksWorld, available from EWA  - 908 665-7814   $60/yr

VW Motoring is aparently available direct from the publisher in the UK...
Warners Group Distribution Ltd.
The Maltings
West Street
Bourne, Linc PE 10 9PH

L 40 (40 British Pounds)



Ok, they are expensive, however, all of the magazine is in color
on glossy paper, the writing, editorial content is at a level
higher than VW T&amp;A...oops Trends or DBHVW, both of which IMHO
are aimed at an audience who spend as much time with their
right hands &quot;polishing their cranks&quot; as they do shifting their
VWs....
