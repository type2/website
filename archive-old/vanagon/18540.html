Subject: Re: david &amp; the silver socket

Just to add to the confusion, my '86 Westy with the
weekender package has this socket under the passenger
seat. It looks like it was a Westfalia installation.
I haven't used it yet but it would be handy for one
of those plug in coolers.

On a side note, I rented a car polisher over the weekend.
What a difference :) Removed all the oxidation and left
a mirror finish and best yet my arms didn't fall off!
It only took a couple of hours to do the whole van, if
I had planned it better I could have done another vehicle.
