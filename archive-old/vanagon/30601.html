Subject: Top speed

	I got a solid 70 mph going up hill from Scotts Valley
to the 1800 foot pass on the way to San Jose in a rented 2.0
with hydraulic lifters and F.I. There was more left. Bus was
probably less than 3 years old.

	For maximum speed runs, you need a long, straight, stretch.
It took most of Scotts Valley to get my 77 Rabbit up to its max indicated
95, starting at 70 at the north end! I got an indicated 80-85 in
my father-in-law's Triumph Herald but really don't believe it- its
a 1148 cc, with 40 hp on a good day... 40 hp, sheesh, you could
give 'em *names*! Max-speed runs also require a youthful exhuberence
I apparently lack now :)

	If Its Too Slow, You're Too Young?
