Subject: Re: High speed miss

The same thing happened to us once at around 3000 rpm. Since we were
driving at a steady speed, I put it down to the &quot;wire harness problem&quot;
(the one that requires a capacitor to fix). When I let up on the
throttle, the cut out ended and never came back.

&gt; Last night while driving on the highway my engine cut out for a second or
&gt; two, I was turning about 4000 rpm. It felt like the igniton was turned off,
&gt; this has happened twice before in the last six months. There were no
&gt; indications before or after. This is an '87 Syncro. Anybody have any ideas?
