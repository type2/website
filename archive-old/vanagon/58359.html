Antifreeze has inhibitors in it already.  Never hurts to add more.  The new 
Long life Anti-Freezes should really help.  New is now required in almost all 
new cars including VW.  In addition, the Vanagon benefits from a &quot;Water 
Wetter&quot; additive.  Available through most diesel suppliers and from Redline.  
This product breaks the surface tension of water eliminating the air bubbles 
the erode heads and cylinders and also improves heat transfer.

Subject:	Engine Coolant Corrosion Inhibitor?

 Hi all,
I just noticed an item in the Griot's Garage catalog (  (800)345-5789  ) that
looks intriguing.  It might have been in the catalog for years, but I just
noticed it.  Here's the ad copy:

Engine Coolant Corrosion Inhibitor
When the coolant in your system begins to break 
down, it forms acids that eat away the metal in
the cooling system.  In addition to this, oxygen is
absorbed into the antifreeze/water mixture which
will rust steel parts and corrode aluminum.  
Corrosion Inhibitor shifts the pH balance towards
alkaline, and neutralizes pre-existing acids 
protecting metals from acidic corrosion.  Dissolved
oxygen is removed from the coolant to help prevent 
'oxidation' type corrosion (rust).  Corrosion Inhibitor
also contains molybdenum, which helps protect
aluminum from corrosion, and will prevent the 
buildup of silicate and phosphae deposits, the
sludge that clogs your system.  This is a true 
premium product that will protect your radiator core,
heater core, water pump and coolant system from 
corrosion.  If you forget to turn on your heater very 
often this will prolong the life of the heater core as
well!  Systems should be treated every 30,000 
miles, or annually if the car is driven infrequently.
Each 35 ounce bottle treats 2 systems.  
Compatible with all glycol based antifreezes.
11181   Corrosion Inhibitor    $14.95

Has anyone tried this?  Any comments?
