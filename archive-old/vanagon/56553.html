Subject: Re: clarification please, Temp sensor II

Small brass switch is Temp sensor II

	switch next to it in thermostat housing(with Blue plug connector on the
end) is the Thermo-time switch ( this heats up and tells the Cold start
valve when to shut off)...
	
	one easy way to remember... Blue connectors= fuel related...
