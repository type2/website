Subject: Mexican Buses

&gt;Vanagoners:

        This relates to the discussions about importing vehicles, mostly buses
&gt;from Canada. I saw two brand new Mexican beetles today in Loxley, AL ( 10
&gt;miles east of Mobile.)
        From various lists I have been led to believe that it can't be done, but
&gt;there they were! The &quot;dealer&quot; said he got them approved for CA, so they
&gt;should be good for everywhere. They had AL plates on both of them. One was
&gt;the City model and the other the Classico (asking 10,995 and 11,700
&gt;respectively.)
        If he can get beetles, how about buses? What's available in Mexico? I'm
&gt;not sure just where this post belongs; vintagvw? but they're certainly NOT
&gt;vintage. and they're not water pumpers...
        What should I ask to see to make sure that they're legit?

The Mexican busses are water cooled, they run slightly modified rabbit
engines?? (1800cc) with cats and some emissions stuff  The body style is
essentially the same except in 1994?? they raised the roof 84mm to increase
head room.  The interiors are an odd mixture of traditional bus equipment
(heater controls, gauges etc.) with fancy seats, steering wheels,
headliner, etc.  If you have ever owned a bread loaf you could experience
some strange alternate reality feelings when you first get in.  I have
extolled the virtues of these buses before and some are probably sick of
hearing it.  You can rent them out of Mexico city from Kombi rent (I have
the phone number somewhere if anyone is interested).
        The type I's run the 1600cc engine, with some emissions stuff, and
have the same odd mix of traditional and new interior stuff.  VW Mexico has
offered some special editions in the past (I have seen the 'blue jean' bug
and I guess there are others).
         I was under the impression that the type I and II body styles did
not meet US safety standards and hence were not importable.  In addition
they have to meet current US emissions, which I do not think they do. If
they are importing them I wonder if they are not considered in the special
use, or not for road use, or something catagory (what official would ever
check).  The price seems real high, however.  When I checked prices, which
was before the economic collapse, beetles checked in at around $3,0000 and
vans at $10,000-$13,000.  Seems to me you could pick up a used one for very
cheap and appoint it properly to meet US specs and still come out way
ahead.  It has been my experiance that most folks in Mexico who buy new
cars take exceptional care of them.  I have seen some incredible vintage VW
rolling iron.  My grand Idea was to try and import the bodies sans engines,
drop one in at Texas, and away you go. Never pursued it, however, not sure
it is legel/feasable.  I have heard of transmografying type I vins to match
US titles from a couple of people but I of course would never advocate such
a despicable and highly illegal procedure.  Imagine, people so hyped on VW
madness that they would try to circumvent US import regulations.  I have a
couple of flyers/brochures if anyone has an interest in seeing the Mexican
models.

Hope this helps
Chris
