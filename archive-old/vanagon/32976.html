&gt;I am interested in buying a Westfella Vanogon.  I am looking for a later model
&gt;with low miles and in good shape.  I also would be very interested in getting
&gt;one of the sincros? with all wheel drive.

I don't own a a Vanagon Westfalia, or a Syncro, but I do own an older Westy
Before we go any further I just want to correct you on a few points (no flames
here just FYI)

Vanogon    =   Vanagon
Westfella  =   Westfalia
Sincro     =   syncro(I think)

&gt;I like to camp,windsurf and snow board.  The only reservations I have is
&gt;having to put on chains and how slow going up hills and clearence for off
&gt;road.  I currently own a Ford F-150 4x4 pick-up and was considering getting a
&gt;suburban until my brother had me check out his Westfella.

Camping, windsurfing, snow boarding, all good.  The ground clearance will
not be quite what you are used to, not bad but watch what your are driving
over. We have found out from a few Syncro owners, that with a good set of
tires chains are not necessarily needed, except in the worst conditions. Hill
climbing will not be as fast as your Ford can go, but it will do it with out
any problem.

&gt;I do not know to much about the vans, but drove one the other day and really
 liked all of the features.

I would suggest that before you buy get some information, first on owning
Vanagons, and working on them yourself if at all possible, as good VW garages
are hard to come by.

As far a low price/low miles, Syncros go for about $10,000+, sometimes less,
but more often that is the price range. The 2wd models go for a bit less,
and while one does not have the added traction of 4wd, they tend to fair
pretty good off the paved road.

Hope this helps,

&gt;Thanks,

Your welcome,

David
