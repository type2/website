Subject: Air flow cable

I am new to this list and have been having a great time going
through the old messages in the file.  I have a 85 Vanagon
with 165K miles.

One thing has me a little confused.  A lot of the older messages 
discuss problems with the wire harness to the air flow sensor 
causing problems.  I had some of the problems when the van was
new, but not any more.  The dealer did some things I never got
a full accounting of, but seemed to work. 

I have not been able to find anything that describes how to tell 
the difference between the old/bad cable and the new/good 
replacement cable.  I'd like to find out which cable I now have.
Is there an easy way to do this?  I understand the cable has some
&quot;active&quot; components in it.  Can you tell the difference with an 
ohmmeter?

Also, by air flow sensor, I assume they mean the squarish
aluminum unit where the CO adjustment is.  The cable that 
goes to that is part of the BIG cable that eventually winds
up at the ECU.  Is this what we are talking about?

Thanks,  John Clavin
