&gt;
&gt;Well, solar cells are very inefficient, and so are batteries. 

I'll say.  I don't know if it's still true of newer solar cells, but a solar
cell of just few years back could not make enough electricity in it's
lifetime to compensate for the amount of power consumed during it's
manufacture.  That's right they take more power to build than they can ever
make.  So they're good for providing power in remote places like sailboats,
but on the big scheme otf things they're net energy wasters!
