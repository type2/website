&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm one of those silly people, and I maintain that it is better for my
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; engine to have the flaps removed. 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with Steve. And I have proofs.

  &lt;Description of Volvo with worn internals deleted&gt;

How does this prove anything?  You have given no proof that running too
cool was responsible for the engine wear.  It could have been that the oil
was never changed, for instance.  And furthermore, you should be banned
from the list for even implying that a volvo engine has anything in 
common with an air-cooled volksie.  :)

&gt; I am going to tear down the engine to fix the vanagon syndrome soon. I might
&gt; have to replace both heads and all cylinders/pistons/rings. At 60k miles, this
&gt; is the penality of running with slow warm up.

I respect the opinions of those who think that the air flaps/thermostat are
better left on and functioning.  I think that for *my* situation it was
better to leave them off because the cooling system is underpowered and
needs all the help it can get, plus I always warm it up for a couple of
minutes before I begin driving.  I don't expect people to agree with me and
I don't claim that my way is the best, or even that it is a good idea for
anyone else, but it is working for me.  I'm happy to discuss my reasoning
with everyone, but frankly, I don't think I am going to change my mind about
this unless someone runs two identical engines in a laboratory, etc.

Cheers,
