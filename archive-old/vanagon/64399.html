Subject:      Skylight in pop-top

The skylight in our Westy has been cracked several times, due to intense
heat, no doubt.  After several attempts at home repairs we are now ready to
replace the entire unit.  The VW dealer in our area (Ontario) retails the
piece at a wholloping $380 (CdN)!
(or about six bucks U.S.!)  What other options do we have?  I suspect we'll
replace this unit more than once.
