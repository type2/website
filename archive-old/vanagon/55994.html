&gt; New guy on the list and I've got a question that's half scaring me to death.
&gt; I've got an 85 vanagon, she's apporaching the 120,000 mark and signs of wear
&gt; are begining to show.  My family and I -love- this vehicle.  Our original
&gt; thoughts were to rebuild it from top to bottom, but as we (or rather, I :)
&gt; look for information about taking on such a task nothing positive is turning
&gt; up.  Our mechanic has advised against (for no reason other than the head
&gt; problem which isn't showing up -yet-) and all literature I find about fixing
&gt; up vw's are geared toward aircooled engines.  I guess what I need is to
&gt; hear some good, positive experiences with rebuilding watercooled engines.
&gt; Unless, of course, all of them are negative, but I suppose I need to hear
&gt; that as well.  Thanks!

Rik,
Contact Kennedy engineering and put a Subaru 4 cyl engine in, 140 HP and
looks similar to VW 2.1 liter. Parts available and cheap. I have your
exact sentiments and will do this rather than rebuild this engine due to
lack of parts support from VW.
