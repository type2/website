Subject: engine: rebuild or replace?

I've got 166K on my 77 camper's engine and blue smoke when I start it.
I'm not mechanically-minded and I don't have the tools or space or time 
or knowledge to do the job myself. But the engine will have to be rebuilt
or replaced in the near future. Which is better to do?

My mechanic says a proper rebuild may cost up to $2000. I notice places,
even Sears, advertise rebuilt engines for substantially less. What's the
better direction and why?

I put a new engine (heads, pistons, rings) into my 81 vanagon for
$1600 and its doing great one year later.  This price is a East Texas
price.  My VW mechanic strongly advises against rebuilds, unless you
plan on selling it.  Good Luck.
