You know I was scanning the yards for some shifter pieces for
the Corrado and noticed a nice VR6 Passat with 9000 miles on the
odo, severeely hit rear.  Anyway the asking price for the engine
was $1500 complete with all f.i. system and computers etc.  Which
got me wondering anybody think of a VR6 Vanagon conversion.  It
wouldn't be cost effective compared to good old american V6 iron
but it would be &quot;pure&quot; VW.  Plus as both the good old 4 in the G60
and the VR6 volted to the same trannies, seems like maybe the conversion
would bolt up easier, though the clutch was severely redesigned and
who knows about clearance questions and oiling.  Anyway just wondered
if anyone had given it any thought.
