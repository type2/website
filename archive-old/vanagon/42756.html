Subject: Re: VIN question

I have a question concerning the VIN from my '67 Westy.  After
removing decades of crud (thank you supermarket steam cleaners....and
yes the engine was out), the number stamped to the right of the engine
is *247016777*.  You see the problem?  I tried to look this up in the
- - - - -

this is a vin for a deluxe produced early is the 67 model year.  actually in
Aug 66.
    2 - transporter, 4- deluxe, 7 -sixty seven.     are you sure it's not
237?   is it one of the few westys withe four windows behind the doors on
each side?


Additionally, my engine number is H123628 which places the engine in
the same time frame (as near as I can tell)....though I was told by
the PO that the engine was from a '73 beetle :-S 
 - - - - -

H case motors were built as 1500cc s   that one came from a  mid 66 bus or
bug  (though it could well have been put in a 73)

your bus would have comw with a number between H0 183 372 and H0 272 902
