Subject: Heater Hoses, Clunking Noise and 83-85 AC Unit Removal

Hello all:

I have a pinhole leak in one of my heater hoses--these look generic 
(not formed) and I would like to avoid the dealer.  As long as I have 
the coolant drained, I plan on replacing all of them.  Anyone know 
what the diameter of these are?

Also, a clunking noise, very faint and dull, has developed at the 
rear of my van.  I have new shocks and rebuilt axles so I think we 
can eliminate those as a source of the noise.  Anyone experience such 
a noise?

My AC fan has developed a noise that sounds like something is 
scraping the fan fins.  I plan on removing the overhead unit (in the 
'85 the unit is mounted just behind the front seats).  Before I 
investigate how to pull this unit down does anyone have any tips on 
doing this?  I would also like to reseal the top cover--it leaks 
air--I have done this on the duct going to the front and the vents 
behind the visors with double stick tape successfully.  I also plan 
on cleaning the unit thoroughly--it smells pretty raunchy.

My new engine is 15 months old now and it seems perfect, no oil 
consumption and no leaks and no air bubbles.
