Subject: '54 RHD Deluxe Update

        I worked on the barndoor last night, after reading the VW Trends
article on Ritchie King's '54 RHD Deluxe for inspiration.  It seems like
there may be a 4th RHD Deluxe in existence, which kinda bums me out, meaning
mine is a little bit less rare :)

        Anyway, being dateless and desperate again tonight, I updated my web
page (finally) with some pix of the work I've done on the bus.  You can
check this all out at http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/54resto.html and there's a
link from there to where the pix are.

        Enjoy.
