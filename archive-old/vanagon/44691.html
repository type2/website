Subject: Re: CB &amp; VW humor

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; With all the talk lately of CB's in VW's, I just couldn't resist....
&gt;
&gt; &quot;..and eleven long haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse Microbus.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If you don't remember, your bus is older than you are.
&gt;
Indeed, my bus is almost as old as I am.  But this I don't remember, why
don't you enlighten me?

Thanks
Eric (71)
