Subject:  oil filter wrench

Hey all,
So, all you folks out there who have buses with Type IV engines, what
do you use to get the oil filter off??  It's a little cramped under there so it
doesn't look like I'd be able to get one of those standard oil filter
wrenches up there.  I have a wrench from Toyota that attaches to a
ratchet and slips over the bottom of the filter, but it's too small in diameter
to fit the VW filter.  Is there a special filter removal tool that you have to
buy or can it be done another way?

Sean
