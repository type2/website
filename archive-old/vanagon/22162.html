&gt; Anyone have opinions on Brooklands and/or Clymer manuals?

Mark, the best manuel that i have found is a clymers from way back when.  
the one i have is from 1967 and covers all early bus's extensivly.  it is 
not real easy to find but is the best thing next to the factory one.  try 
old bookstores or restorationd houses.
hope this helps
