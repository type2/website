Subject: RE: luggage rack / sunroof??


_______________________________________________________________________________
&gt;   Can anyone say if that luggage rack depression can be cut out
&gt;   by mere mortals and successfully have a sunroof of some kind
&gt;   grafted on there?? Even an extra 1.5&quot; of headroom would be
&gt;   welcome! And a little breeze in the summer from above would
&gt;   be heaven!
&gt;
What about cutting out the fibreglass bottom, but leave enough of a lip to 
fit  hardwood slats to? With the FG out of the way get a standard glass lid 
sunroof installed for &lt;$300. Then put in the slats/wooden rack. Should be 
able to get enough height to open the sunroof one or two clicks. 

     tim s.

  Excellent idea!!! Thank you!
