Subject:  shipping a motor $?

any ideas how much it might cost to ship an 2l air-cooled motor/exhaust
system from los angeles to michigan?  my brother has one, and it sure
would be nice to have a spare if the price is reasonable.  i'm prepared
for the worst, though.  anybody from la with a truck planning a vacation
in warm and sunny michigan?
