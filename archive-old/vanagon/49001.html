Subject: Too much Coolant?

Hi all, got back from the Lawrence MA VW show yesterday. It was okay,
seemed better last year. only 5 vanagons in the 80 - 91 class, don't know
if Siegfried won anything because we had to leave. Anyway, the coolant
overflow tank seems to be ove the cold fill line. I checked yesterday after
getting back and the tank was very full. Today it is about an 1/8th inch
above the line. Should I slurp some out or is this okay? TIA
