&gt; &gt; 	The question I have is this;  How hot is too hot and when (soon) 
&gt; &gt; I instal a temp guage should it be an oil temp or head temp (such as #3)?
&gt; &gt; BTW, the last rebuild was necetated because the L head loosened up--the 
&gt; &gt; manual says this should'nt happen.  Well I know better now, I guess!?
&gt; &gt; BTW  I'm new to this internet thing, so thanks in advance and &quot;see&quot; you 
&gt; &gt; later.

&gt; The dipstick tube should not be too hot to hold.  IMO the first gauge to get
&gt; is oil pressure.  It will tell you more about temp than the other ones...

Ditto that. You should consider buying gauges in this order of importance:
oil pressure; oil temp; head temp. BUT in any case do not disable your
idiot lights as they serve a purpose which gauges cannot. Also if you feel
squeemish about gauges there is a head temp sensor which attaches to the
idiot oil light. Also there was DIY description for something similar in the
Vanagon gopher (but I think he's got the head temps way too low). if you
need help e-mail me - DC  &gt;
