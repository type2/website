The Hayne's manual (British Vanagon) recommends changing the transmission
oil every 30,000 km but they say this is only for the die hard purist and
not crucial as Cetin pointed out. DC

Also whoever posted the question about converting the 2.0 l Vanagon
engine to a carb setup; the Hayne's manual does show such a setup for the
1.6l and 2.0l British vanagons, but I suspect these parts didn't make it
into the states. I cannot think  of very many good reasons for switching
to a carb setup for the 2.0l engine. Why? FI parts are plentiful and all
except for the brain box are relatively inexpensive (even the computer
can be had for under 200 at a good wreckers); the FI system is easier to
maintain (and diagnose) if set up properly; it seems pretty good on fuel
and it starts well in cold and hot temps. It sounds like the problem
related to burned valves is due to the tuned exhaust you are running (an
exhaust leak will have the same effect of leaning the mixture, yes?). I
agree that these systems  can run lean and would be interested in hearing
from people who have high mileage FI Air cooled vanagons and what their
secrets to success are.
