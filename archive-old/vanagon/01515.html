Subject: 34PICT3 vs. 31PICT1/2/3

Does anyone out there know of a kit to allow the use of the pre-1971
carburetor one a '71 dual-port engine? I have 1600 cc engines in both
of my busses. One is a single-port, the other is a dual dual-port.
The single-port engine runs better, gets better mileage, and requires fewer
carb overhauls. And I have a whole pile of 31PICT-x carbs to choose from.
The 34PICT-3 carb costs nearly $200 to replace. BTW, I use 009 distributors
with both engines. The dual-advance distributor that goes with the
34PICT-3 works until the vacuum diphragm starts leaking. Replacing
that is expensive.
