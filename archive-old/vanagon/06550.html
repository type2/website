I've had similar experiences, with both our '82 and '91.  The problem 
with the '81 was a loose oxygen sensor wire.  This manifested itself in 
western Wyoming, which may very well have been about 5000'.  Our problem 
with the '91 was due to loose chassis/engine/transmission ground wire 
connections (which apparently affect the airflow and other inputs to the 
FI computer).
