I've got an '82 with 97k and no rebuild. Runs great, but compression is about 
15psi low in one cylinder. I've been told to expect 120-130k with good 
maintanance, but I see a lot in the paper that say &quot;75k miles, rebuilt motor...&quot;

As usual, YMMV. Has it got any records?

&gt; All this talk about cracked heads and leaking head gaskets is starting to get
&gt; me worried.  I may buy an '82 Westy with 81k (never had a rebuild).  How long
&gt; can I reasonably expect it to last without needing a major rebuild, i.e., 
&gt; what's the typical trouble-free lifespan for an aircooled Vanagon engine?
