Subject:       Cheapo Oil Thermometer ???

Hello friends!

With all the talk of overheating I went in search of a candy 
thermometer, but of the many places I tried I came up empty handed.

All of the candy thermometers are encased in glass casing which is 
about 1/2 inch wide (of those that I saw), and would be too wide to 
fit down the dipstick hole.  

I saw some meat thermometers which looked great (would fit sizewise), 
but alas they only go to 180 degrees or so.

Any suggestions?
