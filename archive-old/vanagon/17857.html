Subject: Caravan to Bug-out

Well, I picked up the bus from the inspection station, low brake fluid and 
battery hold down fail and repaired.  Now I get to stand in line at the MVA 
tommorrow for the tags (JOY).

Now for my real question.  I hope to drive my new old toy to the Virginia 
Bug-out and would like to caravan with other bus and/or other VW 
enthusiasts.  Is anyone coming down Rt 15 south from Pennsylvania through 
Maryland?  I would like to &quot;tag along&quot; if anyone wants one more tired bus 
bringing up the rear.  

One more question.  I plan on adding my own camping supplies to my standard 
9 pass. bus and am interested in other inovative ideas that people have 
tried and live with comfortably.  I don't plan on restoring this beast any 
time soon, so a full Westy replacement interior is out of the question, 
unless someone is willing to part with theirs for oh, lets say $100. :)  
Anyway, besides the tarp awning thread I have been following for several 
days, lets here those suggestions for wanna be campers like myself.

Hope to see you at the Bug-out, not the side of the road.
