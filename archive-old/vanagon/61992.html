JC Whitney has solar panels.  I got mine from Damark, one of those 
mail order liquidation companies.  It's a 5W (about 1/2 amp since it 
runs at 16V) panel that's maybe 12&quot;x16&quot; that came with battery clips 
for under $70.  I use it to charge my deep cycle battery, which I'll 
be installing soon.  Also, my cranking battery is weak and I suspect 
I have a power drain somewhere, so it keeps it topped up.  

I don't have a charging cut-off, so I manually check the voltage,
etc.  From what I have heard, it _is_ possible to cook off your
battery with a trickler charger if it has no overcharge protector.

The panel has countersunk holes for permanent installation and are 
allegedly weatherproof.  I have not tested to that extent.

&gt; Also, I saw a solar panel attached to the top of a vanagon the 
&gt; other day.  Would this be used for battery charging or maybe just
&gt; aux power for toys?  Any thoughts on uses, $$$ for solar panels?
