&gt;I have an 87 Westy gl with 95,000 miles.  This one is tempting me.  The only

Sounds pretty good to me.  My wife's 88 is an automatic (we were both used to
sticks) and it hasn't given us a single problem in over 100,000 miles :-)
We got used to the automatic quickly and now she complains when she has to
operate the shifter on my Syncro!
