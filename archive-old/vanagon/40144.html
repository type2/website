Subject: Re: Bike Racks

&gt;Apparently the bike rack I was inquiring about is made by Paulchen.  It is 
made in Germany; not 

Got a close-up look at one of these on an EV at the dealers on Tues. GREAT!! 
Rigidly held on by curved plates top/bottom of the hatch with rubber pads.  
Had foldown rack that held tires of 3 bikes or served as BIG suitcase/trunk 
shelf.  When rack folded down 2 sliding feet extended onto the bumper, 
carrying the racks weight, can you say nifty! Curved plates looked like they 
would fit a vanagon better, prolly came off one, didn't see the owner.  They 
are bulky, add 10&quot; to rear when folded, and would get crunched if not 
careful backing up.

A word about the Rhode Gear unit, mine is fitted up front, supported on 
bumper and strapped to rad supports inside grill '87 van, not perfect and 
too low for absent minded folk, scraaaape.  I tried it on the rear but 
having two bikes+rack suspended by the tie down straps only struck me as 
risky. Besides, if they are up front and the straps break I get to run over 
the bikes first, not some stranger following me. :^0   Tim
