Subject: Re: Hard to Shift

Top off the transmission fluid? Check and see if there's any
transmission fluid left in the transmission?

&gt; The past couple of days I've been experiencing some very hard

&gt; is fine(sometimes a little loose) but by lunch(has sat for 3 hours)
&gt; shifting is starting to get real stiff.  When it is time to leave work
&gt; shifting is requiring a lot of muscle. I have no problems finding the
&gt; gears.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas what the problem may be?
