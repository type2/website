Subject: Going, going, gone!

Well Joel, time to adjust your stats.  I sold the 1980 Vanagon today.
Gauges and all.  Looks like I'm committed to the EV now! I'll miss the
Vanagon, it was a fun car to drive, and of course there's a part of me (and
a chunk of my money) in keeping it going. (But it sure is nice to cruise at
70+ and accelerate while going *up* mountains!)

I told the buyer about this list, perhaps he will subscribe.
I also took his picture, maybe I'll post it to my Vanagon page instead of
all the stuff that's up there now!

Since the only air-cooled motor I have left now is on my lawnmower (well,
okay I have another one on the house emergency generator but it doesn't get
used much) I think I'll be unsubscribing from the type2 list too. Hopefully
you Inuvik folk will be cross-posting your trip reports, and anyone else
with items of general interest will do the same!
