In that same vein, no matter what lights you put in, if you have only 9.8
volts your lights will be dim. After running a direct line with new relays my
voltage jumped from 10.1v to 13.1v. it made a big difference, I also changed
to 130w h3 bulbs in my high beams. They are like flame throwers.  In regard
to the lenses, I remember reading about someone putting their lenses, hole
down, into the dishwasher. They said it worked real well.
