Subject: R-12 to R-134 Freon in Vanagons-Any Info?

Just wondering if anyone on the list has any information on the refrigerant
changes (R-12 to R-134) that we all may be facing in the next 2 years or
so.  Does VW have any conversion kits yet for the Vanagon, any mention of
what the cost might be?  GM says their upgrades may be $500 to $600 while
Fords may run $1000 to $1200.
