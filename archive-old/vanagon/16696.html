&gt; Any experience/recommendations/options to rotate the CV joints 
&gt; (inner/outer or right/left or both) or even left and right driveshaft 
&gt; with CV joints to assure even wearing?

Although, I've often figured after reading suggestions a couple
of years ago that swapping joints side to side is good, I really think
swapping driveshafts could be a big error, after all they have gone
in your case 15 years being constantly torqued in one direction,
suddenly changing this could have nasty results IMHO.
