Subject: Re: damage from missing upper bellhousing bolts?
Date: Mon, 20 Feb 1995 11:43:08 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;orion!thom_at_netcom_dot_com&gt;

&gt;As a further clarification, the lower bellhousing nuts were installed, so
&gt;the front of the engine was fastened to the transaxle.  The rear of the
&gt;engine was supported by the cross-member.
&gt;
&gt;P.S.  The case did not crack.  Other things happened, and I am wondering
&gt;whether the ultimate cause of my Bus' chronic mechanical problems
&gt;originates from not having the upper bellhousing bolts installed.

I can see starter-flywheel problems right off the bat.  Throttle cable 
length problems, maybe.
