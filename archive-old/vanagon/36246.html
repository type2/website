Volks,
	Some of you have not been able to access my VW page during the last
day or two.  My ISP was upgrading their web server and some things
needed to be changed in my account in order for the pages to still work.
The changes have been made and the pages are back online, with a couple
of new additions to the Westfalia page.  I added pictures from a
brochure given to me by Michael Heron.  It's a German brochure, and
there are some interesting Westys for sale over there!

-David
