Subject: Westu Propane Problem

Hi all, I'm new to this list and sure glad I found it.

I have a 85 Westy and this winter found that the auto stop-fill valve on
the propane tank has blown.  No problem, me thinks, I'll just replace
it.  Wrong answer!  Apparently they are no longer made and I can't
locate one anywhere.

The tank is made my Manchester and we have even contacted them to no
avail.  Has anyone else experienced this problem and what did you do to
solve it?

FYI, the auto-stop fill valve is the valve that you actually attach the
propane line to for filling.  It's purpose is to prevent filling the
propane tank beyond 80% full.  I've had a blown regulator before too,
and that's no problem to replace.  It's just this dang fill valve that
no one makes any more that causing me a major headhead.  I'll be leaving
for Alaska in May and sure need to get it working before then!  Hey,
I'll even consider a good used one if I can find one.

Thanks in advance for any and all advise.
