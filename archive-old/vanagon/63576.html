&gt; Cool! But what I want to do is find out what size tires the factory 6.13
&gt; gear ratio gears would cause us to purchase to have the van have the same
&gt; characteristics as the 25&quot; tires that are original to the 4.86 gears.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't find out how to do this with the gearing calculator, so can you
&gt; help?  ...or anybody else, for that matter?

Hi: You might try the gearing calculator at http://www.vmar_dot_com/   It
works a little different. You can enter the tire size by inches. Just
keep increasing the tire size until you get the speeds you want.
