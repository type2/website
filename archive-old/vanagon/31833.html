&gt;&gt; My friend has a 89 syncro, just purchased. When turning tight. The wheels
&gt;&gt; bind and have a lurching sensation. The characteristics seem like the rear
&gt;&gt; diff is locked. VW machanic say the CV's are fine. He said it is a normal
&gt;&gt; function of a Syncro. 
&gt;
&gt;It *is* normal for the Syncro to feel a little funny when tight turning,
&gt;but I don't get the lurching or binding; at certain speeds I seem to get
&gt;&quot;pulled through&quot; the turn, which is actually a positive handling
&gt;characteristic.
&gt;
&gt;The different steering sensation occurs since the circles tracked by the
&gt;front wheels are appreciably larger than those tracked by the rear, so
&gt;there is a front/rear rotation-rate difference which the viscous
&gt;coupling &quot;doesn't like&quot;. However, this represents a &quot;front slip/rear
&gt;traction&quot; situation, the reverse of the normal 4W-engaged scenario, and
&gt;I have been curious about whether the viscous coupling would engage in
&gt;this case (Syncronauts help me out here.)  This would be somewhat
&gt;related to the question: do you get 4WD in reverse? (since the torque on
&gt;the viscous coupler from the drive shaft is also in the opposite
&gt;direction.)
&gt;
&gt;I have been warned by mechanics *not* to make tight U-turns in a Syncro
&gt;(do a 3-pt instead) because of these considerations...is it just an old
&gt;wive's tale that this is hard on the front drive?
&gt;
&gt;Of course, the symptoms described also sound alot like a locked
&gt;differential - it should be pretty easy to determine whether the rear
&gt;diff-lock is on (if you have one - if so, make sure the front display
&gt;light, which gives positive feedback, isn't burnt out) - but a *front*
&gt;differential which has locked up :-( might give similar symptoms, along
&gt;with other steering anomalies.

I would describe the feeling I get during U-turns in my Syncro as a &quot;slight
binding sensation&quot;.  As Steve describes above, the tires are turning at
different rates and the function of the viscous coupling comes into play.  I
wouldn't describe this as something that the coupling &quot;doesn't like&quot;, just
normal operation.  The coupling will operate in reverse the same way as it
does going forward.  When one shaft starts turning at a different speed than
the other, the viscous silicon fluid acts to bind them together and bring
them back to equal speed.  I don't think that U-turns do anything to the
coupling that it wouldn't nomally see on a traction poor surface.
