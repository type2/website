So Richard.Campbell_at_newcastle.ac_dot_uk sez:
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell me if you can polish the whole of the fuche rim??
&gt;I've just bought some (5!!!) and the inserts are painted Pink!! - I'm 
&gt;wondering can I get them shot blasted and then polish the whole rim 
&gt;as I've heard varying stories...
&gt;Can anyone put me straight??? Cheers

Yup.  Gotta have the right wheels and something that will spin them fast
enough..

Don't blat them, though - they're too soft for that.  

BTW - what size and how much for the wheels?
