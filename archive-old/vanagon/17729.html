&gt; An informed discussion and/or pointers to 12v solar panel stuff would
&gt; be interesting.  Now that summer is here I'd love to implement a solar
&gt; powered ventilation system.  Anyone seen such?

They sell them in most RV catalogs.  You can pay up to $500 for one.  I
posted a while ago about my solar panel installation - It shouldn't be
hard to locate in the archives.  BTW - I picked up a nice RF-style
ammeter at a surplus store for $3 and installed it yesterday.  Scale is
0-8 amps.  Works great with the panels!  It was reading 2.6 amps in
weak sunlight earlier this morning.  Someday when I have the time I will
post a more complete description of what I did, where I got the parts,
etc, but I can't do it before GNATT.  Of course, anyone that wants to 
see it and get the full poop scoop just has to show up at Busses by the
Arch in St. Louis on May 26-28!  :)
