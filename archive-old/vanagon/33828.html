 &gt;&gt; But seriously,  Does the bus idle fine at all times?  Does this only occur

 &gt;&gt; push on the pedal.
 &gt;
 &gt;Yes, the bus idles fine at all times...and this only occurs when I push
 &gt;down hard on pedal. I can push slowly and get it to accelerate (raise
 &gt;rpms) fine, but when I'm at a stoplight, I can't get no satisfaction (and
 &gt;neither can the driver behind me)...that is, this slow acceleration and
 &gt;subsequent torture of my clutch doesn't get me out of the way fast
 &gt;enough. It appears to be more severe during the first 10 minutes of driving.


This problem right here is definately because your fuel/air mixture is not
lean enough during rapid acceleration.  The one thing you need to check
here is the accelerator nozzle.  It has to point at the edge of the
throttle bore, not the center...

Looking down into your throttle bore from the top (it's hard to draw an
ascii circle) :



    /-----\          Fuel nozzle (a) is pointed down center of throttle bore.
   /  GAP  \         This is incorrect.  When throttle plate is open, raw fuel
a (===o     )        will squirt onto the plate, not through the GAP, resulting
   \       /         in a leaner mixture.
    \-----/
   incorrect

    /-----\          Fuel nozzle (b) is pointed at the GAP between the throttle
b  /===o   \         plate and the throttle bore.   When throttle plate is
open,
  (         )        raw fuel will squirt through the gap, providing a richer
   \       /         mixture.
    \-----/
    correct


Once you know the accelerator nozzle is pointed to the gap properly, you
can count this step out. If a flat spot still occurs, there are three more
things you can try out...

1) Hesitation may occur if the sparks aren't igniting properly.  If your
timing is okay and the van idles okay, then check your distributor cap.
The contact points under the cap (where the rotor contacts) may be very
corroded.  Clean them off with the tip of a knife until they are nice and
shiny.  This is a place often overlooked and was one of the main problems
with my engine performance (D'oh!)

2) Getting back to your carb (you are using a 34pict3,yeah?) , The
&quot;Butterfly Valve&quot; can be adjusted with a screwdriver.  This valve adjusts
how much of a squirt of gas is added to your mixture when you floor it.  It
should have a + and - symbol on it.  With a little experimenting your flat
spot should go away.

3) If you still need more &quot;oomph&quot; to get rid of your flat spot, I imagine
the only way to get more raw gas out of the nozzle is to ream it larger.  I
haven't tried this yet, but it sounds logical enough...

 &gt;&gt; Have you checked the air cleaner and tube
 &gt;&gt; to make sure it's not blocked (like with a mouse nest).

  &gt;Actually, no I haven't. I can, however, see the little counterweight
  &gt;dealy (how's that for a technical term) on the air cleaner raise up when
  &gt;I give her gas...presumably to increase the air supply. I think that's
  &gt;what Johnny89 referred to as going &quot;atmospheric.&quot;

Actually, what I was referring to was the pressure in the CARB becoming
atmospheric.  It has nothing to do with your air cleaner. Your carb depends
on changes in air pressure to work properly. That is why leaks are
important to fix.  If there are no leaks around the manifold or carb
connections, then you can rule leaks out as a cause of your flat spot
problems.  From what I gather, leaks would also cause more problems than
flat spots.

Concerning your flat spot: When you step on the gas you open up the
THROTTLE PLATE.  When the throttle plate is open almost all the way, or
wide open throttle (WOT), the air pressure in the THROTTLE BORE becomes
equal to that of the atmosphere (the air we breathe) and all of the CARB
CIRCUITS(the holes, etc. that channel air/fuel mixtures through the carb)
are cut off temporarily.  This causes your air/fuel mixture to go instantly
LEAN, meaning, more air than gas, and your engine hesitates for a moment.
The ACCELERATOR NOZZLE will squirt raw gas into the engine through the
THROTTLE BORE and give it a kick until the PROGRESSIVE CIRCUITS in your
carb start to take over.  This is why the accelerator nozzle is one of the
first places to look when encountering a flat spot.  It also explains why
the nozzle must be pointed at the edge of the throttle bore and not the
center. The more raw gas your engine gets during that instant acceleration
the better off it is.


  &gt; WAIT!!!!! I just realized something.  Only after it's warmed up?  So when
  &gt;&gt; it's cold and the choke is on and the mixture is fuel rich it runs fine?
  &gt;
  &gt;right.
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt; And when it's warm and the choke is open and the mix is right then we gots
  &gt;&gt; problems?  Are you sure the choke is opening back up?  Lock the choke open
  &gt;&gt; while the engine is cold and see what happens.  Drive it around and see
  &gt;
  &gt;I'm sure it's opening back up. Thought about that and double checked.
  &gt;Details on this are a little fuzzy and many variables have changed, but I
  &gt;*think* she was running better with the choke out of adjustment (always
  &gt;closed) at one time. I tried this again recently, though, and the results
  &gt;were disappointing in the sense that I can't recreate the situation.

A note regarding your auto choke. You would know if your auto choke was
stuck closed, becuase your car would idle at an extremely fast rate at
startup, and not die down.

A note regarding heat.  When your car is cold, the leftover droplets of
fuel in the intake manifold condense into an unburnable mixture.  This
mixture mixes with the new air/fuel mixture and causes your engine to
hesitate becuase it can't ignite the mixture.  As your car warms up, this
problem takes care of itself. (I doubt you're experiencing carb icing, so I
won't get into that here)


  &gt;That's a possibility, though the carb really doesn't get warm enough to
  &gt;experience what I'd think of as heat expansion. The other thing I'm
  &gt;thinking now is that once the bus is *really warm* (e.g., after driving
  &gt;10 miles), this problem gets minimal and I experience other problems...a
  &gt;sort of lugging or gas not firing on de-acceleration...almost like
  &gt;somebody with a small rope, tugging at the back of the bus. This happens,
  &gt;for example, when I let off the gas in third to approach a stop sight.

If you don't think your cylinder is firing properly then it's most likely a
timing problem.  Check your distributor cap like I suggested and all of
your spark plug connections. For added security I use dielectric grease on
the contacts, just to make sure everything is solid.

Carbs with vaccum advances have a problem on decelleration but I doubt if
that's your problem.  If your plugs are gapped properly, they are the last
bit on your list.  I would imagine your problem lies within your carb.

Good luck, I hope any of this information helps.  I'm not claiming to be an
expert on this subject, but this problem just happens to be where I'm at
with my bus as well :)

Johnny
