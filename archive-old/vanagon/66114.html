Actually I would vote for a bearing(s) in the transmission, as opposed to
the gears.  Just my $0.02 :)

Good luck!

&gt; HI, everyone. I seem to have developed a serious whine in my Carat's
&gt; tranny, 4-speed.
&gt; Is there any other parts, other than the gears themselves, that would
&gt; cause this whine? I checked the gear lube level and it's full. I did run
&gt; it low for a while, but then it was difficult to shift and didn't make
&gt; any noise. Now it shifts OK, but is noisy when you are in a low gear and
&gt; let off the gas.
