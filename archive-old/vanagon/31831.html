Subject: Front-end shimmies

To All:

A recent thread on Martha's Thinglist touched on front end shimmy that
vanished when the wheels were balanced on the car.

Balancing the wheel on the car includes the brake drum or rotor in the
rotating mass.  When you have your wheels balanced on the car it is important
that they be returned to the same orientation should they have to be removed.
 A witness-mark of paint is sufficient to keep things lined up.

Castings from Mexico and Brazil are often of poor dimension quality.  It is
not uncommon to find cylinders with mis-cast fins or brake drums that are not
concentric to their bore.  Imbalance -- and the shimmy noted above -- occurs
when a brake drum casting is machined slightly off center.  Although such
drums can be balanced by removing metal from the heavy side, it is unwise to
do do.  Indeed, it is not a good idea to use such drums in any case.  Having
been machined off-center the drum will usually warp when heated from braking
action.  You can have such drums turned repeatedly only to have the warp
reappear.

Normally, a drum machined far enough off center to cause a serious imbalance
can be detected by visual inspection.  Examine the casting around the hub
bore.  If there is appreciably more metal on one side than the other, reject
the part.
