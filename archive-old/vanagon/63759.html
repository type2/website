Greetings from Canada

	I'am at the end of my rope. My 86 double Cab hasn't run since late June. 
It just quit on the way home one evening it would start but won't keep
running.  I cleaned the grounds up and away we went for a coupla miles.
Then she quit altogether.  I found there was no spark. I replaced the spark
plugs, rotor, dist cap and one spark plug wire.    then the was no fuel.  
so i took the harness apart and fix the multiple ground connection at the
front of the engine, the fuel came back.   But still no spark.  I rang out
wires to the ECU, cleaned the coil connections tested the coil as per
bentley OK.   brings me to the Hall sender  I tried testing it with a
multimeter(digital Fluke 77) but didn't get a blip. Bentley says to use a
digital probe.  I also did the ground the center lead of the plug to the
hall center to get 4.5Volts across the coil and didn't get change in
voltage.   I tested all the other switches and the air box and all appear 
OK.   As i type this it seems like i have to bite the bullet and replace
the ECU.   I am not too enthsiastic about this as the ECU was replaced 2
years ago and i feel that these should last the life of the vehicle and not
less then the life of the exhaust pipes. Any advice or suggestions would be
welcome.
