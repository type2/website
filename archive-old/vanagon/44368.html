&gt;As seen in today's Toronto Star
&gt;
&gt;1985 VW Westfalia $4,000/offer (this is in CDN funds would work out to be 
about $2700.00 US) phone 
&gt;905-881-4393. Need to sell urgently
&gt;
&gt;seems pretty cheap to me I know no further details please contact the 
seller directly

This IS cheap folks, dealers demand $10K+, private goes $7-10K, local 
mechanic wants $9K for '85 in tiptop shape, his parents vehicle. Watch the 
rusties!.  Tim

PS: CDN $ is sinking lower daily, $1.00CDN = $0.72US.
