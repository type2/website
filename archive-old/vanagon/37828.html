Subject: '58 is Home &quot;Free&quot;

The '58 non-sunroof Deluxe that I was given during my week of &quot;Incredible 
Volkswagen Luck&quot; arrived from Oklahoma on Saturday.  Typical rough Bus.  
Looked like it had had a fire mid-ship on the driver's side (gas 
heater?), the panel behind the front seats has been removed, the turn 
signals (fore and aft) have been replaced by large generic ones, wheel 
wells cut (the five-spoke wheels and fat tires still mounted).  One of 
the corner windows decided to stay somewhere in Oklahoma (!?).  It did 
come stuffed full of extra parts.  The interior and some other pieces off 
of a '67 Westfalia, couple of gas heaters (Southwind) used in 50's 
American Pickups, and who knows what else (haven't had time to unload 
it).  One nice extra was a 6' roof rack for a Bus (rusty, but straight).  
The Bus will probably go to pieces.  Not bad for a free (and delivered) Bus.
Now if I can just do something with it before the neighbors call the city 
on me...
