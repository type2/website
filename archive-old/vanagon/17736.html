Subject: Re: Defender Industries, refrigerator fan

&gt; Defender Industries (a boating supply house through mail order) has a
&gt; FridgeMate Ice Box Cooler.  The description is:  Runs on 2 D-cell batteries,
&gt; circulates air in refrigerator or ice box to eliminate hot spotes and arrest
&gt; spoilage.  3.4&quot; x 2.5&quot;.  Price is $13.95.
&gt; 
&gt; They also have a 12v refrigerator circular fan to cool off the evaporator
&gt; coils.  Price is $22.95.
&gt; 
&gt; Their number is 800-628-8225.  They charge no sales tax on orders going
&gt; outside of New York.  Order their catalog (free) since boating and VWs have
&gt; more in common than one might imagine.  For example, the marine wiring is
&gt; fully tinned and corrosion is kept to a minimum.  

Battery fan part number: D96-3#FM3.

But ... they have a minimum order amount of $25, so I had to be
content with ordering the CATALOG, which will take two weeks to
arrive. Maybe someone who has the catalog can suggest another
twelve-dollar item to match up with the fan ?
