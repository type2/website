Subject: Jalousie Louvre window Vanagon retrofit?

Greetings Volks Folks.

Is there an aftermarket source of some sort of jalousie louvres (like on my
72 Westy) that can fit over the sliding window on the 89 Westy?

Also: is there a retrofit window that can fit in the rear side windows to
be able to open them, like the side swing window on the 72 Westy?

I truly miss these on the waterbox.

Thanks in advance.


Louise
