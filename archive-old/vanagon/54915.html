Subject:       Re: Pad over engine &amp; Fire extinguisher

&gt; Concerning the engine lid though, all later models (87+) I've seen came wth
&gt; the plastic lid, while and 82 diesel's I saw came with the heavy metal lid.
&gt;  I think VW changed over sometime between 82 &amp; 86 from metal to plastic on
&gt; all the lids.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know when this change was made?
&gt; 
My '88 has plastic, and an '87 we drove had plastic, but an '83.5 w/b 
Westy had metal. The metal ones are far heavier...
