&gt;L82 &quot;Silver White&quot; is typically used only on the bumpers, wheels, and where
&gt;applicable, the poptop for the Westfalias. This L82 differs from the L87

Jim Ellis (if this is your real name...): 

1) Does this color code and use apply to all model years or only to
splits? 

2) Poptops actually get painted? (Although impermeable, the poptop of my
'75 is rough and porous. If L82 is the real thing, then there's a new
project for some distant future...)
