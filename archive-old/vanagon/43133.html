Subject: VW a sex symbol?

A quote from page 22 of &quot;Is Your Volkswagen A Sex Symbol&quot;


&quot;Volkswagen buyers are a special group.  When you buy a Volkswagen, you
don't just get a car; you aquire alot of friends --other Volkswagen owners.
The Volkswagen is a way of life. More than that, it is a declaration of a
certain attitude towards life and society.  The Volkswagen owner is saying
that he is concerned about economics, air pollution and good craftsmanship.
Volkswagen owners include students, professional people, and executives as
well as older retired persons who appreciate economy and ease of handling.
Creativity marks the Volkswagen owners.  They usually take an intellectual
and rational view of life.   They are individualists.  A Volkswagen owner
is almost fiercely loyal to his &quot;bug&quot; and does not harbor secret wishes to
own a Cadillac, a Thunderbird or a Continental.&quot;


In fact, the above reference is the ONLY reference listed in the index
other than the name in the title of the book by Dr. Jean Rosenbaum

I also noted that while on the discussion of automobiles and the intrinsic
significance between the type of automobile we own and our sexual orientation
Dr. Jean only discusses Volkswagens, Convertibles, Station Wagons, Luxury
Cars and 4x4....Hmmm, Volkswagen is a type of car and not a brand...
