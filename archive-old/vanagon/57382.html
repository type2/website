 seen a similar set-up in '74 and later busses.  I figure I could sheet
 metal screw a larger plate on top of the piece I've removed and then screw
 that onto the rear deck when I didn't need it open. &gt;&gt;

actually, it's '73 up, and why don't you just cut the rear deck out of a
'73-'79 bus, trap door, and all? Then you could just pop rivit (a pop rivit
gun is a old buses' friend) it into your '71.
