&gt; If not so far all you 'get' is my VIN - but I'll have to look that one up.

&gt; Annoying everybody just to 'show' that some EVs are pretty much problem

&gt; &gt;   Owning a EV, I know they follow in the Vanagons footsteps for being

&gt; &gt;   I was thinking that if you fellow EVers would be inerested in sending all
&gt; &gt; the stats about your Eurovans, VIN, Costs, Repairs (mileage at occurance),
&gt; &gt; everything but gas and oil.


EV folks:
I don't know if I have the time to type in all the problems that I have had
with My EV since I bought it Nov 94 (new 93).  It now has 30K on it.  If
you are *really* interested, Tracey, I could tell the tale, perhaps
off-line so as to not hog everybodies modems in the transfer (but sorry
about the following long post anyway!).  Having said that, I will add that
since the last *problem* was fixed about 10K ago, it's been a terrific van.
And, ALL new cars are expensive to repair.  The hope is you won't have to,
till they're OLD!

And when you compare it to the options in new vans that are out there:

Toyota Previa (jelly bean van) - I had a 91 for about 6 months.  They don't
feel very solidly built, and literally HOWL when you hit the gass hard.
Ride funny, too.  Not enough room.  If you put a carpet dash protector on
the dash, it reflects the sky on a sunny day so its like looking through a
dirty windshield.  Stupid idea, that windshield.  Not a *real* van.

Ford Aerostar - I've driven a few of these.  Look almost like a real van
from the outside.  On the inside, though, you find that the floor is about
a quarter of the way up the side of the van.  Not enough room, for me.
Rides okay, unless you load it up.

Chevy Astro (guess what my nickname is for THAT one!).  Similar to the
Aerostar, except that it looks dorky, rides lousy.  And how about the THREE
doors on the back option, so they could put a wiper on?  Wouldn't it have
been great if they had put FOUR back there, with a little dinky windshield
wiper on each back window?

As for the Datsuns (the &quot;Nissan&quot; Quest, the Merc Villager - Once a Datsun,
always a Datsun [yes, even those expensive Lazy 8s!]), the Windstar (or is
that Windsock? or Windstreak?), The Chevy Lumina (and its tupperware body
panel clones), and the Mopar Minis (I know what some of you gals and guys
call these!), and yes, the VW Sharan - Hey, these don't even COUNT.
They're all nothing more than stubby fat station wagons (formerly known as
Depot Hacks, my favorite auto model name).  And as for stupid windshields!
The Luminas take the prize!  That vehicle looks like the designer was
really fond of those silly hard rubber doorstops they used to use in my
elementary school.  Same shape (same material, for that matter).

Full-size american vans don't count either.  Pigs would be a better term.
I remember caravaning with a Dodge conversion van with the silly couches
and windows cut in the side THROUGH the molding (tightly clamped so as to
BEND the body panels) and high enough that if hit from the side, the rear
passengers are sure to wind up sharing space with the bugs on the car that
hit them.  We drove up the 2-laner to Mount Palomar.  I was driving my 67
Microbus with 7 girl scouts and camping gear, and the Dodge was similarly
loaded.  Thing had a 360 V8 and STILL couldn't keep up!  (my bus was stock,
but for a 1687cc displacement).  Had a 66 Dodge van.  Good mechanically,
but pretty much rattled to pieces.  Automatic transmission had too tall a
first gear, couldn't make that last grade up to Patriarch Grove in the
White Mtns, but the 67 Bus could, and it only had 1500cc's back then.  For
the most part, there hasn't been a significant technical improvement to the
full-size american van since the first Fords in 1961.  Well, alright, maybe
since they all moved their engines forward and put a beak on the front.
You'd be better off with a 1961 Microbus.  (I really believe that, too,
even though the 93 is my main drive these days). At least VW has pretty
much always understood how to gear a motor with limited horsepower.

Hope they bring the EV back soon, if for no other reason than to get some
more &quot;buddies&quot; on the list, but I wouldn't care that much if the V6 weren't
in it (though some of you say it will be, just hope they don't make the
nose bigger or put the engine in your lap to do it!).  The 5 does fine, at
least with the stick.
