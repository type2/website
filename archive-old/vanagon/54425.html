Subject: Re: Color Codes for 86 Westy Syncro. HELP!

When I first purchased my '91 Westy, I asked the dealership I have service
done at about the color. The parts man took me out to the Westy and showed
me a sticker that had all the code info on it. Best I can remember it was
either in the driver's door jam or up under the dash on the driver's side.

I would just go check for you, but since I no longer have it I can't do that!
I don't know if the Syncro is the same, but it's worth a check. As I remember
it is a numeric code.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm still in need of some help in finding the proper paint codes for my van.
&gt; Is there a sticker or plate somewhere on the van? I tried to search the
&gt; archives , but came up empty handed , my body man is attempting to assure me
&gt; that if I only bring in the van he can make a pretty good match !{I'd love
&gt; to trust him though it's my brother in-laws dealership and this could make
&gt; for some rather ugly family get togethers}
&gt; 
&gt; Kris Weber      HELP!!!
