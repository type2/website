&gt;Hello - since I'd last been on this list I noticed a thread re: big
&gt;hauls in vans. The week after my HS graduation in June 86 I drove a 66
&gt;bus from South Central PA (Chambersburg) to Dallas TX to just outside
&gt;Missoula MT to deliver a vintage Civil War cannon to its new owner.
&gt;THe cannon barrel, wheels, and carraige components weighed in at about
&gt;1800 lbs. + me (about 110lbs) + gear (about 60-70 lbs) --- REALLY
