Subject: F.S. 86 Westy Syncro  or 91 Westy 

Well the sad fact is that while having 2 Westy's at one time is a very
satisfying experince, having a succesful marriage is even more satisfying.
How'd that sound ? Convincing, I hope!!!    Anyway I need to sell one of the
2 I now own. !I have a 91 Westy that is as near perfect as you'll find.
71,000 miles , alloy wheels, a.c.  power windows door locks cd player etc.
The interior is mint and the outside is real nice. I'm asking 16,500 firm.
The other one is a 86 Westy Syncro that I've been listing for a few weeks
now, I'm down to $10,000, .It has working A.C., aux. battery , c.d. player,
lots of new stuff etc. The interior on this is also excellent, though like
many I'm missing the front table. Some of the usual seam rust , though all
in all it's a real nice Westy.
