Subject: That damn idle!

Hi All:

I seem to have a major vaccuum leak somewhere. I can pull off vacuum hoses
and there is no difference in adle. I pulled off the AFM/air box and
checked aroung the injectors. I tighened the bolts that hold the injection
unit to the head because one was a little loose. I tried the soapy water
trick but I could find no leaks. I am really getting down on my westy
because I can't get it to run even remotely smooth. I have to wait another
week to get looked at by my mechanic. I am desperate. I checked all the
stuff that everyone suggested last time. I hear a hissing noise but I'm not
sure if its coming from the fuel pump or from the top of the motor. Any
suggestions.
TIA
