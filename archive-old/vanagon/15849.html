So Martha Rubin sez:
&gt;
&gt;The campground I mentioned is Bodega Dunes, 1/2 mile north of
&gt;Bodega Bay on Highway One.  It's open all year, is at zero
&gt;elevation, and the basic nightly camping fee is $12-14, depending
&gt;on the season.  Reservations are through MISTIX, pet fee is $1.00,
&gt;and there are 98 tent/rv spaces, with a maximum rv length of 31'.
&gt;
&gt;Now for the GOOD part!  They have the following:
&gt;sanitary disposal station

[blah blah blah]

What is the surfing like?  

I'll try to contact my local camping/surfing guru...
