We are thinking gf having the van painted. To do this properly,
someone suggested that the chrome strips be removed and rope be used
to raise the rubber so paint can get underneath. I was going to do this, but
now do I understand you to
say that it will be impossible to put the chrome strips back in each of
the windows? Thanks - DC.

&gt; &gt; Pull off all the chromed metal bits and get them sand blasted clean then 
&gt; &gt; primered/painted. This works, friends BMW 3.0 looks very good this way. I'm 
&gt; &gt; not sure about removing the chrome plastic strip around the windshield, 
&gt; &gt; isn't this referred to as a 'locking strip'? BTW... the panel van I have 
&gt; 
&gt; According to a local windshield shop the Vanagon trim strip contributes
&gt; little if anything to locking the windshield in. But he claims they cannot
&gt; be installed/refittd with the glass in place, so it seems if you do take them
&gt; out...
