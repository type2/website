Subject:  Tire Sizes 

My understanding of tire sizes:

r75/185/14

Starting at the end:

14   -  14&quot; wheel
185  -  tred width in mm
r75  -  ratio of tire sidewall height to tread width
        IE: r85/185/14 is a very tall 185mm wide tire on a 14&quot; wheel 
            r55/205/16 is a very low profile 205mm wide tire on a 16&quot; wheel
        NOTE: Both would be about the same outside diameter?

What do I know?
