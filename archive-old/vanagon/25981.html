Subject: Failed Inspection: Leaky Headlight

     Well, the mighty Silver Syncro Westy had a little hickup.
     I FINALLY got the clear title from the Oregonians, and so
     next need to pass the dreaded Maryland inspection.

     Saturday, I did my own inspection. Replaced the license plate light,
     pulled the front wheels, etc. Everything seemed normal...
     except for the the drops of water on the lens of the left headlight.
     I popped the grill, removed the bulbs, and took a look. No obvious
     cracks for moisture to enter. Took the whole thing down to the
     basement, and set it on the nice warm, but not too hot water heater.
     A coupla hours later, the moisture is gone, and I confidently
     reassemble the puppy after allowing it to return to room temperature.

     The yesterday off to the inspection joint. Perfect, except for
     moisture in the left headlight lens. Failed. The guy says &quot;You don't
     wanna know what a new one costs.&quot; I already knew that I didn't want
     to know. I still don't.

     So my questions: There is no obvious damage.  We are talking some
     semi-serious moisture here, a tablespoon full or so, appearing as
     condensation covering a good bit of the lens. Turning on the headlight
     does not evaporate it at all. Is it possible for moisture to enter at
     the bulb-reflector joint? Should I try sealing the bulb with a thin
     layer of silicon - sounds dubious to me. Or send my wife out
     to the pick-it yourself junkyards, again...?
