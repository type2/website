Subject: rough pick-up from cold 84

I wish I could help with the rough running. Clogged or bad injector? 
(are 84's injected?)  Of all the things I've fixed on our '90 (almost 
everything) the engine's always run like a top- EXCEPT when the local 
FLAPS ran out of Bosch plugs and I put in a set of Autolite platinums.  
Within 4mos the van would almost die whenever we stepped on the gas. I 
pulled the plugs, the electrodes looked fine but the little tabs on 
the other end of the spark were almost burned off. I put in a set of 
Bosch platinums and it's run well ever since.(This is only the 4th set 
of plugs in about 150K miles).
