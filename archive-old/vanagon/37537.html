&gt; Last night I got a call from the service advisor. He had met with the VWoA
&gt; rep earlier in the week and told me that VWoA agreed to cover 100 percent
&gt; of the repairs! This includes fixing the leaky side and the non-leaky side

Excellent!  Unfortunately, more the exclusion rather than the norm.
