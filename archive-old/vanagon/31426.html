Something from the porsche list...

&gt; 
&gt; This story applies to all 914's, 912E's and others with high pressure 
&gt; fuel systems.
&gt; 
&gt; My son's '81 Vanagon with Ljet EFI has had a string of fuel leaks over 
&gt; the past months, and finally died.  The cheap Asian oil pressure gauge  
&gt; I had installed in the engine room to monitor fuel pressure even 
&gt; developed a leak and died before that.  
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I installed a good 0-80 psi gauge and started to find the  
&gt; trouble.  The gauge pegged at well over 120 psi!  
&gt; 
&gt; First I looked for a kinked fuel return line as we had tilted the 
&gt; engine to replace the clutch last summer, but it looked okay.  The fuel 
&gt; pressure regulator was the culprit.  It was frozen.  I have never seen 
&gt; one fail before, so naturally I didn't bring a spare the 350 miles from 
&gt; home.  After all, it's just a spring-loaded valve.  It makes me wonder 
&gt; if the corrosives in the &quot;oxygenated&quot; fuels aren't the culprit.
&gt; 
&gt; It didn't matter that a new one is pressure regulator is $80, because 
&gt; dealers don't stock them.  I found one in a pickyourpart yard for $5.
&gt; 
&gt; It is now my guess that the regulator was sticking sometimes before it 
&gt; died, causing the fuel leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a fuel pressure gauge in the dash of my '76 914 and one in the 
&gt; engine room of my '73 914.  One is going into the dash of each of my 
&gt; EFI cars right away.  Marshall's in Anaheim makes a nice 1 1/2&quot;  0-60 
&gt; psi mechanical gauge that I bought at a local bearing and racing supply 
&gt; house for my '76.  It cost $25, and has already saved that much in 
&gt; fuel, as the car ran fine, but I found when I installed the gauge that 
&gt; the pressure was 20% too high.
&gt;

&gt;     Every electrical failure is due to a mechanical problem.
