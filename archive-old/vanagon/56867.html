Subject: EV screens

speaking of EV's with screens, I finally got around to getting the door
screens for mine. They look pretty solid, but will require the installation
of many snaps around the doors to fasten them too. They come with all the
snaps attached to 1 inch screws. Some replace the existing screws in the
interior trim, but it looks like some require new holes. We'll see how long
it takes.

The rear screen has a zippered opening so that you can access the left panel;
the sliding door screen has a full-length zipper so you can get in/out.

oh yeah, the color is gray. big surprise.  and they're too damn expensive.
another big surprise.
