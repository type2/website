Yes I support J. Wakefield's suggestion for someone who is an expert
on oil filters to comment on the Fram product. I changed over to a Lee
filter which cost me only $1.99 compared to the $5.99 for Fram and the 
low oil pressure went away. I will be testing different brands at 2000
miles oil change and provide the results as I observe them.
The finer filter of the Fram which is supposed to offer greater 
filteration may be the cause. The point is what good is it if oil
pressure moves down low during idle after a sustained high speed
cruise.
