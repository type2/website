Subject: RE: Re:Vanagon Bake-Off~Nevada Race

Before anyone gets visions of dueling Vanagons, pedals floored, being
chased down the NJ Turnpike by a Corrado-powered Corrado with aircraft
landing lights and a live cellular video link to the Web, let me say that
I have too much respect for the work that goes into an engine conversion,
and for my driver's license, to play that game.

I do have fantasies of entering an autocross sometime, just for the 
&quot;dancing elephant&quot; fun of it.

Anyway, I'd just like to drive some other-engined Vgons around the block
and maybe down the highway a little at completely legal speeds.  If I
wanted to go really fast, I would have started with something shaped less
like a shipping crate.  I agree with whoever posted about the Corrado
supercharged engine's being maybe too peaky for Vgon use.  Our discus-
sions here reveal that the transmission problem is even harder to solve
than the engine problem, so you're stuck with just 4 gears.  You're not
going to be able to keep some hot little engine on the cam all the time.
And if you try, surly relatives in the third seat are going to shout,
&quot;Shift! Shift!&quot; in a way that pops your Mario Andretti bubble right away.
