Hi!,

	Last night I did a little work to the bus.

	I added 2 dome lights, one in the very back in the doorway of the
hatch, and the second in the doorway of the side doors.  I have one more
i'm gonna put in the engine compartment.

	As far as the brakes, I think it is the brake return springs.  I tried
to get them locally to no avail.  I ended up ordering a kit from Wolfsburg
West that has the springs, clips and cotter pins for $22.  Yikes!

	I tried using some springs I got at the FLAPS (NAPA) and they 
needed some engineering and helped a little to pull the shoes back, but not
enough...

	It also looks like there is a little bit of leakage around one of the
wheel cylinders now, so maybe the seal got munched when the piston blew out...
Hopefully I can find a seal kit or something for it...

Thom
