&gt; Hi Rich.  For the rear heater there is a 3 speed fan switch next to
&gt; the steering column on the right side.  This controls the fan speed
&gt; only.  Under the rear seat there is a valve that you can adjust for
&gt; warm, and warmer air.  It's quite efficient.  Move the lever to the
&gt; front of the van for maximum heat.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this help.

&gt; &gt; OK, so I have only had my '89 Westie for two days, but you'd think that by
&gt; &gt; now, having read the appropriate section of the manual numerous times, that
&gt; &gt; I'd be able to figure out the convoluted climate controls.  No such luck, so
&gt; &gt; I have a stupid question for those in the know:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First of all, my Vanagon has A/C but no auxiliary heater.  My question: How
&gt; &gt; the heck do I get heat to come out of vent under the back seat?  The heat up
&gt; &gt; front is just fine thank you, but those sitting in the back are finding
&gt; &gt; their feet to be a bit numb.

Or about an hour before you leave, start heating several large stones with a 
blowtorch......

I know Friday's around here somewhere.  ;-)
