Subject: battery light 

Hi all      glad that the list is back     
My 89 syncro has a problem     the battery light on the dash stays lit all
the time 
everything works fine  just the light stays on  
is it a warning that my alternator is going 
any ideas out there    it really runs great   I just don''t want to get
stranded 
and why do these things always happen on vacation week ????

MIKEY
