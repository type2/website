So Joel Walker says:
&gt; &gt;Okay Joel, you get the goats and I'll bring the chickens... ;P
&gt; 
&gt; nope. not me. *I*'ll get the chickens. my old man barbecued my pet goat when
&gt; i was very young. :(  &lt;never did forgive the old bastard for that!!&gt; and i
&gt; really hate chickens: every morning, before i trudged five miles, uphill, in
&gt; the snow and mud, to school, i had to go 'slop the chickens'. no lie. 3,000
&gt; layers. chickens are filthy, disgusting animals that have no redeeming
&gt; virtues whatsoever ... except that they fry up nice for supper. so i eat
&gt; eggs of all shapes, sizes, flavors, and forms; i eat chicken in any receipe
&gt; found ... cause every egg, and every chicken dish means ONE MORE DEAD CHICKEN!
&gt; :)  &lt;sorry. got carried away a little there&gt;

Well......as long as we're getting out-of-hand here.  I'd can now say,
since you're bringin' the chickens, then I'll bring the wine since my
dad owned a 20 acre vineyard which he enjoyed having his kids working
in where he could keep an eye on us.  Ever seen a bee drunk?  I have.
When the grapes die on the vine they ferment.  The bees love it.  Then
the kinda sway back and forth hovering over the ground.  It's pretty
funny to see.

Anyway.  Your right.  Not everyone has access.  So will sell the books
at $100.00 a pop.  Sounds fair don't it? ;)  I thought so.  We could
also do video tapes too.  Where's that lawyer Ric?  I'm sure he'll need
to write up some legalese papers for all of this.

&gt; ha! grits. only good for stuffing dead chickens.

Good one!  ;D
