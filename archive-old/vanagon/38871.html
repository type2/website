&gt;&gt;Amphibious four wheel drive (and propeller driven in water) Kubelwagen
&gt;&gt;derivative.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Darned cool.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Vot ischt dis &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Talked with a Schwimmer driver once, old WWII German guy living in a
&gt;splittie bus in the Spanish Pyrenees Mtns.  He said they were terrifying to 

&gt;'drive' in the ocean, he had been in Greece in the war.  Wave would rush
&gt;towards the Schwim., tower overhead, and at the last second the vehicle
&gt;would bob up the face of the wave then surf/plow down the backside.  Said 
it
&gt;scared him everytime he went in the water.  Probably great in lakes/rivers

There are a lot of actual boats that aren't safe in large waves. I'd NEVER
take any sort of &quot;Amphibious&quot; vehicle into such, or even into rivers with
any flow rate to them.

Doesn't the Bradley Fighting Vehicle have a reputation, if you drive too
quickly down a riverbank into the water, that they just keep right on
going down?
