Subject: re: more www sites


Since i'm not really hip to the WWW groove, I can't help out on that 
front, however, I have found the same Technical Service Bulletin list at 
the Alldata corporation gopher.  I found this under the &quot;Gophers of the 
World&quot; list on our gopher server.  I don't know if this is a universal 
phenomena.  The Alldata people say that their gopher address is  
gopher.alldata.tsb_dot_com
