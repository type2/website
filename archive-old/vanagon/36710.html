Subject: re: '86 on driving lights - 100w

Has anyone replaced the 50W bulb in the square high beam
driving lights with a 100W bulb?

any signs of amperage overload on the wiring?

was the light output difference noticable?

do they take an H1 bulb?

Dan,

I tried the 100w on my Jetta which uses the same bulbs. Even with a 
relay for the 100w circuit, I melted two sets of bulb connectors 
before I finally gave up. I now have replaced the stock connectors with 
insulated spade-type terminals on each wire, which are tricky to plug 
in but seem to work. Soon afterwards, both the 100w bulbs burnt out, 
and I replaced with stock 55/65w, so I can't say of the spade 
connectors would've lasted. I choose to add separate H3 driving 
lights instead, and used the old relay to wire them into the high 
beam circuit - works great. (and anyone who forgets to dim their 
lights *will* regret it!)

The molded factory bulb connectors are the main problem here - they 
don't seem to dissipate enough heat for the 100w bulbs.

Shawn.
