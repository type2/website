Subject: VW ads

     I just returned this book (overdue, oops) to the library.  Good stuff
     &quot;Think Small&quot; by Frank Rowsome.  Gives the stories and copies of the 
     ads that we all love.
     
     Also just finished &quot;Still Life With Volkwagens&quot;.  A very quick, 
     thoughtful, and amusing read.  The author's definately &quot;been there&quot;!
     
     No snow but a chilly 19F here in sunny central Florida today.  At 
     least I don't have to worry about frozen engine fluids!! ;^)
