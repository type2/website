Hi again,

Earlier today I inquired about engine substitutions for type 2s. Since
then, I received reports from people who actually did install Porsche 911
(six cylinder) engines. That's great news! So let me ask a few more
questions:

1. what about the transmission? Is the bus' gear ratio suitable? Can the
transmission also be replaced by the Porsche's 5 or 6-speed gear box?

2. Is the 6-cylinder engine significantly heavier than the original 4?
If so, should the shock absorbers be replaced by stronger ones?

3. I spent many years in Germany and heard (second-hand) about someone who
wanted to &quot;upgrade&quot; his old Ford by replacing the 4-cylinder (1.7liter)
engine with a V8. That attempt failed because he needed the approval of
the &quot;technische Ueberpruefungsverein&quot; (tuv), i.e., the inspection
bureaucracy. Not only would he have had to pay higher insurance
premiums, but they also demanded that he also put in bigger breaks. I
don't suppose there would be similar problems in the US? Do insurance
companies care? Does the EPA? (just kidding!)
