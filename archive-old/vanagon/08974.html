So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; (methinks Gerry has selective coding in his total routine!!! :)  hey! it
&gt; could happen!)
&gt; 
&gt; well, anyway. for better or worse, here are the top 25:
&gt; 
&gt; JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu                                940
&gt; SJOHNSON_at_PCOCD2.INTEL.COM                           413
I would have thought Ric would've passed me by now, but it's easy to be
fooled because I'm on the vintage list too and I see him there alot.

&gt; DCARMENT_at_CCS.CARLETON.CA                            328
&gt; RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu                                   310
&gt; GSKER                                               303
&gt; nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu                            244
&gt; 
&gt; 191 out of 234 have posted something to the list. which is a lot more
&gt; participation that i had thought. :)  of course, there do seem to be
&gt; a bit of motor-mouthing by a very few ...

Sounds like the kettle callin' the pot black!  ;)
