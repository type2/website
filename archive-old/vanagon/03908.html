Subject: Re: Front end heat &amp; awnings


&gt;2.  I live in the Pacific Northwest (Olympia, WA, to be exact). Is there 
&gt;a dealer up here that sells awnings designed for vw campers or similar?
&gt;Replys by e-mail best as I'd guess these aren't new questions.
&gt;Thanks

I can't speak for the States, but I'm pretty sure you can find this.  I have
a Norseman awning, the model is Norseman Apollo.  The awning rolls out of a
case which attaches to the gutter.  When fully extended, the end is
supported by poles which attach to sockets on the side of the van, or the
poles can be stood vertically on the ground, and held stationary with pegs.
I'm really happy with it.  For reference, I live just outside of Victoria,
B.C.  The last time I went shopping at the local grocery store, I counted
nine other Vanagons in the parking lot.  I didn't notice the number of
awnings, but I get the impression that many people have the Norseman Apollo.
It was about $650Canadian a few years ago, I believe.  Try any RV place,
because these are made for all kinds of RV's.
