Subject: Re: Cheap places to camp

&gt;I was wondering if there are any other road trippers without money out
&gt;there?  If there are, where do you camp for the night while you are on the
&gt;road?  Rest Stops?  How much is a state park per night out west?  How much
&gt;are national parks?  Are there any other options?  Can I write anything but
&gt;questions?
&gt;
&gt;T'anks 
&gt;
I understand that WalMart stores likes (!!!) to have you spend the night in 
their parking lots.  It offers them security, and you a place to stay.  
Worked for us last April.
