Subject: Does your vanagon rust from the inside?
Date: Thu, 10 Aug 95 13:37:25 EDT

Yesterday, when fixing what I though were some minor spots of surface
rust, I got an unpleasant surprise: In two areas the vanagon body had
rusted completely through from the INSIDE and out. This was on an
otherwise rust free vehicle.

The two places are below the lower front grille, and under the
three hookup covers (This is an 82 Westy diesel). In both cases the 
cause appears to be that water has entered from the outside, and got 
trapped between the body sheet metal and a supporting crossmember. 
Eventually the sheet metal rusted through, and small bubbles started 
to appear under the paint.

I removed the hookup covers and repared the rusted area under them with 
fiber glass and resin. When I put the covers back I plan to seal them
with silicone. 

I couldn't get the lower grille out to fix the rust under it, and access
from under the car is limited. I tried to pull the grille, and push from
behind on the &quot;snap in&quot; plastic pieces, but nothing would make it move.
Do I have to drill out the fasteners, or is there some other trick
to get the grille out?

Is rust from the inside common in these two areas on the vanagons?
