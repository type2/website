Subject: Re: water pump for 76 Westy

&gt; David suggests:
&gt; &gt;Windshield washer pumps are notorious for corroded connections and the 
&gt; &gt;setup for the water pump is similar...you might even find a washer
&gt; &gt;pump as a substitute. DC
&gt; 

Personally I think the flow would be too low/slow.  The pump on my van has about
a 1/2&quot; port on it, while the wiper pump is probably half that.

Your mileage may vary tho.
