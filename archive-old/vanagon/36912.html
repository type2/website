&gt;     Does anyone have any brilliant ideas about how to disassemble the 
&gt;     pop-out back window frames on my '65 bus. I'm wanting to replace the 
&gt;     rubbers and noticed that there's outer and inner and in-between rubbers 
&gt;     in the catalog - but how do you get the frame apart??

The popouts are held together by 2 sets of straight-slot screws, located
near the seams.

Cut the old outer rubber off, exposing the screws.  Liquid wrench them
if necessary.  Undo them, and the seams separate to release the glass
and disassemble the frame.

The inner rubber wraps around the glass, lube it with dish soap and slide
it back into the frame, and re-install the screws.  Use more dish soap and
a popsicle stick to installe the outer seal, paying attention that the
ledge goes to the outside of the bus.

Finally, glue the new body/window seal on.
