Subject: 85 Westy questions

BeyondMail Form: Message
Text: 
Hi folks, just bought an 85 Westy and have gone through the intial clean-up 
and check-if-everything-works. I've checked the archives and still have a 
few questions.

1. The refrigerator doesn't work on 120V. It is plugged in and there is 
power in the plug. I havn't tried 12V or propane yet. The PO hadn't used 
the fridge in 4 years. Is there anything else to check before heading to 
the RV shop?

2.The clutch grabs right near the top of petal travel. Is there a place to 
adjust this or does this mean a new clutch?

3. I have no idea how the auxilliary heater should work. When I depress it 
and turn it clockwise it sounds like a camera timer but without any heat. 
The bulb doesn't light up either.
Any ideas????? 

Any help would be appreciated....another Harry (Winnipeg).
