Subject: info on crossing into Canada...


R. A. &quot;Pete&quot; Sellers of our list kindly forwarded me information
regarding crossing borders.  Although he says he has never personally
had a problem with it, it would be wise for us to heed the advice,
and be prepared for eventualaties.  Following is a copy of his info
(thanks Pete!):

I've driven into anf from Canada several times and it is BEST to have
proof of vehicle ownership, registration and sufficient insuracne to cover
you (the driver) and the vehicle according to Canadian standards.

Most insurance companies are aware of this and will provide certification
upon request (if it is not already stated in your policy).

Vehicle ownership and registration is merely a verbal inquiry by the
Customs Official upon entry.  If there is any doubt in that official's
mind however, you'd better have documentation to back up your statement of
ownership or registration.
