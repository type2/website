Subject: Dodge Caravan Owners' Club

There is no subject Internet group for the same reason there's no Kenmore
dishwasher group.  People buy most cars as appliances, and consider us strange
for having any more connection with our cars.  I don't see Caravan/Voyager's
success as a fad, likely to fade out from commonality, any more than microwave
ovens are, as long as Chrysler builds a competent appliance.  I tried to get
more out of one:  Special ordered a 5speed, 140hp Turbo 4, airco, HD suspen-
sion, no other options.  Saved over $1000 by putting in sunroof, window tint,
and cruise control myself.  Not a bad car; very nice in 5th gear on highway.
Sold it as soon as the 70k miles got close -- would not want to own an aging
Chrysler turbo.  What was missing?

Sources of aftermarket parts, cachet, evidence that it would hold its value,
Vanagon driving position, applicability of my aircooled engine experience.
Also about that time my fever to put a Porsche engine in a Vanagon, which
started with an article in DB&amp;HVW probably 20years ago, was already getting
serious.
