         Tales of the Workshop
         by Robert W. Service-Advisor

         The Voltage Regulator

It was late, he was tired, and the light was now fading,
As the darkness was growing in the shadows' deep shading,
The work wasn't going as well as expected
So his spirits were down, he was feeling dejected,

And the shortcuts he'd taken, although he knew better,
Were quicker than following rules to the letter.
A new regulator, to make headlights brighter,
A simple replacement: screws loosened, then tighter.

A slip of the fingers, and down it was dropped,
It hit on the chassis, and there it was stopped,
A spark, bright as lightening; then, to his surprise,
That great big red wire disappeared fore his eyes.

At first it just glowed, then got brighter and brighter,
As a part of his body grew tighter and tighter.
It was gone in a second, a foul puff of smoke,
Replaced by that feeling that something just broke!

So let this be warning, as you work on your bus,
Before clumsy wrenching gives reason to cuss:
If electric repairs are what you've selected,
Make the battery always be first disconnected!
