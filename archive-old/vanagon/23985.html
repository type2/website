Subject: Re: '61 crew cab value


&gt;what year is the bubbe window? i'd say that their prices sounds a wee bit
&gt;steep but not that far out of line. double cabs in good shape (with
&gt;straight gates !!!) are pretty hard to come by, both split window busses
&gt;and bubble window

Sorry, forgot to mention that this is a 1961 with split and hinged
windshield sections.  All gates appear to be straight and hardware looks
good.  I'll be getting a report from the mechanic about over-all condition
after he is done with it.
