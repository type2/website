Subject:      Exhaust Alingment ?

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,

       I replaced some exhaust system components recently and now I have a
     nagging small exhaust leak.  The problem is where the right and left
     side exhaust pipes from each head come together at a flange into one
     pipe that goes to the Cat. and muffler.  At this joint, I can only get
     two of the three flanges flush.  The side that leaks seems to have a
     larger gap on the inner side because all three flanges are not
     parallel.
       Is there a trick to getting all flanges parallel?  I hope I don't
     have to replace the exhaust gaskets at the heads to get things into
     alignment as the bolts look hard to get at and are mighty rusty.  Any
     advice would be appreciated.

     TIA,

     Vince.
