Subject: Need '85 Heater Core

Hello list, dropping back in for a while, hoping to get the farvergwagon back
into fighting shape.

Looking for a rear heater core (also probably need front).  VW wants $150 for
a new one (the valve is ok, so core only).  Anybody got a line on a
reasonably priced one of these?  I don't think I want a used one, unless it
is a newer used one, as all the ones I see in Junk yards seem to be leaking.
 

Please email directly, as my aol account seems to truncate the digest mode
document on its way in.

Also, my bently does not have the section on Wasserboxer heaters. Anybody
have one that they can xerox for me?

And, if you're still reading, Are there any weak points in the cooling system
that could account for my small loss of coolant, other than the leaky cores
and a possible bad head gasket?  I get a smell of coolant when the front
heater is on, but am not seeing any drips on the pavement.  Seems to use
about a pint every 300 miles or so.  This has been going on for 4 months.

Thanks,
Peter
