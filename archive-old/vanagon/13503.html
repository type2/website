Subject: Re: one more stupid question

&gt;I am curious if my old Bettle towbar will work to tow a bus ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;thanks,

No, but you can make it work by lenghtening the tubes the extend to the axel
clamp ons.

Why they make bug tow bars and not bus tow bars I don't know, probably
because there are more bugs than buses.
