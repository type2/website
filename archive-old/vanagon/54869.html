Subject: Battery light staying on till I hit the gas?

I think I have a problem with my battery? I did a lot of camping this
summer with out newly built vanagon panel camper. I installed on eof those
electric cooler thing in my van. We put about 60,000 Km on our van and ran
the fridge alot this summer, even when the van was off. Now the battery
light stay's on when I start the van until I I bring the rpm to about 2000.
The heater and headlights also run very dim until I do rav the engine a
bit. I have no problems starting the van but would like to find out why my
van is doing this.

Thanx
