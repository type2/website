&gt;Then, on the same day, Someone Else said:
&gt;&gt;I've got Uncle Joel beat.  I change the fluid in my 911 and my bus
&gt;&gt;(when running) about every 6 months.
&gt;
&gt;any particular reason? i've wondered about changing the transmission fluid
&gt;every year, but decided that with so many cars still running around that have
&gt;NEVER changed their tranny oil, it would be ok to continue at every two years.
&gt;i'm almost paranoid enough to change brake fluid and coolant at one year
&gt;(instead of two) ... almost. not quite. :)

I probably don't really _need_ to di it, but I feel better about making 
sure all of the little metal particles are out.  The tranny also leaks,
so if I have to crawl under there to top it off anyway....  But then agian
I change the engine oil about every other month, 2 months tops.  I figure
the cash I spend on oil changes is easier to scrounge up than the cash 
it would take to rebuild my engine (my daily driver is a 911 targa)
