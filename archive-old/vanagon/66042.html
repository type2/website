BFGoodrich and Interco Super Swamper both make all-terrain tires in the
14&quot; size.  the BFG tires are 27x8.5R14 and the SuperSwampers are
28x8.5(R)14(not shure if they are radials).

i am currently running BFG Radial All-Terrain tires and they get my 2wd
van going in up to 7.5 inches of snow. after that, the car just gets
high-centered on the snow and won't move anywhere without help.

hope you decide to go with the BFG tires but Dunlops aren't too bad.
