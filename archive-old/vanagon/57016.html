I just did some Conusmers Reports and Import mechanic research on the 
Mazda MPV van.  Talked to a former Mazda mech for 13 years.  They 
all agree that the MPV along with all the American minivans, they are 
junk.  The MPV's heads fall apart at about 30K, an generally not 
reliabble.  We'd been contemplating the MPV for SO kid hauling, 
not anymore, after that research.  Wife hates the Toy, and doesn't 
like the Vanagon, too big!  I can keep my '80 Westi though, whew.

It is nice to finally have a report that includes the Vanagon at all!  
Just a few years too late, that's all.  Too big to be called a minivan, 
and too small to include with the full size vans.   
They usually don't have a clue.

So with my additional research, I conclude that the Vanagon is the one!

Amazing, that two consumer oriented groups come to such different 
conclusions on the same vehicle (MPV).  The point, do lots of 
research, talk to lots of people, get involved with insiders, such as this 
list.  Sure the Vanagon has it's own set of problems, but with a 
resource as this, they can be licked.

&gt;&gt;                      spot in its class with the Volkswagen Vanagon, finished
&gt;&gt; ahead of such competitors as the Dodge
&gt;&gt;                      Caravan, Ford Aerostar and Plymouth Voyager.

&gt;I LOVE this statement!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;                      &quot;We've known for years that the MPV was a solid,
&gt;&gt; dependable vehicle,&quot; said George McCabe,
&gt;&gt;                      senior vice president and general manager of MMA.
&gt;&gt; &quot;Still, it is encouraging to have this
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;                      Since its introduction as a 1989 model, Mazda has sold
&gt;&gt; more than 225,000 MPVs in the United
&gt;&gt;                      States, the vast majority of which are still on the road. 
&gt;&gt;Interesting that an equal statement was not made about the Vanagon....
