&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, I had forgotten there was a Vancouver in Washington, but the
&gt; one I meant was Vancouver, CANADA!  If somebody really wants it
&gt; 

	Yeah, it's easy to forget there's a Vancouver WA. :-) 'Taint quite
	like Vanc. B.C..

	ASI is on 4th Plain Road in Vancouver Wa. (Vancouver USA, the nimrods
	around here like to call it) Coincidently, my shack is a few houses
	from 4th Plain.

	They're still in business, but in the business of specialty auto 
	imports.

&gt; 
	I'll give'em a ring tomorrow and ask what they still support.
