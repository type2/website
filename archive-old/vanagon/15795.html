Subject: Re: Manassas (sp?) VA show still around ??

&gt;Bart   &lt;bwinelan_at_alleg_dot_edu&gt; asks:

&gt;Although I never went to it I remember hearing of a VW swap and  
&gt;show in Manassas VA that was one of the bigger ones on the east  
&gt;coast.  Is it still around ?
&gt;thanks,


You betcha!
Held on Memorial day Sunday (Labor day too!)
It's a great time!  I try to make it every year.
They have a dragstrip , an asphalt oval for the slalom, show bugs,
classic bugs,
water cooled vws, venders, and of course, the Miss (and Mr.) Bugout contest.
