&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; &gt;     I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while
&gt;&gt; &gt; going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep? =8A=8A=8A=8A=
=8A=8A=8A=8A=8A=8A=8A=8A


Wellllll=8A   I sleep with my BACK against the hanging closet and with an AX
under my pillow.

L.
