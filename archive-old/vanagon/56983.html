 I think it means you can sleep in it from 4-6.  AM or PM?  I don't know?  ;)

yeah, I guess you'd be too exited from getting such a good deal on a '90
westy to actually fall asleep before 4 am... and then wake up at 6 am to
pinch yourself to see that it wasn't all just a dream..... :&lt;)

boy IF this was on the T2 list you'd be hearing &quot;kill this thread&quot; right
about now from u-no-hoo.....
