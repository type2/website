&gt; &gt;I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
&gt; &gt;fit in my '79 Bust.  If it would fit, is it a bolt up, plug in the Bus FI
&gt; &gt;stuff and go job or something worse.  The guy says 'Runs well, $250.'  Is
&gt; &gt;this a good idea or should I invest $250 in the motor I currently have.  I

Ummm... I think $750 would be a bare minimum to rebuild his engine.
Probably $9-1200, based on my experience, but I guess it depends on your
definition of &quot;rebuilt&quot;.  Not counting labor costs, of course, which
would be &quot;free&quot; if you do it yourself.

There are only a couple of differences between the Porsche 1.7 and the
VW 1.7.  I believe the intake manifolds only have three studs per side,
the oil breather, oil filler tube (and the dipstick?) are in a different
location too.  Then there is the problem of your '79 exhaust which is
the &quot;vanagon&quot; style and will only mate to the heads for '79-on engines
with rectangular exhaust ports.  I don't think the 1.7L 914 engine has
those.
