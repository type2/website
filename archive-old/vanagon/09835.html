&gt; Mr. Swartze - do you have a white falia?  I passed one
&gt; around 14:00 on hwy 101 and it looked like it was
&gt; someone that had hust been camping (it was loaded up
&gt; with stuff).  

Nope, mine is a dirty blue bubble top.  There was a white westy about
30 miles South of Big Sur though, parked on the west side of the road.
It was parked in front of some sort of clinic and there was a guy
standing there with a sign that said &quot;This clinic kills animals!&quot; or
something to that effect.  I'm sure the van was his, and I saw him
in the exact spot on the way up too, so he was apparently living in
the van.  Maybe he was who you saw?  

		Also I passed approx 10 VW vans on the way
&gt; up 101 and gave the thumbs up to each one as we passed.
&gt; NOT ONE PERSON RESPONDED OR EITHER DIDN&quot;T NOTICE MY
&gt; FALIA HEADING THE OTHER PASSED THEM.  These people shouldn't
&gt; be allowed to have VW VANS.

Dude!  It's not a thumbs up, but a wave!  You know, you have both hands
on the wheel and you just raise the fingers up on the hand closest to
the front of the van and kinda balance your wrist on the wheel and look
the other person in the eye!  Raising your hand off of the wheel and
smiling are okay too if you are so inclined.  I had about a 50/50
experience on 101, with the following observations:  EVERYONE in a split
waved.  SOME of those in breadloaves waved.  FEW in bricks waved.  :(
