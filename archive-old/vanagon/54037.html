Subject: Re: Gotta buy snow chains....

If you are going real chain chains (not cable chains), make sure the side
links which form the T between the cross links and the long chains (what are
those links called?) are made of hefty gauge o the material. I spent one
night repair a set of chains from Sears that kept breaking as my dad tried
to get his car up the hill in front of his house in Seattle during that last
storm.... Take chains off, rebend and pinch link that opened, put chains back
on, watch dad break them after making it another 10 feet or so, watch dad
roll down the hill, take them off, rebend and pinch link, yell at dad, put
chains on, watch dad....
