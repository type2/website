Subject: Bad temp sensor?

I want to thank everyone on the list who provided me with information. 
I disconnected all of the senor leads one at a time, cleaned the
connectors and reconnected them.  Now it decides it wants to run OK. 
Still a little rich, but no smoke.  Eventually, I guess, I'll have to
get the entire system checked out, but for now at least I'm not afoot. 
Thanks again, &quot;Peewee&quot; and I appreciate it. Chaz
