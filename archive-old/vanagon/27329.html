I'm kinda surprised Ron was one of the only people to express concern 
about the morality of cheating emissions testing.  I asked because I've 
heard quite a few people talking about it, and I was frankly skeptical 
whether it actually worked, or was simply an Urban Legend.  

I cheated once a few years ago after our well-tuned old econo-box failed 
by a squeaker, and got it to pass by rechecking the function of the car 
(and changing nothing substantial) and adding methyl hydrate to the 
fuel.  It passed, but I've since heard that there's typically so much 
random variation in test results that I probably could have just driven 
to the end of the line and passed 10 minutes later without changing 
anything.  BTW, I felt so bad about my environmentally irresponsible 
behavior that I won't try to do something so selfish again.  And I've 
been able to pass both our vehicles in all testing since by tuning carefully 
and running premium gas, and no cheating.

There are a lot of problems and stupid regulations surrounding emissions 
testing in B.C., but here it all comes down to the sniffer test, so 
engine mods are just fine, as long as your vehicle meets the emissions 
standards for the year it was manufactured.  What burns ME is gov't is 
trying to clean our air through emissions testing for cars rather than 
addressing the real problem, which is a total failure to address the 
issue of a workable, sustainable, long-term transportation policy.  
Cleaner-burning (but still substantially polluting, and I'm not just 
talkin' air, folks) single occupant vehicles, and more of them every 
year, ain't gonna solve any problems.  Looking at it that way, relying on 
emissions testing for passenger cars to solve our air quality problems 
is... stupid.  (I could use stronger words, but this is a family-oriented 
list.  :-)  )

Someone mentioned how testing measures percentage pollutants rather than 
absolute amounts of yucky stuff, and how this seemed odd.  I don't know 
if 4x4 poseurs in shiny LandCruisers are taking over the streets in 
cities elsewhere the same way they're growing here, but it seems that 1/4 
of all the passenger cars in Vancouver are 4x4s and other truck-type 
things.  These 4x4s are used as daily drivers here, most never even get 
driven on gravel roads, and you they pass emissions just fine, because 
the tests measure percentage!  So in this sense, emissions testing isn't 
promoting less-polluting cars, just cleaner-burning ones.  The latter is 
nice, but the former is what we really need if emissions testing is to be 
effective.  I drive my bus on weekends, on longer trips, but drive my 
econo-box for work--when I have to drive, and can't take a bus or walk.  
Eco-freakiness aside, I couldn't afford the gas for a 20 mpg daily driver!  
 
Whew!  I feel better now (pant, pant, pant...).  :-)
