Vell now !!!!! ...

here's my contribution to massive reading for the summer. This is a long document.

It will take a while to get through completely (if you really care to do that)!!!

David -
	 Thanks for the idea, cooperation, support and mutual participation.
	I wouldn't have missed it for the world!!!

For members on the list -

	I openly envious of the closeness, support and cooperation provided to
	David by those, principly in the in the West (they REALLY support one of
	their own).

I wonder what it will take to get that kind of enthusiasm in other parts of the 
country!!! ;)

Thoughts, Comments &amp; Notes Enroute

Living in the Washington, DC area; having to observe, hear about and `live with' the 
actions of bureaucrats, governments and varying degrees of competence, It's easy to 
get both a different and a narrowed perspective of this land and the people in it.

I expect some who read this may make a similar journey while others who see this 
may never want to attempt such a journey like this.

Now that it's over, I've had time to let the dust settle and most of the `road sores' have 
healed,  I look back and realize I had a wonderful memory that I hope to keep. I doubt, 
however, I doubt I will ever make a trip of this magnitude again!

I'd strongly recommend you take a trip like ours.

Get out of your familiar geography &amp; the environment where you spend the majority 
of your months. It's a great world out there but you have to stop and smell the Roses 
to appreciate it!

My prime point of contact for planning and coordinating was David and I believe he 
did a masterful job of planning &amp; coordinating.

As with every experience, there are things to be learned and applied ...next time.

If I need to plan similar trips in the future, I'll plan specific times-of-each-day (a range 
of hours) to start, a specified target destination for the day, several potential stops 
enroute, a target-maximum travel distance, with a specific, alternative daily 
destination (or two) and an agreed-upon stopping time for each day.

Many of the `mis-cues' we experienced related to compensating for communication 
and trying to adjust for individual preferences.

The  traveling entourage varied from a single vehicle to a high of five vehicles.


Road Report

I claim and openly admit to being a pack-rat; an interesting circumstance allowed me 
to be recognized by acclimation a the champion pack-rat (explained below).

Departed Lorton, VA through DC's METRO area, transited the Rockville &amp; Frederick 
&amp; Hagerstown, MD communities.

I remember travels across the PA turnpike; Interstate 68 is a more pleasurable route
(and it's free).

A short visit in West Virginia then Ohio. I used to think that travel across Ohio was 
the longest and most boring trek one could travel; that was before I experienced the 
Western States (more later).

 Through Columbus, OH, Indianapolis and Effingham. IL then onto Saint Louis, MO.

In Saint Louis, I joined other Volkswagen van Owners for a most enthusiastic event, 
Busses By The Arch (BBTA).. The turn out was about 60 vehicles with about 126 
people present.

For the first time, I met members of the VANAGON list with whom I'd been 
corresponding over the Internet. It was there that I met Joel, Sami &amp; Maria, David &amp; 
Shelley &amp; Jerry (our list-serve administrator), Lorin &amp; children.

Among the notable participants at BBTA, was a large contingent from Texas (approx. 
13 vehicles with 23 people).

There also was a rather young(ish) group who opted to conduct experiments in
physics and environmental science (they demonstrated what would happen and the 
effect of placing cans of tuna into open fires; they repeated the demonstrations 
numerous times, all BBTA participants were aware of this group).

As part of the planning for the trip, my SO, (Rose) would join me in Saint Louis; she 
interrupted an extended business trip (we were not really sure how long she would be 
able to stay with me). I had to bring equipment &amp; supplies for a three-week journey,
my personal clothing, clothing for Rose, and, we had discussed me bringing a items 
Rose would like to have with for the remainder of her business trip.

Additionally, I had scanned weather reports. There were widely varying conditions 
intermingled throughout the route. I packed sufficient clothing for the two of us (hot, 
warm and cold attire). By the time I arrived at BBTA in Saint Louis, I looked like I 
was making a permanent relocation.

My voluminous arrival was humorously noted by many in attendance.

At BBTA, we enjoyed heavy rain, and warm temperatures. Unfortunately, the site 
where we parked was low and soft. By the second day, we were parked in a quagmire. 
The water's natural flow collected underneath our site; we suffered the conversion of 
our dry clothing &amp; equipment to mud-caked, as well as the sympathetic humor of 
other attendees.

There were recognition awards for categories at BBTA, based on certain categories of 
vehicle, equipment and driving characteristics.. David was recognized for driving the 
longest distance (my 1,009 mile trek, at this point, was only fourth longest).

Strangely, Eurovans (there were three in attendance) were barely acknowledged as 
being in the Volkswagen family. There was no specific category nor any comfortable 
manner to group the Eurovan into another category for award consideration.

I guess we Eurovan owners/operators need to let the world know we're here to stay! :)

After more socializing and a meal (Chef Boy-R-Pete at the grill) or two at BBTA, the 
VANAGON members departed with five vehicles heading north. Several participants 
made stops in various places; we agreed to meet near Fairport, Iowa. After another 
day of convoy travel, Joel had to break off &amp; head back to Alabama. Mike White
joined our travel group for a day and a night.

Somewhere between Decorah, Iowa and Minnesota we visited a cave, had a meal and 
split into two groups. Mike, Gerry, Lorin &amp; children, and Sami &amp; Maria headed north 
into Minnesota; Rose &amp; Pete and David &amp; Shelley went west to continue GNATT.

Our long (and lone) trek began to show some personality differences.

The two vehicles moved west, into South Dakota. We stopped at Wall Drug then drove 
through the Badlands (wonderful places to visit).

The vehicles and couples then split temporarily. Rose &amp; Pete went through Wyoming 
(Devils Tower) and into Ten Sleep &amp; Ten Sleep Canyon. The community is a great 
place to visit.

The Wyoming roads offered me a opportunity for speed and motion like I've never had 
before, in the Eurovan (Autobahn-style driving). :) :) :)
And probably never will again!!

The roads in that area of Wyoming are flat, straight and open. I could get the Eurovan 
up to unimaginable speeds and then set the cruise. I enjoyed the thrill (imagine 5,600 
lbs. in a Eurovan moving at speeds up to 95 MPH ... in cruise-control).

It was like taking a whale from a small river and placing it in the middle of an ocean 
with no restrictions or danger of bumping into anything. Wow!!!!!

We visited The Chief Crazy Horse Monument and Mount Rushmore.
(For future trips, I like to go back to Crazy Horse; there is a Volks-March the first 
weekend in June every year).

Next, onto Cody Wyoming, &amp; Yellowstone National Park (Old Faithful, et al).

Recall I mentioned taking a lot of clothing? Temperatures got so cold we were back in 
winter attire; we actually encountered 5-7 foot snow drifts.

We met a local family who graciously gave us an intimate tour of Yellowstone and the 
environs; we saw herds of buffalo (many had newborns and were nursing) and other 
large wildlife. The residents mentioned that we saw unusually large clusters of 
animals all over the park.

Rose &amp; I then moved on to Bozeman, MT, where we went separate ways (Rose had to 
return to work).

Moving alone, I went into the Flathead Indian Reservation and onward to Glacier 
National Park/International Peace Park. I met David &amp; Shelly again (while I waited 
for them, I explored more of the territory). We were in an area with an average annual
snowfall of 60 feet (quite exciting)!!!

We planned to travel the `Road-To-The-Sky' but it was closed due to heavy residual 
snow; we had to travel around the Glacier Park.

Moving into Canada, with a stop at Fort Macleod where we got to explore a replica of 
an original fort of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (sometimes called the North 
West Mounted Police).

An unexpected surprise was an early-morning warning; the river near our  
campground was spilling over its banks and we needed to move &quot;within the hour&quot;.

By the time we got to the highway we saw the highway had also been flooded; we had 
to take a circuitous detour. Onward ...  to Calgary, Alberta.

The two vehicles' separate after Calgary (Pete went shopping for 'toys') !

After a brief tour of the city/community, I moved into Banff, the Banff National Park. 
Banff is very obviously a major tourist attraction (but it's worth it)!!!

Nowhere in my travels have I seen a city where I could stand in the middle of main 
street, look up &amp; around, to all sides, and be intimidated by towering, raw mountain 
ranges. I can't sufficiently give respect to the view here; what I saw in Banff is 
awesome.

I moved west, into British Columbia's Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass. I was 
impressed by the Rockies in the United States but the US Rockies can't hold a candle 
to the Canadian Rockies. The view took my breath away!

Onward, through Revelstoke and Kamloops (cellular telephone and CB radio helped 
here). I rejoined David &amp; Shelley for further movement.

We drove into a town called Hope and camped for the evening. I was up early the next 
morning and explored the town. Interestingly, Hope is the town where &quot;Sly&quot; Stallone's 
&quot;Rambo-First Blood&quot; was filmed; the town is openly proud of that; there's  visitor/ 
promotion tour of the various sites used. Additionally, Hope is the (chainsaw) 
wood-carving capitol of the world; there are numerous exquisite examples of the craft 
on display.

We moved into Vancouver where we met with Tobin &amp; Christa and other participants 
on the VANAGON list. We shared pizza &amp;  camaraderie (thanks much to Tobin &amp; 
Christa). Vancouver is a most interesting city and having a host certainly helped. I felt 
we were imposing more than a little bit, however.

At some point, and for some reason, when I considered our next scheduled events, (to 
take a ferry to Victoria for an evening then back into the United States &amp; points 
south). I had an undeniable urge to turn Eastward (toward home). I opted to pass 
Victoria and head toward home. Leaving Vancouver, I also separated from David &amp; 
Shelley.

After a tour through the Grand Tetons, the balance of my trip was dedicated to visitng 
places, friends/relatives and spending more time with Rose, in the Mid-West.

The remainder of the trip was uneventful , except for one more unusual observation, 
NEBRASKA!!!!!!!

As mentioned before, Ohio WAS my most-dreaded state to cross ... until I experienced 
Nebraska.

Even at &quot;risk-it&quot; speeds, it took a full day and three fuel stops to cross that state.
I was sure that any more time in the state and I'd be considered a resident.

My trip routed me through Ogalala, NE; to Lincoln, NE; to Council Bluffs, IA; to Saint 
Joseph, MO. Just south of Saint Joseph, I stopped to visit Fort Leavenworth, KS (the 
Buffalo Soldier Museum, highly inspiring). I recommend a stop at Fort Leavenworth!!!

I've mentioned sightings of VW vans &amp; busses in various 'yards' along my route. There 
were some impressive looking vehicles for salvage or sale.

My route was then through Kansas City to Springfield, MO. I made a rest stop 
(repairs &amp; recuperation) at Fort Leonard Wood (Branson is nearby and there's a 
wonderful eatery housed in a natural cave in the Ozarks (it's worth the visit).

Onward to Hardy, AR; to Nashville, TN; to Huntington, WV; to Morgantown, WV; to 
Rockville, MD; to Washington, DC; to Lorton, VA.

The whole trip was an event to be remembered but, when I got home, I was more than 
ready to park the Eurovan and walk for a while.


VEHICLES, PASSENGERS &amp; PERSONALITIES

As I reflect back on who we are and how we related to each other I realized ..

Pete &amp; Rose essentially lived and functioned with a body-clock in the Eastern time 
zone; David &amp; Shelley functioned based on Pacific time.

While that may seem insignificant there were instances when our 'clock-functions' got 
in the way.

David (the driver) &amp; Shelley are in their 20s and California-based. David's vehicle is a 
'73 VW Safare. I imagine, in normal operation, David's vehicle has a comfortable 
cruising speed of 55-60 MPH and a cruise range, on one tank, of approximately 175
miles.

Pete (the driver) &amp; Rose are (probably more than twice David's &amp; Shelley's age); 
primarily based in the East. Pete's vehicle is a '93 VW Eurovan. The Eurovan has a 
much higher 'comfort' cruising speed and a cruising range, on one tank, of  
approximately 375 miles. Additionally, I can set the Eurovan on cruise- control
and just &quot;role&quot;.

As a preference, Pete &amp; Rose are early risers, have a meal then start to move, with 
sporadic (shopping &amp; touring) stops. We prefer to get on a good highway (interstate), 
get up to speed, set the vehicle's cruise- and ride until we want (or need) to stop.
We move a limited distance, try to stop just prior to sundown and set up for the 
evening (rest &amp; relaxation). We get to bed early.

While moving with David &amp; Shelley, I (we) would get up and be ready to move much 
earlier than they (remember Eastern vs Pacific time). I had decisions to make about 
whether to wait until David &amp; Shelley were ready or to move without them. I really 
don't think I handled this especially well. At various times, I opted for one choice or 
the other (experimenting).

Correspondingly, David &amp; Shelley would move with an apparent goal; to get to a 
designated site by the end of the day (regardless of the time).

I had problems to consider; I could move at a faster speed or cover a shorter distance 
or keep my vehicle close, at  David's pace.

Keeping close to David, I could not use the cruise-control. I realized that by the end of 
any day, if I let David set the pace and I stayed with them, I was really exhausted at 
the end of that day. If I went ahead of David &amp; Shelley, I incurred the risk of being
somewhere we had not coordinated or agreed (cellular telephone and CD radio time)!.


SUMMATION

If you've read this far, I hope you've found enough to keep it interesting. Overall, the 
trip was well planned, even with my cited opportunities for improvement/alteration of 
future trips. I hope others will consider taking a trip like this.

For the next GNATT. I'd like to see emphasis placed on Eastern part of the Mid-West 
and the East Coast. To make this happen, or be a realistic consideration, there needs 
to be more active and visible participation by an East Coast 'list' membership.

Another consideration possibly ignored for this trip was advertising beyond our own 
list. At BBTA, several participants mentioned to me that they may have considered 
GNATT if they had known about it, in advance. The Volkswagen corporation
has a bi-monthly publication which lists numerous events. GNATT could have also 
been listed there.

I consider GNATT a workable event that could be in place approximately every two 
years (I'm forming ideas now for the next GNATT).


CONCLUSION

David, other participants and planners of GNATT, I mean no personal attack, insult 
or denigration of your efforts, presence or absence related to the tour. I have given 
support by my empirical presence. I invite others to put actions in front of their 
words. I'm no literary genius and if I've offended anyone here (with commission or 
omission) it was not with malice.

I'm hoping to contribute to a more positive and enjoyable 'trek' in the future.

If I could get more of you to participate, in the future, by any means, for any distance, 
I'd do it and say it again!

I'd like to see more list-members' participation next time!
