So Erik Soule sez:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 	New motors are available depending on the year and voltage.  '67
&gt;&gt; was a one year only, and the 12V 66's are also hard to find.
&gt;
&gt;Wow, '66 12V motors? Whooda thunk? I tried to stick a '67 wiper motor in my '65 
&gt;(since I converted to 12V) and remember not being able to make it fit for some 
&gt;good reason.
&gt;
&gt;Do the 12V '66 motors bolt on to the 6V wiper assembly, or does the whole 
&gt;assembly (motor and arms) bolt in?

I dunno.  I just know 12v was an option then...  I haven't spent too much
time looking at the differences between the two.  

The two styles I know distictly are what I call &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot;
The early ones use rods with ball and sockets onn the end that go to the
wiper shafts, while the lates have an entire assembly that holds the
shafts and everything as one big happy unit.

I know I can put my 12V whole-wiper-assembly in my '56 - I tried it
just for kix.
