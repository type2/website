&gt;PS - While you're at Vallejo, please look for a early-early bus back &gt;bumper!

Although I am on digest, so I didn't get this till Monday morn, I was still
looking for rear bumpers at Vallejo, and can say that I only saw front ones
(some fairly cherry, with overriders and all), but no rear one, and no
overriders for mine.
Sorry,
--terry (got my wiper parts at Vallejo, though)
