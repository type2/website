Has anyone tried installing any of the AutoLoc actuators as a
replacement for the VW actuators on their power door lock system?  If
so, I'd like to hear your testimonial.  

At prices ranging from $14 to $25 AND if they work, they would be a
viable alternative to the VW price of $80 to $115 for the VW actuators.
