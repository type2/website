&gt;has there ever been any consideration to splitting the &quot;vanagon&quot; list
&gt;into air-cooled and water-logged versions?

Here's the solution.  To make it easy to sort through mail just put something
in the &quot;Subject:&quot; that makes the variety of van aparent.  Like the model
year, or /S for Splitties, /L for Loafers, V for Vanagons, and E for
Eurovans.  Persnally I like the model year descriptor best.  For general van
conversations and stuff pertaining to all vans, just omit the model year.
 This way it'll be easy to get to the technical stuff that's important to you
and still share all the conversations  that everyone can enjoy.
