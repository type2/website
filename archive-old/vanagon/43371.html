Subject: Re: water tank-76 Westy

We normally use a mild bleach solution followed by a baking soda rinse. We've
used this on 4 different Westies over the last 10 years and never had a bad
result. When we're not using the Van we leave the threaded cap/cover off the
tank so it will dry. Just make sure too purge the system completely of the
bleach solution before using .
