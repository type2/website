The West Coast is heading North, the East Coast is thinking of heading 
North.  If the rest of you want to meet in the middle I'm *still* toying 
with the idea of a Route 66 tour.  Maybe both coasts could meet in the 
middle.  Now where would that be?  Hmmmm... Oklahoma? New Mexico?  I 
guess that would be the middle of Route 66, but we could meet in 
Springfield, MO (the birthplace of Route 66) and then one of *my* 
Busses would be able to attend. ;-)

&gt; &gt; OK,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now I'm sadly sure even now that this is primarily going to end up a
&gt; &gt; west coast thing, so before that happens, since the likelihood
&gt; &gt; of us east coasters having enough time to get out there, then
&gt; &gt; blow 3 weeks then get back is for most of us totally impossible,
&gt; &gt; I feel we need an alternative, and less we fail to get on the
&gt; &gt; ball I think we should start planning alternatives now.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I myself have been bending over backwards trying to work out a way to
&gt; go from North CArolina.But, indeed, 7 weeks is a LOOOOOOONG vacation, and the State usually
&gt; doesn't like such things...
&gt; Anyway, I really really really want to be in on *something* bus-trip
&gt; related, so tentatively count me in for such an east coast thing.
