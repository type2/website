&gt;My '76 Campmobile has the silver socket under the glove box.  When I
&gt;bought it (1990) there was no sign of a collapsable spare.
&gt;Sami - I also DO have a cigg lighter on my dash.

Is it stock? 

I did see the Brazilo-Bus pictures on David's (Schwarze) home page and it
looks like there is a cig. lighter right twix the radio and the ash tray.
