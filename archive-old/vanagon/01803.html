Hmmm, I wonder if with all this information if Joel could come up with a
formula to calculate top speed taking into account the color, number of
passengers (taking into account their sex and level of intoxication) and the
date of the most recent wax job...

Has anyone seen the TV VW add for the Corrado with the &quot;bug's eye view&quot; ?
Wonder what that would be like if they did the same add for a Vanagon?
