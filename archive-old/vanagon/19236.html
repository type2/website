&gt;Well, since it's Friday maybe I can prove I'm not an uptight jerk after all 
&gt;and tell you folks something amusing...

 &gt;&gt; Oh, and when I heated up Amy's plate in the microwave, the fig
&gt; &gt; and grapes were still on it....   oops!

&gt;This sounds like a perfect straight line to introduce 

	&gt;MICROWAVE GRAPE RACING!

&gt;Take a plate or other dish with a smooth surface, put a little film of 
&gt;vegetable oil on it for lubrication.  mark parallel lines for start and 
&gt;finish. Put it in the microwave. 

&gt;Each drive chooses a grape and places it on the starting line, with the hole 
&gt;where the stem was pointing *away* from the finish.

&gt;Clsoe the door and nuke the grapes for a few minutes.  As the grape juice 
&gt;begins to boil, a jet of steam will come out the stem-hole and you will &gt;have

&gt;ROCKET PROPELLED GRAPES!

&gt;Loser buys the beer...

Berry,
I know you guys at parc are always ten years ahead of the rest of the world,
but you've really outdone yourselves this time. give yourself a promotion and
sell this idea to microsoft.
