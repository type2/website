I had an old Type 3 (squareback) that exhibited the same symptoms; if you
want to prolong your pleasure you can pack along a screwdriver so you can arc
the terminals, since I believe the problem may be that the starter motor
bushings are stopping between the contact points, and you need to somehow turn
it enough so that the motor will be able to kick over.
If anyone out there has a more technical description of the above process,
please add your 0.02#162# worth.
