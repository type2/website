Subject: RE:Wash. DC (G.Dead)Killer bus sightings

&gt;As a follow up on the killer Mercedes (that looks like a VOLKSWAGEN) bus
sighting...
I talked to my buddy who was going to check out the truth to the $200. for
the pair. It seems that the older gentleman who told me the $200. has passed
on to VW Heaven. My buddy was able to locate and talk to his widow. When I
heard this I thought it was about to turn into a priceless Mercedes
situation. The widow was extremely cool and told my buddy that he could have
them (as in FREE) if he got them off of the property. The old guy also has
an old Ford Ranchero ('65?), Later model Ranchero ('79?), and a UFO
Thunderbird ('65-'68?/ big 'o boat model) It seems that someone who used to
live there also worked on VWs. I laid claim to the 25hp and 36hp stuff if
any existed, which is real doubtful. Were not talking about the proverbial
woodshed in the back of the horse pasture. This is a residential suburbia
senario. BTW: The correct model # of these beasties is 0319D. Very funky
indeed! =). I will drop the thread at this point as this subject is really
not VOLKSWAGEN related. I promise to sneak in an occasional update.
