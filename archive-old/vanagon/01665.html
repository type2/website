Subject:      Hubcaps! Hubcaps! Who's got the Hubcaps?

just a little note on Hubcaps or Wheel Covers ...

don't forget that the wheels for ALL buses and vanagons from 1971 to 1991
are the same (except for you syncro folks, and you GL/Carat/Whatever's with
the alloy wheels).

so any of the hubcaps or wheelcovers from any of those years will fit any
of the other years.  some of you might like to put the older small middle
chrome hubcap on your late model vanagons. and some of you earlier buses
might like the looks of the later wheel covers.

also: if you like the wheel covers but don't want to pay the dealer $50
EACH for them, check the yellow pages of a city near you: there seem to be
springing up some junkyards dedicated ONLY to hubcaps and wheelcovers. you
might have to actually go look, however, as the folks that run it don't
seem to be well versed in vw models. :(

also: if you'd really like new wheel covers, at about half the price, check
with a Hella dealer. Hella makes wheel covers identical to the vw ones for
the 1986-1991 vanagons ... but at $100 for a set of four. you can specify
chrome-plated, or silver-painted, or white-unpainted (so you can spray them
body-color).

just a thought.
