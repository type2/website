OK, owing to James Brill's FIAT story, I have a similar tale.  OK, so a 
friend has a VW Rabbit diesel and drove it a from New Mexico to Dallas.  
She parks at the top of the driveway and lets it idle, as some truckers 
once told her to let it &quot;idle down&quot; after such a journey (well, little 
did she or they know that it's only a real concern for turbocharged 
motors).  But anyway, the idling diesel (nope, no parking brake)takes right 
off back down the steep driveway, across the rather wide street, into the 
neighbor's driveway, severely bashing a brand-new Beemer.  The VW?  
Not a scratch, and was still idling when said neighbor came home 3-4 
hours later.  

Hmmmmm...
