Subject: Attention KMart Shoppers-generic cup holders

        This past weekend I was browsing the automotive section at my local
KMart and come across a generic cup holder (Roadway Brand) that looks
exactly like the cup holder in my vanagon.  You know the OEM with the base
that flips down and the ring that flips up.  Since I was in the market for
two cup holders because the two front ones on my van were busted I
purchased two of them for about $3.50 each.  I get out to the parking lot,
rip open one of new cup holders and hold it next to the remnants of the old
one still screwed to the side below the seat--it looks almost identical.
So I go home and remove the old cup holders and hold it next to the new
generic ones I realize that even the screw holes match up--installation on
new cup holders a piece of cake.  Incidentally, my wife checked out what
the VW dealer wanted for a replacement cup holder and it was $36 each!!!  I
saved like $65!!!
