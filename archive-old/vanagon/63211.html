Subject:      Running Rich - Need Help Please!

    I'm going to beautiful Lake Tahoe this Thursday to go mountain
biking at North Star Ski Resort and want to enjoy my whole tip. My on
problem is my 83.5 Westy is running rich.  Partially deduced by a black
sooty tailpipe. Right now I'm getting about 15 to 17 mpg with an
automatic.  After about 100 miles of driving the tailpipe is recovered
with black carbon.  I have replaced, O2 sensor, cap &amp; rotor, &amp; plugs.  I
went into diagnosing the electrical system by analyzing the contol unit
(computer) cable harnes with my multimeter.  Everything checked out
except for pins 15 &amp; 1 which were supposed to give me 1.5V with a
Fairchild Hall Control Unit.  My results were 0V, this frightened me.
The other problem is that none of my fuel injectors had any resistance
across them.  They were supposed to have about 18 Ohms.  All these tests
were done at the control unit's wiring harness.  I'm suspecting that
somehow the computer is on a default mode.  Even when I unplug my O2
sensor the engine speed doesn't change.  It seems that somehow the
engine's output sensors aren't feeding back into the intake data.
    I know that this is really technical and I do a fairly poor job at
explaining my problem.  I have looked through the archives back about 1
year and I didn't find anything that solved my probem.  PLEASE HELP.
Make my vacation a winner!

Thanks,
