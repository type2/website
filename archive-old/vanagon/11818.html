Subject: I think I blew a head gasket.

The other morning after letting my 87 Vanagon warm up for about 10 
minutes, I headed down the road. After about 3 miles I noticed there was 
still no heat and the temp gauge was rising. Turned around and got home 
before getting too hot.

Looked at this baby tonite and would you beleave the coolant is a puky 
orangish color? The oil looks like it might be thined out a little and 
was a little over the full mark.		

Argh! This is only after about 6000 miles on a rebuild by a reputable(?)_ 
mechanic over in St. Louis! ($1200). 

Does this sound like a head gasket to you guys (generic term)?
