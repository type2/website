Subject: re: 82 westy rebuild - compression data 

&gt;     I had a leak down test done today, and here's the numbers.
&gt;
&gt;     Since I can't recall which cylinder is which number (where's that
&gt;     manual?) here's a visual, looking down:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     front
&gt;     -------
&gt;
&gt;     18%  42%
&gt;     12%  43%
&gt;     -------
&gt;     rear
&gt;
&gt;     These values were percent leakage as measured on the guage. Looked
&gt;     like there was &gt;100 psi coming in.  It's interesting that the right
&gt;     hand set were so much lower.  The PO said that the right hand heads
&gt;     had been worked on - though he couldn't remember when.
&gt;
&gt;     All the plugs were pretty clean, no gunk, except the one from the rear
&gt;     right hand (is that #3) which had a white deposit on it.  I've put
&gt;     5,000 miles on it since I got it.
&gt;
&gt;     I saw some engines lying around and they seem fairly simple - so this
&gt;     winter holds a rebuild for christmas - my girlfriend agreed to let me
&gt;     use her garage... I'm sure I'll have to pay in kind ;).
&gt;
&gt;     I'd like to drive from CO to MD for Thanksgiving.  Any opinions on how
&gt;     that will affect the beauty ? (other than 'more wear').

This sounds just like my story - the resulting leakage caused the thing to
run *really* hot - luckily I had my trusty head &amp; oil temp gauges installed
so I could at least let it cool off before I ruined anything else. That was
a real slow trip. Going from CO to MD you at least have a tail wind, and
the weather is sure not going to be too warm, so you might make it.

My advice: figure out why its leaks - rings, valves or head sealing rings.
If you're lucky you can just flycut the heads, maybe lap the valves, and it
will be good as new.
