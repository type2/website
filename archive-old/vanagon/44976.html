&gt;When thumbing through Bentley, I 
&gt;noticed that the tank in the book has a wire coming off the top of it.  
&gt;is this the sending unit for the gauge?  My tank has no plug for the wire to

&gt;connect with, although the wire IS there. 
&gt;  Does anyone know whether the diesel's thermostat is interchangeable 
&gt;with a gas engine van? 
&gt; Is there any way to check the coolant tank cap without use of the tester 
&gt;as described in Bentley? Can I assume the cap is bad because the tank 
&gt;exploded?

Diesel Vanagons 81-82 were not equipped with coolant level sensors (VAG
251-919-372).  Starting with the '83 model they were.  Why there is a wire
there, who knows?  I see no reason why one could not be installed as the
microfiche film indicates there's a threaded plug in where the sensor would
go on the expansion tank on both early &amp; later models.  I would make sure
that the wire dangling near there IS for the dash led and not something else.

VW is very adamant about there being a different Thermostat for the Vanagon
Diesel (VAG 068-121-113H) and it opens at 87C.  It definitely is different
that the type of thermostat used on Wasserboxers.

As far as testing the expansion tank cap, the device shown in Bentley is the
one to use.  But personal experience and just plain dumb logic on my part
would make me put a new cap on after an explosive experience like that one.
 Be safe and spend the few bucks the cap costs.
