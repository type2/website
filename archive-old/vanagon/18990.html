Subject: Are GEX rebuilt engines good?

Hello again all. Thanks for the info on obtaining rebuilt heads. But, sad
to say, our '81 Westy's engine seized last night. So it sounds like a 
rebuilt engine from GEX would be the most cost effective option now.
Want to get the Westy roadworthy again. Any experiences you have had
with GEX would be welcome. Thanks!
Lisa
