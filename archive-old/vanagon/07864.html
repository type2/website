So Ron Van Ness says:

-- Snip - Snip - Snip --------------
 
&gt; the &quot;rubber&quot; types from VW for a whopping $9 each but I still think of all 
&gt; those old particles haunting my heat channel.  What are everyone's thoughts 
&gt; on this--Are our aircooled cars killing us a littler quicker than those 
&gt; watercooled people.

You really only have two choices here.  Either fix the carb leak and find the
source of your exhaust leak (probably the heat exchangers) and fix that too.
Or don't use the heater at all and plug up the ducts and wear all the warm
clothing you can wrap around you.  Sorry but that's all I can think of to
fix this problem unless you can afford an auxilary gas or propane heater.
But you said you couldn't afford much so I doubt that this will help 
either.
