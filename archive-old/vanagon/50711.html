Subject: second battery

Hey All:

I've decided to get start working on my 84 GL for next summer. The first
thing I want to do is install a second battery. I know that this has been
discussed before, and I spent some time in the archives searching for it,
but to no avail.

What I would like to do, is have the second battery charged from the
alternator as well. Can anyone point me to a file, etc. for this kind of
conversion??? 

Thanks

Matt
