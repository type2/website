Subject: Re: Tragic story: Wonder what failed?


Uh, this is a novice question, but I'm having trouble understanding
the axial load thing.  When Matt D., his 14 yr. old, me and my 11 yr
old went up on the Cessna few weeks back, Matt showed me around the
plane.  The propeller was not on the crankshaft -- it was mounted on
the shaft of a flywheel-sized gear, which was driven by the gear on
the crankshaft....

Do these do-it-yourself planes with VW engines have the propeller
directly attached to the crankshaft?  Would this not be a little too
fast?  It figures that the prop would be doing better than 30 revs/sec
at 2,000 rpm....
