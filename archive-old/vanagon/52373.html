Continuing on this Fridayish thread, since it's Friday for me at work.

Gonna be photog for aunts wedding. Needed film, took wife in parents 
Ch*v* Cavalier.  Got film.  Couldn't get it started.  Ran back to wedding.  
Took photos.  Send out search party for wife in strange neighborhood.
Find wife, profusely appologize.  GD GM forces clutch to be mashed to 
floor to actuate switch to allow starting.  Not just pushed in, arrgh!  
Still hate that feature, if it was mine it would be bypassed immediately.

Already told tale of someone filling crankcase with fuel though oil 
filler tube.

&gt; &gt; filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt; &gt; weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt; &gt; revolve!  Any others out there?
