Subject: Syncro in York, PA

I tried to send this yesterday but, it didn't take.

I was driving back to Maryland from PA after a weekend communing with my
Syncro, when I spotted a Vanagon at a VW repair place in York.

Specifics:
     (note:  there are no for sale signs or any type of papers on the
van.  I assume it is for sale as it is with other VW's that are.)
 
    '86 - '88, cream colored with tan and grey &quot;4 wd&quot; graphics, tan
cloth interior, 7-pass. Syncro Vanagon GL, with diff. switch, 103,000 on
odometer, alloy wheels, beautiful car, great shape, very sweet!

It is in a messed up lot that I guess is still Strassbaugh's Automotive,
at the corner of Rt. 30 and N. Hills Rd. in York, PA.  It shares the lot
with two '70's kombis, 2 cargo transporters:  a '65-'67 and a '68-'73, a
thrashed '62? camper conversion (rusted and no interior), several Ghias
and fastbacks and bugs (oh my!), and a VW/Porsche 914.  The vanagon and
the Type 1's are in amazing shape.

Here's a number, but I don't know if the guys phone is still connected
as his business is either being destroyed or is undergoing MAJOR
reconstruction.... (717)-755-5718.
				Later,
