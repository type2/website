Subject: Corrosion on left side head drain bolt

While removing the drain bolts in the heads today, I noticed the left 
side was quite tough to remove, as I carefully eased it out. 
Inspection showed that the last 2-3 threads were quite corroded, and 
grinding with a wire wheel showed that about 1/2 of one turn was 
completely pitted away.

By contrast the right side bolt was like new. The heads are on a 
factory rebuilt longblock with ~ 160k km on it. Could this be a 
warning sign of things to come?

ps: both sides look equally good, with no signs of crusty deposits 
around the head gaskets.
