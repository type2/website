Subject: RE: Mounting Spare off of USA bumper on split

When I took my '63 Deluxe to Guatemala (this was in the dark ages), I decided 
I needed two spares, and indeed it turned out I did.

To carry the second one, I used something like 3/16&quot; steel flat bar stock and &quot;U&quot; clamps 
to make up a carrier for the front bumper, no bolts through the nose. Essentially it was 
an &quot;A&quot; shape, with the legs of the &quot;A&quot; clamped to the bumpers, and, if I recall 
correctly, smaller clamps on the overriders. Once I had it fitted  and the proportions 
worked out, it would have been neater to have it welded, but it was just bolted 
together, though I did take the pieces to a plating shop and had them galvanized.

The spare was mounted to the &quot;A&quot; with three bolts through the regular holes in the 
wheel. On the carrier, I drilled two holes on either side of the legs near the top, and 
a third in the middle of the crosspiece. 

Mounted vertically on the bumper, it stood away from the nose a tad, and in 30,000 miles
it never damaged the front end.
