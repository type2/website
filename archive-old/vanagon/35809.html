Subject: RE: 100,000 mile tune-ups

&gt;From: &quot;Dan Houg&quot; &lt;fairwind_at_northernnet_dot_com&gt;

&gt;A friend of mine just bought a '96 Grand Caravan with the 3.8 (?) L 

My brother bought a 96 Caravan last year without telling anyone.  

&gt;related the service managers explanation of there being 'a special 
&gt;coating on the rings' that needs the friction of old oil to break-in 
&gt;properly.....  grrrrrr.  old arguement.  comments anyone?

VW has the same thing for their cars.  My brother-in-law bought a 95 Jetta
last year.  It said not to change the oil until 7500 miles.  This is to
help it break in better.  If you change it to soon you may have high oil
consumption later down the road.

&gt;- tune-ups are scheduled for 100K due to some Zircon-encrusted double 
&gt;ended spark plugs or something.  gimme my annual (or is it anal?) plug changes, 
&gt;please.  i just FEEL better.

Have you seen some of today's newer ignitions?  They have removed the
distributor and put in multiple high energy coils/transformers controlled by
computer.  The only things left that wear out are the spark plugs.   But most
of them are hidden away which makes it hard to change.  So they use platinum
plugs which wear much longer than conventional plugs.

&gt;- the side door has a 'new' latch that holds the door open on 

I have seen this somewhere before but can't remember where. :-)

&gt;quiet.  good mileage.  new.  it does what it was designed for and

It has cup holders everywhere.  They should put in a toilet if you are
going to drink that much.  I did see the sliding driver's side door but
again I can't remember where I have seen it before.  :-)
