Jim,
They are there as expansion chambers.  I've read that some list members 
have successfully caulked these with JB Weld and the like.  You should be 
able to scare some up at a parts yards if caulking them fails.  Are you 
sure it's the tanks that are bad and not the hose or clamps?

&gt; Ok, I have Roger (my Vanagon) up on jack stands. The gas has been drained 
&gt; from the tank. I've been nosing around under there before I start 
&gt; removing the tank. No one told me about these, but just happened up pick 
&gt; up a Haynes manual on the 1980 - 82 Vanagons. In there they detail 
&gt; removal of the gas tank for inspection and repairs. They mention the two 
&gt; plastic expansion tanks, one on each side. I looked over mine and noticed 
&gt; the one on the driver's side appears to have been leaking around the two 
&gt; hoses coming out of the bottom of it. Anyone know what these tanks are for. 
&gt; Can they still be purchased new from VW? Do I need them? What's a boy to do?
