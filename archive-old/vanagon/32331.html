Subject: Re: Same Syncro Boots? NO! (and

Derrick forward this info regarding CV Boot kits.

As far as I know the rear and front inner &quot;Boots are interchangeable.  The
fron outers obviously are not as they attach to the joint with a clamp.  The
other six joints have the six bolt flange attached.  If the &quot;Boot Kits&quot;
contain the hardware including bolts, the fronts are different because the
bolts are a different lenght.  This is to accomadate the spacer plate that
fits between the joint and the transmission drive plate.  Somwhere the front
boots were changed from the rubber to some type of poly eurathane (or
somthing more durable).  I do not recal when this happened, but almost all
the replacements i have done has been the later style.  When purchasing and
pricing the kits,  Always insist on Lobro, and get the complete kit with the
hardware.  The bolts should allways be repalced.  They must be tightened to
33 ft. pds. hard to do when the heads strip out.  Also, i have seen them
stecth where they would not hold torque. (I've seen them losen and fall out).
I allways use torque wrench when installing.  Especially on synchro.  
PS.  Many kits use grade 10.9 bolts.  I can get grade 12.9 for any one who
wants extra strenght.  These use standard 6pt allen sockets.  Regular
lubrication with hiogh quality moly or synthetic grease will keep the joints
around for a long time.
