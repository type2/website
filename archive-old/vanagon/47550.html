&gt; I did recently discover there is a support rod underneath the rear 
&gt;     seat in the 1986 (passenger side) which is handy for propping up the 
&gt;     rear seat cushion for storage and access to the secondary heat 
&gt;     exchanger valve.

Now you know why &quot;they&quot; always tell you to &quot;completely read and understand&quot;
the owner's manual before attempting to operate the veficle, lawn mower,
tricycle, gun, or whatever.  There are 17 other handy and useful features
hidden somewhere in your van, but I'm not going to tell you where they are.
 Your just gonna have to find them for yourself.  :)
