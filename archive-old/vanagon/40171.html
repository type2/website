&gt; I think that's good old market forces making it that high-- every country
&gt; in Europe has similar prices, and has had forever.

&gt; But I do wonder why they can't buy it as cheaply from the Middle East
&gt; as the U.S. obviously does.

They can.  I am pretty sure the Europeans get their gas for about the
same price we do.  When I lived there, Americans in the military were
entitled to tax-free gasoline, which usually worked out to 25 cents a
liter.  That would indicate that the rest is all tax.
