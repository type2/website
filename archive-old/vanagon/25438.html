Subject: re: bus as primary residence

I know I'm a few days late, but I did live in a friend's driveway (and 
about anywhere else I wanted to) for a couple of months. My bus was the 
most comfortable bed I ever had as a single person. Real downside was the 
dirty laundry management. It's tough to have more than about 3 days of 
dirty clothes in any confined space.
