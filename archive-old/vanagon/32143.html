Subject: Re: Re Tom's '53

&gt;I do have some large photos for you of April, and will send soonly.
:) :) :) .....I think the nowspeak is &quot;cool&quot; - I prefer &quot;far out&quot;, but then
I'm just an old gribbler...
&gt;Days are getting gradually longer! I'm gearing up for the new season, 
&gt;with you and yours as the star visitors!
This is getting serious - I will have to do my sums again - I have just booked
our van in for phase 3 of the resto. Will be in contact re prices etc again,
like imminent!
&gt;
&gt;By the way, I sent an e-mail to you mentioning that we have extra 
&gt;calendars. Is there still a demand over there?
I'm not sure -  they were selling well, I haven't dared enquire recently!!!
How do you fancy going again next year - let's make it smaller (say A4) with
one colour pic each page and little text (too much stress last time). We could
have a theme maybe - commercial and body styles or old period rare photos? I
think we should do something different? Maybe all these people on this list
have brill piccies to lend? There certainly seem to be a lot of Split owners
out there! We could go for a smaller print run...and I have found out how I
can save you the 17 percent VAT (loophole works for ypu but not me). Maybe
Roswitha might be haslled in a layout again - some of her other layouts from
last time would lend themselves to a new style / format? Will e mail you soon
- magazine deadline is upon me and school term starts on Monday and I have
about 300 essays to grade (I wish I hadn't had such a good idle Christmas
now!)
