Kd,

Well, as suggested by folks on the listserv I got the Bentley manual and
was able to use it to fix the problem.  It ended up being a loose
connector which has the bundle of wires from the gauges from the tach/fuel
gauge side of the instrament panel.  It plugs into a receptacle about 4&quot;'s
down.  After re-seating it, the gauges came back to life. 

Although the problem is fixed, it didn't seem to me that
the connectors snapped together the way I expected and I half-way expect
the problem to reoccur.  Anyway...

Thanks,
Ivan

&gt; &gt;Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've got an '85 Westy and have been having off and on problems with 
&gt; &gt;all
&gt; &gt;the gauges on the right side of the drivers instrament panel, 
&gt; &gt;including
&gt; &gt;the Tachometer &amp; fuel guage.  They just quit working all together and 
&gt; &gt;all
&gt; &gt;at once.  They used to come back within a few moments, but now have 
&gt; &gt;been
&gt; &gt;out going on three weeks.  Estimating my gas usage is driving me
&gt; &gt;crazy!  The guages on the left side with the speedometer still work 
&gt; &gt;fine
&gt; &gt;and are unaffected by this.  Anyone else had this problem or have any
&gt; &gt;ideas on the best way to repair it. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;Ivan  '85 Westy
