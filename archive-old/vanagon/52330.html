Subject: vanagon exhaust systems

Gerry,
Hi, I work with the Stebro Exhausts company and we noticed a little while ago that 
there do'nt seem to be any good quality and reasonably priced replacement Vanagon 
mufflers and pipes. We are thinking about tooling up to produce Vanagon systems 
(manifold pipes &amp; mufflers) in stainless steel. If - there is demand and it makes 
economic sense for us. 

What we would like to know from owner/enthusiasts is: how many of you would be 
interested and what do each of you feel is a reasonable price to pay? If we get enuf 
enquiries (have had only 4-5 so far) and can make a system for what people feel is a 
reasonable price - then we will do it.

Studies in the U.K. have shown that exhaust systems of stainless steel last so much 
longer than mild or aluminized steel that, in spite of high material costs, after 5 
years of service, they have ended up costing less than half that of mild steel exhaust 
systems. Not to mention the lower stress on the environment from continually replacing 
ordinary steel exhausts.

Hope that we can do something for you guys and TIA.
