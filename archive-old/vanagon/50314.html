Subject: Westy camper top project


Hi again,

I am just submitting again to the list in general to see if I can get any 
more new responses about a project I am thinking about.

My syncro GL needs more head room and sleeping space, so I want to cut a 
hole in my roof and bolt on a westy camper top.

If any body that reads this post has experience doing this, knows somebody 
that has done it or a shop that does, would you please let me know any info 
you have?  Any information may be of use so please, don't be shy.

Since I don't monitor the list traffic continuously, would you please 
respond to me in person?

thanks,
Fred Porter
