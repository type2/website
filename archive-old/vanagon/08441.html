Subject: Selling The Passat!!!
Date: Mon, 19 Dec 1994 16:42:18 -0800 (PST)

My poor Passat has felt very lonely and depressed since I got the '85 
Vanagon.  I think I drove it last week but I can't really remember--I 
guess I'll enter Vanagon Recovery or...  I'll sell it.

Anyone interested on the list?  Make a great second car, but since I 
have no significant other, it's kind of a waste.

E-mail me.  I wouldn't mind delivery to the Northeast or Upper Midwest 
for a last road trip before she went away but I would like to sell by 
the end of Janauary.
