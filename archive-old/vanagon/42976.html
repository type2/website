Subject: control arm bushings for 85 Westy

I'm in the process of getting parts together to do the control arm bushings on 
my 85 westy. I have found a few reasonable sources for the tops but no one has 
a part # for the bottom bushing . I have'nt gone to the dealer yet so I'm 
wondering if any one knows the # or if the top bushing can be used in the 
bottom; as well as a probable source for said bottom bush. Any advice would be 
great. Thanks, Tom Czerniak
