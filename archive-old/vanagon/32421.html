Subject: RE: What Is It??

Jack Bateman innocently asks for a recap of most of the main threads of 
two years of vanagon_at_lenti.  Because another recent message asked about
tire sizes, I will repeat from some months ago that I did the math and
found that big tires on big 15&quot; wheels, assuming you could find such,
would benefit effective gear ratio by 6%.  Not enough for me.

I run 205/60-14 Goodyear Aquatreds on my 81 Vgon and have been satisfied,
altho like many others I wish I could cruise at lower rpms.
