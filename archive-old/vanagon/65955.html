Subject:      Coolant pipes 85 Vanagon GL

Canadian winters+salt have destroyed these cooling pipes that run from
engine to radiator under carriage.
Have talked to Kyle at volksmotorsport...has used pipes in good [CA]
condition but shipping cost is almost as prohibitive as cost of new.
Has anyone close by a line on pipes? new? used?
Has anyone had experience with optional replacement? rubber?  copper?
combination rubber/metal?
Has anyone heard of VW factory plastic replacements?

Thanks

Leo
