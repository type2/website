What you're looking for is a pyrometer--measures the temp of exhaust 
gases, typically at the exhaust manifold.  I've seen these used in boats 
quite a bit, and I've wondered myself why nobody seems to use them in 
automotive applications.  If I already had oil pressure, CHT, volt, and amp 
guages installed (I've already got oil temp), and if I were a general 
guage freeek, I'd slap one in.

Lessee... 6 guages--more if you want separate CHT and pyro guages for 
each head!  Kewl!
