Aww, don't give up yet, Rusty!  Don't believe the parking garage wimps 
until you try it out.  I've gotten our 6' 8&quot; westy into parking 
garages marked as having as little as 6' 5&quot; clearance.  (And yes, I got 
the camper out again!)  The trick is taking it slow and watching the 
clearance between the top of the camper and the ceiling of the garage as 
I drive.

'Course, it helps if you're tall like me, so you can drive while sticking 
your upper body out the side window far enough to see the roof of the 
camper to make sure you don't scrape things up!  Shorter folks should 
have friends with them when trying out new garages, I guess...
