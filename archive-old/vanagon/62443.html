&gt;yup. that's what it says:

&gt;&quot;1985 Discovery Volkswagen Camper, LT400, imported, self-contained, loaded,
&gt; new motor, 6-cyl., diesel, 5 spd., 18 mpg, brakes, tires, winch, shower,
&gt; stove, sleeps 5, many extras, parts, all paper work, parts all avail. in
&gt; US, $18,700 obo  (818) 735-7963&quot;
&gt;
&gt;which is, i think, a Burbank, CA area code. this is the much larger van,
&gt;built by VW and MAN (of Austria). it looks somewhat like the Vanagon/T3,
&gt;but is larger. an LT400 (they start at LT250, i think) is a BIG truck. :)
&gt;
&gt;might be worth a look-see, if you live in the area. :)

Joel and group,
I called on this about a week ago. It's what it say's it is. After thinking
long and hard about it, it's a motor home, duelies and all. All custom
made. It's had about 3 or 4 owners since importation. As I thought about
it, I have a motor home. What I like about the Westy is it's small, I drive
it around like a car. Not the same animal.
