Subject: Re: placement of list stickers?


&gt;&gt; *Plus* bottom right corner of the windshield :) You wanna see the
&gt;&gt; affiliation both ways, when passing *and* when coming from the opposite
&gt;&gt; direction. (This would also generate extra demand for the stickers and
&gt;&gt; please Richard, right?)

It seems to me that placing it in the RIGHT side of the windshield would only
work out well in England, Japan, &amp; Australia where people drive on the left
side of the road.  I suggest that any vehicle in the right side driving part
of the world have its sticker on the LEFT side of the window.
