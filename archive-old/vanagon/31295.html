&gt;inches of slush in the lane ahead (about 300 yards), and took my foot off the
&gt;accelerator so I wouldn't hit the snow full-bore.  Well, as soon as I let up
&gt;on the accelerator, the van started sliding immediately (I apparently hit
&gt;glare ice), and in less than 2 seconds I ran head-on into the side of the

This is the classic 'throttle off - oversteer'  Letting up abruptly on the
gas does a nice weight transfer, unloads the rear end, which obligingly
locks up, and weights the front so it sticks better, allowing the rear to
daintily pirouette around the front if you are the the slighest bit out of
alignment.  This happens in beetles worse in snow, and to Porsches on dry
pavement.  This is a fun high-speed driving technique, hit the corner fast,
brake late and hard then downshift to effect maximum weight transfer and to
be able to mat it as you exit the corner. Mat it too soon and the front
unweights and you curbsurf.  Best left for summertime practice.  Works best
in rearengine/rear wheel drive, VW/Porsche/F1. 
        My worst spinout has been in 3&quot; of slush also, only time I've
hydroplaned a (2WD) vanagon.  Going straight, 60mph, front lifted and
crosswind took it over to the deeper slush on the edge of the road.  Van
promptly turned left, I watched the passenger of the car I was overtaking
turn and look, so I waved, somewhat through my passenger window!  Steering
into the slide got the wheel to full lock and the van eventually came around
back into its lane without fishtailing, aided by more furious wheel
spinning, so I continued overtaking. One thing learned after years of VW
driving, never give up your speed no matter what, what we lack in power we
can make up for in momentum! Don't always need to be pointed in the
direction you are going, but it sure feels better if you are. Oh, and I
don't drive like this anymore, doubt I have the reflexes nowadays.  Tim
