&gt; Okay, its time I asked, what exactly is a &quot;dropped&quot; or &quot;sucked&quot;
&gt; valve?  And I'm sure i know what a burnt valve is, but maybe you
&gt; guys can tell me just so I know fer sure.  And how do these things
&gt; manifest themselves.

I believe a dropped valve refers to what happens when the face of the valve
separates from the stem and bounces around in the combustion chamber.
This happened to me before and it wasn't pretty.  The piston in the
cylinder it &quot;dropped&quot; into was completely destroyed - the biggest piece
of piston remaining was smaller than a ping pong ball.

You can usually tell that this is going to happen when your exhaust
valves repeatedly get &quot;tight&quot;, by that I mean that the clearance shrinks
repeatedly down from .006&quot; to nothing.  This is an indicator that the
valve may be &quot;stretching&quot; and getting ready to break.  If this happens
to you, pull the head and replace the valves before your enging goes boom!

If you have a type IV motor you can get the sodium filled exhaust valves
which run much cooler than the solid variety.  These were standard
equipment in Porsche 914's, or so I'm told.  They are becoming hard to
find and are expensive - last time I checked they were $26 apiece...
