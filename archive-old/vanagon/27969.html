Subject: Re: Shocks for '71 bus

&gt;Anyone know of a cheap shock for the front end of a '71???? 
&gt;(preferably from sears since they owe me some cash).  I don't care 
&gt;about stock, I just want to save my front end.  Any ideas/ 
&gt;reccomendations?
&gt;
&gt;I originally bought the KYB gas shocks that everyone was raving about
 but I found them very stiff, giving a rough ride so I bought the cheap
 stock Boge (sp) german shocks and they are great! smooth, soft ride
 yet they are stiff enough to hold in the corners (as long as you don't
 speed).
