&gt;&gt;&gt;Winnebago converts some of the Eurovans into mini-motorhomes, by adding
&gt;&gt;&gt;Winnebago's own body (aft of the front doors) that's about 20&quot;-24&quot; wider
than
&gt;&gt;&gt; the normal Eurovan.  Inside they install sink, stove, refer, toilet and
other
&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff.  While the Winnebago body is tall (as even mini-motorhomes are)
there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is no pop-top in this version.  They name this vehicle the Rialta and
sell
&gt;&gt;&gt; them through Winnebago's own network of RV dealers.  List price is about
&gt;&gt;&gt; $45,000 I think.
 
&gt;&gt; I just looked at one of these last weekend.  I think it had to have been 
&gt;&gt; a '97 as it had the VR6 engine.  However, the price on the window was 
&gt;&gt; $55,000.
  
&gt;I recall the sticker one the 97 EVs at Autohaus in Lancaster, PA to
&gt;more like $35K, maybe a few more.  $55K or $45K are both absurd.

READ THE POST BEFORE RESPONDING!  Both the $45K and $55K figures were
regarding the Winnebago Rialta mini-motorhome, NOT the Eurovan Camper.
