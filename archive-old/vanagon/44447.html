 Subject: '65 Poptop Camper Bus Forsale

  Being that I am the assistant editor of our local VW club, the Apple
  Valley Volkswagen Association here in Yakima Washington, my neighbor
  asked me to take an ad for the &quot;classified&quot; section of our upcoming
  edition.
  Said neighbor is trying to sell his camper.  It is a '65 Micro-bus
  with poptop.  I went over to take a look at it and without getting
  underneath I looked it over.  I'm not a pre '68 fan so I don't know
  too much what to look for.  This is the way I saw it:
      Body:     Good+
      Glass:    Good (Drivers side winshield chipped)
      Engine:   Stock - runs good
      Rust:     Body-none (Minor rust around foot area - both sides)
      Needs paint - TLC
      Comment(s): Comes with new canvas and lot's of spare parts.
  Call (509) 457 2754   (Ask for Sky)  He wants $2800 for it and he's
  the 2nd owner (15 years)
  Jerry
