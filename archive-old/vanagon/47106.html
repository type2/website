&gt; Gaving recently sold a converter for a 86 Syncro (same cat as yours), the
&gt; aftermarket cats come with one of each.  I've let the MFR know that 86-87
&gt; models with the Original Collector Pipes used triangular gaskets on both
&gt; ends, but it remains to be seen if they'll supply them that way in the
&gt; future.  They don't like adding anything that may unnecessarily increase the
&gt; price and have anything left over for those that don't need the part.
&gt;  Suggestion:  buy the cat with the two different gaskets, buy the extra
&gt; triangular gasket as I mentioned in the earlier post and keep the doughnut
&gt; metal gasket for when the time comes to replace the Collector Pipe - you'll
&gt; need it then (VW and we get almost $12 for this doughnut - expensive, but can
&gt; only get from Germany at this time).  If you buy the VW Dealer Converter, you
&gt; don't get any gaskets and pay 4 times as much for the converter.  Converter
&gt; Part Number is VAG 025-131-701 - fits 86-91 models.

Dennis has suggested that I could get a doughnut that is flat with a 
guide ring on one side.  You suggest that I use a triangular gasket since 
I have the original collector pipe.  So, how can I tell if the Cat. 
converter I'm looking at will accept either the gasket or doughnut?  It 
has been mentioned that the Walker converter will take either.  Are there 
after market converters that will only accept the doughnut, or is the 
collector pipe the determining factor?  Thanks for setting me 
straight.....I don't know where else I'd get this information.
