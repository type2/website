&gt;Anyone know if the master and slave are rebuildable?  My parts guy
&gt;claims they are not!  He does have factory rebuilds in stock though for
&gt;about $100 a pop.  If they are rebuildable where does on aquire a
&gt;rebuild kit?


I was able to get them a *lot* cheaper that that through my sources when I 
needed them for my '85.  More like $100 for *both* (this for OEM German).  
Let me know if I can help.
