&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bullet indicators finished in '62 but 612483 would definatly
&gt;&gt;make this bus a '60.
&gt;
&gt;Then I have proved nothing, since Steve said the number could also be
&gt;read as 672483, which would be a '61 according to the NEATO list.

Tom F,

  We have proved that its either a '60 or '61. But its impossible
to prove anything with inaccurrate details.

Cheers,
