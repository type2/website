Subject: Engine Gremlin

I have an odd occurance with my '88 Westy. In the morning when I start it and
drive around, it is as if gremlins are in the engine. What happens is that
occasionally, when at a stop the engine will  decide to idle at 2,000 RPM.  A
good blip on the throttle will bring the idle back down to 900 RPM. There
seems to be no ryme or reason to when the engine will do this - but it is
more likely when it is first running.

Ideas?
