Hi,

	At the Neillo Porsche Concours, I spotted the _coolest_ VW.  This
guy had a Beck 550 Spyder, and this is one slick machine!  I forgot
the camera (D'oh!) so I didn't get any pix, but it was a really cool car.
Most of the P-Snobs panned this little beauty, but I thought it was neat,
and the owner and I chatted for awhile about it and he even let me
sit in it! (Anyone who's ever been to a concourse would know this is 
highly irregular!)

	Talk about strange people.  I witnessed Dwight Mitchell (Local Porsche God)
and this old guy with a '89 speedster arguing over whether or not he had the
correct oil filter! Sheesh!  And the places the clean on those cars!  I
don't wash the _outside_ of mine enough!  Freud would have a field day
with these anal types!
	
	I also got to meet Harry Pellow, aka &quot;The Maestro&quot; who had some stuff
there, and this 356 engine that looked like it just came out of a time 
warp from 1957 or something.  That would prolly look real good in someone's
oval or split (Ric?)

	Then when I left, this guy and his family in a cool '65 camper (a Devon,
I think) pulled up to go the parts store next door.  A nice, Peru Green (?)
bus with safaris, whose paint was faded but the body and bumpers were perfect!
