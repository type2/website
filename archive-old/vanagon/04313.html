Subject: Re: vent question


	This thread on the venting has reminded me that I have never 
quite figured out my &quot;Pandora's Box&quot;.  I do plan to dig into it soon, but 
I have one question;  is the dash fan used only for the side vents?
My Westy also sends out heated air at all times, but I attributed it to 
the mess the previous owner made when he removed the air cond.  
	Anyway, if anyone can answer this simple question, I would be 
much abliged.
