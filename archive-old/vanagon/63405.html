Subject:      Push Rod, Broken, Lifter can't assemble, hydraulic (long)

Shoved as much into the subject line to assist others in future archive
searching,
as I had no luck. (Type2 down however, so couldn't check there)  Anyway
. . . .

I noticed a small oil leak on the #4 intake pushrod, and a little on the
left valve
cover, so went to *fix* the small problem.  If it were only so easy . .
. . .

First thing I noticed was the lack of oil on the inside of the valve
cover.  Hmmm
Discovered that the outer end of the push rod was smashed up, and bits
of it
were laying under the rocker arm.  Aaarrgghhh . . . . . .

Realizing that the rocker assembly would need to be cleaned of metal
bits, and
having horrendous thoughts on what else was wrong.  Found that the main
rod
for the rocker assembly had been starved of oil, and was scored . . .
yuck

Trying to get it running
for the morning commute, I borrowed a rocker assembly and push rod from
the
playhouse bus, lubed it and installed.  Turned engine to get into
position for
doing a valve adjustment, things just didn't look right, set engine
position again
and thing still didn't look right.  Push rod end was way too far out.
Grumble . . .

Took rocker off, removed push rod tube, push rod, and proceeded to get
the
lifter out to check on it, now realizing that metal bits could be in
there too.
Used a dental pick to pull lifter.  First time to remove a lifter for
me.
A rather small object came out, hmmm.  Tried again, another small
object.
Next time a spring came out, and came to the realization the lifter
keeper
wire wasn't there and I was disassembling lifter in place . . . .
errrrgh

Finally got it all out, and again decided to borrow a lifter from the
playhouse.
Since it felt gritty and trying to do things proper, I disassembled
lifter to clean
and lube.  That was easy, very little pressure needed to press piston to
remove
pressure on keeper wire.  This'll be a snap . . . . . famous last words

After fabricating a jig to hold the push rod vertical, and cutting the
VERY hard
to cut push rod (used a triangular file with the rod chucked in a drill
at low speed)
My wife left the bedroom, near the garage, and slept in the living room.

Tired to apply pressure to the piston to clear the access for the keeper
wire.
No luck whatsoever!  HOW DO YOU PUSH THAT SUCKER IN ? ? ? ? ? ?

Are there any dire consequences of my above actions, to wit:
Used rocker assembly from another head, another brand (VW vs AVC).
Used push rod from different engine.

Anything else I need to do to get rid of the metallic bits and pieces in
the engine?
or (can I hope) that the filter did it's intended function?  Found
nothing in the screen.

I recall that when I was doing the oil change a week ago, I found a
piece of wire
on the drain container.   Didn't think much of it at the time, but I now
realize that
I saw the lifter keeper wire . . . . dummy, check things out ! ! ! next
time

The only symptom of all this was a clacking lifter sound that went away
after
a few minutes ! ! ! ! ! ! so didn't think much of it.
