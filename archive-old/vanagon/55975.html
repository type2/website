Subject: '85 vanagon rebuild or burn?

Howdy all-

New guy on the list and I've got a question that's half scaring me to death.
I've got an 85 vanagon, she's apporaching the 120,000 mark and signs of wear
are begining to show.  My family and I -love- this vehicle.  Our original
thoughts were to rebuild it from top to bottom, but as we (or rather, I :)
look for information about taking on such a task nothing positive is turning
up.  Our mechanic has advised against (for no reason other than the head
problem which isn't showing up -yet-) and all literature I find about fixing
up vw's are geared toward aircooled engines.  I guess what I need is to
hear some good, positive experiences with rebuilding watercooled engines.
Unless, of course, all of them are negative, but I suppose I need to hear
that as well.  Thanks!

Rik
