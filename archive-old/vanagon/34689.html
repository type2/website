&gt; I was told by the DMV that no  every-other-year inspection is required
&gt; for 65 and earlier cars, but that a smog certificate WAS required for
&gt; change of ownership.  You might want to check into this before you buy a
&gt; '63 bus with a small block Chevy motor in it.

That is incorrect.
