John asked

&gt;Gosh, I am sure tempted to be there with my '72 Safare.. anyone know &gt;how far St. Louis is from Minneapolis?

My Rand McNally show you only 540 miles away!

&gt;Also, anyone from Minnesota or Iowa going to make it? I sure would like 
&gt;to caravan along with another bus or two.

I know of someone up there! A guy named Gerry is getting his gas
problems sorted out, time for a little test run ...:-).
