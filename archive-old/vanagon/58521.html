Subject: Middle Seat for 87 Vanagon GL Westphalia Camper

&gt;From the archives:
&gt;&gt;Unscrew your door sill and remove the carpet. Peak under the floor boards and look for large flat plastic domes with Phillips head in them.  Carefully cut the flooring parallel with the corrugation in the sheet metal with the domes in it. This is to remove two strips same length as the floor rails you scrounged.  Take out the plastic screws, bolt down the rails and slide in your new middle seat.&lt;&lt;

First, I don't have any carpet that gets screwed down.  I have a thin
(maybe 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch) layer of indoor/outdoor carpet that lays,
under it's own weight and fit, directly on the floor.

Second, if peaking under the floorboards means viewing from underneath
the car, I don't see any sign of where bolts would have gone for a
middle seat.  Nor do I see any signs of bolt locations under my piece of
indoor/outdoor carpet.

Third, what I'm trying to do is (if I understand correctly) find a
two-person middle seat (and parts) that faces forward and can be
readily, and easily, removed and can also be slid outward a foot or so
for access to the refrigerator.  I'm not interested in rear-facing
seats, or the single-person seats, and I don't think I'm interested in
the seats that fold back (certainly not a deal-breaker).

Finally, I'm in the Sonoma County area of California, so this region is
where I'll be actively searching for the seat, and it's bolts, rails,
and seat belts.

The above comments pretty much summarize my understanding of my options
and installation requirements based on replies to my original post.  Am
I on track or way off base?  Any other comments?

Thanks, Bryan
