&gt;ps: I also have a bit of a dilemma - I've got a few more days to 
&gt;claim stuff under the dealer warranty where they will cover 50% cost, 
&gt;so I'm wondering if I should tell them to replace the rack, gearbox, 
&gt;pump, etc &amp; pay  the 50%, or just wait &amp; do the work when it does go 
&gt;for good, and get the parts at a wrecker. Although the steering seems 
&gt;to be original with 320K km, the pump is quiet &amp; no signs of leaks. 
&gt;Any advice?
&gt;
&gt;

Get them to repalce the transfer housing.  It is expensive.  Instalation is
actually easy.  I have seen racks fail that can also cause that binding.
 Usually it happens after an accident or encounter with a huge pot hole or
something.  If the pinion gear in the rack gets bent or chipped, you will get
that binding feeling.
