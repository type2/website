Subject: ECU location on 86 Westy

Hello, I'm looking for the ecu without the aid of a Bently :(
Can anyone please tell me where specifically it is and what it looks 
like? I opened a couple of black boxes connected to wire harnesses, 
but all I found was two relays in one and wire harness connectors in 
the other. I'm trying hard to not win the record for most money put 
into a van in one year award.

Thanks in advance!

PS I've already used the search function through the archives, to no 
avail. 

Regards, Vance
