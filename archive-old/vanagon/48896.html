Subject: Re: 87' Vanagon Syncro brain needed

   Those Guys (the Dealer) are going to put a comuputer in it, make 
   $200 more dollar on it, then find the problem in the wiring harness.
   Worst of it, They'are not going to tell you your computer was OK. 
   Throw enough moeny at them and they will think of something to save
   face.  This is the root of why The Vanagon didn't sell!

&gt; &gt; Well, the so-called &quot;final&quot; diagnosis on my intermittent engine failure is
&gt; &gt; that the computer is faulty (after replacing most everything else but,
&gt; &gt; fortunately, the engine failed to start in the garage and they sound
&gt; &gt; confident that this is it). New ones cost $700 and parts place quotes
&gt; &gt; $600. Anyone know of a cheaper source or a used one?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest you make 'Dr. Frankenstein' proud and open up the &quot;brain&quot; itself
&gt; and see if there is anything obvious amiss.  Like a cold solder joint or
&gt; obvious bad component (burned or melted).  What have you got to lose?  
&gt; Maybe it will be a, ahem, no-brainer. :]  
&gt; 
&gt; Those guys at the shop aren't going to look inside.  They've already
&gt; proven that, so why don't you while you still can.  Could be the difference
&gt; of $600 and $10.  
&gt; 
&gt; It's your money....
