&gt; as far as i know, ALL the vanagons have a blue headlight high-beam indicator
&gt; .. which looks like an LED but really isn't. it's some sort of little bulb
&gt; that is packaged just like an LED, but is really an incandescent device (at
&gt; least i THINK it's incandescent ... it's never listed in anything as an LED).
&gt; 
&gt; .........................

And mine is invisible except when it's dark. So at twilight if I turn on
my headlights I can only know whether they're high or low by resorting to
my memory. Fortunately I have a fabulous memory and can always recall
precisely whether my lights were on high or low beam at last usage...

Are there any easy cures for this problem? Get a bigger bulb?
