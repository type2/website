Subject: WAS Tshirts, now: trim those replies

hey now,

i know the list gods have mentioned this before, but to remind folks: it's
not necessary to quote several pages worth of a note in a reply. quote what
is necessary, nothing more. a one line reply with 4 pages of the original note
is just a waste of bandwith and list space.

just my two cents.
