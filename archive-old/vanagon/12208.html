&gt; My '85 Vanagon barely passed its emissions test this time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So I have been experimenting with turning the CO adjustment screw
&gt; counter-clockwise.  My first attempt was to make a full turn of the screw.
&gt; This seems to have resulted in no deleterious effects to the running of the
&gt; engine.  Should I keep turning?

Keep turning.....worst thing that will happen is an overlean condition, (bad 
idle)
