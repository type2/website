Subject: Re: Paint/Interior Codes (was M-Codes)


well....... here is the tag from my 65' westy that i promised you all ( i
know you are as excited as i am to find out the myserious M- codes)

---------------------------------
|                               |
|  1 19                         |
|  425 A42 002 080 108 168      |
|  UH 2312 523907 50911317      |
|                               |
---------------------------------

so with limited brainpower i have figured out

the westy was made on jan. 19/65 (interestingly vw auto museum told me jan
18/65?)

M Codes that I have figured out
-------------------------------

425 - ?
A42 - ?
002 - ?
080 - divided partition/walk through mode
108 - SO 42 interior
168 - 88 amp battery

523907- does this mean the westy was originally pearl white? from what i can
        surmise from jim bryant and dave easterwood my bus would have originally
        been pearl white (VW auto museum told me that the bus's colour would
        have originally been &quot;52,39,07&quot; so it makes sense.)


My question is how does a paint code of 523907 correlate w/ an L number of
L87 which is what i think pearl white's L number was?

Also on a final note i see that my panel has 043 M code (prep for swiss
license) wonder what they did, i can't see anything obvious

One final question, my panel van has M code number 025, which is supposed
to be &quot;lap belt anchor's&quot;, which it does have. interesteingly my 65' westy
also had the threaded holes to fit seatblets, but these are never mentioned
in its m codes?? when i got the 65' westy i didn't have any fron belts in
it??

And finally it has been my experience that the VW auto museum isn't the
&quot;authority&quot; on the busses stats. I have written to them numerous times and
found their info very inconsistent. I have written to them a couple of
times w/ the SAME vin and got back VERY differnt info on date's of
production, orginal colours etc! SO BEWARE i don't take the auto museum's
word as the gospel.

Recently i wrote to the auto museum w/ the VIN of the early 53 deluxe i
found and they told me that vin belonged to a 1944 Kubelwagen!
