Subject:      door handle fixed

Hey all,
I seem to have fixed the sliding door handle problem I was experiencing.

I removed the inside door handles, and then pulled off the door panel.
I found a loose screw on the latch/lock assembly that had managed to
back itself out quite a bit.  I assumed that this had something to do
with it, and so inserted the handle/lock assembly all the way in, then
tightened down the loose screw.  that seems to have done the trick as
the door handle now works like it's supposed to.  Also, it doesn't pull
out of the door anymore, which makes me happy :-)

So whatever that screw did, I think tightening it fixed the problem.

Sean
