Subject: batteries  ... and rummors of batteries
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 1994 11:08:47 -0700 (MST)

Hello vw gang,
I have heard rumors of a second battery in my vanagon.  I think this might
come from the bible, actually.  &quot;In the latter times, you'll hear rumors
of batteries&quot; or something like that.  I can only come to the conclusion
after pulling out the seats and searching that my 1982 diesel vanagon
does not have a second battery.  Has anyone actually installed the second
battery in their camper?  What size did you use?  I know that I'll want
a deep cycle battery, but I worry about how big of a battery I should
get to fit under the passenger seat.  In fact, I'd really like to put it
under the driver's seat but that seems pretty hard to do.  On the other
hand, once done, it is done.
Stuart Hutton
