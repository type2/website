Thom speaks true about Vallejo.  Weak.  I managed to stay away from any
promoter police, but they didn't look nice. 

I did OK, got there about 9:30 am and was surprised at how small it seemed.
I think it just looked alot smaller because the show cars where moved.

After all the main stuff sold I was still sitting there with the free box,
big carbs and the whacked bus till later in the afternoon.  Then a couple
guys come over and look at the bus.  $350?  Sold.  Then I proceed to inform
him of it's little problems, like the huge dent in the rear, and the
super-heating motor.  He says it's all OK, he works at Griffin Motorworks.
I asked him if he heard of the guy I just bought my other bus from and sure
enough, both these guys were the mechanics on the bus I just bought.  We had
a good time recounting the intricacies of the engine, the work they did on
it, how hard the guy would drive it, and how damaged it was when I got it.
Made the day.  Went shopping, bought a blumenvasen.

Eug,
'71
