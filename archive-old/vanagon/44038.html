Subject: Buses on the Blue Ridge (late)


I haven't read a report on BOTBR yet, and my mail was down for the last 
week, so I didn't write one.  There were a few list members there that 
I hadn't met before.

Richard Palmer, who I had met before, was there in the &quot;Captain America&quot; 
bus with the smiley face.  Good luck to him on his cross country trek!  
The two girls riding with him said they were almost ready to kill him.  
This was only 2 days into a cross country trip!  Something about drink 
and smoke...

Forgive me with the names, but I believe it was Sean who was there in a 
'76 white Westy with gauges galore, a bicycle horn on his mirror, and 
the biggest freakin' compass I've ever seen mounted on the dash.  That 
sucker was almost as big as a bowling ball!  He also had decorated the 
bus interior with a big collection of Mardi Gras beads.  He must have 
been showing his tits down there!  Maybe not...  I can't remember if he 
had any white beads or not...

Someone from Greenville or Greensboro in a Vanagon stopped by my 
campsite as I was trying to scarf down some tuna out of the can Saturday 
night.  Just had a chance to say hello before we went to the bonfire.

There was also someone in a '68-71 crew cab with one of Richard's 
sticker on it.  I never did meet them though.

I ended up riding with Pete Durand and Allen Becker in Pete's '66 blue 
and white Malibu conversion with a Westy SO-42 interior and Dormobile 
top.  The guy who was going to ride with me in my '65 Sundial backed 
out at the last minute so I rode with them for financial reasons.

There were a lot of nice buses there.  Mark Lapriore was there in his 
highroof, Mitch drove his early '63 European Panel, but the real eye-
catcher was a '62 Sealing Wax Red Westfalia with SO-35 interior.  It 
was the most beautiful SO-35 I have ever seen.  I have always thought 
this interior looked plain until I saw this one.  Totally complete!  
Tent looked like it was the first time it had been set up!  Had toilet, 
cups, chandelier, spare tire table, etc.

All in all, over 30 splits, over 20 bays, a handful of vanagons, and 
even a Eurovan (I'm still not sure it was a VW).  ;)

Oh well, hope to see more of you there next year!
