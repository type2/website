	There was some speaking of an inspection plate with an
oil temp sender built in (this would be for a 2.0L).
Where would I find one of these things?

Also, do they make any kind of engine preheater?
ITs been mighty chilly here, and I would like to give the
bus the benefit of oil, rather than sludge.

I also keep hearing this ticking sound from the rear,
CV joints?  I dunno.

My defroster works mighty well, though, so I might just
sit in it and defrost the windows and listen to the radio :)
