Subject: Camp grounds near Santa Fe?

Are there any list members who can recommend or steer us clear of any
campgrounds near Santa Fe, NM? This particular trip requires showers and
electricity due to a wedding ceremony that we must attend. The almighty
curling iron you know...

An initial web search has provided &quot;Tesque RV Campground&quot; 10 miles north of
SantaFe, NM _at_ 505-455-2661

Your help  is greatly appreciated.
