Subject: Re: The Berg and springs

&gt;I wish I had a tach.  I bet what is going on here is that my 3rd gear is
&gt;somehow lower than yours.  If I can't make it up a hill in 4th (and that's
&gt;most of the time :) ) I just chug up it in 3rd at 40 or 45, unless traffic
&gt;is a concern in which case I try to hold 50 - no higher.

&gt;I think this discussion has convinced me I need a tach.  I have been
thinking that instead of paying $70 for that nice VDO tach that everyone
has, I would
&gt;try to find one in a junkyard.  Maybe one from a Porsche 914, but those
&gt;are awfully big.  Has anyone installed a tach from another car into their Van? 
&gt;

David,

Thanks for your light-hearted response, I think we really agree and I'm
afraid I'm getting a heavy tone for no good reason.   I just have found alot
of truth to the Berg school of thought and have seen what I read to be
unjustified ragging on the man.  My apologies. 

I especially agree with your sentiments about a tach.  Though I've spent a
bunch of money so I should never have to worry about over-rev's, I would
really like to know what is going on back there.

Sincerely,
Eugene
