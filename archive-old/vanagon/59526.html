Subject: Re: EV fuel / temp gauge glitch
Date: Thu, 8 May 1997 09:16:27 -0400

The fuel gauge and temperature gauge problem stems from 
some cold solder joints on the circuit board governing
their operation.  EuroVan Update published a procedure on
it in one of their early issues.  I've got it at home, and
will paraphrase it for you this evening.

Essentially, the procedure calls for getting at the circuit
board and reheating the solder connections.  I've got the
same glitch on my 93 EV MV.  I've known of the fix for a
good year or more, and just haven't torn into it yet.

By the way, My EV is about to turn 85,000.  Other than a
air conditioner electromagnetic clutch which siezed up, this
fuel gauge / temp gauge glitch has been virtually the only
trouble this vehicle has given me!

&gt; --   Listees,
&gt; 
&gt;   I know that a couple of you Eurovan owners have had some electrical
problems with 
&gt; your vans, Fuel gauge, temp gauge and tach inop.
&gt; 
&gt;   A person contacted me on these problems and I don't have any answers
for her, I knew 
&gt; that this had been tossed around on the list a while back and I thought
that someone 
&gt; that had these problems and had found a remedy could pass that info on to
her.
&gt; 
&gt;   Thanks Kyle
