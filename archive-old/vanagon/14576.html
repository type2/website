&gt; Like I said, all the beautiful vehicles... Well, Dave I hate to break it to
&gt; you but the nicest piece of vehicular gear you brought along was the drawer
&gt; from the van (in that &quot;je ne sais crois&quot; vivid woodgrain that we all know
&gt; and love) full of camping supplies.  Ya just can't go camping without a
&gt; little piece of the VW experience.  IMHO.

  I'm the first to agree. As I lay freezing in the middle of the night in the
  tent, my air mattress having gone flat, You wouldn't believe how much I was
  wishing for the ersatz woodgrain and orange/green/black plaid of our westy.

  I'll be happy to forget that wagon ever existed, as soon as the '74 is back
  on the road. BTW, I spent over a hundred bucks &lt;!&gt; on gasoline to get that
  thirsty POS wagon to Red Rock and back.
