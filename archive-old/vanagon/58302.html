Subject: Yokohama Y370 Discontinued

Further to Gail's (redwood_at_speedlink_dot_com) message earlier this week
announcing that Yokohama in the US had Y370 LT tires on back order and that
they might never be back in stock:

Yokohama Canada is a client of mine.  I spoke with them today and they
confirmed that the Y370 LT tire was nearing the end of it's product life
cycle.  Apparently it has been in the product line up for 15 years which is
a very long time for tires (this is what they tell me).

In a month or so they will be announcing a entirely new model to replace
it.  My contact there offered to sell me Y370 LTs for CA$84.00.  I politely
declined, as several local tire outlets are selling them for CA$80.00
(US$57.00).
