&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know the 
&gt; 
&gt; law in WA about tracing license plate numbers? I have the number,
&gt; 
&gt; and would like to find the owner and inquire about a purchase. :)
&gt; 

In the past (6-7 years ago), they gave out info about the owner
freely.  They took the inquirer's name/address/phone number, and
if the owner asked, they would be given the info about the people who
had looked up their license plate.

All you have to do is go into DMV and tell them you were a victim
of a hit-and-run, and are trying to look up the owner of the car which
did the dastardly deed.

I was in the office when someone was making a similar request, which is
why I know the answer!
