&gt;&gt;2.  Weigh the car, and take it to the drag races.  Use
&gt;&gt;your quarter mile ET and MPH with one of the following
&gt;&gt;formulas:

&gt;&gt;BHP = (0.00426 * MPH) **3  * weight
        &gt;&gt;HP = (MPH / 234)^3 * Weight
        &gt;&gt;HP = Weight / (ET / 5.825)^3
        &gt;&gt;ET = Cubed root of (Weight / HP) * 5.825
        &gt;&gt;MPH = Cubed root of (HP / Weight) * 234


     I LOVE IT!! With these formulas, we can always blame the engine, not
     the driver for slow 1/4 mile times. For example,a driver who normally
     runs a 12.00 1/4 mile misses a shift point, and records a slower 14.00
     second time. Driver error-NO WAY!! What really happened was the engine
     experienced a sudden and unexpected decrease in horsepower! :)

     In all seriousness, I think I will run these formulas against some
     articles in Road&amp;Track, and see if they pan out.

     Also, I have a marine DYNO in my garage, left over from the days of
     when I owned a boat repair business. I have toyed around with the idea
     of adapting it to VW's, maybe by modifying a tranny case,etc. Just
     another project to deal with....

     BTW, anyone want to buy some boat parts!
