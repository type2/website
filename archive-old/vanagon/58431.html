Subject: lief is an Oil temp guage on an '81... 

Hi all you vanatics,

 I hope that this topic hasn't been beaten to death, but a short answer
reply will suffice so here goes...

 I found a VDO oil temperature guage [VW#321919541A] in a junked
watercooled VW, I think that it was a Rabbit, I forget. Anyway, since it
was from a watercooled I'm wondering if this guage will work on my
aircooled Vanagon. It reads in celsius and goes from 50 to 150 where
there is a red mark. Has anyone used one of these? 
 It sure would save me some dough as I'd only have to buy the sensor
part. Actually I'm not sure which sensor would go with it. If I can use
the sender that was in the Rabbit, than could someone give me and idea
of where it would be? 
 I have a funny feeling that this guage is the same one that would
normally go in an aircooled VW, only it reads in celsius instead of
farenheit. Am I on to something?

 Also the next question would obviously be what temp in celsius would be
normal for a freshly rebuilt 2 liter?

 I got some great responses to my question on aftermarket oil temp
guages, but I haven't had time to look into them. It would save me a lot
of trouble if I could use this litttle beauty. 

TIA,

Noel
