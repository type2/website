Subject: Normal Temperature?

Tim Smith said the temperature needle should &quot;sit over the  LED&quot; on a
steady highway drive.  My '86 Westi (175K miles) temp guage used to sit
over the LED but now sits slighly clear above the LED in normal North
Carolina conditions but rises to cover the little white dot and even higher
sometimes if driven at 65 to 70 in 100 degree Nebraska heat (late July '96)
and the radiator fan comes on HIGH on slowing down.  The temperature then
falls to normal.  The cooling system otherwise seems to be in good
conditions and is properly purged of air.

Is this normal?  What could be the problem?  What do others observe when
their vanagons are driven hard in hot temperatures?

Note: Oil temperature remained at 210 to 220 max under these conditions.
Oil level was kept near the bottom of the operating range.  No aux oil
cooler was used, just the standard water cooled device, 15W50 Mobil 1 oil,
temperaure measured at drain plug.
