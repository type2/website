Subject: Re: gasoline prices


Since the V6anagon (runs on regular unleaded) is still on blocks, I filled
up the Mustang yesterday, after scouring the county for a place that
had lower prices on the Premium it needs/craves. Best one I found that
took Amex, was the Unocal (76) station in Poway, CA, near San Diego:

Unleaded =  $1.459/gal
Mid-grade = $1.569/gal
Premium =   $1.669/gal


Also saw one no-name station that had:

Unleaded =  $1.359/gal
Mid-grade = $1.499/gal
Premium =   $1.599/gal


I've never seen them this high in my life.
End of gripe.
