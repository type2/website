Rusty, All,
	There's a guy here in Christchurch, New Zealand who uses his oval 
beetle as a beach buggy.  You can imagine what all that salt water has 
done to that poor bug.  I got my near mint '56 oval for US$ 800 at an 
auction here 3 years ago.  I guess it is obvious why some people, your 
firewood guy and my beach guy, use these vehicles this way.  So cheap, so 
easy to abuse.  There's a '54 bus for sale here, stored, clean original.  
Any one want me to check into it for them?  Gary Gibson
