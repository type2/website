Subject: air in the brakes?


Hi everyone,

I hope someone can help me because I'm at the end of my rope. I noticed
the other day that there was considerable wetness on the back of the brake
back plate on my 83 westy. I took it apart and sure enough the inside was
soaked with brake fluid and caked on brake dust. I got new shoes and new
wheel cylinders from a FLAPS. I put them on per bentley. I bleed the
brakes and the clutch 4 times and I still cannot find the source of the
problem. I bleed the brakes as described in the bentley but I do not see a
lever on the brake pressure regulator. Does anyone have any ideas? The
pedal just doesn't get firm. I replaced the brake master cylinder and the
clutch master and slave cylinders a couple of months ago. After I bleed
the brakes the pedal is still mushy. I bleed again and air comes out on
the first pump only for each wheel. The front bottoms seem to have air
come out for about 5 or 6 pumps. I think I'm done and the pedal still
feels weak and goes about 3-4 inches from the floor. The clutch works but
the
pedal is soft. I checked for fluid leaks and could find none. I checked
everything that I did and checked the bentley a zillion times. My bleeding
partner said the pedal would feel firm and the get mushy. I don't know
what else to do. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance for any
suggestions.
