Subject: More Parts from the Stash

        I picked up a couple more boxes of parts today.  One box was full of
various and sundry air cleaners, including a couple early bug/bus ones and a
ghia one.  Another was full of jacks and some 25 or 36hp pushrods.

        Another score was a early convertible decklid.  I don't know bugs
that well, but it is consistent with pictures of restored '58-'62 or so
engine lids.  Someone stripped the paint off with chem stripper, but didn't
finish the job.  Has some surface rust due to that, and a couple of small,
poorly bondoed dents.  How much do these puppies go for?  There is also one
that is non-convertible, and in decent shape.

        I'm thinking about hauling all this junk to the next swap meet and
selling everything for $1-$10, just to get rid of it.  Having thrown the
obviously broken stuff away, I have a good sized collection of parts, most
of which are useless to me.
