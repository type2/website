&gt; I just discovered cracks in two of my pipes.  The pipe that connects 
&gt;#4 &amp; #2 accross the back of the engine and the short pipe that connects
&gt;to the Catalytic converter.  The cracks go almost all the way round the
pipes
&gt;so I doubt that welding is possible (??).  Any suggestions for cheap 
&gt;parts?  What is a good price?  And how easy to fix?
&gt;
&gt;

Aftermarket parts are available.  Good FLAPS should be able to get for
you.Should cost around $100 to $120 per pipe.
