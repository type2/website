I use some stuff from my FLAPS called 'Mr. Molly' comes in a tub rather than the
inconvenient tube for the gun (at least inconvenient for this job!)

When i did my 83 diesel vanagon about 2 years/ 20K ago they were
clicking and clacking like all hell. One (right side outer) had some
real nice metal transfer on the balls and races.

I packed them up with a lot of 'Mr Molly' and havent heard a peep from them
since. 

I second advice about wearing old clothes btw!!

CVs are covered in FAQ im sure, but note that you dont have to take them off th
shaft to repack - you can tilt them enough to get the outer race away from the
inner race and the carrier (the holey metal thing) clean out everything with
solvent of choice (i use coleman fuel) and about two whole rolls of paper towels

BTW if i only had a pinhole i would repack and glue a piece of tape over it
but purists will dissent
