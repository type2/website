        In truth, I understand thet these things happen, the station
handeled it pretty well.  Like the service truck mechanic said, it's not the
first time.
        This is the reason that I didn't name the station,  I didn't want to
speak poorly of them for a accident that was corrected.  For the record this
did NOT happen to me at Arnott's Texaco.  For that mater I don't even know
where Union OR is.
        As a statement of confidence that they can now identify my van as a
diesel at this particular station, I will continue to purchase fuel at this
station. (the're getting my money, what else do they want? a smile?)

&gt;If the error is discovered prior to the vehicle being started, there is no
&gt;need to change filters or bleed the fuel lines.  If the vehicle has been
&gt;run with gas in it, then the procedure becomes a little more complex.

        It was discovered prior to starting, I had walked over to record the
fuel consumption.  It still took a couple of hours to take care of.  Oh
well, this is the slow time of year for me.  I had a stack of recent
Tech-pubs that I haden't read yet and my laptop, I was able to sit and not
lose any time at all.
