Subject: Re: 87 Vanagon GL Fuel Starvation on Down Incline/Gas tank overflow

I have a similar problem with our 84.  On my route to work there is  
an on-ramp as part of a cloverleaf which is a descending 270 deg  
right turn.  I have on occasion attempted this with about 10L of  
fuel (my fuel capacity is 60L).  On those occasions our Vanagon has  
stalled with the symptoms of being starved for fuel.

What I have been told by a mechanic is that the fuel tank does not  
have proper compartments which prevent the entire remaining fuel  
from sloshing from side to side.  Since the fuel intake/pump is in  
the rear right and a declining sharp right makes the fuel pile up in  
the front left of the tank, this explanation makes sense.  It still  
doesn't solve the problem though.  If anyone has an alternative  
explanation and perhaps a solution, I'd appreciate it as well.

On another related subject, the PO had the gas tank replaced just  
before we purchased the vehicle.  I can't for the life of me prevent  
the tank from overflowing when filling up, unless I use miniscule  
pressure at the pump.  Does anyone have any pointers as to what, if  
anything, may be wrong.  Or is this a feature?

advTHANKSance.
