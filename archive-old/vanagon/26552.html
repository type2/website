 We used to tow a trailer with up to three motorcycles behind a '72 with 
its 1700cc engine.  No problems mostly.  Well except for bending the heck 
out of the bumper towing the trailer up a logging road in Northern Quebec 
while bouncing up and down a 'gravel' road - that is if 8 inch rocks can 
be called gravel....
