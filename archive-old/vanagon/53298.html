&gt; &gt;-&gt;&gt; err..ahem, none of my business really,  but these ARE two different beings,

&gt; &gt;-&gt;I knew someone would bite at that. :)

&gt; &gt;I'm just curious of their individual masses. The net mass of the two of
&gt; &gt;them is given at 50lb, but that has to be one small girl and a chihuahua.

&gt; Or a good size dog &amp; a Barby doll?

Ok you got me, she's a large barbie doll that I prop up in the front
seat, she does weigh in over 100 lb (remember to never mention your
girlfriend's weight, it will get you in trouble) and takes 8 D cell
batteries. ;)

Man if she reads this, I'm dead!
