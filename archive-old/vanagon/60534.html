Hello everyone,

Could the T4/Eurovan/Caravelle owners on the list who have the 2.5 litre 
engine let me know their preference for manual or automatic transmissions? 
(especially in terms of derivability and service.)

IMHO, I like automatics, but maybe a manual transmission is the way to get 
the most out of the available horsepower.

Thanks,
Matt Dekker
