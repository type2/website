Subject: Parody Stuff

All,

&quot;Why haven't there been any parodies for the last two weeks?&quot; you ask. Lots
of reasons, the first being that I'm going to be moving to Florida at the
end of the month and transferring to another college. (Stetson University
in De Land, Florida; if anyone has any personal knowlege of it or knows
someone who has, I'd love to know.)

However, I've got something even better! If you wander over to
http://www.type2_dot_com/songs, you'll get both a look at the new type2 page
design as well as access to mp3s and text of earlier parodies. Note that
the icons along the left side of the page will NOT necessarily link
anywhere yet until the entire site is converted to the new layout. The new
page layout will be implemented as soon as Ken Hooper completes work on the
next type2 &quot;feature&quot; (which was to have been BOBR, but I haven't heard any
progress reports from him...)

There probably won't be a parody this week, either; I might write one next
week if there's time. (No promises.)

&quot;What's an mp3?&quot; Well, it's a way to encode entire songs (radio or CD
quality) into a file size suitable for downloading. You'll need a player to
play the files, but there are links on the page to players for DOS, Windows
3.x/95, Mac, Linux, and Amiga. Perfect for those of you who have never
heard these songs but don't want to purchase an entire $17 CD. (Since these
files could be taken as copyright violations, however, please buy the CD if
you deem the song good enough.) The mp3 files on this page are not in
stereo to conserve disk space and to discourage people from using these
files exclusively rather than buying the CD.

Please don't abuse this resource. I don't want to have to remove the files
because some lawyer complains...

Feedback welcome, as always.

- J
