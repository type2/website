Subject:       Re: Brake Fluid ??

&gt; The Bently Mannual states that only Dot 4 brake fluid be applied to 
&gt; Vanagons.  Does anyone know the difference between Dot 3 &amp; Dot 4.  I have a 
&gt; ton of Dot 3, can I use it or is that stupid.
Only difference is temperature rating. I used DOT 3 by mistake on my 
Jetta, didn't notice until I got MAJOR brake fade coming down a long 
steep hill onto an offramp. Given the work Vanagon brakes do, I'd 
find the best DOT4 you can - Castrol LMA is said to be good.

&gt; Also, I seem to be losing brake fluid, filled it 1.5 months back and now it 
&gt; need more.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Could it be the lines or is it 
&gt; more likely the brake assembly somewhere?
In every VW I've had, this had been a result of a weeping brake drum 
slave cylinder. Peel back the rubber boot - if it's wet, replace it 
before it gets worse. Also check the clutch slave.
