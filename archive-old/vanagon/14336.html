Subject: RE: WTB: pre 68 Panel Van

I believe that the newly DeLurked Kevin said he had a '67 Panel Parts Bus that
he had no plans for.  You might try to find out where he is.  I seem to
remember that his e-mail was something like kevin6966_at_AOL_dot_com, but have deleted
his original post, so am not too sure (I remember this 'cause I thought about
e-mailing him, but realized my wife would throw a fit if I brought another
beater into the driveway while I am working on my '64 Camper to get it back on
the road.
