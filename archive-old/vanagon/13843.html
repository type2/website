Hello Bill!  I take it you are in Berkeley?  Actually, a Deluxe has just 2 more 
windows in the back, not pop-outs, but the rest of the side windows _are_ pop-
outs.  Plus Deluxes have a chrome emblem, chrome ash trays, and the chrome strip 
that goes around the bus just below the windows.  Sunroofs were options (for 
$200 I understand) on any bus, but I don't have one.  I think you may be 
thinking of a 21 or 23-window bus.


Who else is planning on going to the Kelly Park swap and show on April 9th?

See ya.

Aaron
