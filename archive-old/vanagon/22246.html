A teacher and his family just arrived today from Germany and will be
spending a year here in St.Louis. He would like to buy a Camper very soon,
but is not mechanically inclined, hence is looking for something reliable
and in rather good shape. 

Unfortunately, I didn't follow the for-sale threads (didn't know he was
gonna show up today). Checked the August archives, couldn't see anything
nearby (Midwest), but I could easily have missed some ads. 

BTW, he is not committed to a VW. What's the opinion of this (biased)
crowd about American campers, in particular in terms of reliability. How
do they compare with VWs in terms of $$, maintenance, resale value,
mileage, etc.?

Your help and opinion will be greatly appreciated!

Thanks, 

S.
