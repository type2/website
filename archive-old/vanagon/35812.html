Scott says:
     (snip)
Drawing from my Mech Engineering backgroud, corrosion in automotive 
cooling systems is caused by;
     
&quot; Dissimilar metals in contact with one another through an electrolyte.&quot;
     
The system creates a Galvanic cell with a discharge of electricity and 
the more reactive of the metals becomes a sacrificial anode and is 
eaten (corroded) away.
     
The Facts?
1. The wasserboxer is ENTIRLY aluminiun alloy. 
2. They all seem to have corrosion inhibitor.
     (end snip)

Don't forget another fact. The cylinders are steel, and the corrosion happens 
where the steel surface of the top of the cylinder touches the head, right where
the sealing ring is.
