&gt; &gt; Well, Vroomhilda is giving me more trouble. Situation runs like this:
&gt; 
&gt; If I remember right, Vroomhilda is a `73? or so bus...?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I start it first thing on a cold morning, it runs great. Idles smooth,
&gt; &gt; 	pulls away smooth.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Runs OK for about 5 minutes. After that, it runs OK at speed, but when
&gt; &gt; 	I step off the gas, it dies immediately. Just like I turn the
&gt; &gt; 	key off.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After another 10 minutes, it starts running OK again. Idles, etc. This
&gt; &gt; 	is usually right when I get to work. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I thought initially that it may be the choke, but it seems to be operating
&gt; &gt; 	OK. Mabye (being mexican) it is built for warmer climes, and
&gt; &gt; 	unloads too quickly? If I turn it richer, it is impossible to
&gt; &gt; 	drive until it warms up for five minutes or so. Too long.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there any way to make the choke unload more slowly? I have thought of
&gt; &gt; putting a resistor in line with it, and adjusting it to change the voltage
&gt; &gt; across the heater coil. Measure the heater current, then decrease it ten
&gt; &gt; or fifteen percent?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Could it be something else? Mabye I just need to clean out those carb heater
&gt; &gt; pipes? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;
Just something amazingly simple I did. My '67 would start great, drive
fine, then cut off as soon as Ilet off the gas to stop or turn. It was
horrible; I cranked the idle way up, checked my timing and everything.
Iwas telling a friend, and he said, &quot;oh, it's probably the electronic
fuel cut-off switch&quot; (I think that's the name.)So we checked, and the
wire was slightly loose. BTW, that's the round thing sticking off the
side of the carb with a wire on it. We tightened the wire connection,
and everything was perfect. So make sure all your wires are really on
there tight. Sometimes it's the simple little things that cause the
biggest problems.
