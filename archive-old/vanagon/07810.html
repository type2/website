&gt;         I personally don't like the pancake heaters, they are huge, and the 
&gt; massive surface area coupled with air flow/slush etc under the van means 
&gt; that they lose most of their heat before it even gets to the inside. It was 
&gt; a half-assed solution to getting extra heat to the defrosters for stop and 
&gt; go traffic and during warmup. Lousy altogether for camping.

My '79 has a steel plate under the belly, which protects the heater from the
elements.  The plate covers the area between the parallel chassis bars, and
runs the length of the center floor area.  You might try to find one of these
to keep salt and crud from destroying your heater.

My heater really puts out the heat.  It's a 6500W Bosch unit.  If only it
wasn't so smoky. :-(.  Works fine when you're parked, as well.  Just turn on 
the timer before you head out for the morning commute.
