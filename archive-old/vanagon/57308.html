Howdy -

I've been wondering what other people do to hold down their rear 
license plate door to check the oil?  

Did VW get better in later years and actually provide some way to 
hold the door down?

I use my foot to hold open the door when checking the oil.  

When adding oil, adjusting timing, etc. I use a piece of wire shaped 
for the purpose to hook from the underside of the bumber to the top of
the door.  I store it on top of the hinge, bent slightly to keep it from 
sliding off.

I tried wedging the oil cap between the door bottom and bus back, but 
this is not an option when checking timing, and it didn't hold the 
door open far enough for my tastes.
