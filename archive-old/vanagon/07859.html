Subject: Stuck oil plug, 85 Vanagon

Well people, is there anyway to drain oil without using the drain plug?  
Mine was hopelessly buggered and I just broke the Easy Out in the thing 
(after all that drilling upside down).

Anyone ever tried sucking the oil out of the sump?  What did you use (not 
the breast pump again...)  Or perhaps any new ideas on getting it out, I 
don't think I can drill anymore, expecially with the broken Easy Out in 
the hole that is there.  This thing must have been put on with a bloody 
impact wrench.--
