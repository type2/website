&gt; Please someone post instructions on how to recieve the VANAGON maillist as
&gt; a digest and not each message individually.  This is driving me nuts!
&gt;
&gt; ObVW: My '76 Camper (2.0 FI) passed NC inspection this week with flying
&gt; colors.  Best line by mechanic/inspector: &quot;Hell, you could LIVE in this
&gt; thing&quot;.  Planning to drive it to the NC coast (3 hour drive) next weekend.
