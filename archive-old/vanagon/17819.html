This is what I've also used, comes in the can with a brush attached attached to
the cap.  This stuff spreads so thin as to be non-existent, but provides a nice,
yet breakable, seal.  Never hardens, quantity oulasts the can or your ability to
open it (it IS a sealant, and it tends to seal the cap on).  Absolutely
impervious to solvents, so it makes a mess that won't clean up wherever you put
it.  But at least you can get the Permatex off your hands with the Sta-Lube
waterless soap.

Just MHO.
