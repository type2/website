&gt;Well done Alistair.  &lt;bowing&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Clutching the three bibles 
&gt;To my chest;
&gt;Haynes, Bentley, and Muir.
&gt;Filled with thoughts, saintly and totally pure;
&gt;Ready to test,
&gt;That the bus's troubles weren't trifles.
&gt;
&gt;--Ralf
&gt;

Nice poem...but if H, B, and M are the three bibles, 
then what is &lt;eek!&gt; Chilton?

Wondering aimlessly,
Joachim
