Subject: Re: Tires again! Please help!!!!

Tim , I have these on a Riken wire mag(black spokes w/polished edges looks
like a Jap BBS copy) 5.5&quot; x14&quot; w/5x112 bolt pattern.I put studs on the front
discs and used chrome acorn nuts all around.Had them on for 12 years.I tried
185x14,205 70 14,225 60x14 and lastly 235-60-14.They are the best.A lot of
meat and 6 ply = no wander, and cheap.and they stick and are prrimo in the
snow...what a sales pitch...but true.Best darn tires my bus ever had.Im
looking for a good 16&quot; rim for my syncro
