&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; but wasn't Rocinate the burro (jackass) that Don Quixote rode around on??? :)
&gt; 
&gt; Ding,Ding,Ding  We have a winner
&gt; EXACTLY why I chose the name.  While others saw a broken down and 
&gt; crippled old nag, the (totally mad) Don Quixote saw the finest steed in 
&gt; the land.  I've been accused of having the same ideas towards my bus. :)
&gt; We call her Rosa (roll the r) for short.
&gt; 
I always thought it was for the Rocinante, the inter-galactic spaceship,
in the RUSH song CYGNUS X-1 (parts 1 &amp; 2)...
Nothing like a bus for space travel...
