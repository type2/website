Subject: Still looking for man. trans. for wasserboxer

About a year ago I was contemplating buying an engineless '85 non GL ( vinyl
seats etc.) Vanagon w/ an auto trans, for parts. the body was pretty beat, and
someone had already been using it for parts- which is why it was sans engine.
Anyway I never followed up on it, and never bought it. ( got too many cars
sitting around here that I don't have the time to deal with already!!)  When I
was thinking of buying it though, someone that I know that has an '84 with a bad
AT ( he still has a bad AT) asked me what I'd sell the auto trans for.  Since
the AT's are harder to find - good ones - I told him around 350-400 if I would
take it out for him and deliver it to him. I would have sold It for less if it
were a manual trans.  I really can't believe the prices some listmembers want
for their manual transmissions. ( the worst I got was 800 dollars plus
shipping!) I mean, Really!

Ok, folks, here I go again.  And I'll rephrase it this time.
Does anybody out there have a REASONABLY PRICED manual trans. for a waterboxer
they'll sell me??
I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks,     chris
