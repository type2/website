Subject: Tachometer/fuel gauge probs

Hi All,

I've got an '85 Westy and have been having off and on problems with all
the gauges on the right side of the drivers instrament panel, including
the Tachometer &amp; fuel guage.  They just quit working all together and all
at once.  They used to come back within a few moments, but now have been
out going on three weeks.  Estimating my gas usage is driving me
crazy!  The guages on the left side with the speedometer still work fine
and are unaffected by this.  Anyone else had this problem or have any
ideas on the best way to repair it. 

Thanks,
Ivan  '85 Westy
