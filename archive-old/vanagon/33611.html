Subject: Re:  Solar Battery Chargers

     Been seeing quite a bit of activity on this thread, so I thought I'd 
     add my 2 cents worth.  This is based on about 15 years experience in 
     mucking around with solar energy devices and concepts - 
     
     1)  The dashboard units are useful to keep the battery on an inactive 
     vehicle charged up - but there are limits.  
     
     -  They won't provide adequate power for running RV accessories 
        (lights, heater fan, radio, etc) - or even for supplementing an 
        already charged battery.
     
     -  They can overcharge a battery - especially if left connected for 
        lengthy periods in hot, sunny climates like AZ, So CA, etc.
     
     2) If you want to supplement the RV accessory capability of your van, 
     get one (or more) of the commercially available solar power modules.  
     These are typically about 2'wide x 4'long x 1.5&quot;thick.  They provide 
     around 50 watts of power under reasonable sunlight (12V _at_ ~ 4 amps).  
     There are two types of these modules, regular and self-regulating.  
     The regular modules are intended to be used in large multiples, with a 
     controller unit to regulate voltage, battery charging, etc.  The 
     self-regulating modules are intended to be used singly or in small 
     multiples, connected directly to the battery and load with no control 
     or regulation.  The self-regulating modules are a little less 
     effecient, because they have more internal resistance.  This holds the 
     open circuit voltage down and reduces the possibility of overcharging. 
      
     I have used one of the self-regulating modules on a F*rd van and on a 
     pop-up tent camper.  On the van, I clamped the module to the luggage 
     rack.  On the camper, I used bungee cords to hold the module down.  
     You need to be sure the module is secured, otherwise the wind will 
     blow it off the roof of your RV.  You also may need to use standoffs 
     to hold the module a bit away from any flat surface.  Otherwise heat 
     buildup under the black module can cause problems for the module and 
     for the surface it sits on.  
     
     On the pop-up camper, before I got the module, I used to be able to 
     camp out for 2.5-3 nights before the on-board RV battery ran down. 
     After I got the module, this would stretch out to 5-6 days in the 
     spring and fall (when we would use the heater) and even more in the 
     summer.  It was terrific!  (These figures assume starting out with a 
     fully-charged RV battery.)
     
     The module was on the expensive side ($400 at the time), but this was 
     very competitive with the prices of the small, noisy, smelly, heavy 
     gasoline generators that were available at the time.  It was also very 
     preferable to using my truck's alternator to charge the RV battery  It 
     turned out to be the best possible solution to our RV needs - no 
     noise, no pollution, just &quot;free&quot; power.  I even thought about adding a 
     second module, but after due consideration, decided not to - it turned 
     out that I would have had to add a second battery to store the 
     available power.  
     
     I'd be glad to answer anyone's questions regarding this subject to the 
     best of my ability.  Please e-mail to jonesl_at_tcplink.nrel_dot_gov or to
