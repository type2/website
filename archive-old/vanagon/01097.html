&gt; BTW, does anyone up north in Canada have a Syncro with the water-heating

I use about an 8200 BTU propane heater by Olympian. I hang it on my 
refrigertaor door (1985 westy). Works VERY well in snows at Tahoe. Has 
thermostatic control so it goes on and off automatically.

I saw a guy with a neat set up one time in Big Sur.

He would put a simple clay flower pot over a burner on the stove..upside 
down. The heat aggregates and is stored in the clay, and gives a steady 
heat for a long time.
