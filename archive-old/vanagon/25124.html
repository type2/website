Sitting as is my custom in a local coffee house I remarked to the fellow with
the immaculate shoei painted to match his immaculate 92 GS100PD BMW dual 
sport, &quot;ride much, I see you commuting once in a while?&quot;  The talk turned to
his fave haunt Baja Mexico.  He's gots lots hours down there recently and lots
of recommendations for places to go AND some videos of his faves he'd loan 
us to look at or meet at Helvetica in Sacto,CA to talk and learn.  He's of 
Coyote's persuasion and a hell of a nice fellow with a beautiful Paris-Dakar.

So should the tfab and sjohnson and alf take him up on a feeshtaco or some 
coffee and hear his tales or?
