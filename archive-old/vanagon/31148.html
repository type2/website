Subject: Leakin' oil

&gt;A bigger worry is the amount of oil leaking I'm getting.  After parking at
&gt;home, I noticed a trail of dime-sized oil spots behind the Bus showing 
where
&gt;I had driven it, still wet.  Underneath, a spot of leakage (from last night
&gt;and today) more than a foot square.  Is this even too much leakage for a
&gt;Bus?  (I checked the level and it doesn't seem unusually low, but you can 
be
&gt;sure I'll be keeping a close eye on it for a while.)

&gt;I had EXACTLY this happen to my '69 bus in Colorado, especially when
&gt;coming to a stop at a stop sign. Turned out to be a mostly-shredded main
&gt;oil seal (yup-- the one around the crankshaft just inside the flywheel,
&gt;that you have to take the engine out to get to).

&gt;On many engines, you need only replace this seal and go merrily on your
&gt;way. But occasionally (and in my case) it's caused by the crankshaft
&gt;moving forward and back as you press the clutch. And THAT is caused &gt;by
thecrank's thrust bearing seat being badly worn-- usually so much so &gt;that
youcan no longer adjust it out by shimming the flywheel as per the &gt;normal
procedure. And THAT means that not only do you have to rebuild &gt;the entire
engine, but you also have to shell out extra for a new crankcase, &gt;since the
one you have is shot and can't be salvaged.

Well I certainly hope this isn't the problem w/mine (it's a '79.)  We'll
wait and see.  It's still dribbling oil like a seive though. . .I poured a
1/2 quart in while it was running and it seemed to mostly come right out
again.  Looks like the La Brea Tar Pits underneath the engine now. . .
