Subject:  re: Tools 

Just a quick note on the Craftsman tool thread. Someone mentioned
Snap-Off. They are great. I have inheritted some from my brother, 
and they seem indestructable. Both my brothers are mechanics, and
both eventually went to Snap-On as their tools bit the dust.
Second best tools in the world. Of course the best is ViceGrips
or as my brothers call them Fits-All-Fucks-All.
