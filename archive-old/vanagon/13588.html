Subject: re: Kombis


!!I had also assumed that Kombis had only three of
_at__at_the square windows along the side, while Microbusses (Deluxe and
##otherwise) had four (plus the most excellent corner ones pre-'64).  Ja?

Lessee.  I've got a sliding window on my sliding door, an identical 
sliding window opposite it (behind driver); window further back on 
driver's side has one vent-flap style window, opposite it (behind sliding 
door) has a solid piece of glass.  

Hmmmm.
