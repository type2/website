Subject: Interesting ads


Found a couple ads while wiling away my lunch hour. FYI

Hemmings has a 52 bus in Kansas for $5000. Runs, but needs 
total restoration. I'll send phone # via e-mail if interested. It's at home.

&gt;From on-line sources:

Email Address: bgtx_at_murlin_dot_com Description: 3 VW Type 2 gas heaters. 
$100.00 each 

Email Address: fax (619)244-2218
Description: New Old Stock VW Parts:  
I am currently marketing a huge find of air cooled
parts located in Venezuela. Included are parts for
TYPE I,II,IIIand IV and are mostly parts no longer avalible. Many of the 
quantities are in the thousands. To properly give a perspective on how 
large this find is consider enough parts to cover a football field! The 
parts are currently being priced and counted. Lists are avalible on 
request as well as photos.
Location: Hesperia CA USA

If anyone checks out #3, above, I'd be curious. (I'd also be cautious!)

Thanks! Joe
