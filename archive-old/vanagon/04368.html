&gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front

&gt; flowing or warm the bus up?

And I finally reply:
I have one more theory to add to this thread.  Is it possible that
this is like the recirculation control on an air conditioning system?
It would work something like this... Fresh air vents closed, door
panels open, heater on.  Then the source of air *into* the heat
exchangers will be prewarmed air from the cabin so that things will
get nice and toasty?

And on another note.  Martha, I found that in my 1981 ALL of the
heater control cables had stretched (over time I guess).  So I
readjusted them by opening the dash (ash tray and glove box).
unclamping the cables and adjusting.  This radically changed the
amount of heat I was getting.  The most important ones to readjust,
IMHO, are the heater control flaps on the regulators just downstream
from the heat exchangers.  Finally the one of the regulators had an
incredibly stiff spring.  It was difficult to move the blue lever all
the way to the right, and then it would gradually edge back towards
the middle position.  I solved this problem by putting in a rusty old
regulator from a breadloaf.  It works great now.
