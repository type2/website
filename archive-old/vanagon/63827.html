Subject: Re: Beach Vanagons and a window slider question

&gt;      there's a screw or two inside those buggers, but I can't figure out 
&gt;      how they disassemble.  Do they &quot;fall&quot; apart when the window is 
&gt;      removed?  

There's a single screw that is accessible from the  bottom.  You need 
some sort of flexible or right angle flat blade screwdriver to get it 
out.  A mechanic's mirror helps to see what you're doing.  I didn't 
have one of those screwdrivers, so I bent up a big bobby-pin and 
unscrewed it that way.  Once you get that out, the latch falls off 
along with the spring.  Then you have access to the parts that go 
through the window, which are held on by 2 screws.  

Regards,
