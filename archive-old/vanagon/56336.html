Subject: big news


&gt;As an avid cyclist, there is a big debate over low cost mail order vs
&gt;mom and pop bike shops.  I see a similar problem with Ron's business.

Speaking as someone who has been self employed since 1969 -- including some
time in mail order, and several years owning a &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; bicycle shop in
Flagstaff, AZ, I want to comment on this.  The above statement implies that
a business can be either mom &amp; pop or mail order.

In fact, the same business can be both, and it sounds to me like that is
the case with Ron's.  If you want to make a distinction between local (any
size) and mail order (any size), I think that would be a valid point.

As a businessman in a small town, I try hard to support my friends and
neighbors who have local businesses.  Since I have maybe the only air
cooled Vanagon in town, the local NAPA doesn't have much I need, so I'm
going to give Ron's mom &amp; pop mail order VW parts a try.
