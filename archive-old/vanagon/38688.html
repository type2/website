Subject: Re: Lug nuts and mirrors


&gt;Further 12 year woes, the right mirror went limp.  A hex lug bonded into the
&gt;plastic housing pulled out.  My assumption is this is not repairable.  Two
&gt;possibilities for repair would be 24 hour epoxy, or super glue.  Has anyone
&gt;ever tried either on a mirror repair?
&gt;
ref. the mirrors - don't bother trying to glue the hex stud; been there,
done that, didn't work.  I ended up drilling a 1/8&quot; hole right through the
whole mirror assembly (obviously after re-seating the hex stud), then I
drove in a 1/8 roll pin (1&quot; long, preferably stainless steel).  Did this on
my '87 about 6 years ago, no further problems.
