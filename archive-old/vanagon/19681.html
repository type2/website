Subject: glow plug sender relay
Date: Mon, 26 Jun 1995 11:18:06 -0600 (MDT)

Hello vanagon gang,
Have any of you diesel people out there changed your glow plug sender
relay?  I believe mine is faulty since my glow plugs do not come on when
the engine is only slightly warm.  Could you tell me how much VW wants for
the relay?
On the other hand, is there anything bad that will happen if I simply
disconnect the wire from the sender relay?  That way, my glow plugs will
always light, at least.  But, can this hurt my engine?
Stuart Hutton
