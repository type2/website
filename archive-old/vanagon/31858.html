&gt;I got no sleep last night.  Can you tell?

Hey, Happy B-day Gerry!!  Thanks for providing this wonderful list, you will
be rewarded in heaven...but until then you will suffer like all
mortals--however you will at least have your vanagon to give you comfort
(which is more than some Chr**tler owners can say).

&lt;Lengthy quoted cookie story follows&gt;  ;-)

And now, for something completely different,  the VW content:

I'm curious about the various styles of stock front tire mounts for bay
window buses.  I have an aftermarket mount on my 71 (the type where the
hubcap side of the rim faces the sheetmetal on the front of the bus).  The
mount is attached to the bus via large bolts and has studs protruding which
the spare is secured to via nuts.

I've seen pictures of another type of mount which allows the hubcap side of
the rim to face forward.  Is this also an aftermarket variation or is this
original equipment/stock?
If anyone out there is familiar with this type of mount I'd be curious about
it's originality, what it looks like, and how it attaches.
