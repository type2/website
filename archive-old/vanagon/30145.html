&gt;For those of you who have replaced their VW radios, what kind did you get, and
&gt;more importantly, where did you put speakers, other than the stock mount.
&gt;I would like to add a digital tuner, and a tapedeck or cd player, as the
&gt;radio stations are too close together for a non digital tuner, and one does
&gt;not have to drive far to lose the station.

&gt;PS this is for the Westy.

Well, when I bought my Westy it had a Blaupunkt deck and 4 6&quot; speakers.  The
speakers are not car speakers.  They are small stereo speakers with brakets
to mount on walls.  There are 2 mounted under the dash and 2 mounted in the
rear on either side of the top cabinets.  The speakers are pretty cheap so I
may get better ones sometime in the future but their location is pretty good.
