Subject:      pre-friday jab at the Unknowns ...

as you can see below, we've kept pretty close to 100 Buses, but we are
slightly deficient in Microbuses!! we need one or two more to make a nice
round 50!! so let's drop the disguises, folks ... turn that Unknown into
a Microbus (or whatever)!  do it today! :)

and before you get all bent out of shape about the eurovans ... one guy
dropped off who had two buses and one was a eurovan ... but i forgot to
'fix' his entry. so it looked like 12 but was really only 11, now that i
found it. :(  so we need another eurovan as well.
