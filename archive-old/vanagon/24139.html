&gt;I don't know about cherries.  But Ralph Nader is the bloke responsible for

&gt;my Bus is, ahem, getting &quot;maintenanced. ;-)

Been there, done that, 1968 Chevrolet Corvair Monza Convertable, NOT cherry,
found out after I bought it just how much rust and bondo it REALLY had.
 Windshield leaked and shorted out the instruments in the dash.   Massive out
leak to the tune of 1 quart to every 20 miles.

It was fun though when I took it in to McQuicks Oil Change one time and they
brought the oil drain to the fron and looked up and got this &quot;where the hell
is it?&quot; look on their faces. ;-)  And going to a store and put the stuff in
the trunk in the front.

The thing did handle great though even with bias ply tires.

Oh, well.  Enough for the Chevrolet, back to the Volkswagens!  :-)
