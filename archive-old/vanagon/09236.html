Subject: Re: How to Replace Tach Light??
Date: Wed, 4 Jan 95 8:31:45 EST

&gt; Simple problem, looks like a difficult answer. The light on my Tach went 
&gt; out and my '86 Owner's manual tells me how to replace almost every other 
&gt; light on the vehicle EXCEPT the instrument lights. 
&gt; It would SEEM tobe simple, but... is it? 
&gt; and if so, how?

The bulb is part of a black plastic holder that twists into place. These
may only be available at your dealer.

Take off the instrument cowling and you will see little black plastic
items sticking up about 3/8&quot;. There should be one on the speedometer side
and one on the tach side. Unscrew the plastic item and you will be
holding the bulb in your hand.

I had to replace the light on my clock so I had to remove the
instrument pod to get to it.

You'll see that is quite easy once you recognize the bulbs.
