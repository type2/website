Subject: died, barely runs

The weirdest thing just happened -  I finally got my garage cleaned out
enough to put both the VW and the car in it. (Which is weird enough I guess
but wait there's more!) When I pulled the VW into it, I was jockeying it
around trying to move it to the side, when it just suddenly sputtered and
died. And refused to start back up. Had to push it the rest of the way so I
can close the door!

I opened it up, checked things out - distributor was tight, no obvious fuel
leaks, no obvious loose wires. Got in and cranked it some more, it was
&quot;trying&quot; to catch but just wouldn't. Almost sounded like it was mistimed.
Finally it did, but I had to keep the engine revs up around 2K rpm to keep
it running. And when I used my hand to hold the gas pedal steady, the
engine was revving up and down by itself. When I let it go, it would die
again.

This engine was just put back in a couple of weeks ago, but I took it for a
couple of road trips soon after to see how it behaved - fine then. Has a
new coil, points &amp; plugs too.

The fact that it would run at all makes me think the spark is okay. I'm
thinking that something is in the fuel line or somehow the FI is screwed
up. Particularly mystifing is why it would be revving up and down (just a
couple of hundred RPM)
by itself.

It has been sitting outside, where its going through the normal daily
temperature range right now - 40F to 60F. Pretty high humidity. Maybe
condensation somewhere?

Anyway, its a mystery so far. I'm going to start poking around tomorrow and
see what I can figure out. Any clues would be appreciated though!
