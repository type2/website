Subject: Back Again!

ListGoers;
    Last summer I was subscribed to this list and it was of immeasurable help
and a unique source of hilarity&lt;Fridays&gt;. I was also able to meet folks via
letters.&lt;Hi Ric Golen!! How's that sassy Bug runnin'? Still supercharged??
Please e-mail me if you can- I'd like to get back in touch with you!!&gt;
   Since last summer I've moved from Mass. to Colo. and really wanna hook up
with other folks on this list who might live locally. I'm in Grand Junction,
Western slope of the Rockies. I am not all that familiar with this area and
would really appreciate some VW information from people who love them, not
just see them as forms of transport, and, like most shop owners, as a means
of ripping vw owners off.
    Anyone?? I especially am looking for a good. local body shop and parts.
Thank you, all. Hope to hear from you soon!
Rachel &amp; Ramona&lt;---made it across country in one month! lil' hang-ups and
delays to be explained and shared later. Suffice to say that VW, as a corp.
is heartless, shockingly untrained to maintain the components they warranty
and install. NEVER again will I deal with them or any of their &quot;authorized
dealers.&quot;
