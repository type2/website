Subject: Syncro on Dynamometer (for emissions)

I just noticed the following in Bentley:

+--
CAUTION SYNCRO TRANSMISSIONS

When checking engine performance, only use dynamometer designed to brake all 
four wheels at the same time.
+--

Emissions testing here in Seattle involves putting the vehicle on a 
dynamometer to do the testing. You drive into the test bay and put your 
front or rear wheels on these big steel rollers which allows the testing to 
be done under load. I've never seen one that is set up for all-wheel drive 
vehicles. What gives? Do you have go to some special test center or 
something? Should I be at all concerned that they will screw something up if 
I take my (soon to be mine, anyway) syncro in for the obligatory test 
required to transfer the title?
