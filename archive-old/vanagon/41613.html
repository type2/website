Subject: Water Pumper Head Corrosion (fwd)

Actually, I've heard of this approach being used also to stop body rust
on cars.  Could be of interest to us folks.  I'd probably pay for that
:)

&gt; 
&gt;  Back in my past, we used to put this solar panel and a battery
&gt; out in the wilds on pipe lines to prevent corrosion. A few milli-
&gt; amps at a couple volts into the pipe would stop the material migration.
&gt;  I don't own a water pumper but I've heard about them from some of 
&gt; the other members. And the price of heads. 
&gt;  What seems to be happening is a galvanic action caused by heat and 
&gt; dissimilar metals. I don't think this would be happening if the heads
&gt; were not isolated electricly from the block. 
&gt;  I propose a ground strap at least, from head to cylinder body, 
&gt; neutralizing any electrical imbalance. If nothing else it seems to me
&gt; it would cause pitting around elect. connection. 
&gt;  This is just a thought guys, maybe some of you electron hounds can
&gt; make something of it.     west
&gt; 
&gt;  of course if it works, you'll never know!
