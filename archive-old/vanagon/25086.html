Subject: Re: win prizes! name that noise!

&gt;hello everyone, here's my problem of this week (81 adventurewagen):
&gt;
&gt;a chirping noise, only when engine has warmed (after driving a few
&gt;minutes).  the noise is most apparent at lower rpms in 1st and 2nd, but i
&gt;can sometimes hear it in 3rd and at higher rpms in 1st and 2nd. i have not
&gt;heard it in 4th.  the noise is not apparent when the van is not in gear, i.e.,
&gt;revving in neutral does not produce it.  occasionally the noise will be
&gt;present for a split second when the engine first starts.  after i have been
&gt;cruising on the highway for awhile, the noise disappears (won't occur at
&gt;lower gears/rpms), and sometimes reappears (at lower gears/rpms). 
&gt;fwiw, a compression test 6,000 miles ago revealed 110-125 psi on all
&gt;four cylinders.  also, i have been using a lighter weight oil (10w-30)
&gt;cause that's what was in it when i got it and i'm just using what was left
&gt;of a case :-0.  (next oil change gets 20w-50).
&gt;
&gt;i originally thought it was an exhaust leak, but that doesn't explain the
&gt;intermittent nature, unless i'm missing something.  
&gt;
&gt;i was planning on finally taking my summer vacation next week, and
&gt;would like to figure this out/take care of it if i need to before then.  any
&gt;suggestions on what to check out would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;TIA, matthew
&gt;

The fact that the noise disappears when you are out of gear makes me think
it is one of the clutch bearings (throughout or pilot bearing). Does it
change when you slowly engage/disengage the clutch?
