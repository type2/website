&gt;As for oil temp, David Schwarze and I agree that the best place is the oil
&gt;galley pickup; unfortunately the adapter needed is for a 914....so this
&gt;may be expensive or a junk yard item. David C.

What about the type oil filler blockoff?  I was thinking tabout tapping the 
plate, and installing it there.  What do y'll think?
