&gt;To All:

&gt;Would anyone care to flesh out this idea?

&gt;-Bob

I agree with the concept, but it has already been partially
done.  One more shameless plug...NEATO and LiMBO have their
annual TTT directory of fellow-members who will help bus
owners across the country.  About 400 of them this year.
The directory includes just a first name and a telephone
number, by Country, State, City.

That said, I have a tow bar with (splittie) bumper brackets
already attached.  I just unbolt the front bumper of the
disabled bus and bolt my bar to the frame in the same place.
Presto, ready to tow.  Also have &quot;extra&quot; lights which I run
along the underside of the body and clamp on the back.

My barn is not heated, but it's carpeted, out of the wind
and rain, and has enough tools to do most basic repairs.

Willing to help, but why would anyone be in northern
Illinois if they could avoid it?
