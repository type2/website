&gt; Exactly what does &quot;had spitzen sparken on the aux battery circut&quot; mean?
&gt; That is, did the battery just start smoking?

Oops, I'v been thinking bout this stuff so much lately I guess i 
figured everyone else was as well . 

I have an aftermarket battery circut (now disabled). The p.o. put a 
gold aluminum wigit with two terminals on it in the engine 
compartment. One terminal was connected to the alternator via a 
relay, the other was spliced into the Battery Positive lead that 
would, under ordinary circumstances connect to the alternator. This 
arrangement brought the second battery in serial with the primary 
one. In trying to wrestle with the air filter assembly, I accidently 
grounded a piece of the mounting bracket (or somthing) on the 
alternator.  Hence spitzen sparken, scary but brief, very brief. as 
far as I can tell no fuses were tripped. Tomorrow, I plan to verify 
the functionality of the injectors, the voltage to the injection 
system and the grounds that pertain. 
Thanks for the heads up

Steve
