Subject: RE: Bone yards near upstate NY? Need sway bar ('82 vanagon).

Clarkies in Saratoga still has two Vanagons, I think, but the links you
broke go fast.  Still got the broken one?  Have it drilled for a 3/8 inch
bolt and reuse it.  Works great.  The link will come off with soapy
water -- just pull it over the knob on the end of the sway bar.  See the
archives for more on this: I got the idea from another lister, probably
about 1994.  Email me direct if you need more info.
