&gt;I hope someone can answer this.  I need to front tires for
&gt;my '91 GL and have been to the local Michelin shop here in
&gt;Sacramento.  He says the tires for the vanagon 205/70 R MXL's
&gt;(reinforced) are on back order and can only be ordered 2 at
&gt;a time.  Has anyone else had problems getting these tires?

i 'heard' that michelin was not making them any more, but that was from
one dealer who seemed much more interested in selling what he had on his
shelf than what i wanted. the 2 at a time is probably just some way to
get more money. check at other dealers, if possible.

&gt;Is there a good substitute?  I vaguely remember reading something
&gt;about Continentals.

my personal opinion is: STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM CONTINENTALS!! :)  i don't
like them. every set (three sets) i had was trouble. they take a 'set' really
quick and will wear 'wrong' even though you get the alignment fixed.

some folks tell me they have had good luck with light truck tires (load
range C). don't know what they sound like on the highway.
