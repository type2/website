Subject: Vanagon Gas Tank Alternatives

Volks, 
I have read all the posts on gas tank lists and have found some possible
alternative gas tanks commercially available for the racing industry. In
the Summitt Racing catalog (obtain one by calling 800-230-3030) there
are at least 2 fuel &quot;cells) offered at good prices. These are
polyethylene tanks in various gallon sizes, (there is a 16 gallon) set
to go with all fittings for as little as $101.00. The premium cell or
tank is $158.00 and a mounting for either is only $20.00. There would be
shipping but no tax on this in all states except OH. These tanks wold
have to be fitted with necks to accept the fueling hose as they have
aircraft style caps with them flush mounted. This mod should not be
difficult. The vent lines and gas lines are all there. Tank leakers take
a look!
