Subject: Splitties from Heaven (long)

Man, what a week!  Monday I picked up the microfiche from the defunct 
former VW dealer (not as many as I had hoped, but it did include a big 
box of printed material).  That afternoon I receive a call from a former 
club member (now into military vehicles) who was in a small town and had 
spotted a 23-window Deluxe.  He said that it was complete except for a 
motor, middle seat and title.  He gave me the guy's number and I called 
that evening.  The guy had just unloaded the Bus that day.  He had gotten 
it from a buddy who had bought a rail buggy and the Bus was included in 
the package.  Since the buddy didn't have a use for it (or a place to 
store it), he *gave* it to the guy.  I asked him if he was willing to 
sell it and he said that he was.  He only wanted the tranny out of it to 
build a buggy.  I told him that I had a '72 Bus tranny (IRS) that would 
be better suited for a buggy application (he agreed) and that I would 
trade him that towards the Bus.  When I asked him how much more he needed 
for the trade he replied &quot;Oh, just the axles to go with that '72 tranny.&quot;

So it appears that I have a '62 or '63 23-window Deluxe Microbus in 
exchange for a tranny that I would have sold for $50.  It doesn't end 
there ...

I, too, saw the ad for the free '58 Bus in Oklahoma and was fortunate 
enough to be the first to reply.  I was concerned with the logistics of 
retreiving a Bus that is 450 miles away (having to borrow a trailer and a 
truck to pull it with).  When I mentioned that I was in Springfield, 
Missouri, the guy in Oklahoma (call him &quot;Duck&quot;) stated that Springfield 
was the home of his favorite place, Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World.  Well, 
I just happen to work for Bass Pro and I hinted as to when he might be 
coming this direction.  It must be my week, 'cause he said that he would 
just borrow a car hauler and deliver that Bus to my door (because it had 
been over a year since he was at Bass Pro and this was, apparently, a good 
excuse to come). 

I can't get the SEG off of my face.  I'd better go buy a lottery ticket.  
If I win the 55 mil, it's Busses for everyone!
