Subject: RE: Famous VW owners


&gt;    Jusr remembered Jack (euthanasia) Kevorkian has a sweet breadloaf,
&gt;69 I think.  This is the last thing to be seen by many of his patients.
&gt; The media portrays this as a sad pitiful place to go, but what does
&gt;the media know anyhoo? :-[]
&gt;
&gt;P.S this was not posted to start osme philisophical debate over
&gt;euthanasia on the VW list.


How about clever jokes about the usefulness of heater box leaks?   :^)
This, combined with the hemp-for-fuel thread, could get interesting.

Is it Friday yet?
