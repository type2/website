Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome

Steven,

This stuff is only good for real chrome (y'know, the stuff with a metal 
substrate)....  not ersatz chrome (on plastic substrate)!!

    Jon

So Jon Peters/UB Networks says:
&gt; 
&gt; BRENDAN,
&gt; 
&gt; Use Brasso....  be careful not to get it on anything else... it stains.  It 
&gt; works very well without all of the fine scratches from scouring!
&gt; 
&gt;      Jon

Hey Jon,

Well this stuff work on the chrome that's on the plastic grill over the
radiator opening?  Or am I kidding myself.
