Subject: Re: Vanagon motor swap???

Jim Davis seeks more info re: Kennedy Engineered Products and their Vanagon
V-6 adapter.  I've been very pleased with them (altho they are no relation).
I've used two of their flywheels, which have had Porsche crank mounts and
the rest Vanagon-shape.  They do each order to spec, no shelf stock, and the
parts are beautiful and fit fine.  Jim, you might see if KEP would give you
the names of some V-6 conversion customers.  If the customers are like me, 
they'll be willing to talk endlessly about their swaps.
