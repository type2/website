Subject: Re: bungee cord question

Ann Landers forwarded a question from Eric Oster (ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu)
in Washington state asked:

Dear Rusty,

&gt;How long does a tranny usually last when you start with the bungees?
&gt;The one on my `66 just completely lost fourth, after only 200 miles
&gt;or so of a bungee.


It depends on how clean a life you lead. Mine lasted years! ;) The technique
is to stuff one end of the bungee between the bottom and back of a bench
seat and hook it to the rear edge of the seat bottom and hook the other end
on to the stick shift to hold it into fourth or second gear.

Actually there is no definitive number of miles. The bungee (legally/saftey
wise) should not be used at all. I told myself that I was going to use it as
a last resort. It actually lasted about two months-long enough to develop a
folk reputation as the &quot;Rusty fourth.&quot; The tranny decided to fail when I was
on the other side of Egypt visiting mom. It was a delightful 35mph 4500rpm
drive home in rush our traffic. Although I jest about the kidding about the
rpms-I was truly limited to 3rd gear and about 30-35mph. Outside of lawyers,
a good number of folks have been known to employ this technique until fourth
is totally gone or until the reqired funds are saved for a proper tranny
rebuild. Ususally it fails just about the time you get the hang of hooking
the bungee with only using your right hand to both shift into fourth and
hook the bungee while your left hand is reserved for simulateously steering,
holding your 7-11 Big Gulp, lighting your cigarette, waving to your friends,
and signalling for a turn because your blinker/turn signal flasher is DOA!
You will get to a point where the bungee will not have any effect on the
fourth gear. At this point the tranny will grind like a sawmill hitting a
railroad spike embedded into a log no matter how hard you pull back on the
shifter in an attempt to &quot;hold it into gear.&quot; At this point you are hosed!
The next technique is to limp home, pull the tranny, and either rebuild it
yourself given the proper knowledge and tools or assume the position and
have a pro rebuild it for you. Good luck! You will feel like you went to
heaven and have plenty of time on your hands the first time you drive your
new tranny.
