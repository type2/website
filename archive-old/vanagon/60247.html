Subject: Tire Report

Well I got into the consumer information thing, and found the report i
alluded to. It's a good news - bad news deal. The good news is that the
report list a Majority of Tires, including those Yoko's I see everybody
ordering, along with their vitial statistics. The bad news is the report
doesn't have the sought after rolling resistance figures I was hoping for.

Heres the cut and paste deally,

I also saw a Michelien Tire interface selection site. It's kinda crummy,
its really slow, and &quot;bombed to boot&quot;, probably has the flu or something;
and the layout was confusing.  It recommend a 185... in a rainforce MX4.
The site said this for camper and the syncro.  The site promised a RV and
recreational area soon. So what!, probably the same tire. Anyway that's the
report.
