Subject: CV Boot lube-cheating

I remember about ten years ago, when my ol '70 beetle (may it rest in 
peace) needed it's CV boots lubed, the local shadetree VW mechanic did a 
trick that I still remember quite well.  My boots were all lubed within 
10  minutes and he didn't even charge me.

What he did was put a big needle on the end of the grease gun, poked the 
needle through the rubber boot, and then injected the grease right on in 
there like a syringe.   Contrary to my initial 
misgivings, the boots seemed unharmed and they lasted many years.
Of course, the boots were in pretty good shape to begin with...
Has this practice been debunked?   Seems pretty easy, if one can get the 
correct grease-syringe....
