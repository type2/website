Subject: Re: Vanagon

&gt;I would like to subscribe to Vanagon.  My screen name is VWcrazyTim.  I
&gt;currently own a '71 Bus (non camper) that I am currently doing a full
&gt;restoration on, and some slight modifications (interior and paint, that is,
&gt;when I have to $ to get it painted).
&gt;
&gt;I am so thrilled that there is some type of type 2 only *club* on the
&gt;internet!
&gt;
&gt;Thanx much,
&gt;
&gt;Tim :)

I was wondering when more people from the &quot;vintage and air-cooled list&quot; from
AOL would come over!

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF THE TYPE II !!
