 I posted about reversing the path of the Western leg, and got several
&gt; enthusiastic responses, and almost no negative ones.  Therefore, unless
&gt; a bunch of people tell me, like REAL soon, that they can't make it, I
&gt; am going to rework the route to start from St. Louis on May 26th.  This
&gt; is the time and location of the Busses by the Arch gettogether, which for
&gt; a lot of us is a big plus!  We will stay the weekend at St. Louis for
&gt; BBTA and then head out West, veering up into Canada, over to Victoria,
&gt; and then down the West coast.  We should arrive in Central California
&gt; sometime during the 3rd week in June, or thereabouts.  Those that can't
&gt; make it to St. Louis, I hope will still plan on joining one of the legs
&gt; of the trip for a while.
&gt; 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH
This is horrible, as I will be tooling around the desert with my family
until June 2. If it starts that early, I would definately miss the St.
Louis part, and have to catch up somewhere else...
