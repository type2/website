Subject: Ellis still on the wagon?/Cracked cases (f)

Ken Hooper (khooper_at_wsp1.wspice_dot_com) wondered if ellis/vanbondo was still on
the wagon. At first I didnt know what wagon I was supposed to be on. Did I
REALLY have a case of the &quot;Blackouts&quot; to the point that I didn't even
remeber having a problem? 
No way, Ken reminded me that I promised not to be a &quot;smart***&quot; for a day.
Well, I didn't say what day that would be! =) Besides I took Wednesday off
from work this week. Did that count?

&quot;Hi I'm VanBondo. I am a smart***!&quot;
The list replies, &quot;Hi VanBondo!&quot;

Not to make light of anyone dealing with similar (if not more serious)
situations in life. I seriously support and admire all efforts in this area.
In fact, I mumbled something about the nico-caffine jones sometime back and
never dealt with it. Today is coincidently day one of no cigs for Rusty.

Specific to the welding of &quot;flammable&quot; engine cases, I have heard of folks
welding the rear web of engine cases (Welded window) as well as repairing
oil cooler cracks via welding. I am not knowlegible as to the specifics. I
defer to Mr. Hoover or others on this subject.
