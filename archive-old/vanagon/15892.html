Subject: Belly pans, underpans, pedal-pans... 

	John Hopp (who ought to be *given* a Rabbit) asked if
the nose-pan/pedal-cover thingee I found at pick and pull was the same
as the belly pan on a Westie. Answer, &quot;No.&quot; As someone was explaining
a few posts ago, Westies, sunroof busses and double-cargo-door (eg both
sides) busses have a reinforcement pan welded under everything else
in the center. As someone from a colder climate noted, the pan I have
allows one to ski on packed snow, sand or even water (yipes!)

	The pan I sought and now have covers the forward center
section, screwed to the channel frame rails. Its more or less centered,
so doesn't exactly sit under the driver's feet- more like
under the shifter and parking brake, and the driver's right
foot (Left in UK and Japan) and the passenger's left foot (Right
in UK and Japan)

	View from underneath:

                           This is the pan I got (_at__at__at__at_)
