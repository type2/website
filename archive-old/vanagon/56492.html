&gt; ... there must be an easier way!!!!   Because the base for the captain's
&gt; seat is so far back, the only way I was able to get enough room to remove
&gt; the battery was by taking pliers &amp; bending up the metal on the rear rim of
&gt; the battery compartment.  Tell me this isn't something I'll have to do
&gt; every time I remove the battery !!!!!  I did move the seat as far forward
&gt; as possible, &amp; swivel it to the side, which gained a couple millimeters
&gt; more clearance.  But the whole base of the seat covers the first inch or so
&gt; of the battery compartment &amp; I couldn't figure out how to actually move the
&gt; base.
&gt; 
You can't move the swivel base without removing the seat, but the 
battery should squeeze by with the base turned to the right angle. 
It is a really tight fit, so maybe some brands of batteries are worse 
than others.
If you're having trouble sliding or swivelling the seat, now might be 
the time to remove it &amp; clean/lube the swivel base &amp; tracks, and make 
the battery job easier...
