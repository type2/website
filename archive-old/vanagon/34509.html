So Craig Standley says:
&gt; Today I was looking at my bus (1974, non-FI) and noticed some weird 
&gt; things in the airscoops.  There seems to be some metal tubing that comes 
&gt; up out of the engine, bends and heads back down into the engine 
&gt; compartment.  This tubing is about 1/4&quot; in diameter, and at the top there 
&gt; is a section that is about 1&quot; in diameter and about 6&quot; long.  Is it some 
&gt; kind of sensor or mechanical thermostat.  I know there is one under the 
&gt; engine, but is this part of it.  The tubing seems to be on both sides of 
&gt; the bus.
&gt; 

These lines sound like part of your fuel emission system.  Basically, those
lines come from the main fuel line system and eventually converge together 
in the the upper engine compartment. (Look just inside the hatch up toward
the top).  There is a 'T' connectory where they converge and then a hose
is routed to the charcoal cannistor where the fumes are held until the
engine is started up.  Then they fumes are sucked into the carb and engine
where they are burned with the rest of the air/fuel mixture.
