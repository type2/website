&gt;Howdy -
&gt;I have been noticing a distinct *squeak* sound from the front end of my
&gt;'80 lately. The sound is definitely related to vertical movement of
&gt;the front end.  I can wiggle in my seat at a stop and hear it. While
&gt;doing a front disc replacement yesterday I was able to locate a
&gt;culprit.  The anti-sway bar goes through a rubber bushing as do
&gt;other bits and pieces of the suspension system.  I can see black
&gt;residue (rubber?) next to where the metal bar goes through the rubber
&gt;on a small portion of the bushing.
&gt;
&gt;Query: What nasty things are happening and what can one do about?

You can take the bushings out and grease those pups.  Should fix the
problem for oh, a little while or so.  Probably better to replace them.
Polyeurethane bushings squeak really bad (i.e. &quot;high performance&quot;
bushings).  Buy the stock rubber ones from the dealer.  Yeah, it's one of
those &quot;ask me how I know&quot; things...
