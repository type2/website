Subject: Europarts (Vanagon parts) in CA

I called this place since I refuse to pay the $45 for the
side view mirrors.  Their price is $29.95.  I also am looking
for the mud flaps but they don't carry them.  The guy said they
only can get original parts that are not 'options'.  I didn't
think the mud flaps were an option.  Maybe they came standard
on the 'falias?

-Scott.
