&gt; My advice to anyone with an older bus is to check the hinge *before* it

&gt; I am still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it looks like
&gt; drilling it out and running a bolt through the hinge is my best option,
&gt; without actually removing the entire hinge.

Why don't you just replace the whole hinge?  They are about $1 at the
junkyard, and are not hard to find.  One huge phillips screwdriver and a
few minutes and it's done.
