&gt;
&gt;Hey everyone,
&gt;
&gt;Just wanted to put out an APB for a champagne edition bus sitting in a
&gt;junkyard somewhere in North America.  It must be out there, and I want
&gt;the interior!
&gt;
&gt;This bus had unusual colors.  The exterior is 2-tone, brown bottom and
&gt;brick-red top, with disco stripes painted along the sides.  Interior
&gt;panels are red vinyl with chrome stripe accents.  The seats were
&gt;apparently either red vinyl with brown corduroy panels, or brown vinyl
&gt;with red corduroy panels, not sure which, as none of the original
&gt;seats came with my bus.  The dashboard, steering wheel, and related
&gt;plastic bits were a dark, chocolate brown color, NOT black.
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for a good interior (panels, seats, carpets???), and some
&gt;plastic bits.  If anyone can give me a line on any of this stuff, I'd
&gt;appreciate it.  In particular, I guess brown plastic bits wouldn't
&gt;necessarily have to come from a champagne edition.  I'm in central NJ,
&gt;so east coasters especially keep your eyes peeled...
&gt;
&gt;Many thanks,
&gt;Rodney
&gt;

I own your beast.  It is for sale now.  It runs fine.  It has new exhaust
valves.  I am expecting about $1700.00 the way it sits now.  It has origninal
paint (dented in places), it has original stripes (faded in places), it has a
God-awful orange interior minus a sliding door panel and the seat covers are
pretty much history.  There's enough there for a good upholsterer to make
copies though.  It has orange carpet, orange tire cover, orange corduroy seat
covers, and orange wheels.  It has fuel injection.  It needs a rear brake job
due to a very slight leak in the right rear wheel cylinder.  It still drives
fine anyway.  It has the rust thing going on around the windshield, but can
be repaired fairly easily.

It is sitting out by the highway with a for sale sign on it now.  Do you want
to drive off in it?  Or are you going to let some wannabus that doesn't even
have the decency to belong to this list drive it home?  &gt;:-O
