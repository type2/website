Subject: The Inuvik Run - Starting Out

The Inuvik Run -- Starting Out

Traveling solo has its good and bad points.  On the plus side, I
enjoy my own company but on the down side is the fact you can't
travel very far on any given day, not if you are driver, cook,
housekeeper, mechanic, laundryman and so forth.  And especially
not when you are traveling in a thirty-one year old Volkswagen
Microbus.

The first day I traveled an easy four hundred miles to my son's
house in Modesto, had a good meal with him, discussed the trip
and dossed down in the bus.  He didn't like the idea of me
sleeping in his driveway but I needed to do so as part of the
drill.  If some aspect of the bus prevented me getting enough
rest, the trip would have to be abandoned.

The second day carried me a little farther than the first and
taught me a little more.  In preparation for the trip I removed
the passenger seat, replacing it with some built-in shelves and a
computer rack mounting an old AT platform I'd configured for low
power operation allowing me to run it off the auxiliary battery
via an invertor.  The computer would allow me to keep a daily
record of the trip but was not fitted with a telecommunications
interface.  During the second day's run I began to see the most
logical arrangement of items on the newly installed shelves and
worked out a method of bracing the keyboard and video monitor to
hold them more securely in position.  

After traveling 853 miles in 13.1 engine hours I called it a day
and made camp in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in Oregon.

About noon of the third day I crossed the Canadian border at
Abbotsford.  The Canadians were not glad to see me.  According to
friends in law enforcement the majority of drugs entering Canada
from the US do so in commercial trucks, motorhomes and RV's.   My
friends scoffed at the idea of anyone carrying drugs in an old
Volkswagen bus, other than Deadheads and the like.  &quot;You might be
hassled by an ignorant sheriff but no real peace office is going
to waste time on a retired Navy man driving an old Volkswagen.&quot; 
Apparently the typical drug smuggler is a Mom &amp; Pop team driving
an expensive RV towing a second vehicle in which the drugs are
concealed.  After crossing the border they simply replace the
drug-laden vehicle for an identical copy, swapping across the
license plates thus insuring a high degree of deniability for the
mules, who can claim the swap took place without their knowledge. 
  

Obviously my friends are not familiar with Canadian border
guards.  Or the Canadians are not familiar with bulletins issued
by the DEA.  Asking only a question or two the border guards told
me where to park and commenced taking the bus apart.  I got out
my camera and was politely told to put it away, no pictures
allowed.  

In the inspection bay next to the bus the border guards were
dismantling a late model sedan, going so far as to remove the
front seat, discovering such contraband items as children's toys,
an assortment of styrofoam cups and some mummified french fries
from McDonalds.  When they were done, the front seat no longer
worked properly, thanks to a number of wires broken during its
removal.  I gave the car's owner a cheerful smile and said
&quot;Welcome to Canada,&quot; in a loud voice, winning me a host of
baleful stares from my hosts, who had worked their way thru my
luggage and were industriously emptying out my tool boxes, of
which I had several, all chock full of nice clean tools, neatly
packed and wrapped with rags to prevent rattles.  

The bus is fitted with two very obvious saddle tanks, five inches
deep, fourteen inches wide and four feet long.  No one bothered
to see if the tanks were full of fuel or even if they were really
fuel tanks, and the engine compartment left them completely
baffled.  Apparently confused by the lack of a glove box or
passenger seat, the searchers focused on my personal luggage and
tool boxes, as if searching for handguns instead of drugs.  Even
so, they failed to discover any of the several weapons I had on
board.

It took the frustrated border guards nearly an hour to realize
they were not going to make the bust of the century.  They tossed
things back in the bus and wandered back to their coffee cups and
dreams of glory, leaving me to repack my bags and tools and
composure.  Welcome to Canada indeed.

I followed Highway 1 to Hope, British Columbia, the little town
where the first 'Rambo' film was made.  At Hope I hung a left and
continued north on Highway 97, which originates in Weed,
California.  In the states, Highway 97 is a secondary road that
meanders through the outback of Washington, Oregon and California
but in Canada it is a major thoroughfare called 'The Cariboo
Highway'(sic).  Highway 97, or BC-1 follows the railroad tracks
up the Fraser River canyon and railroad tracks do not ascend
steep grades.  It's a good route for an old bus.

I spent my first night in Canada at the Cargill road-side rest
stop between Cache Creek and Clinton after a run of 522 miles,
well short of Quesnel, my intended goal.  The delay at the border
was simply too long to make up.  If I ever come to Canada again
I'll know to allow an additional two hours for the border
crossing.

(After the trip comments.)

With regard to weapons, I did not lie nor make an illegal
declaration when crossing the Canadian border.  Had the guards
asked the proper questions I would of answered them honestly.  

Parts of two of the weapons I carried were in plain view and even
handled by the inspectors during their search.  Since they made
no comment it's fair to assume I violated no laws, other than in
spirit.

I am not a scoff-law.  But neither am I a victim-in-waiting.  In
preparing for the trip I learned that due to a late winter and
wet spring there had been more than the usual number of bear
attacks in the area of Canada where I would be camping.  Ample
proof of this was provided by newspaper articles in the towns I
visited during the trip.

The bears were here first; I'm just a visitor.  Should I
encounter a bear, for me the most appropriate response is to find
another campsite.  But there was a slim possibility that due to
injury or mechanical failure I might be forced to confront a bear
head-on. I provided for that contingency.

Despite all the laws and courts and cops, ultimately each of us
is responsible for our own safety.  The country in which you're
traveling is immaterial although the rule is especially true in
sparsely settled regions.  Be it a British Columbian bear, a
Miami mugger or a Baja rattlesnake, you can die just as quickly. 
In preparing for the trip I gave as much consideration to my
personal safety as I did to the preparation of my vehicle.  I
feel that to have done anything less would have been foolish.
