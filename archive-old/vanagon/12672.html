(HIGHLY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE TO FOLLOW)

My only two cents is this:  AVOID PEP BOYZ.  I classify them with Sears, 
Mont. Ward's, and all general garages--they do good work if they're doing 
work they know how to do:  tires, batteries, shocks, etc., but the VW, 
IMHO, is special, and most general-garage-mechanics don't appreciate the 
VW.  That's it, really--out there in callyfernya y'all have many more VW 
shop options than us here in the hinterlands.

Good luck, and may all of your estimates be low &amp; accurate!!
