Driving  my vanagon back from the country. Got to the city and my 
first stop light. Put in the clutch and put 'er into nuetral. Then, 
when I tried to go into first, nothing happened-there was plenty of 
tension on the clutch, and I had not been losing power in any gears 
I was doing 70mph for at least 20 miles on the highway right before.

Finally I manage to ram it into gear and limp off in first. Then 
daring as i am, I put the clutch in and moved toward second.... no 
problem!!!????It slid right into gear! Then as I approached the next stop light, 
I pushed in the clutch ( while in second) but the clutch had not disengaged,(the 
vanagon started buckin a little, the motor had that 
winding-down-now-i'm-going-to-stall sound.

Took it out of gear. At the green, I try to get it into first. No
luck. (on go the hazards). I try slamming it into first and it 
bounces off and into reverse- with the associated grinding noise. I 
take it out of reverse and it glides into first/second. I made it 
home.... whew.  Obviously it is the clutch (of course, after new cv 
joints, why not?) But could it be the clutch linkage? I never heard 
of a clutch letting go like that without some kind of warning.

Somebodt please tell me I'm not looking at another $500.

Waaaaaaaaahhhh
