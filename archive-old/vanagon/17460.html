Subject: Another FFFriday: a REALLY bad one this time! ..

Bob and Ted were cops.  One day they saw an old hippie-looking VW Type II
putzing along and they figured somebody had to be smoking pot inside.
However, Bob had gotten all the drug arrests ever since they'd been riding
together.  So, after they'd pulled the VW over and gotten a powerful scent
of grass, Bob turned to his parterner and said &quot;Your BusTed.&quot;

Anon.
