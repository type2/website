Subject: Name That Brick (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)

Oh Well, here's another statistics suggestion for Joel:
Bricks named by category:  Humans, animals, plants,....
BTW, the Seren Bricks go by:

Duldul  .. the '82 diesel westy (anybody know Lucky Luke?)
Falkor  .. the '93 EV (big cute white dog in the sky -- from the
                       movie : 'The Neverending Story' )
ARRRGH  .. the '87 Vanagon (the license plate turned out to be: ARR-012,
                            the kids came up with the name)
