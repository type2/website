&gt; I am going to be calling PROPEX in England within the

&gt; vented propane furnace for my Syncro Westie. I expect cost
&gt; to be around $600. These are the units that are often put in UK
&gt; buses, a couple of listmembers have installed them and are real
&gt; happy...see

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm always ready to talk volume discounts, and its probably 
&gt; cheaper to handle export paperwork for one shipment, so if anyone
&gt; is interested in going in on this, please let me know asap.

&gt; Thanks
