Subject: FS &amp; Wanted: Bentley Manuals

I'm hoping someone near me might have a 80-91 Vanagon Bentley manual 
they no longer need (haha...)
Cheapest I've seen is $90 CDN or so - is this about right?

Also, I have a 75-79 Rabbit/Scirocco Bentley Manual in as new 
condition which I'd like to part with, so I can afford the above... 
;-)
New is around $39 CDN, sell for $20 CDN

Thx.

Shawn.
