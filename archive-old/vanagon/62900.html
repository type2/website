Subject: Re: Can vanagon parts list on microfiche be purchased

     Lionel-
     
     Is there an ISBN on the book anywhere?
     
     All-
     
     When citing printed material that others may want to purchase locally, 
     you can make the &quot;hunt&quot; easier by including the ISBN (or ISSN for 
     periodicals) in your helpful post.
     
     Thanks
