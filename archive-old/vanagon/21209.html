&gt;
&gt;To All:
&gt;
&gt;This is part sermon, part saga.  I'm not sure which part is which.
&gt;
&gt;I had to make a trip to Modesto, four hundred miles and change from my home
&gt;in Vista, near San Diego.  Weapon of choice was my 1967 baja'd beetle, mostly
&gt;because it's faster than the '65 bus and gets better mileage.  The bug has
&gt;one seat.  It is heavily modified.
&gt;
&gt;Left Vista at noon on Tuesday, arrived in Modesto about eight hours later.
&gt; Weather was hot (90+) for most of the trip.  Average speed was high (80 to
&gt;90).  Combined with a lunch stop and a couple of 'comfort' stops, block-speed
&gt;worked out to about 60mph, fuel consumption a little better than 20mph.  No
&gt;problems noted although oil temp ran about 240 -- 20 degrees higher than
&gt;normal even for hot weather, and pressure about 40, 10 pounds lower than
&gt;normal.  Oil was 30W, a change from the usual 20W-50 in anticipation of the
&gt;hotter weather in the Central Valley.  And yes, it did get warm.
&gt;
&gt;Driving around Modesto I noticed a new sound from the passenger-side front
&gt;wheel.  Checked the bearing and found it failing.  Cleaned the hub, replaced
&gt;inner &amp; outer but was forced to re-use the old oil seal, unable to find a
&gt;replacement.
&gt;
&gt;But the problem wasn't with the bearing, it was with the spindle.  Before I
&gt;acquired the car it had suffered a spun outer bearing on the right front
&gt;spindle.  Apparently the long high-speed run up highway 99 had allowed enough
&gt;motion between the race and the spindle to wear it below spec.  That's just a
&gt;guess; I carry a lot of tools when I travel but no precision instruments.
&gt; But the new bearing was a loose fit.
&gt;
&gt;Shopped for a replacement spindle at all of the local junkyards.  Found some
&gt;nice buses including a pair of Westies (Pic &amp; Pull, near Empire, east of
&gt;Modesto) but only eight bugs, only one of which had spindles I could use and
&gt;of course they were already gone.
&gt;
&gt;Decided to head home early, take it slow.  Big mistake here was to elect to
&gt;travel south via Interstate 5 instead of highway 99.  I-5 is pretty barren.
&gt; Departed Modesto about 6 pm Friday, counting on low speed,  the cooler
&gt;evening hours and the slightly higher elevation of I-5 to keep the bearing
&gt;cool.
&gt;
&gt;I spent nearly five hours to travel a couple of hundred miles south, stopping
&gt;frequently to let the bearing cool, repack the thing and so on. I had one
&gt;canteen of water (a gallon), used it to cool the bearing, repacked it twice.
&gt;  About 11pm  I knew I wasn't going to make it home on the spindle/bearing.
&gt; Called home, told them I would be late.  Repacked the wheel bearing and
&gt;headed east, hoping to reach Fresno about 100 miles away.  Made it, or at
&gt;least close enough to count, but it was the middle of the night (temp still
&gt;in the high 80's).  I flaked out in the bug for a couple of hours, parked
&gt;outside a junkyard.  (There's a fore &amp; aft shelf instead of a passenger seat,
&gt;long enough for a stretcher.)   Local activity -- and the heat -- woke me up
&gt;about 6 am.  When I dismounted the wheel to repack the bearing, the cage came
&gt;apart.  So I went ahead and removed the spindle.  I wouldn't be able to drive
&gt;the bug but neither could anyone else.  
&gt;
&gt;As luck would have it, the yard where I'd parked didn't have any air-cooled
&gt;VW's and no bugs at all but they put me onto one that did and a customer
&gt;offered to drive me other there.
&gt;
&gt;I figured out what tools I'd need, made up a pack, put on my straw hat
&gt;(standard Baja-issue), slung the pack over one shoulder, canteen over the
&gt;other and started The Great Spindle Hunt.
&gt;
&gt;I didn't have any luck finding a spare spindle around Fresno but picked up a
&gt;new set of bearings and an oil seal.  It was Saturday, hot -- over 100 -- and
&gt;busy.  I was wearing levis, boots, long-sleeved khaki shirt and a lot of
&gt;grease.  People were surprisingly kind; I had to pay for only one ride. The
&gt;costume may have helped, or perhaps it was the temperature -- 105 at one
&gt;point in the afternoon.
&gt;
&gt;Finally located a spindle near Madera.  Hitched a ride and got there just
&gt;before they closed and was allowed to borrow a jack to facilitate removal of
&gt;the spindle; I had a small floor jack in the bug but didn't add it to the
&gt;pack due to the weight; I was giving lessons in sweating as it was.
&gt;
&gt;Got back to the bug about seven thirty, called home -- they were getting a
&gt;little nervous.  Got the spindle installed, did a rough wheel alignment using
&gt;two pieces of plastic water pipe as a gauge.  Couldn't do anything about the
&gt;camber but got it close enough to work. Cleaned the hub with gasoline (the
&gt;bug carries 25 gallons), got everything back together, started home.  
&gt;
&gt;Pretty dopey from the heat &amp; work; probably a little dehydrated even though
&gt;I'd downed at least a gallon of fluids during the day.  Kept the speed down.
&gt; Got to the top of the Grapevine about 1130, called home to tell them I'd be
&gt;a little later than expected.  It was cool up there, 4,000 feet above the
&gt;valley floor.  Had some coffee from the truck, smoked a pipe.  Dismounted the
&gt;wheel to check &amp; adjust the new bearing.  Couldn't find the metric allen
&gt;wrench for the spindle nut.  Had to empty the whole damn bug, search
&gt;everything before I found it in the pack.  (I used a piece of nylon luggage
&gt;with a shoulder strap as the pack to carry the tools when I went hunting for
&gt;the spindle.)  Saw that as a sign; put all the tools back into their proper
&gt;places, re-packed my bag, taking the opportunity to change trousers.  But I
&gt;only had the one shirt, now a bit the worse for wear. (I'd left them hanging
&gt;back of the shop when I loaded the bug for the trip, drove off without them;
&gt;washed the one I had every night I was in Modesto.) 
&gt;
&gt;Motored on down the mountain just in time to run into a freak rain storm
&gt;crossing the LA basin.  Lotsa lightning, heavy rain.  Engine ran fine but
&gt;started having some electrical problems, apparently due to a slipping fan
&gt;belt.  (The engine has no cover; if it rains, it gets wet).
&gt;
&gt;Kept it rolling; there's really no place to pull off until you get across LA.
&gt; Pulled off near San Onofre, adjusted the fan belt.  Ruddy moon just coming
&gt;over the mountains to the east, rising up through layers of clouds.  Odd,
&gt;fitful puffs of wind.  It started to rain again as I neared Oceanside.
&gt;
&gt;I arrived home at 3:34 having been awake about 22 hours.  Total miles
&gt;traveled, 923 to make-good a distance of about 870.  
&gt;
&gt;                                 Sermonette
&gt;
&gt;If you want to lose weight, buy a Volkswagen.  I lost eight pounds in two
&gt;days :-)  
&gt;
&gt;If you live in Modesto, forget using America On-Line; local access is only
&gt;2400 baud.  (Sandy Eggo runs 38,400.)
&gt;
&gt;If you travel for a few days, remember to No Mail the Vanagon list servor;
&gt;musta been a couple hundred messages in the mailbox when I turned this thing
&gt;on.
&gt;
&gt;Always carry a spare right-front spindle :-)
