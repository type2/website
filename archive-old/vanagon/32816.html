Subject: DaBoat gets a new windshield
Date: Sun, 14 Jan 1996 22:59:07 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	Yesterday I took DaBoat down to Otay near the Mexican border to get
a new windshield installed.  There is an operation consisting of a
couple of Mexican-Americans working out of a back of a truck who I went
to a couple of years ago for a windshield install - they charge $25, are
fast and professional, and even guarantee against leaks.  I had found a
windshield in the junkyard a few months ago to replace the one that had
gotten cracked in South Dakota on GNATT by a truck kicking up rocks.
I paid about $30 for the windshield from the junkyard, and although I
thought I had inspected it closely, I found two chips in the upper
middle area (near the backside of the rearview mirror) when I was
cleaning it.  DOH!  Oh well, for the price I guess I can't complain, and
it will probably get cracked on the way to Inuvik anyway.

Why did I wait so long to put in the windshield?  Well, there was the
matter of not being able to drive the bus while the engine was being
rebuilt (for 3 months?#$?#?_at_!!).  I also needed a new windshield seal.
Back a few months ago I had e-mailed Jim at Bus Boys asking about a new
seal, then never ordered it because of the bus being out of commission.
I felt bad, even thought that the reason he disappeared from the list
for a while was because of people like me that had promised orders and
never come through.  Fortunately, that wasn't the case.  :-)

I called Jim and ordered the seal, and received it a few days later.  I
was very pleased with the quality of the seal - looks much better than
the junk door seals I bought from J.C WhipMe 18 months ago (which are
now rotting to pieces, I might add).  In addition to the seal I found in
the package a BusBoys bumper sticker, catalog, and nicely detalied
invoice.  On the invoice was listed a &quot;Vanagon list discount&quot; of 10%
which was nice since I hadn't even asked for it when I ordered.

Upon removal of the old windshield, I was upset to see some major
surface rust (not suprising, though, since the old seal was in such bad
shape).  Fortunately, I had brought sandpaper and primer with me, and
the guys at the shop gave me some time to clean up the area.  I used 80
grit to remove the rust (down to the now pockmarked metal) and give it a
light coat of primer.  Would have painted it too, but the paint I had
needed 2 hours to dry to the touch.  The shop dudes then installed the
&quot;new&quot; windshield.  Took them all of 5 minutes, just like last time, but
it was worth the $25 to me, cause I probably would have broken it if I
had tried it myself.

So once again I have a clear view of the road.  Expenses were:

Seal		$22
Windshield	$30
Install		$25

... or just under $80 total.  I'm not affiliated with Bus Boys in any
way, but I was very happy with my first experience with them.
