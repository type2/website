wow, this actually shifts easily now!!!

Well, as there has been some murmurings lately about transmission
mounts, and as UPS finally brought me mine, I decided it was time to do
the deed.Here's basically what it involves:

1 Remove engine - yes, this is absolutely necessary. I'll assume you
know how to do this, and not explain it further.

2 Disconnect shift coupler - to make this really easy, shift into 1st or
3rd, THEN disconnect, so you can shift the lever into 2nd or 4th, and
thereby separate the shift rod from the nose cone rod.

3 Separate reduction boxes from spring plates. this is obviously for
splits, I don't know if the CV's and axles will give enough play to move
the trans. far enough.

4 Remove big bolts which secure rear trans. mount holder to frame

5 Remove all 4 nuts from front trans mount

6 Lying under the nose cone, have someone pull back on the trans, while
you remove the halves of the old mount, and slide the new one in there.

7 replace the rear mounts. Definately do this, while you're in there
anyway. Mine were broken, and I couldn't tell.

8 Put it all back together, in reverse order.

NOTES:
While you can do most of this by yourself, you definately need a friend
to help out for some parts, plus it's nice to have some company.
The whole operation took about 5 hours, at a nice relaxed pace, with all
the parts and tools there.

Now, WOW! It almost shifts itself! What a MAJOR difference that makes.
Plus now I don't have to worry about killing the nose cone, or selector
arms, or the whole thing falling out.
DO IT !!!!
I will be happy to answer any questions  if I can...
Thanks
