Since you say the choke is OK, my guess is that the carb/manifolds
are not getting warmed up properly.  I'm not familiar with the 1800
engine, but is there warm pre-heated air going into the carb and
is there a heat riser system to use hot exhaust to heat the intake
manifold?  In upright engines, lack of these two things causes the
symptoms you describe.  (Aftermarket carbs and exhaust are notorious
for neglecting these areas!) Also is the thermostat setup functioning?
