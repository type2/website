Subject: other busses which are around.

High all-
        My wife and I made a hour trip to Roanoke yesterday and saw two 
different busses.  The first was so ragged out, 68-70, (moon caps and the 
wide 5 bolt patteren) red, and was pulling a trailer with a Harley on it.  
The owner had attached two 5 gallon gas cans to the rear cargo hatch.  Talk 
about long distance.  There was also a large oil cooler mounted on the left 
side.  This one was another testamony to the ragged out, lived in bus thing.
        The other was a 77 owned by a French-Canadian named Bernard who was 
restoring/fixing up this bus.  The interesting part was how he kept his 
pop-top down in the wind.  Bernard had cut about 2 feet out of the front 
portion of the pop-top and moved it back, making his westy look more like a 
Doormobile.  He said that all of the wind was out and it worked real well.  
It is real neat meeting people who own busses and the stories they have to 
tell about them.

        On a side note, my homemade oil temp gauge is still working and the 
temp has yet to exceed 190 degrees.  Cool is nice.  

I would like to post a GIF to the list which is a diogram of the circuit.  
With the quantity of list subscribers, I would like to test sending it to 
one member.  Anyone want to volunteer?  Thanks.
