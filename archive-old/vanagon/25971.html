Subject: Sale on ZKW lights

If anyone is interested, there is a Volvo/Saab specialty shop in Portland
Ore that is selling these ZKW (Austrian) lights for half price. They're
halogen, come in driving light &amp; fog light style, have relays, switch,fuse,
plugs etc. They come in round, rectangular, and rectangular with plastic
grid.  Prices range from US$46.00 to US$130 per pair. They have a 90 day
warranty.
They're on a closeout so first-come first served.
These people are very good to deal with (IMHO - I've been buying Volvo
stuff from them for years).

Name is IPD
City is Portland, Ore
Phone # is 1-800-444-6473 (8:30 - 5:00 Pacific Time M-F)
