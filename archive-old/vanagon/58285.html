Subject: Stickers &amp; Future merchandising

Ok, now that the ball is rolling on the coffee mugs, my mind has wandered off
into thoughts of other list things, much though I have tried to stop it!
:)
 Anyway, lately people have been asking about list stickers. I, in my never
ending quest to make everyone happy, would love to print more list stickers.
However, quite a lot of folks already have the old stickers, and therefore
probably not be interested in helping buy the 500 from this batch. Therefore,
the marketing genius inside led me to the thought that I should make up a
*STUNNING NEW LIST STICKER DESIGN*
Yes, that's right, just like commercial America (argh) I am thinking of
changing a design, so your old ones will become obsolete, and you'll have to
buy my new product! Just pretend I'm your television telling you what to
do...OF course, the old ones will still look nice, as well as establishing you
as having seniority...But, I just love stickers, so if I want a new one, I have
to sell the other 499 from the batch.
So anyway, I have a cool new design for a list sticker, featuring the V_at_L
address, as well as the TYPE2 web address, in a unifying reminder that we're
all still bus drivers, and as such brothers and sisters in the world of type
II's.
Should I do it? Will enough of you kind enough to buy the first sticker be
gullible, um, er, nice enough to buy a new one? (These will actually be sold in
packages of 3 for $5.00, and 7 for $10.00, unless I go crazy and order 1000,
which would lower the price a bit.)
The new design is really cool, and actually one I considered in the first
place. It's a bus wheel, done on the same chrome mylar as the first sticker. It
has the shiny chrome VW hubcap, wheel, and black tire with white letters
spelling out the addresses. About 4&quot; in diameter, just small enough to fit in a
standard business envelope.
If I do print them, of course you'll have to put up with me whining every
Friday about how many stickers I have left, until they're all gone...
Anyway, we shall see.
 As a brief aside, people are also asking about t-shirts. I'll probably do them
as well, but I had the brainstorm of printing designs on (new) mechanic's
coveralls. Heck, we're all here because we love our busses, and that usually
means crawling under them and getting dirty. A good set of coveralls is
necessary to protect those stunning list t-shirts, so I may see if I can get
coveralls printed also...Long sleeve t-shirts should also be available...
Ok then, have a happy weekend, and I'll see some of you at the Farmington show
this Sunday!
