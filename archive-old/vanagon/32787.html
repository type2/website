&gt;You need to get the commercial version of Eudora which supports filters or
&gt;get the shareware Pegasus that does the same. All your list email will be
&gt;filtered into its own &quot;Email In Box For Vanagon List&quot; and your regular In
&gt;box will contain only mail addressed to you personally. That way, you can
&gt;quickly delete the 90% of Vanagon mail that does not interest you (based on
&gt;its subject) but be able to read all the mail addressed to you personally,
&gt;even if the subject line does not at first look interesting.

No way.  What do you key in on?  

&quot;To&quot;  is you own name and email address and is the same for all email received.

&quot;From&quot; is the name and email address of the original message sender.  There is
nothing here to distinguish it as having come from the Vanagon list.

&quot;Subject&quot;  is that the original send used.  Does not necessarily contain the
word &quot;Vanagon&quot; which would enable a filter to work on this field.

&quot;Message Body&quot; no filter available for this portion of the message.

BTW, the &quot;Message body&quot; contains the line &quot;To: Multiple recipients of list
&lt;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot; and is the only place where the use of the word
&quot;Vanagon&quot; always appears.  This would be ideal to filter on but like I said,
the filters do not work on the &quot;message body&quot;.

What I am trying to do is to change my registered first name on the list from
&quot;ED&quot; to &quot;Edward&quot; so that all incoming mail from the list is addressed to
&quot;Edward&quot;.  That way, I can filter on &quot;Edward&quot; in the &quot;To:&quot; field.  

However, so far it has not worked and the list minder, Gerry Skerbitz, is
looking into it.  Will advise outcome.


On again, off again in my 1990 Vanagon.
