&gt; The 1700 type IV engine has almost reached a state of maximum entropy in my
&gt; basement but I am having trouble splitting the case.  All the bolts are
&gt; out, so I assume it is just the 20 year old gasket/sealant holding the case
&gt; together.  Is there an easy way to split the case without resorting to
&gt; potentially destructive measures?

Are you absolutely *sure* you have all of the bolts out?  How about the
nuts?  I thought I was sure, but there are a couple that are very well
hidden.  If you have all of the hardware off, and if the case was sealed
with the proper stuff when it was assembled, it should come apart easily.
Try tapping appropriate appendages gently with a hammer to loosen it up.
Of course, under no circumstances should you attempt to split the case
by prying at the seam with a screwdriver or other sharp object, but you
probably already know this...  Oh, I think I remember there being a nut
to loosen behind where the flywheel would have been too.
