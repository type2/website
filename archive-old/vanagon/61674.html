My NEW (kind of) 80 Vanagon just lost its transmission.  the first gear
was slipping and I took it to upstate and back with littls problem. 
Last night it was slipping big time and today none of the gears worked. 
What should I check before I rip the van apart?  Also if you guys have a
bentley manual for my year I need chapters on: Transmission repair,
transmission removal,and transmission installation.
	If anyone can mail me photocopy of these pages, or scan them and send
me the diskette(IBM clone), or anything my mailing address is:
		
			Bossman
		      P.O. Box 306
                  Bergenfield, NJ 07621

P.S. - Due to the fact that I need this car for my Job and to live in
this summer I am parting out my 86 Vanagon.  If you need parts please
E-mail me and we'll work something out.  The car is grey outside/blue
inside and the money from what you buy will be spent on my 80.

                                  Thanks,
 				     B.
