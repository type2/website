Hi Everyone.  Today I took in the Polar Bear for emissions testing, 
and would like to share the results with the list.  The Polar Bear is 
a 1990 Syncro Westy.  This is the third year for us in the Vancouver
area of BC for emissions testing.

I hope all this formatting turns out for everyone's readers!!

In April of this year, the van got Bosch Platinum spark plugs, and 
the fuel injector recall by VW.  As the table presents, my HC reading 
is the best ever recorded.  It is also interesting to note that my 
maximum allowables by AirScare has increased this year.  Would this 
be an &quot;age&quot; factor that is being included??

There is no NOx testing for my van as it is a Syncro, and can't by 
dyno tested in BC.

Anyone willing to analyze this data?  I'm not entirely sure as to why 
the HC readings were so high in Dec/94.  I've had the same air filter 
for the past 3 years now, and the van is regularly maintained.  I 
have been burning the same fuel (Chevron Supreme) since the van was 
new.  It is also amazing that the maximum allowables for HC are so 
high when the van is putting out so little.  Any guesses as to why 
there is so much grace for HC readings??

Wondering...

Harry.
