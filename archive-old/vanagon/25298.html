Subject: Re:Tie Died Details

michael.heron_at_utoronto_dot_ca (Michael Heron) wondered who else but Rusty
VanBondo could dream up the little dialog that I posted earlier on Friday.
&gt;&gt;Dunno Michael.

michael.heron:
&gt;so how many bus shots are in the movie. that is the only reason that i
&gt;would go see it.
RVB:
There were a very disappointing few shots of VWs in the movie. Nice shots of
some creative combos e.g. Backward positioned roof section of a stupid
beetle placed on top of (welded/fiberglassed) a 72-ish westy. mid '50s
pickup on top of a mid '50s GMC/Superior Bus etc. No real expose' of deady
buses. A few roof top shots of parking lots and Arse end shots of '67-'68
westy with back up lights ala '67 with bubble rust coming through. some
quasi cool shots of home brewed paint jobs. Ken Kesey interview.(Snooze)

**Absolutely ZERO Gfldead music or footage**

michael.heron:
i loathe to watch what somebody thinks &quot;my&quot; scene is all about especially in
2.5 hours or less ;). &gt;what a groaner.

RVB:
Alot of pseudo &quot;groovy&quot; rationalization of this and that. Fun interviews
with a few hardcores who seem genuine. A couple of interviews with totally
peaking young kids (source of bogus pseudo &quot;groovy&quot; rationalization cop-out
for *ked up personal actions e.g. theft, cons, misdeeds, drug abuse,
drunkeness, justified as &quot;JAH&quot; lookin out for us and Babylon falling *As
explained by someone half my age peakin on &quot;Ecstacy/ X&quot; *). Babys, Mothers,
Twirling, Drums, More twirling, Drummers, Even More Twirling, Drumming,
Minimum Sentencing Issues, Vendors, Etc. Pros vs Cons of Getting on the
circuit and out of mainstream, getting off the circuit and into mainstream.
Trying recognize either the circuit or the mainstream. Trying verbalize
anything related to either the circuit or the mainstream.

&gt;
&gt;siskel; and ebert rate this a ??? ;) (like i care)

&gt;The S&amp;E duo would rate this about two notches below the BeeGees and Peter
Frampton in the remake of Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band Movie.
Production level is on par with Below/Beyond the Valley of the Dolls or a
scratched copy of Easy Rider.
