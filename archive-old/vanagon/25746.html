Subject: Re: Enging transplants, radiators on ba

&gt; The radiator was in a channel-iron
&gt;square with heavy metal mesh as a grille, all bolted to the
&gt;bumper and nose sheet-metal. A fan about 9 inches in diameter
&gt;was mounted behind the radiator, with clear space behind it.
&gt;The fan was driven by a shaft which emerged from nose sheet metal.
&gt;Probably driven by an electric motor mounted inside.

My brother-in-law and I mounted a radiator on the front of his bay window
(rotary conversion).  We removed the bumper and cut a section out of the
'bulge' it covers (and closed the ends with some plate).  This allowed the
radiator to 'sit back' quite neatly, rather than looking like something
protruding 'too far' at the front.  We then cut a smaller section out of the
bumper and put it back and the whole thing sits behind a bull bar......

He doesn't need to run a fan, but if he did I think a 'slim-line' thermo (does
the 'Davies Craig'  brand name mean anything to those in the US?) bolted on
the back of the radiator would be just the job.......
