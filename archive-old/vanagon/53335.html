Subject: Noise From Shift Lever
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 96 21:38:00 CDT


A high pitched soft buzzing noise comes from the shift lever of my 86 Syncro 
(4 speed with the low gear).  It happens most frequently in 3rd and 4th 
gears.  I'm able to make it dissipate momentarily by moving the lever to 
either side a millimeter or so, but the once the lever works its way back 
the noise emerges.  I was told that the noise comes from the linkages (?) 
 Does the noise signify something going on the fritz or is it just a 
harmless vibration?

Respond directly to me, my server frequently bounces mail and I become 
postponed from the list

Thanks

Paul
