Subject: sp. tire on front of vanagon?


I'm thinking of using the normal (under the vanagon) spaare tire
space for storing &quot;other things,&quot; and instead moving the spare
up and onto the front of the vanagon ('81, air-cooled), where it is
my hope that it would offer a little extra protection in the event
of a crash - a sort of &quot;external air bag.&quot;  


Any thoughts on this pro or con?  I remember that this was the
way the spare was carried on busses before the vanagon, so am
hoping my plan will not interfere with the engine cooling, etc...

Thanks!
