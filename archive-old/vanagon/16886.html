Subject: Best Vanaogon Brake Pads?

The first time I had the brake pads replaced was at 100K (bought it at 95k).
The dealer did the work and used whatever the dealer uses. Right away the
pads started leaving black dust on the alloy wheels which had not happened
before. For the next 37k miles, I have put up with the awful black dust on
my nice allow wheels. :-(

Well the pads started squeeking a little the other day, so I am thinking
maybe I will change the pads this time, especially if you guys can tell me a
good brand/type of pad to buy that wont garf up my wheels and will not
squeek excessively.

Thanks in advance!
