        Evening (morning).

Thanks to all who responded about my wheel cylinder question.  My backing
plate was so (c)rusty that it looked like the cylinders were tack-welded on.
Well, my friend Oxy-Acetylene had something to say to my wheel cylinders...
:)  Anyway, let's just say I won't be re-using them.  So, after a trip to
the local FLAPS (M&amp;S Auto in Waldorf, MD -- the only one worth
mentioning...) I now have a new everything but the master cylinder and hope
to install most of it tomorrow.  I still need to acquire the e-brake arm for
the driver's rear hub but I think I can scrape one up.

I'll post news of my successful installation later (or I'll be whining
pitifully).

Bob J.
