Anthony,

Don't feel bad, I've done much worse.  

That piece you were trying to replace is much easier to replace with the 
tranny out.  Do you have a stick or automatic?  I wouldn't leave it in 
there.  The clutch on the '86 I had would take any chance it got to screw up.

On the other hand, there might be enough clearance in the bottom of the  
bell housing that you could leave it till whenever.  

If you gotta manual, I would break the tranny loose to get the thing 
out.  I think you could even leave the CV's connected and still get an 
inch or two between the engine and the tranny.  It's really not much of a 
job to pull the tranny once you get use to it.  I did mine once in about 
2.5 hours, by myself in the dirt.

&gt; Yesterday will replacing my starter on my 86 vanagon I made a really

&gt; How can I get it out? Do I need to pull transmisson, bell housing, etc??
&gt; There is a small plug (1&quot;) under transaxle but I assume this is for transmissionfluid. It looked as if there might be small bottom section of bell housing that
&gt; might come off by itself but now i think its only lines of aluminumn casting.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas??
