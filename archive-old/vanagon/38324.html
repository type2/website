Subject: Of all things...

	Volks,
	While driving up to Sacramento during my bachelor party
(breakfast, lunch and two airplane museums along a 300 mile drive
via Vanagon) we spotted a Rialta. Actually, although we were in an
'88 Vanagon with no more than 20k on the heads, the Rialta passed us
both before and after bridge over the Sacramento River (My brother
picked a better path through the traffic...) The Rialta is HUGE,
it looked a foot wider on each side of the body than the T4, and easily 
18 inches higher. Clearly not short of power cruising power.

	Cheers, all!
	Bill
