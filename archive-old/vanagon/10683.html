Subject: Re: grinding noise over speed bumps

If the noise is exactly one Knar on each upstroke and one Knirsch on each
downstroke, suspect the A-arm bushings.  I've been living with this all the
while I've had my Toy Box.  Noise on mine is closely related to classic 
spooky movie squeaky door sound, but speed bumps definitely bring it out.

I have not gotten enough time and desperation together to compress my spring
and tear my front suspension apart, nor have I found any way to get lubricant
on the squeak.  I asked the dealer and they want $200 for the search- part
and an unknown additional amount for the -and-destroy part of solving the
problem.  That price reminded me that I can't hear the noise over the engine
and wind noise anyway.
