Subject:  update on the long journey 

my brother is leaving montana today with my new (81) adventurewagen,
and will be here (northern michigan) early next week, hopefully. the
feeling i have is worse (better?) than christmas eve as a kid.  therefore,
i'm taking the week off to get acquainted/camp out, and will be signing off
for a little bit.  too bad i don't have access to a laptop and cellular phone
like some lucky folks ;^ ]
