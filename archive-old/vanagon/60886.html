Subject: Time to switch oil grade from SAE30?

My idiot light comes on at low RPMs (&lt;1200) with SAE30 once the 
engine is good and warmed up.  The PO had put in the 30 weight to 
slow the oil leak which has now been fixed.

Time to switch back to 20W50 (kinda like the other thread on oil)?  
Or should I just &quot;fuggedaboudit&quot;?
