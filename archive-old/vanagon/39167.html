&gt;Every time we return from crossing the channel British Customs see us a 
mile
&gt;away..you can seee them nudge each other and we always get stopped....yet 
when

Amen!

Everytime I pass a cop in my bus.  I know he's thinking  that I've got a 
hundred pound bale of herb under the back seat.  I know I got a ticket in 
Tennessee just for driving a VW bus.  The cop was lying when he said I was 
going 52 in a 35.  Plus, he waited until another cop joined him before he 
pulled me over.  They must have been certain that they had a big drug bust 
on their hands!  Too bad, nothing on me!

By the way, it was in a little sh*t hole town by the name of Benton, Tenn. 
 in Polk County.  They really have a thing about stereotyping &quot;hippie&quot; 
types there.
Proof is on my web page.  They told me to wait in the bus, but I got out 
and took pictures instead!  Ha!
