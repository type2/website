Subject: RE: BRAKES FOR E VANS

Most shops cut the rotors due to the experience of having them warp form heat 
spots developing while the pads get seated to an uneven surface. Personally, 
with the current brake materials and the long life most brake systems give,  
rotors are really consumable items and should be treated as such.  Figure you 
60K on  a brake job, measure the rotors, if okay turn them, if not or 
marginal, replace.  From experience, there is nothing like a full brake job 
with new drums, rotors, pads, and cylinders or calipers when needed.

Dennis.

PS, Don't forget to replace the brake fluid.

I replaced pads a while back. Austin Vee Dub could find only the OEM type for 
about $80 as I remember. Try Ron at the Bus Depot (on the list).

I think rotors are replaced/remachined much more than is really needed - good 
source of income for shops. If the surfaces aren't too uneven careful brake-in 

 makes the pads conform well in a short time. But do wear them in before you 
have to depend on a quick stop.

  Has any E VAN owners replaced the front brakes yet? Are there any
aftermarket sources for pads and rotors? I'm down to the nubs on mine and the
dealers price of over $350 is way out there.    Thanks  SPENCER
