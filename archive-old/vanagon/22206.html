&gt; Does anyone know of any problems related to the use of synthetic oils (i.e. Mobil 1)
&gt; in the aircooled engines.  I figure that if I am going to baby the engine in my bus
&gt; I should go to extremes.  Thanks in advance.

I ran Mobil 1 15-50 in my bus for the last 8,000 miles, and didn't
notice much of a difference.  It ran a little cooler, I think (at least,
according to the gauge).  I have since switched back to Dino-oil, since
I like to change it frequently.
