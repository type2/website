Subject: '54 deluxe progress

        Did more sandblasting today.  Dean (busfarmr) came by and helped.
The blasting itself is pretty straightforward and easy, its just trying to
get the undercoating off the wheelwells and stuff thats a pain.  Any
suggestions here would be appreciated.  I'm thinking about
getting some heavier media to use for these areas.

        I'm down to the 2-3rd use for this batch of media, and I'm starting
to get a lot of dust.  I think I'll probably use it one more time and toss it.
