the description says 58-61


Inside the engine compartment, to the right of the engine on the fixed
part of the metal, is the number 672483, or maybe 612483-- second digit
didn't have much of a top, but was leaning to the right.

that makes it either May 1960 or  October 1960

This thing is amazingly complete-- only piece I could see missing, was
lock or push button from the engine hatch. Hatch hinges were real stiff.
--
they didn't have an engine door exterior latch after barndoor till '66

and yes- it would have come with 15&quot; ties, but 165R15 is a bug tire.

good luck
