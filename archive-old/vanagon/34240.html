&gt; Is this the stuff you used when replacing your points? you put just a
&gt; little on the distributor cam that the points rider rubs on, to open
&gt; and close the points, so it won't wear down to a nub?

	I asked for point lube at the local foreign FLAPS.  &quot;Hmmm... nope!
We're all out.  A little tube of that will last you a lifetime!&quot;  Thanks
bud.  Next I tried at Kever Onderdelen... evidently &quot;Beetle Parts&quot; in Dutch...
quite a dive for a FLAPS.  But that's another story.  Anyhow, Dirk says,
&quot;Point lube?  Nope.  That's the kind of thing a father gives to his son...
who gives it to his son...  You never run out.&quot;

	Yes, I actually did consider phoning my father... :-O

	On a whim, I stopped by some place... hmmm, CarQuest or something.
Cars parked out front look like they're straight outta Dukes of Hazzard.
Hmmmm, *them* cars must have points I sez.  Go in.  Hmmm, the doods behind
the counter look like they're straight outta Dukes of Hazzard, too!
Got any point lube?  &quot;Well, let's see.  Got some lubricants over here.
Did you want dielectric grease?&quot;  &quot;Point lube, please.&quot;  &quot;Hey Billy, you
ever seen any point lube in here?&quot;  &quot;Lemme go look in the back..........
...nnnoooooope.&quot;  Then an older guy comes out from the back.  &quot;Whaddya
lookin' for?  Point lube?  Hmm, check in the blah-blah catalog.&quot;  So Billy
has a look in the blah-blah catalog, goes in the back; comes up with a
little box.  &quot;This what you want?&quot;  I open it up:  ahhh, point lube!!!

	Don't remember just what it cost, but you could say it knocked the
wind out of a ten-spot.  If it were toothpaste, wouldn't last me a week.

	I plan to give it to my daughter some day. :)

	If anybody wants the CarQuest part number, I can post.
