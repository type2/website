&gt; Eeeeek!
&gt; 
&gt; What RPM? or speed? 
       I was going about say.... 20 mph.
  
  any idea, it shouldn't have overrevved, the FI would
&gt; shut off the gas nicely (BTDT), and the engine braking should be sufficient
&gt; to prevent runaway I presume...  so I'm lost.
&gt;
       The clutch pedal was in. Motor was at idle.
 
&gt; I'm guessing the clutch disc had a lot of cracks in it, and finally let go
&gt; at higher but normal RPMs. If you look at some pieces where they broke you
&gt; may be able to see 'beach marks' like the sand ripples on a beach.  These
&gt; show the growth of fatigue cracks (like tree rings)  The surface appears
&gt; dull gray, where the metal has been progressively parting.  Once it lets go
&gt; the metal should appear more jagged, since it's tearing apart fast.
&gt; Finally, if there are small areas silvered over this is where the loose
&gt; pieces have been bumping into one another.  So, longterm slow failure should
&gt; show beach marks + tear zone (maybe +silvering), quick failure is tear zone
&gt; only. Any chance the pilot bearing in the hub is out to lunch too? Although
&gt; this is not attached to the disc it keeps the shaft/disc centered and
&gt; spinning properly.  It _may_ be a factor.  Keep us posted, this could've
&gt; been real nasty shifting from 3rd to 4th on the highway at 55+mph!!!!
&gt; Thanks, glad no personal damage.   tim
&gt; 
    I think it was just stupid of me to keep it in Creeper gear with the
    clutch in. At 6:1 gear reduction, times 1st gear Rpm, at 20 mph,
    the disc was flying. I think the G-force would distroy any disc!
&gt; 
    Oh Well another week of work to add to the list!
