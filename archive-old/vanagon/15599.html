Subject: CV Joint Advice

One of the inner CV joints from my Synchro is sitting on the kitchen counter.
 Question:   Could someone tell me how much wear is acceptable before one
replaces the joint?  There is no rust, pitting or other damage other than
&quot;grooves&quot; or &quot;depressions&quot; where the balls have been riding on the outside
race(does bearing terminology apply to cv joints?). The wear grooves are
distinct--they can be seen and felt.

Thanks.  Dan
