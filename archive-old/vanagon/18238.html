To All:

I'm not sure how serious B. was about using a lawn mower engine to power an
automotive AC unit but I did exactly that several years ago to provide
refrigeration at a mining claim.  Turns out, we needed about ten horsepower
to run the thing effectively, plus I had to rig an alternator to power a fan
for the condenser.   The only real problem was purging and charging the
system with regrigerant.  

If you've the space for it, operating your airconditioning from an auxiliary
power unit is a valid idea; truckers do it all the time.
