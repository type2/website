&gt; I have a 69 westfalia van, no pop-top.  It has about 50k on an engine 
&gt; rebuild (170K total mileage).
&gt; 
&gt; In about the last 3k, it has begun to backfire occasionally on 
&gt; deceleration.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this indicative of any impending problems, or should I just relax and 
&gt; enjoy scaring the occasional pedestrian??
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I've about given up flashing/waving at other VW's.  There are so 
&gt; many around here that I'm always reaching/waving - and the response is 
&gt; almost non-existant.
&gt; 
Two possibilities: a) your mixture is too weak which can be easily solved
through a proper adjustment of the  carb(s) and throttle positioner (does the
car run on or stall-this could be a sign of weak mixture or vacuum leak); b)
one or more of your valves
are out of adjustment or worse broken; assume the first and make sure that
after you have checked for all vacuum leaks (this can be done by spraying
WD40 around the intake manifold and gasket area - if the engine stalls
then there is a leak) that you set the timing; adjust the valves to .006&quot;;
adjust the point gap and clean your plugs;

Good luck - DC
