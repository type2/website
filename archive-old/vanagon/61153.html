Subject: Re: [Fwd: Radio Removal]

For All those folks who own Audis, V-dubs, and BMWs who want to remove
their radios for whatever reason...

	Go to your nearest WalMart...  they have the removal tool for about
$2.50 for the pair with the proper pointed tips and the notches that
hook onto the removal tabs to pull radio out...

	I just used them to pull the radio out of my Audi 5000S wagon and they
worked just fine...

	Take Care

		JonR
