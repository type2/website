Subject: propane fill valve / update

with regrards to leaky square fill valves , mines an 85 ...
 I called Mancester Tank Co., Linwood CA

          # 800 877 8265

you can order valve rebuild kits with instructions for about $4.00
UPS COD only, no visa or credit card.

Replacement valves are no longer available .  The company
that produced them went out of business.

new tank with the &quot;new&quot; style valve is $ 343 retail list.  Mancester
does not sell direct to end user, but will send you a rebuild
kit for the valve.

I've asked them to send UPS red .. so will keep yall up to date as 
I progress.
