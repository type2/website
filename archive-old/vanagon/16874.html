Subject: Please don't mix used brake fluid and used oil

	Unka Joel heard that one can just pour used brake fluid and
used collant into oil... I've heard that the chlorinated alcohols in
brake fluid cannot be easily separated out of used motor oil and 
therefore the inclusion of brake fluid makes the container of motor
oil ALL toxic waste which can only be incinerated. At great cost per
gallon, and the oil is lost from the recycling loop.
	I'm not asking for everyone to send their unwanted, their
huddled masses of DOT-3 cans, to me. But it seems that there is
a pretty readily available system for dealing with used oil, and
that some small amount of work ought to find places for brake
fluid and coolant. I do ask that people consider taking a little
extra time to be really good about this stuff.
	And yeah, I've got a guilty conscience from motor oil
I've seen poured into a hole in the ground, brake fluid mixed with
oil and left at recycling, coolant flushed down the storm sewer.
Its never too late to start doing a better job, and every person
DOES make a difference. That's why we own busses!
