&gt; David, come up to Ramona some time and I will put one of your fancy hotrods
&gt; on one of my two infrared scopes one time and show you how wrong you are. Let
&gt; me lean out any of your engines and see if we get high CO.Are you willing to
&gt; risk burnt valves on your knowledge? Trust me I have performenced tuned
&gt; anything from a 500 SEC to 930 to 735 to vvette, jaguar xjs to a motorhome
&gt; and have built  many performance engines. HIGH CO is rich.Ed

Oooh, looks like I touched a nerve.  First off I know that running lean
can lead to burnt valves - I never implied that it didn't.  I observed
the high CO with lean mixture at a California smog inspection station,
and watched it go away when the mixture was richened.  Say what you
want, that is what I saw.  As for trusting you, Mr. &quot;tuned anything from
a 500SEC to 930 to 735 to Vette, Jaguar&quot; but still can't avoid using
runon sentences, I will not trust you nor any other &quot;trained mechanic&quot;
to work on my &quot;fancy hotrods&quot;.  I've been screwed too many times by the
likes of you. Sorry to flame you in front of the list, but hey, you 
started it.David
