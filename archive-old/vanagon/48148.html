Subject: Re: VW Flower Power /F

&gt;i've gotten into a new habit yesterday. our yard is producing oodles of
&gt;beautiful flowers. we cut and cut and cut some more but always have soooo
&gt;many. know what i do now? i always carry a fresh bunch with me and put them
&gt;on vw buses when i seem them parked in the Triangle area of North Carolina.
&gt;i've gotten Richard Palmer's old bus twice in two days! muahahahahahahah

In the internet spirit of picking a beautiful idea to death (and since it's
friday!), here are some reasons why it's not a good idea to leave flowers on
a bus:

1.  They could attract hummingbirds which will eventually nest in your
cooling fan

2. Could attract killer African bees (as if a bus owner doesn't have enough
variables to worry about as it is)

3.  Could attract Hare Krishnas

4.  Flowers might cover windshield NRA sticker

5.  Fertilizer chemicals dripping from flower stems could react with 30 year
old Sekurit laminated glass and create a new quasi-organic life form that
devours VW buses


&gt;so if you are in nc and see a beautiful flower under the left hand wiper on
&gt;your windowshield, you know i've been there!

I guess malicious flower gnomes just stick the flowers up the tailpipes...

Happy friday!
