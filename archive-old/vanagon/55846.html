Subject: Rubber molding on pop up top

The rubber molding (rather the metal clasps in it which are rusting) on the
pop up top of my 86 camper is starting to come loose on the rear end of the
drivers side. The local dealers have proven to be less than useless! Has
anyone else had the same problem and/or does anyone have a solution? No I'm
NOT buying a new top!
