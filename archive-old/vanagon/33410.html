Subject: 85 Vanagon Stalling

This started happening on Saturday evening.  Driving along, engine stalls,
lights come on--usually starts right back up, if not immediately, then after
a few minutes.  When the engine is running, it runs perfectly (well, as
perfectly as it ever does) leading me to believe this must be something
electrical.  I tried bypassing the Idle Stabilization Unit and this seemed
to &quot;fix&quot; the problem temporarily, but alas, it's cutting out again.

Where to start?
