&gt;What do you think Steve, can you think of some various sampling points on
&gt;yer vehicle that you'd like to monitor (like clutch plates?) ;-)

Ha ha.   &gt;:-p

Seriously, I wish I could somehow monitor a vibration level. But
seat-of-the-pants method is probably good enough. The V6anagon was
talking all those months (see my mentions about engine droning and
shifter-handle vibration in many previous posts), but I just wasn't
listening.   :(

Other than that, how about CHT, EGT, O2 sensor output, voltage at
starter terminal, voltage/current at generator output, manifold pressure,
water temp, oil press and temp, fuel flow rate (questionalble use), just
for starters. Oh yeah, starter current.

Accelerometers, anyone?   :^)

Thanks for the addresses!

Steve
