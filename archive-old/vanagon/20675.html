Subject: more on Trans mounts...

Well, I drove foo to the train station after replacing the shift coupler.
Before I headed down the road I place a small wooden block under the Trans
and above the cross member as I am certain now the front transmission mount
has gone all the way south.  I could not believe the change in the shifting. 
Wow! Even my wife could drive the bus now.  Question(s):  If I wanted to 
replace the front mount is there a way to do this w/o removing engine. (I'm
really pressed for time the next two weeks and even saving an hour will help.)
If the engine's coming out, do I have to remove the swing axle to move the
transmission enuf to get the new front mount in?  Also, I purchased (from RMMW)
the shift rod bushing (its plastic with a clip) that I suppose goes near the
front of the rod somewhere.  Help!  Can anybody send me a copy of a diagram
(i.e., from Bentley) of the linkage set-up.  Much Thanks et al....
