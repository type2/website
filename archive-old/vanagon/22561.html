Subject: Re: Should I buy this bus?


I forgot to mention that the bus I am considering purchasing
has an external oil cooler mounted on the roof and the rear
of the engine is supported by a chain.  This was not the
original rear engine mount was it?

Sorry guys, I can't take it any longer...  This was a joke.
It is Friday, you know.  The weirdest thing about this is 
these were all features of buses I have called about or
someone has called me to ask my advice on whether to buy or
not.

I can't wait to go 'fishing' again.  Some of you were really
optimistic.

ROTFLMAO
