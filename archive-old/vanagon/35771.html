&gt; I priced out the oil cooler and O-ring seal---$205.00  OUCH!
&gt;     Does anybody know of another source for theses things? Dennis H.-any 
&gt;     help? I didn't have the money with me for the cooler, so I will prolly 
&gt;     order it tomorrow. For a while today, I debated either removing the 
&gt;     cooler and running without it, or replacing it with one of those 
&gt;     cheaper air-cooled types. I have talked myself out of it, however, and 
&gt;     will prolly just order the one from the dealer.

As a temporary fix, you can do without it.  Block off the hoses and replace
the long nipple with a standard one off any ford or chrysler.   Look for used
one or consider putting that $200.00 towards a real oil cooler set-up.  My
van has 16 plate flat cooler in front of the radiator, thermostat controlled.
 Done lots of these instalations. Works great.  Maintains temp 210 or less
most conditions.
Dennis.
