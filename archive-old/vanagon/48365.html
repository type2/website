mike,

go to your local checker (on 28th) (or somewhere else, it doesnt 
matter), buy the haynes vw bus manual.  then go to sears and buy 
yourself a set of craftsman metric sockets, a socket wrench (3/8&quot; 
drive), and a set of metric combination wrenches.

read the book, and then crawl under your van, remove the valve covers 
with a large screwdriver, and adjust the valves all to .007&quot; or .008&quot; 
(if you are afraid of burning one).

i guarantee that by working on your van yourself you will enjoy it more 
and be more confident in it.  furthermore, you will be sure the job has 
been done right.

good luck, and enjoy your new child

evan
