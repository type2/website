Subject: EV Norcold fridge woes update


Re: NORCOLD REFRIGERATOR NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY IN LP MODE.
Here is a compilation of information provided by Vanagon listees
and discussions with Winnebago, Norcold. Norcold claims that all 
95-97 Eurovan Winnebago campers have the same fridge model #3163G. 

- Norcold refrigerator not starting on propane; burner ignites but flame 
  won't hold; several months of warranty headaches until the intermittent
  problem was finally diagnosed: apparently the igniter wire to the burner 
  box had such light insulation, that it can short to adjacent metal; the 
  fix was to replace with more heavily shielded cable (at least 6 list 
  complaints known) 

- on the proper setting of the thermostat knob; my appliance control board 
  shows START at 12 o'clock, no OFF position, the Norcold 3163 Manual 
  (also the Eurovan Service Training Manual) picture show OFF at 12 o'clock, 
  START at 2 o'clock; Norcold says the appliance diagram is wrong, START 
  really means OFF (!!!!), manual is right, for a successful start use 
  the 6 o'clock position, or max 11 o'clock position per Kevin Lindbloom 

- Norcold claims that all Eurovan Winnebago campers have the same Norcold
  fridge model 3163G, and should have an &quot;update vent fan kit&quot; 
  (part #618074) installed

- Norcold refrigerator in LP mode not starting or stopping at altitudes above 
  5000 ft (at least 4 list complaints known); the Winnebago technician mentioned
  to me on jul.14.97 that the problem is known to Winnebago, and that the 
  installation of a &quot;high altitude enhancement vent kit&quot; (Norcold part #618960)
  is recommended (given my headaches, I would say required), under warranty? 

- LP level indicators unreliable: for battery voltage indicator one should  turn 
  on a light or apply some other light load (3 list complaints)

No Eurobago owner has specifically been notified by the vendor of these problems, 
caveat emptor! Rick Gordon in his post yesterday has volunteered to store this 
information in his Eurovan web page (in preparation).
