if you have a camper, there was a modification that looked pretty neat:
a fellow down your way (in FL) got a 120VAC household air conditioner
(window unit) that was rather small, and put it in the luggage compartment
up front on the roof. he had a tube made up that zipped into the zip-out
window in the pop-top canvas. so when he pulled up to a camping spot
(with ac power, of course), he'd pop the top and hook up his tube-thingie
and plug himself in.

if you do NOT have a camper, you've got a problem. however. one fellow
here locally got one of those RV rooftop add-on air conditioners and
mounted it atop his vanagon. looked like a big luggage carrier. he even
went so far as to mount a small gas powered generator on the front bumper
so he could run it while he was driving. looked weird but it seemed to
work.
