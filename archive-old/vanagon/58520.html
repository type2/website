Hey all,
This is just to let you know of a new addition to my web pages.  I am
attempting to compile a list of tech articles (how-to procedures) for
certain maintenance and other items of interest on our air-cooled VWs.
I've got a few articles so far, including how to:

Install a relay kit to prevent the &quot;hot start&quot; problem.
Time your engine (revised today, much better than it was).
Fix leaky pushrod tube seals (needs cleaning up, will do soon).
Adjust your automatic choke (Ron Van Ness' article, I hope you don't
mind Ron).

Submissions are welcome as are corrections.

URL is http://www.mwc_dot_edu/~sbart7kb/tech.htm
