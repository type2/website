&gt;Here in San Diego, CA, gasoline has jumped up to $1.50 per gallon
&gt;(that's about 40 cents per litre).  This is an increase of over 20%
&gt;in the last month.
&gt;HAve other parts of the USA had such a large increase?

well, not THAT much ... but it jumped from $1.19 to $1.29 in one week for
regular, and $1.27 to $1.41 for premium. in some places, it's already as
high as $1.45/gallon for premium. and the tv news folks say it's going higher
this summer.

which is rather odd, since the CNN business news was saying that the cost of
the crude oil was expected to DECREASE from $21/barrel to $16/barrel by the
end of June.

gee ... do i feel a screwing-of-the-customer coming on???  oh, yeah ...
i forgot: it's summer, people take more vacations, so it costs more to make
the gasoline (cause they have to hire temporary workers and pay them a lot
of overtime ... to make up for all the gasoline company workers who are on
vacation. see, it's really not a conspiracy!)
