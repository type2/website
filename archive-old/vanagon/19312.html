This is too cool, a dealer with a great informative
WWW page, I mean a VW dealer who is not in the dark
ages, its INCREDIBLE, plus a real neat EV panelvan
picture, I don't know if they are any good but if
I lived in Alberta, Canada, I'd give em a shot, they rent
EV campers for vacations as well, way way too cool

anyway the location is
