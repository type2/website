Subject: RE: Much mail

This list is a community, like the one I live in, I don't socialize with all 
the neighbours, just some, but if anyone needs a hand and I can help then so 
be it. My community is not ideal, but I live with it, just like you're going 
to do with this list :) Feel free to add [EV], [AC] or [H2O] whatever in the 
header if you think it will help matters. Tim Smith

&gt;Volks Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I am more than a little overwhelmed with the amount of mail I am recieving
&gt;from the vanagon list - 140 pieces this morning.
&gt;
&gt;Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to a
&gt;couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
&gt;windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?  That way an individual could
&gt;sign on to one or all depending on his/her interests.
&gt;
&gt;Dan
