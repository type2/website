Yes, I got one of the SA's 85 liter gas tanks. But I can't use them because 
of
the extension to the rear. This hits my exhaust system. What kind of details
you like to know? I have a drawing on hand.

I just called about the 1.5 Gal gas tank that fits in the spare - the 
Company
no longer &quot;imports&quot; this Item - anyone know of another source? And hey what
about the 21 gal tank on the SA Vanagons - anyone ever get their hands on 
one?
