Subject:       Propane

okay, a few words based upon my recent foray into the guts of the 
fridge... where's Derek when we need him?

i don't think the fridge draws 20 amps (vanagon_at_lenti 
apologies for stepping on toes, postings, faces).  there are 2 fuses 
controlling power behind the drivers seat... one is a 8 amp (white) 
and the other is 15 amp (pink).  i may have the exact amperage wrong 
but the 12v heater goes thru the pink fuse and i don't think pink is 
20 amps (joel?).  secondly, specs for similar fridges quote typically 
7 amps on DC power.  thirdly, the size of the wiring on the 12v 
heater wasn't commensurate with handling 20 amps (even assuming 
el-cheapo bean counter production engineers).

i drive with the propane on however Harry is right.  it is more 
dangerous.  i should probably stop.  a fracture in a line or fitting 
after a crash could fill the interior with propane and when they get 
the power saw and jaws of life out to extract you, a spark could 
ignite everything.  if the main valve is off, the tank could split 
and release propane but it wouldn't be held in the confines of the 
interior-- so it may flare but less chance of an explosion.

on my '87, there *is* a device that restricts propane flow after the 
main valve and before the regulator.  so if a regulator malfunctions, 
is broken off or a gas line ruptures, the flow is restricted down to 
a gentle stream.  this still wouldn't keep the interior from slowly 
filling up in the case of a line fracture.

i guess everything is a chance.  one can reduce one more aspect of 
endangerment by not traveling with the propane on... i'm still not 
sure i'm going to stop doing that tho...
