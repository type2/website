Subject: coolant pipes

Hi Folks,

rusted coolant pipes in 1.9l engines are an easy fix (you DO have to
drop the gas tank) I used 1&quot; inside diameter heater hose.  largest
available at auto supply house.  Those of you by the beach should try a
marine store for 1.25&quot; ID.  No overheats/changes at all with the 1&quot; ID
stuff though.This is reinforced rubber hose.  You need 10 feet, cost me
$1.59/ft.  If both ends of your steel pipe are still good, cut them off
leaving about 2-3&quot; of pipe.  This will 'just' wedge into the 1&quot; heater
hose, use goop and TWO (2) band clamps per end.  Then plug back into
hoses at engine/rad.  I would not try the cut and patch method, you
might buy a month or so, then do it again elsewhere.  If the ends of the
real coolant pipes are gone, mine was at engine end, get a suitable
adapter/reducer in a plumbing supply store, roughly 1&quot; to 1.25&quot;
connection.  Don't use nylon/plastic, get steel ones.  Easy fix, &lt;$20,
plus you get to clean and paint the top of your gas tank, once you get
over the shock of how bad it looks. :) And why not run a radflush and
then fresh coolant etc while at it?  Count on a day to complete what is
about 4 hours work.  Get some nylon tie-wraps to hold up the hose.  Bye,
Tim
