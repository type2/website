&gt;&gt;No.... work it out as an agreement in advance with them before they start 
&gt;&gt;work. They may agree in advance and take out your risk.

&gt;&gt;Ask for Grant if you use the same place.

Hi James:

I just called Grant at Antonio Volkswagon talking about my westy's head gasket
problem. He said most likely VWoA would pay 40% of the bill. I told him that
his name was given by you and VW paid 80% of your bill. Grand still remembers
you. Then he said I have to bring in the car, tear apart the engine, determine
what needs to be repaired, call VWoA to determine what they will pay and then
I would know how much VW would pay and how much I have to pay.

It seems that there is no way I can have an agreement in advance with them.
I am afraid once the engine is torn apart it will up to them what they want
to do with my car. I will have no choice if they want me to pay 80% of the
bill.

I also called VWoA. They basically refused to provide any help to me.

What's your suggestion? How did you get an agreement ahead of the repair with
Grant? Again, much appreciated for your comments.

David
