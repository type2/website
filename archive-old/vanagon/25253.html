&gt;The rear shocks on the Thing have given up the ghost. I currently do not
&gt;have the $$$ for KYB, or equivalent shocks. What I need to know is, what
&gt;are the next best, that do not go into the $30+ range. I realize prices
&gt;vary from state to state, what I am looking for is a name that I can
&gt;afford, that will give me a good ride for less bucks than the best ones


I put Gabriel Red Ryders on my bus. Got them from Sears. I believe they cost 
about half that. YMMV. They seem fine...
