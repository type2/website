Barry (and others...),

Try:
     Wolf Automotive Products
     121 N. Sullivan Street
     Santa Ana, CA  92703
     800-822-9653
     714-835-2126

Nice &quot;Custom Auto Nose Bra&quot; with good padding and clips. I did have to 
modify (cut out) the screen that covered the headlights because it would 
pack up in wet snow. Other than that it's been great.

&gt;Also, I still haven't seen any phone numbers for the company that someone
&gt;(sorry-I forgot who) said had better nose protectors than the dealer. 
Anyone
&gt;have a lead? Later.....
