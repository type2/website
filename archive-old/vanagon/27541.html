Subject: Re: Aux. Heaters in Vans

After I replied to this thread last night I spent some time thinking 
about using a gas heater overnight.  I came to the conclusion that it 
would be better to just install a propane heater for several reasons, 
some of which I already outlined in the previous post.  My apologies if 
I'm being redundant.

CONS
----
1. The heater relies on a fresh battery for complete combustion.  Once 
the battery voltage drops below a certain threshold several things 
happen.  The combustion motor fan slows down and the supply of fresh air 
is reduced.  Voltage at the glow plug/ignitor drops and incomplete 
combustion occurs.  This could conceivably result in excess gasoline 
accumulating in the heater and result in a bomb like ignition at some point.
2. If the ignition were not bypassed to supply voltage to the heater, 
it's concievable that certain electronic components could become damaged, 
thereby rendering the van FORD.
3. Excessive exhaust could trickle back up into the van, if the van were 
parked in tall weeds for example, and asphyxiate (sic) the occupants.
4. Battery drain could render the van FORD.
5. Any problems that cropped up overnight would not be tended to until 
the occupants were awakened by the sound of their tires exploding from 
the flames.  I don't know about you, but that would definitely start my 
day out on the wrong foot.

PROS
----
1. You get to stay warm while camping overnight.

IMO, the cons outweigh the pros here.  Buy a propane heater and install 
it, you'll be better off.  Just the fact that the heater would reside 
there in the passenger compartment where I could keep one eye on it would 
help me rest easier.
