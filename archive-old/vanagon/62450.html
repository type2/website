&gt; Hello,

&gt; I just returned from a couple of weeks in Spain and Portugal. I saw a f=

Hello to all.=20


	Until he/she/it/you makes some years the vehicles that circulated
through Spain they were single national vehicles (SEAT, FIAT, CITROEN,
PEUGEOT and some that another that alone they were manufactured in
Spain), all the other marks were of import as much Japaneses as
Europeans, and they had a load of very high taxes, so he/she/it/you is
quite difficult find buses air cooled. =09

This in Canarias doesn't happen, since I/he/she/it/you here existed what
I/he/she/it/you was denominated frank ports (tax-free) and there is
great variety of marks so much Japaneses, Europeans, American, etc. for
much time.  A curious note is for example that the great majority of the
taxis that there is in [canarias] is marks like Mercedes, Volvo, BMW and
cars of great luxury since the taxes in this type of vehicles are very
low.

You/he/she/it in Canarias could be seen buses of the year 1962 from now
on with frequent use, either of transport of goods or matters and there
are great variety of spare parts.
