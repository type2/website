Subject: vw dealers refuse to work anyting over 10 years .. 

Eeek!  Joel, I hope that Galvo doesn't read this ...

&gt;MG, Triumph, Peugeot, Renault, Citroen, Opel (another 
&gt;GM fiasco), Fiat,  Yugo (well ... ) ... any others?

... he is an Opel-fruit.  Say anything bad about his Opel is 
like maligning my Transporter - it's not done if you value your 
life.

You have been warned ... :&gt;
