Hey all,
Thanks to everybody (and I do mean everybody) for responding to my gas
smell question.  General consensus is to pry off that circular plate and
see if the filler neck gets wet when I slosh the gas around in the tank.
Well, I tried to get the plate off but the air cleaner support bracket
is right where my screwdriver needs to be to pry it off.  How the hell
can I get this thing off???  I can't get any leverage on it now.  

Thanks,
Sean
