Subject: Westfalia &quot;Poptop&quot; Camper Parts

 Westfalia Owners everywhere know how *outrageously* expensive
 parts for their beloved buses can be.
 I have compiled sources for used parts (salvage yards nationwide), as
 well as sources for new &quot;aftermarket&quot; poptop seals and canvas.
 For INFO, please REPLY (E-Mail me) and include *POPTOP INFO* in
 the Subject field.
