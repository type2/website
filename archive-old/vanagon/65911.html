Subject:      Mirco film available

HI Volks,
   While cleaning up at the dealership I work at I found a pile of old
Vanagon, type 2, and camper  Microfilms.   I was told I could have them
so I'm offering them here.  Unforunatly Ihaven't found any pre-68 films
(we still have one on hand at the shop) But I do loads of vanagons and a
few type 2's.  If someone is interested, let me know.  If VWoA finds out
I'll deny all knowledge.  May of them are old but the pic are cool to
look at.  Almost better than the Bentley.  I also have extra copies of
the rest of the VW line too.  Rabbit, Golf, Jetta, Scriroco, Quantum,
Fox, Corrado and Passat.  There are a few Beetles in there as well.  It
would be a shame to toss them out. Let me know.  Take care.
