    Don't Forget....

    A week from today... Sunday August 24th is the Show in Terryville
CT...

    Hoping to get there in style this year... my Orange '73 Westy
Automatic &quot;Julius&quot; w/ Westy side tent....

    I'll be selling a multitude of VW toys... mostly late '60s to early
'80s stuff with a few more recent pieces... no type II stuff tho (that
all is staying at my house&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)
