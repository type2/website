&gt; The only question is, how can I *afford* to go bus-hunting outside the

	I can't provide you with all the answers, but I had some
thoughts that might be helpful.

&gt; Yes, I know about the &quot;Classifieds 2000&quot; webpage.  But I'm sure it
&gt; doesn't traffic nearly the volume of ads that one of the more (gasp)
&gt; mainstream classifieds papers would handle.  What's out there, Volks?

	Well, you can get to some &quot;mainstream classifieds papers&quot;
on the web.  At

	http://www.sjmercury_dot_com/class/trans/index.htm

you can see the San Jose paper.  I found the following listed in last
Sunday's paper:

VW '59 Panel van Clean! New paint. $1500/bo 408 229-1818
VW '65 Camper, good body, runs great, 12 volt, 1600cc engine $1450 924-0375
VW '71 Poptop camper, new eng/tires, $1450. 924-0375
VW '79 Ultra cmpr van. Road rdy exc. $4200 510 846-0516
VW '79 Bus, AT, 46k. Great cond. $2000. 415 691-0765

	You can get San Francisco ads at:

	http://www.sfgate_dot_com/classifieds/index.html

I found:

VW '59 single cab. 1600. Blue. $1500.415-742-1095
VW '64 Camper, '65 Bug. Nice cond. $2500 ea. 510-932-8445
VW '83 Vanagon W'falia, loaded, propane heat,int lights, clean/well
       maint, $10K, 291-9377 
VW &quot;82 Wfalia dsl. Custom stereo. Exc. $6100. 415-454-0155 
VW '79 Camper. Sink, ice box, carpet, runs exc $2950. 221-9925 


	Public libraries &amp; universities also carry newspapers from all
over.  And there's Hemmings Motor News.

	I suppose it's a time/$ thing, eh?  If one doesn't have the
time to go out &amp; poke around &amp; drive one back, then you'd have spend
extra dough to have it shipped back, etc.  The dough for travel &amp;
shipping would (perhaps!) go a long way toward rust repair.  I know
a fellow who bought a notchback long-distance... actually, he got
shafted the first time he did this... had paid a deposit, but when
he laid eyes on it, it was trashed.  Lost his deposit, learned a lesson.
Second time around, asked lots of key questions and saw many photographs,
etc.  Knew what he was getting, and was quite pleased when it arrived.
YMMV.

Good luck!
