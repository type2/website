I've been doing this for the last couple of months (about 4 times
total), as an experimental phase. It seems to work good. Of course, its
not a perfect wash, (it won't get rid of tree sap marks, insects, dirt
on wheels, etc.) but like you said, takes care of the westie's
hard-to-reach roof. No leaks or other problems detected so far.
