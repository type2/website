&lt;&lt; With the onset of colder weather here in WY, my van has taken on a new
 ailment.  When I first start the engine and the engine is cold, it will
 idle at about 400 RPMs and a high pitch screech will sound from the
 engine compartment.  If I rev the engine, it stops, and it stops if I
 run the engine for 30-40 seconds.  The noise has been getting
 progressively louder as the temperature gets colder.  I haven't been
 able to get to the engine, before the screeching stops, so I can't
 identify where it is coming from.  Is the low idle related to the
 screech or is the screech related to the low idle?

 Any ideas what this problem could be?

it takes you more than 40 seconds to walk to the back of your van????
anyway, it's prolly a ps or alt belt.
