Subject: Any Minnesota Bus Owners?

I recently moved to Minneapolis from Boston and looking for early bus 
owners to swap stories, get advice, and/or admire Bus'.

After moving out here, I bought a '66 Bus that I am currently 
rejuvinating back to its old glory and then some..

Previous rides include a 71' Westy, 76 Bug, and a Squareback..
