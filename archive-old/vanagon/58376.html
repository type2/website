Subject: Running syncro w/o driveshaft?
Date: Mon, 14 Apr 97 9:19:44 PDT

Seems like Ruby-the-red-brick will need a little driveshaft work.  I can't     
think of a mechanical reason why one couldn't drive the legendary conveyance
with the driveshaft missing.  Can Tom or Derek or Jim or Harry or? think of 
one?
