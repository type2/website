&gt;&gt;  huh?  ya think?  maybe this is an industry secret, the great Parts
&gt;&gt;  Conspiracy.  sell customers a $3000 fluid coupling when all it needs it a
&gt;&gt;  change of $20 worth of silicone brake fluid.  whose willing to try on
&gt;their
&gt;&gt;  trashed unit?
&gt;
&gt;While admittedly possible, I'd evaluate the chances of this as very, very
&gt;slim.  I've never heard of silicon brake fluid having a characteristic of
&gt;gelling (or otherwise increasing its viscosity) when subjected to shear
&gt;stresses.  I would NOT encourage anyone to experiment with this in their
&gt;Syncro.

Have a new GMC James w/AWD (foolproof for the SO - no levers etc to muck
up), has the same *type* of center transaxle as the Syncros - dealer's
service manager sez &quot;...they're sealed units-we send 'em back to the factory
if they go bad-factory told us never open 'em 'cuz the fluid inside is
incredibly nasty stuff...&quot;  All of which could be pure BS, of course.
