Subject: Wacko Wiring &amp; Snow ?

Hey Guys,

Last night I had to do a road trip to New York.  So I pulled out my
Radio Shack walkie talkie style CB, slapped the antenna on, plugged the
CB in the lighter socket and got on my way.  I asked for a radio check
and got no response, the radio worked in my last car.  

Here's the wierd thing, everytime I went to transmit the seatbelt light
would come on for about 5 sec..  I looked in the Bently to see if the
cig. lighter and seatbelt relay were on the same circuit, it says no.

I know this is a kinda boarderline VW ? but any help would be nice.

Also, Someone posted a comment that Vanagons didn't handle well in
snow.  Is that compared to the Bus or a front wheel drive or what?  How
does it mishandle (fishtail, not turn, not move, wig out at 35 mph)?  I
am concerned as every VW I ever drove, including rabbits, golfs,
dashers, bugs and buses, always did pretty well in the snow.  Point
being, I got a winter road trip to Chicago ahead of me and need to plan
if I have to slow down to nothin when it snows.
