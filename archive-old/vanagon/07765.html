Subject: 87' syncro advice needed

Tim,

I currently own a 87' syncro that I purchased approximately 2 years ago.  The
van has been pretty reliable with only minor repairs needed.  The most costly
repair item has been the replacement of the heads.  These warped during a trip
to Vermont last winter, (The temperature during the night reached 60 below.)
Although the van had over 57,000 miles, VW picked up 90% of the bill.  Recently
the catalytic converter blew.... currently working on repairing.  Other that
that it's been ok.  When pricing replacement parts, try aftermarket warehouses
since the price of parts from VW is high.  I've found the exact same part for
less than 1/3 the cost quoted from the dealer.  Because the syncro is a
&quot;specialty  vehicle&quot; many of the parts are syncro only..ie. rotors, shocks etc.,
and more expensive.  Because of this, the only disadvantage of owning a syncro
is probably the higher maintenance costs, but this can be kept to a minimum if
you can perform  repairs by yourself.
