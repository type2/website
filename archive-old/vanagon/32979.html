Subject: Re: synthetic oil/coolant bleeding + tool

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;out of the system), I'll be running the Syntec until the thing drops. I have
&gt;decided only to invest in a new engine IF I can learn the secrets of
&gt;bleeding the cooling system (I would gladly pay $19.95 for the video of this
&gt;procedure since there is obviously something that I am still doing wrong--I
&gt;still have to resort to parking the van nose down on my neighbor's VERY
                                              ^^^^ UP!! now send me the $19.95!

This just will not work (nose down) since there is no way for the 
coolant/air bubble to drift readily DOWN from the engine then UP to the top 
of the rad.  Your pump will push things along, but mother natures bouyancy 
effect really helps. If you really rev the pump you may move more bubbles 
along, more likely blow more coolant out the bleed screw, unless you use the 
'purge bottle' approach that I like. Saves coolant, makes the operation 
truly a one-person job.

In this regard...  how many people would like to buy a small brass adapter 
to screw into the bleed valve  and slip a length of vinyl tubing over?  I 
made one for myself, could get into 'mass' production using an idle piece of 
equipment we have here in the machine shop, price &lt;&lt;$10, ideally $3-$5 since 
that's all I figure it's worth.  Any interest?
