&gt;        Someone broke into my bus last night, by jimmying open the sliding
&gt;window on the driver or passenger side, I don't know which first 'cause
&gt;they were both open.  And they left them open!
&gt;
&gt;        The horn button had been taken off, and was laying on the seat.  The
&gt;driver's door was ajar, but locked. Somehow they got it open even though it
&gt;was locked!

Locked?  What is locked?  Is the '56 that different from my '61?  The doors
simply &quot;open&quot; from the inside - the locking of the outer handle has nothing
to do with the operation of the inner handle.  If someone has already
pushed open the sliding window they should be able to work the doors via
the inside handle (that's how I work the passenger-side door on The Bozobus
now - hasn't worked quite right since the original handle was impaled on a
telephone pole in a strange parking/backing up accident in '83 - does
anyone else park with their right-side wheels on the curb to keep gas from
flowing out of the filler?).  At one time I made a sliding window lock out
of some fancy plywood that was tabbed to fit behind the slidey one and keep
it from moving...
