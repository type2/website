Subject: Head Gasket problems

Howdy,

I've decided to devote an entire page in the FAQ to the infamous Vanagon
head gasket problems, so I'm bringing up the topic for another go-around.
I apologize to those who have done this to death, but I hope in the future
to just refer people to the web page.

Here are the questions I want to answer:

1.  What is the problem, and how do you know if it's happened to you?

2.  How do I avoid head gasket problems?

3.  Does Volkswagen (of America) fix this under warranty?

4.  How do you get VWoA to pick up the tab, or at least part of the tab?

5.  Is there really some sort of 'secret warranty', and how can I prove it
    to my dealer?

...and any questions I may have missed.  If you reply to this letter,
please let me know if I have permission to use your replies on the web
page.  Thanks.

Ron
