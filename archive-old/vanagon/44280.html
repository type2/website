Subject: Syncro Westie Page back up, and updated
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom F.)

Since my ISP blew away all my Web Page files, I took the opportunity(?) to
restructure the Syncro Westie pages and include my other VW pages and VW
links as well. I have not rebuilt my splittie files yet, but all the Syncro
Westfalia and Eurovan stuff is back.
