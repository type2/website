Subject: WG: Westie 4x4 [not quite VW] / big brother is watching

Anybody who may feel his family or dog or whatever growing to big for a 
Vanagon or Westie but wanting to stick to the make &quot;WESTAFLIA&quot; or 4x4 or even 
both, may obtain help now.

Westfalia are doing a camper conversion on the Mercedes/VW joint-venture Van 
called &quot;Sprinter&quot; at MB and &quot;LT&quot; at VW. The roof is no pop-up but rigid 
offering full clerance for upright standing. There is a kitchen, a seperate 
bathroom and two double beds for the night.

Factory engines are a 5 cyl. 2,9l TDI from the Mercedes E 290 TD with 122HP at 
3800 Rpm and 290 Nm at 2000 Rpm. Or from the VW point of view a 2,5l TDI with 
102 HP 250 Nm. A 2,3 gasoline with 143 HP / 240 Nm is also available for 
either the MB and the VW. Wheelbase can be choosen between 3.000mm, 3.550mm or 
4.025mm The James Cook has the &quot;medium&quot; version with 3.550mm.

4WD is offered by Iglhaut GmbH, Marktbreit near Wuerzburg in three versions: 
selectable, permanent, permanenet+visco-drive. Front suspension is independent 
to raise comfort, the rear one is a standard MB Transporter axle. Ground 
cleaerance is &gt; 26 cm (depending on the tires of course), wading possible up 
to ca. 70 cm. You can choose between all sorts of tires / rim combinations 
from 225/75 R 15 (factory) up to optional 285/75 R 16 Mud Terrain. Front and 
rear diff-locks are options. 
 
Some scanned *.JPG-pictures of interior and exterior were to large for the 
mailing list, but are available on demand: 
CCT_tom_niksch_at_msn_dot_com 
just put &lt;Westie Sprinter pictures&gt; as a subject.

Best regards
