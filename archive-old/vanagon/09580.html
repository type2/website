Subject: AMC HEADS


It's raining in Southern California today, Saturday. Great place to play
football, eh?

When I bought my 80 Westy - it needed an engine rebuild. The garage that did
it told me my heads were no good - &quot;drilled beyond specs&quot; they told me. They
also when on and on about my AMC heads. So I replaced them.

But I never understood what was supposed to be bad about them.

Can anyone kindly fill me in?
