Subject: Starter wire guage? 
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 95 10:11:38 EST
From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

  For all you electronic types, I am finally replacing my automatic
transmission on my other bus, a '78, and the heavy red wires running to
the starter are fried. I want to replace them, but can't tell if they
are 8 or 10 guage. These are the thick red with white stripes wires
running from the alternator / battery area to the starter/solenoid area.
I have some good gas/oil resistant 10 guage wire, can I get away with
that? Any thoughts/ warnings/ advice are greatly appreciated. If
necessary, it's a '72 1700 engine. Thanks

Richard
