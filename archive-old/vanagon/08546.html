  I'll have to see if I can borrow the 914 manual from a guy I know. My  
  recollection is that the bus, 411 and 914 shared heads up through the 1.8
  liter carbureted engine. When the bus got the 2 liter it went back to small
  valves, while the 2 liter 914 got even bigger ones. I know that all the
  type IV engines have exhaust valve stems about 1mm larger in diameter than
  those in the Type 1 engines of the same vintage. Are there some that are
  even bigger? Are those the ones in the 2 liter 914? BTW, I have a Porsche
  parts catalog that has brand-new 2 liter 914 heads for sale, BUT they are
  over $800.00!!!
