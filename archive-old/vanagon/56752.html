Subject: Re: rear heater

&gt;| 	After clamping both coolant hoses with a screw down clamp (can you
&gt;| imagine the vice grips popping off after hitting a big bump?) I removed
&gt;| the heater core and valve. The o-ring didn't have much &quot;o&quot; left, cross
&gt;| section wise; good reason for leak. The valve seems senescent, too. If it
&gt;| can't keep me from blowing air through it when closed, I'm sure that it
&gt;| can't hold back the coolant.

	I recently did the same work, and found my valve didn't really close
all the way. I assume this was designed into the vavle (though I don't really
know of any pausible explanation). Is the valve supposed to actually close
all the way?
