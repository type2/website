Subject: '85 Westy advice needed


I got this personally, I think this should be sent to the list:

Hi ! I recently bought an 85 Westy GL is there anything in particular
I should look out for? I've replaced the power steering and have
ordered a new skylight  since the old one was cracked. Thanks for any
advice,
Rick&gt;
