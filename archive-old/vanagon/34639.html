Subject: RE: placement of list stickers?

&gt;&gt;I think it would be good if we can decide collectively where to place
&gt;&gt;the beautiful new stickers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Bottom left corner of the rear window, gets my vote!

        BZZZZ!!!! Already occupied. Next?   ;-) Actually my choices will be
pretty limited, as my window space has been slowly deteriorating since I
bought the bus...

Peace,
