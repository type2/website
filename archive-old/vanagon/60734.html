Subject: Re: The spirit of the Type II lives!/Lon's Reply

Hello,

I agree.  I was bit miffed at first, but my '86 Syncro is every bit (and
more) a piece of my '71.

&gt; &gt; I was going out to my Westy Vanagon this morning, and thinking that, the
&gt; &gt; Vanagons really don't have the same spirit as the old type II. I mean, they
&gt; &gt; seem sanitized and spiffied up almost to the point that you forget their
&gt; &gt; origins.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I was brought back to reality when my Westy would not start, and a few
&gt; &gt; whacks on the solenoid was all it took to get things going again. Reminded me
&gt; &gt; of the many times I would crawl under my '71 van to short the solenoid
&gt; &gt; terminals with a screwdriver to start it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess this is one design issue that the German engineers passed on from the
&gt; &gt; old type II's. Deep in the soul of the Vanagon, the type II lives.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I drove a '57 singlecab for 20 years, and I miss it dearly.  Not that it was
&gt; a great vehicle -- it really was not, but love of VW busses is not a rational
&gt; thing.  When I finally wrecked the truck, I already had my '80 Westy, but it
&gt; did not seem really like a VW so much.  We eventually bought two more VW's,
&gt; both '86's with the 2L waterboxer.  I finally got back onto familiar ground
&gt; when I needed to replace the valve covers on the Syncro, and gave it the
&gt; covers from my '57.  The spirit not only lives on, even some parts have never
&gt; really changed.  The transporter may have gone through several evolutions,
&gt; but until the T4/EuroVan, the evolutions were really fairly gradual, and the
&gt; model has some true continuity.  Each of the major body changes was not
&gt; accompanied by any major mechaincal change -- a '70 has much more in common
&gt; with a late splitty than it does with a '79, and the '79 is mechanically
&gt; quite the same as an early T3/Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; The spirit lives on, although many splitty owners deny it, some of us do not.
&gt; Perhaps I've become a bit of a Yuppie, but I doubt that I'd really love a
&gt; split as anything other than a collector's item now -- VW made way too many
&gt; improvments over time.
