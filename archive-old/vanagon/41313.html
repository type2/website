Subject: Westy Tent Poles

&gt;Does this mean that 70's westy's have a tent that goes off to the side?!
&gt;I've seen this in like a 61, thought it ended with the fancy pop-top...

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Eric &amp; Maggie (a possibly very incomplete 76 westy)

They ran at least thru '74, and I'm pretty sure much later.

Check out       http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark.tents.html       for the most
complete rundown I've seen on Westy tents. Includes many pictures.
