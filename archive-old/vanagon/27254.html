No the real moral dilemma here is, do you set yourself above the law 
simply because you don't believe in it.  Say for instance I don't believe 
that the murder laws actualy accomplish anything.  Does that mean that I 
may disregard them and murder at will!  I think not.  If the law is bad 
work to change it.  You may not disregard a law merely because it 
inconvieniences you and you believe it does no good.
