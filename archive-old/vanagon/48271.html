&gt;  Westummer?  Humfalia?    Hmmmmm.........

I have a hummer assigned to me in the National Guard.  Its great off road,
but on the highway or improved roads its not very confortable.  I hear the
civilian versions are much nicer.

My military hummer (HMMWV - High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle) can
go about anywhere.  I've forded in water to the top of the hood and climbed
hills at about 30 degrees.  Maintenance is about the same as my VW.  (More
than the average car)  Fuel consumption is higher than I would like in a
civilian car.  Nope, no tradin my Westy for other toys.  (Now adding to the
collection is a different story)  Besides, could you see me painting a peace
sign on the side of a hummer.  Just doesn't seem to go as well.
