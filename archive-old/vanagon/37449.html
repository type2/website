Subject: Gas Smell When Tank Full

OK, when Lief's tank is full and I do a hard left, I get a gas smell 
inside.  I brought it to the Bug Shop and they said that it was the 
rubber boot at the top of the fill neck.  When gas sloshed up against the 
cap it leaked out a crack and then the fumes came up into the inside.

But that didn't completely solve the problem.  It's not as bad but it is 
still happening.  They said that there is still a very minor leak (when 
doing a hard left with a full tank) somewhere on the passenger side under 
the fill neck.  By removing the circular lid inside the engine 
compartment and reaching in we can't feel anything that seems to be 
corroded.

Now is it true that in order to get in there and look around and solve 
this problem, I have to drop the engine?  Can't I just cut a hole in the 
plate under the bed?  I don't want to drop the engine to solve this 
problem but Caron isn't going to go anywhere with me if she can smell 
gas.

Any suggestions of where the leak might be coming from?  They tell me 
that the vent tubes in there feel solid so they don't think that the 
problem is coming from there.  And I don't think Caron will wear a gas 
mask.....
