So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 
&gt; dang it!! i just read the original post that was out of order in my  
&gt; mail and i didn't realize the problem was while it was being driven 
&gt; for an hour or so.
&gt; 
&gt; does your van do this:   ?
&gt; drive for a period, then jerk like crazy as if the engine is cutting 
&gt; in and out.  maybe idles rough or smooth when you stop.  shut down a 
&gt; while, then start up.  may be rough or problem may be gone.  drives 
&gt; fine sometimes.  
&gt; 
&gt; mine DID do the above and it was a dirty air flow meter.  cleaned the 
&gt; contacts and problem was solved.
&gt; 
&gt; or you might be a ghost harness candidate.

Dan, you old dawg you!   ;p
