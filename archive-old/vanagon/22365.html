Subject: Jerry Garcia dead at 53

Reuters:

Jerry Garcia, the lead guitarist of the Grateful Dead, has
died. The Marin County Sheriff's Office says Garcia was found
dead by staff members at the Serenity Knolls drug and alcohol
treatment center in San Francisco. He apparently died of natural
causes. Garcia suffered from diabetes and had been in ill health
for several years. He was 53. Garcia, guitarist Bob Weir, bass
player Phil Lesh and drummer Bill Kreutzman have been with the
band since its founding 25 years ago.

Sorry to confirm this as true.  As a new bus owner, I felt that it
was my obligation to attach a Greatful Dead sticker to my bus.  I
was hoping to see the Dead at Shoreline this October.

Jerry brought happiness to lots of people.  He also designed great
neckware.  The world is a little poorer.
