Subject: Octane Question

     At the risk of sparking a &quot;me too&quot; exchange, I'll ask a question:
     
     Is everyone using the octane rating specified for their Wasserboxer?
     
      (I am, and intend to continue, so please, no well-intended lectures.)
     
     If not, is the potential for detonation a factor in head problems that 
     some are experiencing?
     
     Okay, that's two questions.  Copious apologies in advance if this has 
     been beat to death already.
