&gt; &gt;I have just moved out to DC area, will be living in Bethesda and don't 
&gt; &gt;want a car anymore.  My VW van needs a home where someone can enjoy it as 
&gt; &gt;I have.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The van is as follows: 1974, flat porsche 911 style engine.  No idea how 
&gt; &gt;many miles are on the engine,
&gt; &gt;The odometer has been broken for about two years, it says 105K.   The 
&gt; &gt;engine  has a slight leak in the push rods, oil 
&gt; &gt;leaks when you stop the car, but doesn't leak out under pressure.  The 
&gt; &gt;engine has about 130 psi compression, which is great!, there is cracks in 
&gt; &gt;the front windshild, and 4 dings.  Two new tires on the front, two old 
&gt; &gt;balding on the back.  One spare that will do the job.  The van is a 
&gt; &gt;sliding roof that I have sealed up because it use to leak.  Some work 
&gt; &gt;would make this work again.  The engine has been taken care of, I put 
&gt; &gt;castor oil 20/50 in more than every 5,000 miles.  It has been a great van 
&gt; &gt;for me because I know how it works and can keep it working.  The 
&gt; &gt;iginition needs some help, I tie the wires together to get the starter 
&gt; &gt;to go, kind of my own built in theft protection.  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The van has been in the west its whole life, no rust except for surface 
&gt; &gt;pit marks on the paint.  It will give many years of life to someone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The price should be about $1,200.00 Only serious inquires will be 
&gt; &gt;discussed.   This means do you have the ability to compensate me with 
&gt; &gt;cash for my value?  If not don't bother.  Thanks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;e-mail me if you can, or get someone else to do it for you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Happy trails.
