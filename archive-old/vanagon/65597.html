Subject:      Battery Location(was Re: Aux. Battery Isolator Relay)

Thanks for the help with the relay question. I have one more before I
start. It seems the best place for the two Trojan T105s I have is under t=
he
sink. I am concerned though that the 120 lb. combined weight of the
batteries in that location may affect the ride. Is this something I shoul=
d
avoid or will the suspension handle the load?
