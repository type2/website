     &gt;FWIW, I once considered a turbo Audi transplant into my Quantum
     &gt;Syncro,and at the time, I was under the impression that most of the
     &gt;early Audi turbo units from the 5000 series were in fact air cooled.
     &gt;A VW mechanic friend who owned one heavily modified though for higher
     &gt;boost, ran it 150,000 with no problems, his opinion was that the key
     &gt;to &gt;turbo life was oil and more often overlooked AIR filter changes
     &gt;regularly, like every 25k. He put over 200,000 on the origional turbo
     &gt;I believe with never a rebuild, reseal or anything. On the engine
     &gt;as well BTW.

     Irate Audi owners complained about this inexcusable lack of
     reliability, and in the mid to late '80s Audi put in the water cooled
     turbo. 300K miles is now the going standard  ;-).
