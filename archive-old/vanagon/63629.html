&gt;San Diego Spedo Tach , on India St, will sell the gear. I think I paid

I just called:

Speedo-Tach San Diego Inc 
                1569 1st Ave 
                San Diego, CA 92101-3001 
                619-235-0314

The man I spoke with there knew just what I was talking about before I
really described it and said to send them the old little plastic odometer
gear as a sample and they would send back a new one, for &quot;about 8 bucks&quot;.

I was so surprised I forgot to ask his name, and if that included S&amp;H, but I
doubt it could.  Anyway, there it is.

I don't know them and have no experience or anything with them, so Caveat
Emptor...

86 Scirocco (with a glued gear)
83 GTI (with a staked shaft holding a cracked gear)
