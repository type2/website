Hi All,

You know the hose that connects from a water source to the Westy?  What
kind of connections need to be on it?  Okay, I can easily check the Westy,
but am not near a campsite now.  Is it your typical male connection on one
end, female on the other?  Is there a best type of store to acquire one at?
