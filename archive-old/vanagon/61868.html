Hi,

Watch out!  You may be encountering the famous 'broken synchroniser
ring' that vanagons get.  The 3-4th gear ring gets a crack started that
grows enough to break out a chunk about 1.5&quot; long.  I've got one on a
shelf.  Due to bad design.  Newer rings are better shaped.

Preventative measures are to drain the gear oil out, and put in fresh,
preferably synthetic Redline MTL.  This is supposed to ease shifting
effort although I haven't used it (yet).  VW say trans is lubed for
life, but at 3.5x$4 for fresh oil I change mine every 2 years minimum,
using Castrol HypoyC from WalMart/KMart.  That way I know it's fresh and
FULL! It gets checked often, due to wading with the Syncro. A cheap
filler pump is WELL worth it, unless you like oil down your
trans/arms/drive etc. Getting the 17mm plugs out is fun first time, make
sure you do get the fill plu out FIRST. :) See recent discussion on
this. 

As a pre-rinse you can drain and run on ATF for a few days.  This will
loosen/clean out some crud and deposits.  Perhaps there is a better
commercial 'rinse' available?  (anyone know?)  Check/clean the magnet in
the drain plug for particles/chunks, fuzzy dust size is normal wear. 
Then drain the ATF and go to Castrol for a week, then MTL.  The reason
for the double rinse is that about 1 qt. of fluid won't drain out. Takes
3.5qt to refill.  ATF is spec'd by VW for cold weather applications,
below -10F for extended periods, so no highway/long duration runs on it!
Unless it's damn cold.


OTOH/as well.....  might want to thoroughly degrunge and regrease (with
molybased) ALL the shift linkage from under floor right onto trans. 
This definately gives a 'lighter' feel to the stick and will help you
pick your way into gear with forcing it. Re-adjusting the floor linkage
is a rite of passage for van owners, be patient.

Remember, your van is 13 years old, deserves some TLC and will go
another 10 years with it.  Not many vehicles do as well for longevity.
