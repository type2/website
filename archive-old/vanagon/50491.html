Subject: BA6 Gas Heater in a waterboxer?????

How many of you waterboxers out there have that optional gas heater on your Van 
(most likely Canadian Westy models) ????
I have a BA6 off a aircooled Vanagon, has anyone ever tried to retrofit one of
those to a waterboxer? Yes, I know, first of all there's no central heater tube
that runs the length of the floors, so something would have to be done about the
large holes in each end of the heater.

any ideas??
