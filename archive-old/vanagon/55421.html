&gt; I am having an hydraulic lifter sticking on the 87GL once a month or so.

&gt; turned off hot (read warm) and started warm. The guy I bought it from
&gt; said it did it ocassionally, but did not until lately, and only very
&gt; intermittently. I use synthetic oil w/Prolong and added a little Marvel
&gt; Mystery on the last episode and it did help. Any ideas? Can this lifter
&gt; damage anything while in the &quot;sticky&quot; mode and tapping around. Otherwise
&gt; the Vanagon runs excellent. Any and all ideas and comments appreciated.

   Always get the motor hot when starting. Never run the motor on
   short trips, (less than 1 mile). Change the oil regularly.
