A socket fitted over the wheel nut and then rapped smartly worked on mine.  I
was told this frees the nut from the wheel so a wrench will then do it's job.
All I can say is it worked for me.

&gt;       I had the same problem when I had to remove the rear tires for the 
&gt;       first time in order to do a brake job.  I tried liquid wrench, heat 
&gt;       from a propane torch, and a cross bar lug wrench with 2 foot cheater 
&gt;       bar.  None of that worked.  I posed the same question to the list that 
&gt;       you did.  The concessus was use at least a 5 foot long cheater bar 
&gt;       over a breaker bar and apply even steady pressure.
