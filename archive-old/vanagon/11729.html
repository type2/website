Subject: Air Flow Sensor


Hi Everyone-

Just got the results back from the dealer concerning my van and it's emission
and idle problem.  It seems that the problem is with the air flow sensor.
 The previous owner, or a mechanic got into the sensor and caused some
problems...why they broke into the box I don't know.  The mechanic said that
the computer and idle stabilizer were fine.  Does anyone have a used air flow
box for a 1986 and up Vanagon for sale?, or know where i can get one??  I
figured this would be the best place to ask.  VW wants $450.00 for new one.
ouch 

Thanks
