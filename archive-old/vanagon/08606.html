&gt; I have to differ with you on the Type IV engine.  On my '74 the fan was smack
&gt; dab in the middle attached to the crank shaft.  But then again, I'm not sure
&gt; of the air routing/porting in the fan housing.  That would be the only other
&gt; obstruction flowing difference between cyl. #1 and #3.  
&gt; 
&gt; Am I wrong about this?

Not exactly.  The fan is centered, yes, but the cylinders are staggered.
Think about the crankshaft - the number 3 cylinder connects furthest
towards the front of the motor, and is therefore a few inches farther 
away from the fan than number one.  Also, the oil cooler &quot;uses&quot; some of
the cooling air for the number 3 and 4 cylinders, so I would guess they
run hotter than the right bank.  I wonder if they designed the fan
housing to route a little more air to the left bank to compensate for
that... hmmm... I'll have to check into that, but I bet Dave Kautz
already knows.  :)
