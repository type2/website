&gt;Try renting a steam cleaner.  I just used one on my &quot;new&quot; 83 and it was 
&gt;incredible how much dirt and grease was in those carpets and seats.
&gt;
&gt;

I had been debating that and I think I'm going to go ahead and do it too.  I
have a feeling I'm going to be surprised at the amount that's lifted even
after it has been &quot;cleaned&quot; once
