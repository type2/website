	Ray,
	I am, and feel that's natural for a VW Bus group, but the actual
reference  is to another bunch of Jimi fans, and their wry use of this
marvelous line, after a stream of incomprehinsible gibberish not unlike
that which I posted. I'm refering, of course, to Pink Floyd's &quot;Several
Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving
With a Pict&quot;, from Umaguma. Now don't all rush to your turntables at
once to play it... its just before the end of the track.

	BTW, one thing Jimi was wrong about- you *will* hear surf music
again- if you like psychedelic music, check out The Mermen, the psychedelic
surf jazz band from San Francisco. I think these guys are so cool, I'll
send you a two-song sample from their current CD in trade for your own
favorites or a blank tape.

	Bill
