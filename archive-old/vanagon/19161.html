Subject: RE:Friday Follies....


In regard to the following:

&gt;Oh, there are no Eurovans here in the States,
&gt;They are off on foriegn shores,
&gt;Driven round by high-priced whores...


I wish to take exception to the above quote....

FIRST: My Ex-wife DOES NOT live on foreign shores...

SECOND: She drives a Toyota...

My current wife and I, continue to live in the United States, and
continue to love and drive our EuroVan!

Now that I have made that correction, please continue....

Ric
