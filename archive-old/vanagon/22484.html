Depictus??
by Billie Ernie Hindleg

Under the bus that carries me,
  Black as the grease on CV balls,
I thank whatever gods may be
  For my decrepit overalls.

Smudges from axles, loosely gripped,
  I have not flinched nor cried aloud,
Blood from my knuckles (socket slipped),
  Has colored the surface of this shroud.

Above these spots and greasy smear
  Is streak-ed paints of different shade
And stains of ketchup, mustard, beer ...
  I wear them proudly, unafraid.

It matters not how loud the gripe
  From friends or neighbors, wives, et al ...
I will not wash, though they be ripe,
  These funky stinking overalls.
