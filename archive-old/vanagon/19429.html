&gt; 
&gt; Really from 1968 to 1971 because 1972 and on had a Type IV any way. Actually
&gt; whoever had my '72 Westy took out the original 1700cc and put a universal
&gt; 1600 upright (with alot of sheet metal to fill in the gap) and never even put
&gt; the rear cross member back let alone the rear motor mount and only had the
&gt; two lower studs and one upper bolt holding the motor in!  And I drove it
&gt; around for 5 years (only 14,000 miles) with it like that.  So, what I wonder
&gt; is is it really, REALLY necessary to have that rear mount?  Inquiring minds
&gt; want to know!

&gt; Bradley, I wrote this up before I saw your post :)
&gt; 
&gt; P.P.S.
&gt; Since I have a bubble window that was all I was concerned about!!!  SO THERE,
&gt; NYAH!  NYAHH!!  NYAHHH!!!   ;-)

		Hi Y'all

	I want to inform you about that for instance in Europe you
	always had the choice to choose a 1600 AS engine, right upto may '79,
	So there are quite a few of those on this side of the ocean :)

	

	  Have a nice day :) Brian aka Volx


	'73 Single Cab
