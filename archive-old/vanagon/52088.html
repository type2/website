Subject: diesel head - precombustion chamber steel caps

        Does anyone know where I can purchase those steel precombustion
chamber caps used in the diesel and turbo-diesel heads?

        One of those steel caps came loose in my head and damaged the
piston. This was from a new head from VW Canada which was less than
one year old. Cheap teutonic trash..........: )
