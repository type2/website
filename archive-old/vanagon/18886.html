Subject: In-line Water Filters

	Howdy :
I want to get our sink in proper working condition. While cleaning out our
tank and the copper line which feeds the sink, I found an in-line water
filter, by the make &quot;EverPure&quot;. The old filter was about the size of a 22
oz. vegetable can, constructed of dark blue plastic. Anyone know where I
can find the # of EverPure, or of other such applicable filters? Thanks!

Mick &quot;Quags&quot; Forstag
