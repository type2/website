I have heard that sanding down pads is a no-no...

&gt; 	Its hard to tell, but the way the bus stops, it would almost seem
&gt; like I only have front brakes, because it dives sorta, but I don't know if
&gt; you could get that kinda power from just the front brakes.  By power I mean
&gt; these brakes feel like the brakes in my 911!!!!

Dunno if this means anything, but when I &quot;did&quot; my rear drums recently,
pedal effort went up noticeably.  The rear brakes were so bad before that
I'm sure they weren't doing anything.  Now I'm sure I have more absolute
stopping power, but I have to press harder to get it...
