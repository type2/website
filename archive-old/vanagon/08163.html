Subject: Re: i realy like the people in this list
Date: Wed, 14 Dec 94 18:04:28 CST

&gt;
&gt;if somebody starts a eurovan mailing list, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;i'm afraid that there is too much traffic on this list for me.
&gt;
&gt;it's NOT a boreing list, in fact i am enjoying reading the messages here.
&gt;
&gt;it's just that it takes more time than i realy feel comfortable spending 
&gt;to read all the messages. 
&gt;
&gt;and being as how i realy hate to just delete a few hundred messages
&gt;without reading them (mainly because they all [or almost all] seem to be
&gt;writen by quite interesting and inteligent people) i will just turn my
&gt;access to the group off. 
&gt;
&gt;so reluctantly, i withdraw from this mailing list. i have found it to be 
&gt;very informative, and the best thing i liked about it is that the people 
&gt;here are fun.
&gt;
&gt;joel, your doing a great job. thanks for the microfiche.
&gt;
&gt;youre all great people here and i have realy loved the chit,chat atmosphere.
&gt;
&gt;some people might say that the reason that there is too much traffic is 
&gt;the chatiness of everyone and the tendancy to stray from strict &quot;VW ONLY&quot; 
&gt;messages, but i would say that the rambling &quot;coffee clutch&quot; feeling of 
&gt;this group is one of the things i like best about it.
&gt;
&gt;i have looked forward to each time that i have had time to sit and read 
&gt;the contributions that people have to make to this fine conversation that 
&gt;we have going here.
&gt;
&gt;and now, only because i fell respect for the people here, and because i 
&gt;care what you think of me, i will offer a short explination of why i am 
&gt;in a situation where i don't have time for this group.
&gt;
&gt;my wife has malignant melanoma, and this will be her last new years 
&gt;celebration.
&gt;
&gt;she will soon begin an experimental type of chemothrapy, only 3 people 
&gt;have been treated in this way before. it seems that there is an %80 
&gt;chance that because of the drugs involved she will be very very ill for the 
&gt;remainder of the time she has left without any real benifit being gained 
&gt;through the use of the drugs, other than the fact that medical 
&gt;information will be gathered that may help treat others in the future.
&gt;
&gt;in any case, she will be very ill and i will be careing for her.
&gt;
&gt;th treatments will not begin till after the new year, so she will be in 
&gt;good health till then. so this time is very valuable to us.
&gt;
&gt;it may seem a little morbid to say this, but we are trying to keep out 
&gt;humor about us, but by this time next year i may have alot of free time 
&gt;on my hands and can rejoin the group here, if you'll have me.
&gt;
&gt;ray

Ray,

I was going to reply to you personally, but I thought that a public
post was better.  I wish you and your wife all the best in these trying
times, and I do hope that this new experimental treatment works.
I don't want to use that trite expression &quot;I know what you're going
through&quot;, but I think you'll find a lot of empathy in our
(not-so-)little group.

About the van-list, I know I lurk more than I contribute, and even then
I don't always read every message (time!), but I always enjoy 'opening'
my mailbox first thing in the morning and looking forward to sharing that
feeling of camaraderie that exists in our group.  My only regret is
that I won't be able to take part in the Grand Tour of the West (TM)
coming up.
