Subject: f/ re: Bike Rack Suggestion...



To All:

Has anyone tried lashing their bikes together and towing the things?

Howzabout putting the kids on them and towing them behind on a rope?

When you consider the consequences of drilling a hole in your van to mount a
bike rack versus losing an occasional kid, I think you'll see the value of
towing the things.

In a more practical vein, both front and rear bumbers offer excellent support
points for extensions that could carry three or more bikes.  Indeed, if you
used BOTH front and rear bumpers, plus the vertical mounts, along with five
or six clapped on the roof, you should be able to haul about twenty bikes,
mebbe more.

But I still like the towing idea... whole string of them back there, like
dorys behind a cod boat. Play Crack the Whip on those sharp mountain roads,
see Tail-End Charlie flying off cross-country...
