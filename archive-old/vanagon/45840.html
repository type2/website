Subject: spider web &amp; stove

I had a wonderful time at Elizabeth Furnace- with the exception of almost
blowing up the van, me, &amp; the campground.  Until yesterday I was pretty
unsettled, but a LOCAL propane guy immediately diagnosed &amp; cleaned the
impressive spider web from the tube behind the stove knob.  I'm now off to
buy some pipe cleaners to keep on hand- apparently the yellow flame indicated
air obstruction in the pipe, &amp; spiders love to make webs over the winter.  My
excitement is back-    8-&gt;
