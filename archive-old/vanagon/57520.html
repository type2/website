Date: Sun, 23 Mar 1997 14:49:34 -0000

Ok, Ive had enough with the bently and my local VW shop has never done =
it and the VW dealership in Everett Wa wants my first born son AND =
promisory note for my life savings for 1 little thing..... Changing the =
fresh air fan motor in my 1984 Vangon weekender.  My Bently doesnt have =
a lot to say on the matter and what it does confuses me!  I see how the =
control unit comes off really well,but I dont see how to remove the =
heater core and blower unit.  All I can see is the 4 or 5 basic bolts &amp; =
the water hoses.  Can it be that easy?? I worked for a GM dealer ship a =
few years back and learned that if it seems that easy your missing =
someting REALLY BIG!  Has anybody ventured into this area and can =
provide any information? =20
Thanks Ronald McDonald
