you'll notice that the 85's have pulled into the lead once again, and
the 71's are losing out to even the 87's. come on, guys and gals!! get
out there and rustle those bushes!!

all you Unknowns ought to be ashamed! letting your poor defenseless
brethren (?) down like that. why, there are more Unknowns than Split-
Windows! :)

and meanwhile, way over in the corner, thinking that we don't notice
them, the Eurovans have increased 40 percent in the last week. planning
a coupe', boys? ;)
