&gt;&gt; red rug for you-alls -- ahhh what's the plural of you-all, anyway?
&gt;I was in Texas recently.  The plural is all you all.  Really.

you guys. where have you been all these years?

Y'all  is singular. meaning 'you'.
                    however, it can be used to refer to a small group,
                    such as two or three people. can also be used to
                    refer to anyone in the general hearing vacinity, as in:
                    &quot;Any o' Y'all know how to git to Bubba's??&quot;

All Y'all  is plural.   meaning 'all of you'.
                    usually meant to refer to large groups of people ...
                    rioting mobs, theatre-goers, and beer-bellied gin joint
                    patrons. generally pronouced as 'Ahlllllll Yawl'.
