&gt;Gregg your reply:
&gt;
&gt; The whir is a weak attempt at the engine turning over.  Te bendix engages
&gt;&gt;and the starter turns the engine, but it turns as if the battery was almost
&gt;&gt;dead.  Starter and solenoid are usually replaced together as I did in this
&gt;&gt;case.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Well if your starter is engaged, then the secondary electrical componets,
&gt;ingition switch, solenoid and the intial relay function of connecting the
&gt;starter and the battery are doing their job. The primary components, the
&gt;starter motor and the battery are where the problems are.  This primary
&gt;electrical circuit depends on the ground strap, etc and a starter relay to
&gt;transfer the battery power to the starter motor. It sounds like the
&gt;current flow is being reduce by either a poor ground or other mechanical
&gt;connection, or the relay is not passing the battery power on to the
&gt;starter cable. Since I can't visably see your system, you'll want to
&gt;inspect this primary electrical circuit.
&gt;
&gt;Since heat is involved, my priorty would be componets closer to the engine
&gt;or that are warm.  Guessing the starter relay first. Two contacts have to
&gt;pass the current from the battery to the starter. Two larger wire
&gt;connections and then one or two smaller wires from the ingition switch or
&gt;relay.  I would then mover to perhaps the ground strap connection beneath
&gt;the strap and next to the frame and the other end the motor.  I've seen
&gt;this one vibrate lose on my car.  Ditti at the battery post.
&gt;
&gt;It's a good Idea to cover the complete primary system, since were talking
&gt;about a need to pass 400 plus amps, and ensure all of the cables etc are
&gt;properly attached, I feel you've covered this but am mentioning it any
&gt;way.
&gt;
&gt;Seems I read a recent note that decscribe wires that were bent, and thus
&gt;resistance was high, creating a hot spot in the wiring harness, that
&gt;affected the starting of the vehilce. This may of been directed to you, I
&gt;don't know list members well enough to remember who said what to whom.
&gt;
&gt;On the bizzare side, and I've seen bizarre, an engine accsessory that was
&gt;&quot;draging&quot; cause the &quot;fluke&quot;.  So if your still stumped, and the primary
&gt;seems solid, you could look at the startee, the motor. There are a couple
&gt;of ways to go here.  You could poke around with turning the motor over
&gt;with a breaker bar etc to see if the sucker is difficult to turn, since
&gt;having a 400 amp load meter may be impracticle. By this I mean you could
&gt;have shunt, I've got one, that hooks to an engine analyzer, to see if the
&gt;primary system is pushing 400 amps into the starter. Repairs shops I've
&gt;been in do this.  We can quickly isolate whether or not the start system
&gt;or the motor is the troubled child. You could call a shop ahead, and
&gt;describe this ask for a cost to have them do it, takes just a minute to
&gt;hook up the little box to the battery. Then git er hot and head that way.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;After rereading this note, time wise I think I'd call the repair shop
&gt;first, since its a quickee, gas stations are good at this. Don't let em
&gt;work on it of course, just call around until you locate someone who can do
&gt;it when you drive up. You should be in and out in 10 or so minutes. Then
&gt;you can move onto the other items I mentioned.
