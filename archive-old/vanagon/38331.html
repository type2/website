Subject: Re: Siezed pancake on table

My friend has a '73 motor on which he's doing a quick rebuild. (new rings 
only). After putting the heads back on, he has determined that the engine 
will turn counter-clockwise, but not clockwise. What could be wrong?

oughta at least put on new rod bearings too..

It's probably stuck on the didtributor drive shaft
