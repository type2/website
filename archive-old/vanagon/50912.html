Actually this was me, and Transform certainly can not weld
the pits, as these are surfaced hardened.  Their rebuilds
are German rebuilt, excellent quality, about $40 each.
I talked to the guy and he said that they in fact rebuild
only from unworn races and new balls and cages.  I find this
amazing in fact as I've never seen a not severly worn race
after 50k miles or so.  I would more likely imagine their supplier
overgrinds the races and uses oversized balls, rehardening the
parts after grinding.  They are coated as well with some sort
of surface coating, and I have a 4 with over 50k on the
rebuilds from a few years back.  I've ordered like 12 from them in
the last 5 years, but to tell the truth am not sure Transform still
exists, the last I ordered were early this year and I have not
seen them in the mags recently.  Anyone know if they are out there?
They also sell the excellent Swepco grease for like $10 a tube,
noticeably stickier than regular moly or even VW moly CV stuff.
If they are still out there I recommend their rebuilt CV's to anyone
for budget minded repair.

Of course 2 of my vans are running day in day out on terribly
pitted but reversed joints.  Haven't failed them yet and all
looked much worse than any Bentley manual &quot;BAD&quot; picture over 10k
miles ago.  But I am prepared to deal with one if it goes at
nearly any time.
