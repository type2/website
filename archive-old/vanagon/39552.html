Subject:  81 rebuild - thanks for help

thanks to everyone who took the time to give suggestions/sympathy for
my molehill-crisis (bob, b. kennedy, jim, paul, and steve m., who didn't
even suggest a v6!). since buying rebuilt heads, pistons/cylinders and
having mine rebuilt would cost an estimated $1800-$2000,  i have
narrowed the options to two: a factory rebuilt from ATK, based on good
feedback from jim, who has installed a few w/no problems ($2400
installed, 70,000 mile lifespan (conservatively), $.03/mile) vs. brothers
motor pulled one month ago (30,000 on rebuild, $600 for shipping and
installation, 30,000 mile lifespan, $.02/mile). all prices include already
having had mine torn down and checked out.  all scenarios require, in
addition, new motor mounts, engine seal (good source?).  it would be
nice to be able to do the swap myself, but i haven't the facilities to do so,
and it's already 175 miles away at the shop since i thought i was having
it rebuilt.  

i am most grateful for this community.
