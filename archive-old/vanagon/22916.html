Subject: Paint and Paint Remover Questions

I'm getting close to repainting the bus and I'd like to put a good quality
paint on it (something I can wax); possibly the original light blue of the
bus.  Where/how/what brand should I get? Do I need to do color matching? 

Also, I've been blasting off rust an primering with a spray-can primer 
(temporary measure, knowing full well that I'll be water sanding those 
blasted spots to smooth the surface). What should I use for primer after 
I smooth out the paint? Should I primer over the whole vehicle or just 
the spots that I've sanded? Should I leave you volks alone with these 
basic questions and just go buy a book? (Not wanting to be a pest, but 
I've trust your advise.)

Also, my top has been painted with a white paint that I'd like to remove. 
I did a test shot with a sandblaster yesterday and found that it'd remove
the paint without hurting the fiberglass. I'm wondering if there's some
compound I could use to get assistance...a degreaser/paint remover...for
the sandblasting. It would have to NOT eat holes in my skin or cause
fires. I'm thinking that &lt;maybe&gt; there's something I could wipe on, let
sit, and then blast off with sand. Am I a fool? ...or just asking a
foolish question? Call it like you see it. 

FYI: I've never painted anything with a paint gun. I know it won't be a 
professional job, but it'll be far better than what's on there now and I 
can't afford a professional job. I'm hoping to make the bus better, but 
not perfect. I'll be painting outside and praying for dry, but not dusty 
conditions. Some parts, I may be painting inside.
