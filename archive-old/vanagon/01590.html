Subject: Inaugural bus trip to Baja for rookie - questions

Well, I'm determined to take my new '60 bus 175 miles
south of the border for 5 days later this month.  My
Honda Accord (haakk, wheeezz, baaarrff!) would probably be
a more reliable vehicle, but, screw it, I didn't buy this
bus to have it drip oil on my garage floor for nothing.

She seems to be doing fine on weekend 150 mile round trippers
to San Onofre, so why should Mexico be any different, right?
 &lt;insert responses here, please&gt;

I'm looking for some advice from the veterans out there concerning:
 a) Gasoline differences, should I bring lead and/or octane boost?
     Should I try to get all gas through PEMEX in Ensenada, avoiding
      ma and pa stations in the middle of nowhere?  Should I bring
      my own gas?  Am I worrying too much?
  b) Washboard dirt roads jarring something loose.  What should I
     check/tighten before I depart?  My coil fell off the doghouse
     last week.
  c) Extreme heat.  Driving tips to keep the oil as cool as possible?
     What about the killer 4 mile uphiller before San Miguel?
  d) Border insurance.  Is it worth it?  What's the typical price/day?
  e) I'm bringing tons of surf gear, long/short boards, coolers, water
     tent, sleeping bags, chairs, so how much extra bus care (oil) stuff
     do I really need?  What are some crucial 'don't go without' items?
  f) I'm told VWs are very prevalent in Mex. so if something BAD happens
     it should be reasonable easy to find a knowledgable mechanic, correct?

Anyways, enough for now.  Much mahalo for any responses.
I'll post my mild (hopefully) adventure when I return (if ever, surf could
be epic).
