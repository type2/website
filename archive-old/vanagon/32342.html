Like many others, while restoring my '56 sedan I would myself 
returning to the same VW dealer. Their support was amazing. One 
day the boss came over to the parts counter and said that I could 
have a 15% discount on all spares, any time. Pushing my luck, I 
asked why. His reply was that VAG couldn't buy the kind of 
advertising an old restored vehicle represented. In the end they 
were even loaning me strange tools with strange numbers. 

Isn't is strange/ironic/sad that all the stories about good
service from VW comes from Europe? [sigh for VWoA]

BTW....was it &quot;our&quot; Bob Hoover that Paul Harvey mentioned
this morning was going back to Oshkosh?
