&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;   My steering is becoming an obsession! I replaced the drag link this

&gt;removing tie rod ends and stuff. It really works great!  Anybody know
&gt;how to rebuild the steering box?

No, but I know you can get a rebuilt one for around $250. That's why I
haven't done it yet. I don't mind steering all the time. Really, I don't.
