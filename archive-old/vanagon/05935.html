&gt;What creative contraptions have people made to put screens in the
&gt;sliding windows in the mid-sections of Vanagons?  Is there someplace
&gt;that makes nice-fitting removable screens?  I had used Velcro to
&gt;affix some nylon screen mesh to my last Vanagon, but wasn't very happy
&gt;with it.

you might give these folks a ring. when i got their brochure about vanagon
conversion campers, they had some neat looking screens that they made up
(not vw-made). i didn't pursue it, however, so i don't know if they still
have any.
