So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean that the more knobs, plug in devices, light fixtures
&gt; monitors, gauges, trim we have on our busses the more control oriented we
&gt; are? Personally, I prefer to keep the interior stock while adding only
&gt; those items that will help me know how the engine is performing;does this
&gt; mean that I seek an underlying order to all things cosmic, and am
&gt; inherently conservative; and what about the guy who puts in things like
&gt; fuel consumption monitors, 80 watt speakers, chrome trim etc; or the
&gt; person who redecorates the interior in flannel :) ? 
&gt; 

I don't mind the 'extras' as long as it was came as standard or option for
that year of the vehicle.  I don't like tacky add-ons e.g. even cup holders
look annoying if not mounted right, Thing hanging from the rear-view mirror
etc.  It's just my style.  Low-profile and no-nonsense.  Just my taste, no
one elses.
