Subject: RE: Good rubber

I agree that the Conti's, 185SR14s, are terrible on any wet pavement
especially when it's icy.  It's also not so good on loose pavement.  The
rear of my 88 Vanagon GL just starts fish-tailing as soon as it looses
traction.  I tried the Sears TreadLocks, 185TR14s, but they just wore out
real fast even tho the traction was better.
 
I've had Goodyear Aquatreads, P205-70R14's, for over a year now and they are
great especially on wet pavement.  If I loose traction, the rear just tracks
straight.  With the especially bad winter we had here the past year, I was
more than satisfied with the way the Goodyear Aquatreads handle especially
in deep (&gt;3&quot;) snow.  To top things off, they ride nice and relativly quiet.
I think the larger size, 205 vs 185, and the &quot;P&quot; raiting makes the
difference.  However, even on sale, they're still expensive...Joey
