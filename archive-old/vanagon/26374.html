&gt;&gt;In the modern era, those C-rats are referred to officially as MRE's, for
&gt;&gt;&quot;Meal, Ready to Eat&quot;.
&gt;&gt;Among the people who actually have to eat them (I had the pleasure more
&gt;&gt;than once in Thule, Greenland), this is called &quot;Three lies for the price
&gt;&gt;of one&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;yeah. and you don't even get the John Wayne Toilet Paper or the John Wayne
&gt;Candy Bar anymore. :)  or the cigarettes you could trade for Fruit Cocktail!

And you can't even heat MREs in a fire like C-Rats.  And since helments are
made out of kevlar instead of steel, no more &quot;stews&quot;.  For the unintitiated,
this &quot;stew&quot; was when everyone would put the &quot;entree&quot; (sounds better the main
can) in a helment and add heat and a lot of tobasco.  Not the best in the
world but better than &quot;pork, chopped and formed&quot; by itself.

You still get the toilet paper, but the candy isn't the &quot;sh*t disks&quot; any
more.

C-Rats kept for a LONG time, too.  When I was in USMC boot camp in 1974 some
of ours were made in 1943!  Some with chicken noodle soup!  Still have my P38
from boot camp, and it still works great.  (It's a can opener.)
