&gt; Sorry, I don't have any better hypothesis than you. Can't think of anything

&gt; is small enough the deposits tend to clog the hole, and slow it down.

&gt; corrosion and gasket faliures set in though, so it's good to get it fixed.
&gt; Is the pitting only in the combustion chambers? VW doesn't recommend
&gt; resurfacing
&gt; the diesel head (because of the prechamber inserts of different material),
&gt; but some shops claim they can do it anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; A better source for advice is Jack Ewald. I'm not sure if he's still on the
&gt; net,
&gt; (last heard from him several months ago), but you can try:

&gt;     vwdiesel_at_jackewald.win_dot_net
&gt; 
&gt; And of course, a post to the vw newsgroup reaches a bigger audience of
&gt; diesel owners. Please keep us posted about what you find out.

Thanks! It fired up last night &amp; sounder much smoother - after full 
warm up, idle seemed about 100-150 rpm higher (on the tach) which is 
a good sign. (my neighbors just *love* the sound of a diesel at high 
idle at 11:30pm... ;) I used an oil flush during the initial warm up -
and will do a coolant flush tonight before test driving, since the 
rad is still original &amp; probably has a bit of oil sludge in it.
'twas a beautiful sound to here it running after 4 nights of working 
in the heat (still 22c at 11:00pm last night...)
