&gt;--Christopher Bridge said:--
&gt;&gt; My 71 has a aftermarket hitch, but I don't think its rated for what you wany 
&gt;&gt; to pull.  Mine says gross weight 1100 lbs and 110 lbs tounge weight.  It is 
&gt;&gt; mounted to the frame on each side, with a big peice of angle between.  The 
&gt;&gt; tounge bolts to the botton of the stock bumper.
&gt;
&gt;Mine appears to be stock or approved accessory (has VW stamped in
&gt;the tounge). Same rating as above, but the tounge is welded to
&gt;the rear brace in the engine compartment.

Serious? attaches to the rear brace?  Doesn't the rear brace move around on 
the motor mount to each side?  Mine doesn't have VW stamped on it. double :-(
I think that the ratings are called &quot;class I.&quot;  I think the original poster 
wants something like class III.
