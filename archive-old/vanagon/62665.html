Hello Everyone,

Just got a letter in response to an email inquiry I sent from the German VW 
Website about when we might see the new EV over here.

They &quot;regret that this model has still not been introduced on the US-market 
due to various reasons.&quot; (Which they don't go into.)

The letter continues on, directing me to contact VoA for further info 
since, &quot;The introduction of new models is planned by the respective 
importer or subsidiary.&quot; Hello, VoA?....
