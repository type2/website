Subject: Epilogue: Bent My Bumper

Jay:

 The new front bumper to my '86 GL arrived safely yesterday.  Not a scratch or
dent anywhere - must have taken you quite a while to wrap it up so well!

 Many thanks for your help and thanks also to everyone on the list who
responded to my bent bumper situation.  My wife commented &quot;you know, I don't
think you've ever gotten burned on any of your Internet deals - you send
checks to people and they send the parts.&quot;  Strange but true, the transactions
also send a rare good message.
