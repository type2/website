&gt;The glow plug light on my '82 Diesel Westy (35K) comes on to show that it works

        There is a Temperature sender in the engine (I think that it is on
the head) that goes to the glow plug control relay.  Where on the west coast
are you? it may just not be cold enough for it to stay on for long.  Does
the van start OK?

        My light didn't stay on for long above 50F back when I had a
controll relay(that was before the fire).

        BTW check and wake sure that there is no way for the cold start
cable to contact the glow plug fuseable link.  If there is, move stuff
around untill there isn't.  From the cable side of the fuseable link it is a
stright shot to the battery.
