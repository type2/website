&gt; Volks,
&gt; Having dealt with the dilemma of trying to cool the air in my 82 diesel
&gt; Westy for some years now in Baja Calif, I've come up with this:
&gt; I use a Toyotomi 4000btu portable air-conditioner inside the van. It's the
&gt; most efficient, small A/C unit I've found.
&gt; That coupled with a Honda EX 650 mounted outside on either the front or
&gt; rear bumper. It uses .5gal of gas every 4 hrs. Is so quiet no one notices
&gt; it's on.
&gt; 
&gt; With this setup, my 1.6L diesel isn't over taxed ( more overtaxed, I should
&gt; say) and I've got air whenever I need it.
&gt; 
&gt; Works for me.
