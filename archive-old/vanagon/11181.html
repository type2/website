Subject: Re: (f) Question about a Thing Transaxle


If you are going to do anything with the transaxle with your Thing,
remember that the final drive ratio is different between a bug
transaxle and the 181s transaxle. Any bug trans from 1969 through
1974 will fit, providing you change the cv joint carrier on the 
transaxle.  But, again, you will find that the gearing is different.
