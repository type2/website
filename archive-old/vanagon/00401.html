This is actually about two totally different things.

First a request to please, please, please trim your mail as
much as you can.  At 2400 baud, its, um, a bit trying??

And two.

I got my bus back on the road and wanted to thank everyone who has
given me advice. After the following work, it has some seepage on
the rear( flywheel) seal :(, but its not super bad yet.

Replaced station wagon seats with folddown from Westphlalia
Regreased front wheel bearings
Regreased CV joints and replaced a boot
Replaced Wheel Cylinders
New Brake Shoes
Turn Drums
Replace all crappy black antennae mounts and locks lathces
with chrome off a '74
Removed vinyl from masonite and replaced with black short pile carpet
Restained wooden back of seat
All new gaskets and front and rear engine seals
New Valve screws
New rings
New rod bearings
Rotor and distributor cap
New Bossh 
Spark plug wires, adjust valves and dwell
Acid bath soak engine tin and repaint them
Radio and amp

My brother and I did all this over the past 2 months on the weekends.
The engine runs like a top, but leaks a very little bit from the tranny/
engine junction.  Its not nearly as severe as the quart/80 miles it
was doing before I rebuilt it.

I have no rear brakes, and need to figure out what the hell is wrong with
that. Also, I think I might haver some worn front end parts, but its drivable.

I have about 300 in parts for the above.  Any ideas on what labor would
have been for everything?? We probably spent over 100 hours on it, but
its the first van I have ever seen that the sliding door shuts :)

Sorry about the length, esp about bitching about trimming, but I just wanted
everyone to know what happens when people get too involved with something
and go crazy.
