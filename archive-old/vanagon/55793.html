Subject: Re: Wiring on power steering pump


&gt;  
&gt; While poking around at the engine on my '89 Westy I noticed a sort of 
&gt; plug at the back of the power steering pump. The naked prongs of the plug 
&gt; definitely looked as if something was supposed to be hooked up to them 
&gt; and sure enough on closer inspection I found two dangling wires.
&gt;  
&gt; One wire was red and white and the other was sort of white or yellowish. 
&gt; Does anybody know which wire goes on top and bottom or does it matter ? 
&gt; Also what function does this connection serve ? I've had no trouble with 
&gt; the steering.

It's the PS pressure switch, which is connected to the idle 
stabilizer. To help prevent stalling when steering at low speeds for 
parking, I guess. On mine, the White/Yellow is on driver's side, 
Red&amp;White, pass. side, although I don't think matters much, since it 
just an on/off switch thing.

Bentley shows (page 97.125) both wires coming from the Idle 
Stabilizer Control Unit, which I think is in the pass side area where 
the aiur intake is, right? But it gives no obvious way to tell the 
connectors on the switch end apart, so I assume it doesn't matter.
