Subject: Re[2] Steven's wiper arms

A couple of thoughts on this matter:

If I recall correctly, you have a '91 T3, so unless you've been abusing
the arms, it's probably in OK shape.  I read somewhere on the Porschephiles
list that you can check your blades when you get home at the end of the
day and press the blade edge against the glass in the opposite direction
that it's starting to get a bias towards, so that it has all night to try
and &quot;straighten out&quot;

Since you're going to be wandering around &quot;recycling&quot; yards in RC (are
you breathing through a snorkel yet?) searching for that hi-beam lens,
you might want to be on the lookout for a LH arm off a GTI/GLI/? be-
cause they have the built in deflector on the arm to increase the down-
force against the windshield.  I'm not saying that the arm(s) will fit
interchangeably on the shaft, but if they do, it might be worth a shot.

It's pretty important to clean off the rubber wiper crud that ends up
binding to your windshield, causing the dreaded skipping wiper syndrome;
a good cleaner should do the trick

Lastly, there are those triple-edged wiper blades...  Now, I ain't never
tried those things, but if someone has (and is willing to admit it)...
enquiring minds want to know if they work... (I don't think they're the
ones that Alistair mentioned, the Tridon Aerofoils).

Good luck!
