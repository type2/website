David Schwarze says:
&gt;See you there.  Bring something cool to burn.  

This reminds me that on the day I joined this list everybody was talking
about burning magnesium.  I missed out on how all of that got started.  Can
someone fill me in?  Burning magnesium is most excellent and I'd like to know
what you guys were all talking about.
Thanks
