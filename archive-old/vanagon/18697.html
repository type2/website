Subject: Heat and Necessity

    Ramona's heater boxes are all rotted out. I could replace them when I
overhaul the engine, but do I really HAVE to?? Does it affect her cooling
system at all to be sans-heat? Will I really need it when I'm driving
cross-country in August?? Yes? No? Hmm.
   What's the approx. added expense to replacing the boxes on a '71? Any
opinions are, again, welcome. Thanks.
Rach
