Subject: Re: Is owning a van probable cause?

&gt;Since I'm not the original owner (it is only 4 months younger than me),
&gt;should I worry about someone's stach hidden in the seat cushin or
&gt;something? 
&gt;Or is it stupid to worry about that since I don't use drugs?

YES.

The only time I have ever been harrassed was when I was in a very
shady area (crack dealers all around).  I was lost and nervous.
He CLAIMED I had run a stop sign (I hadn't) but let me go when he
saw I wasn't drunk or stoned.  I was actually glad he stopped me
so I could get directions back to civilization.
