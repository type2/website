Subject: silly (vw) observation

Am I the only one that has noticed david BLACK and mike WHITE on the VW
list? Do we have any Grey, Brown, Green, or textures like Tweed? Sorry to
take the band width with a post like this but hey, my productivity stats
were just too good and I my mind was all tired out from thinking of
important posts like camping toys and showers.
