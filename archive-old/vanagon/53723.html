Subject: CV joint lifespan?
Date: Sat, 4 Jan 1997 02:40:57 -0000

I am getting a click-click from the rear axle as I turn right. The service
record indicates a new off-side inner CV joint 16k miles ago, prior to that
both were replaced 60k miles ago.

1. How long would you expect a CV joint (inner) to last?
2. Should the PO have replaced both sides together?
