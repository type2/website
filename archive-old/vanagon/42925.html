And David M. thus said:

&gt;Hi, I have a 93 Eurovan with an intermitent electrical problem. It 
&gt;seems that occasionally the fuel level and temperature gauge stop 
&gt;responding and then start working again after a while.

Yes!  I'm there right now!...  Although I have yet to get the inaccurate
reading on the fuel level, I do get the on-or-off syndrome on the temp
and fuel gauges.  It used to bother me (this has been going on for a week
or so, now), but I find that I can usually jump start these insolent gauges
by turning on the turn indicator switch...hey, don't look at me...I didn't
design this thing, I just drive it...   ;-)

Heh, w/ my luck, the wiring harness in the dash'll ignite and I can
write in about Balls O' Fire, PtII.....   =:-O
