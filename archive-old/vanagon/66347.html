Hi Volks,

I changed my spark plug cables on my 87 Vanagon, since then,it runs a bit
strange, does anyone
know what the correct firing order is and how are the cylinders numbered. I
think I connected
them incorrectly.

??????               4   |------[_______]-------|1    ??????
??????               2   |------[_______]-------|3   ???????

Any suggestions welcome.

Best Regards!

Ralf
