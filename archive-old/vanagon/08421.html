&gt;think it was water!) under it that smelled to high heaven!  I wiped it up

&gt;What do you think would work best?

check with a clinic/hospital or a vet ... i seem to recall they have something
that is supposed to get smells like that up. but also it might be clinging to
the rubber mat (not just the metal floor).

also check in the auto stores for stuff to clean seats (specifically, to get
out baby 'accidents').
