I also needed to add some gauges to my van; oil pressure, cylinder head
temperature, and voltmeter.  After tossing around some ideas, I decided
to buy a 'trio' gauge set.  I made a sheet metal cover, formed to the
trio panel, and tapered back to fit the cut-out for the ash tray.  I
know the ash tray is handy for change and misc screws and head rest
clips, but knowing what is happening in the remote rear quarters is more
important.  I painted the sheet metal brown to match the dash, and wired
the lights to the dash lights.  It works great except that I bought
Equius gauges which are junk.  I hope to replace them soon with VDO
gauges that actually might reflect what is going on, instead of their
'reality distortion field'.
