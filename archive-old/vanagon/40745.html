Subject: 69 camper???


I'm looking into buying a 69 camper, $1000 with some rust, rebuilt 
engine, 8K miles, new manual tranny, new cv joints, new boots, new dual 
carbs, semi-new tires, poptop, fold-down bed. I think it only needs the 
carbs and brakes ajusted to pass inspection. How good or bad is this deal 
and what should I look out for on this year of vws in general? Any help, 
advise, opinions, stores, ect will be appriciated, Thanks.
