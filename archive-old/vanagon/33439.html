Subject: RE: Spelling


&gt;Ok, I know this is going to seem pretty anal, but &quot;Westfalia&quot;
&gt;is spelled with a f, not a ph.  I seem to be seeing a lot of &quot;Westphalia&quot;
&gt;written on this list.  I know it isn't a big deal, but we should at
&gt;least be spelling the name of our vehicles correctly.
&gt;
&gt;That's it, feel free to comment on this if I'm being too
&gt;obsessive/compulsive.

Not at all. Our long-suffering Volkswagons deserve respect.
