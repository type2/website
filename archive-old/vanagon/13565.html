I second the support for GEX; have had one for 1 year and 10,000 miles no
problems so far and they have a decent warranty. If you like do it
yourself projects this is the way to go. At one time we toyed with
the idea of putting a water-cooled engine in and were quoted a price of
2000 US. I wonder if you could request a post 85 engine as a way of
avoiding the potential problems with the early wasserboxers? DC
