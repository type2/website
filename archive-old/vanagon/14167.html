Subject: inverted clay pot Q


Ok, at Red Rock, I TRIED to stay warm using Dave &quot;Seriously-Blitzed&quot;
Schwarze's idea of the inverted clay pot over the propane stove.  I
dutifully cracked the window in the hopes of waking up alive.  Not
yet sure about the brain damage, but at least I'm still breathing.

Anyway! - when we once discussed this on here before, there was 
general concern (beyond the ones of asphyxiating, and CO poisoning)
about these pots exploding.  While taking a break from working
on my new-improved-shower system, I suddenly had a thought:  why
not use an inverted cast iron pot, perhaps enameled?  Wouldn't this
be better at trapping and holding the heat, and solve at least
the explosion/safety issue?  If so, should it have a hold drilled
in it like there is at the bottom of a terra cotta clay pot?
