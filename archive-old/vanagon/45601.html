Subject: Gas in Diesel

&gt;        Due to a mis-communication (ya, right.  He didn't listen to me when
&gt;I said Diesel.  He also didn't read the Diesel Fuel Only sticker)my '82
&gt;Diesel got filled (he added apx 6 gal.) with un-leaded gasoline.
&lt;snip&gt;

       Owning a service station in Oregon, I am afraid that gas in diesel
is a fact of life.  We all make mistakes.  The proceduure followed in your
case is what we usually do when it happens.  The only things that I would
add are:

1. When draining the tank, light air pressure applied to the fuel filler
speeds the process. (We use a regulated 15 psi.)

2. Following the draining of the tank, we add approx 5 gal. of diesel and
drain it also.

3. Finally, we fill the customer's tank at no charge.

If the error is discovered prior to the vehicle being started, there is no
need to change filters or bleed the fuel lines.  If the vehicle has been
run with gas in it, then the procedure becomes a little more complex.
