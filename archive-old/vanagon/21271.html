Hi Everyone.  Earlier this week I was at my VW dealer getting a 
120,000 km service on my '90 Westy, and there was a fairly new 1995 
Eurovan Winnebago in for repairs.  

This vehicle was from Alberta (loaded with camping gear), and was in 
for Winnebago faulty electricals.   All the interior lights were 
removed with pieces here and there.  I guess parts were on order.  

With my Syncro Westy parked next to it, one sure notices the 
difference in ground clearance.  The Winnebago was on the long 
wheelbase, and it was LOW to the ground.  I compared the height of 
the propane tanks to the ground, and I had a good 4 or 5 inches extra 
height.  The Winnie's propane tank is alarmingly low IMHO with the 
stretch wheelbase, and it is in the centre of the van to boot making 
things worse.  I know that I wouldn't have any trouble grounding out 
that propane tank.

I also saw a Eurovan GL loaded with seats (9 pass??) with 2 sliding 
doors, and split rear doors.  The rear doors each had a rear wiper.  

Harry.
