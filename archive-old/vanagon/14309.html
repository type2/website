bunch o'questions:  

first, my' 73 keeps eating clutch cables.  it picks a
different way every time though.  once it snapped near the clutch lever.
once it snapped at the front.  yesterday th metal thing you shove the pin
through shattered. why? why? why?  this is getting to be a pain in the
_at_#$.  [i do have the change time down to under five minutes though]

next: joel tells me _not_ to static time my bus.  muir says _only_ static
time it.  now joel isn't muir, but he seems to know what he's talking
about most of the time.  what should i do?  i understand how to static
time my car; should it be done?

yep, there's more: she's pulling to the right a lot these days. how does
one fix that? i'm sick of driving off the road everytime i try to shift
and smoke my cigarette at the same time. [quitting smoking isn't the
remedy i'm looking for]

rear latch: its locken, closed, broken, and i cannot get it open. 

o.k. bye
