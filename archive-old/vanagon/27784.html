Well ignorance is often a great thing when a sudden burst
of enlightenment breaks though.  After running nearly every test I
could possibly imagine on the malrunning $400 '78 I was resigned
to a f.i. air sensor or computer problem.  For the hell of it though
since it still felt ignition related, I swapped out all the compontents
from the '77 to the '78, coil, distributor, wires, the works.
WHHOOPPEE, it runs fine (well as fine as 137k miles might) so
I start backtracking taking parts off, wires still OK, coil still
OK, that leaves me DISTRIBUTOR, now I had thouroughly dissasembled
said distributor to clean off years of grease accumulation, replaced
points, verified vacuum advance worked OK, replaced condensor for the
hell of it even though a capacitance meter said it was OK.  All of it
had looked fine, the shaft was not particularly worn, dwell steady at
any rpm, so what was the problem.  Well I know I should have looked
at this earlier but the problem is centrifugal advance only works
intermittently, comes and goes, most of the time it goes.  With vacuum
disconected, max advance is like to 10 BTDC, with vacuum it makes it
to like 18 BTDC full cranked.  Obviously this explains everything,
missing at mid rpms, then better at full tilt when vacuum advance is
topped out.  The one out of the '77 gets to about 38 BTDC at high revs.
Clearly also this is why fixing the vacuum leaks improved the running,
improved the vacuum advance slightly.  Yeah I might be an idiot but
I just never thought to check the advance curve, everything was nice
and OK at idle through about 1500 rpm which is as far as my cheapy
tachometer/dwell meter reads to so that's what I checked.  Now I need 
a replacement as I don't know why the current one is failing (occasionaly
it will advance?).  Looked at my distributor collection, it includes a 
regular Bug, one Type 3 f.i., and one 009.  Unfortunately no Bus
distributors, so I called around.  Advance Parts will get me one next day for
$69 rebuilt, $30 core, NOPI out of VWT&amp;A in Georgia want $68 and don't
need a core.  Can I do better anywhere else? and are there any better
alternatives to the stocker with me keeping the f.i.  What might be
wrong with the current one, I mean all of it looks just dandy on
dissasembly, the centrifugal assembly seems great, weights slide out
nicely, springs seem fine.  Shaft has just a bit of play toward the top
compared to the '77 but not excessive as like I said dwell is steady.

Anyway looks like I'm looking at $70 but still compared to an engine
rebuild, I'm happy as anything.
