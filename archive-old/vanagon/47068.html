&gt;It was decided that the air-cooled types are elitists needed to go away.
&gt;
&gt;Consequently, since you have an `80, until you get it appropriately modified,
&gt;you too, need to go away.  
&gt;
&gt;Yes, it is a good thing.  Now we don't have to listen to absurd stories about
&gt;old wood-paneled split-window Westies excreting various toxic fluids and
&gt;shedding parts as they drive down the expressway, endangering the lives of
&gt;innocent people and giving the _respectable_ Westfalia community a bad name.

Hey, I miss the air cooled traffic on this list! (of course, it's hot 
around here right now, so any cooling would be welcome).
Does this sound a bit jealous of the more straightforward nature of older 
van mechanics? (it was a simpler time.....mechanically at least)
;-)
