Subject: 87 Westy Sliding Door Center Hinge
Date: Sun, 10 Aug 1997 19:41:07 -0700

I bought my used Westy six months ago and love it! I spend as much time
restoring it as driving/camping... it was used hard before I got it.

I am trying to repair the center door hinge inner ball bearing... the one
on the inside of the guide lever. There are two, this one sits on the shaft
that is part of the guide lever. I have removed the rail cover and can
rotate the moving parts out, but I am reluctant to remove the hinge
assembly; . Before I start I need some advice.

There are two bolts holding the whole works on the door... Is there any
danger of screwing anything up by removing these bolts? Are the two
bearings garden-variety bearings or did VW do something tricky (The dealer
wants fifty bucks for one). Any other tips?

I want to remove the entire hinge assembly so I can take the assembly in to
a local bearing shop and have them size up a replacement. 

My Bently manual shows an exploded parts view and how to adjust, but is
skimpy on removal.
