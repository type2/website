&gt;&gt;Here is my situation, hopefully I can get some insight from some other 
&gt;&gt;members.  I have a dying engine in my '85, as well as a stuffed-up cat 
&gt;&gt;(converter, not pet.)  As we all know, I'm looking at big bucks here - 
&gt;&gt;Please no flames from the aircoolies.

Personally, Iwould go for the 2.1.  Everyone loves a little more power. Don't
they.  If you have to spend money anyway, might as well make it better.

PS, Add the power steering, and later larger front brakes too.  This will
basically give you a 91.
