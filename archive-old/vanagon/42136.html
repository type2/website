&gt; &gt;Does anyone here know about an Isuszu Trooper relabeled as a Volkswagen?
&gt; &gt;I passed one of these today on I495 (DC Beltway) and suspect it was
&gt; &gt;someone with a weird sense of humor.  Looked like the various logos off
&gt; &gt;of a vanagon.  Had a VW vinyl cover for the spare tire as well.
&gt; 
&gt; are you SURE it was a Trooper?? and not maybe an imported VW Ilitis??
&gt; VW makes a trooper-looking sort of vehicle for the german army.

How can you tell the difference.  It had the same two sized doors on the 
back of a Trooper.  Where can I see a picture of the Ilitis?

&gt; if not, then someone does indeed have a very strange sense of humor. :)


Unfortunately after tonight I'll be unsubscribed for a week and a half so 
I hope to get some info today....
