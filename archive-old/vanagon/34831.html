Subject:       J.C.whitney got my address?solved!

I ended up buying a '90 toyota turcell the other day.  while i was 
at the secretary of states office i asked them if my name, address, 
vehicle type, and shirt size are public record.  the laidy said that 
yes, michigan had just made that information public.  I suppose this 
isn't so bad, at least they arent selling it but around here, the 
only redilly available public information is the name of everyone who 
has defaulted on their taxes.  they display it in a book around town 
some where.  Have i been ranked with the criminals?  o well, guess it 
was just a matter of time.
Ed.

by the way, please don't behead me cause of my new purchace.  i still 
love my bus and will continue nursing it back to health.  it musta 
been the devils temptation, who in their right mind would buy some 
thing that has heat, a.c., goes up hills, and even starts on its own?
