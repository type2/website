Subject:      Passenger map pocket

Well, I was one of the silly people who put a map pocket on the passenger
side, and was quite pleased with myself until someone on the list correctly
noted that with the map pocket installed, you have to open the door to get
the glove compartment open.

Phoie!

I did some measuring, and I believe that if you cut away a small section of
the front of the map pocket away that you can provide enough clearance so the
glovebox will open with the door shut. I'm going to give this a try next
weekend, I'll let you know if it works.

Anyone else try this?
