Subject: Busses By the Arch

Thought I'd add my two cents worth here. Been going to Busses since the
beginning. I only get to go to one a year. My wife isn't a camper. So one of
the three day weekends we do something she wants to do and the other we go
to Busses. This will be my weekend! Look for me there. I guarantee I'll have
the only bus with a southwestern paint scheme that says &quot;Roger Bellow and
his Drifting Troubadors&quot;.  If ya miss that, I'll also have a list sticker on
the rear :-)
