I would also like any info anybody has on Westy covers.

Thanks!

&gt;
&gt;     I've covered my Syncro Westy for the last several years with an old
&gt;     parachute.  I'd like to upgrade my cover.  The question is:
&gt;
&gt;     1.  Who makes the best cover?
&gt;
&gt;     2.  Where can I get one?
&gt;
&gt;     I store my Syncro Westy from _at_ Dec. 1 thru Apl 1.  I run it weekly and
&gt;     would like to have a cover for both outside and inside use.
&gt;
&gt;     Again, Thanks for the info
&gt;
&gt;     Spev
