Subject:        Look at the list and a 93 Vanagon

Hi all,
I am currently on the type2 list. I am looking at a 93 air cooled Vanagon.
It is missing the small table. It has 72k miles on it. It has one dent that
has been repaired otherwise it is pretty clean. The asking price is $5,000.
Is this fair?
I am also interested in subscribing to this list. Could someone please tell
me about how many messages to expect to get a day.

Thanks,
Rick
