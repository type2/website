Subject: RE: Alternator Bearings (90 Amp)


&gt;The bearings in the alternator of the '87 Syncro seem to be telling that 
that
&gt;they are not much longer for this world.  VW wants $285 (before 15% 
discount)
&gt;for one and FLAPS wants $149 (before 10% discount).  I had just replaced 
the
&gt;brush/regulator in this a month ago.  My question is:  Are bearings 
available
&gt;for the 90 amp alternator.  I'm being told &quot;no&quot; here.  Anybody else had any
&gt;luck getting these bearings?


You might call King Bearing in Santa Ana, CA. If they don't have them,
they can tell you who does-- or nobody will. Sorry I don't have the
number-- area code is 714, and Directory Assistance will have the number.

They sell retail to private individuals-- I have bought stuff there before--
as well as wholesale.
