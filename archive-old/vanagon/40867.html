Subject: Turn signal woes (splittie)

This is kind of a vague request, so bear with me (you guys have never let me 
down yet!).

I've been battling with my blinkers on the weekends for about a month now. 
When I started I had absolutely no lights and a faulty switch. I've gotten to 
the point where I have all the lights working (including the dash indicator) 
except the front left. I even fixed the switch. My problem is I can't seem to 
get the last one to work! The bulb is fine and there doesn't seem to be any 
loose connections. Because the others work, I don't think the flasher unit or 
the fuses could be at fault. 

Any ideas?

Also, what is the mystery box behind the panel in front of the passengers 
knees? Could this have anything to do with it?

Don't let me down!
