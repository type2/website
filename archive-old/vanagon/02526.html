&gt; 
&gt; once upon a time, derek had an article about some australians who rigged
&gt; up a hot water shower outfit in their water-cooled syncro bus. the water
&gt; tank was low in the bus (under the back seat, i think) so as not to affect
&gt; the handling. the heat was provided by running the coolant tubes through
&gt; (or near) the water tank (kinda like rerouting the little heater under
&gt; the back seat) and then a little electric pump finished it off.

Water heaters that work like this are common on sailboats.  Try a 
chandlery (boating supplies store) or a mail order catalog to find
one.

&gt;
&gt; as far as how to shower with 10 gallons, see if you can find a Bluejacket's

10 gallons!!!!  Luxury!  When I used to sail our total water capacity was
under 50 gallons.  Try showering with 1 gallon - it can be done.  When
I go car camping I use my mini gasoline camp stove to heat water, a large
bowl to hold it and a cup to pour water over my head.  1 gallon is plenty
(and I have long hair), 2 gallons would be sheer decadence.
