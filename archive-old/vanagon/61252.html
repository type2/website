Brian, the Y370 tires you listed are OK.  They are the same tire, 
maybe a slightly different tread pattern.  The important thing to 
notice is that they are of the &quot;LT195/75 R14&quot; variety.  These tires 
all have the 1710 lbs _at_ 65 psi load carrying capacity with Load Range 
D.  I have Y370B tires on my van.  I've had these for about 3 years 
now.  The LT tires are NOT available in white wall.  These tires all 
carry the M &amp; S designation as well.  Hope this clarifies.

&gt; Y370B tires; The Sears tire guy says that the letter &quot;G&quot; or &quot;B&quot; isn't
&gt; important, is he right?  What is the difference between:
&gt; 
&gt; Yokohama Y370 LT195/75R14 (8 ply) part number 37047
&gt; Yokohama Y370G LT195/75R14 (8 ply) part number 37047
&gt; Yokohama Y370B LT195/75R14 (8 ply) part number 37047
