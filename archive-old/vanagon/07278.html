&gt;&gt;Fuel guage is a new one.  Seems to not know whether it wants to work or
&gt;&gt;not.  Sometimes it is fine, then it will act as though I shut off the
&gt;&gt;ignition.  Bumps seem to affect it.  At one point, I thought that wiggling
&gt;
&gt;could be bad connectors on tank sender. or the tank sender is going bad. :(
&gt;there is a way to replace the sender without removing the tank, but it
&gt;involves cutting a hole in the 'floor' of the bus, just above the tank. i
&gt;have the instructions already typed up if you want them.

We are having the same problem with our '81 Westy.  I have a couple of
questions about this:

How can you distinguish if it is the sender or the connections?

Is it really easier to cut a hole in the &quot;floor&quot; than to drop the tank down?

Has anyone dropped the tank in an early '80s vanagon?

If it is easier to drill a hole in the &quot;floor&quot;, would someone please send
me the instructions?

Where does one buy the appropriate replacement fuel sender?

Does anyone have any idea how much a mechanic would charge to do this for
me?  (i.e., is it cheap enough to be worth having the pros do it?)

Thanks in advance for the info!
