Hi List,

The quickest and cheapest way to prevent or cure the above symptom is to lubricate the
CV joints on your Bus/Vanagon.  It sounds ridiculous, I know, and yet I know it to be true
regardless of what we think about it.  (Physics and properties of physics seem curiously
unaffected by what we think about them)

Here it is just the way my father, the 30 year master VW tech, laid it out for me.  VW is a
cheap company.  They are so cheap that they removed the drainplugs from the '74 and
later Bug motors to save 17pf per car. (Drainplugs apparently don't sell cars).  They also
didn't put enough Molybdenum disulfide grease in your CV boots when they were &quot;crafting&quot;
your Van.  Just think what a promotion old &quot;Klaus&quot; the bean-counter got the year the
Hannover factory started skimping on grease.  Good for Klaus, more work for your typical
hopeless VW nut (like me).  I have never loved a product and hated the company that
produced it like I do VW.  Anybody else?  Different posting altogether.  Read on!!

A CV joint can be dry inside even if the boot is in perfect condition, and even if the boot
seems to have lots of grease inside, because the boot is not the critical or &quot;working&quot; part
of the joint.  The cage, or balls, of the joint are the critical or &quot;working parts of the joint,
and require the lubrication.  To check a seemingly fine joint for lack of lubrication, clean the
joint and boot thoroughly.  Remove the bolts that pass through the joint, and inspect.  If
the grease is pastey, or chalklike in consistantcy in any way, relube.  Now, this doesn't
mean to remove the joint and disassemble and place it in a parts washer,etc.  If the joint
is intact and uncontaminated with sand and dust &amp; such, you may simply use a grease
gun and a grease &quot;straw or needle&quot;, available at Pep-Boys.  Everything that you need is in
the oil section at the end of the aisle where the air filters are.  You will also find the proper
grease there under the name Moly-Graph (black container or tube).  If you have
contaminated joints due to split or cracked boots you will have to do the tear down thing,
no exceptions.  There is no way to flush the sand out properly to install one of those
&quot;zip-on boots&quot; that you install with the joint in place.  Without removing the sand you will
grind your joints to oblivion even with new grease.

To lube a dry, but otherwise serviceable, joint get a grease gun, a straw or needle
attachment, a tube of Moly-Graph grease (or two), and some rubber gloves or some old
towels to wipe your hands off with.  Remove the six bolts, flex the joint down sharply, and
find a &quot;window&quot; for the needle to pass through the balls and cage to gain access to the
boot well.  Do not puncture the boot with the needle!  It will not heal like your skin.  Pump
plenty of grease into the boot until it bulges just slightly.  Remove the grease gun and
attachments, and squeeze the boot until grease comes back through the joint.  Wipe out
the tranny drive flange &quot;cup&quot;, fill it with grease, and reattach the joint.  Your done.  Just
remember that there are 4 identical joints on 2wd vans, and 8 on Syncros (the two front
outers on the Syncro are different and will require much more work), and the two rear
outers on Vanagons are hidden in the control arm cave, you should remove the shaft
completely from the vehicle because of this fact.  The alternative to doing this is to pay
someone to do it for you and hope against hope that he gets more grease in the joints
than he does sand.  ;--)
