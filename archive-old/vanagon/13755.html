Subject: lost hills or?

For Bardley, the Johnsons, the Williams, and anyone else
wishing to try and meet at the overnite stay place, I've
located my copy of the Cal Trans publication listing
the free public rest stops.  These are not truck stops,
but rather the freebies funded by the State of CA.  They
have varying amenities, but I should think we could
all park there and sleep, and I believe they have restrooms
right near by, which should save the Johnson's right
front tire from further abuse by Bardley, if he goes on
another one of his binges!

Anyway, there are three possible in Tulare, and two
in Buttonwillow.  I'll call Cal Trans in the morning,
to see what all facilities they have at these places.
Tulare is further north, meaning after leaving it,
we'd have a longer drive to get to Red Rock, but Buttonwillow
has the disadvantage of being more west, meaning we'd
have to leave highway 99, and go away from the
redrock direction to get there.  

At any rate, in the meantime, you can all be thinking
about which you prefer.
