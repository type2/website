The one thing I really like about this list is that it is a constant
almost 24 hour source of discussion, debate and information. When the
easterners in NA sign off around eleven or so, those in the midwest and
far west still have three hours under their belt and when they sign off
the Brits and continentals (not sure how many) are just getting up and
adding their bit to the discussion. So as a consequence, an Easterner can
sign on in the morning chat with the Brits, carry that conversation on 
with the Californians around mid morning and then around -- 2 or 3 in the
afternoon everyone is going full tilt.

Now all we need is a few subscribers from Asia, Japan (Australia?) or
Russia to make it really confusing.....DC
