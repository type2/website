Subject: 71 Bus: 8Amp or 16Amp...?

Hello everybody!

The manual that came with my 71 bus is for a 69, and therefore the fuse
diagram is not correct. (the 69 apparently has 9 fuses, whereas mine has
12)

Could someone please tell me which fuses should be 8amps and which should
be 16amps?

Thanks in advance!

J89
