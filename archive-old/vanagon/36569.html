&gt; Don't get me wrong - I love the EV.  BUT, the thought of having another repair

&gt; posted) cost me $375 even with VW paying 50%.  That's a $750 bill for what
&gt; should be a do-it-yourself job on my other VWs.  In order to replace the
&gt; $185 part, they had to remove the gas tank, transmission, and some left-side

&gt; garage, all the right tools and a week's vacation.

I haven't had this problem, ...yet.  Hope I don't.

Got the EV back from the dealer yesterday.  They put in the new fuel pump
and didn't charge me anything, because it'd been less than a year since the
last one they put in.  We'll see...
