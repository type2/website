Subject: Electric confusion

Since the subject of auxillary batteries has come up, I also would like
advice on 1)how to best use the auxillary in my 85 &quot;weekender&quot;, as it
appears that all it is hooked to is the extra ciglighter for the removable
frig, which I do not intend to use.  I feel that it would be beneficial to
use one battery for ignition purposes only, and run everything else off the
second battery? or should I just wire them together, and if so, what is the
purpose of a &quot;relay&quot;?
2) There appeared to be a battery drain on the main (under passenger
seat)unit, so I checked it ala Bentley,and discovered that the test light
wired between the ground and post indeed burned moderately bright until i
removed the fuse connecting the wiper/front heater blower.  Since they both
appear to be totally inaccessible, would it make sense to connect a switch
to these fuse terminals(in other words, have an extra switch that activates
these 2 accessories only), or should i try to solve both question 1&amp;2 at the
same time, and utilize a battery switch that would activate one of the
batteries for all accessories (turn it on after starting the engine from the
other battery, which is connected to the ignition only)?  

PS--anybody interested in the removable frig?  It is unique in that there is
absolutely no motor noise when plugged in to ac, while cooling better than
my kitchen unit.  I plan to stick with a regular cooler with ice for the van.
