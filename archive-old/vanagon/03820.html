&gt; If there is a lot of air in your pressure tank (and the rest of the 
&gt; system), but your recovery tank is overfull (coolant level way above the 
&gt; cap bottom) that has to be the problem.  The only way for air to get into 
&gt; a pressurized system (cooling system) is to come from a place of higher 
&gt; pressure (combustion chamber), the only way to do .....

Just to make things slightly less complicated. Im agine that when hot your
cooling system is pressurised and as it cools down the fluid contracts
and pressure drops. If there is a hole in any one of your components ie
radiator or rad hose, then as the system cools down air will be  drawn in
from the atmposphere or even through a leaky rad cap.

Before assuming that your head gaskets are faulty and that air is being
forced IN; why not check for
the following: a) coolant in the oil; b) leaky rad (even a pinhole) or c) bad
hoses or connections. All of these could be allowing air to drawn in and
reducing your cooling efficiency. There may be a way to pressure test the
rad....and a rad cap if they have them. DC
