You may recall my raving this AM about my bus being broken into...

Well, I looked it over real good when I got home, and realised that they'd 
been into the back hatch, too.  Nothing was missing; I even had a couple
of wrenches back there.

I did find out what they were after, though.  The bus.

I went to move it, and when I went to start it, nothing happened.  I got
the flashlight and peered underneath, and yup, the wires had been taken
off the ignition switch, and I could see where some arcing had occurred.
Shit!  Someone tried to hot wire my baby!

Luckily, last weekend I had put the dash tray and steerint column support
back in, which makes it much more difficult to do this sort of thing.  I
am going to try a couple of counter-measures, like a plate under there to 
make it harder to get to the wires, and maybe some alternative fasteners
and locktite to keep someone from taking them off.

I also bought a Club, the truck version, so if they do get it started, 
they can't drive off with it, so maybe that will discourage them altogether.

Sheesh, I'm scared to put any more time and effort into this baby - its 
going to end up being someones parts store!  100% discount!  I can see
my brand new engine and tranmission in someone else's lowered, primered
piece of shit!

Had to get this out!
