Subject: Re: Replace Headlights?

If you have the round headlights you have a lot of alternatives. The easiest
would be to swap in  sealed halogen bulbs, next would be to try the Hella or
Bosch or other aftermarket lenses with separate bulbs, if you do this you can
buy high power replacement bulbs. But this is all moot if your problem is low
voltage. It is easy to check the voltage at the headlight plug with a
voltmeter, you should have at least 12v with the engine running. 

Good luck
