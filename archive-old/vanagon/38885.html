Subject: Bluto moves to Dallas

I sent this out yesterday and from what I can gather it never made it to
the list.  Sorry if it's a repeat...

Volks,

For those of you who keep up with these things, I will be relocating
from San Diego, California to Dallas, Texas as of this Friday, April
5th.  The move is work-related.  Thanks to this list, I already have
some VW friends in Dallas to lessen the impact of moving 1,300 miles
from Southern California, where I have lived just about all of my life.
So please scratch one '73 Safare Custom Camper (Bluto aka DaBoat) from
CA.S.SD and add it to TX.Dal.  I will be un-subbing from the list on 
Friday and re-subbing in a couple of weeks after I get settled.  See
you all then, and thanks for listening...

-David
