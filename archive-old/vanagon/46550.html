Subject: fatal waterpumper flaw/Subaru?

Bob Hoover wrote:

&gt;The water-cooled horizontally opposed four cylinder engine designed by
&gt;Volkswagen has a fatal design flaw... The nature -- and cure -- for this
problem was defined and
&gt;confirmed -- twice -- in the judgements passed down as a result of VW's
&gt;lawsuits against Subaru, who corrected the flaw.  But rather than correct the
&gt;flaw themselves -- and pay Subaru royalties, Volkswagen abandoned the design...

I'm unfamiliar with this legal contretemps, and as the driver of an '87
Subaru as well as a VW, am curious as to what exactly the flaw is, and how
Subaru got mixed up in being sued and correcting it.

Thanks for any clarification.
