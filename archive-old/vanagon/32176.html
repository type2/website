Rick,

I won't be able to make the January trip, but I'd like to go in Feb(on 
Pres. day), so let me know if it's going to happen.  I even bought a new 
sleeping bag for the occasion(REI had a sale:)).  I think Deception Pass 
sounds good, unless the weather is nice.  There is nothing more boring 
than the Washington coast if it's raining.  Hopefully there will be 
electrical outlets, since some of us are still without heaters...

Everybody else,

I am working on my web page and trying to include a VW section with 
everybody's homepage addresses.  If you'd like me to include yours, email 
me with your URL.  My email is:
cstand_at_u.washington_dot_edu 

and my URL is at:
http://weber.u.washington_dot_edu/~cstand

Of coure if you list your URL on the list here I am assuming that you 
don't mind it being public and I'll go ahead and put it on my list.

Craig
