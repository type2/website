Subject: Porsche power

Guy in CT that parts out Porsches has a reasonably priced start on your
Porsche-powered VW van:  a 2.7liter (roughly 150hp) Porsche six for $1700.
Leakdown is supposedly 10% or less all the way around, and he takes charge
cards.  Email me for more info if Six Fever is contagious.
