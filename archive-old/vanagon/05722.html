&gt;Ok here is the situation, I found a guy witha 79 camper.  He wants $3200 
&gt;for it.  Here is a general description of it.
&gt;
&gt;79 westfalia
&gt;beige
&gt;59,000 original miles, has service record of every service except the 60,000
&gt;milse service because it is not there yet.  Original manuals.  Engine

---------------------
Take it! Sounds like it is in about as good a condition as it can get.
Dicker with the price if you want, but even at $3200 I'd rush to be the
first in line.
FYI: Here are prices for the various parts from various places:
(WCM: West Coast Metric; RMMW: Rocky Mountain Motor Works; JCW: JC Whitney)
Pop-Top Camper seal: WCM: $75.90; JCW:$74.95
Luggage Rack Base Seal: WCM: $24.15; JWC: $23.95
Canvas Replacement: WCM: $295.90; JCW: $259.95
If you want to work on the rust under the windshield, you might have to
replace its seal, too:
w/out molding groove: WCM: $28.00; RMMW: $19.95
w/ molding groove: WCM: $79.00; RMMW: $99.95
