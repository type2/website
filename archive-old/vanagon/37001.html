&gt;&gt;&gt;	We have the ultimate, a lime green '78 Westy as our chariott. 
&gt;144,000

&gt;HELP (with 
&gt;&gt;&gt;our van). Problems/Questions we have:
&gt;&gt;&gt;1) Below half a tank our fuel gage doesn't work! (arrgh!)  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Replace the fuel gauge sending unit. The engine and fuel tank 
&gt;should be
&gt;&gt;removed for this operation.  
&gt;
&gt;Contrary to what the manual says, the gas tank can be removed from 
&gt;a late Bus without removing the engine.  Only a few ancilliary 
&gt;items have to come off (heater blower, air flow meter, etc.)  It 
&gt;was a VERY tight squeeze when I did it, but it did come out.
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

I agree; I've removed the tank from a late bus with the engine in place,
too.  One thing I wanted to add is that it also makes it a little easier
if you lower the rear of the engine an inch or two by unbolting the cross
bar that supports it.  You shouldn't have to disconnect any wires, etc.
for this since you aren't moving it that much, but keep an eye on things
just in case, like the throttle linkage, fuel line, etc.
