&gt;Just had to throw this in:  Minutes ago I walked past a Subaru

&gt;4,000 rpm, torque was something like 224.  Just injected, no turbos.  
&gt;It had a six coil ignition system, at least that is what I got from 
&gt;the poster.  I should have walked in and started asking annoying 
&gt;questions.  I wonder how big that engine is?  hmmmmm

IT FITS!   yup, KEP also make a plate, same as older Loyale 1.8 motors. That 
could be real fun, rivals Porsche 3.2l power, also about 230HP.  Tim
