&gt; Walt - How do you &quot;check&quot; your propane level?

You can buy these stickers which attach to propane tanks and are heat
sensitive. When warm water is poured down the side of them, the cooler
propane portion becomes dark yellow making for an easy read and comparison.
The stickers  measure the propane in inches to let
you know the amount remaining in the tank. We got ours at a camp store in
Palo Alto. DC
