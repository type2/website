Subject: 1.9L waterboxer rebuild


I need am trying to rebuild my '84 vanagon's engine, but I can't get the
pistons out.  I need specs or any info I can get on the special tool that
only VW makes (and is very pricey)  for removing the wrist pins.

Also, If anyone out there is experienced in rebuilding the waterboxers,
please tell me some stories, rumors, tricks, or  precautions that may be of
interest.
Thanks-------- wish me luck!!!!
