Subject: oxy sensors $$$$


My cousin's '87 Westphalia had the same problem, except for the
coolant consumption.
The intervals were more like 2 - 2.5 hours, but he would have to
do the same, i.e., turn it off for a few minutes and start over again.

This got to be quite bothersome on the 7,500 mile round trip to the west coast,
so he stopped at a VW repair shop in the middle of nowhere (not a dealer),
and the mechanic told him that it was the part of the wire harness that
carries the signal from the Oxygen sensor to the computer, and that the
interference from something it passes around (alternator? regulator?) was
getting the computer confused.  He had a third-party SHIELDED extension put
in between and told my cousin that this was a common problem with those
engines.  Total bill $15.00 (no kidding!) .  The problem has never come back
in the last 6,000 miles since then, including the rest of his trip.

What is this all about?  is this thing bogus, or is there merit to the
mechanic's cure? Does anyone dare ask about this to the two bigmouths on 
public radio?
Thanks...

&gt;   after embarking on a three week road trip I have developed this problem 
&gt;   with my van that I can't seem to fix, no matter how much $$$ i drop into 
&gt;   that thing. I have regained access to my e-mail account for about three 
&gt;   days so I thought I'd hit my faorite vw owners up for some ideas as to 
&gt;   what my problem may be, here is the lowdown.  The van is driven for about 
&gt;   45 minutes and the red water temp warning light goes on and the 
&gt;   acclerator starts to get weak and after enough time it eventually wilkl 
&gt;   lose all power and have to be turned off for about two minutes before the 
&gt;   whole process repeats itself, excluding the 45 minutes of worry-free 
&gt;   driving in the begining.
