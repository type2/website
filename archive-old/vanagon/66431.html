Subject:      Re: Sagging on one side - Westys

Yup! I have noticed that my '90 sags. I attribute it to the camping
utilities weight, although it seems that VW engineering could have
compensated for this. At least when the water tank is empty and no
supplies, etc.

Please inform me of a good long term solution if one is available or found.

Thanks!

Chris

&gt;Harald brings up a good point.  My '91 seems to be sagging on the left
&gt;(drivers side).  It is extremely low mileage at under 75,000 kms (47,000
&gt;miles).  This past summer we took several camping trips with the van full,
&gt;especially the water tank.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else experienced the drivrs side sag on their Westy?  Any
&gt;possible long term solutions?
