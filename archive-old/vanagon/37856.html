Subject: next CCC's camp trip, April


The next CCC's camping trip (other than the one you guys are
stewing over imminently) is slated for April 27th at Red Rock.  However,
a few have indicated that they would rather go somewhere now, since
many visited Red Rock last year.  

I'm going off to Europe on Wednesday for 12-20 days (depending on
if my wait-listing comes thru and I can return sooner, rather than
later), so will &quot;deal&quot; with this when I return.

But I just wanted to let you all know about the proposed date.  WE
can in the meantime be thinking about dates, etc.  If I don't
get back from the trip until the latter date, I won't be back
regarding this until possibly April 11th or 12th, but promise
to tend to it then, so stay tuned...
