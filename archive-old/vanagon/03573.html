&gt;TIRES   I bought a 77 Camper about two years ago. I figured when one of 
&gt;the worn out tires blew it was time to replace the set. I called a dozen 
&gt;different places and received a dozen different reccommedations including 
&gt;three different Michelins (XZX, LTX, ?). Rather than risk retreads or 

I, too, am (still) shopping around for new tires. What I was told is that
Michelin is *temporarily* out of XZXs and that manufacturing will resume in
about 2 weeks. Does that make sense?

&gt;GAS CAP   Every time I filled the tank I'd get gas fumes in the bus for 
&gt;about the next hundred miles, especially when I turned a corner. I was 

Do you usually top off at the gas station? Try not to and see if it helps.

&gt;HEATER   OK, I've had my share of ice-box winter driving here around the

There is an ad in the october issue of Hot VWs on page 18. It's called
Instaheater and is basically an electric heater blower with a magnet so
you can attach it to any steel surface inside the car.It comes in 4
different versions: 360, 540, 720, and 960 watts and cost between $189 and
$259. Phone # is (718) 476-1723. I'm not sure this will be sufficient for
a van, though.

&gt;MUFFLER   Where can I find a decent muffler system? I did my calling 

After lots of phone calls, I finally got a muffler for my 75 bus from the Bus
Boys (phone#: (916) 244 1616). It's not stock but a Monza style exhaust
system and hooks up directly at the heater boxes, so there's no need for
costly J-pipes and elbow, etc... It's $105. (not legal in CA, however).
