trans:

&gt;Guess that would solve any potential drive train strength problem. It
&gt;COULD be smog legal too- use a contemporary mass-flow-sensor FI '5
&gt;liter'  Mustang engine. Say, David Schwartz- this could simplify
&gt;your maintenance parts list....

The problem is the Pantera was a pre-smog type vehicle (early 70's)
if I am not mistaken, nor is it FI. Then again I can't really recall the
exact details, other than it was having the same problems with the US
safety regulations (bumpers etc.) at the time, that the prototype
Concept 1 had, only the Pantera was cancelled rather than modified.

Also I don't think that the new mustang type engines would mate to the
trans used in the V8 engines eventhough they were made by the same
company.

It could however realize the dream of winning at the drag strip, picture
yourself at the next Bug-Out. An '82 Vanagon taking the top prize for
the bracket races :-0

Cheers,

David
