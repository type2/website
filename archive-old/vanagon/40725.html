Subject: HELP! EV is trying to kill my wife......

Or so she says. Bus is '93 EV MV auto (sorry Ric) with approx. 40k miles.
In summer months, when fully warm the bus stalls after 2-5 mins. at idle
(i.e.,. stop for light, start to pull out on green &amp; bus dies). It usually,
but not always re-starts immediately.
Normal &quot;tune up&quot; items have been replaced to no avail. One item of note:
the bus trashed a set of plugs in a week or so (burned to &quot;smithereens&quot;),
and there is an &quot;arc&quot; between block &amp; alternator bracket.
Any thoughts would be appreciated as Betsy is threatening to trade for a
Volvo (good grief...)

Many Thanks, Moe
