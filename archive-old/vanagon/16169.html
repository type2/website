Gerry stated that:

&gt;I waved at a Eurovan MV yesterday, and he honked and waved back!  &lt;grin&gt;


Oh, RIGHT ON!  Did you chase 'im down and sign him up on vanagon_at_lenti...?

As an aside, I'll often keep an eye out (no, I don't have a glass eye!) for
other EVs and &quot;cool&quot; T1s, T2s, and T3s, and I have to say that the majority
of T4 drivers are not into this friendly wave business  :(

I get better results when I drive my wife's '91 GLI/GTX;  you won't always
get a wave, but you almost always get an acknowledgement from the GTI/GLI
crowd (well, the 16v ones, anyway...  :)   )
