Subject: Plugging in the van...

Howdy,

This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went out to the mountains for a 2-day
getaway.  The site we were in had A.C., so we plugged in the van.  Dan
asked an intriguing question... if we're plugged in, why can't we charge
the batterys and run the lights off of the A.C.?

Good question.  I assume that the lights don't run off of the A.C. when the
van is plugged in... so, has anyone rigged a little battery charger to
charge the batteries while 'connected'?
