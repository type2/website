&gt; Last night, was travelling home and saw an early model bus (sorry, I'm not
&gt; yet fluent with all of the model years) with the following bumper sticker:
&gt; 
&gt; I BRAKE FOR POSSUMS
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From all of Unca Joel's postings on this thread, I wondered if the owner of
&gt; this bus is a member of this listserv, or is a common thread to which I am
&gt; not privy, having come on the scene only lately?  (this sighting was in St.
&gt; Louis, northbound on Lindbergh Blvd, Thursday night, 1/10/96).  I tooted the
&gt; horn and waved as I passed.
&gt; 
&gt; As I continued on my merry way, I began to ponder how Unca Joel would feel
&gt; about braking for possum, since speeding up would increase the likelihood of
&gt; a clean kill (assuming, of course, that the VW bus is the weapon of choice
&gt; for hunting such a succulent delicacy).  It would seem to me to be an ideal
&gt; weapon.  Think of it...Two tons of steel, coupled with an adequate tread
&gt; pattern, would further tenderize and flatten the flesh to allow its use in
&gt; possum rouladen, minute possum steaks, etc., etc.  The possibilities are
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; endless!
&gt; 
&gt; Whaddaya think?  ;-)
