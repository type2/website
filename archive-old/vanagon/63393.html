Subject:      '84 Engine /Heads

I've found the heads on my '84 GL need replacement due to corrosion
around the seal area. Does anyone know if VWOA is taking care of this
problem? If so how would one pursue this? If not I need to find a cheap
source of rebuilt or used heads. I would consider purchase of a used
engine in good condition with rebuilt heads.
