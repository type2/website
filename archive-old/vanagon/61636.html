Subject: F/Re: preventing theft

Volks, 
I have thought about this, the theft situation and Vanagons and am
considering installing right-hand drive from South Africa to make my
Vanagon undesirable to a thief. Not only would my Vanagon be undesirable
to steal, but -if- stolen, I would merely find out which mailman could
not be accounted for at the time my Vanagon would be stolen! Clever huh?
What do you Volks think?
