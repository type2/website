Subject: Re: Tops that pop straight up

it has been my experience that there are/were lots of different companies
that manufactured some form of pop tops for VW Vans. Some of the better
known names include the Sportsmobile, Douglas Super Top etc, and a lot more
that I won't go into detail about. Also it is worth noting that there a
number of vans outfitted w/ pop tops that were shipped back from Europe
(i.e. Dormobiles).

My point is that you could probably create A FAQ on all of the different
pop-tops that have been created or added to the rooves of VW vans. That
doesn't even include the numerous fibreglass &quot;hih tops&quot; that were outfitted
as well.


&gt; Regarding the thread on non-Westy pop tops that go straight up [rather than
&gt; hinged]: I've seen a couple of breadloaf buses with tops installed by a
&gt; company called ASI. These tops had a mechanism that included some really
&gt; long springs and an x-bar linkage so that the weight of the top was easily
&gt; raised straight up.
&gt;
&gt; Both of the buses with these tops that I have seen were 7 passenger models
&gt; that had the pop-top added later.
&gt;
&gt; As to the question about the location of Sportsmobile - I've think I remember
&gt; seeing them advertise in &quot;Motorland&quot; , the magazine sent to AAA auto club
&gt; members. I'll look through an issue tonight if it isn't already thrown out.
&gt;
&gt; Best Regards,
