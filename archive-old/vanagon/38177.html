Subject: RE: Clean air wannabe


&gt;For some time I've enjoyed the travails of the California list members in
&gt;dealing with the emissions gestapo. Turns out that the EPA has probably 
tired
&gt;of trying to get Atlanta to clean up it's sewage before we send it 
downstream
&gt;to Alabama and is going to focus on auto emissions instead. As I understand
&gt;it, cars under 7 years will be examined in simple local tests while older
&gt;cars will be examined in more centralized locations by &quot;THE STATE&quot;. Not 
only
&gt;will you have to pass the measurements but all the original pieces will 
have
&gt;to be there and functioning. My 81 that was comfortably outside the current
&gt;inspection requirements is now of course swept back in.

I just heard a radio news story about new changes in CA emissions laws--
seems that cars that flunk one emissions test, will now have Big Brother
breathing down their necks for a number of years, instead of the present
only-until-you-get-it-fixed scheme. I'm still not clear on the details.

Anyone know more about this? And, if it's already in effect, or if it's
not until the first of the month, or first of the year, or etc.?
