Subject: Bought '69 Westy

        Hi Volks!  On a recent vacation to Michigan I attended a nice VW
show in Holland.  While there, I bought a fantastic '69 Westy that has
20,500 original miles!  It is really in incredible shape.  The ONLY flaw is
that the canvas was partially consumed by a hungry mouse.  I've been
checking around for replacement canvas with a number of places and the
prices range from 200 to 300 dollars.  Will you good people give me an idea
of the price/quality of canvas replacements you've experience with (and what
company you prefer/recommend)?

Thanks.
