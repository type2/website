Subject: Re: should YOU own a vw bus? a test to tell you. :)

Joel, 
While a straight &quot;C&quot; answer qualifies an individual as a potential 
Vanagon owner, allow me to propose the following slightly modified 
version to qualify split/breadloaf owners:

&gt; 
&gt;          Quiz: Should You Own A Volkswagen Bus?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From time to time, those of us with hopelessly shot old Volkswagen
&gt; buses get The Question.  You know what I mean: a co-worker or a friend
&gt; or a family member will catch a glimpse of the way the trouble light
&gt; gleams on the one good fender of your pride and joy and say,
&gt; &quot;Maybe I should get one of these.  What are they really like to own?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; To save time and trouble, I've developed a carefully researched quiz
&gt; (meaning I've spent most of the afternoon goofing off on this instead
&gt; of doing useful work that my boss wants) that will help you in such
&gt; times.  Keep a supply of these handy -- to order, reply by electronic
&gt; mail and please have your Visa card number at the top of the message --
&gt; and just pass them out whenever someone sighs, looks at your classic
&gt; bus, and says &quot;You know, I always wanted one of those ...&quot;
&gt; This quiz will give them the definitive answer to the question of
&gt; whether they are the right kind of person to own a Volkswagen bus.
&gt; Use a #2 pencil, take your time, and remember, answer truthfully --
&gt; the marriage you save may be your own.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  You climb into the driver's seat of a car you haven't driven
&gt; for nearly a week, turn the key, and nothing happens.  You:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Call AAA and ask that the car be towed directly to the dealer
&gt;     where you pay to have the charging system fully inspected.  The
&gt;     dealer ends up billing you $470 for the inspection and $110 for
&gt;     a new battery, and you have to spend an additional $75 at a detail
&gt;     shop to get the grease stains out of the floor mats.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Call AAA and have them jump-start the car, at which point
&gt;     you buy a new battery for $95 and pay another $30 to have it
&gt;     installed.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Jump-start the car from whatever other vehicle in your
&gt;     stable is currently running and drive around at high speed
&gt;     to charge the battery quickly.

      D.  Crawl underneath it with your screwdriver and cigarette lighter 
      (or mallet, if you are less mechanically deft) to jar the solenoid
      loose.

&gt; 
&gt; 2.  A few weeks later, the car does the same thing, this time on a
&gt; new battery.  You:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Call AAA, have them take the car back to the dealer and talk
&gt;     loudly about small claims court; this time they charge you $780
&gt;     to replace the alternator, but because you were so outraged, they
&gt;     throw in a new pine-tree air freshener and put paper mats on
&gt;     the carpet (which get wadded up under the brake pedal anyway
&gt;     and therefore still let the mechanic smear grease on your carpet).
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Call AAA, have the car jump-started, and take it to the
&gt;     dealer where you quickly trade it in on a new model before
&gt;     the problem recurs, at a total cost, including tax, license,
&gt;     depreciation, interest, and dealer markup, of close to $6000.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Realize you have a short-circuit somewhere that's causing
&gt;     a slow leak, so you buy a battery-terminal cut-off switch and
&gt;     install it yourself, for a total cost of $4.96 including tax
&gt;     and a new grease-impregnated felt ring for under the terminal.

      D.  Rig an extra 10 guage wire to give the solenoid an extra shot
      at working while your clothes are still dry (but keep that
      screwdriver handy)

&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Having decided to sell the car, you dither about what to get
&gt; as a replacement, and finally decide on:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Another of the same make, because Consumer's Report gave
&gt;     it their highest overall rating.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Another of the same make, because you just read in Car and
&gt;     Driver that the J.D. Powers index has rated this brand in the top
&gt;     three on overall customer satisfaction for the past four years.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  A Volkswagen Bus. I mean, as long as the car's going to have
&gt;     problems, you might as well have something absolutely useful and
&gt;     functional and big enough to sleep in, right?
&gt; 
      D.  Who sells cars?  If it's worth money, it's worth restoring, 
      or at least parking in back until you get around to working on it.


&gt; 4.  When buying your new car, you make your purchasing decision:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  By shopping a number of local dealers to find which one has a
&gt;     free courtesy van and loaner cars while yours is in the shop.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  By shopping a number of local dealers until you find one that
&gt;     has the model you like in that wicked opalescent plum.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Because when you see the car, your arms start shaking and your
&gt;     knees get weak and you know that if you don't have THAT car, you
&gt;     will never be able to function as a fulfilled human being.

      D.  Because you have a spare engine that might fit, and the 
      floorboards aren't *that* rusty.  Besides this one looks 
      *challenging*.

&gt; 
&gt; 5.  When you have found the car you want to buy, you pay:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  $50 over factory invoice, and you know it's the factory invoice
&gt;     because the dealer showed you a computer printout.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  The dealer's asking price, and you snicker all the way home,
&gt;     knowing you made a great deal because they gave you *your*
&gt;     full asking price on the trade in.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Every penny you can scrape together, including what you have
&gt;     in your 401(K) and next month's house payment.  I mean, some
&gt;     things are just more important than others.

      D.  The tow truck driver an extra $10.00 not to hook up to the
      bumper.

&gt; 
&gt; 6.  When you arrive home with your new purchase, you immediately:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Spray the interior with Scotchgard so that it won't stain when
&gt;     the preschooler dumps a McDonald's Happy Meal on it and then
&gt;     sits on the ketchup smears to keep out of trouble.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Put a car cover on it in the garage so that nothing drips on
&gt;     the new paint.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Put a clean layer of kitty litter under it so you can see
&gt;     where the drips under it are coming from.

      D.  Start explaining to the wife what a deal it was.
&gt; 
&gt; 7.  You know you're an enthusiast, because the first weekend you
&gt; own this car, you:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Look through the Crutchfield catalog to see what components
&gt;     you can add to enhance the bass response on the CD-player.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Look through the ads in back issues of Road &amp; Track to see
&gt;     to see what rims will make it look really baaaaad.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Look through the Bus Stop catalog to see when they're
&gt;     planning a sale so you can stock up on the parts you expect to
&gt;     fail in the next few months.

      D.  Start calling junkyards near and far to see who has a spare
      left rear taillight lens.

&gt; 
&gt; 8.  When it's time for your first oil change, you:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Take it to the dealer -- after all, it's important to have
&gt;     factory-certified technicians work on your vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Take it to Sears -- after all, it's important to have a
&gt;     handy local shop to blame if anything goes wrong.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Drain the engine and refill it with Castrol -- after all,
&gt;     the Porsche racing team was sponsored by Castrol for all of their
&gt;     famous wins in the sixties and seventies.

      D.  Pour in the fourth quart of oil with the fourth tank of gas
      and change the filter.

&gt; 
&gt; 9.  When it's time for its first overnight service, you:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Take it to the dealer and are ruined by the experience of
&gt;     driving the loaner car, which is the next most expensive model,
&gt;     equipped with leather interior, four cup-holders and a 10-CD
&gt;     jukebox.  Driving your old car isn't going to be the same after
&gt;     you've been in this one.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Put it off -- after all, this car's reputation for quality
&gt;     means you should never have to worry about service, right?
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Car-pool with your spouse/neighbor for the next three weeks
&gt;     while you wait for the new cylinder heads in the mail, cause the
&gt;     old ones got really damaged when you used that air impact wrench
&gt;     to put in those new sparkplugs, cause it was much faster, and you
&gt;     did that so you would have time to fix that heater box and you
&gt;     can replace that after the car is back on the road as long as you
&gt;     don't run the heater till then...

      D.  (applications now being accepted, C. looks universal)

&gt; 
&gt; 10.  A somewhat irresponsible family member asks to borrow
&gt; your car.  You:
&gt; 
&gt;     A.  Are a little nervous, but know that at least the car's advanced
&gt;     safety features will protect the driver even in the case of an
&gt;     accident. That way you can savor the pleasure of the kill yourself.
&gt; 
&gt;     B.  Suddenly remember that you've entered the Atascadero
&gt;     Porcupine Grooming Contest that weekend and that you need
&gt;     the car to bring along your quill-removal gear.
&gt; 
&gt;     C.  Spend half an hour going over the details, like how to start
&gt;     the car on the first three tries, how to keep it running without
&gt;     stalling until it warms up, and how the headlight switch operates
&gt;     the backup lights, the bass button on the radio works the parking
&gt;     lights and the heater fan, and the rear defroster switch works the
&gt;     high beams, and of course the heater box that is still broken even
&gt;     after you changed the spark plugs so be sure to bring a jacket and
&gt;     a towel to wipe the condensation off the inside of the windshield.
&gt;     Oh, and don't forget NOT to push in the cigarette lighter.
&gt;     You don't want to know what happens if you do that.

      D.  Borrow my car? After all the work I put into it?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; YOUR SCORE
&gt; 
&gt; If you answered A to more than five questions, you should own a
&gt; Volvo.  Rush right out and buy one, preferably an 850, which after
&gt; all has front-wheel drive and is therefore more up-to-date.  Be sure
&gt; to ask the car sales person about what all the letters and numbers on
&gt; the tires mean; after all, it's the sales person's job to be completely
&gt; informed on every technical aspect of your car, right?
&gt; 
&gt; If you answered B to more than five questions, you should own a
&gt; Japanese car.  Any kind, basically; they're pretty much inter-
&gt; changeable, as long as somewhere in the model designation there's
&gt; a two-letter code with at least one X in it.  That's the important thing.
&gt; 
&gt; If you answered C to five or more questions, you may actually be already
&gt; far enough gone round the bend to own a Volksagen bus.  To decide for
&gt; certain, put a half-pound of crushed ice in your shorts, make a slurry
&gt; of beach sand and pea-gravel with used motor oil and grind it into your
&gt; scalp, and stand out in the rain overnight, smiling like an idiot
&gt; because you know that Experience Builds Character.
&gt; If you manage that, you're in the club!
