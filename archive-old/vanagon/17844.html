Subject: Rear light switches: 1982 westfalias

Dear Vanagon list members,
I though I'd let the group know that if you happen to have an unused switch
slot below the emergency light switch, I have something to fill it with.
It turns out that the rear window heater switch from old junked rabbits of
roughly the same year (1982) will fit nicely into that slot.  This switch
can be used for lots of things, but what I have used it for is to turn on 
all rear interior lights.  The lights are powered by removing the 
connection to Martha's Silver secret and placing it on one terminal of the
switch.  Also, it is useful to use fairly heavy gauge lamp cord and to
run 2 leads:  1 lead is connected to hot always and the other is connected
to the other terminal of the switch.  In this way, you can turn on the
inside lights from the front or someplace else in the camper.  The wires 
can be fed up over the driver's side window (with difficulty) to make a
nice original-looking installation.
I looked for a double pole double throw switch which would fit there and
could not find one.  If I had, this would have enabled one to cut the lights
on and off from either the front or the rear independantly of the switch
position.
