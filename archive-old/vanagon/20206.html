Well, as Mr. Steve said, get a friend with a truck.  Or, rent one from 
the same place you get the trailer from.

Yeah, you're insane.  Why don't you get that 2 liter engine for your bus. 
Put your old engine inside your bus and drive up here with a friend.  Then
put the engine in the &quot;new&quot; bus, and drive it down, the friend is to help
with driving the extra vehicle.  I'd be willing to bring some tools over
to Jeff's and help you install the engine.
