Subject: 82 Westy Heads 

I decided to return my new $344  AMC head from Spain and have my used (with 40K miles on them) 
AMC heads rebuilt by Mark Stephen's in  California.  He guarantees after he is done with them they are 
good for 100K miles. He said he likes the AMC aftermarket heads better because they don't crack and 
its true ---after 40K miles --and 1 head losing its valveseat ---they did not crack!!  AMC uses a softer 
aluminum --allowing expansion.  Factory VW heads will crack as well as the other aftermarket brand 
---TEC.  Both of my heads rebuilt by Steven's will be about $360.  ---and yes even a fully seatless head 
can be salvaged and guaranteed for 100K.   I know miracles happen.  But I won't believe this one until 
my odometer reads 241,000. 

Thanks Bob on your advice on drilling oil galleries----drilling galleries in (helicopter engines ?) in Veitnam 
while oil is flushing out, in the jungle heat and rain,  in the field, with Mig's strifing everything in sight, by 
moonlight, under  41mm mortar attack must have been a challange ----if not &quot;hell on earth&quot;?
