Subject:      silver socket and collapsible spare tire

lemme see if i get this right:

- the sockets are only on 80, 81, and 82 campers.
- those year campers came with a collapsible spare tire???

what went under the front of the camper in place of the regular spare tire?
my 80 bus had the same spare position as my 88 bus.  why would a Vanagon
camper need a collapsible spare tire?

and who put the silver socket in the bus? the dealer? the factory?
