&gt; Does everyone know that the ignition key unlocks the gas cap?  I had been
&gt; using the gas cap key just like the previous owner of my '84 Vanagon had
&gt; instructed until my father told me that the ignition key unlocked it.  He

Any key will unlock it...  Your ignition key will unlock mine, My 
Ignition- yours...   The Gas-cap is not a high security lock.  Almost any 
VW width key will open any Vanagon gas cap.

After noticing how easily my gascap opened with my ignition key, I tried 
my ignition key and gascap key on a westphalia's gas cap (while talking 
to the owner and with his permission) to see if this was as low security 
as it seemed.  (the owner was asking me about mail order vs. parts stores 
after I had parked next to his westy in a mall Pkng. lot... Really 
friendly club we all join by driving these bricks isn't it?)
