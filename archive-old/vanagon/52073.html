I've read that too; I think it was a recent posting on this list.  I'm
sceptical, however.

I understand that the O2 sensor measures oxygen in the exhaust vs. oxygen
in the air, and this differential results in a potential (voltage) which
is sensed by the ECU.  How does this O2 ratio translate into CO?
