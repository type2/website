&gt; Does it use the same pressure plate as a Rabbit?  My Parts Place catalog

&gt; the same pressure plate as the Rabbit, but the same disk as the Bus (which
&gt; kind of makes too much sense to be true).  Any thoughts from the gallery?

Alex,

The bus clutch disk might fit a diesel Vanagon if it is 215mm.  My 82 diesel 
came with a 068 141 032A clutch disk (Fichtel &amp; Sachs). 

There is no way a Rabbit pressure plate will work in a diesel Vanagon.  
They are completely different.  My old pressure plate says &quot;068 101 F&amp;S&quot; 
on it, which is kind of odd for a VW part number, so I'm not sure if this 
is the factory part no.

Mike
