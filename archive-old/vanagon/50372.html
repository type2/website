Jeff and/or Jean-Marie;

I wouldn't call your note with the included Word Document and Excel
Spreadsheet a mistake.  It was a puzzle to be sure, but I had a hint as to
what had happened because a similiar thing happened to me a few weeks ago.

Your note had both documents in the body of the text, but they were
UUENCODED.  To make them &quot;whole again&quot;, just cut the &quot;funny text stuff&quot; out
of the text body and make them two separate text files --- one for the Word
Document and one for the Excel Spreadsheet.  Then run each of then through
a UUDECODE utility.  Of course if you don't have a UUDECODE utility you are
out of luck.

When this happened to me it was because I attached a message that had an
attachment to the message I was sending!  Apparently, you can have only one
level of attachement.

Since I was able to UUDECODE both documents, I could post both of them back
in text form for you if you like.  I found the Word Document a very good
summary of what to do if you have Vanagon Driveability problems.  The
Spreadsheet would be more useful to a person who has the right diagnostic
tools.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 	I am really sorry for the problem with the posting of the driveability
&gt; fixes. I got the message I sent. I see probably everybody got the same
&gt; jiberish. I have resent the documents to those that have requested it. I
&gt; sent the documents as an attachment but it didn't come to me that way. It
&gt; came in as part of the message. But one person replied that he got the
&gt; check sheet but not the written pages? I'm sorry if I caused some people
to
&gt; incur extra charges on their e-mail accounts for nothing. If anyone has
any
&gt; ideas as to why I am having what appears to me as a software problem, or
a
&gt; how to use software problem please help me out. I am using Eudora pro on
a
&gt; Win95 system. I attached the documents to a message, I use MIME encoding.
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; 	This may be the wrong time to be asking for Vanagon help but I need help
&gt; finding a part. I need the oil filler/dipstick tube for an 82 Vanagon
&gt; diesel. It's the long plastic one that has the pull out filler neck in
it.
&gt; The oil fill cap screws onto this. TIA
