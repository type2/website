Subject: Bus Vulture stalks another victim


Well today I am off on a safari to deepest darkest Alabama in search of
a '59 Westfalia.  Got a lead on it a little over a week ago and sent a
friend in Huntsville over to take a look at it for me.  Report came 
back that it looked good (almost totally rust free).  My friend got the
guy's phone number &amp; sent it to me.

I call the guy several times &amp; finally get in touch with him.  He says 
it is in good shape minus engine.  I ask questions to make sure it has 
the wood cabinets with brass trim &amp; the submarine hatch.  I ask him what 
he wants for it &amp; he comes back with a very reasonable price.  But 
there's a catch.

Someone else put down $50 for him to hold it.  DAMN!  Well last night I
decided I WANT THAT BUS!  Being a true believer in the old addage, 
&quot;money talks, bullshit walks&quot; I call the guy up &amp; tell him I get paid
tomorrow &amp; I want to come Friday, cash in hand, to buy the Westy.  He
says &quot;well it has been a couple of months.  Let me see if I can get
ahold of the guy&quot;.

Well he calls back late last night and explained the deal.  The other 
guy was supposed to pay him off when he got his tax refund.  He's 
already blown the money the money from his refund &amp; can't come up with
the money this weekend so it's mine if I want it.

So after lunch today I am heading off to Alabama &amp; if it's half as nice
as he says it is, I'll be pulling it home tonight.  So Joel, if you're
on 278 tonight &amp; see a chrome yellow '77 Westy pulling a dove blue '59
Westy, be sure to wave.  I promise I'll wave back.

Dave
