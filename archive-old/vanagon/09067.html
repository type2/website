Joel:

I still have had no luck getting one.  The people at the 1-800 number DO 
NOT handle owner's manual requests any longer.  They refer you to the 
dealer.  Jim Ellis, interestingly enough, showed no  interest in ordering 
one, but alledgedly put in my request for a &quot;search&quot; whatever that 
means.  Apparently one is now on their own as far as owner's manuals are 
concerned.--
