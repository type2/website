Subject: Super-technical question

Does anyone know what type of steel is used in the WB head studs? I'm 
looking for the Modulus of Elasticity specifically, or almost as good 
would be steel from another engine. 
Im guessing that it's the same kind as on air-cooled engines, so there 
might be a source to look up for that. If you know, I promise noone will 
call you a geek.
