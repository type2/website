&gt; Alan, how did you go about mounting those rain gutters? Any trouble with
&gt; those bolts rusting and causing a rust &quot;dribble&quot; down the fiberglass. I'm
&gt; thinking of dipping them in silicone before I put them in.
&gt;
&gt;HATE drilling holes where no holes exisited before....

I used over sized washers on the inside and I used short bolts.  Long bolts
will catch on the tent when you open the top.  I _did_ use silicone.  I
spread it outside, inside, and in the hole before putting the bolts in.  I
even spread a bead around the edge of the mounting plate before pressing it
to the fiberglass.

Alan
