Subject: Denver\Saw Tie Died\Costner(F)

Yesterday I described in fine detail the canceled trip to Denver. I also
mentioned:

&quot;The only bummer was that I failed to give a 48 hr notice prior to canceling
the rental vehicle w/o a penalty. It is actually cheaper for me to rent the
Explorer, drive it off the lot, flip a &quot;U-E&quot; and return it than it would be
to just call and cancel. Weird huh? Maybe I can give my wife a spin around
the block in it and try to get her to smile at least once this week.&quot;

Well, the rental guy was unexpectedly cool. I asked if I needed to
physically come to the rental lot, fill out the paper work drive off the lot
and check the car back in. I also asked if I could switch to the cheapest
car that they had instead of the Ford Explorer. He and I agreed that it
would be cheaper to do the offlot turna round than to eat the
$100_dot_cancelation hickey. He listened to my questions, put me on hold for a
second and then came back on the line and said &quot;Don't worry about it- I just
took you out of the computer.&quot; No charge! =) He could have been a total
&quot;whatever&quot; and hit me with a $100 charge. Thanks to Resort Rent a Car in
Phoenix. 

Instead of a trip around the block, I took my wife to see &quot;Tie Died.&quot;
Mediocre but fun. Not a total glorification of the deadys/dead scene but
pretty well balanced insight/slice of life. Production values were
appropriately low low tech. Definitely is not a Zillion dollar Kevin Costner
&quot;Waterworld.&quot; I couldn't imagine Costner sitting inside a bus with VW Deady
freaks trying to learn the word for &quot;Buffalo&quot;

Costner: &quot;Ta-tonka&quot;, 
Deady: &quot;No Kev it's a Westfalia.&quot;
Costner: &quot;Buff.&quot;
Deady: &quot;No Kev, 'Garcia'.&quot;
Costner: &quot;Buff.&quot;
Deady: &quot;No Kevin, it's a bong.&quot;
Costner: &quot;Buff.  &quot;Buff - a- low&quot;, 
Deady: &quot;No Kevin! It's a party bowl. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PASS IT!!!&quot;
Costner: &quot;Buffalo&quot;
Deady: &quot;Mr. Costner, I ask that you please leave my van now.&quot;
Costner: &quot;Ta-tonka&quot;
Deady: &quot;Hey Kev, did anyone give you any Kool-aid earlier today?&quot;
Costner: (Outside of the bus whirling in circles, chanting to drums)
          &quot;Ta&quot; , &quot;Ta-tonk&quot; , &quot;Ta-tonka&quot;,  &quot;Ta&quot; , &quot;Ta-tonk&quot; , &quot;Ta-tonka&quot;
Deady: &quot;Whoa, Kevs peakin already&quot;
Costner: &quot;Buff!&quot;
