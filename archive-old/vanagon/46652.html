Acutally the entire construction of the OEM Mann G60 filter
is different, the bleedback valve being high and central, you
can not &quot;prefill&quot; a G60 filter down the center hole, and if
you prefill it through the outer holes (possible) when installed
on the car there is a good chance the system locks and pumps NO
OIL, real real odd filter.  And it is much easier to remove via
the big nut.  Expensive though, but seems to keep the hydraulic
lifter noise at a minimum.

The VR6 filter is entirely odd evil beast.

And on the origional post, I think late Muir's say go ahead
with the Rabbit filter, a sure sign not to IMHO, though probably
no difference.
