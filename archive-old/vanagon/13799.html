&gt;Unfortunately I am a recent member and I don't believe I was included in this 
&gt;count.  I am in San Jose, CA and have a '64 Deluxe.  I would love to know some 
&gt;of the other people in the bay area who have split-windows.  Send me private e-
&gt;mail and maybe we can swap parts and info.

Hi All,

&gt;From what I've seen around Berkeley there are quite a few hiding out and
probably not counted.  I saw quite a few last Saturday in Arcata, CA.  Any
hackers with access to DMV records???

So is a '64 Deluxe with sunroof and all the oval windows?  I have a '64 with
just four windows on each side (last two with cargo rails).  I just moved to
Oakland/Berkeley area - and brought the Bus down 101 from Portland last
weekend. It's been sitting in Oregon for years.  Started right up and did
great down the coast - although a little wet (those front windows!!!) and a
bit cool.  The only problem was a side trip to some hot springs on a long
hilly road.  Second gear was getting hard to hit, and on the way back I lost
all gears.  The rubber coupling between the trans and the shift rod fell
apart.  I did the old hoseclamp 'X' repair while my girlfriend was wondering
if we should start hitch-hiking.

And Hi Aaron!  I'm in your area.
