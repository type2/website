It's spring and time to replace the front shocks on our 87 Wolfsburg
again.   I've determined through several shock changes that rev J
(251-413-031-J - for vans with lowered suspension) rides a lot better
than the standard one (rev F) on our van (lowered suspension).   I
believe one of the differences is that the rev J shock has more damping
on rebound.   Since they are also remarkable for being quite expensive,
does anyone know if there is an equivalent aftermarket shock, or an
aftermarket shock with adjustable rebound rate?
