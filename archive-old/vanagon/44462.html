Hi everyone,
Well this is just a short note to everyone to tell you that I will be 
unreachable at this email address as of the evening of monday the 
17th. I'm leaving Israel on Thursday morning and I am turning my 
computer over on Tuesday.
Of course the electronic line are still open to us but now at a 
different address. For the three weeks I am in England (Until July 
10th) I will be able to be reached at

After that I will be in the USA and you can all reach me at 
BKING_at_ESSLINK.COM
Well, thanks for all the mail and have a good summer.
Jay
