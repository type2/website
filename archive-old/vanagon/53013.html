Subject: 87 Westie: Overheat light comes on with midrange temp!

Greetings all:

Had a funny thing happen on the highway coming home from work last week,
and I've been afraid to drive the '87 Westie since.

It was about 15 degrees out. I was cruising along embracing my driving
experience because the engine temp had finally reached the point where I
was getting &quot;warm&quot; air out of the front heater vents. Suddenly, I notice
the overheat warning light blinking in the engine temp indicator. The
needle had not moved from its usual just-left-of-center point, but the
little red LED was blinking!

Remembering a story on the list from last summer where some poor EV
owner lost a hose and toasted his engine in about nothing flat with
similar symptoms, I immediately shut off the engine and coasted off the
highway. 

I got out and checked out the engine, fearing the worst. What I found
was: NOTHING. No low coolant (no low oil either, for that matter),
engine was not unusually warm, as far as I could tell, nothing out of
the ordinarly. I let it cool down for a while, started it back up, and
everything was fine--no light, nothing--for about another five minutes,
then the same thing happened again. 

At that point I was home, so I pulled into the garage and it's been
there since. 

Any ideas?

On an unrelated note: My Westie lists a bit to port. It's got 68K miles
on it. Does anyone know if this is a sign of bad
struts/shocks/whathaveyou? Or is it due to the extra weight on the left
side of the vehicle from the appliances and propane tank?

Thanks, 

Steve
