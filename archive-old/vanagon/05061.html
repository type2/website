Subject: Re: Coolant Change

I think it was about 3/8 in. clear cheapo tubing, but I ended up whittling 
it down a bit so I could screw it into the bleed hole. Try 5/16 maybee. Has 
anyone simply stuck a bleed valve back instead of the bolt, since this 
bleeding problem is repetitious? They usually will take a small bore hose 
directly. Life could be easier then(or if I owned an air-cooled)

NO, don't dump the coolant, DON'T!! At least get it to your favorite 
landfill site via the garbage collectors.


Plastic T's.... long discussion re those in rec.autos.tech, OK to use them 
for flushing, BUT don't leave them in place, they crumble/break up and dump 
all your coolant.
