Subject:        AC noise like PS PUMP!

Just had my AC Compressor replaced to fix the awful noise that occured
whenever it was turned on. Sounded just like a starving PS pump. Trouible
is, noise is still there and the hoses vibrate including the one that
runs through the drivers wheel well. Mechanics are scratching thier
heads. Any help gratefully appreciated.
