&gt;&gt;#4 - Also, a while back I asked about tinting Vanagon windows.  Well
&gt;&gt;I've done my research and am having it done this weekend.  I like
&gt;&gt;a survey for which is best way to go.
&gt;&gt;I've seen lots a vans with windows tinted but two ways really (I
&gt;&gt;think) look good:
&gt;&gt;a. a darker tint (75% grey) all windows except driver side and
&gt;&gt;   passenger side.  i.e. everything behind doors.
&gt;&gt;b. a medium tint  (60% grey) all windows.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have a second question: Is there more than one tinting process?  I've
&gt;seen some really bad looking jobs that appear to be stick-on and full of
&gt;air bubbles.  Personally I'd rather wear shades.

I had my windows done by a professional window tinter summer 93.  Anyone
who knows Texas summers knows how unbearably hot it can get in that
greenhouse on wheels...
For $189 (or thereabouts) he tinted the side and back windows very
dark grey, and the driver and front pax side windows a medium tint,
whatever max is allowed by law here (and the cops apparently do check).
Tint came with a five year warranty against peeling, bubbling, turning 
purple or yellow or any other disgusting colour.  I'm quite happy with
the job...the van is much cooler during the hot months and the a/c
doesn't seem to struggle as much (a godsend when you're wearing your
Sunday best and it's 105 outside and about 8000F inside), you can't
look in from the outside either (my wife likes that), and it looks cool
to boot.

That's my 18900 cents' worth.
