However, I'd be very interested in the shifter assembly from the '59.
That'd be everything from the shift lever back to the rod that
connects to the nose cone on the tranny.

If someone knows for sure that the shifter assembly from a single cab
won't work in a kombi, please let me know.

the shift linkage under the bus is the same on trucks, kombis, etc.   i
believe actually it is the same part on all post barndoor buses with the
shifter closer to the seat.    there are two parts to that shift linkage.
  (sorry, i don't have it.  i sent my extra to Tom Bennett who's selling his
barndoor candy van)
