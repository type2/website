well, you get ol' Forrest to suck on one of the brake bleeder valves ...

seriously, all you do is bleed ALL of the old fluid out, until all you
can see is new, clear fluid in all of the reservoir AND new clear fluid
coming out of each wheel bleeder valve AND the clutch slave cylinder bleeder
valve. at this point, your system has about as much of the old fluid out as
possible. naturally, somebody has to sit in the driver's seat and slowly
add fluid as the process continues (or do as i do, crawl under, bleed, crawl
out, refill, crawl under, bleed, ... etc.)

&gt;the usual coin...   With song praising and extolling your virtues,

yeah, yeah. where's the money!? :)
