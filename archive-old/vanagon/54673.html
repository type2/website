Subject: wheel bearings for '82 diesel westy


Thanks to all listmembers who helped me out with tips on where to
order, what to order, and even offered to add the parts to their own order
so I did not even have to do the phone tag with parts places (thanks Ron)..

Many of you also helped with tips on how to remove the old wheel
bearings (especially the races that looked impossibly stuck to the
inside of the rotor) (... Thanks, Eric).

I finally got the races out of the rotor last night (man, were they
stuck).

....now waiting for the parts....


Thanks again folks....
