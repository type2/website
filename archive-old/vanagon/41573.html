I think the idea is to turn the distributor rotor 90 degrees, which would be
the same as turning the crankshaft 180.  Whichever is easier for you to see
or work with.  And either way, the exact amount isn't critical so you don't
have to spend a lot of time or use special instruments.  You just want the
lifter to be on the circular part of the lobe, which is a good sized portion
of the lobe.  I use the rotor method myself, 'cause that way there's no
mistaking which cylinder is in the firing position.  (Just follow the wire
the rotor is pointing to.)
