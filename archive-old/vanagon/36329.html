Subject: Re: split window price?

Well, I am new to this but...
1965
split window
originally from Germany
asking $2800
interior gone
no rag roof
no windows on roof
no corner windows in back
13 or 15 window I think
bench front seat (not walk trough)
Southern California

I think that means Kombi, right?

It seems like $2000 is more appropriate, but this bus is really rust free.

Thanks,
Brian.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What is  a reasonable price to pay for a '65 split window, good body
&gt;&gt; condition - no rust, no interior, good rebuilt motor?
&gt;
&gt;What model?  Panel? Kombi? Standard? Deluxe? Ambulance? SIngle Cab? Double
&gt;Cab? Wide Body Single cab? Fire Bus?
&gt;
&gt;The model makes a big difference.
&gt;
&gt;Where are you?  Location is important, too.  Rust free kombi's in California
&gt;are a dime a dozen.  In Minnesota they're unheard of.  
&gt;
&gt;Deluxe's and standard's get a premium.  Panels go up or down.  An ambulance
&gt;would be _the_ticket_!
