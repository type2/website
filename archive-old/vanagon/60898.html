Subject: any recommendations on remanuf. trannys?

Dear Vanagon buddies,
It looks like time to make another tough decision.  I got the air out of
the cooling system so that's all set so I thought the kids could take off
on their cross country trip.  BUT!!,   a whining noise is indicating the
possibility of damaged bearings in the transmission.  I guess I'm looking
for opinions if a remanufactured transmission installation is a worthwhile
thing to do.  The local Bosch shop says it would go about $2000 - $2500 ,
with labor, depending on the clutch (and if he can get a transmission).

Anyone had any good or bad luck with this kind of work?  I spent about $2k
on new heads last year so I'm also wondering if it's going to become a $2k
a year type of vehicle from this point on.

Again, thanks in advance for all the great advice.
