John,

First, let me put in a &quot;reserve&quot; on one Westie's worth of that fabric.
While it isn't exactly right for my car, it is much better than what I have.

Second, remeber the story about the &quot;missing&quot; front axle?  Might this be a
bargaining tactic on the part of the Trim Shop?

Let me know how much to send and where, and I will have a check off to you
soonest.
