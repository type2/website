&gt;So check your oil cap, and if it's okay, maybe it's your PCV or somthing.

According to the Automotion catalogue Porsche 914s won't idle at all well if 
any air is getting into the case, and replacing various O-rings/gaskets  on 
oil fillers is advised. Sounds the same, since the engines are emarkably 
similiar to those in our humble pancake busses.


&gt;Kind of a long story just for that but I was reliving it and couldn't stop.
&gt;
&gt;:)
 Good thing you spotted the cap before you torched the attendant with his 
own hose!  Maybe not, omeone else is going to have to do it now. tim s.
