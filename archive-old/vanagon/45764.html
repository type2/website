Subject: Re: Do dealers know how to work on EVs

Just yesterday at the VW Dealer:  I walk up and say I need some parts for 
my EV.  The parts guy says, &quot;what's a Eurovan?&quot;  Someone in the back has to 
tell him it's a VW. :(

At that point I knew I was not going to have a positive VW experience...

The guy couldn't find half the parts I wanted on the fiche and had to 
order some guesses just to see if they match.

Oh well.  On a positive note I stopped by another local VW dealer and he 
said they're supposed to get some new EV's in September.  Then again he 
had no idea how they might be equipped and no literature.

Not holding my breath for a new EV.
