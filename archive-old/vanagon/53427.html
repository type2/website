Subject: H2O crossover pipe corrosion

got my pump off this weekend.  my crossover pipes sure have a lot of rust
happening inside -- concerns me.  hate to have one fail on a road trip.

what's the corporate memory on crossover pipes?

recall discussions here saying they're not available from VW anymore and
nigh on impossible to find.  so what's the solution?

thanks much,
dwight
