Subject: Re: Air Compressors ... (!)



About Stuart's air compressor support.
I second that motion... I've got one and when it comes in handy,
It really comes in handy!
Mines been with the van for about 7 years, it's used a lot, and it's 
still going strong...
For $20, that's pretty good.


Cheers
