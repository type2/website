Subject: Re: Ciao for now and European rentals

&gt; 
&gt; I'm off to Stuttgart this PM to spend 20 days in a new Eurovan Westy.
&gt; Probably hit Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, some of Poland, Slowakia and Cz Rep,
&gt; then back to Stuttgart.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, for those who are interested in a not-too-expensive European
&gt; vacation, the rental rate for a Westy is DM 2740 for 20 days if you rent in
&gt; the mid-season. At present rates, about US$ 100/day. The type of season
&gt; depends on the province and its school vacation dates (vacation = high
&gt; season). For some strange reason Baden--Wuertemburg doesn't start its
&gt; school vacation until 26 July.
&gt; 
&gt; These rates are inclusive; you pay diesel fuel, and in the case of an
&gt; accident that's your fault, the first DM 1000. That's all. (That's enough).
&gt; 
&gt; The way to get the best rates is to deal directly with the firm in Germany:
&gt; 
&gt;         Deutsche Reisemobil
&gt;         22850 Hamburg-Norderstedt
&gt;         Segeberger Chaussee 3
&gt;         Fax: (49) 40-52-48-66-8
&gt;         Tel: (49) 40-52-01-84-71
&gt; 
&gt; Fax is best, because then there are no language problems (there's always
&gt; someone who speaks English). Yes I realize the tel. #s are unequal in
&gt; length.
&gt; 
&gt; Pick-up points are Hamburg, Berlin, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and
&gt; Munich.
&gt; 
&gt; No I don't work for them; this will be my second rental, though. Worked
&gt; fine last time.

$100 a days sound a bit expensive. Although hotels, transportation, etc may add up, you still
have to pay those expensive camping fees. Have you ever considered buying a van and then selling
it when you leave? I heard someone did that before and It worked quite well for them. I wonder
what you do if you can't sell it by the time it's time to go though. Hey maybe we should all (this list) chip in and buy a van and leave it in Europe, then anybody who belongs to the list (CLUB), can
take it for a spin while in Europe. It's just an idea!
