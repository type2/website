some of the electrical advice/commentary i've been hearing in
this group bothers me somewhat. sigh... lets talk a little about alternators
for instance. there is no electrical device that can decrease your engine's
output/horsepower while drawing power
from a stock bosch alternator and/or your vehicles battery. the 
only energy loss which comes from the alternator is from friction 
in the bearings and from the change in angular momentum which occurs when the
rotating mass inside the alternator is forced to change rpm. the losses as a
result of driving the alternator can 
be assumed as approximately constant and proportional to 
engine rpm. the change in magnetic strength in your alternator
does not dissipate horsepower from the engine or produce 
signifigant additional &quot;drag&quot; as some seem to believe. it is 
important to understand how a bosch alternator functions in 
order to further explain.

1. how alternator's work.
an alternator is based on the principal of electromagnetic 
induction. when an electrical cunductor &quot;cuts&quot; the lines of 
force in a magnetic field, a potential (e.m.f.) is &quot;induced&quot;
in the conductor. (translation when you push a wire through
a magnetic field, current is forced through it) the amount of
current is primarily dependant upon two things: the strength 
of the magnetic field and how quickly the conductor passes 
through it. any ee's out there in nettiqua can jump in and help
at any time...:) it is obvious that there are practical limitations 
to both of these items; especially since the speed at which the conductor
passes through the magnetic field is proportional to 
engine rpm which is not always constant. this is where the 
voltage regulator comes into play. it varies the strength of the magnetic
field in order to achieve a more stable output.

2. how a bosch alternator works:
in a bosch alternator the wire (stator) is stationary and the 
magnetic field (rotor) turns. first, you turn the ignition key and 
current is allowed to energize the magnetic field inside the 
alternator. as the engine is starting and the rpm is increasing,
the voltage regulator is varying the amount of magnetic energy 
to help stabilize the alternator's output. at lower rpm's the 
voltage regulator (vr) allows the magnetic field to be full strength, while
at higher rpm's the vr cuts the magnetic strength. the vr is 
alternately increasing and decreasing the strength of the 
magnetic field hundreds of times each second, thus a stable
output is achieved. the vr also knows when you are using lots of
power for your electrical accesories and compensates for this by increasing
the strength of the magnetic field.

now back to the point. the mechanical energy consumed by the rotation of the
alternator does not increase as electrical output increases. your engine
cannot tell if the alt is outputting 20 amps or
55 amps. now for those of you theorists who are waiting to drop the
&quot;increased resistance to rotation as a result of induction&quot; bomb,
this effect would be similar to lightly rubbing your finger against the fan
pully and would definately not be measured in horsepower;
inch-ounces perhaps :)

this group has really changed, tho i'm not yet sure for better or worse,
since i was forced to sign off a little over 18 months ago.
my appologies to joel for not reintroducing myself sooner. joel i 
owe you a big one, that info you sent me was great and i hope i 
can receive more from you again in the future. to those of you who don't
remember me from the old group, i can sound a bit abrasive;
i intend no insult or injury to anyone i love this group and all in it! 
so if i irk some of you now and then, here is my appology in advance.
hope it's not too late after having babbled on in this post.

i plan on doing some posts in the near future about batteries and
multiple battery set-ups, as there seems to be a lot of confusion 
in this area also. anybody wanna talk generators?? i'm hoping to stir 
up enough emotion so some of you others will contribute a few of your
electrical secrets. it takes way too long for me to try all of this stuff
myself, although i do enjoy it so.
