&gt; was impressed by how good those guys were, since the bay windows are
&gt; easy to break.  Total cost $60 - I used my old seal which was in reasonable

I'm impressed too, it's incredibly easy to break a bay window,
especially when trying to save the old seal, in general cut the
thing out you need a new seal anyway 10 to 1.  By all means go for
a junker but remember it may be in worse than your old one as far as
scratches, haze, and the outside edges have a tendency to delaminate
and fog.  The scrathces can be polished out but the delamination
will continue.  Look into local auto glass shops, the replacement may be
available suprisingly enough and might be OK priced.
