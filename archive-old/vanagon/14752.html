Yo,

	Sunday I headed out to the junkyards in search of a piece of metal to
use to section in the are on the right side of my motor.

	On the way out, I'm thinking &quot;Hmm, when was the last time I got gas?
Maybe I better get some...&quot;  I put in 10.5 Gallons!  Sheesh!  Exactly what
is my fuel capacity, anyway?  ('56 bus)

	Then on to the junkyard!  Nothing special at Pick'N'Pull, except that
once again, ALL of the VW engines are gone, lock stock and barrel!  There
has got to be a conspiracy going on here...

	At Pull'N'Save, I found a '64 that I could get the piece out of, but
some idiot left the engine in the bus!  D'oh!  I did manage to get
the piece out,but it was interesting...

	There was also a bay window camper, with a very tall fiberglass
roof, and it had a sink with a stainless steel water tank.

	My friend even found a '67 datsun roadster to get some goddies off
of, and my SO found a '78 BMW '530i and scored a glovebox latch!  A good
time was had by all.  (BTW - Everyone I know of is shocked when they
hear that Amy goes to the junkyards with me and helps me wrench on the 
bus!)

	I also have more data points on the &quot;who waves when driving&quot; scientific
study:

	I was driving my SO's BMW, and I waved at a couple of other people in
similar cars, and I either got ignored or looked at like I was Charles
Manson's Evil Separated at birth Siamese twin.  And when I waved at a guy
in a bus while driving the BMW, I got a &quot;go stick it in yer : , you yuppie
scum&quot; look.  Sheesh!  The only ones that wave consistent;y are the early
bus guys and girls.  A couple haven't, which makes me think they are up
to no good, like stealing bus parts.  Somethimes I'll geta wave from
breadloafs, and rarely from a vanagon.   NEVER, evr have I gotton a wave 
from an EV, and a see 2 or 3 a day.
	
Thom
