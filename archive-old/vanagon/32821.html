#Okay, that's the most frequent maintenance you'll need to do.  Oh!
#I didn't tell you that the tune-up for VW is also every 3K miles?
#Oops!  Well, that's right, you've got to change the spark plugs,
#points, condensor, rotor and cap every 3K also.  The exceptions
#to this rule are as follows:

#  If you have Bosch Platinum spark plugs you can wait till 15K
#  miles, but you should inspect them at 7.5K miles.

Apologies for the late reply, but I have a couple questions to put to 
the collective net wisdom.  

1)	3000 miles on Bosch copper plugs (is that all?)?

2)	3000 miles on points/condensor/cap n' rotor?

3)	Bosch Platinums:  what is the proper heat rating #, for winter 
	vs. summer weather?  Is there any potential problem with the 
	Platinums running too hot?

These questions are a little brushing-up on my part after 9 years of 
air-cooled VW ownership &amp; maintenance.  Specs:  rebuilt 1600DP (AE case w/ 
rebuilt heads), 009, 34-pict-3, city/mountain/desert driving, about 
17,000 miles on the motor.  

Thanks!
