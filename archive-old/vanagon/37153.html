Subject: Brazing: a welding alternative?

Since I'm economically challenged/impaired, would brazing be a good 
alternative to welding when attaching body panels? I can imagine that 
the different qualities of the metals would make seams more apt to 
disconnect...but for some reason, I'm thinking one can braze with little 
more than an inexpensive propane torch kit and brazing rods.

BTW, I'm not looking for *perfection*. I just enough enough *connection* 
for bus *ressurection*.

Thanks!
Joe (graduate of Jesse Jackson speech writer's academy ;)

P.S. THANKS to whoever it was who brought up the spray that attacks 
rust. I now have what seems to be a good solution to the underside 
surface rust on the bus. It'll require some time, but maybe I can save 
this bus from rusting into oblivion.
