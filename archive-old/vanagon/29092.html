&gt;In JC Whitney catalog #582C, page 22, bottom right corner, it lists:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;APPLICATION                PART NO.     PRICE ea.
&gt;
&gt;80-83 Vanagon (liftgate)   12NG0858X    $19.99
&gt;84-93 Vanagon (liftgate)   12NG0859N    $19.99
&gt;
&gt;Shipping for two is $8 to $11 depending on where you are.
&gt;Witney's number is 312-431-6102.

This is odd, I've always had to specify &quot;with or without rear window wiper&quot;
when buying these.  It seem that the added weight makes a difference.  I
wonder which these are for?
