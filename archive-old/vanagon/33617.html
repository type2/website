A bus friend of mine came over last night and we looked at 
The bus, trying to lay out a plan of action.  He is going to
be the proud father of a '55 barndoor panel in a couple weeks,
so he's very interested in how the bodywork on my bus goes...

What I'm going to do instead is weld steel bars to the bottoms of
the I beams, with the car at rest, and then when I left it up, I will
use the bar for additional support.  Then I will cut the longitudinals
out, 1 at a time, and weld the new ones in.  I'll do each side
completely before going to the other.  

Once I have the longitudinals in, then I can pull the floor up 
and do the cross members.

Once I have the cross members in, I can do the inner rockers.  Then I can
put the new floor in, and I'll have an ugly bus, but one with a 
solid floor and sub-structure, which I could even drive if I had the 
hankerin'

The guy I bought the bus from has done similar operation many
times, and sez he has pictures, but I'm still trying to pry them
out of his fingers...

I would really like to have the floor done by mid-summer or so.

First I'm going to upgrade my compressor and welder.  I'm going to
go to a 5hp+ 220v compressor, and get the gas setup for my MIG welder.
Any recommendations on gas mixtures?  I was thing 75/25 C02/argon or
something in that realm...
