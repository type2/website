Subject:      Taking a Break

I'm going to step out of the machine room for a few hours ... I've
actually got to get some real work done! Besides my ears can't take any
more of the noise. Gerry, sits in our main supercomputer 'machine' room
with every other computer you could ever imagine, much less pay for ...
Crays, Paragons, SGI's, Routers, Tape Libraries, etc. etc. Although, the
power to the room is filtered and the room is air conditioned (my main
reasons for housing him here), all this hardware generates ear-deafening
sound.

Will be back on-line later.

Chris
