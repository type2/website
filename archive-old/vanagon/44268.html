&gt;Subject: Re: CB placement

&gt;&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.
&gt;

        In my 78 westy, I have a CB mounted under the dash on the pax side,
it seems good there. As a Ham, I have also mounted a dual-band amateur radio
on the dash just below the am/fm radio. As the Ham radio splits apart, the
&quot;guts&quot; are mounted under the dash and the controls/face on a homemade
bracket. This bracket was made of stainless (mocked up with card stock) The
only mounting was under the screws that hold the clips that hold the small
table in between the seats. This bracket also holds both mics, one on each
side. I can remove it all and the dash would look original.
        As for antennas... At first I had a mag mount on the top of the
bracket that holds the pop-up down. I have since (about a year ago) made a
small box (about 2&quot; by 3&quot;) with an odd shape to fit the body contours just
aft of both engine air scoops and just below the rain gutter. This brackets
were welded on in at a friends body shop (other body work was also done) and
the van painted (bright Green). The antennas mount in baskets for the
boating industry. I can drop the antennas to the length of the van and still
get into underground parking.
