&gt;The tent that came with my bus attaches to the sides of the body at the
&gt;rear door, it's roof being supported by the opened hatch. The question is
&gt;- what good is it?
&gt;It's only an extension, approx 4-5 feet long and, of course, the width of
&gt;the bus.  Is this a gear stowage area, or a place to work on the engine
&gt;if it's raining. :-)
&gt;It's nicely made, has NO floor and has 2 pole-holes toward the rear edges of
&gt;what would be the open hatch, allowing the closure of the door
&gt;presumably. The tent is reinforced where the wiper contacts it.
&gt;So, what the HECK is it??

i think that's one of those extend-the-foot-area-for sleeping covers ...
there's supposed to be a platform that extends from the bus, outside but
within the &quot;tent&quot;, and that's where you put your legs when sleeping.
but it sounds like you are missing the platform. :(
