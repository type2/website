Subject:      Re: Muffler report-out in the back yard broken!

Not so long ago, I also got one of these mufflers through bus boys.  It
worked great, more power, a bit louder, all as stated.  It was great...for
about three months.

Then it broke its mounting tab(integral with the muffler) causing a hole,
and more noise.  I devised an outer clamp to replace the original, but by
then it had broken at the flange.  I had it welded, then the alternate
clamp broke, this causing stress on the head pipe to the number three
cylinder, which then fractured.

My aftermarket muffler excursion was ended by Kyle at volkscafe with
replacement muffler and pipes.

Although all my other vehicles have aftermarket exhausts which are reliable
and provide improved efficientcy, I'd advise others to avoid this grief on
their vanagons.

With less power(but more reliability)

&gt;I recently purchased a Turbo Muffler from S &amp; S (602-847-9000).
&gt;
&gt;S&amp;S manufacturers a top quality Turbo Muffler and tail pipe combination
&gt;for Vanagons.  I put one on my 1984 H20Boxer and, while slightly more
&gt;noise, gas milage improved by at least 1.5mpgh.  Better yet, the total
&gt;cost is less than the replacement anywhere!!
&gt;
&gt;They also make headers that are high quality and reasonably priced, much
&gt;cheaper than replacing all of the broken Volks header pipes.  Allows for
&gt;converter to.
&gt;If you call mention Davidb and you'll get a discount.
