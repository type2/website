Subject: Trade Kadron DP manis for SP manis


I have a pair of Kadron aftermarket carbs for 1600 Dual-port air-cooled VW 
engine. But my
bus has a strong-running single-port engine!

I'd like to buy a (used) pair of manifolds for a single-port engine. Anybody 
out there have some
they want to get rid of?
