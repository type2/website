&gt;I had the same problem in my '70, and it turned out to be a bad 
&gt;starter-battery cable--the cable had corroded out from within the plastic 
&gt;sheath, thus invisible.  Replaced it as well as both ground straps.  
&gt;Archetypal old-guy mechanic told me the headlights &quot;heated up&quot; the wires, 
&gt;allowing for greater conceptual continuity.  (OK, I made that last part 
&gt;up, but it did fix it)  

I already replaced both the + and - cables.  However, the cable that
goes up to the front is a little shaky looking.  Bit more of a job to
replace though :(

I wonder if this cable being putzoid would have anything to do with the
previous problem, whereby the bus would cut out when I turned the
headlights on, _or_ I would be driving along and everything would just
die...
