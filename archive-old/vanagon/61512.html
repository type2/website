Subject: Next Camping Trip: 7/25-7/27

The next camping trip will be to the Los Padres National Forest, in the
vicinity of King City, California, or an hour south of Monterey.  The trip
will run from July 25th through the 27th.

To get there take 101 South from San Jose, or North from Los Angeles.
Driving south, get off the highway at Soledad, and take Arroyo Seco Road
west up into the mountains.  Driving North, get off at Greenfield and take
Elm Ave west until it hits Arroyo Seco Road, then continue west.

The road enters Arroyo Seco State Park, and then quickly becomes a dirt
mountain track.

Drive up the dirt track about 8 miles or so, until it stops climbing.  Get
out occasionally, enjoy the view, and let your bus cool.  Eventually the
road starts dropping again, through some switchbacks.  You'll soon come to
the Escondido campground on your left.  (It's the ONLY campground.)  That's
where we'll be camping.

Take your bathing suit, because the North Fork of Arroyo Seco flows through
a rock canyon here, offering wonderfully cool swimming and diving, with
warm granite to lie on and bake, or shade trees to sit under if you're too
warm.

The campground features pit toilets and a water spigot, but little else.
There are hiking trails right off the campground.

The Saturday night culinary theme, as decided during the Fremont Peak feed,
will be &quot;International&quot;, with an emphasis on your OWN culinary roots.
