Subject: should I Buy a '73 for parts?


Hi all: I just got a tip on a cheep '73.  I called the owner and he 
dosn't think that there are any real problems with it accept for a gassy 
smell in the engine compartment and some collision damage to the nose. I 
have a '72 and it sure would be nice to have a spair engine and trans 
sitting around for when the need arises.  Not to mension a good set of 
tires (mine are dead), and a bunch of other parts.  Does any one know 
what will and won't be compatible?  I know the rear brakes wont but with 
that '74 axle beam up front all the front brakes and suspension should 
right? Probably along with the engine lid and lights.  What about the 
windshield and sliding doors?  If it helps any, my bus was made in 4-72 
and I think this one has the low turn signals.  Basically, I need to 
justify spending money I don't have.  The guy is asking $450 but there is 
always the haggle factor.  BTW, he seemed to be pretty insistant about 
the thing being a parts bus although supposidly it drives fine and only 
has the afformentioned problems.  Well see.  O, he also said he put on a 
new set of webber carbs a couple of years ago and the bus only has a 
total of 60,000 miles.  something could be a little fishy.  lemme know 
what you think.
thanks.
ED.
