 Not only don't I have a thermostat, the heat risers (tubes

Anyway, here's the questions in my mind:  

So it will reduce the life of the engine... How Much?  Will I only get 
100K instead of 150K miles?

Living in N. Florida, am I not STILL better of that somebody in Minnesota 
that HAS a thermostat?

Being the rookie wish-I-was-a-good-vw-mechanic, I probably have other 
factors that will shorten my engine life more than the lack of a 
thermostat, don't I?

Putting in a thermostat is an engine-out job, isn't it?

How many of you would put one in at this point?

um-  When first took I motor out and apart I didn't know what a thermostat
was.  Mine didn't have one.  I had already driven my 59 around for three
years, including a cross country and back expedition,  before it needed work,
just a valve job and new rings, and the compression was  1-120, 2-125, 3-105,
4-125   when I got it.   So I think I did ok.   How much better it would have
been, I don't know.   I always let it idle a while esp on cold mornings,
before I drove away.

    So, no thermostat is not imminent disaster.  Neither is bad rubber seals
in the engine compartment.   It all just adds up.   A friends has the 25th
edition of the idiot book, i read with interest the added sections in the
back.  Though not into hot rodding, I read the fat motor chapter and liked
it.   They also say thermostat - GOOD,  power pulley -  BAD.   Also added in
the back was the mention of brake hoses,   the old ones never did,   which
would have helped me.

But - collect the parts and when you need to pull the motor for clutch work
or new oil seals put it together. Or in your copious free time...
