&gt; These are excellent tires for vanagons but do not last as long as those
&gt; original Michelin reinforced tires came with the car. The original tires
&gt; lasted nearly 60k miles. The XZX has less than 40k so far but I can see

Ok Ok these are the same &quot;mystery&quot; Sears tires that I got for about
$60 bucks each. 

I think the catch that these are NOT 185/75SR14

and hence are not speed rated. 

I don't know why you'd need speed rating on vanagon tires anyway,
certainly not for the speed.
