Subject: Wanted 71 Camper Red

 Looking for '71 vw camper.
 My old daily driver has been stored outside for several years, and has
 turned into a rust bucket. I want to restore &quot;Urge&quot; but am afraid it is a
 lost cause. :-( Looking for a replacement that is in good shape. I have a
 kinda nice interior and almost new side tent to go with another bus. Any
 info on an available bus like this would be appreciated. E-mail Doc Ric_at_
 aol_dot_com
 Thanks,
 Ric
