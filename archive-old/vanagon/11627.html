Subject: Eurovan wheels on a Vanagon

Don't know, I'll sure give it a try (when it's warm enough to do the 
experiment :-) 

Of course, while the EV wheels are on the Vanagon, the EV will have to 
stand on the Vanagon wheels -- I can imagine Ric Cringing at the thought...

&gt;   I've been told that 15&quot; eurovan wheels will fit on vanagons. Is this true?
&gt;   Could be a way to gain a bit of ground clearance, lower final drive ratio,
&gt;   or fit low profile tires for that hwy cruiser look.
