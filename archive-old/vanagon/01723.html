&gt;	I too am suffering from the blinking coolant light on my '85
&gt;vanagon.  I'm sure that bleeding the system would probably solve the
&gt;problem.  Don't ask me why, I just think so.  Anyway..people keep writing
&gt;to bleed according to Bentley.  What are you guys talking about??  I've
&gt;read over section 19 about ten times now, and the only mention I see of

yup. that's it. it's the little section on 19.16, under fig.5 'cooling
system, filling'. the only thing i've done differently is to add the coolant
to the expansion tank back up to MAX level when i'm done. except that i
don't open the engine bleeder valve, just the radiator one. hmmmm. but it
works. and yes, i jack up the front end, and yes the engine is running.
i try to make sure the coolant is warm (needle moved up on the gauge) ...
just seems like it ought to be 'better' if the thermostat is open. (no, i
don't know why i think that).

them's my opinions. :)
