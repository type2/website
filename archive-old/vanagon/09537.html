&gt; The Twentynine Palms area is quite doable from Tucson, maybe even a little
&gt; further north...  Anybody know anything about Providence Mountains State
&gt; Recreation area (off I-40 between Barstow and the AZ border)?
&gt; 
That's pretty desolate country -- I haven't been north of I-40 along
that stretch, but I've been to Amboy, which is south of I-40 between
Ludlow and Twentynine Palms. Nice volcano!

How about an AZ/NM bus trip to the Chiricahuas?
