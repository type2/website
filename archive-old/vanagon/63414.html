&gt;There is a small hole beneath the battery in my 91', I was going to run a
&gt;tube into it.  This possible since the stamped sheetmetal panel has a large
&gt;depression where the tube would normally be crushed by the battery's
&gt;weight.  Alternatively I've, not REALLY looked behind some of the
&gt;structural gusseting in the batter compartment, so there could be one
&gt;hiding.  Finally, if I get to the job of venting my battery and I decide
&gt;the hole is a drain, I'll just drill one, watching out of course for all of
&gt;the subfloor obstacles.  Oh yeah, I'll try to locate the hole so it doen't
&gt;land to close the box frame.  Nasty spot for a corrosion experiment!

Mark,

Thanks, this did the trick for me!
