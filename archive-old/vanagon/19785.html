Subject: Re: Philly Area VW Gathering?

Pete Sellers says:
&gt;Seems like we have the makings of an impromptu meeting in the Philly area this 
&gt;weekend.
&gt;
&gt;Any more willing participants?
&gt;
&gt;I have a campground book but any other ideas?
&gt;
and Ric says:
&gt;Howabout Saturday nite for pizza somewhere?
&gt;
&gt;We will be staying at the Best Western Hotel Philadelphia - Northeast
&gt;aparently near the Northeast Philly Airport on Rt. 1...
&gt;Howabout meeting at the Franklin Mills Mall?

Camping sounds great to me (haven't gotten out much in the camper yet). But
I can make other arrangements if camping isn't in the cards.

I can make it for pizza, too. The Franklin Mills mall sounds good.
Let me know the time and store!

Any other takers out there?
