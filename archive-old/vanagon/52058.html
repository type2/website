Subject: Re: throttle switch &amp; heater cable

&gt;| And, I complained about the low heat output, and they declared the heater 
&gt;| temperature cable to be bent/kinked/whatever.  I am doubtful.  Has anyone 
&gt;| experienced this problem?  The van passed their pressure test of the 
&gt;| cooling system, no leaks, despite the sweetish odor from the rear heater.

	To get the heater core out, I pulled the cover off after removing the
board in front pipes for the rear seat (I remember people saying you have to
pull the whole seat out, but using a screwdriver to get the cover over the lip
of sound cork on the floor, I found the cover had just enough clearance
between the seat tubing and the outlet to come off), undid the two screws on
the side of the heater core, and slid the core out. I found a bunch of crust
on the back and underside of the core which I had not seen when looking into
air outlet... Pulling the outlet portion of the assembly off, I found more
scaling on the floor of the assembly. The whole job took about 15 minutes to
pull the thing off (excluding the 15 minutes I sat wondering if I could get
the cover off without removing the whole seat... I'm kinda lazy...).
