Subject:        Brakes

     Now I've got a question.

     I've noticed a tendency for the '91 to develop what I'll call soft
     brakes after a few moderate-to-heavy applications.  On some occasions,
     I even seem to be hitting the metallic-sounding stop on the brake
     pedal, if you know what I mean.  Pumping kinda helps, but not as much
     as one might expect from experience with other cars.

     I am somewhat suspicious that someone some time may have put DOT3
     brake fluid in instead of DOT 4, so I plan on going to the mess and
     trouble to flush the system.

     Sound like anything that's happened to anyone else?

     Also, I'd kinda like to get that sales pitch from a couple weeks ago
     about master cylinders w/boosters for $100; still available?  Off to
     check the archives!
