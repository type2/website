It's that stirring sound of air-cooled power roaring away in the back that 
makes you *think* you're going 20mph faster than you actually are :-) Hmmm, 
perhaps this explains why all the other traffic seems to blast past at 20mph 
faster than I'm going. The simple way to adjust is to set off five minutes 
early :-)
