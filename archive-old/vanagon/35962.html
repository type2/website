&gt;  Wow! That sounds much, much better. Those auto-stop valves do have
&gt;an awful reputation, that's for sure- I wonder why VW continued to use
&gt;the stupid things, anyway... BTW, the fridge in my '85 can run on
&gt;battery power as well, but it doesn't seem to get very cold like that-
&gt;is there any way to get it to work better, or should I be running it off of
&gt;the
&gt;battery at all (it seems to work fine when I 'plug' the van in)? Oh
&gt;yeah, and how long can you run your fridge on a tank of propane (the
&gt;tank looks pretty small)?

Fidge is wired to only run on the batery when the alternator is charging.  A
second battery will only run the fridge for a few hours.  Depending on how
you use the stove, that little propane should run the fridge for 10 to 14
days.  Especially if you use 12 volt power while driving.
