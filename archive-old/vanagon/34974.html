&gt; When I was shopping for CV boots, I asked for German - this FLforeignAPS guy
&gt; said &quot;these are Brazilian.  They don't make 'em in Germany anymore&quot;.  Suuure
&gt; they don't!  He also tried to sell me 8mm star bolts after I asked for 6mm
&gt; 6-point allen bolts - &quot;All VW busses use these&quot;.. Yeah, right, bye now!

I know the feeling.  I was in Checker last week for a news battery for 
the van.  I asked the FLAPG for a 10mm for the post clamp.  When he 
couldn't find one he asked someone else what size they thought it was and 
when they said a 12, tried to foist it off on me.

It'd be nice if some people had some kids that lived...
