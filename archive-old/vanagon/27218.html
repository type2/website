I'm trying to figure out what engine is in my '58 microbus, so I can
order appropriate replacement bits for it.  Glancing through the
archives didn't really help, since none of the numbers I found on the
engine match any of the patterns listed.  This strikes me as a little
surprising, since I have yet to see a bus with its original engine --
this has to be a common problem.

In any case, what appears to be the engine serial number, from just
below where the generator stand bolts on, is stamped as AB 004302.
What I believe to be the crankcase part number, which is on the right
side (front is front) near the bottom (down is down), is cast in as:

            AS41
    15 (VW) 211 101 102 D

where (VW) is the V-above-W-in-a-circle logo.

Any help will be appreciated.
