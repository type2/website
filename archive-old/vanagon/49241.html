Subject: 85 Windshield Wiper Shaft
Date: Sun, 08 Sep 1996 18:11:26 GMT

The wiper shaft on the passenger side of my 85 Vanagon GL sheared off
a week or so ago. Talked with my local VW guru and he wasn't really
sure how to go about fixing this on a Vanagon (he is really a bug
sort). So... I grabbed my Bentley and went out to the Van today
planning on pulling the critter to get him to obtain the proper stuff
so I can fix it.

After taking the glove box loose so I could see under the dash, I saw
much to my dismay that it looks as if I will have to dissemble my dash
and heater to get the thing out.

Please, does anyone know of a way to remove the shaft without
requiring the removal of the dash? Help!!!

TIA,
Doug
