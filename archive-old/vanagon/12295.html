&gt;	2.  If you are a mechanic, it would be a great travel van for a 
&gt;		great price ($900), as all else is in great shape
                           ^^^^^^^^
                           worth it for a parts vehicle alone!


&gt;	3.  If you are not a mechanic, but want a huge but inexpensive to
&gt;		drive van, you could have a garage fix the engine, but I don't
&gt;		know how much it would cost.
&gt;
&gt;It has air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, is dark blue, nice
&gt;paint, new radials, water-cooled so it goes much faster than old buses,
&gt;and has about 90,000 miles on the car, and about 20,000 on the rebuilt



WAAHHHH, it's obvious that Santa lives in California in the off season. Why 
don't I EVER see deals like this within walking distance. This is impeding 
the growth of my fleet severely!  tim s.
