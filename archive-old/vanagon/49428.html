Sorry folks, but Matt's posting is totally innefective. True, Matt cited the 
proper Federal Law, but unfortunately, one can only bring an action under 
Federal Law in Federal District Court. Small Claims courts are state courts 
and do not have the subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims under 
Federal Law.

Secondly, Small Claims courts do not have the proper In Personam 
Jursidiction (jurisdiction over the defendant) if you are dealing with an 
individual who is out of your state.

Finally, the only place where one could persue this case would only be in 
Federal District Court...and Federal District Courts do not have Small 
Claims courts.


Nice try....but sorry.
