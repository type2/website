Subject: Timing Questions

Okay, I know I should have gotten the hang of this by now, but I haven't. 

I know I've seen lots of threads on timing...and I've searched the
archives for info, but maybe one, quick validation of what I think I know
wouldn't bore folks too much...and maybe some list newcomers would also
benefit. So here goes. (BTW, my specific setup is a 34-PICT-3 carb on a
'71 bus with a 1600 dual-port engine and a Bosch 009 distributor. I have a
timing light and a tachometer that reads for 8-cylinders.)

Assumption # 1: With the tachometer attached to the distributor side of 
the coil, I should read the 8-cylinder RPM scale and multiply by 2 to get 
my actual RPMs. (Would it be better to attach the tach to the spring 
inserted at the distrubutor slot for cylinder #1 wire?)

Assumption # 2: I need to have my valves and carburator adjusted correctly
before setting timing. 

Assumption # 2 1/2: I need to have my timing adjusted correctly before 
adjusting the carburator. 'DOH!

Assumption # 3: For the 009 on a 1600 DP, timing should be about 5 to 7.5
degrees BTDC (I've heard different opinions on this), idling at 850-900 
rpms.

Assumption # 4: BTDC means (looking at the pulley) on the 
counter-clock-wise side.

Assumption # 5: If the pulley has only one notch on it, the notch is at 0 
degrees????

I appreciate any help you can offer...as the saga of the campmobile 
continues.

Thanks! Joe
