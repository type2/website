Subject: Spindal, King pin, Link pin, stuff


        I have a 59 Single Cab, which is in need of a &quot; nother &quot;

        Spindel assembly ( King pin and Bushings are worn out.) left front.

        I'm headed out to the yard to check out the price and may be find
some better ones.

        the local FLAPS want $110. plus $50 core charge for rebuilt ones.

        Besides the yard is a good place for me to practice on this type work.

        The question is, Am I looking for a splitty only, doner here or will
any VW Bus do????
        
        My understanding is All type I are the same. (correct me if I'm
wrong on this)

        Are all Type II the same also????

        Thanks much for your help in this.  Laurie
