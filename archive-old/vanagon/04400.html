There are two possibilities: a) yours is the earlier system which does
not have a fresh air blower (easy to check) and b) that one of the knobs
has been pulled from the lever (unlikely - but also easy to check).

The earlier systems were much like previous van/bug designs - relying on
forward momentum to provide both fresh and hot air flow.
The knob that you would be missing is either fresh air to passengers above
the sliding door or fresh air control (most likely the second). See my
previous message on the array of levers. The one missing would be either 3
or 4. Most likely 3.

In any case you should be able to adjust for no heat as you can for
all VW's - at the junction boxes at the back.


Cheers - DC

&gt; The manual has reference to four, everyone on this list has
&gt; four, but mine only has three!  Was the fourth a option?
&gt; It doesn't look like the third (that's the one I'm missing)
&gt; lever broken off or anything as far as I can tell.  But this
&gt; might explain why it's immpossible to shut off the air flow
&gt; out of the two top vents (defoggers).  And since the heat takes
&gt; about 15 minutes to kick in, I get cold air in the winters (summer
&gt; I don't mind).  And let me tell you - it drops to the low 50's
&gt; out here in the winter time.
