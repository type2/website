&gt;That's what I did, 'cept I used broad-beamed tractor lights.  They call them
&gt;utility lights, come with a rubber housing (no rust!) and a sealed beam lamp,
&gt;3-1/2&quot; diameter.

Me too! I bought them from some 4WD store in Belmont Ca. I mounted one on
the rear bumper, and one on a piece of angle aluminum bolted to the front
of the pop top. I used two relays and a DPDT switch on the dash. The front
one I use for setting up camp or cleaning abalones or whatever, the back is
great for avoiding little stuff in the dark, but it really proves its
usefulness when you're trying to find all of your tools scattered on the
ground in the dark. Of course why my bus breaks down so much is another
story.
