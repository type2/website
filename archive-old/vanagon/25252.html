Subject: Shocks

All,

The rear shocks on the Thing have given up the ghost. I currently do not
have the $$$ for KYB, or equivalent shocks. What I need to know is, what
are the next best, that do not go into the $30+ range. I realize prices
vary from state to state, what I am looking for is a name that I can
afford, that will give me a good ride for less bucks than the best ones
