Subject: generator =&gt; alternator conversion, silly question

	Ok, I just got a new (to me) Motorola alternator setup (50A, 14V)
and I would like to know which wires go where, etc. Someone has cut the 
wires to the regulator, so I'm assuming that I'll need to resolder these:
(red, brown, green, blue) to the regulator. I also assume that the big red
wire all by itself on the alternator goes to the starter (battery). Now,
what wire will go to the coil, and to the oil sender? How much can I
delete from the old (generator) system? Is an alternator a Good Idea (ltm)
or am I going to blow things up, like someone told me? (well, this is the
same guy who told me he was going to switch his busses back to 6V, so I
think he's a few windows short of a deluxe... &lt;g&gt;)
	Now the silly(?) question: I know some of you out there have driven
NEW splitties. What was it like?
