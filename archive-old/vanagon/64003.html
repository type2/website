Thanks for the replies I have received so far. I am still trying to get
the posting to this list right, so I apologize for the double message and 
then for not copying the rest of the list when I replied. 

The information has been very helpful so far, and I am only at the start 
of the replies. Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; I=B9m a newbie to the list, having just purchased a 91 Vanagon GL =
&gt;&gt; Westfalia Camper after wanting one for years. I love it and can=B9t =
&gt;&gt; stop grinning when I drive it. I even wave to other VW Transporter =
&gt;&gt; owners when I see them on the road! (Is this OK?)
&gt;
&gt; It's OK to wave - most of us will wave back.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; This list and the web sites I have seen so far on Vws and Westies are 
&gt;&gt; great.  I have a few questions for the list, but apologize if they =
&gt;&gt; are repeats. If there is a FAQ or archive or Website that addresses =
&gt;&gt; them, please let me know.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;The Vanagon Archives can be found at 
&gt;http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/ 
&gt;Also check out http://www.vanagon_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. My 91 Vanagon has about 90,000 miles on it and no rust. (It lived =
&gt;&gt; in Georgia its first five years.) The VW mechanic who checked it out =
&gt;&gt; for me said there is no sign of the head gasket problems I have read =
&gt;&gt; about for these water-cooled Westies. Somewhere I have read that =
&gt;&gt; keeping the engine from overheating may help prevent the head gasket =
&gt;&gt; problems. Is that true? Is there anything I can do to keep it from =
&gt;&gt; happening?
&gt;
&gt;Keep clean antifreeze mixture in it and keep a close eye on the level in
&gt;both tanks.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. On my other car (the daily driver, an 89 Acura Integra), I just =
&gt;&gt; had new struts installed. The mechanic there (not a VW expert)  said =
&gt;&gt; he=B9d once had a Vanagon but sold his because it needed a new =
&gt;&gt; exhaust system. He said the exhaust systems including mufflers for =
&gt;&gt; the Vanagon cost  around $3000, because they are stainless steel. Is =
&gt;&gt; that price right? It sounded very high to me.
&gt;
&gt;Exhaust system prices have gone down considerably from the original
&gt;dealer pricing. My Carat has 135,000 miles on it with the original
&gt;exhaust system still fully intact and operational.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. Being mechanically inept (and navigationally challenged, but =
&gt;&gt; that=B9s another story), I plan to try for preventive maintenance to =
&gt;&gt; keep the Vanagon in the best possible shape. Are there any good =
&gt;&gt; websites or sources that have information on what to do to keep the =
&gt;&gt; Vanagon in top shape? This one is in mint condition and I want to =
&gt;&gt; keep it that way if I possibly can.
&gt; 
&gt;Follow the maintenance schedule in the owners manual, wash &amp; wax it
&gt;often, check the oil and coolant level every time you get gas, make sure
&gt;your fire extinguisher is in working order, and replace those fuel lines
&gt;every 5 years.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. The same mechanic who said the exhaust systems were so expensive, =
&gt;&gt; also said the rear-wheel drive Vanagons handle fine in snow and ice, =
&gt;&gt; and especially with studded snow tires. Does anyone have experience =
&gt;&gt; with them in New England snow and ice? Should I get studded snow =
&gt;&gt; tires? It has been ages since I drove a rear-wheel drive car in the =
&gt;&gt; winter. Any tips greatly appreciated.  I was finally able to justify =
&gt;&gt; (to myself) getting the Vanagon  because I have recently started =
&gt;&gt; showing dogs at dog shows and the camper saves lots on hotel/motel =
&gt;&gt; bills. So I will be using it in the summer, spring, fall and parts of =
&gt;&gt; winter, but probably not as my daily driver.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Forgive me if you have covered all this a zillion times before.    I =
&gt;&gt; am so happy to finally have a Westy after wanting one for as long as =
&gt;&gt; all my friends can remember. When I saw this one at the previous =
&gt;&gt; owner=B9s home, I fell in love at first sight. From the postings to =
&gt;&gt; this list, I suspect the feeling will stay with me for a lifetime.
&gt;
&gt;Congratulations on your new Camper!!! 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Look forward to hearing from you.
