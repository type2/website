&gt; The antenna on my 86 vanagon broke off; the local VW people said that I needed

&gt; terms of the installation.  It seems that the antenna has to be installed from
&gt; the inside.  That is, push the antenna through the hole from the inside and
&gt; then install the gasket and locking nut from the outside.  However, I can't see
&gt; how to disassemble the dash plastic to install it from the inside.  If anyone
&gt; could provides some assistance, I would be most grateful.  Thanks!

I ran into the same thing and found there is a blind area behind the dash 
that contains the main antennae unit with an extension running down 
behind the headlight. After a few tries, I decided against trying to 
replace the thing and went for a different fix. I took a 4&quot; piece of thin 
metal rod stock that I got at a local model store and stuffed it into the 
broken end of the antennae. That puts about 3&quot; in the old antennae tube 
and leaves a 1&quot; solid stub. To that I attached a very flexible 
replacement antennae from Radio Shack. Not too elegant, but it works 
well. Not as efficient as the original for fringe area reception, but 
quite acceptable in town.

If anyone knows an easy way to remove/replace the entire antennae 
assembly, I would sure like to hear it. My local VW shop didn't have a 
clue and after nearly dismanteling the entire front end of my '86, I gave up.
