Subject: Blending touch-up paint patches

Well on Saturday I decided to do a very minor bit of touch up on a few &quot;surface&quot; rust 
spots on Lief.  But I soon discovered that they were more than surface rust.  I had holes 
along the lower rocker panel under the sliding door plus a hole that was working its way 
out from the side marker light on the passenger side (you can see this rust a bit on the 
pictures on my webpage http://www.geocities_dot_com/SiliconValley/5288/rearview.jpg).

Now I had some leftover paint that the body shop gave me when they painted the two rear DS 
panels courtesy of ICBC.  So I got a friend of Caron who has a small spray gun (he does 
some amazing artwork on motorcycle helmets and gas tanks etc) to give me a hand and we 
patched it up pretty good.

So my problem is that although the color matches almost perfectly, there is a glosss 
difference.  The newly painted patches are much more glossy than the rest.  What would be 
the best way to blend this in?  I was thinking of taking some Turtle Wax Clear Coat Polish 
that I have and buffing it with a buffing pad and my drill.  Is this a good idea?  Any 
better suggestions?
