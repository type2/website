I am listed in the Transporter Directory and have gotten a few calls over the
years. Mostly people in split screen buses on their way to Alaska.  One crew
complained that their '63 seemed to be noisier than other buses they had
known.  After pulling the engine we discovered the lower transmission mount
had been replaced by a length of steel I-beam.

 I average about two calls a year off that book.  Strangely, the people who
*should* call (Californians with too much time on their hands, split screens
that would have been better off left to rot in the forest) never do...
