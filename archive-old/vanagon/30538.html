 RE: Starter Problem.
Thanks to everyone who responded. I found that the PO Installed a 
relay and did not understand the importance of a good electrical 
connection. A wire was broken just inside the terminal connection to 
the relay. While troubleshooting I also found some questionable 
grounds such as the main to the battery going to the body was painted 
under the bolt.  Thank again for your help.
