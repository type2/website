So Scott Harvey says:
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A few months ago the engine started 'shaking' when letting
&gt;    out the clutch  from a stop.  I usually immediately put back
&gt;    in  the clutch and rev the engine and then it's o.k.  The strange
&gt;    part is that it only seems to happen during the first mile or
&gt;    so.  Any thoughts?  I don't think it's engine mounts but
&gt;    possibly the transmisssion  warming up?  Clutch?

Probably clutch chatter.  Does it really jidder?  That usually
happens after using the clutch alot, but I'd bet your clutch is
shot.
