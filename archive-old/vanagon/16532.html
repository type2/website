Ok, the number for MISTIX is:  1.800.444.7275.

The campground you want a reservation for is called Bodega Dunes, on the
Sonoma Coast State Beach.  This is for June 2-4, Friday - Sunday
morning.

Again, I encourage people to phone in and get this taken care of.  
At last tally, we have 14 vehicles interested in attending, so
at least 7 people need to make reservations to insure space for
us (at 2 vehicles per site) if everyone shows...
