Subject: Pop-top popped!!!

On my daily commute, I drive a two-lane rural road that has traffic that 
moves very fast.  Sometimes a combination of strong winds and large trucks 
going 65-70mph will cause the front of my Westy pop-top to pop up about 1.5 
inches and stay there.  There are some little clips in the very front that I 
think are supposed to keep this from happening, but they aren't doing their 
job and I don't think they are adjustable.  For the time being (to keep from 
permanent damage to the top hinges) I have a BIC ski hold down strap keeping 
the front down.

Questions:  Anybody else ever have this happen?  Are there any adjustments 
in the top mechanism that would fix this?  Are these little hold down clips 
(they are shaped like question marks (?)) unique to the '73 or did they use 
the same thing on all Westy's?

Any help and advice would be appreciated.  TIA.

Dean
