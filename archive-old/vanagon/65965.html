Eric,
I had the same problem with my old '85 GL Vanagon to the point that the
rotor had about desinigrated. The problem was that I was using an
offbrand cap and the wrong rotor (it was from an air-cooled 009
distributor). Swapped things out for original Bosch and I never had a
problem again.

&gt; Volks.
&gt;
&gt; I have an 86 Westy in which I noticed an abnormal amount of wear on
&gt; the rotor
&gt; and distributor cap contacts. I have to change both about every 3500
&gt; miles.
&gt; Does this mean I need a whole new distributor like my local VW parts
&gt; store/shop tells me. Or, is there a simple less expensive method. I
&gt; was
&gt; quoted $ 270 for a new distributor.
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt;
