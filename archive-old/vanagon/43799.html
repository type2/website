Subject: 74 running rough

Hi all,

After changing carbs, coil, vacuum advance, cap and rotor, my motor
STILL is running badly.  When driving, it seems like all electrical power
stops for a second, then picks up again.  It acts like it is missing, it
stumbles pretty bad even at steady speeds, then runs fine for a minute or
two.  I am lost about the cause.   It is frustrating because it is
very intermitent and at idle it runs fine.  I thought maybe the coil wire
had grounded agains the block, but all the wires look fine.

Any ideas?  I remember that recently someone else on the list had a
similar problem, but I just cleaned up my files and deleted all the back
digests that I had been saving.  I don't remember how that problem got
fixed.

Thanks in advance,
Craig
