Subject: Re: Poor shifting in '71 bus


&gt;my shifter used to not feeel to good too...IT FIXED ITSELF !!!!!  the
&gt;procedure was as follows:
&gt;
&gt;talk really nicely [read 'curse violently'] to your reverse gear while
&gt;pushing your van backwards.  go out to drive it one day and discover that
&gt;not only has reverse returned from the dead, but _everything_felt good.
&gt;
&gt;simple huh?

So that's the problem... I'm using wrong procedures and tools! Trashcan the
Craftsman stuff, parts, and moly grease... turn to the Karma section in
St. Muir! Practical, makes sense, feels right, and it's free! and worth
every penny of it, for sure!

Seriously, Bob, my '71 tranny seems fine once I get it into gear-- no popping
out, grinding, whining, etc. But getting it in can be an interesting
exercise. Is the gear after first going to be second, or reverse (ouch!)?
And after slowing for a corner, I coast blithely through the intersection
with cars piling up behind me, as I try for the sixth, then seventh, then
eighth, etc. time to get it into second. Finally (when I make it an offer it
can't refuse) it goes in with a loud CLUNK, and away we go.

Looking at the little cagelike connector between the shifter and the
tranny nosecone, it looks shiny and new. But several folks have suggested
replacing a bushing that exists somewhere in that general vicinity, and one
has suggested looking for worn surfaces on the steel shift fork inside the
tranny nosecone. Sounds good!

Thanx for the info so far, ladies and gents. This is a great list-- keep
up the great work!
