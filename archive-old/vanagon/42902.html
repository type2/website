Subject: bad wheel bearing maybe?

On my 90 Westy, I have a distinct grrrrrrrrrrrr or grinding (not a knock or
clack) when I make a left turn.  Not every left turn, it doesn't do it on
slow easy turns, just the ones that will make the van lean.  I've tried it
with the clutch in and out and coasting and while applying the gas (a
little).  Although I can't swear to it, it seems like it doesn't do it if I
give it a little gas.  I have plenty of tire clearance and there is no sign
the tires are rubbing.  Could this be a bad wheel bearing?  It's at the rear
and I think it sounds as if its coming from the right side of the van.  I'm
not sure if it gets louder as I speed up, since the van adds noise of its
own.  I'm somewhat mechanically challenged, so how would I check to confirm?

TIA, Ian
