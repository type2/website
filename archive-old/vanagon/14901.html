Subject: RE: this weekend

The San Jose meet starts at 0800 (that's 8AM for all you civvies)...  I suspect 
that if we plan for an 11 AM showing that those who are going will have enough 
time to get in and do their parts/cars browsing before the show.  Keep in mind 
that this meet has quite a lineup and all of the VW mags will be there...   
Who's going to bring what in terms of vid equipment?   

       Jon

PS:  My response time is going to be very marginal over the next 3 days as I 
will be in an offsite class and unable to hookup with my machine (even 
remotely).....
