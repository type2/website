Subject: Re: Arbitrating VW - Vanagon Head Gaskets

In a message dated 95-11-05 22:15:54 EST, you write:

&gt;and ask them to pay 100%.  They said they would
&gt;only go 50% and that I could take it to arbitrations
&gt;to try and get more.
&gt;
&gt;Is there anyone out there that has done this on this
&gt;old of a vehicle and won ?
&gt;
&gt;

I have an '88 GL that VW would only pay 33 percent, but I had a lot more
miles on it (almost 90 thou) when the gasket went.  The only problem is, It
may be going again,
and after only 22 K miles on the new one!  (hopefully, it's a pinhole in one
of my coolant hoses - I haven't found the leak yet!)
