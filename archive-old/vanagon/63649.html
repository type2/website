&lt;&lt; This prices makes me blind. I got an offer from
 Winkler selling this plastic fender for DM 300.-
 a &gt;SET&lt;, that's about USD 200.-
 
 It makes me rich shipping this parts over the pond.
 Does anyone like to have one? Group purchases are
 welcome.  &gt;&gt;

Include me in this!  I've got $200 + shipping waiting for a set!
