This is just a little confusing with a guy named Tom posting with the 
name of Rachel.  How did your parents dress you?  Gender confusion 
aside, I too would like a sample copy of your newsletter.

Echoing a couple of previous posts I too welcome you officially to the
freak house.  :)

P.S.  Thom, we all still love you AND your '56, even if it isn't the 
oldest on the list anymore.  Make that twice, there is that guy in Oz 
that hasn't figured out to get that '54 home.  :)
