Subject: Re: Poor shifting in '71 bus

My '73 Sportsmobile had really bad shifting when I got it.  It may have been
mentioned before, but the shift coupler that connects to the shift rod in the
back does have a tendency to go bad.  I got one that had urethane inserts for
around $10-15 and cleaned the shifting up nicely.  Took about 1/2 hour to
install; less if it's not snowing all around you, probably!  By the way, I do
NOT recommend trying to install a short shift kit in a late model Bus.  I
tried Whitney's short throw shift kit (about $5 or less), hoping that might
tighten up the shifting a bit more.  No dice.  If anything, it made it worse.
 I yanked it out and it now makes an interesting conversation piece in my
garage!

OK, enough rambling, gotta get back to work on my Bus!
