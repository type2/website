Subject: Final parts list from the '80 Vanagon

Well, the here's the list I have of parts that are not spoken for.
And I've put prices on most of the items.  The stuff with out a price 
means I don't know, or buy something else and it's free.  No matter what 
you want... make an offer, the worst I'll do is say no.  :)  Buy a couple 
things and I'll lower the price.  Shipping is extra.
