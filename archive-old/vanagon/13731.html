&gt; I agree with Derek.  Running rich is much better than running lean.  The
&gt; reason is that a lean mixture will cause detonation (pinging) which will
&gt; destroy an aluminum motor in short order.
&gt; 
&gt; -David
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with all that has been said so far. BUT, folks with catalytic
 &gt;converter cannot afford to get sloppy with the mixture at all, IMHO.
&gt; Rich mixtures will cause the catalyst to overheat and load up - It's
&gt; an expensive part!

Dave and Derek,

I agree with you both, it is probably better to run rich than lean. However,
as Dave indicated you can run into other problems such as smoking the cat.  I
smoked the original cat approximately 3000 miles ago.  Oem Cats are big
bucks.  I found an aftermarket cat for approximately $125.0 in upper state
new york.  I'm afraid if i keep running it this way I'll smoke this one as
well.  Also, emission laws in connecticut are getting much more stringent
next year. The way it's running now it will never pass.  Looks like i'll be
applying for another waiver.  I'll keep you informed as to the possible
fix.....soon as i get a hold on a new or used air flow box.    


thanks
