&gt; &gt;   By the way: you guys are a REALLY active mailgroup...how do you manage
to
&gt; &gt; read all these messages every day ? Or are all of you full time computer
&gt; &gt; eggheads ? any suggestions ??                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;   ^^^^^^^^
&gt; 

I am also a computer spud, there seems to be a trend here.  This seems to
make sence as this is a computerized method of comunication.   

The most inportant thing about dealing with volume mail is to deal with each
peice of mail when you read it.  Reply to it, save for later (some place
other than you mail box) and delete it.
