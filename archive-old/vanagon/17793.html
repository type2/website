here's an update from my '77 bus problems from last night.

Now, none of the injectors work, and one of them has a big hole in it. 
The engine is not getting gas (I still assume a bad cold start valve
also).  I think the most likely candidate at this point is something the
Bus Stop calls  Combi Relay, and Haynes calles the double relay  (it's
that little black box on the left front wall of the engine compartment). 
I hooked up a VOM to the electrical leads to the injectors, like haynes
says, and got ~1 volt when I turned the car on and off, but nothing when I
cranked the starter.  
  However, there is a problem with just assuming that the relay is bad: 
the fuel pump is working!  Since they are part of the same circuit,
shouldn't the fuel pump be out too?  Does this mean I have brain problems
($$$!!!)?

The turn signals will wait for awhile, now.
