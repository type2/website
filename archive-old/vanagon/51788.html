Hi all,

If you are looking for brush guards to push those old land rovers out of
the way, take a look on the German market. There are small one, usuable
for cyclist and small bushes, medium size, for land rovers, and heavy
duty size for trucks and trees.

If you are interested I will send you prices next week and pictures, which
have to be scanned in first, maybe end of next week.
