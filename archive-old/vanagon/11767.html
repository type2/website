I am unsure about the pre 80 engines but the 82 has pretapped holes for
sensors (basically the FI Heat sensor) on all four cylinder head areas. I
installed the head sensor there but have sinced moved it to no.3 plug which
runs the hottest of all four (in theory). It was not difficult taking off
the plug gasket and replacing it with the head sensor ring. Differences
between the two areas were noticeable. The head would never go above 275
at the FI sensor pickup area whereas 350 is the norm at the spark plug (more
normal according to the gauge).

Ask Sami about installing in other areas.


As for oil temp, David Schwarze and I agree that the best place is the oil
galley pickup; unfortunately the adapter needed is for a 914....so this
may be expensive or a junk yard item. David C.
