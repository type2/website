What is it?

    GNATT (Great North American Transporter Trek) is basically
    going to be a sightseeing trip of the United States and parts
    of Southern Canada.  The idea was conceived by members of the
    VANAGON mailing list and is currently being organized by yours truly
    (schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil) with the help of Martha Rubin 
    (nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu)

Who thought up the name?

    The name (GNATT) was suggested to me by Patrick Tower
    (poser_at_leland.Stanford.EDU) although he claims to have heard
    it from somewhere else.  Another name I really liked was
    &quot;Transporter Owners' Great Adventure   (TOGA)&quot; suggested by
    Dyer Lytle (lytle_at_noao_dot_edu).  Thanks to Joel Walker, Steve Johnson,
    Richard Palmer, Dyer Lytle, and Patrick Tower for all of the
    name suggestions.  Is everyone happy with GNATT?  We could change it...

When is it?

    The trip is scheduled to start on May 19th, 1995 and last
    approximately a month, maybe longer.

Where will it go?

(approximate schedule)

Friday and Saturday, May 19-20, Yosemite Nat'l Park, California.
Sunday and Monday, May 21-22, Lassen Park, California.
Tuesday and Wednesday, May 23-24, Redwood Park, California.
Thursday and Friday, May 25-26, Crater Lake, Oregon.
Saturday, May 27, Honeyman State Park, Oregon.
Sunday, May 28, Portland, Oregon.
Monday and Tuesday, May 29-30, Olympic Peninsula, Washington.
Wednesday, May 31, Seattle, Washington.
Thursday, June 01, Victoria, British Columbia.
Friday and Saturday, June 02-03, Mt. Revelstoke area, British Columbia.
Sunday and Monday, June 04-05, Glacier Nat'l Park, Montana.
Tuesday and Wednesday, June 06-07, Yellowstone Nat'l Park, Montana.
Thursday and Friday, June 08-09, Mt. Rushmore &amp; Black Hills Nat'l Forest, S.D.
Saturday, June 10, Badlands Nat'l Park, South Dakota.
Sunday, June 11, Omaha Nebraska.
Monday, June 12, Picnic, St. Louis, Missouri.

Well, that's the Western leg.  The Eastern leg has not been planned yet,
volunteers gladly accepted, as the way things are going, I don't know if
I will be able to do it myself.

There are about 40 people that have expressed interest in participating
in a portion of the trip, and based on past experience I expect less than
half that many to actually make it.  The VANAGON list has grown and
changed significantly since this was discussed last, so I am announcing
it again in hopes of getting some more participants.  

William Warburton, who was travelling in South America, was supposedly
going to be coming up through Mexico to Southern California sometime in
March, buying a bus, and joining the tour - but I haven't heard from
him since he called me a couple of months ago.  I hope he is okay...

I myself am fairly committed, at this point, to making most or all of
the Western leg of the GNATT tour.  I have already been granted a month
off of work, and am working hard on my 73 camper to get it ready for the
trip.  Be assured that the tour WILL HAPPEN!  :)

The point of this post is that if anyone is interested in joining up for
a part of this great adventure, and haven't contacted Martha or myself
already, please let us know!  We want to make this as big an event as
possible and a lot of fun for everyone, and the key is participation!

Thanks,

-David
