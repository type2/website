&gt;&gt; Followup on a point Tim Smith makes about exposure to the elements:  The 70
&gt;&gt; does not have the bellypan that the Vanagon has covering the gas heater, does
&gt;&gt; it?  You might want to make one up, otherwise you'll lose (even) more heat
&gt;&gt; than the Vanagon does, and your gas heater fuel pump and lines will just be
&gt;&gt; sitting out where road debris can Murphy's Law you.  In your 70, you have a
&gt;&gt; heating option Vanagons don't have: the booster fans that mount inside and
&gt;&gt; push prewarmed air through the heating system.  Cheaper to buy, cheaper to
&gt;&gt; maintain, and less flammable than the gas heater.

&gt;We've actually fashioned such a plate from the existing one the mechanic
&gt;pulled off the Vanagon. We'll give this try, if it doesn't work out, I
&gt;can try other stuff (the fan system is high on the list).

further to that thought. Bellypans, also have their downside. They are
wonderful in keeping heat in, but they also retain dirt and water quite
well too i.e the rusties. Thus from time to time you should take the pan
off and check the situation out. That's my opinion on the matter
