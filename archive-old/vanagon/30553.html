Subject: vent fan 

my front vent fan motor ('85 GL Retrowesty) is seizing. The VW dealer 
said it was a common problem and wanted to charge me more money than I 
had for a new motor.  A junkyard said they had one and wanted $20 for it, 
but I'm skeptical if it will work, or also seize.  What's the cheapest 
way to fix it?
-for now I've removed the knob so I won't be tempted to turn up the 
fan to clear the windshield(and to avoid that rotten-fish smell of the fuse 
smoldering) -gotta keep moving.....
