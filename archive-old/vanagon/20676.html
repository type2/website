Subject: Bodywork ... advice?

I have some body work to do on my bus.  Mostly small dents and the such.  
After looking around at vehicles in the area with some real bad bondo work, 
I was pondering using a lead body filler.  Has anyone gone this route 
before?  I read that this method was abondoned because of the time and costs 
involved.  Having soldered and brazed things before, I can tell you first 
hand that it won't come off.  I really want to do a good job on the 
bodywork, something I can be proud of.  Also, I am also still looking for a 
paint gun and I can't find a decent one at a resonable price locally.  Does 
anyone know of a mail-order company which sells brand name guns?  Thanks in 
advance.

Chris.
