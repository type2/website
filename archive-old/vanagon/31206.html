Sorry to break in on this thread, just remembered what we once used our
Transporter to. We were visiting a real nice midummer night film festival in
the northenmost parts of Finland, and as the festival came to a close a
friend found himself stranded with a broke down Harley (year and model
escapes me now, but it was HUGE). So I says, hey, let's put it in my car. 
Getting it in was a hell of a job and required some thinking, but it
actually did fit (standing at that). Off we go the 1500 kilometres or so
back to Helsinki, where we arrive some 16 hours later (having stopped at his
dads place, where he showed me an early beetle, one of the oldest still
running in Finland, with his father as the proud original owner, bought it
in Germany way back).
Once in Helsinki we finally unloaded the bike and parted ways. 
Just wanted to share it with you fellow vw-ers:-)
