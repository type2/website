Subject: WTD: ASCII Breadloaf Westy


I know we went throught this before but could someone send me an ASCII 
Breadloaf Westy.  I prefer the side view for this application.

I'm going to have Bill Abbott's Netsurfnugen ASCII art put on the back of 
a T-Shirt and I'd like to put the Westy on the front.

                           Thanks.
