Subject: Was I dreaming? [f]

I biked down to the parts store,
Cause my Vee Dub needed work,
And the prices for Volkswagen parts,
They drove me half beserk.

But listen, something happened,
That I'll tell you all about;
This was the oddest Blarney,
Beyond the slightest doubt.

A most mysterious thing it was,
On Good Saint Patrick's day,
I saw a yellow vanagon
A-barrelin' my way.

I jumped aside to save my life
As past me it did glide,
And startled more I never was,
To catch a glimpse inside.

Most eerie, I confess to you,
(The chills I still can feel)
Because that van was pilotless--
No driver at the wheel!

I swallowed hard and gathered pluck
And hopped aboard my bike,
To catch up with that vanagon,
And see what it was like.

I finally overtook the bus--
That yellow vanagon--
Amazed, I saw 'twas driven by 
A wee green leprechaun!

Just as I drew aside of him
He stopped, and gave a smile,
And then his van fell all to bits!
A rainbow touched the pile.

He grinned and winked and disappeared
Like leprechauns of old,
And left me with a pile of parts--
The rainbow's pot o' gold!
