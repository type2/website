Subject: dashboard alters

I have an idea that I'd like to toss out to the list community. I've always 
maintained an alter of sorts on the dash of my bus. A rolling history of my 
travels. My alter tends to be natural in origin: wildflowers, leaves, 
sticks, stones, bones, kelp, sea shells, etc. with the occasional plastic 
novelty thrown in for good humor.

The idea is to create a &quot;VW Bus Dashboard Alters&quot; web page with photos of 
various dashboard alters. I'm willing to host the page if there is enough 
interest. Let me know (nicely) if this idea is too weird or crazy or boring, 
or...

This just popped into my head yesterday and I haven't thought it through 
very seriously, but it seems like it could be interesting. What do you think?
