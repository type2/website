 &gt; This whole paint ball  idea is a little too intriguing, isn't it?!!?  
 &gt; I mean its a defensive move that has real possibilites...

Yes, it's attractive, but what I worry about is that when I draw a bead with 
the paint gun the target (who's a jerk or I wouldn't be doing this) hauls the 
.357 out from under his seat and lets me have it.

He'd probably get off, too. After all, I pointed a gun at him...

Damn.  I liked the idea...
