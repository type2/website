&gt;Total for replacing the head gaskets is is about $886.00. 
&gt;This includes 14 hrs of labor(14 hours because they will have 
&gt;to use heat to get the exhaust system, etc off).

Did you consider removing the exhaust system yourself? Might not be much
more than one afternoon of exhausting work, if you have a nut-breaker. 
Then you put evrything back together with new nuts and bolts before going
to the shop?
