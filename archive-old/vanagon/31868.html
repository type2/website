Subject: 80 Vanagon Cold Starting Problems
Date: Wed, 3 Jan 1996 19:58:45 -0500

I've got a problem with my 1980 Vanagon Westfalia.  When it's cold outside overnight, usually below 32 
degrees F, the bus won't initially crank.  It sounds like the starter is not even turning over.  However up to 
now if I try it several times, the engine will usually turn over.  Here are some of the particulars:

1.  I replaced the battery with one with 660 cranking amps and 500 cold cranking amps.
2.  I performed the fix described in the Muir book about the bypass solenoid.
3.  I tested voltage coming back to the battery and it was 13.5 volts with the engine running normally.
4.  I had the charging system checked by Sears and they said everything is okay.
5.  I'm not really sure about this one but at least once when it wouldn't crank a friend told me to try the 
headlights.  I did and they DID NOT LIGHT!?  The parking lights and the dome lights would light 
but not the headlamps.  During that same incident, I accidentally left the parking lights on for over 
five hours.  When I came home a saw that, I was sure the bus wouldn't crank.  It fired right up.???

It seems to me, whatever the problem is, it is temperature related and electrical.  Can anyone help me with 
this problem before the temperature drops again.
