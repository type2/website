Subject: Camshaft wear

The camshaft in my 1700cc engine has rectangular depressions on the 
two center lobes.  Tom Wilson says this means my camshaft is worn out 
and must be replaced.  Is this true? If I replace it, do I have to 
get all new lifters too?  Any ideas on prices for a 1700cc reground 
cam?
Thanks
