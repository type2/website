&gt; According to them, it is running rich at start-up, due to a failing

   This is a common problem. I have not found any real problems with 
   this switch not working. There is a new  part avalable at the dealer
   to update this switch. You can try adjusting it, but in a short time
   you will get the same resaults, without the update.


&gt; And, I complained about the low heat output, and they declared the heater 
&gt; temperature cable to be bent/kinked/whatever.  I am doubtful.  Has anyone 
&gt; experienced this problem?  The van passed their pressure test of the 
&gt; cooling system, no leaks, despite the sweetish odor from the rear heater.
     Most mechanics will not take the time needed to find this problem.
     Remove rear seat, etc. around rear heater, run van and check for
     leaks.
