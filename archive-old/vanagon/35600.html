Subject: Re: OSPHO

&gt;Hi-
&gt;        Thanks for the info about OSPHO. I want to give it a try but no one
&gt;in my area (NJ) seems to carry it. Most of the places never heard of it. I
&gt;called about ten stores and then gave up. Can you please tell me what store
&gt;you buy it in so that I can try to get some.
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Regards,

I get mine at professional autobody supply stores, usually PPG Finishes
stores. It comes in a gallon plastic bottle, enough for several very rusty
cars. Rebottle the leftover and sell it to your friends down at the
autocross. An autobody repair shop should be able to tell you where to find
a supply shop. They sell paint, paint guns, finishes, polishes, machines,
sandpaper, body fasteners, airhoses and connectors, as well as chemicals.
Some Newark-area numbers I got through a Yellow Pages Directory search on
the WWW follow (I haven't called them):
