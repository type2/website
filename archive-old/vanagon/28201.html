     &gt;I'm at the crossroads!

     More than you realize! At 150,000 miles on your limping, steaming
     wasserboxer, why not consider a nice, smooth running 5 cyl Audi engine
     good for 300K miles?

     What do you think Dave? You've followed the threads, I'm sure.
     Sounds like the perfect candidate:

        (1) You're still running, so the Transplant
        Task Force has a little time to do the engineering, but the patient
        sounds critical, so we can motivate this project.

        (2) You're considering buying a rebuilt motor, so I know you
        have something to put into this, and I am sure we can
        get several listmembers to split development costs in exchange
        for access to the finished engineering.

        (3) You're not a syncro, so the Task Force will have fewer problems
        to solve.

        (4) Belt Buckle, as I recall, is well south of Nashville, and you
        probably won't have to pay major urban area ($60/hr) labor rates.
        On the Audi list yesterday some junkyard had a 5 cylinder engine
        complete with computer and harnesses for something like $375. You
        could have money left over for fuzzy dice and stuff!

        (5) (Other listmembers invited to fill in additional reasons here)

     How 'bout it. Wanna step up to the bar?
