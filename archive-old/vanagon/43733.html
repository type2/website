Subject: Annoying oil plug drip.

Hello,

I have a partially stripped drain plug in my 87 westy.  I had the local shop
install a helicoil but it still drips.  Apparantly a helicoil is something
that retreads the old drain plub but it didn't work in my case.  Anyway I've
heard talk of &quot;expansion bolts.&quot;  My mechanic doesn't like them, says I
should live with the drip.  Any ideas or sources for an expansion plug.  I
doubt I'm alone in this problem.

Thanks!
Craig Charles
