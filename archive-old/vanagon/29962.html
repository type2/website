Subject: Steve's Big Adventure

Steve did arrive in Springfield around 9:00 p.m. last night and we got 
the V6anagon to my house around 3:00 a.m.  (I let him convey just how fun 
*that* was).  He is under the bus at this very moment replacing the 
steering rack.  He has already replaced the battery and the fuel pump.  
He hopes to be out of here soon.  Think good thoughts ...

&gt; Bob,

&gt; This isn't a reply to your question, I have no idea about THAT. But I was wondering if 
&gt; Steve M made it in to pick up the V6agon, assuming you're one that was picking him up 
&gt; at the airport.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are one and the same drop me a note regarding the estimated time of departure 
&gt; towards California for Steve.
&gt; 
&gt; How everything is going well...
