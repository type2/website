Subject: Re: fixing old heat exchangers

Sami sez:
&gt;While the engine was out, I shopped around for a pair of used, but good,
&gt;heater boxes. The 2 pairs I saw were in worse shape than my own and both
&gt;merchants wanted $75 per box! That's the rustbelt for ya.

I chime in:
       *Whoa_there_killer*...   You can get *new* ones from jc whipme for
around that price-I looked 'em up before I went the j-tube route (it's
always hot in Texas-well, ok, it's cold for maybe 3 days). They were $69
ea. as I recall.. Might be a bit more now that they're in season, but if
you're payin' $70, make sure they're shiny &amp; new.   I intend to replace
mine, but it'll be when it isn't a choice between heat and food.

Peace,
