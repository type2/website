Subject: Blue sparks afire


The other night after driving home I was letting the
engine cool a bit by idling it a few minutes.  Anyway,
I pop the hatch and much to my chagrin, see the little blue
sparks jumping out of my wires :(
 
I grabbed hold of the wires, and now the little sparks
were jumping to me, but I couldn't feel them.  Is a little
leakage normal?

The wires are Bosch, and about one year old, bought new.
Its a new rotor and cap (2 months) and a new Blue Coil (2 months).
 
do I have a problem or is this normal?
If someone could mail me, my reading of the list has been
sporadic at best (19 days of school left..)

Thanks,
Matt
