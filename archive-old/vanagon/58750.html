&gt; [Virus Hoax Deleted]
&gt; OK, I'm sick of seeing this thing.  First of all, this &quot;virus&quot; is a
&gt; hoax, exactly like penpal greetings and good times.  If you read the
&gt; thing, you notice they only changed the file name.
&gt;
&gt;From the DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEM NETWORK Security Bulletin 9706, 
April 21, 1997

&quot;AOL4FREE actually consists of three separate, independent items:

  1. The AOL4FREE Macintosh Program for gaining fraudulent accounts on AOL.
  2. The AOL4FREE Virus Warning Hoax.
  3. The AOL4FREE.COM Trojan horse program that deletes all the files on
     your hard drive.

The third item is the AOL4FREE.COM Trojan Horse. This program appears to be
the AOL4FREE program that creates fraudulent AOL accounts (though it is a
DOS program instead of a Macintosh program) but is actually a simple
compiled DOS batch file that runs the DOS DELTREE command on the C:\
directory of a DOS/Windows machine. The DELTREE command deletes all files in
a directory, including the directory itself and any subdirectories in that
directory. The effect is to delete all files on the C: drive of a
DOS/Windows machine. If you should come across this program from any source,
do not run it. For more information see CIAC Bulletin H-47a: AOL4FREE.COM
Trojan Horse Program Destroys Hard Drives.&quot;

For the complete bulletin see http://nic_dot_mil/SCC/bulletins.html

 AOL4FREE.COM is neither a hoax nor a virus.  It is a Trojan Horse.
