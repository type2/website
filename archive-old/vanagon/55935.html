Subject: 82 diesel westy for trade

I am interested in trading my 82 diesel westy for an air cooled bay 
window or vanagon. My van has less than 10,000 on rebuilt engine and less 
than 2,000 on rebuilt tranny. Ive also replaced the brake master 
cylinder, rebuilt the starter, and other maintenence and replacement 
parts totaling over $4500. 
There are a few dents, but VERY little rust. (it was a Cal car). I ;live 
in MA, so in the area would be preferable. If anyones interested please 
reply by P-mail.
thanks
paul c
