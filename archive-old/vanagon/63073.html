&gt;does your 85 westy have the floor rails?  The 2 person middle seat out of a 7
&gt;pass will fit in your westy but you cant open the fridge door with it in
&gt;there (just slide it to clear the door when you want access to the fridge)

In order to do this &quot;slide&quot; you need to (1) unbolt the seat (4 bolts) and
(2) unbolt the rail end caps (2 bolts).  Or you could leave off the rail
end caps and never bolt the seat down.  This is what I surmise Chris is
talking about.

I have an 84 Wolfsburg Westfalia GL and I bolt and unbolt the whole
schebang, which is a bit of work (mostly to lug the seat about).  Last
night we went to a drive-in theatre (George Of the Jungle and Hercules)
with the middle seat in (for viewing purposes).  Now I will remove it to
get back to cleaner seating for 4 (wife, 8 and 4 yr old boys and me)
install the rail covers and the floor mat.

But I am intrigued (but scared) about this prospect of not bolting in the
bench seat.

Has anyone been doing this?

Do you feel safe this way?

Does your spouse/SO feel safe this way?

Ever been in an accident?  What was the result?

TIA
