Subject: clutch shudder-me too

I too have a problem with an occasional engine shudder when taking off in 1st
or rev gear. Seems to only happen when under a load (incline) 5% of the time.
I visually checked the motor mounts, they look fine. 

I'm stumped too. Other than the occasional shudder the clutch works fine. How
prevelent is this??? I just live with it.
