Subject:      Re: All CA '91s really '90s?

Steve, I bought my 90 Carat here in California in 1990, thinking that it
was the last year that Vanagons would be sold in the U.S. I was puzzled
when I went to Colorado and found used 91s for sale on the used car lots.
I thought they were pulling a fast one on people till I learned that 91s
were sold outside of California. I was told that the 91s wouldn't meet
the C.A.R.B. standards for 1991.

I have never heard anything about power locks and windows being standard
on anything but the Carat and Wolfsburg models.

And thats the truth as I know it!!
