Subject: Re: Best VW Meet Awards (F)

a friend of mine from BC went all the way to Sacramento to get this 67 panel
van that was completely straight and rust free.  as you can imagine, these
are not easily found here in soggiland.     On his way north he stopped to
visit another friend in Lynnwood, WA.   While there the van was ripped off.
  gone. stolen.  8(

happily though, the Lynnwood friends neighbor found is a month later,
abandoned near his house, miles from where it was stolen.    In the engine
compartment there was a Bible.  (were they praying for the motor to start?)
   under the back seat were pictures of saints (not St. Muir)   and scattered
in the bus were used needles.  very bizarre

about a month ago he took the bus to a small show north of seattle, the
Autoweiss show, and entered it in the 67 and earlier bus class,   with those
contents on display, a short note of explanation, and  a sign asking if
anyone knew whose stuff it was!

The bus won the class!
