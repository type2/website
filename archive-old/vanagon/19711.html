Subject:      Whaaat is going on with that fuel system?





Should have brought this up a few weeks ago when my wife first brought the bus
home, a barely chuggin in. She didn't think she would make it. Me, not being a
great diagnostician, proceeded to do what I could--hoping for a cure. In the
midst of the work I notice a smooth little metal plug, set it aside--never
know when you might need a smooth little metal plug--and went back to work.
About an hour latter I am starring at the carb, a solex, when suddenly my mind
begins to register the fact there is a hole in the center of my carb, I can
even see the gas sitting inside--I further connect the found metal plug and
the hole and put the two back together, shoving that plug back in, no thread
you know. I have never seen such a thing happen!!

Well I was going to ask about it but I've been busy trying to get the bus
ready for our first camping trip. Besides, I figure it is due to all the
backfiring I have been having with the bad--really bad--exaust system, and
there is a new one on the way. And sure enough, with that new one, no more
backfiring. Got that babe all tuned and about ready to go, took off this
morning to target to get a spare fuse for the campmobile, came out, cranked
over and there was a small &quot;biff&quot; of a backfire, couldn't believe it. Then I
could barely get it started, chugged along with no power a couple of minute,
pulled over with visions of that plug blowing out again and this time catching
on fire, I'm not ready to use that new fire extinguisher I just bought, and
rolled to a stop. When I when back to take a look both of my new red manifold
seals for the dotal port were two inches in where they must have been blown of
the connection. Slide them back, burned a couple fingers, she started right up
and now I am home writing this.

Its a 1600, dual port, and when I last checked the compression it was 175-180
on all four. This is a new one to me, any ideas?

Thanks,

Tim &amp; his 69 campmobile Woodstock
