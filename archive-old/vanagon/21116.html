Subject: re: EV resistor update


Good detective work on the EV resistors, Ric.  Thanks for the write-up.
Regarding your offer to circulate the manual you're assembling, that 
would be great - I'd really appreciate it.  Wish I had the same access 
you have to dealer/service info.

On another note, any EV owners know how to remove front grill pieces 
and/or the front bumper cover?  The reason I ask is that when I bought 
my EV, the filler panel (metal piece between the plastic grill and top 
of bumper) had been pushed in slightly - enough to not look good. Also 
the front bumper cover has some scars.  I have the replacement pieces and 
I'm starting to puzzle about how they're removed.  Hopefully replacement 
will be obvious.
