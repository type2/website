&gt;Does anyone know if any nationally distributed antifreeze
&gt;is phosphate free?  I live in an area where I would have
&gt;to drive 250 miles to get VWs coolant and it _is_ that time.

BASF (who makes the vw stuff) also makes coolant for BMW, Mercedes, Volvo,
and Saab ... all of which are phosphate-free. they (BASF) also make something
called Zerex Extreme which is also phosphate-free. it should be available
through local parts stores.

if you have a Toyota dealer in town, check their parts counter for the
Toyota coolant ... it should also be phosphate-free.

another possibility is this Sierra stuff, which is propylene glycol, NOT
the normal ethylene glycol ... the Sierra coolant is phosphate-free (i think)
and it is also non-poisonous to kids and animals. BUT!! the story is that it
doesn't get rid of heat as well, nor does it lower the freezing point as much
(so winter protection is not as good). but it is cheap. :)

remember: if it don't SAY &quot;phosphate-free&quot; on the label, it probably ain't!!!!
