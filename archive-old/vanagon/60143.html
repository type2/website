Subject: Re: VW Classic additional &lt;NEATO&gt; event...

On the Vanagon list, Jim Davis &quot;SyncroHead_at_aol_dot_com&quot; asked the musical
question and gave a nice schedule of events. I would like to mention one
more &lt;NEATO&gt; event which will be part of the S*T*/VW Classic Weekend.
----------------------------------------------------------------

The folks from &quot;Box on Wheels&quot; club will be holding the Fourth Annual
Classic Weekend &quot;Old Bus Campout&quot;
Co-Sponsors/participants of the event are: Vintage Transporter Owners (VTO)
and The Arizona Bus Club.

DETAILS:
To Non-Californians it's roughly in the &quot;LA&quot; area near Irvine.
Southern Californians would so much more specific! ;-)

Saturday June 7 1997
O'Neil Regional Park
30892 Trabuco Canyon Road
$12.00 per car
Please RSVP

DIRECTIONS:
5 Fwy South of the 405
Exit El Toro Rd. East
Drive for a while until you're out of town
Turn right on Trabuco then another right onto ONeil.
Keep on going. You will bump into Oneil Park.
&lt;sounds like funky directions, but I found it by just following a road atlas!&gt;

Clean shower facilities, Nice company, and safe camping in a wooded, clean
park area in the hills over looking Irvine. It will be a good time and is
better than pretending to be parked &lt;via stealth mode&gt; in the Holiday Inn
Parking lot and begging showers from the &quot;Bigshots with rooms!&quot;  ;-)

MOINFO and RSVP:
Daniel Lewis 1(800) 809-4960 lv message
