Hey all,
	Just one quick question out of complete curiosity.  Just about
	how fast will a breadloaf bus with the 1970cc fuel injected
	engine go assuming its in proper tune and all that.  I know it
	ain't a rocket and I'm thinking it's somewhere around 70-75 mph.
	Close, way off, or what?

	Sean

	Yeah, I forgot a question mark up there. 

	P.S.  sorry about before :)
