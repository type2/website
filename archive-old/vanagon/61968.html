Subject:      Re: out of sight

what i had designed and intended to do (... one of these days ...) was to
get some fabric or tarp-like material, put snaps in the sides and the
other (male?) snaps into the sides of the bus's interior. i'd figured out
that if i mad the cover long enough, but put snaps in the right places,
i could cover the rear area all the way up to the middle seats (of a non-
camper), but UNsnap some of it (and still keep the rear portion covered)
if i put the rearmost seat upright (i.e., NOT folded down into a bed).

the only gotcha with this is that the male snaps on the sides of the
interior would have to be attached with screws.

you can buy these things at hardware stores and fabric stores.
