&gt; I just returned from the parts store over lunch.  Not having owned an
&gt; gasoline powered car since 1980, its been a while since I purchased
&gt; spark plugs!  Now that we own a wasserboxer I thought I'd replace the
&gt; rotor, cap, wires and plugs.  Did you guys know that spark plugs now
&gt; have THREE &quot;prongs&quot;!  Never even heard of these critters before!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there using these 3 pronged jobbers?  Comments?  What do
&gt; three prongs do for you?


first, not all spark plugs have 3 prongs, and two, its nothing new..:)

(i remember reading in something somewhere that a 3 pong version was 
available for my 75's engine, back at sompoint..:)

the mazda rotary engines have ALWAYS used 4 prong plugs, for whatever reason.

i presume that it gets a mch better and hoter spark...(the NGK 4prongs 
for a 82 mazda rx-7 will run ya over 8 dollars EACH! good thing it onyl 
has four...:)

later...david
