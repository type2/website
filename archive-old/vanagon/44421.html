I'd really like to find something like this too, but I don't know if such a
beast exists.  I kind of doubt it.  It's technically illegal to mess with
your speedometer, but it's one of those things that nobody will care about
in an older VW bus.  :)

&gt;Also Can I replace my oil sensor with something that will tell me actual
&gt;preasure and tempurature? Does VDO make a guage, can I get it with a tach
&gt;meter, or could I at least get fuel, oil preasure, oil tempurature,
&gt;speedomitor, odomitor w/ reset, and tach all on three guages which would
&gt;fit nicelt in my dash, that's why I want VDO.

You can get oil pressure and temperature gauges in 2-1/16&quot;.  Can't fit them
in the dash without custom work.  There is tons of information on this in
the archives, as it has been discussed on this list many times.
