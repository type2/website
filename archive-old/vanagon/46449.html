Another variation of Vanagons

&gt;And I?  With my aircooled BUT fuel injected AND Hall-Effected Vanagon?

My '80 was built in August '79 and has FI and NO Hall stuff, just a 
std distributor.  It's closer to my '76 bus mechanically.  It's a 
non-California bus in California, which throws parts and mechanics 
another loop.  Also someone told that it has a diesel muffler!
