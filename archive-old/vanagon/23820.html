Subject:      Re: Black junk on left side of engine

On Wed, 30 Aug 95 08:48:05 CDT you said:
&gt;I happened to be looking in my '87 vanagon engine compartment yesterday and
&gt;noticed what appeared to be black sticky junk splattered on the left side of
&gt;my engine compartment. Not alot of the stuff, just enough to be noticable and
&gt;of course it caught my attention. Does anyone know what this stuff is and where
&gt;it came from? So far my engine appears to be running normally, no bells and
&gt;whistles going off in the idiot light/gauge area. Am I worried over nothing, or
&gt;is it the dreaded piston-slap/disintegrating solenoid/leaking oil-cooler/head
&gt;gasket coolant-leaking-into-the-oil problem?

possibilities:
- is it anywhere near your ignition coil?? sometimes these things leak, and
  the stuff inside is black and tarry. but if this is happening, the coil
  will die pretty soon ... and the car will just stop. period. no ignition.
- when you say &quot;on the left side&quot;, do you mean INSIDE the engine compartment?
  like, you have to lift up the hatch to see it? it's remotely possible that
  you ran over some freshly resurfaced roads somewhere and it spattered up
  from the wheels. if this is the case, you should also be able to see it
  spattered on some other parts underneath the car.
- cv joint boot-fart. :)  sometimes, the joints get hot enough and the grease
  gets juuuussst right, and the grease kinda &quot;poots&quot; out of the end of the
  cv joint boot. when it does this (which is not a particularly &quot;good&quot; thing
  to have happen), the axle is spinning and that stuff can go all over the
  place. again, if this is what happened, you should be able to see more of
  it spattered in other places under the car.

i would suggest looking up under the car and seeing what you can see ... it
might give more information as to where the stuff came from. good luck.
