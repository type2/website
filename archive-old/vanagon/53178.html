Lionel Tun,

&gt;&gt;The catalogue is very interesting 'reading' and I thought it was well worth
the GB#6.50 (including postage) that it cost.&lt;&lt;


 I don't have that catalogue and good very well use it. Maybe I missed the
particulars in a previous list as I don't get the opportunity to read all of
each and every one. Would you please tell me the address where I can get this
catalogue? Our '82 westy needs some interior miscellaneous parts. Thanks.
