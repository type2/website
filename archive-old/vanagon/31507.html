Subject: catalog you'll ALL love


After a tip from someone on the 'net, I ordered and just received a catalog
that's definitely the most interesting I've seen in years.  It's called
Jade Mountain in Boulder, CO, and their phone numbers are:

800.442.1972
or
303.449.6601

A bit like a very distant cousin of a catalog many of you know I like called
Real Goods, Jade Mt. features things having to do with alternative energy
and power sources, and as such, is naturally of interest to people in
VW campers.  Their products seem to come from all over the world.  Every few
pages or so, there's some wonderful item which I fantasized should have been
invented before, but was never prior to receiving this catalog ever able
to locate for sale.  Many of the things are quite innovative.  If the
product itself is not innovative, then chances the source it works off of
is.  A sampling of their more unusual stuff is:

instant, on-demand, tankless hot water heaters which work off of things 
   other than the usual (things other than LP or elect.)
all sorts of very unusual insulation and barriers and reflectors
submersible wood-fired (water-cooled) fireboxes
boat showers
woodstove water heaters
regular tanked water heaters which are fired by:  wood, alcohol, diesel, 
   cow chips, etc.
point of use water heaters
stovepipe catalytic combustors
fans which draw practically zilch power
spin dryers which remove up to 2/3 more water from clothes than your
   typical washing machine
washers which run off of 117V, able to run on a small modified sine-
   wave inverter
units which wash and dry in the same appliance
pressurized hand-crank 2 minute clothes washers (non-electric)
super insulated reefers and freezers, some even entirely solar powered!
solar overs/cookers
12V vacs
solar gate openers
an iron which runs on Coleman fuel
hand washing machines
things to trap heat from the dryer
things to make your own dc reefer from scratch
long range telephones going up to 65 miles from service point
incinerator toilets, plus composting, low flush, air flushers, etc.
water storage tanks and cisterns, with devices to catch rain water, etc. 
unusual items for showers/grey water stuff
unusual water purifyers and distillers
photoelectric smoke detectors
bar shampoo
a DC soldering iron
a cassette players which can be powered by hand cranking, if you're lacking
   batteries, or an AC power source
lots of TVs/VCRs which are AC/DC, also amplifiers
TONS of solar stuff, like panels, chargers, meters, batteries
about a dozen types of solar lanterns
solar lights
solar car kits
solar radios
solar mosquito repellers
the most unusual types of light bulbs I've ever seen (and I thought I'd seen
   everything peculiar in this department)
every type of inverter you can imagine, ditto transformers, converters, adapters, etc.
wind generators
hydro electric stuff
unusual generators and motors
a salt-water generator, featuring power for 40-60 hours from 1 cup of table salt,
    weighs 4 lbs, and produces 400 mA at 10V, 850 mA at 8V, etc.  
a kerosens hot water heater
whole village sized solar ovens and grinders.  
huge amounts of lite fixtures, limited only by your imagination
system components galore
ditto safety components
things to regulate types of voltage I didn't even know existed
solar well pumps, also pressure and surface pumps
all sorts of things on alternative transportation
shelters
stuff on straw bale houses
books, books, books
biogas stuff

I originally requested this catalog from their e-mail address, which is:

jade-mtn_at_indra_dot_com

It took MONTHS to receive, but was well worth the wait.  Perhaps you'll have
better luck by phoning them at the number I listed above, dunno.   They also
say they have a web site, which I've not yet checked out:
