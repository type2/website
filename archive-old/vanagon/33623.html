Subject: Re: Resto's and Museums

My take on this thread is in agreement with those who say to drive the
vehicles as well as doing to your vehicle as you see fit. The '67 &quot;Westy
Resto from Hell&quot; has been exaggerated a little for some comedy sake and is
probably a typical restoration. Paula and I plan to drive the bus on a daily
basis. It will not be 100% concourse stock and is not intended to be. It is
a camper. We will camp in it often. I have made efforts to do as nice of a
job as possible as a personal challenge, for a chance to learn, and as a
sign of love toward my wife. (She probabally could care less about the
details). I want to avoid going back through and fixing tweeks that weren't
done right. It will be Paula's daily most of the time. &lt;eek&gt; Paula drives
like Mr. Magoo so I'm already bracing myself for the inevitable. 
I have seen too many buses that are pumped up to be the king sh*t and have
obvious glaring problems. Example: peach and white 15 window at the
Barett/Jackson Auction last weekend asking $20k with cracks and bondo around
the front door hinges. The bus had BB safaris and a cheesy interior.  As an
artist and a detail person, I try to find the items that can be found and
will make a difference in the overall quality of the bus. Some of the detail
items are fun to find as a challange and are usually found for the same
dollars as the used up items that came with the bus.  The &quot;need&quot; for NOS is
bull. If the part is needed and can't be found outside of NOS then OK as
long as larceny is not involved. The '67 resto from hell will most likely be
the only one that I will do to this detail and that quite alright in my
mind. I hope to be out camping and having fun!
 The '57 single cab is a rusty POS in the back half  but runs great and
hasn't cost much at all. It will end up staying in a similar condition and
will be maintained mechanically and used as a truck.
The point is to have fun and enjoy life. Common sense is another concept. If
*you* don't perceive something to be a balance of fun, common sense, safety,
or affordability- then don't do it.
