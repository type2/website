Subject: meat wagon arrived

today the meat wagon arrived.  For those of you who forgot/whatever, it is a
63 delivery van, tomato red (original colour) with logos of Hausmann's meat,
 of Everett, Washington.   The company went out of business in 67, and it was
bought by one of the drivers.   It ended up in a shed with 7300 miles , no
motor or trans.
a friend bought it at the estate sale of the driver.

He showed up today with it on a trailer, pulled by his vanagon synchro double
cab.  My messed up back (remember the accident? always look behind you when
ou turn left)prevented me from doing much, but between him and my SO a spare
trans was installed quickly, just enough bolts so the meat wagon rolls!

This bus is so straight it's amazing.  The nose is perfect.  The driver's
door is worn badly, and so is the back hatch.   It's really wierd to be in a
bus with all the panelling up front.

Well, hope to get it running soon......
