Subject: Anyone want to trade 15 inch for 14 inch?

I have 4 14 inch 5 bolt rims - I think they are 5.5 inch wide 
but I am not sure.  What I would love to do is to trade them
with the tires on them for some 15 inch rims with tires on.
The easisest thing would be to do this with someone in the SF
Bay area and just get together and swap them (my rims and tires
are what is holding the 59 bus off the ground).

The tires on the 14 inch rims are:

M+S Sumitomo HTR4 P185 60 R 14 82H Steel Belted Radial
4 Ply 1 poly, 2 steel, 1 nylon
Ratings:
Treadwear 320
Traction A
Temp A

I would guess the tires have about 5 - 10k miles on them.
Still plenty of tread, and worn evenly.

Any takers?  Any ideas? Thanks for reading!
