Zaphod asked in a public post:

 &gt; Bob H., do you have any sermons on the subject planned/already written?&lt; 

Bob J,

I have written a comprehensive article covering the overhaul of the outboard
gearboxes.  It is presently appearing as a two-parter in 'Funkengroovin'
magazine.  I didn't know 'Funkengroovin' was a commercial organization when I
agreed to let them print it.  I will post it to the list after it has
appeared in their magazine.  The delay in posting has to do with the standard
contract for serial publications called 'first North American serial rights,'
which is what a writer sells, the writing itself remains the property of the
author for his lifetime, thanks to the revised US copyright law.

I donate my articles to not-for-profit organizations such as this list and
the typical VW club newsletter, just as hundreds of others donate their time,
talents and computer space to make such organizations work.  But if someone
wants to make a living off of me I figure it's only fair they tell me that up
front, and that I get a piece of the action. ('Funkengroovin's cover-price is
more than DB&amp;HVW.)  In this case I got a T-shirt, which I must now declare on
my income tax.  (Yup, that's how it works.)  It's hard to eat a T-shirt.

-Bob
