&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what the differences are between the various colours of
&gt;&gt;torsion bars as regards the different models of bay window VWs?

On Bay Window 68-79 Models, Red or Brown Bars are Standard Load Duty.  Heavy
Duty Bars, normally installed on Ambulances and most Commercial Models are
Green as per Factory Microfiche.  Green bars are very difficult to locate :(
..

My .005 cents worth :)
