Subject: Intro/Bus wanted

Hi,

	I'm new to the list and looking for a bus.  I've had several 
buses, but found them hiding in a patch of weeds or peeking out from 
behind the back of a house.  Cruising the local backroads, using  
this same technique for the past few weeks has yielded zero buses!  My 
wife says &quot;Be patient the time must not be right,&quot; but I say my search 
area must not be big enough, use the internet!  This is what I want:

Wanted: '71 or earlier Bus.  Not particular about bubble or split window.  
$750 budgeted, but will gladly pay less.   Funky engine, paint, or stripped 
cargo area is OK.  I'll pass on wrecks, rollovers, and rust buckets.  I 
live in northwest North Carolina, so vehicle should be nearby-western NC, 
eastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia.  If you have a nice bus that 
just happens to need some work AND a new home, contact me.

BTW, if you do contact me about a bus, I'd appreciate it if you'd push it 
into a patch of weeds or park it behind the house before I swing by. :)

Thanks.
