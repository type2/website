&gt; &gt;still $25 for a set of Chinese combination wrenches up

Not to dis Harbor Freight, but be very cautious when buying cheaper
tools.  I once bought a set of impact sockets that were cheaper that
Craftsman or Snap-On and they broke on 2nd use SENDING PEICES OF METAL
EVERYWHERE, I'm just happy nothing hit my face.  Sorry to say, you get
what you pay for.
