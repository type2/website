Subject: Victory is mine (T2) and fool injection ?

Yes! I figured out the problem with the Lima Bean, the hose on the 
 Auxiliary air regulator that taps into the &quot;S&quot; pipe had popped out. I 
 plugged it in and now we have idle Yeah for me!
With fool injection I noticed that all the hoses that move air a 
 friction fit. Has anyone taken time to clamp these down? I drive off 
 the beaten path quite a bit and I think that it would be cheap 
 insurance against hose poppage and vacuum leaks. Any thoughts?

TIA
