Subject: need hints to remove rear 73 drums

I'm still getting the 73 bus up and rolling.  I think MAYBE i may be
forgiven in another week or two.

But right now i need to get at my back brakes.  Muir says just take the
wheel off, remove the 2 little bolts and pull the drum off and look at the
brakes.  My drums wouldn't pull off.  It seemed so simple, but i should
have known there was some sort of catch.  Can someone give me some hints?

I promise I'll never neglect my bus again..
