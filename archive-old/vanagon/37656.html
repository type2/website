Subject: should we repair pits in head?


We are replacing the head gaskets in our '87 Westy.
This is our first experience with a water-cooled
volkswagon and would like to know what experienced
owners recommend about the small pits in the head?

Should they be filled?   If so, what process and product
do you recommend?

Thanks in advance.
