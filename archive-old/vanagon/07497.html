Subject: Bus models

&gt;	However, the guy who responded to my plea on rec.models.scale
&gt;says that someone sells both the basic Revell kit and a detail package
&gt;of rear fenders, bumpers, nose emblem, tires, wheels, etc. He says
&gt;the ad can be found in the back of Scale Auto Enthusiast. I'll forward
&gt;the hot info tomorrow when he sends it to me.
&gt;
&gt;	Bill

Way to go, Bill!
