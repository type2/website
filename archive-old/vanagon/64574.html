&gt; &gt; Some time ago I posed the following problem:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Van starts normally when cold.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. When hot, just cranks, no firing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. Sometime will start if I open throttle all the way first.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. Will start when I put it on BOTH batteries, causing it to crank just
&gt; &gt; a little bit faster.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Got answers all over the place.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lived with the problem some more.  Then when poking around, trying to
&gt; &gt; figure out why it was running rich I noticed the idle screw was rather
&gt; &gt; far out even for having to run the AC.  Hmm... maybe the timing is off.
&gt; &gt; Retarded the timing and vola, the starting problem was solved!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I still can't figure out is why.  We all know that if it fires too
&gt; &gt; early when starting it is hard to turn it passed TDC.  But in this case
&gt; &gt; it cranked just fine.  ???
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Closest correct answer award goes to whoever said 'Check distributor'.
&gt; &gt; 'Course, he went on to say check everything else, too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, running fine now.  More insight appreciated.
