&gt; 					...I found it annoying
&gt; when I got my bus that the side door cannot (apparently) be
&gt; unlocked without the key.

 I thought this was &quot;fixed&quot; after '72, when the design was changed such that
the key fitted into lock cylinder that was seperate from the handle. The key
then operated the mechanism which the wee catch inside also works to effect the
locking?

 At any rate you should be able to dismantle the mechanism from the inside-
the key in the early locks engages a tab that prevents the handle turning- so
if you unscrew the handle and remove it you will disengage the (key actuated)
lock. You should still be able to operate the internal mechanism if it has
been engaged during the mucking about. A replacement handle from a junkyard
would just screw on (there's a shaft that passes right through the door).

&gt; ..and while I'm at it, how easy is it to replace the
&gt; window crank (on the front door)?

 I'm not sure about this. If you only need the handle it can just be unscrewed
after lifting the plastic trim covering off it. I can't advise if you need to
know how to replace the winding mechanism, sorry.

Cheers,
        W.
