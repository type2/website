Subject:      Rear Seatbelts - 89&gt;syncro&lt;GL

G'day Volks,

I want to replace the rear lapbelts (LHS&amp;RHS) with shoulder belts, the Bently
bible has a good description of the job, however, when i attempted to do this
on my previous van (86GL) i could not get the belts from the VW dealer (got
some - but wrong ones after 3 month &quot;boat ride&quot;.

Any suggestions from the list as to alternate sources, or reliable VW source
- any of you done this ?

(I suspect the rest of the world except USA had standard shoulder belts all
over....;-()
