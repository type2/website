Subject: RE: Start/no start


&gt;Well tonight I didn't heed the warnings and now the 81 sits over at the
&gt;church parking lot  acting as if it doesn't even have a starter after 
having
&gt;happily motored over an hour earlier for a basketball game. Power 
everywhere
&gt;but the starter. Happened a couple of times prior but started after 5 or 6
&gt;tries so I guess I got cocky.
&gt;
&gt;Am I using selective memory when I seem to recall that the fix for this was
&gt;nothing more  than cleaning the connections at the starter? Does that sound
&gt;right and are there more involved possibilities?


Yes.

Whacking it with a large wrench helps too.
