Subject: Re: Monza (sp?) muffler

&gt;Evan Estern inquires about Monza mufflers. I installed one on my '75
&gt;Camper back in August. Cost about $115 at the Bus Boys. I am disappointed
&gt;with the quality. They were painted with cheap, non-heat resistant paint
&gt;which burned off and stunk like hell. Corrosion ensued immediately. I spent
&gt;the best part of an afternoon derusting the thing and repainting it with
&gt;BBQ paint, but that didn't help much. Maybe the $175 ones are better. Ask
&gt;the sales clerk about their origin.
&gt;
&gt;
Well I just got a extractor system with a single quiet pack for muy new 
engine, and I think that I have the same type paint on it.  My plan is to 
sandblast all it off and go back with this &quot;hot paint&quot; which has to dry and 
then be cured for 1 hour at 650 deg F.  Anyone know how hot the extractor 
will get?  I don't think that I can get 650 deg in my kitchen.  I would hate 
to think of the smell :-(.  Any ideas?
