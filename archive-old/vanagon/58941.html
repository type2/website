Subject: VW Windows 95 Theme

It's been a long while since I posted about this, but my Volkswagen Windows
95 Theme is finally available for downloading! It's at
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/fun/windows_vw_theme (no .html suffix), where you'll
find the .zip file and illustrated installation instructions. If you don't
have a .zip decompression program, a link to one is also on this site.

Possible problems:

Some of the sounds may reference to themes you haven't installed. This is
   because I don't have enough sounds/cursors to make this a standalone
theme yet.  Feel free to submit cursors and icons. In the meantime, you can
solve the problem by making sure you have all of the themes distributed
with Plus! installed on your system OR by manually changing all of the
cursor and sound references to what you do have.

Feedback welcomed.

- Jennifer
