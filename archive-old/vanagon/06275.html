So Joel Walker says:
&gt; victim? victim? ha! why, iffen you'd ever filled your face with Momma's
&gt; home-cooked Possum-Pot Pie, or Crispy Crow-kettes, or Kudzu-quiche ...
&gt; well, you'd just &quot;Squeel like a pig!&quot; yourself! it's so gooooood, it'll
&gt; make you slap your grandma! (cause she can't cook like that!).
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that would take some diggin', so those pies better be good!  ;)

&gt; 
&gt; beats the hell outa rutabagas, parsnips, or whatever that celery-stuff y'all
&gt; make pies out of up there. :)
