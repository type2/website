Subject: Keep those donations coming!!!

Howdy folks,

We're still around $500 short of our goal for the list fund drive, so if
you haven't send us a check yet, please do so.  If every one of the 700
subscribers of the list sent us $3, we'd hit our goal.  (Since everyone
can't do this, however, donations of $5, $10, or more are welcome and
appreciated.)

We're up to $1500, and our cost estimates are as follows:

 $  725        LISTSERV software (manages list, formats messages)
    400        LSMTP software (sends mail)
    230        Monitor
    150-300    RAM (if needed)
    300-400    HD
    --------------------------------------------------------------
 $  1805-2055  Total

(We've had a Pentium server donated to us!)

Send the checks payable to Ron Lussier to:

     Vanagon
     c/o Ron Lussier
     10164 Parkwood Drive #8
     Cupertino, CA  95014-1533

Thanks!
Coyote
