Subject:  About that sticker...

Yes, all of the posted ideas would seem to be excellent ones.  Window
sticker is definitely preferred to the bumper style IMHO. As a source
idea...aren't all the Type II's displayed in those cute little cartoons
that border some illustrations and chapter headings in Muir's manual?  (at
least the 25th anniv. Ed.) I know there's a pop-top Westy..a 18/23 window
Microbus...a Panel van/pickup...and er...the Combi as well. 

Anyway, couldn't some enterprising technophile copy and enlarge these 
smallish cartoons then scan them for reproduction.?

	(yes, I know all about copyright stuff...if we're that concerned
	we *could* contact JMP for the rights.)

This way we'd have an easy visual source of all the Type II's.  Just a 
suggestion.

Muir's manual, I can't put it
down!)
