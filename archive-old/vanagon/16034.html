&gt; &gt;              Replace Fuel Injectors and Component
&gt; 
&gt; the big question I have about this harry and the rest of you guys is whether
&gt; there are now a new kind of injector seals and that we have to avoid buying
&gt; some of the old stock items from before then began manufacturing upgraded parts.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have a clue on this one?

Hi Derek.  I phoned the dealer, and they didn't know all the 
particulars when I called.  They said in a couple weeks they would be 
more informed.  

One question, though... did anybody get a recall notice like I did in 
the US??  or is this a Canadian recall only?

Harry.
