Well the lug nuts I reported on never did come off.  After a 2 weeks of
WD-40 soaking, tapping, and tugging I took it to a nearby service station
where we commenced hex-stripping and chiseling.  Now it's off to the dealer
to get the rims pulled, replace studs and lug nuts as required.  Of course
the mirror is still out of action too.  And changing the oil today  I
noticed a badly cracked exhaust header.  Such is life with a 140k mile vehicle.
