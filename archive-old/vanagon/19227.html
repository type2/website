&gt;What are you all's experiences with
&gt;getting stopped/harassed by police for driving a van?

Several years ago, I used to drive a one-ton white Ford van as my
everyday car. One night I was on my way home from laying out a road
rally in western Mass. On the entrance ramp to the Mass Pike in
Sturbridge, I saw the blue lights and pulled over. Damn, I knew I
should have paid attention to the absurdly low speed limit on the ramp!
Next thing I know, a very agitated state cop started rapidly (rabidly?)
barking something at me which of which I understood only &quot;....your
wheel...&quot; I thought he meant something about a tire or wheel so I leaned
out the window to look and next thing I know I was getting a up-close-and-
personal look at the insides of the barrels of a sawed-off shotgun. He
yelled again, this time slow and clear enough for me to understand,
&quot;Put your hands on the wheel!&quot;
Knowing that a shotgun wins most if not all arguments I did as told.
&quot;Do you have any firearms or explosives?&quot; Say what?
&quot;No, sir&quot; says I.
&quot;Step out of the vehicle and walk around to the front.&quot; No argument from me.
&quot;Place your hands on the front, feet apart.&quot; I got frisked, noticing there
were now about six cruisers around me and everything was bathed in blue.
&quot;Where are you coming from?&quot; He barks.
&quot;I was just at [insert name of bar here]&quot;
&quot;Yes, I saw the vehicle there.&quot; says another cop. What's going on here, I'm
wondering. Good thing I had only a couple of beers.
&quot;Ummm...do you have a warrant?&quot;, I meekly inquire.
&quot;We have probable cause.&quot;
&quot;What's this all about?&quot; I ask, as I hear stomping, pounding, etc. from
inside my van.
&quot;We'll tell you in a minute.&quot;
&quot;There's nothing.&quot; said one of the search party.
Now the first guy spoke. &quot;We have reason to believe a large quantity of
drugs will be transported through this area. Your van meets the description
of that vehicle.&quot; They offered a brief apology and left me to go on my way,
heart still pounding.

So, Ben, that's my story...
