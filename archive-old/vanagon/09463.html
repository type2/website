Subject: More about 1600cc Vanagon Engine swap...


	It's me again, the nut who wants to find a 1600cc Vanagon 
engine case with cast-in oil filter provision for my Beetle...

	I got one thoughtful reply yesterday which raised the question 
of flywheel compatability. The issue raised was the difference in 
clutch sizes (228mm Vanagon, vs 200mm Beetle); therefore, would the 
case and flywheel bolt up to my Beetle tranny?

	I'm quite certain the answer is- YES! Here's why...

1. In Tom Wilson's &quot;How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot;, 
(about p.43) he says that ALL 12V air cooled engine flywheels have 132 
teeth. The *clutch disc* diameter changes between the T-I/II/III 
engine and the Vanagon, but the *outer diameter* of the flywheel 
appears to remain the same. Of course, a trip to the wreck yard with a 
ruler could answer this question.

2. In the Haynes '80-83 Vanagon book, where one can see pictures of 
the engine case I'm seeking, the flywheel looks to be a standard T-1 
style; that is, a single BIG gland nut attached to a standard T-1 
style crank. The 1600cc Vanagon may indeed have a special flywheel 
that incorporates the T-1 style gland nut and a 228mm clutch, but 
that's cool since I could just use a standard Beetle flywheel instead.

3. I've read many accounts of mixing 'n matching T-1 and T-4 engine 
cases with T-1 and Bus/Vanagon trannies, particularly in off-road 
race cars. Again, a trip to the wreck yard can confirm this.

	Incidentally, a few years ago I corresponded with a VW dealer 
in the UK to determine the price of a *NEW* 1600cc Vanagon engine 
case. I can still recall the shock I felt when I read the price- over 
$1000, at the exchange rates back then. Yeeeeeeaaaaahhhh!

	Obviously, if someone in Europe, Australia, etc. can find me 
one of these cases used, in good condition, I'd be expecting to pay a 
lot less for it. I don't want to decide on the max price I'll pay 
unless/until someone contacts me with a firm lead on one of these 
things- that would be too rational, which clearly *I* am not.

	Happy Motoring!
