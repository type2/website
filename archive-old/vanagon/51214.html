sometime in 1996 you said:
&gt;      Check the laws in your state! H4 bulbs where to bright in
&gt;      most state to be legal, until the mid 1980's!

nope. :) (a) Alabama has no such laws concerning &quot;brightness&quot; of headlights.
which is why cars run around down here with ONE headlight that is glowing
dimly in the night. (b) it says on the box &quot;SAE/DOT Approved&quot; and &quot;Now U.S.
Legal!&quot;.
