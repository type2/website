Subject: 2.0 ltr 914 motor for sale

I have a '73 2.0 ltr Porsche 914 engine for sale.  $575 It is the most 
powerful aircooled motor VW ever made!!!  It runs well, and has the fuel 
injection.  I would include all the sheet metel for someone to put this in a 
BUS.  Changing the sheet metel is all that is necessary, then its a bolt in. 
 I live around 40 min NW of Philly.  (610)323-6261
