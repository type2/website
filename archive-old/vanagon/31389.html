Subject: Questions on my new Camper!

Hello all.. Merry Christmas, Happy Chanauka, Happy Kwanzaa, and any 
others I forgotten...

As I stare into the blizarrd my eyes still fixate on my new member of the 
household... my 71 westfalia camper.   

I would like to start getting catalogs and I am not sure where to look.. 
I would like to get some fixtures, a better refridgerator and posibbly a 
nice stove unit... 

also, is it better to replace the pop-up tent, or to simply try to repair 
what I have.

Also.. my big question is how the water pump works... I have no clue 
where the water goes in, how it connects, or anything... Any help?

Thank you very much for all of your posts, including the ones not to 
me... it has broadned my knowlege and has gotten me past my bug fixation 
and into the type II fixation...
