Subject: Battery charger and part number.

Bonjour,

At a Canadian Tire I had see a small battery charger that is mean to be fix near the battery in a car. I was asking myself, if it could be fixed near the plug for the refrigerator (with longer wires) to recharge the battery each time te Westy is on 11o volts. Any inputs. This thing was 40$ Can.

Also, is someone knows if licence plate lights assembly hab been changed between 1980 and 1985 ?

Thanks

Westy 85
