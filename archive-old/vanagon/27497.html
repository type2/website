Subject: elect cars/pollution


Let's not forget to take into consideration the miles per gallon a car
is capable of getting.  Or how much more fuel efficiency you can derive
by driving with a lightfoot vs a leadfoot.  Or by going slower.  If you can
by doing the latter increase your fuel efficiency by as little as 20%,
haven't you thereby decreased your gas consumption by that same amount,
and polluted the air that much less?

If you are really zealous about this and own a super high-efficiency
fuel-economic car like, for example the Honda Civic VX, where in some states
not requiring cat. converters taking a bit of toll on the mileage, you
can realistically hope to encounter things like 55-60 mpg, think of
the savings there.  You'd have to drive your VW bus 3 or 4 times as
much as the civic to creat the same amount of pollutants.  Since it's
likely you would not drive a bus more than a commuter car, it also
makes some sense to look at mpg ratings, I feel. 

Remember, doing things like avoiding unnecessary reving, jack-rabbig
starts, full-throttling, and going fast (especially over 55) has to
potential to not only save you a significant bit of fuel $$s, but to make
the air you breathe a little cleaner, whether you are in an urban or
a rural setting.
