Subject: First EV Ding 


Well, I've had my '95 EV Camper since February 1, and yesterday it
got it's first ding. Not a ding really, but it's first non-warranty
damage that makes it a used vehicle in my mind.

I've been very happy that the beast fits in the garage. There's about
1 inch vertical clearance, and maybe 2-3 inches horizontal clearance.
Yesterday I didn't quite pull it up far enough before closing the 
garage door. Imaging my horror when I heard this shearing, breaking sound
and the automatic door safety stop....

The rear wiper spray unit sheared right off and broke into about 5 pieces.
I'm in severe dread at what VW could charge for this measly little plastic
part. I guess I'll find out soon enough.
