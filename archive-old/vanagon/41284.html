&gt; Hi all, just a quick question.  I'm working on getting my '66 Westy ready
&gt; for the road and I was just wondering if anyone out there still has a
&gt; governor on their carb.  I mean, it was put there for a reason, right?  At
&gt; what RPM is it supposed to intervene?  If I decide to take it off, it
&gt; looks like I just need to take the whole spacer-like thing out from between
&gt; the carb and the intake manifold and then get shorter studs for the carb.

I still have one.  It works on the priciple of kicking in at a certain CFM,
not RPM.  I say leave it on there - your carb prolly won't clear the generator,
and those cheap aluminum spacer look like crap.  If ya want, set it real high
or something, but leave it on.
