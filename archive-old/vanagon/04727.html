Subject: Re: Will Volvo seats go in my bus?


Don't know if they'll fit...but if they do...BEWARE!!! With the introduction
of Volvo parts in any car, its a scientific fact that said car will begin to
spontaneously generate &quot;Mondale/Ferraro....Dukakis/Bentsen....Save the
Whales&quot;.... and even Yacht Club stickers...
