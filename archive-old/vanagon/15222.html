Subject: [A] wtb CAMPER BUS in SE PA

I'm looking for a camper to drive to Alaska in '96.  I don't want a
cream-puff, just something that's going to be reliable.  MINOR problems
are ok (I'm reasonably mechanically inclined and don't mind doing some
repairs myself) but, please, no basket cases!  If you have what I want,
please e-mail me.
