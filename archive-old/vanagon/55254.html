&gt; I am interested in finding out about 12V space heaters for my van, 
&gt;  preferably one with a low electrical draw.  Any info about this would be 
&gt;  appreciated.

By current Damark catalog has a 12V heater rated at 1100 BTU and priced at
$99.+
I'm not sure of the power draw of this unit, but remember, low electrical
draw will equal low heat output.
