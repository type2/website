Subject: Rear Suspension dampers (buffers) on '67 Westy

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.


Before throwing another question out to the list, I would like to
thank all those VeeDubbers out there who sent along all the various
pieces of info in response to my VIN No. question (I still haven't
solved the puzzle of why my Chassie No. is 247016777 which indicates a
'67 Deluxe MicroBus is in direct contradiction with the fact that Ras
Bulli Split has only three windows per side aft of the doors, but does
have the Chrome emblem, etc...) This question is still open....

My new problem has arisen in result of my current &quot;suspension renewal&quot;
phase of this never ending restoration.  According to Bentley, the
presence of &quot;additional buffers&quot; on the rear suspension, just behind
the shocks (FIF), occurs only on the 1 tonne bus (and not on the more
common 3/4 tonne) [ As an aside, this also has contributed to my
chassie no. dilemma as I am under the impression that the Standard
MicroBus has only a 3/4 tonne carrying capacity].

Anyhow, I ordered new buffers/dampers from VW (at 45$ each ...for a
chunk of rubber), but the driver's side mounting cup (on the drive
shaft sleeve) is missing the centre stud that the rubber buffer pushes
onto [the passenger side is present].  These mounting cups appear to
be bolted on the outside end, but tack welded to the sleeve on the
inboard end.  The microfiche at the VW dealer appears to indicate that
the entire sleeve must be replaced in order to replace the
damper/buffer mount (VW only sells the sleeve with the mounting cup
attached as a replacement part).

My question: &quot;Is it possible to remove the broken damper/buffer mount
and tack a new one in place?&quot;  Will this hold?  And finally, does
anyone have this part (or an entire driver's side sleeve) in good
condition that they would be willing to sell/trade?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks....Oh my,

Roy
