&gt; Although I love our 1976, and adore the 1986 Westy, I have to admit, I do
&gt; worry about the front end &quot;crumple-ability&quot; of our vehicles. Neither

&gt; are bunches of you who have slammed into the back of a semi- at 60 mph and
&gt; lived to giggle, lemme know.

Hi: My dad borrowed my 64 single cab years ago and while going through a
intersection the woman coming from his right didn't even slow down for
her stop sign. Dad din't have a stop sign and all of a sudden she was in
front of him and he was going 35 mph. She was in a Chev Century or
Citation or something like that and when he hit her side he rolled her
over a full 360 degrees back onto her wheels. Then a 64 Mustang came
along and hit the Chev. It wasn't too far from my house and I went up
and got the bus and drove it home. They had to tow both other cars off.
Dad hit his head above the windshield and was ok-just a bump. The
insurance co bought the single cab(for a handsom price I might add). I
was impressed how well the front end held up from such a crash.
