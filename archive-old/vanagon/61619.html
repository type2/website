&lt;&lt; I'm hoping a good &quot;Subject&quot; will get good answers...we'll see. 
 
 I'm a new bus owner (well, at least my wife is...;spankin' new '97 EV
 Camper &quot;Happy&quot;) who used to be an old bus owner (I had several Type IIs,
 but that &quot;old bus owner&quot; thing just doesn't sound right).
 
 Anyway, I once had a lovely bud vase (which was an option on the Type
 II) for putting fresh flowers on the dash (were you expecting
 otherwise?) and I'm now wondering if anyone has seen a more modern (but
 still attractive) substitute for Happy?
 
 There's nothing like fresh flowers on the dash... &gt;&gt;

Hmm...  where to stash your buds.... well, letsee... I've known people to
stash it above the headliner paneling in a westy, and howzabout....
Oh! ...You're talking about ROSE buds...  I thought...  uh..nevermind...  :&lt;)

Anyway - I think Rocky Mtn Motorworks is repro-ing the bud vases.
