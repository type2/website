Subject: New (rebuilt) Steering Rack $200 (one only)
Date: Tue, 13 May 1997 16:46:51 -0400

I ordered a rebuilt power steering rack for a customer who turned out not
to need it.  I already have an R.A. to return it to the distributor on
Friday morning, but thought I'd offer it up to the list at a cheap price
just in case anyone needs one.  
So if you need one, it's yours for $200 plus shipping if you let me know by
Thursday night.  This is a US-rebuilt rack, and carries a lifetime warranty
from the rebuilder.  There is a $150 core deposit, refunded upon return of
your old rebuildable rack.  Fits all years with power steering.
