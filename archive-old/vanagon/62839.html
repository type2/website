Subject: Re: Camping suggestions in Vermont New Hampshire?


There is also a island state park north of Burlington, which is accessible
for pedestrians and campers-on-foot -- by ferry. The sites are absolutely
stunning with great sunsets (on the western side-natch!). There is a
campstore and meeting / rec hall as well as courtesy docks, should you
arrive via your own boat.

Button Bay is also really neat, and can be very, very crowded in summer...
so plan on arriving early in the day if you hope to get a site.

There is a campground (cannot remember any of the names yet) just north of
Burlington burbs, but you really don't want to stay there. The sites sit
within about FOUR feet of each other!! With nothing in between! no bushes,
no trees, nadaaaa! just lots of big wheelies and boom boxes. Yuck. I was
the only vw in the place amongst the chevy trucks.

(I will try to remember the names of those two.)

On the Western (New York) side of the lake, one of the most beautiful
campgrounds is *Point Au Sables.* It juts out into the lake and there is a
beautiful black beach there (iron content). Lifeguards and all, or just
wade around the point to where the river comes into the lake, and have a
more private beach-- Campsites are right around the point on the water.
'
If you are in Vermont, you may take the ferry over from Burlington to
Plattsburg, and head South to Point Au Sables, or take the ferry to Port
Kent and head north. It's not very far, perhaps 6-10 miles either way.

The ferry to Port Kent is much smaller and less crowded. In any case, I
would recommend talking the ferry ride, even if you aren't ging to stay, as
it's worth the trip!

&gt;&gt;I live in South Burlington, Vermont.  It depends on how you come down from
&gt;&gt;Montreal.  You can come into the West side of Vermont down Rt 89 or the
&gt;&gt;East side down Rt 91.  Naturally there are local roads to follow if you
&gt;&gt;like the slower scenic routes.  91 makes it easier to get into the White
&gt;&gt;mountains and lake regions of New Hampshire and 89 gets you into the Lake
&gt;&gt;Champlain and heart of  Vermont.  I live by Lake Champlain.

&gt;John,
&gt;Thanks for the suggestions. I had been thinking about Lake Champlain, but
&gt;didn't know where specifically to go. I love Maritime Museums, so Button
&gt;Bay sounds great. We have a great mearitime museum here in SF, and a few
&gt;years ago I spent a couple days at Mystic Seaport, which was incredible.
&gt;Thanks again
