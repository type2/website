Subject: Driving the Subaru Vanagon

Last Thursday I drove 90 miles to Los Angeles to inspect &quot;fully loaded&quot; 86
Vanagon(this according to the car dealer).  When I got there, the &quot;fully
loaded&quot; van turned out to be a sripped down model with a dead battery.  On
my way back home I stopped in Palmdale, CA at Kennedy Engineered Products,
the home of Subaru Vanagon.  Mr. Hobart Kennedy, owner of same, greeted me
warmly as I talked of my interest in his pet prodject.  After answering some
intial questions about the van, he handed me the keys to modified 85 Vanagon
and suggested I take it for a spin.  I decided to &quot;go for it.&quot;  Everything
about the van looked &quot;stock,&quot; except the Subaru name plate above the
VanagonGL logo on the rear hatch.  Inside there was real oil temp and oil
presure gauge added to the front dash.  As I turned the key, the high
compression engine (9.5 to one) sprang to life.  In reality, I was struck by
the lack of usual vanagon engine noise(liffters begging for intial oil,
etc.).  As this van was an automatic, I expected whimpy performance as to
the exceleration pattern.  After backing the van carefully out of its
parking spot and slowly moving it off the Kennedy lot(Hobart, are you
looking out the window?), I decided to &quot;put my foot into it&quot; and &quot;go for broke.&quot;
The foot went one way, and the old torso was thrown back into the seat.
This was a vanagon with muscle!  I was very impressed with the van's
performance.  It was obvious that you would be able to stay in the left lane
climping those long steep grades we see in California.  At 135 hp vrs.
82hp(or 90hp on the 86-91), this was a van to enjoy for those long cruises,
we all like to take.  The temperature that day was 105, the oil tempeture
never got above 200.  I sorry, I did'nt pay any attention to the oil pressue
during my &quot;test flight.&quot;  The van handled very well, and as I pointed out
earlier, it was very responsive in exceleration.  The kickdown for passing
was very impressive.  I reluctantly drove back to Kennedy Products(maybe I
should keep the van for week(month)to give Mr. Kennedy my unbaised oppinon
about its performance?). Under the lift deck was an engine which fit
perfectly.  The only modification was a custom air flow hose which attached
to the air meter. Mr. Kennedy was very cordial and took me on a tour of his
shop and explained the evolution of the Subaru Vanagon.  (BTW, he said that
Subaru Corp. does not want any official association with firms using there
engine for other than being used in Subaru vehicles).  He pointed out the
flywheel conversion, the custom engine mount, the exhaust pipes molded for
the engine and the raditor with a front fill spout.  The raditor was unique
because it helps solve one of the most frustrating problems for waterboxer
owners; air in the cooling system.  With the front fill spout, Mr. Kennedy
showed me how you could purge the cooling system of air by blowing on a tube
connected to the rear water resorvior and having an assistant open the front
petcock valve(with the engine off).  Mr. Kennedy is still working with CA
smog people to get a Cat they will approve.  (Non-Californian's you don't
half to put up with this &quot;game.&quot;)  The instruction for installation was
detailed and complete right down to the wiring requirements for the Subaru
computer to work successfully on this conversion.  Cost: not firm yet,
($1800-$2200 range). Plus you provide the engine from your local wrecking
yard (about $1000 complete).  For more information contact Kennedy
Engineered Products at  (805) 272-1147.
