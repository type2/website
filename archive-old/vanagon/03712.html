&gt; My thanks for all the responses to my comments and questions. And I've

&gt; 
&gt; VANAGON STEERING WHEEL HEIGHT  When I began my search for a camper I had 
&gt; a close look at the vanagons and thought they were great untill I sat 
&gt; behind the wheel. The angle differs greatly from that of the bus. I'm a 
&gt; little over six feet tall and that wheel was right in my lap. When I
&gt; tried to move my feet from gas to break pedal or over to the clutch pedal 
&gt; it was an exercise in frustration. Is there any safe way of adjusting the 
&gt; height or angle of the steering wheel? Did VW eliminate this problem on 
&gt; the Eurovan by making it adjustable?


ours is not adjustable.

but, i am a few inches over 6 feet, and more significantly, well over 
450 lbs in weight. so therfore, have NO lap for the steering wheel to be 
in. i fill my own lap with ME. and i am still able to get in and drive, 
although if i set the seat to sit up straight the steering wheel rubs 
against the front of my blue jeans.

i am thinking of goint to a metal fabrication shop and haveing a new 
platform made for the seat to sit on that is about 2 inches lower and 
4 inches back farther when the seat is slid all the way back.

i still have to have it slide forward to allow my wife to drive the rig. 
she's about 5'3&quot;.

when we had the '69 bus i just took the seat out and threw down some 
foam pads to sit on. but i was the only one that would drive, at that time.
