Subject: FS orange plaid fabric from 74 westy

anybody need some orange plaid fabric from a 74' westy (gotta love it!)?? i
have the cushion for the pop up roof bed (approx. 4 feet wide by two feet
deep). I am tripping over this if somebody wants it cheap. I hate to see
such a cultural icon of 70's fabric just get tossed out. (the fabric looks
100% polyester!)
