&gt;This would fit in nicely with many of the plastic *people* I knew in L.A...
&gt;
&gt;And I lived there for 5 years-

Q.E.D.?   :^)


Seriously, I never saw a U.S. city yet that didn't have some. If you
find one, let me know... so I can send the plastic ones there and keep
this beautiful state for myself!
