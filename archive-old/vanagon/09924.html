&gt; 
&gt; complete interior set for 1972 westy; includes everything, yes everything,
&gt; even the kitchen sink haha! In very very good shape, too many pieces to list.
&gt; 
&gt; make reasonable offer.
&gt; 
&gt; 
  Does the &quot;Pa&quot; in the title mean that all this good stuff is in Pennsylvania?
