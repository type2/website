Subject: Eureka Springs, Arkansas VW Show

Hi All,

Sorry for the late notice:  August 25-27th

The NWAAVWO (NW Arkansas Association of VW Owners, or something to that 
effect) is having their VW show in Eureka Springs, AR-- a beautiful Ozark 
Mtn. town.  Many of us from Kansas City will be there along with many, 
many others.  For more details, email me or I'll followup with more 
specific info.
