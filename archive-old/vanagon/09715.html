Subject: Front floor mats


A friend of mine got great new front mats for her Ghia from a little 
Garage in Toronto free, for having a clutch replaced. (some Promo gimmicks
are actually useful).
The garage is now a Japanese import garage   :(   it changed owners,
but I'll bet that most cities have a VW garage that has promo floor mats

I'm sorry, I just realised that I'm Rambling, and you probably don't 
want to get a clutch job.
Best of luck in finding floormats with out the clutch job. :)


Cheers
