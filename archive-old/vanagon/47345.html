Subject: What in the Wide, Wide World of Sports is a Weekender?

     Due to popular request, here is the non-official explanation of the 
     Weekender option (which is also part of the 1985 Vanagon for sale I 
     mentioned yesterday):
     
     The Weekender package is an option that came with Vanagon GL's. The 
     Weekender essentially makes enough sleeping space for two adults in 
     the rear of the Vanagon. This is accomplished by folding the middle 
     seatbacks forward, folding the rear seat flat so the seat cushions 
     face upward, and a VW furnished cushion that sits over the engine 
     compartment. This results in a fairly large flat area for sleeping. 
     There is no stove, refrigerator, or pop-top, so the Weekender is kind 
     of a &quot;Westphalia Lite.&quot;
