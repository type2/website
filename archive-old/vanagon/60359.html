Subject: Auto Tranny Questions

OK here's one I don't often do, admit I know NOTHING about something, 
subject is auto transmissions, never owned one before the '90.  All 
seems pretty well with it, stall speed good by the book, changed the 
ATF, filter,  and found some nice sludge and some chunkies but some locals
in the know proclaimed the residue not unreasonable for an 80k mile 
tranny.  Now the VW specific questions.  She's losing a little ATF, 
comes out around the torque converter and get blown out the slots in 
the bellhousing leaving a teeny little bit of residue on the engine 
and tranny.  Does not seem to be fast (is not noticeable as far as a 
level falling sort of thing) but is ugly, coats the fuel line above 
the tranny etc.  I imagine it is the front seal, and I intend to 
replace, but the question is, what is the deal with this replaceable 
&quot;bushing&quot; shown in either Haynes or Bentley, the only replaceable 
part of the torque converter.  Is mine likely going to need 
replacing?  I'm hardly going to pull the damn thing out just to 
mic it and find out it's bad then wait 2 weeks for VW to get me one.  
So I seek any auto tranny gurus out there, do I order one or just the 
oil seal?

Thanks
John
