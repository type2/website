Subject: lost shirt in the mail


Richard,

I'm very happy with the shirt, the natural cotton color
is very nice. One comment thought on how you shipped my
shirt. The envolope was all crumpled, it looks at though
it had been through the war. The mail handling machines
must of had a good old time with it. I would recommend,
FWI that you use a more rigid envolope next time or use
the same envolope with a piece of cardboard in it. To be
honest, I'm suprised that only one shirt was lost.
