I'm not sure, but I think that if your vehicle doesn't have a special
California emissions sticker, you will have to pay a &quot;smog impact fee&quot;
or some such baloney.  Last time I heard of this was when my friend
tried to register an out-of-state car and they asked him for about $350.
I don't know if you will have to pass a smog check in addition.  What
kind of vehicle are we talking about here?
