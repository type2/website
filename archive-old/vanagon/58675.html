I'm glad you finally got the mail I sent you, Tom. Yes, you can keep those
articles as I had them copied especially for you and for your club because
you have been so helpful to me. I finally found the 16&quot; people!

Tell me when you are done with those articles and I can send you some more!

Great to get your scanned pictures. I am getting a scanner too soon so I can
send you some back.

&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;
&gt;cause I had got a message from Munich customs office that some mail from you 
&gt;is waiting for me, I went there this morning and after beeing qustioned like a 
&gt;latino immigrant without a passport, I figuered out that the only problem was 
&gt;that the parcel should have been declared as a &quot;personal gift&quot; or of a &quot;very 
&gt;low commercial value&quot; - that's all. Nevertheless it took me half  of the 
&gt;moning plus lunchbreak cueing and discussing that with the guy (sorry, 
&gt;&quot;officer&quot; is the correct word)

Funny. I hope it was worth it! Let me know what to put so next time I send
you stuff they won't do this. Do I just write: &quot;No commercial value&quot; on the
envelope?

&gt;Anyway, thank you so much for the copies - may I keep them for our archive or 
&gt;do you need them back ? A brif loke made it clear that we would never have got 
&gt;them in Europe without your help ! As it is a lot of material and reading in 
&gt;English takes me more time, than the same in German there is enough work for 
&gt;several rainy sunday afternoons.
&gt;
&gt;Your letter is dated 11th of March wich is more than six weeks back from now. 
&gt;I would guess that some of the questions you mentioned, have been answered so 
&gt;far by Tobias, somebody else or myself in the meantime. I propose to get 

Not really answered by anybody else yet. You seem to be the #1 source of 16&quot;
info at this point.

&gt;through the questions in your letter to come to a quick response and we enter 
&gt;into the deatails later, if necessary.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Standard syncro 16'' gear ratio&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; there was none! As all body versions like crew-cab, panels, Kombi, Westy, 
&gt;Caravelle etc. were offered as syncro 16'' the gear ratio depends on the 
&gt;version. There is a simpe way to figure out the richt gear ratio. From your 
&gt;tire dealer you will easily get date on the girth of your tires. If not figuer 
&gt;it out with the &quot;white-chalk and black pavement method&quot; Tom Fornham mentioned 
&gt;in one of the WWW Sites (don't know which at the moment). As a result you get 
&gt;the RPM in relationship to the miles made. If you then calculate the girth of 
&gt;the new tires you whish to mount in the relationship to the ones you have and 
&gt;the gear ratio you have you get the gear ratio you need to achive the same RPM 
&gt;for the same speed. (If I was shure to get it through the email I'd add add an 
&gt;EXCEL sheet to make it clear, we can try that later)
&gt;Formula: 
&gt;RPM  [1/min] x  gear-ratio x tire-girth [km or miles] x 60 [min] = speed [km 
&gt;or mls / hour]

I am determined to pick the tallest tires that will fit, and then order gear
ratios to match (6.17s) from Germany.

&gt;&quot;Tallest Tires&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; all of them in combination with the coil-springs / absorbers package from 
&gt;Autohaus Seikel, I know about 245/75 R 16 with 7x16 rims, 7,50 R 16 wit 6x16, 
&gt;215/85 R 16 with 5,5 x 16. All of the cars are factory 16'' equipped.

This is great information

&gt;&quot;body lift&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; without a bodylift (=different springs) on your 14'' the 195 R 16 on 5,5 x 
&gt;16 or maybe 205 R 16 with 5,5 x 16 should work properly without prior body 
&gt;modifications. What max load is beeing given to to you by VW oA. In Europe the 
&gt;complete weight for a syncro 14'' used in havy off-road conditions is limited 
&gt;to 2300 kg and 2500 kg for the 16''. Sorry Derek, but from my point of view it 
&gt;seems completely foolish to load up a syncro to more than 3,0 tons without 
&gt;changing the coil springs and absorbers to something more havy duty. This may 
&gt;also explain your tremendous consumption of new cv-joints. The body 
&gt;reinfocements on the 16'' were done exactly for the same reason. 

This is a matter of philosophy. Some serious off-roaders prefer relatively
mild (not stiff) shock absorbers and springs so that, when they smash into
rocks on a bad road, the springs and shock absorbers will give instead of
transmitting the shock into the body of the vehicle. But, since I drive at
nearly 3 tons a lot, I certainly do want to upgrade to stronger shocks and
springs, as you say.

&gt;&quot;ground clearance&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; in the factory 16'' version the lifting derived only from the enlarged 
&gt;tires

WOW! I have been trying to get an answer to this question for several years.
Now you have said it.

&gt;&quot;rear-axis arms&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; the longer arms give you more clearnce for larger tires because the car 
&gt;gets a 20 mm longer pace (=distance between center points of the front and 
&gt;rear wheel)

Excellent piece of information. Now I have to order new rear-axis arms.

&gt;&quot;Oettinger-Westfalia 16'' syncro&quot; 

I ordered and installed Oettinger fog lamps in my syncro.

&gt;=&gt; Sorry again, forget about it  !! The (suspectedly) only Oettinger 3.2 
&gt;syncro 16'' ever built had the motor blown off at 60 000 km and was recently 
&gt;converted into a 1,9 TDI . Besides that, it was a Caravelle not a Westfalia. 
&gt;Forget about the Oettinger 3.2 itself! This engine had been developed by 
&gt;Volkswagen and later canceled because of the high manufacturing costs. Later 
&gt;Oettinger recieved the existing parts and tools and built a few cars but only 
&gt;one syncro 16'' prototype. You should also forget putting an Oettinger 3.2 
&gt;into any syncro. You can count the miles, until the gear-box will &quot;explode&quot; 
&gt;because of the power - and more impotant - high torque. (They used to hve 
&gt;automatic with most of the 4x2 WBX 6. We have had several 1,9 TDI (110 HP, 260 
&gt;Nm) conversions and the gear boxes sometimes make it only 5.000 km.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;2.1 engine for Westfalia&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; don't know what kind of engine they sold with the Westaflia in the U.S. but 
&gt;I belivesd so far it was the 2,1l (95HP) Kat. In Europe most of them were 1,6 
&gt;Turbodiesel (70HP) or 2,1 gasoline (95HP)
&gt;
&gt;&quot;syncro 16'' Westfalia&quot; 
&gt;=&gt; there were not many of them as a California / Joker. This wasnot offered 
&gt;through VAG but you could get it throghe westfalia, they should know how many 
&gt;of then they made - we don't know. With the price thre is a little 
&gt;misunderstanding. You get a 16'' non Westfalia Camper at 20.000 $ or below. 
&gt;The Westies are very rare but probably the price is quite similar, in case 
&gt;tehre is one offered. 
&gt;(I'll try to send you a copy of a 16'' Camper conversion done completely in 
&gt;ultralight aluminium-sandwich material. From my point of view I would not 
&gt;bother a minute with Westfalia if I could get one of these.)
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Westfalia&quot; =&gt; We had three kinds of factory-made campers offered over here: 
&gt;Multivan, Joker/California, and Club Joker / Atlantic. The multivan was the 
&gt;the cheapest of them with optional pop-up roof,  a rear bench/bed a table and 
&gt;a fridge. The Joker or later called California had a little kithchen besides 
&gt;the driver's seat with a fridge and stove, water tanks and optional diesel/gas 
&gt;heater. the Club/Joker or Atlantic was the GL version vith isolating windows, 
&gt;nicer trims ond some comfort extras. I guess the thing you could buy was 
&gt;something in between the California and the Atlantic. Beware that over her AC, 
&gt;cruise control, power-windows and mirrors, and stuff like that are not inclued 
&gt;in most of today's VW Campers. They make a lot of money out of these things 
&gt;and it is not a hard job to bring a California Club (4x2) up to 70.000 DM 
&gt;(50.000 $).
&gt;
&gt;I hope you don't suspect me playing the &quot;teacher&quot;, but I still think the idea 
&gt;to bring a compete 16'' Kombi, Caravelle or Camper to the States would 
&gt;probably be an economic solution. Recently a 1992 16'' 2,1 l (95HP) went off 
&gt;at about 16.000 $ in a little town near Munich. And a 1990 16'' 2,1l Crew-Cab 
&gt;with 120.000 (professional) km was sold for nothing more than 9.000$. What if 
&gt;you came to Germany with your wife visit some 16'' drivers, have a demo-drive 
&gt;with a 16'' and than decide if it is enough reason for you to change tires, 
&gt;gear-ratios, and springs in your existing car or even to procure a &quot;new&quot; one. 
&gt;This trip may be 2.000 $ but it might avoid &quot;spilling&quot; 20.000 $.

Ok. We will do this in the year 1999 as I have some business affairs I am
trying to attend to in the meantime that reduce my free time.

&gt;Did you get the broshure I ordered from &quot;projektzwo&quot; for you ?

Not yet. I got one about five years ago and admired their black double tube
bumpers, which I considered ordering.

&gt;Best regards
&gt;Tom
&gt;
I think I better forward this note to the list so its contents get into the
