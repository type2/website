Someone somewhere is going to be very lucky to own this gem! I have only heard
about it and seen that great photo of April with the dinosaurs (some desert
scene somewhere, sorry my geog is rubbish). There have been quite a few things
about this bus on the list - would any of you be willing to send me a picturw
of the beast for the SSVC magazine? Dave. (one day Ill get the signature
sorted)
