I agree with Bill! Most of the criticism leveled at the EV on this list
are by those who are EV-impaired. The usual answer...Uh...I saw one
in a catalogue and read the HP ratings.... or sometimes we here..
Duh...I drove one at the dealer's once...

The only way one is going to have an opinion that MATTERS on the
EV is thru long term driving. Take one out drive it for 3k miles
or so. Right now I have &gt;36K on mine. It has been on road trips,
shopping, hauling the kids. Never had a problem with the
power, hell I can even pass cars going up hill with the
A/C on and NOT loose speed.

VWs have always been ADEQUATELY powered. By that I mean, if you
look at the time a particular van was manufactured, and the
types of other cars available, VW has put in an engine that
will do the job...no more...no less. That is part of the 
charm of a VW van.

Also realize that VWs PRIMARY market for its vans is Europe. Cars
are taxed on their engine displacement, they are expected to be
rugged in order to pass the various government inspection programs.
They are not built so that some air-headed-mom/dad can hop
into their vehicle turn the key and put it in drive and then
ditch the vehicle in three years when the new version comes out
or the lease runs out.

If you want more power in your van...buy an Econoline with a V8..
you want to be &quot;accepted&quot; by Muffy and Biff, then buy a Grand
Caravan complete with plush carpet, auto trans, fake wood siding
and NO room.

So I digress.....the EV is the most reliable, solid VW I have
owned to date...Who needs a V6?
