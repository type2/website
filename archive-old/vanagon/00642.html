&gt;VW service told her that the fuel pumps rarely ever fail (what does the list

&gt;...[s n i p]...
&gt;Any other fuel pump stories?

I was travelling from Costa Mesa, CA to Florida  on vacation a few years
ago. The bus started losing power once I crossed the state line into AZ.
It would come and go and I couldn't track down the source of the problem
after replacing all fuel filters, etc, etc.

In Houston I decided to have an 'expert' fix the problem. Jay Marks VW/Yugo
off I-10 went through the same obvious things I checked and were stumped.
They replaced the condensor and I was on my way. I got to Baytown (about
10 miles East) and the power cut out again. Back to the dealer.

The next day they went at it again. I was really bummed cause the waiting
room wasn't my idea of a vacation spot. They decided to replace the fuel
pump with a Brazilian one. I headed East in the afternoon and got about
5 miles out of town and the motor crapped out again. Jay Marks was closed,
so I went back in the morning.

To make a long story short, they put in another Brazilian fuel pump and it
failed. They lifted the car using the sink drain as a support and tore that
up (and fixed it). Gave me an '87 Jetta to drive around and paid for my
hotels. Finally, they put in a German fuel pump and it's still working
today. &lt;knock knock&gt; on wood.
