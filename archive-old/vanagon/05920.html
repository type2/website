Subject: Poky wipers

I guess the fire in the heater must have scared
the Bus badly.  The solenoid's starting to
go, and last night &amp; this morning the windshield
wipers took off at a crawl and gradually began to
work up to speed.  They've always been slow at
first, but now they're just barely moving.  Am
I getting a clue than the wiper motor's on its way
out?
