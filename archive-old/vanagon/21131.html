&gt; Actually, a question about the wire that holds the curtain against the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; Where can one buy replacement wires?  They appear to be springs in a plastic
&gt; coating.  Any idea where one could find these?

They are all over the place in the junkyards.  I scavenged a set for my
'73 Safare, and found that they can be adjusted to any length by simply
unscrewing the screw-eye from the end, cutting the cable, and putting
the screw-eye back in.
