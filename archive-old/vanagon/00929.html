Subject:      wierd westys

westfalia is a company actually quite like winnebago ... in that they make
camper conversions of vans/trucks made by others. the volkswagen is just one
of the models they make. they make several versions of the volkswagen also.

the mercedes westy is likely one of their conversions of an MB 'bread-truck'
or delivery van. MB even makes a model 100 which is a 9 or 12 passenger,
front engined, rear-wheel-drive, bus that looks very similar to a vanagon.

also favored (according to the books i've got on german motor-homes) is the
vw LT series (also front engined, rear-wheel-drive).
