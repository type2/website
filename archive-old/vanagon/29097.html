Subject: Re: Which is the outside lane?

     Well, I'll have to put my vote in for the slow lane being the outside lane. 
      The logic is:  When passing another vehicle, I've always heard &quot;...passing 
     on the inside and on the outside...&quot;, inside meaning the side closest to 
     oncoming traffic or the center divide.

I'm serious. Given a four-lane freeway, or blvd, the fast lanes are the two 
in the middle. The slow lanes are the ones nearest the border of the 
highway.
     
Which are the inside lanes?
     
I just had a conversation in the elevator, all of us born in N Amer (3 
Yanks, 2 Canucks), and the vote was 3-2 that the outside lane is the fast 
lane!
     
Two of the voters were born and raised here in Windsor and they disagreed.
     
So here's a Friday question:
     
Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?
