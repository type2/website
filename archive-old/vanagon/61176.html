Subject: wiring harness, stalling

Well, yesterday my 84 died while going down the road around 40 mph.  It 
just cut out and died just as if I had turned off the ignition.  I turned 
the key a couple times before I came to a stop and it wouldn't start.  I 
pulled over and waited one or two minutes and it started right up.  There 
were no problems after this.

What I am wondering is, does this sound like the wiring harness fix that 
i've read about in the archives?  Is it worth spending the $100 for the 
harness if that is the problem?

thanks in advance for any help 

Blake
