Subject: '71 or newer VW engine wanted


The '70 VW engine in my '71 bus, is drawing the ire of the local
revenooers-- namely the California Air Resources Board. It's an
engine from a '70 bus (I believe), with Solex 30PICT-3 cab, vacuum
advance distributor, standard bus muffler, and at least one leaky
pushrod tube. Runs great, passed smog test a few months ago (even
by '71 standards)... but it's illegal according to a law that says
that a '71 vehicle must have an engine with '71 (or newer) smog
equipment. For this bus, that MUST include the dual-port heads,
34PICT carb, stock dual-port manifold-- or CARB approved substitutes,
of which there aren't many.

The guy who gave it the most recent smog test, was apparently happy
to see a single carb with SOLEX on it, and no 009 or extractor.
But repair shops in the area have expressed surprise that I got
away with this transgression of having a '70 single-port engine
in a '71 bus.

Anyone out there have, or know of, a strong-running dual-port engine
for a creature like this? I'd greatly prefer a &quot;bus-mount&quot; or
universal-case engine-- I don't trust those oil-pump-cover adapter
plates. It would also be nice if it had the doghouse oil cooler
and an alternator. Modified large-displacement engines are not
out of the question... (dream on).

Would anyone consider a trade? I can transport the engine for most
parts of Southern CA, and maybe NV or AZ. Hear/see/feel it run!
