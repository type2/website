Subject:      I GOT MY DREAM VANAGON!(also question!)

I now have a  Silvery (whatever that color was called) 1989 Vanagon
Carat. I made the deal with Commonwealth VW and it's mine!
Traded in Bessie for $3225, more than I expected; plus they knocked
off $2000 the selling price!
I have power everything! An A/C that works! Smoother engine &amp; tranny!
BUT...

is it possible for the speedo to be off 10mph because bigger tires? I
think that's something I'll hve to get used to.
