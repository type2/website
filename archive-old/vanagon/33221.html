Subject: Mexican VW report


I just came back from a couple of weeks in Mexico, climbing volcanos.

Spent several days in Puebla, home of the VW factory.  

Lots of new VW bugs with 1600i engines.  They look just like the
last bugs in the US except that they have put the front turn
signal lights in the bumper, so the top of the fender is smooth.

Bay-window buses everywhere, used as collectivos in the smaller towns--
and in Puebla, too.  They appear to be the same as the last ones
in the US ('78 or so) except for the water-cooled engine and the
ugly black radiator on the front.  The speedo panel is changed in
the latest to a single cluster rather than two dials.  There is
a tach, I believe.  They made lots of the air-cooled before they
switched to water; about equal numbers on the road.

I rode in VW bug taxis and in bus collectivos quite a bit.  One
thing for sure--they drive them hard and put them away wet.  Especially
the older air-cooled buses.  The sliding door is a weak point and
so many have the door cut into two panels that are hinged like the
early buses.  Those with sliding doors put in a pulley above the
passenger seatbelt and have a rope through it to the door--so the
driver can yank the rope and shut the door.

If anyone has questions, just ask me.  I have put a photo of the
CUTEST bus I saw in Mexico on my web page:
