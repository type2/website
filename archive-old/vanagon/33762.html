So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648 says:
&gt; Jim asks a question that is the automotive equivalent of whether it's better
&gt; to marry for love or money.  Luckily automotive bigamy is not illegal.  I
&gt; think old German cars make wonderful second cars, not so good first cars.
&gt; My cars that need to run on Monday are Japanese: 87 Integra and 92 Sentra.
&gt; They are so close to zero maintenance (excepting oil changes) that I have
&gt; trouble answering when the Consumer Reports questionnaire asks who maintains
&gt; them.  With over 60k miles, the Sentra has gotten oil, filters, and new
&gt; brake pads.  That's it.  The Integra has over 120k.  It has had the same,
&gt; plus a new cam belt (old one looked new when it came out at 90k), some
&gt; new FI widget under warranty at 40+k, and the airco compressor died and
&gt; has been left dead.  That's it.
&gt; 
&gt; These cars are fun to drive but not indefinably magical like the Vanagon.
&gt; The Vanagon is a hobby.  As such, I don't want to HAVE to work on it, and
&gt; since it is higher maintenance than the Japanese cars, I would HAVE to 
&gt; work on it if I needed it every day.  Especially since working on it
&gt; means learning new skills, which takes an unpredictable amount of time,
&gt; this is a key issue.  I admire the skills of the Bobs and Bobs-to-be
&gt; who carry treadle-driven drill presses under the back seat just in case,
&gt; but I can't make that approach fit my 12-hours-a-day-in-suit-and-tie
&gt; career nightmare.

Hmmm.  I haven't had anything 'magical' to take care of other than regular
maintenance with my Vanagon.  And I drive it every day (including Mondays);)
No real drivablility problems.  I did have a problem with it not keeping
an idle once, but it was promptly fixed.  Has about '73K miles.  No muss
no fuss.  So what's so special about Japanese cars?  There was an AC problem,
but it didn't keep me from driving it either.  If there's anything wrong
with Vanagons, it's the VW service department, not the van itself.
