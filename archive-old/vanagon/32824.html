Subject: Re: Much mail

I've been on the list for less than a year and seen this proposed about 6 
times. The bottom line is that Gerry S owns the list and maintains it the 
way he wants it...and this is the way he wants it.

You might set your subscription to DIGEST mode. Just send a message to 
LISTSERV_at_LENTI.MED.UMN.EDU with the text HELP in the *body* of the 
message. That will return some info, which will include how to set 
vanagon mail to digest mode. Digest mode gives you one message a day with 
all the messages in it.

Thanks! Joe

&gt; Volks Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am more than a little overwhelmed with the amount of mail I am recieving
&gt; from the vanagon list - 140 pieces this morning.
&gt; 
&gt; Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to a
&gt; couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
&gt; windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?  That way an individual could
&gt; sign on to one or all depending on his/her interests.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a great group of folks and this message is in no means meant as a
&gt; flame to anyone...I just can't keep up with 100+ pieces of mail a day.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments?
