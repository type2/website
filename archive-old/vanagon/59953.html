Ron,
Beats, me. It was already there when I bought the van.  I would think a
good fabric store could help you out because they sell all widths of Velcro
by the foot and I'm sure they could tell you what to glue it on with.  Just
remember to put the loop side on the ceiling and the hook side on the
screen.

&gt; &gt;There is a two part &quot;bug screen&quot; on our ('85) Westy skylight. It
attached
&gt; &gt;with velcro around the opening and a solid piece attaches to the screen
on
&gt; &gt;one side permenently and the other three sides with velcro to the screen
so
&gt; &gt;you can secure it to block out the sun or open it to let in air.  I
don't
&gt; &gt;know if it is the original configuration or not but it IS made out of
the
&gt; &gt;same material as the curtains.
&gt; 
&gt; I have the same thing on my '90 Westie.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of this... what *is* the glue-of-choice for getting the Velcro
&gt; (tm) strip to stick to the roof???
