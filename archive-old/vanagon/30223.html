OK.  Thanks to Jack Reed, I found the Gislaved Nord Frost II in
185R/14.  Its an 8-ply tire.  I ordered a set of four at $90 apiece.
The total cost including: tax, shipping ($10 per tire), and
studs (9$ per tire) is $457.  (and my Tire FLAP wanted $27 per tire for
studs.)

They're at The Tire Shoppe in Fort Collins, CO.  (970) 226-1123.

If you see a silver-grey '87 loaded with cross country skis blasting
through the snow and ice -- wave, it'll be me.
