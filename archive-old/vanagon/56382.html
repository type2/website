Subject: Re: vanagon engine lid

Couldn't help but think about this one due to my loss of my '91 Westy. If I
had had the old metal (heavy, non-burning metal) rather than the light
weight plastic one provided on the newer models, might the fire damage to the 
interior have been avoided? Really makes me wonder about safety issues.

Even the weight of the lid from my older '80 might have been worth the struggle
if it could have saved the interior of my Westy from destruction.

&gt; This weekend for the first time I hefted the old and new (metal and plastic,
&gt; respectively) versions of the vanagon engine lid side by side.  I hadn't
&gt; realized how much lighter the plastic one is.  Those of you (eg Westy
&gt; owners) who lift off the the cover rather than rocking it back against the
&gt; seat should keep an eye open for a plastic lid in wrecking yards.
