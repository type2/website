Subject: coil overs


 Coil over shocks were available for the vanagon in europe. they were
 used for heavy duty applications and were usually only on trucks and
 the famed sixteen inch version. the last time i checked they were still 
available but very expensive. i'll check the euro micro fiche i have for
the part numbers. US dealers usually refuse to order stuff that is not in
their US parts books, but i have been able to get around that in the past.
i will write with the cost and will check if they will fit the pre 80'
vans.
