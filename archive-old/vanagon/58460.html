Subject: Westy conversion
Date: Wed, 16 Apr 1997 17:22:52 -0500

I am interested in converting my '86 Syncro to a Westy (roof only).  I
have been told that the best way to do this is to find a wrecked westy
with a good top, cut the entire roof off and weld it into my roof.  Does
anyone have any experience with this??? or any other suggestions???
