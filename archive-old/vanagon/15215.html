There is no free-for-all, Josh.  Please keep your postings VW related.

Also, I do not permit discussions of list topic on the list.  The list is 
about VW Vans and buses.  If you want discussion about the list, please 
send it to me and NOT to the list. This includes topic, administration, 
list management and access.

Lastly, there is no charter.  This list is my gratis to the VW and 'net 
community. Say what you like, but it's _my_ list.

Thanks.
