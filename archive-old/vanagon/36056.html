Subject: Installing Engine in 78 westie

Howdy,

Well after a lot of contemplation and soul searching I came to the 
 decision that I would not have the time to rebuild the 2 liter in the bus.  
In my quest for a quality rebuild I saw prices that ranged from $750 
- me &quot;what do you do with the heads&quot; 
-them &quot;we use good heads&quot; 
-me &quot;you mean you rebuild using good cores?&quot; 
-them &quot;we use good heads&quot;
-me  &quot;you mean you put used heads that you judge as good?&quot;
-them &quot;yea type IV heads never fail&quot;

to a local shop that charged $2900 for a fully blueprinted performance 
 motor. The majority of the mail order places priced around $1200 give 
 or take $100.  I sat down dragged the pencil from behind my ear 
 scribbled on some paper and came to the decision to go with a engine 
 from Mark Stephens -$1495 plus $70 for a full balance and the &quot;never a 
 dropped seat&quot; heads.  After hearing about the quality of work and 
 service from this shop I feel good about the investment. This engine 
 includes NEW cam and lifters versus regrinds from other shops and many 
 more new parts versus rebuilt.  I think that the extra $300 is good 
 insurance against failures and having to go through the added cost and 
 hassle of dropping the engine later.
After ordering the engine I called RMMW and got a engine install kit 
 that contains all the various pieces to install the engine including a 
 new clutch kit and gaskets -interesting note when I pulled the old 
 clutch it was worn past the rivets and measured at 5.3 mm, no wonder 
 it wouldn't move! 

Advice sought here

 So here I am getting everything ready for the arrival of the engine 
 next week, cleaning tin and replacing FI hoses, and I am wondering if 
 I should replace the transmission now or wait until the engine is 
 ready and bolt them together on the floor? 

Thanks for your help,
Clay

PS I am removing the AC system, everything works including the compress 
 or, if somebody wants it let me know and I will sell it for a case of 
 Sam Adams and shipping costs.

PPS I have a beatup Stewart Warner gas heater that I will do a similar 
 deal.
