Subject: Fridge guts... for sale?

Volks,
	Still trying to recover from the GNATT trip - cleaned out the garage
last night and decided I needed to get rid of my old Safare' cabinets.
There were two - the sink/closet unit and the stove/fridge unit.  I did
the sink/closet unit first - taking it apart and stowing the hardware
and pieces of paneling that were still in reasonable shape in case I
ever decide to recreate the original cabinets.  Threw the rest,
including the particle-board shelves and junk paneling into the
dumpster.
	Now what to do with the Fridge/stove unit.  The stove was removed
and built into the new cabinets, but the fridge was still there.
Norcold, 12V/110V.  The fridge still operated, but the case and seals
were completely shot.  To the point that all of the cool would just exit
the front of the fridge.  So, I gutted it.  I removed the little metal
freezer cabinet, compressor, thermostat, cooling fins, and inverter and
put them all in a box.  It still all functions, and gets cold, but
there is no cabinet.  Last time I was in West Marine I noticed they sold
a &quot;fridge kit&quot; for about $420 that will turn an icebox into a
refrigerator.  It's exactly what I have now.  
	I was thinking that someone might be able to use this to turn their
older Westy icebox into a refrigerator.  Any takers?  The unit draws 4.5
amps and will cool to 32 degrees F or below, even if the outside
temperature is high, provided it is ventilated properly.  I don't want
much for this stuff, just enough to partially offset the cost of the
fridge I bought to replace it.  We're talking well down into the two-
digit price range.  If I don't sell it I will probably just put it in
the attic, or maybe install it in my cat's litter box (it's the enclosed
kind) as an air conditioner.  Then it would really be a &quot;Comfort
Station&quot;.  =)
