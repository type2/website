Subject: Re: 6 - 12 Volt inverter/safaris

Hi Matt - Dave here again! Lee Griffiths of our SSVC makes convertors  - he
wrote about them in a mag recently - did you catch it! He's on this list (but
hiding cos I'm hassling him ) and if you want I can pass you his Email. If you
read this lee contact matt for us?
Safari bits both s/hand and NOS can be got as kits or bits - a good soursce is
Karmann Konnection. Phone no in the mag - ask to speak to Julian!
Your engine lid cover is reseved in Spares, will write direct with
arrangemebts soon. Dave.
