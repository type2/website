Hello, I have a problem with my 1991 vanagon:  When I depress the break 
pedal the stop lights do not come on.  I notice that I have to press the 
break pedal quite hard for the lights to come on.  Could it be the 
master cylinder or the pressures switches in the master cylinder. Has 
anyone out there had this problem?
