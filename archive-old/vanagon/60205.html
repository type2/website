Subject: Re: ChemToliet for Westy's

We purchased the same unit last spring for our 7.5 week trip west. I must say
that when you are crossing the plains states or in southern Utah where the
signs say &quot;next service 150 miles&quot; it is nice to have &quot;all the comforts of
home&quot; right there with you and not pollute the environment.

We found it easy to care for, it used very little chem - less than the small
bottle that fits in the base - on the whole trip. Of course we do use the NP
facilities when there, but on the road or in the middle of the night its nice
to have your own spot!

We made a cover for ours with a cushioned/padded top. As we have a '91 Westy we
keep ours just behind the passengers seat. It can serve as a &quot;foot stool&quot; in
the evening when you swivel the chair around, or it can serve as a short seat
as it is. Placing it there we no longer had to worry about breaking off the
security system thing in the sliding door pillar (we've done this twice
inadvertantly!) Ours is short enough to fit under the lower bed when extended
if one wants to get it out of the way. 

I must admit, I fought it for years but was GLAD :) to have it last summer -
and on several trips since.

&gt; Well when ya gotta go, ya gotta go... 
&gt; 
&gt; Theres lots of really neat desert around here (Reno NV). But not too many 
&gt; facilities out there in the wide open. So enter the chemical toliet or 
&gt; &quot;porta potti&quot; (PP's) for my 85 Westy...                                          
&gt;                                                                                  
&gt; The wife does require some nicities so I looked into the PP's on the market.   
&gt; Best one I found was the Thetford 155 Porta Potti (Wal Mart $60). Its a very 
&gt; sanitary unit in its construction. Two piece unit, top contains 2.5 gallons    
&gt; of clean water to flush with, bottom allows 4 gallons of waste. Absolutly      
&gt; no odor, the bottom detaches to carry to a restroom (when one's finally 
&gt; available). Bottom contains a flush tube that swivels out into the john.       
&gt;                                                
&gt; Best part of all is that it fits easily into the undersink cabinet. I just     
&gt; removed the shelf (placed it on the bottom of the cabinet). So if you don't 
&gt; mind giving up some cabinet space its a great fit. Or if you want to still 
&gt; have some cabinet space, the Thetford Porta Potti 135 is smaller (2.5 gal      
&gt; of waste space) and leaves a few inches for the re-positioned shelf. I           
&gt; went for the 155. 
&gt;                                                                                  
&gt; Well hows this for a after lunch e-mail. Like I said when ya gotta go...
