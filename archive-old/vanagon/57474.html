&gt;&gt;Hi folks!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I know the van has an electronic governor that will cut the engine at a 
&gt;&gt;certain rpm . 
&gt;-Correct-(~ 5k rpm)
&gt;
&gt;You are warned of this by the dash lights coming on. 
&gt;-Definitely *not* correct
&gt;
&gt;The problem I have is that the lights come on prematurely. For example, at 
&gt;&gt;45mph the lights will come on when I'm in 3rd gear 
&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What do you think? Is my alternator weak or is the brain going out? 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It's still Friday so I'm not gonna touch your brain going!!! (ohhh-you
meant the bus' brain!).
&gt;
&gt;Seriously at least your voltage regulator is shot, mebbe the whole alternator.
