Subject: Re: old songs that kids don't know (F)

How about &quot;Take a Little Piece of my Heart&quot; as originally sung by Janis
Joplin/Big Brother and the Holding Company currently making the rounds on
the Country radio stations as sung by some new female heartthrob. Most folk
think it's a catchy new song. Seems ironic as hell to me. How many times did
I almost get my long haired ass threatened by the cowboy crowd during the
first round of the song! I've mentioned this to several people and they look
at me like I was the only one who actually lived through the '60s and early
'70s. I'm not getting into a us vs them thread- I've been wearing hats and
boots since I was a pup- even a longhaired one.
