Subject: how to get exhaust apart?

In the process of doing the heads on my 85 vanagon, I of course had to take the
exhaust system off.  Well, the bolts were so rusted I couldn't get the sections
apart while it was on the van, so I bit the bullet, got out the hacksaw, and
cut the section that has the O2 sensor (it was rusting through anyway).  This
enabled me to completely remove the system, with the intention of getting it
apart later.  Well, later is now, and I still can't do anything with it.  I've
tried the spray stuff for rusted bolts, I've tried a nut cracker, I've
hacksawed the nuts off -- no luck!  The bolts still won't budge, as if they are
fused to the exhaust.  BTW, the bolt heads were so rusted they were pretty much
rounded off before I ever tried to do anything with them.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can get this bugger apart?

Thanks, david
