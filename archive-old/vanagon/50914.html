 Hi all: Well, I would go to Baja. As a mater of fact in about a week we are
going on a trip down to Baja. We will enter at Tiajuana and go down to
Ensenada, then over to San Felipe(There is a little Taco stand called Tony's
there that sell fantastic shrimp tacos). South of San Felipe the road gets
pretty rough. There are hills called the Sisters that are rocky and nasty.
They are famous for breaking a lot of race cars when the Baja 1000 ran
through there. I'm anxious to see how the Syncro Westy handles them. We will
travel about 100 miles down the coast (beautiful,rugged,remote) to Chapala
dry lake.  We will catch the main highway there and go back up to Ensenada
to contingency day for the 96 Baja 1000. After hanging around there a couple
of days to watch the race start and end (that's about all you get to see) it
will be homeward bound back to Washington. It has been really raining here
and I am ready to see the sun.
