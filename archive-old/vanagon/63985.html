Subject: Re: Oil light/buzzer

Well, I've had those problems too. (Light and buzzer stimulating my blood
pressure, esp when slowing down after driving fast for some time.)

I finally had a VW shop take a look at it, they said the pressure &quot;was a
bit on the low side&quot; at 2000 rpm. They did NOT make any suggestions as to
repairs, other than rebuilding the engine. After worrying a lot, I decided
that the problem _could_ be related to the pressure regulating valve,
ordered and replaced that piston, spring and seal. Voila. Very much better.
It got even better after I changed oil from one syntethic to another, more
expensive, and a VW oil filter. Don't know what filter there was before, I
think it was a MANN.

This was perhaps one year ago, I've had the buzzer screaming at me maybe
once or twice since. I'm happy this way.
