Subject:      Vanagon Syncro Delayed Start

I have an '86 Vanagon Syncro with a rebuilt AVP 2.1 engine.  Sometimes,
especially worse in colder weather, I have to turn and hold the ignition
key for several seconds before the starter motor turns over.  In warm
weather (it's 90+ in Ogden today), the motor starts right up.  When it's
colder (soon it will be 30+ in Ogden), I can hold it for up to 20 or 30
seconds before anything happens.  If we're expecting a big overnight
storm, I park on a hil and bump-start it.

I should mention that it did this with the old (original) motor, and was
perpetuated when the rebuilt was installed.  Not that I'm dumb enough to
think that the block has anything to do with a starting problem, but
just to make it clear that the installation of the new motor did not
introduce this problem.

Thanks in advance for any and all help that comes my way!
