Subject: Carbs for Sale


I'm getting a collection of carbs, my bus only wears two at the most.
I'm selling off the rest, I don't know if they're functioning, but they
all are rebuildable. Here's the list, I think they're all origonals:

two 34 pict-3
two 30 pict-2
one 28 pict-1
one 30 pict-3
one 30 pict-1 with air cleaner assembly

also a fuel pump, regulator, and bumper overriders

I'm in Southern Maryland, but I can ship, make me an offer on what you
want, Thanks.
