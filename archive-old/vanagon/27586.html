It is. And the diesel vanagon motor mounts fit the gas block perfectly.


&gt; However, the diesel  may well be a different bellhousing interface than for a
&gt; wasserboxer or a/c engine.

The boxer bellhousing is different than the diesel housing. But the 
diesel bellhousing will fit the boxer's trans.

&gt; 2)  My recollection on 5 sp diesels is that they were intended &quot;next year&quot;
&gt; ('83).  The problem is that, to my knowledge, '82 was the only year that VWoA
&gt; brought the diesels over to the US, and all of them had 4 speeds.  Therefore
&gt; the availability of a 5 sp. tranny for a diesel in the US is very
&gt; questionable. 

I have &quot;heard&quot; that the 5-sp trans is less durable than the 4-spd. This 
was just heresay from a vw mechanic so...

&gt; I should add that it is also  my understanding that the gearing
&gt; in the diesel transaxels is different that for the gas engines (higher
&gt; revs/mile for the diesel) and that therefore you may want to check carefully
&gt; before you retrofit ANY diesel transaxel to an a/c engine.(Conversly, I am
&gt; inclined to guess that the straight transplant of a gas rabbit/jetta engine
&gt; onto a diesel transaxel will result in  unnecessarily high revs/mile of the
&gt; gas engine in this new application - hence the question in my mind &quot;is it
&gt; possible to modify the gear ratios or final drive ratio in the diesel 4 sp
&gt; tranny to better match to alternate engines?&quot;


The gear ratios are different. The 2 &quot;easy&quot; choices are to retain the 
diesel bellhousing and fit a boxer trans, or to replace the diesel ring 
and pinion gears with a higher ratio set.
 I did neither. My gas engine now truns at the same speed as my diesel 
engine did. So what? The engine noise is not obstrusive, the van 
accelerates quickly from 40 - 60 mph in third, and from 55 - 75 in 
fourth. I cruise at 55-60, engine rpm are around 3450-3700. 
Yes, it would be nice to drop a couple of hundred rpms by shifting into 5th,
but you know, the 8v engine feels so strong and willing to rev that I've kinda 
got over that.


When and if I change my gear ratios I will install a adjustable cam gear 
and try to shift the peak torque point to a lower rpm, in an effort to 
retain the &quot;snappy&quot; acceleration.
