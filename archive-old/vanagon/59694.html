&gt;Just a guess -- you're a Cubs fan, too???

No, I live in Houston - I'm a Rice Owls football fan.  Been to all their
home games for the last 24 years.
(...pretty much the same thing as a Cubs fan...)

But, honestly, out of our sizeable group we ought to be able to come up
with a machine that could run the list *without* having to spend all that
money on something that isn't, directly, for our cars.  The platform isn't
all that important.  A listserv just isn't that big of a burden on a small
machine's resources.  I'm NOT arguing that it isn't worth it.

I manage three lists now (two Mac lists and a Rice band (The MOB) list,
but, unfortunately, VWs are too far outside of academia for me to get away
with putting the list on our monster (auspex) server.  *sigh*

Whatever - when the time comes, just tell me where to send my check ;-)
