Subject:      fuel pump?

Problems have just begun with my 1983 Vanagon (air-cooled) after nearly 20,000
trouble-free miles.  I believe that my fuel pump may be ready to call it quits
since the symptoms are identical to the fuel pump problems I had on my 1986
Cabriolet.  Here are the symptoms:

Cold starts are fine
idles erratically if left idling for a few minutes, eventually stalls
drives fine at highway speeds
stalls when slowing down to a stop
won't start right away after stall
will start when left to sit a few minutes

Changed fuel filter about 6 months ago, but I'm not ruling this out.  I have not
heard any noise from the pump, but I have not thoroughly researched this.

I checked for vacumn leaks but found nothing obvious.

I have researched the archives, but found nothing with identical symptoms.

Any help would be appreciated!

Jesse
