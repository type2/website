Subject: Spotted, Vans in Reclaim Yard

If anyone is interested, I went through a used auto parts yard this 
weekend located near Woodbridge, Virginia.

To my surprise there were about six or seven VW vans of varying types and 
condition in a line.

I remember several people mentioning things like this and the need for 
parts. I thought I'd put a notice here for what its worth.

The Yard carried two names:

	AAAACO Used Auto Parts
   &amp;
	Brandywine Auto Parts

It's located on US Route 1 (which is also Jefferson Davis Highway), just 
north of Woodbridge, Virginia and south of Lorton, Virginia.

I'll try to provide more detail, if I'm asked more specific questions.
