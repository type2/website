&gt; I think that the cause of some early morning hesitation and stalling at

&gt; a 1980 model with a similar box and the black plastic cover on top, would
&gt; just pop off.  Mine appears to be glued on.  Does this indicate work by the
&gt; PO or the PO's repair shop?  Should that black plastic cover be removable
&gt; so that I can check out the resistor and wiper arm that hide inside?

The plastic cover on my son's 90 Vanagon air flow meter fell off.  I
have fashioned a make shift cover out of an old clear plastic box top,
but would like to find a replacement.  Does anyone know where I could
get a cover without replacing the entire air flow meter (expensive!!!).
I have checked the local salvage yards and the only ones I found wanted
to sell the entire part.

Thanks,
