Subject: Re: 71 bus question

&gt;Brother Muldoon can you spare some advice,
&gt;With every new nook and cranny I look in my recently purchased 71 bus, 
&gt;I'm finding major problems (brake system, suspension) :( .  The engine 
&gt;seems very good (now that I've put 009 distrib. and new carb) and is 
&gt;purring.  I must now consider perhaps keeping the engine and finding a 
&gt;new body for it.  What other years of bus will this engine fit into 
&gt;without major modification??  TIA!

That engine will fit slick as snot, and real easy back to 67 and forward to
71. They were 12 volt during that period, and the 67 is a 12 volt split
sreen YA HOOH. 68-71 had basically the same body.

Dont give up these are old vehicle you know.
