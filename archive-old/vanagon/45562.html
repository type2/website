 Subject: FS: 1973 VW Campmobile $1500/B.O.

  First off: one piston has a hole in it, so it needs at least a one-cylinder
  rebuild (estimate $650); wouldn't hurt to get all four at once (estimate
  $1000).
  The good news: Just had dual-carb rebuild (This cost me $750) and smog
  check.  Brakes and clutch replaced 12K miles ago.
  This is a bright green number with a pop-top.  It is a Safare Custom Camper
  conversion, not a Westy, so it has a different setup than you will see
  elsewhere.  It has a hanging closet, a sink, and (hopefully) the original
  refrigerator and stove which came with it (supposedly better than the Westy
  version).  These are still in the hands of the previous owner, who is now
  looking for them.
  It's been in the Bay Area (away from the coast) its entire life, so the body
  is in good shape. It has a few dents, but no crushing blows and virtually no
  rust.
  I'll probably end up getting the cylinder rebuild done and then selling it,
  but in case someone wants to buy it and do the work or get it done themselves,
  I am advertising it now.  If you're interested but want to talk price, give
  me a call.  I am willing to talk.
