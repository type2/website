&gt; In 1977 we took our trusty Westy up into Quebec into the La Verendrie (if 
&gt; spelled correctly its an accident) park. More moose than people.  Bridges 
&gt; that we had to build up before we could us them.  Two track log things 
&gt; that were built for logging trucks with a much wider stance than a Type 2 
&gt; T2.  Saw the Auroa Borealis,  Pine Martens, really wonderful isolated 
&gt; river.  We took a couple canoes and a couple motorcycles on a trailer - it 
&gt; was a canoe trip that the Westy was tagging along with - the cycles were
&gt; relays to go get the Westy at the end of the day.  THis was really rather 
&gt; far north.
&gt; 
&gt; Perfect road for T1 and T2 generation vans.  The claim was only 4 wheel 
&gt; drive which means you'd rather have a VW.  No idea on the 2wd Vanagons or 
&gt; us 'wimpy' EVs.  I'm nuts and would try though...

Oooh, Yeah, yeah.  This is it IMHO.  Plus I can supply 3-4 canoes
if anyone is interested in adding this aspect.  I say we definitely
go NORTH.
