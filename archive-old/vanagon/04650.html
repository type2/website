&gt;I am still looking for a drop in replacement for my large sunroof

&gt;Any hints?

i just had a thought fleetingly pass behind my eyeballs:  yachts.
as in boats and such. they might have a large enough piece of lexan or
somesuch that could be fitted to such a large sunroof hole.

OR! &lt;fertile brain in 2nd gear now&gt; what about those custom vans, the horrid
large bulky u.s. models that have the tinted picture windows in the sides?
maybe one of those side windows would be the right size for your roof?

&gt;Tanks!

nah, i kinda doubt it ... the army doesn't like sunroofs in its armored
vehicles. tends to make the occupants kinda nervous when the shooting starts.
i'd look at the boats or the custom vans instead. :)
