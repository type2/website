Hi Gilbert;

&gt; Subject:       driving my bus to and in B.C.

&gt; I'm heading out west next fall and will be working in the Rockies over 
&gt; the winter, probably at a ski resort.  Any suggestions on winter 
&gt; driving?  eg. should I invest in chains? if so...any good suggestions?

The best bet for snow conditions is at least a good all season tire.  
You can get away quite easily with a set of Yokohama LT195/75 R 14 
model Y370.  These can go anywhere.  I'm on my second set now, and 
they are unbeatable under any condition.  They hold the van up really 
well.  A tire like the Yoko will give you more all round service than 
the dedicated snow tires.  They are aggressive, yet very quiet, and 
they stick to the road like glue in very spirited cornering.


&gt; This may sound silly but...they *don't* use salt on the roads outside of 
&gt; Ontario and Quebec do they?  Salt = Rust...BAD!!!
&gt; 
Sorry to report, that YES, BC uses salt.  LOTS of it!  As soon as 
it's warm enough to melt (around -8 or so) they'll dump salt big 
time.  I've lived all over BC, and I have yet to find an exception to 
that rule.  I agree, it's BAD!.  I always picture little saltmen 
eating away at my vehicles.  Use mega wax, and maybe even get the 
vehicle rust treated and undercoated to minimize problems.

Where abouts will you be working?  I live in Langley (50 km east of 
Vancouver), and quite often go to the Rockies.

Hope this helps.  If you would like any other info, give me a shout.

Harry.
