Subject: Re: CV joint grease: moly vs. lithium??

Hi folks, any opinions out there on this topic?  CV grease I can buy is
lithium based, light blue-green colour.  Bentley say use G6 grease, duh OK?
the dealer says their grease is black, so I'm sure it's moly based.
Problem, what's best, type and brand-name? And, since I am only topping up
the joints, what if I guess wrong and end up mixing them? Sage advice
appreciated.  Thanks.   Tim
