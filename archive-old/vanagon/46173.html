Subject: Yow! - loose '73 engine mounting

The last time I started my '73 Campmobile (type 4 engine), I thought it made
a grinding sound.  As I was just pulling it into the garage, I was
concerned, but not stranded.

Tonight I went to investigate.  I was missing a nut on the lower
engine-to-transmission mounting stud, and the other lower nut was backed off
1/4 inch.  The starter was loose and moving - the lower nut was loose and
the upper engine mounting bolt was likewise.  I had one nut &amp; bolt solidly
holding it to the transmission.  Yikes!  I'm glad I found out before I took
off on some trip.

I've had the bus 7+ years.  I've had this engine installed for over 3 years.
I've never had loose mounts before.  The only thing that is different is
that I have driven the new speed limit - 70 mph - to work several times
lately.  I think I'll drop back to my normal 60 mph.  I guess some harmonics
must be set up at 70.

Any other ideas?  Anyone else with like experience?  It's not a normal
maintenance item to check the bolts, is it?
