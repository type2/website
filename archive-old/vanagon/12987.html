Subject: Sticker Vote!


Ok, sorry it took me so long to compile these ideas - a wicked week
here at MCM....

So, how do we organize this sticker-craze? Below I've created three
sections:

	Identification Object
	Phrases
	Graphics

What I suggest is that we allow 5 votes per section, and each voter can
cast from 1 to 5 votes for ONE or MORE candidate in each section.

I'll tally the totals and we'll see which candidates are most favored.
&gt;From there, we may combine the most popular candidates into a single
&quot;concept&quot; or cast a second round of votes to determine the final design.

So, cast your votes folks. Vote via direct email to me to avoid list
traffic.

Note: I just noticed that Al Knoll has sent some prototypes to the
WWW server - note that I don't think everybody has access to the
WWW server, so we may need to send out some other graphic files for
preview.
