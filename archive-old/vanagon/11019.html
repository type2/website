Subject: Adjusting the parking brake.

I'm tyring to figure out how to adjust the parking brake on my 71.  All of 
the other busses I've seen have a bar up front where the two cables split 
off to the wheels.  Mine has two cables which go all the way to the front.  
I figure the adjustment must be made at the drums.  Any idea?
