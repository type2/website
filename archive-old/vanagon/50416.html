Subject: Bilstein Shocks for $69

Ed Berroth suggested a call to Mark Anderson at ASI in San Diego regarding
the shocks for $50 deal. I called Mark and he said that those shocks are only
for certain pickups but that he would give me a good deal because I know Ed.
So I bought a set of shocks for $69 each plus $14 to drop ship all 4 to
Vermont. Mark's business is suspensions for all cars including race cars and
he seems like a very friendly guy. He has an 800 number for previous
customers and suggested I post it. 
800-683-2890. Bilstein makes one shock for all Vanagons.

Thanks for the info Ed.
