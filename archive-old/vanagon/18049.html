When you are in Ohio check out Coyne's east of Columbus about a mile north of
I-70 on U.S. 40 between Kirkersville and National Trails Raceway.  Also, the
Beetle Barn south of Cambridge on I-77.  You can see this one from the
interstate.

Good luck on the trip! :)

P.S.
I just moved from Zanesville (on I-70, 30 miles west of Cambridge).  If you
or your wife like pottery and antiques stop there, shops are everywhere.
 Also, the only hand operated double lock system still operational in the
world is there on the canal the bypasses the rapids on the Muskingum River.
 You can take a couple hour trip on the riverboat &quot;Lorena&quot;, too.
