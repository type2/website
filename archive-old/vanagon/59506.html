Austin and Charles and All:

  Where did Austin get his information that the CHP is randomly pulling
cars over to perform a smog check?  It is patently illegal for the CHP to
randomly pull over a vehicle to perform any kind of check on our vehicles. 
All random stops must be made at a fixed location, such as for &quot;drunk
driving&quot; checkpoints.  

  I would appreciate being notified of the details by anyone who has been
randomly stopped.  After I get some examples, I will research the issue and
tell people what to do in the event of a random stop.  Or, I might even do
a class-action lawsuit to prevent the CHP from making random stops.  

  Thank you everybody.  I hope this message goes to all.
