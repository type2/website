Which would be more motivational:
            200 e-mail messages or 200 pieces of snail mail.

Does any one know if Kennedy Engineering has a home page or e-mail
address?

  If one of the articulate list member would compose a breif, concise
letter expressing our needs and concerns, it could easily be cut and
pasted into letter form.  Then both an electronic and hard copy could be
sent with little effort by the list members. The effort would consist of
an investment of twenty minutes of time and the cost of an evelope and
stamp.

It would be interesting to see a their reaction when they receive 300 or
more letters.   The shock value alone would be unmeasurable.
At this point the response to the mailing has been insufficient proceed
with the action. If anyone else is interested please drop me a note.

Some people may feel this activity falls into the SPAM catagory. But I
feel this is a legitamate interested expressed by several list members.
This seems like a good opportunity to utilize the powers of supply and
demand to create a situation that can benefit both Vanagon owners and
Kennedy Engineering. The latter being for them to decide.
