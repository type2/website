Ack!  Not _THIS_ again!

Please!
DO NOT forward this anymore...
this thing will not die...

Craig Shergold GOT his listing in the book of records.
His cancer is in remission and he's doing fine, and yet....
Those pesky cards are STILL pouring in to the hospital where he stayed.

THey don't want them.
HE no longer wants them...
but folks keep on changing the time/date on this post and forwarding it on!

Although Terry meant well, he was duped (as I was last year when I forst
saw this)  

Let this post fade away!
