Subject: Re: on oil coolers

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have noticed our 83 diesel Vang. and our Audi have identical looking
&gt;'can' type oil coolers above the oil filter - is this a standard part
&gt;across the VW line - anyone know?  anyone care ?? ;)
&gt;
&gt;
The paper air filter is also the same for late model Audis and 
me '74 Kombi.  Those engineers, eh?  :-)
