&gt;     I was wondering how to tell them apart.  I didn't see anything about 
&gt;     the correct voltages, etc on the aux air reg. If neither of these 
&gt;     lines drop voltage after 12 seconds I guess the thermo-time sensor is 
&gt;     kaput.  I think the one I have came from a burned up engine - so I 
&gt;     don't know if it works or not. 
&gt;

The thermo time sensor only controls the cold start valve.  The circuit is
only energized while cranking.  Make sure switch is wired correctly.
 Polraity is important.  One terminal is grounded to activate the heater
inside it.  The heater and surrondinf temp determine how long cold start
valve will operate.  Incorect wiring will cause valve not to opoerate or
cause engine to flood.
