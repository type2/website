Subject: Please allow me to introduce myself

Hello, 
  Let me take this opertunity to introduce myself.  My name is Steve
Walker and my bus is a 64 Micro.  Just caught wind of the list and 
thought I'd say Hi. I used to live in California, where I had a stable
(61 Dlx w/corners, 66 Kombi, 64 Micro, 64 Micro, 66 Sqrbk, 74 Bug). I
have since moved to DC to do Grad work in physics at UMCP.  I use my 64
as a daily driver unless the weather is real bad.  Ive known all the 
previous owners and have a Dave Folts Trans with a homebrewed 1800.
Drove it out from the coast last march and had only one mishap. The 
speedo blew in Tenn.  Anyway hope to see ya round.

                                                  Steve
