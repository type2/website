Subject: Parting out '71 bus (fwd)
Date: Mon, 29 Aug 1994 09:37:39 -0700 (PDT)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

This is forwarded from the VW list...
&gt;
&gt;Hey now, all!
&gt;
&gt;We're parting out the ratty ol' Yellow Bus.  It's being hauled away in a
&gt;day or two, so if you want anything big like glass or the front seats
&gt;(which are extra-ratty, but solid frames), and you can come to Cleveland to
&gt;get it, let me know SOON, like today or tomorrow before it's gone.
&gt;
&gt;Little stuff has been/is being stripped off, so if you need anything, let
&gt;me know.  I'm keeping all of the engine stuff, but anything else is up for
&gt;grabs- lenses, handles, tranny, axles w/CV's, shifter, gauges ...
&gt;
&gt;I also still have some goodies left from the '77 bus that I parted out last
&gt;fall.
&gt;
&gt;Email me at wpc_at_po.cwru_dot_edu if you need anything.
&gt;
&gt;Would someone send this over to the Vanagon/Bus list for me?  Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;Bill
