&gt;&gt;U-Pull-It on Mack Road here in Scare-amento has a '67 standard ripe
&gt;&gt;fer pickin'!  It has a compleat seat of popout windows, guages, switches
&gt;&gt;n stuff.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Those gauges wouldn't happen to include a  oil pressure and temperature
&gt;..would they?

Sorry, just stanard early bus guages: Speedo and Gasso.
