FWIW, a buddy of mine just bought an '81 that had 150,140,150,150.  I 
am not sure about the order but those were the numbers.  These are 
outside of the range that the Bentley lists.  hmmmmm  This was with 
94,000 miles.  The mechanic who was checking it over said he wanted 
the name of number of the guy if my friend wasn't going to buy it.  He
took that as a sign that he should.  Turns out it was a California bus 
imported to South Carolina so it is basically rust free.

Also, thanks for all the help that is streaming in for my WWW 
connection.  When I know more about my computer set up here I will 
need to know more.  Turns out I was right about the knowledge and 
kindness of the people on this list.  :)
