Subject: BUS DEPOT E-MAIL WAS DOWN!

My ISP, GNN, which was supposed to close down on April 30, suddenly and 
without warning pulled the plug on their e-mail service, yesterday at around 
12 noon (two weeks early).  It is my understanding that any messages sent to 
The Bus Depot between then and now (1 pm Wed.) may be permanently lost.

My domain e-mail address (list_at_busdepot_dot_com) is now working again, via my new 
internet provider.  Please re-send any messages that you feel may have been 
lost.

I know that there has been a fair amount of lost e-mail to and from me over 
the last few weeks, thanks to my former internet provider.  Now that I have  
a new ISP, these problems will hopefully be a thing of the past.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

ps If someone could e-mail me directly to let me know this message made it to 
the list, I'd appreciate it; I am now temporarily unsubscribed.
