&gt; Has anyone seen the TV VW add for the Corrado with the &quot;bug's eye view&quot; ?

That was a GolfIII...

&gt; Wonder what that would be like if they did the same add for a Vanagon?

It would have to be a deer. &lt;KARUMPH!&gt; And then scenes of the Vanagon 
driving away with the deer nicely packed into the fiberglass Westfalia
luggage rack...
