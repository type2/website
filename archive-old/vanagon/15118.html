Subject: For Sale 1965 VW Camper in Toronto

No i haven't decided to sell my Westfalia.

Saw this ad in the Toronto Star yesterday.

1965 VW Van (camper) Orig, pop up roof, 5,000km rebuilt new tires, must
see. (416)530-1063 $1800 obo.

I went and saw the van after work yesterday. It was originally a B.C
vehicle Velvet green and white (not VW white i don't think). Van is
aftermarket camper conversion of what was originally a non-walk thru panel
van. Body is in &quot;good&quot; condition. There is rust (holes) underneath the
cargo doors and on the rocker panel on drivers side. Holes are just
beginning to form behind front wheels. Usual rust under windshield. The van
could use a good cleanup overall. It has potential, but would definitely
require some work. Of course it's owner thinks the rust is &quot;trivial&quot; and
can be fixed no problem. The van isn't so far gone as to be considered a
major resto, but would definitely require some work.

oh yeah, there has been this huge louvered window cut into the drivers
section behind the front door, must be about 4' long! I think the van was
converted by a company called adventure campers from elkheart indiana.
p.s.that rebuilt engine doesn't look to great IMHO.

give him a call if you're interested his name is Robert.
