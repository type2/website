Subject: RE: '54 RHD Deluxe Progress


&gt;Taking a break, I was looking at the lawn, and wondering why it was dying.
&gt;So I turned the sprinklers on.  Turns out I had a broken sprinkler - which
&gt;proceeded to shoot water at umpteen GPM straight thru the open safari
&gt;windows on the '56.  I stood there in shock for a couple seconds when I
&gt;realized what was happening, then shut the sprinklers down...


...and how many months/years has the '56 been parked in that spot? And
what condition are the floorboards/front upholstery?   :-O
