The wire holders and the radiator hoses are different for the 205/70 tires.  
The hoses should be okay either way, but you will have to modify or replace 
the holders.

Hey,

Well, I finally shod my '87 Vanagon with the Michelin MXT (Reinforced) 
205 's and I have a question.  Since I just bought my Vanagon with no 
spare, I went to a junkyard and bought a spare wheel which I also had 
mounted with the aforementioned 205/70/14 MXT's.  Here's the question:

I tried to mount the spare in the stock location under the front of the 
Vanagon and was only able to do so with a partial deflation (down to 20 
PSI) and some force.  Is this usual with this size tire (it was an option 
with the Alloy Wheels or did they use a space saver for the spare).

I know that several people on the list have used this size (some even 
larger) and I was wondering where y'all keep your spare.  Will I possibly 
do some damage this way?  (The tire shop had to use a floor jack to get 
it to close! - however it seems to clear all the hoses in that area).

Any help on this matter would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Perry
