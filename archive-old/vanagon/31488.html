Subject: BUS-electricals?

I've rebuilt the engine on my 78 bus, and now she won't start, I've been 
woking on finding this problem for several months, but no success. well, 
here it is...

It won't start, I get no spark, I get no voltage on the #1 ead(to the 
coil), my fuel pump doesn't run when key is in *on* position(not 
start...) and, I've tried every book I can, and the elecrical
system somewhat (pretty much) matches that specified in the VANAGON, 
1980-1982(I think) factory service manual's for a 1980-'82 Air Cooled, 
AFC injection controlled model. No diagram for the '78 is correct!!

HELP! I've been working on this since last summer! Noone here can help 
me, if anyone can offer ANY(YES ANY advice, I'm EXTRORDINARILY 
GRATEFULL!!!!!)advice, or has had this strange(to say
the least!!) occurence happen to them please let me know.

I thank you for reading this, and if you can, reply. thanks again, and, 
if this *did* happen to you, you have my sympathy(and probably no more 
hair, you tore it all out too!!)
