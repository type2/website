Subject: Head Replacement Questions

Well, I think I'm going to go with rebuilt heads from Mark Stephens (thanks
Sami), they really sound like they know what they're doing. Will be going
with larger intake valves as an option for alittle more power.

Now, the big decision, do it myself or pay about 6-8hrs labor(60$hr) to
have it done? I've replaced bug engines myself, but for some reason this
seems alittle more daunting. It's a 78 2.0l type IV, is this a difficult
job? Besides the heads what should I get? New pushrod tube seals, head
gaskets, piston rings?

If anyone has any advice for this job, or feel I should just take it in
(can't really stand the thought of paying someone to do this, but...)
please feel free to send suggestions. Thanks!   Tom
