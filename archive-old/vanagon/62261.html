&gt;&gt;

IMO there's no &quot;bad year&quot; for Vanagons. They ALL have the head gasket problem
(which, I'm sure you have been advised on by now). I'm assuming by you
mentioning &quot;later model&quot; you are referring to the '86 up Vans with the
2.1liter waterboxer engine. The '83.5-'85 had the 1.9 waterboxer. Also with
the '86 up vans you get power steering (introduced in '85).
When looking at a van, it is most inportant to check the head gasket and see
if you see any visible signs of coolant leaks. Look at the mileage and ask
the seller if he has ever had the head gaskets done. A recent head gasket job
is a good thing. (save you big bucks) Drive the van and let idle awhile in
park or neut. and see where the needle stays (or goes!) and hopefully that
little red blinking light won't come on....
it is a good time to check head gaskets when warm. 
Look for coolant puddles. Both overflow and reserve coolant tanks should have
coolant in them and be at their proper levels.
Check the powwer steering rack for leaks, and fluid level in cannister in
engine compartment
check a/c operation and compressor bearing noise.

there are probably other things to check that I left out, but those were the
basics.

good luck,
chris
