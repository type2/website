Chris,

I have had the oil changed at places like Jiffy Lube, etc. BUT YOU NEED
TO WATCH THEM LIKE A HAWK WHILE THEY DO IT!

After finding out (from me) that you fill the oil from behind the
license plate they proceeded to top off all the other fluid levels.
They were just about to top off the radiator expansion tank with
windshield washer fluid when I told them that it was for the radiator!
BTW don't ever let any of these places fill your expansion tank.
Vanagons require a phosphate-free antifreeze that most places do not
stock.

Good luck
