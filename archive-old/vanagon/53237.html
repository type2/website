Subject: Diesel timing tool

Anyone know where to get the gauge for timing a diesel injection 
pump?

Or possibly an alternate method, other than doing it by &quot;ear&quot; 
(doesn't seem to work for me).

Each time I've had it done, the VW &quot;specialist&quot; has managed to screw 
something else up, so I vowed next time I would figure it out 
somehow...

(I just changed head gasket, and don't think it was timed well before 
that...)

tia.
