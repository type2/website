&gt;When my local 'ASE' certified mech. replaced my tranny on my 87 syncro, he 
&gt;had to replace a piece of the shift linkage in an attempt to get the shift 
&gt;pattern to work (reverse was way left, hitting my gas pedal knee and very 
&gt;hard to get into first).  The new piece of linkage helped some:  the pattern

&gt;is tighter, but still way left and first is not quite as difficult to 
&gt;engage.  The mech. said the shift box also needs replaced.  Problem is he 
&gt;cannot locate one.  Tischer VW in Laurel, MD said that the units are MFG. in

&gt;Germany and are out of production.  Does anybody have any experience with 
&gt;this part?  Also,  what would alternate sources of a fairly low mi. box be 
&gt;to go with the new tranny/linkage?
&gt;

Shifter needs to be adjusted!  The shaft can be turned at the connection just
forward of the center of the van. New trans is sitting in a slightly
different position.  Turning the shaft one spline each way until right will
solve problem.
