Subject: :) Water 'n' Diesels - Compability problems?  

If you watch the news on TV, you may have heard that Europe is 
having a bad ol' time of it.  Floods similar to those of 
California have hit the continent, and we on the mildew green 
island are dripping wet too.

One scene of destruction last night had a view of the city 
centre of Cologne, Germany, with a VW/Audi dealer's sign 
bravely swinging above the garage - and barely 4 feet above the 
river ...

Ennis, my home town, is a habitat for sandbags and water-pumps 
this afternoon.  The council has diverted all the traffic 
coming in on the main road around the town - with all the 
tail-backs and frustration that involves.  (The correct name 
for Ennis in Irish is 'Inis Cluain Ramh-fhada' which means the 
island in the long-meadow of the honey.  Today, we just call it 
'Squelch'.)

The reason?  The centre of town is underwater.

Even Mill Road is underwater.  I can't ever remember that 
happening before, although my father sez that it was common 
back in the '40s and '50s, before they spent thosands of pounds 
on drainage schemes and a flood barrier on the river.  The car 
park beside the river is now an attractive stream, complete 
with cars, abandoned in just 12 inches of water 'coz the owners 
don't want to get wet ...

So, I hear you wail, what!!!

My ever-friendly local Volkswagen garage is 3 inches away from 
being submerged.  I'm just back from a prowl in the blue thing, 
spying out all the good puddles for later ;)  and I went to the 
garage.  The pumps and tanks were still operational and 
uncontaminated, so I filled 'er up!

This involved U-turns in 15&quot; of water, pulling up to the diesel 
pump, opening the side door and jumping onto the island.  A 
service truck went past as I stood there happily filling the 
tank and raised a sizable wave.  Some silly people in tiny 
Japanese tin-cans were stuck in the floods. &lt;evil grin&gt;  The 
guy at the garage looked at the service truck and said - I 
wouldn't drive a diesel through there.

Now I am *really* worried.  I have to admit that I get a great 
buzz (splash?) from going through the water - especially when 
it's up to the top of the wheels!  I wonder ... would my 
starting difficulties be due to my penchant for puddles rather 
than the glow-plugs?

Anyway, I led a group of three T4s through a mini-lake over at 
the Mill.  Boy, was it fun!  All the cars were tip-toe-ing 
through the turmoil until stupid here turns his Volkswagen into 
a speedboat!  And, naturally, the other T4 drivers followed 
suit.  It's great to feel (lake) superior.  :)

... The blue thing is wet, shivering and miserable in the road 
outside - but the engine's still working.
