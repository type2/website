Well, there's no room on my desk for much but computers, but I have a shelf
with half a valve on it and about a pound of slag - a memento of my '71
Super (after the fire) (along with a droopy stack of melted-together
microscope slides from my BioLab kit).

I also have a big collection of &quot;things that have punctured my tires&quot;.

We all probably have things like this, the distinction is in what gets
displayed versus what is just in storage...
