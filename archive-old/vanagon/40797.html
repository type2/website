Subject: Exterior Painted

Well, I've been scarce from the list lately (on digest) because I've
started my own list (for the discussion of human performance improvement).

I have, however, been working weekends and afternoons improving my bus.
The color I chose is called &quot;Aqua&quot;; it's a Dupont paint color used on late
model F*rds. It looks greenish blue to me. Hope no one finds this too
sacreligious, but hey; I'm the HMIC (head mechanic in charge) so I thought
I'd go for a color pleasing to MY eyes. I pondered matching the original
light blue for some time, but this will never be a show bus, so I broke
down and got the color I wanted. I must say, it seems a pretty natural
color for such a cool vehicle. 8)

The paint is on all but the front of the bus (where my windshield and
rusty seam await repair) and part of the rear window (where another rust
spot peeks out from beneath the seal). I'm planning on doing some brazing
to repair these unless I get better advice from the list. 

So now the '71 has found herself a name through the repetition of a song
in my head as I painted her. For now, at least, I'll call her AquaVan.
Stay tuned for the sure-to-follow theme song, which will be a 
bastardization of the rock classic &quot;Aqualung.&quot; 

It never ends, does it? In between painting I've been sanding 
brushed-on paint off the top (that d#%^_at_! PO!). Like I said before, it's 
bus &gt;resurection&lt;; not restoration.

8) Joe ('71 camper)
