&gt;So, what has worked in getting these nuts off for you? How big a
&gt;breaker bar, how long a cheater pipe? If I cook the nut with a
&gt;propane torch, will it cook the rubber grease seals?

This has been brought up before.  But any way, we use a 24 inch long
t-bar/breaker bar that is 3/4 inch drive with a 4 foot pipe for 
extra length.   We use a set of 3/4 drive sockets of the sizes we need and
not a whole set.  Just in case we come across a nut we can't get off we
can use a 1/2 to 3/4 adapter and impact sockets.  We have not broken
any of the tools with this set up.
