&gt; I've just subscribed to the mailing list and have read a lot about 
&gt; Red rock. Can anybody tell me what this is - I'm particularly 
&gt; interested in the various mentions of 'Buses rock jumping in the 
&gt; canyon !!??!' - What's all this about?. I would be very grateful if 
&gt; anybody could enlighten me.

Red Rock is a state park in the California desert.  Last weekend about
a dozen listmembers including myself met there for a weekend of camping,
which included an excursion up a really nasty dirt road.  =)  We will have
some pictures of the weekend and hopefully even some quicktime/mpeg movies
available for viewing on the web in a couple of weeks.
