Subject: gopher searches

I just tried the gopher to look at the vanagon archives.  In absence of 
decent docs on how this silly search tool works, I'm letting you know 
that boolean searches do work.  So, if you want all the messages that 
have the words gas and heater, just tell the search to look for 
gas and heater
or 
valves and dropped

Note that 
valves and drop
will not get you what you want.  The have to be words that were actually 
used in the messages as you list them in the search.  I'll try some other 
things, but I think you get a little of the drift.  It's much better than 
a singer word search.
