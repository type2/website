Subject: RMMW spring catalog, VANAGON SHEET METAL, etc.

Thumbs UP!!!

RMMW has added Vanagon stuff including all the sheet metal components 
Mill Supply no longer imports.

Thumbs DOWN!!!

Like most their stuff for Bus and Van, prices seem  about 1.5 -  2 
times what the stuff is/was going for elsewhere, still better than VW
and good to have at hand, since it's such a NICE CATALOG.
