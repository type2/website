Subject: speedo,oil,temp

 I have a 71 westy whose speedo runs five mph 
fast. Does anyone know why this is occurring and howto fix it, I have the 
standard tires.  I also have oil temp and pressure gauges that came with 
the bus.  Never having either one before I'm not sure what either one 
should read. I've asked a couple people and have gotten ranges that seem 
way to big.  Thyankds for any help.
