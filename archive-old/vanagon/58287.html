Greetings -

I am having difficulties waking up y '80 Vanagon after a long winter's
nap and would appreciate any pointers.

After a tune-up, grease job and oil change early December, I parked the
van in the garage.  In preparation of getting it back on the road for
the summer, I started it up.  It started right off, then died.  This
repeated ad nauseum (or whatever) and the smell of fuel was evident, but
not strongly.  When it ran, it ran poorly, with blue exhaust, almost as
though it was getting too much fuel.

Contrary to my normal practice, I parked the van for winter with only
half a tank of gas and did not add any fuel conditioner.  To this point
I have done nothing else.  What should I do and in what order of
preference?

Thanks in advance for the help I know is coming...

Cheers,

Jack Bateman
