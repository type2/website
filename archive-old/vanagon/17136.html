Subject: insurance


    Can anybody in the UK recomend a decent/cheap insurance company 
for insuring a 1971 bus. I've just got the van back on the road and 
I'm having difficulty finding someone to insure it. The only quote I 
have had has been for third party only. Will anybody insure it for 
fire and theft as well?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.


                    Cheers for now....
