Subject: Re: by the by ...

When I remove this transmission - specifically, the disconnection of the
drive shafts, do I have to put it on stands, or can I put it on ramps?

Also, does the hazett tool have a size, or is it one size fits all?
What size are those hex bolts holding the drive shaft on? Should I buy
new ones?

I'll hang around here till I get an answer, then I'll head out to the
parts places.
