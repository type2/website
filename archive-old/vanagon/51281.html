Subject: will an '87 switch fit an '81
Date: Tue, 5 Nov 96 9:59:16 EST

Hey all,
One quick check:  will the back-up light switch from an '87 Vanagon fit
an '81 Vanagon?  Anyone know for sure.  Assuming both have manual
transmissions, of course.  

Thanks a lot,
Sean

'81 Vanagon Westy             Was struck with astonishment.
'78 Bus (For Sale)            It was thickly grown with weeds.
			      &quot;Ha,&quot; he said,
			      &quot;I see that none has passed here
			      In a long time.&quot;
			      Later he saw that each weed
			      Was a singular knife.
			      &quot;Well,&quot; he mumbled at last,
			      &quot;Doubtless there are other roads.&quot;
