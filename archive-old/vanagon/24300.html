Subject: Re: Oil filter on a '69 transporter? (was: on a '74)



&gt;My '69 also has an oil filter and uses spin on fram cartridges.  Make it
&gt;kinda nice at oil change time.  This appears to be some after market type
&gt;adapter that goes on the oil pump.


Scott, how does that fit over/under/around/through the rear engine mount 
bar?
Something you copied from ol' Ben's bus?  :)
