&gt;turn your power mower in for a push or electric mower)

        I tried, the summer before last I went through THREE electric mowers
trying to keep my yard down and it's less than a quarter acre (at least I
think that it's less than that (here it is, .23 acre)).  They just don't
hold up, and all I am doing is nocking down the weeds, I'm not into the
grass lawn thing.

        I tend to feel that after the first big gains on auto polution
(74-76)the further gains have been an example of deminishing returns.  In
order to reduce over all auto poultion (and yes, I have writen my senators
on this point) the best way that I see is; basic emissions controls
(EGR,PCV,Catalitic converters, and unleaded fuel), then take the rest of the
money (I'm talking GDP allocation here) and put it into light rail and
bicycle development.  Result, reasonably clean cars driving fewer miles.

        I am still having trouble with my 82 diesel.  It is not reving up
under load, ther is air geting into the fuel (Ican see it in the clear line,
it is most visible when I turn the engine off) I am deting ready to replace
the line from the tank to the filter, does that sound reasonable?
