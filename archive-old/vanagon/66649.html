Subject:      Re: list

More probable is that he's been on vacation for only a couple of days and
his email account maxed out from all the Vanagon List threads on Tires,
Alloy Wheels, and the surprise that all our Westfalias amazingly sag from
the extra 300 lbs plus drivers weight on the same side!

Ah hem... it's Friday.  And of course let Free Speech reign... even on the
List.
