Subject: Re: '96 Eurovan rumours [f]

In the January issue of Automotive Engineering, page 80 there is a picture of 
the something called the Volkswagen MPV.  It looks like the Honda minivan, it 
said to have engine options of a 2.8 liter V6 and a diesel.  The concept 
vehicle has a five cylinder direct-injection turbodiesel.  Next to the picture 
of the Volkswagen is an illustration of a Renault Espace F1 concept, and below 
that is a picture of something called a Ford Galaxy? which is supposed to be 
built in collaboration with Volkswagen in Portugal.  The Galaxy is identical 
to the Volkswagen MPV.
I don't have any scanning ability, otherwise I would have sent the picture 
somewhere for viewing.
