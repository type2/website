Subject: Oil Pressure?!?!  Where did it go...



Hi, 

  I just installed oil pressure and oil temp gauges in my '66 
and noted some troubling things.

  When cold, the oil pressure is about 47 (which sounds about right when
compared to my bug).  However, as the engine warms up, the pressure drops
to about 30 (or less) when running at 65mph and at idle sits at about 13.
The engine is reputed to have come out of a '74 KG (as yet unverified).

  Also, the engine thinks about stalling when idling at stop lights when the
engine is cold.  A little tap of the gas pedal changes its mind for a little
while, then it thinks some more, and I give it a tap again...

Any ideas?

Thanks,
...Markus
