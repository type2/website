Subject: adding power locks

I'm interested in adding the power lock option to the front doors of my
'86.  I understand that there are contacts that are needed to operate the
sliding door, so in order to keep the project simple I will stick to just
the front.  What is involved in adding the lock mechanism to the doors and
then running power?  Would it be easier to purchase a stock wiring harness to
plug into the fuse block and feed the locks?  Unfortunately there aren't any in
any junk yards around here that I can see how this system is assembled.  I've
looked at J.C. Whitney for a simple solution, but those units need a place
to add a switch.  I do enjoy stock.  Any advice or suggestions are
appreciated.

Thanks,
Doug
