Subject:      West Texas Trip

Hey gang,

Can any of you West Texas denizens give me some travel tips for a great
vacation to your neck of the woods?

I am planning leave Atlanta the third week of October with Big Bend N.P.,
Davis Mts., and maybe a stopover in San Antonio in my very loose interniery
(sp?) so far.

Any recommendations as to camping, tex-mex restaurants, fossil digs, or
whatever?

This is the closest desert I can drive to as I only have 9 days vacation time.

I am going on 4 months now with a dealer tag - no luck passing emissions so
I am shooting for a waiver tommorrow to buy time to figure out why Mr.
Digijet does not want to behave.  Guess I will have to become a self-taught
FI expert.
