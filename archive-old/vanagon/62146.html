I added a switch on my dash to turn the fan on high speed.  The switch 
actuates the relay to avoid high current through the switch.  The only time 
I use it is in the mountains and in parking lots called expressways.  I'd 
rather keep it cool rather than letting it get hot before it tries to cool 
itself.
