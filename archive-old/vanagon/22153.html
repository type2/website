&gt; Ted, they don't list tents, and I figure they would if they had them. They do
&gt; have all else though: the rear door screen, canvas cot for over the front
&gt; seats or the top bunk, the top seal, etc. There address is:

I called VW Canvas about a year ago to ask about canvas for my pop top 
(still haven't bought it though).  I asked about tents.  They said they 
had looked into it but it was too labor intensive so the prices would be 
too high for the market.
