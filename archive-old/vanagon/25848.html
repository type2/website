Subject: Are T-Shirts Still Available (grovel..grovel)


Ok, I admit it...I screwed the pooch...metaphorically that is...

Deb, Alex and I took the EuroVan up to Transporterfest this
morning and there we met Drew Jenkins and his Synchro....Drew
had on the list t-shirt...needless to say, after I saw the
shirt I wanted one...are there any left? Huh...Huh...please??
