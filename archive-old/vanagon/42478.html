Subject: Re: Colour combinations for '62 standard


The Bus is two tone, white on top, and a &quot;peachy&quot; colour on the lower
panels.  The dash and interior trim are also peach/apricot in colour.
The daughter-in-law swears that it has never been painted ... and it
looks like original paint.  Can anyone tell me if &quot;peach&quot; was a valid
factory colour for '62?

it sounds like white and sealing wax  red.   the red fades to a colour some
call orange, some pink, its hard to describe.   if you polish it up it is
more brickish red - just like sealing wax, actually.   it is said to be a
very difficult colour to have mixed accurately.

for the last five to ten years.  The 36bhp power(less) plant would
likely need some work..

a 62 would have come with a 40hp when new

.the engine compartment was clean and much
taller than in my '67 ...

not when new, unless it was modified

.looks like there is a spare tyre mount to the right of the engine...

sounds modified.    good luck with getting a new bus.
