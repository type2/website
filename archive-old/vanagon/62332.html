Looked seriously at the conversion as I had a lead on a fairly nice 3.2 but
you give up your heater.  I ski and that isn't an option, no heater that is.

Now the reliability of that motor is legendary and if a heating method could
be found...Nah ten grand is just too much.  

Now what was Kennedy's number?
