&gt; Only 16 mpg around the city?  In a Westy?  What the heck are you expecting?
&gt; That is more than what you should get, don't mess with anything else!
&gt; You'll just reduce the milage.  These heavy vehicles are only supposed to
&gt; get 18-19 on the highway, although many (including myself) have gotten as
&gt; much as 21mpg.  But more than 16 in the city is just not to be expected.

My wife and I just returned from a trip to Giorgia, Tennessee, Alabama
from Ontario, Canada. We drove the long stretches on Interstates (why is
the wind always head on?) and took lesser roads through all the
beautiful mountains we could find. The whole trip was 2960 miles and we
AVERAGED 20.76 miles/gallon (thats US gallon and US miles). Wow you guys
have good gas (92 to 94 octane of all brands). 
More seriously, I think what made ALL THE DIFFERENCE was the INJECTOR
CLEANER I used three times allong the trip.
