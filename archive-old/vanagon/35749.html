Regarding Jim Davis' Car-Top:

&gt;It appears (from the pictures &amp; descriptions) to be very high quality and
&gt;design, however I haven't seen one in preson yet.  It includes a 2&quot; foam
&gt;mattress that is larger than queen size - I forget the dimensions.  The
&gt;weight is 69 lbs.  It can hold up to 400 lbs - depending on your vehicle &amp;
&gt;roof racks.  The roof rack is NOT included.
&gt;

OK, How much weight can a Vanagon hold on a standard top?
The owners manual says something about 200 lbs as I recollect.
I hope the manual limit means what the sheet metal on top will
hold without a rack.  
 
On roof racks, most attach to the rain gutters, right?  What will
they hold?  Mom and Dad and a trampoline I hope, but who's
going to be the first to try it?

Thanks Vanagon-heads.  I'm learning a lot here!
