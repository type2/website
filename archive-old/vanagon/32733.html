&gt;Percolating coffee is not the best way to make good coffee... but then 
&gt;not everyone like espresso.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and as far as I know... you just let the thing percolate for about 5 
&gt;minutes.  The premise is that it keeps putting the coffee/water through 
&gt;the grounds.  I'd suggest a Melita drip maker.  :)

Bradley i have one of the same type coffee makers.  It makes a mean
espresso.  I use mine mostly but not exclusively for backpacking.  I have
the 2-cup  and the one-cup styles.  It is alot nicer than putting the coffee
in a cut-off piece of nylon stockings and then into boiling h2o.  and or
just putting the coffee into the h2o and getting your true &quot;Bum's Coffee.&quot;
