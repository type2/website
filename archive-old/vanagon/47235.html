Subject: 89 Vanagon 4spd Problem - Stuck in 3rd-


My 89 Westy (100,000 mi) 4 spd recently stuck in 3rd gear and would not come 
out.  I crawled under the van, and worked the shift rod and linkage on the 
tranny to get it out of third.  From there on out I shifted 1st, 2nd, 4th 
for the remainder of my thousand mile trip back to New Jersey. (0-60 in 
about 15 min.)  Figures, perfect camping weather and I'm grounded with 
mechanical problems.  UGH !!!!!!!!!

The details:
 -There was no warning, the tranny always shifted perfectly and had never 
been stiff to shift.
 -There are no strange or unusual noises coming from the tranny.
 -The situation will occur everytime I shift it to third gear.
 -I found out later that being very forceful from inside the van will get it 
out of third gear.
 -The van drives normally and shifts normally until it is shifted into third.

Unless someone tells me otherwise, I'm going to try adjusting the linkage. 
 The only thing that bothers me is that my logic would tell me if it were a 
linkage adjustment both third and forth would be stubborn.  The other odd 
think is I have never seen a tranny where the shifter gets stuck in a gear, 
usually once it is in gear you can get it out.
Advise?  Words of wisdom?

I think someone (Joel??) posted a quick guide on how to do an adjustment of 
the shift linkage and if anyone has it handy it would be greatly 
appreciated.

Please reply directly to me at my E-Mail address as I am temporarily off the 
list.

Thanks in advance,
Peter Jensen
