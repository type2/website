So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Bardley et al:  I went back to West Marine to look at the 12v blender,
&gt; because when I first saw it, I neglected to check the price.  This
&gt; time I did:  it was over $100.    :(((((((((((((((((((  I guess
&gt; the lucky ones who shower are just going to have to make their
&gt; margaritas manually...

For cryin' out loud, I know it's Friday and all, but this IS a camping
trip.  Oh my god, I'm really gonna have to rough it.  I'll have to have
my Margarita on the rocks!  How will I ever live.  ;p
