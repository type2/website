 Here's a message from a coworker of mine with a wasserboxer. I'll happily
 forward any suggestions the list may have to him.

&gt; Problem Description:
&gt; 
&gt; My 1990 Vanagon has a very slow water leak that
&gt; appears to be coming from the the box(?) the oil
&gt; filter seals on. I have pulled the fan belt off
&gt; to check the water pump; bearings felt good, no
&gt; slop in shaft, and no bearing noise when running.
&gt; Also, I can't find any evidence of the leak coming
&gt; from the water pump. The engine leaks a drip or
&gt; two at a time when the engine is running, and drips
&gt; for a few hours afterwards, and then stops dripping.
&gt; It's probably only losing a couple oz.s of water per
&gt; running. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I lay under the car and watch it, it looks like
&gt; the drip is forming at the bottom corner of the box
&gt; the oil filter is sealing on. 
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Does this problem sound familiar?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. What is this box the oil filter sits on? Is
&gt;    it removable?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. How should/can this leak be fixed?
&gt;
