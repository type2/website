&gt;&gt;DON'T LUG THE ENGINE UNDER LOAD - take hills in lower gears at high RPM
&gt;&gt;DON'T FLOOR IT - except for brief periods.  Use 3/4 throttle and downshift.
&gt;&gt;LISTEN FOR PINGING - if you hear ANY at all ease up NOW or your heads
&gt;&gt;        will eat themslves alive.  Take measures to correct the pinging
&gt;&gt;        asap (like higher octane gas, retard timing, lower compression).
&gt;&gt;BUY AND INSTALL GAUGES - It's one of those things where you can spend a
&gt;&gt;        little now, or a lot later.

Regarding pinging.  A properly operating EGR system will reduce Pek Flame
temparatures which will also reduce pinging.  Engine will run cooler and head
temparature will remian controlled under normal loads.  Note that the EGR
does get bypassed at full throttle.  One more reason to not keep throttle
floored for long period of time.
