John,
Thanks for the information.  Actually, I thought it looked kinda ugly :) . 
I just don't like the look of the Vanagon with the high roof.  I can stand
the sight of a Bus with the high roof but it still doesn't sit very well
with me.  Nothing like dramatically raising the center of gravity to add
fun to your commute :) .

What's the interior setup on these like?  Is it more convenient/less
convenient than the Westy?  What's your take on it?

Sean

&gt; It's most likely an &quot;Adventurewagen,&quot; made by Adventurewagen, Inc., in
Fort
&gt; Bragg, CA.  Although the company is still in business, the owners
switched
&gt; to Fords after the introduction of the Eurovan.  The company has
&gt; historically acted as an informal broker for used vehicles, so if you are
&gt; interested in the Vanagon conversion you might give Ed Andersen there a
&gt; call.  There is also a basic web site - I don't have the URL handy, but
&gt; searching under the company name will get you there easily.
&gt; 
&gt; The fiberglass top adds 18&quot; to the van height, for an approximate height
of
&gt; 8.'  The fact that I, at 6'1&quot;, can stand up inside, is the envy of my
&gt; Westie-owning friends.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt; Today while driving by the local VW dealer I saw a Vanagon sitting in
the
&gt; &gt; lot apparently awaiting servicing.  Why anyone would take it to the
&gt; dealer
&gt; &gt; is beyond me, but that's another story :) .  This Vanagon was an
&gt; air-cooled
&gt; &gt; model and had a non-Westfalia camper coversion.  It had a white
fiberglas
&gt; &gt; roof similar to the roof on David Schwarze's Safare camper, with the
&gt; &gt; sliding windows on the sides of the high-roof.  The camper was beige
and
&gt; &gt; the roof was white, looked like it added a couple feet to the van. 
&gt; Anyone
&gt; &gt; know what company made this type of conversion for Vanagons?  Could it
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; been a Safare?  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've not seen this one around town before, thought it was kinda
&gt; interesting
&gt; &gt; :)
&gt; &gt;
