&gt; Hi group-
&gt; I would be very curious (and appreciative) if people would post their 
&gt; fuel mileage they are getting with their various rigs out their.  It 
&gt; would give us all an idea of what to expect from different 
&gt; engines/configurations as we continue our search for that ultimate 
&gt; van.  It also is a good overall indicator of engine health. Those of you not bogged
&gt;  down in the U.S. nomenclature of *miles per gallon* are welcome to post km per
&gt;  liter or whatever you use.  We can figure it out -- it'll be our punishment for not 
&gt; going metric when we had the chance.

i have a '93 eurovan, automatic, fuel injection, white with wife and 
miniature daschhound and often with grandchild.

in the city i am getting 10 to 12 mpg.

on the highway, at about 55 to 65 mph, i am getting about 15 to 16 mpg.

power is very good. i ALWAYS use premium octane fuel.

i am NOT pleased with the fuel milage. i think it should be much better.

the mechaninc at the VW dealer tells me that everything is fine and that 
i just drive in such a way that i get bad milage.

i accelerate gradualy, i don't speed up and slow down alot, and i have 
always gotten much better milage than was expected with other vehicles i 
own or have owned. this includes trucks, busses, cadilacs, older VW 
vans, buicks, station wagons, etc., etc.

maybe he's right, but i would like to know how the computer controlling 
the engine is programmed. i would addapt my driveing style to agree with 
it.

i am very interested in getting messages that i can print out and take to 
him as stories of how other people are doing with their eurovans.
