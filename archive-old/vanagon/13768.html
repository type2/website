&gt;  Although my bus is out of commission, a contingent of Kautzini are still
&gt;  interested in attending the Red Rock bash, despite having to camp in a tent.
&gt;  What I want to know is:
&gt;
&gt;  Are we still welcome?

if the Red Rock bunch is anything like the pizza party and those ffolkes at
Pheiffer, i doubt if anyone will be sober/conscious/alert enough to even
notice!!!

&gt;  Will we be teased incessantly for the entire weekend if we show up in a
&gt;  &lt;gag, retch&gt; Oldsmobile station wagon?

as the Magnolia Mufti-Mararishi (ah ha?) and Possum Potentate (self-appointed)
of the clan, i hereby announce the the following Canon:
   Any automobile, no matter how base and retched, may be used to attend any
   good fellowship gathering of the Buses of the World, providing that the
   following ceremonies and services shall be performed prior to entering the
   Most Exalted Presence of the Poobahs of Transporterdom:
   (1) A moderately expensive German beer (Dutch will do; cannot be French)
       must be purchased with folding money. This beer must be shaken (not
       stirred) and sprayed upon the facia and radiator of the offensive yet
       semi-reliable vehicle. Thus annointed, the vehicle is rendered safe
       for the Gathering. This beer must NOT be washed off until after the
       event, lest a flat tire befall the occupants.
       (note: the practical purpose of this is that the beer attracts more
        bugs and road dirt, thus disguising the vehicle altogether).
   (2) The headlights, windshield, side windows, and taillights must be
       rubbed with a strip of flannel, wrapped around a moderately fresh
       prune. This will ensure Vision and the Light of Wisdom necessary to
       find those other nuts out in the Wilderness.
   (3) Upon return to the presence of the Disabled One, who was left behind
       in sorrow and solitude, offers of New Parts and Fresh Oil must be
       made. New spark plugs would be nice. Maybe some new tires. How bout
       some windshield gaskets?

Thus being placated, the Fates will smile upon you. :)

&gt;  How stupid would I be if I was to pretend I never saw those bits of metal,
&gt;  put fresh oil and filter on my bus and take it Red Rock anyway &lt;round trip
&gt;  750 miles&gt;?

uhhhhhhh ... i don't think i'd chance it, Dave. you can only push Good Luck
so far. ;)
