There is a simple way to determine if the switch is faulty w/o having to
remove it. Have your engine at operating temp; this may require that you
rev the engine(2-3000 rpm) for a full 5 minutes; in otherwords simulate
those moments when the fan normally comes on and check and make sure if it
does or doesn't. If it does then you will have to look elsewhere for the
problem. If not, then remove the plug from the
switch and short the two connectors; this will simulate a closed circuit, if
the switch is at fault the fan should run. If you wish you can make
the connection permanent meaning that the fan will run all the time; the
cost is perhaps a slight loss of fuel economy (very tiny) and some drain
on the system. I do not recommend doing this permanently if you are in a cold
climate. If the fan does not run, then it could be a faulty wiring
problem; a fuse or a bad fan (unlikely).....good luck - DC
