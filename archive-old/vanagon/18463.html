Subject: Mill Supply, happy ending, maybe?

	(Wow- 6 messges all weekend- I guess Type 2 owners DO have more fun!)

	I called Mill Supply again this morning and the nice woman I spoke
with had good news for me- said that my panel had been recieved by tnem
5/23 and that they had shipped it out. Ok- I'm easy- they get another
week (Well, until the weekend). ARGH!!! Anyway!!! Could this BE harder? 
Lets hope not!!!

	Bill
