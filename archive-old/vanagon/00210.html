&gt; ]&gt;  Hi,
&gt; ]&gt; 	Further to my post last week about high performance versions of the
&gt; ]&gt; transporter (to which I've had no replies/followups: Humff, I thought it was
&gt; ]&gt; quite good! :-) 
&gt; ]
&gt; ]Huh?  I don't remember any post like that, and I doubt I would have missed
&gt; ]it, since the subject interests me!
&gt; 
&gt; Me, too.  I'm sure it would have caught my eye if it'd shown up here.  I
&gt; think it got posted in mars.general.

William,
Were you referring to this?

&gt;From a previous post by Mr. Warburton:

 Hmm, maybe you should look at the custom conversions that put 911 flat sixes
into vanagons, I suspect that VW don't have plans to put anything that
powerful into their vans but then what do I know? :-)

 Maybe VW will try to compete with the Renault Espace, I can see the
advertising already... 

 &lt; Camera pans across rugged mountain landscape, an incredibly twisty road
devoid of traffic is being negotiated by a short-wheelbase front-engined
transporter with a windsurfer strapped to the roof, a stunningly beautiful
woman and an impossibly cute child in the passenger seat and a group of
exquisitely tailored businessmen chatting in the rear.&gt;

 *fade up ethereal music, reminiscent of Clannad being played on Didgeridoos*

 &quot;A *new* concept in sports-recreation, an executive vehicle with *space* for
a boardroom or a family car with *exciting* performance...The new Transporter
GTI from Volkswagen is all of these and more! With it's close ratio gearbox
and VR6 engine the Transporter GTI features mindblowing acceleration, it's
lowered and stiffened suspension promises spirited handling and the 16&quot; alloy
wheels with low-profile tyres offer tenacious grip! 

 &quot;Open your mind to the versatility of the Transporter GTI, the new sportsvan
from Volkswagen!&quot; 

 &lt; Camera pans out from van arriving at luxury hotel, windsurfers are visible
pulling barrel rolls in the background despite total absence of wind in the
plam trees. &gt;

 *fade out*

 Actually, I rather like the idea, maybe Porsche could contribute to a
Transporter RS2? A transporter Quattro turbo? A transporter coupe?

End of quote
