Subject: '64 Bus front end &amp; Berkeley info

Hi all!  

A couple of questions here.

1) I'm looking at some work on my '64 Bus front end.  A couple of people
have recommended replacing with a '68 front end -- &quot;it just bolts up&quot;, they say.

Anyone done this?  What is involved and what would I gain - handling, brakes?


2) I'm new to the Oakland, Berkeley, CA area.  Could someone local email
with recommendations for a good old VW repair shop, parts house and/or body
shop, please?  I left my old network of VW folks in Oregon :-(.


3) Any ideas on these items?

- how to put in more modern shoulder-type seat belts???

- slick ideas on how to make the bus doors LOCK better???


4) Since this group is called Vanagon...  I'm also thinking *alot* about a
Syncro.  Any buying pointers?

Thanks in Advance for your help!  

'64 Bus
