Subject: Help please Type IV engine and auto tranny probs!

Okay, a quick recap to clue everyone in.  I'm putting a '78 2.0l engine 
into my '73 bus which has an auto tranny.  The 2.0l spins fine until I 
torque down the 5 bolts that hold the driveplate on (65 ft/lb).  Then it 
won't budge at all.  It doesn't seem to be catching on anything and I was 
wondering if I'm missing something obvious.  Do I need to check endplay 
at all with the automatic or anything like that?  Please help, I'm so 
close.  It's been off the road since June.
Thanks.
-Erik.
