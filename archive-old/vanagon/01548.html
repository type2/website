Ok i got my '73 bus up and running yesterday.  It had been sitting for
quite some time - like a coupla years.  Occassionally i would start it up
and tool down the drive.


Ater hitting the road for about 15-20mins yesterday, i smelled burning
brakes.  Sure enough the front pads were firmly against the disc. 
Hammering against them would loosen them, but once i pushed on the brake
they would lock up again.  

Is this problem fixable?  Has anyone else ever had this type of thing
happen?  

I guess the bus didn't like the neglect for so long.  I promised it that i
would take better care of it from now on :-)

Thanks for any advice,  Randy
