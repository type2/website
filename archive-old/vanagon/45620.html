Subject: Re: First breaker-bar of the summer!!!

instead of using the fle handle, which, btw, WILL break, borke a few 
myself, on a gland nut, go for the ugly chrome looking slide handle. 
heavy, cost half as much, but much stronger. put a nice 10 foot cheater 
on it, and a lot of blocks to keep the car from rolling...

&gt; Before you cut it off, try this: buy a 3/4&quot; flex handle from Sears, get a 4
&gt; foot long piece of pipe that will fit over the end of the flex handle.  Set
&gt; it in position with the socket on the nut, and stand and bounce a little on
&gt; the end.
&gt; 
&gt; That will generate something like 600-750 ft. lbs. of torque on the
&gt; nut....it will come off!!  And if that's not enough, get a passing stranger
&gt; to stand on it with you. You may have so much torque that the wheel will
&gt; spin, but that's another problem....
&gt; 
&gt; Flex handles are much tougher than and ratchets, and with Sears, if it
&gt; breaks, which it won't, they'll give you a new one.
&gt; 
&gt; What helps is having a slow steady increase in true torque.  As opposed to
&gt; say, banging with a hammer or bouncing on a short handle.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW I have found that the nuts &quot;look&quot; like they're fused to the drum on
&gt; those axles.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't have access to a Sears, the have a 800 number and you can mail
&gt; order it.  Tools are the one thing Sears still will mail odrer.

&gt; &gt;ar was 3/4&quot; drive...that's what amazed I!  I broke a
&gt; &gt;1/2&quot; drive one today attacking the nut again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I am half tempted to get another nut and cut this one off....
&gt; &gt;
