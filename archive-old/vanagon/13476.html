Subject: Re: HELP advise on purchase of '70 camper

Bart wants to buy this bus:

&gt;have a couple questions that I need help with.  He says the '70 has  
&gt;&quot;some&quot; rust, the battery compartment is bad, and the sliding door he  
&gt;says has a problem.  He describes it as there is an area on the  
&gt;bottom track where water has a hard time getting out and it needs  
&gt;fixed because the door will jump out there if you aren't carefull. 
&gt;
&gt;Also he describes a rubber drive bushing by the steering box that is  
&gt;bad and needs replaced ??  
&gt;
&gt;He says it runs good, swears it has only 36K miles on it, canvas top  
&gt;is good, has an ice box, sink, and stove, also has an extra more  
&gt;powerfull engine in his basement that would go, and the '71 would go  
&gt;with it for $1000.00
&gt;

With a bad sliding door and steering box, this van is not worth $1000.00.
The rust you mentioned probably means more extensive rust elsewhere.  When
you go look at the van, lie underneath it and check out every square foot
of the undersides and wheel wells.  Poke around with a screwdriver, and
take a long careful time.

I got a 1970 camper (in NY state) with rusty rocker panels and battery
tray, leaky windshield, extra engine, extra tranny, 5 rims, and assorted
parts for $500.  Offer this guy $400, tops, with the &quot;powerful&quot; engine
included.  But when you get this bus, be prepared to make many repairs, and
experience many hassles.

&gt;What parts from a '71 would be usable on a '70 ?

Many of them, but don't bother with this van.
