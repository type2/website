&gt;Conditions of squeak under front passenger seat:
&gt;        Squeak seems to be inside, directly under seat, when bus is in 
motion.
&gt;        Does not occur when bus is stopped, or when someone sits in 
seat.
&gt;        -Intermittent, and somewaht related to the road condition.
&gt;
&gt;        It does not seem to come *from* the seat,
&gt;                 more from the &quot;box&quot; under the seat.
&gt;
&gt;        Thanks.

&gt;&gt;     Lulie,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     It would help if you provided a little more information.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     What are the conditions under which you hear the squeak?  Is the
&gt;&gt;     squeak inside or outside the van?  Does the squeak occur when the van
&gt;&gt;     is stopped or moving?  When going over bumps?  Is it constant or
&gt;&gt;     intermittent?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;Hell oall
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front passenger seat
&gt;&gt;|on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a passenger is seated.
&gt;&gt;Any suggestions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks.
&gt;&gt;Lulie
