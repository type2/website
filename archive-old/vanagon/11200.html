Subject: Re: westy auxillary battery

On 2/5/95 Steve Manning mentioned setting up an auxillary battery.

I have an '80 westy and I've thought about doing the same thing.  You need
some type of isolator to allow charging of both batteries from the alternator,
 but all lights, stereos, heater( big drain), 'puters, large screen TVs,
whatever, run only off aux. battery and can't drain the main battery used for
starting engine.  While I haven't really investigated yet, I also did looked
in Whitney.  Steve, you mentioned they didn't have a system for VW's.  I
don't have the catalog in front of me but I could'a sworn there was one
listed for &quot;Volkswagon Vans&quot;.  It was confusing though, with several different
 ones listed.  I'll try and check.  Did you actually call them?

Has anyone else done this?  Should you use a deep discharge marine type
battery for the aux.?  Also, is there a way to figure the amount of time the
power will last before aux. battery drains?  Is it worth it, or will lights
and radio drain the battery in an hour or so anyway?

Interested in hearing more from the collective brain trust.
