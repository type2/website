&gt;Also, do you need to unsubscribe from the list?

well ... you won't get 73 messages every day. maybe one great big mutha
every couple of days. but you won't get beeped every five minutes with
another vanagon list message. ;)

you shouldn't have to unsubscribe. but some folks have said that trying to
