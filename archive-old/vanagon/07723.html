&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   Curious: does the sound peak at 58-60 and then decline above say 65 or get
&gt; &gt;   worse? If the former it could be some kind of &quot;sympathetic harmonic
&gt; &gt;   vibration&quot;. I have noticed this in my KG and Westy but it may occur in other
&gt; &gt;   engine types as well - DC
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; David, Stuart would have to find an 8-mile, 10% slope tp get his
&gt; diesel over 65 mph -- can you think of some other practical diagnostics? :-)
Amazingly enough, one can indeed do this over Bozeman pass.  In fact, i did,
but I could not get the sound to come back.  In fact, I can actually get the
vanagon up to 73 going down the pass.  If the sound comes back again, I will
try to find out more about it.  However, I don't believe it was road noise.
Stuart
