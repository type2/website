Subject:      Avalanche of postings

So long friends.  I am out of here, mainly because I can't handle the
volume of individual emails posted to this listserve.  Other listserves
that I am on combine all mails received within 8-16 hours on a single
message.  I just returned from four days out of town and there were over
250 individual mailings from this listserve.  Sorry, I can't handle it.

Good luck to everyone, and have fun!!
