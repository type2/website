Subject: 85 mtr -&gt; 84, Xtra Vac. Lines??

Hi All,

I have just completed the installation of an 85 1.9 Wasser motor from a
Westy (the PO installed a V-6 Chevy) into my 84 GL Brownie Bus.  It was
pretty much a straight forward job and almost started right up--until the
battery went dead.  Dang 20 degree weather!!  The 85 motor included the
electronics, exhaust, FI, etc., but the problem I am having is sorting out
the extra vacuum lines. These are the larger ones on the air-cleaner side
of the motor.  On is even has a Y-shaped fitting on it.  The 85 only had 
one large-ish vacuum line coming from a FI part to the rubber throttle body 
to air sensor elbow.  Should I try to utilize the 85 vacuum lines and plug
the extraneous appearing lines or go with the old 84, single line?  Also,
the fitting for the small vacuum line coming from the charcoal(?) gizmo
is broken.  Short of replacing the fitting, any suggestions for a quick
fix?  I need Brownie back on the road and out of my post-preganacy wife's
garage stall!!  (Mom &amp; new baby boy Sam are doing great as is Big brother
Tony &amp; Dad).    8-)  8-)  8-)  8-)
