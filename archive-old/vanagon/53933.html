&gt; So for a Syncro, its O.K. to tow it with all four wheels on the ground for
&gt;  unlimited distances and at unlimited speeds?

Yes.  &quot;Warp 7 Scotty!&quot;

&gt; Is this because the VC might act up if the front or rear wheels were not
turning at 
&gt; the same speed?

Sort of.  The VC would make (or attempt as best it could) the front &amp; rear
wheels turn at the same speed.  If you lifted the front wheels and rolled on
the back, the VC would make the front wheels turn at the same speed as the
back, causing the VC to be &quot;locked up&quot; for a long period of time, which is
not a good thing.  If the front wheels were attached to a sling the wheels
would turn and probably tear the sling apart.

NEVER have a Syncro towed with 2 wheels off the ground.  Either all of them
ON the ground or all of them OFF the ground on a flatbed.
