&gt; &gt; I saw an 88 Vanagon GL Camper in a parking lot the other day and looked
&gt;  &gt; inside.
&gt;  &gt; On top of the steering column, between the steering wheel and gages,
 the
&gt;  &gt; usual plastic cover piece was replaced by something I hadn't seen
before.
&gt;  &gt; The cover piece on this van had a large &quot;display&quot; like thing on it.  It
wa
&gt;  &gt; molded into the piece and must have come from the factory.  It protruded

&gt;  &gt; up from the usual slope toward the gages and presented the driver with a
1.25&quot;
&gt;  &gt; tall x 2&quot; wide rectangle that looked like it was dark red plastic.  Sort
 of
&gt;  &gt; like a warning indicator or display of some sort.
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Many cars now place their emergency flasher switch &amp; light in this
position,
&gt;  &gt; but this van had those in the usual position on the right side of the
&gt;  &gt; instrument binnacle with the defroster switch.
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Any one have any idea what this is?  I'm not too familiar with the
Camper
&gt;  &gt; models, but have looked them over in the past &amp; haven't noticed anything
like
&gt;  &gt; this.
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; By the way, the van has a manual tranmission and was not a Syncro.

&gt; Was it a roller type switch that is the thermostat setting for a seat
&gt; heater? That is what I have on my '91.&quot;

And Joel Walker writes:
&gt; from the info i've seen, that would be the switch for the heated seats.
&gt; i think it has some sort of temperature indicator or adjustment.
&gt; must be nice, eh? :)

And then Chris P.   Seattle writes:
&gt; WAYou dog!  Heated seats?  Is there anyway on earth the rest of us mere
&gt; mortals could aquire such a luxury

I continue:
Sorry, I've seen the little thumwheel style knobs there for heated seats and
this is not anything like a thumwheel.  It looks like a little electronic
display of some sort.

Any other theories????
