Subject: 92 EV Westy evaluation/sale

        Would anyone knowledgeable about the EV, give me
a ball park figure on the value of the Eurovan my neighbour
is selling?  He is also willing to deliver it, if it would facilitate
a sale.  The particulars follow:

        1992 VW Eurovan Westfalia camper
        2.5 litre five cylinder gas motor
        standard transmission, five speed
        23,000 miles, medium green
        power steering, power brakes
        power locks, cruise, air conditioning
        no cracks, dents, rust or crashes
        original factory Continental tires
        everything in most excellent condition

Thanks muchly..........
