Subject: HP and torque specs wanted

Hi Volks,
   Just wondering if anyone knows what the Horse power and torque
specifations are for 2.0L aircooled, 1.9L and 2.1L engines are?  As most of
you know I have a '82 Westy with a '83 GTI rabbit motor in it.  I want to
compare the engines.  I still have the original diesel trans installed. I
want to get a air-cooled 4 speed,(thats the way the linkage is set up) but
an concerned that the GTI won't have the power to handle a big Camper with
less RPM's. It losses speed on hills quite quickly.  My old '83 1.9L Westy,
wish I'd never sold it, seemed to have better pulling power.  If anyone can
help, please write me. Thanks.

   Anyone know where I can find a Dark Green Vanagon Westy? Willing to
trade mine for it.  Air or water, no matter.  I think VW made them until
about '84.  Thanks again.  Take care.
