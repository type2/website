Subject:      PNW - Union Camp-out &amp; Beyond

Had a great time with all the other folks at the Union Camp-out.

After talking with a few of the Boise Bus Guys, I decided there was nothing
that required me to return to Washington State,  so I pointed the Syncro
Westy East with trailer and Gas Gas Motorcycle in tow and started a 3 week
&quot;adlib&quot; vacation through Idaho and the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming, Montana
and Alberta, Canada ending in Jasper, Alberta!!!

Thanks to the Boise Guys for the tip.....  With no schedule and no
destination by myself,  it became an almost spiritual experience.   Too many
things to talk about here.  But if you ever get the chance to take your
Camper by yourself or with someone who can handle the spontaneous nature of
such a trip through Yellowstone, Glacier National Park and the Canadian
Rockies with no time limit,  do not pass up the opportunity!!!!

My opologies to anyone on the Vanagon List for not being able to unsubscribe
before my trip thereby ending up with a full mailbox and possibly returned
mail to all on the list...... OOPS!
