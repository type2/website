Subject: 70's middle seat want it?
Date: Fri, 19 May 1995 16:26:11 -0700

 I sold my 1966 deluxe and I still have a middle seat that was in the bus 
when I bought it.  It is kind of ratty but it is comfortable.  Do you 
want it?  It is now sitting on my porch in San Luis Obispo, Ca. 
   (The seat is a short style out of a 70 or 71)

Does anyone have a stock German muffler for a 79 convertable??
E-mail response please.
