Subject: EXTREME DANGER (was: Aluma-Seal Confessions)


After my foolish post, some even more foolish idiot wrote:

&gt;ehhhh... i AM going to tell you what the reaction participants are cause 
you
&gt;all probably have alot of it on hand.
   (snip, damn it)
&gt; Ignite it with a strip of magnesium and you
&gt;have the hottest burning stuff available (2000 deg F, i think), burn holes
&gt;in cement, etc...

I sincerely regret introducing this subject to the thread. It reveals
an effective way to violently kill yourself and everyone around you,
in a terrifying and uncontrollable way, while burning down most nearby
structures. Anyone lucky enough to escape death from a reaction
like this, can be maimed, horribly and painfully, for life.

An equivalent amount of this stuff in front of the Federal Building in
OK City, would have made that bomb look like a popped balloon by
comparison.

Ladies and gents, PLEASE DO NOT EVEN THINK of trying this. Any precautions
you take beforehand, probably won't be enough. I exercised VERY poor
judgement in opening this thread...

PLEASE LET IT DIE. So no one else does.
