Subject: Distributor Clamp Help Wanted

Hi Folks

I'm pretty well fed up with myself in the area of setting my timing;
seems I don't get the distributor clamp nut tightened right, and I'm
looking for help!

On my '60 Bug, when I first got it running, it went great for a few
miles, and then the distributor worked it's way up off the drive pin
just a bit, blowing the timing and confusing me until my local VW guru
set it straight and told me to tighten that nut more next time.

This past weekend, on my '77 Westy, the same damn thing happened about
200 miles after the tune-up I did the prior weekend.  Then I twisted off
the stud trying to tighten the distributor clamp.  Sigh.  Got a new stud
and then the distributor wasn't in a position to be timed correctly.
More fallout from an incompletely tightened nut.  (The Westy's fine now.)

So, how tight do you tighten that nut on the distributor clamp?

	Thanks for any advice

		Jay
