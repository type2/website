Subject: Re: '78 Westy Refrigerator

Have had this camper for 2 years and am finally getting around to the fridge.

Runs off spare battery(no good and haven't replaced yet) or house current --
when it works -- it hasn't since I've owned it.

12 volts is getting to the thermostat and to what I quess is a heating
element(insulated wire=lots of current).  I've reached down in there to see
if anything is getting hot but it doesn't, even after a couple of hours.

Any ideas or should I continue to use it for an icebox?

Thanks.

Bruce Lewis
