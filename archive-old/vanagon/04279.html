This past weekend I spent more time than I should have taken care of
several small items on the 82 westy - changed the oil from 20W50 to 10W30
synthetic, new filter, annular oil pressure relief valve and
installed electric oil cooling fan switch set to come on at 180F and installed
 a dash light to tell me when the fan is working. All this was done in
preparation for what will likely be a very cold winter.

It took about  8 hours in total to complete this work (which was
relatively simple). The real time consumer was replacing the catalytic
convertor. There are six bolts in all holding the cat between the no 3/4
exhaust manifold and the exhaust pipe. The whole set up is very odd on the
CA designated air-cooled Vanagons - because on one side the heat
exchangers are before the cat and on the other after the cat. This  probably
creates some uneven pressure on the exhaust system due to uneven lengths
in the exhuast pipes.

 Anyway replacing four of the six bolts was easy, but two required
extensive grinding and were in
an inaccessible area meaning that I could only do a bit at a time. Once
the bolts were removed the cat fell easily to the ground. A used one seems
heavier, it was certainly blocked (50% of the substrate on one side was
blocked and 70% on the other).  Nevertheless I was able to see dimly
through the piece meaning that its replacement may have been premature.
The substrate itself showed no signs of breaking down but was definitely
plugged. The newer one has less mass but was the correct length (and
price). I take it that they are the same for all for VW's since the guy who
sold it to me had no idea where it came from; it definitely did not have the 
Vanagon-related number on it but was VW. So far it works and idle and power
seem slightly improved (perhaps only in my mind). The real test will be after
driving 2-3 hundred miles at a stretch when cat efficiency will be
tested....

Why did I replace it? The previous owner kept
meticulous records of the van's repair which showed no sign of the cat's
replacement. I assumed that it was at least 60,000 miles old and possibly
160,00 (engine changes). Since I put in a new engine a while ago I figured
now would be a good idea to bring the exhaust system  up-to-date.

If anyone is thinking of doing this, soak overnight with WD40 (the nuts
not you), buy a nut cracker and a grinding stone just in case.

As for running 10w30 and the electric oil fan. The only time it came on
(meaning the oil had reached 180F) was in the city after just turning off
the highway. This was at an ambient temp of 20C. I am not convinced though
that a fan can reduce the temperature quickly enough since the oil is
circulating rather quickly. A cooler with more passes may be necessary. The
great thing is
that the fan continues to run after the engine is shut off -cooling the
engine when it is not running.
