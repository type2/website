&gt;Any advice on rebuilding/replacing Vanagon automatics?  There may be a 
&gt;few in the local boneyards if mine is beyond repair.  What kind of costs 
&gt;can I expect??  Any input welcome.  Thanks.

If only the auto matic section is bad, most parts can be obtained from local
transmission shop.  Hard parts such as gears, shafts etc are not readily
acialable.  If you are experinced, you can separate the auto section from the
final drive.  Then dissasemble the auto section following the Bentley manual
paying close attenetion to detail.  If run dry, then the pump may need to be
repalced.  Find used trans for parts.  Most parts including pump are the same
for all VW and some Audi transmissions so buying a core from these can be
good source for the hard parts.
