&gt;Recent postings on this subject suggest difficulties are occurring at the
&gt;Vanagon chat site.  I managed to get what I presume is an avatar, it was a
&gt;picture of a Vanagon and I picked a nickname.  Initially when I visited the
&gt;site no-one was ever there.  (I changed my deodorant and had a shower but
&gt;still no-one there!!!!)  Now I can't even get into the chat room (Ozzie go
&gt;home).
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone been successful in chatting at the site?  If so, tell us your
&gt;secret.

Unfortunately the chat system at vanagon_dot_com is currently down.  I'll try
to get it up again today.

Note that you should send inquiries about this chat system directly to me,
unless you're trying to organize a group chat time.

P.S.  'Avatar' is a virtual-reality term for a representation of a
character in
      cyberspace.
