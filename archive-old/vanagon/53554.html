&gt; Did the road trip to Chicago from Philly and wiped out on the ice in
&gt; Indiana on X-Mas Eve. I slowly spun into the guard rail around South
&gt; Bend and whacked both my LF and LR sections of my bumpers.  I hit it
&gt; hard enough to rip off the front bumper and twist it into a pretzel,   
Bummer, but I 'm glad to hear no one was hurt (especially the dog, just
kidding). I guess being broke nown on Xmas Eve is better than what
happened to you. Maybe we should stay home next year.
