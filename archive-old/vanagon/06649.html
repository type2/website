Subject: RE: Pfeiffer facilities


I have the Pfeiffer State Park brochure and the writeup in 
Northern California Camping - I'd be happy to mail copies to
anyone interested. Actually, here is the text from Northern
California Camping:

	There are 217 campsites for tents or motor homes up to 32 feet
	long.  Piped water, picnic tables, and fireplaces are provide.
	Rest rooms, showers, a laudromat, groceries, and propane gas
	are available.  Campgrounds, rest roomes, the grocery store,
	and food services are wheelchar accessible. Pets are permitted.
	Call MISTIX at 800-444-PARK ($6.75 MISTIX fee plus $14-$16 per
	site). Pets are $1 apiece. Park phone 408-667-2315.

	This is one of the most popular state parks in California, and
	it's easy to see why. You have it all: fantastic coastal vistas
	(Highway 1), redwood forests and waterfalls (Julie
	Pfeiffer-Burns State Park), expansive beaches with sea otters
	playing on the edge of kelp beds (Andrew Molera State Beach),
	great restaurants (Nepenthe, Ventana Inn), and private,
	patrolled campsites. Reservations are a necessity. Open
	year-round. Rated 9 of 10.

The borchure could be handy since it includes a map with site numbers
so you can pick-and-choose.

Martha, note that the Group Sites do not look too good - they are
across Highway 1 opposite the regular campground.
