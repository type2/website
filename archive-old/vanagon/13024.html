Subject: Gas Milage, CV Bolt extraction, Vanagon Models

	My '71 914, 1.7l type IV with FI, consistantly got
25 mpg AT BEST. From the 30+ of the Rabbit and Golf, I thougth
the FI was misadjusted or there was a leak somewhere! Not so,
sadly. The aircooled engine's high milage reputation was built when
Detroit iron got between 8 and 16 mpg. And gas cost $0.25/gallon.
The 14-18 range Sami and others observe sounds believeable.


	Ben Jaffe,
	Bummer on that broken screw, bro! An easy-out and a good
drill (cobalt or other exotic/hard/sharp stuff) should cost less
than the $30 'stud extractor' and ought to give years of pleasure...
Remember to use oil or cutting fluid when drilling the old bolt out.
Never drill metal without coolant/lubricant.

	It's always seemed a shame to me to drill out the stuck screw
with a conventional drill, one that twists the same direction as
the screw, thus tightening it as one drills. Has anyone ever seen
LEFT-HANDED drills that would have the beneficial effect of trying
to back the stub out as one drilled it? 


	Revell's 1:25 Vanagon model is being re-issued, in Europe
anyway, in Yugoslavian civil war markings (I'm not making this up)
all white with a blue &quot;UN&quot; decal- just like you see on TV. Charlie
at APC Hobbies in Earlysville, VA listed them in one of his recent
catalogs. Bad news, $24.00 for the european import.

P.O. Box 122 Earlysville, VA 22936. They're really nice people, they
managed to find one of those early-60s cut-away submarine models for me
(not the one you can still get, which isn't as good and wasn't what
my dad built for me in 1962)
