Subject: 87: replacing plugs
Date: Mon, 20 May 1996 08:44:08 -0700

The recommended service interval for plugs, dist cap, etc is 30K miles. 
I've never owned a vehicle where the plugs would last this long. What's the 
list's consensus on changing these parts? Can they really go 30K or should 
they be changed at 15K?
