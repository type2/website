Subject: carbon canister

The carbon canister *looks* like a pretty unimportant appendage in the
engine compartment and I sure haven't touched it since I've owned the bus
(4 1/2 years &amp; 45,000 miles). 

Perhaps this should change. What have others done about it? Should the
canister be replaced, or just its contents?
