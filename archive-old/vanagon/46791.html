Subject: Re: refridge flame blowout 


&gt;The 12 V feature does draw quite a bit of current, but if your altenator and
&gt;battery are in good shape you should be OK unless you leave the fridge on
&gt;when the engine is off.

This is incorrect.  The system is designed to only deliver current while
the engine is running, ie. drawing current from the alternator.  Unless you
modify the circutry to defeat this feature, the refridgerator will NOT run
in the 12V mode while the engine is off.  Obviously this is to protect the
battery from being drained.  Don't beleive me?  Look in both Bently and the
owner's manual.

I've NEVER had the flame in my fridge blow out on any of my Vanagons while
I was driving and I would definately dispute the notion that the system is
not designed to be used while driving.  There are troubleshooting
procedures that I've seen on this list that pertain to fixing problems that
will cause blow out while driving.


&gt;If you are going to use the 12V a lot, you should
&gt;get the 2 battery set up with a battery isolator and run the fridge off the
&gt;non-ignition battery.
