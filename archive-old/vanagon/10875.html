                    MODEL and YEAR
  ______________________________________________

OK, since a picture is worth a thousand words, how about some good theories on 
the distribution of models by year and design.  For example, if we make a lot of
assumptions, can we conclude that the early vanagons were not popular with the 
old bus enthusiasts since there seem to be very few represented in our sample?  
Is is possible that the dirth of '83 vanagons is due to the problems with the 
first of the wasserboxers?  Are there model years to avoid buying based on our 
survivorship curve?  Is the paucity of 1988+ vans on the list due to price or a 
drop in popularity?  Hope I stir things up a bit ;}
