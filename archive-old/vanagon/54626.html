Subject: Need Immediate Help~Show dates!

I need the dates of the SanJose California Kelly Park Show that is usually
held on either the first or second weekend of April. Due to office politics
I need to have the &quot;vacation days&quot; aproved prior to noon Arizona time on
Monday, Jan 20th, 1997. Several calls to the folks who should know have not
helped as of yet. I guess the holiday and or business travel have taken the
appropriate players out of my reach. 
Please help as I need the &quot;vacay&quot; days for travel to and from Phoenix to the
show and back. Thanks!
