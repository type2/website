&gt; My advice to anyone with an older bus is to check the hinge *before* it
&gt; breaks, because it will be much easier to fix if it isn't already broken.
&gt; I am still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it looks like
&gt; drilling it out and running a bolt through the hinge is my best option,
&gt; without actually removing the entire hinge.

Any advice on the above procedure is most welcome.  I am about to need
the same on my '71.  I am thinking of using a stainless nut and bolt 
at least.
