Subject: CCC's - I'll be there, make it if you can...

For all those camping crazies out there, me and a few of my friends (or 
for those English language buffs amongst us, a few friends of mine and I) 
will be camping out at Leo Carillo State Beach next Friday. For those of 
us who live by their dayplanner, that is March 22nd. I just made my 
reservations today and from the sound of it, there is a high probability 
that there are quite a few campsites still available. If any of you guys 
can make it it would be great to see some happy pyromaniaical faces for 
some good old campfire fun...
