Tim,
The spice rack is used in the 65-67 Westies. I errantly mentioned the later
models only because the laminate was similar up to a certain year. The
sliding door is not in the buses that I need. The spice rack is a solid
mounted unit that attaches to the rear most door of the two swing hinged
cargo doors. The two swing hinged doors were replaced by the sliding door.
The unit that I am looking for is roughly shaped like a reversed &quot;L&quot; ( _| ).
It has three or four small shelves that would be perfect to store little
cans of veggies or soup etc. It has an enclosed storage box on top with a
narrow laminate top that is hinged slightly off center. The little side
cabinet with the flip-up table top that used to be bolted to the rear facing
seat by the sliding 
door is on the drivers side (I think). The unit that you mentioned (in the
last sentence is not in the 65-67 Westies. I will try to draw a ASCII sketch
for you. Thanks anyway!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just for the fun of it ask if he has a spicerack/L shaped whatnot cabinet
&gt;&gt;for a 65-71 westy camper. It has gotten to be my standing joke but I still
&gt;Ok, will do. Is this spice rack the little side cabinet with the flip-up 
&gt;table top that used to be bolted to the rear facing seat by the sliding 
&gt;door.? Good for making sandwiches while standing outside. I have one with 
&gt;table, one without if so. I'm fond of them, very convenient units to mount 
&gt;anywhwere.  tim s.
