I've seen this stuff called driveway cleaner at the hardware store. It
works pretty well. You pour it on the stain, scrub it a bit with a brush,
and after letting it sit a spell, you hose it off.

Probably not the most PC way of dealing with the problem, but it can't be
any worse than what runs off the streets anyway.
