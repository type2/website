Hi Charles and all:
I have not had any experience with Redline grease, but I have put Amsoil
in the CVs of my off-road race car. After a 400 mile race I checked the
CVs and there was no grease to speak of. I was very disappointed with it
. I guess it gets thinner than regular molly grease during use (heat)
and gets slung out. I don't have that problem with Swepco grease. I just
got a couple of tubes of Prolong grease and was thinking of mixing it
with Swepco and see what happens. Off road racers sometimes use a high
molly grease like Swepco and add some Bel-Ray engine assembly lube that
is very high in molly. I just may add just a little STP to make
everything just a little more fluid and stickier.  Todd Francis
