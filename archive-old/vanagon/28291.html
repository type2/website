&gt; he could hear voices, seemingly a chorus. There was John Lennon,
&gt; Jim Croche, Janice Joplin, James Brown, Elvis, Ricky Nelson
&gt; and Jackie Wilson.
&gt;
        Uhh, ever since I saw this post (and deleted it too fast) I've been
thinking there were some important omissions. This is, after all, an VW bus
list, so the ultimate (deceased) band should of course include the
following:

Jerry Garcia
Brent Mydland
Keith Godcheaux
Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan

        Addmittedly heavy on keyboards, but pigpen was better known for his
blues-raps anyway, and since Godcheaux refused the electronics, he and
Brent could co-exist (kinda like Bruce &amp; Vince did).

        Thinkin' 'bout dancin' to/in &quot;The Promised Land&quot;... (anybody else
see the Rosanne last week dedicated to Jerry?)

Peace,
