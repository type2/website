Subject: Re: general question on timing

Sami,

I managed to 'burn-before-reading' on the last message you sent me -- a
little too wild with the delete key.  I think it would have been about
batteries (?).

On the timing, the total advance is relative to peak torque, which with the
stock cam occurs between 2,000 and 3,000 rpm, the variables being air density
and the exact timing of valves, timing and points.  Below that speed, the
amount of advance reflects the 'advance curve' built in to your distributor
(but multiplied by 2, since the distributor turns at one-half engine speed)
and will typically be somewhere between the static amount and the total
amount.  Above that speed you will always see the total amount... and if you
put on your thinking cap at this point you will come to understand why too
much total advance can be destructive. 

And yes, backing off total advance typically drops cylinder head temps and
oil temps, giving up peak torque to do so.  As you'll see, finding the 'sweet
spot' -- the trade-off between efficiency, performance and durabilty -- can
be something of a challenge since there's no longer any such thing as a
'stock' engine.  But once you find the sweet spot your engine becomes less of
a worry and more of a friend.  With hydraulic cam followers I can typically
carry about 32 degrees total advance.  I generally run with about 30. The
static timing point to achieve this varies from engine to engine but is
usually between 6 and 8 degrees. 

Just to add to your Sunday funnys, some degree wheels often contain 'typos',
having their marks off by as much as 3 degrees.  The quick check for this is
to use machinests tools and verify that TDC is precisely 90 degrees from the
center of the keyway.  If/When you buy a new degree wheel, and if the numbers
are simply painted on the aluminum, before installing the wheel do this:
 Wash your new degree wheel gently in warm soapy water.  Try not to touch the
face after washing.  Pour a little vinegar into a glass baking dish and sit
the new pulley into it, printed side down.  Leave it over night.  Wash with
warm water.  Install.  The acidic vinegar will etch the aluminum... except
where it is protected by the printed numbers &amp; marks.  In the years to come,
the printing will become scratched or otherwise obscured but the etching will
have made the marks permanent.

Your distributor is apparently working.  I would not replace it unless I was
sure it needed it.  You can visually/manually examine it for wear and rebuild
it if the shims are worn, and you can examine it dynamically by clipping the
trigger-lead of your strobe light to the different spark plugs as you examine
the firing point for 'jitter'.  This works best if you have a degree wheel
fitted but in cases of extreme wear the problem is obvious even with the
stock pulley -- the firing point will appear to jump back and forth around
the static timing point.  The jumpiness indicates wear in the distributor or
its power train.  But don't read-in a problem that isn't there -- the typical
inductive-triggered timing light introduces its own 'jitter', apparently as
an artifact of its circuitry.  Fortunately it isn't very much but if your
experience is limited to one or two engines you may see -- or hear -- the
Devil when he isn't there :-)

PS -- Since this subject comes up rather often I'm going to make this a
general post.
