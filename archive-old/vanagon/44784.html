&gt;You can avoid this, of course, by making sure the distributor rotor is
&gt;pointing at the #1 cap post when the marks come to the crack. On most
&gt;upright engines I've seen, it points at #1 when it's pointing at the
&gt;front passenger's seat.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHoops--- pay no attention to that American behind the curtain!
The distributor rotor usually points at #1 position, when it points at
the RIGHT FRONT seat. The driver's seat, if you're part of the Empire
On Which The Sun Never Sets. Passenger seat only for residents of
other continents.   :-\
