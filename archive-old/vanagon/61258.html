Subject: Re: Westy roof rack question

A friend has had these on his '80 Westy for 5 or 6 years with no bad
results.   He usually carries up to 100 lbs.   Uses the Yakima adapters.
He usually takes the load off before opening the roof, but I would think
anything light would be fine.

&gt;able to open the top with them still attached. Comments, anyone?
