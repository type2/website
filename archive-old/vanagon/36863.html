Subject: Derek's Syncro alignment specs

Back when the list was just starting, Derek Drew posted modified
specifications required for proper alignment of the Syncro.

Last night I tried to find it in the archives, but the archives
don't have the information from the early days of the list.

If anyone has this info, would they please forward it to me. 
(Haven't heard from Derek for a while so I don't know if he still 
monitoring the list.)

TIA
