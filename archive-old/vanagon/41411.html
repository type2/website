Subject: Bently book

&gt;Hi fellow Bussers! Any of you guys have an old beat up copy of the
&gt;Vanagon Bently book you wanna get rid of? I'm wanting to learn the
&gt;secrets my 89 has and I can't afford $70-$80 for a new copy!  Anyone
&gt;got a copy cheaper?!!??!?!?!?!  I can go up to maybe $25 or so.
&gt;Buslady &amp; the pretty shiny Vanagon :D
&gt;

DITTO, FOR AN '87 (SYNCRO)
