Subject: Re: Needed - EV Oil Filters

&gt; 
&gt; I could get these for $8.75 each (OEM, Volkswagen brand, part #074115561), 
&gt; if purchasing a few at a time.  (Frankly I have no idea if this is a good 
&gt; deal or not.  Maybe you can tell me.)

Ouch! What's the difference with the EV filters? I though the Audi 5 
cyl used the same old VW filter used since the early 70s. Is it like 
the Corrado filter with a big nut on the end, or what?

Around here, the dealer is $6.50 for a standard gas VW filter, $7.50 
for the diesel, haven't checked on the EV though. $8.75 = abput $12 
CDN though...
