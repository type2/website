&gt;&gt;I saw a new camping product recently that looks intriguing.  It is
&gt;&gt;basically a &gt;&gt;folding tent that fastens to roof racks on the top of a car
&gt;&gt;(or Vanagon!).
&gt;&gt;It consists of a pair of platforms that are hinged together and a tent in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;between.  Then traveling (or in storage) the platforms are folded
&gt;&gt;together and &gt;&gt;the tent is collapsed between them.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It measures 48&quot; x 60&quot; x estimated 10&quot; thick in this state.  When you want to
set
&gt;&gt;up for the nite and use the tent, you remove the travel cover and swing the
&gt;&gt;top platform up and over with its attached ladder.  The ladder extends down
&gt;&gt;to meet the ground and hold up the platform .

This sure sounds like a Dove Camper...
