Howdy folks, as of yesterday's mail, I have received the following
orders:

Martha Rubin     1 xl
Sami Dakhlia     1 l
Laurie Bauer     2 l
David Kirk       1 l
Meghan Radtke (&amp; husband) 1 l, 1 m
Dean Aukes       1 xl
Gregor Durstewitz2 xl
Don Geiger       1 xl
Gary Clayton     1 xl
Richard Kurtz    5 xl !!!!!

If your name is here, and everything is correct, then great. (If
incorrect, tell me please)
IF your name is not here, and you sent a check, relax, the mail system
is pretty slow. I am taking in the artwork tomorrow, and will place the
actual order next week. I want to wait and give everyone a chance, but I
also don't want to hold on for too long. 
SO, if you do plan to get an order in, 
DO IT NOW!!!
Send a check for $15.00 ($20.00 non-USA residents) to:
Richard Palmer
3010 Spanish Ct. 
# 16
Raleigh, NC
27607-4166
Send the check, and an index card with your name, address, email
address,
and SIZE OF SHIRT.
I will place the order AT THE LATEST next Friday, August 18.
Thank you ,
and have a nice day.
:)
