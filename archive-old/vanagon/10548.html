AS OF FRIDAY I BECAME THE NEW OWNER (3RD) OF A ORANGE 1981 VW WESTY. I CAN
RELATE TO THE WANNABUS FEELING.  JIM THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP, AND NO I HAVE
 NOT GOTTEN MY HANDS DIRTY YET.  TRYING TO BALANCE SCHOOL FIRST, AND THIS NEW
COMPUTER IS GIVING ME A HARD TIME.  I GUESS IT IS LIKE MOST THINGS, SPEND
ENOUGH TIME FIDDELING WITH IT AND YOU'LL GET IT FIGURED OUT. THE TRICK IS NOT
TO BE AFRAID. I GUESS THAT WOULD BE KEY IN A LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN LIFE.  THE
STORY ABOUT THE AROUND THE WORLD TRIP WAS GREAT, BUT I THINK THAT MY FIRST BIG
TRIP IS GOING TO BE THE TOUR DEPONT. A WEEK IN THE BUS WATCHING BIKES SHOULD DO
MY SOUL SOME GOOD. THE OFFER STILL STANDS, HOPE YOU CAN SWING IT.  THE BUS HAS
AN ELECTRIC REFRIDGE SO THE BEER WILL STAY COLD.  NEED TO GO SO I'LL TALK WITH
YOU LATER.  VEE DUB BRO.     GREG
