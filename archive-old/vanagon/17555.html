Subject:       FYI on Porta Potti's

HI Everyone.  Not really VW related, but relevant to the camping 
crowd.  After 5 years, my wife and I decided it was time to get a 
porta potti for when we access remote areas that have gross pit 
toilets, or nothing at all.

Thanks to Tobin for recommending the Thetford models.  The 235 is now 
discontinued and is replaced with the 335.  This is a very small 
unit.  It is 12&quot; X 14&quot;, and 12&quot; high.  It fits like a glove between 
the two front seats just behind the parking brake in a Vanagon Westy. 
We made a webbing belt with a snap buckle to secure it in place and 
this goes through the seatbelt anchors.  My wife also made a nylon 
cover to go over the unit as well.  

What impressed me the most, is that the unit doesn't take any usuable 
space from us, as we don't put anything behind the parking brake 
anyway.  

Now with somewhere to go....

Harry.
