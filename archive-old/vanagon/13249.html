Subject: Re: Syncro Westie With the Front CV (Black and) Blues

Jon, 

If your CV is bad up front this is a bear of a job to fix yourself. It can
also get quite expensive. 56K sounds a little low for your problem. 

But the good news is that this is covered under warranty so you have nothing
to worry about for now. Just make sure the boot is still good or they will
not cover any of it.

Derek


&gt;I'd like to get some input on the front CVs, i.e. How long have your front CVs 
&gt;lasted?  How much did it cost in US$ for each CV?  How much was the overall 
&gt;repair is US$?  Is changing front CVs on a Syncro as rudimentary as the early 
&gt;'70s type I (rear) CVs?  Any other thoughts or comments?  We currently have 
&gt;just over 56K miles on our '90 Syncro Westie and the CVs went south last 
&gt;weekend....  They're driving me nuts with the constant clunk, clunk, clunk 
&gt;sound, but I'd like to get some feedback from those of you with Syncros before 
&gt;I go to get it repaired at the dealer.  Thanks in advance for you advice...
&gt;
