&gt;i knew i was taking a bit of a gamble on who was the originator of the idea
&gt;on rhubarb leaves. Re. all that blood, gore nausea etc. on using rhubarb
&gt;leaves, couldn't you just wear a pair of rubber gloves, what do you do andy
&gt;e.?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond'
&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;suggest using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly
&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;toxic (it is for this reason that you don't compost them)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     hey wasn't me guv,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     I just use autosol and leave the rhubarb for rhubarb crumble and
&gt;&gt;     custard :)

Oh for the love of Mars, folks.  Rhubarb isn't *that* toxic--the greens do
contain a very high amount of oxalic acid, which interferes greatly with the
body's ability to absorb nutrients.  If you eat it it'll probably make you
sick, but I don't think you'll be laid out in a pine box by merely touching
the leaves.  I never have been, at least I don't think so.  :)
