&lt;tale of woe deleted&gt;

I wonder if there were this many problems with the early ('49-'67)
busses when they were new.

I'd heard of some of the problems, but I bet it was far fewer overall,
given the relative simplicty.

One of the problems I'd read about was the jack points collapsing if
it was jacked up under a load, so they moved the ack points.

Another had to do with engine longevity, resulting in changes to the 
material used in the cranks and pistons...
