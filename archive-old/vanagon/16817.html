Subject: Re: sway bar?


&gt;I was looking through some automotive catolog yesterday, and I saw a
&gt;anti-sway bar or something for old volkswagens with the swing axle rear
&gt;suspension.  Does anybody know anything about it?  Are they worth it?
&gt;(price-$60-70)  Are the swing axles that bad, especially at higher speeds?
&gt;Oh, and I am still planning on towing that 58 double cab home, but I
&gt;thought I should probably have the bearings regreased.  Does anyone know
&gt;how much this should cost to be done?  And one final question, how much
&gt;would a new wiring harness cost?  Could I go with a used one at all?
&gt;Thanks

The &quot;sway bar&quot; that you mention is actually called a &quot;Camber Compensator&quot;. EMPI
used to make it, and now CB Performance sells their version. It basically
prevents the inside rear wheel of a swingaxle rear from &quot;tucking in&quot; during hard
cornering. That tuck-in is really noticeable on freeway ramps, etc. I have one
on my Notchback, and it works well. I don't think it will fit on the old Busses
(Reduction gears and such), but if you call CB Performance at (800) 274-8337,
I'm sure they will let you know.
