&gt;According to my dealer, the '96 Eurovans will arrive with the '96 model
&gt;year, WITHOUT a six cylinder model.  The five cylinder will remain the only
&gt;engine choice for about six months, when the VR6 is expected to be
&gt;available.  The van is essentially identical to the previous years' Eurovans.

I am almost sure your dealer is talking about the Winnebago Eurovan Camper
for the 96 model (which has a 5 cylinder engine). In fact this is the only
model available in US this year.

It is not clear what camper models VW is planning to bring out with the VR6
engines. I sure hope they bring at least a &quot;Weekender Westfalia&quot;. I test
drove the 95 Winnebago Eurovan Camper and did not like it.
