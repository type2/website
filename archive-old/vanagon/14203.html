Subject:       rhubarb death

isn't this one of the levels of 'Doom' ? :)

anyway, don't worry about rhubarb on the skin.  the mode of toxicity 
is such that the oxalic crystals are quite large (well, not HUGE) and 
insoluble-- they imbed in the soft tissues of the mouth and digestive 
track causing extreme irritation leading to swelling/bleeding and 
closing off airways and other soft-tissue degeneration.  same thing 
with philodendrons i believe.

the leaves ARE quite tough and scratchy and i can see where they
would made a good scouring pad for metal.
