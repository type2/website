Subject: Trans swap in 83 Westy:tips?

I'm going to swap the bad, wicked, and noisey 4-speed tranny in my 83
Westfalia for rebuilt unit (also a 4-speed from an 83). I have the Bentley
book as a guide. If anyone has  experience with this removal and installation
and has some tips to offer I would be much obliged. I don't have the engine
support chain tool shown in the Bentley manual, but I assume I can get around
that with a second floor jack(?). Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks
Jeff
83 Westy
