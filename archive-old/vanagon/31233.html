      &gt; Ahnendorp, incidently, said that his exhaust would not work on a
      &gt; syncro which makes me feel (a) sad, and (b) glad that he knows
      &gt;syncros.

&gt;From the looks of the pictures in this VW Motoring article, I doubt whether
this dual B.A.S. exhaust has provisions for two catylitic convertors either.

If it does, I won't mind having this exhaust on my '88 Westy.
