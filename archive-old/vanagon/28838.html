Subject: thanksgiving/CA/anyone?


While on this last campout, one of our list members asked about the possibility
of our group doing something for Thanksgiving.  I assume most of you will have
familial obligations, but if they don't extend beyond your immediate family,
and the idea of bringing your family to spend it with other VW-bus volkx and their
families appeals to you, let me know.  We could camp, or I'd even be willing
to volunteer my house for this.  Lemme know if there's an interest!......
