This looks like yet another nice van that won't be available in the US.  

I could imagine that they might come to America throgh mexican or brasilian 
production one day.

Very reminiscent of the Eurovan in appearance.  Have any of the listmembers in 
Europe been able to drive one of these?

All those compact Vans feel a bit like a long and high Golf. The new Eurovan 
(Transporter, Caravelle and Californias ) with TDI are more powerful than the 
Mercedes Diesels. Funny thing is that VW sells their VR6 gas engine to 
Mercedes because none of the regular Mercedes six-cylinders fits into the 
little Van's motor compartment. So you can get it VW powered as well !

Compared to a Vanagon syncro they lack of traction - which is clear. Compared 
to a 2WD T3 they are not as unique and lack of character, so I think there is 
surely something similar available in the US. Probably it's not very different 
to a Chrysler Voyager.

The big Van on &lt;Vanagon_dot_com&gt;  the &quot;Sprinter 4x4&quot; feels a little more like a 
truck. Very good in Off-Road conditions but not as comfortable and smooth on 
the road like a T3 Vanagon.

Interesting are marketing concepts of the Vans. VW shows their Californias 
together with families and children. In the Mercedes &quot;Marco Polo&quot; broshures 
you just see trendy sports stuff like paragliding, mountain-biking, 
free-climbing equipment in the van.
