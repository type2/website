I left Mabel unattended over the Christmas break, and she had her gas cap 
stolen.  So I went to my FLAPS and asked my pal behind the counter for 
one.  He told me I could have one for just about any other year, but that 
he didn't have a listing for one for a '71.  He called all over town for 
me and found out that no one had a listing for a '71 gas cap...So I went 
to the dealer and asked about it.  He said that he could probably order 
me one--but he didn't really know where to find it.  I told him that was 
okay, I could wait for a while...Then he broke me the news that it would 
be a 45 dollar part.   AAARRGH!!  So I told him never mind....hoping I 
could find one somewhere else.  All the junkyards are clean of gas caps, 
of course....Anyone got any ideas?
