Well as far as leaded fuel being not available anymore is not a scare,  the
metals used in the valves and other parts that once needed lead as a
supplemental lubricant dates back to the early 60's and perhaps even later
than that.  so no need to get all of those lead substitutes and such.  As
for as Bosch not recommending the platinum plugs for older vehicles,  i was
told that at a trade show by one of their reps.  the advice is not that the
plugs will damage anything because they most assuredly won'y, however, not
as much difference is noticed in older vehicles,  I guess it was their
disclaimer so that a knuclehead with a '72 buick that smokes big billowing
smoke out of the exhaust buys platinums and wants a refund cuz they din't
fix his car,  that is all.

different genre

&gt;&gt; &gt; engine was designed to run on regular leaded fuel, then do not use platinum
&gt;&gt; &gt; plugs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; DOH.  I have those in my bus right now.  It's running so well I don't
&gt;&gt; think I would dare remove them.  I was planning on leaving them in till
&gt;&gt; the engine falls apart.

&gt;..well, i've had platinums in my 73\1800 bus for over a year now with good
&gt;success. of course, i'm not running leaded fuel in it, noone sells that
&gt;anymore. should i be worried ??? i never heard that bit about BOSCH
&gt;recommending not to use platinums in breadloafs...that a fact ???
&gt;    curious,
