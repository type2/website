&gt; Thanks for the ideas. We have a store chain here called &quot;SportsRack&quot; and

&gt; Does anyone know if there is one made in Germany? Sort of the same idea

&gt;  
&gt; I wonder how many folks would be interested in such a cargo carrier? Does 
&gt; anyone know if all the models of Westfalias have the same size cargo area?

&gt; Thanks again all - Jack

An option you might consider is one of the large, vinyl coated, &quot;dry 
bags&quot;, commonly used by river rafters.  They typically load from one end, 
which is then folded over to seal the contents.  They come in lots of 
sizes, including full top carrier size and conform to the load.  Pretty 
streamlined if properly loaded.  Hold down with bungie cords.  I have 
several - in different sizes - that I've been using for several years.  
Work great, no leaks, and they fold up for fairly compact storage when 
not in use.  You can find them out whitewater kayak/rafting stores and 
most backpacking/outdoor/sports shops.  REI carries them in their 
catalog.
