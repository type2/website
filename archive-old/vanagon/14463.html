&gt; I have a '77 that I am trying to put sway bars.  I ordered Sway-A-Way bars
&gt; from The Bus Stop (Rocky Mountain Motorwerks).  In addition, I ordered the
&gt; optional stainless steel clamp set.  I am having trouble with the clamps.
&gt; The bars bolt on fine, but the clamps seem too small to go all the way
&gt; around the suspension arm and sway bar.  Has anyone else had a problem like
&gt; this.  I am probably just going to buy a new set of stock clamps becase they
&gt; will work.  Are the clamps only for pre-'67 busses or something?

Sorry, I don't have the answer to the clamp question, but I wanted to
implore you to *please* post your opinion of the sway bars once you get
them installed!!  My bus leans like a motorcycle going around turns...
