&gt; Now THAT's the behavior of a bad temp coolant sensor! and if you drive off,
&gt; it will stall/die at stop signs and red lights.  that's just about exactly     t
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hurt) and the Van now has gone into it's idle hunt mode twice on Saturday,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and twice today (Monday).  It seems to be running better (when it runs
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right).

I concur with this, I had the same &quot;stalling-when-cold&quot; symptoms with my '91 and
I believe it was the temp coolant sensor they replaced but I'll have to check the
invoice to be sure.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yea, BIG bucks here.  Doesn't the dealer have the diagnostic equipment to
&gt; &gt;determine if the ECU is bad or not?
&gt; &gt;

So far, it looks like all the fixes for the bucking and intermittent idle have
been fixed by replacing the ECU.


&gt; &gt;If the dealer suggested to me a complete harness replacement I'd think
&gt; &gt;it very unprofessional and would interpret it as their way of telling
&gt; &gt;me they can't fix it.
&gt; &gt;

I agree.  $60.00 an hour to replace parts.  Hell, my mom can do that!
