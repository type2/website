&gt; 
&gt; is the fuel gauge still acting odd??  if so, double check that pin #14 on
&gt; the big connector to the printed circuit foil in the dash pod.
&gt; 
&gt; if the other instruments seem to be ok, and still the light flashes, i'm
&gt; lost. :(
For those experiencing the coolant light flashing problem. I had the
same problem that many of you described. Since my coolant level was find
and the temp guage was showing normal I drove the wb for several weeks.
As the coolant level went down I topped up with plain water twice and
the coolant indicator went back to normal. This leads me to the conclusion
that the antifreeze/water ratio does funny things to the sensor.
I believe those of you using the new Sierra or Havoline phosphate free
antifreeze may experience the same problem. Comments from anyone ?
