Subject: A/C Compressor Rebuild?

My A/C compressor on my 85 Westy (water cooled) is starting to sound pretty
bad.  (Yes, I test it periodically during the winter months).  When I had the
system checked last fall, the mechanic told me the compressor was dying.  I
just did a rebuild on the engine so I am mechanically inclined.  What is
involved in rebuilding the A/C compressor?  I curious as to how it compares
to an engine rebuild, costs involved, etc...
