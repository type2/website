MY van stalls too! I am sure you have read all my complaints. The 83 van is
great and has never had a problem. The 91 van (both are FI) is a piecwbut never started hesitating until the fuel injection recall done at the dealer.I would like to hear more about your problem.

Thanks.
Let me know, Sergio
