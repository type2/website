Did you only remove the trans to change the clutch??  If so, could you
give a brief overview of the process?

Thanks

       Syncro Transmission Removing:                 Part 1 of 3

     Well first off, I have to say, I have been driving around all 
     summer without the drive shaft, skip plate, or protective bars 
     for the driveshaft. So step 1 is/was to remove all that. Next 
     I drained the gear oil. This was a (possible) check to see if 
     I did any damage to the transmission. Then I removed the
     shifter, and axles, Took off the reverse light wires and clutch
     slave cylinder. Next I went up top and removed the crossover tube 
     and associated stuff. REmoved top engine mounting bolts. Put jack
     under engine, removed front transmission mounts, and lowered the 
     front enough to access the starter and trans. vent tube. 
     Removed the lower 2 mounting bolts and crash the thing was 
     laying on the ground. Dirt, rust, and blood all over the place. 
     As when it hit the ground my fingers were there to coushin it.

  
     Part 1 - removal
     Part 2 - Fix and Clean up
     Part 3 - Installation
