&gt;fair guess at the steady state load would be around 150 amps at 12 volts.  
&gt;
&gt;People, I don't think this is gonna work .  If you started with a good deep
&gt;discharge cycle marine battery, maybe 5 minutes before you sucked the battery
&gt;inside out?  

A 75 Ah battery should then last 30 minutes, right? Although the voltage
drop would disrupt the inverter long before that.
