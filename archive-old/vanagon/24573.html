This PA dealer is a place to stay away for us Pennsylvanians...  Could
you tell us which dealer it was?  By any chance, could it be the onw
in State College, PA?

Thanks,

 &gt; Second engine lasted until a round trip from W. to E. coast.  Suffered at
 &gt; the hands of an ignorant PA shop, which didn't know how to pop left valve
 &gt; cover hidden behind cat. converter.  Cover popped on I-80 in Wyoming,
 &gt; overheating and  contributing to eventual engine replacement.  Engines 3 -
 &gt; 5 were from VW dealer, who blamed 2 more engine failures on fuel injection,
 &gt; transmission (automatic), and I forget what else.  Finally, I think they
 &gt; found a plugged cat. converter, probably caused by PA shop hammer, before
 &gt; replacing engine #5, which failed soon after 1 yr. warranty expired.  I
 &gt; took 81 to trusted Porsche mechanic for engine #6.  He installed oil &amp; head
 &gt; temp guages and aux. oil cooler, which confirmed engine temp. within range.
 &gt; At 500 mi. he yanked the engine and sent it back with an oil leak at
 &gt; head/block.  Engine #7 suffered fractured crank before 500 mi.  My baby is
 &gt; near complete with engine #8.  What would you do?  I'm tempted to trade it
 &gt; for a (curse me) Plymouth Voyager to match all the neighbors.  Except, at a
 &gt; kit car show this weekend, I saw a Mazda conversion engine w. adaptor to VW
 &gt; tranny by Kennedy Eng.in So.Cal.  I also have 88 RX7 which runs like the
 &gt; old 72 bus.  Could live with a hybrid.  So, whadya think?
