&gt;Vanagon heater boxes seem completely incompatable.  In other words,
&gt;the Vanagon heater boxes won't fit the bus, and the bus heater

&gt;the bus?

Unfortunately , the solution is to use the '76 heads.  Other than that,
everything should work fine.  My '73 bus engine is a hybrid - '72 case, '73
fan housing, '74 heads (two right heads!), '81 engine internals (pistons,
liners, hydraulic lifters, cam, pushrods).  A true mutt, and I luv it.  :)

Oh, I suppose you could use the '81 exhaust on the '76, but that might not
be an option for you.
