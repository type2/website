Subject: Re: vwus 800 number for a/c kits

About the Vanagon A/C kits:

Perhaps someone should volunteer to make a recording of those people who
privately e-mail them that they have sent a letter or made a phone call to
VW. Then, we could look next week and see how many letters have actually gone
out, sort of like those red thermometers you see supporting United Way fund
raising drives.

You would see something like: 

&quot;So far we have 28 letters sent and 14 people who have made phone calls&quot;
