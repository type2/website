	I don't get to post very many FS's, but here is one just like my van....

87 Syncro Westy Camper (Not a GL... no stove or sink)
110k miles
1 owner
Dealer serviced
Excellent condition
Metalic Beige/ Beige interior
$8000.               (216) 721-9443    (Cleveland)

	I spoke to the lady on the phone. She says it hasn't had any major
problems, but didn't mention anything that might have been covered under
warranty. Says it probably needs new tires and a new skylight lens. Also a
little seam rust. I havn't seen this van but might be willing if I had an
excuse. It's a spitting image of my van, except it's Beige. Usual
disclaimers.
