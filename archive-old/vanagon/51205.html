&gt; 
&gt; woops! wrong speech. :)  anyway, i replaced my old headlights tonight with
&gt; some Hella Vision Plus halogen lights. BIG improvement. H4 halogen bulb
&gt; (you can replace the bulb without having to replace the glass lense).
&gt; $37.50 each from Imparts in St. Louis.
&gt; 
&gt; low beam is better, more light farther out, and to the sides. there is a
&gt; definite &quot;cut-off&quot; of light above the level of the headlights themselves,
&gt; that is, above four feet off the ground, there is noticeably less light.
&gt; so as to NOT blind the on-coming traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; on high beam, however, it's a different story. :) i almost (almost, i said!)
&gt; don't need to turn on my space-shuttle landing lights. :)  high beams are
&gt; a BIG improvement over my old lights.
&gt; 
&gt; i'll let you know how i feel about them in a few more weeks, but my initial
&gt; impression is that they ARE worth the money. by the by, they are only for
&gt; the 7&quot; round headlights of the 1968-1985 buses (don't know if they'll fit
&gt; the 1952-1967 buses, but i know they won't fit the 86-91 vanagons' square
&gt; lights).
&gt; 
&gt; one slight possible drawback: the front of the glass is FLAT. and this
&gt; kinda makes the bus look cross-eyed, when viewed from the front. go figure.
&gt; so now it's Gus-Gus the Cross-Town Cross-Eyed Bus. :)

      Check the laws in your state! H4 bulbs where to bright in
      most state to be legal, until the mid 1980's!
