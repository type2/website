Subject: Help deciphering German

Ok, just got back from the Bus with tons of numbers taken from plaques 
behind the passenger seat and on the right side of the air ducts.

This is supposedly a 1966 MicroBus, from the bill of sale when I bought it.

Behind the passenger seat on a plaque srewed in:

430 025 114
UT 2212 434483 6163526

Under it on a silver sticker:

Tizianrot L 555
Beigegrau L 472

Riveted to the right side of the air duct and reads Made in Germany:

Typ 22
Fahrgest-Nr. 226163526

Can someone help me decipher all of this german and numbering?
