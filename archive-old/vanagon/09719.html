So Dave Kautz says:

&gt; &gt; Did everyones grandmother have these?  ;)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you all for helping to turn my luxo-van into an old persons
&gt; &gt; home.  ;)

&gt;   I'm with you on this one, Steve. I saw a breadloaf that has been recarpeted
&gt;   with indoor/outdoor carpeting from Home Depot in a very tasteful gray color.
&gt;   What about making carpet runners out of that stuff?
&gt; 

Yeah, I'd like it to look classier.  If I find the right remnants, I'll use
them, otherwise if I have to cut, it'll look tacky.
