Subject:      TGIF: Meet Me In St. Louis (song parody)

I'm a St. Louisan. I lived there for 21 years straight before moving to
Iowa for a few months and then to Florida (where I am now.) I regret that I
wasn't able to make it to BBTA -- it would have been great. Perhaps next year?

&quot;By The Arch&quot; is a misnomer, by the way -- the arch is 45-60 minutes from
the actual location of the event. But it's *not* to be missed if you're at
BBTA -- and a few other places that might be of interest are the Car
Museum, the Transport Museum, the Science Center (don't miss the IMAX
movies!), and Forest Park.

Meet me in St. Louis, Louis
Drive your bus up there
Don't tell me the oil's a-clogging
Hurry and find out where

We can shoot the breeze with Bus fans
I can join on in the cruisin' -
If you will meet me in St. Louis, Louis
The place to be is there.

Meet me in St. Louis, Louis
Down at the Riverfront
Don't let the downtown traffic scare ya
Just drive anywhere you want

Show me your bright green Westy
And though mine is rather dusty -
We'll have fun in St. Louis, Louis
Just in time for lunch.

Meet me in St. Louis, Louis
It's time to turn for home
Don't let the memories vanish
Whenever you feel alone

&gt;From the wide Missouri
To the wider Mississippi -
We had fun in St. Louis, Louis
I'll be returning there.
