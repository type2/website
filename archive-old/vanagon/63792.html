&lt;&lt; Do all '85 Westys have a white reflective strips on the leading edge flare
 of the rear wheel wells?  Are they replaceable?  Where do you get them,
 mine are messed up.  I think they look cool but don't really understand why
 they are there.  Any ideas?

LOL !!!  :&lt;)
they are not &quot;reflective strips&quot; , but merely adhesive &quot;gravel guards&quot;.....
this is a common practice among ALL automotive manufacturers, and it protects
the paint on the rear wheel well flare...
personally, i'd just mask off the perimeter of them and spray them w/ the
factory color (available in spray cans from your dealer) or you could just
peel them off w/ the aid of a hairdryer, and buy some clear plastic film,
trace, cut and stick....
