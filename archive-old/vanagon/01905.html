&gt; ###  Hey, it's Friday!  Song Time!                                 ###
&gt; ###  All this yak about how fast these vehicles will go            ###
&gt; ###  has prompted me to offer up the following                     ###
&gt; ###  paean to the Unvarnished Truth                                ###
&gt; ###  This is that caissons song you learned in your militaristic   ###
&gt; ###  grade school.  Does anyone know what a caisson is?            ###
&gt; 

&lt;Awesome tune edited out for brevity&gt;

Should someone be keeping track of all of these gems?  I envision a
karaoke album, to be sold at Dead concerts, full of well-known 
melodies, and song sheets with our most excellent lyrics.

After the first gold record, we could put out a Laser Karaoke album,
with our vans/buses lumbering in the background (or even the 
foreground).  

Start videotaping your van!  Become A Star!  If we can't do the 
marketing at Dead concerts, well, there's always cheap time on the
local cable companies for &quot;infomercials&quot;.  Perhaps we could even get
some sort of tax exemption if we claim our &quot;business&quot; is really 
a religon. We all religously maintain our buses, don't we?

Whaddya say?
