&gt; Thread has morphed into a gauge thread and my 2 cents is that cheaper
&gt; gauges (than the $50 estimated in a previous post) are ok.  If you need
&gt; to choose between one VDO gauge and two or three JC Whitney's, get the
&gt; cheap ones.  You don't need accuracy to the nearest 2lbs of oil pressure,
&gt; you just need to be able to tell when the engine starts doing something
&gt; it didn't do yesterday.

I agree 100% with the above, except that...

The price I quoted ($50) included the sender.  I don't think the JC
Whitney gauges include senders, certainly not the type to fit a VW engine.
With Oil pressure, for instance, you will *have* to buy the VDO sender,
which is over $20.  I wasn't sure if the VDO sender would work with
other gauges, so I bought the VDO gauge, too. The VDO gauges also look
really nice, and at least come close to matching the other VDO instruments
that came with the bus (speedo, clock). 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd hate to think that anyone is scared off from gauging their van in
&gt; a healthy way by the cost of fancy VDO parts.  Gauges let you drive 
&gt; with much more confidence.

Agreed.  Scary to think that I paid as much for those 3 gauges as I did
for the whole van when I bought it, but that's how important they are to
me.  IMO, gauges (be they VDO or less expensive ones) are absolutely
essential to have on an air cooled VW.
