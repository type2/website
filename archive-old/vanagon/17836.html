Subject: Thoughts on sliding door noise


While I was opening the sliding door on my vanagon last night its suddenly
occurred to me that the majority of the noise was eminating from the track
cover that runs along the outside of the van. It seems to act as a
sounding board. I wonder if some of that sound deadening material (so
shamelessly promoted on this list by Joel), applied to the inside of this
cover would quieten the door a bit?
