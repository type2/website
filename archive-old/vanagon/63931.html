Subject: Matamoras VW show...WHAT A BLAST!!  (f)

well folks, I'm just reporting on the &quot;Tri State VW Expo&quot; at Tri State
Campground in Matamoras, Pa..
It was a great show, weather was beautiful (a little muggy, but..) sun was
out on the beautiful Delaware river....
Yes...It took me 2 hrs to drive there, and we were the first ones to get
there..
well, not many good deals in the swap meet area, unfortuneately...
and as far as the show, I'm happy to say, that I personally took first place
in all the show classes, (exept for a couple from Va on their way back from
New England in a white '84 westy who had absolutely no idea they were in a VW
show....  &quot;Huh...what's a VW show??&quot; )
Well, I was kinda miffed about the attendance....though.......  
Usually you need some VW's to have a VW show...  :&lt;)

What the heck happened??
when was the show cancelled??
jeez, you would think the promotors would at least put the word out on the
Net about the cancellation.. some people drive quite a few miles to ge to
these things...

(I bet that poor couple vacationing there in the campground in their '84
westy have been approached by quite a few miffed show-goers this morn asking
&quot;Where's the VW show??&quot;.....)

Well, fess up people, I doubt I was the only one to show up there today....
gr&amp;%$#_at_ woke up at 5 am for nothin...
