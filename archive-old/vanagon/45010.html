What Dennis says is true and I found this out the hard way in the mid 70's
with my '69 Camper - readings were WAY OFF.  In fact the newest VDO Catalog
now states NOT to use this &quot;T&quot; Fitting (VDO 240 850) for Oil Temp readings as
the sensor bulb of the VDO 323 057 is not immersed in the oil flow.
