&gt; I also had to have six seats in my '73 Westy.  The easiest way is to just 
&gt; get an extra back seat seatbelt and fasten it in next to the closet.  The 
&gt; left side (facing forward) has a mount next to the existing belt and the 
&gt; right side mount is back inside the closet.  Snake it up through the seat 
&gt; and you have three seats across the couch, one in the rear facing seat and 
&gt; two in the front.

Sounds like the best way, if you still want to use it camping.
