Subject: Bus Window Frames - done!
Date: Mon, 30 Oct 1995 18:42:49 -0800 (PST)


Hi,

	Yesterday I finished putting the newly painted and rubbered 
front window frames in.

	First, the bad news:  They were a lot harder to get in than they
should have been, no thanks to the base rubber that was about 2mm too
narrow, which would not let the window seat properly.  This was partially to
blame for the next problem:  The leg of the frame closest to the striker
plate portion of the door crease the inside of the door, which in turn
cracked the paint :( :( :(  I also ended up marring the new paint on the
door frame in my struggles :(

	The good news:  The frames looks good from a few steps back, so you
don't see the scratches.  The new rubber is nice and air/water tight, and it
passed the garden hose test: I can spray them full on with a garden hose and
no water gets inside.

	I also have no drafts inside, at least not from the front windows. 
I had one teakettle squeel from the passenger vent wing, but a judiciously 
placed piece of weatherstripping stopped that one.  The problem with the
vent wings is twofold:  A) the latches are pretty sloppy, and B) the
mounting stud was so rusty that once I de-rusted it, it would no longer
hold the nut!  I need to find a MUCH smaller size nut, cut new threads, and
then put the spring back on.  Right now, they won't stay open when driving,
but I can live with that for now.  They are warm and dry, which was my
immediate short term objective.

	The Major Bummer, however, is that the new rubber is for older
windows only, so now I have to search for the proper rubber, particulary
the felt chanels, so I can put the _proper_ windows in, which means doing
the whole thing over again.  No hurry.

Thom
