[Can't get Yokohama Y370G's in 195/70/14]

Didn't see this one answered yet--hope my experience helps.

The 205's will work fine.  I ran studded 215 snow tires on the
rear of my '72 bus every winter for a few years until someone
stole them and their rims from my carport.  (I'd regularly zip
past stuck 4wd's on snowy roads on my way to/from skiing.)  The
tire guys (at Upeniek's Tire in Seattle) said the 215's were a
little extreme, but 205's are fine.  I found that they gave a
springier, more forgiving-of-railroad-crossings ride than the
195's.  Passengers often comment that they are surprised by the
nice ride (and the nasty smells :) in my '72 bus.  I guess it's
the tires and the stock(!) 23 year old german shocks and
springs.

Dennis
