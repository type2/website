Subject: Will 73-74 bug parts fit a '74 van?

hey now,

while down at my folks house way out in the country, i found  a junk yard with
a bunch of vw bugs and a couple of buses. the bugs look to be in reasonable
shape...what i want to know is will the heater boxes of a early 70's bug fit a
'74 transporter? the guy is gonna crush these bugs sometime in late january if
i don't get back to him soon. i didn't crawl under them cuz i didn't have my
work clothes on but they look to be in decent shape with little rust. let me
know....i may be able to get tie rods, cv joints, heater boxes, and other
parts. the guy said he basically just wants to get rid of them cuz they are
taking up space.

the same guy said they crushed a couple of early 70's vans and a couple of
splitties about 7 months ago....:-(
