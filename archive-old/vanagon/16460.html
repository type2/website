Subject: RE: Thom: Bye for Now

        Thom:  (If you can still get this)
        
        Your boss is an ass.  So much for the obvious.
        
        Now what do I do for those nifty &quot;thought for the day&quot; type 
        announcements?  I got a lot of them, especially the funniest 
        ones, from you.   Many of my students will be in mourning.
        
        Peace good friend,
        Skip Correll
