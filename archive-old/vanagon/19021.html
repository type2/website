Subject: Re: Bentley cost?

&gt;&gt;chewed by the baby... anyway (I do have a point, here), do the Bentley books
&gt;&gt;actually cost about $100? American? That seems pretty expensive -- is that an
&gt;&gt;inflated price? Thanks!
&gt;

The vanagon manual IS disgustingly expensive. Bear in mind it covers 
aircooled, diesel and wasserboxer engines, as well as 4sp + 5spd + 
Syncro-bits tranny, and is thus twice as thick as other VW Bentley manuals.
        I paid $95 CDN in '88, only because the bookseller who ordered it in 
for me said he just couldn't sell it at the list of $130. good guy, Can-Do 
Books in Toronto.
        Remember, that $US65-85 is about 1.5 hrs VW labour, which you can 
get back really fast when you fix something trivial. Plus you are defeating 
VWoA! And... the true stamp of 'motorhead' can only be obtained by reading 
repair manuals blatantly in public.  tim s.
