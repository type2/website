First off, I assume when you say you looked in the master cylinder that you
mean you looked in the *reservoir* above the master cylinder, right?

Brake fluid does not evaporate, as far as I know.  If the level dropped,
you have a leak somewhere.

If your reservoir doesn't have a cap on it, you have a problem.  If dust
and dirt got in there, there is no telling what could happen.  I would 
guess that your master cylinder and/or lines might be plugged.

&gt; 2) With my SO pumping and the blleder open, it took a long time before
&gt; anything came out.  Then I got splatters of air/fluid, then nothing.
&gt; I loosened the line at the master cylinder (which is real close to being new)
&gt; and I got a lot of air out there, and then some fluid.  What's the deal?
&gt; After bleeding the air out there, I got decent bleeding out of the front
&gt; cylinders.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) I only get an anemic dribble of fluid from the back bleeders, and I bled 
&gt; the air out at the master cylinder like I did the fronts,, but still no luck.
&gt; I mean its just a barely perceptible dribble. 

Yup, sounds like something's clogged.  When was the last time your rear
brakes were serviced?  How old are the &quot;cylinders&quot; back there?

&gt; 4) Part of the fluid i did get out looked like old milk.  Like what you would
&gt; get out of a carton with the Lindberg baby's picture on it.

That kinda sounds like some water got in there.

	I would completely drain your system and start from scratch.  
Disconnect all your brake lines and blow through them to make sure they 
are clear.  Take apart the cylinders in all four wheels, clean them and
make sure the pistons move freely and all passages are clear.  I don't know
if the master cylinder can be cleaned or not, but if dirt has gotten in
there, you should clean or replace it also, even if it is &quot;near new&quot;.
Sorry if that is not what you wanted to hear (i.e. quick fix).
