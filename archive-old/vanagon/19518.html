Subject: re: a racial issue?????

All,

The gist of the story was to illustrate the lack of concern that this PERSON,
showed when he dinged the car door.  The act of revenge may have been a bit
over the top, but whether the PERSON was black, hispanic, asian, indian, or
white, is not at all germane to the story. Frankly if I had been in the same
situation, I may have done the same thing.  After spending a couple of hundred
dollars on a new paint job would probably evoke a similar response in many
people, even today.
But that is enough of this line of thought. This is not an affirmative action
mailing list.  Discussions of racial predjuice are for a different place than
this.

Step down from the soapbox now David, thank you.

Regards,

David
