Subject: Much mail

Volks Folks,

I am more than a little overwhelmed with the amount of mail I am recieving
from the vanagon list - 140 pieces this morning.

Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to a
couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?  That way an individual could
sign on to one or all depending on his/her interests.

This is a great group of folks and this message is in no means meant as a
flame to anyone...I just can't keep up with 100+ pieces of mail a day.

Comments?

Dan
