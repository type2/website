I think Jim is right.  The five spoke allow wheels were a $ 380.00 option
on my '91 westy. Other options
automatic, power door locks, cruise control and power windows.

&gt; &gt;Hmmm. Stock wheels for a US version 91 Westie are the alloy ones. Sounds
&gt; &gt;like these are steel. I wonder what other goodies were stripped off so
&gt; &gt;they could sell it at such a bargain price!
&gt; 
&gt; To which I must add:   NOT
&gt; The alloys were standard on the Vanagon GL Camper Syncro, but were
optional
&gt; on the mere Vanagon GL Camper.  Tom, not all Vanagons are Syncro Westies!
