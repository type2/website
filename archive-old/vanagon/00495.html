Subject:       Re: electrical ideas (wild theories and other natural pheno


&gt; an idea i had been kicking around for a long time was to take a 2nd
&gt; alternator (or generator) and match it up to some tiny little gasoline
&gt; engine ... like a very small lawn mower engine ... making your own little
&gt; 12v auxilliary generator.
&gt; 
How about SOLAR? Have you heard of REAL GOODS in Ukiah Ca. They have 
mild to wild solar kits. One of the mild ones is a stright forward 
battery charger system for an RV. The kit has everything but the 
battery. Best part of the whole deal is the fuel is free :-)

There number is 1-800-762-7325
