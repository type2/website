Subject: Re: [Fwd: Re: 79 Water-cooled Bus?]

  I am not on this list; my brother forwarded me the water cooled bus
posting because he knew I have been curious for a long time about this
beast.  Forgive my breaking in, hopefully my question will also be of
interest to others on the list. 
  The bus described by Jeff (Oxroad_at_aol_dot_com) sounds exactly like the buses
you see all over Mexico.  They are still in production.  Now, the VW people
in Mexico must have done something to the engine (high compression pistons?)
because these buses were able to blow the doors off my 2400 cc Nissan
pickup, which was empty and in good tune at the time.  I have always
wondered what was in those buses engine compartment. If anyone knows how VW
Mexico was able to make a (1600 cc?) Rabbit engine perform like that, I
would like to know.  
  Email the answer to me at jefflem_at_jps_dot_net, because I am not on the list,
though I have fond memories of a 1965 double cab kombi pickup.  P.S. '84 4x4
Nissan king cab pickup for sale, excellent condition....  :-)

&gt;&lt;&lt; I just got a J.Crew clothing catalogue in the mail (the Vacation 1997
&gt;issue).
&gt; And on page 117 there is a light blue (actually I guess it's gray primer)
&gt; late 70s Westfalia bus with a fairly large black radiator grill on the
&gt;front.
&gt; In the center of the grill is the VW symbol. It's hard to tell from the
&gt;photo
&gt; but it looks like it is more than a cosmetic alteration. If anyone has this
&gt; catalogue or knows of the actual bus and knows the story of it, I'd love to
&gt; know. I'm guessing the photo was taken in California. Or if the catalogue is
&gt; kicking around your house check it out this oddity. I realize it's not a
&gt; Vanagon but it piqued my interest and I thought it might interest others.

&gt;Maybe it's a late model Mexican bus.  They used the old '79 &amp; earlier bus
&gt;body and had a radiator stuck on front and a watercooled rabbit engine in the
&gt;back.
