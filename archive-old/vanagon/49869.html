 I just drove a 1997 Eurovan Camper. It was very nice, had lots of power (new
 6 cyl. engine), but it cost $37,500!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That is, in my humble
 opinion, ridiculous and has no relationship whatsoever to what &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
 once stood for.  I've been curious about this vehicle for months, but that
 price tag is just way way way too much.

If you consider that it is now possible to spend $35K on a Caravan,  This
almost seems like a bargain!  Check with your tax man.  As an RV you can
probably write the loan off as a second home mortgage and you can probably
finance it for 10 years or more(YUK).  You can not do that with a Caravan!
 Still, I still like the Rialta for $43K.
