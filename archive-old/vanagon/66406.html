Subject:      More cheap vans FS

Hi all,

I hope that I got information to everyone who responded to the last cheap vanagon
search posting.  If not, and you are in a blistering hurry to find out about it, E-mail Unca
Joel, he'll have the info on the Westy while I'm gone to Orlando on VACATION!!!  YEAH!!!
All other vans that were listed should be available on the Archives, just like any other
posting.

Thanks Joel !

Thanks to Jim Catterson in Long Island, NY for hooking me up with his friend Chris
Nicolino, also from Long Island, who is the proud new owner of the '86 Syncro that I
posted last month.  He bought it against the wishes of all but one of his friends and even
against his wife.  BRAVO, Chris!!
He got a fine van indeed.  When he sends me pictures of the Syncro washed with new tires
and all, I will post the pictures on my upcoming website to show the cool SYNCRO
plakette on the front that I had made locally at a stripe shop.  It is very cool.  The stripe
shop said that they would be more than happy to accomodate the listmembers with
copies of the plakette for about $40.00 + postage.  It is scalable to any size for more
money, so it is possible to do the entire side of a van, given enough money.   Let me say
that anyone who could redo a house in the way Jim has done his is tops in my book.  I
never even suspected that a house could look like that. WOW!  Beyond description.  His
stable includes a beautiful 91? Syncro that looks like is should be in a display case, and a
EV that should make anyone jealous.  Beautiful wife, beautiful little girl, wonderfully overfed
lab, friendly neighbors...  Jim, you looking to adopt?  I'm available!

Now I have the capital to finish my V6 Vanagon project and get my Sony digital camera &amp;
all.  I will miss that Syncro.  It pulled My 88 Fox with a tow dolly all the way from Ga to
Long Island via Hilton Head Island, SC at 75-85 MPH up hill!!!  What a beast!!

Needless to say that I was a real hit in NY city with my rolled coins and 7.5' wide tow dolly
and GA plates.  ;-)

So all that said, here's the latest list of cheap vanagons:
