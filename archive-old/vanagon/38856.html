Relating to cooling, revs, and speed of a 2.0 aircooled Weston said:

Frankly I don't run much over 60.  I haven't taken it to the mountains yet
but I would imagine that that will be like leading a parade at 40 mph! Try
35 mph with a '83 aircooled Westy 4spd!

Actually there is a rev-limiter set up on the stock distributor. I think
this is only if you have the limiting points. I am not totally clear on
this. Perhaps one of the other list members can expound on this. Found out
about this while struggling out of the LA valley coming home to Phoenix last
Summer. Just about swallowed my tounge when the engine simply &quot;quit&quot; while
climbing with a zillion mile trail of every kind of vehicle on my tuchas!
The &quot;quit&quot; mode ended as soon as the revs came down and I shifted to
compensate. It took lots of scrubbing to get the drivers seat clean. ;-)
 I was simply pushing it too hard and didn't know it. I really try to baby
the vehicle so this took me very much by surprise.  Now I simply go for the
white knuckle chain smoking 35mph thing. This is the only aspect of the
Westy that I hate with a passion. Maintained the same turtle crawl 35 mph
climb from Phoenix to Heber, AZ on a camp trip later in the same Summer.
Even 100 year old Winnebago drivers were screaming past us in disgust. Bum-mer!
