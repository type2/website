So this kid is driving along in his VW bug and pulls up beside a Rolls Royce 
at a red light.  He looks the car up and down while the guy driving the Rolls 
is giving his bug the once over.

The kid rolls down his window and taps on the passenger side window of the 
Rolls.  The Rolls driver uses the power window button to roll it down.

&quot;Hey do you got a TV in there?&quot; the kid asks.

&quot;Of course I do,&quot; replies the Rolls driver.  &quot;It's a Rolls Royce!&quot;

&quot;Ya, I got a TV in here too,&quot; says the kid and drives off as the light turns 
green.

So they get up to the next red light and they are side by side once again.

&quot;Do you got a VCR in there?&quot;, asks the kid.

&quot;Of course,&quot; replies the driver of the Rolls.

&quot;Ya, me too,&quot; says the kid.  Then the light turns green and the kid takes off.

A couple lights later, they both hit a red and the kid pulls up beside the 
Rolls again.

&quot;Do you have a bed in there?&quot;, asks the kid.

&quot;No,&quot; says the Rolls driver.

&quot;Well, I got a bed back here,&quot; says the kid pointing into the back seat area. 
 &quot;It sleeps two.&quot;

So the light changes and the kid drives off.

Now the driver of the Rolls Royce is a very rich man and won't be outdone by 
some kid in a VW bug so he goes directly to his high-priced, 
white-coat-with-no-stains-wearing mechanic and says he wants a bed installed 
in the back of his car.  The mechanic says that it will cost $34,000 but the 
man says that money is no object.

So a couple days later, the man picks up his Rolls Royce and starts driving 
around town looking for this kid.  Finally he spots the bug parked in a 
parking lot at a mall.  SO he pulls the Rolls up beside the bug and gets out.

The windows of the bug are all steamed up and he can't see in so he just taps 
lightly on the driver side window.

No answer.

He taps a little harder.

No answer.

He knocks hard.

No answer.

Finally, he pounds on the window with both fists yelling &quot;HEY KID!&quot;

After 15 seconds or so, the driver's side window rolls down and steam start 
pouring out.  The kid then sticks his head out.

&quot;I just wanted to let you know that I had a bed installed in my Rolls&quot;, says 
the man.  &quot;It cost me $34,000 but my mechanic said it's the best bed on the 
market.&quot;

The kid looks at the man....looks at the car...and says &quot;YOU GOT ME OUT OF THE 
SHOWER FOR THAT!&quot;

I heard that one as the joke of the day on the local radio station the other 
day.
