Subject: Solex\Pierburg 2E3 carburettors

I need some information about the Solex/Pierburg 2E3 carburettors
as fitted to my 1989 1.9 watercooled Transporter. I'm having some
problems when cold (hesitation and lack of power) which disappear
when the engine is warm. It also seems to be slow at accelerating
when cold or warm. Idle is fine, starting is fine. 

Before I start poking sharp things and blunt objects into my carb
I would like to know how it is SUPPOSED to function, especially
as the engine warms up. Is there any info in the archives? Has
anyone tried to service this type of carburettor? Was it fitted
to any other make of vehicle?

There is a Haynes manual for all Solex carbs, but it doesn't seem
to explain the functioning too well. And I want to avoid paying
10 quid for 8 pages on the 2E3 :)
