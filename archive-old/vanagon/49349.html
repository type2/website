&gt; My wife was coming home from a long trip, when she started to have problems

&gt; it would grind into reverse.  With the clutch pedal to the floor you could
&gt; shift into 1st-4th, but it would grap within the first inch of pedal
&gt; movement.  The fellow who works on my van has looked at this problem before
&gt; and said the &quot;shift guides&quot; are worn.  The problem went away, but now is
&gt; back.  Any help would be appreciated. Van has 140K on it.

           Try the clutch!   If shifting is a problem in all gears   
           the clutch is probably hanging up.
