Subject: Re: oil level question

Jared Asks -

&gt;I have an 82 Vanagon, just got it a month ago. When is the proper time to 
&gt;check the oil, when it is cold or after it has been running for awhile???

When cold, check your oil with the Wanagon parked on a level surface.  I
check mine every morning before I use it.  If the oil level is between the
two marks on the dipstick you're OK

When the engine is warm and/or you've been drivin' it awhile, let it sit for
about 5 or 6 minutes before checking it.  Let all the oil drain back into the
sump from the nooks and crannies (Thomas' Muffins?).
