thom:

i'm sure you're aware of this, but for redundacy's sake i'll give a quick
run down on bubble window westy's interiors:

1968-74

the interior's on these Westy's didn't change too much (similar in
appearance to 64-67' Westy's), about the only real big change was the type
of woodgrain used, and the fact that in 74' the coldbox became a real live
fridge. The pullout bed was situated more to the driver's side o' the van,
with the long linen closet running the length of the passenger side o' the
van.

1975-79

In 75' the flipped things around. The bed moved closer to the pass. side of
the van (i.e. the side w/ the sliding door), and the linen closet was
discontinued, and replaced with a smaller storage closet situated, just
above the place where the spare tire storage place is (back corner of
van)In 76' they did a few more mods (all stuff moved to driver's side of
van, 'cept bed)

Maybe instead of reengineering the bed etc. etc. you could get a westy bed
that was much closer to your needs. Over the years the interior has been
rearranged in so many different ways by Westfalia, I'm sure you could find
something close to your needs.

That is my 2 cents worth.
