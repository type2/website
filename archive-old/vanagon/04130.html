&gt;Subject: VW's rebuilt engine offer?
&gt;Last month, several folks wrote of a $2500 rebuilt engine offer by VW
&gt;covering all water-cooled vanagons.  The local dealer here says VW doesn't
&gt;offer rebuilts for these models, only &quot;new&quot; engines costing maybe $8K!
&gt;Would anyone whose dealer gave them specific info on the rebuilt offer
&gt;please give me the date, dealer name, and phone # of their source?

Jim Ellis VW
Chamblee, Georgia (actually Atlanta)
1-800-653-5547    (ask for Joe Baisle ... he's the most knowledgable about
                   vanagons)
i don't remember the exact date, but it was whenever we were talking about
this on the list.
