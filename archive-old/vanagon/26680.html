Subject: Saw some cool campers the other day.

While on our trek the other evening I went past our local VW dealer and saw
that they had five Vanagons on the used car lot.  We stopped and checked
them out.  The '85 GL was an automatic as were the beautiful '90 and '91
GL's.  Then there was an '83 Westy diesel in ok shape, and a '90 Westy
Syncro with EVERYTHING including a TV that looked like original equipment.
I was afraid to ask how much for that one.

Then we saw two new Eurovans that were Winnebago camper jobs.  They weren't
like the huge hack job beasts that I saw on a commercial once, they looked
rather Westy-like.  They were both 5 cylinder units and the camper stuff was
LOADED inside.  As in four captains chairs AND the rear bed folded out all
at once.  The conversions were $9700 on top of the $22,000 van.
