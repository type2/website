&gt;Thought many of you (Sami? and others who've been gassed excluded) might get
&gt;a kick out of this-

&lt;Ouch!&gt;

&gt;	Changed my fuel filter today.  Got gas all over my face.

Note that you *could* put clamps on the hoses... :-) I use my vise grips
for that. (but with the fuel tank, I didn't have that option.) -- Sami
