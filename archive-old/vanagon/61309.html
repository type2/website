&gt; My Vanagon tranny has a bad input shaft, discovered when we pulled it to

(snip)
&gt; 1) does removal of the input shaft entail anything beyond removal of the
&gt; bellhousing,
      Yes
&gt; removal of the carrier bearings on either side of the shaft, the ring gear,
&gt; and then getting the snap ring loose? 
         NO
 This procedure was suggested to me by
&gt; a transmission person in central Ohio I don't know too well.
&gt; 
       He needs to find a new career!

&gt; 2) Will the input shaft from a later (water-cooled vanagon) tgransmission,
&gt; or earlier transmission from other vehicle work?
&gt; 3) I might be able to get the existing shaft tig welded, and then reground,
&gt; if I can do this cost-effectively.Any thoughts here?
&gt; I don't know what caused the shaft to get bunged up, but do worry a bit
&gt; about other bearings getting loose that might have caused this. A valid concern?
     
      It's really easy to put an input shaft in. Assuming it is similar
      to the 1986 and up. The bell housing comes off, there is a c-clip
      on the shaft next to a coupling, after you remove the clip, the
      spline coupler will slide on the shaft to allow the shaft to turn
      free from the trans input shaft. NO need to remove the rear end
      gears.
  
      your problem is finding what beat up the shaft!
