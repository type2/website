&lt;&lt; A few Weeks ago I painted my exhaust using POR-15  black exhaust paint.
  After over 1000 miles of highway and rummaging through the Mud at Hershey,
i
 am surprised that the paint is still intact.  Not a hint of bubbling off.  I
 don't know how lon it will last but it went on real easy and hardened after
 driving for a while.  A $12.00 can will do the exhaust, all brackets with
 some left over.  I'll see how it works over the winter.

Thanks for the advice Dennis.  The so called &quot;exhaust paint&quot; I put on my
exhaust pipes a while back lasted about 20 minutes!
