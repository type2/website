Yo,

	Last night I went down to Harbor Freight and bought their $160
sandblaster ($99 on sale)

	This is the pressurized 40# model.  Comes with a hood, which looks
just about useless.

	I'd never seen this thing put together, so after I spend an hour
or so assembling it while ROFLMAO at the Letterman special, I got to see
what it looked like.

	Here's how it works:  Its a big bottle looks a little like a 
propane bottle on wheels with handles.  Fill it with sand/media and close the 
lid.  Hook up the air.  The air goes thru a dryer (cheap, came with it)
and then splits: half goes to the tank, half goes down a tube to the bottom
of the tank.  The media comes down the bottom of the tank, is picked up
in the air stream, and heads out a hose to the nozzle.  The nozzle is
kinda cheezy too, might pick up a nicer one.

	Still gotta hook up the compressor, and pick up some sand, and
maybe I can try it out this weekend!

Thom
