&gt; Help!
&gt; We have some really old crappy stickers on our pop out window (pre us ie over
&gt; 20 years old). We want to remove but are seeming impossible. They seem to be
&gt; some kind of plastic and only the  surface comes off mm by mm leaving
&gt; gunk/smear. 
&gt; I am afraid of using a scraper in case of scratching the glass. Anyone got any
&gt; ideas?
&gt; Of course if they were Grateful Dead stickers that'd be alright! BTW Anyone
&gt; got a line on one of these for me...? I'll swap sumfin?   Dave

Try a blow dryer! Just aim it at the stickers...heat them up a bit. It 
makes them easier to remove. You can use a single-edge razor from that 
point without too much trouble. I found this out by experience. I 
transferred 30+ stickers from my old vehicle to my 78 bus using this method.
(And guess what...they're ALL Grateful Dead stickers!)
 
Nothing left to do but :) :) :)
