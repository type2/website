Subject: Looking at 86 GL

We're looking at an 86 GL with 141k miles at a used car dealer's lot.
I'm going to go back Saturday to drive it and take it to my mechanic on
Monday. It was owned by the proverbial little old lady that goes to his
church and service records are unknown. My question is this, is it
possible that this has gone 141k miles with no head work being done?
&gt;From following the list, my feeling is that this would be very unlikely.
There were no obvious coolant leaks and overflow tank in back was full.
For $2200 it's looking like it might be a good deal.

Dave
