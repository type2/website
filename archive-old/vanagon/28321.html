Subject: Re: What's a Backfire


I was taught that a back-fire occurs in the exhaust when an accumulated
charge of combustable gases is ignited, either by the exhaust gas from
another cylinder or by some other means, causing it to 'fire back' into the
cylinder.

A stack-fire on the other hand is when the gases in the intake manifold are
ignited, causing the thing to fire-back through the carb.  Stack-fire is
usually more destructive and dangerous than a backfire although either is a
good symptom that something is wrong with the ignition timing or valve train.

Of course, you can cause your engine to backfire simply by switching the
ignition off and then on while at speed.  Kids love to do this and mechanics
love them to do it too, since the resulting damage to the engine and exhaust
system insures a steady income and early retirement.
