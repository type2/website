   I found it yesterday in the Sierras.  It is definitely a barndoor, 
&gt;      very rust free (no thru the body rust holes) with all the parts there.

&gt;       I couldn't get a look at the body number badge because of this mad 
&gt;      rotwiler that lives with it.  It has semiphors, bullet blinkers that 
&gt;      are inside and below center of the headlights, and the cutiest little 
&gt;      sewing machine in the rear, I'm sure it's original.  The popup is only

&gt;      about 3 foot by 2 foot just over the side doors.  four windows per 
&gt;      side.  It looks like it had been sitting here for a while, at least a 
&gt;      couple of years or so.  It looks to be complete as far as camping 
&gt;      setup, but the wood does need work.
&gt;      

pop-up  ?    what, was this some kind of home converted camper? A fibreglass
top?

does the &quot;sewing machine&quot;  refer to it's motor?   Do you mean a 36hp?  what's
the engine number?  Did you realize the vin number is in the engine
compartment,  on the bulkhead that separates the engine compartment from the
cargo area, to the right of the engine.  it's stamped in the metal and also
on a plate with other info that is rivited on.   You are sure it is a
&quot;barndoor&quot;  bus,  with the huge engine compartment door that hinges at the
belt line?    European buses to 59 came with semaphores, too.

Is there an owner other than the dog?

Do the four windows per side include the front door windows?  Is there a back
hatch? What colour is the bus?   What does the dash look like?  taillights?

good luck

Clara
