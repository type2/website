Subject:       Cable lubricators /type motorcycle

Yamaha, years ago made a wonderfull cable lubricator.  It consisted 
of a cast aluminum body with a thumbscrew that would compress a 
rubber sealing deely-bob onto the end of a cable.  One then uses 
their favorite aerosol lube with a snorkle hose and sticks the 
snorkle into a tiny port in the lubricator.  Every thing on these 
jobs was very well made and the bugger really works (they even had a 
small rubber seal where the snorkle goes in).  It is one of my 
favorite tools  box  additions and is frequently used.  It is 
particularly effective in loosening heater control cables.

I'd bought this over 20 years ago (it is frightening how short that 
seems) so I don't know if its still available but if you find one, 
grab it.  Maybe its all the lube that gets left on it but the rubber 
pieces on it are as good as new
