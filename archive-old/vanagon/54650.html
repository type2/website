Subject: Re: Need Immediate Help~Show dates!

I'd like any information on this show also.  I live in the area and have 
been looking for a van for my family.  Dates, times, probability of 
finding van, size of event, location etc. would be helpful  TIA  Thad

&gt; I need the dates of the SanJose California Kelly Park Show that is usually
&gt; held on either the first or second weekend of April. Due to office politics
&gt; I need to have the &quot;vacation days&quot; aproved prior to noon Arizona time on
&gt; Monday, Jan 20th, 1997. Several calls to the folks who should know have not
&gt; helped as of yet. I guess the holiday and or business travel have taken the
&gt; appropriate players out of my reach.
&gt; Please help as I need the &quot;vacay&quot; days for travel to and from Phoenix to the
&gt; show and back. Thanks!
