&gt; 
&gt; OK, I'm confused.  What is meant by final drive ratio?
&gt; I understood FD to be overall engine revolutions per tire rotation.  
&gt; Is it:
&gt; 
&gt;         FD = R&amp;P * 4th ?
&gt; 
&gt; or 
&gt; 
&gt;         FD = R&amp;P ?
&gt; 
&gt; where   FD = final drive ratio
&gt;         R&amp;P = ring and pinion gear ratio
&gt;         4th = 4th gear size
&gt; 
&gt; or none-of-the-above?  If the latter, how does one compute
&gt; engine revs / tire rotation?
&gt;

  I checked the data panels of both a &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; and a &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot;
  road test. They refer to the ring and pinion ratio as the &quot;final drive&quot;.

  There must be lots of equations to reach a &quot;revs/mile&quot; depending on which
  bits of info. you have to start with. IMHO, an easy way is to start with
  the wheel/tire diameter since this is easily measured with a yardstick.
  Multiply the tire diameter in inches by pi and divide that product by
  12 to get circumference in feet. Divide 5280 by the circumference and
  you should have wheel/tire revolutions per mile. Multiply wheel
  revolutions by the final drive and the gear ratio that you are interested
  in and the result will be engine revolutions per mile.

  I think it was you who is interested in what the &quot;Mountain ratio&quot; is? I
  have Haynes for 1600cc buses in front of me here:

		   Final Drive Ratio
		      Normal ratio................5.375:1
		      Mountain ratio..............5.857:1

                   
		   Identification code
		      CA..........................Normal
		      CB..........................Mountain ratio
		      CC..........................Normal w/ limited slip
		      CD..........................Mountain w/ limited slip

 
 For 185-R14 tires &lt;25.5 inch diamter&gt; we get 791 revs/mile at the wheel.
 791 * 5.857 * 0.82 = 3799 revs/mile. The wear index for this combination
 would be 1720 ft/mile, BTW.

 I think you said you were running 185/70-R14 tires though. The calculatd
 diameter (yours may actually be a little different?) for 185/70-R14
 that I get is 24.2 inches. Going through the procedure described above
 results in 833 revs/mile at the wheel and 4001 revs/mile at the flywheel.
 At &quot;a mile a minute&quot; we end up with the 4000 rpm you reported. Well within
 1 rpm anyway. Incidentally, the wear index for this combo is 1811 ft./mile.
 You may want to keep an eye  on your oil temperature at freeway speeds,
 at least until you get your transmission ratios sorted out.


 As to your question regarding gearbox rebuilding, I am no help. My
 transmissions have always whined a lot but they have never actually
 broken and been sent for rebuild. I did see an ad by a company called
 Tranform in Dune Buggies, Hot VWs, Rubber T&amp;A etc. for a gearbox they
 call the &quot;freeway flyer&quot;. I have no experience with this outfit and
 am not making a recommendation either for or against &lt;blah, blah, blah&gt;
 but, who knows, maybe they can help.


 Good luck,

 Dave Kautz
