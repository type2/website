Subject: RE: DC area - Mid atlantic events

sorry john for not responding sooner.  we (my so and soon to be 3 year old)
are planning a trip soon to Cape Hater's ass in my '65 deluxe.  First major 
road trip - ahhh.  will be bring surf boards and other assorted water toys.
still waiting to hear from SStones and connect on his trip down from Canada and
do a overnight camp (near the ocean?) soon.  I'll keep the east coasters posted
on these plans.  sorry, I won't be able to accomodate the schedule of everyone
else interested as our schedule rather constrained this year.  My appologies 
to the non-east coasters .......
