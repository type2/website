Although my pickup is not a vanagon, I'd also have to agree with steve
and say it's probably bad gas.  It is not as hard to get as you might
think.  But, the couple of times when my pickup has gotten it, I though
my pickup was on it's death bed ... a new tank of high-test (sometimes
2) running through it will clean it out pretty good.
