&gt; Hello everyone, I'm building an engine for my girlfriends ' 61 Bug and am
&gt; wondering about the thermostat.  I'd like to NOT install it at all and wire
&gt; the cooling flaps into an &quot;always open&quot; position.  I'm taking out the heat
&gt; exchangers and running J-tubes so not having a heater is obvious.  I did this
&gt; with my Type III engine, wiring the cooling flaps open but I'm just want to
&gt; get some advice for doing this with a Type I.  It's not driven much in the
&gt; winter although the winters can be cold (Eastern Washington). Thanks for the
&gt; input.....
&gt; 

put it back in...anyone who tells you otherwise (are there any on the list?)
is wrong. it's important in helping the engine warm up properly and helps 
keep the engine. why risk an engine for a $10 part? it does more then 
help heat the car....
