I could easily start a newsgroup based on the number of subscribers to this
mailing list.  But I wouldn't do this unless a vote was taken here and the
majority of respondants wanted to try it.

&gt;Jeez... so much talk, so little effort... Gerry busts his hump to keep
&gt;this list running as well as it does. Is he unique?

Nope.  There are lots of mailing list admins.  I ran the cavers' mailing
list for the first few years of its life, back in 1986, *before* majordomo.
I currently run the Inuvik mailing list.

I'm not intending to denigrate what Gerry does.  He's great at running the
mailing list.  But when it begins to impact his site, it's time to think
about using a newsgroup.
