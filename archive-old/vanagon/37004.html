&gt; 
&gt; There's a propane/CNG thread on the Vintage list... I was wondering if 
&gt; anyone here has done a conversion and knows if anyone around specializes 
&gt; in them. It seems like it'd be a great way not only to pass the 
&gt; emissions test but also run a cleaner car on general principles...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there done this?
&gt; 

You might want to check out this site: 

   http://wps_dot_com/LPG/index.html

It covers converting to LPG quite thoroughly.
