&gt;  My '74 Westfalia has a 12V silver socket beneath the glove box. The owners
&gt;  manual shows it in use, running the compressor that was included to fill the
&gt;  collapsible spare tire with which the vehicle was originally delivered.
&gt; 
Wow! any of youse guys not using your silver socket wanna send
it to me so I can use it to keep pressure in my windshield
washer reservoir?

Couldn't resist - ITS FREITAG!
