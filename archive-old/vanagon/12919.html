Subject:      bus generations

Jon Peters went on about the barndoors again, so i say:

ok. barndoors are a separate &quot;generation&quot;. then so are Syncros. they have
more physical differences from other 2wd Vanagons than Barndoors have from
later Microbuses. and Syncros drive very different (especially in the dirt!).

so now we've increased the confusion to what ... 6 &quot;generations&quot;??
