        On my old Motorcycle I spent several weeks trying to figure out the
intermittent operation of my engine. First thing I did was look at the
fuses. Replaced coils, computer, etc., to no avail. Finally, after about
$300 worth of (used!) parts, I thought maybe the connection behind the fuse
box was toast. So I pulled the fuse, and it came apart in my hand. The fuse
had rusted and the connection was intermittent, but the metal part inside
the glass was still intact. I know this isn't very useful for a VW, since
we use the euorpean type fuses, but a similar type of problem could
conceivably occur. I guess this post might save someone a few bucks
sometime.
