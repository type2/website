Subject: Gas Pressure Gauge

Hello VWers,

I would like to get a pressure gauge to measure the gas pressure after 
the fuel pump and before the pressure regulator on my 80 westy. I think
all FI vanagons have this T hook up for this measuement on the gas supply
ring.

The pressure should be around 30 psi if the fuel pump, fuel filter &amp;
the regulator are all in the proper conditions.

Is there anything you guys can recommend? I've checked the regular places
such as Kragen, Grand Auto &amp; such, they don't have anything for this.

Is it possible I can use my compression tester? or the gas going into the
compression tester will break it?

Regards,
Vahid
