Subject: To the guy in Puerto Rico

Sorry to send to all, but couldn't remeber his email,
You were looking for the turns for the side windows in your '70s bus if 
I recall. I was at a junk yard today and found 2 in new condition, took 
them off and have them here to send to you if you still need them. Let 
me know.
Peace,
Scoob
