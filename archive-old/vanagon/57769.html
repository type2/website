Subject: Vanagon handling (long)

Hello all,

Two unrelated incidents over the last 3 days indicate something about 
the inherent safety of the Vanagon:

1. Driving home in rainy conditions Thursday, I was daydreaming ever 
so slightly as I approached my left turn off the highway, a little 
too fast. The oncoming traffic is partly hidden behind a curve and 
centre divider, so I normally leave lots of room before turning. In 
this case, I decided it would be safer to take the turn than to risk 
sliding on the wet &amp; oily intersection. Although I had plenty of room 
to clear any traffic, the speed was a different matter. I was 
pleasantly surprised at the ease with which the Westy handled this 
turn, with only a very slight tail twitch near the apex, which was 
easily moderated with throttle.

Then, just hours ago, coming home from the store, I watched as an 
oncoming Aerost*r stopped for a crosswalk, and another Aerost*r, 
doing *maybe* 50km/h, driven by mom (complete with kids), tried to 
stop in time. It had 4-5 car lengths, and it *did* stop, but on the 
shoulder, facing the other way, narrowly missing a pole. As this is a 
very busy spot, it was lucky nobody was on the sidewalk.

I drove by slowly, catching the stunned, white knuckled mom, staring 
at the pole as I passed.

It makes me sick to think people actually feel *safer* carrying their 
families in these miniv*ns.

(as our first baby is due in five weeks (!! :), I'm going a little 
strange, I know.... Sorry.)
