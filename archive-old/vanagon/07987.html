Subject: Low Oil Pressure Resolved!

I was able to locate the reason my oil pressure idiot light and buzzer were
coming on at 2000 rpm.  After taking a closer look at the electrical connections
from the sensors, I discovered that a wire coming from one of the sensors had
become loose, (completly separated) within a connector located in the engine
compartment.  This was not visible until the connector was taken apart.  Anyway,
recrimping the wire to the connector has solved the problem, and I'm back in
action.  Those damn little electrical connectors!!!!
