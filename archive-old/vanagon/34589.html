Subject: sleepless in Eru[Drovan

Sorry for the typo in the subject line.  We thought of getting a Eurovan 
camper (with the Winnebago insides) and drove 1 1/2 hours to the nearest 
dealer that had one.  It seemed nicely thought out inside, but on the way 
home I noticed in the specs that both up and downstairs beds are only 43 
inches wide!!  That's 4 inches narrower than our present '87 Westfalia!  
What is your experiences, as couples?  We are not Buddhas but we're not 
minis either.  We are snug but JUST snug in the Westfalia.  The thought 
of spending a month at a time in a 43-inch bed is daunting.

Has anybody invented some magic extender kit that allows you to unfold 
side flaps when the roof is popped?  There's a way to make fame and 
fortune if you're mechanically inclined!
