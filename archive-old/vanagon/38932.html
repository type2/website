Subject: '87 Westy for sale

I checked out a '87 Westy yesterday on a local lot. It is a two local owner
car with 60k. The interior is quite clean, the engine very clean although
there is a bit of moisture on the left side of the engine(head gasket).

I think there has been a cover rug over the carpet so it is probably in
very nice shape.

The top rubber needs replacement. The stove is about like new. Cabinets
look nice. The van was Ziebarted when new and the updates have been done so
there is no rust on the car.

They are asking $10,500. Located in Ames, IA.
