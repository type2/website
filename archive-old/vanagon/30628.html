&gt;Subject: Gas heaters in Splitties

&gt;How is the duct-work for the gas heater hooked up in a
&gt;splittie?  Does it hook up to the main heater tube (and
&gt;crack windshields:-} This sounds particulary good given that
&gt;a wall behind the cockpit is a frequent temporary
&gt;cold-weather addition.

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;..Markus

In addition to the left engine compartment mount Tom
mentioned, I have seen a heater installed below the dash,
right at the feet of the passenger on a ('65, I think) bus.
This may not be the same heater Tom wrote about, but it sure
seems like a very handy location!  Anyone else seen this
installation?

That &quot;left rear&quot; installation always seemed like a good use
of space, but a poor way to heat.  I have a '66 &quot;parts bus&quot;
with a Stewart-Warner (?) in that location.  The ad hoc duct
run by the gas tank, thru the body, under the seat, and thru
the kick panel is big-time ugly!

I have a BN4 I would love to hook up in-line with the main
heat tube (if I had a main heat tube) on a '67.  Getting
power and fuel would not be a big problem, but exhausting it
could be potentially lethal I would think.

Years ago I had the BN4 installed as a &quot;Y&quot; connection to the
main heater tube on a '73.  The installation was not the
best and people driving by would honk and point under the
bus.  When the heater was running, the exhaust shot out the
bottom and it looked like the bus was on fire.  I didn't run
that way very long, traded the '73 for an '84 wasserboxer.
Haven't worried about heat since.
