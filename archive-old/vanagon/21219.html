Subject:       Re: Timing lights


&gt; I was looking at timing lights last night and didn't know which one I 
&gt; wanted.  There are inductive type and advance type.  The former is 
&gt; about $20 cheaper.  Will it work for my bus? 

the over-riding factor in selecting a timing light should be the 
brilliance of the xenon flash.  ask to have them demonstrate to see 
if they illuminate the timing marks well.  the advance type light is 
useful for checking how the distributor advances the timing with rpm. 
 it isn't essential but gives one more info.

 Finally, where do
&gt; I find copper based anti-seize for my exhaust stud nuts. 

West Marine (search archives for #) has a copper-based anti-seize.  
Also, you might just try using the aluminum colored Permatex brand 
available everywhere.  None of them are made for high heat 
applications but any residual cu or al left will help.
