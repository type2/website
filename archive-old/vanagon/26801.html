Subject: re: Cargo Hauls


I just had one of my better hauls this weekend. 

7 girls on the way home for a weekend from college (6hrs). Four brought their 
laundry to do at home, all had just &quot;one or two&quot; bags. I don't think I've 
ever seen bags that big though. They're bigger than suitcases! One small 
stereo and speakers, 1 bed comforter, a small sized fridge and an end table.

All this for just one weekend!!! (End table and fridge were just 1-way)


Another great haul...

 - 10 Mountainbikes and 8 people to one of our local riding spots.


And one of the best...

- 12 people to the Drive-in theater. The cost was $10 per carload, so I 
  just charged everybody a buck.


Just a few of the wonderful trip in my '85!
