Subject: Update: Viking Edition '84

Hi Vanagoners,

I looked at the famed 'Viking Edition' 84 Vanagon last night.  Turns out 
a coach-conversion company in South Dakota did a job on it before the 
dealer sold it.  It's a GL with blue valour (sp?) captain chairs in the 
middle and the other seats were re-upholstered the same way.  It has 
147,000 miles, but has been treated very well.  It's sort of a light 
metallic blue with bluish silver stripe panels on the side.  It had AC, 
but he still has the removed compressor .  It is diagnosed to have a 
valve problem on the stuck 1.9 Wasserboxer, but all other mechanicals 
appear to be okay (4 speed).

I decided not to pursue this, but it looks like a heckuva deal at $900 obo. 
It's in Kansas City, KS.  If anyone wants more info, drop me an email.
