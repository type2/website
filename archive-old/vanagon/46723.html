&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; My '89 Vanagon cannot seem to find the right idle speed when the engine is
&gt; cold.  This is especially true when the A/C is on.  The idle speed varies
&gt; from 500 - 1200 while the brain is trying to find the proper settings and
&gt; the engine tends to stutter or stall on acceleration.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem disappears as soon as the engine warms up.
&gt; 

Check your idle stabilizer valve and your coolant temp sensor.
