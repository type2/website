Subject: #1 firing position on 009? (2.0 l FI)


My distributor is advancing way too much on my '77 Camper. A stock 
replacement would cost $150-300 (local import parts stores). A Bosch 009 
would cost $55. Bob Hoover and others have told me that the 009 doesn't 
produce a nice power curve for Bus applications, but I'm ready to waver 
considering the price differential...

But here's the question: my friend Stefan (from the list) has a 009 in 
his '76 (I don't know if it's Bosch): on his distributor, cylinder 1 fires 
at a different position relative to my stock distributor!!!

The immediate practical siginificance is that I can't pop in his 
distributor, attach my distributor cap and drive off...

Switch the plug wires???? Sure, but then I'd have to re-adjust all my 
valves...

And anyway, if #3 fires differently from #1 (as previous posts suggest),
would that mean I'd have to change the distributor shaft 180 degrees to 
match the proper camshaft position ?????

All this, just to put in a 009 distributor???? Help!! Where does your #1 
fire on your distributor relative to the notch that fits into the 
distributor cap ???
