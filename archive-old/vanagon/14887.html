&gt; &gt; I've looked through several months of archives and find GNATT but it never 
&gt; &gt; says what it stands for - anyone know?  What is the route?  Where is more 
&gt; &gt; info on it?
&gt; 
&gt; Great North American Type II Tour

Actually it is &quot;Great North American Transporter Trek&quot; (but kudos to Steve
for getting close!).  The route, it appears, is going to start in St.
Louis at the &quot;Busses by the Arch&quot; convention on May 27th and two
contingents (at least) will head out - with main ones going West and
Northeast, one possibly Southeast.  For more info, try the folowing URL:
