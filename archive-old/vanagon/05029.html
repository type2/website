Subject: Re: RE- nicknames for generatio

&gt; In keeping with the &quot;B&quot; theme (Bulli, Bus/Bread-loaf/Bay-Window, Brick)
&gt; I'd like to toss out Barn, as in, &quot;as big as a &quot;, &quot;broad side of a&quot; etc.
&gt; Once, there were &quot;bahn-burners,&quot; now there are Barn-burners...
&gt; 
&gt; UrineVan...yeah, right!...   :-)
