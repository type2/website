Subject: Re: Re powering `82 Diesel with 1.9 Turb


&gt;Been away from the list for a while, good to be back. I'm about to re
&gt;power my `82 Westy Diesel with a 1.9L Turbo Diesel. It pretty much looks
&gt;like a drop in with a few minor changes.

Not only a few minor things, The TD is different in things you don't
think about, like the stronger crank. The cooling system will include
an additional electric water pump.

&gt;Of course, I'll still have the
&gt;old 4speed, which brings me to my real question...Is the gas 4 speed the
&gt;same gear ratio as the diesel 4 speed? As it stands, I'll probably have a
&gt;top speed of about 60-65mph, which is Ok but it'd be nice to see
&gt;75-80mph.

Will send you a gearbox-table privately, it comes up in the list too often.
Or search the archives...

&gt;Any suggestions?
