I see that there are now tool request threads going pretty strong on 
both the Vintage and Vanagon lists.  I have been saving them all.  In 
the next couple of days I hope to get them into some type of list and 
post them up for a general looking over.  So, if there is something 
that should be in every VW toolbox mail it to me directly or to the 
list and I will summarize by Thursday.  So far it sounds pretty 
complete to me with all of the sockets, pliers, screwdrivers, etc.  I 
hope it hits the top pretty soon or I will have lots of nice tools and
no money for a motor.  Jim
