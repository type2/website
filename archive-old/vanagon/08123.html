Subject: Syncro Westy Prices

     While this may not reflect reality, I compiled this list as a point of
     reference for my search, and others may find it interesting.

     From the December issue of the  Mid-Atlantic NADA &quot;Blue Book&quot; here are
     their estimates  of the current values of Syncro Westies (Camper GLs
     with Syncro option):


     YEAR               MSRP(1)       TRADE IN        RETAIL

     1991              $21730          $16050         $18525
     1990               20990           13375          17725
     1989               22235           12000          14175
     1988               21180            9200          11150
     1987               19225            7675           9500
     1986               19365(2)         6175           7825

     (1) Camper GL only: book does not list MSRP for Syncro.
     (2) Camper GL Syncro
