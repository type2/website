Subject:      VW friendly route from Baltimore, MD to San Diego, CA (long)

fellow listees,

this summer after i graduate from Gilman School in Baltimore, MD, i will be
driving out to visit my cousin in San Diego.
by that time, i will have completed my engine swappage experience.
(for those who don't know, i will be putting a chevy 2.8l v6 into my vanagon)
i was wondering what are the routes from Baltimore to San Diego.
i would like to have options, so please tell me the best route, the AAA
route, the relatively fastest route, the sightseeingish/three-billion
rolls of film per hour route, and the Vanagon Mailing List recommended route.

the two ways that i know of are these.

go to Ocean City, MD, take Rt. 50 to Sacramento(spelling?), and then take
whatever road it is that i think goes next to the Pacific Ocean all the
way down to San Diego.

take Rt. 40 out to wherever it goes in California, and then take whatever
other highway to San Diego.

as you can tell, i don't have a AAA US Atlas in front of me.

thank you for bearing with me,

sudhir desai
