Subject: 1.9L Front oil seal installation

Hello,
I am in the process of replacing a clutch in an 84 Vanagon.  Can anyone suggest
a way to install the new front oil seal?

Bently shows a nice round tool that screws down onto a plate and threaded rod
arrangement mounted where the flywheel goes.  This will squarely seat the seal.
Needless to say, I'm sure that most people don't have this tool.

What do you suggest.

Thanks in advance
