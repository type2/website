&gt;&gt; Not between dusk and dawn in Texas.  State law provides for using deadly
&gt;&gt; force to protect PROPERTY, at night, if the perpetrators are caught in 
the
&gt;&gt; act.  And the new right-to-carry law took effect recently.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You caught someone messing with your stuff?
&gt;&gt; Is it night-time?
&gt;&gt; Kill them.

&gt;&quot;Excuse me sir I broke down and I was wondering if I could use your pho...&quot; 

&gt;*BLAM* *BLAM* *BLAM*

Why was this guy breaking your car's window instead of politely knocking
on your door? Please read what the previous poster wrote.


&gt;Sounds like a damn good reason to avoid Texas.

Sounds like a damned good reason for the *criminals* to avoid Texas.
And any other state that has the good sense to allow us to safeguard
what's ours. I wish the criminals would take the hint. This was one of
the main reasons (tho not the only reason) for the 2nd Amendment. Police
can't do it all, no matter how dedicated or brave they are. Private
citizens must be allowed to defend their life, liberty, property. When
they can, total number of crimes, deaths, threats etc. go DOWN-- because
there are more private citizens than cops, and they have greater personal
interest in preventing crime.

I wouldn't shoot a guy for stealing my or my son's bicycle, which has
happened three times in the last 8 months. The V6anagon, maybe. And if
my son was there and under threat, then the guy's brains are going to
decorate the lawn. Presently, the sleaze might not even take me seriously
when I point a gun at him, 'cause there's a law against my shooting him.
But if it was legal, then he damned well would.

Sorry for the off-subject post. Feel free to reply privately.
