Correct. This is clearly the preferred method.

&gt; But in a pinch, if I had to use a tow 
&gt; bar, with all wheels on the ground, would it be O.K to just put it in
neutral, 
&gt; with the VC still connecting the front and rear wheels?  

Yes.  The drivetrain has no problems with this.

&gt; If I were to prepare for 
&gt; a trip to pull a Syncro using a tow bar (say 1000 miles), would it be 
&gt; worthwhile to disconnect the driveshaft or other normally connected drive
parts, like
&gt;  universal joints?  What would be the best method to disconnect the 
&gt; driveshafts?

Removing the driveshaft between the transmission and VC is pretty simple and
straighforward.  I think just 6 bolts at each end and it's out.  The U-joints
are attached to the driveshaft, so they'll come out with it.
