Subject: Another source for the SIlver Socket Accessories

Thanks for all the answers - I never would have thought to look in the
FAQ as the &quot;Silver Socket&quot; wasn't mentioned in the manual, so I thought
it was something the PO had installed.

A collegue of mine is a Beemer rider - and sent me this re: getting
the BMW plugs everyone mentioned as working in this socket.
Thought I'd pass it along. Don't know if you want ot add it to the FAQ or not.

As for the e-brake button - why would anyone want to turn just the e-brake
light on or off? Seems weird to me. Ah well.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all of you who responded to me request for info. regarding
&gt; obtaining BMW electrical plugs and sockets from John Deere. The parts
&gt; numbers were given to me immediately:
&gt; 
&gt; For the &quot;50&quot; series John Deere farm tractor:
&gt; 
&gt;                        Accessory Plug -- RE11344
&gt;                       Accessory Socket -- AL25073
&gt; 
&gt; I checked locally at a John Deere implement company and found plugs
&gt; for $6.59 and sockets for $3.40--both in stock. I go out tonight to
&gt; see if they are a match for BMWs' items. I suppose they'll be green!
