So Thom with-sand-wedgies Fitzpatrick says:

&gt; A family tree with no &quot;splits&quot; is definitly a bad sign.
&gt; 
&gt; Like Joel - I think his family tree only has bricks!  Does that make it a
&gt; family &quot;stump?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Steve Johnson's family tree has only recently split!

One wonders what kind of family Thom will end up with as he seems
to be finding more things to do with that sand blasting hose than
just remove rust.  ;)
