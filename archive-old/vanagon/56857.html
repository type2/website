Subject: '86 Headlight replacment?

A short while back someone posted a report of the replacement of vanagon
headlights with a non-DOT approved bulb  (I think this was a Hella 550 but
I'm not sure).  I believe this was a '85 or earlier vanagon with round
headlights.

Has anyone replaced a '86 or newer vanagon's high/low headlights with a
better performing rectangular reflector/bulb combination?  My reflectors
are in bad shape because of moisture and some 80/100 watt bulbs that
exploded (But that's another story.).

I checked the voltage on the high beams of the outer lamps at the bulb.  It
was 9.8 volts...
And this is with the inner high beam lights running on a separate relay.  I
guess relays all around are a next project.

Thanks,

Ed McLean
