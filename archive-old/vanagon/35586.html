&gt;More hiccup data here:
&gt;	Well the late winter weather here in Pittsburgh has given
&gt;me the opportunity to gather a bit more information about that 
&gt;intermittent hiccup that seems to be a problem for many Vanagons.
&gt;I am aware of the harness bandage but I really want to find the
&gt;problem instead of circumvent it.  We have been experiencing 
&gt;temperature changes in this region and I have noticed that
&gt;my 84 Vanagon will hiccup whenthe temperature is below 15 deg F.
&gt;Ant y temps above that and I don't have the problem.  
&gt;	I read an article in Electronics Now a section called
&gt;hardware hacker where a Vanagon owner had the same hiccup.  His 
&gt;journey led him to the ECU where he found that a large power
&gt;resistor on the board was loose or not soldered well.  
&gt;He repaired it and has not had the problem since.  This is also
&gt;consistent with other list members who have ventured into the
&gt;box and found &quot;cold &quot; solderd s.  
&gt;	Well would the above conditions be affected more by 
&gt;cold temperatures.  Would a connection m , that is to say, a 
&gt;poor connection, be poorer when the temperature drops.
&gt;metals shrink when they are cold.  Any thoughts or comments?

Well, both my vans have had the problem in the past, but neither has had any
symptoms in a couple of years.  I've NEVER had the problem when the
temperature was low.  Usually in 75+ deg F weather.  I have a friend with an
87 who meticulusly re-soldered the circuit board in his digifant computer and
stillthe problem.  Go figur!!

Good Luck,
