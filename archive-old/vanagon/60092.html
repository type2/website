Subject: don't want no air

O.K.,
so I bought an '84 westy with air.  I live in Wyoming where it's cool 9
mos. a year and warm the other 3.  I owned another '84 earlier without the
air and sure liked the closet space.  Question: Can I take the air
conditioner out and turn it into closet space?  Can You sell them? BTW, I
have taken the unit off of the engine.  What does it take to get it outa
the bus?  Can you find a closet door to retro fit?
My fishing waders and flies fit so nicely up there before....
thanks
johnny
