Subject:       Hose rubber

I can't stop grinnin' when I look at the subject line.  I'm far too 
civilized to take a shot at that.

Anyway, the best hose material I have ever come across comes from, 
strangely enough, the British!  Look at an OLD british bike and find 
some of the rubber hosing with that fine herringbone pattern in it.  
Even the stuff 30 years old is still pliable and in great shape.  No 
cracks on the surface and some of it in very hot locations.  I don't 
know what the composition of the stuff is but it seems incredible 
that a product could be made so well without the benefit of our 
current multi-national chemical companies :)  If you stumble across 
a roll of NOS of this stuff, grab it!  Better yet, sell it to me.
