Why you turn tighter in reverse.

When going forward all your momentum is forward so that when you turn
your tyres are wrestling with the pavement to push the van sideways
and the sideways force on the tyres distorts them a bit (tyre squirm)
allowing your van to go slightly less than the turning angle of the rims.

When in reverse your momentum is toward the rear of your van so that when
you turn and l+=DBt the nose drift off to one side it wants to spin right
around toward the direction it's moving there fore the tyre squirm
allows the van to steer further than the turning angle of the rims.

It also feels like you're turning alot harder than you are because
turning while going forwards moves the driver, you, to the inside of the
turning circle (picture it in your head, I don't do ascii art.) but when
turning in reverse you are on the outside of the turning circle so your
part of the van is moving faster (front).  Just like the outside edge
of a record is moving much faster than a point in the lable.

Get it?

I apologise if there is all sorts of shit in thei letter, I have been
having a lot of line noise lately and my cheap modem doesn't deal with
it very well.
