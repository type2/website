I was out yesterday. I'm not sure if I'm too late to be of assistance.

I have a similar fridge power-draw in my van. I draw power from a deep 
cycle battery also.

The best I've been able to get is about three and one-half days with the 
power on continuous, the thermostat kicking in and out and normal load of 
opeing/closing the unit on a summer day.
