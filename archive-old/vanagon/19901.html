Subject: Re: Coolant Hoses


This may be of interest to the Diesel people. I blew a coolant hose on my 
82 Camper Diesel about two years ago. At that time, VW told me that 
Diesel hoses are not even in stock in the U.S. :-( Fortunately, my 
brother came in from Germany a week later.
Just thought you might want to know.
