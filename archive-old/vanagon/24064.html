Subject: Survey says?  Please :)


I am a graduate student a the University of Colorado. I am doing research 
on purchasing behavior. Could you gratious VW owners help me out? I own 
an 82 Vanagon. Thanks in advance...

1) What services do you do busines with on an ongoing basis? (for 
example, grocery stores, banks, VW garages)






2) Why do you do business there? (for example; trust, consistency, 
commitment, philanthropy, empathy, status, switching costs, habit, 
convienience, etc...)







3) Why do you do business there VS some where else? (for example; check #2)







4) What products or brands do you buy on a regular basis?




5) Why do you buy this product? (for example check #2)





6) Why do you buy this product VS another product? (for example check #2)
