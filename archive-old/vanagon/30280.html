Subject: Sleeping in Campers

Hi all, 
	I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while 
going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?  Personally, I 
sleep with my head to the rear but I have to be careful not to hit my 
head on the shelf.  That's when I wondered if anyone else slept the other 
way and why.  This is assuming you'd be sleeping in the lower level 
(downstairs) of course.  Actually, now I'm curious about the upper level 
as well.  Well???
