Subject: Looking for David Sax (DSax_at_gnn_dot_com)

Hi gang:

I'm looking for a David Sax who had a tent for sale on Dworkin's Bits 
pages.  The given address (DSax_at_gnn_dot_com) is a non-user according to 
gnn.  Any clues appreciated.  David, where are ye' lad?

Muchas gracias,
Joe &quot;Tentfreak&quot; Clark

PS Tentists: got a possible line on a source of handmade tents.  
Nothing anytime soon, but will post.  We're talking months away, so 
be cool.
