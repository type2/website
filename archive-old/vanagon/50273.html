Subject: VW Fest in Mineola, MO, USA

Anyone planning to go to the 3rd Annual VW Fest in Mineola, MO this 
weekend?  I know that there is a Midwest conflict with the Tulsa, OK show 
(and now the Ft. Smith, AR show).  I have to be in KC this weekend, but 
Pete Sellers and local LiMBO rep Lance Moeller are planning to make it.  
Should be fun with Octoberfest in Hermann (17 miles from camp) happenin' 
at the same time.
