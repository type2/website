&gt;Y'all please feel free to contact the below mentioned potential source but
I called my friend in Montana who runs a VW junk yard. He said that he knows
Mike Adams (said that he's a nice guy) and chuckled when he heard that the
source was posted on the list. He said that he had already been out to
Mike's smallish yard and had previously bought most everything that he
wanted from him. &quot;Yeah, he has some stuff out there but it's not much.&quot;
&gt;I figure that he would have told me if there was anything out there as my
friend is a business man not known for walking away from a deal. Rusty is
not trying to stop anyone from calling just trying to enlighten the
situation. Happy hunting gang! (Isn't that the fun of it?)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;talked with a fellow the other day from bozeman, montana (home of dana
&gt;&gt;design backpacks for all you climber types :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;anyways said there was a fellow in town who had some barndoor parts or
&gt;&gt;whole vans??
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;he was a bit vague, but if anyone in the montanan area wants to shoot the
&gt;&gt;BS w/ him i'm sure he'd like to talk, maybe he has other type II items..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;unfortunately he is not on line so you'll have to call him the old
&gt;&gt;fashioned way ;)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;his name is mike adams and his number is (406) 222-6995. mike adams is the
&gt;&gt;owner of the vans.
