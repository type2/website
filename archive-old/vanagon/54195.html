&gt; Hi Everyone.  Well, I started up the van today in the garage, and I
&gt; put on the a/c to run the compressor.  After a few minutes, I noticed
&gt; some &quot;smoke&quot; from the one of the exhaust pipes (the back pipe that
&gt; goes left to right).  After some time, I noticed some &quot;pinkish&quot; oily
&gt; stuff on the concrete floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm.. the power steering is on the right side, and this is on the
&gt; left side.  I couldn't find any source of the leak.
&gt; 
&gt; After the engine had cooled down a bit, I crawled under the van to
&gt; inspect. The only thing that is above that exhaust pipe is the a/c
&gt; compressor.  So, if it is the a/c that is leaking, is freon or
&gt; refrigerant pink?
&gt; 
&gt; Easily puzzled,
&gt;

Freon does not exist as a liquid at ambient pressure.  The oil in the 
system does however, but is not usually colored.  Dyes are sometimes 
used for leak detection in refrigerent systems.  I suspect the pink 
fluid is transmission fluid if you have an automatic.
