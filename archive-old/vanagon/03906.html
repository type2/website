Subject: Re: Front end heat &amp; awnings

What is this
&gt;poor Richard
stuff ....?

First, let's all notice that it ashould be &quot;Pete&quot;

Secondly, While I AM poor, it's more the George Washington
University-tuition-drainer-poor than me supporting a VW 'habit'.

Thirdly, the problem I was having was that awnings WERE in existence for
the buses and vanagons but NOT for the Eurovan. The awning I ended with
was modified from the Vanagon style tp make it fit the Eurovan.

Unfortunately, I'm in travel status right now so I don't have the
information with me about the awning, that's why I did not respond to the
original message.  I did post notes all about it before and they should be
around somewhere.  I remember the name was something about &quot;Freedom&quot; and
the firm was based in Colorado.

I surmise any reputable RV dealer, with a catalog, will have information
about it (they generally don't get many requests so they may not remember
unless pressed to search).

If this won't do much good post another message to me and I'll dig out the
information when I get home or have the family pull it out for me.

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
