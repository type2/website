Bill, 

Yea it has the dual A/C thing, does not have the CD Changer, I don't have 
any kids, just want to protect the carpet.

You just reminded me, I gotta start looking for a hitch.  Do you think 
the u-haul one is better or about the same as a VW one.  U-haul does have 
one don't they?

Trace

&gt; &gt; Pretty much your standard MV
&gt; &gt; It has all the curtians, both sliding windows, std wheels, auto trans, 
&gt; &gt; 36k miles, and is what I believe they call Perl Red (Dark Red/Burgandy)
&gt; 
&gt; Dual A/C-heat? (Don't think I've seen and MV with out this - but I've 
&gt; seen CLs w/o)
&gt; CD Changer? (I've never known anyone to have one of these - curious to 
&gt; how convinient it really is)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It ran me 15,800, the dealer has to replace one broken cup holder, and 
&gt; &gt; the evaporator canister for the A/C, also got them to throw in a Bentley's.
&gt; &gt; It's the best van I've found in the area at the best price.  The next 
&gt; &gt; cheapest MV I've found was 17,400 and a GL for 15,700.  If anybody is 
&gt; &gt; looking for a Eurovan in FL let me know, I can point you to a few.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a pretty good deal. One of cup holders broke and the 
&gt; replacement was not identical but looked a little stronger.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anybody know if VW makes a floormat for the rear and how much is cost?
&gt; 
&gt; Front and rear floormats for an MV should run about $90 each - not what 
&gt; you'd call cheap.  I just ordered mine.  Was going to post when I got 
&gt; them.  I recommend them if you have kids I think - better working 
&gt; knowledge when I get them. (And I'll put what I paid.  I'm going to 
&gt; recommend the dealer publicly.  Priced parts 
&gt; at several local dealers and there were much cheaper and more helpful 
&gt; than the others - Ray Burnette in Alexandria Virginia.  Got a Class II 
&gt; hitch from them and installed it over the weekend.  I'll have to post 
&gt; that story - ran into a few 'surprises'.  Lucky I have the hitch since I 
&gt; now have to two a Thing home from Pennsylvania (see comments on VintagVW 
&gt; and Thing lists)
