Subject: '72 hard starting hot

Volks,

        Yeah, got my '72 inspected today, so I am legal on the roads.  A
problem did crop up, however, today.  I can start the engine when cold very
easily, but when hot, it is slow and &quot;lumpy&quot; turning over.  I backed off the
timing and it seemed a little happier turning, but by then I think the
battery was tired.
        -  Is this some dire indication that the &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine is not well?  
        - Could this be a problem with a suspicious positive cable
connection at the battery? 
        - Is this common with the starter?

TIA

Chris Vaughn
