Subject: '66 Bus For Sale

From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

Ok, here's the deal:

	My buddy Shea has a '66 walk-thru camper for sale.  Something is
wrong with the motor, as of yesterday, and he is tired of messing with
it and is low on cash.  He needs to sell it soon, and he's asking $600
&quot;or so.&quot;

	The motor is fairly new, but isn't running right.

	Mail me here if you are interested.

Thom
