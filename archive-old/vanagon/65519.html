Subject:      windshield installed

Hey all,
Slicker than snot, that's how the new windshield went in this morning.

Actually, it went disturbingly well.

Pushed the old one out, intensifying the stress cracks big time (&quot;who
cares??? It's going in the trash anyway&quot;)

Saved the seal, fitted it to the new windshield.

Found some nasty-lookin' rust in the bottom of the windshield frame, not
too happy about that at all :-(

Ran some soapy goo around the channel in the seal, then laid the string,
held the windshield up and it zipped right in.  Had a tough time on the
upper corners, but still quite simple.

Made sure it was seated in the opening, then broke out the Windex to
clean it up.

Drove the old windshield to the dumpster, then said &quot;cool!&quot; as it hit
the bottom -- quite neat to watch :-)  -- hope my head never does that
to the windshield :-(

It's looking good, and the van is happier now that the windshield has
the VW/Audi logo on it :-)

Sean
