Subject: re: Alaska Trip

i'm thinking about doing an alaksan trip this summer...been talking to a fella
here who has done it twice...one of the main things he recommends is chicken
wire over the headlights...maybe even over the windshield. see, alot of the
roads to alaska are dirt...and you have tractor trailers that go as fast as
they can, and there are rocks you see...and being 500 miles from anything will
make you appreciate having working headlights. and extra gas. and 2 spare
tires.
