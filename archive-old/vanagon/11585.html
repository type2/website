&gt;  a $1730 doorstop in the form of a dead Viscous Coupling.
&gt; --
Hi Al.  Just curious as to why the viscous coupler went on the 
Syncro.  I must have missed something on the thread about this.  I 
also have a Syncro, but with half the mileage on it (112000 km).  
What failing signs did it give?  Do you know if it contains synthetic 
fluid or regular gearoil?   Bentley says it could contain either, but 
doesn't state what the factory installs (or I missed that, too!).  Have
you ever changed the fluid in the coupler prior to this failure?

I change the tranmission fluid in all my other vehicles (past and 
present), but never have in my Westy.  My dealer said it would cost 
over $250 to do the transmission and coupler.  So, I left it.  Any 
recommendations?

Thanks,
Harry.
