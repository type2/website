&gt; &gt;A similar problem exists with the hood shocks on the 911.  A popular 
&gt; solution
&gt; &gt;is to install 2 sets of shocks, ala off road race cars (yeah, I can see
&gt; &gt;coil-overs on your hatch with 28&quot; of travel!)
&gt; 
&gt; Guys, they're just worn out. Like, losing their compressed-gas charge,
&gt; you know? Replace them, and you'll live happily ever after. Or, at
&gt; least, until the new ones wear out in five years or whatever.

But you see, the idea is to install 2 new sets, but they'll last a lot longer!
I didn't mean just add another worn out set!

THis has been proven to work with the 911 hood problem!
