Subject: '81 2.0L AFC &quot;thermostat&quot;

I bought a new thermostat today; mine is indeed defective, as some
list folk suggested!  Thanks!  Got a kick out of the box... it says:

* Clean all sealing surfaces thoroughly
* Fill up with coolant with engine running
* Check thread, hose, clamps and radiator cap for leaks

Uh oh.... :)
