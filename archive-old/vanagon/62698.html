Yeah, I'd like this answer, too.  I had been under the impression that
it was the *rear* shafts that were longer, and the rear trailing arms
were longer.  Thus, the wheelbase would be increased with the rear wheels
set back slightly to clear the trailing arms.

I, too, was told that the height was soley due to the larger wheels.
