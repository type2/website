&gt; Just one more:  is this vehicle underpowered or does the engine have enough

Count me as one more EV owner who is tired of hearing people call the EV 
underpowered.  Towed my VW thing just hunky-dory fine.  Loads up with 
hundreds of pounds of ferret food and other supplies.  Keeps up with 
traffic in Chicago and DC.  Underpowered?  No way.
