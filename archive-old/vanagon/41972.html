Subject: muffler nuts and engine stand question

Hello all,
	There's a bad exhaust smell (and exhaust smoke) that enters
the cabin via the heater/defroster vents.  The vents are ducttaped
shut to keep this bad stuff out for now.  The problem I believe is
that the place where the heat exchanger connects to the muffler is
shot.  The heat exchanger also does not connect very well to the
accordian muffler thing either.  There is lots of rust on the muffler,
but no holes I could find.  So my intended plan is to get some
gaskets: (2) for where the heat exchanger meets the muffler, and (4)
where the exhaust runs into the heat exchanger, and whatever helps
seal the heat exchanger to the accordians.  This weekend I'll take off
the muffler and heat exchangers,  see how bad they are, and hopefully
clean them up and paint them and reinstall them with new gaskets.

Anyway, my question is I have been following a bit the muffler talk
and read some things in the archives and see where people talk about
cutting the bolts/nuts when removing the muffler, or using a nut
cracker.  Is everyone talking about the 6 nuts that lock the muffler
onto the heat exchangers?  Anyone know if the RMMW muffler
installation kit contains 6 new (good) nuts?

And last week I picked up an (almost) brand new engine stand from
someone cleaning out their garage:)  Its one of those ones that has an
&quot;I&quot; shaped base on four little wheel, with a bar coming up at one end,
that allows you attatch a flate metal plate to the top.  This flat
metal plate has four adjustable/moveable places to insert large
screws.  I am guessing that is where you attatch the motor?  I've
never seen an engine stand or a motor out of the bus before so that
may seem like a silly question:) 

Thanks all:)  hope everyone is having a happy Monday (and a happy
mother's day to all the mothers (of children) out there:)

take care,
	brandy
