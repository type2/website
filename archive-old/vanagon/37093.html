Subject: Tires

Yesterday I replaced the grabbag of tires on the 81 camper with a set of
Continentals in the correct 185r14 with reinforced sidewall. Price was $350
out the door which was probably $100 more than I wanted to spend but about
$75 less than the comparable Michelins. BTW, one dealer told me that the
Michelin was available only as a &quot;consumer replacement&quot; meaning that they
didn't want to sell a set, only singles!

The handling difference is really amazing. A lot of the &quot;sway&quot; that I thought
was inherent in a van was corrected by the Conti's. Big difference.]

The dealer reminded me that I didn't have a bolt securing the spare tire
carrier. Does anyone know what the proper size bolt would be so I can pick
one up?

Thamks,

Weston
