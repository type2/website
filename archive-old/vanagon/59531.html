Subject: Should I buy

Hello sages of VW-

Please help me with advice/warnings about the possibly impending purchase of either an 83 with 120000 miles or an 85 with 84000 miles. 

1) the 83 is offered at 1500. How does this price seem?

2) &quot;  85 &quot; &quot; 2500. How about this?

3) is the 83 on its last legs? What mileage has been reported for these air cooled models? How about the water cooler, what is its reasonable life expectancy?

Any advice or anecdotal evidence will be immensely appreciated. 

Thanks

Rio
