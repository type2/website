To remove these beasties on the Vanagon was a three person job, after I found
three people it went quickly.

One person to get inside of the car and stand on the brakes, to keep the van
from movin'

Second person to hold tension on end of 7 foot cheater pipe on end of
craftsman 3/4 inch breaker bar (just to the point of bending the bar at the
socket, I would have the person pull until it bent a little and hold it).

The third person (me) would beat on the breaker bar/cheater pipe combo right
by the socket with a 10 lb hammer.  One or two good whacks was all it took
with the right tension on the nut.

I bent the shit out of the breaker bar before flipping it over and bending
it straight again.  Then I thought of the hammer idea, and voila, it
worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!
