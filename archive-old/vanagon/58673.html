Subject: Re: bought 97 ev sell 86westie!

IN the new Eurovan, the rear passenger seat is molded, which equates with
comfort for passengers riding, but does not create a great sleeping surface
(ridges and bumps). So what has Winnebago (Bag-a-Wino) done to rectify this
situation?

There is a very thin (about 3/4 inch) mattress that unfolds from the back
area and *SNAPS TO THE SEAT AND BACK area* to attempt to flatten out the
ridges. I personally tried this out, and found it cumbersome, ungainly in
appearance, and extremely uncomfortable!

Perhaps it might be good for someone who doesn't toss and turn, but with
about 8 small diameter snaps to snap the top mattress to the rear seat
bench, I have a feeling that this feature may not be popular with many
Volks. (The snaps are about the same diameter as on your rear hatch
screen.)

Also, the rear area is &quot;slotted,&quot; ostensibly to allow moving larger sheets
of plywood, or furniture, so the &quot;top mattress&quot; covers this area and the
spacer piece that covers it. ...Seem to me --lots of pieces to get lost
over the years!

The rear closet has a sliding door, which is a good thought, however, the
sliding door on the vehicle I examined was made of cheap mortarboard, (sort
of like thin wall panelling). It did not slide easliy, and looked as though
the last person had popped it out of its track.

My 2 cents!

&gt;&gt; differences between the two some bad some good In all honesty I would
&gt;&gt; say the westie version camper is better thought out almost like one
&gt;&gt; designer went camping and the the other didnt...
&gt;
&gt;        Could you give some examples?  I have to believe that the Winnebago
&gt;designers have done some camping.  Is it a difference between European and
&gt;American camping?  I keep hearing on this list that Westfalia conversions
&gt;are better than the Winnebago, but I haven't seen any specific examples.
&gt;
&gt;Thanx.
