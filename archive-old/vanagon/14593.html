Just a FYI on Friday afternoon.  I ordered a Snap-On catalog a week 
ago and have been pouring over it since.  It costs $5 but you get that
off on the first purchase.  I was scared at first but later found that
many of their tools are not that much more than Craftsman.  At least 
it seems that way from the price of some of their adjustable wrenches 
and pliers and stuff.  This catalog has everything.  You say your 
torque wrench has come out of spec and you want to check it out.  No 
problem: for $72,000 they have a little machine to do it.  Want to 
align your front end?  For about $6,000 and change, and a hoist you 
are in business.  Want to work on the valves on your DC-10 or 747?  No
problem, they have the tools you need.  On the up side, they have $2 
fuse pullers, neat little grease guns and EVERYTHING else you might 
need.  Just give them a call at 800-866-5748.  It took me a 
couple of days to talk to a human to get the catalog.  This can be 
avoided if you feel ok reading your Visa number to a machine.  Usual 
diclaimers apply.  Enjoy.  Jim
