&gt; I like king-pins.  You can keep a king-pin front end going forever with only
&gt; a couple of tools.  Ball-joints, you're dependent on someone to make the
&gt; joints even if you do the installation.  With king-pins, you can do it all
&gt; yourself.  But the link-pins need to be adjusted every second oil change.  It
&gt; only takes a couple of minutes but it's obvious the adjustment hadn't been
&gt; made to Grendel in years, which is why the link-pin bearings failed.

How do you adjust them?  I never knew they could be adjusted...  That would
prolly explain why my front end behaved differently after I greased it!

Also, this is going to sound like a silly question, but what is the difference
between link ping and king pin suspensions?  Or is there any?
