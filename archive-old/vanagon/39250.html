Subject:  Re: Checking out new Winnebago EV's

&gt;
&gt;Can't speak to the deal for your Westy, but I just got a 5-speed '95 (with
&gt;furnace;without ABS) for $29K plus tax and license. This included the
&gt;awning and
&gt;the rear-hatch add-a-room options. You can probably go lower; I decided to give
&gt;my business to the people who treated me decently and made the experience a
&gt;pleasant one, low-price be damned.....
&gt;

Congratulations! Sounds pretty reasonable.  You'll be glad you got the
furnace. I'm curious as to just how that rear hatch tent works. the picture
in the manual didn't show much. Does it have a floor? Does it stick out
past the door? Does it ride on top of the door?
Also, if you got the standard EuroVan awning, watch out for the rivets at
the central hinge - if they're loose the metal is soft enough to catch and
bend. I just did this - it still works fine but it needs to be handled
carefully when folding it up.
