Subject:      Re: '84 Westfalia Starting Problem

I had the same problem with my '90 Crewcab.  After some time and effort
the fault was traced to a temperature sensitive piece of electronic
stuff in the distributor.  I had to put a new dizzie in ($$$$$$$$) and
that solved the problem!

&gt; &quot;84 Westfalia water-cooled has &quot;intermittent&quot; starting problem after
&gt; driving
&gt; in town or on highway. When attempting to start after driving, there will
&gt; be a momentary engine firing and then no ignition. The motor will turn over
&gt; without starting. Additional attempts to start only flood the motor. Let
&gt; the van sit for 30 min. to 2 hours and it starts slowly. Cold starts are
&gt; always instantly successful. Two local VW mechanics have given it there
&gt; best efforts with no success. At this point, I don't find a pattern in this
&gt; intermittent problem. It's is very frustrating because I never know if the
&gt; van will start. For example, if I kill it at a stop sign... Thanks for your
&gt; suggestions.
