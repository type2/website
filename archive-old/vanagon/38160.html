Subject: alternator bolt

Ok, this should be an easy question for some of you - 

The bolt that I would use to tighten the alternator belt seems to be 
frozen.  I don't want to strip it any further, so do any of you have some 
ideas on how to loosen it??  I've only owned the bus since last summer, 
and I haven't changed the belt yet.  Also, where do you place a bar to 
keep the alternator in place when tightening the bolt??  I've done this 
on other cars, but it would be nice to know ahead of time here.  

Thanks for the help.
