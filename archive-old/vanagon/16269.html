Subject:       Re: SW BC (W WA?) Pizza!!

There is an EXCELLENT pizza place in Burnaby on Canada Way near 
Boundary.  It is called Coaches Corner.  It is a family run operation 
and their food and service is EXCELLENT :)  Custom order, you name 
it.  Plenty of parking, and very accomodating.

I work near hear as well, and sometimes on night shift we grab a 
pizza for dinner.


As far as dates go, I work 2 weeks days, 2 weeks night, and 1 
Saturday in 4.  Confused?  So am I:)  

Would this be for more of a weeknight get together or a weekend?

Harry.
