My mistix ticket/reservation/confirmation arrived in yesterday's mail,
so the ball is rolling.  I think I noted on there something about
calling the park if you plan to arrive AFTER 2 p.m. on Friday,
in order for them to hold your space.  Probably there won't be
a crowding problem at this time of year, but I plan to call just in
case.

I've heard from ONE person signing up for Friday night's potluck.
Do the rest of you plan to stave?  :)
