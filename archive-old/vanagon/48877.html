Subject: Re: Which Oil Filter??

&gt;Volks Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Well time has come for the first oil change in the new Vanagon.  I heard a
&gt;lot of &quot;Don't use Fram filters&quot; while lurking on the list earlier.  The
&gt;question is what brand can I use?  Is &quot;Genuine VW&quot; the only way to go or is
&gt;there something else I can use?  All help appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;-Dan

I've been using Fram for years and have never had a problem.  A few years
ago Consumers Reports rated them Very Highly and I've used that as my guide
for their use.

So what have been the reported problems with Fram? Why shouldn't one use it?

James
