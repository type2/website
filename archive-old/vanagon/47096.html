I attended the Vintage VW show in Seattle today, lots of buses, lots of 
fun. Talked to a gentleman with an 88 syncro crewcab. It was the Tristar 
model, which I'd never heard of, but apparently it included four doors 
instead of three, a deluxe interior with a cooler between the rear seats, 
A/C, and other niceties. It was also a Wolfsburg edition. He said it was 
one of three imported into North America (Ottawa, Canada) as a trial to see 
if they would sell. It was marketed as a &quot;Hunter's Special.&quot; He was able to 
import it into the US pretty easily because the engine was CA emissions 
approved. There's just something about those crew cabs that makes me 
salivate!
