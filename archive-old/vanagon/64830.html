&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I also have a 97 EV Camper and you have me a little concerned about t=
he
need to improve to water proofing of the pop top canvas. Am I to assume
that your experience is that it doesnt keep out the weather? or are you
just being extra carfull?

Dave,

You don't need to be carefull...  you'll just get wet.  Anyways, my
experience is the canvas does soak through in what I would call a moderat=
e
amount of rain.  Its just a &quot;water repellant&quot; treated canvas.  If the rai=
n
is being driven by the wind you can accually feel the water come through
the sides.

One of my ideas is to use two layers of a rubber treated nylon  with an
insulation blanket between them.  My goal is to have something to cut out=

the weather and wind and also to help retain heat inside the van.  I'm
looking for something that can stop the rain, but I am also planning on
camping in Idaho and Montana this winter.   So I would like to retain as
much heat as possible with the top up.

Enjoy,

Christopher Quijano
