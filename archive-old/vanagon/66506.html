&gt;Jack,

  What plugs did you use?

  If you used Platinums that's the direction I'd go after.

   In the years that I've been servicing VW's I've Always stayed away
from those plugs.  I like the Bosch Supers.  They seem to be a better
plug.  I'm sure that I may take some heat on this topic, but I CAN'T
count how many running problems have been fixed by REMOVING the Platinum
plugs in a customers car and installing the correct heat range Super in
the vehicle.

  My $00.02

  Kyle
