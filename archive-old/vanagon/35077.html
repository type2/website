Mike,

&quot;...lifted tail door to take a look and it died.&quot;

Apparently something having to do with the position of the 'tail door' is
causing the problem.

&quot;It has been going on like this for 9 days..&quot;

So wire around it.

Get a handful of 1/4&quot; male spade-lug terminals and make up a new ignition
harness.  That means a lead to each carb.  At the right carb, branch the lead
to the electromagnetic fuel shut-off solenoid and to the choke.  Make sure
the wire doesn't foul the  throttle linkage.    At the left carb branch the
lead to the choke, electromagnetic fuel solenoid and the idle shut-off
solenoid -- three leads, now in common with the lead running over to the
right carb.  Bring the lead up to the coil and install another terminal for
the + connector.  Disconnect everything else (one is the hot lead, the other
is the back-up light lead.  Tape the hot lead, sounds as if it has shorted to
ground).  Make up a new hot lead going directly to the battery.  When you
touch the lead to the battery you will hear the solenoids on the carbs click.
 

Okay, that's your hot side.  Now make up the switched side.  Disconnect
everything from the - coil terminal, make sure they are clean and re-connect
only the green lead from the distributor.  You now have a complete and
functional ignition system.

Your coil must me securely mounted.  

Current flows thru the coil when the points are closed.  You can confirm this
by hooking up your STATIC timing light between the - terminal on the coil and
the green lead to the distributor.  In other words, disconnect the green lead
from the coil and insert your static timing light in the circuit.  Points
closed, light is on, points open, light is off.  Use the light to confirm
your static timing.  Then reconnect the green lead to the coil and put your
static timing light away.

With power to the + terminal of the coil, the engine will now start.  But
there's no way in hell you're going to get it to run very well tuning it by
ear.  The idle circuit is in the left-hand carb.  Dick around with it to get
a decent idle.  The little screw adjusts the mixture, the big screw the
balance.  Once the meter sez the mixture is right, focus on proper balance.  

That's it; you've done all you can do without proper tools, which inlcudes
some means of balancing the carbs by reference to the vacuum drop across
their throats. 

To synchronize or balance the carbs,  you leave the idle circuit alone,
isolate the carbs and use a vacuum gauge or air-flow indicator to establish a
baseline on one of the carbs, then move to the other carb and make it the
same.  To isolate the carbs you must disconnect the brake booster line and
plug the ports in the manifold.  The line serves as a balance tube between
the carbs.

That covers air-flow.  You must also monitor fuel/air ratio which you do by
inserting an oxygen sensor into the tailpipe.  Since the tail pipe is common
to both carbs there will be interaction between the readings and the
adjustments.  You must work back and forth until you have the proper O2/CO2
(depends on what instrument you're using) AND identical air-flow/vacuum drop
across the carbs.

Okay, you've cobbled us some instrumentation and now it's running pretty
good.  Now you have to adjust the accelerator pump output so both carbs get
the same amount of fuel as the throttle opens.  Early carbs have a cotter
pin, three possible adjustments.  Later carbs have a threaded shaft, infinate
range of adjustments.  Leave one carb alone and adjust the other as needed.
 If it doesn't die when you blip it and accelerates without hesitation, it's
probably close enough.  If it flats or dies on a blip, give it a little more
juice then go back and adjust the other to match.  But the -009 is going to
make things worse.  The mechanical advance isn't responsive enough.  Go back
to the vacuum/centrifugal; it should accelerate a lot smoother, be more
responsive coming off idle.

Now things appear to be as good they can possibly get.  So reconnect the
brake booster.  With the balance line back in the circuit there will be some
small change.  If blipping the throttle shows no problems, it's probably
close enough, otherwise examine the throttle linkage and see if one carb is
coming in a little earlier or later.  Don't mess with the carbs themselves,
focus on the linkage.

That's about as much as you can do.

Dig into your wiring and find the dud circuit.  It's probably in the coil's
grounding lead.  There's a useless wire from the coil's minus terminal to the
computer test socket that may have grounded over by the right side of the
rear hatch.  Leave the wire disconnected but definitely track down the
original cause of the problem, you may have other circuits involved.

Bottom line:  The unusual idle circuit and large-volume balance circuit on
the T4-dual carb set-up, it apperars impossible to tune the things by ear.
 You need some instrumentation to provide quantified feedback as you make the
adjustments.

To the List:
Other T4-dual carb users please follow me through on this, tell me were I've
gone.  I'm still learning my way around these Type IV's.  I saw the problem
as having three carbs, left, right and common, and three ranges, idle,
transition and open-throttle, plus the linkage on the one I worked with was
pretty badly worn, with lots of slop.  The dual carb setup is an interesting
arrangement but with so many different circuits I've a hunch it's going to
need a lot of tweaking to keep it running smoothly.
