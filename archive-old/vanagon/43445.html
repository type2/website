Subject: propane consumption rates ('84)?

I am trying to estimate propane burn rates for our &quot;new&quot; 
'84 Westy.  It has the type 113.1 stove (or &quot;range
counter unit&quot;) and the RM182B fridge.  Neither manual tells
how much propane the thing burns per hour (the fridge manual
at least gives electrical power RQ).  Anyone know?

Also, when I tried to fill up on propane in central BC
two weeks ago, the attendant at the gas station told me
there was a special technique required for Westies (not
in the manual or the instructions on the tank), which
only the owner knew.  ???????

Thanks.
