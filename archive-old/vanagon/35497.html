Subject: Re: VW parts on CD-ROM


Quoth Bob Hufford:

&gt;I read that Auto Zone bought Alldata.  How does that bode for the
&gt;availability of the CDs to the general public (if Auto Zone is using this
&gt;as a competitive advantage)?  Thom?  Anyone?

According to the paper here (Memphis is World Kahuna Headquarters for Auto
Zone) they're going to bring computers with CD-ROM drives into all the
stores so you can play with any Alldata disk you like. Lots of verbiage
about empowerment for the do-it-your-selfer.

There was an emphasis on late-model heavily computerized cars; &quot;Many people
are under the impression that these cars are difficult to work on, and
that's not the case; if you know what's wrong, they're actually easier to
work on.&quot; That's not an actual quote, but it's very close.

Probably they see their market being whittled away as maintenance intervals
grow longer and mechanics become more technical and specialized. Modern
cars *are* intimidating, and apparently Auto Zone thinks this is a way to
give owners diagnostic information so they will feel confident enough to
buy parts and install them, rather than turning the car over to men with
uniforms.

I think this is all very, very good. Auto Zone could definitely invest a
little in training its counter people, who have a tendency to be dunces,
but it's still good. CDs endure where clerks fail.

ps, those of you who have not written email to Alldata to encourage them to
make CDs for aircooled VWs (I know that at this point you're writhing with
guilt) may send to: jonah_at_alldata_dot_com
