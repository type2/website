Subject: Re:  heated window washer fluid ... a question


Well,  I used it for years in all kinds of climates (even Buffalo NY,
snow capitol of the USA), and no broken windoze.  My brain remembers
that the target temp coming out of the jets was about 150 degrees F.

It was hot enuf to steam, but not THAT hot.  The gizmo also had a valve
that would cause the fluid to recirc from the exchanger back into the
the tank - some boiling was going on here.  The tank temp would rise after
a while making it a little warmer.

 &gt;a thought has crossed my brain concerning this:
 &gt;
 &gt;if you get the fluid toooo hot, wouldn't you be risking shattering the
 &gt;windshield/windscreen in the dead of winter? like when the hot fluid hits
 &gt;the frozen cold glass?
 &gt;
 &gt;how hot is enough to soften bugs and melt the ice, but not enough to cause
 &gt;some sort of severe stress in the glass?  the reason i thunk of it was that
 &gt;the temperature of the coolant is gonna be up over 200 degrees F, wouldn't
 &gt;you think? that seems pretty darn hot enough to shatter very cold glass to
 &gt;me.
