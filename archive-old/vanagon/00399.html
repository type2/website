&gt; A very professional job could have been done with the right equipment

&gt; not to have it done the right way. So be it. I agree, if you're not
&gt; going to do it right, just treat the thing with rust remover and then
&gt; fiberglass it. But that doesn't mean that welding new panels in is
&gt; necessarily a disaster. You just have to know what you're doing.

Well... I kinda got the feeling that he didn't want to spend $200-250 for 
the profesional.  As nor would I.  I just have a piece of 3/4 inch 
plywood.  And that's all I need unless I want to (or can afford to) do a 
full restoration.  The battery tray is not what I consider a critical 
component, and at this time, I wouldn't even spend $45 for the sheet 
metal.   But then... I really do need to spend $150 for a crankset 
for my bike. :)
