&gt; get yours. Anyway, please let me know.

I haven't ordered one.  Gee. It would be fun to have one, but I'm not 
sure .... $15 will probably buy me an engine seal :-(  
My clutch is going out again.

Guess I could tell the list if they don't send rpalmer $15 for me I'll 
just shut the list down.  &lt;big grin&gt;.  &lt;gleeful evil laugh&gt;
