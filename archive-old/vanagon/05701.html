Here is to how to get your highbeams to work, even when your lights are
off, as you would do to wave at other busses without having to open your
windows on a chilly day:

1) Disconnect the battery ground strap.
2) Remove light switch in dashboard. (Simply unscrew light switch knob and
etcutcheon.)
3) Disconnect white and black wire from terminal 56 and connect it to
terminal X (with the black and yellow wire).
4) Remove fuse box. Disconnect the short yellow wire from fuses 3 and 4.
(the wire's other end goes to terminal 56b of the dimmer relay.) Insulate
the loose end with tape.
5) With a new wire (heavy gauge), connect fuses 3 and 4 to terminal 56 on the
light switch.
6) Reinstall light switch, fuse box, and battery ground strap. TADAA!

This procedure worked for my 75 Bus. I guess it should be the same for
other years, but I don't know. Credit goes to Dick Crawford, my
father-in-law, who figured out the trick from reading the current-flow
diagram in Bentley.
