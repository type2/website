Subject: Type IV oil cooler

Well,
        I am re-assembling my Type IV for my the '72.  One of the problems
that prompted the removal was that the oil cooler started leaking.  My
assumption was that the seals were the culprit, but just to be sure, I tried
the cooler itself.  Woe is me, it is leaking.  Does anyone have any
experience having these fixed?  Can a radiator shop handle this?  How much
does a new one cost?  How about a used one?  Can't go any further without
it, I guess.  HELP?!?
