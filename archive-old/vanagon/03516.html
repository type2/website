Joel in response to one of your misc ramblings. We checked out a diesel
that had been converted to gas. In as few words as possible - what a mess
and I
am glad we didn't buy it - a number of things had to be moved to make way
for the engine components and the darn thing would not start. It turns
out the guy who did buy had it blow up on him only a few weeks after (it
was posted on rec.autos.vw). --  Better that you put in wasserboxer or
aircooled engine....or....

Stay with the diesel even if your marriage is on the line! - DC
