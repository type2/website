&gt;Subject: new way to heat food while camping
&gt;Message-ID: &lt;199601161721.JAA21578_at_netcom10_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This weekend, I happened into a store on the Sacramento River delta which
&gt;carried a product (and I bought one just so I could report to all of you) I'd
&gt;never seen before.  It's made by a company called &quot;HeaterMeals, Inc.,&quot; in
&gt;Cincinnati, OH (1.800.503.4483) and is essentially a pre-made meal in
&gt;a box, but with a self contained, disposable heating unit accompanying it.
&gt;
&gt;The meals seem to come in a variety of flavors; I chose chili for no particular
&gt;reason.  Mind you, I wasn't into eating the thing, but VERY curious as to
&gt;how the self-contained heater/stove would work.  Anyway, I still haven't
&gt;eaten it, and may never, for the same reason.  Here's how it works:
&gt;
&gt;Inside the box, there's a food heater made of salt, iron, and magnesium.
&gt;When water is added, it becomes salt water.  This causes the iron and
&gt;magnesium to produce heat....and heat the meal.  Basically, you open the
&gt;included water pouch, pour the water on the food heater (which looks
&gt;like a bag of iron filings).  You repackage the food and it's surroundings,
&gt;put it back into the carton, and close the tab for 14 minutes, and
&gt;viola - a hot meal!

&gt;How hard would this be to make?  Anyone out there a chemist-guru and know
&gt;the proportions?  Pros?  Cons?
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Btw, the price of this was about $5, but I assume it could be had for cheaper
&gt;if not bought in the type of store I happened on.  

Interestingly enough, the military alternative, the MRE (Meal, Ready to Eat)
is also similarly equipt with a &quot;heater&quot; which is identical to the one described
above.  Not all individually packaged MREs have heaters, and therefore one can
actually find whole cases of just the heaters sometimes.  

It too is in a thick plastic envelope of sorts, with an aluminium foil/cardboard
radiator contained therein, along with the magnesium/salt etc., After you
&quot;activate&quot;
the contents with water, you slide your MRE entree (also in a thick plastic/foil
envelope) in and let it bake.   

These heaters are much sought after by Army Sergeants who are known to hoard
such
things.  I've managed to get them to work satisfactorily, though they get _VERY_
hot and I usually end up spilling the boiling chemical contents trying to
extract
my dinner.

Also, people are known to dump the contents of such heaters into plastic
bottles,
add water and screw the cap down.  After about 2 minutes it explodes, sounding
about as loud as a grenade.  Not that I've done it, personally (!)

FWIW,
