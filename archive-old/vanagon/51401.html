:that every car I own is a VW with Nazi roots, but if I was in Germany
:50 years ago I could've been condemned to slave labor and made to work
:to death.

Well James, judging from the response so far, I think it is safe to
say that you have definitely touched a nerve here. However I have to
point out that fifty years ago was 1946, the war was over by then and
the only people who were hiring were the U.S. authorities in charge of
the occupation. Not exactly slave labor and no way, being Americans, 
they would have worked you to death, but I get the idea that you are
driving at. High marks for social consciousness, C minus otherwise.

Anal retentively yours,

 May your wishes all come true,

 And let others do for you.&quot;
