Subject: Re: Towing a bus

does anybody out there have or know where to get a front beam tow bar for 
a early bus.  it would be similar to the bug ones comertially available.  
they do not fit a early bus w/o major modifications.  if anyone has or 
knows where to get one please let me know.

also, if anyone has the tools to modify a bug unit, i have the specs that 
need to be meet, but not the tools.  email me and maybe you could help me 
make one.

thanks and God Bless
matt
