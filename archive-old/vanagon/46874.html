Subject: Re: while we're on the coolant subject



&gt;2) The only phosphate free coolant (NON-vw) near me is a brand 
&gt;call Sierra.  Is this acceptable for VWs AND if so, can it be 
&gt;mixed with the Autobahn brand?
&gt;
&gt;
Prestone makes a phosphate free version - I think it's called 5/50, 
or something like that?  Saw it in Pep Boys.  Reasonably priced.
