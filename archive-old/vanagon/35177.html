Subject: More '70 door-lock thoughts...

	After cleaning and oiling the passenger side mechanism, It WAS 
less 'sticky', but actual operation was no different than it had been before.

	Manipulating the tab the trigger presses on, on the other
hand, seemed to make the passenger side closer to what I wanted. I
couldn't seem to get it to work correctly, but when I started it
wouldn't OPERATE from the outside at all, after a locking/unlocking
cycle... Now it does as long as the trigger hasn't been pressed. 
	
	This is a mystery, since the locking action notionally moves the 
trigger contact away from the trigger... maybe what I need to do is 
analyze why it isn't 'locking' as well as it should- that is, disconnecting 
the mechanism from the trigger. 

	I was thinking of using heavy-duty grease but there would be 
temperature problems. Other than Lubriplate and WD-40, what do listmembers
use for thier lock mechanisms?

	There exists the possibility that the little operating arm
on the lock cylinder needs to be rotated 180 degrees from where it
is now. I'm going to try that too, though the as-bought handles and
the new ones are all set up the same. 

	Its possible that the mechanism is simply worn out. I find this
somewhat diffiuclt to accept for the passenger side, though it could
be true of the driver's side. Has anyone on this list had a door lock
mechanism (The latch &amp; stuff INSIDE the door) wear out on a bay-window,
or any other bus/VW product?

	Cheers!
	Bill
