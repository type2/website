Subject: Re:My bus parts Stolen!!

Ron, relating an unfortunate, ugly tale of woe said:

&gt;Anyway, on the outside chance that anyone here on the east coast 
&gt;hears of someone who suddenly came into a ton of splittie parts to 
&gt;sell, under unknown circumstances, please let me know.

Very sorry to hear about this one, Ron. 

If they took body parts, what were the colors? If we knew to be on the 
lookout for, say, sealing wax red corner panels, that might be the clue 
that brings a whole vendor's pile of stuff into question.
