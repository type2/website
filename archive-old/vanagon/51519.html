Subject: 1.9auto vs. 2.0 manual

The other day I was stopped at a light getting ready to cross a 
bridge when I looked over and saw an almost identical Westy in the 
next lane. It had some decorative trim that was just slightly 
different from mine. He did'nt see me yet and the light changed and 
we took off...or rather he took off! I was trying to keep up so I 
could talk or at least wave to this guy at the next light. He was way 
ahead of me...it was the proverbial tortoise and hare race...he was 
a good two hundred yards ahead of me. Fortunately he took the exit 
that I was headed towards and we stopped at another light. He was one 
link up tho and I couldn't get his attention. I could tell that he 
had a manual transmission tho and I figured maybe his was an 86 that 
has the 2.0 litre engine, mine is an 85 1.9 auto. Anyhow I finally 
caught up to him at another light but he was in the left turn lane so 
we just waved and gave the thumbs up sign...but I didn't get to ask 
him any details...maybe he had a porche engine in there...I don't 
know...is the difference between the auto 1.9 and the manual 2.0 
enough to account for this disparity? I'm getting a complete tune up 
in a week or so and replacing the fuel filter...I'm still kinda 
sluggish on acceleration...and after witnessing the responsiveness of 
this guys Westy I know mine can be a lot better. I don't mind being a 
tortoise..I just want to be a turbo tortoise! Any comments or advice 
will be much appreciated. Thanks,
Rick
