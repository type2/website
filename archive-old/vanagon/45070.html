Subject: Westfalia Werks-museum

I have seen references to the Volkswagen museum in Wolfsburg, but do you
know that there is also a Westfalia museum ? The company is located in
Rheda-Wiederbr=FCck in Germany (tentatively south of Bremen, east of M=FCns=
ter)
and entrance to the museum is free, however it is not routinely open so
visitors is adviced to get in touch with them in advance to arrange a visit=
