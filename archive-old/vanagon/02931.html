Fellow camper-geeks,

My wife and I decided to take a break today from all those academic duties and
cater to our spiritual needs: she went to church and I checked up on my
bus. Project of the day: find out why the fridge in this '75 Westy does
not work and --if possible-- fix it. 

This one is electric only, and my plan is to measure the resistance of the
heating element. The problem is that I've never looked at a fridge before
and can only guess what the heating element is. I found a brass or copper
cylinder, about 3 inches long, maybe 3/4 in. diameter with 2 electric
wires at its base. Actually there are 2 more wires at the base, but those were
cut off (is this normal?). I measured 180 Ohms between the two wire stumps.

Is this what I am supposed to measure? Is 180 Ohm good? Is this cylinder
really the heating element? What else could be wrong? 

Any help at pulling me out of the ditch of ignorance will be greatly
appreciated. &quot;Show me,&quot; I'm from Missouri. 

Sami,
