Subject: bus joke (humor) At least the vanagon list understands...

OK, the first isn't a bus joke, but I thought it was funny....

Oh Kennedy, Oh Kennedy,
Clan of fornication.
If it be a girl he sees,
His pants are at half-station.

It matters not, of whom we talk
They're all the same, chips off a block.
Oh Kennedy, oh Kennedy
Skirts you're always chasing.

(Sung to the tune &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;)

Dashing through the snow in my rusty old kombi.
Down the road I go, sliding all the way. Ha Ha Ha
I need new piston rings.  I need some new snow tires.
My car is held together by a piece of chicken wire!

Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew away.
I light a match to see the dash and then I start to pray-ay.
The pan is bent, the muffler went, the camper top it leaks.
Oh, what fun it is to drive the camper til next week!

I went to RMW, to get some Christmas cheer.
I just passed up my left front tire and it's gettin' hard to steer.
Speeding down the highway, right past the county cops.
I have to pump three times, just to get the bus to stop.

Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew away.
I light a match to see the dash and then I start to pray-ay.
The pan is bent, the muffler went, the camper top it leaks.
Oh, what fun it is to drive the camper til next week!

Bouncing through the snowdrifts in a big, blue cloud of smoke.
People laugh as I drive by; I wonder what's the joke!
I have to get to Wal-Mart to pick up my layaway,
Cause Santa's comin' soon in his big, old barndoor someday!

Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew away.
I light a match to see the dash and then I start to pray-ay.
The frame is bent, the muffler went, the camper top ot leaks.
Oh, what fun it is to drive the camper til next week!

Shamelessly modified from rec.humor!
