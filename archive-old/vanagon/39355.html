Subject: Beckys' Drive In

John,

I saw Apollo 13 at Beckys' last summer, first time I was ever there.
Cool, family owned drive in, use to show skin flicks, but now shows
family movies. People pull up, set up folding chairs and blankets,
tune in the audio on the radio. We sat in the back seat of the van
with the table up, quaffing some brews and munching on pretzels.
Try doing that at the local multi-plex!

It would be great to have a bunch of us show up together one evening 
this summer. Could meet for dinner and take in a movie. Sounds like 
fun, any one else up to going to a classic old drive in to see a
movie?
