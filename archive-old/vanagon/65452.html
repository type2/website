     Chris-

     You're probably right in looking for a new guy.  As late as last
     spring, the '90 models (including the Westfalia) were still in the
     NADA bluebook (low-ball values), and you can punch all the details in
     the Kelly Blue Book on line at www.kbb_dot_com and get a resale value
     (usually a better figure than the NADA one).  How much evidence does
     the guy need?

     And don't make the mistake of referring to a Westfalia as a
     &quot;conversion van&quot; within earshot of the guy - it's not.  The Westfalia
     is a bona-fide factory model recognized by the auto, finance, and
     insurance industries.

     This saves you the estimating trouble you might have if you owned a
     1987 Ford Econoline with a Ma'n'Pa Industries of Elkhart Indiana,
     Deluxe, Sooper-dooper Pleasure palace mahogany and shag carpet sin-bin
     conversion, or whatever.

     Of course, if it realy is an Aftermarket Conversion, shame on you for
     calling it a Westfalia.
