Subject: WTB: pre 68 Panel Van

Hi All,

A friend of mine is very interested in acquiring a split-window panel 
van.  It must be in working order without body cuts or any history of 
rust.  A minor amount of work needed is okay.  He works for an airline 
company and can travel to purchase.  Please email me with any details of 
available 67 or earlier panel vans meeting this description.  Thanks.
