Subject: re:DeLorean(was Isetta Doria)

All,

DeLorean(Stainless Steel car man for those who haven't followed the thread
too closely) was arrested for trafficing cocaine. Since his assest were seized
he did not have enough money for his defense.  To raise the funds he had
the DeLorean built.  Ironically he didn't make enough money back to recover
the startup costs for the car.I guess that's why he went to jail

Cheers,

David
