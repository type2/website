Subject:      I'm back. :)

well, here's my trip report ... kinda long, but then, i tend to talk a lot. ;)

     Wednesday, May 24th
2349-88,429 - on the road, heading north, on I-65.
     Thursday, May 25th
0155-88,560 - passing Huntsville, AL ... sighted familiar looking
              taillights zooming past on entry ramp. speed up to see
              what year bus it is; up to 4200 rpm (71mph!).
0203-88,570 - finally caught up! a brown/brown 84 vanagon, who turns
              off at the next exit. :(
0310-88,650 - passing Spring Hill, TN (where Saturn cars are made).
              suddenly there is LOTS of traffic on the highway, all
              headed north into Nashville, and all driving GM cars.
0433-88,730 - stop for fuel; they won't sell me a KY Lottery ticket,
              cause they can't sell before 0600. ???
0556-88,788 - rain; big bugs are smashing into the windshield, smearing
              all over the place. have to stop and clean glass.
0620-88,814 - Paducah, KY: sign reads &quot;National Quilt Museum&quot;. ??
              Ohio river is swollen and way up.
0643-88,838 - noticing (now that it's light outside) the different
              plants and trees in on the roadside and in the median;
              unfamiliar rocks beside the road in the cut-throughs;
              road-kill is also different (no possums or armadillos ...
              must be smarter up here).
0854-88,977 - more fuel.
1000-89,022 - Ft. Zumwalt City Park, O'Fallon, MO. NOBODY IS HERE!!??
              just a few workers, cutting the grass. wet grass. grey
              skies. an ominous omen, to be sure. called Sami - no
              answer. draw the curtains and try to take a nap.
1330-       - groggily awake; called Sami, and told them i was here.
              back to sleep.
1730-       - Sami &amp; Maria drive out to Ft. Z, wake me up, and we
              go back to St. Louis (actually, University City). on the
              way in, we see what must be Dave Schwaze's bus. quick
              flip around and park next to it. when we walk up, the
              young lady inside looks somewhat anxious until we intro-
              duce ourselves. Dave is off talking on the payphone. we
              all go to Sami's place, then walk down the street to the
              pizza place (convenient, close: so how come Sami and Maria
              are so skinny?? :). back to Sami's place, where Dave and
              Sami ooh and ahhh over solar panels (Dave has two on top
              of his fixed high-roof bus; Sami has four to put on top
              of his Westfalia pop-top). ride back to Ft. Z with Dave
              and Shelly (the anxious-looking young lady, with beautiful
              green eyes). it is very late.
     Friday, May 26th
&lt;didn't look at times&gt;
- up; shower (real hot water!);
- Pete Sellers shows up in his Eurovan, and begins setting up his
  opulent Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Genuine Safari camping outfit, complete
  with zippered screen room. ;)
- met Brendan Murphy and Josh Kline from Long Island, NY ... they drove
  all the way in their somewhat &quot;used&quot; old split-window bus,
  which got stuck and we had to put them out of them &quot;swamp&quot;.
- Dave leaves to go see some local relatives, and Sami shows up with
  his camper. later, he and Dave work on putting the solar panels on
  Sami's pop-top.
- Barry Nichols shows up in his camper; later that night (after removing
  all brightly colored tie-dyed clothing, and wearing only dark drab
  outfits!), he and a few cohorts are seen carrying a picnic table and
  setting it next to his camper. &quot;We borrowed it. from up by the
  showers.&quot;. riiigggggggggght. ;)
- met some folks from MS/TN (Memphis area) and another fellow with an
  87 camper from OK. sat up all night around their campfire, lying and
  telling tall tales (all old grey-haired folks here). boy, them old
  folks can sure suck down the beer! :)
    Saturday, May 27th
- up again (i hate mornings); shower again (still got hot water);
  mess around, mess around, take pictures.
- rain; wind; blows my tarp down.
- Gerry Skerbitz shows up with wife Lorin &amp; kids; we go off to get more
  ice, then he sets up his tent and tarp.
- i wander around taking pictures and noting buses for the voting for
  the awards, asking folks with vanagons if they want microfiche. ;)
  one fellow with a syncro says, &quot;nah, thanks. some nut in alabama
  already sent me one!&quot; .. :( turns out to be Dan Soiney, who used to
  be on the list, but graduated and lost his account. he's planning on
  trying to get back on this fall.
- Pete &amp; Rose offer supper for the Vanagon net gang: we all begin to
  notice what we forgot (like i forgot my plate(s), map book, and
  Bentley manual).
- awards: Dave Schwarze gets Longest Distance Traveled; Gerry Skerbitz
  wins $25 gift cert from West Coast Metric (which is what Dave really
  wanted!). the rest of us just sink deeper into the rain soaked ground.
  Brendan and Josh get two awards: Bus Needing Most Restoration; and
  Dirtiest/Oilest Engine Comparment.
- more rain and wind.
- at sometime during this day, the split-window crew down by the swamp
  (a low area that seems to get everyone stuck), of which Beavis and
  Butthead (Josh &amp; Brendan) are a part, discover that if you put a can
  of tuna into the campfire, it will explode. &quot;Way Cool, Dude!&quot; ... so
  the night is filled with the smell of burning tuna fish and the sounds
  of Ka-Whomp! &lt;exploding can&gt;. apparently, they brought a LOT of tuna
  with them.
- about a dozen or so folks made it up from Texas; they had a really
  neat tent/tarp/cover setup, normally used for drag racing ... you
  could drive two buses under this thing! but those vile, seductive
  Gypsy women they brought with them seduced nearly $100 out of me,
  selling me those digusting little toy buses!! ;)
    Sunday, May 28th.
- surprise! clear, sunny skies! however, the soggy ground and grass-
  matted muck are not moved by this. by midday, lots of buses, clothes,
  dogs, tarps, etc. are dried out enough to pack up, but it is still a
  swap in most places. and all the people walking around and buses
  driving are making it more and more of a quagmire.
- up; shower; etc.
- Pete &amp; Rose Flapjack House on Wheels opens for business.
- people start leaving; after being unstuck from the mud, that is.
  everybody gets stuck.
- Sami &amp; Dave head off for more visiting of relatives and zoo and
  whatever. Pete &amp; Rose must now resort to refolding and repacking their
  extravagent tent village and fitting it back inside what now seems to
  be a very small EV; Barry heads back to Louisville; Gerry and i leave
  the campround and head &quot;north&quot; toward Iowa, fighting rather severe
  crosswinds all the way.
- Gerry &amp; i reach the rendezvous point in Iowa. not enough spaces. so
  we try another place down the road about four miles. bingo. enough
  spaces for all of us (Pete is supposed to show up in a few hours,
  and Dave &amp; Sami will meet up several hours after that). we reserve
  the spaces, and try to get in touch with Pete &amp; Sami (via cellular
  phone ... works great; gonna have to get me one of them things!).
- Pete arrives; we load into my bus and go eat in Muscatine, IA. when
  we get back, we remember that we forgot to call Mike Wright ... so i
  call (it's about 2300): he's just gone to bed, but says he'll meet
  us at the campground in the morning (he's about four hours away).
  it's getting cold (to me) ... we are next to the Mississippi River
  and it's a good ways up on its banks.
- everybody turns in. i stay up to wait for Dave &amp; Sami. finally they
  show up about 0100. we all turn in for the night.
     Monday, May 29th
- cold morning. Gerry &amp; the kids are up and terrorizing the campground
  already. :) the Cleaners of the Can are also busy ... the showers and
  toilets are cleaned each morning from 0700-0800. ?? up and att'em
  finally about 0830. hot water here as well!
0930- Mike Wright shows up, in his 68 Frau Bluucher bus. :)
  introductions all round, b.s. all round, food is cooked and consumed,
  and stuff is packed back into the buses. plans are changed, GNATT is
  now heading north toward WI and MN w/ Mike in tow. but i have to head
  back to AL.
1120-89,334 - leave Clark's Ferry campground.
1131-89,345 - i peel off from the Wagen Train, and take I-280 south.
1148-89,363 - &quot;Rough Road&quot; signs. a distinct UNDERstatement! i'd
              forgotten what bad winters do to road surfaces. :(
1515-89,584 - stop for fuel; clean windshield.
1920-89,833 - gas/food/toilet; Sonora, KY. big truck stop. lots of
              lotto machines, junk in &quot;store&quot;. food is good, though.
    Tuesday, May 30th
0030-90,104 - fuel.
0220-90,201 - HOME! leave the car; grab the pillows and blankets;
              sit and relax a while; check email: gee, only 132 messages
              but most of them are LARGE digests!

so the total was:
going up: 593 miles, 10:11 time, averaged 58.2 mph, with cruising
                                 control set on 64 mph.
coming back: 867 miles, 15:00 time, averaged 57.8 mph, set on 64mph.
fuel economy stayed around 21 mpg.

amazingly, there was almost no traffic on the way back ... the only
heavy traffic i saw at all was on the northbound side at some one-lane
construction restrictions. after leaving Nashville, there was almost
no traffic on the road at all.

so ... was it worth it? :) yeah. pretty neat seeing all those buses.
even had three Eurovans (which, by the way, also get stuck in the mud).
and several vanagons, lots of bay-windows, and scads of split-windows.
i could have done without the bullfrog serenade at the pond, though ...
it was that, or the guy in the tent next to me snorred awfully loud!

the weather was NOT good, but in spite of that, it was kinda fun.
muddy, but fun. NOBODY looked like i thought they would ... and i'm sure
i wasn't exactly what they expected, too. ;)

i wish i could have gone further north on the GNATT, but every hour
north put me about two hours farther from home (rough estimate), so i
needed to head back when i did ... i needed today to recover. i'm
gettin too old for this marathon driving stuff ... gonna have to start
stopping more and sleeping in motels or something along the way. but
i get all excited when i start out driving, and just stupidly keep
going until i get where i'm headed.

well, that's about it. if anybody has any specific questions or areas
they want me to tell about, let me know and i'll answer when i'm more
awake (have to get back into the swing of things at work, you know). ;)
