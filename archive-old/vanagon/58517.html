Subject: Here they are: Eurovan AND Sharan Syncros

Hey, they are out there already!  Eurovan, Combi, whatever,images are
on the WWW and almost all models are available in Syncro versions. 

The VW Belgium site has a nice line drawing summary at:
http://www.vw.be/vvu/utilfr/index.html which then leads you to
specific models.

At no extra cost, VW Belgium has an imaginative image map at:
http://www.vw.be/net2/francais/index.htm, move all the
way to the right and check out the time machine.

As an added bonus, check out the Sharan Syncros- Gl and Carat
versions at: http://www.oeamtc.co.at/oeamtc/autokost/welcome.htm

Have fun!

Tom F.
