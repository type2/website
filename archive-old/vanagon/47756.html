Subject: EV, Still Looking, Lurking, &amp; Cruise Control
Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 23:39:09 -0700

Hello Everyone,
As the subject line says, I am still looking for &quot;the&quot; Eurovan. Spotted a 
fairly nice EV GL recently. This one didn't have the convenience group 
(cruise control, power windows, power locks). The power windows and locks I 
can do without, but cruise control would be REAL nice for what will be the 
road trip van.

Anyone had any experience retrofitting CC to an EV? (Either O.E. VW or 
aftermarket). How much might this cost? I've heard horror stories about 
difficulties in  retro fitting cruise control to bricks, but they are a 
different animal altogether.

Any input greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Matt Dekker
