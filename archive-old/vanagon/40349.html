 Volks, I hope you're all doing fine, and as always, to the point.

 I hear different opinions about body rubber. I would like more, if you
don't mind spending a couple of minutes answering this plea. Of the 4 major
vendors, which sells the best? I'm referring to BFY, RMMW, WCM and Wolf. West.

 Fit and quality are the a major consideration since I don't want rust; and
then price, of course. Although, don't mention the prices. I have the
catalogs (at last!). Your opinions are taken in high esteem. If you wish,
mail direct to me. Thanks!
