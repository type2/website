&lt;&lt; It turns out that the van was sold to me without the O-ring/washer that
fits
 with the plug bolt--I had no way of knowing that there was supposed to be
 one and didn't replace with a new one when I bought the first bolt.  When
 the dealer sold me the second bolt, he asked if I needed a new O-ring to go
 with it.  Thanks for not telling me the first time! &gt;&gt;

I just completed oil change #1 on my '87 GL.  I had sent my wife to the
dealer to get some oil filters a few days earlier.  After I read the messages
about the O-ring/washer, I stopped by and picked up a dozen of them.  Well,
today when I go to get the filter out of the box I here this rattling sound.
 Hmmmm.  I open up the box and there on the bottom is the O-ring/washer I
need!!  It seems as how the parts guy (been with VW since '59) threw them in
when my wife bought the filters.  What a guy!
