Hi Alun.  Don't know too much about your particular problem, but do 
have an '87 Golf Diesel with 1600 engine.


&gt; &gt;its missing, once the motor warms up its sort of OK but power
&gt; &gt;seems to be way down and she smokes like a campfire ! This problem
&gt; &gt;has become progressivly worse over the last few weeks. I have
&gt; &gt;put new glows in and at least she starts now. Also after a good
&gt; &gt;long high speed run I get sparks of burning soot from the exhaust.
&gt; &gt;Is this injectors or head gasket or what ?

Black smoke is unburned fuel.  Excessive black smoke could be caused 
by bad injectors (not properly defined spray pattern) or improperly 
calibrated injector pump.  These are the two common problems.  
Injectors are usually replaced (it'll cost over $120 here just for 
the parts).  

Have you tried putting in an injector cleaner lately?  This does 
wonders.  Use it full strength.  I use a BG product called DieselMax 
out here (Canada), and it keeps the pump clean, and injectors happy. 
It's a cheap initial start of diagnosis.  You might have to run a 
couple applications of this stuff through your tank.  The first time 
I did our Golf, it ran really rough the first couple hundred K's, 
then is smoothed right out.  I do this a couple times a year as 
preventative maintenance.

My friends old Rabbit Diesel, went really weird in the starting when 
cold syndrome at 469000 km.  The glow plugs were fine, but the 
compression was toast.  It ran really rough when cold.  The glowplugs 
couldn't generate enough heat to ignite the fuel properly and idled 
really rough until the engine got a bit warm.  He had a compression 
test done, and basically the engine was toast.  The smoke (and there 
were lots of it!) was mostly black.  One would think there'd be a lot 
of blue in it, but not that much.  Maybe the engine had other 
problems as well, don't know.  

A compression test for a diesel takes about an hour or so, and all 
the little rubber hoses between injectors have to be replaced at the 
same time.  Total bill out here is around $100 for this check.  To 
time the injection pump costs about the same.  To rebuild an 
injection pump is around $1200 exhanged with labour.  I'm  still OK 
on the original pump, injectors, head gaskets, etc with 171000 km.  
The head gasket is NOT  a common problem out here with the 
Golfs/Jettas.  We haven't had any Vanagon Diesels out here since 
1982/1983 (I think it was for one of those years).

I don't know if this helps you or not, but hopefully some magic in 
the tank will set things right.

Harry.
