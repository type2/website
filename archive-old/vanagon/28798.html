Subject: New Head Gasket Stud Kit From Raceware

I see in the latest Reaceware engine studds people catalog they say:

NEW!

&quot;For those of you with chronic head gasket leaks or broken head studs in
your Volkswagen Waterboxer engine, we have the cure. Race-Tech has worked
for several years to develop a high strength stud that would prevent head
gasket leaks, and to design a stud that would not corrode like the factory
installed studs. We have succeeded even beyond our expectations with the new
Water-Boxer head stud kit, part number RTE-1013. These studs are a direct
replacement for the factory installed studs, and they come with a 100 year
satisfaction guarantee.&quot;

Then, in the parts list, they also show $229 suggested retail for these suds. 

Raceware is 800-468-1977, tech 313-946-4477.

Wanna buy some *really* expensive bolts? 

For all I know, it is worth it. I wonder if this means Raceware allows you
to increase the torque even further beyond the new higher torque specs issue
by the factory to stab at the head gasket leak problem.

Hummm...
