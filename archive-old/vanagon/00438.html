Sorry if this topic has already been thrashed to death. Just joined the
list. My 78 Camper had a nifty auxiliary gas heater that was great for
taking the chill out after a night's rest. My 91 Camper is lacking this.
Saw something about a German accessory heater that cost more than a house
furnace. Years ago, I added an Ebersparker (spelling?) or was it a
Stewart-Warner to my '67 Squareback that Sears used to sell from their
catalog (!) for about $300.  Came in real handy in Kodiak, Alaska.

Any semi-economical ways to add an auxiliary heater?
