&gt; OK, I'm going to venture a couple questions here cause I wasn't there (make
&gt; sense=BF).  Does the pot sit on the grill or do you remove the grill and let
&gt; the pot sit on the stove-top?  What size of pot are you guyz talking about?
&gt; What about the gases from the burning propane?  Please someone spell this
&gt; out for me...I need it! :-)

I put the pot on the grill as well.  Don't know if the flame would go out
from lack of oxygen if the pot were flat on the stove top - guess I don't
wanna risk it.  The best would be to have a large rectangular pot to cover
both burners, and a small fan to blow air across it, along with one or two
cracked windows (I always crack a window and open the roof vent a little).
I think the fan is needed cause at Red Rock Bradley was in the top bed and
was almost too warm, while on the bottom bed it was only 8 degrees warmer
than outside (44 vs 36).
