Hi buslovers-

I think I was the only recipient of WW's treatise on the future of the
Vanagon.  I am posting it here in case he doesn't.  BTW, William, I rather
liked it.

&gt; 
&gt;  Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A recent post mentioned something about a 5-cylinder engine in a later
&gt; &gt; vanagon.  Is this a stock engine for the later models?
&gt; 
&gt;  The newer, front engined, vans can have a five cylinder diesel engine
&gt; fitted. I wouldn't expect there to be any backward compatibility with
&gt; the waterboxer engines. Is there a five cylinder petrol engine available
&gt; in the US?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;							... I always felt 
&gt; &gt; that my 77 bus with the 2.0l 4 was pretty underpowered...
&gt; 
&gt;  Hmm, the 2.0 litre vans that I drove were plenty powerful enough for me.
&gt; They would easily manage over 80mph in UK trim, maybe they were much worse
&gt; when kitted out for the US market?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 				      ...  I think a vanagon with the Audi
&gt; &gt; 5, especially the turbo version with ~165 bhp would be pretty reasonable.
&gt; 
&gt;  Hmm, maybe you should look at the custom conversions that put 911 flat sixes
&gt; into vanagons, I suspect that VW don't have plans to put anything that powerful
&gt; into their vans but then what do I know? :-)
&gt; 
&gt;  Maybe VW will try to compete with the Renault Espace, I can see the
&gt; advertising already...
&gt; 
&gt;  &lt; Camera pans across rugged mountain landscape, an incredibly twisty road
&gt; devoid of traffic is being negotiated by a short-wheelbase front-engined
&gt; transporter with a windsurfer strapped to the roof, a stunningly beautiful
&gt; woman and an impossibly cute child in the passenger seat and a group of
&gt; exquisitely tailored businessmen chatting in the rear.&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;  *fade up ethereal music, reminiscent of Clannad being played on Didgeridoos*
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;A *new* concept in sports-recreation, an executive vehicle with *space* for
&gt; a boardroom or a family car with *exciting* performance...The new
&gt; Transporter GTI from Volkswagen is all of these and more! With it's close
&gt; ratio gearbox and VR6 engine the Transporter GTI features mindblowing
&gt; acceleration, it's lowered and stiffened suspension promises spirited
&gt; handling and the 16&quot; alloy wheels with low-profile tyres offer tenacious
&gt; grip!
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;Open your mind to the versatility of the Transporter GTI, the new sportsvan
&gt; from Volkswagen!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  &lt; Camera pans out from van arriving at luxury hotel, windsurfers are visible
&gt; pulling barrel rolls in the background despite total absence of wind in the
&gt; plam trees. &gt;
&gt; 
&gt;  *fade out*
&gt; 
&gt;  Actually, I rather like the idea, maybe Porsche could contribute to a
&gt; Transporter RS2? A transporter Quattro turbo? A transporter coupe?
&gt; 
&gt;  Nah!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;         W.
