&gt;My favorite is the Sumitomo HTR70 185/70 HR14 for the bus.  There are other
&gt;tires, but for the size that you need, this one fits the bill.  The sidewall
&gt;is stiff for good response (as are most H rated or better tires), the tread
&gt;is deep and aggressive for excellent water dispersion, the ride is quiet and
&gt;the tire is handsome.  They look like a million bucks on my '82.  The wear
&gt;rating is 320, traction A, temp A.  It is comparable in quality with the
same
&gt;rated Michelin and costs about 30% less.  Sumitomo has been making racing
&gt;tires in Japan for some years now.

185/70???? Question that 70 series big time.  This is a dangerous
combination. There is enough capacity here to hold up a &quot;K&quot; car.  Check the
wieght rating on the sidewall.  Remember that when passenger car tires are
used on a light truck, the tire sidewall wieght rating must be reduced an
additional 10%(federal law).  The Max gross wieght of a normal Vanagon is
5015lbs.  A synchro is 5515lbs,(approximate).  Standard load 205/70-14 are
rated at 1433lbs each.  215/70-14 are rated at 1554 lbs.  This is my choice
for the vanagon.  If you are looking for low cost, the Yokohama A378 costs
about $65 each in the 215/70-14.  It is an excelent all seaon, HR speed rate
tire that works very well on a vanagon.  If willing to spend more money,
there are a lot of excelent tires available.This one can not be beat for the
price.  It looks good too (blackwall)  Look for temparature rating of at
least &quot;B&quot;,  &quot;A&quot; is prefereed.  The factory 205/70-14 with reinforced sidewall
is rated at 1570lbs.
