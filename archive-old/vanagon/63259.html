&gt; Hi Scott, having just come back from the maiden voyage with my 85 Westy I

&gt; No noise, propane made ice cubes every day and moves between campsites at
&gt; 12V kept the fridge adwquately cold.
&gt; BTW, my fridge doesn't seem to work on 120V and given the way it works in
&gt; the other modes I'm not even going to try to fix it.

You made ICE with a westy fridge?  Is it a Dometic just like the rest of us
have?  This is just about unheard of. Mine certainly would never make ice.
Where did you make ice? Didn't the rest of the food freeze too then?
