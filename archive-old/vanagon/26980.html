Subject: Lost Power Breaks..uh-oh HELP!

hey now,

okay, here's the deal: driving around i noticed the engine wasn't running
as smooth as it has been lately. figured the vacuum hose slipped off cuz that's
the last think i fixed recently and it was a tad bit short. luckily had a
longer spare one in the tool box and i pulled over and put that one on in the
dark. everything looked good, so gaping holes any more. start up on a dime,
engine ran smooth, nice purring and we started of with lots of power to spare.
then i went to put on the brakes.....power breaks were gone. now, when i first
got the bus, the vaccum hose was split (or cut?) in two..had no power brakes.
i fixed that and had the carb adjusted (learned how to do it while watching)
and the breaks became easy to use and everything.

  The brakes worked before i put on the new vacuum hose...soi'm figuring i
might have pulled the hose lose from somewhere else.plenty of brake fluid.
the brakes work...thank god cuz i needed them on the way to work to avoid a
rice burning motorcycle who jumped in front of me on the highway this morning.
when i push the brakes down, i hear air escaping somewhere...to the rear left,
hence i figure the vacuum leak (again! grrrr)

  i'm wondering if there's any harm in using brakes when they aren't powered.
you haved to brake hearder i know...but does it hurt the master cylinder or
anything? i'm gonna check it out this evening but i really want take old Viola
Lee to the LEAF festival in the mountains this weekend.

thanks!
