Subject: Questions: looking for vanagon camper

Hi,

I'm new to this list but have heard of all the wisdom on here and thought 
I'd check it out first hand...

I'm looking to get a camper for cross-country travel and also for weekend 
trips.  I'm looking for a vanagon because of more power, more room, and 
more comfort.  From the faq's I gather that an '80-'83 would be the 
ticket for me.  Is it possible to get a later one without having to deal 
with the cracked head and gasket problems?  Was this fixed after a 
certain year or was there a &quot;fix&quot; that solves this problem?

I'd also love to know what to look for so I get a good one.  And if an 
engine croaks what's the monetary damage like (I'm not expecting the old 
$500 rebuilt engine like on old buses)?  Can supplementary heaters solve 
the problem in winter (I live in Vermont!)?  How do these vehicles run in 
hot and cold climates?  How reliable and durable are they?  How costly 
and difficult to maintain?  How fast (or slow) are they - in other words, 
what steady speed can I maintain on a highway without straining.  And 
what kind of mileage should I expect?

Finally....if you are selling one, let me know!  I may be able to pick it 
up in the northeast or southwest.

Thanks to all in advance for your help.

Uri.
