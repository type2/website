Subject: Engine Rebuild Pt II

My 78 Engine is out, stripped down, heads are off, can now see my sunken
valve seat that caused this mess in the first place! Anyways, the engine is
pretty damn dirty, real thick greasy oil and dirt pretty much cover the
bottom 2/3's of it. The cylinders aren't too bad but could stand to be
cleaned. I don't think I want to get into the crankcase as the engine was
running and sounding fine before, but I'm unsure what to do about the
pistons and cylinders. I removed one cylinder to check general condition
and it &quot;seems&quot; fine, no major wierd marks or scratches anywhere, and
compression was reading 125 all around before the dropped seat.

However the engine was using alot of oil before this, mainly through oil
leaks I'm sure, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to replace the rings
and remove the pistons and cylinders to give them a thourough cleaning.
Good idea?

How should I approach the engine case? It's majorly filthy, but I don't
really want to take it in and have it cleaned, scraping and towelling will
have to suffice for now. Should I be overly cautious about getting engine
cleaner anywhere inside or could that be drained out without harm? Anyways,
sorry for all the questions, this is my first engine rebuild and I'd like
to do it right. Any and all suggestions greatly appreciated!
