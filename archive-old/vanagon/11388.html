&gt;Bingo.  I find the thought of an open flame in a moving vehicle a little
&gt;too scary.  I've used a catalytic heater (years ago) camping, though, and
&gt;it worked great.  Heated the interior of the Bus in nothing flat.

I kept a small propane-fired heater in my Bus, with extra fuel.  It
literally saved my life when I was stranded in a remote area in the winter.
