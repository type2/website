&gt; TGIF is much older than you might suspect, dating back to pre-Roman days.
&gt; it originally was
&gt; 
&gt; Tempus gratias in fugit
&gt; 
&gt; which is a variation of the simpler 'Tempus fugit' (Time flies).
&gt; TGIF, however, was normally spoken in exasperation, after long periods of
&gt; tedious and boring labor.
&gt; 
&gt; Loosely translated, TGIF means 'by the grace of Time in passing', or even
&gt; more loosely, &quot;Thank God we don't have to do THIS any more!&quot;. One might even
&gt; suppose it could be interpreted as &quot;Can you imagine doing THIS the rest of
&gt; your life!!&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; All translations would, however, have in common the theme of 'gratias' or
&gt; thankfulness/grace at the ability/condition of time passing/not-staying-still,
&gt; i.e., we are glad that time passes ... we would be unhappy if time were
&gt; stagnant (and we had to do this crap forever).
&gt; 

translations just aren't what they used to be.
