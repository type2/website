 &quot;OOPS!  John, you must have forgotten to change the recipient on your

Davis won't notice the posting.&quot;

  I've just written a private note to Jim Davis appologizing for this 
error on my part.  He and I differ substantially in our views of what 
kind of safety margin VW should have built-in to all of their water 
cooled motors, and our experience has been very different.  Later 
years production are much improved compared to the older series.  He's an 
excellent reader and doubtless will notice this mistake on my part.

  &quot;Evacuating the air from the Renault's cooling  system made the job on 
the Vanagon look like child's play.&quot;  Randy, you may have hit on a much 
worse cooling system example.  I just hadn't thought of Renault.

  Again, my appologies to Jim Davis.

  John Wakefield
