Subject: more on redrock


The latest nag from mother.martha:  get gas, bring water, ice, firewood, 
propane, and food/drink - especially, since it will be difficult to get these 
things once we're there!

Friday nite's the potluck chili thing.  All other meals I suggest we do 
grab-bag.  Leaving things to chance often turns up very interesting results.  
Why, how else would one ever discover 101 ways with prunes?  Hey, maybe we can 
write a cooperative 'net prune cookbook!  :)

Remember if you will please to bring pasta and side-dish stuff for Saturday.  
In the interest of simplicity, I suggest everyone bring for Saturday nite's 
side-dish the same TYPE of dish they are bringing to Friday.  That way, we 
ought to have enough salads, desserts, appetizers, etc.

If anyone needs me by phone, I'm at 510.376.4321, and if you have trouble 
reaching me e-mail, try andrea2_at_aol_dot_com.

See you all soon!  Will those of you who haven't signed up for food to bring 
to Friday evening let me know asap, so we don't fall short or duplicate 
unnecessarily?  Thanks!
