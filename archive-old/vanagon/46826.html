&gt; Hey now,
&gt;      Having spent 3 unplanned days in a motel in Victorvile (didn't know my
&gt; friend hasn't yet gotten a permanant residence yet), we find outselves a bit
&gt; poor. So, if anyone between Fort Bragg and Portland wants to put a couple of
&gt; travellers up for the night, we'd sure be happy to impose.   ;-) Email access
&gt; is a bit scetchy right now, so we may not have a chance to check it until
&gt; Portland, but if we do we'd love to visit...
&gt; Peace,

There's a great *free* place to camp along US 101 just south of 
Orrick, Ca. Right on the beach, a wide pullout about a mile long. It's 
marked with signs, a few tables &amp; firepits, and portapotties. No 
water though. 
We spent a night there - beautiful spot.
