Subject: Battery Removal 

As I was struggling,cursing and peeling off the skin from my knuckles while
removing the battery from my Westy,it dawned on me to rig up some type of
&quot;git-up&quot; to avoid the same trauma next time. So what I did was take a
bicycle inner and cut out a 20&quot; piece. I laid it in to the battery box
before installing the battery and looped the ends out of the box. Dropped
the battery in and presto , an easy way of removing the battery and keeping
my knuckles intact. It works so well that I removed the battery twice just
for fun.Okay maybe it doesn't read as well as I thought but hey, it works!
