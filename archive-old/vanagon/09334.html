&gt; &gt;Nice looking Ride, I wonder where the police auctions are?
&gt; 
&gt; i thought they said that the real owner had gone into a 7-11-type place and
&gt; left it running outside, then the perp (cop-slang for Perpetrator! :) had
&gt; driven it off.

Could be, I didn't have the volume on for the first bit, (listening to the
beatles, with the T.V. absently running).

&gt;  it was a blue camper, from the door panel it looked to be
&gt; a later model bus (like 76-79 or so). didn't make much sense why he already
&gt; had all that drug stuff if he'd just stolen it, though. (i don't really watch
&gt; closely ... that show is just sort of background 'filler' for me. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; and it's probably already gone. :(  they had to have filmed that several
&gt; months ago, don't you think?


Probably, But if he wasn't the owner...  Who's Meth was it???
