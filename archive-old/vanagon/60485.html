Subject: Re: radiator fan stays on


Nelson,

&gt;Vanagon (87 Syncro)
&gt;I thought it would be the thermal switch.
&gt;Bentley says this is located on the upper left front of the radiator,
&gt;behind the grille. Looking there I cannot find it. The van has
&gt;airconditioning and is a Syncro.

Only the old vanagons, up to '82, have the switch (or two of them
at high powered gas or all diesel engines) behind the upper grille.

The newer Vanagons have this switch behind the lower grille, left side.
