&gt; Subject: Lemon ? Advice

&gt; I could use some advice and opinions.
&gt; &lt;snips here and there&gt;

&gt; We made a list of things that the dealer would fix before we got
&gt; the car.  Mostly minor things.

&gt; --Car has broken odometer stuck at 113,500. Dealer assures us it
&gt; is no more than 115K

&quot;Assures&quot; is a broad term, but even at 115K, that's not too bad.
The odometer fix could be just sliding a gear back into place or
replacement (it's nylon).  Some have super-glued the old one back
together.  My odometer stopped at 66K and I kept track of mileage
by gallons until I could pull the speedo and fix the odometer
gear.  I'm at 101K now with no problems.

&gt; --Exhaust system needs overhaul. Dealer finds out after we buy
&gt; the car that it has no catalytic converter. Takes 2 weeks to get
&gt; one.

Exhaust system on Vanagon has historically been a problem.  All
the support brackets rust through and the additional stress
causes pipe failure.  The brackets can be easily made of
stainless (they're just pipe with the ends flattened).  The
catalytic converter is expensive from VW, but aftermarket sources
are available (Walker, I think).  I see no reason for the two
week delay.

&gt; --A week after we have it, I start to do some mtce. I put
&gt; windshield washer fluid in the front, and it goes onto the
&gt; pavement.
&gt; --I try the rear window washer, and it spills onto the back
&gt; cushion. After investigation I find the line is broken open near
&gt; the roof

Front fluid reservoir is placed where ice/rocks might crack it or
the previous owner left water in it in the winter.  The plastic
tube for the rear may suffer from the same (water in winter, so
it froze).  In either case, both of these are an indication of
the previous owner, rather than the vehicle.  My '84 washer
systems work fine and I've heard no one else express problems
with theirs.

&gt; --The air filter is black before I replace it.
&gt; --The oil was supposed to be changed but the oil filter is dirty
&gt; and a Fram (which the dealer doesn't use)

Again, both of these are a reflection of the previous owner and
both of these are more serious than the washer system problems.
If you change the air filter and watch it, and change the oil and
watch it, you can head off any further problems.

&gt; After this all happened I got the car inspected by an inspection
&gt; service (the VW repair shops are booked up for weeks). He says
&gt; not much wrong, an oil leak here, that kind of thing. But his
&gt; major concern is the he says there is a rod knock that needs to
&gt; be chacked out.

&gt; Ed Wehling

I would agree that rod knock is real concern.  The other items
you mention are bolt-on, replace as needed, but you won't be
going anywhere if that rod goes!  Key to this is trusting the
mechanic---and NOT necessarily VW mechanics.  I bought my '84
new, had it serviced by VW for 5-6 years and found a good
independent shop to work on it since then.

Another potential problem is the cooling system, particularly the
coolant lines from the back to the front.  Have those inspected
for signs of rust-through.

Lemon?  Hey, it's still running 12 years after it hit the
road--maybe in spite of the previous owner.  No, I wouldn't say
lemon at all.  Would you buy an '85 D*dge van and not expect some
of the same--or more--problems?  I say get fixed what you know
about, watch for bad signs or noises, and put it on a schedule of
regular oil changes.  Then you and your wife just go, and enjoy,
and keep in touch with the list.  If you're going to travel
extensively, join LiMBO.  Members get a list of other Vanagon
owners who'll help out along the way across the USofA.
