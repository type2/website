Chris -

I am running the stock 1.9 FI system on my 2.1 in my Westy.  It works,
that's all I know.  Whether it makes a difference in power, I have
nothing to correlate or compare that with because the 1.9 had a hole in
it's case the size of a good fist when I got the Westy.

I do know that Vanagon 2.1's sold in the far east (Taiwan, Japan,
Indonesia, etc.,) from 86-87 came with the Digijet system and not the
Digifant.

&gt;who had mentioned if you put a 1.9 fuel inj. system on a 2.1 engine, 
&gt;then it
&gt;will increase performance....
&gt;Is this a bunch of bunk, or can anyone substantiate this??
