Subject:      Idle problems, '84

my '84 camper started misbehaving a couple days ago. When i first start it,
it doesn't want to idle, keeps trying to die, with the idle surging. There
is no noticeable power loss, and I can drive it fine on the freeway. After
it's warmed up a bit, and i get off the freeway, when i put the clutch in,
the engine races out of control, maybe 3,000 rpm or more. I can let the
clutch out in first a little to get the idle back down, but then it tries
to die again.
        I disconnected the idle stabilizer and it made no difference. tried
a different airflow meter and that didn't help. I had a couple of spare
used unknown quality ECU's that i tried, but the van wouldn't even start
with those in it, so they're no longer unknown quality. The problem seems
related more to the fuel injection than the ECU anyway.
        Anyone seen similar symptoms or have any ideas that might help me?
tia,
