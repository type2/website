Subject: Re: North VA Pizza Gathering!!

Man, I'm bumming.

A combination of bad timing led to my state.

I had to go on a trip to St. Louis Friday the 13th. So I had to
catch a 4:00 pm flight the 12th. Well, the digest does not
get here until about 4:00pm, so I missed the notice of a Pizza
meeting on the 15th. And I live only about a block from the
mentioned restraunt, and it is one of my favorites. I was back Friday night,
but read my mail at work, so never got the message.

Did the group meeting go down as planned? How many attended? 
Was much pasta pie eaten? 

Jealous!
