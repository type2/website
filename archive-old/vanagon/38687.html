&gt;Hey All--
&gt;
&gt;One of St. Paul's -20 degree nights in February toasted the rear door
&gt;struts on my '87 Westy Weekender; they won't hold the door open much less
&gt;help lift it.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions on the best way go on replacing them?
&gt;
&gt;

replace them with brand new units from Teutonix Automotive in SC.  I think
the price would suprise you.  Teutonix is quite reasonable.  E-mail:
