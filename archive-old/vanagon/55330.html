&gt; If the vehicle is fuel injected and the vapor line plugged, the chances are
&gt; very good that the suction from the fuel pump will collapse the fuel tank.
&gt; Vacuum has almost superman like powers. Especially on thin fuel tanks. I've
&gt; seen it happen with mechanical pumps on beetles.

I'll second that - my Dad's diesel Rabbit did this when the vent hose 
rubbed against the alternator belt &amp; melted closed. The tank would 
only hold about 3-4 gallons of fuel afterwards. VW covered it under 
warranty though...
