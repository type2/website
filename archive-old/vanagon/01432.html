&gt; Since most of the figures for mileage were for vangons, and mostly
&gt; water-cooled at that, I was wondering if someone can tell me if
&gt; the 10-12 mpg I am getting on a recently (1000 mi.) overhauled
&gt; engine is as pathetic as I think or if it's par for the course.

It is pathetic, yes (sorry, I had to say it :)).  I only noticed a slight
drop in mileage after rebuilding the motor in my '73, and now I am back
up to 19-21 on the highway, and that is loaded down with fridge, stove,
propane tank, three batteries, and tons of camping equipment.  Did this
mileage just start happening after the overhaul?  Sounds to me like
something was not done correctly.  Does the engine have normal amounts of
power?  Is it still a 1700cc?  Have you had it tuned or smogged recently?
Did you forget to mention that you are towing a 30 foot yacht?  :)
The answers to these questions may give clues as to why your mileage is
so low.

Glad to see another Safare owner on the list!  I don't feel like such an
orphan now, heh heh...
