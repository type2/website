Subject: Re: aerodynamics (Seriously...)

Fred Porter suggests a course of aerodynamics research probably resulting
in a minuscule increment in top speed or mileage.  Couldn't it be argued
that butchers who shorten VW vans are in fact jumping to the conclusion of
this research?  Does anyone ever shorten Vanagons, or is it only split-
windows that get this treatment?
