Pretty much your standard MV
It has all the curtians, both sliding windows, std wheels, auto trans, 
36k miles, and is what I believe they call Perl Red (Dark Red/Burgandy)

It ran me 15,800, the dealer has to replace one broken cup holder, and 
the evaporator canister for the A/C, also got them to throw in a Bentley's.
It's the best van I've found in the area at the best price.  The next 
cheapest MV I've found was 17,400 and a GL for 15,700.  If anybody is 
looking for a Eurovan in FL let me know, I can point you to a few.

Does anybody know if VW makes a floormat for the rear and how much is cost?

Thanks again to all who help with Eurovan info.

&gt; &gt; I just picked up a '93 MV.  It drove beautifully on the trip home, about 
&gt; &gt; 130 miles.  Also, thanks again to all those who responded to all my 
&gt; &gt; question regarding the Eurovan.
