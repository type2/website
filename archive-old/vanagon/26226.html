Subject: re:splitfire plugs

Eddie inquired:

&gt;Anybody know if they're making SplitFires for VW's yet? Last I
&gt;heard, they weren't available to us. Anybody have any words of wisdom
&gt;concerning these goodies?

I respond:

I inquried about these a few months back on &quot;another list&quot; the response
I got was that they tend to produce too much heat, due to the excess
spark that they produce.  The impression I got was to stay away from
them.

Regards,
