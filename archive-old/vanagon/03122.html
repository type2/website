Subject: Stuff Found in Busses
Date: Sun, 21 Aug 1994 22:51:08 -0700 (PDT)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

There was a thread a while back about intersting stuff people found in their
busses, so here's mine.

Recently I was cutting away my rusted rocker panels, and this stuff 
kept falling out.  The &quot;stuff&quot; turned out to be a mixture of steer
manure and wood-chip compost, that must have been havig a hell of a party in
there because it was warm to the touch!  The bus must have been filled
with it at one time, because it was in the vertical rails almost
all the way to the windows!
