Has anyone tried the franchise shops like Monroe, Midas, Speedy for Vanagon
exhaust work?  These shops say they have (most) the parts but I wonder if
the fit will be right and the quality any good.  My 1991 GL has 93K miles
on it and a small, growing hole in the muffler as well as a very rusty
converter and tail pipe.

Also, I'm considering (only considering) selling this well maintained, 4
spd, tornado red beauty as I get ready to send a second child to college.
I'm sure my priorities must be screwed up here.  Can I get an idea of what
a vehicle like this might sell for.

and

I'm curious.  I bought my first new GL in 1986 (an '86) and over the next
five years  I experienced 4 gas tank implosions. At 30k, 34k, 48k, and 55k
miles.  The thing just sucked inself flat as a pancake each time and left
my family stranded in various parts of the country.  VW offered no
explanation but did replace the tank each time.  Has this happened to
anyone else?
