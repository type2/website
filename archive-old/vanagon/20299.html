Subject: propane tank label

Here in Florida most RV parks and Propane outlets do check tagging and
inspection dates as a matter of policy. We have a older motorhome which
uses the 2 single 7.5lb tanks (like the outdoor grill type bottles) and
a somewhat younger motorhome which uses the boltup basement type 30lb
tank. While the latter is quite &quot;out of the way&quot; we have watched while
we filled up and each time the fuel attendant has hunkered down and crawled
under the RV to check and confirm date.  The single bottle types are easy
to spot, and when it has come time to re-inspect them we've just driven to
one of our local &quot;insert name of 7-11 like store here&quot; that sells prefilled
propane tanks for 11.00 (plus trade-in) and browse the expiration dates...
