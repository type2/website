Fred,

Since Greg commented about SLC, and it's Friday, I'll add that they also 
have the only US piano manufacturer west of the Mississippi ... 
Aston-Weight.  They make a fine piano too.  Don Weight personally delivered 
mine to Phoenix.  Yes, they give factory tours.  Tell them I sent you.

Mike
