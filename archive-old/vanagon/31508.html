Subject: EDTA

So... a few months ago there was a discussion of using EDTA to give new
life to batteries.  Can any chemist types explain how this is supposed to
work?  My sister (a chemist, but more biological) said she doesn't know
how it would work, but she gave me 29.2 grams for Xmas so I could try it
out.
