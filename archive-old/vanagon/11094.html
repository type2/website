Subject:       My fool injection


I have had several people tell me that I should leave the FI on the 
bus.  But last Summer when this problem arose, I got the FI motor and 
put it in, I spend weeks trying to get it to work correctly.  No one 
knew what the problem was. I just want a bus that runs good.  I would 
rather have the FI if I can get it working.  

    Last summer no one on the list knew a fix.  Well now that the 
list has grown mabey someone with the fix has arrived.

Heres the scoop.

    Last winter I took the bus, a 70 with a 1.7L in it (I didn't put 
the motor in it it can that way. for really cheap) on a ski trip.  
Outside temp didn't exceed 5 degrees F. n It was running quite well 
on that way up.  When we tried to get it going to cone home she 
didn't want to start.  30 minutes later and with some numb fingers 
she can alive.  Although she sounded sick.  Got hope, barely.  Turns 
out I lost two valve seats on seperate cylinders.  remedy rebuild or 
replace. 

    Well I wanted to put a larger motor in and I did actually want FI 
on it.  I had just spent the last several months building a fuel 
injected motor for school, so I oight have had a little to much 
confidence. 

    Our buddy Bill Calspy (sorry about the spelling) in Cleveland had 
 a 2L to unload.  So over spring break I took the trip to visit Bill. 
 I live in DC. I got the motor and rebuilt it.  From there it went 
down hill.

    Let it be known that the same motor and FI system worked in 
Bill's bus.  I watched him drive it into the garage before we yanked 
the motor. Now almost a year later the bus is still parked.  I bought 
another VW for daily driver.  

    The probelm is that when the ignition is on the injectors open 
and stay open.  no pulsing.  The injectors are not grounding where 
they shouldn't.  Checked that.  I am getting a good siginal from the 
coil.  Wires are hooked up correctly.  Checked several times.  Air 
flow meter was tested and is OK.  Double relay is also OK. Grounds 
are good, connected as in the manual.  I even replaced the Brain box. 
No effect.  Cylinder head thermo is OK as is the air temp sensor.  I 
don't know what else it could be.

    I would like to fix it, but I just want my bus back and running.  
If I can get it working I will have to put carbs on, or mabey an 
after market FI system, I have had better luck trouble shooting them.

    Any solutions, fixes, or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
