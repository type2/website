Subject:      Maintaining a Vanagon ( LONG)

Well, after tearfully answering each inquiry about my '85 Westy that I
_thought_ I wanted to sell, I have decided to rethink this whole thing,
and maybe keep it, and sell my Suburban. I was going to sell both
vehicles and get a new Eurovan, but the top bunk in the new ones sets my
claustrophobic teeth on edge, and the beds are not nearly as
comfortable. I have some questions, and would appreciate input from
anyone more knowledgeable (which means just about anyone.)

One of the reasons that I was selling was because I am so tired of
getting ripped by mechanics for every single thing that I've needed to
have done. Just how difficult is it to work on these things? Mine's an
automatic, by the way.

I renovated houses for about 15 years, but the last 10 or so, acted
mainly as a general; it's been a long time since I did any hands-on
wiring or plumbing. For some reason, while I grew up privy to the
workings of all things house-related, no one ever worked on their cars.
I brought this subject up at a family dinner not long ago, and there was
a collective groan and a unanimous suggestion to dump the VW.

Questions:

1. Which manuals do I need? Which is best for the truly mechanically
retarded?

2. What tools do I need, and where do I get them?

3. What is the absolute easiest thing to start out with? An oil change
maybe? I'm guessing; that's how clueless I am.

My thoughts are that I'll take her in to a local place for a checkup,
and let them itemize what's wrong. There is nothing huge that I know of
that needs attention, but my mpg has drifted down. I do know that I need
some exhaust work done; she's gotten kind of  noisy. Is this something
that is better left to wise ones?

Thanks, in advance, for any suggestions.

Joan
