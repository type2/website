Subject:       (Fwd) Temperature Adjustment

Thanks for the advice on my question if there's an adjustment on the 
water temperature - see below.

I called the mechanic and he said that I had misunderstood him and 
that I had to dilute the antifreeze in the system - that the mixture 
was probably too pure - hence the reason the temperature guage now 
stays about a needle width higher than it did before the water pump 
replacement.  His reasoning was that the &quot;purer&quot; antifreeze is 
retaining the heat more than the older more diluted coolant that we 
drained as the pump was replaced.

IS THIS RIGHT??  As far as I can tell, the slightly higher temp 
reading is not hurting anything.  I can let the vehicle idle in place 
and the temp does not go any further.

Butch
