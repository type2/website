&gt; another weirder answer to the missing brake fluid could be that the BRAKE
&gt; master is leaking into the booster, hence the dissapearing fluid.

I had a Ford truck do this.  I did not notice it by the loss of brake fluid
but rather the problems that occurred when the brake fluid ate a hole
in the power booster diaphragm.  When you applied the brakes the engine
would nearly die (vacuum sink caused by the hole in the diaphragm) and the 
brake pedal would hardly budge (no power assist).   

If the fluid is going into the power booster then the reservoir should
empty itself past the clutch tap point.
