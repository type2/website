&gt;	Anybody have any opinions as to the effectiveness
&gt;	of the vanagon chin spoiler?

i took mine off the 88 that i have now. it kept hitting curbs and things.
i don't think it hurt mpg any, because i still get an average 19.4 mpg
(as opposed to 18.6 on my old 1980 bus ... which did NOT have a spoiler).
i think it was just for looks (to match those bumpers and the side moldings).

&gt;	And what about the the big pan that covers
&gt;	the aux. gas/diesel heater under the van, do
&gt;	you think it improves airflow under the brick?

one of my thoughts was to smooth in the bottom of the bus, to make it like
the beetle and the 911. but the size of the aluminum sheets and the noise
it would likely make, and what sort of fasteners (DZU's? expensive!), etc.,
etc., etc., just kinda made that a non-project. but from what i've seen of
the big 18-wheeler experimental trucks (trying to get better mpg), they
think it helps. even to putting fender skirts (which some of you might be
old enough to remember) on the rear wheels. what it would do to cooling of
the engine, transmission, and fuel pump, i don't know.

&gt;	My friend has an 82 westy that he cut the bottom out of
&gt;	the luggage rack and installed a flip up type sun-
&gt;	roof. With the glass panel removed, your hair is sucked
&gt;	up through the roof - quite strange if you have long
&gt;	hair. I can sort of visualize the airflow up over
&gt;	the van, with a big eddy/void over the luggage rack.

i've seen pictures of buses and vanagons with single pop-up factory sunroofs
and even double (vanagons) pop-ups. but of course, they didn't say anything
about airflow. :)

what i would like to do is to find some small pop-up sunroofs, like about
one foot by one foot, that would match the curve of the roof on a vanagon.
and put one of these over each seat along the sides of the roof ... make
it look somewhat like the old 21- and 23-window Microbuses. :)

well ... i think it might be pretty neat.
