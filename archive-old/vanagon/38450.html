Subject: Emissions

I think I now hold the title for the worst emissions results ever.  Here
in Washington, we have a two part test, at idle and at 2500 rpm(on a set
of rollers for newer cars, to simulate a load).  I pegged the HC reading
at idle, and was three times too high at 2500 rpm.  It's in the shop as I
type this getting fixed.

While I don't really like the idea of driving around in a toxic vehicle, I
do think it's kind of funny that my bus could generate those numbers and
still run.  Oh well.

Has anyone beat my numbers?  I'm kind of curious.
Here are the results:


 		HC       Max. Allowable

Idle:        9999          0900
2500rpm:     2845          0900
