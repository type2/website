&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Does anyone out there know the stock color offerings for 1967 Type II's?
&gt; &gt;In particular, a friend of mine needs to know the different color 
&gt; &gt;combinations for his recently acquired Deluxe Sunroof.
&gt; 
&gt; Two that I know are Sea Blue/Cumulus White and Titian Red/Pearl White(?).
&gt; I'll double check my books and get back with you.
&gt; 
Velvet Green was also offered, I think. I know it was in '65; it was
paired with BlauweiB, or blue-white. It is a really cool combination.
