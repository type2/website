Subject: Re: Platinums:  overheated myth or hot stuff?

I have (In the past)  worked for many years in the auto parts Biz, and
platinum plugs or any plugs for that matter being hotter than ano0ther
manufactururs plugs is purly myth.  the only way to get hotter plugs is to
get hotter plugs period.  however, Bosch themselves do recommend that if the
engine was designed to run on regular leaded fuel, then do not use platinum
plugs.  i don't know the reasonin, but I do think that if a company that has
been making supreme quality parts for european cars for as many years as
they have, then I'd follow their call.  There is one thing different about
platinum plugs, especially bosch, that should be noted.  when gapping the
plug, be painfully careful as the ceramic that encases the eletrode can be
damaged alot more easier than a conventionbal plug can.  On that note,
happy air-cooled (or EV) motoring to all!
