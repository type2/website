My bus used to get too hot. I checked the thermostat the Muir way by
dipping it in boiling water: it did not expand. So I went to some mechanic
who told me the bus would be fine without one, and that's how I left things 2
years ago.

Recently, I got smarter (yes, it was very sudden...) and ordered a new
thermostat from RMMW. It does expand when hot and *will* open the flaps
once the engine has reached 180F. The engine does not overheat.

Moral of the story: a bad thermostat is worse than none, and none is worse
than a good one. They're cheap, so why not?
