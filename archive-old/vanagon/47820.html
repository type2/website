&gt;So, is there some tube through which this condensation is supposed 
&gt;to drain.  The AC on my '87 is in the back because of the pop top.  The 
&gt;water was dripping primarily out of the way back (by the speakers and 
&gt;rear hatch), but also out of the vents .  

I suspect it's the same on the Camper models as it is on my &quot;regular&quot;
Vanagons.  There are two evaporator condensation drainage tubes, one on each
side of the van.  Here's what I do every 2-3 years (as a matter of fact, just
last Saturday after a little waterfall of my own):

Remove two phillips heads screws from one of the black plastic air intake
grills at the rear pillar of the van.  Pull the bottom of the grill out
toward you and then slide the grill down and away from the van.  Reach into
the hole ard toward the front of the van.  You'll find a rubber tube.  Pull
it out so that you can see it.  Stand back!  Pinch the duck-bill-like end of
the tube between your fingers &amp; roll it between your fingers a bit to
dislodge the dirt and the water will start flowin!  Re-assemble and repeat on
the other side.

Don't get wet!
