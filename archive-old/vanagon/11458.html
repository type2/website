Subject: Re: light switch illumination


I'd kinda like to start a mini-thread on dash lights, or lack thereof.  
On my '70 Kombi, the speedo is barely lit at nite.  Anyone know how to 
replace them??

Thanks mucho

&gt; Howdy folks.  I took out the van last night for some exercise and 
&gt; noticed that it was pretty dark where the light switch is located.  I 
&gt; don't drive the van that much at night, and my panel lights are 
&gt; turned off.  I have the daytime running lights (Canadian model), and 
&gt; usually never have to use the light switch as the lights are on all 
&gt; the time (park/tail/headlights) anyway.  So, when I cranked up the 
&gt; rheostat, all the panel lights came on except the light switch.  The 
&gt; rear defogger switch, and hazard switch lights up.  Even the light 
&gt; switch in our Golf lights up.
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone be kind a enough to make a check the next time out at 
&gt; night to see if this switch lights up for me?  Appreciate any 
&gt; feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Harry.
