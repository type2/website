On the list you hear a lot of talk about how expensive these wasserboxers
are to fix and how VW really rips people off. I have to disagree, I checked
up on the price of a new front diff for a syncro, at the dealer for a new
unit with coupling was $3000. Now that's a good chunk of change, but when
you consider most people are getting 12+ years out of them, the price
really isn't that bad. Try checking parts prices on american made cars,
they're expensive too. BTW the dealers are selling remanufactured center
driveshafts for $630, which isn't that bad, I'm happy because I have two
near perfect ones :-)
