&gt; Questions, anyone, would my 86 westy operate ok without the cat
&gt; converter?  No emmissons test here. The exhust tips would come closer to
&gt; the center for me if that were the case. Would the tips clear the tow
&gt; hook bumper hitch?

     Hey, you maybe getting Emissions testing soon, But

    If your into hot motors..This is the way to do a Vanagon 2.1
       1 - remove the cat
       2 - unplug the O2 sensor
       3 - advance the timing to 10 deg.
       4 - install cooler thermostat

    After you do these mods. You will find plenty of power.
