YEAH!  At last someone else on this list with the intelligence to recognize
such a great team!  :) 

&gt; I have to qualify that however ... Stan-the-man was originally with the 
&gt; Washington Redskins.

But he's ours now baby!  I hope he is up to snuff in Miami...

&gt; GO CHARGERS!!!!

YES!!!

Steve &quot;blind leading the blind&quot; Johnson scribbles:

&gt; ANYWAY!!!!  I said that the Chargers wouldn't even have
&gt; a chance to when the AFC play game and they did.  What
&gt; kinda voodoo magic do you do David?  ;)

Hey, I warned ya, those dolls really work!  I'm already stitching up a set
for the 29th...

&gt; Niners are going to kick the Chargers butts all over
&gt; the field on Jan. 29th..    :[ ]
&gt;
&gt; DAVID SCHARZE CAN YOU HEAR ME!!!?

Yeah, yeah, and I've heard it before.  I heard it last Saturday and the
weekend before that too.  People have been ragging on the Chargers from
day one, saying they would end up last in the AFC, yadda yadda yadda.
They were so cocky in Pittsburgh everyone was booking flights to Miami
and printing T-shirts before the game started.  The Chargers may be
underdogs for the Superbowl, but they have proven over and OVER again
that they never give up, and they WILL give San Fran a run for it's money.
So THERE!

GO CHARGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
