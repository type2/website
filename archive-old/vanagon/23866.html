&gt;&gt;Speaking of which, I used to have some cooking guidelines which would 
allow
&gt;&gt;for cooking in the engine compartment (then it was a big V8 engine).  I
&gt;&gt;remember like a couple hours for a whole chicken, or baked potatoes, or 
foil
&gt;&gt;dinners (corn, hamburger meat, carrots).  Does it get hot enough in the
&gt;&gt;engine compartment of a bus, on the top of the block, to do this?  Anybody
&gt;&gt;know, or tried it?
&gt;
&gt;there is a book, Manifold Destiny, which is a cookbook about using the heat
&gt;from a car's engine/exhaust to cook meals. the book is available through
&gt;Classic Motorbooks (whose catalog i got just a couple of days ago). if 
anyone
&gt;is interested, i'll post the 800-number and catalog info. :)


Bring a pillow, and find a comfy spot to lay down, as the exhaust permeates
thru your bod... sleepy time...

C'mon guys, it's not Friday yet!   :)
