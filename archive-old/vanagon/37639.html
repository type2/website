&gt;Does a new remanufactured need a Valve adjustment?
&gt;Who do you think is at fault.  
&gt;And, Has anyone ever had a “Bad” remanufactured - possibly the same
problems.

Valve adjustment need was questionable.  Sometimes it takes forever for the
lifters to pump up.  However, you probably have a bad lifter.  This is very
common.  Frequenr start/stops of engine, especially not allowing it to warm
up fully will often cause a lifter to loose it,s prime.  It will then tap
somtimes for 20 minutes or more.  
Keep on plugggin and lots of luck,
Dennis.

PS. I know you will straighten it out eventualy,  keep the faith.
