&gt; 
&gt; My idle cut-off valve on my left (stock) carb on my 1972 VAN is stripped out. 
&gt; To remedy this I stuck a teflon coated 8mm course thread bolt in the hole.  At
&gt; least it's not leaking fuel from there anymore.   Questions. 1) What harm am I
&gt; doing or problems am I creating?  2) Eventually I am going to fix this, I hear
&gt; (see) a lot of discussions about Webers.  Is this an upgrade that is worth
&gt; while? what is the merits of a Weber over the stock Solex? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your wisdom.

I have the same problem with my '72.  Not having the valve in 
properly created no end of problems to the way the bus ran or idled.  
I striped the end of a piece of electrical cord, spred out the 
fibers, and wraped them around the threads.  I then wrapped the 
threads and wire in teflon tape.  Enough to create an air tight fit 
and crammed the whole unit back into the carb.  finally I ran the 
other end of the wire to the body to create a ground that would have 
otherwise been compromised due to the lack of contact between the 
module and the carb caused by the teflon.
    It works well as a temporary solution but I am told that if the 
module is seated just a hair off It will begin to distort the end of 
the piston and won't seat properly when the carb is fixed or 
replaced.  I am also told that using j.b.weld or other reconstructant 
to fix the threads is a bad idea due to the straightness thing.  You 
basically have to replace that portion of your carb.
    There is a v.w. place in my area that said he would sell me a 
carb that needed rebuilding for $25.  I could then buy a gasket set 
and swap good parts from both carburetors to make one good one rather 
than pay the $300 to have some one else do it.  When I get the cash 
and the time I'll let you know how it goes.
good luck.
Ed.
