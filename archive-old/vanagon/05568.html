Subject:  91 Vanagon Heads Blown: what should I do? Fix or Trade?

Hi, I have a 91 Vanagon Carat whose head gasket blew....My machine shop said the 
head is too &quot;eaten up to repair&quot; and they said by the looks it, I should trade
it in. Has any body had any similar vanagon experiences?? I still owe about 
$8000. on it....What is it worth??  Or Is it better to fix the heads ....
Heads may cost me about 350 each so...Im looking at 1300 total...500 for
the mechanic...350*2 plus 100 for valves..etc.....

If my heads are that bad is it possible that my lower case will cause me any 
trouble??

Thanks In Advance for your opinions. John Matchett
