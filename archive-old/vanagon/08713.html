	Mark Janello,
	You're obviously a nice guy who wants a nice bus, but
you shouldn't invest your time in establishing the value of
a questionable old vehicle. There are too many of them out there.
(big words from a guy who just bought an engineless pickup,
but it was priced, IMHO, appropriately).

	Here's how capitalism works: Your Current Owner has a
bus that doesn't run, that hasn't run in a while. There is a
price for such a thing, and its a small number. You should
offer that small number, or perhaps a little more if you
want to goad the Current Owner, but not much more.
	Current Owner may feel their bus is worth a large
number, and getting it running will justify that number. 
Its up to them to get it running, then. If you can't
afford the large number, tell the Current Owner how to
get in touch with you and walk away.

	Not because you and Current Owner are enemies, or
its a zero sum game or anything like that. You can procede 
in a spirit of cooperative adventure. You can make a friend
for life. But the cash value of a thing is only what
a willing seller will take from a willing buyer. Not
the $27,000 the seller needs for grandmother's operation,
not the $5.76 you have in your pockets now.

	You can't be good to yourself *and* pay more for
a vehicle than you can turn around and sell it for yourself.
You can 'give' the owner a gift of money if you want, but
that's separate.

	Now, on the day you buy it, what can you sell this
bus for? That's your offer price. If the owner makes it
work, then the price goes up. If you're working on it,
then you're giving your labor to the Current Owner,
who will presumably then charge you more money for the
vehicle.

	If you really want to see it work, then negotiate
the price NOW, get it in writing, contingent on the car
being made to work (be specific) and then have at it.

	After my wife died, things were really rough, and
they're completely better, 3 years later. But right after, I
went to visit a friend in Hawaii, and he took me to Makenna
Beach where I body-surfed for about six hours. As the sun was
going down, I realized that I couldn't stay in the water
until *all* the good waves had come in- there would always
be another wave. Then I thought about my broken 914 waiting
for me back in California, and I realized that I needed to
sell it and spend the effort somehwere else. I realized that
there will always be another sports car. Finally, I thought
about Lori's death, and our life together, and I realized
that there might even be another woman in my life, someday.
	Then the three best waves of the day came in,
and I ran like hell to get back into the water and ride them.
And I did!
