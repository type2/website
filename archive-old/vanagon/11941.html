&gt; The little 3 terminal thing in the back of the gauge assembly is a voltage

&gt; on it gets 12V dc from battery. Another is ground and the 3rd is the regulated
&gt; output. I believe the output should be kept at about 6volt. Use the VOM
&gt; the check the output. If it fluctuates like your gauge then it is the part
&gt; that is defective.

The voltage stabilizer output should be 10 volts (9.5-10.5 O.K.)
It sure looks like an electronic thingy to me :)

Bentley also describes the checking of the fuel guage using VW tool 1301
(hello Derek), which when set at &quot;55&quot; the fuel gauge should read full, and
when set at &quot;560&quot; the guage should read empty.
What do those numbers mean?
Is it voltage?, current? or resistance?
