Subject: A/C DUCTS, BIG SUR, GOOD WRECKYARD


All-

	I get the digest form of the vanagon list, so for good or ill 
I'm gonna reply to a few things in batch form...

	Thanks to all of you who have welcomed me so warmly- I know 
why my brother likes this list!

AIR CONDITIONING REMOVAL-

	Steve, I don't have the ducts anymore- I chucked 'em when I 
took them out, mainly because I had no place to store them. Oh well.

	And yes, a number of you have pointed out that I do not live 
in a HOT climate- you're absolutely right, as home is Santa Clara, CA.
If I lived in Phoenix, or Atlanta, or wherever, I'd have kept the A/C.

BIG SUR CAMPOUT-

	Unfortunately, I won't be able to make the Big Sur campout in 
January- too bad. Oh well, I'll give my brother a picture of us and 
Big Blue up in Yosemite a week ago- he can share that with you.

	The casual seminars sound like a great idea- sorry I'm gonna 
miss this. Somebody should ask my brother Bill about the time he and I 
changed all four CV boots and two joints on his Rabbit. Hint- 
alternating Coca Cola and Budweiser through a long afternoon of grease 
wallowing is a bad combo... but we got the car back together OK!

GOOD WRECKYARD-

	If anyone in northern California is interested, A-German Auto 
Salvage in San Jose almost always has a good selection of buses and 
Vanagons in stock. The older guy who owns the place can be a pain to 
deal with- not too bad, though- but his son is much more relaxed. 
Check it out!

	HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYBODY!
