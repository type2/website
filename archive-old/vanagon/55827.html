Hey all,

Just got my copy of Wired this afternoon. On page 69 in the &quot;Fetish&quot;
column is an article that describes a new record player called The Vinyl
Killer. It is shaped like a split window bus. It holds a speaker, amp
and drive motor. Just place it on the record and the van drives in
circles playing the record.  US$70. Not great for your records according
to the article.
