Subject: Re: vented door handles


&gt;There is a very effective ventilating and heating system.  Fresh air is
&gt;supplied through six outlets controllable from the dash with two
&gt;supplying the windshield, two outlets in the dashboard, and two
&gt;supplying the rear compartment through ducts located on the inside of
&gt;the front doors where they also double as arm rests.
&gt;
&gt;There are pictures of this setup in my owners manual as well, but
&gt;there are no ducts on the doors....looks like there is some
&gt;aftermarket doorhandles as well as the original strap. Were the
&gt;ducts on non-Westy models only? Were the door handles aftermarket?
&gt;(they are in rough shape, and I'd like to replace them, but
&gt;of course haven't been able to find any).
&gt;
&gt;Curious.

My 71 also is lacking the rear ventalation system.  Mine's a camper too.
