Subject: Wanted! 1600cc Vanagon Engine Case- REALLY!


Hey there-

	OK, I'm crazy- please hear me out!

	Maybe someone reading this list in the UK, or Australia, or 
somewhere else can help me get my hands on an otherwise unobtainable 
engine case.

	What I'm seeking is the 1600cc (gas, carb) Vanagon case. 
	And NO, it's NOT just a beetle or &quot;universal&quot; case!

	Wait! Before those here in the US tell me that there 'taint no 
such thing, I KNOW it exists in Europe. I've seen Vanagons and 
Transporters with 1600cc air cooled gas engines in France, when I was 
there on business, and in the Haynes manual for the '80-83 Vanagon. 
(Remember, the Haynes books are produced in the UK, so they show all 
kinds of cool-man things that we can't get in the US. These engines 
were sold as &quot;economy&quot; models- 1600cc, single carb, kinda Type 
III-style intake runners, if I remember right.

	But- WHY THE HELL DO I WANT ONE OF THESE THINGS?

	To build a UNIQUE engine for my '69 Beetle! 
	(No, NOT for my '88 Wasserboxer! I'm crazy, not stupid!)

	These cases have *cast-in provision* for full-flow oil filters! 
Yeah, yeah, I KNOW there's all kinds of other ways to add full-flow 
filters to the Type I/II/III engine, but this would be UNIQUE and WAY 
COOL, in my opinion.

	So, can ANYONE in Europe, Australia, or maybe even Canada help 
me get ahold of a good, used 1600 Vanagon engine case? I'd pay 
whatever it cost you (presumably at your local wrecker), plus whatever 
it cost to ship, plus something for your time and trouble, if needed!

	Thanks in advance!
