&gt; Subject:       Re: O2 sensors: 1-wire to replace 3-wire?

&gt; Hi.  I've asked around for the last few days, and every parts store is 
&gt; telling me that not just any three-wire sensor will do.  Are they all 
&gt; just rying to sell me a more expensive part.  I've heard that some have 
&gt; different threading and different temp. ratings.  Anyway, does anyone 
&gt; here know the deal for sure?  I've asked a few parts stores for a generic 
&gt; 3-wire sensor, and they claim not to have one.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get back on the road, so any help would be appreciated.

My BMW uses a 3-wire Bosch O2 sensor also.  I discovered about 2 
years ago that theBosch 3-wire for the 87 Ford Mustang is the same 
one for the BMW. . . . but a lot, lot cheaper (about $55.)  I would 
suggest you go to a FLAPS and look at the VW one and the Ford one and 
I'll bet that there is no difference.  The Ford Bosch has worked fine 
in my BMW w/ no problems.  Many, many members of the BMW-Digest use 
this solution on their cars.

Happy Motoring,
