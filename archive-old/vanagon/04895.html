On a related note, 
my '87 is being used for my daily commute, about 125 miles round trip.
The traffic is usually light, so it usually gets to do a very steady
4,200 rpm all along (at the border of the green zone on the tach).

Does this explain anything about the coolant level behavior?  In general,
is running the engine at a steady 4200 rpm bad for it?  How often should
I change the oil?  (as it turns out, the oil barely changes any color
at 3,000 miles)....


Thanks,
Cetin
