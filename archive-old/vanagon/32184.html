Subject: Re: EV Winnebago Defrosting - LACK OF

Hello Bill:

The problem seems to be that the EV taken for
modifications by Winnebago is the base Transporter,
sans creature comforts (or in this case, safety
measures).

There seems to be no provision for rear heating
whatsoever - no dual controls, no vent as described
by you.  In my 1988 Westy, not only was there a
core in the box under the rear seat, but there
was a duct running in the housing where the sliding
door ran, with head level outlets.  There is no
equivalent in the EV-Winne.

There is A/C.  Can't wait for the hot, humid weather
to find that it only reaches the front seats!

Dan

P.S.  The frugality shows in a few other things - the
cabin lights lack the &quot;courtesy delay&quot; and other rather
trivial stuff.

&gt; What did Winnebago do to ruin the EV?  I just drove my EV 
MV home in a

Windsheild wipers 
&gt; and defrosting are not the best but heck it was a 
near-blizzard.

&gt; What does the Winnie put behind the front passenger seat? 
 Thats where VW 
&gt; ran the heater vent.  Right on the 2&quot; step between the 
front and rear floor.
&gt; 

&gt; Does the Winnie have the two place controls?  One heater 
and one A/C for 
&gt; front and another for the rear.
