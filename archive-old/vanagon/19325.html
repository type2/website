Subject: WHAT'S  GOING ON? (With bus prices?)

Well, my brother is getting another 15-window deluxe. (To add to his
`59 23-window I guess.) for putting a clutch in a `76 bus. I'm getting
a `71 westy for 50$. Are these prices comparable to other parts of the
country, or are we just 2 lucky bastards? It seems that almost everyone
is dumping their `project' busses up here!! (We are in the rust belt,
after all!)
A couple of months ago, we couldn't buy junk busses for &lt;2K!
