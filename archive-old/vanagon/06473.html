Seriously envious...

 
&gt; Maybe in the spring (Nov.-March being out for most of
&gt; us in the Heartland) the rest of us might want to give
&gt; a gathering a whirl?  Yes anybody?  Wisconsin, Minnesota,
&gt; So. Dakota, and, yes, even parts of Iowa have some very
&gt; pretty state parks.  In my part of the world y'all could
&gt; even go see the real bridges of Madison County!
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts?

That sounds like a lot of fun.  My wife would enjoy seeing the bridges --
even though she thought the guy in the book was a real jerk. 

I went to school in Iowa (Iowa Wesleyan in Mt. Pleasant) and it would be fun
to have a reason to visit again. 

Doesn't this conflict to some degree with the plans for the big trip?
I can't spend my entire spring driving to meet with VW people.  I have a 
life!
