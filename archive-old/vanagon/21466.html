Subject: Re: Tin &amp; Generators

&gt;since I will have to replace to it if I can't find this spring.  Where
&gt;does one find cheap generators?  Cheapest I can find mail order is
&gt;about $145.  For that price I will switch to an alternator.  Anybody
&gt;have a known good one laying around?  How about a voltage regulator?
&gt;I don't really have $30 for one of those either.  Thanks, Jim

        J.C. Whitney has Gens. for $54.95, V. Regs. for $11.95, shipping
will run about $10. Phone is (312) 431-6102. I recently found my gen for
$49 from Hi/Lo auto parts, v. reg for 15 from Western auto. Gen. came w/
lifetime warranty. I don't work for any of these guys, just like to find
deals on parts...

Peace,
