Ric,

Suzanne and I are going. Should be a blast, parading around town 
and hanging out with a bunch of other veedubers. I haven't seen 
a split that was in great condition for a loooong time (did see 
a split a couple of months ago that was in need of some TLC,
the driver's seat springs were showing, ouch). 

Are you going to coordinate an East Coast Gathering or will it
be a show up and hope for the best???
