&gt; What do ya mean, something for everybody?  There's not a single
&gt; Type 4 on that list!

I *am* glad that someone actually read the post.  I took
into consideration that this is a Type II discussion list
when I typed the ads.  If you really want a Type IV, Rodney,
I suspect I could have found one for you, but my fingers
were tired.

&gt; I've noticed this phenomenon in many of these classifieds
&gt; rags--several buses listed, but none from about 74 through 83...  Now
&gt; why is that?  Can anyone explain?

Maybe someone with a 74 through 83 can answer.  I have '67s
and an '84.

&gt; Are they so good that no-one is
&gt; selling them, or are they so lousy that no-one could afford to keep
&gt; them till 1996?

I think the answer to that question is YES, depending on the
PO.  If the PO took good care of them, they're not for sale.
If the PO beat it up, it's for sale cheap.
