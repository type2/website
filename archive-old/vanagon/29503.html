Subject: Hot Showers &amp; Snow Camping


To All:

Here's one for the Crazy Idea Archive.

Certain members of the list believe a hot shower is a necessity of life.  

If you'll accept that ten minutes of hot water constitutes a shower it may be
possible to provide for that using a regular VW Transporter.

The idea involves an insulated non-corrosive metal tank holding twenty
gallons and capable of withstanding 30 psi.  The tank is plumbed to the #1 &amp;
#3 exhaust manifolds where a coil of stainless steel tubing is fabricated
around the exposed portion of the exhaust pipe, just before it enters the
heat exchanger.  The coils are plumbed to the water tank, inlet at he bottom,
outlet at the top so as to permit thermosyphoning.  This is best accomplished
using small diameter tubing at the cold outlet, larger diameter for the hot
inlet of the tank.  Additional plumbing runs from the bottom of the tank to a
mixing valve and hose bib mounted at some point conveniet to the tank and the
side/rear of the vehicle.  A convenient filler must be provided, one that
will withstand 30 psi.

A second water tank for cold water is provided.  It may be at any location
and may be of plastic pipe or fiberglas -- something strong enough to
withstand 30 psi.  The cold water tank is plumbed to the mixer valve.  A
convenient filler must be provided.

Both tanks are plumbed to a source of compressed air.  This may be a tank of
air pumped up during normal driving by a vacuum driven air compressor.  The
air tank should withstand up to 100 psi and should contain at least 4 cubic
feet at that pressure.  A fixed 30 psi regulator is attached to the output,
from which air goes to both of the water tanks.

The hot water tank is filled before the days run.  Thermo syphoning should
heat the twenty gallons of water to the boiling point in about four hours,
after which it would vent to the atmosphere when pressure rose above 30 psi.

The cold water tank is not filled until the end of the days run.

To shower, the enclosure is erected, a hand-held shower nozzle is attached to
the hose bib and the tanks are pressurized by opening the valve from the air
tank.  The temperature of the water may be thermostatially controlled by the
mixer valve or manually controlled by those with a death wish.

Twenty gallons of water weighs about 160 lbs and occupies slightly more than
3 cubic feet.  A tank having the least surface handles pressure best  but a
sphere is difficult to fabricate and mount.  A square tank about 18 inches on
a side would hold a bit more than 20 gallons.

The cold water tank could be fabricated from 3&quot; stainless steel exhaust pipes
secured to the underside of the vehicle.

Vacuum-driven air-compressors are available from J. C. Whitney for about $65.
 A pressured system would be less complex than one using pumps and would
place no demand on the vehicle's electrical system.

Assuming a mixing ratio of 1:1, which is probably wrong, 30 psi is more than
enough to force 40 gallons of water through 3/8&quot; tubing at a rate of 4
gallons per minute, ie, a ten-minute shower.

Since the system uses only waste heat and manifold pressure, once fabricated
the cost of operation is zero although there will be some slight reduction in
miles per gallon due to the added weight of the water and equipment.
Snow Camping

Twenty gallons of boiling water represents a considerable quantity of heat.
 If the van is well insulated, that quantity of hot water pumped through a
small heat exchanger such as a dog-house style oil cooler, should be enough
to maintain a shirt-sleeve environment in the camper for several hours.  The
water would have to be pumped and a biscuit-fan would be needed to blow air
through the heat exchanger but the flow-rate and thus the energy consumption
would be relatively low, probably less than 3 amps.  

Solar heating suppliers carry 12vdc pumps suitable for hot-water pumps.
 Twelve-volt biscuit or muffin fans are widely available.  

The water in such a system would have to be protected from freezing.  The
plumbing runs, which may be of either copper or stainless steel, should be
thermally insulated.

It would be a simple matter to control such a heater with a thermostat.
