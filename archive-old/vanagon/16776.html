Subject: Canvas Cot Conundrum...


An interesting question (to me alone?)-

	My 78 Westfalia has mounts for a canvas &quot;baby cot&quot; to rest above 
the cab area...  Is this standard on late model Westys?
	I've seen em on plenty of earlier campers, so my question is:  
will an early (Late 60's/ early 70's) cab-area canvas cot fit into the 
mounts on my 78?
	I'd find out for myself, but I don't see the buggers every day.

	Muchas gracias!
	
	Jeff
