I was going to post that question to the list.  When I took my wheels off 
I cleaned 'em with WD40 and put a bunch of antisieze compound on them.  I 
wasn't sure if it was right or not, but with over 100 lbs of torque on 
them, I wouldn't think that a little antisieze compound would let them 
come off, and it sure would be nice if NEXT time I didn't have to break 
my back to get them off.

I'm still in the bike biz, but I leave the Phil Wood green stuff for the 
bike.
