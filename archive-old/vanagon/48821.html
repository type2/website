Subject: Re: Help: Oil Pressure Light ('89 Vangagon)

And so Douglas said:

&gt; If your oil light flickers; you need a rebuild.

Or change the oil, or change the filter, or find out why it's overheating, 
or check the fit of the OP relief plungers, or... you -might- need a rebuild. 
Also, i was not responding to the original post, i just used the subject
line, in fact, i haven't even read the original post.

&gt; If you think a higher oil pressure switch setting will protect your engine, 
&gt; you are mistaken.

I did not say that an OP warning light can protect an engine.

The oil pressure warning light system is meant to warn the the driver in case
the oil pressure drops below a specific, unallowable, value. That's why VW, 
and most other car manufacturers, put it on their cars.

&gt; Whatever causes your engine to go down, it has happened long 
&gt; before your pressure drops;&gt;(

What does 'Whatever causes your engine to go down' include? I do not think 
that all engine failures result in/of low OP.

I think that serious engine damage can be avoided if the driver shuts down 
the engine immediately after he sees the OP light come on. The keyword is
speed. The sooner the light comes on the sooner the driver can react.

It is possible to have a low OP while the engine is in perfect condition, 
think of leaking oilfilter hoses, a loose oilfilter, a loose or missing 
oilgallery plug, a leaking oilpump cover, drainplug etc. Either OP drops 
as an immediate result of a leak or, when it's a small leak, the engine 
looses so much oil that the oil level drops below the pick up tube or,
the oil light lights up when cornering, stopping or pulling up, also
indicating that the oil level in the sump is too low. The keyword is speed. 
The sooner the driver is informed, the more likely it is that he can avoid 
serious engine damage.

A 'heavier' than stock OP switch will inform the driver sooner than the stock 
switch, thus the driver knows sooner and will react sooner. Of course, if you
choose a switch that switches above the idle OP, the light will light up when 
your engine idles, so the new switch can not be much heavier than stock unless
you add it to your stock system, include an extra light actuated by the 
heavier sender and leave the stock sender and light in place, now you have a 
two stage OP warning system.

I, personally, would replace the stock switch with a heavier switch instead 
of adding a second system because i have a higher than stock OP, because i 
like to keep my car as simple as possible, and because i want to make sure 
that every part of my engine is the best, most suitable, i can get for a
specific function. I will test different switches in the near future on my
1776 with 30mm Berg pump, custom ball valve OP relief valves, oil filter and 
stock DH oil cooler. I also have another motor, also with ball valves but with 
a 21mm pump, maybe i'll do some in-car tests with it.

As always, if i discover things that might be valuable to others, i will post
them to the lists. When i saw the Bosch catalog on OP switches i thought it
was worth investigating, so i shared my thoughts. I have had the OP light come 
on while driving in several VWs, some of my own, some of customers, in every 
single case i shut down the engine immediately, ivestigated and solved what 
was wrong, none of these motors had suffered so much that they needed a 
complete rebuild because of it, although it might have been possible to find
evidence of oil starvation on the bearings.
