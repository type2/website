&gt;We decide to bag it and pull into another 
&gt;friendly KOA instead.  Sshhh... All the RV'ers are asleep.  Soon, we are too.
&gt;
&gt;

i paid $21.95 bux for a site at a KOA campground, it was only a parking
space, no electricity, no water.  Isn't this steep, I wasn't really
complaining about it because we found $110 on the trails that day, and we
wanted to crash, heehee what a night...
