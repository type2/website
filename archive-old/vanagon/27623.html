&gt; Sure, if you go to the shop to have it done, it will cost plenty! But since the

&gt; $30.00 figure is what a local shop charges me to thrust cut a bare case.
&gt; If this is a used engine that Joe purchased and is just swapping flywheels, then 
&gt; he should get his money back!

Bob also pointed out that it's a Type I engine and not a Vanagon which I
was not aware of since he didn't mention it in his note.

(Assumptions got me again.)
Sorry.
