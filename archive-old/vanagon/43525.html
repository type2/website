Subject: 	RE: FS: propane tank for early Westfalia




&gt;
&gt; Please reread my mail.

i don't understand. i have deleted the orignal posting but i recall that it 
said
something to the effect of &quot;contact me for privatley for more details&quot; 
which is
what i am doing.

i was curious to know what year the tank was &quot;correct&quot; for that is all.
