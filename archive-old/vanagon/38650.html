Subject: Vanagon Paint questions

hi y'all,
Couple of questions about vanagon paint jobs (on an 87 westy).

1. were stock poptops ever painted to match body color? I saw one like this
(in red), but thought they were always white (w/black trim). Is this the sign
of a 2nd paint job, or did some have custom choice to match paint body and
pop?

2. How much would it cost to get a reasonably good job (for both?)

thanks for any help here... and if anyone happens to have
done the job themselves, or knows a great resource for such,
would love to know.  :)
