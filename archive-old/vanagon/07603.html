&gt; Cartoon Laws of Physics
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; Cartoon Law I
&gt; =============
&gt; Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made
&gt; aware of its situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.
&gt; He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he
&gt; chances to look down.  At this point, the familiar principle
&gt; of 32 feet per second per second takes over.

BZZZZTT!  Sorry, this is wrong.  When Daffy/Wile. E./etc look down,
they instantly accelerate to a high rate of speed, and remain at 
that speed for their entire trip.  Glad I could clear that up, hehe...


&gt; Cartoon Law IX
&gt; ==============
&gt; Everything falls faster than an anvil.

Corollary:  Everything except an anvil falls faster than a baby grand.


Oh, I replaced my front passenger seat yesterday with a bucket seat from
a 73 Capri.  I intend to replace the drivers seat next weekend.  My
original seats are in decent shape... does anyone want them?  I could
bring them to the January campout.  If not, they are destined for the
dumpster.  They are standard black vinyl 73 bus seats, not very comfortable.
The passenger one looks great, no rips, but the filling stuff is
disintigrating.  Ditto the drivers seat, and it has a couple of small tears.

I know I should have posted this under a more appropriate subject, but:

1.  I needed some VW content in this post, and

2.  People who don't read *every* post from vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
    in its entirity (sp?) don't deserve my seats!

Cheers,
