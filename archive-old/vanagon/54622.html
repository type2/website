&lt;&lt; Anyone know if the master and slave are rebuildable?  My parts guy
 claims they are not!  He does have factory rebuilds in stock though for
 about $100 a pop.  If they are rebuildable where does on aquire a
 rebuild kit?
 
 Thanks in Advance

The slave on my 85 was rebuilt 1 1/2 years ago.  No problem.  Kit cost was
high though (35) considering it came with only a sealing ring and bellows
that didn't fit.  The master has not failed yet.
