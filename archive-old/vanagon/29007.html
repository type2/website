Subject: 77 Westfalia questions

Hello Vanagon! 

I'm brand new to the list and am grateful to have found it.
I have some questions for the priesthood.
 
1)  My 77 Westfalia has the infamous [hot]starter/solenoid problem.
[Actually now it doesn't even have to be hot.  I can fix it temporarily
by jumping the terminals on the solenoid or by getting a jump from
another car.  The lights dim when the key is turned to the start
position, but nothing happens.]  I have been snooping through FAQ's
etc. and have gotten a look at the starter relay solution.
    
     a) Is this fix considered permanent?
     b) Since the presumed culprit is the wiring!?, wouldn't replacing 
        the wiring harness be a good idea? Why can't I find a wiring
        harness advertised for this year model? [Or where can I find one].

2)  The original owner replaced the fuel injection with dual carburetors.
Insofar as my prime objective is to &quot;restore&quot; this bus to dependable 
[go on long trips with least problems] condition, would it:  
  
     a) Be a good idea to replace the fuel injection? 
        Is this possible/desirable/outrageously expensive? 
     b) Keep and improve the dual carb setup. 
     c) Any other suggestions eagerly accepted. 
 
3)  I live in South West Georgia.  The closest city is Tallahassee. 
     Does anyone have suggestions for: 
 
     a) VW garages in this area (or in the SouthEast generally)
     b) Body/Paint shops  


Thanks in advance for any advice or insights.
