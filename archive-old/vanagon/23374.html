Subject:       Oil lIght Curiosities

HEy:

A couple of days ago, when parking the BUS (84 vanagon GL 101,234)
The oil light flickered on. It never came fully on, just flickered on 
and off. It did this three times (three point parking in a bus is 
always fun).  I had my mechanic look at it. (The oil sender sensor 
was just recently replaced) He let it sit at idle for 1 hour. Then he 
drove it fast then slow. Then he parked it. Nothing. He has had it 
for three days now and cannot figure it out. Any suggestions? 

Thanks

Matt
