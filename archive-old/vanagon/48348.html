Subject: Web Page Update/Stats/Listserv Help

        I have added pix of Sacramento's Mystery Barndoor.  Its a '54 panel,
purchased in Washington for $1700, bringing the Sacramento barndoor
population to 8.  The owner will be &quot;outed&quot; sometime in the future.  In the
meantime, he lurks among us... http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/barndoor.html  

        On to the listserv.  I'm trying to set up listserv under SunOS
4.1.3.  I've run into to some problems building it, partially because I do
not have a real development enviro on this machine.  Anyone know if there
are pre-compiled binaries for this for the SunOS platform?  Or how about
Majordomo?  I don't have a preference...

        Why?  Those forwarding-thinking people may have made a link between
my job as a SysAdmin, my love for busses, and a request for list server
software...
