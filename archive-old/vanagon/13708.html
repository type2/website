&gt;However, what surprised me is that there was another Winnebago Eurovan
&gt;conversion at the show as well.  This was a much larger vehicle that was
&gt;truly a small motorhome, including a 110V generator etc..  Somehow, I can't
&gt;imagine the 2.5 liter engine even making this thing move, since other
&gt;vehicles of this size have hefty V8's.  And, it only came in an automatic!
&gt;The big one had a sticker price of $46,000 and was on sale for $42,000.  Has
&gt;any of you folks seen or driven the behemoth?

the 'Bago Behemoth is really called a Rialta ... it's just a different rear
end grafted onto the same eurovan chassis. it's been &quot;tested&quot; in one of the
RV magazines. and just last night, Motorweek (the tv show) was talking about
their long term test of one ... only 2500 miles so far, with average mpg of
13.5 ... can you say heavvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvy? :)

and it really does have the same engine! zero-to-sixty in the same week!! :)
