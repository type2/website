Subject: Flooding at start

*4
84 Vanagon
Symptomes:	Hard starting when egine is warm... Inspection of
plugs and odor clearly shows that the engine is flooding. 

Solution if quick fix is needed... crwl oops crawl under van.
Disconnect power to fuel pump.  Start car oops van,  run back under
van reconnect power to li  pump(you will have about 5 seconds to do this)

Semipermanent fix or conjectured fix.  Checked all grounds, unplugged
ECU and plugged back in.  Unplugged coolant temp cleaned off 
corrosion. plugged back in.  Van starts in all conditions and is
running great!  25mpg.

Conjecture?  Temperature sensor not able to send signal that engine was
warm .  ECU had only one choice and that was to tell the injectors that
the engine was cold and thus to send more fuel?  How's that sound?
