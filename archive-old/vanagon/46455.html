&gt; I go down I-5, people look at me like im a kook or something (please, don't

That's a point - have to say, though that Westy drivers seem to be the 
exception to that rule. When I was up tooling around in the Catskills 
this month in the rusty but trusty '71 I got plenty of grins and waves 
from the many Waterboxer-Westies full of families bouncing around up 
there; when I pulled up in front of Bud's Cafe at the same time as a 
sleek (sleek? maybe I meant shiny) late-model Vanagon, I gave the owner 
a grin and a good morning. She looked back at me like I was something 
out of Deliverance.

Of course, I found out later that she was working on a movie up there - 
maybe she was one of these paranoid big-city types who think that small 
towns are full of cannibals and tax evaders. :)
