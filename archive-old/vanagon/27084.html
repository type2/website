Subject: /f thank you for my neuroses

To All:

Last night i Dreamed that i and my family were driving to Albe State 
Park (none exists of course but the name was very clear) in our Titan 
Red '87 Westy (yup, i Dream in color) when suddenly we came upon a 
tanker truck parked cross-wise in the road ahead of us.  I saw it too 
late to stop and drove right under it.  Just as we went under the 
belly of the truck i was thinking &quot;We're gonna make it!  We'll go 
right under.&quot; when we felt the splintering crash of fiberglass 
impacting steel.  I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw a snowshower 
of fiberglass fibers, twinkling like ice crystals in the air.  

None of this would've happened without you... the thoughts of van 
height, horror stories of low underpasses, continual threads on body 
repair and painting.  thank you.  i really must find a new group to 
hang around with.
