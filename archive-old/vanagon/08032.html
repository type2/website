&gt; &gt;The coolant level sensor is simply two probes that stick down into the

&gt; the level sensor can also be fooled by a &quot;concentration failure&quot; of the
&gt; coolant. :)  i.e., if the amount of water-to-coolant gets too far the
&gt; &quot;wrong&quot; way (i guess it would be too much water?), the LED will blink.
&gt; perhaps it's caused by old weak anti-freeze ... that's lost all its electrons
&gt; and can't pass the current. ;)

&gt; &gt;Now, if I can only figure out why the headlights go off and the radio
&gt; &gt;stays on when I shut off the ignition ...  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; and the parking light stay on. i think it has something to do with the laws
&gt; in germany, about parking on the side of the road. Mercedes has a light
&gt; switch that allows you to not only turn ON the parking lights, but to decide
&gt; if you want (1) Left side parking lights, (2) Right side parking lights, or
&gt; (3) BOTH side parking lights. :) so if you park on the left side of the road,
&gt; you have to turn on only the left side parking lights (to warn other folks
&gt; that you are there).
&gt; 
&gt; and the radio works without the ignition. :)

My Rover TC2000 is wired the same way in regards to the parking lights.  
Made figuring out the headlights a real bear.
