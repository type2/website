Subject: problem w/ re-starting after stalling
From: kdlewis_at_juno_dot_com (kenneth d lewis)

Has anyone experienced: Engine will not restart after stalling*.
Symptoms: Continuos cranking after the fact only produces gas fumes with
no sign of it wanting to start. After I arrive I can get it to start by
holding the throttle wide open and cranking it. After about ten seconds
of turning over it will catch, slowly at first, then faster and faster
until it starts. My wife says this procedure does not work for her
immediately after the fact.
What I've checked: The temp sender, checked for spark using inductive
timing light, carefully opened air box to see if mass air flow vane was
stuck, checked idle position switch.

Vehicle: 85 GL
Engine: Gas, digijet
Action: She threatened to send it to the crusher if strands her one more
time.I think  she was kidding!?!

*Stalling: accidental killing of engine i.e. foot slipping off clutch
starting up an incline,starting with A/C on.
