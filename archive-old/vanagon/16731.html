&gt; I wish no one to get hurt either by vandals, thieves, carelessness, or
&gt; rudeness on the list.


I second the motion on the vandals, thieves, and carelessness.

But if someone here thinks he has been &quot;hurt&quot; by &quot;rudeness&quot;, then I'd
say that _he_ has more of a problem than the &quot;rude&quot; one. Especially when
the sender has not been rude, but only factual.

The original post about how nice the world would be if we didn't need locks
etc., was the silliest kind of dreamy nonsense. I'm about 75% sure the 
writer had to be joking, even though it didn't come across that way. Face
it, none of us are Clavell-caliber writers. But some things just _have_ to
be taken in the spirit with which they were offered. Hence my suggestion
that the writer move to a desert island or Mars-- an equally silly and jocular
offering, which needs no apology.

Come on, ladies and gents. You can't go through life without occasionally
bumping into things, or people. Everyone knows it, and we all have our
tolerance levels set to &quot;moderate&quot;. Rusty VanBondo's posts are great humor,
nicely moderated, and IMHO we are far better off with them than without.

Don't worry, be happy! And Rusty, don't change a thing!
