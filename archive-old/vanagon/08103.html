Subject: Upgrade valves on a 2 liter rebuild?

It looks like my '76 Westfalia is going to need to have the engine rebuilt.
 Does anyone know if it's worth having hydrolic(sp?) valve lifters
installed.  It costs more, but does it make the engine last longer, require
less maintanence or anything like that?  Or should I just go with the
original specs.   Are there any other modifications I can do at this tme to
make a better engine?
