&gt;The body style is what I recognize as a'72-79 US model (cassis # 224
&gt;xxxx xxx), but the engine is
&gt;obviously a single port upright with a motorola alternator and a 009
&gt;(aftermarket) distributor, not to mention so much emissions
&gt;gadgetry that at first I thought I was looking at a Chevy Citation
&gt;(no offense, Steve. Thats really what it reminds me of).

Not me. What's emissions gadgetry?    :^)
