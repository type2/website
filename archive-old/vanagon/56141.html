Subject: 85 westfalia gas tank

  Would someone from this group please help me with information.

  I had to remove the gas tank from my 85 westfalia to check the fuel
gauge sending unit in the top of the tank. Now I am looking for advice
for putting the gas tank back without creating a fire hazard.

The order of events to reinstall the tank appears to be:

1) Replace the 3 vent and overflow seals with new ones.
   Replace the fill pipe seal with a new one.
   (lightly coat the seals with oil before installing).
2) Lift the front of the tank and rest the leading edge on the support rail.
3) Reconnect the fuel level sender electrical connector.
4) Lift the rear of the tank to its final position.
5) While supporting the rear of the tank, insert the gas tank supports 
   into the slots in the rear rail, then raise the front of the supports
   and bolt them to the front support rail.
6) Reach over the top of the tank and insert the 2 overflow hoses and the
   vent hose into the grommet seals in the top of the tank. This is done
   by feel alone. There is an overflow hose on either side of the tank,
   and the vent pipe is on the right side of the tank with the filler pipe.
7) Insert the filler pipe into its grommet seal on the side of the tank 
   and screw the filler pipe opening to the frame.

 + Am I missing anything?

 + Is this sequence correct?

 + Is there anything I need to be aware of to keep the tank from becoming a 
   fire hazzard?

 + Is there an easier way to put the overflow tank lines back in the grommets
   in the top of the tank? It appears that I have to put them back in after
   the tank is mounted back in place.

Bob
