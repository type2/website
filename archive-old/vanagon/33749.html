&gt;Does anyone know where to get those Farfenugan &lt;sp&gt; stickers from?  I saw a
&gt;sticker that said 'Barelygruven'.  I've got to get this for my Vanagon.  It=
s
&gt;got no power compared to most other cars on the road.

        The Fahrvergn=FCgen sticker could be obtained at the local VW dealer
a couple of years ago when I got mine. Stoped to ogle the VolksBaggo (or
WinneWagon?) vans, asked at the parts counter, and got 2 license plate
frames and the sticker for free. This was at the VW dealer in Encinitas,
CA, and was a while back, but it's worth a try at your local dealer.
Nowaday's they'll probably have &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; stickers...

Peace,
