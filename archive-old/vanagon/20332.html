&gt; This is directed primarily to those bus owners of the 1968 to 1979
&gt; group, though I suspect that the same kind of thing could happen in
&gt; all years.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed a week or so ago that the shift lever was a little loose,
&gt; well, not loose really; but I could feel the whole engine or maybe the
&gt; transmission move when I let out the clutch. Kind of like when the
&gt; upper two bolts that hold the engine case to the transmission bell
&gt; housing are missing. So I checked. All four bell housing bolts were
&gt; good and tight. And the rear engine mounts are fine. So, what is the
&gt; problem?
&gt; 
 I am having the same problem on my '67, and indeed the problem has been
traced to a faulty nose-cone mount, which I have already ordered a
replacement for $5.00 or so.
I hope to fix this soon, as the current condition is damaging the nose
cone.
