Subject: Used parts sale


 I was out to Bud's Bugs today (a VW wrecking yard in Concord, CA) and
 Bud said he was having a &quot;$20 sale&quot; meaning, he said, that anything
 in the yard except complete engines was $20 or less, you pull the
 part.

 He has about a dozen vans and busses in various states of disrepair.
 I'm planning on going back out tomorrow afternoon to check out some
 seats I might want to buy.  If anybody has some specific bus/van part
 needs, let me know and I'll try to see if he has what you want.
 Maybe we can work out a mutually profitable relationship!!

 The phone number is 510-825-8338 if you want to deal with Bud
 directly.

 Usual disclaimers apply.
