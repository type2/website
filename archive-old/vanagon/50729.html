I stopped in at the only authorized Eurovan Camper dealer in Ohio this
afternoon (Midwestern Auto Group in Dublin).  They had two '97s, one with a
middle seat, one without. They had no literature on the '97s.  The salesman
said that they will only have automatic transmissions in '97.  Plans are for
all to be white, but may have another color next year.  Inside the
dealership, the EV Camper was in good company with a couple of Porsche
Carrera Cabriolets and a Ferrari.
