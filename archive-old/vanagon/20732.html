&gt; &gt;I have an 82 Vanagon, just got it a month ago. When is the proper time to 
&gt; &gt;check the oil, when it is cold or after it has been running for awhile???
&gt; 
&gt; When cold, check your oil with the Wanagon parked on a level surface.  I
&gt; check mine every morning before I use it.  If the oil level is between the
&gt; two marks on the dipstick you're OK
&gt; 
&gt; When the engine is warm and/or you've been drivin' it awhile, let it sit for
&gt; about 5 or 6 minutes before checking it.  Let all the oil drain back into the
&gt; sump from the nooks and crannies (Thomas' Muffins?).


I do exactly the same thing as Jim on my '82. The worst thing you can do is 
over-fill the crankcase, because excess could blow out the tailpipe and gum up 
your catalytic converter. I've had heard this is the most common cause of 
cat-death (of the non-feline variety....).
