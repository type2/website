Subject: transmission woes

ok I covered all my bases trying to get a used/rebuilt/working
transmission for &quot;money pit&quot; 89 westie 78k, (synchro gear problem) the
only people that would work on it waS the dealer. They would charge
$1200 to replace the synchro and while the tranny was in its most
vulnerable position they would add for anything else that might be
damaged :&lt; ... I found a wrecking yard with one for $1200 no telling
what or where the condition would be....searched the archives and send
some e-mail and was recommended a place in California that rebuilds and
sells . Here is their story..They would send an '82 tranny complete with
all retrofits to fit &quot;money pit&quot; for 695 plus a 199 core charge. Gary
claims that the '82 was a much more better design than the new ones. If
I want an exact replacment the price was 700 plus a 400 core charge, and
it would probably not last as long as the older one.. I asked him about
the drivshaft angles causing more wear on the cv joints and if I would
have any problems with the modifications(thanks joel)..he assured me he
does this all the time and has very good luck..I decided to call these
guys first (800) and after a couple of attempts I got through, discussed
the problem and ordered my transmission. When I asked the dealer how
much a factory rebuilt trans would cost he told me 2400...I told him I
did not want to buy his dealership just a transmission. I told him I
orderd one through the internet for 800 dollars..he just said go for it
and turned around and tried to sell another BMW to someone else...anyway
the local import repair shop will charge me 175 to drop the old tranny
and install the new one all in all includeing a core charge (which I
should get MOST of it back) I will have payed 1000 for my rebuilt
trans..The good thing is since I do the computer work for the used car
dealer and I often cut them some slack on my billing they have agreed to
pay for half the amount...so I am sure I will have an extra 3 bucks to
contribute.

PS
the outfit i bought the transmissin from was
Transform in California,
at (800) 508-7267.  
thanks for the recommendation -Ron Salmon
