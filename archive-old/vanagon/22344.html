&gt;&gt;Now for the coolant...'83 1.9 litre wasser boxer...great runner,  great
&gt;&gt;looker....no leakage of coolant any where....no &quot;odor&quot; of coolant from
&gt;&gt;the exhaust...plugs are a little grey {fuel additive}...coolant changed
&gt;&gt;yearly,  phosphate free.... VW says no leaks and exhaust analyzer shows
&gt;&gt;a healthy engine...why would I be loosing around 500ml of coolant
&gt;&gt;every 1500 miles or so???  It has never done this before in its
&gt;&gt;60K mile life.  Evaporation?  Bastard neighbors messing with my mind?
&gt;&gt;Am I worrying about nothing?  Help!

I had a sneaky leak in one of the steel water pipes, it dripped out of an 
unsightly rust blister only when there was pressure in the system. It 
dripped onto the muffler pipes and vapourized, never getting to the ground. 
I heard it hissing one night right after switching off the motor.
         Get a pressure check? Has anyone done this by stuffing a tire valve 
in the overflow hose and pumping up the system? Seems you could check the 
relief valve also.  tim s.
