&gt;Right about that time, I arrived to help him start the restoration
&gt;..bringing him a vegemite sandwich. Without even thinking, he wolfs it
&gt;down straightaway. It was so good that he even licks his hands,
&gt;*unwittingly* ingesting a few spores.

&gt;As the restoration work begins, he crawls into the westy and begins a
&gt;perilous journey through the ether

Matey Mate.  It wasn't the spores....... Ask any Aussie about the
wondrous properties of vegemite..........
