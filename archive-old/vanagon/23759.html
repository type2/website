Subject: RE: understeer solution?


&gt;Whilst driving on the highway 101 in California last week I noticed
&gt;quite a bit of understeer at speed.  I'm running a stock suspension
&gt;and KYB gas shocks.  It's a bit loose in the corners.
&gt;
&gt;Does the vanagon collective have any advice in this area?


Don't worry, be happy. My '71 was all over the road at speed,
until I replaced the (cheap, worn) tires with 4 new BFG's.
