Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

It's getting a bit out of control isn't it?

I hate to see the list being split. I've met Ric Golen in Brussels
last January. i liked that.  Why am i telling you this? Well, Ric
has an EV and i have a '73, we would never have met if we wouldn't
have been on the same list.

Being VW owners we're still pretty much the same regardless of which
type of Bus we own/drive. We posses the VW attitude. We understand
eachother. It makes us stronger too, we can make stronger statements
to the &quot;off list world&quot; simply because we are larger.

The real thing here is that we have to respect Gerry's point of view,
he *has* to put up with all the list traffic. Others can just delete
messages if it becomes too much, or when it's just inconvenient at a
particular moment. Gerry can't.

Again, i'd hate to see the list split, because V_at_L is V_at_L, but if
adjustments to the concept are neccessary they are just that,
neccessary.

Brian.

PS. Will my list T-shirt still be valid when the list is split?
