1990-94 Legacy, 16Valve, opposed, Excellent for a VW bus, but 
computer controlled.  Length 16.5&quot;, Height 14&quot;, 130HP or 160HP with 
turbo.
Some lenti readers have informed me to expect a junkyard cost for an 
engine with under 1,000 miles to go for $1,000 US.

&gt; Brian,
&gt; 
&gt; In what model and years Subaru can I find a 2.2?
&gt; Kennedy is usually pretty good about providing an
&gt; estimate of the junkyard cost for the engine...any 
&gt; information?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
