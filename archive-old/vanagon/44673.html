&gt;So David Schwarze says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; With new rings in used cylinders, the rings may not seat.  You will have
&gt;&gt; just replaced a perfectly good short block with one that has no
&gt;&gt; compression.  If you get new rings, take the cylinders in and have them
&gt;&gt; honed.  Do not even consider replacing the rings without doing this.  And
&gt;&gt; by the way, it's not easy getting the pistons/rings back into the
&gt;&gt; cylinders.  I've tried twice, and broken a ring twice.  Maybe I'm just
&gt;&gt; clumsy, or maybe it really is something that should be left to the
&gt;&gt; professionals.  I know what I think.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmmm..... I didn't have any problems with replacing mine with no
&gt;cylinder honing.  This was on my '74 camper.  I just rebuilt the
&gt;top end and had the heads rebuilt/replaced.

Somewhere in between these two gentlemen lies the answer for you.  I think
David's right unless the engine has a lot of miles on it, or was overheated.
I should have reused a bunch of cylinder sets that were just fine.  I've
also looked at cylinders that seemed fine, but when cleaned and checked
closely, showed scorching on the inside surfaces of the cylinder.  What is
also true is that keeping the old units clean while dis-assembling the parts
around them is not so easy.  Measure the bore and see if there is detectable
cylinder wear, look for scorching or scratches.  If so, get new ones.  

How many miles are on your reused P/C sets Steven?
