Subject: sway-bars: why not street legal in CA?

Hey guys,

Can't live with the list, can't live without it... :-)

This week's question: I picked up my new rear EMPI sway bar for the bus and
noticed the warning about using it in California. Apparently, &quot;those in
charge&quot; have reason to believe that they may be dangerous. Why? My guess is
that the van reaches its tipping-over point (lift of the inside front
wheel?) with less warning than a stock van. Would anyone with training in
physics care to comment?

Sami

PS: I also replaced the rear shocks with KYB Gas-A-Justs. The old ones were
quite dead and could be compressed and decompressed by hand as easily as a
bicycle pump. Interestingly enough, the usual test consisting of jumping up
and down on the bumper and watch the car settle hadn't revealed anything
wrong.
