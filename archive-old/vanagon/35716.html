Subject: Livin' in the past?

&gt;Dave can you fix your email? We are in '96 not '92!
OK OK Ok so I admit it...I know *&amp;^%4 all about the system I play on...anyway
to all you eagle eyes that are sick of seeing my postings dated 1992 I
think/hope/pray that I managed to get into this lil' machines brain and tell
it to get up to date!
People say looking thru me album collection is like stepping into a time warp
that stopped in '69...so I guess '92 was at least a step forward.
...And Volkswagen is now spelled korektly..
...And....just remember what the dormouse said! (White Rabbit...Airplane)
