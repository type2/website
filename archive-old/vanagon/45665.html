Subject: $5 Bus Parts?! Discount Madness Sale!!

It's Crazy Ron's bus parts bonanza!

Bus Parts for $5?? These prices are insane! Everything must go!

Everything listed below is $5 each (Shipped COD, there will be an added
charge for shipping/COD added).  All proceeds will go to David Schwarze's
Gerry's Beer-A-Thon fund (See  http://www.anet-dfw_dot_com/~ddes/vw/beer-a-thon/)

-Instrument panel (includes Speedo &amp; gas guage with blockoff plate for clock
 for 68-75 Bus -- Grey  face)    $5

-Type III clocks (they don't work now, but with a little time any clever
 vdubber will &quot;wind up&quot; with a VDO clock that fits perfectly in the hole
 next to their speedo [when used with a ring  adapter from busboys--not
 included--or you can fab your own ring])  I have two: $5 each

-Steel oil cooler for Upright engine (1500-1600cc).  I bought this new and
 used it for less than  1,000  miles, then whimsically decided to switch to a
 doghouse style cooler for better cooling.   It's almost new!   $5

-12volt electric &quot;Back Seat Heat&quot; &quot;Heater&quot;. Sold through JC Whitney for $90!
 Crazy Ron won't lie:  this thing makes a nice red glow but don't count on it
 heating your VW.  Use it to prove to your  friends that, amazingly, a 12v
 heater will not heat a VW bus--or come up with your own creative uses
 (external 12v aquarium heater for your bus's tropical fish tank??).  Comes
 with a wiring  harness, switch, and a manual if I can find it.  Guaranteed
 to work, but not to heat  $5

-Rear hatch bug screen for 68-72 Westfalia.  It has three large holes in the
 center, about the size a crayfish could crawl through, but if you don't
park in the water,
 you'll be fine!  Can easily be patched or rescreened.  Snaps in great shape  $5

My inventory is limited (like, this is it)--Hurry while I'm still crazy! Act
now!
