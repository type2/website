Beth or Tom:

        I have the same problem, and I think it was I who wrote
about the increasing negative camber resulting from sagging
springs.............and the concommitant inner tread wear.

        Before contemplating replacing the coils, check out the
price of the new coils for your friendly gouging VW dealer.
Up here they are about C$400 apiece!!!

        Let's talk procedure if you're willing to spend big.

        Remember Shakespeare said in Hamlet, something
 about whether..&quot;twas more noble to shuffle off this mortal 
coil...&quot; or just replace the tyres more frequently...........?   ; )
