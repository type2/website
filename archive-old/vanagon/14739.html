Subject: Re: Whistle sound--Gland nut??f

David,

I had seen a reply about the possibility of the gland nut being loose/making 
noise and had forgotten about that possibility too...  IMO is more H now....  
Look forward to meeting you the next time Martha et.al. head out (assuming that 
it is not too far out from the Bay Area)....

      Jon
