&gt;Howdy.
&gt;
&gt;I hate be real stinker, 


Being a stinker is OK, you're still a long way from me! Trailer hitches were 
last months thread, or was it the month before. Your '70 has a round section 
rear bumper. Try to find a universal clamp-on hitch. They fit over it. It's 
a plate with big threaded &quot;J&quot; hooks, nuts, washers and a ball hitch. Make 
sure your bumper is attached firmly, all 4 big bolts on bumper brackets to 
frame, and good bolts holding bumper to brackets, as this is the only thing 
holding the trailer to you. These are the cheapest hitches I know of, $30 
new maybe. I shop at yard sales for that type of stuff &lt;$5. Use a safety 
chain or two! Check for loosening, as your bumper will flex some, after a 
every few miles first, then at each gas stop if you trust it. Motorcycle 
trailer should be OK, not much more though.    have fun    tim s.
