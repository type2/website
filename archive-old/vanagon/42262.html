Subject: Re: EGR on 1978 2.0L engine questions

Since I've installed a '78 engine in a '73 chassis, the State of
California requires an inspection.  ALL the smog equip. for a '78
has to be on the engine AND working AND correct emission levels.
Money is no object.  No waivers.  Even if parts are obsolete.

Here's a summary of my test results for those that give a rat's ass.
         For those that don't just delete this message.  

Maximum allowable amounts for '78 2.0L f.i. State of Calif (at idle)
units=ppm
HC  250
CO%   3.50

---------
23Apr1996  Result: FAIL
HC  243
CO%   0.50
CO2   9.1
O2    8.3
RPM 1067
Failed due to charcoal can hooked up backwards + EGR not functional

I swapped out the EGR valve and cleaned the plumbing.
Added longer hose so charcoal cannister could hook up properly. 

---------
07May1996  Result: FAIL
HC  252
CO%   0.58
CO2  12.0
O2    4.3
Failed due to EGR not functional

At this point I caved in and had a local shop replace the hollow 
catalytic converter.  While they had it in their shop they looked 
into the EGR system (swapped the EGR valve).  250 bucks later...

---------
16May1996  Result: PASS
HC   19
CO%   0.01
CO2  14.7
O2    1.0

The state inspector issued a smog certificate ($7.75) and added a 
3x5&quot; sticker from the Bureau of Automotive Repair in the drivers door 
jamb.  From now on it shall be tested and meet emission levels for a 
1978 VW bus.

Thank GOD that's all behind me now.  I could have had my old
'73 1.7L engine rebuilt and pirated a smog certificate for less
money and grief than what I've been through with the '78 2.0L

At least I won't have to drive looking over my shoulder 'cause
I'm smog legal now!!!  Whoopeee!  &lt;I think I almost wet myself&gt;
