So Jack Agnew says:
&gt; Hate to send this to everyone, but lost the discreet address.
&gt; I will be gone from contact the 15th through around the 25th. In that 
&gt; time, I can run my allocated message storage right out of its limits and 
&gt; having the sysop yelling at me.
&gt; How can I suspend the message flow for 10 days?

&gt; 

Oh Jack, your such a bore....    ;)

Anyhoo,  This is the basic mailings 'how-to's':

to subscribe
mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
with one line saying
subscribe vanagon firstname lastname

to unsubscribe
mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
with one line saying
unsubscribe vanagon

to post (now why would you want to do a thing like that?)
mail to vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

to pester the list owner
mail to gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

Hope this helps!  ;)
