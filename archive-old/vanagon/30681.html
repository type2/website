&gt; 
&gt; &gt; mentioned, I have seen a heater installed below the dash,
&gt; &gt; right at the feet of the passenger on a ('65, I think) bus.
&gt; &gt; This may not be the same heater Tom wrote about, but it sure
&gt; &gt; seems like a very handy location!  Anyone else seen this
&gt; &gt; installation?
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen this installation twice; once on '67 and once on a '70.  It is a 
&gt; dealer installed Stewart Warner.  I've no clue why they sometimes put 
&gt; them in the cab and sometimes in the engine compartment.  Ideas Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO, it is the Stewart Warner that gave gas heaters their bad 
&gt; reputation.  Of the dozen or so SW's that I have, 
&gt; all show signs of serious overheating.  The safety equipment on a SW 
&gt; consists of an 
&gt; over-heat switch.  If something is causing the heater to overheat, fuel is 
&gt; temporarily shut off till the heater cools slightly then turned on only 
&gt; to overheat again.  And again.  In addition, they are poorly manufactured.  
&gt; Full of razor sharp edges and mis-aligned holes.  I try to avoid them.
&gt; 
&gt; The Eberspachers are another story.  While they can be tempermental, a 
&gt; good running Eb. is hard to beat.  If it gets sick, it will let you 
&gt; know by shutting down and refusing to start until fixed.   
&gt; 
&gt; There were also Wabesto (?) heaters but I don't know if VW ever used 
&gt; one in a bus.  The one I've seen was in a '66 bug mounted inline with 
&gt; heaterboxes.  Tiny thing with VW part numbers everywhere.  I think it was 
&gt; from Canada.
&gt; 

as far as i know webasto are still in business, i have seen vanagon westys's w/ 
webasto furnaces in them

have never seen a stewart warner gas heater installed, though i have seen plenty 
of Eb's.
