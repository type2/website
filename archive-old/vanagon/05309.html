Joel said something about bus owners getting tired of reading about 
water pumps and such.  Nonsense.  When I get tired I just hit the D
button a little more often.  Mostly ,I read all of it.  That way, when 
my friend with the vanagon comes back from the mechanic's I can always 
say, &quot;I coulda told ya that Dave.  My friend Joel down in Alabamee had
the same problem on his '88.&quot;  :)  And, who knows, I am open minded 
enough that I might actually own one someday.  Look at the number of 
them that used to have aircooleds.  Who else you gonna ask about 
yours?  A bunch of other &quot;idiots&quot; with that same book in their hand or
somebody who actually used to own one.  I think we have more in common
than we realize.  Besides, blood is thicker than antifreeze, and air.
