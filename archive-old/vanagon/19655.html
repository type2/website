&gt; My question however is:  with this sytem, where would you wire
&gt; things like headlights, battery, etc. to?  Would you leave those on
&gt; the ignition?

The standard for the RV industry is to leave those things that are 
usually not used when parked (ignition, headlights) on the main vehicle 
battery. I have connected the cd/radio, fridge, camping lights, water 
pump to the auxiliary battery.

In connecting the alternator to the auxiliary battery, make sure you use a 
heavy 8 or 10 gauge wire with a 30 or 40 amp fuse or circuit breaker in 
the line. (Camping World has all this at reasonable prices.)

Likewise, fuse or breaker all of your lines coming from the aux battery.
