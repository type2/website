Wanted to thank everyone for their suggestions on my '87 High Idle
problem.  I received several responses ranging from adjusting some micro
screw inside the air flow meter to replacing the idle stabilzer.

I also received some advice from an Uncle I never knew I had!  An Uncle
named Joel.  Seems this lost Uncle had messed around with Buses for a
while and gave me veteren advice.  His words of wisdom........spray the
inside of the idle stabilzer with carb. cleaner.  His thought was that
oil and crap from the EGR was clogging the valve and it wasn't closing
properly.  BINGO!  Sprayed and cleaned the valve as Unca Joel
recommended.  It took two long applications, but it worked like a champ!
 My bus now idles steady as a rock!

Goes to show that you don't need to keep plugging in new parts until you
find a solution and this one cost me $3.99

Thanks for listening...enjoy your weekend.  Headin' up backcountry
skiing tomorrow in &quot;Lewis&quot; (the idling bus)!

Peace!
