Subject: Re: Preventing Theft

Hey All,

Preventing theft is impossible, though it can be deterred.  

Never leave anything in the van that can be seen, even loose change like
a couple of pennies, or an old nap sack, etc.

Use a removable radio and remove it (don't just hide it)

Open your glove box and ash tray to show there is nothing inside.

Use a Club.

I work in both Philadelphia and New York City and have seen many-o-car
broken into and know of many instances with stolen cars.  In Philly the
theives are less sophisticated and gain entry through brute force
(broken glass) and then force the ignition switch to turn (I'm not going
to post how).  In New York they will force entry though the lock and
then force the ignition.  They also know how to get around the Club
(again there are ways to do this quickly that I will not post).

The good news is..nobody wants a Vanagon, but they will take your Jetta,
GTI, and other sedans.  Also, most theft is of the contents of the car,
not the car itself.

The most important thing is, don't make it easy.

My 2 cents.
