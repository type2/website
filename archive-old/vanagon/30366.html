Subject: RE: Reinforced Snow Tires

Another 2 cents on the snow tire issue:

I am running Michelin X 185R14C 6PR tires on my '84
Vanagon GL.  Sidewall lists 55PSI maximum.  These have
a good M/S tread, are quiet on pavement, and have had
no problem providing traction in moderate/heavy snow.
I admit I have not had to get out of 3-foot drifts from
a dead start (yet), but performance has been good
through one (northern Illinois) winter.  Price was
about $425 for four (my wife paid and I didn't see
the bill).
