&gt; &gt; 
&gt; A while back, I was looking to put a late model tank in my '67, and from
&gt; what i understand, all microbus tanks are 10.5 gallons, and late models
&gt; are 15. The consensus also was that a late model tank would fit into a
&gt; micro with no modifications. Although I have not tried it yet, perhaps
&gt; you might want to look into it...
&gt; 
I put a '69 tank in a 66 deluxe years back.  If my memory serves me 
correct it was a tight fit requiring the removal of the fuel spigot, but 
it went in.  I also had to 'rig' the fuel intake and vent.  I don't 
believe I hooked up the fuel guage sender wires, so I don't have any 
feedback on that.
