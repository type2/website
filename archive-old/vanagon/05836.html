Subject: VW Transporter poem.


I can still see it in the showroom,
Sea Blue paint shining, white plastic steering wheel and
shift knob,
brand new windows cleaned on both sides, 
chrome glimmering in the hard white lights,
air conditioned show room air, 
smell of glue and vinyl
inside, seats firm, I sit high,
as it sits high on its shiny new
tires. Little whiskers of rubber
still sticking out from the tread.
Everything's ready. Now put
yourself in the picture.

	Bill Abbott
