&gt; As usual the cause is greed and money.  They want you to get rid of your
&gt; older cars (any brand) so that your forced to buy the new more expensive
&gt; and almost impossible to work on new cars.

&gt; But fear not!  We with this list and other mediums are just as relentless
&gt; and will outsmart these fiends by sharing information about the newer
&gt; cars so that we will know how to work on them and how to handle most
&gt; problems.  Well, at least until we get too lazy to do so.  ;)
Well, since I subscribed to this list (about 8 months ago.) I've learned
enough about vanagons, and post-1967 busses in general, that I feel
I can give somewhat competent advice (consulting the list first, of
course. :^)) And my 1983 Buick (gasp!) is a disposable car, since I
can apparently get no parts/support for it anymore. I have much better
luck finding parts for my `66 bus, or my `55 Ford.....
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the aircooleds air slowly dying off.  What a lost.
&gt; A whole generation of history slowly rusting into the past. :(
HEY! They are not dying off!!!! Some young-un's (like myself), who 
can still do the underbody crawl, are keeping the tradition alive!
I make a point to wave to _all_ bus owners, bug owners (if they wave 
first. :)) I ALWAYS stop to help all aircooled VW's, (still can't
tell the difference between a jetta and cabriolet.)
   Well, hell. Mabey Volkswagens are a religion, and for your perusal:
1st commandment: Thou shalt change thine oil every 2500 miles,
or suffer the fate of the burned valves

2nd commandment: Thou shalt stop for all Volkswagens in need, and
in return thou shalt receive the same treatment; for today's helpee
may become tomorrow's succor... :^)
