Subject: NEATO election


As many of you already know, in the latest issue of the NEATO 
newsletter, the Old Bus Review, is a Ballot for the election of 
Officers for the club.  The election is usually held at the Fall 
Buses by the Arch, but for whatever reason wasn't this year.

I am doing a little campaigning for one of the nominations for
president of NEATO.  Allen Becker decided to run this year, and 
I believe he would be a great asset as president of the club.  
Anyone who has met Allen knows how dedicated he is in the bus 
community.  He is heavily INVOLVED in the club and promotes NEATO 
every chance he gets.  He holds the record, bar none, for the 
recruitment of new members for NEATO.  I feel Allen Becker is the 
person who can take NEATO to the &quot;next level&quot; and make the BEST 
bus club even better.

Please fill out your ballot now with who you think will be most 
beneficial to the club in the upcoming year.  Ballots are due 
February 15th.

***shameless recruiting technique following***

If you haven't joined NEATO yet, and would like some info on
our organization, I would be happy to send you information.

***end of shameless recruiting technique***
