Subject: Re: Drain Plug?  What's a Drain Plug?

&gt; From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;
&gt; There's the usual round plate underneath the engine where you'd expect
&gt; to find a drain plug, but it's a smooth plate -- no hole for a drain
&gt; 
&gt; - does this seem weird to anyone else?

	Well, it did seem weird to me when I was doing the pre-purchase
inspection of my Beetle with the proverbial fine-toothed comb and
encountered the same thing... So I asked the PO (er, the *only* PO
besides VWAG):

&gt; - why would you want to have such a plate?

	...and he said, &quot;the drain plug fell out while my wife was
driving it in the early seventies, so when we got it rebuilt they
put that drain cover on so it wouldn't happen again.&quot;  Hmm, I guess
with that kind of logic, you could prevent flats by removing all 4
tires...
