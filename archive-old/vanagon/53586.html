Subject: Fix for Mass Airflow Meter '91GL

After thinking a lot and working a little on my daughter's '91GL that won't
start, I have discovered that there may well be a problem with the mass
airflow meter rheostat.

I checked the terminal resistance on contacts 2-3 per Bentley and found
erratic readings. I then took the black plastic cover off and discovered
that the resistance board wiper strip is pretty well shot. The carbon is
worn away down to the base board material.

The local dealer wants $469 for a new assembly including the large die cast
horn and the flapper. Outrageous to replace a bad resistance board that
probably doesn't cost Bosch more than a couple of dollars to make.

I called VWOA and have not heard back from them. I can't get to the
archives tonight.

My plan is to lengthen the wiper blade by about 1/16&quot; to get to new carbon
on the arc. It will be tricky. Anyone know if there is chance it will work?

Does anyone have a better way to fix it?

Thanks.
