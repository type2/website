Subject:      Re: Distributor cap on '88 Westy

I really did not mean to blast the design, but to offer a hint to others who
might have this problems at higher altitudes and not know, as I didn't, about
the relationship between the cap and the altitude symptoms. As for the
design, I only have experience with my other vehicles which have never had
this problem, so I knew it could be done better and was thus suspicious of
the VW design (maybe the dialectric material or shield-to-dialectric
spacing.)

&gt;  The grounded shield is designed to reduce radio interference.  Anyway, I
&gt; don't think that a 25,000 mile life for a distributor cap is unreasonable.
