Subject:       Inuvik Trip Report

Hi Everyone.   I have had some requests to provide a trip report for 
this trip that I had taken a few years ago.  I have finally got it on 
the www, and Ron Lussier (www.chaco_dot_com/~coyote) has been kind 
enough to put it on his home page as well.

Feel free to contact my page at   www.bcit.bc_dot_ca/~hyates

I also have some pictures of a bug restoration I did a few years ago.

I'll add pictures of the Inuvik trip as I get them scanned in and put 
them with each applicable section.

For those of you who don't have www browsers, email me, and I'll send 
you a text file attachment.

Enjoy.
Harry.
