Subject: Re: Achieving high mileage


I have to concur with Cetin's observation regarding high mileage and 
Chrysler $hitboxes....I've always said I'll never trust a vehicle that has 
the propensity of shedding minor items. Next time you see a first generation 
Chrysler $hitbox (A/K/A Recycled K-car) look at the license plate light trim 
panel on the rear hatch....95% of them are gone...fallen off...

The way I figure it is that if Chrylser couldn't figure out how to design a 
simple trim piece that won't fall off...how the hell can they design the 
rest of the van to last??


It is true, that those of us who have purchased our VW vans as new or 
slightly used vehicles bought them for the long haul (literally and 
figuratively). We planned on keeping our EV for 10 years...eventhough I 
would get distracted from time to time (by the odd subaru or synchro). But 
now that I have LEARNED my lesson the EV is on the permanent roster.

My advise...change the oil and filter often and use an original VW filter 
and decent oil (Mobil1)....wash it top to bottom often....wax it often...
fix little things before they become big things...clean the interior...ENJOY 
YOUR VW!!!
