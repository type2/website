Kyle,
	Thank you for the information about the ignition.  That was the
problem.  Due to work it was 11:00pm last night before I could utilize
your suggestions. The ignition proved to be the source of the problem.
Since it was dark and cold outside I removed the switch housing and took
it inside.  Once the the switch was opened, I found that the contact in
question had gotten hot and pushed away from the center contact.  With a
few modifications the switch now works well.  I suspect the stero
system, now move to a new power source, caused the problem.  I posted
this problem to the Vanagon list and took the van to two repair shops
with no success in finding the problem. Thank you for taking the time to
speak with me.  Once again I am finding VW people to be unique and most
helpful.   Please forward your address to me so I can pay you for your
time and efforts.  In the near future, I may need a new switch.  What is
cost of an ignition switch for a 1987 Vanagon GL, Wolfsburg, Weekender,
5speed, 2.1 liter engine?  
THANK YOU, for your help. 
With head lights I can now stay out after dark!!!!
