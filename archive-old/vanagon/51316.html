Subject: Brake Pad/Shoe Thickness '84 Westy

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

Is there a way to view the brake pads/shoes on all the wheels by just
sliding beneath the Westy and looking at some particular spots on the
undersides? I want to avoid removing wheels, hubs, etc.
