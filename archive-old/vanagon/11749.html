Steve Wall says:
&gt; Diagnosis of Thermostat:
&gt; 
&gt; 	The thermostat seems to be operating ok - opens at 85 degrees C,
&gt; 	no heat in the heating system until it opens, etc. There IS a 
&gt; 	white residue around the thermostat housing, but no obvious
&gt; 	leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Diagnosis: I don't really need a thermostat at this time.

I ask:  &quot;You don't get heat until the thermostat opens????&quot;   &lt;sound 
of whooping sirens&gt;   Before trying on a new radiator, do the simple, 
cheap things in that order.   try:
1.  check radiator fan fuse
2.  stick a thermometer in the coolant reservoir jug when its fully 
warmed up (watch for hot anti-freeze spraying out when you loosen 
cap) and verify the accuracy of the gauge
3.  bleed the system of air (yeah, yeah, I know.  we're all sick of 
hearing about that)
4.    replace the thermostat and o-ring
5.  flush the cooling system, think about taking out the radiator and 
having a shop clean it out for you (about $35)
6.  warm up the checkbook and start thinking water-pump/radiator.
