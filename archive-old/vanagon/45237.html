Ah yes!  Those geverators are real trouble-prone.  They have been known to rattle
and should be replaced avery 20,000 miles ;-)

Sorry, I know it's not Friday (and I laughed myself out of my chair while reading
one of my mis-typed posts yesterday so who am I to talk?) but if I stop making
stupid posts like this I'd have to get some work done.
