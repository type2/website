Subject: Re: Drug Caution: Old Vehicles

Last Friday I posted a silly note relating to Dave Eastman's sunken fish
treasure, &quot;Should I buy this bus&quot; thread. (see way below).

The following day I went to buy some interior panel replacement parts for
the '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Heck.&quot; While pulling the panels out, the seller
and I discovered that at sometime in the history of the parts bus someone
had stashed some Pot and a bag of seeds behind the paneling. This stuff was
behind the big passanger side coat closet cabinet, behind the birch
paneling, and behind the fiberglass insulation!) I seriously don't subscribe
to this activity and dumped the contraband. ('sides it must have been 15
years old) ;) Heck, I'm even on Nicoderm week #one! (Grumble).

**The Point of this Message**

It might be a wise thing to carefully check new acquisitions for such things
prior to putting it in service to avoid some potential legal liabilities in
the future. I have found similar things in other vans in the past. A
favorite spot seems to have been in front of the floorboard and behind the
front skin of the old splitties. Watch for needles etc! You never know where
the bus has been prior to your ownership. I'm always watching &quot;True Stories
of the Hiway Patrol etc.&quot; Everyone always says &quot;Duh, no drugs in my car,
&quot;Mr. Man.&quot; Next thing you know they are in handcuffs. With the legacy of the
Hippie buses a left over association could be made by your local
enforcement. Avoid the hassles and clean it out.

Just my opinion\

&gt;From Silly Friday...
&gt;&gt;You forgot to include the late '60s early '70s option of the &quot;stash hole.&quot;
&gt;&gt;The fuzz behind ya and the cherry goes on and you're just about to be
&gt;hassled by &quot;the man?&quot; No problem, just shove wut ya gots in yo pocketes down
&gt;the stash hole an' ledit fall on to the roadway. If you used the type one
&gt;parking brake slot you might get away with it but you could almost neva
&gt;gidit back. Made the bug smell like patulli oil and vanilla though! =).
