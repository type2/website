Subject: Better Header/Heaterbox Connections

&gt; Here's my proposal: I hate that dammned connection between the header and

&gt; ideas? Airplane parts? Some kind of mating face with bolts like a regular
&gt; exaust port to header connection? Mebbe take acouple of old headers and
&gt; weld the exaust port mating face onto the heater box and header, thereby
&gt; making a bolt-together setup with a gasket inbetween? Anything less
&gt; permanent that welding them? Don't laugh, when I bought my bus the PO had
&gt; *welded* the 2 together-I guess he thought that he'd never have to remove
&gt; the pipes, duh. Made it real fun for me to remove them. That guy was a real
&gt; brain surgeon.

I think Rusty Van Bondo did something like this on one of his vehicles.  
Perhaps he'd enlighten us with the does and don'ts.  Rusty?
