Subject: replacing elec. hookup

Hi, I just received the electrical and water supply hookup 
replacements I orderded and installed them on my 85 Westy. The 
electrical hookup has three screws on the back, on the original the 
black wire went to the brown screw the white wire to the silver screw 
and the green screw. The new one worked out so the black wire went on 
the silver screw and the white wire went on the brown screw and the 
green (ground) screw. Is this OK? I didn't really think it would 
matter as long as the ground wire was connected but wanted to make 
sure. The water tanks cover is slightly different from the original. 
Instead of having the key lock inside of the flip cap, there is a 
little plastic lock on the outside. This does keep the flip cap from 
ever flying up, which is the reason I had to replace them...but it 
seems a little easier to get into if anyone was so inclined. The 
replacements cost about 35 bucks a piece, but one cover had come 
completly off and the othe constanly flipped up and down on the highway and was about 
to come off. I also had to get a new skylight (at about 125) and 
replacement riser mechanism (24$) but now I find the turn knob is 
stripped...any advice on how to remedy this or will I have to replace 
this too? Will epoxy work? Thanks for any advice,
Rick
