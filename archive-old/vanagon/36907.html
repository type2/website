Subject: RE: Vanagon towing HEAVY loads



&gt;Has anyone had experience towing heavy loads (1 ton or more)
&gt;repeatedly for long distances, and has it had any dire consequences on
&gt;the VW engine or transaxle?

I used to tow VW Bugs around with my '69 bus in Colorado-- trips of
50 miles or more, often over the Continental Divide (from Denver 5000'
to the Divide 11,000' to Dillon 9,000'). Opening the engine hatch let
it run cooler.


&gt;My neighbor, who is a great fan of american iron, says that the F100 will
&gt;still be towing heavy loads when the VW is scrap!

Let me get this straight: my 27-year-old VW will &quot;soon&quot; be scrap???
Guess I'd better junk it now, even tho it runs fine.

BTW, did he happen to predict where the F100 will be when it is 27 years 
old?  :^)
