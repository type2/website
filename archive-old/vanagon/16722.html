&gt;I was windering what people use instead of CV grease. CV grease
&gt;is gurrently going to $3.49 for a two ounce tube! I need at least
&gt;two tubes per CV, four CVs per car. Mabye more. Ouch!
&gt;What is it about special grease that makes it so '$pecial'?
&gt;Is high temp wheel bearing grease a good substitute? I would
&gt;use the salt resistive boat trailer type.

i've used Valvoline MOLY EP grease in the paper tube (for the grease guns)
... and use 1/2 tube per joint/boot. be SURE it says that it is 'disk brake
wheel bearing' grease (there is another kind that won't stand up to the
temps of the disk brakes.  or something).  anyway, it's about $1.50 per tube
so that's $3.00 plus tax for all four joints.  i've been using it now for
the last five buses and it seems to work pretty good.

a word of caution: that grease is ALIVE! it will LEAP off things to get onto
your shirt and pants and face and ears and nose ... do NOT wear good clothes
that you plan to keep. you have been warned! ;)

&gt;a good answer. But, It sure seems the consesus is to
&gt;use about three times the specified amount. And I will. Gotta

yup. that's why i used the 1/2 tube ... it's actually a bit more than will
fit into the joint and boot, but what with the grease LEAPing onto your
clothes and body parts and dog and anything else that walks by, it works out
about right. besides, you can never get ALL of the grease out of those damn
tubes anyway.

if you want to clean the joint really well, get some spray cans of Brake
Cleaner ... but don't breathe the fumes from that stuff!!! and it costs a
bunch, too. gasoline works pretty well, but it will kill you quicker if
you screw it up. be careful out there. :)
