&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1.  My clutch master cylinder is leaking internally.  
&gt;   Whom do you think has the best price for a new one??

I believe you can get kits for clutch master cylinders, but a pitted
cylinder wall means you should just get a new one.  Based on your email
address, I'll assume you are in Sacramento.  If you call for price quotes,
these two places will probably come out the cheapest:  Foreign Parts
Specialties, on Elvas, and European Auto Parts on 16th St. 

&gt; 2.  How do I drain the oil from the transmission??  

There is a drain plug on the bottom rear of the transmission.

&gt; I see a plug right by the shift linkage but I don't know if this is the
&gt; drain.  

That's the fill plug.  

&gt;There is a plastic cap on the top of the transmission. 

Sorry, mine doesn't have a plastic cap.  Are you sure it's not a backup
light switch?  I'm not sure if your trans. is auto. or manual.  That would
make a difference.
