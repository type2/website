Jan,

I don't know about current prices for the nuts and studs (sounds very high,
but that's to be expected for Vanagon parts...), but the ones for the allow
wheels ARE all different from the steel wheel ones, and you will have to
get longer studs for the rear.  I would not use the standard nuts or bolts
for allow wheels, since the tapers look different, and I think you might
have dangerous wear and loosening problems on the alloys.

&gt;Hi there,
&gt;
&gt;I have the following question:
&gt;
&gt;For my '81 diesel Vanagon (pictures on my web site
&gt;http://home.pi_dot_net/~jwbrier/jwbus.htm) I managed to buy a set (5) of
&gt;original VW allow wheels. These wheels were sold by VW on '85 thru 89
&gt;vanagons (Caravelles).
&gt;
&gt;As it turns out I cannot use the nuts and bolts that hold the old steel
&gt;rims. The shape of the hole where it mates with the head of the nut is
&gt;conical rather than round.
&gt;
&gt;I checked with the VW dealer (that's not VW was their first reaction,
&gt;although they genuinely are). They found the wheels on the fiche and quoted
&gt;the price of the nuts (5$ each) and the bolts ($9 each). That comes to $140
&gt;in total! They were very apprehensive about the whole thing.
&gt;
&gt;Two questions:
&gt;
&gt;1. Anyone knows anything about this? Suggestions?
&gt;2. The wheels are somewhat thicker (+ 1cm / 0.5&quot;) than the steel ones. Are
&gt;the studs for the rear wheels long enough to mount the alloy wheels? Or
&gt;should they be replaced with longer ones?
&gt;
