Subject: ECU fix and recall q's?
Date: Wed, 5 Feb 1997 12:13:00 -0500

Tis' me again,

Been searching the archives and found LOTS of references to the 86/87
recall but no definitive info. So is the fact or fable?? Any details?

Also, I've yet to find a procedure for the fix Tim Smith mentioned? Again,
does anyone have this info?

My first impression after scanning the archives is that my next step should
be to check for proper ground and take a look inside the ecu for obvious
problems. Before I do this, does anyone have any words of wisdom?

I'm now finding out why this vgon was so cheap :-(
