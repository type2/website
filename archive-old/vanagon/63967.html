Subject: Vanagon (and other Type II and VW) book(s)


     I promised this a few weeks ago, and have finally remembered to 
     deliver.
     
     Brooklands Road Test Books:
     
     Volkswagen Bus-Camper-Van, 1979-1989
     ISBN 1-870642-783
     
     This is the book which has two reprint articles on the Oettenger 6 
     cylinder engine as well as another on an aftermarket Turbocharger 
     installation. I got it at my local friendly local VW parts and repair 
     store - it's also available direct from:
       
        Motorbooks International
        Osceola WI
        800-826-6600
     
     There are also similar VW-related books available on:
     
        VW Bus-Camper-Van 54-67
        VW Bus-Camper-Van 68-79
        VW Beetle 56-77
        VW Cars 36-56
        VW Golf GTi 76-86
        VW Karmann Ghia 55-82
        VW Scirocco 74-81
        Road &amp; Track on VW 51-68
        Road &amp; Track on VW 68-78
        Road &amp; Track on VW 78-85
        Practical Classics on VW Restoration
        VW Kubelwagen 40-75 (must include the type 181)
     
     Don't have the ISBNs on the other books - I have the 54-67 Type II 
     book at home, and it's good.
     
     Also, congratulate me (or send condolances) . . . I found a somewhat 
     beat, but good running Type 181 &quot;Thing&quot; Acapulco for sale and have 
     made arrangements to buy it next weekend.
