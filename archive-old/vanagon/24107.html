Subject: CHAT: VW Safety

Saw the book below the on-line card catolog for our library. Wonder if 
someone was getting a little nervous about VW sales around '72?

Actually, there are, of course, some safety issues as we've heard on this 
list before. I may check the book out just to see what it has to say.

Also, I just saw part of &quot;The Endless Summer,&quot;...you know, the surfing 
movie, on cable this morning. So many vintage VWs and several nice buses. 
What a nice treat for someone who has to work on a Monday holiday.
