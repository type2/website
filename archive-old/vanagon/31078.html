&gt;Hi all,
&gt;       I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while
&gt;going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?

Woah, a monumental question!, first is there an intended way to sleep, any
VW ads showing people sleeping out there?  Personally i have slept both
ways, but prefer to put my head to the rear so my feet can dangle.
