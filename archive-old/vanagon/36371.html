Subject: VR6 Engine...was RE:Ev woes again

Tim asks:

&gt;I hear that the V6 has one cylinder head, is that possible?

The VR6 is a &quot;narrow V&quot; engine.....traditional V6s have approx 60 degrees
between cylinder banks and two cylinder heads...the VR6 has 15 degrees 
between cylinder banks (the pistons are almost vertical). Because of the
design the banks of cylinders are close enough to make use of a single 
cylinder head.
