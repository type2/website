I second Tobin's recommendations... and yes, Tobin did talk me into 
it.  The Thetford fits nicely between the front seats in the 80+ 
Vanagon's behind the parking brake.  My wife just made a couple 
webbing straps so secure it in place while driving.  The unit is 
approx. 12X14 and 12 high.  My wife also made a cover for it complete 
with map pockets.  It works well in our van.

&gt; 
&gt; Bathroom stuff:  Christa and I have and use (when we're camping, not all 
&gt; the time!) a porta-potti, and it's great.  What we have is a Thetford 
&gt; Porta-potti 235 and we got it on sale in Canada for about $100.00 CAN.  
&gt; Highly recommended.  C and I are extremely enthusiastic about it, and we 
&gt; even (kind of) talked Harry Yates into buying one.  Harry bought one, but 
&gt; apparently they don't make the 235 anymore.  
&gt; 
&gt; What it is, how it works:
&gt; The porta-potti (PP) is a 2-part unit.  The top part is the, um, sit-on 
&gt; and temporary hold-it part.  A slide type valve keeps, uh, stuff in the 
&gt; bowl until sliding the little door lets the stuff fall into the lower 
&gt; part, which is the holding tank.  Slide it shut, and that's the last you 
&gt; see/smell/etc. of it.  A little of the blue goop that airlines use is in 
&gt; there (you put it in after emptying), and it nuetralizes everything, 
&gt; turning it into a bluey-brown more-or-less odourless syrup.  (Enjoying 
&gt; your lunch, people?).  When the holding tank gets full (and there's a 
&gt; little indicator on the tank to tell you how full the tank is) just dump 
&gt; it out in the nearest toilet/sanidump/etc.  It even has a little 
&gt; swiveling pipe-thing you uncap that the yummies pour out of so that 
&gt; emptying is controlled and mess-free.  
&gt; 
&gt; Using a PP in a VW bus:
&gt; I built a box that fits just behind the passenger seat in our westy.  
&gt; This box holds the PP, toilet paper and blue goop under the PP, and has 
&gt; two deep bookshelves next to where I slide the PP in.  Just try to find 
&gt; (non-sexist/racist/etc.) reading material in a gas station bathroom!
&gt; 
&gt; Because I built the box with very tight clearance for the PP, I have a 
&gt; length of seatbelt strapping I tie around the PP to help me lift it in 
&gt; and out of the box.  The box has a top lid, so we can use the box as a 
&gt; seat when cooking inside the camper.  
&gt; 
&gt; We have NO smells from the PP, although the closed box may help in this 
&gt; respect.  Having it in the box also keeps it from sliding around on tight 
&gt; corners/rough roads/whenever you get air on the drive to pick up 
&gt; grandma.  
&gt; 
&gt; The only problem we've experienced was the result of rapid air pressure 
&gt; changes and hours of VERY hard cornering (I think).  In Mexico, we 
&gt; dropped close to 10,000 feet in just a few hours on an absolutely insane 
&gt; &quot;road&quot;, accompanied by a 10-15 C temperature increase.  Perhaps the seal 
&gt; between the holding tank and the upper 'bowl' part of the PP is too good, 
&gt; 'cause shortly after reaching close to sea level it kind of... exploded 
&gt; (in a minor way) when Christa tried to use it.  Interestingly, though, by 
&gt; far the worst paret of the smell was the chemical smell of the blue goop, 
&gt; not the, uh, other portion of the contents.  Moral: bleed pressure from 
&gt; the holding tank occaisionally if you're driving up or down a steep high 
&gt; mountain range.
&gt; 
&gt; Our holding tank is good for 3 - 5 days, depending.  We use regular 
&gt; toilet paper.  The blue goop is cheap, don't need much, and is available 
&gt; at any RV store.  I highly recommend the THetford brand of porta-pottis 
&gt; (std. disclaimer, etc., etc.) and maybe other folks have their own 
&gt; preferences.  Good RV stores seem to always have a good selection of 
&gt; them, although these places tend towards the larger models which may not 
&gt; be neccesary for us VW types.
&gt; 
&gt; We lived out of our camper for 3 months, 15,000 miles of driving in all 
&gt; kinds of conditions, and I think a good quality porta-potti was one of 
&gt; the best equipment investments we made.  You'll never want to take your 
&gt; chances at a gas station again.  And the reading material is better, too!
&gt; 
&gt; Happy, uh, camping!
