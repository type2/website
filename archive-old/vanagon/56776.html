Subject: Re: Milwaukee Auto Show--VWoA has no plans for Eurovan

I am really sad to hear this! If a Westfalia Eurovan camper had been available
to me, I probably would have bought one this time round (after loosing my
mint '91 Westy)!

I test drove both a '95 Eurovan Winni and a '97 Eurovan Winni and found plusses
and negs on both. But the MAJOR GRIPE I had was with the Winni conversion.
After owning a Westfalia it felt CHEAP and lacked the well thoughout design
and tightness of the Westfalia. I simply could not talk myself into it! The
dealer even offered me a real steal on the '95 -- it had 5kmiles, the PO had
added all of the screens (rear and vent screens now 'optional' equipment from
Winnebago - not standard) even a sliding door screen, and other little add ons.
For all of this he said $25k if I made a deposit that day. But I just didn't
like it enough.

Thankfully I held out and now am purchasing a '91 with 28k original 1 owner
miles (although it is not as nice as the one I lost!) By the time I get it 
home from MN and add Alloys, security sys, awning, etc I will have $23k
invested in it! But I will be happier!

DOESN'T VW UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF FARFEGNUGEN (sp?) or FUNKENGRUVEN 
ANYMORE? 

Yes, there are lots of conversion vans - I looked at several models at the
North East camping show 2 weeks ago. They START at $45k if you pay cash (list
starts about $55k!). And the only thing they really have over the Westy is
a bathroom (do I care about that? bought a great portapotti for $45. last
year and a rubbermaid basin for $4.50 - this took care of us for a 7 week jaunt
supplimented by facilities at the campgrounds.) And my Westy is open and airy
and makes me feel like I am CAMPING (previous backpacker here) IN the great
outdoors - not cooped up in a van!

You can take a Westy ANYWHERE easier that a conversion van (esp the Syncro).
You can do all sorts of fun upgrades yourself - I have seen people who devised
an indoor shower even!

SO . . . what can WE do to let VW know that many of us are - or will be VERY
INTERESTED in the Westfalia version of the Eurovan? Can't they at least allow
REAL SERIOUS VW owners to purchase one in Germany for use there and shipment
back to the US? If they would AT LEAST reinstate the &quot;tourist program&quot; with
the necessary details for import by the individual to the US, they might see
that there are SOME REALLY SERIOUS VW types willing to pay a fair price for
a quality vehicle.

&gt; Just a quick report on VW from the Milwaukee Auto show which just ended on
&gt; Sunday.  I asked Hans the VW rep at the auto show when we could expect to
&gt; see the 97 Eurovans and he said that VWoA has no plans to bring the Eurovan
&gt; to the US.  He said VWoA looked into it but the pricing just didn't
&gt; fit--like 30 to 35k for the CL to MV models.  He said they are able to sell
&gt; the 97 Eurobago for less than one of the Eurovan models.  He said at that
&gt; price and because of all the minivan competition they just didnt think they
&gt; would sell.  I defintely felt like this was a subject he didnt want to talk
&gt; about.  He did say that he got many inquiries from people at the show as to
&gt; Eurovan availablity.
&gt; 
&gt; No plans for Eurovans in the US--say it isn't so!  :(
