&gt; Try twisting it counterclockwise to remove, clockwise to tighten.  It has
&gt; these little ramps that lock into the irregular shaped hole in the body
&gt; sheetmetal.  If you pry with a screwdriver you might wreck the plastic
&gt; piece, like I did.  It's even harder to get back on. 

Thank you! I would never have thought of that. I'll give it a try and let 
you know how it works.
