Subject: Re: [f] Friday poem, Help me!!!

&gt;HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP
&gt;
&gt;Please PITCH IN and help me with this!  Contribute your own couplet (for
&gt;those of you who slept through English class, two lines that rhyme) and
&gt;maybe we can get Joel to be sweet and collect them all into one big
&gt;beautiful paean.  Joel?
&gt;
&gt;   I think that I shall never scan
&gt;   A poem lovely as a van--
&gt;   A Volksy van that gets me there,
&gt;   And home again without a care.
&gt;
        Nor will I find, in travels bold
        Conveyance which is quite so cold.
        A heaters' warmth would be so fair;
        'Til then it's thermal underwear
