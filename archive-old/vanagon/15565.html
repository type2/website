&gt;&gt; Rusty replies:
&gt;&gt; &quot; The more, the merrier.&quot; Let's not get elitist but embrace the differences.
&gt;&gt; I own both early and late models and don't consider myself in the &quot;higher
&gt;&gt; income&quot; bracket.

&gt;&gt;No Todd, Just one project that seems like several. Possibly someone
(Rusty) needs to lurk for a month or two. As far as &quot;fading into
nothingness&quot; is concerned, the result would probably be more like red iron
oxide ;)
