&gt; In the past week an a half we have gone from Language Barriers to Oregon 
&gt; Bashing to Cruise Control Bantering.  Enough is enough!
&gt; 
&gt; 'nuff said! :-)

You suh, are obviously not getting enough prunes in your diet!!! ;)

Or maybe your flannel shirt (bandana) is too tight???  ;p


Say it with me now:
   
   &quot;It's only Friday.  It well be over soon.&quot;
   &quot;It's only Friday.  It well be over soon.&quot;
   &quot;It's only Friday.  It well be over soon.&quot;
