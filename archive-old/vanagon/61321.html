Subject: VW PARTS AND PRICE FIXING!!
Date: Thu, 12 Jun 1997 19:06:04 -0400

It has come to my attention that a certain competing retailer of
Bus/Vanagon parts has been quietly complaining to one or several parts
suppliers about some of the prices that I have offered to this List. 
Apparantly they are not happy about having to compete with those prices,
and would like to fix it so they don't have to.  Actually, this is the
second time (that I know of) in the last few months that they have made
subtle moves toward price-fixing.  It's time to put a stop to it. 

In my previous line of work (the hifi industry), I've seen similar illegal
attempts to &quot;encourage&quot; various retailers to maintain certain price levels.
 Frankly I had wondered if I'd run up against it in the Volkswagen
business.  I guess there will be a few greedy people anywhere where there's
money to be made, even in Volkswagens.  So while I'm a bit disappointed,
I'm not completely surprised, and I know what to do.  

The company in question is a subscriber to (or at least a regular reader
of) this List.  They checked out  my website before it was mentioned
anywhere but on this list, and have regularly been aware of listmember-only
pricing that I offer only on this list.  So I am posting the following in
the expectation that it will reach the same eyes.
	____________________________________

It is a violation of federal law for retailers and/or wholesalers to
collude to set pricing, either overtly, or even by mere suggestion or
implication. Furthermore it is illegal for a wholesaler or manufacturer to
in any way limit or control distribution for the purpose of enforcing
&quot;suggested retail&quot; prices.  The Justice Department and the courts are very
vigorous about enforcing this.  A mere telephone discussion can, and has,
resulted in very severe punative fines and judgements.  If you doubt me on
this, consult your attorney.

If the party involved is smart,  they will walk away from this and play by
the rules, which are in the best interests of the consumer.  I'm a big
believer in the free market system. I will immediately, and with great
pleasure, file suit for damages against any entity, anywhere in the
country, who tries on any level to exert influence on the pricing or
availability of Volkswagen parts to this list or on my website, and will
also report their attempts to both the Federal Trade Commission and the
appropriate state authorities.  I know who you are.  Consider this fair
warning.  Any further attempts, no matter how subtle, will result in swift
legal action against all parties involved.  Just try me.
	____________________________________

Whether my prices are low or high isn't the point.  Sometimes I can
negotiate a great deal on a particular part, other times a competitor finds
a better deal.   The same competitor that's whining about my prices on some
parts, is probably beating my prices on others.  Which is the way it should
be.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and in the end, the most
consistant winner is, hopefully, the savvy consumer.  That's the nature of
a free market.  When a merchant tries to circumvent that system for his own
gain, the real loser is the consumer.

Anyway, sorry for the rant.  Now back to our regularly scheduled program,
already in progress ... :)
