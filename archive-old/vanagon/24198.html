&gt; In reading through my spec sheets I see that the '86 and '87 model
&gt; waterboxers had the most horsepower (95hp). 

I've been waiting to see a reply posted to this question, but haven't.  I've
wondered about this for quite a while.  Does anyone know why the 95HP
published for 86-87 and 90HP for 88-91?  Was it just measured differently, VW
got more conservative or were there any actual differences in the engines?
