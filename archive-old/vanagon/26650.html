&gt;I count 540,000 km. Tell me it's true (I own an '87, too)!

Yes, yes, tell me it's true!  I, too, have an '87 with 137,000 miles.
&gt;
&gt;I met a Toronto guy who had put 750,000 km on a Rabbit Diesel. Had 250,000
&gt;on his new Jetta, four yrs old at the time.

The diesel Rabbit I traded for the '87 had 271,000 miles and I know someone
else with 350,000 on hers.
