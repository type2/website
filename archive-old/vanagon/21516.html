Subject: An interesting thing happened to me on the way to the cleaners...

Howdy,

	Last night after work I had to go by the cleaners and pick some stuff
up, and I parked next to this really nice 280SL.

	When I came back out, I drooled over it a bit, and the owner came
up and introduced himself, and we talked for a couple of minutes about
German cars, n stuff.  This car was a '71 that be bought in '70, and
it was immacculate.

	Well, it turns out that we was stranded there 'cause his shift linkage
broke, so I offered him a ride home.  After the tow truck scooped his
car up (and gosh, they're _fast!_) I took him home.    In da bus, of course!

	As we parted, while thanking me profusely, he gave me his card.  His
name is James Long - California_Superior_Court_Judge_ James Long!  
Waddaya wanna bet my next ticket is &quot;on the house?&quot; :)

Thom
