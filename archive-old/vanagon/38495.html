Subject: Should I buy?
From: &lt;alfresco_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

We are in the process of looking at an 83 Westfalia Vanagon L.  At the 
moment we don't know that much about it and have scheduled an 
inspection to check everything out.  What we could see from looking at 
it was that there was a small amount of minor surface rust and the 
interior looked lovingly used.  We did have a chance to start it, and 
it fired right up, but since it was rush hour, I decided it might not 
be a good time to learn where the gears are.
Here's the deal, 
1) it has 200,000 on the odometer
2) it was bought wholesale by this little lot, so we don't know the 
owner history (engine history)
3) quoted price, $2,500
4) we have never owned or driven a camper van, and we have only been 
following this listserve for a short while, so we don't know what 
common quirks and problems are inherent with these campers

I think this is a pretty good deal and if the timing were better I 
would probably blindly drive it away today (we need to fix our roof, 
not buy another vehicle).  I have always wanted a camper and fear that 
if I wait, I might have troubles finding one I can afford.  Any advice 
might help me make a more confident decision.  As soon as I know trhe 
condition of the mechanicles, I will post for more advise.

Thanks
