Subject: Re: Rain in your Vanagon


&gt;If you look closely, there is still deer hair at the initial point of 
&gt;impact.._dot_can anyone ELSE make that claim about their van??  :)
&gt;
I have hit two bears -- both were uninjured (tough critters, them!) but
both left wads of hair and drool in the dents they put in my cars.  My
beloved single-cab was destroyed by a deer (so was the deer, and I
got a helicopter ride in &quot;critical&quot; condition, but healed nicely).  Many,
many deer-bits were tangled in the mess that once was a daily driver.
Things like this do kill, be thankful you can write about it!

Up north, those folk have moose.  I'd hate to be in the bus that one
of them suicides on!  Thank god we only got deer.
