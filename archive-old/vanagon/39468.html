Subject: Re: Rear Hatch Strut Story (Suspander)

The Strong Arm brand that Big A sold me in the fall have worked just fine.
However, I haven't tested them recently since they're in Western MA and I'm
in CO for the next few weeks.  But I was very happy with them especially at
$25 each.

&gt;
&gt;Out of curiosity, has anyone tried the ones for $20 from JC Whitney?
&gt;Should I go with the $25 ones from Big A FLAPS? Or do I really need to buy
&gt;the Boge from Teutonix for $43 ea.? Any lurking hatch stut stories?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;--Jonah
