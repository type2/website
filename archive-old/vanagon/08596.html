&gt; I've heard rumors that the cam was different, but I find
&gt; that somewhat hard to believe. 

Yes, the Porsche heads are different, at least in some cases.

&gt; 	Muir's book says to go get sodium filled exhaust
&gt; valves when rebuilding heads. They cool the valve more
&gt; effectivly by having molten sodium metal inside the
&gt; valve stem and head- the sodium doesn't quite fill the
&gt; space and so splashes back and forth, conveying heat from
&gt; the head of the valve to the stem, from which it is conducted
&gt; out to through the valve guide. (This is why worn valve guides
&gt; are a bad idea- the valves overheat.)

I agree completely, except that they are getting extremely hard to find
and are very expensive.  I paid $26 each for four of them for my bus, and
that was 4 years ago.  My friend just rebuilt his 914 and the sodium-
filled valves for his heads were $80 each.  These are the fat-stemmed
ones I mentioned earlier.  I guess they have a lot more sodium in them or
something.  They are considerably thicker, I would estimate on the order
of 5 mm thicker than the ones in my bus.
