Subject: Re: trans mount

&gt;Well, I just replaced the shift couple on my '65 deluxe.  I had to sissor-
&gt;jack up the transmission inorder to line up the new coupler. Humm....
&gt;I didn't think it should have to move so much for alignment.  I lowered the
&gt;jack and shifting is really stiff.  The shift rod is bottoming out on the 
&gt;guide.  somethings not right.  I think I have a broken front transmission
&gt;mount.  Since I don't have a Bentley (but I'm right behind Bentley College)
&gt;could someone help me out?  What does the front trans mount look like?
&gt;Mines got a rubber mat between two steel plates.  The plate next to the 
&gt;transmission is not fixed to the rubber.  I think it should be.  When I 
&gt;lower the trans. the plate slides down the rubber mat.  I think my 
&gt;transmission is merely leaning against the rest of the mount because it
&gt;can't fall lower.  It also explains the weird oscillations I get in low
&gt;gears as maybe the trans/engine is bouncing up and down and pulling on
&gt;the accellerator cable.  I've lived with this and learned to drive her 
&gt;w/o causing this to happen.  Is my front mount busted?  I don't see any
&gt;other means of keeping the trans elevated/oriented properly.
&gt;
&gt;I probably should have wiped the grease of my hands before typing this....

When this has occured to swingaxle transmissions, I've temporarily use
vise-grips, and more permanently, drilled up and back through the mount and
fit a 8mm CV bolt with a nylock nut on it.  Works great, don't use a 1/4-20
bolt though, they just shear.  Make sure the trans/engine is jacked into
line before you drill.  Will likely hold until you get a chance to replace it.  

And isn't it amazing how long a shift coupler can last when the entire
weight of the engine is hanging on the shift linkage, banging up and down
every time you shift and accelerate?
