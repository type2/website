Subject: '68 westy for sale -Fla

     I went and looked at this one myself last week.  The owner is a former 
     student of mine.  Call her at the number below if interested.  My 
     observations are: the body needs cleaning and some dent, rust work.  
     The floors in the cab are bad.  The interior needs work but the basics 
     are there and salvagable.  The motor sounds smooth and starts right 
     up.  Tranny is thrashed.  It does not move, needs towing.  Traci has 
     driven this daily for the several years I have known her.
