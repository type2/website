&gt; I'm unfamiliar with this legal contretemps, and as the driver of an '87

&gt; Subaru got mixed up in being sued and correcting it.

&gt; Thanks for any clarification.

&gt; p.s. just found out the subaru might have a ... blown head gasket. hmm.

I, too, would be interested in this, since Subaru engines have been 
mentioned as possible transplants, but I have also heard of many head 
related failures around here.
