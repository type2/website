Subject: Re: VWoA warranty - any recent experience?


&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;My 93 EV is coming up on the 2 year expiration of the date it
&gt;was &quot;put into service&quot; (as VW says).
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;BTW, among the items I want fixed are a noisy speedo head and a power window
&gt;problem - both costly items.
&gt;
Rob,

I had the power windows on my '93 Eurovan fixed under a VWoA recall notice.
I didn't know about it but the dealer found out when they ran my VIN
through their computer.

Perhaps you should check with your dealer.

P.S.  &gt;   I get my van back today with new pistons and sleeves courtesy of
VWoA. That should fix the piston slap condition I learned about via this
list. The dealer I work with in Seattle (Carter's) has been great.

Jeff
