&gt;Both my 83 westy and 84 vanagon have this problem so I assume that vanagons
&gt;most likely all have the problem. The problem is the rack pinion steering
&gt;gear box mounting bushings are all shrunk and loose. As a result when drive

?? bentley is not much help, so i look at the exploded parts diagram ...
i don't see any 'gear box mounting bushings'. ?? do you mean those clamps
with the bolt through them? what i show as a 'gear box' is the round thing
at the end of the steering column. now it has TWO little shafts coming out
of it, and each of those shafts has a rubber shock-plate-thingie that connects
it to the input or output shaft. they appear to be just two bolts holding
each in place. bentley does show a picture with the warning 'always replace'
pointing to those nuts and bolts, so i would assume them to be those nylon
self-securing type bolts.

&gt;Is it possible to replace those bushings without removing the gear box?

it LOOKS like you could take the two bolts out of each shock-plate-thingie
(if that is what we are talking about) and have enough play to slide it out
and slide the new one in. but i get the feeling that's not the part you mean.

&gt;The gear box is positioned/secured by 4 bolts and nuts with bushings between
&gt;the bolts and the holes of the gear box.
&gt;Do I need to remove the gear box in order to press out the worn busshings
&gt;and press in new ones? If yes, it seems to be much bigger a job that I
&gt;can hanle. It will require an alignment job afterwards.

if you mean the bushings around the bolts that hold the gear box itself to
its bracket, i would think that NO, you would not need to remove the box.
IF you can get up in there to work. you should be able to remove one bolt,
remove the bushing (whichever way you can), insert the new bushing, and
replace the bolt. easier said than done, though.

if you remove the gearbox, why would you need to realign the wheels? all it
means is that your steering wheel might not be exactly horizontal ... the
crossbar, that is. you haven't changed anything underneath that is adjusted
during an alignment. no caster, no camber, and no toe-in was changed. i don't
think you'd need an alignment, except to make the steering wheel be back
like it was. (of course, i've never done this. ;)
