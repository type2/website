&gt; My VW dealer quoted a price of $433.00 (four hundred and thirty 
three U&gt;S&gt; dollars) for the seal set.  Whitney in Chicago lists one 
for about $75.00.  I've seen a quote on this list for $75.00.  
Unfortunately, I can't remember the source.  Aluminum clips are 
part of the construction.  For spot fixes, try clear silicon goop 
adhesive from Pep Boys or the like for about $5.00.
