Subject: Re: '57 Mystery Deepens!

Remember the weirdness I am experiencing with this thing.  The 
title says '57, but the little id plate screwed into the engine 
compartment seems to indicate a '58 (Id number 325192)
------
the id plate holds the chassis number- the 'VIN' that is on the title
 (should be)


To add insanity to confustion, stamped in the wall that divides the 
front bench from the rest of the bus, was the number: 299416.

the number behind the passenger seat  (is it still on the right side of the
bus on RHD?) is the BODY number.   it is different than the CHASSIS
number/VIN.    I dont know why.  On bugs, the body can be taken off the pan,
and the title holds to the number on the pan.   as someone said, they can be,
and are, switched around sometimes.    actually (useless trivia)  whole bus
bodys could be orderd from the factory, in primer.

anyway, it IS wierd that the body number (299416) is that differwnt from the
chassis number  325192.  they usually are within 25 numbers of each other.
 maybe your title was switch, with tag.   maybe someone hacked out the
divider, annd someone else replaced it.    any signs it was done?  (how are
your wheel wells?)
the chassis # reflects production in Feb 58, but the body number is from Nov
57.  okay maybe thats how it came.   Hmmmm, there is a number stamped in the
metal to the right of the engine in the engine compartement.   Wherethe metal
is flat (horizontal, beneath the tag.)    That number is also the chassis
number.  What does it say?
