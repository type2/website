&gt; Chris, the O2 sensor does generate a voltage, up to 0.7-0.8 Volts I think.

&gt; BTW, why include all of the original post in your question? ;)

Well, I for one missed the original post due to &quot;delete/all&quot; syndrome.  
It does make it harder to go after new information with a couple page 
post attached.  Of course, some people add their new info and then leave 
the entire post attached afterwards...that's a good idea.
