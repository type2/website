Subject: More revenge....


Another favorite of mine which I find much more destructive (read
effective) is to mix a quart of gasoline with a tube of valve
grinding compound and then pour it into the offender's gas tank.


A less destructive revenge tool is Anti Seize Compound. Liberally
apply to the inside of the outside door handle of a car. When 
your &quot;victim&quot; opens the door...ASC all over the hand. As those
of you with experience know...when you try to rub ASC away...it
just spreads and spreads   ;-)


Of course these are somewhat &quot;harsh&quot; means....but sometimes
ya gotta do whatcha gotta do!!
