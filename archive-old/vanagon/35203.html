     Well, I sold my '88 Vanagon GL last night. Kinda mixed feelings. I 
     would have loved to keep it, but just can't swing it right now. A 
     couple came by to look at it 'cause they had 6, count'em, that was 
     *six* kids! The looked at the Mopar offerings, and decided that they 
     would never be happy crammed into it. Drove the Van, and decided they 
     had to have it!
     
     Anyways, this weekend I am going to Orlando, Florida to pick up my new 
     toy, an '82 Westy Diesel. Supposedly, it is in excellent condition. 
     I'm flying down early Sunday morning from Washington-Dulles to Orlando 
     International, then putting the van on the Amtrak Auto-train for 900 
     of the approx 1000 miles back to Washington, DC. The soon-to-be PO 
     will be meeting me right at the airport to keep things easy.
     
     Well, the driveway looks a little bigger this morning, a little empty. 
     But just wait until next week! :)
     
     PS: For the all people that asked for details on installing the BN-2 
     gas heater, look for me to post them next week. I had quite a 
     response, so I will spend a little time clarifying the instructions, 
     and I will post them to the list.
