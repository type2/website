Subject: RE: Mixing Tire Types 

Kelly,

What you have is a potentially DANGERIOUS COMBINATION OF TIRES !!!

Because you are running conventional tires in the back of a rear engined vehicle, you are 
set-up for very excessive oversteer.  In other words, your bus will be VERY EASY to spin.

As a stop-gap, unil you can dispose of the Uniroyals, move the Uniroyals to the front and 
Contis to the back.  I suggest inflation pressures of 35 psi front and 43 psi rear.

Buy another pair of tires, same size and load range as the Contis, ASAP to replace the 
Uniroyals.

&gt;I have checked the archives back to the beginning and have yet to find
&gt;exactly the answer I am looking for regarding mixing of tire types.
&gt;
&gt;The PO of my 91 Westy had Uniroyal M&amp;S car tires on the back with stock
&gt;Conti LT tires on the front.  The rear tires have a max inflation of 35 psi
&gt;versus 55 psi for the front.  My door sticker calls for 43 psi front and 53
&gt;psi rear.
&gt;
&gt;I plan to ditch the Uniroyals, however, until I do I am not sure what
&gt;inflations to run.  35 rear 53 front, 35 all around, 35 rear 28 front, some
&gt;other combo or definately not at all.
&gt;
&gt;Michael Stocker and Steve Maher came close to answering these questions in
&gt;some archived mail but I welcome the experience and feedback of the entire
&gt;list on how I should proceed.
