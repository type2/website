Subject: Vanagon Ride height?

Hi Volks,
   I was wondering if you might know the correct ride height for my '82
Vanagon camper?   Right now its sits roughtly about 26 inches from the
floor to the center of the front wheel arch and 27 inches from the floor
to the rear wheel arch. Does this sound right?  If someone knows, please
contact me.  Thanks, take care.
