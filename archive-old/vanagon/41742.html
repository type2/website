Subject: '67 Westy Resto Update (VL) (F)

Have been researching the finer points of how to engineer the Mesa 72 pass
oil cooler and thermo fan and the external oil filter. No further detail
needed on the list due to the volumes of circular advice and debate. I have
dutifully researched the archives and the misc &quot;Sermons,&quot; in addition to a
few off-line discussions. Some have congratulated me on building a motor
desitined to be a &quot;Bouncing Betty&quot; after 500 miles, others say it should be
fine with out the cooler and fan. Others yet, advise not even turning the
key without including them in the system. Not to worry as the keys don't
even exist yet! =) AN8 connections and all I still think I would like to
include these items if I can finally figure out the best or any place to
install them. No fiberglass scoops will be attached to the body and I highly
doubt that I will cut a gaping hole in the d.s. &quot;battery tray&quot; metal for the
cooler and fan as suggested by some.
Other debate has developed as to place the external oil filter in the engine
compatment or outside. Most vote for the driver's side &quot;battery&quot; area even
though they don't agree on the old in-out thing. Out for ease of changing,
in to minimize radiant heat from the exhaust sys. Crud, in Phoenix everthing
is hot when it's 122F in the shade. Kinda like the difference between 6'5&quot;
and 7' when you stand at 5'9.5&quot; on a tall day. Hot is hot tall is tall.

Took delivery of the last three items (deck lid, apron and symbol) from
Satan's body man last Wednesday. 21 months aint that long to wait now is it?
Grrr...

Ordered the oil pressure and temp guages from local Honda, I mean, VW FLAPS/
service specialist. 

Both bumpers were finally put together last weekend. I cut small
appropriately sized pieces of thin sheet rubber and placed them between the
splash pans and mounting brackets of the rear bumper. the The front is
already on the bus along with a set of &quot;shin knocker&quot; steps. Passanger side
tends to stick out further than the driver's side for some reason. I don't
even wanna know the reason at this point. (I.D.G.A.S.)

Spent last Saturday tracking down a pair of back up light assys, trying to
replace the weathered body mounted electrical box and making too many trips
to the store for various nuts and bolts. Success with the lights and a few
close candidates for the box. Bought the &quot;monkey snot&quot; for the rubber
install. The nuts and bolts remind me of putting together a PVS sprinkler
system in the yard. Just as you think you have all of the parts you stumble
into the critical missing item...

Wrestled forever with the brake peadal return spring. What a bi*** that is.
What in heck is the guru technique? Manuals tend show happy, clean, service
geeks in lab coats like the Discovery Channel &quot;Answer Guys&quot; without real
details. Just once I'd like to see a manual with a bunch of grungy, sweaty,
foul mouthed, chain smoking, claustraphobia sufferers working in the dark
with kids and pets bugging them at the most inopportuned moments. =)
 
Spent all of last evening cleaning and detailing the first of five jalousie
windows. Whew, only four more to go and then reassemble and installation.

Will install the Safaris this weekend. A local acquaintence has scads of
experience installing and adjusting these pups and plans on lending a hand.
I'm anticipating using a variety of screwhead types if possible to slow down
the theif crowd. =0. BusBoys sent another set of left latches. In their
defense they have been very responsive and professional. I didn't mean to
start the last thread on them. Sorry, Jim. The latches are not matches to
the OEM's but I'm glad that I have the option vs not having any. Matt H
reported a NOS set of &quot;lefts&quot; (left outer and right inner) at the Irvine
show for a totally obsurd price.

It looks like it's a &quot;no-go&quot; for showing the Resto the SOTO/Classic weekend.
Still hope to kick some butt at the Escondido thing in August. 
I am continually amazed that VWAG was able to put these things together in
an assy line manner. Phew! can't even imagine of what it musta looked like.
At least they didn't haveta bail down to the ACE Hardware/PepBoys every two
freekin seconds. &quot;Um, like whudya mean by M10 1.5, Dude?&quot; ;-)

Sorry for the length but I consider it therapy vs going &quot;Postal&quot; at this
point. The wife just said that I need to go camping soon. I just laughed
like a lunatic and glazed over as I curled into the fetal position behind
the dresser. Ba-hahahah!
