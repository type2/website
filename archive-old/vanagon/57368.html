Subject: Re: Recall Information

Have time for just one quick part of this:

You should be able to call your local dealer with the VIN and have them
run a check to see if 

#1 Your particular VIN has any recalls attached to it. If so, they should 
   have a record of date and place of repair.

#2 If it has not been repaired, you will have to see what VW says. Some
   recalls were time &amp; date stamped with a limit.

If your local dealer asks why you are asking - just describe you concern over
knowing the vehicle's repair history. If they are a good dealer and value
your business - they will help you with the information for safety reasons.
If not . . . do you really want to do business with them?

&gt; 
&gt; I was checking out the 'Vanagon Recall Information' FAQ &amp; I've
&gt; determined that my '87 Vanagon GL Wolfs. falls within some of the
&gt; affected VINs on four of recall campaigns (SU, PW, PB &amp; PG).  I'm the
&gt; 3rd owner &amp; unfortunately, the 2nd owner's documents left to me did not
&gt; mention whether or not my Vanagon had ever been to the dealer for any
&gt; 'corrective actions'. 
&gt; 
&gt; My question(s):
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Since I'm the third owner, is the recall still in affect where I can
&gt; take it to my local VW dealership for the necessary 'corrective
&gt; actions'?
&gt; 
&gt; 2)  How can I determine whether my Vanagon has already been through the
&gt; 'corrective actions' for each particular recall campaign?
&gt; 
&gt; 3)  If determined that I can still take my Vanagon to the VW dealership
&gt; for the repairs &amp; that my Vanagon has not already been repaired, is it
&gt; as simple as calling them to make an appointment for the repairs?  Will
&gt; the VW Dealership hassle me about repair costs?  
&gt; 
&gt; Any information would be greatly appreciated.
