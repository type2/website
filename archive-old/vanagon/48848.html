And so Douglas responded:

Why fix something that's not broke? How many millions of VWs run with the stock

It kills your IS when you drop OP; instantly.

&gt; Or change the oil, or change the filter, or find out why it's overheating,
&gt; or check the fit of the OP relief plungers, or... you -might- need a rebuild.(SNIP)
