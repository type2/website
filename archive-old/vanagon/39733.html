Subject: RE: Shocks..are these good ones?

Boges are the best of those as far as I know.  I've used the Boge struts
and shocks on several cars and I've liked them.  They also have a reputaion
for longevity.  But I've heard bad things about KYB: they tend to die
young. Also, I have found the KYBs to have a harsher ride  on my '71 than I
would've liked. I believe both come with lifetime warantees, but who wants
to keep changing shocks?  I have no experience with Monroe.  However, most
of my experience has been with non-vanagons so all this may be meaningless.


Just my 2 pfennings

&gt;Jon,
&gt;I've had problems locating shocks for my syncro.  Was going to mail order
&gt;KYB's and BOGE for my van ($44 and $89 respectively) when i found that Trak
&gt;auto sells Monroe Magnum sensi track for my vehicle _at_ $36 each.  they are a
&gt;heavy duty gas charged road sensing shock with a lifetime warranty.
&gt;later,

&gt;relax and spin

&gt;myself.

&gt;|catalog and say some._dot_can't remember the name...Gasomething..not
