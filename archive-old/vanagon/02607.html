&gt;]so if 1949-1967 are Microbuses (but Jerry has a 1984 Microbus?),

&gt;If I'm the Jerry in question, my '84 will always be a bus to me, as was
&gt;my '76, and my '69.  And if I ever have one of those EuroThingies, it'll
&gt;still be a bus to me.  If it's a box with windows and seats, it's a bus.

i think it was you or jerry huff. by the by, here's a thought that keeps
recurring to me (only you, joel):

if it's a PRIDE of lions,
and a HERD of cows,
and a GAGGLE of geese,
and so forth,

what are a bunch of buses when they all get together?
a brick-yard? a bakery of buses? a parking lot?

just stiring the pot a little. :)
