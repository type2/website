Subject: Lost my head, please help.


Hi,
I am still looking for a cylinder head for a 1980 Westy
(air cooled, 2.0 litters, square ports). The head currently
on the engine is unserviceable due to a dropped valve seat.

I would appreciate any leads on where to get new/rebuilt heads.
Also, does anyone have any experience with the new heads made in
Spain (the seem to be cheaper than rebuilts !!)

Thanks a bunch
