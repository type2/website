Subject: P/S Pump Whining


Hi all,
	Since the archives seem to still be down I'm going to throw this
out to the group.  My '86 Westy has started whining from it's power
steering pump.  It whines when it idles, it whines less when I turn the
steering wheel just enough to put pressure on the pump, then it whines
really badly when I actually turn the wheel.  Now I added a little tiny
bit of P/S fluid a few weeks before this started(stupid,stupid,stupid),
but the Bently does not mention how to go about flushing or draining the
P/S system. Is this bit of P/S fluid my problem? The filter? Has anyone
had a similar problem?  Has anyone rebuilt theirs with the $35 gasket kit
from VW?  I'm really scared that it might be the pump itself...$950!
from VW.  Any info on this at all would be GREATLY appreciated. TIA
