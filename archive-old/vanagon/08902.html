Subject: Epilogue: oh no! throttle cable jammed


Well, after trying a half can of liquid wrench, tapping with hammers, 
cutting the tube housing the cable to get at the cable itself, and 
several hours of frustration, it bacame clear that the tube, rather than 
than the cable itself was the culprit.  I had cut a section out of the 
tube just forward (FIF) of the first lateral frame member forward of the 
rear axle, and running a reamer from the engine compartment to that gap 
in the tube was not only nearly impossible, but once I finaly got the 
thing through I got _lots_ of rusty crud.  

The rear section of the tube housing the throttle cable had rusted itself 
closed, just like fat in a clogged artery.  Yuck.  It's curious that this 
rear section (goes up and over the gearbox) rusted while the rest did 
not, as I would have expected the lowest section to be the first to go 
since water would normally settle there.  Oh well.

So I had to take it to a shop (screw driver in the throttle body giving 
me a fixed rpm) where they weld in a new piece of tubing using over-sized 
brake tubing.  Pretty cheap, and now the pedal is smooooth!  I'm happy to 
take my satisfaction where I can.

Moral of the story: If you're having real problems getting your old cable 
out, or a new one in, it may be more than the cable.  If it's the tube 
itself, have a new section welded in and save yourself the heartache.  It 
cost me about $35.00 (Canadian), and my shop had the car for only a 
couple of hours.  Happy!

Tobin
