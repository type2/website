Subject:      Microfiche:   How to order yours.......

WOW!!
  I knew the fiche were popular but really..   Ok due to the high demand
for the mircofiche, I've decieded on a new plan.

If you want a fiche,  send me a SASE the envelope must big big enough to
send a piece of 8 1/2 X 11 sheet of paper in it WITHOUT bending.

Tell me what fiche you want IE: &quot;'85 Vanagon and camper.&quot;  I can tell
you that VW breaks up Vanagon's into about 4 different films: '80-'85,
86-88, 89-92 and 86-91 syncro. Camper is by itself.

If you desire a watercooled car please tell me where it was built.
Golf's and rabbits could be either US, German or Mexican built.  Jetta's
were built in either Germany or Mexico.   For those who are not sure.
Here is a little trick.  Check the first digit of your VIN number.

1= USA
3= Mexico
W= Germany.

All buses are built in Germany.
Ok, so just send the request to:

Jim Digennaro
20 First st
Adams,MA 01220

The postage on the envelope should be about 78 cents.
I wouldn't be insulted if there was a donation in the envelope.  =)

Its first come first serve and I have hundereds of fishe, (An Aquarium)
=)  let me know. Take care.
