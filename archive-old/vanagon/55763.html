Subject: Tierra del Fuego

I'm setting up a 'Tierra' mailing list, but until it's done...

So when do you want to go?  The equator is in Equador, so most of the trip
(~56 degrees of latitude) will be below the equator.  From here to Equador
is about 37 degrees.

The latitude of Tierra is approximately that of Sitka, Alaska.  The town at
the end of the world is Usuahia, Argentina.  They have an english site at
     http://www.cyberush_dot_com.ar/ushuaia54/default.htm

There is camping in Ushuahia, incidentally, with 'al acampante servicios'
(http://200.32.36.200/ushuaia/lagoroca/).

It *does* snow down there, and we probably want to avoid that.  I'd suggest
trying to arrive in Ushuahia during mid-summer, so that we get Spring
conditions heading south, and fall conditions heading North.  (Note that
heading North things will be getting warmer...)

How does Christmas in Ushuahia sound?

Ron
