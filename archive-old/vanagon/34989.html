Subject: Re: ASI ? Conversion

Don't know about the conversion, but I'm glad to hear you might be 
getting another bus. With all the problems you've had with the other one, 
*I* was getting discouraged...and I'm the guy with only about 300 miles 
on a bus I've had since July.

If it's not one thing, it's another...but I'm going to win this rat race 
in the end.

good luck! Joe
