Subject: RE: Oversize Tires for Syncro Westies 

&gt;While I'm on this thread, does anyone know of aftermarket coil springs that 
&gt;would fit a later-model vanagon, to give a stiffer ride and maybe even more 
&gt;clearance? I've looked into this with local (San Diego) FLAPS and suspension 

No aftermarket, not up here. You may need a wheel alignment if the older 
Vanagon springs are much different. Tried to get used Syncro springs? Derek 
Drew sent an article about an Australian Westy Syncro beefed up with springs 
with wire diameter 2mm larger than stock Syncro size, and dual shocks up 
front, HD in rear. If you haven't a copy of the VAG bulletin on difficult 
driving mods, from Tobin Copley GET ONE. Excellent excellent drawings for 
2WD vanagon skid plates, from front tire to oil pan, 4 plates + some misc 
pieces. You could do a great job of setting up your Westy for most rough 
conditions except soft sand/mud.
