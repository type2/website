&gt; There has been problems with other w/c VWs in the coolant light
&gt; circuitry - 

I can second this.  On a very rare occasion, as in maybe 4-6 times since
'85, my Golf has displayed this interesting characteristic.  I've always
written it off as an increase in sun spot activity or possibly getting
caught in a magnetic flux capacitance wave.
