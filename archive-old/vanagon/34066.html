Subject: Starter motor problems

All,


	At the moment i am having a lot of trouble from the 6V starter 
	i have installed in my van,
	Does anybody know whether the older style starters (6 Volt)
	have a different size dog gear, to the later starters.
	
	Also i fitted a 6 Volt starter the other day and when i tryed
	to start the engine the starter was turning the engine over the
	wrong way, i figured that this starter motor must be from
	a Volkswagen fire pump engine or something, anybody have
	any ideas? I have replaced it with another starter.
	but i am not sure if this one is right as well, i have a 36HP
	engine. Any help would be great.

Cheers,
	Ben Ryan
