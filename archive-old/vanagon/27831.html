Whoa - that change from Daylight Savings time *really* affects some
people...

&gt; Sorry for the tone of my last post. I didn't mean to be rude. I just 
&gt; wanted to make sure that it didn't turn into a thread.

Whopee! It's a thread now!

Seriously, though - I didn't want all the mail in my inbox either, and
the digests get too voluminous, so I just read Skip's auto-HTML-ified
version of the list on the Automatrix web server at:

Looks alot like a newsgroup from this perspective, and the slight extra
hassle to post is probably a good thing.  Hope this solves the original
problem. (Dave, you can unzip the asbestos suit now...)
