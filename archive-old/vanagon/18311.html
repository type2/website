&gt;&gt;Hold on... I didn't think wasserboxers had a cold start valve. Am I
&gt;&gt;wrong?

&gt;&gt;basically just another fuel injector in the middle of your intake manifold, 
&gt;&gt;provides extra fuel when the motor is cold.
&gt;&gt;

Weeeeeeeellllllll..., there are cold start injectors, 4 of them mounted at
the entrance of each intake near cylinder heads. I believe they feed the
engine more gas when the engine is cold...
