Subject: Re: Synthetic Oils

Yes todd, i heard precisely the same thing.  A story I used to tell people
that wanted to buy synthetic motor oil, when i worked in the auto parts biz
was,  If you were to buy your sweetie an engagement ring or some other form
of jewlery, would you buy a cubic zirconia for $1000 or a diamond of equal
sixe for $200?  Nothing more....

&gt;The story I heard about shrinking/swelling seals and synthetic oils is this:
&gt;
&gt;Conventional oils cause seals to swell slightly, switching to synthetic causes
&gt;the the seals to shrink to their normal size sometimes causing small leaks.
