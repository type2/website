:)  now THIS one has some possibilities!!! applause, applause, applause.
it reminds me a a slightly un-official version in the army:

over hill, over dale, we don't know our head from tail,
as the cassions go rolling along.
ready, fire! hurry, load! as we scamper down the road,
as the cassions go rolling along.

if we see any brass, then we must get off our ass,
as the cassions go rolling along.
...
and i can't remember any more of it. :)

but will seems to have captured the Essence of Bus:  Hurry Slowly.  :)
or in german, Eile mit Weile.  (more hurry, less speed!).

hmmmm. that's a good one, will. can you imagine a bunch of insobrietus
(fancy word meaning: snockered) bus drivers, sitting around a camp fire
(or perhaps a burning tire from a Chevy), bellowing such a tune at the
top of their lungs?  oh, the mind boggles ...
