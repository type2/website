&gt; Hmmm....
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it's coincidental, but I just installed a new fuel pump over the
&gt; weekend!  I thought the old pump was failing because after the warm
&gt; engine sat for 5 minutes or so, starting it again was very hard.  The
&gt; new pump didn't take care of this problem :(

Reaching back into the nether regions, I seem to remember having
the same trouble after replacing the fuel pump on my '69 bug. I
was getting 8 mpg and brown froth out of the dipstick.

Check that the spacer (plastic thing) and gaskets are on, and
that the screws are tight, I guess. Reading up on fuel pumps 
couldn't hurt either......

G'luck
