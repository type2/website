&gt;&gt; I just got my West Coast Metric Catalogue, which I was dutifully perusing,
&gt;&gt; when I noticed it lists a seal for Westys which goes on the drivers-side
&gt;&gt; rear panel, where that body piece is that they put in to look like the
&gt;&gt; place where the middle sliding door track goes on the passangers sideith my &gt;

&gt;Well if you check out your bus you'll see that the driver's and passenger's
side 
&gt;both have the removeable panel with a rubber seal behind it.  I guess this is 
&gt;because VW did offer buses with sliding doors on both sides (although they
were not 
&gt;very common -- I think it was an option).

I always thought that the idea was to make the body adaptable for RHD.  If
you look under the front mat, you will see the unused stamping for the RHD
steering wheel and in the center cetion there are mounts for the half-seat
to be mounted on the right.  Likewise, if you are driving on the right, the
sliding door should be on the left, so the stamping and cover are present,
but unused.  Mayhap on of our non-colonial confreres will confirm or deny
this guess?
