&gt;I have a '65 Deluxe that has been converted to 12V.  Well, almost....
&gt;THe system is set up such:  2 6V batteries in series, of which the starter
&gt;and wiper are tapped off of the first 6V battery.  This allows me to have
&gt;a couple of 6V circuits to run the starter and the wiper.  Lately (given
&gt;the cold weather - 6 F this morn.) I've been having trouble keeping charge
&gt;in the batteries.  Even a new Interstate (fairly moderate CCA) is not doing
&gt;the job.  I think for this system to werk well, the batteries should be
&gt;as identical as possible. (I seem to remember a thread on this a while back
&gt;but do not know the details as to why.)
&gt;
&gt;I am contemplating to switch this set up such that I have one 12V battery and
&gt;replacing the 6V wiper motor with one out of a '67 (12V).  Can I keep the
&gt;starter (6V) in this setup?  I am under the impression that the starter will
&gt;suffice as it is only briefly used (i.e., for starting) and the brief exposure
&gt;to 12V will allow me to get by for some time before I do this properly and
&gt;replace the flywheel and starter to a 12V setup (in a few years?).  Is this
&gt;so?
&gt;

Yes, but the starter won't last forever.  Also, keep in mind that the 12v
flywheel won't fit in the bell housing of the 6v trans without grinding
away some of the metal, it's a bigger diameter.  I've done it and wihile
it's a pain it can be done successfully.
Good luck

James
