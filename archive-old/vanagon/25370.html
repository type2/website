&gt;Has anyone ordered the heater/defroster assist kit from either Barney's
&gt;or J.C. Whitney?  Just wondering whether it is good and if is difficult 
&gt;to install.  This kit sucks more heat to the front of the bus because
&gt;the heat has to travel such a long distance.

This has been reported elsewhere and was, I believe, David Carment's
original idea. West Marine sells a 4in. ID inline fan for less than $20,
the same fan that JC Whipme sells for $60 or so.

The additional fan does help defrost the windshield, but I have not
noticed significantly more heat.
