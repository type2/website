Subject: Bodymen from Hell(vlong flame)

&quot;David Easterwood&quot; &lt;deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu&gt;
was mentioning that he wannted to get his bus painted.
Then Ray Hale suggested that Dave raise his right hand and swear that he was
NOT going to restore the bus etc.

This morning I stopped by the bodyshop where my bus is STILL sits unpainted
after eleven months. It is down to the last little &quot;teeney weeney-itsy
bitsy&quot; sanding before the initial painting of the small parts. I told the
guy to stay on it and get it done because I needed a month to assemble the
bus prior to the Phoenix College Show and the Phoenix Bug-o-Rama which is in
October!. We had planned on showing the '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell&quot; at the
Spring Bug-o-rama, missed that date, looked forward to the SOTO/Classic in
June, and then thought for sure we'd have it up and running at least for the
AZ Bus Club Jerome Jmaboree in September! The bodyman lurches into action
(conversationally) and says &quot;Oh yeah, fine! That's just the thing! (Huff,
Huff) Everyone brings their car in here 'just to get painted', then next
thing you know they wanna take out and show it! If they'd tell me at the
beginning I'd charge'em TEN thousand dollars!! That kinda pisses me off!&quot;  I
just told him that I wanted the ****ing bus' bodywork finished and
painted/completed and out of his shop and that there was no reason to
prolong the situation (or insert millions of insurance jobs in between).
Move on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I later thought what business is it of his what people do with their
vehicles after it leaves his shop?! No names will be mentioned due to the
recent legal thread... But boy do I ever wanna say don't EVER take your
vehicle to xxxxxxxxx bodyshop in xxxxx,Arizona. All during the process I
have felt that we were on the verge of proceding to completion on this bus
from hell, then delays, then promises, then repetition of the cycle. I
rationalized If I pulled the bus and went elsewhere I would only be at the
dirty end of the waiting line again. It seems that body/paint folk don't
work by stated amount any longer but as a commercial artist, I was never
allowed to just run the clock and tell the customer to &quot;pull my finger&quot;
until I was good and ready to deliver. 

OK, there is a major difference between a quickie lick and stick paint job
and a full on restoration. But if a customer is paying by the freakin hour
to get the thing done shouldn't the quality of craftsmanship be at one level
(which should be the best that the shop can do)-period. If the agreement is
for a $XX.00 paint job then everyone needs to understand what that will
include. How &quot;unexpected discoveries&quot; will be addressed should be discussed
in general before the job starts and brought to the customer's attention
when they crop up.  &quot;Customer changes&quot; and add-ons should be discussed in a
similar manner at the same time- BEFORE the job starts.
Telling the bodyshop that you want a lick and stick job in a short time
frame, then waiting until it's half way done will cost money and cause delays.

If anyone out there is about to get anything painted I highly suggest
getting an agreement in writing *legal contract* including how many
insurance jobs will cut in line ahead of you, delivery date, and budget cap,
document every delay or change regardless who caused it (customer/shop),
items discussed, and every steps through out the duration of the process.
Use of a video camera is a great idea. Record the process on a weekly basis
with a time/date stamp showing and stay on the shops back if delays occur
(if it's the shops fault). The video will be a neat item to show or view
after the thing is done. The video will be helpful in showing where pieces
went during the reassembly, could be used at the end to see what the before
and after differences are and could possibly be used in court if needed.

I am completely sick to death of vendors that say that they have an item/or
service for sale and then don't step up to the plate or make you wait for
ever while they get their act together. I used to think that folks that
spent zillions on the restos in the magazines were putzes but I am finding
that if you aren't the quintesencial rennisance &quot;person&quot; ala
machinist/mechanic/welder/ bodyworker/painter expert/part
locator/politician/legal expert/bagman for the mob that you are stuck with a
mediocre end result or can easily get buried in the project. The value of a
cherry unrestored vehicle is highly appreciated right now. Buttheads like
this particular person take the enjoyment out of owning and working on VWs.
Court action at this point in time would be like &quot;pouring water&quot; up a rope. 

Vendors that do everything in their power to be of service to the customers
are highly appreciated and will thrive. It's my opinion that vendors that
don't will eventually suffer the impact of word of mouth from the VW
community at large. Customers have the responsibiility to specify the exact
needs that they have and do their homework prior to contacting/engaging in
business with the vendors, and be responsible for paying for what they order
in a timely manner.

I will get my bus out, assemble it and work my way out of &quot;Resto burn out.&quot;
Will I rush right out to restore or even paint another VW? I Think not! My
single cab will remain a rat but will run great. I will be the guy driving
it with a smile.

Sorry for the long post. *Flame mode is now switched to OFF*
Good Luck Dave!
