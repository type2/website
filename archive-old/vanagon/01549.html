&gt; Ok i got my '73 bus up and running yesterday.  It had been sitting for
&gt; quite some time - like a coupla years.  Occassionally i would start it up
&gt; and tool down the drive.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ater hitting the road for about 15-20mins yesterday, i smelled burning
&gt; brakes.  Sure enough the front pads were firmly against the disc. 
&gt; Hammering against them would loosen them, but once i pushed on the brake
&gt; they would lock up again.  

Sounds like your caliper bores got a little gummed up.  You can probably
fix this for free by taking the calipers apart and cleaning up the bores
with emery (sp) paper or steel wool.  Just smooth it down until the pistons
slide freely - no more.  If you want to do a (probably) better job, just
buy a rebuild kit or rebuilt calipers.
