-- [ From: Mark Howser * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

I've got a rattling noise on the right rear of my van.  It occurs when I'm
moving, especially when I get close to upshifting to the next gear.  I
checked the outside CV boot on the right rear of my van.  It was torn.  I
jacked up the rear end and there seem to be a  play in the wheel.  

Question:   Is this a failing CV joint?  What else can I do to confirm
that's what it is?

If it is failing, what is inviolved in replacing it?  What tools will I need
?

I priced a CV joint at my FLAPS and it was $108.  Is that reasonable? 
Should I avoid any suppliers/manufacturers?

TIA,

Mark Howser
