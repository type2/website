&gt; &quot;The carb throttle plate is leaking and because of the leak it is going to run
&gt; very rough, tune-up or not.  The plate in question is unique to the '72 and
&gt; has not been manufactured for quite some time.  For this reason (amongst
&gt; others I don't know about) the '72 is not a desireable year to own.   
&gt; We send them out to have the throttle shaft bushings re-built (he might
&gt; have said to Remco?) It's going to cost $250 to have them re-built and another
&gt; $200 or so in labor charges.&quot;

Outrageous.  I had a 73 Capri with the throttle bore so worn it was oval
shaped.  Still idled smooth and steady at 800 rpm.  I think this thing
with worn throttle shaft bores is *way* exaggerated.  But I'm sure some
automotive &quot;expert&quot; will flame me for saying that.
 
&gt; So, is Gunther blowing smoke up my tail pipe?.  After the wheelin' in 
&gt; Baja I would not be too suprised about this or any other leak, but is 
&gt; this a problem on the '72's and is his price estimate accurate?  

I'd say it's about an hour's work to R&amp;R the carbs, and $50 for a shop
to re-bush the throttle bores.  Should top out at $150.  Max.  I'll do
it myself for that kind of money.  I'm only an hour and a half from you.

 																	Is 
&gt; there any other solution?  The '72 has dual carbs, would converting 
&gt; to a single larger carb be a better solution, or would the CA smog 
&gt; test prohibit this?

Yes, and Yes, unless you are not concerned with emissions legality for
whatever reason.

&gt; I've been planning on spending some bucks on a nice paint job and 
&gt; redoing the interior (not to mention the Westy pop-top I asked about 
&gt; lately), but with this seed of doubt planted about the inferior year 
&gt; of manufacture, would the cash be better spent on another bus?

Nope.  I've been thinking about it lately, and I'm kinda wishing I had a
72 instead of my 73. Less smog and I don't really care about the access
hatch.  I guess a 71 might be considered a better year, but each year
has its strong points.  Not worth starting over for, IMHO.

P.S.  I can give you a source for the idle cutoff solenoids for about
$20 each, and used ones are plentiful at the boneyards, if you ever have
that problem again.
