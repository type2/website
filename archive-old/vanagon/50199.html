Subject: Westy camper top mods for a Syncro GL?


Hello everyone!

This summer I've been doing alot of van camping in my 87 Syncro GL and I 
want more room.  What I'm considering is getting the camper top from a 
thrashed westfalia and having it put on my Syncro.

Has anyone from the list ever done this, know somebody that has or know of a 
shop or person that does the modifications.  Right now I'm collecting 
information about the mod, like:  what metal cutting is required, cost, how 
it might affect my van (noise, water integrity, regular maintenance 
required, mpg), any suggestions for improvements over stock, etc.

If anyone has information regarding this mod, please fill me in.  Also, if 
there have been such discussions in the past, let me know, and I'll go off 
and search the archives.

Please respond to me directly (I have limited time to do my email since I 
have access only at work).

Thanks much!
