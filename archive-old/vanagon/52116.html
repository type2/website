Subject: Whitestar Tire Chains?

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,
     
       Well, I have read all the responses (thanks to all that have 
     responded) thus far and have started looking for some standard chains 
     and a cheap 12v air pump.  I have found some chains made by a company 
     called Whitestar that do not need to be fastened on the inner side of 
     the tire.  Instead, they have a flexible split ring that goes to the 
     inside of the tire and a single &quot;easy latch&quot; on outer side of the tire. 
      I have not seen them in person yet, but the sales person I talked to 
     on the phone says they sell these the most and have not had any 
     complaints with them.  Has anyone had or heard about these types of 
     chains?  
       My main need for these are my occasional trips through the local 
     mountain passes.  I live in a valley and don't need them for everyday 
     use.  But, I would like something that keeps me from sliding on the 
     road when I go into the mountains and hit the snow line.  It sounds 
     like the chains are a little better for traction; and, I don't mind the 
     harder install (Provided it's straight forward and reasonable to do in 
     the snow) if the traction is better.
       Any comments on the Whitestars or other advice is appreciated
     
     Thanks,
