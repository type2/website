Dear Ken,
When I was 16 yrs old, I purchased a `61 Kombi. I turned it into a camper
over a period of about 6 mos. I drove it for 3 yrs before selling it
because I was tired of going 60 miles per hour when everyone else was doing
70. That sale haunted me for the rest of my life... I kept having dreams
that I still owned it but just forgot where I parked it...The dreams abated
after the purchase of the `82 diesel Westy...Good Luck,
Bob Bellanca
`81 Diesel Rabbit
`84 Turbo Diesel Jetta
`82 1.9L Turbo Diesel Westfalia

&gt; Fellow Vanagon owners: 
&gt; 	I knew I made a mistake when I priced it. A young couple asked how much
&gt; I would cost to buy my 1984 Westy. It named my price and they didn't
&gt; even flinch.  She called the nexted day to arange finanacing and said
&gt; she would call me back..    
&gt; 	The business person in me says &quot;It's only a car&quot;.  But I feel ill when
&gt; I think about selling it.  It makes no since to feel this way  given the
&gt; vans age and potential for problems.  I have the VW vanagon diease
&gt; badly.  
&gt; 	Can a person experience withdrawls from selling a Vanagon?
&gt; I know I all most experience an overdose when I had Two broken Vanagons
&gt; in my driveway.
&gt; It is silly to place so much sentinmental valve on a vehicle. It is
&gt; amazing how my friend and family impose human like characteristic on the
&gt; Van.   It will seem like a family member is gone if they buy the van.
&gt; 
&gt; Boys and their toys.
&gt; The only problem is the older the boy, the the more expensive his toy.
