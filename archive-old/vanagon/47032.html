Subject: Re: looking for Vanagon 1.9 longblock or complete..

Jon,

  I usually have a complete motor for sale (used).  I've sold them all 
at present but still wanted to touch base with you and let you know who 
I am.

  I am connected to a very large source of Quality VW parts.  I have a 
Web page that has price lists of the common parts needed buy us VW 
people.

  I sold one of my last engines to Gerry Skerbitz, the list admin.  I'll 
ship anything that a person might want and I also part out many VW's 
too. This week a Bug,Type 3 and a 81 Vanagon.  I have a large supply of 
used stuff too.  If someone wanted a special part I'd take it off my 
next part out of that type of VW.

  Again sorry I don't have an engine at this time, but if you take the 
time to check out my web site I think you'll like what you see!
