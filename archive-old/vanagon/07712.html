Actually replacing the flaps on the 81 does not require pulling the
engine. it does require removing the FI and electronic ignition and the
top most tin - at most a 2 hour job- once you know what you are doing. How
do I know? Because over the course of two days I removed, replaced,
removed and replaced two engines in a westfalia. Both were GEX's; on the
first the end play was too tight and so out it came after it became
apparent the starter would not turn the engine over (GEX replaced the
engine hassle free). On both occasions the FI went in after the engine was
in place, the tin can thereby be easily removed given accesss to the
heater flaps.
Actually, removing all of the engine-related  components and cleaning them and
checking
their integrity (especially where hoses are concerned) is not a bad
idea....

A good idea is to run a series of tests on all the components electrical
and FI related. Ignition wires, plugs, filters and hoses should IMHO be
replaced as a matter of course whether they have been tested or not....DC
