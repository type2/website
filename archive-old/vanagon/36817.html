Subject: intermitent starting problem, help


Ok, this problem with my 87 Syncro goes back a while.  When I initially 
posted about the cold starting problem, where the idiot lights come on, and 
a faint humming is heard from the engine compartment, but no starter 
selenoid click or starter crank, just silence when the engine is cold, the 
List seemed to converge on the main relays in the relay box on the left side 
of the engine compartment.  I tried replacing both relays (main and fuel) 
but the problem remains, and is degrading:  frequency of no start is 
increasing (sometimes it'll start right up, other times there is a prolonged 
hesitation) and the length of hesitation is increasing.  Until this morning, 
wouldn't start for about 15 min and finally turned over, same symptoms.  I 
took it to the dealer.  His eyes lit up when I said intermitent electrical 
problem $$.  Two guys to diagnose at $58/hour.

Does the List have any suggestions about this problem?
