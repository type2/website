&lt;&lt; This past August I spotted a Vanagon GL '91 or '92 in for service at a
 local VW shop. This Vanagon had sliding doors on both sides.  When I
 asked about this early Chry**** MiniV** invention, I was told that it
 was a factory option. In this case for a man with a wheel chair. He had
 a power lift mounted inside of the left sliding door.

WOW that's really a rare on on this continent.  I've heard these were
available in Germany, but I've never even heard of one in North America.  Has
anyone else seen one of these?
