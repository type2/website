&gt; Aaaarrrg!
&gt; Last night rain clouds got together and conspired to drown my poor bus. My
&gt; bus (Helga) fought mightily, but they sent their little warriors through a
&gt; faulty seal in the sunroof. As she warmed up this morning, I opened the sun
&gt; roof and found about a quarter inch of water around the track. No problem,
&gt; right? WRONG! As we traveled along, I came to a stop on a decline. All of a
&gt; sudden water came rushing out of the leading edge of the sun roof. I'm
&gt; talking about a gallons worth, easily a gallons worth. It soaked both front
&gt; seats, the mats both fore and aft, and even the dash. Did anyone see that
&gt; video clip of the fire extinguisher going off during an NBA pre-game? It
&gt; felt like that. Where the hell was all that water hiding? Do you think it's
&gt; still there ...waiting for me?
&gt;
This used to happen to me in my '78 before Iinstalled the pop-top. As
far as I can tell, there is a pretty sizable &quot;reservoir&quot;  where the
moonroof goes when you roll it back. Iremember the first time Itook my
parents out in my &quot;new&quot; bus, and we stopped, my dad got SOAKED! (and was
not too pleased, especially since I hadn't told them I bought the bus.
But yes, the water will collect back there and wait for you. Since my
track for the roof didn't work anyway, I sealed it up, and then
eventually put the pop top on...
Anyway
Richard
