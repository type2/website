Subject: Carpet or Something else?

hey now,

now that rumba's front end and engine are doing well, i'm concentrating on
the interior. i've had carpet before but know from experience it's going to
get dirty and will eventually be taken out. any suggestion on what to use to
protect the floor that is relatively tough yet looks spiffy?
