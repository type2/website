&gt;The transmission was just rebuilt on my 86 Syncro.  Now, shifting is tight 
&gt;from 3rd down into 2nd and down into 1st.  Generally it is OK strating in 
&gt;1st and shifting into 2nd, though at times it's tight.   Shifting up into 
&gt;3rd is tough sometimes, but it doesn't seem to follow a particular pattern.
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible the first two gears were not aligned correctly?


   I wonder who rebuilt this Trans?  What Fluid was used GL-$ or GL-5, GL-4
should have been used.

  How many miles have been driven on the rebuild and has the symptom gotten
better or worse?

  Just the questions I'd take into consideration if We (volks Cafe) had done
the rebuild and our customer had this kind of problem.

  Also, What had &quot;Failed&quot; in the trans to cause it to be rebuilt.  Did all
&quot;NEW&quot; Syncro's get put in during the rebuild ECT.

  Just my thoughts on this, I've driven a number of Vanagons after having
their trannies rebuilt (all by the same person), and found some to be
tighter in between gears, after a 1000 miles or so, sometimes with the fluid
changed to Synthetic, the trans would free-up.

  I'm lucky in the aspect that I get to drive alot of different Vanagons and
VW's every day (20 or so).  My JOB often is to be Very attentive to the
Symptoms that a peticular car has.  I was Taught to be very aware of
different sounds and idiosyncracies that these cars have.

  Just thought I'd post about this trans symptom due to the faqct that I
have Felt it many times, and been able to see them change or not change.
