Subject: electric heaters?

Well I know this is undoubtedly covered somewhere but after moving
last weekend in 6F weather even with my current recirculating heat
system, then getting clobbered by an ice storm leaving 1/4&quot; of ice on
the entire Bus making me 20 minutes late for work in only my second week
at work (Corrado is in shop, last minute 49,800 mile warranty work) I
demand a solution.  What I'm wondering is if anybody knos if the company
that use to be called something like &quot;Instant Auto Heaters&quot; out of
somewhere in NY still exists.  I once had a flyer but have lost it they
had a range of 12V, 36V and 48V (others for electric cars) heaters.  The
12V models featured models that drew between like 30-75 amp 300-1000 or
so watts.  I had thought for the old '76 but didn't figure the 45 amp
alternator was up to the task but since the Westy has the dual
batteries, I figure if I stuck to the 30 amp model which was rated at
like a 12F temp increase on a 32F ambient day moving 100cfm I should be
OK.  I'm thinking of putting it infront of the forward distibution box
and only using it for 5-10 minutes a day to defrost, no more.  Has
anyone seen anything like these anymore? They were real slick units, an
inline blower and coil package were like in a 3&quot; cylinder tube maybe 6&quot;
long, would fit wonderfully in that front heater flex tube up under the
pedal splash pan I reckon.  Price then was about $200 (in '89 or so) and
does not particularly matter to me anyway.  If anyone has other similar
suggestions I'm interested.  On a related subject, all the manuals list
a 65 amp alternator for Canadian models with the 2.0 AFC engine, did
this ever exist and if so anybody know the Bosch part number? (Though I
figure without a core I'm looking better than $200 there as well)
