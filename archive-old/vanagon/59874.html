Subject: 91 Vanagon Losing Power Trying to Be &quot;Cool&quot;

Thanks for all your help with the AC question we sent out last night.  Now we
have another question for all you Volks Heads.  When the AC is turned on the
van wants to die and becomes sluggish.  We know the engine is miniscule for
the size of the car, but it should not drain the power that badly.  Any ideas
and suggestions appreciated as always.  P.S.- Althea has an automatic
transmission.  Thanks again, Dan &amp; Christine
