Subject: Re: Where's the ID character letters on Vanagon tranny? 
Date: Thu, 10 Jul 1997 07:03:47 -0700


&gt; I've been trying to find the ID character letters on the tranny of my `82
&gt; Diesel Westy. I've found a string of numbers which I believe may be the
&gt; case part number but that's it. Any Suggestions?

On mine,  it's on the main case, left corner between side and bottom,
between the left output flange and front of case.  As you read the letters
and numbers, the two-letter code will be first, i.e., on the left.  There
is a rib through the middle of the code, so be sure to clean off enough of
the case to find it, say 2&quot; by 3&quot; or 4&quot;.

Mike
