Howdy!  

So who is thinking about coming to St.Louis this weekend? Drop me a note
if you do!

As I may have mentioned before, as much as I would love to attend Busses
by the Arch, I'm not sure I can afford the time. Nevertheless, should you
guys and gals get bored out there in the boonies after sunset, why don't
you drive down to University City and I'll show you around the bar and
pizza scene. Either Friday or Saturday night would be good. Whaddya think? 

Well, ok, I'll try to participate on Saturday, but no promises :)

Cheers!
