Subject: Re: ? WHO BUYS SALVAGE VANS?

&gt;      I saw some traffic about some places that buy used vans to part-out or
&gt;      restore.  Does anyone know off-hand the names and locations of these
&gt;      places?  One I believe was in So Florida.
&gt; 

I'm going to interject, I went and looked at this van yesterday, 
somebody should buy it from Ed.  To me it frankly wasn't just quite 
enough of an improvement to justify the trouble of swapping the 
engine from the '85 over, but Ed's is a fairly straight '83, NO real 
seam rust, looks bad now but would probably polish out to fairly OK 
paint. A lot of minor surface bumps and dings here and there as these 
things tend to.   Best carpet I've ever seen in a van, OK interior, A/C 
complete present and looking like it would work, and no corrosion at 
all underneath on the brakes, suspension, mechanicals.  New starter, 
KYB's in the rear, etc.  Unfortunately engine is a gonner, some oil 
in coolant system, and what stopped me old front bumper hit has 
crumpled the front slightly (NOT BAD MIND YOU) and fixed in a very 
novel manner.  Still if one had an engine and a terribly rusty or 
bent body this would be a very sound machine to put it in.  As it is, 
worth whatever the tranny, A/C, running gear, etc is worth.  I should 
really buy it myself but just can't bring myself to do it.  He was 
asking about $500 a while back I'm not sure exactly where that is 
now.  You could part it over $1000 if you had the time and place.  
But the van would be a good complete driver if you put an engine in 
it, not pretty but solid and functional.  Van has about 155k on it.
