&gt;Gerry has been working just fine for over a week now. He was down for
&gt;about 3 weeks prior to last week. So if you were subscribed you should be
&gt;and should hvae been getting VANAGON list mail.
&gt;
&gt;... keep in mind that you're part of a group of &quot;special&quot; listees
&gt;who get their access through one of several ISP's on our (VANAGON LIST
&gt;adminstrators) &quot;GRAY LIST&quot;. Approximately 80+% of our mail delivery errror
&gt;messages come from only 2-3 Internet nodes (e.g., AOL, Compuserve).

I had to re up also, not part of one of the big isp's. As far as I know my
mail box has never been full. I went to vanagon_dot_com to see what was wrong,
imagine my surprise when I found out nothing was.
I did miss the vw posts.
I figured it was one of those things. Thought you might like to know, might
not too!

Later,
