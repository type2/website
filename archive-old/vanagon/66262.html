Subject:      I'M BACK!!   (E-mail/voice-mail was down)

For anyone trying to reach me via e-mail or phone over the last few days,
my computer crashed the other day, leaving me with no e-mail access or
order-processing software, and all but putting me out of business for a
couple of days.  Ironically, this occurred as I was in the process of
putting in a backup system that could be used in just such an emergency.

Besides not receiving any e-mail, I wasn't even able to answer the phone
some of the time because of having to run out for computer parts, talk to
tech support people, etc.  To make matters worse, since my voice mail is
run by my computer, it was down, too, so some callers got no answer at all.

I'll be working day &amp; night to catch up with e-mail sent to me over the
last few days. There shouldn't be a need to re-send, as I was able to
retrieve them once I went back up again.  Just wanted to quickly let as
many people as possible know that I haven't been ignoring you.

Thanks,
