So Drew Jenkins says:
&gt; 
&gt; It burns me because I specifically mentioned to the service manager that
&gt; I saw coolent leaking from this part.  This is the first and last time 
&gt; this dealer will ever do any work on my vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; Talk about frustrating!

Yep, and I don't think VW is listening very well.  I get phone calls and
post cards from them asking how I liked the recent service I had.  I write
exactly how I feel and they apparently don't listen.  But they keep sending
flyers on their new cars thinking I'm going to buy something else from
them????  :[ !!!
