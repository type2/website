&gt;I definitely want either a westy (Vanagon) or a camper (Eurovan). I

Hi Brent,
I bought my sisters Vanagon in March of 96 and am selling it now
because I want to be able to pull a motorcycle trailer. So I bought a
Suburban.  Here's the story on the Westy:

The van is in awsome shape. 
Its a 1987. 
The engine was worked on at 100,000 miles. 
It had a total valve job and head gasket replacement at a certified VW
dealer! Runs great.
Engine now has 128,000 on it.
My sister had a brand new top ordered from Germany because she tore
the canvas on the old top. The top was $5,000.00 and is brand,
spanking new. I've only popped it up 3 times.
Stove and fridge work great.
The interior of this van is in impeccable shape. No holes or tears in
upholstery. Curtains all around.

The one thing it does need is a new sunroof, because they reinstalled
the old one on the new top. It should be a cinch to replace.

No rust on body and paint is like new. Original paint. Sort of a sandy
bronze-beige. Nice.

History:
My sister was living in Louisiana and found the Westy in a Denver
paper. She flew out and loved it, so she drove it home. A year later,
she and her hubby were moving to Colorado and badly needed to be out
from under the payments. I paid her 12,000 cash, a fair price.
I've had it for a year and as I said, I bought a Suburban and don't
have time to enjoy camping in the westy like she deserves. I am asking
$10,000 for her. 

Let me know if you are interested and I'll send you more info. I live
in Texas, down near Brownsville. Be sure and tell me where you are
from.
