Subject: Re: What would you do?

Hmm, Do I have incredible luck?
I just sold an '85 van with 145k miles on it.  I never did any engine
work, and the previous owner said that he never did any either(he had no
reason to lie because he gave the vanagon to me).  In fact, he gave me
the vanagon because he thought it needed a head gasket.  It would run
but badly, blow lots of smoke etc.  I put a new ignition contol thingy
on.(actually I stole one off a wrecked saab(different bosch number but
it still worked) that said telefunken on it).  I didn't have the money
to fix the loose front end and the quarter sized hole in the exhaust 2&quot;
from cylinder #3 so I sold it for $600.
