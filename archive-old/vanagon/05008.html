Subject: RE: 6-ply tires???

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing to check. The Sears guys inflated my tires to 30 PSI all around,
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than to the manual's specifications.
&gt; &gt; 
 
I'm confused.  What's wrong with Gislaved, etc. besides price?  I'm running their
reinforced 185/14s and have been very pleased with wear, traction, etc.

Jack
