Some one on the list asked me to keep an eye on busses for sale in Sweden, I
have two leads which I would like to pass on but, as the result of a very
serious hard disk crash, two days back, my files were wiped clean. So whoever
you were, would you contact me once again if you'9re still interested. The
first is '965 westfalia the other a '6'954 bus (former ambulance).
