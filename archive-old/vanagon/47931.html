&gt;         MY speedometer is not accurate. Can somone tell me
&gt;         if your tach is running 3,000 RPM in 4th gear what
&gt;         speed are you going in 4th gear. MY speedo. says
&gt;         I'm going 53 MPH.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;   Use the mile markers on the side of the hiway and a stop watch to calibrate
&gt; the speed and odometer.  All VW speed'o's over read buy about 4 or 5%. This
&gt; helps hide the lack of performance.  Actually, the speedo is supposed to
&gt; overead to maske you drive slower,(the Fed's at work).  The Speedo can be
&gt; reset by resetting the pointer on the shaft.  Larger tires will also remove
&gt; some of the error.
&gt; 
  Here in PA they must measure the milage by air. I tried to check the
  speed by time, it was good to only 1 out of 4 mile markers, and I tried
  this twice.  Checking it to the tach, seams to be right on. I think
  I will be happy with it the way it is. To many other major problem
  to work on.       ERic
