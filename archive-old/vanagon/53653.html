Subject:       Good VW shop near Riverside, CA

Hello all,

My parents are currently in Riverside, CA, and are in need of a new 
front wheel bearing on their '89 Jetta.

They got a quote of $150 from one place, which sounds high to me.

Any suggestions of a reputable shop in the area?

Please e-mail direct asap. Thanks!
