Subject: 87 Syncro - Cost of New Tranny??

Anyone ever do new trannys in their syncro.  Did you replace the syncro
mechanism too.

Is there preventive care to keep the old one goin.  I have not had any
trouble as of yet, the differential lock works too.   But,  Since I have
replaced just about every other part, I assume that this is the next to come.

I guess, what the bottom line is, do I need to start saving now.
