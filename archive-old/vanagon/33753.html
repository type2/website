Subject: Bulletproof tires


As far as I know, the bullet-proof tires used in many applications
have soft foam type rubber filled in them.  You can shoot holes in
them and end up effecting thier balance, but they really do not
deflate.  You'd have to blow up something right underneath one of
these tires to really take it out-of-service.
