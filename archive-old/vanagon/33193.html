&gt; Needless to say, I'm not interested in trying to start it like this.
&gt; In fact, I'm replacing my battery over the weekend - the battery in
&gt; there now is a no-name and I want a heavy-duty Die-Hard or Interstate.

I recommend the Die Hard, but NOT the Die Hard Gold, get the standard
one which is in a black case with multi-colored lettering.  I'd get the
biggest one that will fit, but see below first...

&gt; Before I buy the new battery, I'm looking for suggestions for keeping
&gt; the snow off the top of my battery.

Sure!  Pick up a battery box.  I got mine from West Marine for about 10
bucks.  This will also keep your battery tray from rotting out.  I would
first buy the biggest battery box that will fit in that space (group 27
box may require remounting some things elsewhere) and then get the
biggest battery that will fit in the battery box.
 
&gt; I'm also looking for suggestions on connecting the second battery - the
&gt; PO had removed all traces of it...  If anyone has a Westy 2nd battery
&gt; wiring diagram, it'd be a big help!

This has been discussed many times on the list - you should be able to
find plenty of info in the gopher archives.  E-mail me privately if you
need help with that.
