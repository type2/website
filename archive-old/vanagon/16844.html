&gt;     Another crazy adition is the wood burning stove in the '71 bus. 
&gt; (&quot;We don't need no stinkin' gas heaters!&quot;) Oh, did I mention the guys 
&gt; from Alaska? Hell, I'd burn wood with or without the stove!

ROTFL!  I could just see the family sitting in the bus with a little 
campfire going in the middle.  So what if that headliner cost $150! :)
