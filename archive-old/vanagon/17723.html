 Howdy all. Well, as any true bus freak, I was unable to resist the
calling of my latest project, a '66 Sunroof Deluxe. It is mechanically
really sound, with mostly new everything. The cosmetics, however, leave
a bit to be desired. Basically, it was stripped down. No trim, and no
interior whatsoever. Also, some wonderful person put a lovely sheet of
plexiglass over the sunroof, but at least I do have the necessary
hardware to put in the ragtop. The only other bad thing is a nasty
spare-tire sized dent in the nose, where someone left it in gear, and it
smacked a wall with the mounted spare tire.
  Soooooooooo, I guess my first question is, what's the best way to pull
such a dent? Although the bus came with an extra nose, welding that on
seems to be a tremendous project, for which I don't think I'm ready. 
  Anyway, I will be searching for various door handles and latches and
other hardware as time progresses. Thanks for any and all bodywork words
of wisdom.
Richard
