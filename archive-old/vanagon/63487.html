Hello David,
  Tom Niksch referred you inquiry to me about the rubber wheel arch extensions 
as I modified my syncro last year.

The rubber wheel arch extensions can be ordered from any Volkswagen dealer in 
the world! If they tell you that they are not available then go to another 
dealer. Keep looking for a spare parts department that is willing to help and 
then tell all of your friends to support them. This has worked in Australia!

Here are the part numbers;

Wheel arch trim for vehicles with 14&quot; wheels. (as fitted to the Tri-Star 
Double Cab Pick Up)

Left front upper             251 853 717A
Right front upper           251 853 718A
Left front                       251 853 719A
Right front                     251 853 720A
Left rear                        251 853 817A
Right rear                      251 853 818A

 Wheel arch trim for vehicles with 16&quot; wheels. 

Left front upper             251 853 717
Right front upper           251 853 718
Left front                       251 853 719
Right front                     251 853 720
Left rear                        251 853 817
Right rear                      251 853 818
 
The 16&quot; style trim requires cutting about 1&quot; off the trailing edge of the 
mudguards (fenders?) for about 6&quot;.

I used the 16&quot; style as I have 15&quot; wheels with 215/75x15 B.F.Goodrich All 
Terrains and required a bit of clearance anyway.

If you wish to go ahead with it send me your postal address and I will send 
photos and fitting instructions.

Phill Lander.
