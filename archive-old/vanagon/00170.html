Subject: I want to add a bench seat to my Kombi


I have a '76 Kombi and am considering ripping out the camper
interior stuff (cabinets, shelves, and sink) and replacing
it with another bench seat.  Does anyone know if the tracks
/ holes to install the middle bench seat are in all models,
or if I'll have to find / fabricate something?

Currently I just have 2 front seats and the 2/3 rear bench
seat (the other 1/3 is taken up by a storage container and
ice chest on the left side.

Thanks --



Randy
