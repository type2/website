Subject:      FFriday: ok, a silly song for everybody

Slap-Happy Wanderer?
&lt;to the tune of the Happy Wanderer, or whatever the name of that stupid
song they made us sing all the time in Elementary School!&gt;


I love to drive my vee-dub bus
Out in the countryside,
And as i drive, i love to sing,
My big mouth opened wide!

&lt;chorus&gt;
Feedle-dee, feedle-dah,
Feedle-dee, feedle-rah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah,
Feedle-dee, feedle-dah,
Out in the countryside!

The only thing that gives me grief
Out in the countryside,
Is bugs that fly between my teeth
When my mouth's opened wide!

&lt;chorus&gt;

I wave at every bus I see,
And sometimes they wave back,
But often they stare back at me,
Like I crawled out from a crack!

&lt;chorus&gt;

I stop for gas at country stores,
When full my tank is not,
Where Bubbas ask what kind of car
Is that thing that I've got.

&lt;chorus&gt;

I carry food along with me,
In case I want to eat,
Cause road-kill don't agree with me,
Especially in this heat!

&lt;chorus&gt;

I carry drinks along with me,
For thirst to overcome,
I don't like drinking from a ditch
Or from a pond with scum!

&lt;chorus&gt;

As I go out a'wandering,
Along the mountain track,
I take my maps and compasses,
To find which road leads back!

&lt;chorus&gt;
