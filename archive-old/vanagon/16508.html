OK, the Arlington place is out....

There is a place called Armands Chicago Pizzeria in Old
Town Alexandria that makes GREAT pizza. No parking, though, so it
would be impossible to get all the buss' together for a group
shot.

I also vote for another trip to Generous Georges, they have
better parking. (And good pasta pies!)

Again, it will prob be 7:00 before I can get there.
