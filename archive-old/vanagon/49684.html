Subject: Re: 87- Stop the fresh air!

Vic,

I too suffer this dilemna. I've tried the same solutions and recieved 
the same results. It drives my wife crazy, bothers me slightly with the 
former unbearable on long drives :) I would appreciate any private 
email to be forwarded to me. I'll do the same.

Take care,

tony

&gt;Hello again-
&gt;
&gt;Is it normal to always have fresh air flowing into the cabin in my 
&gt;1987 Vanagon?  I've read the owner's manual and tried everything from 
&gt;the control panel on the dash to stop/reduce the fresh air flow into 
&gt;the cabin.  I can heat it, direct it to the windshield, dash vents, or 
&gt;foot vents, but I can't stop it!  Any ideas?  It's going to be cold 
&gt;soon in Colorado...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks-
&gt;
