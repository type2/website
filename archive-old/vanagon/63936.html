Subject: Bus Boys Stole From me Saga...

Hello listees:

&gt;I'm not a violent man- but if Bus Boys was 
&gt;within driving distance......

With regard to the above comment I made in my post about
Bus Boys screwing me, I would hope that no one on either list 
that is over the age of 16 took this seriously.
I would like to think that most adults, especially Veedubbers'
would not resort to juvenile violence over $236.06.

hell- it would cost more than they stole from me to travel to calif.,
not too mention the legal repercussions.
Boy, that would make a whole helluva alot of sense...

If anyone thought I was serious, you can rest easy now, I'm
not a threat to anyone except myself...

still pissed but not threatening anyone....
Rob

ps. Still haven't gotten the parts I didn't order,
and they don't answer the phone....
There 800 number says it cannot be called from my area....
Anyone want to try it from a different area and see if they
just cut me off...  1.800.792.2697
