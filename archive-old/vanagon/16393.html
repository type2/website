Subject: '90 GL: Want to add curtains
Date: Wed, 26 Apr 1995 15:25:51 -0700 (PDT)


My fiance and I are planning on taking our '90 Vanagon GL 
camping on our honeymoon and would like to have a little
privacy. So I was wondering how hard it would be to add 
curtains like so many other vanagons have? We don't have
any snap attachments on the inside. Will we have to add 
snaps? Could we use the existing black mushroom shaped things?
Or how about using velcro? Any suggestions would be helpful.

Thanks,
-Eric
