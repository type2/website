Subject: Re: '97 Eurovan Camper

Well the EV camper started selling in December here in Washington state.
 Everyone else I know has waited longer for them.  I really kept up on the
EV's because I want to get a new passenger model (I have a '93 GL and want to
update).  If you have any questions let me know.  You can order a brochure at
