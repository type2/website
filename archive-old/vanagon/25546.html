Subject: 1800 T4 in a 80 Vanagon?

Gotta guy coming over this weekend who's cajoled me into helping stuff
a new 1800 longblock in his 80 Westie. Granted, it ain't a 2.0 liter, but
he couldn't afford the big brother, so's the 1800 will do.

Question. I've not had the pleasure of working on any dub buses much younger
than say 73 or 74 and was wondering what I may run into in the way of physical
stuff.

It is an automatic..bolt ups up the same to the tranny right?
Does it use a different rear motormount cradle?

Guy's gonna asperate it -vs- trying to rewire fried FI stuff and I'm thinking
he may _NOT_ have enough deck height with the weber progressive kit as I seem
to remember reading an article to this effect awhile back..?

Hints,tips, prat or pitfalls I need or should avoid... ALL advice greatly
absorbed..

Kevin
