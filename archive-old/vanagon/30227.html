So Ed Pyrik says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1990 Vanagon GL camper.  I am looking for a storage box to fit into
&gt; the rooftop depression at the front of the van.  The VW deal had a canvas type
&gt; bag which they wanted $250 which I didn't like.  Would like to know what is out
&gt; there, preferably in fiberglass.

Hi Ed,

Well, I use what can only be described as a large duffle or stuff bag that has
straps that can be tied to the metal tie-down thingies.  I got it at Price
Club and have been quite happy with it.  The thing I like about it is
that your not restricted to a specific shape and you can just jam things
in there fairly easily.  It works pretty well and is waterproof.  You can
probably find it in other stores in various sizes to fit your need.

Cheers!

Steven
