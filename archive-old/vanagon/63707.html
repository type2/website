Subject: Slave Cylinder?


     Just a polite clarification; not a nanny-nanny-boo-boo.
     
     On a hydraulic system, the &quot;slave&quot; cylinder is the one that's being 
     driven bu the hydraulic pressure, i.e., the ones in the wheels if 
     we're talking brakes, or the one on the transmission if we're talking 
     clutch.
     
     Please don't go anywhere and ask to have your slave cylinder checked 
     if your Dr. Marten's are getting doused with Dot 4, both the cylinders 
     buried in the dash are &quot;masters&quot;.
