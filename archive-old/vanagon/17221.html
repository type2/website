Subject: Old / new steering boxes

Steering boxes changed from worm-and-peg to worm-and-roller for the '73 model
year &lt;year of big changes: bumpers, turn signals, brake calipers, heat/vent
controls&gt;. IMHO, the later ones really are better - don't know about retro-
fitting though.

WHUZZAT?  I dug a steering box out of a '72 bus to use on my '71!!!
 Will a '72 go into the '71?  Hoboy.  What a revoltin' development.
 It was the '72 box  I was able to get the arm through the frame with.
 Now I wonder if the arm will go through on the '71?  I need to eyeball
 everything again.
