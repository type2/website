Subject: Who needs the front table leg for a Vanagon Westy?

A week or so ago, if my memory is correct, someone posted that they 
needed the swiveling leg for the front table of a Vanagon Westy.  
Unfortunately, I deleted the letter.  If you are out there, and 
still need one, please e-mail me.  I only have the leg, not the 
table. 
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
