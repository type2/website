Subject: Re: Vanagon recalls and VWoA

Yes VWoA does have a List of All Campaigns and/or Recalls by VIN#... whether
you are the original owner or the 10th....

it really depends on the Dealership tho... whether you get the service

I am currently talking to VWoA directly... 'bout Leaking Heads....

will probably have to go to Arbitration to get anything resolved...
