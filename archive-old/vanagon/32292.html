&gt; &gt; I was out driving an EV full of kids to their homes last night, a half
&gt; &gt; hour before they announced the vehicle ban on the roads. The road were
&gt; &gt; plowed earlier, but they had another foot of fresh snow on them, plus
&gt; &gt; the drifts.

&gt; &gt; The Continental tires on the EV (which Rick wrote about) were deflated
&gt; &gt; to around 20psi, and they have 38K miles on them.  The traffic was
&gt; &gt; non-existent, and roads had some tire tracks on them which I moade use
&gt; &gt; of. It was kind of fun (I had to keep reminding myself I had a bunch
&gt; &gt; kids in the van to refrain from having some real fun :-)  I was just
&gt; &gt; about the only driver without chains or snow tires on the road.  The
&gt; &gt; EV did exceptionally well and I was very proud of it (If the new tires
&gt; &gt; Rick got are so much better than the Contis, well, maybe I'll trythose
&gt; &gt; when it's time to change the Contis)..

Man, I've got nothing on you guys!  It got into the 80's around here (SoCal).
Not a  flake of snow to be seen!

My EV took to the dry pavement on the freeways pretty well, considering!
Actually, I run Michelins these days because the Continental tires that came
with the EV were LOUSY!  My car sat on dealer lots for the first couple of
years, though, so they were probably starting to rot in our Ozone-rich air.
Had to replace them at 19K miles.  Vehicle shook since new, mainly felt in
the steering wheel.  Multiple balancing acts did little good.  Rotating the
tires only made it sound like I was running snow tires on the front!  The
Mich's have been great, and are wearing great! Wish a little less road
noise came into the vehicle, but it's still oodles quieter than my 67 was.
Faster, too.  You know, that 5 speed's gear ratios would be absolutely
PERFECT if VW would add a 6th gear to bring the R's down to around 3000 at
75mph!
