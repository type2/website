Subject: Tunes for the Vanagon

I received the Crutchfield catalog (my fifth &quot;last copy unless I
purchase something&quot;) and I've been thinking about upgrading the
stereo.

Before I start, I'd like to know what other Vanagon owners have
done to improve their sound systems. I'm interested in speakers
and amps specifically but all information would be good to hear.

I'm leaning toward component speakers (ADS, Polk etc) in the front
doors with perhaps additional speakers in the rear section.

Thanks,
