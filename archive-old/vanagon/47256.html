Whoa, you don't wanna be using BarsLeak and retorquing your heads for a 
leaking coolant reservoir. I don't recall your original post, but maybe you 
should repost with complete info. BarsLeak works sometimes for head gasket 
leaks but that's the only application I've seen it recommended for. You 
don't want to just randomly throw this stuff in your cooling system. Same 
goes for retorquing the heads. The head bolts are sealed with a sealant to 
prevent coolant leaks. I think that to properly retorque a head, you'd have 
to drain the coolant, loosen and reprep the bolts/nuts with sealant, and 
then retorque to specs. Not a 30 minute effort if you know what I mean. And 
whatever you do, don't overtorque the heads to &quot;make sure they're tight.&quot;

If coolant is spewing from the coolant reservoir or overflow tank, you may 
have a crack in the plastic or a bad pressure cap. Exactly where is it 
leaking?
