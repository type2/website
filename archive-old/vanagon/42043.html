Subject: A/C too loud


I would greatly appreciate any advice or comments you may give:                 

I took my Westfalia into the Volkswagen dealership for an A/C check. The        
head mechanic had difficulty in finding any leak, so he put some dye in the     
refridgerant and checked again. He replaced a small hose connector and          
recharged the system. He then said that the compressor was running &quot;loud&quot; (ie.  
squeals more than it should and has some vibration), and should be replaced     
soon.                                                                           

Has anyone else had this problem (or ideas/comments)? Shouldn't the             
compressor make a bit of noise? Should I wait until the compressor fails?       

Also another question: my Westfalia has a Limited Edition plaque on each of     
the front doors. Was there a Wolfsburg Limited Edition Westfalia produced or    
was my vehicle an aftermarket conversion of a Vanagon Limited Edition?          

Thanks in advance,
