David:

re the tent

what you are describing sounds like a 68-79 Westy tent. They are a really
nice tent, but i don't htink i would recommend taking them backpacking.
They must weigh about 50lbs! I would say that $400.00 US is too steep for
the tent, especially on account of the rip etc. I would say a more
reasonable price is in the $300.00US range. FYI I purchased a MINT tent up
here in CANADA for $320.00 Canadain quite cheaply (roughly $200.00 US), so
i would say her price is kind of on the steep side esp. if it has a rip and
is missing pieces.

 &gt;I went to an auto swap meet here in San Diego on Saturday.  It is called
&gt;the &quot;Big Three&quot; swap meet and was free admission.  It was a nice day, so
&gt;what the hell, I decided to look around.  Despite the name, there were VW
&gt;parts all over the place.  I met one guy with a 59 Micro Deluxe ragtop with
&gt;safari windows - he was about half done restoring it.  Talked to him for
&gt;about an hour tryin to get him interested in the GNATT tour and tryin to get
&gt;him to sell me his 61 single cab that he says he has in his garage.  Anyway,
&gt;I walk around some more (like two more hours) and I am not even half way
&gt;through!  This thing was huge!  I found out it is a once-a-year event.  Oh,
&gt;I guess I'm rambling, huh?
&gt;
&gt;So a little while later I stop and talk to this woman with a 72 Camper.  I
&gt;stopped cause there was a tent attached to the camper with a for sale sign
&gt;on it.  The tent is yellow, with a dark blue top, and about 6 by 9 feet.
&gt;It has a screen door with a canvas cover that is striped.  The tent is held
&gt;up by aluminum poles, and attaches to the rain gutter of the bus.  It also
&gt;has extra canvas that attaches around the sliding door to make a good seal
&gt;against bugs.  The tent is in great shape except for a tear in the front
&gt;(repaired) that she said was done by a hungry raccoon.  The tent has no
&gt;identifying marks on it but was obviously made for a VW van.  She swears
&gt;it came from a 67 Westy.  So how much?  She says she wants $400 for it.
&gt;If it's really a 67 Westy tent, it sounds like a good price.  She is a
&gt;nice lady and who knows, she may sell it for less.  Says they got a bigger
&gt;camper now and don't need the tent anymore.  I asked if I could post her
&gt;phone number to this list and she didn't have a problem with it, so here it
&gt;is:
&gt;
&gt;(619) 445-0296
&gt;
&gt;I think this is her husband's work number.  Hope someone will be interested...
