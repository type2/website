Marc,
  Now you might not classify your 78 as a &quot;Classic&quot; but someday it will be.
If you cut a hole in the body to get to the sender, it will be cut up junker
someday. NEVER CUT A HOLE!!!! Wait until you have the motor out and then
fix the sender. Remember you have a responsibility to our children.
