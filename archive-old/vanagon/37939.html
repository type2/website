Subject: Re:FS 82 Westy diesel

Yes, I've seen Joerg's diesel, and it's beautiful.  The night we all got
together and looked at everyone's busses I didn't think about it much.  But
later that week I was thinking of the diesels and that they only were
available for a couple years in the early 80's and it hit me - an '82?????
It really does look nice.

Anyway, for any of you bunkerburner wannabees......
