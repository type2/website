Subject: Sealing Wax Red, L52, paint mixing codes

Hi all,

        I am currently restoring a 1962 Deluxe and I'm having trouble
matching the lower red colo(u)r (L53).  Dupont doesn't have this color
listed in the Centari acrylic enamyl.  However, the European mix number is
ICR206 for their version of Centari, but EC colours codes can't be
translated to North American Centari colors.  So..., if any of you have
mixed Sealing Wax Red in NA Centari, can you E-mail me your mixing code, (or
give me the phone number of anyone who has)?  

For those of you using other systems, I have managed to track down codes for
their paints.

The Dupont tech support person (restored 2 Issetta's and a Messershmidt) (_at_1
800 338 7668) said he would list an L53 color in the Centari if I could find
a color mix though vanagon_at_lenti or locally.  Any advice on this color
matching would be most welcome.
