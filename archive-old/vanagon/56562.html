Subject: re: Roof-racks for Westfalia

This brings up a question for me, I have seen many people pop their tops 
with gear on Yakimas and have done it myself (only with surfboards 
though).  Could this put excessive strain on the bars and hinges that 
hold the top up?  I've always resisted when the bikes were mounted.

&gt; &lt;I own a 1984 Westfalia. It has the fiberglass pop-up top. I would like&gt;
&gt; &lt;to carry a canoe on the roof. Problem: I can't find any clamp-on roof&gt;
&gt; &lt;racks for this model. Anybody know where this item is available? Any&gt;
&gt; &lt;other ideas about how to carry a canoe on the roof?&gt;
&gt; &lt;  All comments will be appreciated,&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I use a Yakima rack system (crossbars) to carry a 17ft Mad River canoe and
&gt; a Yakima Rocket Box (roof top carrier) on an '86 Westy. Mount the cross
&gt; bars well apart for maximum high speed stability.  The Yakima racks require
&gt; you to mount small brackets on the side of the fiberglass top. Make sure
&gt; you use some large washers under the mounting nuts.  I found it to be a
&gt; superior rack system - safe and convenient to use. I have carried a canoe
&gt; at 75+ MPH with no problems. Yakima racks are expensive but worth it in the
&gt; long run.
&gt; 
&gt; The cross bars for the canoe are spaced far apart and thus I had to add a
&gt; third cross bar when I got the Rocket Box. I use the rocket box to carry
&gt; paddles, wet life jackets, tents, etc- it holds alot. You can't lift the
&gt; Westy top with the canoe in place, but you can lift it with the Rocket Box
&gt; in place if you position it as far toward the rear as possible (eg.
&gt; overhanging the rear of the van).
