Well, in fact they began to replace their microfiche readers one year 
ago. At the moment maybe half of the dealers work with computers.

These computers contain all models of VW and Audi, not only Vanagons, 
including prices, part numbers ...

But I never asked them wether it is a hard disk or a CD-rom. I rather 
suspect that it is on hard disk. But I am not sure about it.
