Subject: Re: what and where ... again. :)

I am willing to place a bet that there are more Vanagonsin Canada than 
there are in all of California....and that's a a lot!

&gt; with the 71's firmly (?) in the lead over the 73's. but ho! check out
&gt; the 82/84/85 vanagons! sneaking up from behind ... who knows what may
&gt; happen by the end of the summer. :)
&gt; 
&gt; and, for those geographically-impaired members among us, here's where
&gt; we all are.  kinda lonely down here in west alabama. :( not even one
&gt; other buser in alabama or mississippi (well,he said snobbily, i sorta
&gt; didn't really expect any THERE ...) ;)  sigh.
&gt;

&gt; Total       132
&gt; 
&gt; the beach-bums of the golden surf are still waaaaaay out in front
&gt; (must be all that nice weather than makes 'em like buses ... or the
&gt; ability to move everything they own in case of a) earthquake,
&gt; b) mudslide, c) brushfire, d) mudslide putting out brushfire. all WE
&gt; ever get is bugs, floods, hurricanes,and tornados!).
&gt; 
&gt; but the lone-star texans are slowly gaining on 'em! and our neighbors
&gt; to the north (should i break you guys up into provinces?) are also
&gt; gaining ground.
&gt; 
&gt; well, time to go visit my local FLAPS (they feel neglected if i don't
&gt; come by once a week or so). :)  hope everybody has a good weekend.
