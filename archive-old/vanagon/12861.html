So Alice C. Gibb says:
&gt; 
&gt; We have been getting about 16 mpg on our '81 Westy for both town and city
&gt; driving.  This seems a little low to us.  How are your vans doing for
&gt; mileage?
&gt; 

I get 19.5 mpg all around.  I was dissapointed about getting the same 
mileage on a trip to Montery recently.  I expected 1 or 2 mpg better.
