Subject: Re: Homemade bras???

&gt;&gt; Has anyone ever made their own bra, with darts, etc., to account for 
&gt;&gt; curves and holes for headlights and turn signals???
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just Curious...


OK, I confess, I made my '71 Westy wear a see through bra once. Had just had 
it painted in mid-winter due to a garage fire, and didn't want the 'soft' 
paint to chip off.  I was driving 200-400 miles every weekend to ski races, 
on roads deep with sand/rocks/salt and the occassional 4' stick of pulp 
wood!  Here's how to do it.
        Remove headlight rings and turn signal lenses and fresh air vent 
grills. Wax the area just under the windshield, then firmly duct tape a wide 
enough piece of heavy gauge plastic film just under the windshield.  Down to 
below the bumper.  Put back on all the components you took off.  Cut around 
the headlights against the glass.  Voila, see-through plastic bra.  The 
loose sides can be wedged into the crack between the front and doors, leave 
about 8&quot; extra on each side and wad it in with a ruler.  It will stay.  Jam 
the lower part behind the bumper (for older vans, remember)
        Seals up the fresh air duct leaks too.  Yeah, looks wierd, makes 
some wicked loud crackling noise when it's really cold, but costs maybe 
$2.00, chuck it away in the spring.  Tim Smith, his $2 worth.
