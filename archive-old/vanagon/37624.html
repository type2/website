&gt; So where is Leo Carillo State Beach??

Okay, my apologies for not including a little bit more info on the 
location for my camping excursion. I just did one of those stupid male 
moments where I assumed everyone would just start driving with the idea 
of Leo Carillo in their heads and eventually end up there without having 
to ask for directions.
As I digress, Leo Carillo is on the P.C.H., that's Highway 1 folks! , 
just about 20 - 30 minutes south of Camarillo, which is just south of 
Ventura. Again, it's on the P.C.H. between Zuma beach and Camarillo.
Any q's? I'm a ready for you, and hopefully the campfire will be too...
