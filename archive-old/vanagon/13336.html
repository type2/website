&gt;2) The sliding door handle is wobbly; the entire lock and handle have been
&gt;taken apart, tightened greased and re-installed. Is there a bushing of
&gt;some sort that breaks down here and does it need to be replaced?

Locktite the screw that pulls the handle on, it's  inside the van, on the 
latch. Mine seems to loosen periodically, this helped greatly, but the 
handle still wobbles slightly. Low precision components.

&gt;
&gt;3) Does any one have any experience in installing &quot;anchors&quot; for rear (and

We put in an anchor high up in the rear corner, by removing the engine air 
grill then drilling through the tin. I bought a mounting kit, Canadian Tire, 
with LARGE backing washers 2&quot; dia. The strap looks a bit oddball, at a 45 
degree angle from the seat back to wall, but the rear deck is clear. Best 
site would be into the rear engine deck, near the hatch sill/latch. I can't 
remember why I didn't do this, since luggage space is not as important as 
the kid, although there are days... You need to resist 10G, ie upto 400 lbs. 
but the seat belt and strap are sharing the loads. tim s.
