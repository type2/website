Steve asks:
&gt; Speaking of automatics, what's the reliability and MPG penalty? Because
&gt; of my wifes shoulder injury I'm considering the automatic. Would hate
&gt; to loose any hard to come by power though!

Temporarily, I have an '85 with 1.9l and an at and an '87 4spd w/2.1l

I like an automatic.  If you have young kids around that need some 
attention while driving (replacing a pacifier etc) the auto is nice.  
great on hills and city traffic.  our dealer says he sees few at 
problems.  you don't have to worry about the parking brake cable 
rusting/freezing up on you as much.  its much easier to drink a pop 
with an auto.

Now.  they do sap power, pretty noticably. about a 2-3 mpg penalty on 
the highway, less it seems in city driving.  I like the power of the 
2.1 and 4spd.  the 4spd shifts easy (2 fingers on the knob).

given everything, I would vote for the 2.1l engine with a 4spd for
myself.  the vans just don't have that much power to spare. 
HOWEVER, since your wife has physical constraints, do not be afraid
of the auto.  in fact there will be aspects of it you thoroughly
enjoy

i can't speak for anything but the wasserboxer autos.
