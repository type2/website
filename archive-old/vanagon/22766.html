Subject: Lyrics: ODE TO BILLY JOE


It was the third of June, another sleepy dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton while my brother was balin' hay
And at dinnertime I stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door &quot;You remember to wipe your feet&quot;
And she said &quot;I got some news this morning from Choctaw Ridge&quot;
&quot;Today Billy Joe McAlister's jumped off the Tallahachie Bridge&quot;
Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
&quot;That Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits please&quot;
&quot;There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow&quot;
And Mama said it was a shame about Billy Joe anyhow
Seems like nothing ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe McAlister's jumped off the Tallahachie Bridge
My brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billy Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carrol County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night
&quot;I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right&quot;
&quot;I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge&quot;
&quot;And now you tell me Billy Joe has jumped off the Tallahachie Bridge&quot;
Now Mama said to me &quot;Child what's happened to your appetite?&quot;
&quot;I been cooking all morning and you haven't touched a single bite&quot;
&quot;That nice young preacher Brother Davey dropped by today&quot;
&quot;Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, but oh by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwin' something off the Tallahachie Bridge&quot;
A year's come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
Bobby Merry and Becky Thompson bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus gon' round, Papa caught it and he died last spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
Now me I spend a lot of time picking flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop 'em into the muddy water off the Tallahachie Bridge
