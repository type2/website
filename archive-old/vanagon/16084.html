Subject: Re: GL to Westy Conversion

Country Homes in San Jose does this conversion for last I heard about
$3.6K, and you don't have to provide your own top.  They do a number
of other things optionally, which gives the van the same amenities
basically as the Westfalia conversion.

    '81 westy (puke-eggnog).  And no, it doesn't have a shower, toilet, hot
         water, laundry, or  dishwasher, but I'M WORKING ON IT, OK!?
    '80 bug convertible (stock triple-white)
    '73 or '74 Thing/Safare/Trekker/181 &quot;wannabe.&quot;  If you hear of one in
         in need of a good home/restoration, etc., let me know!
