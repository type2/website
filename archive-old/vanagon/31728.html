&gt;Wow, Tom's got a Vanagon *and* a Cub? Dammm, now I'm jealous...


..and I'm jealous of the famous listmember with the splitties
*and* a biplane!

Meanwhile, my wife and I are evaluating the various private internet 
providers, and hope to have a new, real, working e-mail address shortly. 
Sorry for the inconvience and inadequacies of my current provider.


Tom F.
