&gt; Hi Everyone.  I taped Christa Ovenell's  interview with the CBC Radio 
&gt; that aired yesterday morning.  This is the interview about all the VW 
&gt; vans going to Inuvik this summer.  It was a pretty good plug for 
&gt; travelling in VW's, and the &quot;community&quot; one belongs to while owning 
&gt; these vehicles.  It is about 15 minutes long.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I have no means to digitize this thing.  I was wondering if 
&gt; someone out there has that capability, and if so, would like to 
&gt; digitize and maybe Gerry can make it available in the Archives.  I'm 
&gt; not even sure how big an audio file of 15 minutes would even be.  Are 
&gt; there any &quot;digital&quot; experts out there on the list that can offer a 
&gt; brief feasability of this?  Could someone who subscribes to the type2 
&gt; list pass this note onto them as well??  
&gt; 
&gt; I guess if people wanted their own &quot;taped&quot; version, they could send 
&gt; me a tape, etc.  Ideas anyone?

I have the means to digitize this, and could store it in WAV or 
Realaudio format. Wav files can be compressed, but realaudio would be 
more efficient for downloads. Let me know if you need help with this.
