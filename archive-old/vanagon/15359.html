&gt;     My red GEN light came on and now stays on all the time. She runs
&gt; normally, but the light beckons......is it true I will have to remove the
&gt; entire engine if the gen. is kapoot??(('71 Camper) My volt. reg. is behind my
&gt; air cleaner for some reason....Any suggestions would be helpful : D

It's probably easier to drop the engine to change the generator, 
but I've done it with the engine in....and if you don't  have
the setup to drop the engine, it's an option. I think it's in 
Muir, but basically what you do is undo the bolts under the manifolds
holding the shroud and block up the shroud a coulple of inches
to get the fan over the generator stand. Helps to have small
hands.....

Do the Muir thing with the wires and brushes and popsicle stick
first though....
