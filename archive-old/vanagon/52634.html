Subject: Re: Freeze plug leaking coolant, Leaking head gasket-diesel

A response regarding leaking freeze plugs caught my attention and I am
wondering about other peoples experiences with diesel head gasket leaks.

&gt;In that time I
&gt;replaced the head gasket twice. First time at 2 years. Second time about
&gt;three months ago. So I don't think age of coolant has anything to do with..

My '83 camper has about 90k miles since factory &quot;CS&quot; longblock installed. 
I have added additional stress by adding  85' qntm turbodiesel intake and
exhaust, however boost is kept at 8 psi,and EGT below 1150 F.

Engine is running well now, headbolts were retorqued about 30k miles ago,
coolant replaced _at_ 2 yr interval with vw brand.         
I am wondering if I should replace the head gasket with a &quot;turbo&quot; head gasket
to avoid a possible breakdown far from home.
 
Any experiences with adding a turbo to a non-turbo car?

Much warning before the head gasket goes? 

Thanks for any info.
