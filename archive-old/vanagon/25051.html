So rev it up, this happens to me, but in winter since it is the heater core 
that chills out first due to lack of circulation. Revving it returns heat 
fast. Checking out the fan is painless, remove the grill, pull the plug off 
the thermostat and jumper across with some thick wire. One terminal is 
'common' other two are high/low sides. You can't blow anything by 
misconnecting. This checks the entire circuit and eliminates the switch. If 
the fans won't cut in, drop the spare, then run a thick wire from battery + 
to socket on the motor and try to get it going, watch for sparks kids, and 
that fan is LOUD when it's in your face. If the motors dead.... $$$$ or 
WD-40. Considering the salt encrusted winters we get here, and the fact that 
my '85 sat for months at a time and the motor always worked fine I'd _guess_ 
the motors are indestructible. Check that power is getting to the relay, 
this was an awkward reach on my '87. If there is power then the relay or 
ballasts are fritzed, although I think the hi setting goes straight through, 
no ballast resistor. If no current, then check for current at the fuse. If 
current there but no relay power the big red-wire connector in the back of 
the fuse panel may have slipped out/crudded up. Have fun taking the fuse 
panel off to reach the connector. Went through all this a while back on the 
'87, never should have sold the '85, never.   tim s.
