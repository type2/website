&gt;Would someone please send me the address for the Vintage VW list. I'm tried
&gt;to subscribe to  listserv_at_jsuvm.sju_dot_edu    but it keeps coming back.
&gt;Thanks.

I'm not on that list anymore, but the address I have is:

LISTSERV_at_SJSUVM1.SJSU.EDU

I think you send a message with no subject and a body consisting of the
single line:

SUBSCRIBE VINTAGVW YourFirstName YourLastName
