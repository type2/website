Subject: Re: Making Sense of Joel's Stats?

&gt;:) i've finally decided that there isn't enough data to determine anything.

  This is probably true, but why let the data get in the way of a good theory?

&gt;you have to remember that in order to show up in the stats, the bus must be
&gt;owned by someone who (1) has internet access of some sort, and (2) has found
&gt;out about the list, and (3) has signed up to the list.  now there are lots of
&gt;folks who have buses. but fewer of them meet (1). and even fewer have met (3)
&gt;.. cause some folks get on the list, then decide it's too much whatever and
&gt;get off.

  Certainly it is true that the people on the list are not a random sample
of bus owners, but this doesn't necessarily invalidate the data.  What we
would need to test is whether bus owners with (1), (2) and (3) differ
significantly in bus preferences/bus treatment etc. from bus owners without
(1), (2) and (3).  OK Joel, got any stats on bus popularity in the general
public?  :) Maybe we should poll the people who play those VW spotting
games on long road trips for some more bad data.  Didn't Martha mention
doing this a while back?

&gt;so i just gave up trying to figure why so few 88's or 79's. i couldn't come
&gt;up with any valid reason. and why so many 87's??? i can understand the 71's
&gt;.. cause that is a Preferred Year for the bread-loafs (beetle engine but
&gt;disk brakes). but the rest is just pure speculation of the worst academic
&gt;kind. ;)

  Hey, I resemble that statement!  Seriously, though I think Sami made a
good point that &quot;birth&quot; and &quot;death&quot; rates are an important factor.  It
seems clear that enthusiasts will ensure that the left end of the curve
will have an extended tail, but you can't fight nature or rust forever.
And like modern hospital births with all their new-fangled machines that go
ping, new vans (I define as 87+) are damned expensive and that could
explain the tailoff at the right.
