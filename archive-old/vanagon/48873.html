&gt;Ron-
&gt;What kind of speakers did use to replace the old ones, were they 
&gt;the same diameter? I haven't seen any small speakers that offered 
&gt;a decent bass.

I used 4&quot; Orion two-way speakers, since they are one of the few 4&quot; 
speakers that have good dome tweeters.  No, they do not have much 
bass.  Also, they are quite inefficient, meaning that they require 
an outboard amp to really do their stuff.  They sound great from 
about 100 Hz up.  My plan is to put a subwoofer under the sofabed 
to augment them.
