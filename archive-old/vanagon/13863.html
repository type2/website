Subject: Re: alcohol burner question

Thanks Derek for your great info.  The kind of burner I was
talking about was actually the one made for heat; I forgot
to distinguish that from the one for cooking, but I guess
either would work.  But, I'm told that just like propane,
the alcohol system can also be a health threat for the same
two reasons the propane one is:  1.  you can use up your
oxygen if you don't crack the door or window enough, and 
2.  a byproduct of the combustion, if you don't have enough
oxygen is CO (= you die).  

However, it would certainly be nice to be able to drive
with some additional heat, particularly in an air-cooled
car.  Al Knoll just told me about seeing a guy with 
a Scandinavian Jotul woodstove installed in his car,
vented thru the roof.  Obviously, this would not be safe
for driving, but might be REALLY nice for heating.  West
Marine in fact carries in their catalog a sold wood fuel
stove for heating, but it has to be mounted on a 
vertical surface, and I don't have any free vertical
spaces in my '81 westy.  If I could yank off the sliding
door, and put in the ones that open like cupboard doors
or shutters, that would probably work!  :)
