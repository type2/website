Oettinger Microbus
CAR, June 1984

The big story is a 30 per cent increase in both power and torque.
But the nicest feature is the way it's delivered ...

If we leave aside turbos - now the &quot;in&quot; way of increasing the muscle
power of an engine - the traditional performance conversion involves
pushing the power band up the rev scale, to obtain more top-end zing
at the expense of low speed pulling power. The closer to competition
specs you take the motor, the narrower its power band and the rougher
its character. But, of course, there is another kind of conversion in
which the motor's breathing capacity is stepped up, in conjunction
with its torque, so that its potency is upgraded without distorting
its output curves.

FREEING LATENT POWER
If this type of exercise is carried out skilfully, in conjunction with
a judicious increase in capacity, the power and torque latent in the
basic design are freed to do a bigger job and the fuel consumption
penalty can be minimal - perhaps only applicable when the extra
performance is actually used to do more work than would be possible
with the standard engine.

Such a conversion is offered in the Oettinger Microbus now available
from Lindsay Saker - developed to meet the demands for livelier
performance experienced mainly on the Highveld, where the power loss
associated with altitude makes the standard vehicle significantly more
sluggish than it is at the coast.  Priced at plus/minus R18400,
depending on the equipment specified, the Oettinger Microbus conversion
was developed by Oettinger in Germany using their own specialist
components and provides a striking example of what can be achieved,
at a price.

For R19575, for example, you get alloy wheels, a tow bar and a custom
paint job. Our test vehicle had been equipped with two sunroofs:
a (larger) vinyl covered unit located amidships and a smaller,
electrically operated unit in the front section of the vehicle. The
smaller one was made of plexiglass with a trimmed inner panel and its
control button was placed on the dashboard, to the right of the steering
column.

The test vehicle was also fitted with a Sanyo hi-fi and an ultra-sonic
anti-theft system incorporating a remote control unit that we found more
irritating than useful.  It embodied three significant improvements
recently introduced by VWSA - a chrome luggage retainer frame similar
to the unit used in some earlier Microbuses, a new grill with twin
halogen headlights and the latest upgraded paintwork, which featured
dark brown in conjunction with cream, highlighted by gold striping.

The big story is the Oettinger engine conversion, which lifts engine
power by an impressive 29,8 per cent from 57 kW at 4600 to 74 kW at
4800 - only 200 revs higher - while boosting torque by 29 per cent
from 141 N.m at 2800 r/min to 182 N.m at 2500 - even lower down the
rev scale.

In short, the Oettinger Microbus boasts a power to mass factor of 51,67
W/kg, compared to the standard vehicle's figure of 39,8. But while the
performance figures are impressive, they tell only half the story.  The
really nice thing about the bus is the smooth and balanced manner in
which the extra power is delivered - it is every bit as docile and
tractable as the standard vehicle.

TRACTABILITY TARGET
This was the objective of the tuning exercise, which increased the
capacity of VW's boxer four from 1915 cc to 2120 cc by increasing the
stroke from 68,9 to 76,4 mm, while keeping the bore the same.

Oettinger first made their name as crankshaft specialists and their
Microbus uses a special crank, hand machined from a single billet of
chrome-moly steel and incorporating fully webbed counterbalances.
Special pistons (incorporating similar Heron combustion chambers to
those in the standard engine) lift compression from 8,6 to 9,8:1, and
while valve timing is unchanged, breathing capacity is increased by
employing a high lift cam.

The standard Pierburg twin-choke carburettor is retained, with suitable
jettings, and the lubrication system is given an oil cooler,
thermostatically controlled to &quot;cut in&quot; at 89 degrees C.

Brakes, driveshafts, gearbox and clutch require no changes and the
vehicle's good ride and deft handling characteristics remain the same.

STARTLING IMPROVEMENTS
When we tested the water-cooled 1,9-litre Microbus in our August 1983
issue, the performance improvement recorded over its predessor - powered
by a 2,0-litre air-cooled engine - was quite dramatic. The improvements
now notched up by the 2,1-litre Oettinger vehicle are quite startling,
as shown in the following table:
                                    1,9-litre      2,1-litre
Acceleration (secs):                Microbus       Oettinger Microbus
  0-100 km/h .......................  22,8         15,34
  1 km sprint ......................  41,0         36,95
  Terminal speed (km/h) ............ 115,8         136,8
  Top speed (km/h) ................. 131           153
Fuel Consumption (litres/100km):
  60 km/h ..........................  7,57          8,14
  80 km/h ..........................  8,77          9,07
  100 km/h ......................... 10,90         10,66

TEST SUMMARY
So the Oettinger vehicle is much livelier on the road, while consuming
much the same amount of fuel, although when it is driven hard and the
additional kilowatts are being really used, its thirst can be expected
to rise fairly steeply.

Driven fairly hard in mainly suburban usage, the bus recorded 13,4
litres/100km overall. But with a switch to about 50 per cent out-of-town
driving, the consumption fell to 12 litres/100km and this would indicate
a cruising range of well over 700 km.

For the man requiring a really deluxe minibus with luxury equipment,
an impeccable finish and build quality and ample performance, it would
be hard to beat.

Its biggest single attraction is that it retains the balance and
tractability of the original vehicle, while delivering 30 per cent more
power and torque and involving no additional complexity from the
maintenance viewpoint.

Comparable results - possibly even slightly superior - might have been
obtained by developing multi-valve cylinder heads, a technique enjoying
increasing popularity in both Europe and Japan and with which Oettinger
has plenty of experience. This idea was apparently considered for the
Oettinger two-litre Golf GTi, then dropped because of the servicing
complexity it would have introduced.

&quot;Keep it simple&quot; was the preferred route - with everything within the
scope of the ordinary VW mechanic, or capable DIY man.  The results
confirm the wisdom of this decision.
