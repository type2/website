Subject: Re: change list to newsgroup?


I don't like the idea of changing to newsgroup. I'm travelling around
and forward my mails to the present location I will be. But not
everywhere I will have access to a newsgroup server or open internet
access. I like to have a maintained mailing list service, even when
I get more mails than the whole company.
