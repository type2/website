transmission from a '73 fit into a '77 without &quot;much&quot; 
 modification?

no problem....  just keep the starter from the 77- stronger to turn over the
2 litre motor

2.  Will your run of the mill spray paint work to paint the engine tin or
 is high temp paint needed?    

engine tin  doesnt get very hot, so go ahead with the run of the mill stuff.
but do paint it BLACK for maximum heat release.  VW didnt choose the color
because they were in mourning.

3.  What oil is recommended for my '77 westy?  I live in western NY.

use Castrol.  hey- they sent me a cataolg of cheesy overpriced clothes
emblazoned with their logos.    i keep sending in on the rebate offers
