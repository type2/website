&gt;
&gt; Still on the track of replacing salt corroded cooling pipes.
&gt; Thanks to Lloyd I was referred to Tim Smith at UNB_dot_ca who wrote extensively
&gt; on how to replace these with rubber. I have trekked with blood-shot eyes
&gt; through recent archives and have not found the article.
&gt; Anyone out there save it or know which archive it's in?
&gt; How do I access previously posted indiv. articles?
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks

I think mine are OK for now, but is there any reason they
could not be replaced with rigid copper tubing with
soldered joints?  I once made a fitting like this to
install a mechanical temp gauge on a Rabbit and it
seemed to hold up OK.  You could put foam insulation
on the heater lines and leave the cooling pipes bare
or painted flat black.
