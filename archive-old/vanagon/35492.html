&gt;please repost that part number.

Check carefully.  The bootm disc is different on the Audi Stats. Otherwise it
does fit.  I do not know the effects.  I really see no reason to use a lower
temp stat if all is well.  I do believe in changing the fan switch to one
that turns the fan on at a lower temp.  This is for those traffic situations.
 Only thing that needs improved cooling is the oil.
