Subject: fridge problem ?
Date: Mon, 27 Jun 1994 06:31:26 -0400 (EDT)

My Dometic fridge in my '87 Vanagon camper has not worked properly since
I've had the thing and I have done all I can to find out what is wrong and
have come up with no solution.  So.... I'm hoping there is a bit of wisdom
somewhere in Net-Land to help.  The problem:  The fridge is hard to start
on gas.  Hell, sometimes like yesterday I could not start it at all.  The
flame will not ignite.  After it does lite though the fridge works fine
and will run until I shut it off.  Now, I've taken the fridge out of the
camper and opened up the burner and it seem to work fine when I try it. 
The Piezo starter sparks every time and I've tried it for minutes on end,
sparks every time, no fail.  The gas lites every time also, hold in the
gas valve, push the Piezo and poof, it lites up.  Put the fridge back in
it's place and poof it does not lite, well sometimes,  sometimes it will
and the sometimes it won't.  I'm about ready to cut a hole in the van wall
to see what the hell is happening back there when the fridge is installed
that makes it so difficult to lite up.  There is also one other detail
that I have not been able to figure out, the LED lite on the cabinet that
is supposed to lite up when the gas is lite in the frige burnner, has
never worked.  I have not spent much time investigating this as the top of
the cabinet must be removed to trace the wireing and I was not corageous
enough to do this.  Any ideas here ?  Is this part of the same problem ?
Hoping for some good news.

Cheers,

Frank
