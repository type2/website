Subject:      Dometic lighting advice

Regarding the lighting of fridges at high altitude, here's what I've done
(live in Fort Collins, CO, ~5280', with regular trips much higher), on our
81 Westy.  Those of you with significantly different systems may not be
able to use this advice.

Turn the toggle to gas, turn gas ON and set the thermostat at it's lowest
setting.  I believe this to be in the pilot light range as there is a
detent when you come off this lowest setting which I believe to be the
main burner enable switch.

With the thermostat at it's lowest setting, go through the normal routine
to light the fridge (10 pumps, hold in safety relay, fire ignitor,
repeat).  Leave the fridge on, but at it's lowest setting for 20-30
minutes, at which point you can move the thermostat to a colder setting.

This fridge has always been hard to start, since purchased from the PO.  I
was planning on pulling the fridge to check the burner, etc, when I
stumbled across this technique, which so far has worked as high as 8500'
feet.  YMMV, of course, but if it works for you, let the list know.

Jack
