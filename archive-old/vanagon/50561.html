Subject: Wasserboxer Coolant Pipes NLA

Wasserboxers:

A word of warning to owners of Vanagons with (at least) the 1.9
engine (83.5 to whenever the 2.0 started).  I have been trying
since August 1 to get the coolant pipe which bolts to the top of
the engine, returning coolant from the heater cores to the
expansion tank (part# 025.121.081F).  It's about 18 inches long,
with a bend in either end, two brackets to bolt it down and a
nipple which leads to the bleeding valve.  Not sure if it's the
same part for the 2.0.

It has been listed as B/O (back order) since August and today the
rest of my parts order arrived with NLA (no longer available)
printed by this part.  Evidently VW does not consider a coolant
part crucial enough to keep in inventory.

I'll probably get mine brazed (to fix the leak) and keep on
going, but this situation sure says something about the VW stand
on helping the hobby--no matter how many PR meetings with
&quot;hobbyists&quot; they hold to convince us they support our efforts.
