&gt; &gt;How much will this sunuvagun end up costing me to get fixed?  I trust 
&gt; &gt;it is major work. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can replace them yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; You can:
&gt; 
&gt; A) take the heads off and put new tubes in.
&gt; B) take out pushrods and put in two-piece tubes (and then put pushrods back in
&gt; 
&gt; I did &quot;B&quot; on my 911 (alas sans pushrods its a DOHC engine with excellent 
&gt; results and saved me a pile of $$$$

Thanks for the info Thom!

I got ahold of one of the adjustable pushrod tubes (even if it is a 
funky anodized blue color), and plan to put it in this afternoon. 

Any tips on it?  Taking out the lifter assembly is not going to screw 
up the valve settings is it?

Thanks!
