Subject: Timing with a 009 Distributor..?

Martin Sage writes:

&gt;You should find a screw on top holding down the points...
&gt;I use a strobe light to time my '71 5degrees ATDC vaccum on
&gt;Do you have a degree mark pulley or just on with a notch for TDC?
&gt;The degree pulley is easier to read ...if you have only the notch
&gt;then you need to locate where 5degrees is.  If you need that info
&gt;let me know and I'll send it to you.

Martin:

Thanks for getting back to me! I am just about to go out and adjust the
valves and I will have to time the engine soon...

I don't have a degree pulley. I've seen them advertised--are they easy to
install without taking everything apart, or do I have to wait until I take
the engine out...?

At this point I only have the notch and have no idea where to locate 5
degrees...I could guess, but that would be cheating... also, I found out
today that I have a Bosh009 distributor...does this make a diff?

Any comments and help would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
