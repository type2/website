&gt;Aren't those original speakers a great way to insult sound?

My installer got quite excited about the idea of installing 6&quot; cones at the
base of each front door, where there is currently bare metal.  He feels
that these would be the equivalent of subwoofers.  He also wants to add
kick-panel speakers.  He tells me the combination would be fantastic.

I don't have the money right now, so the project is on hold.
