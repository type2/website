Subject: kombi on fire

Hello all

On TV last night, one of the news programmes had brief footage of what 
appeared to be an 1800/2 litre kombi completely ablaze with rear tyres 
exploding. The report stated that while travelling along a Sydney 
freeway the driver noticed smoke coming from the rear of the van and 
was able to pull over and get out before the fire took hold. 
Spectacular viewing (that's why it made the news) but pretty disturbing 
to a kombi owner.

It was obvious that it had been an engine fire and I'd say it occured
the same way a lot of other kombi engine fires have - perished and 
cracked fuel lines leaking petrol onto a hot engine (I assume the 
exhaust manifolds would actually ignite the fuel). 

I think I'll check over the fuel lines in my kombi this weekend.
