&gt; 
&gt; Hi guys!
&gt; 	This may very well be my second post in three months. I just 
&gt; bought a '76 camper w/pop-top.  It's my first car and was bought with a 
&gt; cross country trip in mind.  But since this is all a little new to me I 
&gt; hope you'll bear with the parade naive questions I'm about to ask:
&gt; 	Is there anyway to get air-conditioning installed in this new 
&gt; addition to the family? What are the pros/cons of air-conditioning 
&gt; if it's possible?  About how much would the process cost? Where would I go 
&gt; to look into this?  Could anyone please offer their wisdom at my address:
&gt; tarabah_at_minerva.cis.yale_dot_edu ? (I only get the digest and it will 
&gt; probably be a while before the next installment.)
&gt; 	Thanks so much!
&gt; 	Good Weather to You All,
&gt; 		Tara

There is probably a garage or business that specializes in aftermarket
A/C in your area.  I would look in the phone book for them in your area,
call them and see what they had to say.  I'd try to get several estimates
before I made a decision as to which one to go with.  Personally, I'd
visit the garages I was shopping so I could get a look at the various
systems they were offering.  Note, this is a fairly expensive venture.
Especially now with the advent of CFC free systems.  

Cheers!

Steven
