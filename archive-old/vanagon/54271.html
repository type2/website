Subject: Re: Redline:CV-2 High temp. CV grease

&gt;| Anyway, having just used non-German CV grease for the first time, I'm 
&gt;| wondering if I may just end up with a reduced life span also? Or 
&gt;| could something else contribute to a failed CV as above in 40-50k 
&gt;| miles?

	I too am preparing to stick non VW issued grease into my CVs. I have
chosen a few tubes of Vavoline Premium Grease (I guess this used to be called
special moly grease but has been repackage because the part number is the
same). On the back is the make up of the grease, and its percent lithium soap
content (I think, this is all out of my memory from looking over the tube
in the shop three weeks ago). Does anyone know the base of the VW stuff? I
have seen the 1 billion posts about any MoS2 grease is great, but never have
I seen any comparision of the make up of these greases... Anyone know where I
might find the make up of the greases, compile a little list and stick it
somewhere for all to see?
