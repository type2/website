You could just do what I used to do.  Just carry a tank of gas on you
luggage rack, and when you run out you still have enough to get to the
nearest gas station.  I had to do this for a while.

And my gauge worked.  :)

&gt;      List members -
&gt;
&gt;      My trusty Westy Syncro developed one of its first problems.
&gt; After
&gt;      filling up with gas in Hayward, Wisconsin (slow fill) on Sunday
&gt; and
&gt;      driving for 100 miles back home the fuel gauge stayed at full.
&gt; When I
&gt;      turn the Westy off the gauge does drop to Empty.  After
&gt; restarting,
&gt;      the gauge goes to full.  I know that my Westy Syncro has been a
&gt;      constant 20 m.p.g. vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;      I haven't had the time (have to work on Monday) to check it out.
&gt; Has
&gt;      any one had this problem?  I'm going home after work Monday to
&gt; look
&gt;      this over, any words of wisdom would be appreciated.
