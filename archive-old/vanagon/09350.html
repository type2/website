Subject: Not another heater fan!!!...



Hopefully someone out there can help me with this one.  Each year
my '83 vanagon's (water cooled) front heater fan burns out.  First,
it makes a lot of noise and runs intermittently for awhile.  At $155
for parts plus $44-88 labor this has gone on long enough.  I've
replaced it around 5 or six times and everyone tells me that the fans
(VW) are no good!  Recent information has come my way that there may
be a wiring problem with the van or a resister problem.  Any comments 
would be greatly appreciated.

Steve
