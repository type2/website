&gt; a velcro kind of attachment? Any help would be appreciated.

I had the same problem with mine and after looking at the job, finally 
wnt to an upholstery shop that I had done some business with before. He 
said that in order to fix the screen, he would have to take the canvas 
part of the top off completely, repair the screen and zipper and then 
re-instal it. 
I wasn't ABOUT to try that myself - so I went to REI and got some good 
&quot;no-see-um&quot; screen material and he installed it and had it back up and 
fixed in a day. About $100 - well worth it I think. 
Good luck - Jack
