Subject: Bentley costs in Australia

David, I will be leaving from CA to visit family in Australia in 3 weeks.
I will also be visiting your University!  (Architecture Department) I will
be there about June 20, 1996.  If you can specify exactly which Bentley you
want I will purchase it and bring it over if you wish.  Let me know if the
timing would work?

Wanted to post this to the list as an example of the great contacts that
can be made!!!!!  Don.
