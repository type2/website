&gt;The up side of this is that the cops figure that the VW camper
&gt;can't go that fast.  In the 16 years I've been driving my bus
&gt;I've never had a speeding ticket. &lt;knock on wood&gt;
&gt;
&gt;YMMV,                                   ;-)

Well I haven't gotten a ticket, but I got a warning for speeding last
summer. Before 8AM in a small town off the beaten path in New Mexico, from
a black sheriff who claimed to have lived in Montreal for years and to have
dual citizenship (which is probably true).

Somehow it all seemed like a takeoff on a Mel Brooks movie...
