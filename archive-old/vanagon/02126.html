Hello VWers,
        My wife (Gabriella) and I are planning a long trip around America
as soon as I get this little thesis...thing... out of the way. If the
Bricks Across America (BOA) flies, then we would love to join up. I'm an
entomologist who has been stuck in a lab for 5 years, so I'm looking
forward to collecting insects en route. Gabriella works for Peet's coffee
and has her own truffel business on the side. Coffee, chocolate, insects,
and buses. Heaven.

                                -Eric

P.S. I saw 11 VW buses on the way in to lab this morning. Berkeley must be
the belly-button of the VW world.
