Subject: purchase advice - 1980 Westfalia


Greetings all,

I am new to this list as a result of finding a 1980 Westy? pop top camper.
I have checked out vanagon_dot_com but was wondering what to look for when 
buying one of these.  I plan on having a vw mechanic look at it but would like some &quot;up front&quot; 
itmes to look for.  it has 58k orig. miles, new paint, tires, exhaust.
can i use this as a daily driver?  I would think this question has been
asked before so please email direct w/ response or point to a 
Buyers Guide in the web?

thanks
eric

ps - i plan on doing most work myself, one of my other cars is a 1980 Fiat
Spider.  I have heard Vanagons are very expensive to repair and
need engine overhaul around 100k miles.
