TFORHAN_at_hr.house_dot_gov In a message dated 96-03-14 12:09:04 EST, you write:

&gt; So what if you need to take the Audi 5000
&gt;     headliner out with a knife and a heat gun, and why would you do that
&gt;     anyway? All the electrics are already accessible? 

One would remove the headliner shell for the express purpose of replacing the
headlining material when it inevitably peels from its' hard shell and droops
into one's line of vision.  This not only annoys by constantly dragging
accross one's head, but pollutes the interior with tar-like caked foam that
falls out from in between the layers.  If this &quot;tar&quot; makes contact with one's
clothing, upholstery, or (God forbid) hair, one might as well write off the
material as lost.  This stuff won't come out (once smeared as if to wipe
off).

I also think that the Audi 5000 to which this thread was referring was (and
correct me if I'm wrong, listmembers) the late '83 through late'88 5000.  Not
the Audi 100.  I, personally, have never had bad luck (recurring problems)
with the Audi 100 (late model 100's)
