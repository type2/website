Subject: VW engine replacements ending?

You know, I saw something the new VW Warranty book about their &quot;Internal
Engine Component Claims' program ending in May 1996.  This is one of those
BBB Auto Line arbitration programs. Now I don't *know* for sure whether
this applies to all you waterboxer owners hoping to get a free rebuild from
VW, but you might want to call the number and check it out.
it's 1-800-822-8987.
