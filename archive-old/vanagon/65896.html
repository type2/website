Subject:      Re: interior rear heat

I had a heater below the floor, just in front of the right rear wheel.
It rusted away within five years. Hard work to close the hole, but
I replaced the heater with a 50 Liter water tank. More usefull
than *THIS* heater. I still keep the Propex stile aux. heater in
the left side panel, I enjoy to use it.

look at a van w/ a BA6 gas heater, and you'll see what to do..
