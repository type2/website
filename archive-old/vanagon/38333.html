Subject: 81 Westy interior electrics Part II

Well I am reassured that there are no hidden fuses nor mystery switches. I
got very diligent with my multi-meter and continuity tester and find
everything to be in order.

The exception to this is the L.E.D. light panel. It appears not to be
&quot;passing&quot; power hence the dead circuitry downstream to the water pump
although all the lights function. The circuit board is made up of what I
recognize from my Heathkit days as resistors, chips, L.E.D.s and something
about the size of a quarter that along with a bunch of numbers says
&quot;ampower&quot;. 

Questions for you folks comfortable with small electric things (the Heathkit
never worked): Does this make sense? What might the culprit be and is it
repairable? If so by whom? Finally, if it's 12 volts in and out of the board,
is there a reason why I couldn't run a jumper between the two to bypass
whatever is defective on the board?

Thanks for any help, I'm really out of my element here.

Weston
