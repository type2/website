Subject: 83 vanagon wobbles (fwd)


I thought about my problem a bit more.  Let me explain.  When going at 
slow speeds or in reverse (really noticable) the steering wheel goes back 
and forth about 3/8 of an inch.  I was thinking of something more 
expensive?!!!  What if my tires are good?  Thanks
