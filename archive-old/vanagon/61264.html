Subject: What FI pressure gauge to buy?


 Well, I've decided I need to add a fuel pressure gauge to my kit of
 tools for FI diagnosis of my '81 Vanagon.  Went to 3 local FLAPS and
 2 of them didn't have pressure gauges suitable for the pressures
 found in FI systems.  The one gauge I did find was pretty pricey and
 was designed for Fords, Chevey's and Jeeps with a tire valve in the
 fuel rail.  So, 3 questions:

         1) Is there a suitable adaptor available so I can use the
            Ford/Chevy/Jeep FI pressure gauge?

         2) If the answer to 1) is &quot;No&quot;, any recommendations for an
            inexpensive gauge suitable for use on my van?

         3) Can anyone recommend a merchant ('net or otherwise) that
            has fuel pressure gauges at a reasonable price?
