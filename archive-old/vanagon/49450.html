Subject: RE: Syncro driveshaft removal/Vibration

I only caught the last posting from someone who was trying to isolate a
vibration in a syncro by removing the front D.S.. Could somebody give me the
scoop . All of a sudden I've been getting a intermittent vibe. from the
drivetrain. It occcurs at random right around 45 MPH. Pushing in the clutch
pedal makes no difference. I had new tires installed recently, though since
it's not a constant vibration I kind of ruled out the balancing. Any clues
would be greatly appreciated.
