Subject: Re: WAIT! - was Re: cheap fix to vanagon hesitation problem

I haven't done any work on this recently.  A combination of list members
have looked at the picture and deduced that the parts cost should be
about $15.  To get the final values of components and to ensure an
accurate schematic it will require me to desolder all the components
with the risk of destroying my $100 harness ...

The circuit has been diagnosed as &quot;an active filter&quot; (thanks to Albrecht Jamder)
with the only semi-conducter being a Philips/Signetics NE5230 op-amp.

As soon as things settle down here I'll revisit the project if the list
thinks there enough demand for the solution.

 &gt;&gt;  I'll post a GIF as soon as I draw
 &gt;&gt;the schematic and decode what the SMD's are.

 &gt;Hi Frank, I can't decode the file you sent, my program claims it's corrupt. 
 &gt;tried Graphics WorkShop and HiJack Pro to no avail. Please resend same or; 
 &gt;as Postscript or WPG or HPGL or, possibly by FAX as well? 
 &gt;         thanks, tim s.   fax (506) 453-5025.
