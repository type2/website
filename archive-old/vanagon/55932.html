In a message dated 97-02-13 10:37:13 EST, you write:

&gt; &gt;From the '88 brochure I have and the color chart of that year I can report
&gt;  that the Vanagon cam in 4 colors that year:
&gt;  
&gt;  	Flash Silver (so did the '90 &amp; '91)
&gt;  	Toronado Red
&gt;  	Blue (I need to look at the brochure for the exact name - med dk)
&gt;  	Pastel White
&gt;  
&gt;  	The first three of these were metallic paints. The white was not.

My 88 brochure shows the following 5 colors available: 
Pastel White, Flash Silver Metallic, Dove Blue Metallic,  
Titian Red Metallic, Wolfram Grey Metallic. 

Not all colors were available on all models.

Note that the Titian Red Metallic is quite different than the Tornado Red
(non metallic) offered in some 1990 vans and in 1991.

VW also made Wolfsburg Limited Edition Vanagon GLs in 1988.
Their paint choices were: Orly Blue Metallic,  Bordeaux Red Metallic, 
Flash Silver Metallic, Wolfram Grey Metallic
