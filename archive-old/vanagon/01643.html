Subject: Re: alternators

the reason your alternator voltage drops so low with all those accessories on
is that the wire from the alternator to the fuse box is not big enough. The
stretch between the battery and the starter is big enough--its just that the
othr two stretches are wire too small.

Me and others have added wire (using different methods) and the voltage drop
dispppears.
