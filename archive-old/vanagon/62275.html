Subject: Re: Synchro Doublecab

&gt; 1986 Vanagon Double cab 4wd Synchro, white, black and grey int. 2.1 EFI
&gt; watercooled, pb, ps, stereo, tow pkg, good cond. with current tags and smog
&gt; certif. $18,500  (818-453-8823)  (Southern California)
&gt;
This was the second of these things that I was supposed to look at when
I got mine.  If it is the same one:

It has no diff-lock, and has the cloth Transporter seats with
walk-through (I think).  It came down from Vancouver about a
month ago (it was advertised in the Sacramento paper at the time
of a big VW show there).  Back then, with Canadian plates, the 
asking price was $11k.  I wonder why MSDS is selling this so fast?
Might be something wrong, as they only just have had the time to
get it registered.  Might be a different 1986 white syncro doublecab
in SoCal.  They are so very common... 

I never made it to look at this one.  The one I got (for $13k) had a
diff-lock and was in absolutely pristine condition (it really does
look new -- you have to look carefully to see the wear on this one).
I wanted to look at both, but could not get the arrangements right.
I would have preferred the white, instead of the &quot;buckskin&quot; color on
mine, though.

And I'm not in SoCal, so I won't go look at it for you.
