On July 16 Bruce Norton asks:

*The camper conversion was done by an outfit called Country Homes 
*Camper in Scotts Valley California. Since it is not the Westy(not 
*trying to be cool here, I just can't remember how to spell the 
*proper name) I am trying to establish the value of this vehicle and 
*the quality of the camper conversion compared to the Westy.

I had an 82 Country Homes camper for a few years.  The van was possessed
(as in needing an exorcism) but the camping stuff worked out OK.  I never
had a Westy but think the Westy stuff is a little better made.  One
advantage that County homes advertised was that all the camp gear was
removable.  
The only funky thing I didn't like about the camp set up was the bed which
was thin plywood with a foam pad over it.  it was comfortable enough but
still cheesy. Can't help on worth of an 84.
