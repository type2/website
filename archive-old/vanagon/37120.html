Subject: 76 gas station balls wanted

Hi all,

Now here's a strange request, maybe.

You guys over the water have a brand/chain of gas stations called
'76' ,yeah?

Now aparently in the gas station shops they sell '76' balls, to put on
the end of your radio antenna.

The balls are about the same size as a table-tennis ball, and are made
from polystyrene.

They are red with the '76' logo printed on them. Now I guess they are
only a few cents to buy.

So here goes, do any of you guys know what i'm talking about, if so
then does any one fancy sending a bunch of these balls to me - of course
i'll pay for everything, postage etc..

Maybe we could do a swap for something English?

How about it then,

Lee.
