&gt;&gt; I'll add another question to this note.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My temperature control levers are not lit up, so it's hard to see what the 
&gt;&gt; temperature controls are set at, when driving at night.  One of the two fan 
&gt;&gt; control dials is lit up.  What else is supposed to be lit up on an 84 
&gt;&gt; vanagon?  Are the temp control levers lit up?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;There is a wee peanut bulb fitted to the plastic behind the heater 
&gt;levers. Pull off the fan knobs and the heater knobs and carefully pry the 
&gt;control faceplate from the dash. The light should be obvious.
&gt;Grab handfulls of those tiny bulbs when at the wreckers ;)

i replaced my LCD clock bulb, what you have to do to get the bulb out it
twist the black part in either direction (i think) and it should twist and
pop out.. 

good luck.
