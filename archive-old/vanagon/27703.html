Subject: Advice on V6 Vanagon Steering Rack?


Hi, Vanagoners...

After my last motormouth post about the newly-acquired '80 Vanagon with
Chevy V6 engine, here's a quickie, with a few questions:

1.) Did/do any Vanagons have power steering?

2.) If so, is it possible to put a power-steering rack on an '80 Vanagon
that presently has nonpower steering? Will it bolt on directly? Is the
steering ratio the same or different? Anyone have a power rack they want
to sell?

3.) For an '80 Vvanagon with nonpower steering, how do you replace
the tie rods? (aka inner tie rod ends, the ones that connect to the rack).

4.) Any particular difficulties in doing such replacement (tie rods)?
Special tools, special techniques, secrets gotchas to watch for? This is
aside from the need for a wheel alignment after installation, of course.

5.) For an '80 vanagon that's been experiencing wheel shimmy due to
worn parts, out of round tires etc., do you know of any particular front
end parts that can get worn as a result? (A pretty vague question, sorry).

Thanks in advance...
