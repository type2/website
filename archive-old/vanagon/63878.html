     The Pennzoil page gives a pretty good rundown of what is needed to do 
     the conversion.  There's also a list by state of shops who install the 
     product.
     
     I need to resist becoming the internet &quot;go-between&quot; for anyone who 
     only has e-mail, but I suppose I could transcribe some info if you 
     can't get at it.
