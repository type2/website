Subject: Broken wiring connectors on an '84

Hello,

I was poking around in the engine bay this weekend, and noticed a  
couple of broken wiring connectors that I hope I can get help on.   
Vehicle is a recently acquired '84 gasoline.

One is the wire that comes from the oil pressure sender which is  
nestled in amongst the left push rod tubes.  The end of this  
connector is just tied around a hose on top of the engine, and so  
far as I can see, the corresponding connector is not obviously  
visible.  Any ideas on how I can try to trace the missing connector.

The other is more perplexing because it doesn't seem to match the  
Bentley FI wiring harness diagram for this vehicle.  On the intake  
air housing (the 90 deg elbow), there are two outlets: an upper and  
a lower.  On the lower is a broken connector/sensor.   Which  
sensor/connector is this?  Both halves of the connector are broken.   
It appears that corrosion set in and when there was an attempt to  
decouple them the connector broke.  The connector half on the wire  
is again tied to a nearby hose.  The other end of the wire does not  
go into the main harness and to the multi-point box as one would  
expect.  Instead it ends in an unconnected spade like connection  
that has been folded over.  This end lies just below the relay box.   
It *appears* to be part of the harness as it is tied to the rest of  
the tributaries of the main harness, but rather than joining the  
harness, it seems to require its own termination.  Again from what I  
can see, there is no obvious receptacle for this connector.

Any help would be most appreciated.  If my descriptions aren't  
clear enough, I would be happy to try to explain this situation  
better, as I am eager to fix these connections.

advTHANKSance

Cheers,
