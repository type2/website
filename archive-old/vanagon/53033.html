Hello Curtis,
        I drive may '86 syncro 25 miles to work each day.  Most of the
distance 19 miles is interstate highway.  I normaly drive at 70 mph, but on
days I am running late I have driven it at 75.  I have driven it at 80 mph
on a day that if I was late I would have lost two days of holiday pay.  I
was nervous the whole way, talk of adrenalin high.  The engine never even
got hot.  Oil pressure stayed normal.  I don't recommend running a 2.1 at 80
mph for long periods, but 70 mph is no problem, 75 mph is on the edge of the
green zone on the tach so it probabley won't self-destruct.  The engine will
ware quicker at higher rpms though.  I change the oil every 2500 to 3000
miles and keep the van tuned up.  Take care.
