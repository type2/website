 the place i would have used is whre the heater controls are... &gt;&gt;

I got a triple gauge cluster ( since the wasserboxers already have the stock
H2O temp gauge, I'm gonna replace the one in the triple gauge cluster w/ a
oil psi gauge)
anyway, I got it out of a '80-'84 Audi 4000 S.  It's really neat, as it fits
just in the space of the heater blower console cover.(that big plastic panel
behind the gearshift) I'll just cut the cover out in mount them in there. It
will be a very neat fit, since the sides of the Audi cluster are already
angled the same way as the plastic blower cover.
