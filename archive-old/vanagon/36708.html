Hi all!

I am very happy (and I'm sure many are relieved to hear..) to say we 
are now the proud owners of a white '88 Westy!!

I would like to say a very big thank you to all who have helped me out 
with invaluable tips and advice over the past months (you know who 
you are!)

Although I still love the loafs, and hope to have one someday, the 
brick westy just made more sense right now, and it felt right. After 
listing all the things needing attention, I was able to the price 
down to $8300, including having them fix an oil leak, and pressure 
test the cooling system and repair *any* source of leakage. They are 
an ex-VW dealer, but are still authorized for service, so I expect 
they will do the job right. This last clause was due to a fair amount 
of steam from the exhaust when cold, although I couldn't detect any 
other signs of h/g leakage. 

It is also missing the main table &amp; leg - I've sourced one for $125 - 
does this sound fair?

And it will need new poptop seals soon - is there a good source in 
Canada for these, or should I get them in Calif. when were there? I'd 
heard that Calif Imports in Vancouver carried the West Coast Metric 
stuff... Is it possible to get seals without the metal clips which 
rust away?

Our Westy also has some rust under the rubber mats in the front 
footwells, around the four holes - what is a good way to deal with 
this before it gets worse?

Again, thanks to all of you for your help, and here's hoping I can 
start offering some in return!

Shawn.
