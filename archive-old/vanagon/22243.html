&gt;                       RE&gt;PTFE as Transmission Elixir?              8/7/95
&gt; 
&gt; RUN don't walk back to the seller and get rid of that stuff!!!!.    Syncros in
&gt; a tranny require a certain optimal amount of friction,  and PTFE isn't the
&gt; answer.  For a straight transmission, Redline Synthetic Oil corp. makes a
&gt; Manual Transmission Lubricant, (MTL) that is specifically designed to retain
&gt; the right amout of friction for the syncros, while providing proper
&gt; lubrication.  It is especially good in cold weather to relieve stiff shifting
&gt; before the gearbox warms up.   I THINK that they make another version for
&gt; transaxels like VWs use, or that MTL is compatible.  You can check with them
&gt; at:  Redline Synthetic Oil Corp., 3450 Pacheco Blvd, Martilnez, Ca. 94553. 
&gt; (510) 228-7576.
&gt; 
&gt; The standard disclaimers apply, I have no connection, get no benefit (other
&gt; than the fact that with  MTL in my 136Kmile  5 sp tranny on a BMW the tranny
&gt; sure is a lot happier with MTL than wihout it)  etc  . . .

&gt; Tim Smith recently warned against using anything with PTFE for engines.
&gt; Does the same concern hold true for transmissions? I recently bought some
&gt; transmission cure-all in desperation (Shifting is quite stiff and I'm
&gt; reaching for a cure), but I haven't put it in the tranny (even though I
&gt; changed fluid this weekend). I don't like the tight shifting, but I can
&gt; live with that for the next six months as I save up the $$$ for a rebuilt
&gt; or new (yeah, dream-on, bubba) tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; The retailer told me today that I could bring it back in the next day or
&gt; two if I decided I didn't want to risk it. Should I put that $10 bill back
&gt; into my own pocket? or should I go for it.
&gt; 

However, Volkswagen recommends in the owner's manual of our '71 Bus
that if winter weather remains around -40 degrees, the manual tranny
should be filled with ATF (automatic transmission fluid). Of course,
it never gets that cold here in San Diego!
