 [IMHO] I'm afraid that after reading the archive on replacing the stock
bus tranny with the Porsche 5-speed, I must disagree on it's degree of
difficulty. It seemed a bit too labor intensive for my taste. With all
the fabrication and parts matching involved (good luck finding
affordable/available Porsche parts), I have to wonder if it wouldn't be
easier to rebuild a stock 4-spd gearbox with different gear ratios for a
taller 4th, or shorter 1st. I'm not stating that this type of
modification is definitely possible, I really wouldn't know, but I'm
sure that it would be simpler than *that* little rainy day project. 

 Turning less RPMs at highway speeds would sure be nice in my Westy, so
how about it people, does anyone know if you can throw a taller 4th into
an air-cooled Vanagon. 
 I sure wouldn't mind revving 3rd a little longer/higher to accommodate
a taller 4th providing improved gas mileage and less engine noise on the
highway.
