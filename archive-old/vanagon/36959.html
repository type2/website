Thanks to everyone who responded. As suspected I found someone locally who
had the 2&quot; thick Bentley's. Went to the copy center last night and copied
the whole chapter with ALL of the wiring diagrams.  Every once in a while
the telephone and common sense is better than laziness and a very helpful
list group. Thanks again.
