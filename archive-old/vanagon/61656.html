Subject: Lichfield Weekend

Hi Volks,
   FOr those east coasters who might be thinking of going to
Litchfield,Ct this weekend, let me say this.   GO!  its a good time.  If
your in the neighborhood, stop by the DJ table and say hi.  That will be
me.  IF anyone is going to be around Saturday, I'm camping out a Looking
Glass Hill CG. There is a toy show during the day and a chili cookoff
Saturday nite.  OR stop by the INN Saturday nite, Hot VW's will be
hosting a party there.  Stop by.  Take care.
