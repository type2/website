&gt;&gt;Brazing is expensive, O2 is $7.87 a bottle at Home Desperate, but fun, and I
&gt;&gt;only burned myself once.                      ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
&gt;
&gt;Actually Eugene, it should be Home *Defect*!
&gt;
&gt;Just out of curiosity, where did you buy your brazing/welding rig, Home
&gt;Defect as well? How do you like it?

Yes indeed, I use the inexpensive (under $30) bottom of the line Oxy/Mapp
gas little dual hose thing with a single small nozzle head.  I think it's
great, even if you do go through Oxy bottles if you have larger projects.  I
use the bronze, flux coated rods, they are easy to melt and flow well.  The
Propane/Oxy bottles work almost the same, but they don't get as hot when you
really run them wide open, which I almost never do.

I'll post this to the list since it's such a fun part of VW work.

Eug,
