&gt;I could never figure it out, and finally got pissed one day and rewired the 
&gt;whole section under the dash and into the fusebox. I didn't mess with the 
&gt;battery cables, just wires under the dash and behind the front kick panel (does 
&gt;'56 have kick panels?) Any that did it...problem gone.

Hmmmm.  Well, its _supposed_ to have them...
