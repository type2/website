Ron,
The oxygen sensor is a regularly scheduled replacement item.  Check with 
your maintenance schedule.  There is no service reminder light on 1988 
and later models, most of which have a 60,000 mile interval.  Or just 
have a shop equipped with the right testing equipment test it.  Testing 
is different for sensors depending on what FI system you have.

&gt; Hello Vanagoners!?:

&gt; I am new to the list so excuse me if I miss some net protocol or other.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been following the conversation about the o2 sensor with some
&gt; interest.................................I did not know about the reset
&gt; button=8A pity!
&gt; 
&gt;         Here is my story: In 1984 I ordered from the factory a brand new
&gt; marine blue Wolfsberg edition weekender with the curtain and screen
&gt; package, wide whale corduroy seats, gray stripe =8Ashe was a beauty!
&gt; 
&gt; 18K miles on sabbatical trip to DC. And the heads fail.  I was fortunate
&gt; enough to be near Christiansberg VA.  Where a really good dealership
&gt; mechanic did the rebuild, I rented a car and went back to DC. For a week.
&gt; VW of America picked up the tab and I had no more serious trouble until
&gt; around 90k when, you guessed it, the -light- comes on.  At this point I'm
&gt; living 200 miles away from the nearest dealership and a shade tree mechanic
&gt; in Jonesboro AR sez to me: SheEOOT!  =8ADon't mean nothin' but instead of
&gt; punching that reset button he disconnected the o2 sensor!  =8AEngine begins
&gt; running rich, no one can set the idle properly, cat.converter eventually
&gt; burns out.  I still got 120k miles out of her but she never was quite
&gt; right, often had gas in the oil and other associated problems.   Ironically
&gt; it was not the engine but the automatic transmission that finally did her
&gt; in, another botched repair, this time of a simple O-ring seal leak!  In
&gt; 1992 traded her in on a new '91 burgundy and gray GL with all the extras.
&gt; The Dealer told me he sent old blue off to California where &quot;they're a lot
&gt; more popular and someone will appreciate her enough to do the needed work&quot;.
&gt; Aside from a slight ding in the sliding door just ahead of the rear wheel
&gt; well she was pristine inside and out.
&gt; 
&gt; Postscript: my '91 does not have the illconceived dash light and she is
&gt; nearing her 90k milestone, I really love her too so how do I know when the
&gt; o2 sensor actually does need attending to?
