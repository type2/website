Subject:      Re: Vanagon idle hunting --FIX

&gt;&gt; what the idle valve (seems like there is another name for it) does is to
&gt;&gt; keep a pipe closed when cold, and open up a little round 'valve' when it
&gt;&gt; warms up. like an old electric choke.  the bentley test (as i remember) is
&gt;&gt; 'if it hummms/vibrates, it's working'. ?
&gt;That's an interesting test.  I can just see the test flow now.  If it just
&gt;hummms/vibrates its okay.  If it is singing &quot;Melancholy Baby&quot; replace it. ;)

Hummm to me, my melancholy Air Valve,
open up so air flows through ...



i don't make this stuff up, folks. i just report it. ;)
