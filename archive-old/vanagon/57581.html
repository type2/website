Subject: 87 GL For sale

Hello list,
     I am posting this for my brother-in-law. This van is very clean, and
well kept.
1987 GL
Air conditioning
Power steering
Power Brakes
97 k  miles
Front and rear heaters
Heated remote control mirrors
4 speed trans
Steel rims with full wheel covers

The following are new items:
        Heads
        Water pump
        Piston rings
        Motor mounts
        Clutch disk
        Pressure plate
        Throw out bearing
        Pilot bearing
        4 Tires 
        All four shocks

As you can see, my brother-in-law intended to keep the van.  He replaced all
items that needed attention.  He is selling it only because he has too.  If
you are interested, you had better act fast. If his financial position
improves he will not be selling it.

     The van is located in Topeka Kansas, please contact him directly at
(913) 272-8919 after 6:00 pm central.
