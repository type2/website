&gt; Hello:
&gt; 
&gt;         Maggie has sprung a serious oil leak.  It seems to be coming from
&gt; around the oil cooler, but I can't tell, because the oil filter is in the
&gt; way.  But it's a huge leak, and I can see it pouring down the left side of
&gt; the oil pan there, down to the bottom, where it drips of at a rate of about
&gt; a drip per second (holy cow!).

Sounds like your oil cooler and/or connections thereto. Time to crawl 
under there with a flashlight for a real close look. Automobile Atlanta 
says that the oil cooler O rings can be replaced with the engine in 
place. Expect to do a bunch of disasembly and maybe some of that &quot;while 
i'm in there&quot; kinda stuff. Never had to do it yet, so I can't give you 
details.
