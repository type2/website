Subject:       Busii fer sell in Yewtah

Local paper listed the following:

'62 Double Cab - $2500
'57 Oval Bug - $???? (forget)
'65 Kombi - $2500

If the '62 is one that I've seen it is really clean (original 
faded blue paint) other than the obligatory rocker rust.

If anyone is interested, I'll get the phone number.  

Again that's in or around Salt Lake City--a small city where your 
government keeps and burns some of its chemical weapons.
