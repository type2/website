Subject: Wife wants a Vanagon - need help choosing

Volks Folks,

Actually the wife wants a mini-van, I think it needs to be a VW.  I am a long
time VW owner but have never ventured into Vanagon ownership.  If I want heat
(in the winter), A/C (in the summer), an automatic transmission, and
RELIABILITY, what year/model should I be looking for???  Any opinions
appreciated.

-Dan
