Subject: BIG NEWS/Use of List
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

My apologies for singling Ron out, and I do wish him luck in his 
venture, it does take alot of courage to start a small business these 
days-but honestly, some concerns of mine, and others (judging by the 
response I've been getting) is the use of the list for commercial 
purposes.  I will agree that mail order has its place for the informed 
consumer.  A more immediate concern is the proper use of the list.  
This is dependent on how this is handled in the future, but Ron has 
already stated that he plans on letting us know when &quot;a specific 
opportunity avails itself&quot;.  Shouldn't we offer the same courtesy to 
any VW retailer/mail order company that wishes to use the purchasing 
power of the list? If not, why special priviledges to the few?  Its 
fantastic that we have the ability to purchase parts at a reduced rate, 
but are't we opening up a door that best remains closed? Every list 
I've been a member of actively stomps down on ANY commercial enterprise 
trying to cash in on the purchasing power of the list. From what I've 
seen, it's generally frowned upon in the on-line community.  Pointing 
people in the right direction to obtain parts/service -sure.  Blatant 
commmercial advertising-no thanks.  By opening up a business Ron has 
put himself into a new category.  He is no longer a listmember trying 
to get us a good deal and covering his expenses.  He is now up there 
with Bus Boys, Parts Place, etc., and should be treated as they would 
be if they were to try to advertise on the list.  Oh well, I've said my 
piece, let the spamming begin.
