Subject: EuroVan on TV series...


I was just channel surfing and saw a EuroVan Weekender, great I
thought! Unfortunately it was on a program called Acapulco H.E.A.T.
which appears to be a low budget version of Bay Watch....the
producers couldn't even afford the amount silicone implants they 
have on Boob...oops Bay Watch.

Well at least one EV made it to TV!  ;-)

And it didn't end up getting smashed up by a police car in a high speed 
chase like all other T.V. Volkswagens seem to?  ;)
