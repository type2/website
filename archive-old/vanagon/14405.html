&gt; A request for opinions from a newbie. We have recently acquired a '80
&gt; Westphalia. We were told that the starter had been replaced due to 
&gt; starting problems in '93 and a new battery installed the same spring.
&gt; 
&gt; After four hours of highway driving we pulled off for lunch. The van had
&gt; started no prob that morning. There had been negligible current drain while
&gt; driving (i.e., no headlights, etc.) and the water pump was used sparingly
&gt; at lunch. After lunch - no start. The solenoid &quot;clicks&quot; but no start. The
&gt; local town service station came and boosted us for a start and checked the
&gt; battery (nearly fully charged) and the alternator (good output). I checked
&gt; the automatic transmission neutral safety switch on the selector - no prob.
&gt; 
&gt; So what gives? This happened a second time on the trip - fortunately after
&gt; refuelling - the booster was right there and free. Is this a case for Muir's
&gt; &quot;By-pass solenoid&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; All info, opinions and myths gratefully received.

As one newbie to another I had the same problem with my 81 with automatic 
transmission.  I found that if the alternator belt is even a little loose 
that it wouldn't charge properly.  And it seemed to drain the battery so 
quickly that I have to wonder if the problem is somewhere else.  But it 
has not happend to me since I keep the belt tightned.  I have probably 
not been much  help but have satisfied my need to commiserate.
