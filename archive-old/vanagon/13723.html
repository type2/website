&gt; Ain't that the truth!  
&gt; 1)  When did you see the last VW commercial/advertisement?  A long time ago.  
&gt; I wonder if the words &quot;precipitous decline in U.S. sales&quot; means anything to
&gt; the highly trained and educated VWoA marketing staff?  
&gt; 
I really don't know what you mean, VW has been for them at least
flooding the market with TV adds for the Jetta, little black one
driving around etc.  And actually they hit the Passat VR6 and Eurovan
preety hard in major network ads back at their introduction in '92
or whatever, for many months but realized no increase in sales.
The problem with VW today boils down to one thing and one thing only
COST$$$$, they simply can't build a car in Germany and sell it here
at anything remotely approaching a profit, this is not their fault!
The German economy sucks and they pay way too much in labor, the
answer was to stick it out here in PA until the Japs came in what
'89 or '90 or so and hit the US trade commision so hard that import
tariffs dissapeared, unfortunately that didn't happen, unfortunately
VW could never iron out the US quality control like the Japs were
able to anyway.  Their current solution, Mexican production suffers
the same quality control fate, but hell I'd still like too see 20000 Mexican
production Eurovans a year with knobs falling off if VW could bring a base
one here for $14,500 or so, ridiculous? well remember they once rolled
back Vanagon prices in '90 to about that mark for the base model.
A lot of people will argue that the problem was lack of the VR6 or
archaic styling, but I feel that anyone who was a solid VW van fan
up to the Eurovan was not scared by these facts, the power was
incredible compared to a Wasserboxer and the styling gave you that
cavernous interior, the problem boiled down to that $22k+ price tag.
Take for instance my father, bought a new '65, '67 when married, '68
to replace the '67 hit by a Mack truck, '76, and even an '86 Vanagon.
When I rolled the '86 in about '91 he looked for a while for a nice
Westy Vanagon without luck, waited for the Eurovan, then shrugged and
bought, yes don't kill me for this a CARAVAN.  Actually he is now
looking at a friends slightly used Eurovan as this guy has already taken
the major depreciation hit.  If VW wants to solve its problems it should
can the stupid Concept 1 project (which will not sell as nostalgia sells
real Type 1's only) take all the money, fire the entire VWOA staff, take
all dealerships away from current dealers and start entirely anew in the
US, I imagine first a network of SuperDealers, say only about 30 to 50
in the country, selling and serviceing only VW, with at least 20 of each
and every model on the lot, no dickering what you see is what you
(Saturn) get pricing at just over cost to bring em here prices as this
should be OK since VW has been losing on everything recently anywway.
Direct customer feedback on service, sales, parts, and everything else
about the SuperDealer to the entirely new VWOA staff intrinsic and
encouraged via 800 number and WWW link suporting a sort of ten strikes
yearly and you're out program whereby if over ten justifiably negative
reports come in about the Dealer, they lose the franchise (this could be
used to shit can current dealers as well if VW didn't want to boot them
all at once).  Keep the current warranty structure and give a wider
selection of ranges within models, no you have to have leather, power
everything, and a VR6 in your Passat, believe me my mom doesn't want or
need a VR6, her 1990 16V wagon has more power (when it runs) than she
ever needs.  If VW doesn't take an attitude like this they will not last
until the year 2000 in the country, they will sort of become a gigantic
Alfa Romeo, and we will be forced to drive used 1998's until we die,
piecing them together with bootleg Mexican parts.  Sorry about this but
I really needed to get it off my chest.
