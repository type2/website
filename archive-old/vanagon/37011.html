Subject: Help regarding welding web sites

To All:

I've been contacted by a Canadian student tasked with providing her school
paper with an occupational profile of weldors.  

I would appreciate hearing of any welding-related lists or web sites.  I
think a professional weldor would do better at answer her questions, but
there seems to be a scarcity of such types on the net.

As for VW content, the student apparently came across my article on welding
relating to VW repairs.

Extracted from her message:

 Your experience as a welder
1. How did you become interested in welding?
2. What do you like the best about your job?
3. What do you find the hardest part to be?
4. Could you describe the best or worst day on the job?
5. Could you describe a day on the job? (with as much detail as you have
time for?

A few job facts

1. What are a welder's job duties?
2. Is it 9-5 work? Overtime/flexible hours?
3. What education did you need to become a welder?


Thanks so much for answering,

Heather

&gt;I'll be happy to help if I can but I don't consider myself a very good
&gt;weldor.  After seeing your questions I may be able to direct you toward
&gt;better sources of information.
