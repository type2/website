Subject: Vanagon Transaxle Oil Change

Question here.  I want to change the transaxle oil in my '85 Vanagon.  It
looks impossible to get the drain bolt out due to the exhaust pipes being in
the way.  My big old allen wrench won't even begin to fit in there.

I would like to put synthetic oil in (provided I can get the old stuff out,
I'll leave it in if someone tells me I have to rip the exhaust system out).
Any suggestions?  Redline?  Which kind?
