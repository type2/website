Subject: best tires for westy?

I know tires keep coming up on the list,but I don't recall all the
suggestions. But I have been checking around, and the tire dealers say that
the only reinforced tires or trailer/moblehome tires = 6ply. I believe
these will ride really rough. Are there any radial tires that are
reinforced? Suggestions would be appreciated.
