Subject: Needs Ride from DizzyLand to So. Cal Meet!

Hey California listers!,

My wife and I are gonna be in Anaheim (supposedly) goin' to DizzyLand with
the people from her work. Part of a work motivation team building thingie.
Arriving way late on Friday night. The work tribe is gonna do two days of
the Majik-kingdom. We wanna bail (so much for team building) and do the
Vintage meet at the Jamboree site (where ever that is). Budget limits us to
groveling for a ride to and from Saturday's meet in the park. Want to do the
meet in the AM and DizzyLand in the late afternoon/PM and Sunday. Two days
of Mickey is two too many for Rusty. Being Goofy is enough! ;) 
Mrs. VanBondo is cool enuf to wanna go early for the swaps. 

Can anyone who lives in near Orange/Anaheim give us a ride? =)
