Subject: diesel engine cover

Yet another question...should I have the tin pan installed under the 
diesel engine on my 82 Vanagon ....Does it serve any purpose besides drip pan.
My wife tells me I sound like a dumptruck leaving the house..could this help with 
the outside noise???  If I need to install ...how and where does the pan attach 
to the bottom side of my van...

					Thanks much
