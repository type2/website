Subject: Re: Easy CV repacking

&gt;Hello all.  I thought I would pass along something I tried recently.  
&gt;This was inspired by some unremembered person who did something 
&gt;similar on a race buggy that needed the cv's repacked after each race.
&gt;
&gt;Basically, they would bolt a plate on either side of the cv.  One of 
&gt;the plates had a grease nipple on it.  This allowed them to pack the 
&gt;cv full of grease and make the rest of the procedure a bit easier.
&gt;
   
&gt;
&gt;After the boot and cv are full you can unbolt the plate and wipe any 
&gt; 
Hi James

   UNREMEMBERED! How soon we forget. Well at least you rememberd the
important part, how to work on the VW easier. I am concerned with pumping
grease into the CV and actually filling the boot. I have always been told to
keep the grease out of the boot as much as possible. Of course you will get
grease on the inside of the boot after you grease the CV and start driving
the bus but you describe putting grease in and filling the boot. I think the
proper way is to just pack the CVs with the a plate on each side then
install them onto the axle and boot. When you pack the CV with the 2 plate
method make sure you put something into the splined axle hole so it doesn't
just fill up with grease along with the rest of the CV. This isn't too messy
of a system but I still hate doing CVs.
