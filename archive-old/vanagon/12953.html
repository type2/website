Subject:      owner's manuals

i just talked to the parts guy in atlanta again ... he said he THOUGHT he'd
ordered everything (manual-wise) that he had in his listing. but he's gonna
try to see what else he can get from the folks in Maryland (which, he said,
was where all the documentation comes from).

so we'll see what else pops up in a few weeks.
