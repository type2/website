Subject: Poptop Rattle

Hello-

I am an occasional subscriber to the list, and am constantly amazed at the level
of knowledge and commitment that is expressed here. I have an '86 full camper
(55k miles) that I purchased 2 years ago to replace my '83.5. My vanagon has
recently developed several irritating problems, but I will address them in
separate messages.
The most irritating recent development is that my poptop latch has begun to
rattle. I can't find any way to adjust the tension, and I can't understand what
has changed to make it start rattling. Right now I have straps cinched down on
the poptop support poles to pull the latch down out of contact with the strike
plate.
Any ideas on a better, more permanent solution?
