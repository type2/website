Subject: 84 Westy Gas Mileage?

Recently purchased my first Westy after a long 8 year want/search.
Just wondering if anyone can tell me what the average mileage is for this
bad boy.  I'm getting around 17 no more/no less on highway and in town.  I
used to drive an 84 Vanagon when I was in the Army in Deutchland.  It
seemed to get much better that this.  Yeah, yeah I know the Westy package
adds weight but I'm not sure what is standard.  The vehichle has 70,000 on
it and has been worked on very little.  Typical old man story from the old
man I got it from, however he recently had FI cleaned and I'm wondering if
he wasn't having problems too.  Any help would be great.  Thanks.
