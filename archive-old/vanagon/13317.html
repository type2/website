Subject: RE: Oil leak problem---help!!!

        Dear Evan:
        
        I'm not as knowledgeable as others on this list, but I had the 
        symptoms you described and it was my oil cooler leaking.  72 
        &quot;sort of Westy&quot; (solid top, no expandable roof) with the suitcase 
        engine.  Once I got into fixing the cooler leak, I just went 
        ahead and did a seal job.  Fixing the cooler leak cured the left 
        side leak and I did the others because I could tell that they wre 
        turning birttle.  Hope this helps but others may be able to be 
        more specific.
        
        Peace,
        Skip Correll
        Chattanooga, Tn
