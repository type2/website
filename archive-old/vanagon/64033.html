Jahan and others,

My van has Michelin XZX 185 R 14 (a 78 series tire) tires all around, and I
like them.  They are reinforced sidewall tires, 6-ply.  Unfortunately,
these have also been discontinued, I have heard.  Michelin does make a tire
especially for the Vanagon but I can't remember the name, it may indeed be
the MXT.  That particular tire was designed specifically for the Vanagon
and came on the van from the factory.  

Regarding the 205/70R14 tires, will a 205 tire fit the Vanagon without
interfering with turning radius and without rubbing on suspension
components?    That might be a nice upgrade from 185.  I was considering
buying the Yokohama Y370s when I needed tires, but I guess I won't if they
are discontinued.  

Of course, putting 205s on my '81 (no power steering) might cause me to
build disproportionally large arm muscles after turning the wheel in low
speed situations :-)

As far as tire height for each one goes, I'll do the math to see if
speedometer error will be significant:

185 R 14 (defaults to 185/78R14) sidewall height = 78% of 185mm = 144.4mm
sidewall height.
195/75R14 sidewall height = 75% of 195mm = 146.25mm sidewall height
205/70R14 sidewall height = 70% of 205mm = 143.5mm sidewall height

Wow, the 185R14 tire is actually taller than the 205/70R14 tire!  Not by
much tho, and not enough to cause a problem with speedometer error or
engine cooling (for those air-cooled folks) if the 205/70 was selected. 
Well, that's nice to know as 205's would look pretty sharp on those wheels,
I imagine, tho snow traction wouldn't be helped.

Any advantages or disadvantages to moving from 185R14 to 205/70R14, meaning
differences experienced in going to a 20mm wider tire?

Anybody have 205s on their Vanagons?  How do you like them?  

This has piqued my interest, even tho I will not need tires for a good
while.

&gt;        
&gt;        The choices for tires are sure becoming meager. From the 
&gt;        archives, I've gleaned the following popular options for my 
&gt;        (new to me) 91 Westy, non-syncro w/alloys:
&gt;        
&gt;        Michelin MXT 205/70R14
&gt;        Reinforced 6-ply
&gt;        Approx. $93 in SF Bay Area
&gt;        
&gt;        Yokohama Y370 LT 195/75R14
&gt;        Light Truck 8-ply
&gt;        Unavailable in SF Bay Area
&gt;        
&gt;        The tire dealer said the Yoko Y370 has been replaced by the 
&gt;        SD05, otherwise known as the &quot;Super Digger&quot; for $71. The name 
&gt;        Super Digger conjures images of an aggressive tread pattern, 
&gt;        and howling tire noise on the Interstate as a result. A call 
&gt;        to Yokohama HQ to confirm the demise of the Y370, a perennial 
&gt;        listserv favorite, has yet to be returned.
&gt;        
&gt;        The tire dealer said the Y370's 195/75R14 is not the 
&gt;        recommended aspect ratio for a top-heavy Westy, and that 
&gt;        185/80R14 or 205/70R14 are the only suitable choices. He said 
&gt;        he's seen two Westys with the Y370s where the tire had 
&gt;        separated. He wasn't too hip on these, as you can surmise.
&gt;        
&gt;        The only other choice the dealer has available was one I'd 
&gt;        never heard of: 
&gt;        
&gt;        Cooper Signet 185/80SR14
&gt;        8-ply
&gt;        $63
&gt;        
&gt;        Has anyone ever heard of this tire brand?
&gt;        
&gt;        Does anyone know if the Yokohama Y370 is still available? 
&gt;        
&gt;        Does anyone have any other recommendations that are less 
&gt;        expensive, and/or better than the Michelins?
&gt;        
&gt;        If you respond directly to me, I will gather up the responses 
&gt;        and post the findings to the group. 
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        Thanks,
&gt;
