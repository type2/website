Subject: Re: crack in poptop
Date: Fri, 28 Apr 95 16:47:14 EDT

&gt; My poptop has a crack which is visible from both the underside and
&gt; the top of the poptop, and leaks slowly during rain or carwashes.  Has
&gt; anyone else had this problem.  Regardless, do you have suggestions
&gt; on the best method to fix it?  I assume it should be filled/repaired
&gt; by something with a lot of flexiability and give.  Silicone?  And then
&gt; what?  Painted?  Gel coat?
&gt;

Martha, I think it should be repaired with what it is, fiberglass,
not particularly flexible.  I would say degrease with alcohol or
brake cleaner, the bottom side, sand with very coarse grit (30-50)
paper to give lots of tooth (from the inside for looks of course),
then patch with a few applications of Bondo fiberglass resin saturated
fiberglass cloth (either the random stuff or better the 0/90 woven)
I would apply one piece about 2&quot; wide for the length of the crack
then another overlapping the first, say 4&quot; wide.  Then as a final
precaution I would carfully paint a little resin on the crack from the
outside after degreasing, I have repaired fibergalss boats this way
and they have held up nicely. Patching from the outside as well would
be nice if you don't mind the looks, you could always then spread
a layer of putty and sand and paint it white though it still might not
look great.
