Subject: Re: new to list

&gt;     not only am i new to this list, i'm new to this 'net stuff as
&gt;     well..i've been reading everyone's posts and have learned alot...i
&gt;     have a 74 bug and just read the weekly statz and consider myself a
&gt;     &quot;Wanabus&quot; also.
&gt;
&gt;     my question:  i think i can follow some of the abbreviations used and
&gt;     if not have asked my more 'net experienced friends...one abbreviation
&gt;     we (i) don't know if &quot;FLAPS&quot;.  i'm sure you can help me become more
&gt;     'net worthy...

Hey Chuck,

Welcome to the list! FLAPS stands for &quot;Friendly Local Auto Parts Store&quot;. I
emphasize &quot;Friendly&quot;, cause I guess in some instances you might come across
the SLAPS (Stupid) and the HLAPS (Hostile) as has been evidenced by some
recent postings (would you like fries with that spark plug?). Here's hoping
that we listers help to continue the evolutionary progression of the rare
FLAPS species!

Cheers,

Bren
