Subject: air-cooled vanagon questions

Well, a strange and inexplicable transformation has been
taking place:  I'm starting to think vanagons are cute.  

In my slow search for some kind of camper I've mostly
looked at breadloaves, but saw this '80 camper the other day
and really liked it (the SO really liked it, too, a major
plus--all that room!, plus the cutest little kitchenette).

My questions are about parts availablity--the engine/FI is
the same as 2L buses, correct?  Are other parts (suspension, etc.)
reasonably easy to find and not outrageously expensive?  The 
stories about later vanagon $$ repairs are quite frightening
to me.

Also, can an average idiot with a voltmeter and some books
deal with fuel injection?  Stories about FI tend to be those
of the infuriating/expensive variety but what do people who
actually have FI think about it?

That's it for now--thanks in advance, you'all (Yankee who
lived in the south version of  y'all) have been v. helpful.
