        Yesterday and today I fabricated the frame piece between the end of
the longitudinal where it exits the cargo floor and where it goes up above
the beam/under the seat.  I also got one of the two read outriggers welded in.

        I first cut a piece to weld on the inside, kind of like a tongue,
about 1/4&quot; narrower than the rail.  I then fabbed a new frame rail piece by
cutting the appropriate S shape from .080 steel, and welding 1/8&quot; flat stock
around the curves, to similate a piece that had been braked in a curve.  I
welded it on both sides, making sure to get extra good penetration.  This
piece essentially created a cap over the tongue piece and the section of the
contraband compartment I'd fabbed earlier.  

        I then welded the cap section on, getting it most of the way done,
until I ran out of wire...  D'oh!

        Next I finish welding this piece down, then I finish gusseting the
frame rail to the torsion bar, and then this side of the frame is almost
done.  I still have to pull the front beam out and make some repairs to the
section in front of it, and pull the transmission out and replace ac couple
sections back there.

        In a couple days, the center sections will be here, and a few days
after that, the top hats.  The center sections tie the frame rails together
across the bus, and the shift tube, clutch cable tube, well heck, all the
tubes, go thru it.  The top hats go on top of the frame rails, across the
outriggers, and tie the frame together more, as well as supplying a base for
the floor.
