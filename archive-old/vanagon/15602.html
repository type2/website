Subject: more on bodega


OK, more info here - we've had at least two requests to make the
Bodega Bay camp at a (I think) state park called something like
the Dunes.  It's one of the Sonoma coast campgrounds, and I
believe the reservations are thru mistix, although I have to
confirm this.  At any rate, HURRAY:!!!!!!!:  they have showers,
and I think all kinds of civilized things like electricity, etc.
David Schwarze, are you listening?  HOT water, AC, showers, and REAL
toilets  :)  At any rate, it looks to be about a half mile north
of Bodega Bay, and with luck VERY near the beach.  I'm going to
check it out further and report back to you.

In the meantime, after a few back and forths with others, a
slight menu change has been suggested, which I'll work further
on and get back to you with specifics.  Suffice it to say that
a few of you felt it would be sacreligious in light of the Hitchcock
movie NOT to serve poultry of some sort.  Also, I recall that
the Russian settlement of Fort Ross is not too far from there,
so things like borscht, piroschki, and vodka shots come to mind :)
I'll work on it; suggestions welcome.
