Subject: RE: Fuel Injector Cleaner 

Audi recommends Chevron TECHRON for the Bosch KE3 Jetronic in my 90 Quattro.

I have been following this recommendation in all of my cars every 3 months/3K miles and have 
never had any work done on any of my fuel injection systems.  I also change the fuel filter 
every 2 years/24K miles and the air filter every year/12K miles.

NOTE: Audi uses CIS, where VW used pulsed systems (EFI) in Type 2s and Vanagons.  This may 
or may not make a difference?

&gt;Being a neophyte with a wasserboxer engine I am looking for opinion on fuel

&gt;FI cleaner.
&gt;
&gt;What is the conventional wisdom on this product (brand, frequency of
&gt;use,caveats)?
&gt;Does anyone out there recommend against using it?
&gt;Do any fuels, such as premium, contain it already?
