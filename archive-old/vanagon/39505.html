Subject: RE: 81 rebuild - serious help needed


&gt;1) buy longblock, factory rebuilt (with warranty) based on feedback from
&gt;the list (don't worry david, no GEX)
&gt;2) rebuild mine, new heads
&gt;3) rebuild mine, with heads in unknown condition from my brother's
&gt;engine (rebuilt by same mechanic 30,000 miles ago) now sitting in garage
&gt;far away ($200 shipping for the motor, bro unwilling to disassemble)
&gt;4) ship and install brother's motor as is, hope for the best
&gt;
&gt;so my questions are:
&gt;1) which is the recommended approach?
&gt;2) any other ideas?
&gt;3) (most important) if longblock is recommended, what is a good source?
&gt;any experience with ATK?

If it were me (a cheapskate), I'd first find out why your brother took the
engine out of his car, and if it ran fine at that time, bolt it in and see
how it goes.

Risk is, of course, that the seals etc. might be old and start to crack,
or your brother might forget that other little annoying problem it had
after this many years-- no one's memory is perfect, nor is their mechanical
expertise.

If the motor turns out unsatisfactory, then you haven't lost a whole lot
(&quot;a whole lot&quot; also being a relative term). Shipping cost, plus time and
effort of installation.

At that point, I'd then get some heads from one of those places in HVWs
that advertise long warranties (&quot;Never a dropped valve seat!&quot;), and
have your mechanic rebuild yours with those.

Free advice, worth exactly what you paid for it...
