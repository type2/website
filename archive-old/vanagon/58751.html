Subject: Dont blink your lights! *GANG DANGER*

The vanagon list had a thread regarding driving lights.

This reminded me that recenty I heard a related subject. 

*Welcome to the new world!* =(
If you see any car driving without their lights on (at night) DO NOT blink
your lights at them. Even though you might be thinking that you are doing a
good deed in desire for saftey, you are, in fact, placing yourself in danger.

There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself the
target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally left
off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks their
lights at them intending to add to the saftey factor. The good samaritian
ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter. 

I tend to think that I have a fairly decent &quot;sidewalk diploma&quot; in street
smarts but this was a new one on me. If I can help keep you and your family
NOS then all the better.
Peace, (please)

BTW: No need to belabor this thread- just file it away for the future. This
post is not intended to inflame any non VW socieconomic discussions. Please,
let's take personal rants &lt;if any&gt; off line. =)
