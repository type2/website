&gt;........
&gt;now, the sharper and more sober of you may have noticed that i stuck a new
&gt;category into the eurovan folks. just in case one of them winnebago folks
&gt;show up. well, it might happen! :)  do the eurovan folks want to separate
&gt;the pop-top weekenders from the 'real' camper that came out in 95? or just
&gt;keep lumping them together? does anybody care? :)

I would prefer to keep the winnebago in a separate category.
Does the 95 EuroVan belong to some one in US? If yes how did they get one
over here.
