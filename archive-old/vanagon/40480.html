&gt;We put clothes and towels in the  &quot;wheel well&quot; for spare tire after we
&gt;moved it to the nose.  Never made a foam block.  Too bad.  probably would
&gt;have been more comfortable.

I do believe that wedge-shaped foam piece was standard, but standard in
models with the gas heater. The heater goes where the spare tire well
was--they cut the well out--so no spare can go there, so they may as well
make bed space of it. This is the case on the 68, which had the gas heater
(before the fire) =:o  I'm sure my wedge is stock because the vinyl
matches, and no owner would pick a color this ghastly on purpose even if he
could find a supplier.
