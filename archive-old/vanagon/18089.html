Tim:

Have you had the repair done by the Antonio Volkswagon? How does it come out?
Did they do a good job on the head/gasket repair? I am considering a VW
dealer in the bay area for the same repair on the head/gasket too. I am 
wondering if The dealer you went to did a good job or not. Did you get the
VWoA to pay the bill for you (base on the FTC settlement VWoA agreed upon)?

I don't remember seeing any follow on posts from you. Please let us know
what happened. Thanks.
