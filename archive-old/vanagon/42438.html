&gt; Subject:       86 Vanagon needs more help  : ' (

&gt; Hi! I have an 86 Westy which stiiiilll won't run right. I've had three 
&gt; shops (including two dealers) each tell me different causes for a rough 
&gt; idle. The responses have included :
&gt; 
&gt; It needs a new ECU
&gt; It is probably a sticking fuel injector
&gt; It is usually not the ECU, it's most likely in the wiring harness.
&gt; 
&gt; I sure would appreciate recommendations for a GOOD mechanic shop with 
&gt; electrical experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I am not driving the van at the moment because of a blinking oil 
&gt; pressure light. The oil level and coolant both appear to be at the 
&gt; correct level. Any suggestions?
&gt; 
I would highly recommend you try a small shop named &quot;Lord of the 
Rings&quot;.  A gentleman named Bob owns the place.  He has done work for 
me in the past with great reliability and he is currently the 
&quot;doctor&quot; for a friend's 84 Westy.  He has good access to quality 
parts, good mechanics working for him, and he has been doing VW 
repairs independently for 20+ years ( I think )

Hope this helps,
