Subject: Re: Oil Splatters in Engine Compartment

In the never ending saga of the misting oil in the engine compartment...

Upon the recommendation of the venerable &quot;Bob&quot;, I checked out my aluminum (OK, 
now I know better...) crank pully this weekend. There does not appear to be any 
&quot;goove&quot; to drive the oil blow-by back in. I saw the washer at the end of the 
crack, but it didn't look very &quot;dished&quot; to me.

1. Am I missing something here?

2. What are the chances a stock pulley will cure my woes?

-Erik.
