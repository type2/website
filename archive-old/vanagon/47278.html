&gt; Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; do yopu have a brother that works at Rutgers??

No, but I've seen a Transue there (in your dept too I believe) when doing
searches on the web etc. You can bet with a name as weird as ours that
somehow we're related! Tell him you spoke (at least electronically) w/
another Transue. Bound to freak him out!


&gt; Now back to the  matter at
&gt; hand.....there are only two mechanics that I would use in  the central
Jersey
&gt; area...and I use them sparingly.  The first call  goes to Bill Egenton at
&gt; Foreign Car Werks on Rt. 28 in Bound Brook  805-0907.  Bill is real
&gt; honest....he was the service manager with VW  in Princeton and I beleave
that
&gt; his dad {who now works with him}was  also a service manager.  They are
quite
&gt; involved with the local vw  community,  and best of all he will call and
use
&gt; other mechanics  expertise to solve your special problem...****  a four
star 
&gt; mechanic!!  ** two star costs!!
&gt; 
&gt; The other shop that I have used is Albert and Son  on Rt. 22 in White 
&gt; House...A four star GERMAN mechanic....with Five star service rates! His
&gt; problem is that everything is done strictly by the book which  means every
part
&gt; that deviates from VW specs is taken out and  replaced with the right part
&gt; {$$$}.  Your Van will run perfect  without a doubt,  he even makes house
calls
&gt; if there is a problem,   but the cost is prime.  **** four star
&gt; mechanic...****** six star  costs!!!

Aewsome. Both are within driving distance of work. I'm trying to find a good
mechanic who can fix my oil leak problems (front &amp; rear seal appear to be
leaking, not head gasket), and since this will require a drop of the engine,
I'm preparing for the worst cost wise!!.


&gt; 
&gt; If you are in the Lehigh Valley give L&amp;T Enterprizes a try....great 
&gt; for parts,  used that is,  and  they have never screwed up {replaced 
&gt; my motor at 100K and the Tranny at 135K}  and their rates are super.
&gt; 610-264-9191.
&gt; *** three star mechanics, ** two star costs.
&gt; 

Thnaks for that one too John!!
