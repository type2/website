Subject: Reply to: Re: Signs of Waterpump Death

 &gt;&gt; I've had two water pump seals go in the last two summers and your
 description is exactly the results I experienced.  It seems these pumps
 are a real week link especially in hot climates. &lt;&lt;

 It took a lot of staring, but I finally caught the pump leaking out the weep
hole under the pulley shaft.  Thanks for the tip!
