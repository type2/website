Subject: Tug's starting update

The good news- Tug started on command all day.  The bad news- I know it'll
happen again until I find the problem.  The battery store guy tried his best
but had to declare all cells ok in the Diehard, voltage reading 13. 4, &amp;
lights, radio, fan plus several repeat starts didn't drain it.  The belts
have good tension &amp; looked healthy.  He suggested the flat spot on starter
idea.  OK, new starter, relay switch (? I've yet to find THAT in Bentley) or
???  Since I do pull on the steering wheel to come aboard the Tugboat, when I
jiggled wires &amp; connections on the steering column, could I have righted a
wrong?  I'm down to feet or my bike if I must leave Tug to be diagnosed, so I
still feel like a sponge soaking up ideas.    8)
