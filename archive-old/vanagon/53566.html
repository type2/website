I was quoted $1000 -$1200 earlier in the year and ended up spending about
$200 (if I'm remembering correctly) and two days to do it myself instead.
Not an impossible job, but not as easy as some make it sound either. There
is some great info in the archives about this, and you've got like a couple
hundred experts (not me though:-) at your call :-)

Good luck,

tony

&gt; 
&gt; My 91 Vanagon  blew its head gaskets today....
&gt; 
&gt; I first lost the waterpump/alternator belt on the Hi-way.
&gt; After replace the belts, I forgot to replenish the unserviceable water
&gt; tank ..(all of the coolant was in the reserve tank and I thought it
&gt; would get sucked back into the football shaped one..
&gt; 
&gt; Well after 4miles on the new belts the oil alarm came on...the water
&gt; light too..lots of smoke...and a tow home...
&gt; 
&gt; I filled up the internal coolant tank at home and started it up....all
&gt; of the coolant comming out of the head gaskets....
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is the gaskets got burned up from the heat...I hope there is no
&gt; other internal damage...the oil dip stick is still at the same level...
&gt; 
&gt; Does any one know the cost of new head gaskets ....
&gt; also if I bring it into a shop what is a usual cost to replace the
&gt; gaskets?
&gt; 
&gt; THANKS JOHN...
&gt; PS..something happens everytime at CHRISTMAS when Im on the way to
&gt; disney with my kids.
