Subject: Broke down in Poplar Bluff, Missouri

Hey Now,
Bertha the Wonderbus after hitting a couple of Furthur shows is on her way
home (Rainbow Gathering). Only about 2 hours from home, she blows a
manifold exhaust gasket. Lost one stud and now very loud. Songie and her
companions are stranded for a day or so until the gaskets get shipped in.
	They are all in good spirits and if anyone is headed to the
gathering and are in the area, please stop by and say hello. I think they
are staying at the lovely Tower Motel. You can't miss Bertha, a 78
Westfalia with lots of character. She would be very GRA8FUL. 
	
By Direction
Larry
