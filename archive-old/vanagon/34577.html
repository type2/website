Subject: RE: Sagging suspension ??


&gt;        In  my initial  walk-around,  I noticed the rear seemed to be
&gt;sitting lower than  other buses I've seen. Does anyone know what the
&gt;clearance between the top of the tire and the top of the wheel
&gt;well should be (front and rear)  in '71 era buses? Is rebuilding the
&gt;suspension  a major undertaking?

Mine sags too (the bus's rear end, not my own personal...), but doesn't
present any clearance problems. The rear torsion bars are adjustable,
but it's a pain to do, requires the right tools, and a pretty knowledgeble
person. Often takes multiple tries, I'm told, to get the height &quot;about 
right&quot;.

I've looked for air shocks, coil-over shocks, you name it, as a quick fix
to this problem. One list member runs a FLAPS, and said he found an
acceptable coil-over shock for the 68-71 rear. Has to be &quot;made to fit&quot;
with spacers, but when was the last time you found a large aftermarket
part that fit just right, first time?
