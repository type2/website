Ok...the challenge is on....the great Vanagon telethon...lets save
those remaining Unknowns out there...send in a pledge of your
address, hell even make one up! Just keep Joel busy, lord knows
he needs the work!

If you are on the list, or have already sent in a false location, get
a friend to send in a location....in fact have a friend send in a
location for a T3 Double-cab synchro pick-up...that otta send
Joel into hyperwarp!!

;-)

All in good fun...

Ric
