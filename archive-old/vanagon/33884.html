&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;        Ok, so rear hubs are get-off-able, now I'm having problems with
&gt;the front
&gt;ones - how do you get the cover/seal thing in the centre of the hub off? (not
&gt;the chrome hub-cap, the thing inside in the middle - sorry, I don't know what
&gt;it's called). Muir says use screwdriver and hammer, but mine isn't budging. It
&gt;doesn't even look like a separate thing! Am I trying to do something stupid?

I use a big pair of pliers and rock it out a bit at a time.  I never
could figure out the screwdriver thing.  My Clymer manual calls it
the &quot;grease cup&quot; and says that &quot;VW tool 637&quot; is handy.  Gee thanks.
The left hand cap (even in RHD buses, I think) has the speedo
cable with a cotter pin (Brit:  split pin ?) so take that off first.

'62's are the best!
