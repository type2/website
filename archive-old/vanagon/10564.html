&gt; Perhaps someone on this list can help me out with this.  Whenever,

&gt; with high humidity, the sliding door on the van seals itself shut.
&gt; No amount of coaxing with free it.  The rear portion of the latch
&gt; releases but that is it.  I think that the rubber seals may be
&gt; adhereing (sp?) together and was thinking of maybe putting on a thin
&gt; film of vaseline.  Any ideas or solutions would be appreciated.

First word of advice, Be Gentle!!!
Coming back from a week in the sun to a minus 30 degrees Toronto, I
went to my van in the Airport parking and tried to open the sliding door.
It was frozen shut, I had a 95 pound bag on my shoulder and a 50 pound
suitcase in my other hand both of which I wanted to set down in the van
as soon as possible.  I pulled harder. The handle snapped off in my hand.

I dropped my bags in the snow, got in the front door pushed the side door
open from the inside and was out about $80 for the new handle.

I don't think vaseline would be the way to go, since petroleum jelly
can eat away at rubber.  But I also don't know what would be a better
choice.
Perhaps, and I'm not joking, vegetable oil.  It might keep the ice layer
from building between the door and seal.
In fact, thanks for bringing it up, I think I'll try it.


Cheers
