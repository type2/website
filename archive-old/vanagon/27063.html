FWIW, here in the Bay Area I paid $8300 for an '89 Syncro GL *NON*Westfalia
with 91K miles, and I think the bank said the mid-Kelley book was around $9000.
So I felt I got a pretty good deal (we'll see how much I have to put into it.)
The POV had saved the original window sticker which showed all the bullsh*t
charges and markups from the dealer, including power everything - over $26,000
new.

Coincidentally, a dealer north of San Francisco that I talked to a month ago
estimated that the '87 Syncro he had on the lot for $11,000 (!!) would have
been $18,000 if it had been a Westy (I don't know what the mileage was.)
