Subject:        Vanagon weights?

 Hi,
I'm trying to find some winter tires for my Transporter, I'm going to try to
keep the 16&quot; wheels, but it there are no 16&quot; tires that qualify as a light
truck tire that will come to the same rolling diameter as a 205R 14&quot;.  So,
off to the truck scales to weigh the Syncro.

Front = 1000 kg
Rear = 930 kg

This is with 70L of gasoline and 100L of Natural Gas.  The only thing
missing was the driver, the passenger (wife doesn't want to be weighed :) ),
and the boarder collie...

So, at this point I look at the tires that are on the truck 225 / 50 16&quot;
with a 620 kg maximum load at 44 psi.  The spare 225 / 60 16&quot; is rated at
730kg.

Doing the math 620*4 = 2480 kg.  So this give me  2480kg &gt; 1930 kg.  So, am
I wrong at assuming that the tires are OK for my Transporter?

The only think on my door is a tire diagram showing 205R 14&quot; tire pressures
and the paint/engine codes.

I did sneak a peak at a Westfalia parked in a parking lot, the 185R 14&quot;
Contenental Tires in it were rated at 800kg max load.  I'm assuming that a
Westfalia is heavier than my Transporter seeing how I don't driving with
everything and the kitchen sink (tee hee hee).

What are some of the weights of the Vanagons out there?   That I can compare
things too?

Thanks!!
