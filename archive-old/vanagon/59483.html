&gt; &gt;I realize Bosch is the preferred way to go with the Brazilian wires next

&gt; &gt;The cap and rotor sold by this store are made in Italy. Any comments on 
&gt; &gt;these would also be very much appreciated.

&gt; ----I used CTC wires and plugs on my Nissan about 5 years ago and had
&gt; problems.  My son's friend who is a mechanic, and my son, refuse to use
&gt; them. They sent me to a FLAP  specializing in engine rebuilds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
I too have had problems, but only with their cap &amp; rotors - they look 
like Bosch, but do not last near as long. I've always used Bosch 
wires on my VWs.
