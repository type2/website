Subject: Off-topic van trivia...

To paraphrase what the old Arizona highway construction signs used to
(still?) say...

Caution, First Warning:  Non-VW Content!
Caution, Second Warning:  Non-VW Content!
Caution, Third Warning:  Non-VW Content!

Still listening?

I got to thinking recently (I know what your thinking:  with what?)

Back when I was but a child, when the ground was still warm to the touch,
my dad got me into vans by buying  a 61 Ford Econoline (we renamed it
&quot;econolemon&quot;, which was more descriptive).  Then a 62, then ALMOST a really
nice 23-window 63 bus!, then a 66 Dodge.
Ford had a solid body, but was lousy mechanically.
Dodge was solid mechanically (that bullet-proof slant-6!), but rattled to
pieces.
Wish we'd bought the bus...

Anyway, I liked vans since a little kid, cause you could CAMP easily in
them.  So I started looking for them in all their varieties...

Anyone ever see a Willys 4x4 Forward Control Van???  Those of you from
California (and as old as dirt, like myself!) may remember that CalTrans
used to drive Willys FC pickups, both single and crew-cab versions back in
the 60's.  But, I actually SAW 2 (count em, two) Willys vans around 69-71
time frame (I remember, because that's when I got into old cars and bought
my Model A).  One was clearly a military vehicle - army green and all.  The
other was a private thing - BRIGHT RED (not fire truck, that I could tell,
though).  Both were rather large - Willys FC pickups came as FC-100,
FC-150, and FC-170s, indicating the approximate wheelbase.  The vans I saw
were probably 150s.  I haven't ever seen any others, and haven't seen a
pickup in at least 5 years (half apart in the junkyard), but I'd almost go
out of my way to find one to restore.

Just thought I'd see if anyone else had seen/heard of these.  They were
pretty neat, and with 4X4, they'd be great for camping!

I now return control of your e-mail to you...
