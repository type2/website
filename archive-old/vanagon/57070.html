_______________________________________________________

Hello group:
Scenario: 86 VW Vanagon with surging of idle from normal up to 3,000 rpm,
intervals in the shop around every five seconds.  New idle speed motor
(VDO). Throttle position switch adjusted to closed at idle, closed at wide
open throttle.  No false air leaks detected and when it came in, the O2
sensor was disconnected.  Cleaned up the O2 harness' and made sure the
throttle sensor was ok...the throttle sensor needed a little tweaking to
close properly and we figured that was the problem, but once the idle speed
motor is connected it starts it's little surge dance once again.  Coolant
sensor was connected and wiring harness appears intact.
Customer had to leave immediately for the airport so we bumped up the bypass
screw (base idle) and disconnected the IAC as temporary measure.
So...no time to go into further diagnositics...any ideas of where to look
next? I see something in my 'runs funny book' about an updated harness for
the air flow meter, but I think those are for the air cooled transporters.
Thanks group!
