Subject:      Battery Size??

We drained the battery on this weekend's camping trip (Silent Lake
Provincial Park - very pretty) after only a few hours of using the tape
deck and interior lights).  This was the first time this has happened, even
though it has been through much heavier use.

After a boost to get us going,  we took it into a local mechanic who put it
on a load tester, and confirmed that the alternator was charging fine, but
the &quot;battery was gone&quot;.

The VW orignal battery read 500 amp cranking power.  We tried fitting an
850 amp aftermarket in, and with a lot of squeezing and bending of the
metal lip on the well, it did just go in, but the top terminals were too high.

VW dealer say the replacement is a 650 amp VW original.

Can anyone advise of a higher output unit that fits in the well.  Also, did
we really have to unbolt and remove that passenger seat?  It seemed the
only way to get full access to the well.

Thanks
