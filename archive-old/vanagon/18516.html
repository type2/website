Subject: Initial GNATT report

The GNATTers should be camped by now at the South Dakota Badlands, tho' sad
to say the numbers have dwindled to only Pete Sellers &amp; his SO Rose, and
David Schwarze &amp; SO Shelley.

Joel Walker, whose Vanagon looks just like you'd imagined (that is to say
immaculate and very well appointed with nifty gadgetry), drove along as far
as Davenport, Iowa on Monday, then headed back to 'Bama.  Gerry, Laura, Arlo
&amp; Dylan Skerbitz went on back to St. Paul yesterday, along with Sami &amp; Maria
Dahklia (driving their beautiful '75 Westy).  Because of a chaotic homelife
right now, I only joined up for a day myself, driving from Ackworth to
Muscatine, where I met the gang.  We then took a meandering 200 mile trek up
along the Mississippi.  

It was fun.  We compared Busses, computers, philosophies of life, we ate all
sorts of garbage-type foods (including S'mores around the campfire Mon.
night) and generally enjoyed each others company.  The reactions to our
little caravan were interesting.  A bunch of bikers thought we were great,
one catcall of &quot;Hippies!&quot; from a lone biker, and one guy who was admiring
our &quot;hippie vans&quot;.
The stares that 3 Busses, 1 Vanagon &amp; a Eurovan got as we drove through
small towns were fun--it would have been hard not to grin and feel as though
you were one of the elect.  I might add that northeastern Iowa (we camped at
Decorah) is very hilly.  We're talking grades.  Long, steep grades.  I've
known for a long time that Iowa was not flat, but NE Iowa is emphatically
not flat.  Just ask Frau Blucher (the oldest Bus on our run, and at 283,000
the one with the highest miles) whose faithful 1600 hasn't worked so hard in
years.  BTW, I'd never seen a Safare like Da Boat (Schwarze's), but saw
another one that was absolutely identical in Marshalltown, Iowa as I was
heading home.  Invasion?

There will be photos, to be sure, scanned in sooner or later.

Fine fare.  I'd like to do it again, only for a longer stretch.
