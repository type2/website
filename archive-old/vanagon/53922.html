&gt;
&gt;Is there any preventative maintenance to stop one getting nervous and
&gt;always looking at the temp gauge?
Change the coolant once a year (if at all possible, two might be OK), and 
use the blue (Autobahn) stuff.
This should help stave off the corroding of the head gaskets (and heads).

That's my two cents.

(or we could go back to breadloafs, but not me--up here with 0 degree 
temps!)
