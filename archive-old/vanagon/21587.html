Subject: Tire question again

I have received many responses to my tire question. I have an 82 Vanagon 
and I need two new front tires. I currently have 2ply poly and 2 ply 
steel on the front now but they are way worn. I bought the van 5 months 
ago and have been putting off getting new tires till now. 

QUESTION: Can I put passenger tires on it that are 4 ply? Or do I need to 
get reinforced tires?

Answer: About half said no problem with the passenger tires and half said 
are you crazy to even consider it. 

HELP:   What should I do? I believe the tires on it now are 4ply 
passenger tires. 195X75 14.

Appreciate the help

Jared

82 Vanagon
