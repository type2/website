&gt; A follow up on this - Pertains to Vanagons (at least, maybe the &quot;lofs too)
&gt; that have the middle seat, with the handrail on it's back.
&gt; 
&gt; Some friends in the neighborhood, in their vanagon, had an accident that
&gt; wasn't too serious, except the son in the middle of the third seat
&gt; &quot;flopped&quot;forward from the waist, restrained by his lap belt but smashed his
&gt; face into the hand rail.  He has some significant facial injuries/broken
&gt; bones.
&gt; 
&gt; I removed the handrail from the back of my middle seat.

Smart man.  The same thing happened to my sister when she was little.
She cracked her skull - very nasty.
