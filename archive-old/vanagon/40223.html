Subject: Help... I need a westy....

Fellow Listees...
	
	I have an urgent request for a Westy (weekender or full camper)
	
	young man (internet impaired friend) is looking a late '70s to 
early '80s Westy to travel from here to CA and back over the next 3 
months... price is not as important as getting a Very Reliable 
Vehicle... price is still important tho... looking for something under 
$3000... I know this is asking alot but he is a good kid... and he 
really Loves VWs....
willing to travel( within reason)'bout anywhere within 1000 miles of 
NH...must be a pop-top... 
	
		JonR
		I hope we find one close for my sake...
