Subject: window winder thingio

     Greetings Vdubbers - can anyone help with a frustrating problem?
     It goes like this - my '78 van has the window winder mechanism missing 
     from the driver's side door so I go and purchase the mechanism which 
     is indeed an ingenious device.
     However, after a frustrating Saturday afternoon I can't work out how 
     to fit it as the actual bit that the winder handle screws onto appears 
     to have to go through a gap between the window glass channel and a 
     recessed bulge in the inner door - it won't go through.
     I ended up trying to take the mechanism to pieces and ruined it so I 
     have to buy another one now.
     I can't find any reference to this problem in Muir or other manuals. 
     Has anyone any hints, tips or comments etc - I would be very grateful.
     
     Happy Friday - Cheers.
