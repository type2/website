Martha -

We'll sign up for a Chinese Chicken salad (the type that has ramen 
noodles in it) for the Asian culinary theme.  Which night is this 
planned for (Saturday?), what is proposed for the other night.

Remember, there is a 9 vehicle limit for parking.

We plan on going up Friday morning to get things open, warm, setup, 
get driveway plowed, etc.  When do you think people will start arriving?

Anybody with small kid(s)? (to set aside bedroom with additional bed)
Anybody with really tiny kid? (to set aside main bedroom with floor 
space for portacrib)
Otherwise my SO &amp; I will stake out main bedroom, and let you others 
decide on other separate bedroom.

Anybody indicate a desire to camp in their bus? (to bring adequate 
extension cords, if desired)

Did a reconnaissance mission to the cabin, well actually we had 
Christmas up there.  Couple of things to report.  The hot tub/spa 
is terminally dead.  We've been limping it along for a couple of 
years now, and it gets sold off this summer and replaced (can't rely 
on it to keep running unattended in the winter).

For the snowboarders out there, Alpine Meadows finally relented and 
is allowing snowboards.  The Alpine Meadows bus goes by the cabin 
on way to backside of Alpine, so easy access (no driving).  Can get 
tickets on bus.

With all the rain we've had, there may not be much snow left.  We had 
about 8 feet, until the rains came.  Let's hope for snow in the mountains 
and no rain in the valley, they've had enough.

Highway 89 from Truckee to Tahoe City had it's share of water damage 
and should be back in shape by the time of the trip.

Directions to the cabin -
Highway 80 to Truckee
Highway 89 to Tahoe City (about 12 miles)
Traffic on this road can be terrible, Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows 
ski areas are off this road.  Timing travels along 89 to avoid the 
9-10 and 3-4 o'clock periods help.  Be prepared to crawl.  Oh, this 
applies to Saturday and Sundays, Friday arrivals should have no 
problems.

At Tahoe City, keep in the right lane and follow highway 89 south.
Caution there is a stop sign there at the corner, just before the 
bridge over the Truckee river as it exits Tahoe. (Tour guide stuff)
You're travelling along the west shore of Lake Tahoe, going south.
Continue along 89 for about 3 miles.  You will leave Tahoe City and 
eventually enter the Sunnyside area (stores, Sunnyside Lodge, etc.)
Just past the Lodge, on the right, will be Pineland Road.
On both sides of Pineland Road are tall (20 ft) square posts, with the 
word *PINELAND* carved into them vertically.  Turn right onto this 
road.  First real road after Sunnyside.

About 1/2 mile up the road will start a slight right turn.
USE CAUTION IN THIS AREA.  All drivers coming to this corner have 
poor visibility.  Follow the main road, which will turn slightly 
right and then much more to the left, follow to the left.  The road 
continues a little and swings around to the right, another place of 
limitied visibility.  Whew.  Another 1/2 mile up this road to 855 
Ward Creek Blvd. That short stretch between curves was Twin Peaks, 
(more travel guide stuff, as the signs will probably be covered)

I'll place something on my vehicle to indicate the spot for the 
CCC's.  Park on either side of the road.  Backing in eases getting out.
I may or may not have my Vanagon, depends on the weather
good weather = Vanagon
bad = Subaru 4WD, SO's insistance (we rolled a bus in the snow one 
time, so understandable)

Special instructions for anyone traveling from the Southeastern 
direction (Kath &amp; Mark?).  Highway 89 in the southern end of the west 
side on the Lake is closed for the season, as usual.
Getting to South Shore on Highway 50, and then up along the lake is 
out of the question.  Will need to go to Reno then to Truckee or other 
way of avoiding South Shore.

- Jeff
