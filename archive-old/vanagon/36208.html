Subject:       '57 Mystery Deepens!

Saturday was a nice day here in Utah, so I decided to wash and drive 
the Pioneer.  She was happy to have a bath, and have the various 
fragments of her sun-roof fabric tucked back inside her.

I decided that it was again time to get a CD player for her (my 
previous bus had one), so I was straightening out the current wiring 
under the seats to the rear of the bus, and I discovered something!

To add insanity to confustion, stamped in the wall that divides the 
front bench from the rest of the bus, was the number: 299416.

Is this the manufacturing number?  

Remember the weirdness I am experiencing with this thing.  The 
title says '57, but the little id plate screwed into the engine 
compartment seems to indicate a '58 (Id number 325192)

So, is the ID number on the tag supposed to match the number on the 
bulk-head wall?

Help the Pioneer... She's fallen and she can't get up!
