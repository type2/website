Subject: Re: VW Stuff

You are probably already aware of this, but in case you aren't ...

I've heard that VW is sponsoring the European leg of the Rolling
Stones' &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; world tour.  Most of the dates are next
summer, I believe.

Unfortunately, I can't recall the source.  A post to 
alt.rock-n-roll.stones should get you a quick source if you need
one, though.
