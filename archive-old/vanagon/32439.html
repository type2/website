Subject: Re: Taller tranny for Vanagon (was: a snowy day)

I thought about the same idea!  My diesel westy is a slug.  Would bigger 
tires i.e. taller, give me even 1 m.p.h. more?  Where are those 
volkswagen wisemen?

&gt; I know its not the same thing, but can you go with bigger tires (outside
&gt; diameter) to get the desired effect -- less RPM's at highway speed.
&gt; Yeah, that long hill that I can hold at 50 mph in 4th would probably
&gt; now need to be ascended in 3rd, but my 3rd gear would be taller too.
&gt; 
&gt; What sort of performance do you folks get that are using oversize tires
&gt; on your vanagon?  Increased highway mpg?
