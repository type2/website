Subject: '87 igniton/starting problem update + a tip

Volks Folks,

First, a big thanks to all who replied with suggestions.

Since I had nothing to do this mornig I decided to go exploring underneath
the Vanagon.  First thing I spotted out of the ordinary was the rubber boot
over the electrical terminal on the starter was off.  AH HA!!  This will
promote a dirty connection!  To be safe I disconnected the battery the
removed the nut on the terminal.  I took some 400 girt sandpaper and cleaned
everything up then reattached the nut, put the boot in its proper location,
and reconnected the battery.  Viola!!  the bus started up the first time.

My tip of the day is:  Before you go out and work on your vehicle put on a
BUNCH of hand lotion...all the way up your arms.  You wouldn't believe how
much easier it is to clean up afterwards.

-Dan
