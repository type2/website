&gt;         Has any of you found a source for side window screens for NON-
&gt; camper EV's?  VW doesn't have them, but I seem to recall a place out
&gt; in Oregon that made them. ANyone know anything about this?

Auto vs. manual?  Dunno...  Don't rememberif Dan;s is old enough to have 
a real transmission - we don't - weenie auto.

&gt;         BTW: How does Dan Hebert get 22.5 mpg on his much heavier camper
&gt; while we can never break 21 on our MV? Is it engine timing? Tires? Richness
&gt; of fuel/air mixture? Any thoughts?  We usually get 14-15  around town in the
&gt; winter, 16-17 in the summer. How does these figure square with all of you?

You must be in a area with little A/C use &lt;grin&gt;  We get anywhere from 16 
to 19+ haven't reached 20 much.  A/C use kills us.  We live in a land of 
double 90s.  90 degree F and 90 % humidity over much of the summer.  
Pretty nasty area.  With the EV for some reason having the side windows 
open while driving sets up a nasty thumping of the inside air.  Hard on 
the ole eardrums.  Means the wimpy kids in the back whine about A/C when 
I won;t let them keep the windows open &lt;grin&gt;  Front windows are fine but 
sure wish they had the vent windows like older cars &lt;pout&gt;
