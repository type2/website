&gt; Someone previously posted information about the location/function of the low

&gt; schematics do not show this resistor.  Does anyone know if this resistor is
&gt; only used in some years or just not shown in the Bentley?

Vic,

Just did one about a month ago.  It is located behind your left
headlight.  You will need to pop the grill off and then remove the
headlight to get to it.  It is held in by a retaining clip that goes
into the holes on either end.  The hardest part was unplugging the old
one (ended up cutting away the plastic on the old resister electrical
connector).

This is a 15 minute job.
