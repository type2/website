Subject: Help a leaking '73

A while ago I had a problem with a lot of water appearing in my
oil due to condensation (thanks Bob, Joel). I guess that due to
the quantity of oily water in the crank, this blew a seal or 2.
Before the engine was out of the van the oil appeared to come from
the rear of the engine. St Muir suggests this would be a leaky oil
cooler, right?

Now the engine is out and the fan housing is removed, I am stuck and
require help. The oil cooler does appear to have a certain amount of
oil upon it, but there is a lot of oil above the level of the cooler.

Could this have originated from the cooler and got spread merrily
be the fan? or is there a seal lurking around on this end of the 
crankshaft, where the fan joins it?

This is the first time that I have removed this or any engine and
it would not have been done at all without the help of St Muir
and a lot of trolling through the archives. I definitely would
advocate that removing the engine is not done alone in the rain
in the dark, next time (what next time?) I will find some unlucky 
helper and be indoors :)

Could any replies be cc'ed to me as I'm in digest mode at the moment.

Thanks for any help.
