I came across a &quot;new&quot; parts source here in Sacrament. 

The primarily deal in engine stuff, but they have tons and tons of various
bug pieces.

I got some engine tin and various bits and pieces for $15.

The place is 
VW Pieces and Parts 
(916) 344-8989
3500 Q Street
North Highlands

The guy working there was a VW FANATIC!  Spinning wonderful tales of 
&quot;4 wheeling&quot; his rabbit to off road fishing spots.  Quite a character, long
hair in apony tail, huge bushy reddish beard, and just the most animated
old fart you will ever meet.

I don't have any connection to this place, but I liked them and I see them
as a good source of hard to get stuff.
