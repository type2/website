&gt; I have ordered a Bentley so that I can take my 87 Westy apart in order to
&gt; plug up the vents at the source.  I would love it, if you come up with a
&gt; simpler solution.  Jim McCarthy

Sheesh, you guys are doing it the hard way :-) !  Simply remove the
upper grille and locate the ventilation air intake (covered with a black
plastic mesh screen) and put duct tape over it!  Works wonders :-)
