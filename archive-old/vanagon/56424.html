Subject: 80 vanagon gremlin exorcised-finally!!!!

        Since early Jan. I've tried to get my van running for more than
20-50 miles at a time. I posted 7-10 requests for ideas and got a plethora
of responses. Many were very informative and helpful. For all of you that
responded thank you very much.
         What I found was:
                                         1) corroded contacts on the
starter solenoid, altenator plug,

                                             key/started module on steering
column.
                                         2) afm wiper contact plate badly worn.
                                         3) ignition coil wasn't working
correctly.
                                         4) air flow intake boot had lots
of small cracks that weren't
                                             appearent till it was warmed.
                                        5)  a failed cylindar head temp sensor.
                                        6)  another failed cylindar head
temp sensor.
        The last element to this exorcism was rechecking  #6 above- I
couldn't believe it two bad temp sensors- I was so certain it couldn't be
the temp sensor because I had just replaced it. I should have listened to
Tonya Pope's advice to recheck it but I was so certain (STUBBORN)  it
couldn't be the t. sensor. well enough already.
                Anyway a greatful thank you to everybody who offered help.

next a tranny replacement on my 84' waterboxer.
