&gt; 	Hi All :
&gt; I've just sandblasted and primed my bumpers, but before I reassemble them,
&gt; I'd like to try and find some replacement rubbers (the up and down type)
&gt; for them. The old ones, which have three implanted bolts, were too
&gt; corroded to save, and I'll only be able to use them if I can find nothing
&gt; else... My bus is a '72 by the way. Neither Parts Place, not West Coast
&gt; Metric has them available. Does anyone know of a source???

       It  is  the  center  part  of  it?
       Or  it is  the  step  on  the  side?
