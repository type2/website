Subject: Re: Vanagon Awning

I keep getting mail on these awnings!

OK. I will answer a couple.

The awning manufacturers recomend the 8 foot length for the Vanagon but in my
opinion this is stilly. They have in mind that the awning should extend only
to the front of the sliding door opening. I much prefer to have the awning
extend the full length of the vehicle, hence my choice of a length
approximating 10 foot length. 

One more point, it is important to paint your awning the approximate color of
your van. Otherwise it sticks out and looks ugly. 

Buying an awning is like buying Volkswagen parts for your Vanagon. Noone
wants to help you. The people you buy the parts from resent you. The
information they give you is incomplete or wrong. You have to bust your butt
a little to find out the real scoop. Don't trust what anybody tells you.
Insist on getting the manufacturers fullest and longest and most thorough
broschure, do the research yourself.
