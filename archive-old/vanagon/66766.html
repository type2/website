Hi Volks,

Gotta make room in the garage and raise some $$ to finish the '60 Westy =
resto. Make offer on any of the stuff below.

1) semi-auto tranny for '68 and up beetle, complete and in perfect =
condition
2) various 40hp engine parts - inquire
3) stale air heater boxes and bus muffler from a 40hp, surface rust but =
no holes and tight. used ealier this year and they don't leak!
4) '85 vanagon wasserboxer 1.9L longblock in need of head gaskets but =
otherwise good
5) auto tranny from '85 vanagon wasserboxer in good shape
6) vanagon front chrome bumper in good shape with square hella fog =
lights and stock vw fog light switch.
7) rear hatch screen for vanagon made by triad

That's all I can think of for now but there will probably be an addendum =
sometime later :-)
