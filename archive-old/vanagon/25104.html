Subject: Net Classified Listing Sources

eugp_at_uclink3.berkeley_dot_edu was looking for net classified sources:


85 flawless campervan  stk#250292A  $7999. obo (602)949-7600 PHX,AZ

87 camper GL with a/c stk#8p0361 $10,900 (602)949-7600 dealer PHX,AZ

BTW: Try a search under &quot;AutoTrader&quot; or &quot;Recycler&quot; which are two classifieds
on the WEST coast but have US maps which allow selection of the desired
continental US State. The &quot;pictures&quot; source has some VWs. Try searching
under the name of your local newspaper or &quot;under ground&quot; paper name e.g. New
Times Weekly, Berkley Free Press, The Village Voice or what ever these rags
evolved into. (I'm showing my age). The Arizona Republic is on-line under
&quot;Phoenix Newspapers&quot; I found several sources by just searching under
&quot;newspapers&quot; and &quot;classifieds.&quot;

I would seriously join NEATO for the newsletter. Many list members would
agree. Besides the newsletter occasionally has some enlightening yet
sacreligious cartoons submitted by some wiseguy in Arizona...
