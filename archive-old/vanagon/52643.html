&gt;    working.

     Each line on the window is wired in parrallel. If only 1 works,
     your problem is the others have areas that are broken, (no longer
     making a connection). It can be fixed with a special paint that
     conducts electricity. It is very expensive. Last I bought it,
     it cost $7 / .1 ounce. But you don't need much.
