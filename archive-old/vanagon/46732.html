Subject: 84 Hatch Openers

From: estevens_at_dolphin.upenn_dot_edu

The rear hatch struts on my '84 Wolfsburg Westie GL are shot.  Have been 
shot since I bought it but the PO had a plastic spring bar attached to 
one of the openers (an OE set of Stabillis) that kept the hatch open.  
Unfortunately a helper shut the hatch without moving the plastic piece 
and it broke.

PO was in Florida, west of Orlando, when he got the plastic piece that 
extended the useful life of the original hatch openers.  I cannot find a 
suitable replacement anywhere.  Anyone have a source for this piece which 
bolts onto the metal rod and has a 5 inch plastic piece that you press 
against the rod and lower the hatch until the top piece of the hatch 
opener is stopped.  Should sell for less that $10.

Assuming that I may not get a chance at the cheap fix I have priced new 
hatch openers and I would like some sage advise based on the following 
options

VW Stabillis at Camelback AZ 1 yr warranty$41.85 X 2, no tax, $5 ship = 88.70
Strong Arms at local VW shop, 6 mo. warranty	$39.95 X 2, 6% tax = 84.69
Monroe at FLAPS	, 2 yr warranty		$28.75 X 2, 6% tax= 60.95

Any reason not to do the Monroe which I understand are gas openers with 
the longest warranty?   Seems like a slam dunk unless someone got burned.
