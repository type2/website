Date: Mon, 27 Feb 1995 18:21:11 -0600 (CST)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;At the Palo Alto swapmeet Yesterday .I got myself a good working ebersparker.
&gt; &gt;But there is a problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The westie has a spare wheel well just where the heater is meant to go.  Does
&gt; &gt;one just cut away at the bottom of the spare wheel well
&gt; 
&gt; 
I sure would love to figure out why my factory gas heater on my diesel Vanagon 
(83) refuses to pump fuel into the heater....

it cycles nicely...but does not pump any fuel...that guy in Colorado is a jerk
I won't do business with him....
