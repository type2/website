Subject: Correct Weber jetting

To the List,

I was wondering if anybody knows the correct primary and secondary 
jet sizes for a Weber DFAV to run on a 1.7 liter engine.  I have finished the rebuild 
and can't seem to get the engine tuned correctely.  When the timing 
is set correctly for the 009 distributor(12-14degrees BTDC), I cant get the idle speed 
to come below 1500rpm without totally leaning the idle mixture down 
util the engine almost dies.  The jets that are in the Weber DVAV are 
60 for the primary and 50 for the secondary.  The primary may be a 
50, but it was hard to read the first letter on the jet.

Thanks,

Aaron
