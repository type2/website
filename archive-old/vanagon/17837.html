Subject: How Rain-X works
Date: Thu, 18 May 95 10:50:30 PDT

Yep, I use it.  Yep, the wipers skip and rub and judder on occasion.  Here's why

Rain-x is an anti-wetting agent.  It causes the water to not film at all on 
the glass.  With no binding to the surface the water beads and rolls off very
easily.  That's the good part.

How wipers work.  The rubber will grab a non wetted surface.  The wipers are
lubricated by a microscopic film of water so they slide over the surface
without grabbing.  Now when Rain-X doesn't allow the film to exist the wipers
if they're new will grab the dry glass (microscopically dry) and skip and
judder.  So try using old wipers that don't work well on non Rain-X'd glass
and you'll have the best match.  

For a sly trick rain-x a friends car but only the driver's side.  His SO will
be terrified to ride in the rain in the passenger seat as the visibility is
awful while the driver can see just fine.
