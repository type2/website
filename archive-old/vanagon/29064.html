Subject: Re: '79 Bus emissions controller


&gt;A couple of questions arise out of this little dilemma:
&gt;1. Is 8 weeks a reasonable time for a Bus to be tied up at a mechanic? (It's
&gt;a VW specialist, but not very large.) Should I be getting antsy?
&gt;
&gt;PJL

8 weeks is unreasonable.  My experience with 7 engine transplants, and also
running a business of my own, is that difficult (or less profitable) jobs
tend to sit on the shop floor or in the back lot until the customer
squawks, due to competing jobs and limited resources.  I keep the pressure
on a weekly basis, but in a friendly way.  Good luck.
