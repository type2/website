Subject: Re: luggage rack / sunroof??

&gt;
&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Someone inquired as to the nature of my rooftop storage.  My 76 (and most 
&gt;68-80 ???) have a psudeo-lugage rack on the roof above the driver and 
&gt;passenger seats.  Actually, it is a slight (about 3-4 inches) depression 
&gt;in the turtle shell.  Also, it is level, unlike the rest of the shell.
&gt;
&gt;   Can anyone say if that luggage rack depression can be cut out
&gt;   by mere mortals and successfully have a sunroof of some kind
&gt;   grafted on there?? Even an extra 1.5&quot; of headroom would be
&gt;   welcome! And a little breeze in the summer from above would
&gt;   be heaven!
&gt;
What about cutting out the fibreglass bottom, but leave enough of a lip to 
fit  hardwood slats to? With the FG out of the way get a standard glass lid 
sunroof installed for &lt;$300. Then put in the slats/wooden rack. Should be 
able to get enough height to open the sunroof one or two clicks. Add spacer 
blocks whatever. You'd get the inside 1.5&quot; height for sure. High curvature 
in breadloafs makes generic sunroofs leak, so get a brand/model rec. from 
the list. You can't graft a sheet of plexi into the FG cutout unless you 
seal the entire rack watertight to the roof tin.  tim s.
