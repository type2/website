Subject: Vanagon turbo-diesel


        Sorry for the delay in giving listmembers a description of
my conversion from stock 1.6 litre diesel to 1.6 litre turbo-diesel.

        A few weeks ago, my teenage daughter was driving home
from work in the wee hours and fell asleep at the wheel, while
crossing a bridge. She totalled our 85 Golf, but, thank the Lord,
she was not injured or killed.

        So.........my time has been consumed in readying another
vehicle in the driveway, so haven't had the time to write up the
conversion.  I haven't forgotten those who requested details, and
I will respond, as soon as time permits. Thanks for your patience.

        P S :  Anyone have a good Golf body for sale with a hatched
engine and/or tranny?
