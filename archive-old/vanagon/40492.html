Subject: FS: Type IV air-cooled short block

A guy at work just put a new motor in his '82 Vanagon.  He has the short 
block that was running in his bus before he swapped ina new motor.  He
said his old one had a bad ring, so the short block should be ok.
He said he'd like to get about $200 for it, includes the rods, no flywheel.
