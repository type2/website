&gt;&gt;&gt;The kit will give you a whopping extra 2311cc in capacity (to around 
&gt;19100cc
&gt;&gt;&gt;from memory) and is probably the biggest bang for buck you can get with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;1700.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;19,100cc's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     WOW!!!!!!!              I WANT ONE OF
&gt;&gt;THOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you imagine how fast the Westy would go with this?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Not very. The crankshaft would stand still, and the Westy would spin over 
&gt;and over very quickly.   :)

Reminds me of some of my mispent youth reading my dad's old Mechanix
Illustrated magazines.  I remember articles about people installing surplus
WWII airplane engines in various vehicles.  I think these were immense
Allison engines, but I could be mistaken.  Its been over twenty five years
since we threw these out. :(
