I love this list.  I have a major problem and am too embarased to mention
it because I attributed it to my supreme incompetence, and a week later it 
shows up on the list!!  Really makes a guy feel much better about himself to 
see others with the same problems.  CV Joints Anon. sound like the place for me.
 
I also had all six bolts fall out at a stoplight.  Clunk...whiirrrr...thump!
The &quot;thump&quot; was the sound of my heart impacting my bladder as I thought about
my transmission and which component could possibly fail in such a manner.

I've learned to be much more carefull with torques and locktite and such in
the future.

Motor on,

Albrecht
