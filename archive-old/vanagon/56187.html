Subject: Vanagon Hatch Trivia

 I just purchased new hatch lifts for my 89 Westy and was surprised that the
left and right sides are different part numbers (with wiper motor part nbrs)
Also, as I removed the old ones I noticed they are both built by Sta-Built,
but, the right support is called a &quot;hydro-lift&quot; and the left is called a
&quot;lift-o-mat&quot;. Both look the same - but the &quot;lift-o-mat&quot; feels weaker (both
the new one and the old). Should we be using two right supports? And does
anyone know what the difference between the two may be? Another Vanagon
mystery.
