&gt;He was wondering if it was possible to get a vanagon with nine seats.
&gt;I think not in the US market, but what about Europe or Canada?

the most i've ever seen was an 8-person vanagon: a split-bench in front
with no walk-through. BUT!!! if you had the same bus with the 3-person
middle seat, THAT would be a 9-person carrier.

but i don't THINK they sold that over here. but i'm not sure.

now, down in South Africa (so how come places &quot;below&quot; the equator are always
&quot;down&quot;??? what if the world is upside-down to begin with??), they sell the
buses as 10-seaters!! cause they put some &quot;seats&quot; over the engine. these
little &quot;jump seats&quot; face backwards, and the occupants can't get out by them-
selves (someone has to open the rear hatch from the outside) ... unless they
scamper over the 3rd seat. :)

Mercedes-Benz makes a model called an MB100, which is a front-engined bus
(looks a little like a Vanagon) that comes as a 9-seater. but then, they don't
sell it over here either.
