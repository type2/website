---------
Thanks for all the help from this list,I have found my vanagon, an 86
westy.Drove over to Greensboro NC with a friend and brought her home to
Makanda Illinois.The po was fellow list member Dave Richards,a great person
to do business with,he told me of every little scratch and problem right up
front.Dave is the proud owner of a new ev.He took me for a ride and gave me
a demo,his ev is a very very nice machine.
	The vanagon made the 650 miles home with no problems,my wife Jolene and I
just love it.We had morning coffee in it on the drive way early its first
day at its new home.Again thanks for all the help and I may ask the list
some dumb questions about maintainence as my previous vw experience is with
a 78 westy,I have much to learn.I have already found it to be a little
taller,just will fit through the 7ft door at its new home.
