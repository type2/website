Subject: Alcohol in gas


...  I read or heard that this could somehow contribute to water 
accumulation in fuel filter or elsewhere.  That seems counter intuitive to 
me because you can use alcohol to chase water out of a fuel system.

What happens is that when water is in the gas tank, water is the denser liquid 
and sinks to the bottom of the tank.  Alcohol is less dense than gasoline, and 
will combine with water (I think) therebye lifting the water on top of the 
gasoline, (or near the top).  This leads to the ethanol-water combination to 
be sucked into the fuel system, (not as good as ethanol-gas) and the choking, 
stuttering.
Alcohol is used as a solvent, (again relying on very distant memories of 
chemistry) because it will evaporate quickly, ergo not chase but combine and 
evaporate the water away.
Anyone can freely correct these concepts, since I haven't had any chemistry in 
nearly 10 years.
