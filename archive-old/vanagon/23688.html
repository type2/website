Subject:  pilot bearing r/r (more help!)

well...this post is as short as i could make it.  this weekend i became 
intimate with my van for the first time,  due to the fact that it would not go
into gear.  thanks to list folks i had determined that it was either the clutch
or pilot bearing.  ordered pilot bearing, engine seal, rear trans seal,
throwout bearing, and clutch and pressure plate and thought i'd do it all
at once if it needed it (since i just got the vehicle and don't know its
history).  got the stuff from the parts place...and some of it was even
what i had ordered!  wrong tranny seal, clutch plate.  in addition, they
had assured me on the phone that all were german in origin.  throwout
had 'made in brazil' stamped on it.  enough complaining, doesn't matter
now anyway.  took out the trans (easy enough) per haynes manual. 
sure enough - the pilot bearing was shot.  tried tim smiths technique (in
the archives) for removing it - it wouldn't budge.  didn't have an
acetylene torch to 'slag the bugger', so i had to fabricate vw special tool
#xxx, and make an extractor out of some all-thread, exhaust pipe, nuts,
washers, etc., and pull it out.  replaced pilot bearing and the seal, and the
clutch was hardly worn (compared it with the more expensive, but
correct new one at FLAPS) so i just put it back in to not be wasteful. 
checked endplay (procedure of st. muir was confusing, did it my own
way (not sure if it was correct),  would someone mind posting a good
method to do this with feeler gauges?)  by the time i realized the
throwout was brazilian, it was sunday, no FLAPS open.  i decided just to
put the old one back in since the other clutch parts were in good shape. 
refilled/replaced the trans (not quite as easily as taking it out &amp; i broke off
 the reverse switch contacts!)), checked the clutch - the pedal gives
proper resistance for a moment, then 'pop/snap' and it goes to the floor -
no resistance!  i check the slave, and it does not return all the way to its
compressed state.  no leaks in the hydraulic system.  made starter
contacts, spins flywheel freely.  i'm thinking that maybe we hit the arm
which activates the throwout bearing &amp; jarred the bearing off of its
mount when we put the trans in.  anyway, i didn't know what else to
check before taking the trans back out (plus i needed a break from being
under the vehicle for 2 days/20 trips to the hardware/parts store), &amp;
that's why i write this monday moring.  if you have any suggestions, they
would be extremely welcome.  i was going to go on (much
needed)vacation next week &lt;sob&gt;, we'll see...

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
