So thom fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; What was the problem?  When I put the new engine lid seal on, it started
&gt; pulling all the air thru the vents, instead of partially thru the
&gt; engine lid.   Well, the air thru the engine lid was _warm_, which alleviated
&gt; the icing problem!  By re-opening the hole in the tin, I started pulling hot
&gt; air from behind the muffler, and it stopped the icing!

Just remember to cover up the hole in the spring-time!  You don't want 
to have to get another engine *that* soon.
