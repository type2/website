So Matt Weatherford says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a cracked cylinder head and would like to solicit creative
&gt; uses for it.  So far, I have come up with:
&gt; 

Ash tray. (fashion a bottom)

Pot for plant. (&quot;)

Door stop.

Paper weight.

Desk decoration.

Make a candle.  (fill the interior with wax and a wick)

Send it to Bradley for proper disposal. ;)
