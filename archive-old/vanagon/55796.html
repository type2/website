&gt;&gt;  What is the third chair?
&gt;
&gt;In 1985, 86, &amp; 87 Camper GLs (perhaps other years) there was an optional
&gt;middle bucket seat that was placed behind the front passenger and faced
&gt;forward.  This option is quite rare - I saw my first one of these just last
&gt;week.

If it is the one with a swivel pedestal bolted to the floor, then it's the
optional 3rd bucket, but it may also be a rear facing jumpseat out of a '87
up wolfsburg ed, Carat, or Multivan model, that someone put in there behind
the pass seat. (IMO this is a better idea - easier to remove)
