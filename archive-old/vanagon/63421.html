Subject:      CA Smog Test - Engine ID Rule Changes

I've just received today a CC'd letter from the California Bureau of
Automotive Repair (BAR) addressed to Dean Kirsten, one of the editors of
Hot VWs Magazine in regards to the editorials published in the magazine a
couple of months back.  Thought it might be of benefit to both lists:

Dear Mr Kirsten.

This letter serves as a follow-up to my previous correspondence regarding
a staff review of the smog inspection procedures for Volkswagen vehicles
with engine changes.

As a result of the review, the Bureau instructed referee inspectors to
perform a complete inspection of these vehicles and to evaluate the
required emissions control systems and fuel induction systems on the
basis of chassis year, not the engine year.  In other words, engine case
numbers will not be used to determine if the vehicle passes or fails the
inspection.  Furthermore, the Bureau informed referee inspectors not to
fail a vehicle simply because the engine does not have a case number.

The new inspection policy applies to the following Volkswagens in need of
an engine change inspection:  Type-I (Beetle), Type-II (Bus), and
Type-III (Squareback and Notchback) models equipped with air cooled
engines.  Please be advised that the new policy does not apply to
Specially Constructed Vehicles (SPCNs).

I believe this new policy addresses your readers' concerns.

Sincerely,

L.G. Vann, Jr.,
Chief of Staff

Well, at least they addressed the air cooled community, but not the
wasserboxer.  By the way, when I tested my 84 Westy, they didn't even
bother to look for the engine number to determine the engine size.  They
just tested me under 1.9 standards for the 1984 year model.  In other
words, I kept my mouth shut, which is sometimes a good thing to do.
