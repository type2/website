Subject: Pray for me...

Well, I'm on my way out to remove the engine from my '81 Westie.  No big
deal for a lot of you, but it has taken me weeks to work up the nerve.

If all of you would pray for me/keep your fingers crossed/chant/cast
helpful spells/knock on wood/ or anything else you can think of doing, the
added good karma would be gratefully accepted.

Thanks for all the help and advice during the past weeks.  Now we'll find
out if I am a worthy vessel for this wisdom.

Bill
