Subject: Eurovan vs. Westy - some differences

&gt;IN the new Eurovan, the rear passenger seat is molded, which equates with
&gt;comfort for passengers riding, but does not create a great sleeping surface
&gt;(ridges and bumps). So what has Winnebago (Bag-a-Wino) done to rectify this
&gt;situation?
&gt;
&gt;There is a very thin (about 3/4 inch) mattress that unfolds from the back
&gt;area and *SNAPS TO THE SEAT AND BACK area* to attempt to flatten out the
&gt;ridges. I personally tried this out, and found it cumbersome, ungainly in
&gt;appearance, and extremely uncomfortable!
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps it might be good for someone who doesn't toss and turn, but with
&gt;about 8 small diameter snaps to snap the top mattress to the rear seat
&gt;bench, I have a feeling that this feature may not be popular with many
&gt;Volks. (The snaps are about the same diameter as on your rear hatch
&gt;screen.)
&gt;
&gt;Also, the rear area is &quot;slotted,&quot; ostensibly to allow moving larger sheets
&gt;of plywood, or furniture, so the &quot;top mattress&quot; covers this area and the
&gt;spacer piece that covers it. ...Seem to me --lots of pieces to get lost
&gt;over the years!
&gt;
&gt;The rear closet has a sliding door, which is a good thought, however, the
&gt;sliding door on the vehicle I examined was made of cheap mortarboard, (sort
&gt;of like thin wall panelling). It did not slide easliy, and looked as though
&gt;the last person had popped it out of its track.
&gt;
&gt;Way Prefer my 89 Westy!
&gt;
&gt;My 2 cents!

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; differences between the two some bad some good In all honesty I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; say the westie version camper is better thought out almost like one
&gt;&gt;&gt; designer went camping and the the other didnt...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        Could you give some examples?  I have to believe that the Winnebago
&gt;&gt;designers have done some camping.  Is it a difference between European and
&gt;&gt;American camping?  I keep hearing on this list that Westfalia conversions
&gt;&gt;are better than the Winnebago, but I haven't seen any specific examples.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanx.
