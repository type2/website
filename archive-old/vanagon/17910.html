Subject: AC Compressor for '85 Vanagon?

Has anyone on the list had to find a new AC Compressor for their Vanagon.  I
have had mine at the AC shop waiting for one since Tuesday and although they
say one has been located and is being shipped, I am beginning to doubt their
word.  Will only one kind of compressor work?  Is VWs method of mounting a
compressor that specific?
