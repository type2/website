&lt;&lt; Also, in replacing the rear speakers I just used a large screwdriver and

 Polk speakers of the same size that fit perfectly. &gt;&gt;


Hmmm, in my '88 Westy I can take the rear speakers out without removing the
ceiling cabinent. They must have made a mounting change.  But I was
considering the Polk speakers as well..

What is the largest speaker that people have fit in the door? I measured
the factory enclosure and it seems that you could easilly fit 5.25&quot; and
perhaps 6&quot; speakers in the front doors in place of the stock units.

What do people do to solve the weak bass ??
