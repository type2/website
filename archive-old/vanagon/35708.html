Rusty says,
I learned along time ago about politics, VWs, and life on the street. Jerry
is definitely a character, unlike any of the rest of us VW folk, &lt;  ;)  &gt;
but is really dedicated to the promotion of VW vehicles and their owners. He
trys real hard to help anyone in whatever reasonable manner that he can. If
anyone has any questions call Jerry or Melissa and talk to them directly.
They are very approachable folks.
