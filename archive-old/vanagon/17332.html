&gt;I have for sale a 1966, 21 window, ragtop microbus in fair shape.  I
&gt;am located in Huntsville, Alabama.  Please email response to
&gt;crg_at_iquest_dot_com.  The bus is partially disassembled but complete.
&gt;$1500. firm.

&gt;Hey, Joel...you know you want it! And the price is pretty good! &lt;g&gt;

ha! Bus in a Box?? :)  my pappy done showed me looooong ago: don't buy
no car what you can't drive home! (makes you look foolish when the
neighbors see you pushing that thing down the road!).

besides, (grumble, grumble), it's a 6-volt. probably not the right color.
lots of rust up there in Huntsville (it's near a river, you know).
&quot;fair shape&quot;?? probably means his dogs or pigs had a fair inside it.

gonna have to pass on this one. now, Dave Easterwood ... now THERE'S
someone who might be tempted! ;)
