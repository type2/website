Subject: A/C switch - Washer pump dead?

Hi all. After a long period ofjust skimming and running I have two
questions. One - is it possible feasible to switch the A/C units, the one
inside the vanagon on the ceiling, from an 87 or later with the one in my
86. Why, this rambling fool would like to get a little more space in back.
Also as I look at later Westies in my search for a possible replacement for
my 86 I like the look/ more space of the later of the later models. So...
thoughts on the conversion? Second, my front windshield washer pump is
meekly pushing out fluid. I have cleaned the jets, made sure the tank is
full. I replaced the pump about 7 months ago with a used one. Should I just
go new? Anything else to check? TIA
