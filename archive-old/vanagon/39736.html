&gt;Tim,
&gt;I'm on both the Corrado list and on the Vanagon list (can you see the
&gt;conflict in my life?). I just read that Dennis Haynes asked about a turbo
&gt;for the wasserboxer.  It would be great if *someone* developed one for the
&gt;Vanagons. I think the fanatics who own these vehichles would buy them by
&gt;the van-load.
&gt;
&gt;However, a more realistic point is that NO ONE has developed any
&gt;performance enhancing mods for the wasserboxer.  If ever there was a
&gt;vehicle that needed more power it's the Vanagon.  This is a completely
&gt;untapped market and if even modest hp gains were attainable (with bolt-ons
&gt;etc.) the demand would be over whelming.
&gt;
&gt;Just a thought...
&gt;
