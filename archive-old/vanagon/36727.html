&gt; Problem;  on the way to work, just about a half an hour ago, my EGR

	David,
	The EGR light (in all buses after 1975) automatically comes on 
every 15,000 miles as a reminder to check the Exhaust Valve 
Recirculation system. It does not mean you necessarily have a problem. 
If you just passed your smog test you are probably fine. To reset the 
EGR light (so it will go on in another 15,000 miles) reach around in 
back of the light and find the reset button. Push it and the light 
should go out...Nathan
