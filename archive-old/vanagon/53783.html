Hi Russell,

What did you do about the fan hookup? What model/make?

&gt;      Check the recent archives about this common Vanagon problem.  I went
&gt; with a jur-rigged fix that cost a fourth of what a new VW replacement
would
&gt; cost.  I used a heater core from another car that was almost the same
size
&gt; and it worked fine.
