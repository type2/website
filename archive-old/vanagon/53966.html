&gt;&gt; Another problem i have been experiencing since purchase about 1.5   
years ago
&gt;&gt; is the No-start symptoms.  This happens at any temperature, but more
&gt;&gt; frequently when it is cold outside.  I turn the key and all i hear is   
a
&gt;&gt; slight hum, which i think is the fuel pump.  Sometimes if i hold the   
key on
&gt;&gt; for awhile it will finally turn over and start.  If this doesn't work,
&gt;&gt; usually waiting 20 min or so will work.  The battery is fine, brand   
new.  Is
&gt;&gt; the solution the Ford solenoid?  where can i find the details on this?

Well, I had this same problem and I ended up replacing the starter.   
 Apparently what happens is that the starter motor turns, (thus the hum)   
but the binhex doesn't pull out to engage with the flywheel to turn the   
engine over.  One way to get the Vanagon going is to go under the van and   
while someone turns the key, hit the starter motor with a hammer until it   
engages.  A couple of weeks ago it was 9 degrees in upstate NY and I   
refused to go under the Van to start it.  I have no idea why the starters   
do that but that's how to solve it.
I bought a Bosch reman starter for $160 in my area and paid a mechanic   
for 2 hours work.  The dealer wanted $375 for a reman.

If you get a solution to the break problem, please share because I have   
the same exact problem.
