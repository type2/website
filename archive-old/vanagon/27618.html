We're meeting at Alice's Restaurant at the intersection of Highway
84 and Skyline.  84 is between 280 and 1.  That's at 2 p.m. tomorrow,
which is Saturday.  From there, we'll proceed to find a nearby camping
place.  Those who can't meet us there should phone 510.783.1194 (but
not until tomorrow) to get the update on where we'll be.  Same goes
for Sunday, although on Sunday we may split and be in more than one
location.

Above all, bring:

firewood
lawn chairs
beer or whatever you do
ice

Food:  I have stuff for Sunday breakfast, although someone is going to
have to cook it, because I am NOT a morning person.  For Saturday dinner,
bring whatever you want to BBQ, plus some side dish to share - like
salad, veggies, fruit, bread, dessert.  Please don't EVERYONE bring
dessert.  On second thought, I'll bring dessert as I may have suggested
before, so that this cannot happen.  :)

All other meals are on your own.  It's nice to bring snacks to share
with the group.

See you all tomorrow!  If you have CB's, please set them on channel 2.
That's TWO as in type-TWO, where hardly anyone else will be  :)

See you soon.  Dress warm....
