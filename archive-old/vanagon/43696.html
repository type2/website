Subject: RE: DIRT CHEAP in Pittsburgh./f


&gt;Help me out!   I bought two project Vanagons last year, intending to make
&gt;one good one out of them.  To make a long story short, my health has
&gt;deteriorated (diagnosed with MS), I bought a project house, and I have
&gt;no time or room for the Vanagons (my new garage is too low for a Westy).
&gt;
&gt;My loss is your gain!


Sorry you have to lose something so valuable, Dale...

so how much are you asking for the house?

  &quot;There are plenty of jobs to be had-- I have three of them myself!&quot;

P.S. After all... you can live in a Westy, but you can't drive a house!
