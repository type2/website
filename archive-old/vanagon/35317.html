&gt; Hey all
&gt; 
&gt; I think my weekend project this weekend is going to be to fix the
&gt; speedometer.  I will need help from you folks, tho.  Here's what I know
&gt; so far.  The speedometer does not function.  It does not register any
&gt; speed.  Also, odometer doesn't work (duh).  Anyway, I popped of the
&gt; left front hubcap to see if the cable end had worked itself out of the little
&gt; hole in the grease cap.  Well, it was still there, held in by the little circlip
&gt; and all.  So that part of it is turning.  This leads me to believe that the
&gt; problem is either with the cable or the speedometer itself.  First think I
&gt; want to check is the cable.  Sooo, how do I ge the sucker out?  I don't
&gt; want to guess at it, so I'd like it if someone could help me with that part of
&gt; things.  Also assuming the cable is in more than one piece, where can I
&gt; get a new one?  VW dealer?  Elsewhere?  OK, assume cable is OK, I put
&gt; it back in with new grease.  What kind of grease?
&gt; 
&gt; If the speedometer is broken I guess I'm gonna be out some cash any
&gt; way I look at it.  Anyway, if anybody can help me out with this I'd really
&gt; appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot in advance,
&gt; Sean
