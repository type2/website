Subject: Re: (ethanol) was: Gasoline Grade?

Jim says:
&gt; I'd
&gt;suggest backing down one grade from premium(R+M/2=92) and try a
&gt;midgrade(R+M/2=89).  Listen closely for pinging under hard accelleration,
&gt;like up a hill.  If you hear any, go back to premium.  If not, thry the
&gt;regular(R+M/2=87) grade and listen for pinging again.  

This raises another question....the mid-grade and high-grade gasolines, i.e.
R+M/2=89, 92 (at least here in Nebraska), are generally 10% ethanol. My
owners manual says to steer clear of alcohol blends. Why?
