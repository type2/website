Subject:      86-91 oil pressure switch

for those of you who have the pleasure of replacing your own oil pressure
switch, the high-pressure one, at the back of the engine ... it's helpful
to loosen the v-belt for the water pump. it allows you some more finger
room down there.

Bentley book says to &quot;bend&quot; the muffler shield ... ha! i was able to get
a little more room, by knocking a big dent in the shield ... the horizontal
part just behind where the pressure sender is. the shield sticks up just
enough to mess up the socket going in.

the weird thing is ... the sender is 24mm (and you'll need a deep socket),
but it's screwed into a &quot;sleeve&quot; that is screwed into the engine. and
the sleeve is 22mm. go figure. the sleeve may or may not come out with
the sender.

better figure at least TWICE the time you think it'll take. it's a bitch
getting the socket in there. you'll definitely need a &quot;wobble&quot; attachment
(the little thingie that looks like a universal joint).

i still can't see where the old one was leaking, but with the new one in,
there ain't no more oil leak back there. :)
