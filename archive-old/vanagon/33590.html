Oh! You mean we're supposed to be able to drive these
things?  I was under the impression we were just to keep
grinding and sanding and painting and welding and greasing
and cleaning and.....

On a side note, the campus I work on is celebrating its
centennial.  Part of the centennial effort is a restoration
of the &quot;premiere&quot; building on campus, a gothic-like castle
with marvelous ornate plaster low-bas relief decoration
which has been painted green, white, blue...you name it...
over the last 100 years.

The restoration team has as its first task to research the
proper original color schemes, document the entire job, and
restore a *part* of the plaster to original color schemes.
Knowing what the original was and looked like is the crux,
not restoring it to look exactly the same now.  One room,
the former ballroom, was done in a very strange green, so
strange that those who see the current sample tend to label
the plaster ladies in the ceiling &quot;swamp mermaids&quot;.
Obviously, in 1895 that green was the thing.  Now, however,
some changes are in order.

I very carefully restored my '67 Deluxe to Pearl White and
Velvet Green--I like the colors.  I'll probably repaint my
'67 Westy in Pearl White.  My '67 Double Cab....that's
another story.  I like the Dove Blue, but underneath it sure
looks like Turquoise, though the numbers say Velvet Green.
Time for more research, I guess.  BTW, if I use a solvent to
remove the paint-over of the sticker with original paint
numbers on it, will it also make the original lettering go
away?
