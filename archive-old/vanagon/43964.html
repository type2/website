Subject: Re: Can I replace a Solex 28 PICT with 30 PICT 2?

&gt;My 1961 40 hp SAE bus was converted to 12 volts by the P.O. As a result, I

&gt;and firetrucks which were converted to 12 volts, but no luck.  Now I 'm
&gt;wondering if I could use a spare 30 PICT 2 I have in the cellar. This has
&gt;the correct 12 volt element, and would seem to be a solution. But is it
&gt;realistic, or will other problems surface?
&gt;I do have a spacer plate which will allow the carb to fit the manifold.

Wolfsburg West has a 12 volt choke element for the 28 PICT carburetors. The
URL for Wolfsburg West is:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/free/wwest/./webdocs/./. I lent my catalogue to my
brother, so I can't give a part number or price. Another cool item WW has is
a 12 volt armature (the guts of the wiper motor) for the stock 6 volt wipers
- the wipers behave 'normally', and you don't have to install a volt-a-drop.

Hope this helps
