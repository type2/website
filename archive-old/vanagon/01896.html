Hello to all on this thread. I also keep seeing in EC a company called West 
Coast Metric, for H2O VWs, incl. Vanagon. They claim 'rubber products' 
mostly. Anyone dealt with them yet? It's time to do my leaky head gasket 
over, hence the question. What's the best deal anyone has seen for 
wasserboxer head gaskets, one side only not the full kit? BTW, for those 
suffering motor incontinence, this job can be done with the engine still in 
the car, with basic tools.    &quot;splish splash I was takin' a bath&quot;   tim s.
