Subject: low compression in #1

Well, I've been on the road for 6 weeks, and I just did a compression 
check on cylinder #1.  This check was prompted by noticably less power 
than usual last night and this morning.  Prior to checking the 
compression, I replaced the spark plugs hoping that this would solve a 
problem that I had noticed earlier - that is, when I pulled the #1 wire 
off the cap, the engine sound didn't change.  The compression in that 
cylinder was about 55 when I check it a couple of hours ago.  I decided 
to take the bus back out on the highway after changing the plugs, and now 
it seems back to &quot;normal&quot; meaning it'll go 65 mph.  However, it is likely 
the case that since this is the first f time I've ever checked the 
compression that this problem has been around for a while.  Last night 
though, before changine the plugs, I could barely get  to 40 mph.  

Clearly there's a problem with that cylinder, but I'd like to know what I 
can do to fix and/or diagnose the precise problem.  I know it could be a 
number of things, but I've been told it's likely a bad valve.  

Also, since it seems  to go ok, albeit underpowered, can I continue with 
it like this without getting worse, or does this depend on the cause of 
the low compression??  As I said before, I think it has probably been 
underpowered for a while.  Any help would be appreciated since it is not 
only my means of  transportation but it is also my home for the time being.
