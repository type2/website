Subject: 7T's double cab

I saw a double cab VW yesterday (with two doors on the passenger's side)
for the first time.  I guess it was a mid-seventies model, because it was
similar to my old bus.  Are these rare?  I have never seen one before and
thought it was really cool!  Does anyone have more info on these, and are
there any for sale?
Thanks.
