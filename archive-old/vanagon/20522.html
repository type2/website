Subject: My window won't stay fixed (fwd)
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 1995 14:49:22 -0500 (EDT)

&gt;From Stuart Hutton:
&gt; The window on the driver's side won't stay fixed.  It is as simple as that.
&gt; So far, I have taken my door apart 4 times in 3 days to fix the thing, and
&gt; pretty soon, it comes apart again.  Has anyone else had this particular
&gt; frustration?  How have you fixed it?  I am considering installing metal
&gt; plates over a small square nylon guide which exist in these things

Dr. Hutton...

 This is real freaky...My Van had blow-by...yours did. My diesel blew
up..yours did. My timing belt lost teeth, yours did. My window falls
down, yours does...

 This was the *exact* thing I wrote about this a.m.  I put out a plea
for a replacement nylon piece for my passenger side window. Now *you* 
need one for the driver's side....(oh, by the way, thats the problem...)

 Keep the window rolled up....

Ok vanagon_at_lenti gang, anybody *else* have this problem?
