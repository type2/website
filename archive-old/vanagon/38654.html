Troy,

Your message leaves me somewhat confused.  'AS41' is a magnesium alloy used
in the upright engines, whereas the 1973 Volkswagen buses sold in America
were fitted with the aluminum Type IV engine.  But there are no 1700cc
upright engines.  There is a 1584cc upright, commonly referred to as the
'1600', and modification of the engine to use pistons of 90.5mm diameter
would yield 1776cc, but the the only stock 1700cc engine was the Type IV.
 Could you be more specific as to the type of engine in your bus? 
  
Regretfully, the bulk of my experience has been with the older model upright
engines.  I have no experience installing dual Kadron carbs on the Type IV
engine.  If your bus is fitted with the Type IV - 1700cc engine then I'm
afraid I may not be of much help.  

I suggest you join the Vanagon mailing list and present your question to the
membership.  I believe several of them run dual carbs (other than stock).
