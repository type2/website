Subject: Re: (long)VW electric conversion &amp; book story

Greg,
Too bad you did not get what you wanted for a EV book.  I wrote to Roy 
Kaylor and I think I waited six months, forgot about it by then, and 
received a ten page catalog.  I do not think I paid more than a couple 
bucks.  I was impressed that they make adaptors for old aircraft starter 
motors.  There is an old air force base here in Tucson which I would like 
to frequent when I have the funds.  By the way my bus is a 70' not a 72', 
no big... Interesting points you brought up over what vehicle to 
convert.  From experience I would highly recommmend the bus to convert 
and a post, yes post 67'.  I drove my friends 66' with a  40 horse and 
the eccchhh, reduction gears, bahhh.  It was a hair faster than my bus 
which ain't saying much.  The straight gears with a clutch are so much 
nicer on my bus.  I am not trying to compare apples to oranges but my 
electric motor is  a peak 40 horse unit.  I briefly experienced 
clutchless driving on my bus for a short time when the cable stretched 
and broke.  Not fun.  The only time I use the clutch is to set it in gear 
at a stop and up/down shifting.  When I brake I just step on the brake 
pedal, no clutch, to let the transmission torque wind the motor down 
gradually.  Otherwise, letting the motor freewheel (1) takes forever, and 
(2) will eventually warp the flywheel.  
   As for space, as you were saying, again the bus is ideal.  I fit four 
of the batteries between the front two seats, and the other eight under 
the back.  I can, and have, hauled around six people at a time in my bus, 
nooooo problem!  I also suggest keeping the number of batteries low.  I 
have a range of 40-50miles from 12-6v batteries.  There is a guy in town 
with a chevy s-10 with 24-6v in the bed.  Two seats and no room to put 
any of your junk in the back.  What kind of range does he have?  A big 
66miles,  big deal.  What is the difference, why get twice as many 
batteries?  I have heard rumors of a plastic battery!  Yes, apparently, 
THEY have found a way to overcatalyse plastic to where it holds a 
charge.  Interesting.  I carry 750lbs. of lead-acid battery weight in my 
bus now.  As for solar,  not a bad idea, but not very cost effective at 
this point in time at $200 a 12v panel.  Let me know how it goes, later.
Jon,
