Subject: Vallejo Show

The Vallejo show today was WEAK.

Not many people showed up, neither to gawk or to swap.  I had a hard time
spending money, but I perservered and went home broke despite the odds!

I got an NOS RHD gas pedal (another one) 2 NOS RHD Brake pedals, a set of
normal reflectors (for you, Rusty) and a set of barndoor reflectors, a
barndoor steering wheel, bus semaphores, NOS RHD drag link, NOS barndoor tie
rod ends, a set of really nice headlights, (saw lots of nice sets, but these
were the only ones I could touch and _buy_ :) ) 36hp fan thermostat setup,
and a few other odds and ends.

Hate to say it, but the people running the show were PRICKS!  They hassled
one guy for selling T shirts in the swap area, and even more so because they
were $13/2 for $25 - the Official Event T Shirts were $15.  I eavesdropped
on the conversation, and heard the A*hole tell the guy that he can't be
undercutting the event T shirts!  Another event yahoo, who bore a striking
resemblance to Jed Clampett, was hassling another guy about some DMV
paperwork stuff because he was selling a car there.  Another idiot gave us a
hard time when he came and woke us up at sunrise and wanted to collect the
$$ for our entrance and parking and stuff, coming offf with the &quot;gimme my
money now or we'll break your kneecaps and throw you out in the parking lot&quot;
routine.  Bad vibes all around.  We are considering shining on the next event.
