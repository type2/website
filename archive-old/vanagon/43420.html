To whom it may concern;

I saw your decal on a bulletin board at Westside Automotive in 
Edmonton and so I thought I'd try sending a message to see 
what it's all about.  I am sending this from an office of the 
Alberta Forest Service where I am employed as a 
Communications Technician.  Although I do not have a Vanagon, 
my passion for VW's in general and my 1976 Westfalia in 
particular do indeed qualify me as an enthusiast.  If this is a 
club of some sort I'd be interested in finding out more about it.  I 
also would love to get my hands on a few of those nice silver 
decals I saw on the bulletin board.  Feel free to e-mail me 
anytime at:  &quot; nwb2fp_at_env_dot_gov.ab_dot_ca &quot;  Thanks.
