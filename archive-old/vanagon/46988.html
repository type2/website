Subject: advice on exhaust repairs needed

Hi.  Two more questions:

1) I've got a rattle in the Cat. converter.  Do I necessarily need to 
replace the converter?  I know it won't pass emissions inspections 
without it, but can I damage the engine by not fixing this?

2) Also, I have a pin size hole in the muffler.  For those of you who've 
done work on these parts, have you done it yourself?Any recommendations 
on parts to get/avoid?

Sort of 3rd questions - can those rusty bolts be dealt with?

THanks,
david
