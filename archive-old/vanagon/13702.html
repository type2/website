!!EVERY VW I've ever owned, whether its air or watercooled has
_at__at_had a personality, has been fun to drive, and economical. To
##say that VW has lost its &quot;touch&quot; with watercooled is
$$awfully naive. What VW has lost touch with is the US market!
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ain't that the truth!  
1)  When did you see the last VW commercial/advertisement?  A long time ago.  
I wonder if the words &quot;precipitous decline in U.S. sales&quot; means anything to the
highly trained and educated VWoA marketing staff?  

2)  Not that I like commercials so much, but what new cars/engine 
variations do they offer?   For instance, the Turbo-diesel.  I called 
VWoA and asked if they were ever going to offer another to the U.S. 
market.  They said &quot;yes,&quot; in the Golf, Jetta, and Van in Fall '95.

BTW:  You can reach them _at_ (800) 822-8987.


3)  The TDI:  I read about the TDI in a British mag (VW &amp; Audi, or 
something like that).  It sounds exciting, and exciting is a word NOT 
generally used to describe a diesel.  Lots more power _and_ better 
efficiency.  Example:  The golf gets a 1.9 TDI, the van gets a 2.4--I can 
already hear tires screaming!! :^)


Sorry--this post evolved from a VWoA rant into a diesel one--but I can't 
help it--I dig diesels!!
