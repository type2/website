  OFFICE MEMO          RE&gt;EV transmissions                    Date:2/26/96

On 2/26 Jake said &lt;through the grapevine that there are a
few folks having to replace transmissions on their 92/93 Eurovans for about
$7000. Anybody heard any other horror stories about these things?&gt;

To to which I reply....
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

I have heard nothing about that. How about any of you other EV'ers?
