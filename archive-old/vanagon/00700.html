Subject: Propane Madness

I bought a pressure gague for my propae tank but it isn't really useful so I
got an extra propane tank off another westy and mounted it on the othr side
of the vehicle under the sliding door and conneted it in to the plumbing. Now
I know it is time to fill the one tank when it runs dry and I switch to the
other tank. 

Unless you buy a 2nd tank and mount it under the sliding door you will exist
in a permanent state of anxiety about when you are going to run out of
propane. There is no way out. You are not going to get around to mounting a
2nd tank. You are doomed. 

Actually, mounting the 2nd tank isn't that hard, as the nuts are already
welded into the body of the camper so the mounting spot is all prepared for
you. And any RV place will have the VW tanks (manchester horizontal 10 lb
tank) in stock and can install it quick.

Hummm...

Alright schwarze_at_io.nosc_dot_mil. Where did you get the gague? What kind is it?
Does it really work? Can we mail order it?
