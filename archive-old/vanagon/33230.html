&gt;I'm looking for some help if anyone's experienced the sort of thing I've
&gt;got going on now in my '77 breadloaf Westy...
&gt;We had some serious snow here this winter (NJ), and when I opened my
&gt;engine compartment, I've got a pile of snow about 6&quot; high sitting right
&gt;on my battery!  It blew in from the cooling vent on the right rear side
&gt;of the bus.

yup. :) been there (chicago); done that.

i used a small whisk broom to clean it out, then thereafter, i carried some
plastic garbage/yard-leaf bags around with me ... and when i stopped for the
night, i stuff those bags into the air-vents!  looked kinda stupid, but it
kept the snow out.

BUT!!! &lt;there's ALWAYS a &quot;gotcha!&quot;&gt;  you MUST remember to remove them when
you get ready to go in the morning. for me, this wasn't so bad, cause i
always had to crank the engine, then walk around the bus, scaping the ice and
snow off the windows. and, as i passed by the rear, i'd tuck my plastic bags
into my pocket for later re-use. :)
