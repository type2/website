Subject: Re: '71 Club Cab + friends

Finally got around to visiting a guy on a boonies backroad near our cottage. 
An aircooled VW collector with ample parking. I donated my '72 
woodshed/Westy to his collection, provided he removes it from the cottage, 
it's been there 9 years. Gee how time flies. Anyhow, none of his vehicles 
cost him over $100, a '71 club Cab, all sides/tin/glass/plastic in place, 
'69 flattop Euro-import Westy, why he wants my roof! '70 panel, a Thing, a 
K-Ghia, half a dozen Beetles, including a hilarious one shortened 18&quot;, and 
another  half dozen Wabbits. All are in rough shape, most are driveable. I 
feel the Westy is at last going to the old volks home (Hah, I have no 
shame). The guy is heading into Maine to pull bits from a cache of 4 K-Ghias 
he's located. 
        The Club Cab he paid $50 for, no motor, rescued from the crusher by 
one day. I wonder what my wife would say if .....
        If anyone needs misc small part, ie. mailable size, I can ask him. 
He's been putting stuff away for years, didn't see any splitties though. tim s.
