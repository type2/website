Subject:      Broken Speedo


Hi everybody. I'm curious to know if anybody's speedometer has broken on
their Vanagons. I have an '85 and the speedo and Odometer both broke last
month. I have no Idea how far or fast I'm going.

Previous to it breaking it was off by wuite a bit...70mph was actually 55,
90mph was about 65-70.

How much would it cost to get it fixed?
Is it something that isn't that tough, or would it be better left to somebody
else?

Thanks for the info
Aaron
