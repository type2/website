Subject: Re: NEATO applications

...what the hell is a neato ? am i missing out on something really cool here
?
        G.

&gt; Several people requested NEATO applications from me a few weeks back
&gt; and I just wanted to check and make sure that everyone who wanted
&gt; one got theirs.
&gt;
&gt; If you haven't recieved yours yet, I may have lost your address.  I
&gt; think even those of you overseas should have yours by now.
&gt;
&gt; In any case if you wanted one and didn't get one, I didn't mean to
&gt; leave you out.
&gt;
&gt; I can be reached at deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu.
