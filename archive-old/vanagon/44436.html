Subject: Planning for trip..July 16-23 Can you help?

hey now,

well, me and amanda are heading north july 16...hopefully Rumba will be rebuilt
and running well by then. gotta get up to speed on that. anyways, we are
heading from raleigh, nc to ithaca, new york....a nice 12 hour trip in a car
going 70-75...perhaps 14 or so in a bus. we are taking 1 north out of raleigh,
then 85/95 to right before or after richmond (can't exactly remember) then
cutting over to 81 and it's 81 through PA (anyone ever driven 81 through PA,
man, ain't that a long drive?) and into NY.

any VW events going on around this time? anyone heading north and want to
caravan? We are going to the Grassroots Festival...a 4 day music festival
that is spectacular. if anyone is interested, i'll sent details. lots of
bands, hippies, kind folks, busses, food, drink, et al.

also, in my many travels to ithaca, i've always sped up there in going way
above the speed limits...in a car. now that Rumba will be in the best shape
ever, i'd like to do some camping, see the sites, etc. anyone got some
suggestions about good areas to camp?

lastly, any list members live along 81? in case i need help or something? or
in case i just want to stop by and share a homebrew with you? i've been
saving a keg of Armenian Stout (will be about 9.5% alcohol) for about 9
months now...gonna bring it to the festival! :-) i'd like to meet some of
you folks!

happy Saturday!
