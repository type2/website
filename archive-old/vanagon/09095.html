&gt; 
&gt; 1. Repaint the same original orange color with top-most section painted white.
&gt; 2. Camouflage paint using flat desert colors (tan, various light orange, etc.)
&gt; 3. Flowers, peace signs, etc. very retro-60s (still mostly orange)
&gt; 4. White all over
&gt; 5. White top, red stripe, bottom blue with big white stars....

I'd say do a nice glossy white paint job.  Then if you want a personal 
look you just get some water based paint and do it up.  You can have a 
different paint job every week, and a clean glossy white paint job for 
when you go to nice neighborhoods. :)
