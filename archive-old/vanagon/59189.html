Subject: Re: propane gauge?


W. Silva, while I have never seen an actual guage to measure propane I 
have seen a simple device that sticks on to the side of the tank.  It 
reminds me of one of those battery tester strips, I think the sticker is 
temperature sensitive.  It only gives a visual readout (not a measured 
amount).  I've only seen them, no feedback (sorry).
Have you tryed &quot;bleeding&quot; the gas lines by letting both stove burners 
burn for several minutes?  This helps w/my dometic (when it hasn't been 
used in a long time).  Hope it helps.

&gt; Awhile ago I asked if anyone had ever installed a propane gauge to their
&gt; tank.  I have gotten a number of estimates on how long the gas will last

&gt; enough room.  I guess that's my question.  I too am having troubles getting
&gt; the fridge to run on gas.  Have tried all the easy suggestions, now I guess
&gt; we have to get down to the serious stuff.
