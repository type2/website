Oh, Soon To Be Envious Fellow Diesel List Members,
It lives, it lives!!! Finally got the air cleaner temporaried in and got to
drive the new Beast on the road. Whoa..., what a rocket ship. I can't
believe it's the same van. Without getting on it, it get's on itself. A far
cry from the perpetual right laner of it's previous existance. I only took
it on some side streets as I still dont have a muffler or tail pipe ( or
brakes, for that matter...). The tires were a bit low from sitting for so
long which made it a bit squirly with the locking differential...Boy, what
a rush. I'll post more later,
Bob Bellanca
