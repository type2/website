Subject: Re: &quot;Engine flushing&quot; How to?

Engine flushing can be dangerous if the engine is especially &quot;gunked&quot; or
varnished up. If the flush breaks loose some large chunks of &quot;gunk&quot;
(carbon, varnish, dirt etc.), this gunk ball can clog an oil galley,
most likely only momentarily. However it doesn't take but a very few
seconds of oil starvation to a main bearing to score or ruin it. 
I highly recommend Marvel Mystery Oil as a cleaning additive. You can
just keep driving and changing oil at your normal interval w/this truly
time tested produce.
