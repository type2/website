Subject: Kinda Stumped



In response to the exorcism, I truly believe
my bus is inhabited by a spirit with a bad sense
of humor, but it keeps me in check.

Here's my major concern, I turn the key and she won't respond,
this has been ongoing for a while (I'm still poor), at first
I assumed the starter or solenoid, I would bang on the starter
and she would start, I changed the starter, and she works great, 
for 3-4 months, then she does the same thing, so I start thinking 
it must be the ingnition, from the key back. My friend that owns 
a VW repair shop says that changing this is a pain, so he gives me 
another starter (used but looks good and works) I put it in and it 
works great for another semester, I also stuck a button (in a secret 
spot behind my seat ;)) that puts juice directly to the solenoid, but
this button is not fused and sometimes hangs up (won't stop cranking,
even with no key) now the same thing is starting again. 

It is a 71 and the wiring has seen better days, Is it my ignition?
If so is it really a big pain to change, I don't recall Mr. Muir
saying anything about changing the ignition wires.


also I'm still interested in wiring diagrams for this
particular bus..

thanks for the input,
