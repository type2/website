        Greetings once more. The van went back into the shop yesterday, as
it puttered (for lack of a better word) out on me on Wednesday night 1km
from home. An older German gentleman in a well maintained Audi was the only
person out of 50 or so vehicles that was kind enough to even stop and ask
me if I needed a hand.
        The van seemed as if it was out of gas, or was not getting a
consistent fuel flow at all, but it was dark and I was tired, so
investigation was held off till thurs. It started fine the next day but was
idling very rough so I called the shop that had done the work on it earlier
in the week and they towed it in for free and spent all of yesterday and
most of today trying to figure it out.
        They suspected that a)it was eletrical or b) that there may have
been dirt/crud/water or something in the fuel that did not jive with the
engine at all. It seems fine now so I nor they know exactly what had
happened but Im crossing my fingers it never happens again.
        Anyhow We'll see how she runs this weekend and take it from there I
guess. Its been a very trying week though with having to take her into the
mechanic twice and all.

have a good weeknd all,
