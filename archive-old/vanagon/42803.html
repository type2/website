So Mike says:
&gt;         I was just wondering if any of you veteran van campers could give
&gt; me an idea of how best to pack your van. Any tips that you could give at
&gt; all on things like:
&gt; - where best to store certain items
&gt; - how to keep things from banging around while your driving
&gt; - extra things that just us Westie camper people should maybe bring, or
&gt; that would be helpful.
&gt; 

You know, I've been wrestling with this one for several years.  Every
time I think I have it licked, my wife comes up with 10 more large items
that just have to go. :[   Of course, I really can't blame her because
no matter what I do, the wood we have to take has to go somewhere and 
the only logical place to put it is on the floor.

But.... I'll tell you what we typically do.....

Let's see.  In the top cargo area I put in: 

       Camping lantern
       Sleeping bags
       Coleman Stove
       Table Top Grill
       Propane tank
       And sometimes the folding chairs

 In the cabinets are:

    (Most of this stuff stays in the cabinets)
       All the utinsels
       Pots &amp; Pans
       Dishes &amp; Cups
       Spices
       Condiments
       Foil/Saran Wrap
       misc. kitchen items

 In the closet goes:
      
       Hiking boots
       paper plates/cups
       Misc. clothes that can stay in the camper.
       Funnel for fill water tank with purified water.
       Food,clothing or pillows will be stuffed in there the
       day of the trip.

Under the bench seat:

       (This stuff is always their)
       First aid kit
       Spare belts
       Porta-potti chemicals
       gas can
       gloves
       rags
       VW Manual
       2 quarts of oil
       Jumper Cables
       Other shit that I can't think of right now. :)

Behind the bench seat goes:

       Sport bags of our cloths and necessities
       bags of food
       pillows
       tubs for outside washing and grey water

On the galley floor:

       Wood for camp fires
       Ice chest
       Porta-potti (always there)
       water bottles (don't even ask)

Between the driver/passenger seat is:

      a cupholder/junk thing for:
	   water/drinks
	   cassettes
	   change
	   pencil/pens
	   etc....

In the groove over the sink:

      Matches
      spare mantles
      small flashlight
      window pulldown shades


In the cabinets behind the closet:

      books &amp; games
      flashlight
      misc. like sunscreen
      tape,pencils 
      hatch screen
      rolaids
      asprin
      earplugs


This list is pretty long, eh.  Well sometimes we need this
stuff and sometimes we don't.  I just as soon leave most of 
it in the van so I don't have to deal with it all the time.

That's all...
