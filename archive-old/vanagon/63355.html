&lt;&lt; I think this might be counter-productive. I have spoken to the people at
 Kennedy and the person I spoke to seemed to be aware of the List. If we were
 to bombard them with mail  they might just get pissed off.

 Though, if one or two people were to let them know how many of us on the
List
 are interested in the Subaru conversion maybe they could be talked into
 giving us a List discount. Its worth a try.

I agree,  there is no need to swamp them.  They have always been helpful and
courteous to me and others I've spoken with.  And I'm sure they would be
delighted that more than a few people could use their help.

Maybe they would be willing to find a way to scan or convert the info package
they send out to post it here for all to browse?   If they have no Internet
connection etc. one of us could probably do it for them (with their
permission of course).  Some of us have that info in hard copy... Mine is 8
months old now.
