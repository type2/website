Subject: clogged heat riser

Here's a pretty simple question that I hope one of you has the answer to.
 I'm sure I'm not the first to have to deal with it.  On the 40HP engine I'm
rebuilding for my '63 Kombi, the heat riser tube on the intake manifold is
clogged with carbon.  I'm sure this is what caused/helped the #3 rod to burn
and land the bus in the junkyard before I got ahold of it, so I'd like to fix
it right.  I've tried jamming a coat hanger in both ends and had a little
success at getting some pretty good sized chunks of carbon out of it.  I
can't get it to go all the way through for anything though, and I'm concerned
that even if/when I do, it won't be totally clean inside and will just clog
up again.  Are there any good chemicals or anything else that may aid in
cleaning it out?  Any help would be much appreciated.
