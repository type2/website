I've got sheepskins on both of my vans and they're great in summer as well
as winter. No cons unless you're a hard-core animal rights activist or
something (but then you wouldn't be asking this question would you). I
bought mine from a local outfit so I can't recommend a brand. Seat covers
usually come in two shapes: basic and high-back. The basic rectangular
shaped covers fit best--you'll have to poke a couple of holes in the top to
insert the headrest. You might need to tailor the covers a bit to get a good
fit.
