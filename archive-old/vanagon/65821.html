&gt; Hi I'm looking at buying a syncro and driving it home.  The power steering
&gt; lines are supposed to be rotted from sitting (I haven't seen the van yet).
&gt; The trip would be about 5 hours.
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if there would be any problem with driving it this way?  I
&gt; haven't had a Vanagon with power steering yet so I don't know what the
&gt; setup is like?  Could I damage anything driving it that way?  What about
&gt; pulling the belt off the ps pump?
This is true! But the PS belt is captive to a small hose in the cooling
system. So don't remove it completely just tie it back away from
everything.

&gt;
&gt; If it works out I would rather drive it than pull it or trailer it. . . I
&gt; know the rules  ALL 4 tires on the ground or ALL 4 tires on a trailer.
&gt;
&gt; If I do tow it (all 4 on the ground, likely with a tow bar) are there any
&gt; speed or distance limitations?
  Remove the drive shaft and tow it anyway you want
