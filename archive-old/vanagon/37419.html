Subject: RE: Chirping engines...


&gt;&gt;two weeks i will be swapping motors in my 81(california version), due
&gt;&gt;to an as-yet unidentified intermittent-but-mostly-present
&gt;&gt;tweedling/chirping sound (on revving/acceleration, and sometimes a
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;constant slow chirp at idle) and the availability of a low-cost
&gt;&gt;replacement motor.
&gt;
&gt;I thought this sound was a characteristic of the VWs dating back to
&gt;the type 1 engine, but still somewhat present even in the type 4...
&gt;Or is this a different sound? My wife claims she can hear the faint
&gt;sound of a beetle in our '88 Westy, so I sure hope this is normal....

Yup... the classic whistling of the venerable type-1, came from the
perforated packing in the twin tailpipes of the Beetle. A one-cylinder
backfire into the muffler, made it sound like a startled canary. Some
people used to remove this packing from the tailpipes, which made it
sound quite kewl from the inside, just like a real car...

Which is why I always left mine in.
