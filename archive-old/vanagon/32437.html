Subject: Second battery solution?

Sorry to keep going on and on about this, but I may have found a nice
solution to my second battery search, and I wanted to run it by the
collective wisdom of the Vanagonners...

There is a 12-volt deep-cycle gel-cell battery designed for wheelchairs that is
5&quot;w x 7&quot;l x 6.5&quot;h.  It's a 12 volt battery with 32 amp-hours reserve.  Cost
is around $80.

The cool thing is that *two* of these would fit nicely beneath the drivers'
seat on my 1990 Vanagon (12&quot;x7&quot;x7&quot;h).

My question is, does this make sense?  Would they deliver enough power to be
worth the effort?  (I want to run a laptop with a draw of 1.5A, as well as
the lights in the van.)
