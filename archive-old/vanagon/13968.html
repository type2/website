Subject: My Tank Runnith Over

I bought an '83 Vanagon last May from a guy who said he was tired of 
working on it. Well I finally got time to get it going (shattered clutch) 
and took it on it's maiden voyage to the Shell station for tank full of 
unleaded and a spin through the car wash.

Just over half way through the fill up, I heard what sounded linke a 
waterfall under the Van, so being the curious type I stopped filling to 
take a look. Sure enough there was a waterfall or should I say gasfall 
running out from somewhere above the middled of the van where the tank 
is. Yikes!

I managed to get home with out blowing anything up and will climb under 
there this weekend to take a look. Has this happened to anyone else?
