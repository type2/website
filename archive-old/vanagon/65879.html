The low oil pressure is a good indication that the case is shot.  New bearings
may bring the pressure up for a while but don't bet on it.  These cases wear
out around the center bearing like all the other VW's.  Especially if the
engine is driven at high speeds for any length of time.  Check the case very
carefully for straightness and the bearing bores for eccentricity.  Find some
one to perform a &quot;Line Bore&quot;.  So far, VW reman engines are the only ones I've
seen with line bored cases.
