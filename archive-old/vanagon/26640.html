Subject: Grendel's belly ache



Grendel crept out onto the highway this morning at 8:23.  It was raining a
sad, cold rain that continued for the next two hours as we fled south.

The engine ran fine.  The tranny did not.  Each time we stopped for gas
Grendel squatted down and pissed a pie-plate sized pool of tranny lube on the
concrete.  When she stopped pissing I crawled under and fed her some more
lube.  She liked it but got progressively noisier as the day went on,
culminating with an ominous shriek of tortured bearings as we struggled over
a pass in southern Oregon.

I'm in Grant's Pass, Oregon.  It is cold and getting colder, weather unsuited
for summer shirts and cotton socks.  And I'm tired.  

Tomorrow I'll try to find a flat spot in the sun, see what I can do in the
way of repairs.  I'm not very hopeful.

-Bob
