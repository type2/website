     VW would never go Bankrupt even if they  completely lost. They are
     one of the Worlds &quot; Worlds&quot; largest companies!  What you are
     seeing (here in the US) is a decline. But in other countries VW
     is doing great. LAw suits are one of the biggest reason VW Doesn't
     want to sale in this country.
