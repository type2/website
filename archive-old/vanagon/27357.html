Subject: CV work and NH ???


NHVW club NH as in New Hampshire?? I'll be up that way around Nashua this 
weekend, and would appreciate any leads on good campers for sale.

On CV joints, my experience on a GTI was about $120 per outer joint (after 
market), and about $25 per boot kit at VW.  I guess the outer joint on a bus 
is a flange type connection, and not a splined shaft as on front wheel drive 
cars?  About when do these boots blow out on the vans?  My experience has 
shown that on the outer joints small cracks start to form at about 75-85,000 
mi on VW's with front wheel drive?  I always siliconed the rubber to keep it 
pliable and soft.
