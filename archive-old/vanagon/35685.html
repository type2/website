Hi!

And Bye!

This storm is horrendous, our road has been closed since last night at 
10p, and it's amazing that we still have power... could change any 
minute... we're unsubscribing to the list until the end of the storm.

If we ever get out of here, we might see you at Peppermint... hard to 
say, now.

If we can get info on snowpack at Peppermint, we'll email Martha.

Thanks for all the great comments on &quot;Her Majesty.&quot; We're going with 
that for her name.

As soon as we can, we'll forward some gifs to the web, and let you all 
know where you can check her out. Hopefully she'll be in one of the 
mags, soon.

Thanks again!
