Subject: Re: Rear heater in '84 Westy

Thanks for the information Eric.  Mine is leaking where the aluminum tubes
come through the steel end frame opposite the in-out fittings.  I have
pried the end off, cut out the old sealing material, and cleaned the
entire area using steel brushes on a Dremel tool, and a dentist's pick. 
When I can stop working on my electronics problems I will follow Tim
Smiths advice and seal around all the tubes with Auto Epoxy, Silicone the
end cap back on, and see what happens. 

                       Earl J. Smith
