Subject: need help on fridge

Hello listmembers... Can you help me with my Dometic Fridge in 87' Westy?
 Here's the problem.... Runs fine, and cold on AC, DC, but when I switch to
propane,  only after more than 10,000 pumps, the pilot finally lights, and
shows the green light on my display.  However,  it's not cooling... I can see
the pilot light in the little hole in left lower corner of inside of fridge
cabinet, and the flue on outside of the van is warm. but it's not cooling..
What's my problem?  What can I do?  I wish to run it on propane during
extended stays in each campsite where no AC is available.  I should also note
that although the pilot is lit, and display shows it's working,, when I put
my ear near the flue, I don't hear the customary rumbling of the burner
working.  Any help would be appreciated..  please respond either direct, or
through the list... Thanks...
