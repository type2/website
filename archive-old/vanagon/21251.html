&gt; I, like others I know, gutted the useless Westfalia fridge and converted 
&gt; it to storage. I run a chest-type fridge off of the normal propane tank. 
&gt; I put it behind the passenger seat as a perfect bench for cooking, etc. 
&gt; Worked well for camping on isolated beaches in Mexico for extended 
&gt; periods of time.
&gt; 
&gt; I got it from a propane distributor in Canada, but you might be able to 
&gt; order it from an RV store in the US. Browse the Dometic catalog that they 
&gt; have and see if they still make something small enough to suit you...
&gt; 
 
Thanks for the info.  What is a &quot;chest-type fridge&quot;?  Is it similar in  
configuration to the stock Westy fridge?  What are the approximate  
dimensions?  Do you remember how much you paid for it?  I guess you can't  
turn your passenger seat around anymore.  Bummer. 

Dick
