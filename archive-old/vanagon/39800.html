Ian,

Sorry, I thought you were approaching me via the Vanagon list.   

( vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu )  

It uses the normal ListServer protocol (ie, no subject, msg to read:
 subscribe vanagon (your name).

It is comprised of people who own or wish to own Type II Volkswagens.  The
list was started by Vanagon owners but now includes all buses and  vans.
 There are about 600 member located world-wide.

-Bob
