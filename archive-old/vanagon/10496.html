&gt;
&gt;I have also hadd a time when the back of the door would bind when
&gt;opening, but I could not diagnose the problem. Until I tried
&gt;to fix some other stuff and I discovered that I was missing some
&gt;of the bolts that hold it on! They get loose (all that banging open
&gt;and closed) and fall out. You cant really tell because the door
&gt;is so heavy that it just sits out of kilter. Look for missing
&gt;bolts (dashboard mounting screws are the same) by trying to
&gt;lift the rear of the door.
&gt;
&gt;I have tightened mine, even tried loctite, but they still
&gt;come loose every couple of years and need to be tightened.
&gt;
&gt;Also try wheel bearing grease in the upper, middle, and lower
&gt;track. It will collect dust in the lower track, but
&gt;workslonger than WD-40. Mabye just WD-40 in the lower track.
