Hi,

I have been on this list for fourteen months and this is my first
contribution.  I have been fooling around with Volkswagens for about 30
years.  At one point I had 5-1965 sedans; about the time I had to decide
between VWs or my now ex-wife.  Made sense at the time.  I didn't have time
to check the archives for the following information so if it is old news,
so be it.

                Bettle Barn Automotive
                Foreign Auto Service (read as VW)
                61581 Vocational Road
                Cambridge  OH  43725

                 Phone:  614 685 6566

                George's Foreign Service
                1160 S Main Street
                North Canton  OH  44720

                Phone:  330 497 2715

I have been doing business with these two people for almost three years and
have been extremely satisfied.  I just purchased two, what I consider to
be, pristine heater boxes for our 1974 Bus (not a micro mini van) for
$110.00 each.  These boxes are from New Mexico and are virtually rust free
and still have 90% of their grey primer.  I also picked-up a complete
carpet set for $130.00.  This set is COMPLETE including the wrap around
part from behind the seat and under both front seats.  You will have to
excuse me but I was impressed.

The other thing I have learned in my association with VW folk is that the
people that own them and the people that provide service for them are all a
little eccentric.  I speak only to air cooled vehicles!  I don't know
anything at all about &quot;wasser boxes&quot; and at my age I don't intend to learn.
The aforementioned servcice providers are, indeed, our kind of people.

I still do a lot a buying from Rocky Mountain and Busboys but when you need
a special part for your bus, bug, KG or anything off the wall these two
guys will go out of their way to do it or get it for you.

The preceeding message............

Keep the air flowing and an ice bag on #3,
