Subject: Re: 6V Starter --&gt; 12V battery?



christian, my 60 single has had a 6volt starter in it for years with a 
12v electrical system.  so far no problems.  it runs real fast when it 
turns the motor over, but has never burned out. (16+ years)  actually, it 
turns the motor over real fast and starts it up right away.  i would not 
let it run for very long, but other then that it works good.
take care and God BLess

&gt; I have a '65 Deluxe that has been converted to 12V.  Well, almost....
&gt; THe system is set up such:  2 6V batteries in series, of which the starter
&gt; and wiper are tapped off of the first 6V battery.  This allows me to have
&gt; a couple of 6V circuits to run the starter and the wiper.  Lately (given 
&gt; the cold weather - 6 F this morn.) I've been having trouble keeping charge
&gt; in the batteries.  Even a new Interstate (fairly moderate CCA) is not doing
&gt; the job.  I think for this system to werk well, the batteries should be
&gt; as identical as possible. (I seem to remember a thread on this a while back
&gt; but do not know the details as to why.)
&gt; 
&gt; I am contemplating to switch this set up such that I have one 12V battery and
&gt; replacing the 6V wiper motor with one out of a '67 (12V).  Can I keep the 
&gt; starter (6V) in this setup?  I am under the impression that the starter will
&gt; suffice as it is only briefly used (i.e., for starting) and the brief exposure
&gt; to 12V will allow me to get by for some time before I do this properly and 
&gt; replace the flywheel and starter to a 12V setup (in a few years?).  Is this
&gt; so?
