&gt;Let me give you a quick story. You all know who Bill Gates is, right?
&gt;He has a Porsche 959 (you all remember the Porsche supercar from
&gt;the early 1980s) that is sitting in a warehouse because he
&gt;can't get it into the country legally. Here is a guy who has, what,
&gt;Billions of $$$$....and for all he's worth, he can't even buy
&gt;the access to the US for his car. So get a clue!
&gt;

Just to set the record straight, the story I've heard is this:
Mr. Gates (aka Billion Dollar Bill)  did manage to bring his 959 into the US.
Apparently there was a 1 month period during which one law expired and another
took over. During that time both him and Mr. Allen, and probably a few others,
managed to get their cars &quot;bailed out&quot; of US Customs.
Now, are they actually legal to drive? I'm not sure.
But it does show that there is often away around &quot;the law&quot; and I'll bet his $
helped him find it.
Any validation/repudiation of this story welcome. It's just one of those legends
that float around here in the outlying regions of Microsoft-ville.

Now back to your regularly scheduled program....

BTW: Avery - do you think you can get email in jail?
