&gt; I called 1-800-444-8987 about 11:00 EST today and asked for &quot;VW History 
&gt; Book/Video&quot;.  I spoke with a woman, do not remember her name.  She asked 
&gt; a few questions (if I was intrested in buying or leasing, what year model 
&gt; vehicles I own, if I would buy/lease in the next 3/6/12 months, and how I 
&gt; got this phone number) then said they would sent the goodies to me.  
&gt; After a little prodding about the Jerry Garcia thing, she said they would 
&gt; include that too.

Well, I followed suit and called.

Talked to a lady named Ann.  Asked about the book, and she said 
&quot;Sorry sir we don't sell history books here.&quot;  I then asked for the 
_VW_ history book, and she didn't know anything about that, just a 
History video.  She offered to send that.

I asked, &quot;I also head you have some poster thing...&quot;  
&quot;Oh, you mean the Jerry Garcia poster.  I'll send that too.&quot;

No questions about purchasing!  And it didn't take much to get the 
stuff!
