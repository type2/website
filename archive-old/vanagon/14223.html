Subject: Piston Slap

&gt; Somebody needs to offer a good description of piston slap.  I
&gt; would think that that would tend to occur under load or 
&gt; acceleration, rather than at idle.  Any expertise?

  I'll give it a try, my '72 had piston slap in a big way. It basically sounds
  like a dull knock. It occurs at half speed, like tappet noise because the
  knock is triggered by the cylinder firing, not the piston movement. Thus,
  the sound is heard when the engine is under load rather than at idle  and
  it is heard loudest when the engine is cold and the piston to cylinder
  clearance is greatest. 

  Lots of VW engines in good condition, especially wasserboxers and type IVs
  have some piston slap when they are stone cold. When Steve Johnson pulled
  out of our shared campsite at Red Rock I heard an excellent sample of 
  normal piston slap. My friend Marlin Oleson's 2.1 wasserboxer does the same
  thing. This has something to do with piston pin offset. The wrist pins are
  not placed in the center of the piston, I read somewhere that this is done
  to prevent piston slap at the expense of increased friction and wear.
  On a type I engine the offset is 1.5 mm! On the type IV, this was
  reduced to 0.5 mm. I don't have a manual for the wasserboxer, 
  but I'll speculate that it was reduced from 1.5 mm. Maybe someone with a
  copy of Bentley could check this out and make me look stupid &lt;again, I'm 
  the guy with the pieces of bearing in his oil, remember?&gt; .
