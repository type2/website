Subject:      VW's parade near Philly, pa

Short notice but...  wondering if those in the Philadelphia area would =
be interested in
particpating in a local car parade Sept 28, 1997.  This is a anything =
goes parade where all
makes and models are welcome.  In the past i have teamed up with Fiats =
to parade as a
group.  Here's my thoughts:

Parade is in Lansdale, PA (40 minutes  north of Philadelphia) Sept 28. =
 Gather at some spot
(tbd) around 10 or 11 a.m., move as a group to the parade staging area =
so as to be put in
the parade as a group.  Parade then moves thru Lansdale to the Olean Tile=
 Company
premises where everybody parks and looks around.  Typically there are =
hundreds of cars,
all makes, years, customized, etc...  Last year they had activities for =
kids with prizes,
give-aways, food, etc...  (no cost except for food and trinkets).

Any VW's interested first e-mail me privately.  If there's enough interes=
t I will go ahead.

As I am not presently affiliated with any VW group  (just recently purcha=
sed my
Westy), any VW clubs would certainly be a boost if they wanted to get =
involved. Last year
it was quite fun to be in the parade.  This year I think I'll give my =
kids candy to throw to the
crowds.

As time is getting close please e-mail me directly.

Thanks
