&gt; &quot;I can go fast in my 1975 Japaneese station wagon&quot; is right on my 
&gt; tail.  As I always do, I signal right indicating that I am going to 
&gt; get over in the slow lane as soon as I am around the trucker.  
&gt; 
&gt; But OH NO.  Mr Station wagon, AS I AM CHANGING LANES cuts to the 
&gt; right and starts to try to pass me.  So I swerve left.  Look out the 
&gt; side and glare.  He gets cut off by another slow moving vehicle, and 
&gt; gets behind me again.

     People tend to drive maniacally here in San Diego, and 
     inexplicably tailgate at all times. I'm about as patient
     as the next person, but there have been a few times when
     I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
     bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
     them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
     their shorts in fear of running into me.


     I'm in the market for a bumper sticker advising tailgaters that
     tailgating will not make my car go any faster...

     I can't decide if this is immature driving on my part
     or a good-natured effort to improve the driving habits
     of others...
