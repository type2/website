Subject: peanut butter storage in Campers

Many list members like me have campers and keep food in there for the odd
rainy day. I found some peanut butter in mine that had been in there since
1992 (I labeled it), through -20 degree winters and 115 degree-in-the sun
summers. 

Does peanut butter go bad?

Does it go bad faster once you open the container?

Should I eat the peanut butter or throw it out?
