&gt;&gt; &gt;Anybody know why the headlights shut off when you shut off the engine,
but
&gt;&gt; &gt;the parking lights don't??? This seems to me to be the height of
&gt;silliness.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Obviously, the headlights shut off so you won't find a dead car when you
&gt;&gt; &gt;forget to shut them off yourself (don't you love it when car
manufacturers
&gt;&gt; &gt;assume stupidity?). But the parking lights will run the battery down just
&gt;&gt; &gt;as completely-- they just take longer to do it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; i believe in some countries in europe, when parking on the street, parking
&gt;&gt; lights live up to their name.  people are legally required to put on their
&gt;&gt; parking lights when parking at night, so when you turn off your vanagon in
&gt;&gt; europe, everything is done for you!

With a healthy battery, you should be able to run the parking lights for 8 to
10 hours and still start the van. A few weeks ago I tested my battery at
work.  11 hours, below freezing, to my surprise the van started on it's own.
 My battery is an Exide international series, group 41.

I used to own a porche 924.   It allowed you to operate the parking lights on
one side only if needed.
