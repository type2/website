Subject: Re: ergonomics

&gt;Funny you should mention ergonomics.  In 3500 miles on the road with  a
&gt;couple of over 8 hour days, I never had one twinge of pain or discomfort
&gt;in my back.

I've noticed that ALL of the VWs I've driven have been comfortable, no
matter how many hours I spent behind the wheel, including The Bozobus (in
which half of the road-shock absorption is in the seat springs).

I can't say the same thing about the squishy velour-wrapped seats I've met
in U.S.-made rental cars I've had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of driving.
