Subject: Where is it?

Well, i'm 3 months overdue for the required inspection sticker, so I
picked the start of the Stinking Hot Texas Summer to have a go at
getting my '83 to pass.

l. I read on here that the o2 sensor reset button is somewhere close to
the steering column.  Took off cover, can't find it.  Even went under,
took out spare.  Not there?
Where?  

[Resorted to removing bulb.  In the process, found out the PO had
removed the odometer with an ax.  Plastic back (I won't burn it!) broken
out, bottom attaching points broken, whole thing fixed up with duct
tape.  Wonder why?  I bot it with 65k on it, good shape, seemed
resonable...  Noted that the trip milage didn't work, maybe they were
trying to fix it...]

2. Where is the air inlet?  In the Texas heat, poor air conditioner
can't keep up with a steady supply of hot air coming in the front. 
Can't seem to get it all the way closed.  went looking for the inlet
with the idea of blocking it off for the summer.  Took off both grills,
nothing but radiators...  Went under again... nothing.  Where?

3.  Making noises like exaust is leaking at head.  Up on lift, examine
pipes carefully.  Can't find anything...  Oh well, if I can't find it,
the inspector won't either.
