&gt;Rear sway bars for Vanagons! Ooooeee, tel us more Joel. Where do they
&gt;attach? Is it similar to the rear sway bar setup for loafs?

that's what i can't tell from the picture. i suppose those clamp-looking
thingies are bolted to the back vertical body panel of the interior (under
and behind the rear seat). the ends of the sway bar are connected to the
rear suspension in a similar manner to the front: short little arms that
are bolted to the big A-arm. it MIGHT be possible to fit a front sway bar
onto the rear ... but the picture shows the rear bar to be a different shape.
the question is: how to get the parts over there? anybody want to check if
it's available in canada?

&gt;This is good news especially after Christmas, (more weight in the rear)

ah, yes ... but we're talking about the CARS ... not the DRIVERS! :)
