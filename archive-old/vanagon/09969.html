Subject: Re: :) Irish Get-together FAQ.  (hic) 

&gt;Excuse me PJ, and you say you're Irish?????? 

100% guaranteed.  (Sez so on the label sewn on the back of my 
head.)

&gt;No Pint glasses...  no Harp??? No Guinness??? 

... no stout, no beer, no whiskey, no mead, no Smithwicks, no 
Murphy, no anything.

Gawd, but I'm a *really* boring person ...

&gt;No wonder your wipers act funny...I betcha after a few 
&gt;pints  either your wipers will appear to work 
&gt;perfectly, or you  wont give a damn about how they 
&gt;work!!   ;-)

Hmmm.  I drank a couple (two) of bottles of Miller (in honour 
of Rusty Wallace) a couple of years ago and was completely 
paralytic.  I'm afraid that I've just not got a tolerance for 
the hard stuff.  (boy, would *I* be fun if I was drunk...)  :)

Come to think of it, I'm fairly manic in my normal state.  I 
don't need to get plastered to be totally out-of-it.  Eight 
hours in front of my monitor does it for me!

If you're coming to the pizza-night-out, Ric, bring yer own 
beer.  :P

   SCHPONFIRKLE!!!
