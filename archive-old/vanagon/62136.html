Subject: Red coolant light faintly glowing (should I panic?)

Coolant light is faintly glowing--not flshing.  The temperature needle
reads normal, right in the middle--the coolant overflow and refill tanks
are both full, no visible leaks, tanks don't feel hot.  When I restarted
and brought the engine back to operating temperature, the light didn't come
back on.  Any ideas?
