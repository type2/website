 Hi,

&gt; - Is it really that hard to get mechanics that know the water-cooled engines?

 A suggestion: see if you can find a mechanic *first*. If you can, then 1)
You'll know this isn't a problem while you're home, and 2) they will be
able to help you check out any vans you are interested in.
 If you can't then you might be better to avoid the watercooled busses.

Cheers,
        W.
