With a little imagination, you could fabricate the strap.  Make sure the 
exhaust is mounted properly.  Any flexing in the system will result in pipe 
and flange cracking.  All Brackets must be there including the three pieces on 
the left of the engine.

Subject:	$70 muffler strap? 1.9L

I installed new exhaust pipe and muffler on my '84 vanagon 1.9L.

My local VW dealer quoted $68.45 for the metal strap that supports the
muffler and attaches to a bracket and bracing on the passenger side of the
engine. 

Is there a good substitute. I have it temporarily supported with &quot;plumbers
tape.&quot; 
I'm concerned about the muffler rubbing against the exhaust pipe between #2
&amp; #4 cylinders.
There is little to no clearence.

Thanks,

Scott Maurer
