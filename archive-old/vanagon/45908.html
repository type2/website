Subject: 83' Worries Me

Hey Volks,
        Well, the server was down again so I was listless for a week. Sad.
But your all back again...and there was much rejoicing.
        So over the long weekend I ventured many many km from home with a
couple freinds in search of some good camping. We decided to go west, as
usual since east doesnt offer to many options, and ended up near Jasper.
        The highway ride was fine on the way there, although I did suck up
alot more fuel due to the fact I was carrying alot of water in the tank, 3
big guys, and a helluva alot o' gear. Where I started to worry bout the van
was after I had driven a good 70 hard km down a forestry road. It started
making a distinctive 'squeek' up at the front end. I had just installed new
brakes pads a day before, but it wasnt a brake sound, it was a wheel
turning sound (for lack of a better turn). A freind suggested that it may
be a bearing thats gone the way of the do-do, or maybe just some cruds in a
bad place. Any suggestions?????
        The second day we decided to go to another camp ground, since the
people who we were meeting there were unable to get a site, and buddies
girlfreind was whiney as hell. So much to my shagrin I was forced to drive
back out the &quot;hell road&quot;, west another 100km, and then 60km down ANOTHER
forestry road. So by this time the squeek had me going absolutely insane,
and since Ive gotten back I havent been able to diagnose it since Ive been
moving into my new pad, and am still waiting for my Bentely.
        So if you know what this may be please help me.

worried and broke,
