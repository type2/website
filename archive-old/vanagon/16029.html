  Someone asked as to where to get a grease gun hypodermic needle:

  I got mine at the local FLAPS. It was with all the other grease gun 
  accessories. it is a little tube about 3 inches long, less than 1/16 inch
  in diameter. It has a zerk fitting attached to one end and is slash cut
  on the other to make it sharp.

  If anyone has a burning desire for one of these but is unable to locate one,
  I'll be happy to get them here and mail them for whatever thay cost plus 
  postage.


  Dave
