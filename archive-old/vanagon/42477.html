&gt; Today when I went to add oil to my bus ('76), I noticed a strange substance

&gt; anyone know what this is? Also, what does this mean? Is my engine filled with
&gt; peanut butter and soon to self destruct? Has anyone else ever seen this?

Seems to me that you have gotten water in your oil..  Ive seen that 
before with a engine that I was rebuilding in the backyard and forgot to 
cover it up.  It rained, sat out there for a few days and that's what ya 
get when you mix oil and water.. :)
