&gt;Hey folks,

&gt;Yosemite Valley.

Hi Chris,

I have camped in Yosemite Valley 3-4x/yr for several years, but not since
the floods.  Only some of the Valley campgrounds have been reopened, i
believe.  None has hookups.  I've never thought there was a whole lot of
difference between the campgrounds within the Valley, and have simply chosen
on the basis that only *one* accepted dogs:  Upper Pines.  The campgrounds
themselves tend to be fairly crowded most of the year, likely more so now
that some may not be open.  The main appeal IMO of Valley campgrounds is the
central location, from which to access all the wonderful features of the Park.

It should be beautiful this time of year.  Hope you have a wonderful time!

Gail
