Subject: Pucho is visiting me right now

Dear friends, I have the honor to have as a visitor the vanagon guru of
Puerto Rico, Dr. PUCHO. He brought a huge amount of information about the
lovely Vanagon (But I still love my 78 Westy :). I passed to him the inquires
I received on the 'net, let's see if we can develop a healthy relationship
between the U.S. Vangon lovers and the Puerto Rican Vanagon lovers. We'been
running today seeking for Vanagon parts and we found an 81 wrecked with a
lot of things inside for $400. Feel free to contact Pucho at (809) 265-7901 if
you need any part. Besides that I'm starting a new bussiness in Puerto Rico
called &quot;WESTFALIA CONNECTION&quot; to get exclusively parts for Westy hardware.
Most of this bussiness will be to import Westy parts from U.S. to P.R. Be
ready to hear from me.           

Be in peace,
Angel
78 Caribbean Westy           
San Juan, Puerto Rico
