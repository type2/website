Subject: Re: Big Orange Baggage To The UK

&gt;Hello All:
&gt;
&gt;I've been following for some months now, on behalf of my father.  He is the
&gt;proud owner of a '75 and an '85 Westfalia in Saint John, NB. But make him an
&gt;offer. :-)  He and Mom will be making a three(ish) month visit to England
&gt;this coming March, where they hope to tour the country side with one
&gt;excursion to the continent.  In a Westfalia.
&gt;
&gt;He has researched the cost of renting versus shipping, and is pretty much
&gt;convinced that the '75 is coming with him.  I am curious if there are other
&gt;alternatives, such as possibly a third Westfalia.  Definitely not a '95,
&gt;even though the symmetry is appealing. Probably something used.  Can anyone
&gt;advise on the state of the market in those climes?  Would a right hand drive
&gt;be comparably priced, in case he wanted to sell the '75 in England?  Any
&gt;other advice or comments I could pass on?
&gt;
I'm not up to date on the prices of Vanagons in the UK, only earlier buses. 
For a good pre-80 Westfalia (ie no rust) you would pay at least 2000 and as 
high as 4000 (we're talking pounds here) but you lose nothing in 
depreciation. Other campers such as Devons and Danburys can be cheaper but 
are usually not as well equipped. Parts are cheap and easily available, 
especially if you can live with a type 1 engine. As far as selling a LHD 
camper in the UK goes, you are in luck. Most LHD cars are not worth as much 
as similar RHD versions, but with VW campers it makes little difference. A 
lot of them are bought to tour Europe in, so LHD can be an advantage. If you 
are looking to buy a bus, especially a Vanagon, it would be cheaper, but 
more hassle, to get one in Belgium or Germany where prices are much lower. 
Plus they are LHD, in case you want to ship one home afterwards. If your 
folks are planning on only a short trip across the channel, bear in mind 
that the ferries are VERY expensive (although March is low season a return 
ticket is still at least 100 pounds) and it may be cheaper to rent a car for 
a few days in France than take your own.
Feel free to e-mail me if you have any specific questions.
