Subject: EV to Vanagon wheel swap (was Vanagon tire/wheel size)

&gt;Can someone with a EV check out the bolt pattern of the wheels, to see if
they are &gt;the same as a Vanagon?  I would like to increase the tire size on
my Vanagon and I &gt;think that EV wheels may be the trick I need.

&gt;		Thanks Eric Zeno

I seem to recall that someone answered Eric's question and that the EV
wheels do fit, but I can't find their reply in the archives.  OK, do they
fit?  Do the EV wheels and 65 series tires help crosswind stability?  Can
you still use snow chains on the back?  Has anyone actually tried this? 
Any info. on this subject would be much appreciated.
