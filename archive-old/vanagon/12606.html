Subject: Help Finding List Member

Can anyone help me with the e-mail address for Tom from NEATO?  I know he
uses his wife's address and it is something like rmarten_at_???????.

Somebody told me that there was a lot of traffic on this list during the
weekend.  C'mon let's see some of it.

Does anyone know anyone that has a pre-62 double-door panel for sale at a
reasonable price.
