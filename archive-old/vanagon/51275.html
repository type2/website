Hello, 
Isspro in Portland sells an electric servo cruise control kit for 
Vanagons complete with stalk etc. for about $200. Has anybody completed 
this installation. If so, please comment on degree of difficulty of 
installation (0-10) and the degree of funtionality of this non-factory 
installed item, again-(0-10).  '87 Vanagon-Westy.
Thanks to all
Paul Albert
