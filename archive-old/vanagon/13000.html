i am in the midst of restoring the body of my '73 bus (porsche under the
bonnet) and was wondering in anyone has seen spray masking material.  i
once saw stuff that you could spray on to mask an area, then peel off
after painting. it turned sorta rubbery when it dried.  has anyone seen
this stuff? do you have an opinion on it? it would make masking off the
windows a whole lot areas when it comes to painting time.

also, how hard is it to take it the windows out.  that seems to be another
option.

yes, incase you haven't figured it out yet, i have never done this before.

thanks
