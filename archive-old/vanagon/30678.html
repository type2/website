Subject: motor mount replacement? '81 2.0L AFC Westy

I've got some pretty abused motor mounts, one of which is no
longer bonded at the top to the engine, another one is cracked
through the middle.  But do they need replacing?  They hold the
engine up, it can't go anywhere except farther up... and it
doesn't seem like they're designed to hold it down otherwise
they would be held together by something more substantial than
glue, huh?

Also the furthermost front (FIF) end of the tranny is all shiny
from impacting the underside of the van (I guess)... does that
mean the big round tranny mount is dead?  It doesn't seem dead...
has some rotational play but no up/down play that I can readily
feel.

Any thoughts will be welcome...

Off the topic, all this talk of gas heaters is getting me
interested in junkyards... funny how that works.
