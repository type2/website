Subject: Fwd: Re: And the fund raising continues!!! Universal Money Orders
 Option

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

International Listees, other than US members:

In advance of posting my check for the List expenses, I sent an e-mail note
to Ron Lussier suggesting that international and overseas Listees could
send Universal Money Orders, available from Post Offices throughout the
world, in support of the costs of continuing the Vanagon List. 

I remember that one can buy the MO in local currency, DM, Pounds, Francs,
baht, yen, kroner,etc., send the MO to the addressee in the states, and the
US Post Office would remit in US$.  Would one of you folks in Europe or
Down Under inquire at your local PT&amp;T office to determine if that
information is still correct? 

Unlike conditions throughout the world, in the US, converting foreign
currency is a complicated, expensive, and time-consuming matter, as those
of you who have visited the States can attest.  In amounts as small as
those suggested for each member for List expenses,  the conversion fees
would just about consume the funds remitted, so Ron and Chris opted to
avoid the hassle.

The List needs your money, but more importantly, we North Americans need
your continued full participation, and for those of you who can't draft
checks (cheques) in US$, this MO suggestion may provide the method to have
us put all hands to the pumps before the List sinks because of
underfunding.

Thanks,

Ron, you sent a message a little while back saying that you did not need
anything from the European  contingent. I would still be happy to  send a
cheque for a $20 dollars, just please let me know. This list is great and I
want to help it continue in the  way that it has to the benefit of 
everyone.

&gt; Howdy Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Today's flood of donations brings the total to $662.00!  Thanks to all
who
&gt; have sent in their checks (and cash).  We still have a long way to go, so
&gt; if you've been putting off sending in your contribution, please go write
a
&gt; check.  Like so many folks have said, the list is well worth hundreds of
&gt; dollars of free advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Many folks are writing checks for $10-$25, and these large donations are
&gt; very appreciated (Thanks!)  If everyone on the list only writes a check
for
&gt; $5, we'll have enough to keep the list going.
&gt; 
&gt; Write checks to &quot;Ron Lussier&quot; and send them to:
&gt;      Vanagon
&gt;      c/o Ron Lussier
&gt;      10164 Parkwood Drive #8
