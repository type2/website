By definition they are un-polarized. Only with regular electrolytic
capacitors do you
have to watch  the + and -.&quot;

Except for special non-polorized electrolytics used in audio applications,
or perhaps for very low value (under 1 microfarad) I believe that  ALL
tantalum capacitors ARE polarized, and that it is necessary to pay attention
to polarity upon installation.  Remember that polarity is relative -- i.e.
the &quot;+&quot; terminal goes to a wire whose voltage is higher than the wire that
the &quot;-&quot; terminal goes to, it doesn't necessarily have to be ground, just
lower than the &quot;+&quot;  wire (IN TERMS OF POLARITY, NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU, FOR
WHATEVER REASON, HAVE SELECTED THE RIGHT TWO TERMINALS THAT YOU WANT TO HOOK
UP TO !!!)
