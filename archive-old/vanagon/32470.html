Subject: RE: the all euro engine swap

CIS fuel injection makes for an easy engine swap because all you have to
give it is 12v -- no electronics are involved at all, so that's a plus
for the Volvo V6 as an engine swap candidate.  OTOH, I don't think a V6
is as good a configuration as a flat engine, all other things being 
equal.  In particular, if the additional height needed doesn't fall
within the area of the engine lid, you have to get serious with the
Sawzall.  

Porsche makes 125hp out of just 2.2liters (911T) but a 71 Porsche engine
probably means more emissions hassles than a Volvo engine from the
same or later year as the Vgon you put it in.

My poor 6cyl Vgon hasn't seen the latest snow yet.  About 26in. fell
in the driveway, which drifted to 4 feet, which I then increased to
5 feet when I shovelled the roof to keep the gutters from backing up.
To clear the driveway I'll need to wait for the thaw, or else do a
shovelling fitness video.

Only recent car project was rigging a (CIS) fuel injector tester using
air pressure rather than pump pressure.  Works.  Since, unlike the
fuel pump, the tank pressure is silent, you can listen to the injector
when it's off and hear any leaking.  Have to wait for a 30+ degree day,
tho'.  Even tho' I use mineral spirits rather than gas, highly atomized
solvent shouldn't share the garage with the propane heater, unless I
view the garage as kindling for a Bradleyesque use of my engine blocks.
