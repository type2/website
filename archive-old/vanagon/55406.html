I had the chance to see this 'promo' EV VR6 too but in Solitude Ski Area in OOtah
a week or so ago at the SIA demo days.  Fine example of interesting see through
mountain scenes on the windows done with a mesh of tiny holes.  The scene flows
across the windows and onto the body of the van, looks striking.

Yep them wuz Vuh'mont plates too.
