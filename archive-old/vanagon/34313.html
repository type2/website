Subject: Late Split VDO Clocks...

Impressive German ingenuity...

The VDO (Kenzle) clock.  I took this puppy apart last night.  Some sand grains
were found in the casing.  I got it to werk almost for about 50% of its
&quot;stroke&quot;.  THis is where the ingenuity comes in.  It appears to me the 
clock operates via a contact (point) system similar (visually) to the
points in the distributor).  As the clock ticks along the gap between these
&quot;points&quot; lessens until current is transmitted across the gab to reset a lever
 (for lack of a better word) against a tension spring. The lever and spring
unit becomes engaged into a gear which provides the potential energy for the
intricacies of this clock... And the gap closes..
