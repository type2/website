Subject: List Bumper Sticker?


I've frequently been on the road in Cassie ('89 Westy GL), seen another
brick/breadloaf (I try to avoid EVs!), and wondered, &quot;Is that a list
member?&quot; Could it be Joel, off wandering through CA looking for an
elusive part? Or Martha out looking for a 12V automatic plaid awning?
Or someone on the way to a &quot;gathering&quot; of listheads? My mind and
imagination wanders (and my wife, Leslie, gives me strange looks...)

So, has anybody thought of coming up with some kind of identification
badge that can be placed on our vehicles to identify us as members of
&quot;THE list&quot;?

I'm sure we could come up with some unique, politically correct, etc.
phrase that could be put on a bumper sticker to identify us as
listheads.  Then, if you're driving around and see a *potential*
listhead, you can follow up on your hunch by looking for the bumper
sticker. In fact, if you carry extra bumper stickers, you can hand them
out (or leave them on windshields) to try to recruit more members to
the list.

If there is interest, I'd be willing to (try to) coordinate by
determining the cost of generating bumper stickers (or whatever),
soliciting phrases from list members, organizing a vote to choose the
phrase, etc.

Actually, I prefer the &quot;window&quot; stickers (with clear backing, applied
to the inside of a window) to conventional bumper stickers to avoid the
eventual erosion of the regular stickers until only some strange gummy
residue remains. I could cost out both types of stickers.

I'm thinking of something that is fairly inconspicuous - not large
(perhaps like those &quot;I visited Yellowstone&quot; decals that people collect)
that might be mounted at the same place on each vehicle so we'd all
know where to look for the sticker.

Initial phrase ideas?:	Listhead On Board
			Luke, Follow The List
			

(Ok, I admit, those were dorky....)

The layout might look like:
