Subject: Anyone have a color scanner?

I was wondering if there are any of you in the Los Angeles area that have
access to a color scanner.  I am looking to scan in some of my own pictures
and some images from my VW literature collection to share and for my web page
(whenever I get around to it).  Unfortunately I am not able to offer
financial compensation at thsi time (I'm unemployed at the moment), but would
be willing to share any duplicates in my collection for your troubles.
 Please respond directly via email.

Thanks,
Ryan
