Subject: Re: HELP advise on purchase of '70 camper
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 95 13:14:31 EST

&gt; Bart wants to buy this bus:
&gt; 
&gt; etc, 1970 camper in OK shape for $1000.

I agree with others, no way this is worth it, probably with that
rust it actually has far more and is at least 136k maybe 236k not
worth over $500 and that would be if the interior top and the rest
is fairly incredible for origional 1970 condition.

For instance I just bought a true 68,000 '71 Westy with genuinely
no rust, old guy used it in summer only, that had just taken a slight
deer hit bruising the front, but all recors since new etc. Engine with
good compression in all cylindrers and good oil pressure for $350.

This was in WV, king of the salt belters IMHO, they are out there
just look a while longer.
