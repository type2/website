Subject: Removed Vanagon Heads

A few weeks ago I was faced with the same problem that you have and had
resolved to fix it in the same manner that you have decided on, which was to
fix the problem without removing the engine, and to find a machine shop that
could refinish the heads.  Unfortunately, neither of these decisions are
practical.  

By leaving the engine in you will inevitabley run into problems.  Having
broken the seals and gaskets of the head and cylinders you are virtually
forced into replacing them with new ones.  This means removing the cylinders
and pistons.  Giving consideration to such concerns as removing wrist pins,
compressing rings, poor lighting, restricted work area, all the while
working in a prone position, the only proper way of doing this job is with
the engine remove.  As it turned out in my case, not only had the heads
corroded, but also the engine block.  The degree of corrosion became more
obvious after putting the engine on the bench.      

In regards to the heads, any planing of the head surface must by matched
exactly with the planing of both cylinder bosses on the head.  The degree of
sophistication required to do this is far beyond that of the average engine
refinisher.  In addition, it is not at all uncommon to find minute cracks on
the heads, in particular around the valve surfaces, making head refinishing
a mute point.

I'm sure these comments are not what you wanted to hear, however considering
the time and effort that you are about to invest in the project, it would be
a shame to see it go to waste by cutting corners.  Good luck.
