&gt; &gt; I've got a friend who wants &quot;in&quot; to the Westie game and has been
&gt; &gt; scouting for a while. He spotted an '83 with 76K miles, good shape,
&gt; &gt; summer car, no rust (repainted), fridge, stove, aux heater. The PO
&gt; &gt; claims no problems. He is asking $7900.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Price sources that I have consulted only go back to '87. Anybody have
&gt; &gt; any info on a fair price for this vehicle? Anyone bought or sold one
&gt; &gt; around that year recently?
&gt; 
&gt; In my experience, this price is quite high.  At least here in the Philly
&gt; area, a very clean (but not mint) '83 water-cooled Westy would be worth
&gt; maybe $5000, perhaps less.

I paid 5000.00 for mine (83.5) with 70k.  Very good condition.  Price
seems very high.
