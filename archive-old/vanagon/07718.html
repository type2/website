Hi All,
This is my first post, Yay!, and I just have a couple of quick questions.
I have a '59 Kombi and it's my first bus. So far I've only seen        
references to Bentley manuals for '63 to '67. I've got the idiot book
already (I use it a LOT too :-) but I like the bentley manuals for
some of the specific stuff. Is this manual valid for my model, except
for maybe the bullet turn signals? 
Also, I am replacing the engine in the bus. It had a '57 1200 sitting
in the back seat when I got it(and it still turns even) but I decided I
might want to get on a highway someday so anyway, what's the story on
the flywheels, I seem to remember this coming up before, but I may have
missed a crucial part, Are the 12 and 6 volt flywheels the same size? I
know that the teeth are different, ergo if you have a 12 volt flywheel,
you have a 12 volt starter to fit it, but are the diameters the same, or
will a 12 volt flywheel machine my transmission for me?
BTW, I like grits! Thx in advance!
