&gt;If people are closed minded about this so much they should be driving M.B.
&gt;or Volvo's, both Hot V.W. and VW trends are sources of ideas, not laws on
&gt;HOW volkswagons are to be built


First off, get it right it's spelled V-O-L-K-S-W-A-G-E-N.....not
volkswagon...

Secondly, the only thing that Hot VWs and VW Trends (aka VW T&amp;A) are sources
for are advertising-slanted editorial content which is written at a 6th
grade level and is covered up with plenty of Tits and Ass shots of blonde,
big boobed bikini bimbos...basically these magazines are written for the
average 13 year old mastibatory motorhead.....obviously from your spelling,
punctuation and enfatuation with Hot VWs and VW T&amp;A you are one of them.

Perhaps the problem is that you have arrived on this list years after the
rest of us have dismissed these rags as primitive, irrelevant and poorly
written.

Oh BTW, regarding your comments about M.B. and Volvos (not as you put it in
the possessive Volvo's) I don't drive either one of those marques....I've
owned, driven, repaired, etc. VWs for over 28 years...currently I own a '56
beetle which I've owned for 22 years and a 93 EV/MV which was purchased
new...

What's your claim to fame and expertise?

Ric
