Subject: Loose stub axle?

OK, no more lurking -- here's the reason I signed up for this rash of
experts. Last March I
greased  the CV joints on my 78 Westy. As I was lowering the drive shaft, I
happened to bump
into the right wheel assembly and was mucho surprised to see the whole thing
ease outboard
with the slightest push. Sensing right away that this wouldn't do, I grabbed
for John's procedures.
Seeking utter confusion, I also consulted Mr. Bentley. I don't need to tell
you that this never
happened to them at their CV parties. While reinstalling the CV's I pushed
everything back
togedda just like I found it and everything seems to be working so far (he
said as he fell past the
thirteeth floor). I feel the lack of something important in my wheel hub
bearing assembly. Am I
courting disaster here? Will Westy fail 20 miles the other side of  No.
Veedubdoc? Tune in
