Subject:      Re: 83.5 Trans grinds into reverse?

&gt; &gt; Finally, I didn't adjust the clutch. But if it were a clutch adjustment
&gt; &gt; problem, wouldn't it grind into forward gears as well?
&gt; &gt;
Nope.

&gt; &gt; Any ideas?
&gt; &gt; TIA

It's posts like this that make me glad I have an automatic.  Think you
need to adjust clutch.
