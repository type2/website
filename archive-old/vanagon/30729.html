Subject: 79 Bus -- running at last!!!

Finally, after TWELVE WEEKS at my local v.w. &quot;specialist,&quot; I've gotten my
'79 Cal bus back.  If anyone remembers, this was the bargain bus I bought
for $200 from a non-v.w. dealer.  At the time it was not running and I was
told the f.i. system was seriously messed up (&quot;brain&quot; missing.)  As it
turned  out, all the parts WERE there, but the Electronic Control Unit was
fried and some of the injectors were improperly installed (it had been
sitting in the lot for six months when I bought it.  The dealer, no
Einstein, told me it was a '76; I only found out weeks later when he finally
gave me the title that it was actually a '79.)

After waiting nearly three months for a cheap, reconditioned ECU to pop up
(boy, did we try. . _dot_called various places, checked junkyards, wandered
parking lots at night with a screwdriver [just kidding 'bout that one]). .
.the garage finally gave up and decided to go with a carb conversion
instead, though he initially advised me against it. (?)  It would be cheaper
and simpler, he claimed.  Oh well.

The final tally: $1,331.16.  The carb itself only accounted for $350 + 150
(labor) of the total.  Here's the rest.  How's it look to anyone?  Fair/unfair?

009 Dist            79.50
120 Coil            24.90
plug wires        41.50
plugs                  8.00
carb kit           350.00
fuel line            25.00
oil                        8.00
oil filter               7.95
dipstick boot    4.95  (was broken)
valve gaskets   2.50
throttle cable    4.95  (original wasn't long enough)
mt41 battery    71.95  (ain't that a lot for a battery?)
ground strap  15.00
ignit. switch   21.90
brake fluid        8.90

LABOR        $600.00
Tax                    54.16
TOTAL       $1331.16

With what I paid for the bus ($200), the total is about $1500 bucks or so
for a fairly decent '79 bus, good vinyl seating, good body, very little
rust, and about 70,000 miles (if accurate.)  So-so.
