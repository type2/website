Subject: Oil temp data, sender adaptors, (long)

	Volks,
	Sean's got his oil temp sender in and wonders about reasonable
oil temperatures. I've been reading the Corrado list as well as this
one and the good ol' boys there routinely report 220-240 in their
waterpumpers- at a recent gathering, temps as high as 300 were spotted
during 'racing' conditions.
	It seems reasonable to compare values measured in common units
in a similar application. I see 210-230 degree F oil temps in my Corrado
all the time. One of these days I'll get MY oil temp sender installed
and have type II data to compare.

	Bob Hoover suggests an adaptor that replaces the plug which 
&quot;closes  off the drilled passage that supplies oil from the sump to the 
oil pump inlet.&quot; This is specific to upright engines, but would certainly 
be a neater solution than the sump plate location.

	He thoughtfully adds:
&quot;J. C. Whitney provides an adapter that matches the threads of the
slotted plug (13-xx-9267-A, $4).  The adapter is internally
threaded to accept the standard oil temperature sender
(12-xx-6195-Y, $8) that matches their electric oil temperature
gauge (12-xx-6193-T, $17).&quot;

	This doesn't tell me whether it works with the VDO sender
(and gauge) I already bought... guess I might as well order the adaptor
and find out!


	Here's some actual data relating to oil temp from our past which 
I've saved for reference, edited:

 According to one of the technical reps. at Pennzoil, 180 degrees F is too
 cold. The explanation for this is that some oil contaminants &lt;acids and the
 like&gt; need to be heated to near the boiling point of water to be moved along.
 According to these folks, oil should be 210 to 230 degrees F.

 I am not, however, going to suggest that everyone who has lower oil temps go
 out and raise them. 180F seems to be a common temperature for healthy type
 1 engines. It is probably a good idea to change one's oil frequently to
 remove contaminants that may accumulate but most folks do this anyway since
 stock type I engines don't have an oil filter either.
 
 Stock type IV engines appear to have a &quot;normal&quot; oil temperature that's higher,
 up around 210F. This shouldn't be too much of a mystery since the air flaps
 thermostat is also 30 degrees higher &lt;190F vs. 160F&gt;. The type IV engine was
 designed 30 or so years later than the type I and motor oil had improved a
 lot in the meantime.

Well, finally got my oil temp sender in - luckily on the 2L engines they
fit right into the drain plug - no need to drill a hole in the plate.
15 minute test ride showed that with head temp _at_ 500F my oil temp was
barely over 210F. So I guess that's good. I wish the gauge had a mark at 225F
or something - but 230F is straight up  on it so I guess that's easy enough
to see. (Maybe I'll put some red dots on each gauge so the passenger can
warn me in case I'm too busy driving to notice.)

I am glad you get the same kind of reading as me with a Single port 1600 in a
70 westy. When it gets real hit (over 90) and I am on the freeway it always
runs just over 250.

   I'm in a '76 Westy and if the temp gets over 230, I'm lookin' for a shady
spot to rest for  a while... last year I took it down south to the beach, got
the oil light on AS I coasted into a parking space: zero oil! walked to the
market and bought several quarts. Runnin' a little hot that day, I guess... had
it brought closer to spec _at_ the mechanic, now it runs below 200 (knock wood)
and we're both happy...

I made my own gauge, and I put the upper limit at 250.  I have never had the
opportunity to run over 200.

I think that it should be noted that it seems that T4 engines always run
hotter than the T1's.  If my 1600 went to over 220, I'd be real concerned.
My personal opinion is that heat comes from poorly built engines.  Bad
line-bores and unbalanced parts don't help either.  I wonder if anyone has
ever really tested the VDO gauge to see if it's accurate.  I sat by the
stove and simply went 20 deg. increments and marked the scale.  I know it's
right.

          when my bus was running (&amp; it will again SOON) my oil temp
          gauge read right around 180, except when stuck in traffic
          for any length of time when it would go to 210 or so.
          almost never to 250 (scary).  this was a 1600 SP in a '66
          kombi in central florida (no cool ocean breeze) 90+F.  the
          trick was installing a deep sump pan years ago.  it lowered
          the temp by 20-30 degrees.  no fooling.  will use this sump
          on my new motor when it arrives (SOON, i tell you).
