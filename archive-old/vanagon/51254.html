I have the following interior pieces for sale:

Westfalia pop-top and roof rack, no canvas, fair/poor condition.
  This is the pre-73 style with the rear roof rack and the top that
  hinges at the front.  Pop-top seal is present.  Roof rack needs
  resto.  Fiberglass undamaged, but dirty.  If you want this top, I'll
  probably throw it in free if you buy my...

Westfalia interior, good condition.
  This is also the early-bay style interior, with the large cabinet on
  the right hand side behind cargo door, rear seat folds out into bed
  with foam pad over engine compartment, middle seat facing backwards
  behind drivers seat, table folds down against driver's side wall.
  Sorry, there's no sink/icebox cabinet.  A couple rips in the lovely
  yellow-naugahyde upholstery, no show-stoppers though (IMHO--although
  I admit to not knowing much about Westy paraphenalia.)

Location: Princeton, NJ.  Contact me at &lt;boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com&gt;
or phone (609) 497-0048.  It may not be the greatest thing since
sliced bread, but I think the interior would make a nice &quot;weekender&quot;
package for a retro-westy project, or do it up right and use the pop-top
to convert a sunroof!
