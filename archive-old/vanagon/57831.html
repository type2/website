 Hey,
 For the plastic covers on the outside electrical and water access try:
 
 Euro-American RV Products
 (818)760-4214
 You can leave a message or call him between 9am and 11 am PST M-F when he's 
 actually in the office.  This guy has almost everything you'll need to 
 restore a Westy including the pieces you require (no curtains).  He was 
 the original supplier for the VW on these Westy pieces.
 
 Good luck,
 
 Perry

Unfortunately, you must buy the entire unit at $49.95 + $4.__  for the
gasket.  Does anyone have just the doors and hinge pin?
