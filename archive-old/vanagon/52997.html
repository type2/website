&gt;      ~Will my automatic last? (99,000 miles)

Well I have just driven 100 miles in an 1984 GL auto that's done over
180,000 miles and it seems to be fine both in traffic and on the motorway.

&gt;      ~When I start it sometimes it takes a second for anything to happen,

&gt;      normal?

I found this on the above vehicle - more like half a second though. I don't
know if its normal.
