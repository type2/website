Subject: re died, barely runs

Well, this is even more of a puzzler. I went out today and it started right up.
Then, after a couple of minutes, it started running rough, and tried to die.
I kept the idle speed up around 2K and just held it there with my hand
while looking around at things - trying to see if anything was missing,
loose, leaking, etc. All looked fine.  Eventually, after say 4-5 minutes,
it would idle again. It sputtered once or twice more, but once it got warm
it stayed running fine. ????

Unfortunately, what with the shortened days I had a bunch of yardwork to
take care of while it was still light. Now I'm done, and may head out to
the garage yet tonight.

Oh, while inspecting the EGR valve, I discovered that the pipe feeding the
EGR valve doesn't exist once it goes under the engine. Someone removed the
damn thing! I guess this vehicle will never live in California - I'm
surprised that it passed emissions inspection in King County - which is
where I bought it from! (Unless perhaps they leaned out the mixture so
reduce CO emissions, which may have actually been the original cause for it
to overheat! Just a theory.)
