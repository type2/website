Subject: Oil O-ring Saga

The dealer came good for this! I am E-mailing from intensive care unit 
recovering from shock. Parts + repair + flatbed tow covered so far, and a 
compression check, 120-130 psi all round, adequate, not great, for 115K Km. 
Starts and runs normally, so no damage hopefully. Dealer is also picking up 
tab for new dash printed circuit 'board' which caused the oil light not to 
function. 
Will miracles never cease? Remember this was a used vehicle, 8 years old!
