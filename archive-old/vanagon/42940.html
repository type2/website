Subject: bug screen ffrom dealer

i was told that the back hatch bug screen was available from the vw dealer.
 this was by someone at my bus club in Seattle.   If you want one, i would
call up your local dealer.    or someone's favourite dealer in the vanagon
archives.  

sorry if this is a wild goose chase, just passing on information.
