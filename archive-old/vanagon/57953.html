&lt;&lt; Chris, which offset -&gt; ETxx ? Vanagon Originals are 6Jx15H2 ET30. &gt;&gt;

actually, Vanagon alloys are  6Jx14 H2  - not 15...  but anyway, my whole
purpose was to see if those new 5 spoke alloys off the new Audi A4/A6/A8
would fit on a Vanagon. 
they're 16 inchers, but, here's the specs.

Audi &quot;A series&quot; 5 spoke alloy wheel:
7Jx16 H2 ET 37
Now,  will this wheel fit a Vanagon??
