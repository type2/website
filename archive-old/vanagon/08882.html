&gt;&gt;   I must admit I myself have been tempted more than once during the long,
&gt;&gt;   slow climb to work, to put a brick on the gas pedal, a bungie cord on
&gt;&gt;   the steering wheel, and wander aft to pour myself a cup of coffee!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;You mean we're NOT supposed to do THAT !?!?!?!????
&gt;(what do you expect from an immigrant type :-)

well ... :)  there WAS the story about the young rich middle-easterner who,
upon coming to live in southern california, spent some of his father's
oil-gotten gains &lt;gad, i love a pun!&gt; on a rather large and extravagant
Winnebago-mobile. and, upon reaching the speed limit on the highway, set
the cruise control and went back to the refrigerator to get something cool
to drink (not beer, of course. it's forbidden) ... the resulting wreck, they
say, involved about 20 cars.;)     he thought it was an auto-pilot.  :)

and you wonder why the owner's manuals keep getting thicker and thicker and
thicker ... ;)
