Hi All, 

I just purchased a '70 westy which appears to be all stock and am having
this acceleration problem... this is whats up-  idles fine, top rpms
fine, when upshifting I loose all power, rpms drop way down, almost to a
lug. Going up a grade is the worst. If I'm just upshifting on a flat I
make the shift and very gradually depress the pedal I can keep her
moving but if I make shift and get right on the pedal there's  nothing
there...  All this doesn't seem as bad when the engine is cold, I'm
guessing that's because the choke is still on???
I'm going to try another carb tonight. Fuel pump??  Dist advance??? 

Probably something simple... anybody have a quick fix?
Thanks, 
RJ.
