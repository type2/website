-- Your message was:   (from &quot;wabbott_at_townshend.corp.megatest_dot_com&quot;)
          Former Owner and I are going to have to talk about
  the significant lack of engine tin and accesories.....

          Having taken consultation, I'm then going to call the people
  who sell turn-key engines and see what a complete, fits in an empty
  engine bay, 1970 1600 single-port will cost me....
  (The Bus Stop's prices for tin are breath-taking- $230 for the
  upright fan shroud!)....


Howdy!

 Why not just buy a blown up 71 dual port engine for the parts (shrouds,
stands, manifold, etc.) and then buy a really nice long block DP?  It
would be a lot cheaper than a complete turn-key.  Wouldn't a 71 engine fit
into 70 bay?

Nick


P.S.  Many thanks to many, many people on rec.auto.vw that responded to my
cry for help regarding an air-cooled vw net!!!!
