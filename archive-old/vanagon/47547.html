In a message dated 96-07-26 15:33:14 EDT, you write:

&gt;i have a super bright , jumbo LED that reqires 2.6v _at_ 50ma
&gt;
&gt;how do i figure the resistance of the dropping resistor for a 12v 
&gt;source?

Figuring that your 12V source is really around 13V, heres the scoop:

13V less 2.6V is 10.4V dropped across the resistor.  Since the current you
desire is 50mA (.05 Amps) and R=V/I, you have: Resistance = R=10.4/.05 = 208
ohms.

It's not too critical that you get exactly 208 ohms.  Somewhere in the 200 to
220 ohm range will work o.k.

Good luck,
