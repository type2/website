Subject: Vanagon Body Skirts

Does anyone know of a supplier (preferably Canadian) for lower body 
skirting kits for an 89 Vanagon? My uncle has an 89 Westy, and has 
seen some very nice side and front skirts which match the factory 
bumpers well - this was on a California Westy, and we haven't been 
able to find a source for them.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
