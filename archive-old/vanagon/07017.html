Subject: Re: Berg short-shift for Vgon


	Well I don't have the short shifter and my tank is fine, but did 
you say you have a six cylinder vanagon?  I know that there were some 
&quot;factory&quot; ones produced (late 80's ?), but I didn't think any made it here.
	I would be interested to know if there are any factory 6cyl 
vanagons running around the US.  
	Does any one know the specs for such a van?  Or even for a retro fit?
Sometimes, no all the time, I fantasize on those long up hills that I 
have a 3.0L 911 in the back.  But then when I get over the top, I forget 
about that and simply enjoy my Westy and the great view of the wild west.

	BTW, The real reason for this post;  How much improvement does 
the short shift give?  And wouldn't that simply beat the syncros?  (maby 
only in my old 82)
	
	Thanks/cheers Walt.  82 Westy,  71 2002
