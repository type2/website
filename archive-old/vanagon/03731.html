For removing tie rod ends and ball joints, I've only had luck with
the long forked devices that you pound on with a hammer.

I got push-out device from J.C. Whitney;  there's a bolt that you 
turn that's supposed to push out the joint (pushing on the bolt end
of the joint), while a forked part is supposed to hold on to the 
end of the tie rod.  Problem is, the fork part just slips off.  And 
when I managed to make it stay in place, the bolt in the device just
bent!  I replaced it with a stronger bolt, but it still just slipped
out of place.  When I use the long fork and a small sledge, the tie
rod end just pops out on the first blow (but I've only done this after
giving up on keeping the tie rod end, since I've torn the boot).

Why can't they make replaceable rubber boots for these things?

Has anyone had luck with 2- or 3-armed gear pullers?  I've always had
problems with these things slipping off, but haven't tried them with 
ball joints or tie rod ends.
