I agree about reliability. If it comes to a decision between reliability
and hp, don't let the kid inside vote!

If you had the luxury of time, building a 2.0 l from an 1.8 l by
increasing the stroke and installing the adjustable cam gear would be my
idea of a real world compromise. I think (and local teenage Golf
enthusiasts might verify), that this would give you the low end torque and
drivability required for the syncro.

I do remember seeing a Vanagon diesel oilpan lying on the ground the last
time I was at the junkyard, I'll give them a call. You know, that pan is
really a nice casting, (boy am I getting eccentric, admiring oil pans!).
