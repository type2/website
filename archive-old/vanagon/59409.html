&lt;&lt; 1: Is there really supposed to be a bed in the '87 Vanagon GL? It says
that
 there is in the manual, and there is a small mattress in the back, but I
 just don't see how anyone could be expected to actually sleep there. 
 
 2: Exactly what is the purpose of having a rear passanger seat (3-person)
 that can be propped-up? Is this supposed to be some kind of storage and
 noting else? &gt;&gt;

sure, it's quite comfortable to sleep back there.....
just curl up in a fetal position....  :&lt;)

jeez, and I paid 400 for my weekender interior, as my van didn't have that
option....

Of course, if you look into this for yourself, read the manual, and try it,
you would have known your van had the weekender option where the middle
seatback is split and folds forward, and the rear bench folds  down into a
sofabed, and there is actually MORE sleeping space than in a Westy. And yes,
the bottom of the seat lifts up for storage.

stick your left hand in that little slot in the kickpanel under the back seat
and pull up and forward on the seatbottom at the same time your right hand is
pulling up and forward on the handle that is in the center of behind the
seatback. 

Viola!
weekender.

Of course, it woulda been rather amusing to see you sqwunched up in a little
ball trying to sleep in that little space behind the back seat.....  :&lt;)

seek, and ye shall find...
