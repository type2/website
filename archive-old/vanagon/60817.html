Malcom:
	I can not help you with the V/C part. My engine lid was 
marine grade plywood (5/8&quot;).  I have since replaced it and the slats. The
PO
had left a huge, heavy rubber mat on the bed for protection which had
the affect of rotting all the wood. I made  a rig for my table saw 
that reproduced them(slats) out of one-by-twos.  
 	As far as tarp and roll cage, my dealer gave the impression 
he could order them.
	We love our crewcab. I believe it to be the most versatile
vehicle in the US (except maybe for an AWD crewcab!).
	As for the price , I two regular crewcabs going for 
$12.5k about three years ago.

Good Luck

P.S. I tried to send this to your personal email address but it
boomeranged in cyber space.
