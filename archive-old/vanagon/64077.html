Subject: A/C water dumping on back seat

Hi All,

Just wondering if any of you have noticed their A/C dripping *alot* after
driving long periods.  After driving for 4 to 8 hours in hot temperatures,
say over 100 deg, our '85 Westi A/C seems to rain water down (or, at least
I think it's water -- didn't seem greasy or smell weird).  The amount of
water seemed to be too much to be explained by condensation as suggested
by the VW repair guy.  Perhaps this indicates some kind of service or
cleaning is in order?  Idea's much appreciated, as usual!

Thanks,
Ivan
