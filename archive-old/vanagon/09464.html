Subject:  WARNING!! 91 VANAGON AC DUCTs STILL FALL !!

I had my 91 Vanagon in a year ago for the Recall Campaign for
a Fix to ensure that the Overhead AC ducts would not fall down, causing injury...
Well today
 as my wife and kids were about to leave in it for the store...
the center AC Duct came crashing down on my 3year old Injuring her leg.....
It appears that VWs fix does not work...I examined the aftermath and looks like
the plastic retainers holding it to the ceiling cracked, causing it to come down....Has any body else had this occur to them?? Even after the Recall to fix it??
I called VWs Customer service....a machine...left a message...and will most likely cointact their product general councel too.....

Watch your heads folks...John.
