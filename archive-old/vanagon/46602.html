Subject: Calling Mid-Atlantic Syncronauts

I got a call last night from a fellow from the Capital Area Four 
Wheelers -Jeep types- who had happened onto the Syncro Westie Page. 

They are going out to the Range Rover Test Area Sunday morning and 
invited us to join them.  This will be just after Bertha dumps something 
like four inches of rain on us, so it should be some good messy
fun!

Time is 10:45AM. The Range Rover Test Area is east of the Washington DC 
Beltway, off Route 301, south of Route 214.  301 is a divided highway
there, and best (only?) access is from the southbound lanes. South on 
301, after you cross 214, turn right on the first paved road, vaguely 
half a mile south of the 214/301 Interchange. Nearby, as a landmark, 
there is an old motel, converted to an antique shop on the left. You 
are turning into a little stub of a street, set up as access to a failed 
office park development or the like. Where the street ends, the Test 
Area begins.

You can let me know if you are coming, or just show up. Syncro-curious 
listmembers are welcome to come out and ride along. 
 
Bring your mud-boots.

Tom F.
