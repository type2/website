&gt; Best that I can tell, the most expeditious route is: go north.
&gt; Seems that our northern neighbors (Canadians) have most of them.

Or you could join NEATO, then you would already have the ad which
reads:

For Sale: 85 Crew Cab, 4-speed, exc. gates, bed.  Small dings,
dents, runs exc. Offers. Dave &amp; Michelle, Ontariro, Canada.

Since the NEATO members already got theirs in the snail mail, I
suppose I can include the phone number:  (519) 432-4958.
