Subject: Campers: Request for General Information


I'm another newbie who's joined the list before buying. In my case, I'm
looking to buy a bread-loaf camper, probably a 75-78 based on what I've
learned so far.

Thanks to J. Walker, I have a file that describes the changes made to each
model year of bus (that information is what leads me to want a 75-78
bread-loaf). That file doesn't contain any camper-specific information, and
when I asked him, he told me he didn't have that kind of info and I should go
to the group.

Do any of you have a file containing information about different camper
&quot;models&quot;, and what equipment was actually included with each? I guess I'm
mostly interested in the second generation buses, but I'm curious about
earlier and later models.
