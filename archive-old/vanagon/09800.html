&gt;Oh, and I had the ONLY split window bus at the campout, so I hope that
&gt;Thom makes it to the next one.  Besides... I want to see his '56.  I'll 
&gt;even give him some prunes if he wants 'em.

And I want to make it to one too, so that everyone doesn't think this bus
is a figmentof my imagination!

May be should have -regular_ camping trips!
