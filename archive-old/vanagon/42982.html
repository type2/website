How true.  Last December when my brother and I took the engine out of our 
72 beetle to put on the new single pack, we took the opportunity to not 
only double hose clamp every fitting, but we took glavanized picture 
hanging wire and did the aviation thing and made sure that all hoses are 
physically attatched to whatever they are hooked too.  I cringe at the 
thought of having to take off any hoses cause they are really anchored 
good, however, the nuisance is null compared to what could happen if the 
hoses weren't &quot;aviated&quot; on to their fittings...
