The Inuvik Run -- At Dawson City

July 28

0550, 28 July 1996.  (At Frenchman's Lake)

Eddie Heintz is our resident Walton.  Within instants of his
arrival at any place at all he is lashing Canadian waters with
Texas zeal.  This can be embarrassing if we happen to be in an RV
park.  The nearest geezer is liable to find a Jitterbug
expertly dropped into his cup of Bovril.

At Frenchman's Lake Eddie's spinning gear happened to snag a
thing with an under-slung jaw having more teeth than a barracuda. 
I say snagged because everything else he hooked simple bit thru
the line and swam off.  Up here steel leaders are the rule. 
Eddie is using bare monofilament.

Eddie called the ugly thing a pike but it looked like a barracuda
to me.  Eddie killed the thing and promptly ate it.

Frenchman Lake is a fishing camp.  There are some fire rings and
picnic tables but the main business here is fishing.  There is a
launching ramp and dock but no firewood and you must provide your
own toilet paper when you make the hike to the outhouse. 
Drinking water is drawn from the lake, a large sign cautions you
to boil it.  The boat ramp and small floating dock are in good
repair and there's evidence the lake is chock full of trout.  And
barracuda. 

It is five past six and it is cold.  I'm the only one awake. 
I've been up for an hour.  Although I am not the oldest member of
the convoy I appear to have the oldest kidneys.  And the most
battered bod.  After the fourth day of driving my kidneys nudge me
awake every three hours or so.  By the time the second nudge
rolls around, my back is warning me to get up and stretch out the
kinks or take the consequences.  I've brought my cane and a
lavish supply of Ace bandages, worry that I may have need of
them.  The worry is not an idle one.  Among my many skeletal
injuries are a fused vertebrae, a bad knee, a bad elbow and a bad
shoulder.  On top of that is various damage to the musculature. 
I've enough scars to play the lead in an Ann Rice flick.  My days
begin and end with chemical stews.

The driving caught up to me at Moberly Lake, where I awoke so
stiff and sore I could barely stand.  A few early risers at
 saw me doing my clumsy tai-chi.  I Gathered The
Plums and did Cutting The Corn until I was limber enough to risk
more violent Occidental exercises.  The folks who saw me
limbering up wore startled expressions, probably from my state of
undress.  You can't stretch very well wearing levis and boots but
they do tend to foil the mosquitos.  Since Moberly Lake I've
limited my unkinking exercises to walking, stretching and
isometrics, all while fully dressed.

Living is a physical experience, however painful it may be.  If
you are not physically active, you're not really alive.  I am
alive!  Beat up and gimpy, but alive.

Breakfast was my usual oatmeal with honey, washed down with cocoa
instead of coffee.  I've been away from home ten days and have
run out of real coffee.  There is some freeze-dried stuff and I
will drink it when I have to but it is too gross to face in the
morning, when you need the aroma of coffee as much as the heat
and stimulation.

Our numbers have swelled by two.  Last evening I met Sue Booth, a
geologist turned film maker who chanced across us at Laird Hot
Springs.  My early to bed, early to rise schedule caused me to
miss her at the hot springs.  Sue is touring Canada in a blue
diesel-powered Vanagon accompanied by a big black dog and an
assortment of cameras and video equipment, some of which is
mounted on the dashboard of her Vanagon permitting her to film as
she drives.  She adopted the idea of driving to Inuvik and joined
the convoy on their run to Faro.  Last evening she came over and
introduced herself, mentioning that she too is the proud owner of
a 1965 Microbus.  I hope it's in better condition than my old
wreck.   I applauded her wisdom in choosing the diesel powered Westy
for her trans-Canadian odyssey.  

Alaskan Dave, whose Syncro comes equipped with a canoe, is the
second recruit.  He too has decided to visit Inuvik.  Dave was
enroute to Anchorage when he came upon the convoy and promptly
fell into line.  Dave's canoe weighs seventy pounds.  He whips it
off the top of his Westy to camp, tosses it on again when he's
ready to leave.  His knees bend and flex.  His shoulders have
full rotation.  I can't stand to watch.

Today's goal is the government campground about ten miles south
of Dawson, two hundred and fifty miles north.  For me the real
object is to get Jorge to a doctor before his burns become
infected.  Jorge and Yvette will continue on into Dawson,
escorted by either Jack or myself, the non-escort tasked with
nailing down a campsite for the missing pair.  We will spend two
days at Dawson, prepping our vehicles for the 476 unpaved miles
of the Dempster Highway.

At Dawson.

1826, 28 July 1996.  264 miles traveled.

We did not depart Frenchman's Lake as planned.  One of the
vehicles, a later model fuel injected van, refused to start.  We
played mechanic without doing more than getting in each other's
way and failed to diagnose the problem.  Because the van was
parked away from the others at a secluded campsite down a steep
and twisty track, it was impossible to haul it out with another
bus.  Fortunately there was a Canadian camped with us driving a
Ford 4x4.  We dropped off his trailer, used my tow rope to get a
grip on the van and yanked it not only out of the campsite but
all the way up the hill to the access road, where the van decided
to run just fine, so long as it was bump-started.  With five oat-
fed Inuvikerrs providing the push, it started just fine.

On our way back to pavement we took a photo-op that will surely
be the most spectacular of the trip, with all of the vans lined
up side-by-side, their asses about to fall off a cliff into the
Yukon several hundred feet below.

Back on pavement, Jorge and Jack turned north for Dawson and the
infirmary with most of the others turning south for Carmacks,
flush toilets, groceries and gas.  Thanks to the saddle tanks I
didn't need any gas and turned north.  Sue, the new arrival, who
gets about forty miles per gallon from her diesel engine, fell in
behind.

Sue's blue diesel Vanagon is even slower than me!  I've finally
found someone who travels at my speed!  We plodded the five hours
into Dawson together.  She has a CB but the transmitter-section
is broken, the rig can receive but not transmit, other than to
key the carrier on and off.  We work out a system of clicks --
one means no, two means yes and so forth.  I try to teach her
Morse code but she isn't interested.  When I persist she
threatens me with her dog.  It is a big dog but gentle and kind,
although it could slobber me to death.

Coming into Dawson we blew right past the campground.  Never saw
a thing.  Stopping at the gas station just this side of the
bridge, I asked for directions.  The lady directed me to a
private campground.  When I insisted there was a public
campground she said she'd never heard of it.  Odd?  Then she said
there was one across the river, saying again she didn't know of
any 'Klondike River Provincial Campground'.  Of course, we could
stay there, at the gas station, which happened to be the office
for an attached campground.

Trying to figure out what caused the campground to vanish, I
began back-tracking, peering down every side-road as I headed
back toward Whitehorse at thirty miles per hour.  I'd gone about
a mile when the other vans appeared -- and zoomed past.  They'd
seen no sign of the campground either.  One of the other vans had
a published trip log onboard listing the location of the
campground as so-many klicks past the airport.  I continued on to
the airport and started counting klicks.  And bingo!  There was
the campground, down an unmarked road to our left.

Someone had removed the sign from the posts.  The posts were
there but the distinctive 5 x 8 foot sign was missing.  

Jorge &amp; Yvette and Jack were already there and had saved me a
space.  The local clinic has shot Jorge full of antibiotics and
given him additional handfuls of pain-killers.  He wears an
especially silly grin.  Yvette could carve her initials on his
tongue and he wouldn't notice until he tried to spit.

My fuel pump is leaking and one of the saddle-tank vent-lines has
come adrift, plus I need to check my toe-in.  But we are now only
476 miles from Inuvik!

(after-trip comments:)

The cute trick with the campground sign and the forgetfulness of
the woman at the RV park/gas station was typical of the sharp
practices encountered in Dawson City, an end-of-the-road
community.

Later in the trip Sue Booth showed me some pictures of her 1965
Microbus.  It is in award-winning condition.  Then she casually
mentioned that she'd done all of the welding, painting and 
restoration herself.  It's surprising how easy it is to hate certain
people :-)
