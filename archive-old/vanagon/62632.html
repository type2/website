Subject: &quot;84 engine/tranny wanted

I'm in the process of deciding whether to rebuild or replace the engine
in my '84. Both the engine and tranny need replacement/rebuilding.
Anyone out there in N.E.(preferrably eastern Ma) have a engine and/or
auto transmission for sale...reasonable? 

I'd like to find a more affordable option to rebuilding these!
