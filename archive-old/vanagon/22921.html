Subject: Introduction


I'm jack lowry I'm a System Administrator in Columbia Md. 

I own a 93 (orphan) Eurovan MV, and previous owner of a 91 Vanagon GL, my 
wife drives a 95 Jetta gls. 

I do have one problem that maybe other have dealt with. The fuel gauge is 
at best not very accurate. It always seems to read low. Real low. Like 
.25 of a tank when there is probably .75 of a tank. I guess low is better 
than high.

Can anybody else relate their expierences with the goodyear g60 tires. 
I currently have one that is very badly cupped and really need to find a 
full set (I have 36,00 miles on ev)

Thanx, jack
