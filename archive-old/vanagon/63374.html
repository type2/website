Subject:      Re: Primary battery ventilation?

Ron,

There is a small hole beneath the battery in my 91', I was going to run a
tube into it.  This possible since the stamped sheetmetal panel has a large
depression where the tube would normally be crushed by the battery's
weight.  Alternatively I've, not REALLY looked behind some of the
structural gusseting in the batter compartment, so there could be one
hiding.  Finally, if I get to the job of venting my battery and I decide
the hole is a drain, I'll just drill one, watching out of course for all of
the subfloor obstacles.  Oh yeah, I'll try to locate the hole so it doen't
land to close the box frame.  Nasty spot for a corrosion experiment!

&gt;Howdy,
&gt;
&gt;I just got a new primary battery installed.  A Sears Diehard
&gt;International.  The battery has a vent, but Sears didn't connect it
&gt;to anything, and it's not apparant to me where it would connect.
&gt;
&gt;Where is the external vent connection for the primary battery?
&gt;Is it bad to leave the battery venting into the battery
&gt;compartment?
