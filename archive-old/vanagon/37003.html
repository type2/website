Subject:  Re: CV boots 

I know there are two types of CV boots for some cars.

The first is basically a tube, and requires the shaft/joint to be disassembled
to be installed. They last a long time.

The other type is a flatish sheet that wraps around the shaft in place, and
turns into a tube with some sort of zipper, or ziplock arrangement. (I'm
not sure, I haven't seen  one.) I've been told by several people that these
type are not very reliable. Their life varies from zero to moderate. All 
people I've talked to reccomend against this type unless the car is very
close to end of life, and you are willing to risk saving money now vs long
term fix that costs more.

Note: I'm ignoring the pleats when I describe them as tubes vs sheets. 

Bill Crick.
