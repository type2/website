Subject:      Sliding window latch needed

I am in need of a latch for the sliding window in my sliding door (I
assume similar to the sliding window above the sink). All I need is the
latch mechanism. I have tried all the usual sources to no avail. Is
anyone parting out a van that would be willing to sell me this part?

Thanks,
