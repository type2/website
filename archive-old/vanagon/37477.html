Subject: Cooling Tin 81' Westy

I was under the beast today and noticed I was missing the lower tin 
on the Oil filter side. It is a calif. model and have no local 
source. Any Left Coasters know where to get this part?                
 BTW I replaced CV boots a couple of moths ago and after reading some 
posts about this I decided to check the bolts. Its funny,  I could have 
sworn I tightened them when I did the job,  but today almost every one 
was loose, one almost fell out in my hand!  
Any help with Tin is greatly appreciated.
