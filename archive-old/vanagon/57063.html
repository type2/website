Subject: Re: fridge questions

Sorry Sean, I don't know the answer to you question, but, your post reminded
me of a question about the fridge in my 81 Westy that I keep meaning to ask.
 I have trouble getting my fridge to run on propane.  I have only run it once
and it took forever to get it lit.  Does anyone know of any tricks to help
speed up this process,(ie a way to light it by hand) or are they all a pain
in the you know what, in which case I guess I can live with it.  Thanks for
any comments.
