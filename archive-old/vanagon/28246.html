Subject: Fast idle Vanagon 1991


Hi,

I own a 1991 Vanagon (fuel injection) and for the last two months it has 
been idling at 2000 rpm. When the problem started last July (my God has 
it bee this long!) the car would only idle at high rpm when hot, but for 
the last two months no matter what the temperature it almost immediatly 
after starting it goes up to 2000 rpm.

Can anybody help ?

Thanks
