 David,

 I just quoted the message that is enclosed in asterisks, not write it.
Although I don't know a thing about these heaters (BN2? or BN4?), the one in
my Wilma does have a fuel pump which adjusts the flow of gas. All I have is
a photocopy of the section in which VW calls, Heater Booster and it is on
figure 16 in part 82 of the Shop Manual for 80 to 83 Vanagons (I might not
be correct on the years).

 Are these the same? If not, are the parts interchangeable? What models of
heaters were included in the buses (1982 and 1956 to be more precise)?

 I appreciate the help. You have all been very kind and patient.
