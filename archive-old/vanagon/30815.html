Subject: Bits for Dworkin's page 

	Ok, I've got some true 'bits' for Dworkin's page:

* 1	L &amp; R heat exchangers for 1600, rust throughs in the
sheet-metal BUT original paint still visible on both. Solid
pipes, flanges, etc. The right (fif) is super-trick custom 
Eurolook post-72 style with the heat-flap-arm on the wrong 
side and no pivot. The left one has no flap-arm.
	Access covers in the front are already pried off so you 
can fix the flap arms or install your own or paint 'em &quot;Neon&quot;
for that really cool look. Complete with flaps and covers. 

(Jim Brill's dad offered to buy him new ones and I advised him
to go for it, price (free) now reduced by half! :{p&gt;

* 2	Brand-new little piece of tin that goes in front of the crank
pulley, pre-70 style since we had to replace it to fit the rest
of the tin ;)

* 3 	Huge plastic accordian-larvae heat-exchanger-to-hot-air-tube
connectors, black plastic. I've got the slim-line Beetle style
instead.

The above FREE if you pick up or pay shipping.


* 4	REALLY rusty '70 single-cab side gates- l &amp; r. sides are ok but
the bottom of the lower channel sections are eaten through. Anything
can be saved, I'm not sure these are worth it. Other than the
basic sheet-metal, the only other parts present are the hinges.
These gates have no latches, screws or rubber bumpers. And there's
no coresponding rear gate. 

	Tell me how you're going to fix the rust and we can
talk about what they might be worth. Someone with time and not
a lot of money might be able to use 'em, or if you have NO
gates at all and aren't hung up on aesthetics... I can always
keep these for when I haul rocks so they're not zero-value.

&gt; I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
(thanks Thom!)
