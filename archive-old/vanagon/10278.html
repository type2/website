&gt; The original strap rusted out on our 85 several years ago.  We fixed it using
&gt; a steel strap used for packaging cargo.  It has held up for several years

The original strap on my '84 ...well, there never was one while I owned 
the van.  The coat hanger holds it quite securely thank you.  :-)
