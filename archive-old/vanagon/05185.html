Subject: Fixed my fuel gauge

A while ago I asked about a problem with the fuel gauge in my '73. The gauge 
itself seemed OK, the sender was OK, I tested and swapped the voltage 
regulator. Joel kindly sent me details on the gauge circuit and I checked 
all the wires. Still couldn't find a reason why it wouldn't work. I took the 
gauge apart looking for a broken wire or something, and found what looked 
like carbon deposits on the wire that coils round the bi-metallic strip. I 
scraped it with a small screwdriver and put it all back together and it 
worked! I don't know why it made a such difference but its something to try 
as a last resort. I also found there is a toothed segment, accessable 
through a hole in the back of the gauge, that adjusts the needle. This may 
help those people who are having trouble with inaccurate gauges. 
Unfortunately I buggered about with it while figuring out what it did and 
will now have to run the tank dry so I can re-calibrate it.
