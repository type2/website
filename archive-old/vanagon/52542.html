I think its time to let Chyrsler know about the inaccuacy of their claims. 
It seems to me we did something similar to what I had in mind to the &quot;Car 
Talk&quot; folks a while back...

What I propose is this....Chrysler must have a web site, right? And I would 
suppose that somewhere in this web site is an e-mail response 
&quot;card&quot;...Wouldn't it be fun to have educate Chrysler in the errors of thir 
ways much the same as this list did to &quot;Click &amp; Clack&quot;?

Just a &quot;before-coffee-fix&quot; thought....
