&gt; Subject: Re: Taking care of pop top fiberglass

&gt; I have a Poptop that is getting   &quot;ratty&quot; and have tried to fix it
&gt; with two different kinds of spray paint. For the sides I use the kind for viny
l
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; fix might be from a professional that uses some kind of epoxy or
&gt; resin based coating if your fibers are coming through the paint.
&gt; My other Westy's top is in good shape except for some mold in the
&gt; creases. The vinyl paint does a nice job hiding what the soap won't
&gt; get off.  I just touch up where it is needed.

I bought a '67 Westy this summer with similar fiberglass
problems.  My intention is to sand all the PO paint off,
clean with solvent and apply several coats of fiberglass
resin without additional glass fibers, essentially a &quot;gel
coat&quot;.  If the surface has deteriorated to the point that
fiber is showing through and mold is growing, all those
crevices need to be filled and sealed with something that
will adhere permanently.  That seems to me to be the
function of the gel coat of resin.  Once properly sealed, a
color-gel coat might work, or application of primer/color
coat paint would do.

Other opinions?
