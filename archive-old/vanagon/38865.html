Subject: RE: Help..............won't stop


&gt;My new lodger has a problem with his 1972 camper. Basically the brakes
&gt;are awful. It stops but not quick enough to feel safe in. He's fitted
&gt;new drums, shoes, pads, master cylinder, slave cylinders, etc...basically
&gt;the lot, but it still slowly grinds to a hault.
&gt;
&gt;Apparently the brakes on a '72 are unique to that year and it is a
&gt;'72 specific problem with it's own individual cures......_dot_can anyone
&gt;help????


Does he have power-assisted brakes? All U.S. '72 busses did-- the
master cylinder bolts to a big drum-shaped thing that has a vacuum
hose going to it from the carbs.

If he doesn't, then he may be experiencing normal operation-- front
disk brakes always need a lot of pedal pressure if not power-assisted.

But if he does have power, suggest that he check the hose from the
carbs, and also the little valve that sits in the hose near the carbs.
I had a hole in each in my '71 (different setup, I know). Not only did
the brakes work poorly, but the engine wouldn't idle worth beans until
I replaced the valve and the entire length of hose (3 sections on a '71)
from the engine to the booster servo.

My $.02...
