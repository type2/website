&gt; &gt;        It's disappointing to hear you say that. When you are in need
&gt; &gt;of a battery boost or are mired in the mud, I hope that when you
&gt; &gt;make that plea for help, that the person coming to your aid does not
&gt; &gt;interrogate you first to ascertain if your values, conduct or lifestyle
&gt; &gt;are offensive to the rescuer before he/she decides whether or not to
&gt; &gt;throw you that tow line.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        Here's a plea for help. Can't we just unconditionally help out?
&gt; 
&gt; I would generally agree with you in this regard, but I really do feel that
&gt; missionaries are for the most part practicing cultural genocide.  I
&gt; wouldn't expect someone to interrogate me, but then again, I would also not
&gt; flag someone down and tell them that I was spreading the Good News about
&gt; David Koresh to the ignorant savages.Ron,
You continue! I am bewildered at your apparent indignation at helping a fellow Vanagon 
owner. You state it is due to him being a missionary and that this attaches him to a 
book you read stating they destroy indigenous peoples. I think your pronouncement of 
this mans guilt is certainly shallow.
For instance, I am presently in the US Naval reserve. And there are numerous well 
referenced books telling of accounts of pilots bombing, strafing and otherwise 
obliterating orphanages in WWI/WWII/Korea/Vietnam wars. I flew for the military but 
did not do these things. Would you help me find a part for my Vanagon? Or would my 
association with those atrocities not allow any help for me?
As well, you drive a car, and cars are known to kill people (even truly destroy 
cultures! witness the Ahmish holdouts!). Therefore you as well have a rather solid 
connection to destruction of indigenous peoples by your close association with 
technology that kills them and takes their heritage from them? You drive the 
Vanagon, No?
I find it interesting you site a book as your reference. I personally know Christian 
missionaries selflessly dedicated to housing, clothing and feeding people in need 
world-wide, they are the type of people who would do anything for any person of any 
color, ethnic background or political persuasion in need of help. And yes they do 
teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, is this so bad?
I say, when someone needs help, help him or her. Kindness is our gift to humanity.
