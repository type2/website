&gt; Hi David.  Just curious about this little fan.  How big is it?  I 

It's about 2.5&quot; by 2.5&quot; by 3&quot; tall.  Air blows straight up out the top.

&gt; have one that runs on one D cell with a 4&quot; blade with adjustable 
&gt; gooseneck that I use to cool the van while camped.  It let's us sleep 
&gt; in the heat anyway!!  I only get 2 or 3 nights out of the one cell 
&gt; though.  I paid around $12 CDN a couple years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this little fan made specifically for the fridge?

Yup.

-David
