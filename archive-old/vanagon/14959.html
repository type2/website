&gt; Now I use the fully liscenced version of Eudora and it is killer! That is,
&gt; it automatically sorts all my mail from 15 mailing lists into their own mail

I use VMSmail for all my mail.  It's not bad but some people complain it's
too hard to use.  I subscribe to several lists and it has not let me down.
But then, being a systems manager and logged in for 9 hours day might have
something to do with it.  ;-) 

Anyway, I support about 1000 popmail users on campus.  Some swear by it,
others swear it. ;-)  Use whatever works best.
