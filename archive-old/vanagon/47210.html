&gt; Hi Barry.  I am really happy with Yokohama Y370 LT 195 75/R14.  These 
&gt; tires are all season, excellent in ALL conditions, quiet, and make 
&gt; the Westy handle like a dream.  They can hold 1710 lbs at 65 psi.  
&gt; I'm on my second set of these tires, and think very highly of them.  
&gt; They aren't cheap, but they are worth every cent.  I believe we paid 
&gt; about $500 installed/balanced/evirnoment tax/valve stems/pst/gst.

&gt; Hope this helps,

I'll second that! I got 2 of these for mine on Harry's recommendation 
- they're superb!. Handling is dramatically better than even the 
Conti re-inforced tires I have. I will get 2 more once the Conti are 
worn out, unless I get tired of them first... They seem very durable 
also - after a few days of rough road driving, the Contis had lots of 
little cuts in the tread, but the Yokos had none.
