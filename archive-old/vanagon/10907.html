Subject: Re: Red Rock Canyon info - more

Deleted lots of good stuff about Red Rock and Vicinity.

I just checked the 1994 copy of Tom Steinststra's &quot;California Camping&quot;.  He
says it is $7-9 a night to camp there.  Just thought you all might like to
know.

We are planning on being there!

&gt;ABOUT THE CAMPGROUND:
&gt;
&gt;        The campground is large and flat, very well
&gt;        groomed with lots of sites.  I doubt it ever fills up.  There are
&gt;        lots of sites at the back up against the sandstone formations
&gt;        that are really nice.  There are only pit toilets there, but
&gt;        on my last visit there I was absolutely amazed that they did not
&gt;        smell at all!!  Not even a little.  There is running water.  At
&gt;        night, it is *very* dark and there seem to be lots of rabbits
&gt;        running around.  Also lots of squirrels in the area that will
&gt;        eat out of your hand if you let them.  I saw lots of tracks and
&gt;        droppings from larger animals (fox? wolf? deer?).  There is also
&gt;        a small ranger station there with a visitors center, but it seems
&gt;        to be closed most of the time.  I don't remember exactly what
&gt;        the campground fee was, but I'm sure it wasn't more than $6/night.
