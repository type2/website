Subject: how to turn over engine?
Date: Sun, 1 Dec 96 22:06:00 EST

Hey all,
Just curious:

How do those with air-cooled Vanagons turn the motor over manually?
I've seen in Bentley the picture of the special tool that engages the
slot in the fan hub, blah blah but I don't have that tool.  I was trying
to do it over break and I couldn't get it.  I tried getting a socket on
one of the fan hub bolts, but I couldn't get this thing to turn over at
all, tho that worked with the '78.  Couldn't get enough grip on the fan
belt to turn the engine either.  So, for those doing points, etc, how do
you turn the engine over?

Sean
