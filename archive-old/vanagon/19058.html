Oh, heck.  Didn't mean to be offended.

After all, when I want to actually get there I drive the Vanagon.  It may be a 
Bentley, but it's still a 44-year old English car, with all that implies.

(And RR's have never been exclusively chauffer-driven; there was this 
wonderful old lady in England
who bought her 1924 Silver Ghost new and drove it into the 80's, when her 
doctor made her stop because he thought the stress of hand-cranking the engine 
was too much for her.  *She* thought it was nonsense...)
