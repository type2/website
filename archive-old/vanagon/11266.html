Michael Heron sayeth:
&gt; 
&gt; glad you enjoyed the lit. while you are up here robbing my house, i will be
&gt; vacationing in tallahasee (like about 10 billion other canucks!) and
&gt; searching out your address to liberate you of all those add-a-rooms you got
&gt; at far to cheap a price ;) !

It is my reward for living down here in the Chosen Land.

&gt; BTW when you photocopied all of those metric pages, you mentioned that you
&gt; did it on A4 sized paper. Did you have to photocopy each of those pages

Well, I misspoke.  The copier had an A4 setting for _input_ only, which 
made auto-feeding it much easier.  Yep, tore a hole in my BVD's watching 
that first priceless browned page go thru, but no problems!  If I'd had 
to do it manually, you'd have had to send me the _original_ brochure! :-)
