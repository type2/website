Well, I thought my engine died when I turned the key and nothing would   
happen.  After getting it towed, I realized I had it Drive.

One day, I was walking through a blizzard in Upstate NY when a middle   
aged guy in his Tercel called me over.  He asked if I ever seen a   
steering wheel lockup.  I told him to turn the ignition key and the wheel   
simultaneously.  He has unbelievable shocked.  He has been trying to   
start his car for about 2 hours.

&gt; filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt; weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt; revolve!  Any others out there?


Know a guy a few years back who drove his brand new BMW 750 bike 200   
miles
home from the dealer in 4th gear.  Didn't know it had 5th. His last one
didn't.  tim
