     An alternative if you don't want to buy the adapter is to find a tire 
     place or gas station with a old fashioned bubble balancer.  I have 
     used both the modern spin balancers and the bubble balancer on the 
     same wheels and they do about the same job unless  you regularly cruse 
     over 70mph (not likely in a VW).

&gt;I'm now searching the are for some firm/entity with the equipment get

J.C. Whitney sells an adapter that allows older VW wheels with the giant 
hole in the center to be mounted/balanced on modern equipment.
