Subject: Dometic Fridge question
Date: Wed, 2 Apr 1997 21:39:47 -0500

Just bought our 3rd Westy, an 88.  This is the first one we have had that
has other than just an ice box.  My question is just what should I expect
of the Dometic refrigerator?  I've got the manuals, so it appears that in
AC and DC operation, there is just a heater coil that does the 'business'. 
So when you put the controls in either of these positions, you would not
hear anything?  I checked the AC plug for continuity and it seems to be
there and come and go as one would expect as I twirl the thermostat.  I did
leave the fridge on AC overnight and in the morning the cooling part in the
fridge did seem a little colder than the outside (it was in the forties
this a.m. here in Charlotte NC), but not all THAT cold...  I didn't try to
make any ice.

I seem to have a little bit of LP gas in the tank - the stove burners light
without problems, but in following the instructions to light the gas
refridge, I've gotten the ignitor to make the gas pop just once.  

Any suggestions as to what I should expect would be welcome.

88 Westy
