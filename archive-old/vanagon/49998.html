Subject: Batteries going boom

  Well Batteries blow up for 2 reasons. 1- it was being discharged,
  or charged witch gives off hydrogen gas and something sparked around it.
  OR 2- A short across the battery, like the battery + cable shorts to
  the body. With a good battery this causes so much internal heat it
  sooner or latter sets off the hydrogen and Bang. I have had my fun
  blowing up Batteries! Good luck

&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; 
&gt; I'll stop by sometime soon :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Today I had to deal with my wife's EV's battery.
&gt; 
&gt; The thing _literally_ blew up with a BANG!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It is now sitting in shreds and I'm about to start doing nasty things
&gt; to VW of A -- I claim they should pay for a new battery, they claim
&gt; it's a  &quot;wear item&quot;...
&gt; 
&gt; I'll post more on this to list shortly...
