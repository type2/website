Hi Ken!

The Bentley book you keep hearing about is the Official Service Manual 
authorized
by VW and published by Robert Bentley Publishers.  If you do any of your own
work or just want to be better informed about what other people are doing to 
your Bus
it is well worth the $35 or so to buy it.  I think the actual title is 
something like
Volkswagen Official Service Manual Type 2: Station Wagon/Bus 1968-1979.

About those front seats.  VW as well as many other folks use horsehair for 
there
seat padding.  Usually the cushion is shaped and the horsehair is 
&quot;rubberized&quot;
to hold it together and in shape.  Most upholstery shops or mail order 
places
sell foam as a replacement for the horsehair(lasts longer and easier to work 
with).
The only catalog I have handy shows $13.95 for a foam bottom seat pad for a 
'79
Bus. Just to give you an idea.

About oil.  I live in Houston and have always had good results using 30Wt 
oil most of the year and switching to 40Wt in the summer months.  I am sure 
I could use a good multi-vis oil, but for some reason I have always stayed 
with the straight Wts.
I hope al this helps.
