&gt;Those nice 110v ceramic heaters crank out 1500watts of heat,

&gt;12v would require, in terms of amperage,  1500watt/12v= 125amps.
&gt;That's ALOT of juice folks.  Electric heaters from a 12v system are
&gt;not practical in an automobile context.

&gt;sorry to burst the proverbial bubble...

Well, waaaahhhhh!  (Explains it all too well, don't he?  ;)
