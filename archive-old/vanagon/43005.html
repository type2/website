Subject: Re: More questions...78 Westfalia!

Hi Adam:
I will answer two of your questions.
1. You can run your fridge using the spare battery for about 4 hours.
   Remember that this battery will keep things inside the fridge cool.
2. If you want to keep your pop-top pristine white, use the regular Clorox
   diluted in proportion of 1:2. When you clean the pop-top with Clorox do
   it in an open area and don't mix it with detergents containing ammonia,
   this creates toxic vapors.

Good luck with your Westy,
