Subject: Re: HORN


I put air horns in my 86 Van after I got hit cause a bozo couldn't
hear me.  Put a relay in place of current horn, mount air horn where convienent.
Wire air horn compressor direct from battery via the relay.  Voila, much noise.
Cost about $35 at the FLAPS, JCW should be cheaper.  Get one of those 
&quot;diesel train&quot; setups, would be amusing.


 &gt;Texans appearently feel that it is there god-given right to pull out in front
 &gt;of anything smaller than a tractor-trailer, so I was wanting to know if
 &gt;anyone has any ideas for a horn for my Thing, that would be sufficiently
 &gt;loud to scare the he|| out of any one who felt the need to pull out when it
 &gt;is too late.  I have had too many incidents where I have had to lock up all
 &gt;four tires in an attempt to stop before hitting someone, fortunately not in
 &gt;the Thing yet.  I am looking for something simple, and compact(ie not be
 &gt;mounted on the hood or fenders) components could go in the trunk if necessary.
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks
