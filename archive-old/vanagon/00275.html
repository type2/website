&gt;&gt;One thing that I forgot to mention in my original post

&gt;
&gt;!!!???!!!
&gt;Bwaaa Ha Ha Ha Haaaaa
&gt;Really?

Dont laugh, it IS finely crafted. It has more turns in it that a sidewinder
and operates the pump correctly....As far as I can tell.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Idea just struck me. How much clearance is there from the end of the spark plug
&gt;&gt;to the top of the piston at TDC.
&gt;
&gt;Why not use that piece of coat hanger instead of a modified spark plug -
&gt;you can bend it to clear the hole, it would be long enough, and you could
&gt;mark the point where it tops out...

When the cylinder is at the top of the travel, alot of rotation means little 
up-n-down travel. It is real hard to tell where TDC is. What you do isrun
the cylinder up til it hits the plug. Mark the pully at the crack in the case.
The backwards until it hits the plug again. Mark that location. Between 
the marks is TDC.
