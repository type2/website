Subject: Grinding Brakes, Poor Starting

Attention! HELP! 

I was wondering if you could all put on your thinking caps and help me (and
my 78 Westy 2.0L FI Auto) with my rookie questions. Thank You.  My brakes
seem to squeak (really bad in reverse) and grind a bit.....There is lots of
pad left in the front, and I think the disc might be a bit warped.  Is this
what is causing all the noise?  Is it expensive to fix?   

Part II

When I try and start the van, it turns over, but doesn't wanna start.  After
I do this two or three times it seems to finally &quot;catch&quot; and start....and
then run fine. The battery has lots of water, but I don't know about the
charge.  Could it be the starter? (where is that anyways??) 

Part III (Last, I swear)

I have an auxiallary battery.  Could someone explain how my appliances
choose which battery to use, or do they use both or what?  The PO used to
drive around with the aux. disconnected?  Any tips about it?  I only have a
fridge, light, and sink.  


Thank you very much in advance.....I am eager and willing to learn if you
are will to preach...I LOVE VWs.......
  
In anticipation..
