Subject: Re: Why adjust valves?

I also jump at the chance to check and adjust the valves (1600 DP) 
usually happens before 3000 ticks on the odometer.  After this harsh 
winter and my first year with foo ('65 Deluxe), I had to replace the 
heads, (I just had to, O.K.)  Anyway, one of the heads had two cracks 
in it and I choose not to re-use any of the valves from both heads.  
A month later I tried to completely dissassemble the trashed head.  I 
couldn't get a couple of the valves out.  They were in tight.  The 
valve guides were way too tight.  The grooves where the valve keepers 
mate were mashed such that the clearance (Clarence) wouldn't allow me 
to pull the valve out.   All the while I've got a valve clatter on my new headed 
1600 DP.  What gives?  I thought after many valve adjustments I 
should be able to get it right (It's really not rocket science.)  The 
morning before our Memorial camping trip, I attack the valves again.  
I find they're all in good spec., 'cept maybe one (Intake, cylinder 
#4).  I pay real close attention here and find that if I rotate the 
adjusting screw just a little bit (maybe 1/16 th of a turn) the 
clearance goes to zero.  Backed the screw all the way out to find 
that the tip had been mercilessly pounding away in one spot such that 
the impression of the valve stem (from my old head) had left its deep 
mark on the tip of the adjusting screw.  
  Now the rocker - valve system is designed to connect off center 
such that the valve rotates slightly with each tap.  Apparently this 
didn't happen.
  I backed out the screw, filed it round, re-installed and adjusted.  
Ah, quite... Never ran better.........

(All this from doing valve adjustments)
