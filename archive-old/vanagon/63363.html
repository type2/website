&gt;I saw an ad for this in the local paper.  Has anyone heard of this particular
&gt;type of conversion?  If so, what type is it?  Sink, stove, fridge, pop top,
&gt;etc.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, I'm new to the
&gt;list and the Vanagon.  I took one on a test drive about two weeks ago and
&gt;I'm hooked.

The vendors list on vanagon_dot_com says:

     Adventure Campers
     17851 Hwy 1
     Ft. Bragg, CA 95437

     (707) 964-4298

     Owner is Ed Anderson. They don't make VW's anymore, but sometimes has one
     or two older adventurewagens on the lot.
