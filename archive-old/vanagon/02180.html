&gt;Oregon and I could drive as far as S.F. or Seattle.  L.A. would be a drag

&gt;might have a variety of campers?

there is a (supposedly) big junkyard that advertises in European Cars. it's
either Campbells in Nelson, WA or Nelsons in Campbell, WA (i can't remember
which!).

also: for tracking down a specific car BEFORE it hits the boneyards, check
with the insurance companies or wrecking companies. a $20 reward for info
might go a long way. :) &lt;well, with the wrecking company, anyway&gt;  i wouldn't
think the dealers (unless they are a helluva lot better than around here)
would much care or have anything to do with body shop repairs.

also: check Hemmings Motor News (for more junkyards in your local area).
and there used to be a magazine called Locator, which was by junkyards and
for junkyards, but i haven't seen it in a long time.

some junkyards are tied into a net (somewhat like this one) and can search
around for cars. i've not had an awful lot of good luck getting them to do
this, however. :(

good luck.
