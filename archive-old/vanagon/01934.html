Subject: Re: Vanagon tire ?

&gt;What tires are best for '87 Vanagon Westy ?  There are LT's on it now
&gt;which the PO had put on and they will need-a-changing soooon.  I was
&gt;thinking to go with a good passenger car tire to keep the road noise down.
&gt;But, maybe they are not strong enough ?  Are LT's neccessary ?  Any and
&gt;all advice welcome.   PS.  I'm still looking for a used but not abused,
&gt;original side tent for a Westfalia and an original hubcap.  Oh no not the
&gt;hubcap story again ! {:-)

My Westy had passenger tires on it when I 'inherited' it.  What a disaster.
The van had a terrible understeer, it swayed, and generally felt really
shaky.  I put a set of Michelin LTX on it, and it now steers well, and turns
easily in parking lots.  The swaying has decreased so much I no longer worry
about the shocks.  I haven't noticed any change in the road noise.  I'll
never use passenger tires again.
