Subject:  aux battery connection

For someone new to the 12V scene, could someone suggest what
exactly is required/ how to hook a deep-cycle battery up so that when
I'm parked I can run all my accessories (stereo, lights, etc.) without
draining my starter battery?  Please include recommended guage of wire,
connector type, isolator relay type/placement, etc.   I know some stuff
has been posted related to this, and it's probably really simple, but I'm still
kind of fuzzy on it.  Any info (including the name of a good book which
describes this stuff) would be appreciated very much.  Note: I've called
Wrangler power products for info/catalog, but have not received it yet.
