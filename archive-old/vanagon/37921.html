Subject: fiberglass polymer/wax removal

In ignorance I used Nu-Finish on my fiberglass pop-top.  The white haze
refused to buff.  I figured it would at lease protect, so I left it for the
winter but it never came off.  Anyone know something non-abrasive that melts
nasty polymer/wax from the uneven surface without hurting the paint?  I've
twice used a liquid from a cleaning supply store (no listed ingrediants).
 It's better, but all that rubbing and hosing still has left a lot.  Simple
Green, amonia, turpentine, blowtorch, etc.?  

I spent today at Wal-Mart trying to compare Mothers, Meguires, etc. with my
Kit carnauba wax.  I'm open to suggestions to better protect and bring out
the maroon color!
