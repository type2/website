Subject: Oil Filter input.

Hi Volks,
   I had some free time to look at the Vanagon mailing list( first time in
manny weeks) and noticed a few posts about oil filters.  I have to agree
with most who say Fram filters do not work well in Vanagons.  Just to give
an example, my former Vanagon an '84 Camper had 120K on it when I bought it
and I when I noticed the oil light flickered at idle I quickly added a
gauge to keep on eye on the pressure.  Anyway, I regularly change my oil
and I used a Mann or Wix filter and the pressure at 3500 rpm was about 40
psi and was about 15psi at idle. Oh, the previous owner must have used a
lighter weight oil because when I started useing 20-50 the oil light didn't
flicker anymore.
      My father gave me a Fram once and I decided to use it.  I noticed the
pressure had dropped  to about 35psi at 3500 rpm and the oil light
flickered again.  So I went back to Wix and Mann and was very happy.   I
should point out that AC/Delco filters work well too.  AC/Delco brand
filters now have the check valve in them. Part # PF56.  I didn't try any
other filter brands so perhaps there might be others out there that will
work as well as Wix, Mann or AC/Delco.    I currently use AC/Delco because
I can get them cheap (I work for a GM dealer)   So that is my 2 cents
worth.  .  If you have a comment you want me to see please e-mail me
direct.  Lord knows when I will be able to look and my listserv mail again.
Take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim
