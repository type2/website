Subject: Re:SAW A SAHRAN IN CHICAGO AREA

Presumably Sharan? Fairly common here if so, result of a joint initiative
with Ford (Galaxy). Up to 7 seater MPV, very similar vehicles with
different engines &amp; trim options. Word is that the VW holds its value
better than the Ford, so far :-)

The design philosophy apparently to get the size/versatility of a MPV but
keep it car like to drive, (i.e not van like), no sliding doors etc. 

Wouldn't mind one, but don't know where I'd put the cooker and fridge...
