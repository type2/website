Subject: re: Drink up, the price of VW fluids!

This brings up a couple questions. Is it true that VW does not use 
'normal' PSF? In other words... I can't go down to my FLAPS and pick up 
generic fluid for my Vanagon? If this is true, what would be damaged by 
generic fluid... the rack or the pump or both? 

What does this mean to people considering engine swaps? Say I have a V6 
with its own steering pump. Would the special stuff work ok with the 
domestic pump?
