&gt; and another idiotic symptom of LARB drivers: you are out on the highway,
&gt; all alone in your lane, no other cars for 500 yards in front and back.
&gt; someone comes up in the left lane (of a four-lane), moving along faster than
&gt; you, but as they pull up beside you, they slow down and will not pass. they
&gt; just 'hang' out there in the left lane ... leaving you nowhere to go (if
&gt; something happens in your lane).
&gt; 
&gt; anybody else noticed this? 

Nope, they always pass me.   :)
