Jack:
I have the BA6 installed on my '65 deluxe (I think as u already know).  It
werks great.  The rubber hose (large diameter stuff) that connects under the
rear seat (fold-out bed) and others similar are developing cracks along the
seams.  It appears minor and I think I can repair these with Aqua Seal (stuff
for SCUBA/ surf wet suits) for the mean time.  Do you have a source for these
types of parts?  VWoA (ouch)?
