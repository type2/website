&gt; &gt; How much in tire diameter could 6% represent?

&gt;  Hi,  Would it be that the tire diameters can't be more than 6%
&gt; different in diameter? Or would gear ratios play a part in the equasion?
&gt; If it is just Tire diameters you can take the exact diameters of each
&gt; tire and mathimatically figure the percentage of the difference in size.

	The quote from the manual said 6% across the viscous coupling, but
if the final drive ratios are the same for the front final drive and the
rear final drive (which they would have to be if we are supposed to use the
same size tires on all four wheels right?), the gear ratios cancel each other
out. So you would be able to calculate the allowable difference for a given
tire size based only on the diameter. Also, I would think one should allow
a bit of headroom for going around corners where the back wheels will not
take the same track as the front wheels and thus will not be turning at the
same rate.
