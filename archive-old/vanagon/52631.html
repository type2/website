Subject: '80 Westy for sale cheap?

I am browsing &quot;AutoWeb&quot; and see they have an '80 Westy listed for $180.

That's Canadian!  About $130 buckaroos.

Here's what they say:
Volskwagen Westfalia 1980 454,322 miles (I hope they mean km!)
Mike Treiber (westfalia_at_hotmail_dot_com) Burlington, Ontario
Interior color: Mildew (cute) Exterior color: brown.  Good condition,
automatic,  &quot;Please buy this car! I'm desperate&quot;

Wow.  What a deal for you East-coast lurkers!
