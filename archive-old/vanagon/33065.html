Subject: '71 Bus For Sale


Now that the V6anagon is acting like a real car, time to part with the
'71 which has always &quot;sort of&quot; acted like one.

Good stuff:

Clean looking, white w/ nice gray interior.
Starts and runs well. Engine is peppy.
I will provide CA smog certificate.
Comes with both stock and 009 distributors.
Only non-step-thru 8-seat baywindow in captivity.
New master cylinder, PB vacuum lines and valve
Has all seats.
New carpet, lots of padding. Quiet for a bus.

Bad stuff:

Rust under windshield, dent in front.
Engine overheats when pushed hard on long trips. Thermostat?
Engine is a 1970 single-port with 30PICT-3 carb.
Leaks oil (surprise, surprise).
Some bondo here and there.
Needs front tires. Excellent Michelin rears.
Exhaust smell from heater, so I disconnected it. Have all parts.

Summary:

OK daily driver, good project car. A rebuilt engine would absolve a
lot of sins, but may be overkill.
