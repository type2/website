Subject: RE: moving to california emissions?


&gt;There is a chance i may be moving to California in the next 3 to 5
&gt;years.  i was wondering what it takes to get a vehicle californeized.
&gt;Should i just forget about my '72 bus and find another when i get
&gt;there or is there a chance that this original detroit smog machine is
&gt;saveable?  The engine and carbs are original but is any extra
&gt;equipment required?

I move here (CA) from Colorado with three non-CA cars, and found out
that CA laws say that you must have all the original equipment that the
car came from the factory with. The DMV people told me that this meant
that I didn't need to put the extra CA equipment on them. Turns out
all the smog stations have two equipment lists for every car: One that
lists the CA equipment for CA cars, and one for the 49-state non-CA
cars. So if your bus has its original (non-CA_ carbs and what ever it
had when it was new, then you're set.

The bad news is, the CA DMV will stick you with a $300 fine for bringing
in a non-CA car. Two cars, two fines. They call it an Environmental Fee,
but it goes into the same General Fund as traffic tickets, which sounds
like a fine to me.

I got this unpleasant surprise when I registered my three cars. Asked them
if we wouldn't all be better off if I were to spend $300 each on them to put
on the CA equipment and (theoretically) cut down their emissions. Got a
shrug and &quot;Sorry, that's what the law says&quot;. Hmmm.


&gt;How about my '76 cutlass? that thing is just a
&gt;body, engine, and carb.  while constructing this beast my whole
&gt;philosophy has just been &quot;make it go faster&quot;.  my cars have always
&gt;been old enough to be exempt from the now completely defunct michigan
&gt;emissions laws so not a single one of em has any polution controlls
&gt;at all.  If california has those nasty safety inspections some states
&gt;have i may as well forget the whole thing.

Here you may be screwed. A car has to be a 1965 or older to duck the
smog inspections in California. If you can't find a liberal and ea$y-
to-influence smog inspector, then they will require you to put on all
the original equipment, etc., etc. '76 Cutlasses all had smog pump,
catalytic converters, special carbs, valves, a million vacuum hoses,
and God knows what else. That stuff is available if you look, but it's
not cheap, and it's a real pain to put on, not to mention killing
performance.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news...
