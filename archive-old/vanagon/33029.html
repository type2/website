&gt;1. Do you remember my tale of going to the trouble of R&amp;Ring the alternator
&gt;and the impellar fan due to a &quot;bearing noise&quot; only to find out later that
&gt;the header was banging on the rear apron? =)
&gt;
&gt;2. Over torquing the oiler cooler case stud/nut &lt;snap!&gt; late on a Sunday
&gt;night and needing vehicle the following day.
&gt;
&gt;3. Trying to get the 36hp to run right for a week and a half without
&gt;success. Suffered ridcule by the neighbors over your &quot;mechanical aptitude.&quot;
&gt;Having the mechanic fix it in 30 seconds due to the switched 1 and 2 plug
&gt;wires.  I double checked them a zillion times even though I *KNEW* they 
were
&gt;right and even tracked them and checked Muir. It was the first thing I
&gt;checked! Blamed it on the 36hp plug wire loom tube. Un-huh...


Nos. 1 and 2 don't quite make the Idiot-factor list, because there was
some (however small) reason to do the things you did.

But No. 3-- NOW you qualify. Join the club!   :^)
