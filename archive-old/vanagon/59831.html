Subject: Neat Camper upgrade

I replaced the brown electrical outlet with a grey GIFI outlet.
Not only does it match the grey interior better, but it is safer too.
If you do this, make sure that you check the leads from the original plug
(there are two sets) so that you wire the GIFI outlet corectly.
