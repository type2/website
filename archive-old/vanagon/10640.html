&gt;I have been looking for a good camper for a few months, specifically a 
&gt;'76-'79 (I want a Type IV 2000cc, but don't want a Vanagon--just personal 
&gt;preference).  Right now I'm talking with someone from Ohio (I'm from 
&gt;southern Ontario) who has the following for sale:

Well, if you're gonna have that engine rebuilt anyway, you could also look
at earlier type IV models and then fit them with a 2l crankshaft and
bigger pistons, etc. Dave Kautz thinks that the 74 and the 75 models have
the best Westfalia arrangements. And, if I'm not mistaken, the 78 and
79'ers have a swiveling front passenger seat.

&gt;1976 Westphalia
&gt; - Manual tranny
&gt; - 140,000 miles on original engine (no rebuild)
&gt; - New tires (Michelins with reinforced sidewalls esp. for Type II VWs)
&gt; - New exhaust and heat exchangers
&gt; - New brakes
&gt;  (&quot;new&quot; as in less than 5000 miles old)
&gt; - A bit of surface rust (rear dogleg, under front windshield, front
&gt;  passenger door step)
&gt; - Interior good; propane kitchen; everything works
&gt; - Single owner since 1979: maintained by authorized VW service
&gt; - Starts and runs reliably

IMHO, I would start at around $3,000 and then substract the cost of the
rebuild and maybe the cost of body work. So, anywhere between $1000 and
$2000 would seem right. What you will pay will depend on your dickering
skills and how desperate the seller is. But the new tires, exhaust, and
heat exchangers should be worth about $300 + $100 + $400 = $800 to you. So
you shouldn't feel _too_ bad if you pay closer to $2000.

Let's hear other opinions...:)
