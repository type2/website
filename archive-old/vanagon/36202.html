Subject: Information Requested

On a recent camping trip down the California coastline, I met a group of 
fellow VW bus and vanagon owners who informed me of your 'club.'  I would 
be interested in finding out more about you.  (Dave was king 
enough to provide me with this e-mail address).

Hope to hear from someone soon!

Sincerely,

Markus Meier (aquaman_at_crl_dot_com)
