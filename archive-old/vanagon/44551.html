Subject: Center caps for Carat  Wheels

A friend without e-mail is trying to make some sort of Audi wheels 
work on his '84 Vanagon, and needs to come up with some center 
caps.  He asked me to ask if anyone can tell him the dimensions 
(diameter at base and at top, and height) of the center caps that 
come with the Carat wheels.
Please respond to my e-mail if you have this info.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
