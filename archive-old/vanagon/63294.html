rectangulars are highly wanted here in germany, you wont
find them on the scrapyards. at least not cheap.

&gt;Does anyone out there have a line on getting the late
&gt;Vanagon?

&gt;     I don't want to go retro to round lights (always
&gt;wanted a Vanagon with rectangulars).

&gt;Do our Canadian friends suffer with the same
&gt;S.A.E.-approved junk that we have?

&gt;Anyone in Europe with access to a few good wrecking yards
&gt;want to go
&gt;into business?
