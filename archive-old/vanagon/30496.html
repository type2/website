Subject: Re: LiMBO want ad ... more camper crazies! ... :)


i get htis newsletter and i would recommend it. the newsletter is usually 4 full pages  (on 8.5&quot; x  11&quot; 
paper folded over in half). the aesthetic quality isn't the greatest but whaddya expect for $6.00 per 
year?

i like the newsletter for westy contacts and finding old camper parts.
