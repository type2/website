Subject: Country Homes Camper?

Excuse me for barging in here, don't even own a Vanagon yet; however 
I do own two other vehicles with horizontally opposed 
aircooled(oop's wrong list!) engines one two cylinder the other six 
--- and looking for a four to complete the set ;-)  Which brings me 
to why I am here, I am looking at a 90 Vanagon GL camper with 40K 
miles driven by a little old lady -- really she is selling it, it 
seems to be in good condition too.   
The camper conversion was done by an outfit called Country Homes 
Camper in Scotts Valley California. Since it is not the Westy(not 
trying to be cool here, I just can't remember how to spell the 
proper name) I am trying to establish the value of this vehicle and 
the quality of the camper conversion compared to the Westy.  

It has a 2 burner propane stove, frig and sink and two batteries and 
a pop up camper top. The top is 3/4 length that pops straight up, 
sounds like the Rivera conversion mentioned elsewhere on this list. 
Does anyone have any experience with this conversion, or know what 
the current value is?  It seems to be well maintained, the original 
tires were recently replaced, some fuel hoses replaced and a new 
water pump, she mentioned it has a weak AC which the mechanics have 
been unable to improve. 
The only problem I have with the vehicle it that it is an automatic, 
I would prefer a manual transmission so as not to waste any of that 
little engines power. I am planning to test drive it later this 
week, any tips or stuff to look for. 
She is asking $15,000 which seems a bit high;  however she may be 
negotiable. Any information on this conversion would be appreciated.
