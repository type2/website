Subject: Re: Whistle in Engine

/I have a new sound I could use some help decoding on my '71.  It's a 
/subtle
/high pitched (whistle like) sound that doesn't appear to be directly
/related to wheel speed.  It occurs in all gears (well, I'm sure of 2-4, 
/but
/the engine revs in 1st might drown it out) but does go away when I press
/the clutch in at least half way.

I also have ahigh pitched whistle in my engine, related to
engine speed. I have been told it was my generator bushings
are getting a little loose. (After only 250k miles and 12 sets
of brushes? They must not make these things right!)
