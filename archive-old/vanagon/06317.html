Subject: alternative Big Sur sites

Martha,

Here's my opinion of the various campgrounds in Big Sur:

Pfeifer: 10	Great sites, all tile showers...nicest I've seen. 
		Redwoods, oaks, river gorge. 
Ventana: 9 	Redwoods. Showers not as nice but OK. A few hookups. 
Fernwood: 7 	Sites nice, but showers just barely adequate, and too
		near highway bars. Some hookups. Some sites right on the river.
