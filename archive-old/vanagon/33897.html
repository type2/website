Subject: Kill switch/ignition idea

&gt;Martin, I ended up doing the same thing because the electrical part of my 
&gt;switch is bad. I don't know if anyones suggested that and don't remember 
&gt;if your switch was new. Anyway, someday I'll get around to replacing the 
&gt;switch, but I've gotten used to the kill switch....and with the locking 
&gt;steering column, it's kinda nice; leave bus warming up and don't have to 
&gt;worry about anyone stealing it--oh yeah, that's cause my key isn't 
&gt;required anymore to keep bus running.
&gt;
&gt;Take care! Joe
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I like it...but I have this idea that I thought I'd shoot past you.
 What if I were to connect the coil wire from the ignition switch to the
 hot wire that leads from the fuse box up to the kill switch?  That way
 the key would work normally but I could flip the switch to prevent someone
 from starting the van.

                      |                  |
                      hot                coil
                     (big red)           wire        
                      |                  | 
                      .......................
                      . ignition switch     .......starter............
                      .                     .......head lights........
                      ..............................dome lights........

 Would this work? or would I end up frying everything again?
