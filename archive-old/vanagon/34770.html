Subject: Should I buy a bus?

Hi,

Question: Should I sell my =9186 Honda Civic and buy a bus?

I know the answer is yes but I am looking for some advice from the head, =
not
the heart. I haven=92t owned a bus before and I will need it for every da=
y transport
and trips at weekends etc. I am mechanically inclined and don=92t mind ha=
ving to do
the odd bit to keep it running etc., but my finances are limited.

So I would be grateful for any options or advice on what type I should be=
 looking at, the=20
practicality of everyday use etc.=20

Also is there anybody in the Sacramento area who could help me look for a=
 bus, give advice,=20
go for a few beers?

Soon to be ex-Honda owner.

Paul Underwood.

P.S. Anybody want to swap a =9186 Honda for a bus..????
