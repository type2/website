Subject:       Syncro CV Madness..

Hi Everyone.  I made a few enquiries regarding CV boots and joints 
for a 1990 Syncro, and this is what I have to report;

First off, all $$ are in CDN.

CV-JOINTS
front axle inner $167.88 each
front axle outer $101.67 each    
rear axle            $208.90 each   all four joints same price.


CV-BOOTS

front axle inner $167.88 each
front axle outer $86.39  each

rear axle             $39.85 each  all four boots same price


CV-JOINT REPACKING

I also enquired how much it costs to get the CV-Joints repacked.  
They (VW) say 2.8 hours labour per axle.  A syncro has 4 axles.  The 
labour rate is $75/hr, and then there are steel bands, and extra bits 
&amp; pieces to do the job along with grease, etc.  Total bill for all 
four axles is $820 labour, plus bits.... so $900 would be the bill.

Would this be worth to do or let the pieces fail and replace as you 
go?  Any advice would be appreciated.  So far with 114000 km (around 
70000 miles) there have been no problems with the joints on my van, 
and they have never been opened.

TIA

Harry.
