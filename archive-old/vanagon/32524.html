Subject: re: proprane heaters

&gt;   I was looking through j.c. jipme and they sell a propane engine
&gt;   heater
&gt; that is designed to keep yer coolant warm overnight.  Would this work
&gt; to heat a bus if it were hooked up to a heater core?  The engine
&gt; heater says it cranks out 5,000 BTU's.  Does anyone have one of these?
&gt;  It's on page 8 of the nov catalog.  What do you think?

&gt; -----------------
 In theory, it should work, but you'd also need a recirc pump to keep 
 the coolant moving (may come with the heater), and some way of 
 getting air movement over the heater cores without killing the 
 battery too fast.... Big buses use this principal - my father-in-law 
 has a 35' MCI with a diesel heater which serves to preheat the engine 
 (no glow plugs on the big diesels...) AND heat the interior. Even has 
 a thermostat inside to control the flow through the radiators. 
 
 ps: A simple low current fan can be used from any PC - they're 12V, 
 small, and very quiet. I suspect the power use would be less than the 
 built in fan...
