&gt; Jeff, what you described was either a Winnebago Ev, or could have been a 
&gt; Westy EV. However, if it was a Westy EV, it was probably a Canadian vehicle, 
&gt; as the only Westy version of the EV to be sold in the States was the MV 
&gt; Weekender, which was the MV with a poptop, louvered window on the driver's 
&gt; side and a small electric cooler under the rear jumpseat.

Grumble grumble

&gt; However, the Westphalia versions are ALIVE AND WELL in Europe. There are 
&gt; three major types of Westy T4s build and sold overthere. There's the 
&gt; &quot;Weekender MV&quot; like the one we got here in 93...there's the traditional 
&gt; pop-top camper, and there's one with a raised roof which has a bunk for two, 
&gt; sliding glass windows and a couple of large storage cabinets in the forward 
&gt; part of the roof.

Yup, and thanks to Michael Heron, you can see pictures of them on the
web at http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/westfalia
