Sure, if you go to the shop to have it done, it will cost plenty! But since the 
original message mentioned re-assembling the engine in the garage, It sounds 
that this is a home-build rebuild job, and Joe would be providing the labor. The 
$30.00 figure is what a local shop charges me to thrust cut a bare case.
If this is a used engine that Joe purchased and is just swapping flywheels, then 
he should get his money back!

&gt; Oh NO! Sounds like the pounded rear main bearing syndrome to me! What is

the

&gt; installed a standard thrust bearing in a case that has a single thrust cut, or

&gt; the journal is worn, and needs to be cut. You will need to disassemble the 
&gt; engine to do this. Good news is that it should only cost you about $30.00 for 
&gt; the work.
This is a joke, right?  Disassembling the engine is MAJOR cost.  Isn't 
the gasket set itself over $300?  
checking.....
$189.95 from parts place.
With seals and bearings should put the job at about $400 before labor.
Yikes.
