Thourouhly check the pilot bearing and the transmission main shaft.  This is
the usuall caused of clutch disk hub failure.  If the shaft is worn at all in
the pilot bearing area, it is garbage.  New shaft will cost about $65.00.
 Only the bell housing needs to be removed to replace it.  You can do it!
