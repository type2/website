Mark,

First, remove the silver colored &quot;step&quot; in the sliding doorway (4
screws) this will allow you to pick up the carpet.  After draping the
carpet over the back bench seat and removing the carpet padding (picks
right up), simply slide the center seat onto the rails and bolt in place
through the holes on the bottom rails of the seat.  It takes 4 8mm
bolts, short ones, to hold it in place.
