Subject:  Blue goo question

I think I've been hosed by my mechanic.  I bought some phosphate free
anti-freeze from the VW dealer (3 gallons) with the intention of
flushing and replacing my fluid.  I was too busy and was having other work
done so I asked my mechanic to do it.  I got the car back and the stuff
in the overflow tank looks pretty green to me -- just like the typical
anti-freeze.

I never opened the VW anti-freeze but have heard from you all that its
blue.  Is it really noticeably blue?  This stuff looks very very green.
Did I get ripped off?  Could I be mistaken?  Thanks for any help.  Please
cc: me or e-mail direct.
