Subject: vanagon headers

I've been thinking about making a set of headers for the 2.1.  I have
already made a muffler using a straight through glass pack.  I was unwilling
to spend over $100.00 on a new OEM type muffler.  Is there anyone who has
experience in header fabrication, or know of someone who builds headers.  I
would like so ideas and pointers before I try it.  Books tell alot, but
experienced insight would be invaluable.  TIA
