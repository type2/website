Subject: Eurovan Westfalia FS in Seattle

I passed a nice looking EV for sale today. It was a short-wheelbase
Westfalia, multivan style. Pop top, beds and an ice box I think, with seats
for 7. Unusual emerald green color. I didn't get the phone number, but if
anyone is seriously interested, email me and I'll try to track it down.
