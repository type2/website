&gt;Last week a co-worker fell asleep at the wheel, drove off the road at
&gt;60 MPH, hit a driveway embankment, launched over that and was stopped
&gt;by a tree... the car, a '95 GM wagon, is totalled.  the air bag
&gt;deployed (don't know the exact point) and he had his seat-belts on.
&gt;he ended up with a small scratch on his wrist on a sore chest from
&gt;the air bag.  walked away from the crash and got a ride on down to
&gt;his business meeting that afternoon.

&gt;draw yer own conclusions.

uhhhh ... he wasn't wearing a g-string either??
