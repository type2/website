Subject: bye bye for now.

        Well the ex has finally axed my access to her account so Ill be
without for about a week. I managed to get a side job doing web pages for
some poeple at the UofA so I guess Ill be getting a free acount there
sometime next week. Until then though Ill be listless. (sob).
        Have a good week.....I know I wont. You never really realize how
much you use email and the net till its gone. 

ciao.
