&gt;So...eventually, as the bus people found out about the Vanagon list, the bus
&gt;mail would drown out the Vanagon mail. 
[snip!}
&gt;But I wonder if over the next two years as the internet explodes 5x yet
&gt;again, whether the current mix of articles between busses and Vanagons
&gt;(50-50%?) will still continue. There are a *lot* of 'dem pesky busses out
&gt;there. 

Yaaawn! Yes, there are technical/mechanical differences among the
vehicles. So what? I'm a potential split, vanagon, or Eurovan buyer and I
find most posts interesting. It's not just about mechanical issues. It's
about a state of mind, a passion. Martha found the right words. Maybe
someday in the future, there will be too many people on this list. Then a
split will come about naturally. But not today.
