&gt;I would agree with fixing rather than waiting for the gaskets to blow.
&gt;Granted, not all engines are the same, but we had a 63 Buick with a V-6
&gt;(cast iron, not alluminum) that, when it blew a head gasket, the increased
&gt;pressure of coolant leaking into one of the cylinders while it was running
&gt;at freeway speed literally pounded a hole through a piston.  Even if that
&gt;didn't happen in the Vanagon, I'd be worried about the hammering of the Rod
&gt;bearing by this increase in pressure (if the leak is INTO the cylinder,
&gt;that is).

The haed gaskets that leak coolant on a Vanagon are entirely different than
the head gaskets on most other &quot;normal&quot; cars.  A &quot;normal&quot; head gasket (like
on a Jetta or Eurovan) does dual duty in sealing both the combustion chambers
and the coolant passages.  The Vanagon head gaskets that leak only do the job
of keeping the coolant inside the engine.  Compression sealing is seperate on
a Vanagon and not generally suspetible to leaks like the coolant gasket.
