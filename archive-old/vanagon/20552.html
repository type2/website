Subject: No Start - Vanagon



Has anyone else had a problem of an intermitent no
start on a 1.9 Wasserboxer Vanagon?  Usually happens
with a warm engine. No signs of flooding.  Has spark.
Wait 15 or 20 minutes, and it starts and runs fine.
Recent plugs, cap, rotor, air and fuel filters.

Any ideas??
