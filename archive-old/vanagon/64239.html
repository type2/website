&lt;&lt; I was driving down rte 6 in Eastham (CapeCod) Ma and saw the strangest
 vannagon conversion!  It was alot like the old bus conversions to an RV
back.
 It had the front end of a vanagon (round headlights) but behind the front
 doors it had a wider body like a truck camper.  Plus it had an
 overhanging top where I assume there was a bed.  It was goig by the
 opposite way so I didnt get a good look at it.  Anybody out there own it?

It could have been a LT series w/ a custom motorhome conversion...I know a
guy in Jersey (Volkstech VW repair) has one....
