Yeah, so my computer died the other night and took with it
all of my old documents about VW vans.  One in particular 
I'm missing is the one that is the basic overview of all
vans from like 1950-1994.  It was was only about 3 or 4 pages
long but it had things to look for when making a purchase. 
A friend of mine is looking for a bus and I told them &quot;Sure
I've got that on my computer!&quot; which of course I don't now.


    I remember that file,  and thought it heavily biased towards the 72-79
buses (I wonder what the author drove)  and scant/partly incorrect on
information on pre-67 rigs.  Maybe I'll write one myself,  reflecting the
beauty and soul of the vintage bus,   a practical workhorse to this day.
