Subject: 3.2 liter Porsche engine in Vanagon Syncro


On my way into work this morning I dropped by my mechanic to see if I
could video the undersides of a '87 passenger syncro that has a Porsche
3.2 liter engine installed (MSDS kit). It was having its spare
transmission installed. 
(Hey Steve Johnson, its on your video)
Well it was off the rack, so I could only get some shots of the engine
compartment. It is a very clean and accessable installation. The dry sump
is on the right hand side, taking up some of the space where a battery
could go and through the wheel well. The compartment lid had a bit of the
foam cut-out for the airflow meter. To check all of the spark plugs you
have to remove the airflow meter on one side, and the freash air fan on
the other side.
But the big news is that I got to go for a ride in it. Its a hoot! The
sound of that engine is wonderful. The acceleration is amazing. We were in
the city so we couldn't really get going, but you do get pushed back into
the seat. The granny gear was fun, with that motor roaring in the back and
the van just meandering along.
All in all its a very nice transplant.

Alistair
