&gt;Anyone know why when using Microsoft's Exchange mail program to post to =
&gt;the list, you get &quot;=3D&quot; signs at the end of each line? This bugs me...

Well, I'm usually better _at_ troubleshooting computer-type problems than
bus-type problems so:  According to a great web site
(www.creativelement_dot_com/w95ann) therez a bug in Exchange that displays this
symptom.  Under Internet Mail Properties, click on General.  Select Message
Format then Character Set.  Change the character set from ISO-8859-2 (or
whatever) to US ASCII.  Watch your problems disappear.

I dunno, I try to stay away from MS products if I can help it.  Too much
hype, not enough testing IMHO.
--------VW stuff follows --&gt;
Oh yeah, thanks to all who responded to my post about the '79 Bust.  I pried
the cover off of the air flow sensor and cleaned the contacts.  There was
some crud towards the left (full throttle) end of the sensor.  After doing
this the bus would idle great _at_ higher speeds (it used to cut out).
However, it still has no power.  If I stomp on the gas in N or P it revs up
like it could drag the house off its foundation.  Put it in gear
and...and...and...well anyway, it revs up great.

After warming up the engine to +operating temps, I can hear some sort of
&quot;knock&quot; &quot;tock&quot; kind of noise coming from the right side of the motor.  I
probably need to remove the engine and take it to a VW doctor but I'm way,
way too cheap.

&quot;Will solve PC/Unix/Mac problems for VW repair...&quot;
