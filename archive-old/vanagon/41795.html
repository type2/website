Subject: 1980 Volkswagon Vanagon/WestFalia

I'm relocating and must sell my beloved 1980 Volkswagon 
Vanagon/Westfalia camper.  It has a rebuilt engine, many new
parts, no rust, spotless interior.  I want *very* little money for it.
(I'd say how little, but I assume it's bad manners to talk prices 
here.)  If anybody out there is interested or can recommend a 
contact for selling this vehicle I'd appreciate hearing from you.  
I'm in Waterbury, CT, 203-266-5652, 75166.525_at_compuserve_dot_com.  
Thanks.
