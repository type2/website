I received the below note today and as I have very little knowledge of the
'77 models, I ask the list to help this guy out.  Thank you in advance.

&gt; I'm about to buy a 1977 VW Type 11 Camper Van, and would really like to
&gt; find out ,more info before buying. Can you help me? I'm in Canada and
&gt; the price is $5000.00 in Canadian Dollars.Is this a good price.? The van
&gt; is in great shape with only 77,000 miles. Please email me back if you
&gt; can at nocturn_at_ibm_dot_net  Thanks!!Douglas

Thanks,
