All,
I hope ya'll don't mind too much, but these were seen in the Austin
Chronicle. I haven't seen these, so my info is limited to what you read
here:

All numbers are in 512 area code

1971 VW BUS no first gear, carb. needs rebuild $700 OBO 480-9117

1977 VW POPTOP camper, good body(wolf whistle here), dead motor, basket
case $350. Kip 440-0018

1978 BUS partially restored, Many new parts, 1300 OBO 323-9649

1979 BUS $2500, 1973 bus $2200, new parts exceed vehicles value.
312 E 43rd.  371-7351

I could go and look at these for someone, my judgement is not that great,
I work during the day, so it would be tough making arrangements with the
owners(I could try though), and my wife would not be keen on looking at
these with me.
I would jump on a couple of these, but finances are tough, and for now
I will have to remain a wana-bus
