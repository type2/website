Subject: ignition switch wiring '71

Here is how I have wired my ignition switch on my '71 bus.

       SWITCH SIDE                    
   large red wire ----------large red wire (hot to battery)
   red wire w/black stripe--red w/black (starter)
   small brown--------------small grey&amp;black (dome lights)
   yellow w/black-----------black (headlight switch)
   black--------------------black (to coil)*

   * I had to replaced the black wire to the coil as this is the one
     that fried big time when I turned on the key after grounding my
     ignition kill switch by accident (removed the kill switch altogether)

    Now when I turn the key to the starter it turns over but won't start
    until I release the key...which means it's not getting juice to the
    coil when the starter is on...why?  Is there some kind of relay that's
    bad?  I tried replacing the switch with a new one and got the same
    results.

    Any ideas?

    Martin
