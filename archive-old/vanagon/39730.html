lation of Engine Oil Temp. Sensors

In an earlier article now archived in the 'sermon' file, I
described how to install an oil temperature gauge on an upright
engine.  The instant the article hit the web people rolled it up
and commenced thumping me over the head.  

&quot;Bad dog!  Bad, bad dog!  The threaded fitting you describe only
exists on the early-model magnesium crankcases.&quot;

Not entirely true.  It is also present on early Type IV engines. 
But the point was well taken.  I slunk off to the shop to ponder
the error of my ways.  

There were a number of engines in the shop at that time.  I
dragged a late-model crankcase under the workbench and began
rubbing it on my belly.  When I was done, it was fitted with a
spiffy oil temperature sender.

                       Pulling the Plug

On late-model magnesium crankcases, and on the later Type IV's as
well, the drilled passage for the oil pick-up tube is sealed with
a pressed-in aluminum cup rather like a freeze plug but installed
flanged-side inward.  The use of aluminum plugs to seal the
drilled oil passages in the crankcase is standard practice with
Volkswagen.

Pulling the plug is crossing the Rubicon with regards to
installing an oil temperature sender.  Make sure you are prepared
to deal with the hole or your engine-building career is over.  To
pull the plug I drilled a 1/8&quot; hole in the center, threaded in a
#8 sheet-metal screw and popped it out with a slap-hammer.

When you pull the plug you'll discover the passage behind it is
19mm in diameter, close enough to 3/4&quot; so the difference is of no
matter.  The place where the plug seats is even larger, about
.85&quot; in diameter, which just happens to match the small-end of a
1/2&quot;-NPT pipe-thread tap.  Your first urge will be to hammer a
pipe tap into the hole and start twisting.  Resist.

                      Cracking the Crankcase

Pipe threads are tapered.  Tightening a tapered plug into a
tapered hole is an old-fashioned and eminently reliable means of
insuring a leak-free fit.  When you install a full-flow oil
filtration system you thread the main oil gallery to accept a
3/8&quot;-NPT fitting.

Frankly, tapered fittings are not the best thing to use on
Volkswagen engines, they just happen to be the best thing that is
commonly available.  With magnesium castings there is some risk
that the tapered, threaded fittings will be over-torqued, causing
the wedge-effect to split the casting.  When the hole you are
trying to tap is a cylinder rather than a cone, you run into the
same problem -- too much muscle applied to the tapered tap can
crack the case.  To reduce this risk to an acceptable level, the
hole to be threaded should be step-drilled or reamed to a taper. 
The common electrician's tapered reamer is a close match to the
National Pipe Thread taper and the reamers are widely available
in sizes suitable for fittings up to 1/2&quot;-NPT.

I used a tapered reamer to shape the 19mm hole then tapped it to
accept a 1/2&quot;-NPT fitting.  The oil temperature sensor I'm using
happens to be threaded 1/8&quot;-NPT and adapters for this combination
are commonly available in both brass and aluminum, the latter
from aircraft or racing equipment suppliers.

           Where To Take the Engine's Temperture

Normal body temperature for humans is 98.6 degrees on the
Fahrenheit scale but what you see on the thermometer depends on
where you stick it.

With Volkswagen engines the oil pick-up gallery is the ideal spot
to stick your oil temperature sensor because the oil is in
constant motion, flowing past the sensor on its way to the oil
pump.  The temperature of this oil stream will closely reflect
the temperature of the working oil in the sump.

VDO makes a very handy temperature sensor -- for its own line of
gauges -- that is threaded 14mm x 1.50, the same thread as the
sump's drain plug.  In use, the drain plug is replaced by the VDO
sensor, which comes with a bobbin-type electrical terminal
allowing easy connection and disconnection of the wire.  But the
sump's drain-plug is not in the main stream of flowing oil, and
the sump is cooled by the passage of air under the vehicle.  The
reading you obtain from such a sensor will always be lower than
the temperature of the oil entering the pump.  The difference is
not large and is probably of little significance.  If your only
option is to use a sump-mounted sensor, then by all means do so.

Of course, you may thread a brass 1/2&quot;-NPT adapter to accept the
VDO sensor and install the VDO sensor in the oil
pick-up gallery.  Start with a half-inch to eighth-inch adapter,
drill it out to 31/32&quot;, and tap 14mm x 1.50.

                      Other Ways to Stick It

Another option I explored was using a straight tap.  The 19mm
bore is close enough to 3/4&quot; that it will accept a shallow thread
from a 3/4&quot;-16 tap but the resulting thread is so shallow it will
not hold a bolt threaded 3/4-16.  My solution to this was to turn
a special adaptor on the lathe, making it large enough to fill
the shallow threads I was able to cut in the oil pick-up gallery
with a standard 3/4&quot;-16 tap.  There is enough metal in such an
adapter to drill &amp; tap it for any of the common oil temperature
sensors, including the old Stewart-Warner 5/8-11 sensors.

Early Type IV engines use a threaded plug to seal the oil pick-up
gallery, the same method used on the early-model magnesium
crankcases.  Standard adapters are available for this plug,
allowing an oil temperature sensor to be mounted there.  That
works fine if the Type IV engine is in an airplane.  In a bus,
the rear engine mount blocks access to the threaded fitting.

Generally, any oil temperature sensor mounted in the sump will
show a lower temperature than the main stream of 'working'
lubricant.  This is because the sump has some obvious stagnation
points, such as the corners.  

Since Universal Replacement crankcases were introduced it has
been common practice to use the Type III oil-filler hole in the
lower right rear corner of the sump as a handy place to mount an
oil temperature sensor.  Indeed, the cover plate supplied with
most Universal Replacement crankcases often includes a threaded
boss just for this purpose.  But the oil in contact with the
sensor is going to be quite a bit cooler than you'd expect. 
Having gone through all the trouble of instrumenting your engine
it would seem foolish to settle for inaccurate data.

                    Using the Sump-plate Bump

Type IV engines, both early and late, have an ideal means of
installing an oil temperature sensor.  On the lower right
'corner' of the sump there is a mysterious round metal plate,
90mm (3 inches) in diameter.  It is fastened with two cheese-head
machine screws and sealed with an O-ring.  The plate is not in
the mainstream flow of oil but as a mounting for a temperature
sensor its convenience is unsurpassed.  

The sump plate has a small pimple in the middle, a narrow berm
running between the screw holes.  You may drill this out and
braze in a pipe threaded adaptor to accept the common temperature
sensors or you may drill and tap the adaptor to accept the VDO
sensor.

                  Adapters You Should Avoid

For those unwilling to exert the modest effort needed to properly
instrument their engine there is a special adaptor that screws
into the oil pressure sensor port.  The adapter will accept a VDO
oil temperature sensor, with the oil pressure sensor left hanging
off the side.  This has to be the worst idea anyone has ever come
up with for measuring oil temperature since there can be no oil
flow at all in such a dead-ended adapter.  Indeed, the thing is
liable to capture a bubble of air and provide wildly inaccurate
data for both pressure and temperature.  In the latter case, the
temperature shown on the gauge will in fact be the temperature of
the crankcase, not the oil.  But seeing how easy it is to
install, I'm sure it will be wildly popular.

                   J.C.Whitney Gauges

The gauges I installed in the overhead console of my '65 bus were
purchased from J. C. Whitney and include oil pressure, oil
temperature, voltmeter, tachometer and an engine hour meter, the
latter mostly to maintain the symmetry of the panel.  The gauges
are attractive and have identical facings.  They are advertised
as 'Illuminated Precision Electric Gauges' and they are. 
Illuminated.  Reasonably accurate.  Electrically powered. 
Gauges.  The full set cost about $125 1995 dollars.  The oil
pressure sender is a canister about two inches across by an inch
and a half high fitted with a 1/8&quot;-NPT inlet.  I used a brass
'street-el' fitting to install it and the oil pressure warning
switch in the same hole.  This might not work on a Type IV due to
tin-ware interference.  I've not yet completed the T4 engine I'm
overhauling; I'll tell you how I did it after I figure out how
I'm going to do it.

The oil temperature gauge is reasonable precise, based on testing
it with boiling water.  It also matches the readings of the
Stewart-Warner gauge that was originally installed on that
engine.  Ditto for oil pressure, as compared to a mechanical
gauge.  Since the readings are relative, their precision is not
vital, only their accuracy.  After more than a year of use, they
have shown no unusual behavior.

                           Sermonette

Idiot lights are bleeding wounds.  By the time an idiot light
comes on the situation is usually out of control.  Proper engine
management calls for more data than can be provided by a two-
state signal.

Instruments showing oil temperature, oil pressure, revolutions
per minute, and the functioning of the alternator represent about
four percent of the cost of a properly built engine.  And that is
a one-time cost.  People spend more for chrome tin-ware, fancy
hub caps or sound systems that only disturb their neighbors and
consider the money well spent.

Idiot lights indeed.
