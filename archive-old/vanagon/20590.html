I found a great way to keep those piece-au-shit (like mine) vanagons running
and be able to have hassle -ree trips. 

Buy a FORD full-towing truck. The ones that actually put the whole car/van on
their bed. Put the van on the truck, and drive the truck wherever your heart
desires, unload the VAN and camp galore! Do the same to get back home!
This towing-truck is absolutely the ultimate VW owner companion. Don't leave
home without it.
