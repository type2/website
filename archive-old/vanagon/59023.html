I trust your trip went well, and the canoe stayed on top OK.  I however do
not like the foam blocks as a way to transport canoes.  As one member
mentioned if you do use foam blocks use some sort of belly (or middle)
strap.  I have had a canoe slip to the side a fair amount.  I do not think
it would have come off, but it is not as stable as should be.

My recommendation is to use roof racks that attach to the gutter.  I use
Yakima, but Thule or a cheaper imitation would do.  The advantage hear is
you place the canoe on the crossbars and then use ropes from the inside,
over the canoe and down to the outside;  drawing real tight using a
&quot;truckers knot&quot;.  This knot  uses a loop in the rope that you pass the rope
through after going around the crossbar.  Then pull tight.  I know this
isn't a good description of the knot, but see if you can find some info on
knots.  Anyway, no way the canoe will move.  My canoe club uses this
technique exclusively.  I've carried 3 canoes (one stacked on top of two
side by side on the crossbars) with no problem.  But not three on the
vanagon.  This would be so high!!!!

Another listee mentioned Temagami.  Been there but back in the eighties.  A
great one week canoe camping trip.

Good luck
