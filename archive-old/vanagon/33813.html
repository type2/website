The aftermarket parts guy tells me my noisy lifter ('84 Wasserbox) can be 
replaced by pulling the rocker arm, and yanking the part right out of the 
case via the tubes - no head removal required. Sounds like tricky surgery, 
pulling that slick piece through the tube and all. And how do I know which 
lifter it is in the first place.

I've been living on CD-2 lifter-quieter-oil-additive for a couple years... a 
can with every-other oil change. It works good, but seems like a short term 
fix; and I'm not about to sell. The clatter always goes away after warming 
up, but it makes my skin crawl to hear that noise when I start.

Anyone been through this one before?
