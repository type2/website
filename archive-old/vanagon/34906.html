Subject: Re:  sliding door vent window

&gt;I guess this is my first official posting to the list seeking
&gt;help regarding a bus that I OWN now :) .  OK, this is a '78 bus
&gt;and the lower pivot for the sliding door vent window has rotted
&gt;away and is now nonexistent.  This means that I must replace
&gt;something.  Bentley says how to get it out and in so that's not
&gt;the problem.  I'm wondering if I have to buy a whole new frame
&gt;or if the frame is in pieces and I could buy the bottom piece
&gt;separately?
I think it's all one piece.

&gt;Is the frame readily available from a FLAPS or
&gt;maybe a FLforeignAPS (I have a good one at home in Tennessee) or
&gt;is this more than likely to be a junkyard item?  Prolly junkyard
FLAPS, Foreign or otherwise, don't have things like this.  If RMMW, Wolfberg
West, etc. don't have it then you'll have to get it at a junkyard.

&gt;if I can find one in good shape.  Also, has anyone else had to
&gt;remove that window?  Is it as easy as it looks? (I know, it's
&gt;never as easy as it looks, but just checking.)  Hints,
&gt;suggestions, ideas???
Drill out the rivet at the front pivot, remove the door panel and then remove
the screw holding the clamp on the lower pivot, then remove the window and
frame.
