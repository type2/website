Subject: Re: Upgrade valves on a 2 liter rebuild?

&gt; 
&gt; It looks like my '76 Westfalia is going to need to have the engine rebuilt.
&gt;  Does anyone know if it's worth having hydrolic(sp?) valve lifters
&gt; installed.  It costs more, but does it make the engine last longer, require
&gt; less maintanence or anything like that?  Or should I just go with the
&gt; original specs.   Are there any other modifications I can do at this tme to
&gt; make a better engine?   
&gt;  

Others probably have more information on this, but the heads with hydraulic
valves require a different pushrod, which means putting in a crank from a 
'78-'79.  Or maybe it was just the hydraulic lifters that needed the different
length/diameter/whatever pushrods.

Or so I was told when I my '76 was rebuilt.
