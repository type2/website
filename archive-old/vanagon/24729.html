I also lost the driver door pocket, steering wheel column cover, and most 
of the little plastic covers and assorted parts that hold the A/C up.

Was an '86 GL

&gt; Dan's list of potential problems to look for on a 1987
&gt; Vanagon looks familiar to this '84 owner.  I would add one

&gt; 
&gt;               PLASTIC
&gt; 
&gt; Driver door pocket, front heater core cover, steering wheel
&gt; column cover, rear speaker bracket, instrument cluster
&gt; cover, instrument cluster base.
&gt; 
&gt; All of those on my '84 have cracked, broken or fallen off
&gt; entirely.
