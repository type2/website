Subject: oil filler

Hey all,
I know you all probably knew about this forever, but I just discovered
tonight that the oil filler tube actually extends out so you can pour
the oil in without spilling!  That's really clever and I never would
have even guessed it worked like that if I hadn't been looking through
the Haynes manual.

I'm really impressed with the design of the Vanagon as compared to the
Bus, tho I really like the Bus fusebox location better, you can pull it
down and turn it around easier.  Too many wires on that Vanagon fusebox!

Neat-o

Sean
