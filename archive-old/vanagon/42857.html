Subject: The Tires that Roared (Vanagon)

Hi All,

My road-testing of the 84 Vanagon the other day uncovered a noisey 
problem.  It was a load roaring sound that was very objectionable to my 
wife.  I feared a wheel bearing which I inspected last night.  The 
bearing wasn't in great shape, but it was ok.  My attentions then turned 
to the strangley cupped front tires (Continental Contis, not too old).  
There were no signs of slipped belts, but I had new spare Continental 
'Transporter' 8 plies as spares in my 84 GL and 84 parts van so I aired 
them up (wow, 55 lbs of pressure max.) and put them on front.  It was an 
instant fix.  It now rides quite and my wife will ride in it!  BBTA here 
we come!  8-)
