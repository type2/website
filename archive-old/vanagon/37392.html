Subject: the CCC's hit Europe (midwest stopover!)



To make use of some frequent flier miles while I can still do so
to the best advantage, I'm flying to Europe next week.  The miles
are on TWA, so will be stopping for a lay over at their hub in
St. Louis.  If I recall correctly, I'll have like 5-7 hours to kill
in the airport there, waiting for the connecting flight, and thought
I'd mention this in case anyone from the list is or will be in
the vicinity.  The date is Wednesday, March 20.  I have to look
up the times, but I think it's around 2.p.m. until after dinnertime,
St. Louis time.  

Let me know if your interested in getting together.  Bradley Prunehead
will be there too, as we plan to visit his brother in Germany, where'll
we get to borrow his bro's VW Eurovan T4.  (Cool!).  Anyway, would be
fun if we can get a little group together at the airport, perhaps
for late lunch, early dinner, whatever.  We promise not to explode
stuff in your airport, I swear.  :)
