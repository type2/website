Thought I'd offer myself up on a plate ..... 

What does it mean to be &quot;sexist&quot;?

Who really cares?

A picture of a nude girl....shown to a member of the same sex...... so what?

I see magazines like Playgirl around and ads for Jordache showing off 
some guy's sexy buns....so what? It's just another picture to me. I grew 
up seeing buns on my brothers, buddies, etc. Go to any beach in the world 
and see buns outlined by bikinis everhwhere....so what...what's new?

Other than possibly scaring the girl with the notion someone had been in 
her car improperly (anything left there in an obvious way would have 
spooked her), it seems like a fine joke to me.

If some female at work with a short skirt flashes her legs around, or 
whatever, should men holler that she's sexist for calling special 
attention to sexual content of some sort (legs or whatever)? I think this 
&quot;policatically correct&quot; stuff gets old pretty fast.
