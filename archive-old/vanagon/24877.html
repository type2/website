&gt; I have done it on a Baja, but quite honestly, I doubt that it is possible

I did it once about ten years ago just to see if it could be done, and
it CAN be done. But, frankly, it is easier for to pull the engine than
to get the engine lid on straight again (you have to remove the lid
to get the fan out).
