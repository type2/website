Dear Suniga &amp; Tonya,

	The &quot;spring&quot; you see in the formed wall should attach to the table.
	Mine got stuck last year. I eventually pulled it loose, nicking the platic
wall slightly. I removed the two screws and the spring/latch mechanism. I
haven't gotten around to realigning and reinstalling the latch. My table
stays pretty much in place without the latch.
	Mine is a 91 Carat, but I'm sure it's the same setup. When aligned right,
it snaps shut. To open, push the table in toward the wall and it releases
and springs out (and loose) slightly. It can then be raised and locked in
the horizontal position.
