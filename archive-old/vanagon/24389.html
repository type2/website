NEWSFLASH::::::::::::


The bash is still on, however due the intense amount of rainfall
from the previous month, SanteFe River is posting a record hi-mark.
I just got off the phone with Oleno and they said it is still IFFY
that the river will be open to swimming. Canoeing is permissible
but only if you bring your own boat.

      * Entrance costs are 3.25 per vehicle with up to 8 people per....
      * Dry camping (no power) is 10.00 per night and with power 13.00
      * Each campsite has it's own grill (charcoal type) and obligatory campfire
        ring..Wood for said campfire will most likely be damp..so bring your own
        type 1 case as starter fuel (joke!)

      * No reservations are needed for campsites as they predict plenty
        will be available (last weekend was their big weekend &amp; they expect
        a decline each remaining week till November)

We will be there early saturday morning setting up and welcoming folk.
Look for a 21 window Blue/White/grey bus with a bunch of folk milling...
