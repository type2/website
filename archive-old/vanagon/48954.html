Subject: (green=phosphate?) was: Radiator Bleeding

Greetings and happy Friday! 
        
a question: is phosphate-free antifreeze necessarily NOT green? When I test
drove my Vanagon several months ago, the coolant level indicator came on.
The dealer promptly filled the expansion tank from a jug which was labeled
'phosphate free' but was bright green in color. Isn't the ethylene glycol
responsible for the green color (as opposed to the phosphate)?

Someone please enlighten me.

Pat

&gt;and have determined that 
&gt;there must be some of the &quot;bad&quot; antifreeze (w/ phosphate) in it.  I conclude 
&gt;this because it is green,
