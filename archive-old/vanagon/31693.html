Subject: Re: Old Bus Review/Wannabusers

To all--there will actually be somewhat more ads for buses and parts in 
the next OBR, as several more have trickled in. These included a '54 
Deluxe from Sweden (right-hand drive), two decent '67 Westys, a '61 
Single Cab, and many, many parts for sale. 

There is also talk about starting an on-line chapter of the club, which I 
am sure will be quite a busy one!

I will be happy to send a sample of Old Bus Review to anyone requsting it.
Send me your mailing address and it will be sent to you. Our pleasure!

&gt; Wannabusers:
&gt; 
&gt; The NEATO newsletter &quot;Old Bus Review&quot; should be hitting mail
&gt; boxes in the not-too-distant future.  I just finished typing
&gt; the For Sale ads for it.  FYI, 21 split-window buses, 7-bay
&gt; window and  2-Vanagons are listed for sale all over the USA.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw a few names familiar to the list (Yes, Jon and
&gt; Michael, you're in there).
&gt; 
&gt; And no, I don't give out &quot;early bird&quot; previews.  If you
&gt; REALLY wanted that bus, you would have already sent in your
&gt; membership dues.
