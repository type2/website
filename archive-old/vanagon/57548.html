Subject: re: EuroVan Tires

Ned (Rothstein, I think) was asking about EV tire options.  I recently
bought a set of reinforced sidewall Michelin MXL 205/65R15 tires from NTW 
for approx. $90 each.  These replaced the original Goodyear G64 that 
wore very well (replaced at 49K) but had become quite noisy.  What a
difference in ride noise level.  If you go with NTW, you'll have to convince 
them that a reinforced sidewall MXL exists, and also wait a few days for 
them to order them.
