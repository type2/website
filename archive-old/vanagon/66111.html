Subject:      transmission--Redline products

HI, everyone. I seem to have developed a serious whine in my Carat's
tranny, 4-speed.
Is there any other parts, other than the gears themselves, that would
cause this whine? I checked the gear lube level and it's full. I did run
it low for a while, but then it was difficult to shift and didn't make
any noise. Now it shifts OK, but is noisy when you are in a low gear and
let off the gas.

Also have called all over town looking for Redline products, but cannot
find anyone that carries them. Searched the web without any luck. If
anyone could put me on this company I would really appreciate....

Thanks!!
