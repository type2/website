Subject: Sharan news

Alright, it's not really news but I couldn't think of a witty title. I had a
look at my Dad's neighbour's new Sharan at the weekend. Very nice but
nothing like a bus. The headroom inside was suprisingly bad, it's difficult
to move around once you're inside and theres no way you can stand, even bent
over. Also some clowns in VWs marketing dept. decided not to put sliding
doors on it because they wanted to stress the point that its not a van. I
had real problems getting in the rearmost seats and it would be even worse
if the door couldn't be opened fully like in a carpark or garage. He was
enthusing about how huge the interior was. I would have shown him what real
space is all about but I didn't want to put down his new pride and joy so I
keep quiet. Hmmm, for the 18,000 pounds he paid for it I'd prefer a fleet of
concours buses. The best bit is the built in baby seat that folds out of the
backrest of one of the rear seats, and guess what? The fabric on it is
covered in cute cartoon Beetles :) It's a pity they didn't use split screen
buses.
