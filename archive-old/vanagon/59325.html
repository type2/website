Subject: Re: Heat in the footwells modification

&gt; 
&gt; Greetings.  Someone recently wrote that they had performed some kind of
&gt; modification to a Westie that diverted heat from the foot wells.  I have
&gt; believed that my AC was grossly underrated for the task of cooling the va=
&gt; n
&gt; particularly since the vents are only located in the rear.
&gt; 
&gt; This last weekend I was driving for a short period barefoot and I realize=
&gt; d
&gt; that the floorboards in the front of my Westie actually get really hot.  =
&gt; I
&gt; think this must be heat from the radiator or the coolant hoses running
&gt; under the floor.  =
&gt; 
&gt; I thought that the note had said the &quot;modification&quot; to fix this was liste=
&gt; d
&gt; in Bently.  I can't seem to find it anywhere.  I've also searched the
&gt; archives under all the crazy names I could think of.  Could someone pleas=
&gt; e
&gt; tip me off as to what and where the instructions for this mod are?  Ideal=
&gt; 
&gt; would be a Bentley section reference and any kind of keyword that would l=
&gt; et
&gt; me in on the insights of those that have already passed this way in the
&gt; archives.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to ask dumb Q's but I have a feeling this is gonna really improve m=
&gt; y
&gt; summer if It exists.
&gt; 
&gt; -ClarkClark,

the Information your looking for is on Pages 19.20 &amp; 19.21 I have done
