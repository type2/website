&gt;When you slide the middle row double seat out, do you have to remove the
&gt;carpet? In our 84 GL the carpet covers up the runners in the floor. I had
&gt;to cut a line in the carpet from the seat to the sliding door - is this
&gt;usual?
&gt;

Aaaarrrrgghhh!!!!!  DUH!!!  well, I guess now the damage is already done....

All you WOULD have had to do is unscrew the sliding door threshold, remove
the rear seat kickpanel, and pull up the carpet (it ain't glued down).....

too late now, I guess.....

another 7 pass with shredded carpet.....  :&lt;)
