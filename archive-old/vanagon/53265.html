Tim -

The cable between the front and the rear latching mechanisms has 
come loose from the rear pin.  Ther rear latch holds the door.

You'll have to remove the hardware on the panel, the front cover and 
the mechanism in the front that latches to the rear pillar.

Remove the panel itself and you'll see where the cable eye should 
be over a pin with a c-clip holding it in place.  The c-clip probably 
came off.  I found mine in the door.  

Use a plastic paint scraper modified into a two prong fork to assist in 
removing the press-in fasteners that hold the panel.

You might be able to slide the pin and open the door.

While you are in there, you would be well advised to remove both 
front and rear latching mechanisms and clean and grease every moving 
part.  When these start siezing, the handle gets the brunt of the wear 
and will pull out of the mechanism.  I have a 25 cent fix if it 
happens, but do the prevention and no need fix.

&gt; Yup, the sliding door on my '84 vanagon is stuck.  I tried to open it from 
&gt; the outside, and the handle felt and sounded like I disengaged the door 
&gt; mechanism (ya know what I mean, the sound and feel it makes when you open 
&gt; the door).  However, the door didn't open at all.  Simillarly, the inside 
&gt; handle has no tension on it, as if the door opening mechanism was stuck.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone encountered this before?  Please, all suggestions are welcome. 
&gt;  Thanks in advance.
