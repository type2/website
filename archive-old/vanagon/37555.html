&gt;Maybe, but I bet I know why they designed it that way.  When your right
&gt;foot is on the gas pedal and you need to step on the brake FAST, the distance

Also nice to be able to 'heel and toe' it, working clutch with left, 
throttle and brake with right.  Matches engine revs/trans/wheelspeed nicely, 
letting you double clutch and land in the desired gear with the engine on 
the boil, all while braking at max.
