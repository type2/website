Subject:      Yes, wheels... again! (long)

I think this is always a worthwhile subject to be reviewed often.  We all want
our vans to look great and new wheels is a sure bet way to make them look great.

Last night I tried swapping my '93 Audi 100 and '86 Vanagon wheels. The Audi
wears MSW brand 15X7 TYPE55 and the Vanagon wears MSW 15X7 TYPE21 wheels. Both
have a 5X112 bolt pattern. The center bore on the Audi is 57.1mm as are all late
VWs with the apparent exception of the Vanagon which somewhere between the 57.1
of the Audi and the 66.56 of a Mercedes -which is the intended fitment of my
TYPE21 wheels (I use a nylon sleeve to center the larger wheel bore on the van's
hub). Also the Audi wants an ET35 off-set whereas the Vanagon wants an ET21
off-set.

When I tried the Audi wheel on the rear of the Vanagon it fit but with the ET35
off-set the wheel was set &quot;way&quot; in. Also, with the ET35 off-set the hub extended
beyond the wheel so the center cap could not be used. No clearance problems here
just didn't look good and would probably result in some negative &quot;at speed&quot;
handling characteristics (tipsy/squirrelly?). When I tried the Audi wheel on the
front of the van it just wouldn't fit over the hub. :(

I had hopes on using the Audi's 15&quot; TYPE55 (better looking I think) on the
Vanagon and buying new 16&quot; wheels for the Audi. Won't happen :(

I think one could use any wheel with a 5X112 bolt pattern, 66.56 center bore,
and ET21-25 off-set. One very big consideration though, the relatively heavy
weight of the Vanagon/Westy. When I bought my TYPE21s for the van back in '92 it
was the only wheel that NTB(was NTW) and the Tire Rack would sell me for the
application. It was rated for the weight. Even still I have had 3 bent wheels
-this could be in part due to my use of relatively stiff sidewall, hi-
performance tires, Michelin XGT-V.

Currently, the only wheel rated for the van is the Borbet Replica II.
Ugly (MHO), but no uglier than my TYPE21s!

I would be interested in the experiences of the individual who is using the Audi
5000 Turbo wheels. I had an '86 5000 CS turbo.  These are ET35 off-set wheels.
Aside from machining the center bore, how did you get the center cap on the
wheel over the Van's extended hub? How does it handle? Does it track straight?
How is the &quot;on-center&quot; feel?
