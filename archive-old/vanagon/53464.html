Subject: FS: ski clips for Paulchen rack

I have a couple of extra pairs of ski clips for Paulchen racks that I'd
like to sell. These are brand new, made by Paulchen, and fit either the
older style or newer style racks. I just want to get what I paid for them,
which is about $45 including GST and customs duties (I bought them in
Canada). Email me directly if interested.
