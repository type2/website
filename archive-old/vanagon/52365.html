Subject: update on release of EV Bentley manual

&gt;From time to time I call Bentley to pester them on the release of the
EV manual.  The new anticipated release date is April, '97.  My guess is 
that the delay is mainly due to inclusion of the VR6 info, and they 
probably were waiting for a commitment from VW that the EV would be
released again in the US.  I'm afrainf to find out how much it's going to
cost.
