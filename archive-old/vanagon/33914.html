Subject: Cheap alarm system...

Hi Everyone.  I just bought a &quot;dummy&quot; alarm system for my 
mother-in-law's Golf, and thought I would report my findings.  I have 
full-blown alarm systems in our Golf Diesel and Syncro Westy, and 
don't think I would buy another alarm system for $1100 when I can buy 
this &quot;dummy&quot; system for $29.95 US.

I know there are merits and pitfalls for and against true alarms 
sytems, but that isn't the purpose of this report.  Just having a 
blinking LED is enough, IMHO, to keep intrusions at bay for most 
yahoos in my area.

This system has a switch blank with a red LED installed in it, wired 
to a flasher-diode thingy that is all sealed.  There are 3 wires 
needed to make it work... Ground, 12 volts switched, and 12 volts 
unswitched.  I used the headlight RED wire for the unswitched, and 
the rear defogger yellow/black wire for switched.  It blinks when the 
key is off, and stops blinking when it is on.  No false alarms.

I purchased this through mail order from :

Performance Engineering, 
P.O. Box 836,
Killingworth, CT  06419
USA
Ph. 203-526-4717

It took less than an hour to install, and comes complete with a 
switch blank.  I found this advertised in European Car magazine, and 
switch blanks with the RED LED's are made up for various VW products. 
If you don't want to use a switch blank, the LED can be mounted 
anytwher that you wish.

This is a basement operation, and the owner (Scott) verifies your 
order by phone.  He was very good, and willing to help.  I am very 
satisfied with the product.

Blinking away...
Harry.
