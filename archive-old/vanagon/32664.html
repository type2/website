&gt; Wow, Gary what did gas heaters ever do to you???!!! 


Sorry for creating the stir about the gas heaters.  I just was saying 
that from personal experience, I will never use one again.  I did have 
bad experiences with them not working at all.  I feel that there are 
other alternatives to a gas heater that I would try first.  I've seen 
makeshift heat exchangers in an early bug that seemed to work rather 
well.  I've also heard of (but never seen) a way to use the heat of the 
engine oil brought into the cabin and an electric fan to move the hot 
air.  Both of these methods sound more reliable to me than that nasty 
gas heater that stole so many hours from me and left me cold on many an 
occasion.
