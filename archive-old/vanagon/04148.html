      There's a great song!


&gt; Goin Mobile - The Who
      If we're talkin' The Who...  Magic Bus  has to be included


&gt; On the Road Again - Willie Nelson
&gt; Truckin' - Grateful Dead
&gt; Friend of the Devil - G.D.
&gt; Midnight Special - Creedence
&gt; 
&gt; Ric
&gt; 

Okay Martha,  You've stumped me.  I know all of Ric's here, and I've 
known all the others,  But  I've never heard of Hot Rod Lincoln!

How about Snoopy vs. the Red Baron?  The Royal Guardsmen!  We can all 
stick our arms out of the windows while we're driving and pretend we're 
flying Sopwith Camel Vanagons (With Doghouse Shrouds?)  We can imagine 
ourselves driving the bus in the B.F.Y. ads.
I know I do it when listening to that song, but maybe I'm strange.

Cheers
