So martha rubin says:
&gt; The fuel gauge in my '81 westy seems to work progressively and
&gt; correctly.  I nearly always fill up (and I use super) when it registers
&gt; 1/4 tank full, and at that point, my trip odometer usually registers
&gt; 175 miles.  This is with a fully loaded camper, just after an engine
&gt; rebuild, and in combination city and highway driving average.
&gt; 
&gt; 

All this tells you is that relative to the gauge needle movement you
go 175 miles between fill-ups.  It doesn't tell you the miles per gallon
(mpg) for your specific driving.  

Just in case you don't know (because I don't want to insult your intelligence), 
Mpg can be calculated by filling up your tank and noting the miles on the 
Odometer (or resetting your trip meter to zero).  Then at your next fill-up 
write down the number of gallons.  Note down the number of miles on your odomenter 
(or write down the number of miles from your trip meter).  Subtract the 
previous odometer reading from the new odometer reading to get the number 
of miles driven.  Then divide the number of gallons you filled the tank with 
into the number of miles driven.  This will give you the average mpg your car 
is getting.  Again, I apologize if you already know this.

If you get a relatively low mpg, say 16 - 17 mpg, this does not mean there
is anything wrong with the engine.  It could mean you do alot of stop and
go driving, spend alot of time with the engine idling, take short trips, 
gear down alot.  If you get high milage, I'd say you probably do mostly
freeway driving on flat surfaces.

Cheers!
