Subject: Re: Starting to worry

DS&gt; A few days ago I put in a new starter for my 65 bus and it started
DS&gt; just great. Then yesterday I tried to start my bus and nothing
DS&gt; happens. The battery checked out fine.
DS&gt;
DS&gt; So, I pulled out the starter once more. Nothing unusual, so I
DS&gt; reinstall it, turn the key, and the bus starts. A few days latter
DS&gt; the bus won't start again.
DS&gt;
DS&gt; I take the starter out one more time and I notice little metal
DS&gt; flakes or shavings around the bushing(was probably there the
DS&gt; previous time I took it out but didn't notice it). The bushing is
DS&gt; in good shape. I reinstalled the starter again and the bus starts
DS&gt; right up.
DS&gt;
DS&gt; Anybody have a similar problem or a clue to what might be
DS&gt; happening? I have a 6 volt starter going into a 12 volt housing.

        Is it happening more when things are hot? If so, it's probably high
resistance in your factory wiring-it's only 30 yrs. old, after all. The
gospel of St. Muir describes a solenoid bypass using a simple Ford
solenoid, it's under &quot;Changes &amp; New Ideas&quot;. If you have not Muir, write me
back and I'll try to describe the procedure.
