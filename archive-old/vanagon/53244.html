Mark -

The repair was very easy.  There is a metal post that attaches to the chair
with two bolts.  If there is no post you need to get one through VW or a
junkyard.  If the post is there you just slide the arm rest on and secure with
bolt.  I can look-up the bolt number if you don't have it.

10 minutes plus a trip to the hardware store.

&gt; Well, my right rest gave-out.  I pulled the arm off and sure enough the bolt
&gt; on the bottom had broken off.  I thought I was going to have to drill it out
&gt; until I noticed that it was not a blind hole.  I pulled back the material
and
&gt; just used a pair of pliers to unscrew the rest of the bolt out the back.
&gt; 
&gt; I could not find a bolt the right length so got one (metric) a little longer
&gt; and am happy to report that my right arm is resting fine.

I just purchased an 87GL 6 weeks ago and the right armrest on the pass 
side was laying off the seat. I haven't a clue as to what it needs as I 
haven't had the time to truly investigate a repair. Was your repair 
rather easy or involved?
