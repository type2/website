Ric,

I think you're being a tad harsh.  VW isn't selling the specified book, nor
do they have plans to sell it.  Folks would gladly pay them the money, and
I didn't see anyone say that VW didn't need the money.  (I personally think
they need money so that they can import TDI Eurovan Westies, but hey...)

I'm not saying whether copying this material is right or wrong, I'm just
saying that noone was saying that general copying of material is alright.
Your comparison with a car thief was somewhat off-base.

Respectfully (even though you're a lawyer),
Coyote
