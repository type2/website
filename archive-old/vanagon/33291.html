Subject: I need diesel help.

I'm going to pick up our Vanagon diesel tomorrow.  I have purchased it with
a bad clutch, and I want to do that as soon as I get it home.  Question:
Does it use the same pressure plate as a Rabbit?  My Parts Place catalog
says all gas and diesel Rabbits are the same, and that the bus had the same
clutch from '76 to '80something.  When I called them, I was told that it was
the same pressure plate as the Rabbit, but the same disk as the Bus (which
kind of makes too much sense to be true).  Any thoughts from the gallery?
The same catalog shows the same part number as a Rabbit pressure plate with
a different letter sequence at the end, and a unique disk number.  Of course
it costs more than twice as much...

Also, for anyone who has an appropriate Bently manual:  I am picturing
myself pulling the motor like I do with a bus (except without all that
*&amp;^%!!?! cooling tin).  However, I'm pretty sure that with a Rabbit you
support the engine and pull the tranny out like an Amerkun car (except
sideways of course).  Is there anything going to keep me from pulling it out
the old fashioned way?

Also, I'd like to quiz fellow diesel owners on their personal cold start and
driving habits.  The '86 Golf I just got is not very fond of starting in
near freezing weather we've been having of late.  I wait for the glowplug
light to go out, I use the cold start lever (which is in fact hooked to the
injector pump).  Excluding this morning (with 4&quot; of wet snow all over) the
routine has been like this:  It catches instantly, running on probably 1-1/2
cylinders.  If I gently bring the revs up to around 1100
 for a few seconds and the drop back down I'm up to 3 cylinders and I can
actually make out instruments on the dash ;) .  After about 20 seconds total
time it's clattering away on all fours.  I'm letting it idle for a minimum
of two minutes before driving gently, and in the real cold weather I'm
starting it about 15 minutes before I plan on driving.  When it's warm it
runs great, with very little diesel clatter.  I could easily drive someone
around in it without them having any clue we're running on stove oil.

This morning was different.  It actually took three tries of twisting old
Bossy's tail before she finally shook to life.  I went with the long idle
ritual and everything was fine.  I haven't decided if the cold start lever
is making it start faster or not.  I have noticed that it runs better if I
push it in almost right away.


I'd like to hear how some of the rest of you get your diesels to life in the
morning.


I know I should get a block heater, but it rarely gets very cold here.  It's
going to be a hassle rigging it up, as I park in the street out in front of
my house, and there's a public sidewalk between.  As an added bonus, when I
bring home the Vanagon tomorrow I'll need two cords.  Anybody have any clue
as to the current flow on a block heater?
