Subject: Re:  getting the drums off.

If you have the puller by all means go to it - I turned a cheap one
into scrap on my 71 bus years ago - when it let go one of the arms broke
into a piece which whizzed by my head - a lot of tension in them there
little metal molecules ......

since this incident i use a hammer instead (havent done this in years 
because i learned to put the thinnest film of molly grease on all
the surfaces (NOT the braking surface dodoes) so my drums dont stick no more
- so there!!
