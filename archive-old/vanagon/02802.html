&gt; i am new to the air cooled world (have a 82 scirocco, it has been a 
&gt; very mixed reltationship) i plan on buying a bus.  so the other day 
&gt; i drove a 79 at it drove great, had plenty of power.  my only 
&gt; concerns were two: one that there was a smell, the engine, when the 
&gt; heater was turned on, two there was a slight ( a few drops) amount 
&gt; of oil leaking from were i presume the two heads are.  how serious 
&gt; are these two things?

So far as I can tell, no one has mention the possibility that the
smell you're getting from your heater (heat exchangers) may be
exhaust fumes.  This is quite dangerous and should be checked out.
The smell could be just the normal stale aroma of the metal or it
could be oil, but you need to be sure.  I know what hot oil smells
like and also the normal stale smell, but I'm not sure how to describe
the exhaust smell.  Can anyone help on this?  I don't want our new
air-head to go to the hospital and tell everyone there that it was
an air-cooled VWs fault.  ;)
