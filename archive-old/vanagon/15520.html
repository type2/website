Subject: bunk types

I recently saw some discussion about drying out your pop top canvas  
after camping in the rain, and someone mentioned removing the bunk  
cushions to help the air flow.  The only upper bed type I have come  
across was a folding canvas cot. Is there another style I haven't  
seen yet ? 


Thanks,
