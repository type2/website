Subject: Exhaust System- EGR filter on 82 Westy

I was hoping someone could help out . The EGR filter on the exhaust system 
of my 82 Westy is rusted away. A friend of mine said I could just remove it 
because it wasn't really necessary to have on. So, can anyone tell me if my 
friend is correct or do I have to keep adding more layers of muffeler tape 
on the damn thing! I'm sure not going to spend $220 for a new one.(i hope) 
If I can rip the thing off what should I plug the pipes with? Any advice 
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Tim
