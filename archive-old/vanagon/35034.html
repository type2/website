Steve Johnson and I went to look at the '65 single cab today.  He's
still ambivalent on whether or not to but it.  We need to talk him into
it.  He's worried about if he should spend the money - pshaw!

The only rust we found on the pickup was a hole in the cargo bed and
some surface rust on the front floor.  It has an almost perfect floor
mat and vinyl covers in the front, perfect glass, a couple of extra
items added to the dash and needs a new driver's door, which comes with
the bus.

I got a set of 36 hp heat exchangers for $10 each, in really, really good
shape.  I also found a box full of 36hp stuff that I'm gonna go back and
pick up on payday - 2 _new_ heads, fuel pumps, carbs, tin, pushrods and
pushrod tubes, rods, and miscellaneous stuff.  He has not one but 2 of
the oil filler jobbers that slip into the case (not screw in) but which
have caps on them.  Didn't look like he had any of the spring ones without
the cap. 

I could probably build an entire 36hp motor, complete, if I had a spare
case and a muffler.  He has all the rods, bearings, cams, cranx, you name
it.  I'm going back on payday, with an empty bus!
