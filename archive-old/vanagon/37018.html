Subject: solenoid trouble?

Hey all,
While we're on the subject of non-starting, let me relate my problem.  

Here's what happened:  I had been driving for about three hours or so at around
55-65 mph.  I stopped to get gas and when I came back to the car to start it up,
I turned the key and nothing -- just a little dimming of the dash lights.  Get
under car and smack solenoid with a big wrench -- starts right up like a champ.
While looking at solenoid, I noticed that it was kinda rusty looking.  It
repeated the problem when I got home finally after another three hours of
constant highway driving.

This problem does not occur when it's cold.

Anyway, pulled the battery out and found that one cell was completely dry and
some others were down so I filled them up and put a charge in that sucker.  

I plan to clean off the connections and possibly remove the solenoid and clean
it up. 

What I wanna know is if my battery's low state of charge could have had a major
part in this problem.  I'd hate to have to rebuild the solenoid if it's OK.  If
I do have to take out the solenoid, can I have it rebuilt by itself or is some
guy gonna try to sell me the starter/solenoid set?  Can I take apart the
solenoid and grease it/clean it up?  

Anyway, thanks for any help and hopefully I can cure this problem with a minimum
of swearing and busted knuckles.

Thanks,
Sean
