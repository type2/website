&gt; &gt; vehicle?

Harry responds:
&gt; 
&gt; I think CSA might have something to do with it.  All Canadian RV's 
&gt; have built in powercords.  Actually, I thought that all RV's did, but 
&gt; maybe I'm wrong.
&gt; 

My 2 cents:

I recently reread the manual for my 81 camper, and noticed that a number of 
things  are different about the Canuck model.  

1) The stove's heat shield cannot be lowered for use as a drainboard.  This has 
got to be a safety &quot;feature&quot; to prevent people from using the drain board as a 
radiator or cooking surface or who knows what else.

2) The electrical outlet has a built-in retractable power cord.  Presumably, 
this is to reduce the number of electrical connections exposed to the elements, 
but I'm guessing here.

3) The auxiliary heater unit is standard.  I assume this relates to the frigid 
temps back home in the Great White North.

4) There may have been other oddities, but I can't recall for sure.  Possibly 
the KPH/MPH is reversed on the speedo (miles smaller print/kilometers bigger 
print).  Manuals may also be written in English and French, but I'm not sure 
about internal van markings/labels etc.
