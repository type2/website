Subject: NC/RTP THURSDAY list member gathering


Just thought I'd remind everybody in the area to join us tomorrow (Thursday,
May 8) for our VW dinner gathering and special 5/8/77 20th anniversary party
(sorry, obscure Dead reference) See our new pop-top conversions, and compare
the split/late model top differences...
This is the info from Stefan:

Hi Everybody in the RTP area in NC,
Richard Palmer and I decided that another get together of all the list
members in this area is more then overdue. Spring is comming up, you can
work outside on your bus again, so getting some new ideas for add-on's or
modifications to our busses by checking out the ones from fellow list
members seems to be the right thing to do.....
Weaver Street Market (community owned coop) in Carrboro has every Thursday
(at 6pm) a wine and beer tasting event with live music in front of the
store on their lawn.
Richard and I will be there this Thursday, May 8th. So whoever is within
driving distance is more then welcome to join us to have some microbrew
and organically grown food.
The meeting place will be the big parking lot next door in front of Harris
Teeter. We will be there around 5:30pm with our busses.

How do you get there?
Take exit 273B from I40 onto Hwy 54 West
Stay on 54 until you go underneath a bridge
Right behind the bridge take the exit onto 15/501 bypass South
15/501 turns into 54bypass
Take the South Greensborough St exit towards Carrboro
Cross Main Street in Carrboro
Harris Teeter and Weaver Street Market are at the shopping center at the
corner of Greensborough St and Weaver Street.
Get on the parking lot of Harris Teeter by turning right after the
Greensborough and Weaver Street corner.

See you there this Thursday
