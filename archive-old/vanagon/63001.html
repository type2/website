Subject:      tents (mostly) and EVs and PNW trips

sounds like the sudden lack of vehicle tents may be an opportunity for
someone handy with canvas and a sewing machine. which is not me a must
admit.
(speaking of which i just found this cool book on how to build tipi's and
yurt's - plans, material lists, patterns.for when you get to a spot you
want to stay a little while. someone near here has a yurt in their backyard
- uses it for a wood shop.

The Winnebago people sell something for the EV called an &quot;Add A Room&quot; which
might be what some of you are looking for. Not sure though - i've only seen
a tiny picture in a catalog.

keep sending in that EV data.

Anyone going anyplace interesting this weekend? I'm thinking maybe the
coast. Or maybe St Helens - just looking for a short jaunt.
