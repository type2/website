In a message dated 96-01-12 00:45:50 EST, you write:

&gt;Weston wrote something about the silver socket, which I wont repeat
&gt;because he can't seem to turn the caps lock OFF.
&gt;
&gt;It is a secret!!! ;-). Only those who do not keep their caps lock OFF at
&gt;all times while writing messages on the 'net are not allowed to know
&gt;about it.  Seriously though, it is considered yelling if you type in
&gt;caps.
&gt;

Geez, so much for ASSERTIVENESS training.........
