Subject: Re: Hoo boy. The list doth split...

I sure hope there are aircooled 82s in the US, otherwise we 
Australians with aircooled 82 Vanagons are going to get lumped with 
the non-wavers.

I must say I am happy that the list is splitting - although I know I 
will miss some interesting postings.
