Volks: With the first leaves only a week or so away here in the north
country, it's time to get our '84 Westy ready to go. Three questions after
pulling it out of storage:

1. Any suggestions on which cement/bonding agent to use to reattach the
rubber gasket back to the bottom edge of the pop top where it has begun to
work loose? Also, to reattach the thin, black plastic guard to the top rain
gutters where it has come loose?

2. One of the three flaps for electric/water supplies won't latch anymore
and is swinging freely as we drive down the highway. Before it snaps off in
the wind, I'm thinking about using a couple of magnets to hold it in place.
Has anybody tried this/or something better?

3. The circular plastic cover on the outside vent finally cracked and went
to pieces. Has anyone stumbled across a piece of Tupperware or similar that
might fit? If not, is there an address where I can send for a replacement?

Thanks,
Bruce
