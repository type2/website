Subject: Commercial Lurkers

OK folks, just a question that came up a little while ago.  Can you add to
the list below to fill it out?  Some people might recognise a local name or
sig for it's commercial VW nature.  We have wannabusers, sniveling lurkers,
lets see the commercial 'lurkers' or otherwise dealer types.


&lt;snip&gt;
just wondered, how many dealers do we now have on the list?
letsee, there's:

Ron Salmon( Philly/Allentown Pa area)
Kyle Wade (NorCal)
Jimbo at Bus Boys (So Cal )
Parts Place (Michigan area)
Bus Bones ? (Florida area)
IndianVic (Madras Motors)  (SoCal Orange County area)


bye, Tim
