Subject: solar.shower.test.results!


I was not pleased with the results of my own self-made solar shower
in the black Rubbermaid tub, so I purchased a commercial solar shower
for about $15 (5 gallon) made by a company in San Rafael, CA
called Basic Design.  Sorry, that's Santa Rosa, not Rafael.  Anyway
true to their claims, on a 70+F clear day, this thing heats up
well over 110F in three hours!  I was so inspired, that I called
them up and ordered their 10 gallon model.  With the two by side,
slightly underfilled, at 14 gallons total, that would bring me
just about up to the 110 pound weight allotment for the luggage
rack of my '81 westy.  

Next, I'll be experimenting with trying to keep the water hot
once the sun goes down.  Will probably try an ice chest painted
flat black on the inside to pre warm it in the sun, then store it
and test temperature in the evening, nite, and morning, to see
how much heat can be successfully stored this way.

BTW, this company also makes a power shower unti for about $30
I think, which allows you to pump your shower if you have no 
place above you to park the water.  It works off the DC/cig. liter
outlet, and will pump up to a height of 8 feet, they claim.

Forgot to mention that the shower head on the end of my 5
gallon unit (and I assume  all their units) has an on/off
push/pull action, so that the flow is controlled at the 
end point of the shower.  Don't know if that is also
the case with the power shower pump.

This all bears futher investigation for what would happen
on days where the temperature is under 70F, or overcast.  I
would guess, however, that it would at least help heat it,
and that it could all be emptied into a tub, more hoit 
water heated (by first being boiled on the propane stove),
and brought up to comfortable shower temperature.  Then,
the tub could be used with the power shower pump.  The company
even manufactures a shower &quot;enclosure&quot; which sort of folds down
into something more manageable size.  Or, I plan to experiment
with lifting the rear hatch of the westy, and like Joel
saw in a picture and told me about, hanging a shower curtain
back there....
