Subject: diesel transmission question

My transmission has begun to speak to me.  Its not extremely loud, my 
dads truck is louder all the time, however I have never heard it before.  
So im taking it to a shop on Mon for that and other problems (cooling, 
small oil leak :(). But in the meantime, I wanted to check the fluid level.
Bentley doesn't say how and my clymer manual asks me to refer to the AC 
info.  Now I'm no mechanic, but I can'r seem to find the check level/fill 
hole.  It states that it is on the right hand side of the transmission 
above the shifter mechanism.  Am I missing it or is it somewhere else?  
Also what is the best way to fill it if I ever do find the plug?
Thanks
Paul 82 Diesel Westy
