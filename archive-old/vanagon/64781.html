Subject:      Shopping for a &quot;real&quot; car &lt;F&gt;

After borrowing my Mother's Buick for a week and riding to the Pomona swaps
in a friends Mom's Lincoln land-yacht, VanBondo thought that maybe he'd be
interested in selling off the 45,000 mile 2.0L '83 Westy and getting a
&quot;real&quot; car...

Requirements:
A/C, Motor with poop enough to negotiate the freeway on ramps ;-), less road
noise, and to be sized smaller than a small apartment complex.

Results_at_First Glance:
Including all media of sales info- Sticker shock deluxe, observation of tons
of 1985 Toyotas with 165k miles for $5-7.5k, obnoxious sales persons, and
more sticker shock. Even the flipping Jettas were at or near 15-20k! USED~!
Sport utility? Pfft? Even on the low end they are totally beyond our
budget... British green Range Rover with corner windows, roof rack, and a
bank of Hella 2000's? Yeah-right!~next lifetime. &lt;Oh, Buffy please pass the
quiche&gt;

Analysis:
It's fun jerking around the sales guys...
I'm sorry but I'm &quot;out&quot; on that action for the time being. Now I know why
I've been fooling with the &lt;aircooled&gt; VW's for so long. Time to wash and
wax the Vangon Westy and continue being a happy guy. I did see a nice
original 6V, 36HP '57 Oval for sale. Hmmmm... ;-) (Oh, heck-I'm addicted)
