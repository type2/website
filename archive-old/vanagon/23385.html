&gt; It may seem trite and unimportant, but believe me it's ANNOYING,

&gt; rattling noise coming from the shift lever in my '91 Westy (w/ manual 
&gt; transmission), when I'm driving in 3rd gear.  Sort of a tinny buzz.  It's 
&gt; also starting to do it on occasion in 4th.  Putting a little pressure up 
&gt; or down on the shift lever makes it go away (but can't drive continuously 
&gt; like that, of course).  Personally, it sounds to me like a loose pin or 
&gt; other small part in the linkage, vibrating in sync with the engine.

Wes,
  Just wanted to let you know that YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  (We could start
BSLA Buzzing Shift Levers Anon.)  I have EXACTLY the same problem.  Its
annoying, but not annoying enough for me to start digging around under the
bus.  If you figure it out, please let me know.

Buzz on,

Albrecht (82 Vanagon L)
