&gt;Here my question: can anybody tell me what the normal and the maximum
&gt;reading should be (the gauge is in Fahrenheit - unfortunately!).

some of the other folks actually have those, so they can tell you from
experience, but i think the temps that have been bandied about were 'normal'
in the range of 350-400 F. the cylinder head gets a lot hotter than the oil.

&gt;Another question: I tried to unscrew the transmission fluid inspection
&gt;and refill plug - with my limited equipment without any success. Does
&gt;anybody have another idea besides the garage around the corner...

yup. really neat cheap trick. go to the local parts place, get a bolt with
a 17mm head on it, and about three nuts to fit on it. put the bolt head in
the refill plug hole and turn the nuts (but not the last one on the bolt ...
otherwise you just unscrew that one nut).  you'll likely have to use a box-
end wrench, or maybe a socket wrench.
