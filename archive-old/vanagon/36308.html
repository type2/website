     I have a similar problem for my 82. I believe it's &quot;bamboo Yellow&quot; and 
     I've found nothing that matches at any flaps.  I have found a local 
     company that will match the color (13.00 a pint i think) and put it 
     into cans for $5.00 each.  Pricy but better than having it totally 
     repainted. and they say i can get many cans from it.
     
     Is there any one who would like some of this if I get it made up?

I have seen a list of available colors for each year, somewhere, does 
anyone know where it is? My Westy was built  10/80 ('81 model?)
 and according to PPG it shouild be Carmel, for the model year 80 the color was 
Assuan Brown. Are the body colors by model year, or could I have the 
Assuan Brown since mine was manufactured in '80? Also PPG may have 
the colors wrong!
I'm trying to get some touch up paint. 
Thanks
