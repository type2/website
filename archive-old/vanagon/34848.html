&gt; 88 Westie Front End Noise?
&gt; I've had a rumbling/clunking type noise in the front end of my 88 Westie for a
&gt; while now.  I thought the front shocks were shot and finally got around to
&gt; replacing them.  Unfortunately the noise has gotten worse with the new shocks,
&gt; not better.  Now the sound is more of a 'klunk'.
&gt; 
&gt; The sound I hear/feel is at speeds under 20mph on fairly bumpy surfaces.  I can
&gt; feel/hear a hollow clunk or two or three or four depending on the frequency of
&gt; the bumps in the road.  The sound is particularly pronounced on the passenger
&gt; side but I do hear/feel it on the drivers side intermittently.

Upper A-arm bushing(s)?

&gt; 
&gt; To troubleshoot I removed the shock on the passenger side.  The noise was
&gt; reduced and/or eliminated.  Next I'll swap the shocks from side to side to see
&gt; if the noise follows.  These are KYB gas shocks and appear fine to visual
&gt; inspection.

I didn't know that KYB made gas shocks for the front of Vanagons, book 
lists GR-2. Or are GR-2 shocks gas filled but not Gas-Adjust?
