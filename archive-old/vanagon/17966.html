Volks,

Hi.

Here I am again with my engine.  Things sure do have of way of looking
different than they are.  Allow me to recap the lastest developments.

After towing the bus home from the Pacific Coast highway I thought I had
finally found the problem which was bad spark plugs.  Well, well, guess it's
not so simple.  I got the bus running again on it's stock 34 pict-3 intake
system, and new champion spark plugs.  I put this system in place for a few
reasons.

To make sure I had the parts around so if I wanted to take a spare fuel
system on the road I could do it.

        The change from dual manifold to single is entirely to complicated
for the road, removing the alternator etc., it would be much easier to have
a spare set of dual carbs.  Yikes, I just sold them all, oops.

To see if the power brake booster responded differently to the single throat
carb.

        The brake booster worked a little better, but still looses boost at
stop signs.  I think I have a problem with the booster.

To see how the engine responded to the stock carb so if/when I get it
smogged I can tune it.

        The engine was not really happy about the 34 pict-3.  It idled like
a race car, rough and unsteady, very difficult to get it to settle down,
even goofing with the mixture, idle and timing.  Timing, by the way, seems
to run the engine best at better than 15 degrees, BTDC.  I am leaving it at
15, though on my friday get away on the highway, I had tuned it by feel and
it turned out to be almost 20.  I did not try the stock distributor set at 5
ATDC like it would be if it were to be smogged.  I guess I should have.  

So I drove the car around for a day and decided that the EFI system should
go back in since it worked and I paid for it and the carb ain't that great.
It drove well, but ran into the third and fourth green light at running
speed, meaning too rich, and dove off the end on the lean scale at the
beginning of the shifts with light throttle.  I didn't feel like trying to
clean up the mix on the 34.

So back go the EFI throttle bodies, fuel rails etc.  I dropped the fuel
pressure to 30 psi from 38 to try and get the mixture down from the third
green light, where it had been previously.  I bought new injector seals from
Porsche because the last couple times I had switched the injectors around
they leaked.  When I tested the injectors in the fuel rails with the new
seals one still leaked so I used a touch of 3H on the seals and they sealed
up great.

Installed a low pressure fuel filter on the return line to the pump.  Did
not bother with a high pressure filter yet, since this is clearly not the
problem, though I should eventually.  I'll pick up a 1990 Corrado filter as
per Mr. Andersons suggestion.

I changed the 10W Non-Detergent break-in oil to 20 W ND and also changed the
amazingly gunky and metal chippy Oberg screen for the extra-fine clean one.
I though I had been pretty careful keeping metal chips out of the engine,
but either I wasn't that successful, or the amount of wearing in of the cam
gear and other parts is more than I ever realized.  In any case it sure
feels better to have that stuff out of the engine.  I also removed the sump
plate and wiped off the magnet clamped to the pick-up tube, as well as the
plate itself.  I used Ultra-blue RTV when I put it back on.  When I first
put the 10W in on the stand I thought I noticed a distinct increase in oil
leaks, but didn't really believe it and thought I was just going to be stuck
with a leaky engine, fooey.  Well, now that the 20W is in and I've driven it
for a couple days, there is a noticeable improvement in oil leakage, from
drips all across the bottom of the sump, to a couple drops over several
hours after parking the car hot.  BTW I let the RTV dry overnight before I
refilled the engine.

The external oil cooler went back on, something I was trying to avoid, but
decided it is better to be on the safe side with this big an engine,
especially given the rough break-in I'm giving it, and how hard I plan to
drive it.  At least it's one with screw in fittings and steel braided hoses,
so it can't fail, and it doesn't leak.

I've also fussed about with other projects on the car while I let the RTV
dry and felt foolish about my exotic project.

I replaced the particle board battery tray with 5/8&quot; plywood, cut it to fit
the entire area, bolted it down good, and screwed a plastic battery tray
securely to it.  I also bolted a plastic battery tray to the left side
compartment and put my second battery there.  No longer will my battery be
bouncing around off the tail lights, ready to fall through to the road at
any moment.  I bolted a battery isolater to the side wall and ran killer #4
wire from the alternator to the iso and from the iso to the two batteries.
wOw.  I attached my spare #12 wire to the front of the car to the second
battery and will put a terminal block up front and attach interior lights,
cig lighter/inverter, etc. to this circuit.

I, I, I, I installed dual filament tail lights half way up the back of the
car (just above the roundish hump, right next to the rear door) on both
sides for running, turn signal/brake lights and connected them to the
existing lights.  A major improvement that looks great at night and really
catches the eye, like brake lights should.  They stick out a little and will
eventually get trashed, but at $6 each I can handle it.

SOOOOO, the injection system is still running rich, seems to be drinking way
too much fuel, and won't idle well, but drives great.  I called Berg and
asked about several things;  How long does EFI computer hold it's memory
without a battery?  &quot;Several months at least with it's bubble memory.&quot;  Why
can't I get it to idle below the third green light?  &quot;What injectors are you
using?&quot;  The 201's.  &quot;Those are for a 300 HP engine.&quot;  Oh, they're the only
ones I saw in the catalog that fit the TWM body.  &quot;No, there are thousands.&quot;
Oh, maybe that's why the spark plugs failed, way to much juice, plugs get
contaminated, tow bus home.  

I guess I ended up ordering my engine pretty piecemeal from GBE and they
didn't have a chance to look at the order as a whole to tell me what
injectors I should really have gotten.  Plus I got the injectors on my own.
I would have thought they could have caught this detail, given the size of
my overall order from them, but I don't run a major business with hundreds
of customers so maybe not.  In any case I am now headed out for the ....235
injectors off circa '84-'88 Buick Century 3.8 liter engines and similar.  Up
to 130 HP.  Let you know what happens.  My apologies to Bosch, though I
still think a plug should be able to handle a little over-rich mix for a
while and not fail.

Eug,
