Subject: Rear wheel bearings '71
Date: Wed, 3 Jul 1996 09:44:17 -0500 (CDT)

Hey all.  I recently ordered some rear wheel bearings for my '71 bus. 
Two matching pairs.  However, one is a rollor bearing and one is a 
ball bearing.  That is, the inner is a ball and outer is a roller, or 
the other way around.  Now, I think I remember reading somewhere here 
in the last week or so not to mix the two types of bearings.  Is this 
true?  Thanks, Jim
