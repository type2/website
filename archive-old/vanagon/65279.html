&gt; feeding unfiltered air to the intake manifold at all times.  Attempts to
&gt; &quot;adjust&quot; the egr throttle attachment haven't made any difference re: the
&gt; always available suction I feel from the end of the open pipe, at idle, and
&gt; increasing with throttle opening.
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise, the engine seems to be running well, plugs look very good when I
&gt; pull them after 10K or so for inspection, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1) should I just leave the set up as it is for now, with the egr intake
&gt; open?(it has been running this way for at least 30K, with no apparent ill
&gt; effects.

I'd say NO.  At the very least you're getting an unfiltered air leak.

&gt; 2) should I just block it off?

I'd say AT A MINIMUM do that.

&gt; 3) if (2) what effects will it have (if any?)

If you feel suction at all times at the open end, yet the car seems to
run OK (i.e., not too lean) then I would think that closing up the intake
might expose a too-rich condition, since you'll be closing off a source
of unmetered air.
