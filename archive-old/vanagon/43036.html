Subject: 71 Part number help..

Hi there,
Well I was a lurker but now I'm not I guess. I have a question if 
anyone could help me. What is the part number for the break backing 
plates (rear) for a 71 Westy? What year busses will the part fit 
from?
I'm in Israel and I am going back to my bus (in Connecticut) in  a 
few weeks and I thought I might look for the backing plates over here 
(actually it wasn't my idea, thanks Joel)..
So if anyone can help me out.

Jay Sullivan
