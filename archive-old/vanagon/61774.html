Subject: Re.EV to Vanagon Wheel Swap

Hi all,

The EV (T4) wheel stud pattern is the same as the Vanagon however I
believe that a small amount of machining of the wheel centres is
required to make them fit on a Vanagon.
The offset of the EV wheels would need to be compared to that of a
Vanagon just to be sure.
