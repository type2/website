Subject: Fuel tanks

We pulled the '82 tank yesterday and it's got a lot of crud in it and what
looks like some tarry substance on the bottom.  It also has chunks of what
looks like rust, and I can't figure out where those might be coming from. 
It's very hard to see in the tank.  

The '84 tank, however is much cleaner to appearances.  I'm seriously
considering using it even though it cost me $37 to get the diesel tank working
in the first place.  :-(   On the other hand, the '84 filler tube is plastic
with metal top, and that metal top is pretty rusted. I'll bet that plastic
filler tube costs a bit.

Of course, now I have all this gas to deal with.  I wish I had somewhere to
dump it.
