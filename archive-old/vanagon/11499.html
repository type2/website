Subject: Re: Chevron Techron Fuel Injection Cleaner


&gt; now, i can't prove any of this. but i do know and can prove the following:
&gt; * the techron bottle label says NO MORE than two bottles of the stuff into
&gt;   your gas tank without changing the engine oil.
&gt;   (so THEY think it is getting into the oil).
&gt; * idling your car WILL put higher amounts of unburned gasoline into your
&gt;   engine oil (i've had my engine oil analyzed several times, and the one
&gt;   time i 'warmed up' the oil by letting the car idle for 30 minutes, the
&gt;   percentage fuel dilution (unburned gas in the oil) was like four times
&gt;   higher than the other times (when i had driven 20 miles to heat up the 
&gt; oil).
&gt; 
&gt; so my rule of thumb is: anytime you add something to your gas, plan on doing
&gt; an oil change before you add it again.

Berry, berry interesting. Someone who actually had their oil analyzed...I like 
it! BTW, who did it for you, and (if you don't mind my prying) what did they 
charge you? What kind of feedback (data) did they provide?

I could see this as being useful for all kinds of nerdy little automotive 
experiments...
