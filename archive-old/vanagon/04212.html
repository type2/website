&gt; message that has a subject &quot;1970s heater boxes&quot; tells water cooled vans not
&gt; to bother reading this unless they want to. This is a much better subject

Hehe... an AOL person telling people how to properly behave. :)
Sorry for that comment... but it seems rather abnormal.  But I 
definately agree.  Also, I like to make a couple (hopefully) simple 
requests.  
1.  That people actually try to edit the quotes.
2.  Don't cross-post every message to VintageVW.
I store all the mailing lists in my account, and I also have an FTP 
directory.  So I'm always close to my quota.  I'm sure other people 
have quotas also, but I'm only speaking for myself.  So I just ask that 
people try not flood the list with excess qoutes and and messages duped 
to VintageVW.
