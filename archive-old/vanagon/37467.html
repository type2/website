Subject: USED doghouse cooler-yes or no?

Hey now,
        The local VW place tells me I can convert to a doghouse for $60
complete. However, this is all used parts, *including* the cooler. New
coolers run $90 from these guys, will call around for other quotes. The big
question: What's the concensus on a used oil cooler? My gut reaction is
hell no, but I'm not sure whether a used doghouse is better than sticking
with the older style. Any sugestions? Thanks in advance.

Peace,
