Subject: Re: 1987 Camper Center Swivel Seat

&gt;Camperites,
&gt;
&gt;I've looked at the 1987 Camper Supplement to the Vanagon Owner's Manual and
&gt;found a Center Swivel Seat pictured and described as optional.  Do any of you
&gt;Camper owners have this option on a USA Vanagon.  It mounts in the center
&gt;area of the van, seats 1 passenger, has two armrests and a lockable
&gt;compartment in the base.  I have personally never seen one of these and am
&gt;trying to determine if they exist on Vanagons made for the USA.  I think that
&gt;if it was available, it would just be on GL model Campers.

When I was with my parents looking at a Westfalia I saw another Westfalia
next to  it with this center seat.  It was in a brown '85 GL Westfalia.  It
was the only one I had ever seen.  It was neat!  It wasn't as tall as the
front seats; I don't think it had a headrest or someting.  It was placed
right by the sliding door in between the passenger seat and the rear seat.
We didn't drive this one because it had 130k miles and was a 4spd (Mom won't
drive a stick :(.  I wish I had one of these seats in my Bus!
