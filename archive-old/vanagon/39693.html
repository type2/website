&gt; &gt;When replacing a pilot bearing, are there any special tricks or conditions
&gt; &gt;one should be aware of? My old one's probably in little pieces by now, but
&gt; &gt;assuming that the crank and trans input shaft are OK, how exactly does
&gt; &gt;one install the new one? I would assume:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Make sure the felt washer/seal between the flywheel and crankshaft is still
&gt; there. Replace if needed.  Still available at dealer.  Some repalcement
&gt; bearings also have lip seal built in.  use this if possible.  Grease does not
&gt; matter once the clutch dust gets in.  Felt does better job of excluding the
&gt; dust.  two seals better than one.  If trans input shaft is damaged at all, it
&gt; must be replaced.  Cost about $65 at dealer.  Relatively easy to change.

Mine was about $75.  BTW, I'm wondering just how critical it is to 
replace the felt.  The mechanics I talked to questioned the need to 
replace it.  The pilot brg itself is actually the same as a TI's and the 
TI gland nut that the brg resides in does not have a felt washer.  Just 
curious.
