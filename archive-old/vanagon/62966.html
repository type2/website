Date: Thu, 17 Jul 1997 15:13:31 -0500 (EDT)

&gt; the DPO of my van was SO LAZY that when this happened, (BTW, a 2 minute
&gt; repair) they went out and bought a cheapo &quot;stick on&quot; digital clock from
&gt; K-mart and stuck it over the digital clock which had been cycling
&gt; constantly......
&gt; 
&gt; well....same DPO took the easy way out and just bypssed the rear htr core
&gt; when it starting leaking also...., so I'm not suprised...  :&lt;(  ( all it was
&gt; was the little white plastic relief valve...another 2 minit fix....)
&gt; 

The DPO of my Bus was so lazy:
- when the speedometer was no longer lit up at night, he had a
flashlight in the door's map holder to shine on the speedometer. He
proudly showed it to me, and threw it in with the purchase (&quot;You'll be
needing this!&quot;). (two minute fix... lift cover, put bulb holder back into clip)
- when the license plate lights went out, he cut the wires to them and
ran a wire from the tail light to a bumper mounted after-market
(cheap) marker light (two minute fix, clean corrosion from the bulb ends)
- when the catch for the driver's door broke, so that the door swung
out freely, he attached a bungie cord from the door handle to a vent
under the dash. Also thrown in with purchase. (catch is $32 from VW, 
installation takes 10 minutes)
