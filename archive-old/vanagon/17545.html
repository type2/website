Eric,

You should be honored! Its probably the first intellegent, non-big
breasted blonde bikini bug/bus bimbo article that has EVER been
published in T&amp;A, and probably one of the only times that
an article/editorial has not contained &quot;bitchin'&quot;, &quot;sano&quot;,
&quot;resto&quot;, etc....
