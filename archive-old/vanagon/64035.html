Subject: EV Air Conditioner

Well, the air conditioner in my '93 EV died just as we left on our 
vacation last week, and of course the temperature hit record highs. 
Anyway, we had the thing checked and no refrigerant leak. The tech 
said there is a problem with the condensor fan or control.  So 
basically my question is this: where is the A/C control relay 
mounted?  It should be straightforward to check it and the fan. TIA.
