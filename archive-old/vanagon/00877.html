Subject: Re: wind noise in vans

We have a 1977 Bus with a sunroof. It gets pretty loud with the roof all
the way open at highway speeds, but not as loud as when the windows are
open. We have found, however, that the ventilation:noise ratio is best with
the roof open about about a foot and the vent open.
