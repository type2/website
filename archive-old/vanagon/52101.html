Subject: steering rack parts
Date: Fri, 22 Nov 1996 23:27:54 -0600

Has anyone been able to locate power steering rack parts for vanagons?  I
have a friend who rebuilt his own rack on a Quantum, and I'm assuming the
racks are nearly the same.  He said the job was very easy, and that it ran
reliably after the rebuild.  So, if I can find the parts, I may give it a
try on the syncro

thanks for the help
(ps if not parts, anyone got a cheap rack FS?)
