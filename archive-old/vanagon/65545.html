Subject:      Re-upholstering question

A) I have been watching the interior of my '87 slowly degrade and am
starting to get a little bummed about it.
B) The PO :p  had a dog that basically lived in the vanagon. As a result,
the canine musk soaked into the carpet on the floor and the whole thing has
a kind of musty smell that will NOT go away!
Any recommendations on where to go for re-upholstering of the floor?


TIA
