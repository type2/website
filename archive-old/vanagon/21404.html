&gt; Hello,
&gt; I would *REALLY* like to get the poptop shite again. Tried: Soft scrub with
&gt; bleach, SOS pads, Fibreglass boat cleaner, et al=8A  But it still looks grey=

&gt; I believe the dirt is at a mircroscopic level. Any Suggestions?

X-14 worked really well for me. I tried a substitute first because I 
couldn't find X-14 on the supermarket shelf; I just didn't work.

Avoid getting it on the paint and hose off the top and the rest of the van 
within 5-10 minutes. (I did this in front of a do-it-yourself car-wash.)
