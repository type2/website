&gt; J.C. Whitney sells tire chains by mail order, including the heavier duty
  ones with that extra little bar to extend the life and improve the grip in
  ice. I have an old set of those and they will shake your fillings loose if
  you have to drive on pavement with them. In snow, they work great. I also
  have a set of those cable things - much more pleasant as regards vibration
  and noise, but less grip when the going gets rough. Under some really 
  stormy conditions on some steep curvy roads at Sequoia Nat'l park a couple 
  years ago I ended up with the cables on the front and the gnarly chains on 
  the  back and could pretty much go &lt;and stop&gt; where I pleased. This was 
  weather severe enough that even four wheel drives were chained up. 

  If you want me to bring you a set of something from the local FLAPS, I'm 
  happy to but they would be more expensive than from J.C Whitney I think.

&gt; I'm looking for a set of chains for my bus (205/75R14).  For some reason, 
&gt; I do have one heavy duty chain that fits, and would like to find a mate 
&gt; for it.  The only ones I can find locally are light-duty ones that look 
&gt; like they are good for a couple of miles.  Of course I'm not surprised 
&gt; that I can't find a good selection of chains down here in the Land of the
&gt; Perpetual Furnace, but I'm hoping that someone can recommend a mail
&gt; order place where I can get a set of heavy duty chains.  Or, maybe 
&gt; someone coming to Red Rock from snow country could pick me up a set
&gt; before they leave?  Thanks for any advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone asked about the weather at Red Rock.  I'm not sure of the 
&gt; elevation there, but it's been close to 90F every day recently across the 
&gt; border in Arizona.
