Subject: '86 Westy parts, etc.

I recently joined this list to assist my brother who is now the very
proud owner of an '86 Westy. He is having some trouble locationg a
few parts. He would like the full set of mud flaps and parts to fix
the roof vent which leaks. Also, the fresh-water pump is broken and
he is not sure if he should try to get an original or generic
replacement. Another problem is that the &quot;frig&quot; does not get very
cold. All I know about gas refrigerators is that they can sometimes
be helped by turning up-side-down overnight but I have no idea how
this is done in the Westy without rolling the van. 8-(
