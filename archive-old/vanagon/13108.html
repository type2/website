Well, just for balance, here's a totally different opinion/experience:

I run the 34 PICT-3 and the .009 dist. on both my '71's.  They both idle
well, but have the same off-idle flat spots.  After experiencing this
setup (especially on the Bug), I wouldn't go back to the vacuum setup.
When I lived in CA and smog cert. time came around, I'd slap the vacuum
advance dist. in, reset the timing, then go have it smogged.  When I
got home, out came the vacuum dist. again.

Now, when I first got the .009, it took me quite a while to find the right
combination of timing and carb settings to get things to run right.
What worked best for me was a timing setting of 7.5 BTDC, and a larger
main jet.  Since I moved to the Arizona high country, I have replaced
the larger jet with the stock one, but I still use the .009.  I get
28-29mpg (on my Bug) on the hiway.

As far as the off-idle flat spot, well, I've just learned to live with it.
Fancy footplay with the accelerator has become second nature to me.
The gain in performance more than offsets the annoyance factor.

I don't know why there is such a wide range of experience with the .009
dist.
