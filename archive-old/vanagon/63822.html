&gt; Hi Vanapeople!
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some way I can get my pass. seat's arm rests back on!?!?  or 
&gt; should I take it to a pro? what dya think they cost?!
&gt; 


      The armrests are held on by what I believe VW calls a cotter 
pin (cheap). It's a hollow pin a couple of inches long that must be 
pounded through the hole in the metal bracke tin the arm rest itself, 
and the hole in the round knob of the bracket on the seat.  The 
downside is that the holes have to be lined up, and the operation 
performed in the very limited space between the back of the armrest 
and the side of the seatback by compressing the foam padding and 
cursing at regular intervals.
