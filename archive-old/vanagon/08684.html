&gt; I can't believe you want to invest anything in this bus before you
&gt; own it.
&gt; 
&gt; IMO if the car doesn't run, you should assume the worst and make
&gt; your offer accordingly.   You can't even do a decent compression
&gt; test because you can't warm up the car.  If it has been sitting for
&gt; a while then the entire engine compartment is in question.  Don't
&gt; waste your money to the sellers benefit.  It's better to make a
&gt; low offer and start from there or walk away from it.

The only reason I would do anything like this is that the bus
is in excellent shape with regard to the body, camping stuff,
interior, etc.  It also has clearly been well-maintained
throughout its life.

Also the asking price is $700.  I decided it would be
worth an afternoon or two of work and a few bucks to get
a better picture of what shape the mechanicals are in. 
I've seen campers in this good shape but running selling
for  2 or 3 thousand here in the rust belt. 

If it needs a rebuild but everything else is OK the price
still would be reasonable.  If the brakes trans. steering, etc. are
also shot then it might not be worth it in any case.  That's
why I was willing to get a little greasy to find out.
