Subject: Re: resistor platinum plugs...

Hi Patrick.  I've been running on these same plugs in my '90 for the 
past 12 months now, with *fantastic*  results.  I would keep them in 
if you're happy with them.  I've got nothing but praise for the Bosch 
Platinums... HOWEVER, you should be running WR7CP plugs in the 
Vanagon engine (just noticed the number difference)

Hope this helps.
Harry.

&gt;  without thinking i bought a set of WR7DP plugs for my 2.1
