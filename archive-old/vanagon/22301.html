Subject: Tell me about VW books

A lot of you people mention the Bentley &quot;bible&quot;, but I have never seen
it over here. 

I got a US book catalog in the mail the other day from Classic Motorbooks.
They list the bentley &quot;VW Vanagon 1980-1991&quot; for $84.95, quite a price but 
it is almost a 1000 pages thick. (Are there cheaper places?)

I have a few of the VW Workshop Manuals, they're informatives on some
parts but leaves out a lot of details and always refer to these 4711 kinds
of odd VW special tools.

So is *the* book to get for the hobby mechanic that wants do know and fix
everything about his bus?  I have a '85 with 1.9L, gas heater.

Also, the Muir &quot;Idiot&quot; book seems to deal exclusively with air cooled motors,
how much of the info in it would apply to later waterpumpers?  

Please reply by mail if you want, I assume most of you already 
know these books.
