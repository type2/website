Charles,

Given that isoproply alcohol is used to take of care freeze up problems 
in winter, I'd be very surprised to find that ethanol would increase 
freeze-up.
We continue to have no trouble sumemr or winter usign 10% ethanol year 
round in Iowa, where it likes to get from 100F to -30F.

The problem I have had with ethanol is the first time it is used it has a 
tendency to pick up all the rust/sediment that usually lies in the bottom of 
the gas tank.  With gasoline it stays on the bottom, but, with ethanol that 
stuff floats to the top and sucked in, along with any water floating on the 
bottom of the tank.
A couple of new fuel filters were enough, but, some people were telling me to 
take the tank down and clean it.  I also believe ethanol gives the fuel line 
more probablity of vapor lock.
These are just my prejudices, perhaps, I should be cleansed of them.
