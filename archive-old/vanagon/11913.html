So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 
&gt; Don't ya just hate it when you tear something apart, fearing the 
&gt; worst and it turns out to be something simple?  Actually, we SHOULD 
&gt; all be glad when this happens but...

Well, I had my heater switch go about a year after I had the '91.
It was pretty obvious though.  I turned the switch and nothin'
happened.  Played with the know and the fan would come on when
I pushed in a little.  Futzed with trying to fix the switch.  Waste
of time.  News switch and alls well.
