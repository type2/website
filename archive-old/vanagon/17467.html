Should not be a problem since at least one Province, Alberta does
not issue front plates anymore.  So I guess it should be okay not
to have a front plate anywhere in the US or Canada. 

p.s.  We put all kinds of plates on the front now including
german, UK, every province and state as well as commercial
plates. The police just love it!!! not
