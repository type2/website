The classifed ads in the Munich newspaper lists some, if you can read
German. The price level for VW Campers in general seems at least as high
as in the U.S. , if not higher. Of course, there were no diesel Westfalias
2 or 4 wheel drive imported by VW in the U.S. 

The EPA pamphlet on importing vehicles to the US indicates that it is
almost impossible for individuals these days. The grey market is
controlled by a handful of converters that specialize in ultra-luxury
cars. 

Conversion of gasoline engines to diesel for vehicles already imported  is
apparently being done by several shops in California and N.Y.
