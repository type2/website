  OFFICE MEMO          Bike Racks                             Date:4/24/96

Hi all
I don't know if this has been covered to everyone's satisfaction, but.....
There are a ton of advertisements for bike racks that fit, via a variety of
means, to the back of a vehicle. Trailer hitch, rear window, etc.
The name of the magazine is Velo News and can be found at any decent bike
shop. If you can't find it I can give any info that is needed, I've got the
mag.
Hope this helps

Kevin
