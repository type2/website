&gt;I called the dealer with the list suggestion for replacing the solenoid and 
&gt;he came back with an estimate for $372.  He also doesn't believe in just 
&gt;replacing the solenoid, so he gave me an estimate to replace the starter: 
&gt; $542 which includes 12mo/12,000mi warranty.
&gt;
&gt;Is nothing reasonably priced or simple?

Look, when I had my starter replaced, I got a rebuilt one for 200.00, and 
the labor was approx. 40.00.

A friendly local mechanic did it for this price.
Perhaps the key word here is &quot;rebuilt&quot;. 
It workd great, though.
