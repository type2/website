Subject: Busses on '66'

I know this is not Friday, but I spaced out posting this earlier and time
is running short ...

Just a reminder that GROOVE's June Bug Jamboree All-VW Show &amp; Swap will
be held June 14th in Springfield, MO.  Also Busses on '66' will be held
the same weekend (Fri-Sun) at the KOA Kampground.  Call 417-889-8813
(Lance) or 417-833-2047 (me) for details or send your snail-mail address
to me and I'll send you a flyer on either event.

Hope to see you there!
