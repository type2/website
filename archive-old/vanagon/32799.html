 &gt; I'm looking for some suggestions on penetrating liquid to use to
 &gt; free up bolts that have probably not been moved in 30 years.  I've been
 &gt; using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
 &gt; there that is better.

I like Mouse Milk.  I get it at the pilot shop at the Palo Alto airport.  It 
is very effective at loosening corroded nutz'n'boltz.

Try the yellow pages under airplanes and look for a store that sells supplies 
to pilots: charts, headsets, leather jackets, sunglasses, very very large 
watches and so on.  If they also have safety wire, oil filters and landing 
light bulbs, chances are they'll have Mouse Milk.

No really, that's what it's called.  Picture of a mouse in a jumpsuit with a 
wrench on the bottle and everything.  No, I don't know where they get it 
from...
