Subject: Re: Battery Plate plus leak question



Its a common problem for breadloafs to have rainwater accumulate on the 
battery. The water is funnelled right down through the air vents. I think 
this is the main reason the battery tray rusts out - mixture of water and 
H2SO4. I put a shower cap over the battery in my '72. VW had some factory 
fix, but I haven't seen an example.
