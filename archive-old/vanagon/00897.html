Sorry I'm a bit behind here, but for what it's worth:

&gt; Hi, my seats for my '78 bus are toast.  I would like to replace them with

&gt; a junkyard, or such) will fit in there?  Any and all help appreciated.
&gt; thanks, DAN.

I replaced the seats in my '78 with vinyl (a less comfortable covering but for
sure more durable than the lovely plaid fabric jobbers I had before) ones
from a '76 at the junkyard. Guy there thought the Vanagon seats had different
rails. Also received the feedback from him that the Audi 5000 seats he put
in his bus were a bit long-bottomed making reaching the pedals difficult
(maybe he had short legs, I dunno).  I checked into after-market seats but
found only expensive seats for bugs but didn't get too deep into the research.
The pair of seats from the '76 (a bit scuffed but no tears, brown vinyl
covering) were $80.00

Good luck, Tim Burnett
