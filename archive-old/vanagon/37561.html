Hey all,
Today I removed the starter/solenoid.  What a pain in the ass!  On my
old bug it was pretty easy, but on my '78 bus I had to remove that
S-shaped rubber duct between the air cleaner and the intake air
distributor to get to that 17-mm nut so I could get a wrench and/or a
finger or two on it.  It was kinda tricky taking out that bolt with just
myself doing it but I managed finally.  It's a good thing that that bolt
is shaped so that you can hold it against the starter to prevent it from
turning.  

I attempted to remove the solenoid from the starter but the two screws
that hold it on are rusted as tight as they can be.  I have liberally
soaked it down with WD-40 so maybe if I let it sit for a while I will
be able to get it off.  

I went around to a few local parts stores to find out what a rebuilt
unit will cost.  I am replacing both the starter and solenoid just so I
don't have to do the same repair twice.  Trak Auto wanted $124 for a
rebuilt starter, the local Fredericksburg Auto Parts wanted $101, but
Pep Boys had the lowest price at $92.  Since I am a poor college
student, economics won in this case and I ordered it from Pep Boys.  It
will arrive tomorrow and I will install it tomorrow.  

Now off to work dissambling the solenoid to see what the deal is.

Thanks to everybody for their help, I will post when I get the job
finished.

Sean
