Subject:       '63 Panel Van turned camper!!!


I went to look at a &quot;panel van&quot; a couple of days ago with a 
friend..........who _needs_ one! -) The van was pretty solid all round 
- it had been sitting in a garage for 7 years ,  but and here's the 
big question...It had windows in the sides which had not been done by 
anyone with any V- Dub knowledge - Is it a major job to repannel the 
sides of the van - to get the right shape &amp; curvature without 
warping??  A panel is a major find in my part of the world - so any 
replies would be greatly appreciated.
TIA
Cheers
