Subject: water from A/C Unit

Hi folks... back on the list after having been away on holidays for three
weeks.  We've been to the US to visit my wife's family in PA... and while
there reveled in a heat wave so, of course, I fired up the A/C unit in
&quot;Moo&quot;... our new/used 88 Westy. The AC worked fine except for a fairly
large amount of water that formed/leaked on the bottom of the rear mounted
unit.  When I had a chance I took the back panel off and saw what looked to
be some kind of whater holding tray, and pipes that lead to the outside
rear air intakes.  I couldn't see the pipes clearly but there seemed to be
mo obstructions.  Any suggestions and would the Bently vanagon book
describe these units and how to service them?  Any sugestions would be
greatly appreciated.!
