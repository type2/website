&gt; &gt; hassle of driving crosstown and paying $$$ to the repairman, something
&gt; &gt; possessed me to apply compressed air to the refrigerator drain plug. I could
&gt; &gt; hear the tiny pop of igniting gas when I did this. Hum... wonder if the
&gt; &gt; refrigerator vent is blocked? Took off the vent fitting and looked in.
&gt; 
When we first bought Cassie ('89 Westy) last year, I had a hard time
getting the fridge running, so I brought it to Broadway VW (Oakland,
CA) and the guy said I needed a new igniter _at_ $250 or so. Hmmm. I then
brought Cassie to Royal Motors (dealer) in San Francisco, and their
mechanic &quot;blew out the line with compressed air&quot;, and since then the
fridge is fine (although still quirky).

I still wish I could find a competent non-dealer mechanic in the Bay
Area (anybody know if such a person?) - overall, I don't trust VW
dealer service....

While we're on the subject, how do people determine how much propane
they have in their tank? I thought about putting some kind of pressure
guage in the propane plumbing system so I could monitor usage - until
then, determining when to refill remains an art...
