For Friday!

There once was a couple of schmucks
They had vans, they had good luck and big bux
mantis has always wanted a VW van
to travel the country, it would be grand!

The internet is great, you may question and speak
but its best not to, make not a peep
At least at Vanagon, with its sprinkling of schmucks
But mantis says, &quot;they can all take a flying fu*k&quot;


This poem is dedicated to all the schmucks in vanagon, who could not offer 
wisdom, but only personal attacks to a newbie like me.  To those who display 
an attitude quite different from typical vw owners.  

To everyone else, thanks for giving me a taste of what its like to own a VW, 
i still cant wait.

one little mini poem...

Ric can suck my dick
