The list sends the messages directly to you, and from the originator, 
with a reply-to to the mailng list.
I don't think I have much control over that.

&gt; Yep, I'm getting the mesasages.
&gt; 
&gt; One question for everyone:  Are these messages getting sent directly to 
&gt; you, or are they coming as if from a mailing list, like they should be?

If you have any advice, I'll accept it.

Thanks,
