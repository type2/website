Subject: was - Vanagon rear speakers - now falling evap assembly

There is a recall campaign to fix falling down duct work.  I don't know
if this include the evap assembly - can anyone comment?

My evap assembly is being held up via a 2x6.  The local dealer had my
car ALMOST A WEEK waiting for some part for the recall.  I finally gave
up, got my car back and haven't had the time to try again.

 &gt;Thanks to those who reponded.  You've probably prevented a decapitation.
 &gt;Now a follow-up.  The AC cover seems to have significant cracks near the
 &gt;bolts that hold this thing up (particularly, the ones towards the sides
 &gt;of the van).  Is this at risk of falling?  Will VW fix it (for free)?
