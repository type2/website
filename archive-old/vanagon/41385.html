Subject:       New web images

Hi All,

Thanks to the generosity of Richard Mansfield I have 17 new JPG
images from the Wolfsberg Museum on my web site including a 1934!
Beetle, a Schwimmwagen, a Type 87 Command Car, 1949 Beetle, a
stretched Beetle, a postal van,  a Beetle-based passenger trolley,
and a flatbed truck. There are also several VW publicity posters
dating (probably) from the early 1940's to the late 50's including a
KdF Wagen, several Beetle Cabriolet's and a Karman Ghia. You can find
them by going to the Car Talk page from the main page. Some very nice
images. Check them out.
