Subject: Is ONE DAY PAINT any good? 

        ATTN So. Californians   
   
        Is ONE DAY PAINT any good or do you have a better suggestion.
        They will do a two tone Urathane paint job with a 5yr warr.
        against peeling, fading etc. including my bumpers and wheels
        for $600.00.  What do you think?
