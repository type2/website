Subject:      Baltimores OK,  Motels suck

The whole family had a real great time in Baltimore this weekend;  so
far the only citys that we get along with are baltimore and philly.
The motel room that my wife got (for free  through master card)
reminded us why we ususlly camp.  Not only did the room reek of
cigarettes but it was filthy by our standards and a child safety
nightmare!   No play ground, just black top and non-stop bed jumpping
for the five year old... uugh we couldn't wait to get a shower at
home and disinfect our stuff!  What an education for the kids though!
There was a group of hookers working the lobby,  welfare rooms on
the first floor and constant rap music played through the hotel
speakers.  I was disappointed that there were no used rubbers under
the bed or crack vials in the lot.  The westy really fit in along
with the Arian family from Jersey....my wife will NEVER complain
about a little rain or lukewarm showers again.

At Inner harbor a shelter woman wanted to wash our windows for money
so that she could buy her kids food....we emptied our cabinets for
her!  She got apples,  oranges,  corn flakes,  some chips,  cheese,
and five juice containers...later we found most of the food in the
garbage,  maybe the food wasn't fresh enough?  maybe she will leave
westys laden with food and children alone from now on...my kids got
more of an education this weekend than I barganed for.
