Subject: bike rack for breadloafs (maybe vanagons too)

i checked out the paulchen rack system.  man is that thing _expensive_!!
there is no way i can afford a $350+ rack.

i made my own for my breadloaf.  it holds 3 bikes by their forks,
handlebars up on the rear of the van.  they can be swung aside for
engine work, and the total cost of the materials was about $10 (though
it did require some welding and drilling).  i am very pleased with it.
the bikes are very secure, and the rack is all but invisible (really!)
when the bikes are not there.

if anyone is interested i will post a more detailed description.
