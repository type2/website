Subject: Re: Head Gasket Replacement on '85 Vanagon

Boy, that seems steep to me. I can't be just the gaskets, it must include
new heads too.  How many hours of labor are they figuring on?  I guess
there is a lot of work involved but that seems to me like overkill.
Especially when a VW remanufactured long block probably costs less!!  This
needs further investigation.

James.



&gt;
&gt;The next question is this: now that we know it is the head
&gt;gaskets and have been quoted an estimate of $1,600 (we have
&gt;a new water pump already, if not the price would have been
&gt;$1,900) my husband is eager to do the repairs himself with
&gt;the help of this list, a few good books which we have (The
&gt;Compleat Idiot - by Muir and Sealy (?),
&gt;
&gt;Also, is it reasonable that we should have to pay $1,600 for
&gt;new head gaskets which cost no more than a few dollars?  We
&gt;will have the detailed estimate tonight and go over it but
&gt;it seems a bit steep to most people I talk with.
