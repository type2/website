Subject:      '82 Westy for Sale

August 23 Boston Globe had the following ad:
VW, '82 Westfalia, slps 4, fridge, sink, stove, rblt eng, new paint &amp;
brakes. $4100/BO. (617) 776-4034.
I think its owner lives just a couple of blocks from me, but I've never
taken a good look at the van, nor spoken with the owner.  Usual disclaimers;
just passing on info.  Jim.
