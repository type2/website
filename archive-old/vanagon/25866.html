Subject: Hot water heating.



To All,

I think many of the subscribers responding the the heating ideas will find
some useful information in my sermon on 'Stale Air Heating' but if the
subject is auxiliary heaters you could do a lot worse than to use an
immersion-type 110vac powered hot water heater.  The idea is that a time
turns on the immersion heater at a time calculated to have the heavily
insulated water storage tank at near-boiling heat by the time you're ready to
depart.  The heat is extracted from the tank of hot water by a regular car
heater radiator and fan.

Such systems offer surprising utility due to waters unique ability to store
heat.
