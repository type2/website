Subject: Re: 73 Westy into California...how hard?

I made a couple calls this morning and here's what I found out.

1. I phoned the South Coast Air Quality Management District and talked
to a Dave Cole. (800)CUT-SMOG  I told him that I intended to register
a '73 Bus w/smog from Canada.  Dave said that there's a $300 impact
fee and I'd need a smog certificate ($20-40).  Then go to the Dept. of
Motor Vehicles for the tags.  Dave referred me to the Air Resources Board.

2. I phoned the CA Air Resources Board (818)575-6800 and spoke with
Tom from El Monte. I explained my intentions as above.  He said that
I must write to VWoA or VW of Canada and request a letter stating
whether or not the vehicle could be made to comply with US standards 
and CA emissions.  The letter should state what additional equipment
is required (if any) to turn the bus into a US model. It's up to the
manufacturer to supply this information.

  Tom and I discussed a scenario in which smog equipment may be
missing or altered.  The jist of it was that money was no object
when making a vehicle comply with emissions standards. &quot;You mean
that I could put $2K of smog parts on a $1K vehicle?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;


  Recently I replaced the 1700 w/carbs with a 2000 FI engine from
a wrecked '78 westy.  I did this for two reasons.  One was to get
smog back on the car. The 1700 needed up to $1400 in smog equip
and that's just for the parts (carbs, air pump, egr heads, etc..)
The other reason was the horsepower of the 2000 and the hydraulic
lifters.  Well, there's a third reason. I could head a rod bearing
breaking up on the 1700 and bits and pieces of it were ground up
and stuck in the oil strainer screen. :-(
  They're making it easier to send your old cars to the crusher
in CA.  I decided to try and keep 'big orange' on the road a few
more years and help us all breathe a little easier.
