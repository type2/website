 Er, well my manual calls the plate under the generator pedestal (the
 plate with three semi-circular louvres) an oil deflector plate.
 Prehaps this is one of those we call it this, you call it that
 type situations. Frinstance, where are these rocker panels everyone
 mentions?

&gt; You on fresh ground here, but I'm interested in how the type 4 fits.  Does
&gt; the bell housing fit directly? wOw.

 The type 4 does fit into the original tranny, but the 2 litre pressure
 plate fouled on some small ridge in the bell housing when I tried to turn 
 over the motor, so I had to use a combination of 1800/2 litre/1600 bits 
 to get the flywheel,centre disc, pressure plate and release (throwout?) 
 bearing to fit and work.


&gt; 
&gt; Your cat is that valuable?  Ours just purrs and rubs it's head on everything.
&gt; 
  Well ours (well it adopted us actually) does that, but also seems to
  loose enough fur each day to maybe go into producing free range cat 
  fur type 2 seat covers. I was hoping to make my fortune and retire
  to a split screen in the country :)
