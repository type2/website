&gt; If I could only find an absolutely singleminded, pure group of people...

Another vote for Prozac!

&gt; The worst offender is this mailing list I've heard about that is actually 
&gt; a _support group_ for people who drive aging, polluting vehicles MADE BY 
&gt; KRAUTS!  They're taking food from the mouths of American workers AND 
&gt; poisoning the planet.  Not to mention their vehicles are ugly.

You mean that the &quot;People's Car&quot; was originally designed by Hitler and
other Nazis?!?! This is the kind of stuff that will make the government
step in and cause the imminent death of the 'net!

&gt; flames to dev/facetiousness

And followups set to news.admin.misc, alt.syntax.tactical, and 
alt.dodge.neon.hi.squeaky.voice.
