&gt; case there's someone else who'd be interested in these.  They're both in 
&gt; Northern Colorado.  If someone buys the one with the Porsche in it, you 
&gt; have to give me a ride :).

Most people that quote Porsche engines in thier breadloaves are just
refering to the fact that their engines are almost identical to those
used in the 914.  I've yet to find otherwise (in the ads I've answered).
If they say, &quot;6 cyl Porsche engine&quot;, *then* I will be interested.
