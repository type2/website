Subject: VW Bus server update


I updated the VW bus Web server
(http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/) a bit this evening.  I added a
VW logo from rmk_at_snowhit.kc63.att_dot_com (Richard - sorry I lost your last name
- get back to me and I'll credit you properly).  Joel's little tire table is
there.  As I notice new versions I will update it.  There is also a pointer
to David Murphy's VW page (seemed to be all bugs, but I'll take what I can
get :-) and a link to the recent Vanagon mailing list messages that are
available on the server.

I'd still like some bus/vanagon/eurovan images to place on the server.  I'd
particularly like a little bus image (or a big bus image I can scale down)
to use as an inline for jumping back to the top page.  Want to immortalize
your vehicle?  Scan in a picture of it and mail it to me...
