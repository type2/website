    hi Harvey !
 glad your &quot;memory light&quot; went on...it's the best explanation i've heard so

far. i'll check the rabbit's wiring diagram, but i'm sure you're right. now,
if i could only convince myself it's worth fixin'...
 cordially,
            gregor

   P.S.: ...i mean, let's face it: it's NOT a bus !
