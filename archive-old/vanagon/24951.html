That's the name of --
Jeff's yuppie company.   :)

Jeff used to drive a (cool) 74 bus, but (take the kids out of the room) 
now drives a Eurovan.  He remarks:

&gt; Funny thing, I feel like exactly the same person! By God, I think I am the
&gt; same person.

WRONG!!  Sorry to be the one to break this to you, Jeff, but you are not 
the same person.  You were horribly transmogrified the second you bought 
your Eurovan.  This phenomenon is documented by Copious Research.  Really.

Seriously, though, if you're a happy wavin' Eurovan driver, then great.  
I'm just sayin' I NEVER get a wave back from them up here, and that most 
of the drivers look like Yuppie Scum (tm).  I can spot 'em a mile away... 
yakkin' on the cell phone, &quot;Baby on Board&quot; sticker in rear window, power 
suit or power casual clothes, Starbuck's coffee holder to hold Starbuck's 
coffee (latte, actually...), and NOT A DOOB IN THE WHOLE DAMN CAR!  
Degenerates!  How can they live like that!

Hey Jeff, wave at me, I'll wave back, just as long as you don't catch me 
when I'm trying to re-load my bong...  :)
