Subject: propane gauge?
Date: Tue, 29 Apr 1997 08:12:52 -0400

Awhile ago I asked if anyone had ever installed a propane gauge to their
tank.  I have gotten a number of estimates on how long the gas will last
but no answers about the gauge.  It must be able to be done if there is
enough room.  I guess that's my question.  I too am having troubles getting
the fridge to run on gas.  Have tried all the easy suggestions, now I guess
we have to get down to the serious stuff.

Thanks in advance for info
