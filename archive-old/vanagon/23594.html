&gt;There are some losses associated with charging the deep-cycle battery. Not
&gt;sure how much.


Sami,

I'm not sure where the losses occur or if they are equal for charge and
discharge but the rule of thumb is that commercial-grade lead/acid batteries
are 90% efficient when new.  Pump in 100 watts, you can expect to recover 90.
 I've also heard that the little sealed lead/acid cells manufactured by
Gates, Toshiba and others uses materials very close to laboratory-grade
purity, which results in lead/acid cells that are slightly more efficient and
have a longer service life.  I think I'd want to see the fine print on this
before I bet my life on it, though.  Maximum service life is usually a
reflection of maintaining a high state of charge.  The batteries at the phone
company last as long as twenty years -- and seldom see anything other than
full-charge, whereas a battery in automotive service gets the hell beat out
of it, lasts three or four years.

Mebbe we should all drive... phone companies?
