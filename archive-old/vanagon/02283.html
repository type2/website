&gt; &gt; &gt; There's only one reason they replaced the air-cooled engines.  The stricter
&gt; &gt; &gt; emission requirements forced them to.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If this were true then how is it possible for these engines to pass 
&gt; &gt; today's CA smog tests? Also, Europe (the bulk of the market)  never had 
&gt; &gt; any of these tough emission requirements until the late 80's? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They don't PASS CA smog test for TODAY'S vehicles. They are tested for 
&gt; emissions at levels set for the MODEL YEAR.._dot_usually (an exception is the 
&gt; 1991 model year Vanagons sold in California as 1990 models to pass the 
&gt; looser emission levels...I have a VanagonCarat manufactured 2/91 which is 
&gt; a 1990 MODEL for California registration purposes!)

Not so fast -----
I checked the smog standards sticker on the side of the 
vehicle ( an '82) and the one supplied when the vehicle is smogged - the 
latter are 
well within the standards set for the vehicles of five years ago 
(although it wouldn't pass today's standards). There is also a VW bug 
manufactured in Mexico that is equipped with tight fuel emission 
controls...and available in the US..and of course the Porsche aircooled is 
still in evidence...


Besides the bulk of the pollution control is carried out by the catalytic 
convertor a component common to all vehicles. If you hang enough stuff on 
any engine (air or water) it will pass any standard. &gt; 


&gt;  &gt; -- &gt;Isn't it more of a case that VW had tried to get away with putting 
&gt; &gt; an old engine (carry over from bus) in a new much heavier body and found 
&gt; &gt; that the hp was simply not up to snuff? -DC
