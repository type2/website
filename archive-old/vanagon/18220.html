Subject: Re: brake question

&gt;
&gt;On my brother's `61 he has an interesting brake problem--the passenger rear
&gt;wheel will start dragging. All new brake stuff except lines. You can
&gt;go to the rear and loosen the bleeder screw and there will be some pressure,
&gt;back the adjusters off a bit, and it will be fine until the next time.

Did he replace the rubber hoses?  These break down internally and your
brake springs don't have enough pressure to force fluid from wheel
cylinders back to the master cylinder.
