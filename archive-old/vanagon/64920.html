Gail,
This is probably a solder joint on a big component that vibrates and
eventually cracks, causing intermittent problems. Take the ECU apart
and examine the board closely. Resolder suspect joints and put a dab
of silicone seal on the component itself to prevent recurrence.

&gt; Could well be the ECU - I had same symptoms years ago in my '87 and
&gt; it was the control unit. You could tap on the box (or jiggle it when
&gt; unmounted but connected) and the engine would stop. The original in
&gt; mine was made for VW by Triumph-Adler, not Bosch. Replaced with
&gt; Bosch and has been OK since.
&gt;
&gt; Bus Depot has new units at good prices - call Ron Salmon at (610)
&gt; 754-8989.
