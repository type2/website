&gt; Hey folks,
&gt; 
&gt; My acclerator cable is sticking when it is cold...Last year it never did
&gt; this (even at -30F).  This year it does it at any point below freezing...
&gt; 
&gt; How do I fix it?  Is there a lubricant that can be applied with cable still
&gt; on the van?  Where is it most likely freezing up ?...

Mark:

As you probably figured out, the throttle cable is a steel cable, very much
like the kind you find on bikes.  As long as it is, I don't think you can
effectively lubricate its entire length with the cable in place.  To
remove and lube the cable you need to drop the spare tire to get at the cable
attachment point (as I recall, it's under a removable plate which you can
only get at with the spare removed) and pull the cable out.  I think there's
also a rubber boot at this point which you may find has deteriorated.

Push the cable back in, greasing it as you go.
