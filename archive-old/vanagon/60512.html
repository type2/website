Subject: Re: Clutchless

I recently had the head gasket replaced in my 85 westy. When this job was
completed my clutch was also replaced. I have driven it about 12,000 miles
and I had a complete failure of the clutch. My mechanic told me it was
either the transmission seal went, dumping gear oil into the clutch
causing catastrophic failure or the clutch was bad to begin with or I ride
the clutch! There was no gradual failure it went all at once, smoke show
and all. What can I expect to pay to have a new clutch put in and should
the mechanic who did the heads be liable for not putting a new seal in or
putting it in improperly. Any advice will surely be appreciated.
thanks!
