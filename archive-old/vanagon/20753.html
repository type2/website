&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know how to fix the sliding door lock on an 82 vanagon? In 
&gt; my van (name: turtle, what else could you call a diesel westy), the 
&gt; little knob on the inside that locks the sliding door does not stay in 
&gt; the &quot;open&quot; position any more. To open the door you have to either push 
&gt; the knob up (from the inside) or keep the key turned (from the outside). 
&gt; It seems like a spring or something is missing. 
&gt; Does anybody know how to remove the door panel in order to get to the lock?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks,

I've got the same problem on my '82. I looked into it once, and reached the 
conclusion that you need to remove the inside door panel. This looks like a 
major PITA since the plastic fasteners that hold the door panel on seem like 
they'll break and need to be replaced when you pry them off.

Anybody have any luck with this operation?
