Subject: Mass. Vanagon-ers

Hi,
	I'm a soon-to-be owner, almost definitely of an '82 Vanagon L. 
I'd love to hear anything that might be helpful to a newbie, such as 
local repair/parts places (I go to school in Amherst and live in 
Westwood) or really anything at all... If anyone has a little time, I'd 
love to email someone some details of the van I'm getting ready to buy 
and see what they think... thanks!

Jamie Waldinger
