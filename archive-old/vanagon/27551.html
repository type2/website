&gt;&gt;diesels have a different bellhousing from gas,  that's about as far as I can
&gt;&gt;go.  The 091/1 4spd. trans was in both air and H2O vanagons, diesels got
&gt;&gt;five speeds (sometimes)  Syncros have 094-4WD.
&gt;&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^


&gt;Anybody know if it is possible to put one of these five-speeds, in
&gt;an '81 Vanagon, to mate with the original '81 Vanagon gas engine?
=====================================
1)  I believe that the bellhousing interface between the diesel block and a
gas engine rabbit/jetta block is the same, because the diesel block is the
same as those gas engines.  
However, the diesel  may well be a different bellhousing interface than for a
wasserboxer or a/c engine.
 
2)  My recollection on 5 sp diesels is that they were intended &quot;next year&quot;
('83).  The problem is that, to my knowledge, '82 was the only year that VWoA
brought the diesels over to the US, and all of them had 4 speeds.  Therefore
the availability of a 5 sp. tranny for a diesel in the US is very
questionable.  I should add that it is also  my understanding that the gearing
in the diesel transaxels is different that for the gas engines (higher
revs/mile for the diesel) and that therefore you may want to check carefully
before you retrofit ANY diesel transaxel to an a/c engine.(Conversly, I am
inclined to guess that the straight transplant of a gas rabbit/jetta engine
onto a diesel transaxel will result in  unnecessarily high revs/mile of the
gas engine in this new application - hence the question in my mind &quot;is it
possible to modify the gear ratios or final drive ratio in the diesel 4 sp
tranny to better match to alternate engines?&quot;
