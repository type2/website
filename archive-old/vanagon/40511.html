&gt; and if anybody wants to start a new life in Memphis, TN ...

&gt; Elvis drove a VW! Reluctant owner must sell well established Volkswagen
&gt; repair, restoration business in Memphis, TN. Auto dealer license with
&gt; (bank financing) on sales and restorations. Large customer base, tons of
&gt; parts, 75 assorted VWs. Always busy. Unlimited growth for quality minded
&gt; caring individual. Asking $150,000 terms (WAC). Also cool house in midtown
&gt; 5 minutes away. Low 50's.

Hmmm, I think the members of the list-serve should buy this.  Lemme see,
last statz, we have 627 members, that means ... everyone only has to
contribute $150000/627 = $239.23, less than a set of tires! Only about
one order of magnitude more than a list T-shirt!  Probably, it would
be worth it just for the &quot;tons of parts&quot; and &quot;75 assorted VWs&quot;.

Or, if we finance it, payments would probably be around $1000 per month,
thats $1000/627 = $1.59 per month.  Even *I* can afford that.

That way, we could have a home base/shrine for vanagon_at_lenti people!  We
could have yearly pilgrimages there!  It could be a co-op for list members
where we could send our busses to be restored at a discount!

I think Joel should be in charge of this venture.

Hmmm, next I say we buy 50 acres of land in Colorado .......
