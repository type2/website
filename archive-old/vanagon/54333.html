Subject: Re: Kelley Blue Book site / Re: FS: '89 Westy

&gt; For what it's worth (no pun intended), I looked up the value of the '89 
&gt; Westy I'm asking $12,500 for. With its specific options and mileage, the 
&gt; Blue Book retail price for it is $16,000. (Dealer trade-in is about $10k, 
&gt; so it seems I'm actually asking closer to wholesale than to retail.)

Actually as I was the origional to post about this site, I note that 
the listed dealer trade in is indeed that, NOT wholesale.  NADA 
typically lists trade in as the mid way between wholesale and retail, 
and the KBB seems to agree well with NADA as far as I have tested it 
on the RETAIL and TRADE-IN, wholesale slightly lower.  As to the 
price for the said van, to me it would seem a tad steep on the outset 
but reasonable ASKING if a really meticulously clean van with NO problems.
Take FI about 2 years ago my parents turned down a similar van from a 
private individual  ('87 loaded, PW, PDL, everything for $9,500 with 
about 40k less miles, it got traded to a Subaru dealer who immediately
demanded $13,500 ( I had to know so went and test drove it) for it
and sold it for ?? within a few months.
