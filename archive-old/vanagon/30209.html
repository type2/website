Subject: Re: Owners Manuals

I called and they're out of '71s 8(...it was worth a try. Guess they have
scattered years. The computer only lists back to 60 but they don't have any
more...I checked to see if they're gonna get any more and the voice said
she could place an order and see if they can back order or reprint, but not
for the '71.._dot_cause it's not even in the computer. Guess '71s were so cool
that they didn't even need a manual.

Kinda goofy situation, but if your yearnin' for a manual, might try.

Good idea Brian.

&gt;Looking for that owners manual that the PO forgot to put in the glove
&gt;box...didn't have one...lost yours?
&gt;
&gt;Just call VW-America at 1-800-544-8021, if its still available they will
&gt;gladly sent it to you.  I just got off the phone with them and have a 82
&gt;Vanagon owners manual on its way.  Cost me $10, but hey, its worth it.
