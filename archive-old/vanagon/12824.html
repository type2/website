Subject:       WonderBread Bus

Joel (who else) asked:
&gt; ok. now ... does the twist-tie go in front? or in back? :)
&gt; 
&gt; and do you think Wonder Bread would sue us??
&gt; 

the twist tie would go in back, yeah... definately in back.  more 
aerodynamic.  and probably reduce fluttering to a degree.  i know 
this is just a sticker but details ARE important.  then again, we 
could have a twist-tie at BOTH ends so it could go either way (cough, 
cough)  :)

the question I have is,  Is White Bread Politically Correct?  maybe 
it should be whole wheat or a '7-grain' to accomodate all.
