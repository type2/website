    Hi all,
    
        Well I finally got round to replacing the gearbox in my '71 
bus. Thanks to everyone who responded with advice last week, it was 
appreciated. It may have taken me something like 15 hours, (most of 
it spent sitting scratching my head wondering where that last bolt 
holding the engine in was, or just how are you meant to get those 
studs out holding the driveshaft to the gearbox when the splines are 
all rounded off) and I may be covered in scratches and bruises but I 
finally managed to change it all over, and it works! Previous to this 
the most ambitious thing I had attempted was probably bleeding the 
brakes or setting the valve clearances so I am now feeling pretty 
pleased with my self. Once again thanks to everyone who offered 
advice, and to everyone else who on the list from whom I got the 
inspiration to 'have a go at doing it myself'.  

                                Cheers Jon
