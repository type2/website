Subject: Winnebago EV camper impression


 

Last week my VW dealer had 4 Winnebago converted Eurovans on the lot so
Janice and I went down and looked but did not test drive.

negatives:

Cost, $31,500 or so is damn expensive.

Ground clearance is nil, the gas/water/electric spigots are only a few
inches from the ground, most rough roads are out.

Only seats 4 people.

positives:

beds are quite nice, lots of storage, nice front captain's chairs, Norcold
fridge, nice sink, stove, and table, roomy, looks good inside and out, washing
station at rear, air conditioning, furnace, all the comforts of home!

The miniblinds are efficient but I think I still like curtains better.
(The back window still had a curtain.)  The side windows and screens look
like a good design.

Purty nice!

We decided we wanted one Winnebago EV and one 5-speed Cabriolet!!  Too
bad we didn't have the $50,000 dollars!!

Yow!
