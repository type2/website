Subject: eurovan camper testdrive...

Hi all.
  just got back from a quick trip to germany. had a lazy afternoon last
week, so i went down to our friendly local VW dealer to kick some tires. B4
i know it i'm testdriving the new transporter. is it called eurovan here ?
i'm not sure. the type i was testdriving was a camper called CALIFORNIA.
comes with various versions, incl. westfalia poptop. talking about power! it
had some sort of 2.5 or so l turbo diesel, 160 or so hp, takes off like a
gti, nice change of pace from my old 73 bus...i was quite impressed. no
leaking windshield here! incredible how well it handles. i totally liked it,
except there's a lot of plastic in the interior, not as rustic as the old
buses. less room to express your own personality, if you have
any...pricetag of the one i drove was around 50000 DM (about 36000 US $). i
also testdrove a smaller bus called SARAN (it can't be named after the
wrap, can it ???) or something like that but didn't like it very much...too
much like a car, you know what i mean ? incredibly fuel efficient though.
again i had a diesel version, and it gets almost 60 mpg!
  don't know if this is interesting to anyone, but i figured i let you know.
i also have a stack of pamphlets here about both buses (can i still call 'em
buses ???) from the dealer. might be interesting to see if they offer
different stuff here and in germany... of course they're in german. but they
have pretty pictures and technical data, plus you were gonna learn german
anyway some day, right ???
  ciao all,

            Gregor
