This weekend I tried the A/C and I noticed the engine didn't change
speed when the compressor supposedly kicks in. Sure enough, when the
A/C is switched on, the compressor clutch didn't engage.

   Drew I have the same problem In my 1986 Syncro. This weekend I
   will jump in to it, find the problem, and let you know what's
   going on.       IF you're there before me drop me a note
                   what you find.
