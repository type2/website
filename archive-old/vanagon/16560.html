&gt; If you're gonna come stateside, why not Moran St. park on Orcas. I know

&gt; The state parks may have a reservation system (I can't quite remember) that
&gt; we could utilize. Otherwise, maybe a couple of rigs could head out early on
&gt; a Friday to stake out a place.

Another good thing about this idea would be that it would make it easier 
for folks from Vancouver I to make it, I would think.  Do you have info 
on ferry frequency/times/costs from Anacortes and/or Sydney?

Anybody know if there is a central res system for sites in WA?

The San Juan Islands are real nice, and I'd love a ferry trip; however, 
if it makes it difficult (or $$$) to get to, maybe we should keep it on 
the mainland?  How about places up in the Cascades?  Anybody found any 
nice cheap/free sites in the mountains?  I know in BC, the forest service 
and forestry companies have built many small sites throughout the 
province.  Most of them require travel on gravel roads to get to them, 
but most can be reached with 2WD med-high ground clearance vehicles like 
busses/vanagons without a problem.  Queit, cheap (usu. free!), and often 
very scenic.

Might as well ask now: is everyone comfortable with gravel roads, or 
should we consider only paved road access sites?
