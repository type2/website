&gt;Got the co2 to pass, new O2 sensor and new seals for the injectors.  thanks

the
&gt;
&gt;catalytic converter and will cost $1000 if they do it, or they will take it 
&gt;Menicke who will do it for $190.  Why the difference and does this sound
like
&gt;
&gt;the right fix?

Find reason for &quot;Lean Mis Fire&quot;  Raising engine idle up to 1050rpm will help.
 Make sure engine is road driven warm before testing.  This is needed to
&quot;Light-up&quot; the Cat and not have residual junk in the engine and exhaust.
