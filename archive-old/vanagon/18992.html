Subject: wide tires on 71 bus
Date: Mon, 12 Jun 1995 15:18:17 -0400 (EDT)

I've noticed a few Q&amp;As about wheels and tires, so while we're on the 
subject...

I'm getting my 71 bus ready for exile to Dog Island, FL, and want to put 
the very widest possible tires on her to cope with the deep sand.  While 
I can rebuild an engine, I'm totally ignorant about tires.  I know that 
they are 14 inch rims (where's this measured, BTW?).  Should I get wider 
rims for wider tires, or do wider tires fit on stock rims? 

Should I get air shocks to raise her past the wheel wells and/or cut out 
the wheel wells.  The body will be history after a few years on Dog 
Island, anyway, so aesthetics are not important to me.

Perhaps of interest to this group: this small island (7x1 miles) is home 
to at least a dozen VW bus/vans (a clear majority over any other auto).  
They seem to be the perfect vehicle because they are good in sand and you 
can carry a lot of stuff from the ferry landing to your house (there's no
 bridge).
