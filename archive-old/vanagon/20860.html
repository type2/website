 &gt; Hi, i'm new to the service. Just wanted to know if any one was selling 
 &gt; or knew of a 23 or 21 window bus for sale? Preferably in the or around 
 &gt; the SF Bay area.

I know it's not the same but the Franklin Mint is selling what it calls a '27 
window' 1962 Classic Microbus.  It's only 95 pounds! (sterling; the ad came in 
a british magazine...)

Alas, it's only 7 1/8 inches long -- a lovely little white over red model.

Sorry, I'm still punchy from paying for the '84 vanagons new tranny.  (Yes, 
thanks for those who suggested less expensive reasons for the noise; I checked 
them all and it was the tranny after all Ow!)

Happy Friday.
