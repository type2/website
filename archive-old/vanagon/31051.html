Well... this sort of thing is outlawed in Hayward.  If you have a 
&quot;derelict&quot; vehicle they can compel you to prove it runs.  There was a 
case where a man had a couple cars in his back yard... and had been asked 
to prove they run or remove them.  After failing to comply, they came and 
towed them away.
