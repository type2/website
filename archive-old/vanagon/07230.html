&gt; Martha: if you tell me what the silver socket is on the dash of westies,
&gt; I'll tell you what that silver thing is on the outside of your van....DC -- 
I am almost convinced that there is a good possibility that that silver
socket is the plug for a seat heater, probably sold only in Canada.
VW does not know what that thing is, but it's in my 82 diesel and it sparks
if you accidently stick the key in it.
