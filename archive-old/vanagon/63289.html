&gt;While sitting inside a very stuffy vanagon during a torrential downpour at
&gt;O'Leno State Park Campout this past weekend, we were trying to determine
&gt;how to improve, increase, or modify ANYTHING to get some ventilation.

Awnings are wonderful for such situations. With the awning extended, you can
just open the sliding door for all the ventilation you need. And you can sit
outside as well.
