Frank,

I posted a story about replacing the exhaust on my 86 Synchro
at the end of April.

I had 100k on the original exhaust and it needed replacing. I also
had cracks in the exhaust headder so my mechanic looked into
replacing the whole system. As I recall, parts alone from the dealer
were over $2000. YIKES!

So another avenue had to be pursued.

He ended bead blasting the header, tig welding the small cracks
and using Walker components for the cat and exhaust. Much better
prices but it still expensive because there were a lot of hours
involved.

Good luck with finding a less expensive option for your exhaust.
