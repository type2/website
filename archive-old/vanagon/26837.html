Ok, I guess its time to weigh in on the cargo hauling issue...


When I moved last year, I filled the bus up with as much as would fit, only
leaving enuf space for me.  I has stuff poking out the sunroof,
and piled about 4' high on the roof rack.

The 40hp motor was on its last legs.  To boot, it wouldn't start, so we
had to pull start it with my friends '59, which wasn't up to the task in
1st, so it had to be done in reverse.  Quite a sight.

It took me 45 minutes to make a 2 1/2 mile trip.  I could not get enuf
speed to get out of second!

And lets not even talk about brakes (or lack thereof)
