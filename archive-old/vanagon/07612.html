Address ... I work for the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).
	[ha.osd_dot_mil]

I think I'm listed in the DC category.

	Work in DC (pentagon actually).
	Go to school in DC.

When I indicated the average for the trip, it included the time/distance 
for towing.

Considering what I did and that I had to cross the mountain range 
(interstates 68 &amp; 79), I was very happy to get 20 MPG.

I'm amazed by people who get on the &quot;Buy American&quot; kick when I can get this 
type of value from my Eurovan.

Then I see the things General Motors does, blatantly, to avoid 'doing the 
right thing' for their customers. ....

I could always buy a pickup with the side gas tank then have it blow up and 
kill me and my family.  But that would be okay since I supported the 
American economy and helped to keep American workers working on quality 
products for a grateful American consumer.
