&gt; 							    ... i was told the
&gt; noise was 'cavetation' ...like on a boat propeller. ??? 

 This is bullshit. Cavitation is caused by a pressure drop at the blade
which makes the water literally boil (albeit at low temperature). In a
pressurised, low circulation speed system this is unlikely in the extreme.

&gt;						      ...i figured it was just
&gt; the shaft wallowing around in the bushing.

 Far more plausible.

Cheers,
        W.
