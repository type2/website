&gt; could you please send me the # of the guy with the bus at the OR/CA
&gt; border area.  my brother will be passing through that area (by the coast)
&gt; within the next couple of days with my adventurewagen, and if it
&gt; worked out, i wouldn't mind having him at least salvaging the fridge and
&gt; stove, if they are comparable to yours.  (also, where exactly is the guy
&gt; at?)

I think I will just go ahead and post the info.  I don't think the guy
will mind.  The guys name is Tom Farrell at 707-487-3293.  It's an orange
74 Westy on the East side of Highway 101 in his front yard, along with
several other cars.  A bit South of the Oregon border.  Can't remember
how far.
 
&gt; thanks- and sorry about your excellent page being displaced (good thing
&gt; i checked it out thoroughly before)-glad you had a good trip

Good news - I have just signed onto an ISP that will let me have a web
page, so at least part of the page should be back in the next couple of
days.  I'll post when it's ready...
