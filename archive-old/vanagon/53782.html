&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; My 1st and 2nd speed front heater blower speeds have quit working.  Looking
&gt; at Bentley, the most likely reason seems to be the one common fan motor
&gt; resistor.  Nothing in Bentley says where this resistor is, but after a
&gt; quick look at the dash wiring, I conclude that this resistor is actually in
&gt; the fan housing.  From other posts on the list I see that this is not a
&gt; good thing because of the difficulty of access.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the wires that the resistors bridge are easy to access.  My first
&gt; thought was to just replace the resistor externally.  However, this
&gt; resistor must dissipate about 60 watts so cooling it or keeping it from
&gt; damaging other under dash stuff by its heat may be a problem.  So, it then
&gt; occurred to me that perhaps an electronic pulse width type speed control
&gt; might be a better idea since it would dissipate very little energy.  (I
&gt; believe that some cars use this technique, especially those with
&gt; continuously variable speed blowers.)
&gt; 
&gt; So my questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Am I correct about the resistor location?

NO, the resistors are located behind the driver's side headlights.
Remove the headlight assembly and look below toward the outside and
locate two large ceramic wrapped resistors.
