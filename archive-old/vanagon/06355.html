So how do the rest of you folks winterize your westie?  
I've seen foam window covers, propane catalytics, micro forced air furnaces,
lots of dogs and other schemes for winter camping.  I'm thinking of a ski
excursion with the syncro as bed and breakfast in such chilly places as
Sun Valley ID, Jackson WY, McCall ID, Bozeman MT, Driggs ID, etc etc.  So 
what's the recommendations for winter camping from some of you Westphilias that
have done such bold adventures and lived to write me about it?
