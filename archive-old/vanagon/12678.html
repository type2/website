Subject: Re: '87 Vanagon Radio ?

Here's a little radio I tip I stumbled across a few weeks ago...

VW has a factory exchange policy on radios that are not covered under waranty. 
The FM reception on our '91 Jetta AM/FM cassette degraded gradually over a 6 
month period, and I determined the problem was not with the antennae. I was 
talking with one of the service guys at the local dealership (Bob Lewis VW in 
San Jose), and he says, &quot;well for about 70 bucks you can get a new one&quot;. And 
that's what it cost, installed!

A possible avenue for you to check....

&gt; &gt;  I've got a problem with the security divice on my electronic radio 
&gt; &gt; cassette
&gt; &gt;&gt; in my '87 Vanagon.  It's the factory item.  The radio somehow came loose
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the dash mounting and the alarm went off....
&gt; 
&gt; Try replacing it with a new one.  I have three VW's now and two have been
&gt; retrofitted with VW's 'Heidleberg' radio. I pick these radios up at the
&gt; wreckers for about CA$150 and plug and play them into the dash.  It should
&gt; just plug in but if it doesn't it's not much of a problem. I replaced the
&gt; harness in my old GTI and 85 Westy with the VW plugs which I scavanged from
&gt; other wrecked A2 VW's. I find the Heidlebergs to be nice radios and all
&gt; have lasted well, easy to use.  Just an idea that's worked very well for
&gt; me, Bruce
