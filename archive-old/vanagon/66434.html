Subject:      Odometer Wheels Loose

My odometer stopped turning last week, and it appeared that the mileage
counter wheels were falling away from the face of the instrument panel on=

the right side (low digits). Sure enough when I removed the speedometer,
the axle the wheels turn on had fallen out of the plastic &quot;bearing&quot; on th=
e
right side. I was able to push the axle back through from the other side,=

but couldn't figure out how to make it stay. I put it back in the dash, a=
nd
sure enough it worked for about a mile before it fell out again.
I've searched the archives and haven't found an answer to this particular=

problem, any ideas on what holds it in place?
