&gt;Spam is an acronym for SPiced hAM.
&gt;
&gt;===============
&gt;That may well be, however I have it on very old and good authority (&quot;WWII&quot;
&gt;wisedom) that &quot;Spam is ham that failed it's physical&quot;


My Dad, an ex-Marine from the European theatre, said it was an acronym
for &quot;Specially Prepared hAM&quot;. But maybe that was just the only one he
felt he could tell his (at the time) 10-year-old son.
