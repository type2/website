Subject:  deep-cycle batteries for Vanagon


&gt;My Vanagon came with a deep-cycle gelled electrolyte battery that actually
&gt;fits nicely in the unmodified battery comparment. Unfortunately, I think
&gt;the battery is no longer manufactured in this size. The batterly was
&gt;manufactured by Sonnenschein (German import) and is model Prevailer DF75. I
&gt;did some research and learned that Sonnenschein was purchased by a US
&gt;company, East Penn Manufacturing Company Inc. Apparently, East Penn
&gt;discontinued manufacture of the European-sized batteries. If anyone wants
&gt;to research this further with East Penn, their phone number is
&gt;610.682.6361.

So I gave them a call 'cause I'm looking for a battery too.  They're closest
replacement is model #8GU1:

	7 3/4&quot; L x 5 1/8&quot; W x 7 1/4&quot; H
	215 CCA _at_ 0( F
	44 reserve amps _at_ 80( F

sounds OK.  She wouldn't give me a price because you have to buy from a
distributor.
Might have to try one out.
