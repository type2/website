Subject: 87: shift rod bushing modification
Date: Sat, 4 May 1996 09:09:22 -0700

Page 34.7a of the Bentley manual shows a modification made to the shift rod 
bushing at the tranny end of the shift rod. The modification adds two boots 
and a new improved bushing. Vanagons built after June 1987 include this 
change. My syncro was built before then and did not have the mod, so I 
decided to install it myself. It was cheap, relatively easy, and tightened 
up the shifting noticeably. The addition of the boots will keep the bushing 
greased for a much longer period too. Here are the required parts:

Qty	Part #			Desc		Price (ea)
2	251-711-167-F		boot		5.03
1	251-711-207-E		bushing		2.14
2	N-011-008-18		nut		0.44

The two nuts are required to position the bushing assembly 6.5 mm further 
forward to accomodate the additional boot. It's a pretty straight forward 
operation:

Put tranny in neutral.
Remove two bolts holding bushing assembly to gear carrier housing.
Shift rod is now free, drop it down to ground.
Remove pin holding &quot;socket&quot; at end of shift rod.
Remove bushing assembly.
Clean everything up, grease, and reassemble with new parts.

All told, took me about 1.5 hours.
