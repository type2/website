Subject: Re: steering spindle rebuild

&gt;What diameter should the bushings be bored
&gt;to prior to pressing them in.  The other option is to press them in after
&gt;they've been bored conservatively, buy a 24mm ream and hand ream them after
&gt;they have been pressed in.  Any insight would be appreaciated.

I did this repair early in my association with The Bozobus, without benefit
of a manual or knowing that the bushings had to be reamed.  I got the old
bushings out with a C-clamp and a piece of steel-stock that was hand filed
to an OD of less than the housing and more than the bushings...

After hammering the new pin in to the un-reamed bushings for awhile, it
dawned on me that something was amiss. After the '79 equivalent of a
&quot;DOH!&quot;, I used a brake honer (y'know - three-stoned-springy thing for wheel
cylinders) until the shaft fit.  It worked fine for the next 100k miles or
so... (I replaced the whole front end rather than fix the sloppy king pins
and broken torsion leaves.)

But, it would have been much nicer/easier with the correct reamer...
