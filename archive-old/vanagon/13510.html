Another cool WWW site, 

http://www.alldata.tsb_dot_com/

This list almost all Technical Service Bulletins for any
and I mean any car, hell even a friends, '79 Dodge Challenger,
quite a few listed for Vanagons of all years and all other 
VW's.  These people will give you 10 free minutes to download
complete bulletins then the price gets pretty steep, but still,
its an easy way to look and see what's available on you car, and
then you can take your free ones on something you really think
might help.
