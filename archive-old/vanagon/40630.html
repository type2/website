Subject: RE: VW Specialist Shop

Ric,

[Excuse me for being a bit behind.  I get the digest version].

&gt;I know of a VW Audi Volvo Specialist shop on a Coastal South Carolina resort
&gt;Island that is somewhat smaller and therefore more affordable.  It is

I would guess this is Hilton Head Island.  I live outside Savannah, Ga which
is about 1 hour away from HH.  Is this shop Auto Werks or is there another
place I don't know about?  I have not been on HH for several years but I do
see Auto Werks advertising in the local paper doing VW and Audi repairs.

&gt;This shop also has the reputation in the three towns that it serves as being
&gt;the best place anywhere to take your VW.  The steady clientele (about 700

Which three towns are you talking about?  It does not surprise me that this
shop gets a lot of Audis since there has not been one when the VW, Porsche
and Audi dealer in Savannah shut down several years ago.  There is now a
Izuzu/Hyundia?/VW dealer but we stay away from them unless we need to get
parts.

I take my vws to Boatwright and Sons VW Repair in Brunswick, Ga which is 
also 1 hr away from where I live.  They were the only place that would
replace the heads on our vanagon last year.  (We could have done it ourselves
but we did not have the time).
                                          
&gt;After five years of business, this shop has recently branched into the
&gt;lucrative Volvo repair market.  Several months of radio advertising have

That's not surprising since the only Volvo dealer in SE Ga is in Savannah
and their business has grown too.  The next dealer around is in Charleston,
SC or Jacksonville, Fl.

(BTW, I have worked on Volvos for years also.  Those cars are not hard
to work on.  They are just like swedish VWs. ;-)

&gt;south.  Did I mention that this is a resort Island?

Yes, you did.  Even the president stops by.  I guess people are willing to
pay to live there.  Just last  week they had the Heritage golf and Family 
cup tennis.  The local paper had stories about people staying there (some
traveling by boat) and how much money they spend.
