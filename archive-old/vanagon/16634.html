Subject: Fridge use

It was  a about 105 F near Blythe, AZ on I-10 sometime last year and
my wife was driving. I got thirsty and it was our first long-distance
trip with the 82 Westy. The AC was not working yet so it was very hot
in the van. I opened the fridge and got me a nice cold can of Coke which
was nestled near the ice cubes somewhere. Anyway, our windows were open 
so we had a nice wind coming inside. Naturally, when I opened the
fridge door, (I didn't realize this yet) all of the cold air got blown
out due to the wind from the windows. About 2 hours later, I tried to
get me another soda and it was WARM! The ice was now in the liquid state.
Is this normal for this kind of fridge? It took me the whole night to
cool up the fridge and one soda pop spoiled the fridge's purpose. Are
these fridges made to be opened ONLY once a day... when the van is
at a stop? How do you guys use this fridge? Is it better then to buy
one of those Igloo coolers that plug into the lighter socket?

---this is one disappointed dude
