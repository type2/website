You always have space for a small porta-potti.  I built a box to hold 
mine.  Others (Harry Yates, for example) have made a neato net-thing to 
hold in securely between the front seats.  You could even get a diesel 
model like Steve Johnson!

&gt; I'm
&gt; taking it cross-country this summer, and I want it to be functional for the
&gt; trip.  Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

You'll want a porta-potti.  And get a good one (like a Thetford).  It'll 
be the best $100.00 you spend for your trip--no more visits to gas 
station bathrooms where hanta virus is being cultured...
