Subject: westy auxillary battery set-up
Date: Sun, 5 Feb 1995 15:03:39 -0600 (CST)

I have an '81 westy and was thinking about a auxillary battery for 
camping. I have a auxillary heater, so this would come in handy as well 
as using the radio and lights etc. Is there anyone who has done this 
procedure who has an opinion? I went to JC Whitney and there set-ups do 
not accommodate a stock Bosch alternator. ---Steevo---
