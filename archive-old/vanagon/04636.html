Subject: Re: should YOU own a vw bus?  a test to tell you. :)

My Answers: CCCCCCCCCC

Someday I'll tell the story of the Bug I salvaged.  It had to be inspected,
and the idiot who did the inspection forgot to put the cotter pin back in
the left rear wheel.  Guess what happened on the highway ?

&gt;If you answered A to more than five questions, you should own a
&gt;Volvo.  Rush right out and buy one, preferably an 850, which after
&gt;all has front-wheel drive and is therefore more up-to-date.  Be sure
&gt;to ask the car sales person about what all the letters and numbers on
&gt;the tires mean; after all, it's the sales person's job to be completely
&gt;informed on every technical aspect of your car, right?

Never owned a Volvo, have you?  I own an '82 (who would ever pay retail,
when someone else pays the depreciation on one I buy used.).  You know, the
kind with the British side draft carb?  It runs every bit as well as the
neighbour's MGB...

B.T.W., Volvo owners on the Internet also call their vehicles bricks.  The
mailing list is called swedishbricks.  So I own two bricks.  I must admit
that the Vanagon looks a lot more like one.
