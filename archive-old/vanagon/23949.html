Subject: Westy Wanted


Hello everybody,
I've been standing on the side lines watching all the action for a while. 
 Man the E-Mail really piles up everyday from this list!!!  The reason I'm 
writing is to search for a Westy poptop camper in very good original 
condition (not weekenders).  I'm not looking for a nightmare on wheels, but 
something I can drive dependably with the family on vacations.  Air cooled, 
or water cooled, new or old, but I would prefer low mileage and a standard 
trans.  I'm in New Jersey, and would like to focus my attention on vehicles 
within a reasonable driving distance of this area.  Any leads would be much 
appreciated!!

Peter Jensen
