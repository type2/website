Lionel,
when i called up KEP, theman i talked to told me that if i got a subaru
engine(might just be 2.2l), they supply EVERYTHING(all the hardware) you
need to fit it in.

&gt; Here in the UK the 2.2l Subaru is hard to find, and being rare would cost
&gt; more to maintain. On the other hand I have been offered a Japanese import
&gt; 'low mileage' 2.0l for GB# 470 (apparently called EA82, years 1988 - 1992),
&gt; from an engine dealer in London who bought 400 of them 5 years ago. He only
&gt; has 8 left now.
&gt;
&gt; I don't mind 10% less power than the 2.2, but are there other
&gt; considerations such as size, shape and fit?
&gt;
&gt; What does my innovative but non-VW local mechanic need to do the
&gt; conversion, will just the engine be enough? Actually the 2.0l I am offered
&gt; is called a 'fully loaded runner', meaning it has some extra bits. What's
&gt; in the Kennedy Engineering kit?
