The new server WILL be back again eventually, but the date just gets more and
more future. (See http://www.vanagon_dot_com for an update).

To ease the stress on Chris, and provide me with the list (I never knew how
much I needed it) I'm starting up the lenti vanagon server again.

If you unsubscribed to listserv_at_gerry, you'll have to do it again.
If you subscribed to listserv_at_lenti, you're here and you know it.
Those who subscribed to listserv_at_gerry before gerry went down will miss out.

When the new list is up again, Chris and I will again merge the lists we have
and hopefully it'll stay running longer.

Hang in there all!
