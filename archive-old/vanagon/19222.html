Subject: Re: OX light

&gt;So what's the deal about the OX light coming on? Is it a way for VW and VW 
dealers to rip-us off some more, or does it really have a purpose. Mine has 
been on forever, and the one in the rabbit just came on, and don't seem to 
affect anything.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The light is switched on at 30,000 mile intervals on sigle wire O2 sensors
and 60,000 for three wire sensors.It indicates that you should have this 
sensor replaced,it is then reset.This sensor tells your fuel injection system
how to regulate the mixture for optimum mileage and performance.
