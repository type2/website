&gt; You'd also have to rewire the heater so that power is supplied without the

My gas heater does not require the ignition to be on to function.  I 
thought this was the case for all gas heaters.  Hmm, learn something 
every day!  I find it surprising that gas heaters would be wired through 
the ignition, since part of their appeal is for heating the camper when, 
well, camping.  I don't leave my keys in the ignition when I'm 
camping--don't know about the rest of you FREAKS out there...  :-)
