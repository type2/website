Subject: Gas heater Manual for mac available

Greetings all

I've scanned and OCR'ed one of my Bn 4 manuals and made an electronic
version of it--but only for the MAC.  Sorry.  Anyone willing to make a
cross-platform version? 

Anyway, the manual is Eberspacher's &quot;Technical description and installation
instructions&quot; and it covers a generic installation of the BN 4 (w/metering
fuel pump).

If anybody wants it, let me know and I e mail them a copy.

-Tom
