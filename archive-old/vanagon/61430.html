Remove the diff-lock cylinder and bracket.  Removing the right side drive 
shaft will make it easier but not necessary.  The starter should than be 
accessible with some difficulty.  Get a Bosch or beck Arnley rebuild as this 
job is too difficult to take chances.

I'm new to Vanagons....we just acquired an '87 Syncro GL this week.  The 
starter needs some work and I am eager to get at it.  Just one question:  
How do you remove the starter?  I don't have any repair manuals yet, and 
I worked for about 4 hours trying to remove the thing with no luck.  Any 
advice is much appreciatied. 

TIA,

Sean and Susan
