Subject: Q:spare.gas.tank


YOu know those collapsable water carriers that come in increments
of, say, 1, 2, and 5 gallons?  They are strong plastic (dunno which
kind of plastic), and have a handle, plus a spigot or spout with
an on or off selection. When not in use, they fold up into a nice,
flat thing to store for later.  

Anyway, does something like this exist for carrying gas?  If not,
would these work?  I don't have the need to to carry extra gas
often, or for long periods of time, just now and then to guard
against emergencies.
