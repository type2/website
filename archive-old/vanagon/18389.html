Subject: Re: oil galley's or galleries?

Ben,

I don't know about the English majors but the Engine majors call any long,
corridor-like oil passage a gallery. ( A galley can be anything from a place
to burn your beans to stick of type, with pirate ships and pretty girls
thrown in (although that's probably 'gally'). :-)

Is your 82 a Type IV engine?  If so, Volkswagen may have done the work for
you, at least in so far as adding a remote cooler.  You can obtain an adaptor
plate that bolts to your oil filter base.  The adaptor is threaded for
3/8&quot;NPT, allowing you to hang a cooler anywhere within reason.  The adaptors
may be had with or without a built-in thermostat; get the on with the
thermostat so as to use the external cooler only when your own is having
trouble keeping up with the heat load.  Run 1/2&quot; ID (AN8) Aeroquip
high-pressure hose; it's cheap insurance.

But if I've missed the point, or if you're bound and determined to drill and
tap something, you'll find enough How-To poop in Bill Fisher's &quot;How to Hotrod
VW Engines&quot;.  The tap you want is 3/8&quot; NPT  (National Pipe Thread), the
Never-Exceed depth (on late Type I &amp; III cases) is 1-1/2&quot;, the drill size is
37/64&quot; (9/16&quot; will work) and you install the fitting with sealant (try
Permatex) rather than tape.  In bugs and buses you'll need an angled fitting,
45 or 90 degrees, depending on the installation, and it can only 'point' to a
rather narrow arc in order to provide clearance for the hose.  That means
you'll have to hit the thread-in depth bang-on, you can't 'twist until tight'
on this one.  So use your fitting as a gauge, checking frequently as you tap
the bore.

It's best to do the drilling on a drill press, and with the case-half well
secured.  Magnesium alloy is 'sticky' and will grap on you.  Drills are
ground at a different angle for magnesium alloy; you probably won't have that
type so just be careful.  And don't smoke.  The magnesium swarf ignites
easily; clean it all up after drilling to prevent future surprises in the
shop.  (Boy, is that stuff bright!  No wonder they use it in flares.)
