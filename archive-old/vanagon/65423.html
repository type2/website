I have an '87 camper, '91 Carat, and now a '97 Eurovan VR6 Winn camper, and
had a '93 Eurovan MV - all owned since new.

Both the '87 and '91 were &quot;trouble-free&quot; for the first 100,000+ miles, except
for the engine-f.i. miss after highway cruising that has been blamed on a lot
of different causes. None of VW's fixes or recalls helped. Finally pinned it
to the air-flow meter internal &quot;wiper&quot; lubricant thickening with humidity and
causing poor contact. Cleaning it a few years ago cured both completely. Then
the head corrosion problems hit both after 100,000, but fix it right and it's
still a solid engine. Except for a failed ECU (not Bosch - OEM Triumph-Alder)
on the '87, all other problems have been fairly minor and similar between the
'87 &amp; '91.

The '93 EV wasn't quite ready for prime-time. Nice when new but
problem-plagued with intermittent electrical &amp; other problems. (This was an
automatic - and the trans was a problem even after replacement.)

The '97 EV VR6 has major improvements over the earlier EVs. Many problem areas
(see list on AC, etc problem reports) seem to have been &quot;addressed&quot; - but
we'll see if they've been &quot;cured.&quot;

For freeway cruising &amp; campground camping the '97 VR6 is our favorite. For
mountains, trails and back-country : go with a Vanagon.

The 1984 - 90 wasserboxers are nice to drive, but have cooling, head and
injector problems, and cost a lot to fix.  The 91 - 92 models have more
power and fewer problems.  The 93 and later Eurovans, according to someone in
the business, have lots of mechanical problems.  (My friend just got his with
very few Kms on it, and it's sure nice to drive.)  So.  Confirmation?
Arguments?  Recommendations?  Thanks in advance.
