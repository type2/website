Subject: diesel over heating?????

My first day on the road!!!!I've driven slower things just cant remember when???  
aNy way,,,,how hot on the temp guage should my 82 vanagon diesel register??

...it goes up just past the little redlight (about 1/2 way ) and stays...no 
matter if your sitting still or running down the road....when i replaced the 
engine i placed new thermostat and attemped to blead the radiator.

Am i running too hot...If so what do i try next???
