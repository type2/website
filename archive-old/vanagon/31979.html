Subject: Re: Fridge sight glass

&gt;interior end of the sight tube.  just rub the end of the sight tube vigorously 
&gt;on your jeans to clean and buff it.  

I recommend Brasso, on a soft cloth, not paper towel. works beautifully

&gt;
&gt;of course all this necessitates removing the fridge but you were 
&gt;going to get around to doing that anyway.
&gt;

That little sucker will come out into the fridge with some persistence and a 
pair of needle nosed pliers with 'toothy' jaws. Don't crack it though. Oh... 
duh deep scratches can be polished out too, ahem...  Tim
