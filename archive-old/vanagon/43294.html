Subject: '85 FI Questions

Well since everybody else has been in this act I'm
going to pose a real interesting one.  About 50% of
the time if I start the '85 and take off it runs great,
smooth incredible power a little teeny boggy miss
at idle.  Then after a half hour, hour, more? (it differs)
it will start missing horribly, not enough to stop you
or anything, but enough that a hill you once climbed
at 65 you now climb laboriously at 50 and may have to
shift to 3rd.  Now for the ultimate funny thing, if at
this point you shut the key off for a couple of seconds
then start her back up, POOF, all better just like new
this works about 3/4 of the time.  I's like something in
the FI resets and its all better, maybe a sensor incorrectly
grounded that starts floating relative to the computer and
saturates or something is my initial guess.  Any thoughts?
The other half of the time even from initial startup it will
be about half as missish as when it gets real bad, when it
starts like this the turn off technique is less likely to work.
To me BTW it seems as if something is effecting the ignition
system rather than the FI per say but who knows, feels like
it misses the way the '78 did before I figured out it was getting
no centrifugal advance on the distributor, like it suddenly is
running about 25 degrees or better behind proper advance.
This weekend I shall dissasemble, clean every connection
and every ground in an attempt to solve the problem, I know
that grounds are sort of sketchy in the system at the moment,
cause looking at the O2 sensor output, if I ground to the exhaust
I might get say 850 mV, to the case 250 mV, to the head 300 mV,
to the firewall 750 mV, so something is sort of fishy.  Anyway any
other particular suggestions of places to check will be appreciated.

John
