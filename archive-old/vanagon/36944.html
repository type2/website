Subject: RE:  Upper Ball Joints

Recently I crawled under the front of my 84 Vanagon and noticed 
to my dismay that the boots on the upper ball joints were split
again.  I've replaced the ball joints twice (with J.C. Whitney
ball joints at $14.95 each).  The joints don't fail - in fact 
they are in great shape, it seems that the rubber that is used
just won't handle -40 degrees F. and splits out after a Fairbanks
winter.  In the past I've tried to locate just the rubber seals -
but no luck.  Does any list member have any leads on where to 
purchase just the seals or a better joint (meaning one with better
seals) at a reasonable price.

Thanks,

Fred
84 Vanagons
