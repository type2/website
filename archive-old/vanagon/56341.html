&gt;Does anyone know if there are any good reasons which could justify buying
the
&gt;Bosch ignition wires.  If not, I would appreciate any suggestions you might
&gt;have concerning inexpensive wires which will fit a 1981 Vanagon Westy.

$22.35 for a set of Bosch wires is not expensive (price as of Jan 27, '97)
considering that they are the best to use based on the materials they use
verses the Brazilian variety.  Bosch uses quality USA Made Silicone wires
coupled with German Made Connectors and Seals and are just right for the high
heat the 2 Liter generates in the late Buses and Air Cooled Vanagons.  I've
never been able to get more than 6 months out of set of Brazilian wires.  I
currently have 2 1/2 years on a Bosch Set on my 80 Wanagon and they're just
as nice now as the day I installed 'em.

Not a Sales Pitch - Just Product Experience
