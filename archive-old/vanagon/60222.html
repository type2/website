Hi everyone, just thought that I would mention there is a company here in
the UK that does some excellent bike racks especially designed for the VW,
the one for the Vanagon is great! The company is called Fiamma and they
have a good reputation over here in the UK, although I haven't yet bought
their bike rack.

They also have an address in the the USA in Orlando, Florida where they
manufacture awnings. I don't know if they sell the bike racks over there
but it might be worth a call. If you go to
&lt;http://www.rvamerica_dot_com/fiamma/index.html&gt; you can find all the relevant
contact details.

Usual disclosures apply.

Regards, Ralph

&gt; &gt;I just have to mention that Paulchen racks are still available, and fit
&gt; &gt;beautifully onto the rear hatch.

&gt;      Wow.  Okay, I think that Ron wins the best bike rack award.
&gt; 
&gt;      Now, where in the States can I get one?
