&gt;I would drain it after the trip and check for metal, but have been told
&gt;that it's a real pain to get new fluid back in the unit, that you have to
&gt;&quot;pump it in&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Sound correct?

Yes, that's the best, but I used Castrol 80/90 oil which comes in a squeeze 
bottle with tip like a caulking tube. I added about 18&quot; of vinyl tubing and 
it worked fine. Not fun though, on your back, spilling oil periodically, 
while holding the bottle upside down in the wheel well. You need a 17mm 
Allen key to get out the plugs, screw 2 17 mm nuts really tightly together 
on a 17 mm bolt then use it with a wrench to turn the plug out.  Use the 
same thing to get the drain plug out, it IS a pain. tim s.
