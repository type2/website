Subject: Re:[f]Niners and Chargers! Whew!!!

So Steven&quot;I like to taunt David&quot;Johnson says:

&gt;Niners are going to kick the Chargers butts all over
&gt;the field on Jan. 29th.. :[ ]


Uhhh, didn't this already happen about a month and a half ago, IN San Diego?!
Been there, done that...

With apologies to any Bills fans amongst us, I'M JUST GLAD THE BUFFALO BILLS
ARE NOT IN THE super bowl!!!!!

Hmmm, I wonder if Doug Brien drives a Westy?.....
