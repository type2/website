&gt; 
&gt; &gt;with the driveshaft missing.  Can Tom or Derek or Jim or Harry or? think of 
&gt; 
&gt; nope, but I'd mark the flanges at each end to make sure it went back in the
&gt; same way, if possible.  Whazzup anyhow?  Knock wood I've been trouble free
&gt; in the drive shaft dept.  Just took of a front axle to find 4 of 6 holes in
&gt; the flange are beat, badly oval'd.  DPO!  bye, Tim

Sorry to misspell your name above.  I have a recurring vibration under power
only.  AND a clinky clanky sound from the coupled set (rdiff-dshaft-fdiff) 
that I can reproduce by rotating the dshaft by hand.  I imagine $$$plines
being worn in front or back since I can't feel any play in the ujoints or
the rubber (hardy) disk.

Has me fully bamboozled.
