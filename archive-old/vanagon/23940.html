&gt;&gt;I think my transmission is loose, as the back hops up and down when
&gt;&gt;I let off of the gas and am slowing down.  (It looks rather wierd
&gt;&gt;when it does it.)  I can also feel the stick shift move around a
&gt;&gt;little when this is happenening.

&gt;&gt;I suspect that the transmission is loose from the frame in the front.

     Yep. Sounds like you split the nose-cone mount on the tranny. I have
     never done one on the old split-case style trannies, so I don't know
     if you can cheat it in there without removing the engine. Maybe you
     should consider removing the engine anyways, and replace all three
     mounts. The tranny does not have to be removed, just unbolted and
     shifted around. Also, if the engine is out, that is the second-easiest
     way to change the swingaxle boots, if nesc. (Easiest is when the
     tranny is on a bench!)

     Have fun!
