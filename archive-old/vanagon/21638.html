Subject: Re: Favorite VW Junkyards

Thanks to cheeses_at_arn_dot_net for an interesting read on favorite junkyards...but 
it got me thinking about a junkyard in these parts.  It's called Averre's, 
I've never been to it.  It's in Longview, Washington, I think.

Anyone been there?

I heard they've got several hundred VW's of all kinds.  It's a couple-hour 
drive for me, but of course I'd go if someone who's been there already could 
relate their experience.

Or, is anyone on the list close to Longview/going to the area and want to drop 
by and report on it?
