Subject: Trip to Akron, SYNCRO parts from Erik O

Drove over to Akron Saturday (about 275 miles give or take) to pick 
up a white (sort of) sliding door from Erik O for the new '90.  The 
door is funny MONSTROUS orange, red, and yellow pin stripes and 
company logo, still the inside is pastel white and had the power lock 
bracket already in place, very desireable for me.  Erik got a GREAT 
deal on a syncro parter, and is being fairly reasonable in passing it 
on for parts for a fair profit.  If anybody needs something he had 
all the running gear, glass, a gorgeous brown interior that somebody 
has probably already grabbed, an A/C system, and other little stuff.  
Underneath it was prretty rusty though so don't expect little nick 
nacks like P/S lines.  Front doors nice, signals, etc still up for 
sale.  Erik was really cool, probably would have taken my personal 
check but I had brought cash.  If you need something give him a yell.
