&gt; Actually, mounting the 2nd tank isn't that hard, as the nuts are already

&gt; tank) in stock and can install it quick.

	Is this true of non-camper models?  I have and '85 Vanagon, which 
has no camping accessories at all, and I'd always thought that it would 
be convenient to have a tank mounted like the camper models.  Has anyone 
ever successfully done this?  How much do the tanks cost?  Is do-it-yourself 
installation possible to do safely?  Thanks for any help...
