Subject: Poptop Restoration in So. Cal.

Just a quick little info if for anyone who would like their poptop
to look new again.
I happened to find a place that does VW poptop restoration. I was 
searching for a place to have my BMW2002s engine rebuilt and
finally decided on a place.  When I took in the car I got to talking w/
the owner.  He told me that he too had a 2002 and also a 80 falia 
that he was restoring.  I told him about this list and discussions etc.
and he asked if I'd like to see it.  He had it in what I thought was a
garage off to the side which in fact turned out to be a garage for 
painting.  When he opened the doors first thing that caught my eye
was the top.  It was white and textured just like new.  I asked where he
had the top done and he said ' here, I do it'.  He had this garage built
just for doing VW poptops, no painting!  So if anyone is interested
the place is:
 
Canyon German Auto
Laguna Beach
The guys name is Brett
