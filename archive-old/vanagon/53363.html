 &gt;&gt; Why to trash the wheel covers?&lt;&lt;

 Helmut, meine freund, I hope you never see a Vega.  I pray that you remain
blissfully unaware of the Chevette and I hope you never meet my father in law,
an honest and hardworking man who finally walked back into the local Chevrolet
dealership, tossed the keys to his near-new pickup on the Service Manager's
desk and said &quot;You keep it - I don't want anymore to do with that sorry piece
of sh*t.&quot;

 In this holiday season, I hope that your VW/MBZ/Audi always runs fine and that
German drivers will never be subjected to the callous disregard American
automakers have toward their public.

 Merry Christmas, Helmut.



 My rims are hold by MBZ bolts, also I'm looking for 15&quot; MBZ rims.
 My cap of the expansion tank is made for MBZ. The Camper is
 powered by AUDI (hopefully it works soon).

 What I'm driving? VW Camper, MBZ, AUDI?

 Nothing of all, it's a brick, I got to feel it on every side wind
 and every pothole but I love it to go everytime and everywhere I
 want to, specially on long holiday trips. And therefore I like a
 brick. Who wants to ask which wheel covers I have?
