Subject: '76 camper bus jerks, misses, cuts out

Need some help here please :-)
        '76 bus has started to jerk and lurch while driving at normal
speeds and especially when accelerating.  Engine seems to cutout or miss
momentarily causing a jerky herky ride.  Barely lurched my way home
yesterday.
        I've replaced plugs, points, rotor, rotor cap and had the valves
adjusted.  Could it be fuel filter or somethin'?

Wayne
