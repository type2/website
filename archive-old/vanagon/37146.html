Subject: modified sine wave question.

Will the 'modified sine wave output' from the PCxxx series of 
inverters run 110v ac motors well, assuming amperage specs are 
acceptable?

specifically, i wish to install a hot water circulating pump into 
the heating circuit of my wasserboxer for increased heater output.  12v 
models are available but i could buy a 110v model AND an inverter 
cheaper than just buying the 12v one.

i have done this with a 12v Par Jabsco 'Centri Puppy' pump and was 
pleased with the result but the Jabsco pump seal didn't hold up to 
hot, pressurized anti-freeze.

all replies appreciated.
