Subject: Questions - 3M glue, &amp; engine shakes

1. What was the model of the 3M glue being discussed a while
   back to retack the wallpaper?  And where can I find it?

2. A few months ago the engine started 'shaking' when letting
   out the clutch  from a stop.  I usually immediately put back
   in  the clutch and rev the engine and then it's o.k.  The strange
   part is that it only seems to happen during the first mile or
   so.  Any thoughts?  I don't think it's engine mounts but
   possibly the transmisssion  warming up?  Clutch?
