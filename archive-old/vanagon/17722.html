Subject: Re: 71 bus question

&gt;Brother Muldoon can you spare some advice,
&gt;With every new nook and cranny I look in my recently purchased 71 bus, 
&gt;I'm finding major problems (brake system, suspension) :( .  The engine 
&gt;seems very good (now that I've put 009 distrib. and new carb) and is 
&gt;purring.  I must now consider perhaps keeping the engine and finding a 
&gt;new body for it.  What other years of bus will this engine fit into 
&gt;without major modification??  TIA!

SMILE when you see those problems!  They all have them, unless they been
fixzed.  They are um, 24 years old after all.  Really though, you could look
around somemore and see if you can find one that has a solid front end and a
good trans, CV joints, etc., but the forces of nature are not on your side.
There are at least thirty other volks here who approve of the 1971 bus.
Most of us I'm sure have replaced tie-rods, ball joints, steering gears,
CV's, brakes, etc. so that it is mostly rebuilt.  It's the hull itself that
needs to be sound.  

That engine should more or less fit back to 1955.  It doesn't fit any bus
foward of 1971.
