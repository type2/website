&gt;&gt;The VW mechanic I take by Golf and Vanagon to strongly recommends repacking
&gt;&gt;all CV joints every 30,000 miles, especially for the Vanagon.  He claims the
&gt;&gt;joints will last almost indefinitely when maintained at this interval,
&gt;&gt;providing a boot does not tear in the interim.
&gt;
&gt;sounds good to me. that fits right in with the two-year cycle of replacing
&gt;all the fluids. but why does he say 'especially for the Vanagon'?? why not
&gt;all buses? Inquiring Minds want to know! ;)

However, at $300 to repack at the dealer that works out to 1 cent per mile 
for a single maintenance item.  Compare to 5.5 cents per mile for gas (_at_ 
$1.10/gal. and 20 mpg) and 0.33 cents per mile for oil (_at_ $1.20/qt and $4.00 
for filter at 3000 mi. interval).  I find that outrageous.  I replaced 2 and 
repacked 2 at 50,000 mi. and haven't done anything since (now 120,000 mi.).  
It's more cost effective to let them fail.
