&gt;                                             
&gt;                                                                 Thanks,

Hi!

The CCCs are a bunch of VW Bus and Vanagon owners who get together and 
go camping several times a year. CCC used to stand for California 
Camping Crazies - but - since we just had Joel from Alabama and Dave 
from Texas drive all the way to Mammoth Lakes, CA. for our last one - 
maybe we'll have to consider changing our name!

:-)

We have all sorts of fun on these trips - great food - awesome company 
- musical jam sessions - and ALWAYS a butt kicker of a fire. Not to 
mention truly fine dog time and lately, super cool kid contacts.

Maybe you all can get it together and join us for a CCC Blow-out 
sometime!

:-)

could make her!)
