Subject: '52 Barndoor update

Hi everyone-
    This last Saturday I took the twelve hour trip upnorth, to pick up the
'52 barndoor.
The weather was suposed to be nasty, but it turned out to be ok for the most
part.
It was about 5:00 AM by the time we got to the guys house.  The bus was in
his shed, so I had to wait until 8:00 befor I could see it; besides, I needed
the sleep.  Man!  what a cool bus!  The cargo floor is very solid and the
engine compartment is rust free.  The rockers and jack points will need to be
replaced, as well as the front floors.  It had a headliner at some time, as
well as carpet, and a middle and rear seat.  It's also missing the shelf that
the spare tire sits on in the engine compartment.  Everything else is there.
      The guy I bought it from had only owned it a month.  He bought it from
a older man, who has a farm about four miles from his house.  Derek, the guy
I bought the bus from, took me to meet the guy.  He was very nice, and let us
check out his VW graveyard behind his barn.  I couldn't believe my eyes!
 There if front of me was a '56 panel van, five other split window buses,
three bay windows, one thing, one fastback, and a bunch of bugs.  I almost
had a heart attack when the old man (Ed) said I could take what ever parts I
needed.  I wanted to get back on the road, so I didn't have time to take
anything, but I asked him if I could come back in the summer to get any parts
I needed, and he said sure.  So I loaded up the Barndoor and headed home.
 What a great day! 
     By the way, all I could get out of the Ed was that he bought the bus
twenty years ago and used it on a road commision for ten years.  He then
parked it out behind his barn and forgot about it.  
                                                   Got to go,
                                                           Eric Stollsteimer
