&gt; Here's the stats:
&gt; 
&gt; '90 Syncro Camper
&gt; Titian Red
&gt; Differential Lock
&gt; 47K miles
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the killer... I saw the &quot;sale&quot; sticker on the side, so I walked
&gt; in and asked what his price was.  $24,500!!!  Derek Drew, don't die 
&gt; laughing at this absurd price.  The guy told me with a straight face
&gt; that people's mouths drop when they hear the price, or they just walk 
&gt; out without another word.  I just started laughing, until he said, very
&gt; seriously, &quot;Well, someone will pay that much.&quot;  
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly I'm afraid he's right.
&gt; 

	I don't follow why this is such an absurd price. I sold a '91
	2-wheeler Camper with 44K miles for $21K a few weeks ago. 

	I'd  expect to pay $2 &gt; 5K more for a 4-wheeler.
