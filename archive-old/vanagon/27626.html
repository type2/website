Subject: re:Heavy-duty, rear, permanent, rack question (answer?)

Richard wondered (tm) about adding swing out racks for the rear of his
bus.

The Trim Shop, and Wild Thing Parts, carry these racks for Things, I
can't imagine that the backs of busses are so much weaker than Things
that the carriers can't be modified, or something can't be fabricated
using them as a template.
Unfortunately I don't have their numbers, but they are advertised in the
VW rags, and they both will send you a catalog for free(can't beat that
with a stick).  You can refer to the drawings in the catalogs for ideas
if you decide on going the homade route.

Cheers,

David
