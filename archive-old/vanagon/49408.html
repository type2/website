When I read stories of miners in the Southwest a hundred years ago, or of
loggers
(lumberjacks to you East-Coasters) in the Northwest, I try to imagine myself
being in their position &amp; know fer sure I'd never make it  -  those were
*real* men...&amp; women too of course .... I have to wonder if our
grandchildren's generation will read the above and think &quot;WOW those guys
were really tough - just imagine going across deserts in metal boxes with
heaters turned on to cool their flaming fuel combustion engines !&quot;
