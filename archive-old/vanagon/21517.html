&gt;        Well, it turns out that we was stranded there 'cause his shift 
linkage
&gt;broke, so I offered him a ride home.  After the tow truck scooped his
&gt;car up (and gosh, they're _fast!_) I took him home.    In da bus, of 
course!
&gt;
&gt;        As we parted, while thanking me profusely, he gave me his card. 
 His
&gt;name is James Long - California_Superior_Court_Judge_ James Long!
&gt;Waddaya wanna bet my next ticket is &quot;on the house?&quot; :)


How many tickets do you expect to get in a VW bus? My only one was
on an  interstate freeway, downhill, through a construction zone! And I've
even gotten tickets on *bicycles*, for crying out loud!

But a little insurance is always a nice thing, I agree.  :^)
