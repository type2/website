I'll second this warning:

Here in California the smog checking started earlier than elsewhere and
is more vigorous than other states, or some I'm told.  Back in 1990 I
got a 73 whose original duel carbs had been replaced with a single carb
before I got it.  Two years after buying it I needed to get it smogged
and found out that they wouldn't touch it because the fuel delivery
system had been modified, it has to be stock or you'll never get it
smogged.

It's a worthwhile price to pay for clean air, these laws have really
made a terrific difference here in California--we all remember how bad
the air used to be here.  But the sad truth is that in the end only the
really well-taken-care-of machines can survive the smog laws, and a lot
of beautiful old bugs and busses will probably have to be scrapped.  So
love your machine and keep it stock, and she'll always bring you home...

&gt; &gt; &gt;I am looking for a conversion kit for a 1984 Westpahlia
&gt; (water-cooled)
&gt; &gt; &gt;to convert it from fuel injection to standard carburetion.  this
&gt; &gt; &gt;obviously requires a new manifold, hardware linkages and, of
&gt; course,
&gt; &gt; &gt;carburetors.
&gt; Thom et. al.,
&gt; Be careful, -very- careful in considering removing your EFI for carbs.
&gt; New EPA standards are being forced in from the Feds US wide (1991
&gt; Clean
&gt; Air Act) and are going to require that your van be smogged or at least
&gt; visually inspected. Carbs will not match the book on standard
&gt; equipment
&gt; and therefore you will not be able to pass inspection and register you
&gt; vehicle.
&gt; Here in Texas, our state is already coming into compliance with the
&gt; 1991
&gt; CAA and I have studied this -federal- program intently and one of the
&gt; main tenets is to get the old smoggers off the road. Period!
&gt; In fact the Chemical Plants, there are few around Houston, are allowed
&gt; to purchase smog credits from salvage yards that squeeze old smogger
&gt; cars. The title to your old vehicle now has smog-credit value to the
&gt; smog producing system (Chemical plants and industry in general) that
&gt; are
&gt; being bought and sold.
&gt; Keep your Vanagon as close to stock as possible and maintain the
&gt; system
&gt; or you could be in for a heartbreak later in getting everything back
&gt; to
&gt; stock. Believe me, when this happens, the govt. (EPA) wants you
&gt; heartbroken such that you will throw up your hands and send your
&gt; 'smogger' to the squeezer.
&gt; Keep it stock and Maintained!
