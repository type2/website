Subject: 2 (Two count em') trip requests
Date: Sat, 6 Aug 94 20:19:17 PDT

I just have two requests for the trip that I hope 
everyone addresses before they go on this long haul.

1) Please.....PLEASE! don't embark on this trip with tires
that are not up to it.  Start with tires with good deep tread
on all four wheels and one good spare that is properly inflated.


2) Please....PLEASE oh PLEASE! have your headlights on your
vehicle properly aimed.  The last thing I want is some bugger
in my rear with one of his headlights aimed directly at my
rear view mirror.    

I'm sure will have enough problems as it is without the 2 above
mentioned items.

Thank you,

Steven
