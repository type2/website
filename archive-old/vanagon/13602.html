Subject: RE: starter wire gauge

I had posted this earlier, but here goes again.

&gt;        While I was there, I was thinking about the size of the wires in 
german cars.  The size is given in mm squared cross sectional area of the 
wires.  I calculated the AWG size for the various wires in the VW:
&gt;area in mm^2                    AWG
&gt;------------------------------------------------
&gt;0.5                                     20
&gt;1.0                                     17
&gt;1.5                                     15~16
&gt;2.5                                     13
&gt;4.0                                     11
&gt;6.0 (generator)                     9
&gt;25 (starter~battery)              3   
&gt;
&gt;This is all interesting, because the generator wire is 6.0mm^2 or 9 gauge, 
and 10 guage will carry 30 amps, so that works out alright.  The other 
thing, is that all wire is commonly carried in even sizes, so don't go to 
the local FLAPS and ask for a bunch of 17 gauge wire.

Your'e looking at 10 or 8, I would use 8.
