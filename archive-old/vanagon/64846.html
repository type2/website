Subject:      Blown steering racks: read pls.

Hi all.

I went through this last year, just one replacement.  Here's the poop.

VW sells a seal kit, $180Cdn for all the seals to rebuild the rack.
BUT!!!

1) They do not sell the seals (3) to rebuild the input shaft region,
which is the valve body for the whole PS system.  The seals are likely
available in Europe, from an aftermarket supplier BUT!!!

2) The seals on the input shaft rotate inside the aluminium valve body
and move directly against the machined inner surface of the body.  The
seals wear down the aluminium body, and as they stiffen/wear out
themselves they leak across the valve region.  This kills the PS
working, and may or may not result in an external leak.

3) VW does not sell the valve body, either new or rebuilt as a separate
unit, only whole racks for $970Cdn.

4) only known fix, done in decent well equipped FACTORY is to overbore
the valve body then re-sleeve it with a stainless steel liner bored to
original size.  If you can get the seals, 'member!?

My rebuilt rack, literally mine since there were no cores/rebuilts
available, came in a factory box from MOOG, who have the ability to do
such a repair, and warranty it for a year.


I'd be screaming for my money back for the WCM rebuilt/seals, and get a
friendly mech/FLAPS to send in your rack to MOOG via whatever pathway it
takes.  Mine went FLAPS - regional distributer - MOOG. Cost $360Cdn
thanks to nice mechanic, (reg. $420) spring '96.  The VW dealer here has
failed 3-4 times to rebuild PS racks, said it wasn't worth the customer
relations so they would only use a VW rebuilt/new unit.


One final warning note:   If your rack comes back again, lift up the
shaft seal/cover around the input shaft and look for very very sticky
goop smeared in there.  This is a quick fix that buys some time, enough
to make you go away happy until the 'warranty' period is over.  Mine was
doctored like this before I sent it in, when the main rack seals all
blew. It had been gooped at least 2 years prior since it was fine when I
bought it.  Maybe the goop is good?   Tearing down a rack is no mean
feat BTW, not worth it as you will never fix it anyhow, BTDT and wasted
my time.

Hoope this helps.  I am now a big fan of manual steering BTW, simple is
good, even in a Syncro the steering effort isn't to outrageous.  Watch
the wheel kick backs when climbing rocks though! ouch.

Bye, Tim
