Subject: E-mail dead

    TO all,

      MY E-mail provider is in bad shape. I think someone gave
      there computer some drugs. I can no longer get mail!
      I can just imagine that everyone's mail to me has came back
      undeliverable!    Sorry, for asking questions that can't
      be answered!
