Subject: break ins, enough.

&gt;&gt;attention to sexual content of some sort (legs or whatever)? I think this 
&gt;&gt;&quot;policatically correct&quot; stuff gets old pretty fast.

Sorry, I don't mean to try to have a last word,but.............
Too true politically correct stuff can be taken to extreme. I don't want to
talk about this stuff. I want to talk about big loaves of bread rolling
down the highway. If you want to be politically correct, just treat
everyone they way you would wish to be treated. The golden rule rules.
 This list group is about helping each other.
 My original comment on &quot;terrorizing&quot; the woman in the parking spot was
merely meant to point out that I wouldn't have wanted this to happen to my
sister, wife or mom (my sister drove a '64 bus until someone hit it and it
was totaled). I'm sure the pin-up was meant just as a prank.

Okay? Enough? Let's go on.

Thanks to those who sent me notes on the PVC pipe for the heater by the
way, I put it in this afternoon and it's working great.
BTW, I parked next to another white '70 camper identical to mine when I
went to the farmer's market this morning. Very strange. I had to take a
picture.
