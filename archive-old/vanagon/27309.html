Subject: Re: Engine transplant

&gt;I have been told that the 5 cyl. Audi engines do not bolt up to the
&gt;Vanagon diesel bellhousing, but I haven't checked it out myself yet. The
&gt;rough part on this one, I guess, is all the new mounts and bellhousing or
&gt;transmission that would be needed.  I assume it would be a tight fit if
&gt;the South African 5 cyl. Vanagons have their engine covers raised, as 
&gt;someone mentioned before.  Maybe the engine could be lowered a bit instead. 

The &quot;SA&quot; vanagon that i saw was a weekender and it was a normal height as
far as i can remember, WE NEED MORE INFORMATION!!! AHHH!!
