Hello,

On my recent Spain and Portugal trip, I noticed that diesel cars made as 
much smoke as diesel trucks do in the US.  The diesel trucks made an 
incredible amount of smoke.

Sometimes the smell of diesel exhaust and 2 cycle oil from the mopeds and 
Vespas became nauseating in Spain.  In Portugal, it was mostly the diesel 
exhaust since there were few mopeds and the like.  Perhaps they were all 
run over by the very competitive auto and truck traffic.

Mike
