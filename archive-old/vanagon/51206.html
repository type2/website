TWIMC;
There are two separate coolant temp senders on our 85 and 86. One sends
data to the gauge and the other sends info to the computer. The gauge
sender has a ONE wire slide on connector where the computer's sensor has
a TWO wire push-on connector. The sensor for the computer(I use the term
loosely) had a blue plastic body. It was the cause of a hard starting
problem last winter with our 85 GL. 

To check it:
Reference graph page 24.32 in Bentley..
At zero degrees C the temp sensor should have read 5750 ohms (+/- 750
ohms) across it's two terminals. Mine was reading about half that (about
3000 ohms), hence telling to the computer the engine was 15 degrees C
warmer than it really was. The computer responded by LEANING out the
mixture so much that it could not start.
TMSAISWI(that's my story and I'm sticking with it)
Good Luck

&gt; Would the coolant temp sensor be the cause of the flashing red light on
&gt;the temp guage?
