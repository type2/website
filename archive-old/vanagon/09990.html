Subject: RE: East Coast Gathering

I will not be able to attend the gathering on GW's birthday after all.  Our 8th 
grade is going to an environmental camp on in South Carolina from 12 through 17 
Feb so the timing is bad for me.  (I am the administrator for those grade 
levels.)

I had hoped to link up with Dave or Don out of Atlanta and caravan but the 
timing is just too tight.  We won't be back until the wee hours of Friday 
morning :(
