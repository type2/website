&gt;&gt; You don't need to remove the axle nut to remove the half-shaft when doing 
&gt; &gt; CVJs.  Just remove the six allen bolts at either end of the shaft, and 
&gt; &gt; drop the shaft out.  
&gt;
&gt;This is good to know but I don't think they are Allen bolts.  I haven't
&gt;looked 
&gt;under my Vanagon to be sure, but if it's like my Jetta, they are 8mm 
&gt;&quot;triple-square&quot;, with 12-pointed star-shaped holes in the heads. These are
&gt;NOT 
&gt;Torx either, so don't get Torx drivers for them.  I believe they are called 
&gt;&quot;triple-square&quot; because the shape of the hole is like three small squares 
&gt;superimposed to make a star shape.

I just removed one of the rear axles from my 87 Syncro.  It definately had
Allen head bolts.  My 81 Rabbit Pickup had those funny 12 pointed bolt heads
you describe.
