Subject: Yeeehaw!!! (VERY little VW content)

Hi, all

I'd like to take this opportunity to waste
bandwidth and thank Gerry for firing up the
ol' list (again).  I too didn't know how
much I missed it 'til a couple weekends ago.

OK, for the gratuitous VW content, I'll have
you all know that I built a 150 sq. ft. add-
on next to my driveway this past weekend using 
the EV to haul pavers, sand, and other assorted
stuff from Home Despot back home (we're talking
heavy here, folks), and I'd swear the van 
didn't even look (or drive) like it was loaded
down.  Is this a great van, or what?!

OK, I'm glad we're all back and I look forward
to y'all's fine posts.

Norman
