Subject:      Troubleshooting Question

Hi all,

Now that I've completely refurbished my '86 Westy and purchased some
spare parts I unsure how to troubleshoot any problem that may arise.
Specifically, I have an intermittent (the worst kind) miss arise twice
in the past month. Therefore, I'd like to gather various responses from
the listees to the following questions:

1. How would you distinguish an ignition problem from a fuel problem?
2. If it's an ignition problem how would you decide it was the ECU
versus another component?

In case you have some thoughts on the intermittent miss, here's what the
problem is, what been done and spare parts on hand.

Problem
Intermittent miss usually after 20+ miles of driving at 60 mph or above,
usually starts out with a single miss then increasing miles later. Has
never standed me or caused car to stop altogether. However, it doesn't
make me any more confident it won't.

Items Replaced to date - NOT to fix the miss, but because it needed
replacing:
1. Installed GEX rebuilt 2L
2. Replaced fuel tank &amp; filter
3. Replaced starter, alternator, ignition wires, distributor cap, rotor,
plugs
4. OX2 sensor is disconnected and timimg advanced to 8-10 degrees

Spare Parts on hand
1. Fuel pump
2. Air Flow Meter
3. Ignition parts - plugs, cap &amp; rotor
4. Ignition Coil

Any response would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Denys
