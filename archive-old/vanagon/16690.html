&gt; Hi,   that area on my rad is plastic, the bleed screw is seated in a

&gt; one that has a brake bleed nipple in it, as soon as I can explain what I 
&gt; want clearly to the machinist. I want something that I can easily open, then 
&gt; slip some tubing onto, then bleed into a bottle. Space is at a premium in 
&gt; that area due to the support though. Let you know how it goes, probably 
&gt; others would want one too. tim s.

I forgot that the wasserboxer rads are plastic!? Maybe its an idea to find
an old diesel rad to rebuild and use.
BTW my bleeder is a brake bleed nipple thing. Why did VW switch to a bolt
on later Vanagons?
