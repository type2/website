&gt; I am trying to soak up any info possible from this list since I got my 
&gt; 1974 West about a month ago. I am rebuilding the engine for a trip to 
&gt; California this summer(from Florida). I would like to know if I should 
&gt; put on an external oil cooler. I have heard you don't need one if you 
&gt; have a doghouse oil cooler. My engine is a 1974 2000cc, do I have a 
&gt; doghouse oil cooler? Any help appreciated.

The doghouse shroud thing only applies to 71 and earlier busses.  You
should have a type IV engine in your 74, and there is no such thing as a
doghouse shroud for it that I know of.  Your stock cooler should be
fine, if everything else is working proplerly, and if you are careful
not to overheat it.  Spend your money on a goood set of gauges before
you go out and buy an external oil cooler.

-David (who still thinks an external cooler *may* be a good idea, but
		doesn't want to recommend it yet).
