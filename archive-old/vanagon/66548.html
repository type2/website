Subject:      '85 Westy shifting problem

Howdy!
        I am having difficulty in shifting into 1st gear of my '85 Westy with 88k
miles.  It seems to help if I push down slightly on the shift lever (sort
of like when going into reverse), otherwise I tend to get 3rd gear instead.
 Shifting into other gears is okay.  The previous owner apparently just got
used to it, but I would rather fix it and the Bentley manual doesn't seem
to address this problem directly.  Anybody have suggestions?   TIA!!
