kWell,
I've seen a VW industrial engine before.  It was at the King's Dominion
theme park in Virginia.  Was being used for the sky ride kinda thing --
cars run on a cable in the air through the park.  Dnon't know exaclty
what idt did (generator powering?) but I looked at it and d said
wow, a beelte tle engine!  Looked neat and had the stock
exhaust.

Weird,
Sean

&gt; 
&gt; I saw my first VW industrial engine this weekend.  It was from the early
&gt; '70s and had a crank-start pulley bolt.  Cool!  Other interesting features
&gt; were the magneto (Genuine VW made by vertex in switzerland) , the fanshroud
&gt; (no ports for the heater tubes and neat &quot;Volkswagen Industrial Engines&quot;
&gt; sticker) and the exhaust (two two-into-one pipes that exited straight up
&gt; into the area normally occupied by dual carbs--looked stock)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone got more info on these?
&gt; 
&gt; -Tom
