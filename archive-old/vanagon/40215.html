Subject: Short trip to Julian

Wanted to see what effects (if any) recent tinkering had wrought to the '76 
Campmobile, so I piled the (sleepy and cranky) wife and kid into their respective 
seats and off we went, climbing SLOWLY up steep grades -- although 40 mph is 
about the best I've done in the past up grades. Out through town, until we started 
seeing hills studded with huge rocks.

This attracts tailgaters, and this was the only unpleasant portion of the drive. 
Happily, except for the grade out of and later back in to Poway, the Campmobile 
zipped right along, I don't like to drive faster than 60, everyone else seems to 
like to drive at 90...

Many hills and curves, virtually all of it two-lane. Nothing too strenuous, but it 
sure is scenic. Stopped to let our 21 month old son, Flynn, run around and to let 
Diane smoke a cigarette (not allowed in the Campmobile).

This is a pretty drive, beautiful agricultural and horse properties, many (for 
southern California) trees and  many (for southern California) antique buildings 
in Julian, which is a very small town in the local mountains.

Diane ordered breakfast and I took Flynn out to run around. Breakfast was great, 
heaps of food, great coffee, a cranky baby who thinks we should be out exploring 
instead of eating. We decide to start putting duct tape in the diaper bag...

Walked around a few blocks and then down the main street (walking around with 
a little kid can take a long time, and you don't really look at much, but you do it 
*intently*). Heard only one VW engine while there. Nice place. Watched people 
making apple pies (Julian is known for its apples), admired buildings and flowers 
and trees. And chasing Flynn.

Finally corraled the kid in the car and started home. It seemed like an easier 
drive, very scenic. We got lost and stopped for a while. I changed Flynn and 
myself into some cooler clothes, and poured everybody some of the tasty 
Apple-Boysenberry cider we'd purchased in Julian. Not to mention the perfect 
height of the rear bed as a diaper changing platform. Such a useful vehicle! I like 
to kid Diane &quot;can you do this with the Maxima?&quot; She remains unconvinced.

Passed another bay window Westy  and we smiled and waved like crazy. Saw a 
few Vanagon Westys, no Eurovans. 

Got all the way home, oil temperature was good, performance was good... it just 
cruised along. Fun trip.
