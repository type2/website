&gt;&gt;appeared in the Auto-Trader.  The first one says &quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  I write 
&gt;&gt;&quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  He responds &quot;What makes it so rare?&quot;  How the hell do I 
&gt;
&gt;Calm down.  You were not being flamed!  We are merely commenting on
&gt;the claim of the advertiser that he has some rare item, which really 
isn't
&gt;so rare.   Its kinda like talking back to the TV (television, not 
transvestite-
&gt;dad would slap me for talking back)

Never thought I was being flamed and I think you miss the point of my 
resonse.  Go back to the original message where the request was made 
&quot;Does anyone know anyone that has a pre-62 double door panel for sale at 
a reasonable price.&quot;  I responded to that request with two ads I'd just 
seen that day in the Texas Auto-Trader (which I doubt is available in 
Minnesota).  The first vehicle is knocked because the owner thinks its 
rare and the second one because the wheel arches need to be replaced.  
The ad said nothing about only perfect restorations being considered or 
the owner must have the same definition of rarity that the other guy 
has.  The ads were not edited by me, I posted them just as they 
appeared.  If the guy has questions about why the vehicle is rare, the 
phone number is there so he can talk to the owner.  The same thing 
applies to the second vehicle,  I don't know for sure what the owner 
means by less motor (could be the engine is out and needs repair or 
could be its a 1200 which is less than a 1600 but then the ad should 
have read more motor):)  Nor do I know if new tranny means NOS, rebuilt 
or fresh from the wrecking yard. 
     Maybe these vehicles are a dime a dozen in some parts of the 
country but I've lived in the snow belt and know that any 1960 vehicle 
is hard to come by up there.  Texas does not use salt on the roads so 
most vehicles here are not the rust heaps seen in areas that use it.  My 
point is that if you are looking for a particular vehicle and someone 
gives you a lead on it, don't just give a flippant response knocking the 
leads, especially if the leads meet the criteria stated in your post.
