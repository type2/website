&gt; us much better, esp the BMW.  They run the engines dry? ech.  
 
	Walt, I've got to agree that its a waste, but the problem isn't
lawyers, per se. We, the people, sitting on juries and passing laws
and becoming judges, that is: making decisions, have created the system
we have. Lawyers are mouthpieces, advocates and potentially dispassionate
observers. Of course they piss people off. But half the lawyers
are on the loosing side EVERY TIME.
	I'll argue that infotainment TV, from 60 Minutes to Entertainment
Tonight, is actually evil, if scape-goats are wanted...
	But lots of companies won't sell damaged goods at any price-
some even destroy their R&amp;D prototypes after they finish getting loan-out
evaluations. MusicMan did this with some prototype electric bass guitars
about 15 years ago. On balance, this perogitive of property rights
is more a good thing than bad, I think.
