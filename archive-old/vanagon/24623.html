Subject: CV Joint Grease


I just replaced all four CV joints on my '79 bus.  Possibly the nastiest job
on the whole vehicle.  Got four new German &quot;racing&quot; CV joints, clamps,
German boots, grease, transmissiion, etc., from Transform.  Luftringe GMBH,
the manufacturer of the CV joints, recommended SWEPCO Moly 101 grease, which
is what Transform included with the order.  SWEPCO is made in Fort Worth,
among other places.  I guess it's good; it looks like the same stuff VW put
in there originally.  One tube was enough to lube all four new joints (after
washing them in mineral spirits, not gasoline, as recommended) and to pack
the old CV joints after cleaning (for use as spares).
