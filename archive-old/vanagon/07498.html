Subject: what is this device in my '72 Westy?


In the engine compartment of my '72 Westy there is a ~2.5 ft long
black cylinder, 5&quot; in diamter, with German writing all over it. It is
in the upper left corner of the compartment, with what looks like an
exhaust pipe dropping down thru the bottom of the compartment; on the
back end is a white plastic cap with its own tube running up the side
of the vehicle somewhere; a few wires running off it also.

A friend took a wild ass guess that it was for the outlet inside. If
not, how is 12V converted to [110v or 120v]?

Please cc: to jeffs_at_almaden.ibm_dot_com please, otherwise I won't see the
answer until Monday - in digest mode.
