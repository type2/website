Subject: 87 syncro: Dead #2 cylinder. Injector?


Hope all the vgoners had a happy Easter!

Recently, I started having injector problems with #2 cylinder (when looking 
in the engine compartment the one closest on the right).  The cylinder does 
not fire.  I'll start up, and drive--the vehicle will vibrate very much and 
no power.  Stop, pull #2 cylinder plug wire from distributor, no difference 
in engine.  Pull any other wire and engine gets noticebly rougher.  Put wire 
close to distributor and hear/see good spark and still no difference for #2. 
 Last month I put in new platinums.  Have swaped plugs on #2 with no change. 
 Compression is good in all cylinders.

This problem is intermittant.  Sometimes it'll go away and many times the 
van will start fine.  Once when i was out and the problem started, i ran a 
can of BG-44K thru the system and it cleared up--not sure if it was related.

I run full tanks of gas:  from F to almost E to keep accurate tracks on the 
mileage.  Could this make me prone to condensation and water accumulation in 
the fuel tank?  I've heard that water in and injector will cause vapor lock.

What could be the other reasons my injector is not working intermitantly? 
 Do they slowly degrade before going fully bad?

Thanks,
Fred
