     &gt;i am now that much more knowledgeable about the Dormobile operation. 
     &gt;I think what I like the most are the Westfalia interiors, but am

     &gt;actual roof opening is much wider. I imagine it would cost a few 
     &gt;bucks to send over all of that stuff! How much is a 1000 quidin terms 
     &gt;of American$. Is a quid worth the same as a pound or what? 
     
     Well quid is to pound as buck is to dolar. 
     
     Yep it would cost a few bob (wink, there's another bit of money slang) 
     to ship a Dormobile top over there. It would be better to ship a whole 
     bus over, then you'd get some spares too!
     
     &gt;BTW what would an Ambulance Spotlight/mirror go for in the UK?I am 
     &gt;looking for one like the one that was on the bus on the cover of the 
     &gt;November issue of Volksworld
     
     Well I've never seen one for sale so they must be pretty rare stuff. 
     I'd guess that if they are as rare as say early bus steering wheel 
     clocks (and I've seen them for sale) they go for about 100 quid 
     ($150).
