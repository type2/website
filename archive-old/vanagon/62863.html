Subject: 87 Synchro - too good to be true ?

Hello,

    I've found an 87 Synchro which is selling for $4200.  100K miles, nice
body, paint, etc.  Is this a good bargain or a sign of trouble ?  I've haven't
seen any 87's priced as low as this, and the fact that this is a Synchro (4WD)
makes me even more suspicious.

    Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of having a Synchro
rather than the 2WD version ?  I assume that there will be more maintenance
problems and less MPG, and since I don't plan to live in snow country for the
next few winters I wonder if I'll really need the 4WD (although it would be
nice in places like Baja California).

    Thanks in advance for any advice/comments/suggestions !
