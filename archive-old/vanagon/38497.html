	Ahhh... I was all set to reply that the L-Jetronic gets its impulse
from the low voltage coil wire, but then I saw that you have a 412.  The
Type IV in the bus used the L-Jet system, while the Type IV in the, um,
Type IV, used D-Jetronic.  The D-Jetronic does require a special distributor
with an extra pair of points in the base to tell the brain when to fire
the injectors.  D-Jetronic will not run with a 009.  Did the engine come
from a bus or from a 411/412?

	As an aside-- a fellow on the vintagvw list has spotted a complete
412 at his local junkyard (Nebraska).  If you're looking for some hard-to-
find parts for your wagon, I can dig up his email address for you.
