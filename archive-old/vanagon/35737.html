Subject: Type II hoses in the vents

On Feb 19th Bill Crick Wrote:

My 1976 type II has some approx 1/4&quot; OD tubing that runs up and back in the
cooling air intakes (the vents on the side of the body behind the side
windows). These have about 3/4&quot; x 6&quot; long 'swellings'  up in the
cooling air intakes. They come down into the engine compartment, and
turn into plastic tubing, join a T fitting just above the engine back door
hinges. The output of the T fitting has about 3&quot; of plastic tubing travelling
forward along the ceiling of the engine comparment. The end of this tubing is
melted, and there is no sign of the rest of this tubing? I don't know where the
other ends of these two 'loops' of tubing goes?
What are they? What do they do? I assume they are some part of a pollution
control? The van runs fine without them going anywhere?

Bill,
  If my memory serves, those hoses are vents from the gas tank. They run
from the tank, through those hoses then into a carcoal filter then into the
air filter.  Make sure that they are hooked up because gas fumes are
released from there, (BOOM) besides its good for the environment.  My
friend didn't have them hooked up and when the tank was full and the day
was hot, gas would leak out.  He didn't have a fire or anything bad like
that but it was inconvenent. There might be some reason they run into the
air intake vents, like cooling off the vapors or gas that run in there when
the fuel gets hot I'm not sure.  Hope this helps Take care.
