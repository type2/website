Subject: Re: My German Trip (NO VW STUFF)

To all who will make a trip to Germany in the future. 
Have a stay in BERLIN, no city in Germany is so intersting and exciting
at this time like Berlin. For example, the biggist building projekt in
europe at the Reichstag and the Potsdamer Platz, you can see more than
30 big cranes over a very grat area or at Saturday the 12 of July more
than 1 Mio. People from all over the world come to Berlin to have the
biggest party at the world the LOVEPARDE, and for the Fahrvergnuegen,
have a visit at the VW Showroom at -Unter den Linden (Street) in Berlin
Mitte-
