Information we got from Wouter, South Africa:

The number on the bellhousing Wouter's has (Audi 2.3 5 cyl to Vanagon 4
speed box) is BCY 301103. But the guys down at the local VW agents say
BCY 301107A is the right part. Special price, just for you :-) is R509,
ex VAT, so say R580-ish, so about =24150.

This bellhousing fits to every AUDI gasoline 5 Cylinder, Diesel I don't
know and is to be checked one time. I also know, that someone did a
conversion to the Rabbit or Jetta 2L. Also a conversion to the VW VR6 is
possible.

Are the T2 and T3 trannies of same kind? The T3 tranny will fit the Bug.

Hi All,

Just a quick question on the net knowledge of mating an Audi 5 cyl
(Turbo?) motor to a 68 &amp; newer TII tranny.  I know about the South African
use of Audi motors in Vanagons, but how does the engine mounting compare
with, say, a 1600 rabbit motor?  I saw a clean installation of a rabbit
motor in a 76 Bus at BBTA and Weddle Engineering sells Vanagon Diesel
bellhousings used for =2415 (I hope it's not a typo). Engine heighth is not=

a great concern, the vehicle's already ben butchered up quite a bit. 8-(

I have a pet project where I am hoping to H2o a previously air-headed
VW just for the heck of it.  I may go the 16v VW route, but the
possiblity of using an Audi 5 cyl intriguing, esp. a turbo motor.  8-)
