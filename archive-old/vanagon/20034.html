&gt; I'd like to point out that gasoline is a really good solvent and
&gt; sells for a mere $1.259 a gallon (at least it does here in San
&gt; Diego). Of course it is a little dangerous. Diesel fuel is a little
&gt; less flammable and is priced in the same ballpark.  I wonder if there
&gt; is something that could be mixed with gasoline to make it safe while
&gt; retaining its solvent properties.

ACK!   _DON'T_ use gas as a solvent!!!!

You can wind up with a layer of volatile fumes around yer bus...

all it takes in one bozo to arrive with a lit ciggy and.....

*BOOM!*

Try diesel fuel....  or foaming GUNK (brand) spray solvent.
