Subject:      Re: Sticking sliding door

&gt;My 84 has developed the annoying problem of during cold (as if it ever
&gt;gets cold in California) the leading edge (closest to the back of the van)
&gt;does not pop away from the door frame enabling the door to slid backwards.
&gt;As the outside temperature increases, this problem goes away.  I have been
...                   Anyone else had this problem.  If so is there a less
&gt;expensive way to purchase parts for the van without walking into the local
&gt;VW deal (who I have had bad experiences with in the past) with check book
&gt;in hand?

robert, (et al)
i had exactly the same problem with my 88 bus. it was crud and old grease
getting gummed up (i found out after i put a palm-sized dent in my door's
rear area). it also messes up trying to close when it's cold like that.

anyway, i got some grease cleaner and sprayed the p-loving-heck outa all
those mechanism parts back at the back of the door ... then sprayed it all
again with wd-40. and it has not done it again since ... that was 3 years
ago.

get some spray brake cleaner and some wd-40 and give it a shot. get the
door open a little bit and spray away.
