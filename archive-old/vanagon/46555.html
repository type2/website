Subject: 78 Fried Green Kombi--should I buy?

Howdy All,
A vw camper is for sale down the block from me. It's a 78 Automatic (it
says Kombi on the title), 120 CID. The body looks ok, with very little
rust, and the interior is in decent shape. Here is the
downside---apparently, the engine is toast, as it won't run at all. A
couple are selling it for their son, who went back to college, and they
want $600.00/obo. They don't know what the specific problem is, but their
son said he didn't want to pay to fix it.

Here's the huge question--what type of effort and money am I looking at if
I wanted to restore it (worst-case scenario-and, by the way, I am about as
mechanically inclined as my black lab, Gus), and what do fried campers go
for these days--is it a fair price for a vehicle with a blown engine?

Thanks alot for your help (and/or laughter)!
