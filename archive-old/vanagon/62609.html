your model, including, according to the cover,  &quot;U.S., Canadian and Import
Pick-Ups, Vans, RVs and 4-Wheel Drives through 1 Ton Models&quot;.  Or you may
wish to buy the book from Chilton, if it is still in stock.The Chilton Part
number is 7815.  Chilton is in Radnor (suburban Philadelphia) PA. 610-964-
4000.

Hello all, I'm trying to put together a set of reference books  for my 85 
Westy. I've bought the Bentley and yesterday looked at Muir's book for 
air-cooled VW's.
Would this book also be helpful for my wasserboxer? Also, Muir's book 
suggests getting his book on the Rabbit for later water-cooled Vanagons, 
however I was unable to find it.
Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks.....Harry (85 Westy)
