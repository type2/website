Subject: &quot;Bird Nest&quot; Air Filter

Just a hypothetical question...

What would be the effect on performance if the regular air filter in a 73
Westy was supplemented by an additional  &quot;medium sized bird nest including
a few baked feathers&quot; filter, underneath the pleated paper filter.

Was this a factory option, or was it more likely to have been installed by
the dealer?   Can I still get parts (twigs, wool) or will I have to replace
the entire &quot;bird nest&quot; as an assembly?
