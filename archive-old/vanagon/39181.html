Subject: Re: Appropriate VW musicians....

I'm amazed this hasn't surfaced:

I nominate Arlo Guthrie for mention in the vw musician 
hall of fame. I still have my tee-shirt with the little 
red microbus with the picks and shovels and there's 
pictures with circles and arrows etc. etc.

Camper Van Bethoven?


I have one design I made in response to the Nascar mania 
that has hit the area: A '53' window sticker, with a 
drawing of Herbie. And the insignia:
National Association of Slow-A** Cars.. :)


I still want to find that sticker,
&quot;life moves a little slower behind a vw bus&quot;
... anyone?


Charlie &quot;Actually, the stickers holds the van together&quot;C
