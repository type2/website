Subject: 71 camper advice again

Hi-
I guess I should have said that the owner wants $400 for the Bus and that I
do own a welder and feel comfortable replacing the panels (did some on my
78) The reason that I am interested in this bus, besides the price, is that
my 78 is leaking oil and it is even rustier (even after replacing some
panels). The trans in the 78 is sometimes hard to get into gear (checked
the linkage and changed the oil, neither helped). Plus, I live in NJ where
rust free is very rare.Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks. :-)
