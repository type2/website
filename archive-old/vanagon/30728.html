Subject: f.i. or carburation?

I faced this problem myself with a '79 Cal bus.  The f.i. system was &quot;shot&quot;
-- I never learned the precise details, but the major problem was the
&quot;brain&quot; or computer ECU (electronic control unit), the black box near the
battery.  Maybe somebody tried to jump-start the bus and fried it, who
knows.  A brand new unit would've been very expensive ($600+), while a
reconditioned unit could _theoretically_ have been cheap ($200-300?), but
after waiting TWELVE WEEKS at the mechanic's shop and not finding one, he
and I both gave up and said &quot;screw it,&quot; and the mechanic pulled out all the
f.i. equipment (bad brain, injectors, sensors, etc.) and installed a single
Weber carb.  Total cost for the carb was $500 or so with labor (the carb
itself was only $350.)

Probs with carburation:
1. Late-model buses were designed for f.i., not carbs. This alone could
potentially create problems unforseen. Many people have not had unusual
problems in this area though.
2. Carb icing.  Without pre-heating, in cold weather you can have icing
problems.  My mechanic swore it wouldn't be a problem (here in Phoenix),
because of the climate and because the bus engine is so tightly packed away
inside the body. (A Bug would be different, he claimed.)  If you live in a
very cold climate, this could create problems.
3. Emissions.  A poorly-adjusted carb could make your bus fail emissions,
especially in California (where you're not even ALLOWED to convert from f.i.
back to carb!).  In other states this may not be a problem. Probably a
well-tuned engine will pass emissions (I haven't tried yet, I just got the
bus back today.)

Good point:
1. A carb is a lot easier for the average grease-monkey to fiddle with, even
an amateur... F.I. systems require special skills and tools (I've heard
horror stories from folks who've taken them to mechanics who didn't have a
clue how to fix 'em.)  Thus, if you travel a lot in the backcountry where
there are no V.W. specialists, or if you're travelling out of the country
(Mexico most likely), or if you like to get your hands on a carburator and
adjust it yourself with ordinary tools, it's a good bet.

I'll post another report on the the final cost was, with everything
included. I am not a happy camper, as you'll all find out.
