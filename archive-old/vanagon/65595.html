Hi Sean,

(that's my middle name! same spelling too :-)

Yeah, Kyle gave me a GREAT price, but he always does, doesn't overcharge on
S&amp;H either like some do. I was going to do the windshield deal like you
did, but after I called around it just didn't seem to make sense. Guess I
just got lucky :-) BTW, the company was called Triumph Glass. They have an
800 number so maybe they're national? Here it is: 800/452-7495

Another thing, how was your old seal? Mine was almost like new! In fact,
the installer told me to save it as it was still very pliable, about as
new. He thought it was definetly reusable. I went ahead and used the new
one anyway.

Maybe I'll just paint on that missing vw/Audi symbol ;-&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; FYI,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know it's not original VW glass, but today I'm having a new front
&gt; &gt; windshield installed for $145 on the '85 rustfalia. That includes
removing
&gt; &gt; the old cracked windshield, installing the new one and the price of the
&gt; &gt; windshield! I bought a new seal from Kyle Wade at Volksmotorsports for
&gt; &gt; $40!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good deal!  I didn't know Kyle had those seals for $40!  The best price
&gt; I've seen for them is $100.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From my local sources, the best price I could find for a new windshield
&gt; was $200, and I installed mine myself anyway.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, found a windshield for my '81 locally, used with a couple of very
&gt; &gt; &gt; small rock chips.  Came from a local junkyard/used parts house.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It came out of an early water-cooled Vanagon, and it is original VW
&gt; &gt; &gt; glass, as evidenced by the symbol on the lower left corner of the
glass.
&gt; &gt; &gt; My current cracked windshield is PPG.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It had a really crappy tint strip at the top, which was halfway off,
so
&gt; &gt; &gt; I scraped it off the rest of the way, it came off surprisingly easy,
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; even more surprising, the leftover adhesive wiped away with Windex.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The VA inspection sticker left some tough residue, tho, but a couple
&gt; &gt; &gt; squirts of WD-40 and that stuff practically dissolved!  I'm never
buying
&gt; &gt; &gt; Goo-Gone again, WD-40 works a ton better :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the price was OK, about $100 cheaper than new, so I'm happy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be installing it tomorrow, looks like a nice day for it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks to everyone for their help.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
