Subject: Hello...

Hi Joel.  Glad to have spoken to you yesterday.  Didn't get to meet 
you in person, but just talking to you gives a more &quot;real&quot; 
experience!  Sorry to have disconnected you on the phone.   I 
couldn't hear you properly with all the background noise and I 
thought you wanted me to say &quot;HI' to everyone for you... I was 
thinking of your phone bill.  So, sorry about that, Joel.

Must admit, everyone was pretty well pumped up, and really excited 
about the trip.  There was a bit of a problem with Eddie Hienz 
getting across the border (at least I think it was Eddie they were 
talking about).  Tobin was down at the border trying to get him 
across.  That's all I know so far.  It was a fun evening and the 
weather was superb.

Talk to you later,
Harry.
