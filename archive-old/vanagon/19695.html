Subject:      embarassing moments, part 2

loose cv joints. ha!

try changing all your fuel lines on your bus, struggling and grunting and
getting gasoline all over you and the bus ... then clean up, and crank it
up to test for leaks ...

and hear the sound of all three v-belts coming unglued as the rag you left
in the engine compartment (remember? you were soaking up the spillt gas
with it??) shreds itself and gets caught between the pulleys and the belts.
:(

for your enlightenment: when those belts get all wrapped around each other,
you know, it kinda messes them up a bit ... like, you kinda need to replace
them after pulling this stunt.

hint: ALWAYS carry spare v-belts!!!! (and the tools to change them!)
