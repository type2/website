Subject: 82 Tranny in an 83?

A friend of mine may have an 82 parts Vanagon available soon. I was 
curiuos if the 4-speed in it would fit in my 83 Wasserboxer. The 83 
crunches gears when shifting unless you really baby it and I thought this 
might be a cheap fix. Do you think it will fit without too much 
reengineering?
