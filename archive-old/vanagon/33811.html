Subject: ' 77 Automatic 7-pass?

Ok, first of all, forgive me for being a newbie. : ) That said, I've been
dying to get my hands on a breadbox-type bus for quite a while now, and
finally found one (that I can afford!). What I noticed about it (I haven't
driven it yet, I'm doing that tomorrow) is that it's an automatic. I didn't
realize that they came in an automatic version. Personally, I prefer a stick,
but my wife can't work the stick on a bus, so an automatic would be good for
her. What I'm worried about though, is am I in for a nightmare? Is it likely
that this is something the previous owner put in on his own? What should I be
on the lookout for? I'd love to get some advice from some folks who know a
little more about this than me (ok, so that's just about everyone!), but I'd
like to know quickly, since I'll be seeing it first thing tomorrow morning.
Thanks in advance.
