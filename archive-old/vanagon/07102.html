&gt; &gt;&gt; Who can solve this mystery? Why would a tight valve cause the EGR filter

&gt; &gt;I have no (factual) idea, but If you are willing to listen to me play in 
&gt; &gt;my mind.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would suspect that the tight valve (exhaust? {usually}) was never
&gt; &gt;getting completely seated.  This allowed a little gas/air mix out the
&gt; &gt;exhaust unburned.  The EGR filter caught the unburned mix (per its design
&gt; &gt;spec) and after a bit the amount of gas in the filter got to the point
&gt; &gt;where the hot gas from the other 3 cylinders ignited it and BOOM.  Am I
&gt; &gt;making sense?  I dunno?  Just thinking.... 
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a good theory to me! So good, I decided to forward it to the
&gt; group. Hope you didn't mind. 
&gt; 

Nope, as long as everyone understands this is just a thought, not experience.

&gt; &gt;&gt; (Did I tell you about the time three (3) things broke down
&gt; &gt;&gt; within one minute: Engine, turn signals, and steering? Those *were* related
&gt; &gt;&gt; and whoever guesses what the problem was gets to call him/herself Vanagon
&gt; &gt;&gt; Stud/Studette of the Week.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I am willing to bet on the wiring harness at the top of the steering 
&gt; &gt;column getting caught somehow, which would bind the steering wheel, as 
&gt; &gt;well as shorting the turn signals and engine circuits.  Am I a stud? 
&gt; &gt;(Expiring minds want to know!)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, you are awfully close! It's actually the plastic housing of the
&gt; ignition switch that cracked and eventually blocked the steering wheel.
&gt; Good thing the engine gave up just before that...
&gt; 
&gt; I hereby confer upon you the title of Herr Stud von Typ 2. Congratulations! 

Only because Joel was too busy stuffing himself with turkey. 
BTW, does this revise the old Roman motto to &quot;with it or in it&quot;?

&gt; PS: Any opinions on possible implications of sucking in fresh air instead
&gt; of inert gases through the EGR system?? Would I be running to lean, for
&gt; instance?

Sami, when I got my '78 the can was completely rusted out.  Failed
emission inspection.  After pricing a new one ($150), went junk-yarding
and found one.  In the interveneing 2 years, the replacement followed its
predecessor to rust heaven. Before going for inspection, I removed the
filter, cut off the flanges, and reattached the flanges sandwiching a
sheet of copper between the flange and the throttle body and likewise at
the exhaust.  The inspector noticed nothing and it remains so to this day. 
I, also, was a bit worried about the air at the top causing a lean-run
condition, though the FI control may be able to correct for it. The seal
at the bottom was for symmetry and noise control.  I got this &quot;thang&quot; 
about open holes in my engines.
