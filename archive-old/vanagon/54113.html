Subject: Brake Bleeding, here I go again
Date: 10 Jan 97 13:36:52 PST

Well, with the posts earlier this week about DOT 3 versus DOT 4 brake 
fluid, I checked what I had been using.  DOT 3 of course.

Well, with my record intact and my sanity not, I shall venture forth 
this weekend to again bleed my brake system.  We shall see if the 
advice from various listees shall penetrate my skull and result in a 
successful bleed job (of which I have had 100% failure).  I have 
gotten used to spongy brakes over the years, obviously.

And I just did the clutch, successfully too!  Why I can do clutches 
and not brakes is a mystery.  100% success with clutches.

Techniques this time:
Tubing from nipple, with check valve in it, into jar.
Crack nipple open and let gravity do it's thing.
Keep an eye out for the level and flow the stuff for awhile.
After building up a puddle in the jar, start pumping the pedal slowly.
Keep doing it for a long time.
Offer $ to 9 year old to pump pedal.
Keep doing it for a longer time.
Repeat on next nearest brake/clutch slave.
Repeat until lots and lots of DOT 4 have been used.
