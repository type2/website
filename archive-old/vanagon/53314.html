Hi Bob in Orlando:

Two Answers:

1)  Sure. All you have to do is unsubscribe from the water-cooled list and
resubscribe to the air-cooled list which exists elsewhere:

To unsubscribe from the list send E-Mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with
no subject and one line saying
UNSUBSCRIBE VANAGON

Folks interested in Air-Cooled VW Type 2s should join the type2 list:
send &quot;subscribe type2&quot; to majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com.

To send a message to the air cooled list, send it to Type2_at_primenet_dot_com

2) I'm not completely sure I understand this question, but I'll give you an
answer.  Maybe it's the one you are looking for.  O2 is the chemical compound
name for the stuff (well the most important portion of the stuff) you suck into
your lungs at the rate of about 15 liters a minute.  O1 would be ozone, the
stuff that is created when fluorocarbons released from aerosol cans combine
with O2.  Ozone is much lighter than O2, that's why it rises way up there and
floats. Hence the much touted ozone layer.  So maybe in that sense it is not a
condensed version, it's the run of the mill oxygen that we all enjoy so much.

Hope this helps.

Good luck with your water-impaired westy.  %~)

&gt; My Westy is air-cooled. Is there anyway you can direct only air-cooled
&gt; related posts to me?
&gt;
&gt; What is this 02? Is it a condensed version?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Bob in Orlando
