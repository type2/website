Subject: Muir Book buy

Hi all,
	On a recommendation from Joel I bought the Muir book.  31 buck 
though!  25 for book, 2 for tax and the rest is s&amp;h.  ouch.  I got it 
from Auto Bound.  So update the price from these guys in your little 
archive file.
	By the way, I was a little surprised to see at the top:  For Air 
Cooled VWs.  Yikes.  I have an 88 WC VW.  Is there a WC one or is this 
what I was supposed to buy?  Book looks pretty cool though...

later all,

Thad
