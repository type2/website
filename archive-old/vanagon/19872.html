_______________________________________________________________________________
I have recently seen an encouraging trend in VW service. My local dealer, Bob 
Lewis VW in San Jose, used to be really lousy IMHO. Over about the last 1-2 
years after buying a new '94 Golf I have had the following experience:

-Car is always ready on time
-Most parts are in stock
-They call me when the car is ready
-They call me after the service to make sure everythings still ok
-They have a &quot;preferred service program&quot; that gives you 10% off parts and
labor,
a free engine steam clean, and a free oil/filter change on your birthday.
-Last time, when I brought the car in for my 15k (warranty) service, they even 
washed the thing when I told them I never have time to.

Don't get me wrong, these guys still aren't perfect, and I have had to bring
the
car back 2 or 3 times to fix misc rattles, etc (I'm picky, but shouldn't you be

with a new car?). In fact, these problems are more VWoA's than the dealers.

    It's to VWoA's advantage to ensure that their dealers aren't ALL
    flakes -- if you're upset (or pleased!) with a dealer's performance,
    LET VWoA KNOW ABOUT IT!!! Probably get you on some nifty mailing
    list or other at the very least...
