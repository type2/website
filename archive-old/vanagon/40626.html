Subject:  1982 2l motor fs

i'm posting this to the list for my brother, as a few people were
interested, and as it currently sits in a friend's garage and he says it
needs to go.

2l air-cooled engine (NOT california model), complete with fi, less than
30,000 miles on rebuild, relatively new aftermarket exhaust included,
removed from an 82 in february, and needing mounts.  he'll take $350.

it is currently in pasadena, ca.  if interested, call jeremiah at (310)
455-1165.
