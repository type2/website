&gt; &gt;Bob,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I had the headgasket problem with my 85.  VW picked-up the cost of
&gt; &gt;parts to replace the gasket twice and finally the head.  If I can
&gt; &gt;find my receipts, I think we also cut a deal on the labor.  I only
&gt; &gt;paid a percentage.

&gt;
&gt; I've still got it with one side of my '85, when did VW 'honour' the warranty
&gt; on yours? Canadian warranty was 2 year/100,000 Km, long gone.  thanks tim s.
&gt;
&gt;

I know it was under 100K but think it was over two years.  I'll dig
out the paperwork tonight and give you specifics tomorrow.  I do
remember that it took a lot of phone time, getting the regional
service manager to visit the dealer and hours of conversation with
the service manager.  If I remember, it ended costing the original
service manager his job.  This was all back in 87 and unless I pull
the paperwork together I won't get it right.  More tomorrow.

Ted
