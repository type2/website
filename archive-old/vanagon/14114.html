&gt; &gt; is now how to heat the water (cuz I don't have 12 golf-car batteries
&gt; &gt; the way Schwarze suggests), so I'm toying with the idea of a snorkel

&gt; &gt; That way, we can fuel it with beer bottles and left-over circuit
&gt; &gt; boards!

&gt; Hey Martha, I have one of those Snorkel stoves! You know its not such a
&gt; crazy idea, just lugging the staves and hoops for the tub would be a chore!
&gt; 
&gt; What I have done, and works very well, is construct a teepee from found
&gt; poles and the ubiqitous plastic tarp. You then heat up some carefully
&gt; chosen rocks in the campfire and transport them (the &quot;fun&quot; part) to the
&gt; teepee, then pour water over the rock... instant sauna. I have placed
&gt; Achillea millefolium (whats the common name again?) under and over the
&gt; rocks for a nice herbal smell, in the desert, using sagebrush would be great.

Or.....you could use the Bradley method and use one match + 1 mother board +
magnesium and .....  WOOOOF!  

  Hey, where'd Martha go?    ;)
