On p. 248 of Idiot's manual, after removing the manifold side sections, 
it says to 'smoothe the insides of these two side pieces. They're pretty 
rough. Use emery ...'

What does this mean?  Why does it matter that the inside of the manifolds 
are rough... nothing but the air/fuel mixture goes through there?  How 
did it get rough anyway?  Guess I'm missing something here.  It must not 
be too critical since it can be done 'If there's somebody with nothing to 
do around...':).  Don't know many of those people these days.

Thanks to those of you who help us participate in a very valuable but 
underappreciated form of recycling.  It takes a lot from Mother Earth to 
build a new car, so the more we can keep on the road, the better.
