OK!

	Well, I was busy tonight!

	I got the rear bumper more straightened and rust free, and went
ahead and put it on to see what it would look like.  Looks good, but needs
some more work.

	Put in a new heater cable.  I bought the only model cable they
had, and it was about 2&quot; too short.  I engineered around that problem,
and now I have a heater again!
	
	I also tightened up the emergency brake, and now that works 
groovy too!

	I also found put on a new return spring for the carb, which has
both helped and hurt driveability.  Its better cause it doesn't race at
idle, but its also harder to push the accelerator pedal, and I have to
work the pedal more betwixt gears.  Oh well.  Now that I have a consistent
idle, I can also work on getting the air/fuel proper!
