Subject: Re: Model Busses

     David,
     
     I picked up one of those buses from a toy shop over here - diecast 
     metal base with plastic top half, and that weird sliding door.
     (a rarely chosen VW option on some late Micro buses)
     
     I can't remember the price exactly but it was only a few quid.
     
     I rang Franklin Mint last week coz I heard they were about to
     lauch a 23-window Delux. They said &quot;sure&quot; and they are sending 
     me a mail shot on the model. They said it would cost about 90 quid, 
     owch!
     
     I also know that Solido are launching a 1/12th (I think) scale 
     (9&quot; long) Kombi model in January '95 - can't wait, that'll be about
     20 quid - not so bad.
     
     Lee.
