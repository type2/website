The road reflectors are not only recessed (sp) below the surface, but they
also have two little metal arches on either side of them so as the snowplows
sort of &quot;ramp&quot; over them.  and as long as we are talking about disappearing
vehicles, did natural selection lend its migrational tendencies to the  Vega
as well?  I had one of these as my second car, I bought it for 35 bucks(my
1st was a '72 Fiat Spyder and go figure, I'm 6'6&quot;,  I had to wear my chuck
taylors all the time instead of my engineer boots because the pedals were so
close together, yes even closer than a Beetle).  Some of the El caminos
migrated to Southern IL,  I see quite a few of them around down here.

&gt;&gt;How do keep all those plastic reflectors imbedded in the roads from

&gt;Happy new year, Dan, I trust you had a pleasant stay in (somewhat) sunny
&gt;Cal....
&gt;
&gt;Seems to me those plastic road refelctors get scraped off just like anywhere
&gt;else,
&gt;(didn't you go to Lake Tahoe?) but I've noticed some of the newer reflectors
&gt;sit
&gt;below the level of the road surface, thereby escaping the long blade of the
&gt;plow.
