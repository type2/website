&gt;Likewise!  I have seen some of your posts and love your signature line.  
&gt;Nice to know
&gt;there are some of us girls out there in Vanagons.

I HAVE to tell my vanagon purchase story again.  I apologize to those on
the list who have heard it already.

I had been shopping around for a Vanagon for some time, with mixed results.
 None of the vans I looked at 'felt' right, and I wanted to find a van that
called to me.

I had heard from another Vanagon owner about Hoch Motors in Marin, which
specialized in Vanagon Westfalia campers.  I called up and arranged with
Roy to drive up (2 hours away) and see what he had on his lot.

On the way up I listened to KQED public radio, as I almost always do in the
Bay Area.  About when I was passing across the Golden Gate bridge, &quot;Car
Talk&quot; came onto the radio.  For some reason, I thought to myself &quot;I like
these guys.  If they talk about Vanagons, I'll listen to what they say.  If
they say they like Vanagons, it will be a sign that I should buy one.  If
they say bad things about Vanagons, I'll wait another six months and think
it over some more.&quot;

The second caller was a woman who said &quot;Hey guys.  I drive a van and I'm
worried about looking frumpy.&quot;  &quot;What type of van, asked the Guys.  &quot;A
Vanagon camper&quot;, she replied.
&quot;Whoa, no problem&quot;, they said.  &quot;A woman driving one of those Westfalias
automatically looks hip!&quot;

I bought my van.  And I love it.

Coyote
