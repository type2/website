Subject:      Brake pads

&gt; with 7 year old, water saturated brake fluid. They did manage to screw up
&gt; the rotors and put on the cheapest, smelliest brake pads I've ever seen,
&gt; but they wore out in 10K miles.

I've got 141k on my vanagon.  Still running the original brake pads, and
they are still about half there.  So, when 280k comes around, what
should I look for in brake pads?  Does everyone elses brake pads last as
long?  Always had to replace them sooner on my other cars.

Just wondering.

TBill
