&gt;  there is a noticeable
&gt;loss of power when driving up hills.  We need to downshift to keep up our
&gt;speed.  It doesn't run rough, it doesn't smoke, and on level roads we can
&gt;maintain 65 (we may just be paranoid, but there may also be less power on
the
&gt;highway also.). We know that we are talking about a VW Vanagon, but this is
a
&gt;new problem, as we said, it is noticeably different from driving it when we
&gt;first bought it.  The timing is right on, it's not burning oil, it idles and
&gt;runs smoothly, just loses power on hills.

Check out the catalytic converter.  It may be clogged or it started to melt
down.  Even a Syncro Westy should be able to travel at 70 to 75+ on level
road.  Check out the fuel system to make sure the O2 sensor circuit is
working properly.  Hope this helps,

Dennis.
