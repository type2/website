So William Abbott says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	All,
&gt; 	At least 1/2 the value of Muir, to me, was always Peter Aschwanden's
&gt; drawings. The Rabbit book is better, IMHO, than the air cooled book
&gt; for this simple reason alone.
&gt; 	Truth is, we'll need an ascii artist if we want to flood
&gt; the market... 
&gt;

I just love that picture of the guy wide awake in bed with all the engine
parts strewn out in his mind.

The Subura Idiot Guide is neat too.  It has cartoons of Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock
with halarious comments to each other.  I like the one where Spock is saying
to Kirk, &quot;What do you mean, did I remember to put the oil drain plug back in?&quot;
I gave this Guide to my in-laws that had a Subaru Brat at the time.


Happy Holidays to All!
