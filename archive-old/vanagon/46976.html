&gt; &gt;When I get back I'll tantalize/bore/upset you with yet another tale of Bus 
&gt; &gt;riches that are coming my way (hopefully to be concluded this evening).  
&gt; &gt;It has been a two year saga known as &quot;The Lost Treasure of Linden Lure&quot;.

I involves lots of windows and several free things.  That's all you get.  
Now go to bed...
