Subject: Re: What's up with this engine?


              1 - 138             3 - 110
              2 - 133             4 - 136

In three cylinders, compression is &quot;too high&quot; (out of the 100-130
range), and the fourth is really out of balance.  How should I
interpret these results?  What kind of work might this engine need?
------

you have a 78- 2 liter, right?

mine had 140psi, until i ran it down - the 100-130 range is for 1600 motors

whats up is #3 is getting weak.  25 psi less than the others?  yick.    Do
you have 2 k handy for a rebuild?  How cheap is the bus?   Id steer clear,
and find one without imminent engine work neccessary
