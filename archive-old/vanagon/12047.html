Subject: Westy Tent from heaven

Hello, fellow busriders!
Allow me to gloat for a moment if you will. Yesterday my wife walked
in the house with a large green bag and placed it at my feet. Knowing
that this is not a common event, and the fact that it was my birthday
left me to conclude it must be a birthday present.
It didn't take long to realize it was a nearly pristine westy tent, the
so called &quot;Big Top&quot; w/ blue top, yellow sides, grey floor, and red/blue
striped awning. Not only was this a fantastic suprise but the fact that it
was GIVEN to us by a friend who no longer owns a bus...well you can 
imagine my excitation! I haven't set up the poles yet (1st thing after
work) but I may have to consult one of those westy tent manuals that
were advertised on the list a few weeks ago. Are there any left?

Just wanted to share my farhfegneugen since I've got the bus. Can't
wait to go camping!!
