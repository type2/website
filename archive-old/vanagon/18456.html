Subject: Front shocks for a '71 bus

Hi folks-

I hope someone can shed some light here.  I'm trying to put some new
shocks on my bus (in this case, KYB Gas-A-Justs) and have encountered
some confusion. 

I mail-ordered new shocks all around and the rears went fine.  The
fronts that arrived claimed to be for bugs up to 65, but the supplier
claimed that they were also the right ones for the bus (I beleive
71-79 or some such).  Unfortunately, the sleeve in the lower end of
the shock will not fit over the stud on the bus.  The
currently-installed shocks don't have a sleeve on the lower end, just
the rubber bushing. 

I called the vendor again, and they suggested that I &quot;just pry the
sleeve out with a screwdriver.&quot;  No dice; they are bonded to the
bushing, and I chewed one up trying.  I called RMMW and they verified
that they sell the same shock for that application.  The KYB number is
KG4521, by the way.  

So; what gives?  Did VW change the shock mount in mid-71?  Is that
oversize stud on my bus really the old sleeve self-welded to the stud?
Anybody got any clues?  

Thanks for any insight,

-Mitch
