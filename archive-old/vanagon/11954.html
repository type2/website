Subject: [f] Does anyone else have this problem?


Well, our kids have the choice of using the '87 Vanagon or the '93
EV, and guess what: they almost always choose the '87.... (might have
something to do with the seating arrangement, though :-)   

BTW,  we put another 800 miles on the '87 this weekend, it's now got well over
104,000 miles on it.   Williamsburg was nice and not-so-crowded, we had a good
time....  How about organizing an eastern  get-together around Williamsburg,
VA for the labor day?
