     this sounds like a good deal to me if the remaining parts (like tranny 
     and drive train) are sound.  Kennedy Engineering (don't have their 
     phone number with me) can help with alternative engine ideas.  You 
     should be able to find their phone # in the archives.
     
     good luck

Hello,
     
I have the opportunity to purchase a very clean, nearly unused '83 
Westy,whose engine has been stolen, for a mere $400.   Is it possible to 
convert this to a different engine than a watercooled vw?  Would it be 
legal in California?  Any advice is welcome.  TIA.
     
Mark
