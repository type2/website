Subject: Re: looking to buy...in NJ

Hello,

I'm looking to buy a Vanagon, roughly a 1980-1990, my heart 
is not set on a specific year.

I'm in New Jersey but would be willing to travel to PA, NY, CT, RI, 
etc. to come see.

Anyone looking to sell? or Can anyone point me to a classified list 
where I could look? (apologies if this message is inappropriate here)

Reply post or private.

Thanks, 
Gregg
