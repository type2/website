&lt;&lt; Can I just repack them? &gt;&gt;

I've had good luck replacing the grease in my CV joints.  I had the familiar
Clack-Clack-Clack almost 2 years ago on a front/outer joint on my Syncro.  I
removed the old grease (while on the van, just by wiping it out - no solvent)
and pushed new grease into the joint.  I haven't heard a click out of it
since.  I've also done this on the rear joints on my 88 2WD.

I'd try this first before any replacement.  On an outer rear joint there's
really no way to get at the joint while it's installed.  Removing the whole
axle isn't a very big job though.  I'd guess that I could remove an axle,
clean out the old grease, install new grease and re-install the axle in about
3 hours.  The cost of the grease is only a few dollars too.

Good luck,
