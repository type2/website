Subject:      paint yer grills?

Can anyone recommend a suitable paint for the vanagon grills? I don't want it
to shine glossy like many I've seen. Also, does anyone know what the name of
the place in Michigan is that has rubber floor mats for vanagons that say
&quot;vanagon&quot; in white letters? I saw them in someones van at the last Buses by
the Arch and he told me the name of the company there and I have since
forgotten. He said they were about $30.00 total.
