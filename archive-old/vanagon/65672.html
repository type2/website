          P.S. Today I'm basking in the glow one feels after narowly

          one armed with a shotgun, wrestled with one younger and stronger
          than me for a gun.  I got the gun, he got shot.  If any of you
          out there do not own a firearm for self defence, WHAT ARE YOU
          WAITING FOR?!?

     Though I will not welcome the &quot;opportunity&quot;, Gaston Glock and I await
     anyone who attempts a similar crime in my presence.

     (Where do you live?  I am planning not to move there!  did they see
     your e-mail name and assume you had money?)
