Subject: grinding noise over speed bumps
Date: Thu, 26 Jan 1995 14:31:22 -0600 (CST)

I was somewhat in a hurry the other day (the St.Louis Blues were to play
against Vancouver), when I swooshed over a slight depression in the road,
forcing the bus onto its knees (Heee Haw!!). Since then, everytime I take
a speed bump, I hear this grinding noise (Knarren und Knirschen) from the
front left wheel well. Any ideas what part got damaged, if it requires
attention, and how much effort (time and money) it takes to fix the problem?

As always, thanks for your help!
