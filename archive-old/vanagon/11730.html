AND, for those of us who can remember the '60's, and like the &quot;Live At
Leeds&quot; version of &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, there will be a new CD issued this year
with MORE songs, and LONGER versions, from that concert.

There *IS* a reason to live!

Just got back from the Chicago Auto Show - humdrum VW display, though
they were showing the Eurovan Winnebago Camper, and a separate RV
dealer was showing the Winnebago Rialta.

More exciting than the VW display was the Audi display - it had a large
color chart, and one of the 1995 colors was &quot;Rubin Red&quot;.

I wonder how it would look with a flannel interior???
