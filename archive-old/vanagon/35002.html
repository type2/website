On Fri, 9 Feb 1996 Somebody said:
&gt;&gt;I find the best way to make my dealer believe I am serious is to paste 50
&gt;&gt;and 100 dollar bills to my forehead.  Boy, that really shows 'em who
&gt;&gt;means business!

so how do you keep the politicians and hookers from following you into the
dealership???
