&gt; &gt;GAS CAP   Every time I filled the tank I'd get gas fumes in the bus for
&gt; &gt;about the next hundred miles, especially when I turned a corner. ...
&gt; &gt;FUME PROBLEM   My mechanic replaced a short section of fuel line where it
&gt; &gt;bends in the rear air intake. That seemed to help somewhat but not
&gt; &gt;completely. He says the next thing to check is the filler neck. Anyone
&gt; &gt;have this problem and know a solution?

Same happened to me.  Gas started running out of my engine compartment
once when I filled it up on a hot day.  I plugged that puppy.

&gt; &gt;HEATER   OK, I've had my share of ice-box winter driving here around the
&gt; &gt;foothills of the Rockies. Anyone know of an effective non-smelly,
&gt; &gt;heat-producing solution? ...
&gt; 
&gt; the cheapest solution is to clean off the heat exchangers, fix any leaking
&gt; valve cover gaskets, and install an inline blower fan on the hot air tube
&gt; coming from the rear of the bus. that keeps the hot air flowing at idle
&gt; (like at red lights and stop signs) which is when the human needs it the
&gt; most.

Hear hear.  I did just that, except for the blower.  I took off my heat
exchangers and air pipes, had them hot-tanked, and changed my pushrod tube
seals.  Know what?  My heater *still* smells.  Just not as bad now.  :)

&gt; &gt;and now I'm told this is the weak link in the VW muffler and it costs
&gt; &gt;about $100 itself. Is this for real?

You can get whole new muffler assemblies for the bus from J.C Whitney for
about $60.  For that price, could they *not* be worth it?  Haven't ever
ordered one, though.  Come to think of it, they may only be for 72-74
busses.  DOH.  I'll have to look that one up.  The last catalog they were
even on sale, though.
