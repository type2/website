Wiring assembly and capacitor will not solve your problem, that's for a
different problem involving intermitten missing, not bad idle.

You've nailed it here probably, corrosion at contacts is your most
likely candidate.  Look especially at your grounds.  At the battery,
inspect and clean the ground bolt that goes through the frame, the
underside can get mighty yucked up as it's exposed to the elements. 
There's another ground at the transmission that a number of people have
just flat out replaced because of corrosion.

Sitting isn't too good for rubber items either.  Look at your vacuum
lines and the rubber connections.  You can replace all of it for under
$2.  And a small vacuum leak would cause your idling problems.  A larger
one would cause you to stall at idle with a general loss of power under
load.  The rubber doesn't have to look visibly defective to be having a
small leak.

Gee, wouldn't it be nice if $2 and some good ol' elbow grease cleaning
those contacts would solve everything?  If nothing else, it's worth a
try and probably worthwhile anyway.

Good luck,
