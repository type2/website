&gt;&gt;Our trip around the US in my recently purchased 82 Westy is taking shape.  We
&gt;&gt;plan on leaving Seattle on April 1, heading down through Oregon via Klamath
&gt;&gt;Lake, then west to Klamath and down 101 to SF and area.  Then were off to
&gt;&gt;Yosemite, across death valley to vegas!  &gt;&gt;

Are you planning to go across Yosemite via 120 to 395 and then go down
to death valley? I am not sure you can go through 120 in early April.
It might still remain closed. Call Yosemite national park service first.
Yeah, it's the most beautiful route through Sierra mountains. You definitely
want to go through it but you can't if it is not open.

The trip around states in 12 days? Boy, I don't think you want to leave
the Tioga Path (US120) without a day or 2 of camping there. You don't want
to pass by the Mono Lake without trying to swim in it. You don't want
to miss the June Loop (south to Mono Lake) in Spring time....

Just the Eastern Sierra will take you a week. So run your westy at 200MPH
for the rest of the trip. And don't visit me, you don't have time. 

Have fun.
