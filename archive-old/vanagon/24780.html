&gt;Run a ferret through your ventilation system every couple of
&gt;weeks!  Rodents are terrified of even traces of ferret smell.

&gt;I bet Bill Killian doesn't have mice or rats in any of his VW's
&gt;(since he uses them for toting hordes of ferrets).
&gt;
&gt;Let me know where you live--maybe I have a friend with a ferret
&gt;nearby.
