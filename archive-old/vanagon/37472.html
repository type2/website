&gt;Here is my situation, hopefully I can get some insight from some other 
&gt;members.  I have a dying engine in my '85, as well as a stuffed-up cat 
&gt;(converter, not pet.)  As we all know, I'm looking at big bucks here - 
&gt;Please no flames from the aircoolies.
&gt;
&gt;$2400 Longblock
&gt;$750 Labor
&gt;$800 Cat. Convert.
&gt;------------------
&gt;$3950 (plus other extras probably)
&gt;
&gt;Which option do I take.
&gt;
&gt;A) KEP Subaru Conversion Kit, (if it ever passes emissions)
&gt;
&gt;B)Above New Parts Route
&gt;
&gt;C) Used Complete 2.1 from newer vanagon/with full exhaust system, FI 
&gt;system
&gt;
&gt;D) Sell for parts, use money to create &quot;I was waterfooled&quot; foundation, 
&gt;serving the interest of prospective wasserboxer owners.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

That seems AWEFULLY expensive for a rebuild on a 1.9l.  800 for a Cat?  Wow!
I have an 85 westy that I think is the best thing since sliced bread.  I
would recommend either replacing with a used 2.1l or rebuilding your 1.9l.  I
would , however, find a cheaper way to rebuild the 1.9l.

I did my rebuild on my 1.9l for about $600.  Here is the general costs.
100       Shop time ($4/hr) 
240       Parts (main,rod,cam bearings; rings, oil pump, gasket sets)
  85       Machine service (mic&amp;polish crank &amp; cam,dip case)
  50       Service items (oil,filter,coolant, etc...)
125       Front exhaust pipe

Keep in mind, I did ALL labor myself, the shop was at a military base.  The
heads, valves, valve guides, etc, cam, crank and case were all in good
condition.  I didn't count the $85 for a Bentley's and about $100 in tools I
'needed'.

I found the engine to be easy to work on.  Once you remove the accessories,
the engine was almost as easy to work on as the air cooled.  It took me about
three weeks complete to do the job.  A week of evenings to remove and
dissasemble the engine, a week with parts at the machine shop and another
week to reassemble, install, tune and adjust.  I would not call it a
beginners job.

If you want the numbers of the parts house I used, I would be glad to post.

That was last summer.  I am now getting about 18mpg in the city and 21mpg on
the highway.
