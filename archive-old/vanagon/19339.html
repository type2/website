Well before we kill him I want to know the same thing for
antother reason, how about the Bus Boys adjusters for
the IRS beams?  I don't want to lower, I want to use em to raise
a sagging front and to allow for an adjustable front end
spring rate.  How is the quality and how hard the installation?

Oh, I've pulled front beams, the difficulty there is not my
question rather the actual involvement in cutting and welding
em in.
