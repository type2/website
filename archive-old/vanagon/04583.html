&gt;&gt;I had the same experience with the Continental tires - I (and my friends)
&gt;&gt;couldn't believe how little traction I had.  Got stuck on nearly level
&gt;&gt;grassy campsites too.
&gt;
&gt;i thought the lack of traction was due more to the wierdo torque curve of
&gt;the water-cooled engine ... cause i was getting stuck on the same michelin
&gt;tires that i never got stuck on in my air-cooled 80 model.

A friend in my VW club has a 89 camper and often gets stuck on wet 
campsites. The Split and Bay bus owners never have a problem and have had to 
tow him a couple of times (but only after a bit of merciless piss-taking). 
He's owned older buses and reckons its down to the extra power and more even 
weight distribution. Anyone else experienced this? My bus will happily drive 
through mud and water up to the bumpers (it rains a LOT in the north of 
England). I got stuck in snow once, but then so did a Range Rover which made 
me feel a bit less foolish.
