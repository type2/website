Subject: Rusty coolant pipes on '83.5 Westy

Well, it looks like the plumbing running from the engine to the radiatior
is ready for another set of pipes, which will be the third set.  They're
ready to break through, but only in one spot by the clamp holding them in
place near the engine.  Does anyone have a creative solution that would
avoid the $120 per pipe and $300 labor necessary to remove the gas tank
and install them.  Any rubber, plastic, copper, or aluminum off-the-shelf
products from the do-it-yourself, auto parts or marine supply store that
could be used just as effectively and WON'T RUST?  Apparently the post
'86 pipes are plastic, but require a great deal of extra fitting work and
enlarging of the frame openings through which they pass.

Please reply directly to me (or better, copy me with your answer to the
list so that all can learn) at cpaohio_at_juno_dot_com.  I haven't had the time
to keep up with the list, but I have cruised the archives, without
finding much.  

Thanks,
Brian Strange
