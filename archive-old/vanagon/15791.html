Subject: Cookstoves

Just got back from a week in Vegas (NAB 95) to face nearly 800 Vanagon-L
messages. Whoo Hoo!

BTW, saw a gorgeous 89-90 Wolfram Gray Syncro Westy there parked at the
Kinkos next to Chicago Joe's. Anyone, anyone???

Anyway, was reading all the discussions on stoves and had to pipe in about
my recent purchase. $40 bought me a Coleman aluminum stovetop oven. It's a
cool heavy duty collapsing unit that folds up to fit just dandy under the
rear seat. With a center rack and an oven-door thermometer, it's definitely
large enough to bake a full size pie, lasagne, chicken, etc.

The only downside to the unit - for those of us with late model Westys - is
that to fit it on the stovetop, one must re-mount the stove cover stand arm
slightly so that the stove cover stands in a more vertical position when
locked open - a five minute job.

Will let you all know how it works soon (will be spending a solo week in my
bus at snowboard camp at Mt. Bachelor Oregon, the first week in May).
