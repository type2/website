Subject:      Technical Service Bulletins ...

i got this out of The Family Handyman, Dec/Jan 96 issue:

&quot;HOW TO GET TSBs ...

Get in touch with
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
Technical Reference Division
Room 5110
400 Seventh St. S.W.
Washington, D.C.  20590

(202) 366-2768

Depending on the number of TSBs issued to date for your vehicle, it will
cost $20 to #40 to have them reproduced and mailed to you. You'll need
to send a written request, but first call to hear the recorded message
for instructions. &quot;

i haven't called yet, so i don't know what you get.
