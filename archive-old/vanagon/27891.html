Subject: Flywheel Locking tool

     Been looking for one of these things - - but no luck so far at usual 
     tool sources - - FLAPS, Sears, Tool King - -
     
     Don't really have room where I'm working to utilize long angle iron 
     per idiot book.  Anybody know where I might be able to get a locking 
     tool - - or am I going to have to fabricate one.
     
     please reply via E-mail to jonesl_at_tcplink.nrel_dot_gov and/or 
     rdyd26a_at_prodigy_dot_com - - as I am on digest mode.
     
     thanx in advance
