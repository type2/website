Subject: Fwd: The price of air conditioning

Sounds like a problem I had a few years ago.  It took an astute repair person
(not at VW dealer) to diagnose the problem and make the repair.   There is a
resister in the front end of the car somewhere that has something to do with
the speed with which the radiator and A/C consendor cooling fan runs.  On our
vehicle, the fan's low speed was not kicking on when the A/C was turned on,
so heat was building up in the system and was popping the valve on the
receiver/dryer before the high speed fan could kick. Might look for a
multiple tap dropping resistor in the A/C and fan circuits with one of the
loops open.

Vanagoners:

	Like the &quot;price of admiralty,&quot; it's high! Except for several recharges
and one switch problem, all was well until 1995. Following an engine
replacement (2/95 at 80K miles for the usual reasons) the A/C stopped
cooling the following winter. 
	While delaying repair because of cooler weather, the compressor &quot;froze
up&quot; in 1/96. I couldn't loosen the A/C assembly and the engine wouldn't
go. Had it towed to the dealer. Compressor (603), expansion valve (38),
receiver/dryer (163), belts, gaskets, fees, labor, tax: 1363.66!
	Within a month, the new (rebuilt) engine with 10-12 K miles on it blew
up. To make a long story just a little longer, fired the local dealer, had
it towed to Pete Moore Imports in Pensacola. Happy ending (development?)
sorta, VWoA footed bill for new engine if I would sink $1600 into complete
set of new cooling hoses.
	By late spring 96, wife has bought new Grand Caravan and the Vanagon is
mine to &quot;do whatever I want with it. She's into reliability, doesn't like
VWs any more! Thanks to this list, I become a fast learner.
	During trip to New Orleans, 10/96, pop off valve on receiver/drier must
have popped off. Noticed &quot;oily&quot; fluid spots on bumper and side moldings
and no cold air on the trip back to Mobile. New receiver/dryer (166),
expansion valve (81), vacuum/recharge (80), labor (155) at local A/C
shop.
	Just last week noticed that the high pressure hose leading out of the
compressor forward toward the condensor was leaking. Looked like a soaker
hose for about six inches, no obvious jets of a/c oil. 8 feet of new hose
(48,) vacuum/recharge (80,) labor (57.)
	Talked with a/c man; anytime you replace the dryer (after a failure, at
least) you need a new expansion valve. Why do the dryers fail? Pressure
relief so something else doesn't blow up, but then the question is, why
did the pressure rise? Honest answer: don't know. Unless something is
obviously amiss, more diagnostics often just mean more cost with often
(usually?!) no more answers. Car and van medicine resembles people
medicine!
	I've learned a lot about the Vanagon a/c system in the last few months,
not to mention other systems, but the tuition is killing me. Still, it's
wonderful technology when it works and in my climate almost a &quot;must have&quot;
option. Any words of wisdom (or encouragement) from the a/c mavens?
