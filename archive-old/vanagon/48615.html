Subject: bike rack for breadloafs--design

several people requested more information on my bike rack, so here it
is.  sorry, i cannot post a photo or anything since i do not have a home
page or scanner or anything.

it is really a simple design that i hope you canvisualise.
i will do my ascii best, however.



whole thing: ______|___|___________|___|__________|___|______

		     &amp;&amp;&amp;[]
		   ##&amp;&amp;&amp;[]##
little upright:    ##\\\\\##\\\  &lt;--bolt \\\
		   ##&amp;&amp;&amp;[]##   &lt;--nut ##
                     &amp;&amp;&amp;[]
         &amp;&amp;&amp; fork--&gt; &amp;&amp;&amp;[] &lt;--steel upright []
		      
		      	
ok, this is a view of it.  the lines are all 3/4&quot; X 1/4&quot; flat steel. 
the little upright ones are welded to the long piece.  each upright has
a hole in it with a nut welded to the back, so that the fork can be
clamped on with 2 bolts.  the long piece is inserted into the rain
gutter above the rear hatch, and bolted to it (yes, i drilled 2 small
holes in the rain gutter, but that could be avoided with a bit more
effort).

the rear wheels simply rest on the hatch and the bikes are stabilised by
bungees from the bumper.  they swing sideways for engine work, but the
rear hatch cannot be opened with them mounted.  remove the bikes,
however, and the hatch works fine, and the rack's presence is only
betrayed by the small uprights and their bolts.

i have thought of using commercial fork mounts (bike tight, etc), but
that would drive the cost up a lot.  further, the bolts are a lot more
secure and theft-deterring than a quick release.  i also have a cable
which i fabricated to string between the bikes.

there is no provision for front wheel mounting, but i just put them on
the roof rack of my westy.

i have been very pleased with this little gadget.  it is not as slick as
a thule or yakima rack, but it fits my van like it was made for it (it
WAS ;)  ), and it cost me a _lot_ less than one of the commercial racks.

i have another custom rack for my triumph--it is more elaborate, but
just as simple and elegant.  and _custom_ made for the car, not generic
and requiring adapters.

be advised that to build one of these yourself, you should have a good
deal of welding skill, a drill press, and a method of cutting steel
perfectly square.

good luck, everyone.
