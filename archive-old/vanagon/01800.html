&gt; I would be really p.o'd if I were flying IFR (I Follow Roads), and
&gt;I was passed underneath by a Corrado (Or even a ...FOX!)

ha! i started out taking flying lessons, back in the 60's, in a Piper J-3
Cub. as we cruised along away from the airport in Augusta, GA, the cars on
the four-lane below us were zooming off away from us. i figure we were doing
all of maybe 50 mph. :)

Low and Slow: the Only Way to Fly. :)

(no. i don't still do it. costs too much these days).
