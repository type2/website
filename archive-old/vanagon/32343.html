&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I need a little info regarding early bus window rubber.  I need to 
replace
&gt; one front windshield in both my '56 &amp; '67 busses.  Who makes the best 
rubber?
&gt;  Is it the same rubber for both busses?  TIA

rubber is the same for both busses (IMHO) the best rubber is from west 
coast metric
