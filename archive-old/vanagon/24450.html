     Be very happy you have a Microbus, and keep it that way!

     I know little, but think there are substantial differences between
     your vehicle and the Westfalias, especially the extra two windows
     you have and the fact that split Westies had a full across
     front seat, which you don't.

     If you really want a Westie, sell the Microbus (to someone on the
     list!) , take the cash and the cost of the Westie parts, and get the
     best Westie your dollars will buy.

     If you follow through on Option 2, you will have neither fish nor
     fowl; the Westie interior could be used by someone to restore a Westie
     that needs it, like the trashed one mentioned recently on
     rec.autos.vw.

     The grass may be greener on the other side of the fence, but a bird in
     the hand...I like your first option - back to the factory look!

To all those who have helped me with my '66 MicroBus (JT's Magic Bus
Project), I need your advice.

I am trying to figure out exactly what I want to do to this Bus.  It has
such great potential.

Original Plan, when I bought it before tallking with list members:

Hot Rod it!  Cal look, lower it, 1835cc with IRS conversion, custom paint
job, etc..

Option 1, after doing all the history search on the Bus:

Restore it back to the way it left from Germany in 1966, including
original paint (tizianrot &amp; beigehrau).  The only change from this would
be to put in a 1600cc dual-port.

Option 2, convert it to a Westy:

I found someone who has a complete Westfalia package from 1965 ready to
bolt in.  I would just need to find a pop-top.  Would also put in a
1600cc dual port.

I can't be decisive about this, they each have their strong and weak
points.  Suggestions PLEASE!!
