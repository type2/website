Subject: More '86 Info Please

Thanks to those who responded with information on 1986 Vanagon Models.  I'm
still left with a few questions though:

1.I've determined that there was an '86 Wolfsburg Edition.  Does anyone have
a 1986 Wolfsburg Limited Edition Brochure that describes the items that made
this model unique from other '86 Vanagons.  This information is also
contained in the May 1986 issue of the &quot;Weathervane&quot;, VW's dealer newspaper.
 If you have either of these sources, please help me out.

2. I still don't have the MSRP of the following items:
a. Automatic transmission
b. AM/FM cassette radio
c. Sunroof
d. Corduroy upholstery for Vanagon L model
e. Vanagon Camper Syncro
f. Vanagon GL Camper Syncro
g. Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition
h. Alloy wheels
i. Center bucket seat for Camper GL models (if this really was an option)

3. On the non-Syncro models, did the alloy wheel option include the 205/70R14
tires?

4. I still don't know which paint &amp; upholstery colors were available on which
models.  Can someone with a &quot;Color &amp; Upholstery Guide&quot; help?

All help is appreciated.
