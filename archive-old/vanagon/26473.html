&gt; couple of weeks ago.  I'd sign up for this one but would prefer going out to
&gt; Panamint, Death Valley, Saline Valley, etc.

No, it's only a replacement for Baja.  I plan on going to the Panamint 
thing as well.  Another choice for a Baja replacement is Lake Kaweah, at 
Horse Creek recreation area, or maybe something near San Luis Obisbo (SLO).
The problem with SLO is that it takes about 5 hours to get there from LA 
or the bay area... so it's not as handy as something off of 99.
