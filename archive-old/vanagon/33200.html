Subject: Re: Platinums/Address Update


Thanks to all for the Platinum experiences.  I'll probably switch next 
tune-up, and will report any noticeable differences (like how my head 
temp. sensor reads) as well as the more sublime (like the engine &quot;seems&quot; 
different, i.e. happy/sad).  

Also, for those who would send me e-mail, my address has changed:  I'm no 
longer at (smachopp_at_unm_dot_edu), now I'm at (jkhopp_at_unm_dot_edu).

Happy Motoring,
