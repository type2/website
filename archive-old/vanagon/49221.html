Subject: Radiator Fan

Hi Guys,
My 86 GL's radiator fan is only going on when it's time for the high speed.
Low speed is not going on at all, not even when the A/C is on.  I have
checked the 2nd stage relay (good) and the fuse (good).  I haven't made it
to the fan switch yet.

What else should I check and how do I check it.
