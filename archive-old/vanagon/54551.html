Subject: '82 2-Litre Heads for Carbs?

I have been offered an '82 2-litre motor that has been converted to a 
carb.  I haven't looked at the motor yet, but am wondering what mods or 
swaps might have been made to the heads to use a carb instead of the FI.

I'm thinking this might be a rebuildable motor to have ready when my 
current '81 (2-litre FI) gives it up.  The motor is not frozen and is $150.  

Good deal?
