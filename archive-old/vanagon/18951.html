Subject: [fs] 1968 Euro Bus (rare)


Here's something I picked out of the Albuquerque Tribune.  It seems to be 
rare, so if you're interested, call this guy, not me.  I _may_ have seen 
this one around town--I've seen a 68/69 Trans. with one Euro-taillight 
and _two_ little square windows on the door and sheet metal where my 
rearmost right window is.  A funky green color.  

Are these the same??  Who knows.  Anyway, here's the ad:

	1968 Bus, European style, rare metal dash, excel cond.  Less than 
	100 mi on rebuilt engine.  $2500 OBO.  (505)294-5581(505)238-5920  

JKH--Alburquerque, New Mexico
