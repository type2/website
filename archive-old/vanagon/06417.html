Make sure you are in a well ventilated area. Get some spray ether,
and spray all the connections in and about the manifold/fuel injection
throttle body. If you have a leak, the revs will go up immediately.

Also, do this while the engine is cool. Not that you will go up
in flames, but its better to be a bit cautious.
