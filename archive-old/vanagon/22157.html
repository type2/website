Subject: 40 years ago today...the millionth VW


Forty years ago today....August 5, 1955, the ONE MILLIONTH VW
rolled off of the assembly line at Wolfsburg. The Millionth
Beetle was painted gold, had a rose-colored brocade cloth
interior (the cloth was brought in from Paris). The plant
was shut down for a special celebration.

In the context of the times, one has to realize that just
10 years prior the plant, as well as most of Germany's
industrial base and economy, was in ruins, making this
part of what was referred to as &quot;Germany's Economic
Miracle&quot;.

The &quot;Millionth Beetle&quot; currently resides in the VW museum
in Wolfsburg.
