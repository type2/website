Subject:       Bus pays off at drive-in movie!

Ha ha, I knew that subject would get ya.

But seriously, me and a bunch of friends loaded up in the Pioneer and 
went to the last remaining drive-in theater in town to see the double 
feature James and the Giant Peach and Mr. Holland's Opus.

It was a lovely evening indeed.  We parked the bus backwards, unbolted 
the middle seat and threw it against the back of the bus.  I folded 
down the rear seat and laid down looking out the back hatch while the 
friends sat on the seat.

As the show was starting I noticed a baywindow drive in and park a 
little ways off.  During the intermission the owner came over.  

What luck, but it be a 21-year-old girl!  (Note: I am 22.)  Well she 
loved the bus, and I showed her all the nifty stuff and we talked 
_engines_ for a while!!  She had just bought her bus for $1100 (it 
was a '77 standard) and was quite nice (a lovely lima bean green)  
I could tell my arranged date (friend's girl-friends roomate) was not 
impressed!  But that was tough cause this VWgirl was RAD (and bonus: 
cute, too).

So finally it wasn't the Junior High kids pestering me...

I'll keep everyone posted.  =)

BTW, there is an immaculate Dark Red 21-window Deluxe in Mr. Hollands 
Opus.  The neighboring car got a chuckle when I yelled out when I saw 
it!
