Subject: 78 Hydraulic Lifters Clarification

Thank you for the clarificaction on the rods.  I have never seen the push
rods for the later models with the hydraulic lifters.  I was lead astray by
the Haynes manual on pg 209 para 57 &quot;[engines with hydraulic lifters] can be
identified by their solid steel push rods as opposed to the tubular aluminum
type fitted previously.&quot;

Obviously there is a difference.  My question is do I spend the money and buy
the rods for hydraulic lifters(made of solid stainless steel but still
hollow) or keep the ones I have now?

Thanks again

Todd
