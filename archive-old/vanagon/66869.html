Subject:      re Eurovan brake vibration

the vibration problem,  if it is not a severe abs pulse-like problem,
is probably just warped rotors as someone previously posted.  have had
this problem w/ everything from volvos to explorers if either the
prior brake job didn't include cutting the rotors (if they can be cut)
or the rotors need replacing.  my ev w/52k also vibrates (non abs) and
the prior owner just replaced the pads.  i will try cutting then move
on to replacing w/ cross drilled rotors.

&gt; &gt;My 95 Eurobago has developed a pulsation of the brake pedal
&gt; &gt;when applied at speeds above 50 mph;  feels like something is
&gt; &gt;out of balance between the pedal and the road.  My original
&gt; &gt;Goodyear tires have 20k miles, cann't see any uneven wear.
&gt; &gt;VW replaced the front brake rotors; this didn't change anything.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone had a similar problem, or know the cause of such
resonance?
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have seen many problems with ABS systems caused by Ferrous
particles stuck to the
&gt; magnetic ABS sensor at the wheel.  If too much ferrous material is
present the sensor will
&gt; not read the serrations on the wheel or CV joint and will tell The
ABS computer that that
&gt; wheel is locked and must be pulsed (what you are feeling through the
pedal).  The ferrous
&gt; material comes from normal wear of the rotors.  I always clean the
sensors off with
&gt; compressed air when I have the wheels off of an ABS equipped vehicle
in my shop and this
&gt; avoids vague ABS malfunctions.
&gt;
&gt; Questions/comments?
