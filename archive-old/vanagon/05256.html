Subject: Cold Start
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 94 19:20:22 EDT

This morning, when I needed to rush off to Hull across the Ottawa river
and get there in 15 minutes, the westfalia would of course not start. It was
without a
doubt a weak battery. Given that the temps around here have been hovering
around the 0 celsius mark for the last few days (which is not that cold
really) and that I have not driven the Vanagon in about a week (I walk to
work) it is likely that the battery is either showing its age (3 year old
Interstate) which was exaggerated by the coldness or there is a slow
drain on the battery. Three questions - a) any experience with Interstate in
cold weather? b) is there a definite choice of battery/amps for cold weather?
and  c) would a head temp gauge and oil pressure gauge that are live (not
hooked up through the ignition) be a slow current drain?-- 

I am thinking of hooking up a permanent battery charger that would be
plugged in via the 120 v system or alternately hooking up a solar battery
charger to keep the amps up.......any ideas appreciated - DC

PS is jump starting an FI Vanagon ok?
