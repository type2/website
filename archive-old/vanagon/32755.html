&gt; Are Eurovans that bad?   :-)
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking to replace my '84 GTI with something bigger for
&gt; towing my sailplane trailer (only 1000 lb, but 26' long!).
&gt; Will a '93 work for this?  Any comments about special things
&gt; to look for in buying a used one?


I like my 93 EV just plain old fine.  I had a 1980 Westy, which I thought
handled pretty well compared to my 67 Microbus (never had a bubblewindow),
but the EV handles MUCH better than that.  I am often surprised on really
windy days to discover it's WIND that's keeping my steering wheel position
slightly off center for straight travel down the freeway.  You really have
to concentrate to actually identify the wind gusts.  I'd go for a 5-speed.
I've never driven the automatics, but a couple of VW friends test drove
them and felt they were too underpowered (I wonder if they had the switch
set to economy or sport, though?).  I think the torque rating (140ft-lbs
_at_2200rpm) is more important than the horsepower rating for that engine.
It's hard to believe it's only got 109HP when I take off from a stop.  I
can climb I-15 over the Cajon Pass in 5th gear with my fam of 4 and a
week's worth of camping gear.  It slows down to about 65 toward the summit,
but that's better than our Mitsubishi Montero with a 143HP 3.0liter V6 can
do by a tad.
