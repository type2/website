Subject: Help /w/ price for '64 Kombi
Date: Fri, 8 Apr 94 12:58:00 CDT

Hey all!

I have an opportunity to buy a 1964 Kombi, and I'd like to find out what
everyone thinks is a fair price it.

It's in pretty good shape.  The body is relatively rust free, with evidence of
some fiberglass around the underside of the corners of the main cargo area to
patch rust holes there.

The areas around the windows, inc windshield, look solid.

It was painted once, and the owner said the guy had it stripped down to metal.
I believe this as it is presently light grey, was orange, and I see no 
evidence of the original color, save for a couple of Phillips head screws in
the driver's door.

The interior's been gutted (almost no original interior left). It's not a
walk-through, and there's no middle seat, just the front benches and the
rearmost seat.

The engine is single port 1600 (rebuilt), and its been converted to 12v.
Owner says its got about 25000 on the rebuild.

Front end looks ok from underneath, but the drag link bushing needs replacing.
Might take it somewhere to have them check out the kingpind, as I replaced
these on my '64, and they're expensive. Steering box might also need replacing,
or at least adjusting.

It drives OK, but the shifter is sloppy and hard to get into second. I don't
know if this is the tranny or the shift bushing. Motor is kinda weak, but
Busses are heavy and its a single port. 

The guy's asking $1800, but has admitted that this is too much. I haven't made
an offer yet.

Please email responses to me at jwk1_at_cec.wustl_dot_edu

Thanks!
