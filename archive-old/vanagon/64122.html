The first thing I would do is a compression test, A leak down test would
be even better. This would point your troubleshooting efforts in the
right direction.

I would greatly appreciate any information/advice/next thing to do..../
that you Volks could give me regarding overheating problem.........I
might
also mention that I did notice a noticeable power loss when going up
hills....like having to shift into third or lower.......with the splittie
pushing the Vanagon practically up the hills. I know it's tune up time...
but what caused what?

Thanks greatly in advance.
