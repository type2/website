Subject: Re: Something off reec.autos.vw

I for one like the smaller groups--a little
more personal, far more focused for my interests,
and a volume of messages that's much easier to
handle.

In a huge list w/hundreds of messages coming
through I'd lose track of everything, get frustrated
and unsubscribe and then I'd lose Joel &amp; Martha &amp; Ric
and all my other cheap entertainment.  Not to mention
bus-oriented info.  I'm pretty fond of Vanagon...

Nowhere else have I seen such fine haiku, either.
