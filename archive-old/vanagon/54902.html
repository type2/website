Subject: '86 Caravelle sluggish cranking

An old thing, that I've learnt to live with, but rather wouldn't.
When I turn the key, the starter very hesitantly turns the engine 'till it
starts. When the battery is newly charged and the engine is cold, then it
sometimes cranks as I would like it to, but that is not very often.

Yes, I have changed the battery, and the charging regulator. With the
absolutely fresh battery, the cranking was good for a couple of days. Then
back to normal.

Yes, I did check and clean the connections all the way from the battery to
the starter, even the braid from chassis to transmission.

Yes, I do change the oil, and do use a high quality synthetic 5W-50.

No, I have not pulled out the starter and taken it apart.

So, what do you suggest?
