Subject: Child cot?

I was in the junk yard today looking around, and I found one of the cots 
that goes over the front seats in a '74 Westy.  So I took it and hid it 
in a Plymouth.  :)  I see people ask for these now and then... does 
anyone want me to purchase this one for them?

David Schwarze might want it just for the canvas.  :)
