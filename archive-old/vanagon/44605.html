&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; maybe a setback here.._dot_can't seem to locate a set of pistons and 
&gt; cylinders for a 1700 engine...hmmm any help out there?
&gt; 
&gt; would it be possible to get a bigger case, rework the heads and use a set 
&gt; for a 1800?

cancel this request...we found a set...no problem now! yahooo! a 1700 set 
that is!
