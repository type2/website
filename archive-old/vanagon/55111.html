Thanks Greg,  this is good info to know.  Thanks.

&gt;
&gt;As a firefighter, maybe I can shed some light.  When we respond to a car on
&gt;fire call, the last thing we are worried about is an explosion from fuel
&gt;tanks.  The reason is actually pretty simple.
&gt;
&gt;Gasoline in liquid form doesn't burn.  The danger is from the vapors that are
&gt;given off from the gasoline as the temparture increases rapidly.   Diesel
&gt;fuel is extremely safe in liquid form.  If the temperature of the fuel (gas
&gt;or diesel) is low, there is little danger of explosion.  If the temp is high
&gt;(like summer), the liquid can turn to vapor VERY quickly (as in miliseconds).
&gt; The burn is expansive and so quick that it appears instant (hence an
&gt;explosion).  The reason gas tanks don't explode very often is because even if
&gt;the fuel gives off vapors and is ignited, there is little vapors to explode.
&gt;
&gt;The propane tank, as you indicated, has a over pressure relieve valve.
&gt; Again, propane has to turn to vapor before it will ignite.  So LP propane
&gt;has to expand to create vapors (and generate heat as well).  The
&gt;characteristics of Propane igniting in an approved propane tank are rather
&gt;complex and would take a long time to explain.
&gt;
&gt;The biggest threat to a person around a car fire is with the newer cars and
&gt;the gas shocks in the bumpers and suspension shock absorbers..  Vanagons
&gt;don't have these (at least through 85 anyway).
