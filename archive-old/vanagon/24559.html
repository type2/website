Subject:       '57 Deluxe is sick!

Friends,

First off, thanks to all those that have dropped by my website!  
(allbeit rightnow no traffic is going on or off campus today!)

My '57 is feeling sick lately:

After a good mechanic adjusted the timing, I started having trouble 
getting it to start up.

It's gotten to the point where I'm at a loss for the solution.  
I've adjusted the carb as explained by fellow list members, and that 
did wonders for my idle problem, but it still has a hard time 
starting.

You can't give it ANY gas at all.  If you pump the gas, it won't 
start.  It will crank for at least 10 seconds, and then just barely 
start firing on its own.  It'll die after two seconds or so, and then 
it's the same process.  

After a couple minutes of this, and it has warmed up a touch, you can 
just barely touch the pedal and it will start to idle.  After a 
minute or so, you can then gingerly step on the pedal and it will rev.

Any ideas.  I realize it is getting too much gas at startup, or 
something similar.  If the timing were adjusted wrong, would that 
cause it to not start up?

It burps when you hit the gas after it has warmed up, but other than 
that, it is great.

I adjusted the idle mixture, speed to all sorts of variations to no 
avail.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!
