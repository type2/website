Subject:      Got em! Itchigo's wearing 370s!:) (Inflation ? at end)

Hey folks...

I think last think i posted was the incident with the barrels...*sigh*

Anyhow, got my Yokohama 370LT's installed yesterday...YEAH!

Love 'em. Had to put 100 miles on them by noon today (finished with Se*rs
at 8.30 last night..) Because the place that was going to balance them
said they wanted at least that many miles on them, first. So they can
stretch, and seat. *shrug* Not a problem....drove till ~midnight, (Well,
watched Voyager first, at a friends...:)

Even unbalanced, i had NO trouble...:) Didnt go faster than 65,
though...(Itchigo needs a valve adjustment, *sigh*)

Got them balanced today (on the car, btw...nifty machine..), and got up to
70 on the way home...Quiet (at least, i dont hear them over my exhaaust
leak...damn the gaskets NOPI sells!), good dry traction (40 on curves that
35 would have squeeled the old tires..), And.....love them!:) Havent tried
them wet, yet...but i know it'll happen sooner than i want...

Even at 84 bucks each, (plus..) So far i'm well satisfied.

They couldnt align the bus, because it turns out that the barrels bent my
right tierod..*sigh* Thats ok, i have a spare (from the old beam) I'll
install ASAP...


Now...the question!:)

You folks running 370's (or similiar load D tires) on a Baywindow Westy
(non-westy's too..) What inflation pressures have you found success with?

Thanks....david
