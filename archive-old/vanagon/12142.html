Picking up a copy of VW motoring (I don't get it normally as it
covers Audi/Golf type stuff mainly), I came across a feature on
a German firm called Beetles Revival. This firm exists to import
Mexican VWs into Europe, mainly various forms of beetle (hence
the name), but also can get the current Mexican type 2.

Most of the article was beetle options and prices, but a couple
of bits may be of interest here.

`... Mexican built Type 2 features a 1781cc 63 kW water cooled
in-line engine with electronic ignition and a regulated catalytic
converter. Gearbox is a 4-speed manual and it has front disc brakes.
Extras on the Caravelle are tinted glass, metallic paint, sliding
windows, velour upholstery, reading lights and radio/cassette
with aerial and\ speakers.'

A couple of small photos were also included, one showing a panel
van from a front quarter view with the raiator mounted on the front.

The other photo shows a rear three quarter view of the Caravelle model.
&gt;From the gutter line down the whole thing is the normal bay window
bus (if rather clean and straight!), but the roof has changed. The normal
curve has gone to be replaced by what looks like a squarer top,
rather like a metal version of a pop top when it is down. Makes
the bus look quite different in some ways. There are other
small differences for this model as well; plastic wheel trims,
embossed vw badge on the middle of the tailgate and black (plastic?)
mirrors and bumbers.


No price is given for the bus. Oh well, back to my heap.
