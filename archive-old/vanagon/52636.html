&gt;    working.
 
&gt;    Or is the grid really a bunch of resistive wires in parallel, such
&gt;    that one (or more) of the lines would work, even if the others aren't
&gt;    working?

Tom,

It's wired in parallel.  The current is distributed from the vertical
wires.  If a line doesn't work it has a break in it.  You can buy a
repair kit at any auto parts place, I know Pep Boys has it.  I had
limited sucess fixing a Bug window with this stuff.
