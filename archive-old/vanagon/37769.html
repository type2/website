&gt;Speaking of fiddling.  I need to get to the back of the Speedo/
&gt;idiot light and need some info. on how to get at it and remove
&gt;it so I can replace/fix the idiot lights.  I don't know at this

The idiot lights just plug in to the speedo, and get there gorund from it.
You'll need to test and see of the wire to them is hot with the lights on.
If the speedo works, then there's no reason to chuck it.

The idiot light color pieces are easy to fix.  I have a bunch of the colored
stuff here at home.
