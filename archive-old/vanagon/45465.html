&gt;Subject:? Splittie rust-repairable?
&gt;
&gt;Hey now,
&gt;        Looked at a '59 today here in Austin (I believe it was posted to
&gt;the list a few days back) and it has some hardcore cancer. Down by the
&gt;jackpoints (or where the jackpoints are on a baywindow, I'm assuming they
&gt;remain constant) there are holes about 2-3&quot; wide. This is on the
&gt;crossmembers that the floorpan rests on. Hardcore. Seems to me this is
&gt;real difficult to repair, any thoughts? The fellow has done a decent job
&gt;on the interior, it's in pretty fair shape, just a few spots with water
&gt;damage. Cute paint job too, real hippied out. The wife loves it, but I'm
&gt;afraid it's beyond me since I can't weld.
&gt;

        Looks like I should have mentioned the price-$1700 (!!) and he says
he won't go down. Too rich for my blood. Thanks for all the replies.

Peace,
