Subject: Re: Conduit for the bus.

I have had to run a number of sensor wires
in Bugs and Bus' in the past. The best thing for me
has been to use Serial cable. You can go with
someple, five conductor, or all the way to sheilded
25 conductor cable. Most of these have tight bundles,
good insulation, and can be gotten in 20 foot lengths
for cheap. Plenty of room to add more conductors, or
double a few up to handle more current.

PS. I poured the concrete slab for my VW shed this weekend.
Even got a friendly wave from a Vanagon Clan in the
biulding supply store parking lot. Got a good laugh
out of the guy with the $35,000 Ram pickup,
contruction and contrator grade, who could not
load 10 foot landscape timber in the back. His jaw
hung open while I loaded four sheets of plywood and
some 12 and even 16 foot timber into the back and out
the passenger window. And 10 bags of mulch. And 6
potted shrubs. And a wheelbarrow. He had such a hard time 
with those measly timbers. Should get a REAL truck!
