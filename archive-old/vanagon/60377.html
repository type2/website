&gt; I just bought my first Westfalia.   It is my 8th VW, second Vanagon,but
&gt; first full camper.   The owner gets back in town tomorrow, I am beside
&gt; myself with excitment.  This is worse than a child on Christmas
&gt; morning.  I can't even focus on work, it's all I can think about.  OK I
&gt; have it under control!!
&gt; 
&gt; Are 84 models prone to special problems that I should be aware of ?  It
&gt; only has 61,000 miles on it.  The PO said he put a new clutch in less
&gt; than a year ago.  Is that normal?  My other Vanagon has 110k on the
&gt; original clutch.    The AC compressor sounds like it has loose marbles
&gt; in it.  I know don't run it.  I will likely unhook it to avoid messing
&gt; it up.   The last question is what type of glue should I use to reattach
&gt; the sagging top seals.  They are in good condition but they are coming
&gt; loose from the fiber glass.   Will contact cement work?
&gt; 
&gt; Excuse me while I do little volkswagen dance.
&gt; 
&gt; I await your response.
&gt; If you can please call with advice 1-800-264-6757.
