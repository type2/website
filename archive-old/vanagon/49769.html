Subject: FS in CO: '84 Westy GL Wolfsburg

Having just happily bought a '91 Synchro Westy, I need to part with my
beautiful '84 Westy GL Wolfsburg edition.  In excellent condition, runs
perfectly, 90k miles, automatic transmission, all camper equipment works,
all canvas and upholstery perfect, rare middle seat for two more passengers,
new brakes, after-market AC (so storage area above back seat still usable),
no head gasket leaks, CVs fine, brown and tan, $9,000.  This beauty, located
in the mountains 180 miles west of Denver, CO, is real choice, and I just
hope that my new synchro runs as trouble-free as the '84 has............
(Or is that an unrealistic dream?????)
