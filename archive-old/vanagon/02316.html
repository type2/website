Hello !  I don't know where you are but:  I just put a new muffler on my
'87,  got if from Canadian Tire here in Ottawa  Muffler $44.95, tailpipe
$25.49.  The VW dealer here wanted some radical, outrageous amount as you
were quoated.   Anyway LOOK around before you buy.  So far the $44.95
muffler is doing just fine thank you very much.  It is exactly the same
configuration as the original which I took off.  Guareteed 1 year over the
counter or for &quot;life&quot; if you have them put it on.  &quot;Life&quot; meaning your
&quot;life&quot; as owner of the vehicle.  I posted all the info related to exaust
system parts to this list about a month ago, so you should be able to get
it from the archives.  Good luck.

Cheers,

Frank
