&gt;what does direct injection mean?  Quite bluntly, I think that it is nothing
&gt;but add-hype.

I've often wondered about this. In the early '80s, GM started pressurizing
their carburetors, and some ad guy with a lot of contempt for his
customers' mechanical knowledge, called it a &quot;throttle body injector&quot;,
which is a name that could in truth be applied to any carburetor,
pressurized, computer-controlled, or not.

Sounds to me like manufacturers with real fuel injection, immediately
got on the bandwagon with names like &quot;direct injection&quot;, which seems
to mean &quot;ours is REALLY fuel injection&quot;.

Besides these, anyone know what &quot;Tuned port injection&quot; refers to?
Inquiring minds want to know.   :-S
