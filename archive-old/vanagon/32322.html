Subject: &quot;Made By Hand&quot;, 1961 Porsche Factory Tape

	Volks,
	About a month ago I mailed my copy of the 1961 Porsche promo
movie/factory tour tape to Mitch Covington so he could see someone
installing front windows with the string trick, with is how the
Porsche 356s were made too. At my prompting, Mitch asked if anyone
else wanted to borrow the tape and he says he got a long list of
replies. Ak! What to do?

	So I figured, since its my tape, I'll post what I think
are sensible rules and maybe I'll even get it back one day! Its 
a really cool tape, showing 356 assembly in 1961, and after that
is Nikki Lauda explaining Formula 1 racing. From 90hp to 750hp.

	We're all friends here, and everyone who wants to should be able
to enjoy this treasure, so we should just keep forwarding it on a first-come
first-served basis. When everyone who wants to see it has seen it, I guess
I'll get it back :) I'll probably have moved by then, since I'm selling
my house this quarter! 

	Its a pain to have to keep saying &quot;Yes, yes, I want to see
that tape&quot; and then not get it, so since Mitch has a list of people who
have told him they want to see the tape, I suggest he include the list, or
at least the top 5-10 people, in with the tape when he sends to the first
person who got back to him. When you get the tape, cross off your name
and send it on to the next person on the list when you're done with it.

	When you're the last person on the list, ask for who else might 
want to see it. When nobody wants to see it, contact Bill Abbott at 
wabbott_at_mtest.teradyne_dot_com,
4660 Westmont Avenue, Campbell, CA, 95008
408 451 3278 (wk) 408 374 8073 (hm)

	Sedimental guy that I am, I asked Mitch to include a picture of
himself, his bus, his SO, kids, pets, whatever, with name(s) written on
the back in with the tape. It would be kinda cool if each person added
a picture... If I ever got the tape back I'd have quite an album! Something
to pass around the fire at Big Sur next year?

	For anyone who does this, I'll be happy to send a reciprocal picture
of me, my bus, my sweetie Jean, my cats Georgiy and Moustache. Just put
in the address on your picture, or if you can't wait, send me your address.
I've already got pictures of Tobin and Christa, Brian's busses, Christian,
his family and bus, Saturday morning at last year's Big Sur and the March 18th
party at Martha's last year.

	Finally, try to keep the tape moving- watch it as often
as you want, but put it back into the mail within about a week of
getting it if you could.

	Mitch, can you print a copy of this note and put it in with
the tape too? Thanks!

	Anyone can also buy their own copy of &quot;Made By Hand&quot; from Motorbooks.
