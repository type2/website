Subject: Does air cond.=hp loss?

The last few wasserboxer  vans that I've looked at, that had A/C, have had their
compressor belts removed, and the owners all said the same thing - &quot;It robs too
much power off the engine.&quot;  Do the A/C systems in the wasserboxers really suck
this much?  I'd never buy an air cooled van with A/C, but I thought the H2O vans
could take it. Does it really put that much of a load on the engine? How long
does it take to get reasonably cool inside once you turn it on?  How many of you
out there have removed your compressor belts too ?  My '84 has the big factory
sunroof but no A/C. The '87 I just bought had the A/C compressor belt removed. I
wonder if I should just keep my '84 with it's &quot;natural&quot; air cond (sunrf) as I
won't have to worry about a compressor dogging the engine. Or is the top hp of a
1.9 without A/C the same as a 2.1 with the A/C on full blast??

A/C would be nice, but I really don't want to kill the engine, and have the
accelerating power of my '67 bus!  (ie.- reeaal slooowww...)
