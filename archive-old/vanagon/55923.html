Subject: Question about 86 Synchro Weekender

In a previous posting there is a 86 Synchro For Sale

&gt;86 SYNCRO VANAGON, 4 wheel drive, good cond in and out, am/fm cass, 
 cruise, &gt;Weekender Pkg, asking $3700. (860) 868-7226. Washington

My questions to the user community is:
What does the Weekender Package for the 86 van comprise of?
	Can it sleep 4 people?
	Does it include the pop top with room for 2 to bunk in?
	Does the back seat recline into a bed?

Don't care about the complete Westfalia camper since the price is atractive.

Thanks for any tidbits of information
Joel - Vanless
