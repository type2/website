Subject: Propane Vs. Electric refrigerators?

Hey now,
        As the Pacific Northwest trek comes ever closer, I start to ponder
the virtues of refrigerators. Any ideas from the camping sect? What's
better? What's cheaper? What's going to be good for us as we spend 6 weeks
on the road? What did Elvis use? What did Jerry use? What does Gerry use
for his beer?  ;-) Thanks to one and all for the help.

Peace,
