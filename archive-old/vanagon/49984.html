Octobugfest is coming up on the 13th. Does anyone know about this event? 
(It's held in Puyallup WA). I plan on attending, if I can get away.

It's at the Puyallup Fairgrounds.    Gates open to the public 8:30am.  I
think admission is $6.    The show is small and custom - oriented, but the
swap is big and inside, and there is a lot of parking lot to check out the
vws in.   I'll be there, swapping splitty bus bits in space 112 by  the
'pond'.
