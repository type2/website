&gt;&gt;&gt;It looks at if there once used to be a mud flap behind the
&gt;&gt;&gt;front/right wheel: a metal piece that could have been part of a mud flap is
&gt;&gt;&gt;still there.  Sami ('75 Westy)
&gt;
&gt;My 83 westy has only one mud flap on the left side to protect the propane tank.
&gt;I looked at the right side and could not see any trace of a flap being there
&gt;before. I am not sure there was one there.

Then in both cases there was just one flap to protect the propane tank.
(My tank is on the right hand side).

Could someone perhaps tell me how the rubber flap is attached to the
hardware? Pop rivets, maybe? I might try to just cut an old floor mat to
size and attach it to the hardware that's still there.
