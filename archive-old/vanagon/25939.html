&gt;Filler pipe leak? I guess you'd have to remove that body panel to check
&gt;if there's no visible leak, and it's only a shot in the dark...

  You don't need to remove the body panel, but it's a real bitch to see
what you're doing in there. I replaced all of my fuel lines, including the 
fuel filler rubber bellows, in August.  Do not smoke and take your time
groping around in there 'cause this is something you don't want to re-do.
  I used *real* hose clamps and fuel injection (hi-pressure) rubber lines.
The ring main has lots of stubby little fuel lines that complete the ring
so I removed it to get at those.  New fuel injector seals went in at the
same time.
  The rubber elbow that attaches to the fuel filler and the fitting on the
fuel tank was very brittle and cracked.  It's a dealer item and the dealer no
longer had any to sell.  Great.  I bought a 90 degree elbow of 2&quot; muffler
pipe from a local shop and attached it to the bus with two rubber bellows that
are for an off-road buggy fuel cell.     No leaks, fumes or fire hazard.
