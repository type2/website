Subject: Re: head cap nuts- 'torque to hold'

In a message dated 96-12-16 13:15:53 EST, you write:

&gt;  as the
&gt;  final torque is reached, it must be held until the nut stops turning.
 this
&gt;  takes time.  alot of time.  typically, a specification will be given for a
&gt;  'torque-to-hold' time of say 30 seconds.

Having not done this myself, &quot;I don't get it&quot;.  Does the nut &quot;untwist&quot; as the
torsion of the stud springs back?  I've never seen a nut move &quot;by itself&quot;
before.

In need of enlightenment,
