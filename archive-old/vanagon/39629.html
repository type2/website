        LIMITED SLIP REAR END

         Cory,
            I have installed a Locking axil from a Syncro into
            my 2 wheel drive Vanagon GL. It by experence improves
            your tracsion about 20%. The problem with Vanagons is
            mainly 2 things. (1) Vanagons are front heavy. Yes even
            with the engine in the rear. Mine doesn't have air
            witch even makes things worse. (2) Vanagons don't flex
            as much as the average car. Yes bend in the middle.
            All cars flex. This helps keep the drive wheels on the
            ground. Go around a slow bend that has a bad hump in it
            and you loose tracion. VW new this thats why we have the
            Syncro.

            For all the problems that a mechanic can cause installing
            a rear axil, I would not recommend this to anyone unless
            the transmission was out of the vehicle for other reasons.
