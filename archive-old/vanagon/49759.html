Subject: Bus FAQ Update

Ok, I actually got around to putting something into the FAQ tonight.  All
thats in there now are questions that people have asked me via email, and I
got tired of answering, so its all off the top of my head, and nothing
gleaned from the other FAQs yet.

Also, I put up a picture of a double-door 23-window on the misc bus pix page.
