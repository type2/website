Subject: Re: Westy tent - setting up

Please provide some details on this tent. Is this basically an awning? Is
it OEM? Where can we get one?

Last Friday, I installed an oil cooler thermostat in the 82 Westy and also
switched to 15W50 synthetic... This is what I have to report so far:
a) engine head temp 350 C (this is not changed); oil pressure at startup:
70psi - cold;  45 psi at 3000 rpm  with oil temp at 180 F. The oil temp
sender is located in the sump but the thermostat (and oil fan switch) are
down stream. Since the fan is designed to come on at 180 but has not yet
come on it seems that the oil in the sump is much hotter than the oil that
flows
by the switch. I guess this is a good thing because  it means the oil
flowing into the engine is  actually cooler that what is registered by the
gauge... I hope this makes sense...having the sensor located in sump
might not be a bad idea - this is where the oil is likely to be the hottest..

Two other items of note: synthetic sheds its heat much quicker. After a 15
minute shut down - the pressure and temps will be back to near normal
temps and psi levels as compared to dino oil. Some have suggested that
this means that the heat is passed on to the engine block - and there may
be some truth to this. The difference may not be important, however. The
other point is  that synthetic does leak much more easily. It took several
tries of removing both valve covers and repositioning the gaskets before a
good seal could be obtained. Similarly the drain and sump gaskets needed a
little extra tightening.
