&gt; Howdy all,

  Though I won't describe the design (just a tad
&gt; paranoid), I do believe they will be pretty nifty. One of the big points
&gt; of these stickers, I think, is to place them in a standard spot, on the
&gt; rear left corner/window, to be able to instantly identify fellow
&gt; members. So, they will stand out, but NOT in a tacky fashion. They are
&gt; very tasteful, and simple, yet elegant, and with lotsa symbolism present
&gt; in the design. :)

Hi Richard, 
Would it be possible for someone to get a copy of the design and put it 
on their webpage? And while thinking about it, I do not remember seeing 
where anyone has put information about this list or VintagVW on their 
page.  Maybe this would help others find this GREAT pool of knowledge. 
Please don't take this as a criticism, heck, I don't even have a homepage 
and maybe I shouldn't make suggestions on others until I have tried myself.
Just some thoughts,
dave.
