Subject: Re: Flywheel Locking tool

&gt;     Been looking for one of these things - - but no luck so far at usual 
&gt;     tool sources - - FLAPS, Sears, Tool King - -
&gt;     
&gt;     Don't really have room where I'm working to utilize long angle iron 
&gt;     per idiot book.  Anybody know where I might be able to get a locking 
&gt;     tool - - or am I going to have to fabricate one.
&gt;     
&gt;     please reply via E-mail to jonesl_at_tcplink.nrel_dot_gov and/or 
&gt;     rdyd26a_at_prodigy_dot_com - - as I am on digest mode.
&gt;     
&gt;     thanx in advance
&gt;

Flywheel Lock (1950-1979) Part number 37120  $8.49.  I have one.  Works
great, but had to use a nut for a spacer.
