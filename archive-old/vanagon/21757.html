There exists a market for each kind of bluebook: for the private buyer,
for the private seller, and two for the dealer. The one that he shows you
when you're roaming his used car lot and the other when you would like to
trade in your old clunker. 

When we tried to sell our Honda, I talked to the dealer (what a waste of
time!) and, dismayed by his ridiculous offer, stuck *my* little bluebook
under his nose and pointed to similar cars on his lot. He just shrugged
and mumbled: &quot;welcome to the car market!&quot; Then he showed me a Cadillac
from the 80's (the dark years), price sticker at $15,000 (!), and he
assured me that it would just be a matter of time before someone walks in
and buys it without further negociation. Dealers have a lot of time.
