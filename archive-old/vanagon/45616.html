Roy,

Before you cut it off, try this: buy a 3/4&quot; flex handle from Sears, get a 4
foot long piece of pipe that will fit over the end of the flex handle.  Set
it in position with the socket on the nut, and stand and bounce a little on
the end.

That will generate something like 600-750 ft. lbs. of torque on the
nut....it will come off!!  And if that's not enough, get a passing stranger
to stand on it with you. You may have so much torque that the wheel will
spin, but that's another problem....

Flex handles are much tougher than and ratchets, and with Sears, if it
breaks, which it won't, they'll give you a new one.

What helps is having a slow steady increase in true torque.  As opposed to
say, banging with a hammer or bouncing on a short handle.

BTW I have found that the nuts &quot;look&quot; like they're fused to the drum on
those axles.

If you don't have access to a Sears, the have a 800 number and you can mail
order it.  Tools are the one thing Sears still will mail odrer.

&gt;ar was 3/4&quot; drive...that's what amazed I!  I broke a
&gt;1/2&quot; drive one today attacking the nut again.
&gt;
&gt;I am half tempted to get another nut and cut this one off....
&gt;
&gt;Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!
