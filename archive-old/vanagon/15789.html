Subject: Re: Manassas (sp?) VA show still around ??

&gt;Although I never went to it I remember hearing of a VW swap and  
&gt;show in Manassas VA that was one of the bigger ones on the east  
&gt;coast.  Is it still around ?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;The show is held at Old Dominion speedway in Manassas Va on Sun May 28.
There is a great
campground (Bull Run Regional Park) to stay at. For info on the show
