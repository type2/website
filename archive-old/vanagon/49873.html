Subject: Columbus Day Camp-out, October 11-13, Seneca Rocks, WV

Gentlefolk,

My abject apologies.  I have been incredibly busy the last two weeks, and
have only been &quot;on-net&quot; on the fly.  I had intended to assemble a web page
wiht all the specifics, but have gotten no further than &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;.

Columbus day at Seneca Rocks is very much still on!  Please plan on
attending if you possibly can!  Those of you who have indicated an
interest, I have your names and will send confirmation RSN (real soon
now), I hope by Monday.  At last count there were 11 people coming, so it
is shaping up nicely.

If you are in the DC, PA, WV area the site is within a very reasonable
drive.  The foliage should be magnificent, and it's not Skyline, so there
will be no backup to see it.  There will be a potluck Saturday night, if
enough people show an interest (please let me know).

If you would like to see the site, or get directions, Keith Cowing has
assembled a marvelous page relating to Seneca Rocks that includes maps
right down to the site numbers at the Seneca Shadows NFS Campground we
will be occupying.   The URL is:

http://www.reston_dot_com/senecaweb/seneca.htm

My research leads me to believe that it is approximately 3 hrs from DC, 4
from Baltimore, 6 from Raleigh, and 2.5 from Pittsburgh.

I still hope to post more details later (the rush *should* be over by
Wednesday next). Thanks to everyone for your patience.

                           H Steven Dolan
                           Alexandria, VA
