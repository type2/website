Bob,

You might consider cutting your losses and selling the car with your engine
up there, then take a plane home.  I understand that it is very unlikely you
could make back what you put into the engine alone, much less the car, but
hey, a loser is a loser.

I once did a pretty good fix on a bus link-pin with no needles left to speak
of by inserting a PVC pipe as a bushing instead of a bearing and then
reaming it to size.  A bit of grease on the pin and away we went with no
nasty clunk whenever we turned the wheel.

Eug,
'71
