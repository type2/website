Subject:      rabbit camper?? :)

well ... yup. it's a Vesta Bunny Hutch. picture this:
a vw rabbit, with an extended rear ... a sort of winnebago/eurovan body
grafted on behind the front doors, bigger than a Vanagon camper!! with
TWO rear axles (but remember: NEITHER of the rear axles does any pushing
or pulling) :) it was made by some company (Vesta?) in Indiana. it's a
78 model, white in color, with 120V air conditioning up top (for shore
power), 120V refrigerator, microwave, propane stove, propane furnance,
Onan generator, and aluminum gasoline tank (cause he had so much trouble
with the old steel one clogging with rust). heavy duty springs.

the guy who wants to sell it is here in Tuscaloosa, AL. name is Bob Sigler,
(205) 553-3897. anybody that wants any more info, let me know and i can
go look at it. :)  it's kinda cute, but in a BIG way. and he says it is
SSSSLLLLLLOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW. stable on the highway, but slow to get up to
speed. about 14-17 mpg on the highway. oh, yeah. he wants $3900 for it.

go gettum, rabbit folks! :)
