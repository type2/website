Subject: Re: O2 and H2O HOT

My '86 had all the same symptoms and it was simply that the radiator
was clogged.  Found a shop here in Raleigh that had the equipment to take
it apart and &quot;rod it out&quot; for $50 (I removed and reinstalled).  Now the temp 
gauge rarely climbs above the mid point.

Just take the hoses off and run a garden hose into the rad.  It should be
real easy to tell if this is the problem.  The flow through mine was
barely a trickle.

 &gt;The O2 sensor seems a might pricey, ie dealer$, Disconnnecting it is the 
 &gt;right first step, not great for your lungs however. Your water problem is 
 &gt;due to the idiocy of VW putting the radiator cap at almost the lowest point 
 &gt;in the circuit. What is happening is that even though the water level is OK 
 &gt;when you check it parked wih the engine off there is an enormous air bubble 
 &gt;inside your heater core up front, the high point of the circuit. Once the 
 &gt;water pump starts spinning, it builds up enough pressure in the circuit to 
 &gt;compress the air bubble and your coolant level at the pump drops down below 
 &gt;the pump inlet level. Voila, no real pumping, temperature rockets up, you 
 &gt;warp your heads and/or cook those big expensive head gaskets. It's all down 
 &gt;hill after that! You can check for the air bubble by turning on the front 
 &gt;heat. If the windshield air is warm/hot  no problem, but if it is cool (and 
 &gt;floor air is hot) your heater core is half full of air and you need to bleed 
 &gt;the system, see Bentley. Leaking head gaskets can also let air into the 
 &gt;coolant system, aggravating the problem. Once  the pump starts leaking 
 &gt;around its shaft the coolant level will drop below the pump inlet etc. etc.. 
 &gt;This is what got me, and now, one pump, new gaskets on one side, it runs 
 &gt;again, but the other side is dripping. An air cooled vanagon is tempting 
 &gt;indeed.    tjs
