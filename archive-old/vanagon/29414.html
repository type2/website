Subject: Panamint Springs

It was a rel fun trip. A little reluctant and apprehensive about meeting
this bunch of CyberWagoners, we felt &quot;at home&quot; as soon as you started
arriving and introducing yourselves to us. We hope to join you on many more
trips to come and hopefully, not get in trouble with no pantless ladies!!!!!!!!

On our way way back our Syncro went thru the &quot;stuttering&quot; routine other
people mentioned (I bought some, only 5 Gallons, gas at Panamint Springs). I
did buy some more 92 octane in Olancha and it did improve but not cure the
syndrome. We stopped for lunch in Palmdale, filled it up with Chevron 92
octane and the &quot;stuttering&quot; desapeared. BTW same thing happened to us about
6 Mth ago on our
way back from Yellowstone, after filling up with some kind of no brand gasoline,
same problem, same solution.
