&gt; What about a group trip, fellow van.list people?  A caravan winding
&gt; across the country both directions, or perhaps up to Alaska?  Or....?
&gt; Think of the GREAT (lyrics for) songs around the campfire!  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, if there's a collective interest in this, I volunteer
&gt; help organize.....

I would go quite far out of my way to participate in something like this.
