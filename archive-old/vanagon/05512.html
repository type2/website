&gt; My wife totaled our 86 Vanagon Westfalia and we have several parts left over
&gt; that are for sale.
&gt;
&gt; Bra or noseguard(as my wife calls it) $20.00 This will fit any of the
&gt; square headlight and thinner bumper models.
&gt;
&gt; Screen for rear hatch $ 20.00 (This is probably a fortune from VW.)
&gt;
&gt; Shipping not included.
&gt;

Larry, I'd be happy to purchase the bra. Please contact me at:
