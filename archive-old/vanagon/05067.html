&gt; I'm glad this tire was finally mentioned.  The local tire shop that I
&gt; patronize (Ingold Tire) looked up the Vanagon in their tire book and 
this
&gt; was the only tire (that they sell I assume) that is recommended.  I 
was 
&gt; quoted a price of $76 per tire and can't wait until I can afford to get
&gt; them.  My '84 has some shit Patriot Ultra Supremes that are the worst
&gt; handling tires I've ever had the displeasure of rolling down the road.

I had /have these tires on my 85 GL but have found them not to be 
aggressive enough to do some of the offroading I do.  As long as I'm 
moving they were fine.  Went through some nasty water holes.  But 
from a dead stop I found myself gettig stuck on wet leaves on a slight 
incline.  They do run well on the highway and have gotten 50k out of 
two of them.
