&gt;Well, winter has finally arrived here in DC.  Once again I sit here at my

&gt;Does anyone know what gas heater would have been installed in a '78 bus?

The heater in my 79 is a Bosch, I believe.  (The other possibility,
according my my mechanic, is a Stewart-Warner--they were aftermarket, I
guess.)  I'm not really sold on these pups--mine's given me fits.  However,
on the increasingly rare occasions when it works, it works extremely well.

&gt;Do you want to sell it?

I'd be VERY VERY happy to sell it if I could find something else to use.
But I rather doubt that's going to happen.  I've finally decided to have
Ark Mirvis (he had an article in LiMBO's &quot;Transporter&quot; last time) rebuild
the damned thing.  If that fails I think I'll put in a woodstove &amp; hope to
never get smacked. :)
