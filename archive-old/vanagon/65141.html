Subject:      Hot VW's artical - Enough PLEASE, your admin

WOW! I stepped out of the office for a minute and all hell
broke out. I'm going to leave my opinion out of this, suffice
it to say &quot;to each his own&quot;. Let's drop this thread on the list.
WE can have a round of civil discussions at a later date on the
value of the various mediums of VW information.

If you feel that you need to continue this particular thread,
please do so via pmail.

But always remember you may someday meet at some Bus-out, that faceless
someone with whom your communicating on the list.

Cheers,

Your friendly VANAGON List Admins,

Chris Smith     Ron Lussier
