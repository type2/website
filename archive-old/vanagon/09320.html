&gt;&gt;             distinquished by a large one-piece windshield and rounded
&gt;&gt;             body contours. all had 'swing-axles'. also called T2

&gt;Whoa, now -- aren't swing axles the ones that have spades on the inner
&gt;end, while the outer end swings up and down?  Don't you mean IRS?

yup. got it backwards: IRS = 4 cv joints. 'swing-axle' is the old tuck-under-
when-you-go-around-corners thingie that the corvair also had. shows what
happens when you keep on typing after you've fallen asleep. :)
