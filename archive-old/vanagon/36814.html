Subject: winshield seal replacement

I just finished repairing the rust damage beneath the winshield last 
night. I left it overnight for the paint to dry completely. I'm looking 
for some tips or hints on installing the new seal. I'm sure you guys have 
done this many times and know some great tips on how to get it done 
easier. Thanks.
