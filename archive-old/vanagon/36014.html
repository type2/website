Subject: Windshield Seal Seeps Water

(Try saying that 10 times real fast.)

Hi everybody -

In my '89 Syncro, there seems to be rain water leaking down past the
seals in each corner of the windshield, where a little low spot forms
from the angle between the glass and rubber.  Anybody have a hint about
sealing this up?

There seems to be two rubber gaskets (or one gasket with a recess?)
separated by a plastic-covered metal band which runs the perimeter of
the windshield.  Does this band need replacing, reseating, etc.?  Or is
it the rubber gasket.  (I believe that the windshield in my van is the
original.)  Thanks for any tips!
