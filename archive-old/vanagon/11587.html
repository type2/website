Subject: Re: more tidbits

&gt;just perusing the new Transporter from LiMBO and ran across this stuff ...
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Al has a tent for his Vanagon that attaches to the back hatch. It is made
&gt;by Eureka and is called an A.T.V. tent.&quot;
&gt;&lt;unfortunately, that's all he says about it!&gt;
&gt;
Remember the Pinto??  It was available with the same tent idea, a Pinto 
camper! No smoking please! The tent hung from the hatch to a platform that 
unfolded and sat on two legs that rested on the ground. I belive this was a 
factory option?

OK now for the smallest camper on earth show...

I saw a FIAT 850 van when travelling once, if you've ever seen a FIAT 500 
you get the picture.  It had a rear hatch tent, mainly because the vehicle 
was too short to lie down in otherwise. A counter with stove, sink + 
cupboards was across the back of the front seats, and the rear seat folded 
forward for sleeping. The vehicle is about 4 feet wide outside and not much 
taller! You can carry them home under your arm if they break down. I would 
love to have one of these, it was like a kidsize Westy.    tim s.
