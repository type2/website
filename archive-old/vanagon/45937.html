Does anyone have experience rebuilding the a/c compressor? Mine has a leak
from the rear cover, where the hoses attach. It seems as though all it needs
is the gasket, are parts available and if so, where. The clutch and
compressor turn (when the low pressure switch is jumped) so I am guessing
that the pump will work if it doesn't leak. The price of a new compressor is
pretty scary, Camelback quoted me $598 and a local dealer is over $700. World
Wide is about $300 but they have been out of stock for about two months with
no idea when the new shipment will come in, it was due in May.
Any help would be appreciated.
