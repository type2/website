Subject: T-IV engines

Quick question:

Are the Type-IV engines used in the 411 and 412 cars EXACTLY
the same as those used in the '72-up busses?

I have a '72 T-III, and have access to some old T-IV engines (from busses)
and was wondering if I could just swap the engines over (w/ computers)
to get an oil filter, more durability, and possibly 2000 ccs.

I know the engines are more expensive, but the 50% more that rebuilding a 
2 litre engine over the 1600 that is in there now would be worth
it. Plus, the T-IV engines look pretty complete.

Are the cases the same for the 2000cc as 1600 T-IV, and only the 
jugs and heads change?

Thanx.
