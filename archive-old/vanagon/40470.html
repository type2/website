&gt;Hi all
&gt;I don't know if this has been covered to everyone's satisfaction, but.....
&gt;There are a ton of advertisements for bike racks that fit, via a variety of
&gt;means, to the back of a vehicle. Trailer hitch, rear window, etc.
&gt;The name of the magazine is Velo News and can be found at any decent bike
&gt;shop. If you can't find it I can give any info that is needed, I've got the
&gt;mag.
&gt;Hope this helps
&gt;

That's swell, but as bus owners it's kind of not too good to mount bikes to
the back, thus impeding engine access.

I'm glad this subject appeared (maybe it's already been beat to death, I
just joined this group), because I was wondering how one was to mount their
bike to the FRONT of the bus.

Also, and I oughta know this really, I was wondering how tires get mounted
up there, too.

Thanks,
Eric
