Subject: sold the '73, David Schwarze visits





Hi all,

Well I sold my '73 Westphalia yesterday, I put the 'for sale' sign in the
window about 10 AM parked here on the University of Arizona campus and had
a buyer by 5 PM.  I'm a little sad but a little richer.  Joel, one less bus.

David Schwarze came to visit last night.  He is on his way to Dallas with
his cat and was planning to drive most of the night to avoid mid-day
heat.  (mainly so the cat won't suffer)  We cooked some chicken on the
barbecue at my house and tried some beer that David brought.  (Naked Aspen
Raspberry, pretty good.) It was fun looking at each other's busses, talking
about work, volkswagens, Texas, San Diego, this list, the GNATT, Inuvik, etc.
