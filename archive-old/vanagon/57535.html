Subject: '81 Westy power from key

I was replacing the (broken) stereo on the '81 I got recently, and I
noticed that the wire the PO ran to the stereo (aftermarket) goes hot when
you INSERT the key into the ignition.  You don't have to turn it.  Should I
connect to a different spot?

Also, the VDO voltmeter I hooked up to the same wire shows about 10 volts
whith the engine off, and about 12 with the engine on.  My multimeter shows
12.34v with the engine off, and almost 14 with it on.  Is the VDO gauge bad?

TIA, and I'll read 'um when I get back.  We are taking the Westie out for a
real, live camping trip -- our first since we got it!!!  Also the first
time towing our little boat, using the bumper we had made (2&quot; receiver
integral to the bumper).  If you are in the area, stop and say &quot;HI.&quot;  We
will be at Parker Canyon Lake, near Sierra Vista, AZ.

Thanks,

Bill
