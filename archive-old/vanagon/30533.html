I took a look around some Orange County, CA junkyards for some 
parts for my '73 Westy last Saturday. Here's what I found in the
way of air-cooled VWs:


&quot;Pick Your Part&quot; - Beach Blvd. and Ball Rd. in Stanton, CA.
Three late '70s busses, three '73 hardtop Westys, a '68 bus,
a split window w/no front sheet metal and a couple '70s bugs.
The Westy's still had the camper interiors intact.

(I pulled two very clean front seat headrests, an inside door)
(handle and a DIESEL badge off a Volvo which cost me total $11.)


&quot;Ardmore Auto Dismantlers&quot; - On Katella, just East of Beach Blvd.
in Stanton, CA.
The sign says six acres of cars.  I found 5 bay window busses
2-3 bugs and 2-3 squarebacks.


&quot;Import Auto Salvage&quot;  N.Manchester in Anaheim. CA.
They were closed on Saturday. but it looked like they might have
some good drivetrain parts from what I saw in the windows.


&quot;Wrecks West&quot; - W.5th St. in Santa Ana, CA.
2 Vanagons, 5 bay window busses and a '72 single cab p'up.
Most of these were really picked over.
This place had a rack with over 50 beetle doors.  I'd say that
they probably had your year *and* color, should you need a door.


&quot;Freeway pick-your-part&quot;  E.6th St. in Santa Ana, CA.
1 Vanagon, 1 very rusty '68 bus and two '70s beetles. Not much.


&quot;Mesa Auto Dismantlers&quot;  Placentia Ave in Costa Mesa, CA.
Two Vanagons and no air-cooled VWs.


=====
I'd estimate that 10% of the vehicles in the lots had crash damage.
Either the really bad cars went to the crusher or it's a sign that
it's easier to scrap the old car than put a new engine or tranny
in it and drive it some more.

DISCLAIMER:
I have nothing to do with the above mentioned Auto Dismantlers
other than being a customer.
