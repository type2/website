Subject: Friday crossword!

For your puzzlement and Friday entertainment, I donate to the public
domain of the vanagon list the following crossword puzzle. It's small but
it's good!

This is a 5 by 5 crossword.  Each entry is five letters; there aren't
any &quot;black squares&quot;.  It is sort of in the spirit of Ted Shane.  I
recommend a collective effort here if you get stuck on any of the entries.


Across:
What the German Shepherd's tail was doin (when he got to ride in the vanagon)
Part of A DIAMOND, could be A FIRST
Old _____ Home, type of import junkyard
Eventempered Underpowered Longlasting Easygoing Throttlers, organization of
  those of us who hurry slowly!
What you have to come up with for the spouse when you've dropped another
  thou on a beautiful restorable old brick carcass


Down:
What the friendly brick driver does upon sighting another friendly
  brick driver
A way to come when sailing
Swilled by sots, downed by drunks, dipped by dipsos--by the gallon!
A long narrow ridge or mound of sand, gravel, and boulders deposited by
  a stream flowing on, within, or beneath a stagnant glacier.  Also,
  a practitioner of the art of esking.
Like a Westy (that's been all fixed up to be homey)
