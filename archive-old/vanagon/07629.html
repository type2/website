Subject: Tire size question
Date: Mon, 5 Dec 94 21:09:11 EST

  A simple question for any one with time on their hands...what effect
does running a larger tire have on the odometer, speedometer and trip
meter? If for example there are 195s instead of 185s on the front wheels would
it be necessary
to increase the distance travelled and speed by say 18% (the difference
betwen 185s and 195s)? I am curious and also looking for an excuse why my
mpg is lower than it should be. TIA - DC
