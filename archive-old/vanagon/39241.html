Subject: Gas heater question.

	I was wondering if it was possible to use a gas heater without 
the stock heater boxes in place. The van I looked at had no blower in the 
engine compartment and the gas heater was not hooked up. The owner said 
that the heat wasn't hooked up because the PO used the gas heater. Thanks 
again.
