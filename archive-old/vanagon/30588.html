Hey now

On the way back from Binghamton, NY, I had my '77 pop-top Westy
cruising at 80-85 on level roads.  At that speed the aerodynamics of
the bus make driving more interesting, but certainly less certain.  I
took it down to about 75 and had a better time of it.

Can't hardly hear the CD player at these speeds!

&gt;  Sean,
&gt; 
&gt;  My '74 Westy &lt;with aerodynamic handicap pop-top&gt; has done 77 mph on
&gt;  flat ground with no apparent wind. My owners manual says that a '74 bus
&gt;  has a &quot;top and cruising speed&quot; of 79 mph. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I've had my bus well over 80 mph coasting downhill in neutral in pursuit of
&gt;  Bradley and his '77 on a steep descent enroute to the Panamint campout.
