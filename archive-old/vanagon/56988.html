Subject: Re: Core charge for Vanagon Transmission?



  Some Used Auto Parts establishments have &quot;Core Buyers&quot;.  I would rather
see the old trans that I took out of say, Ron Salmons van get torn down,
inspected and rebuilt if possible.  If a person looks at the price of the
individual parts Inside a Vanagon transmission, and figures out how much it
would cost to replace the broken and damaged parts inside a trans, you'd see
it's a good idea to keep as many of these trannies in circulation then
tossed to who knows where?

  I know that Air-Cooled Vanagon trannies are starting to get a little more
scarce then watercooled ones.

  I Always charge a core fee when selling a part like a transmission.  This
keeps my core supply up.  If all I did was sell them and not ask for cores,
I'd have no trannies to sell when I or someone else needed one.

  When Ron Salmon was here last October, he needed a tranny for his Vanagon.
I had one because I keep my supply at a certain level.  As it turned out, I
used some of the parts from the transmission out of his van to fix my trans
when I got my 84 with a bad trans!

  I think that there are times that a core or fee should be expected.  In
Tom's case it sounds like the person he was dealing with, waited to inform
him of the Core fee, but either way the core is worth money.  Every person
thinks a core is worth a different value, I value a Vanagon core at about
$300.00 depending on what the symptoms were prior to the removal of the trans.
