Hey Clay

I didn't know there was a support group.  Please add Samiam, my '77
Westy, to the list of hideous green Transporters out there.  I need
help!  All my friends make fun of Samiam and his plaid upholstery
(snif snif).  He almost coordinates with the avocado appliances in 
my kitchen...

&gt; &gt;&gt;	We have the ultimate, a lime green '78 Westy as our chariott. 
&gt; Will you need to be joining my &quot;puke green&quot; support group? Don't be 
&gt;  afraid there are many  out there who have been through the pain of 
&gt;  owning a bile colored vehicle.
