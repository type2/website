Subject:      Re: Phosphate-free anti freeze

Budd, there are at least three brands other than Autobahn, that sell
phosphate free antifreeze. Prestone, Havoline and one I can't remember
(off brand), all for $6.99 at FLAPS, Walmart, Target, etc. I have used
phosphate free in my 90 Carat for 145K miles with no engine/cooling
problems.
