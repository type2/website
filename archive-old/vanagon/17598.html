Subject:       Fans, was Re: Refrigerator and alarm

Hi David.  Just curious about this little fan.  How big is it?  I 
have one that runs on one D cell with a 4&quot; blade with adjustable 
gooseneck that I use to cool the van while camped.  It let's us sleep 
in the heat anyway!!  I only get 2 or 3 nights out of the one cell 
though.  I paid around $12 CDN a couple years ago.

Is this little fan made specifically for the fridge?

Just curious.
Harry.

&gt; On the subject of refrigerator fans, I recently bought a small fan that
&gt; circulates air *inside* the fridge.  This one is nice, because by
&gt; virtue of the fact that it runs on two &quot;D&quot; cells, it requires no wiring
&gt; or cutting the inside wall of the fridge.  To give you an idea of how
&gt; much current these small cooling fans use, the makers of this fan claim
&gt; that it will run for 30 days on 2 alkaline D cells.  Since I'm going
&gt; to be using it for 29 days straight, I'll have a chance to test that
&gt; claim.  It is nothing more than a small motor with a fan blade with a
&gt; plastic housing, that sits on the bottom of the fridge and blows air
&gt; upwards.  I was gouged almost $20 for this from Camping World (I really
&gt; hate advertising for this place, but I didn't see this thing anywhere
&gt; else).  I am convinced (and I think Derek will agree) that this fan will
&gt; increase the cooling potential of my fridge by circulating the air inside.
&gt; I just hope it will work in the dark.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; -David
