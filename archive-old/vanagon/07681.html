&gt; Okay! I called the dealer (Lasher VW in downtown Sac.) and he has the original
&gt; plastic screw and the metal screw that is suppose to replace it.  However,
&gt; the parts person says that he would he wasn't crazy about putting in a 
&gt; metal screw for fear of damaging the plastic casement.  Any comments on
&gt; this?  I'm going to buy both since they're only $7.15 all told.  Anybody
&gt; out there have any problem with the metal screw.  I could see it if you
&gt; torqued it to tight, but if it's just snug I don't see a problem.

It is definitely a snug fit.  The diameter of the metal screw is slightly
larger than the plastic one.  I was a bit apprehensive to install it but
felt like I didn't have an option.  The plastic one was leaking and the
metal one was the recommended replacement.  I have had no problems since
the install back in April of this year.
