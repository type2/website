Howdy,

	The bus got her first valve adjustment tonight.  I'd forgotten how easy
it was! Took me about 20 minutes!  (Next weekend or so I have to do this to 
my 911, which takes 4-5 hours)

	I also fixed my throttle cable, which wasn't quite reaching the carb,
forcing me to do some engineering with wire, etc.  I think this is the
wrong cable for the bus, because someone before me engineered an &quot;adaptor&quot;
at the pedal (underneath) with a bent nail!  I re-engineered this to give
myself an extra inch or so of cable, now things seem to work better.  I
still wanna get a new cable tho...

	Anyway, the nice thing about doing that is that now I actually have
decent acceleration!  This bus books now!  I was only getting about 
1/2 - 3/4 throttle before, and now I have it all!

Thom
