&gt; Howdy folks...

&lt;snip&gt;
 
&gt; Although it looks great, as soon as I climbed underneath I was nearly hit in
&gt; the face by a big fat drop of coolant dripping from the rear skid plate, and
&gt; the reservoir was below MIN.  

Putting on my church lady voice:
Hmmm, now lets see... 80k miles, low coolant level, hit with a coolant drop
could it beee....   BAD HEADS! (not SATAN :-)

In all seriousness,  what you are describing is an engine that needs new
heads. Assume at least $850 parts for the new heads (complete) and go
from there.

Just as a data point, I bought my 86 Syncro in Jan 92 with A/C and the 
weekender and leaking heads at 83k miles for $3000. The rest of the
Syncro was as you described, in perfect condition. 

I think this is a typical case where someone thinks what they own is
worth more than it really is. I'd say $5000 would be a MAX price
for an 87 (8 years old) Syncro w/o A/C and the weekender.

Also, if its always been maintained by the dealer and they couldn't get it
to idle properly, I'm very leary of *that* VW dealer, or they are 
lying through their teeth. The fuel injection system is not rocket
scientry. In fact, with Bently and a decent tool suite, a shade
tree mechanic can diagnose all the components of the fuel injection
system

Well, you asked for opinions, I think you now know mine. One last
peace of advice. Try not to get emotionally attached to whatever
vehicle you want to buy. If this deal isn't right for you, there will 
be another at some point. (I know, easier said than done.)
