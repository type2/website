Ok...its time for a Vanagon/EuroVan grudge match...winner take
all...

Lime Rock Park...July 15 as part of CVAs 10th annual meet...

Here are the rules:

1. there are no rules
2. when in doubt refer to rule #1


Lets put all this &quot;power v horsepower&quot; crap to rest...when the
green flag drops...the bull$hit stops!!

Looser gets to drive a Dodge shitbox for one year!!


EuroVan drivers with ABS go in deeper and come out harder!

T4s 4Ever! The gauntlet has been tossed!!
