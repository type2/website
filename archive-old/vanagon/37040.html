&gt;Hey all,
&gt;While I was parts shopping at the local FL(foreign)APS today I asked the
&gt;counter
&gt;guy if they carried the big chrome VW logo that goes on the front of the bus.
&gt;The guy said &quot;you're not gonna want it when I tell you.&quot;  It was
&gt;$78(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  I told him he was right.  Well, when i receive my WCM and
&gt;RMMW catalogs I will see if they carry them, but if anyone has a spare one
&gt;(yeah
&gt;right) that will fit a '78 bus, let me know and maybe we can work out
&gt;something.

I have a late bus logo, but I don't know if it will fit a '78.  I bought
a bunch of stuff a while ago from someone who had had both a '71 and a
'76 bus, which according to parts catalogs have different logos.  Does
anyone know what is the difference?  It is 25 cm across, has four little
grooved pegs to hold it on, and is chrome or some good facsimile thereof
(could it be stainless steel?).

I don't need it because my bus is a '62 and I alread paid too much
money for a bent, rusty logo  :-(
