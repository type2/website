Subject: SYNCRO shock specs?????


Does anybody have shock specs for SYNCRO vans?  Extended length, compressed 
length, travel.

Monroe has a w3 page at www.monroe_dot_com, and eventhough the part # for the 
rear didn't fit (too short when extended and to long when compressed), i'd 
like to check the specs on the front shock without having to remove the 
front shocks on my van.  Afterall, they were only $36.

relax and spin
