Subject: Re: '56 kombi - brakes (again)


&gt; &gt; My splitty has perfect brakes, once I stop hard a couple of times. The problem 
&gt; &gt; is that if I leave the beast sitting around for a month or more and then go to 
&gt; &gt; stop, it usually pulls hard to the right.  I think that the shoes might stick to
&gt; &gt; the drums a little, or maybe some brake fluid's getting in there. Whatever the 
&gt; &gt; case, a few good hard stops usually &quot;machines&quot; the drums/shoes so that 
&gt; &gt; subsequenst stops are fine.  If I drive it every day I don't get the problem.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Well, since it's come up, what causes that hard pulling when you first
&gt; stop? My '67 has only recently started doing that, and as far as i can
&gt; tell, none of the cylinders are leaking. It pulls really hard to the
&gt; right the first 3 or 4 times I stop, then is fine, then starts to pull
&gt; to the left. What might be behind this?
&gt; Thanks

Yeah, yeah, me too, except my '60 goes to the left.  It just started doing
this a week or so ago.  It clears up after the first few brake applications,
but can reset itself if I pop on the fwy for a half hour or so.
Associated with this new hard-pulling-when-not-used-for-awhile effect is
a whir/metal grinding sound, but it too goes away when the brakes clear
themselves out.  What gives?  Nice to know before I replace the world.
