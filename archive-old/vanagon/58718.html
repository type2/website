Subject: Bumper Mount Bike Racks

Has anyone had any experience with the bumper mount bike racks?  I see JCW
sells them for around $38.  I have thought about recomending it to people who
are looking for ways to mount their bikes to the front of their vans, but I
have refrained because I don't have any experience with these and don't want
to be responsible when the bumper or rack falls off and someone runs over
their beloved bikes.  I think I am going to give one a try but I would like
to get some of your opinions before I do.  I also wonder if you guys think
that the vanagon bumpers are secured well enough to support two bikes on a
rack?  Thanks again in advance.
