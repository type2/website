Subject: 1972 Bus for cheap

1972 VW Bus, white with tan interior.
Body has some small dents, and a small rust hole at the battery tray,
otherwise it is straight.  Interior panels and headliner are original
and intact.
Its TypeIV motor is disasembled and stored in the cargo bay.  It needs
smog and a rebuild.  Currently, it has a 2bbl carb and header exhaust.
$200 or best offer in Costa Mesa, CA.

This one's headed for the crusher, folks.  The owner said that it will
be sold this month one way or the other.  I'd like to see it stay on the
road, but I can't afford to put new smog motor in it.  I'm still paying
off the bill from the new motor in my own breadloaf.  Sigh.
