Subject: Marvel Mystery Oil

&gt;Marvel Mystery Oil - It's a mystery why anyone buys it, the oil
&gt;which does everything, but nothing very well, and no one really
&gt;knows what's supposed to do, or what it was invented for, besides
&gt;our grandparents, who use it for lubing hte sewing machine...
&gt;IMHO...

Salade Marvellieux

Twenty scallions, sauteed
Finest romaine, a peck
Vin Beaujolais, one quart
Vinegar au fines herbes
Marvel Mystery Oil

Toss together all ingredients except the Beaujolais.  Drink the
Beaujolais right down as if it were Thunderbird and spread the
salad over any holes that have rusted through the bottom of your VW,
where it will harden into a nice, servicable floor.

Sorry folks, sometimes I can't restrain myself.  But I promise to
try to keep this sort of stuff to a minimum....

Will
