&gt; Hey Rick, looks like you started something rolling.
&gt; Why not try for a date and a place and see who else
&gt; is interested?  We were thinking of doing something
&gt; over Memorial Day Weekend (May 24-26), if the weather
&gt; cooperates:
&gt; 
&gt; -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - if lots of Oregonians speak up, I'd have no objection to
&gt;   the mouth of the Columbia (Fort Canby)
&gt; 
Well, is anyone making a list? Are there any other interested Oregonians
out there? How about you, Vince?
I suggest Eastern Oregon. Lots of places to explore, and almost
guaranteed sunshine.
Cris.
