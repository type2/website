Subject:      Sony installation &amp; LeBra for sale!

Thoguht I'd kill 2 with one...

FIRST:
how complicated is it to install a stereo; namely a Sony CD player
radio? i am electronically inclined so i can cut,strip &amp; crimp.haha!


SECOND:
I have for sale, made by LeBra; a Vanagon Bra in excellent shape.
Least  I think it is; I kept it nice &amp; cleaned it often.
It's for late models; '87-'91.  I'll ask $50 incl. S&amp;H. (states
only!) It's just about a year old but doesn't look old!
