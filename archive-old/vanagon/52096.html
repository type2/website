Subject: sliding door and hatch screens
Date: Fri, 22 Nov 1996 10:49:05 -0500

My Christmas present to myself this year is going to be screens for the
sliding door and hatch. Does anybody have any input on what is available? I
remember Bus Boy's announcing some and Ian Webb mentioned Triad in NC,
anybody have any experience with these?

Thanks!

tony
