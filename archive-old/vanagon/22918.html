Subject:  replacing engine mounts (q)

it appears that i am going to need to replace my engine mounts (81
adventurewagen), as the rubber has rotted away.  no mention is made
of this that i can see in the haynes manual (can't afford bentley at the
moment).  wondering about what's involved with this procedure, if i can
do it alone with limited facilities/tools/experience, etc..  one shop here
(german automotive) wants $500 for the job, and another (trusted) vw
mechanic 200 miles away will do it for around $350.  that's still a lot for
me right now.  any information/suggestions would be much appreciated. 

thanks, matthew

p.s. - the interior is getting almost campworthy - i made oak-faced
cabinets based mostly on the westy design (except for the top one), and
used the westy bench hardware from a junked (rotted interior) one, and
new foam/upholstery.  after i removed the old seat, it didn't smell like a
couple of cats were living in there anymore.
