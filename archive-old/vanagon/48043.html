Well, it's done! I finished the job last night and drove her to work 
this morning with no problems! Hooray!

MAJOR thanks to Joel and the archive authors! I can't express enough 
how useful the archive articles and this list is. I saved $800.00 by 
following the various procedures provided and taking lots o' care and 
time.

Really nothing to report that isn't in the archive already.

Thanks again!

tony
