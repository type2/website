At some point (perhaps this summer) it would be very worthwile to collect
stats for each vehicle on the list. People like myself, like to play with
the figures and who knows, their analysis could be a component in a book.
After all a sample size of 200 or more is representative of the population
-- so they would actually mean something.
Stats of interest might be, engine life, oil change, mileage, # of
accidents per wife, number of rebuilds per body, major components
broken/repaired etc. DC
