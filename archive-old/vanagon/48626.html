Rich, My 84 Westy seats exhibit the same symptoms.We have suffered for 12
years as you describe. My 87 syncro has larger front seats and could be
swapped with the smaller seat.
As for the A/C....The compressor rear o-rings  where the hoses enter
constantly get crushed down and leak.Ive replaced them 3 times(they will blow
out due to the excess high side pressure due to inefficient condenser surface
area...over 300psi)Id check these out first.The only other place to check
would be the receiver...the oem had a pressure relief plug that will blow
out...but it would be fairly obvious.
