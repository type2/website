On my '82 westy, &quot;The Green LED&quot; is for the fridge (which you don't have). When 
the propane ignites, there is a thermal sensor that ultimately turns on this 
LED. These suckers are sometimes tricky to light, and although there is a tiny 
&quot;flame viewing hole&quot; in the bottom corner of the fridge, the LED is a nice 
touch. 

Maybe you could hook it up to a sensor near your motor so you know when *it's* 
on fire!

&gt; &gt; Also, on the sink cabinet (I have a standard model - no stove or refrig),
&gt; &gt; there is a panel of LEDs.  On the left are water tank indicators and on the
&gt; &gt; right are battery indicators.  Between these there is one green LED which 
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; unlabeled.  No reference in the manuel or elec diagrams.  Anyone know about
&gt; &gt; this one?
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno.  Maybe someone else?
