Subject: Good source book needed for bodywork.



Perhaps someone on the list could help me.  I want to sand down some
of them rust spots on my '84.  Then prime and repaint.  Unfortunately,
when I took a look yesterday things were worse than I had thought.
After scraping of some of the areas I could see that it was necessary to
use some kind of filler material as I will have some holes to contend
with.  Six years in Ithaca, N.Y. were not kind to my van! :-(.  Is
there a good book or reference which can guide me through the appropriate
steps?  I'm planning on keeping my van for a long time and have put this
off for the last time.  Your help is greatly appreciated.
