Subject: 87 Syncro - new engine/same problem

Hello to all,

Around the first of the year I had a Remanufactured engine (by VW) installed
by an independent Service for Vw’s.  This is after trying to fix the old one
with new heads (which didn’t solve the entire problem).  Anyways, I was
really excited with my new Xmas present to myself.  I was under the
impression that my 87 Syncro was finally trip worthy.  

Well, as some of you may know, I had a surfacing Air Flow meter problem which
was causing the bucking / jerking  syndrome.  I was initially dissapointed
because I had the “100 buck wire harness” installed at the time of the core
replacement.  Before finding out that it was the airflow meter, I installed a
new idle regulator (180 bucks) and a new Oxy Sensor (130 bucks).  Although
these parts were probably  needed they were not the cause of my problem.  

After joining the list and working through all possible contributors to my
lurching 87, we narrowed it down to a worn out Air box.    AND MANY THANKYOUS
- to all that helped in this free fix - tearing the meter open and bending
the  wiper arm to make new contacts.

Well, the point of the story is, I was still not completely satisfied with my
new engine.  On the first start of the day (I drive the van 4-5 days a week)
 it would make the tapping sound of a bad lifter.   The engine had only 3000
miles on it.  And after it was warm, there was no tapping at all.  However,
until then, the tapping would come and go until it had finally warmed up
completely.   Ulsers were setting in.

I took it back to the Independent Service that had originally installed the
engine and done much of the work on the Van already.  They did a valve
adjustment, and found that they were “somewhat” loose.  Charged me 50 bucks!
 I was pissed with 3 ulsers.  I bitched and said it should be covered under
warranty, they said Talk to VW America.  So I did.  

VW america said, “Take it to the Dealer”.  By the way,  even after the valve
adjustment, it was still tapping!!!     Welp, yesterday evening, the dealer
called and said, “yes, it was tapping, and guess what, the valves were out of
Adjustment.  65 bucks.  Ooooooohhhhhh.

I called the indepent and said, “look, help me out here”.  He was pissed, at
first at me.  And I put it straight, and told him I had paid good money.
 Calmed him down, and then he became upset with the dealer - who he had
actually purchased the engine through.  He agreed to reimburse me for both
valve adjustments.  

Question:
Does a new remanufactured need a Valve adjustment?
Who do you think is at fault.  
And, Has anyone ever had a “Bad” remanufactured - possibly the same problems.

Thanks to all
