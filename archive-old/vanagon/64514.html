Subject:      HEAVY  Duty Shocks

I've watched and waited but lately, no one has brought up shocks--So
here goes.

My creame puff 84 Westy needs a more stable ride, she needs to toughen
up a bit!

I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific shocks.  I would
like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions and have a
frugal budget.
