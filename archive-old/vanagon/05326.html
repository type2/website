Subject: westy paint Q


I am considering having my '81 westy painted.  It has of course
the typical pop-top, which I believe is made out of some sort of
fiberglass-type material, white.  From the years of exposure,
I notice that the surface has &quot;worn through&quot; in places -
rather than being smooth, one can see the little pieces of
fibers here and there.  

Would like to keep it white.  Does anyone have any suggestion
for treatment for this material?  Should it be sanded and painted
white to smooth it out again, or treated in some other fashion?
