&gt; 	When you say &quot;aluminium sealer&quot; is this a specific product for 
&gt; sealing aluminum or a 'liquid solder' metal-loaded hydrocarbon product?

It was a sealer for aluminum.  It is the same stuff you use for aluminum
gutters.  It looks like chaulking but only silver.  The stuff we used 
(can't remember the name) is in a tube for use in a caulking gun.
