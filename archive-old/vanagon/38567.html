Subject: '67 generator light on longer than should be

Howdy all. My 67 camper, with fresh 1600 SP rebuild seems to have a bit of a
problem with the generator light staying on for about a minute or so after
cranking her up. It always goes off after a short time, and thins only happens
when she's been sitting overnight. Is it just taking time to warm up? is that
ok?
Anyway, thanks
feel free to start convincing me to print the spring List T-shirts...
