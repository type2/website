Subject:      LH Drive to RH Drive conversion

G'day Volks,

I sometimes think of my beast as a suitcase on wheels, t'is in this spirit
that i conceive of the day when I would like to fill the van with &quot;stuff&quot; and
send it and the &quot;stuff&quot; to Australia.

I would then have to convert the van to RH drive.  Considering most of the
big bits are at the rear i have the idea that this would not be such a huge
task.

Has any one done this in reverse in this country.... or in the UK ?

I would like to hear from any one who has had this experience

TIA
