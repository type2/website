VW in their ultimate stupidity did use a low pressure cut-out on their A/C 
systems for years.  Your 85 does not have one.

Well I had my VW mechanic tell me something interesting.

For the longest time I thought I had no freon in my AC system.  However,   
whenever I turned the AC, the compressor would kick in but no cold air.   
 My mechanic tells me that if I had no freon, my compressor would not   
kick in and that there might be something else wrong with my compressor.

Can anyone shed some light?

Thanks,
