 My '80 had a RED color LED for the high beams, drove me crazy until 
I cannibalized a couple of junker dash panels to fix my odometer, gas 
gauge, and now a GREEN high beam indicator light.

&gt; It's been a while, and I'm certainly no electrician (geologist), but I seem
&gt; to remember my 80 Vanagon had a blue LED for the brights indicator.  Am I
&gt; dreaming?
