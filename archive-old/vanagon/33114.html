Subject: My bus hates me...8(

Yesterday I posted that I was making progress on the flat spot. This 
morning, however, she decided not to drive me to work. Temps dropped 
about 40 degrees; &quot;flat spot&quot; is back bigtime. Maybe I'm fishing in the 
wrong pond...that is, maybe my problem has less to do with my timing/carb 
adjustments. Hope you can and are inclined to give advice.

First, let me tell you what I'm calling a &quot;flat spot.&quot; Symptom: Bus idles 
fine. Accelerates while cold. Once she warms up, will only accelerate 
when I give her gas GRADUALLY. In the worse case, I have to sit at a stop 
sign (I'm in Arkansas, we don't have STOP LIGHTS yet, but we're working 
on it) and slowly rev her up and then release the clutch. That's 
unacceptable...and why I turned back toward home this morning.

I have suspected my distributor shaft, but ruled that out. One of the
things I've noticed is that from one run to the next, the timing/rpms
seems not to stay exactly consistent. This also could be (I hope) due to
some slightly stiff components on the carb (specifically, the throttle
valve lever, which doesn't always return completely). I've checked
variance in dwell several times and always come out with little or no
noticeable dwell variance.  (Idiot factor: I did get a variance on one
test last night because the distributor wasn't properly seated. Doh!) I
think the distributor shaft should be okay if there's little (less than 1
degree) variance in dwell (which is at 25) between 1000 and 2500 RPM. 

Could it be the jets in my carb? Should I order new ones and try that? 
(I've never done anything to the jets but clean them out with air. I've 
never seen anything about them that actually needed cleaning, but I 
usually blow through the Air Correction Jet just to make sure it's clear. 
The others I just blow into quickly.)

Any and all ideas appreciated. Thanks! Joe

P.S. I'm sure my bus and I will get through this misunderstanding. Even 
though I sometimes wonder whether or not she *really does* hate me, I'll 
never give up on her. Eventually, she'll come around. (Any chance that 
I'm still not a very good diagnostician?)

Subject: 71:Flat Spot:CB Interference--Making Progress

I replaced the 009 this evening with a vacuum-advanced distributor (a 
loaner) to find that part of the flat spot went away. I plugged the 
vacuum line from the brake booster and found that a little more went 
away. The amazing thing to me is that the interference with the CB seems 
to have completely vanished.

Now I noticed (after a little mental jog from Bob Hoover) that the 009 
had some slickness inside (oil; but not much). I wonder if that could 
have created a little &quot;track&quot; for the spark to find it's way into the 
heart of the bus...that is, into ground, creating the interference and 
impeding the performance of the 009?

Gotta go. Major thunderstorm approaching. Don't want my fingers to start 
feeling like the inside of an oil-slick 009. Thanks! 8) Joe
