Subject: Bosch Platinums, another theroy

It may be that the erratic reports on the quality of platiums, may be that
a bootleg version is being produced.  IMHO the plugs fit the profile. Good
name, pricy, and easy to copy. It wouldn't be the first time.  Maybe
sombody with a iniside line to a Bosch rep could poke around to see if some
kind of code or stamp will tell of a copy or and original plug.

Bosch's stuff is up to snuff, V dub engines are putting out a lot of
horsepower.  No not high hp, a lot of horsepower.  Remember these things
output forty horse or so road horsepower.  That 4X the amount I read on
that gas reformulation article.  So the plugs get the brunt.  Too, keep
this horspower in mind when your considering parts.  These engines really
and I mean really have to have good solid parts. I think more in terms of
an aircraft powerplant when thinking about how to set up my motor.

Ask around, anyone worth their salt will acknowledge, if you plan on
running any motor at a constant forty plus horse, BTW I feel deep down,
some of you are getting close to a constant 50 or 60 hp, you not the
average autoparts buyer. Heck most porches don't get run this hard.  Buy at
the right price, but buy the best you can.  It'll save save save. End of
sermon.
