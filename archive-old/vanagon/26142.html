Subject:       Re: Westy tent. Good buy?

Norm '81 Westy wants to know if a twice used tent is worth $400.

(Norm, you have a funny middle name.)

I've seen slightly older ones in good shape go for $250.  Make sure 
the guy has all the poles, stakes, guy ropes, and bags.  A manual 
would make it sweeter.   Make him set it up for you and look for rips. 
 Pull your Westy up next to it and make sure you can see how it
 attaches to the van.  Counter with $300 and see what he does.

It's a little steep but not too outrageous (how many others have you 
seen for sale?).  Depends on your bread and desperation level.

Out of curiosity, how does the design compare to the ones at
