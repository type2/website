&gt;  Hey Nick, 
&gt;  It is true that those boots last longer..........
&gt;  ................ It is a bitch to change  those things without pulling the
&gt;  engine.  Maybe it's time you graduated to that stage.  VERY easy on the '71.
&gt;
&gt;  Gooday,         
&gt;  Chris   '71 ? ... and assorted bugs.

&gt;
&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt;&quot;GRADUATED TO THAT STAGE&quot;??????  Chris my friend, I unfortunately
&gt;graduated to that stage 19 years ago when I first pulled the engine out of
&gt;a Bus sitting along side Interstate 5 somewhere near Yreka with not much&gt;

now this is living life to the fullest

I hereby nominate nick as this lists certified contortionist!!!!!

&gt;Yeah, I'll probably spend the upcoming Memorial Day Weekend putting the
&gt;silcone boots on by first extracting 1600 ccs of grimy, dirt encrusted,
&gt;stripped nutted, German-Brazilian-Mexican machinery.  Think of me when all
&gt;of you are at the beach having a good time.

everyday is memorial day lately, when will it ever end
