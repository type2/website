Subject: Re: Subaru 2.2 in Vanagon?


Scott Atkinson was asking about transplanting a Subaru 2.2 Liberty (Aus)
into a vanagon.  There's a business on the Gold Coast in Queensland
called Volks Conversions which advertises regularly in the Volkswagen
Australia magazine.  They specialise in manufacturing engine adaptors, 
disk brake conversions kits and fibreglass panels for air cooled VWs. 
The advertisment lists engine adaptors for implanting most popular makes 
of car engines including the Subaru Liberty 2.2.  Vanagons aren't 
mentioned as being catered for but I think they could be worth a try.
The phone number is (07) 5537 7770.  

Cheers
