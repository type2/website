&gt; &gt; Tried water skiing behind one, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; No... Not quite.
&gt; 
&gt; But...
&gt; 
&gt; I was driving on a rainy day after it had been rainy all week.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know the Bayview extension in Toronto?
&gt; Down on the Don River flood plain?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the lower end of it had become part of the river in places.
&gt; As I was driving south, I saw a Ford Aeroscar stranded in a puddle
&gt; (really about 18 inches deep, but a puddle to a VW  :) ).
&gt; Well, I thought I'd show off.
&gt; I pulled up beside her and asked if she wanted to be pulled out.
&gt; She accepted the invite, so I tied a rope to her back end and 
&gt; my van's back end and dragged her out the way she had come in from.
&gt; 
&gt; After untying her, I coiled the rope up on the floor to let it
&gt; dry and was kind of mad at myself for stopping, because I didn't
&gt; want the wet rope draining on onto the floor, getting things wet.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, off I went to cross the &quot;great puddle&quot; (she couldn't get
&gt; her aerostar to aerostart, but I didn't care, I was already much 
&gt; wetter than I wanted to be, And she was out of the river.
&gt; 
&gt; So I drive out to where she was, and continue across the water.
&gt; The waterlevel gets just up to the floor boards, and I think to 
&gt; myself, this is that last low area/dip, and I'm going to start going up 
&gt; again soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I hit the low area/dip....  It's a lot deeper than I had expected.
&gt; The water is right up to thetop of the wheel wells, and is pouring in
&gt; around the sliding door...  And the engine stalls!
&gt; 
&gt; First thought, At least I made it further than the Ford.
&gt; Second thought, No-one's going to pull me outta here, I'm
&gt; the onlyone stupid enough to try somthing like this.
&gt; Third thought, well, the wet rope doesn't matter anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; The water was about five inches deep over the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; So I put it into first and cranked the starter, and the 
&gt; damn thing just kept cranking and cranking for the last 70-80 feet,
&gt; and got me to a shallow spot.
&gt; 
&gt; I openned the door and let the water out faster, but I was stopped with 
&gt; the right side higher than the left, so the water mostly pooled up near 
&gt; the left wall.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried starting it again, but no luck, and I could hear that the 
&gt; battery was getting tired.
&gt; 
&gt; So I go to the back of the van and get everthing off of the engine lid,
&gt; piling it on the seat to kep it out of the water.  Open up the engine lid
&gt; and take a look... Holy steam in the face Batman... That was stupid.
&gt; Now all the windows are fogged up, but at least the Aerostar lady can't 
&gt; see me.  I wipe out the inside of the dist. with my t-shirt, Not too 
&gt; dry, but better than most alternatives.
&gt; 
&gt; Put the engine lid back down, splash my way back up to the front,
&gt; Yes,  Vanagon comes through again... only three cyls. feel like they're 
&gt; firing, maybe only two... but it's trying... I sit and rev it for a 
&gt; minute in the hopes of recharging the batt incase it dies again...
&gt; the remaining cyls kick in...  I'm gone!  Then the stuff on the back
&gt; seat (sleeping bag, mini-compressor, engine lid carpet etc. falls
&gt; into the water...  Ugh... that was stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; I drove home...  Last I looked the ford was still immobile.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank VW for clearance.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I did re-lube all the tranny linkages and everything after the rain 
&gt; finally stopped.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
