Hi folks,

I just got off the phone with Thom Fitzpatrick.  You know, the one
with the great quotes.  Well here's the latest he's asked me to
post for him.

First off, he's got another job.  Yahoo!  I hadn't said anything
about him being let go before because I thought that we would have
gotten another account by now and had let everybody know himself.
But.. the service provider he was subscribing to STILL has not
contacted him.  He sent the money and is still waiting to hear
from them.  So now you know he was let go by his old job and has
since found another which pays him several more bills than his
old job did.  He doesn't know yet whether or not he'll be able to
access the list via his new job or not and he doesn't start for
another four weeks.

So now for the VW content (thanks for bearing with me John S. and
Gerry S.)

This is the update on his '56 Kombi:

The painting is done except for a couple of clearcoat runs which
he is working on now as I type this.

The cargo area carpet is down and done.

All the rubber bits are replaced including new rubber for the 
ventilation which was custom made by him.  (Hot Dang!)

All the windows are tinted.

His been messing with straightening the bumper and may be looking
for another since this one seems to be a basket case.

The freshly painted pop-outs will be going in tomorrow.

Whew!  I'm going to be humbled by his '56 next to my '91 GL Camper
when we share a camp site at the Bodega Bay Camp out (Vanagon group).

His Kombi will be the envy of all.

Sorry my post is not as colorful as Thom would put it, but at least
you've read the latest.

Cheers! 

Steven
