Subject: Re: Help finding an engine

&gt;I am in need of an engine as faithful readers are already aware.  I would
&gt;like to get one that matches the year of my bus (1969).  Does anyone have
&gt;any suggestions?  For junkyard/dismantler suggestions I am in Northern
&gt;California in Stockton which is 1 hour south of Sacramento.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

Get a '71 engine (complete with tin shrouding and carb/manifold) to rebuild
if you can.  The '71 has the doghouse cooler shroud, which puts the oil
cooler out of the way of cylinder # 3's cooling air.  The '71 has dual-port
heads and produces a little more horsepower.  IMHO it's the best engine
setup of all the pre-72's.  And it bolts right in.
