Subject: Re: '78 bus fuel gauge acting wierd

Sounds like your sending unit is loosing part of its range.  If you can cut
metal to make an access hole you can fix your sending unit pretty easily,
otherwise you have to pull the tank, which is a pretty major ordeal to have a
full range of fuel gage.  The sending units cost ~$20 and often need
replacement by now.  If you want to cut metal, I can decribe how to install
an access plate.  Good Luck.
