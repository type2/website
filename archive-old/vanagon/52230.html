&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt; Gene Berg sells a short-shift kit for the vanagon. $20. WELL worth the
 money! i've had it now on three buses and love it. but be SURE to follow the
 directions about marking the position of the base plate BEFORE you start
 loosening it!! :) last time, i figured i was too smart to need to do that
...
 took me two weeks to &quot;adjust&quot; it back to where it should have been. :( &lt;&lt;

  Just finished installing the kit and it works great!  &gt;&gt;


Does anyone know if this will work on a Syncro?  I called the Gene Berg shop
about a year ago and they couldn't tell me if it would work on a Syncro or
not.
