Subject: Re: Westfalia water pumps

Depending on the year of Westy, your pump maybe inside or outside the tank.
 We have them both here at Bus Boys (we get direct from the MFR that supplies
VW &amp; Westfalia).  Pump that mounts on the outside of the tank goes for $59.95
(Our PN 230-10101) and the pump that is inside the tank goes for $49.95 (Our
PN 230-10102).  Both pumps are priced considerably higher at the VW dealer
(of course!).

Do forget to ask for the V_at_L 10% discount! :)
