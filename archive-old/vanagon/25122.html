Subject: VW Vans in National News


Our local paper carried an article entitled: &quot;Owning a VW
bus
can be a way of life&quot;. It was written by Donnie Snow from the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram. There is nothing in the article that
we already didn't know...here's a sample quote&quot; No one buys cars
to work on for the rest of their life. But, when you buy a bus,
there's this mammoth machine in front of you, to mold however
you like.&quot;

The article also talks about NEATO and LIMBO, etc...

If I have a chance, I'll try to get one of my work-studies to
type the article in a file.
