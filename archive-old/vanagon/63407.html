Subject:      Re: Long Term Towing

In a few years, we will retire and will purchase some type of RV and hit
the road fulltime for a few years. At issue is the type of RV package
and my ideal is a motorhome using our Westy as a dinghy. Notwithstanding
that it would look like mother and baby elephant (I have seen this combi
on the road), this combi would allow remote exploration, on a long term
basis, of places where access is limited for a motorhome. Also, we could
continue to carry our kayaks on top.

The obvious is the weight. She tipped the scales at 4190 loaded
including full gas tank and empty water tank. It has a manual tranny.
Would anyone care to give me their 2 cents re this concept?

Thanks, Kit Carter 85 Westy GL
