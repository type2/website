Subject: Re: saw(ed) bus

I saw one of these on the way home from BBTA.  It was in Sullivan, MO 
(also behind an import auto repair shop) and looked to be a '62 or '63.  
It was cut from jack port to jack port ... *very* short.  Would be OK for 
a parade vehicle I guess.  Sad to think that it could have been a nice 
non-sunroof deluxe :(

&gt; said 'home of the world-famous scottsville clowns'.  interesting (not
&gt; really), no further thought was given to it.  on the other side of town i
&gt; passed a small import auto repair shop, and they had one of those
&gt; scrunched buses (only a few feet between the front and rear wheels)
&gt; in front, a splittie no less.  of course i had to stop and check it out, and on
&gt; the engine door was a picture of a hamster in a treadmill, running the
&gt; flywheel. the thing was pretty much trashed.  how repulsively cute and
&gt; depressing, i thought.  must have been some clown's bus.
