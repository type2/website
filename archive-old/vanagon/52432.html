In Russia (&amp; I'm sure many other countrys) it is a *serious* offense to put
a 'small person' in the front seat - very expensive fine  (but they're so
politically incorrect that drivers who have been convicted of any sort of
DUI have to display a special license plate that designates what kind of
driver they are).
