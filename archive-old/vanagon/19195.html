From: starfish ([CONTRACTOR])
Subject: bus for sale

Basic Features:

   Pop-top camper
   fold-out bed
   cots for pop-top and front seat
   ice box
   sink
   porto-potty
   fold-out table
   hanging closet
   various nooks &amp; crannies for storage
   AM/FM cassette stereo

Especially Good Things:

   New engine (1000 miles)
   rebuilt carbs
   smogged
   new pop-top seal
   new carpet
   nearly new tires
   reupholstered seats (no more pokin' springs!)

Not as Good Things:

   automatic (if that's a minus)
   paint's a little rough
   gas guage needs new sender (reads low)
   no Dead stickers ;-)

Price:  $2900

I'm selling it because I bought a '90 westfalia, already have a '74 van,
and &quot;just don't need all those cars!&quot;  [ Direct quote from GF ;-) ].  Right
now I am driving this Campmobile to and from Sun Micro each day (with the ol'
For Sale sign in the window), so call me at 415-786-6849 if you'd like to 
have a look!

thanks &amp; Fahrvergnuegen,
carl
