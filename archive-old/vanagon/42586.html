Subject: Fuel Pump replacement 86 Syncro


     To all,

    My 86 Syncro fuel pump is leaking fuel again. I now have
    a fuel pump off of a 1980 Vanagon.  Can someone tell me
    if they are the same?? They look the same! HA Ha! The local
    autoparts stores are telling me that the Syncro fuel pump
    isn't even the same as a regular 2 wheel drive Vanagon.

    Is there information somewhere that will cross reference
    Vanagon parts for different years and to other models?

                           Thank for any info
                            ERic ZEno
