Subject: Cooling



	A question begging answer-

Has anyone seen, used, heard anything positive about additional air 
ventilation for the engine comp. on an aircooled in the following manner-
	Holes cut through body, sides of engine compartment to be exact, 
with air &quot;scoops&quot; to usher in cool air?
	I am considering a road trip from here (Seattle) this summer 
through Baja (about 5,000 miles round trip), and would think this might 
help circulation... 
	Also, where would one acquire these white plastic scoops?  I have 
a 78 Westy that is due for a paint job in several weeks, and would like 
to have these put on, if I can find them, if they are advisable, and if 
my wife doesn't mind-- she's of the &quot;keep it stock&quot; ilk... I am not.  I 
say, if it'll cool her, let's cut her.  I'm of course speaking of 
Jessamine,uh, my camper...
	Jeff
