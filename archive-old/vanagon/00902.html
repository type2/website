Okay, I asked you guys a week or two ago to help me out with regards 
to my bus in the mountains.  I got a lot of good suggestions for 
things to bring along, etc.  
Now this message has more to do with helping me out than my VW.
well... here goes...

WHAT:
        We're leaving from Omaha, Nebraska on June 1st in a VW BUS 
        and don't plan to return until the second week of July.
        We'll be going through Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming,
        Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New 
        Mexico, Colorado and any states that otherwise get in our way.
 
WHY:
        We're travelling for travelling's sake.  To see new places,
        meet new people, have fun and perhaps learn something on the
        way.  As simplistic as that may sound, it's the truth and
        impetus of our journey.  We'll be heading west, to the
        Pacific coast and back again, interviewing photographing,
        travelogging, drawing and collecting road-flotsam along the
        way.  When we return to Omaha in July, we will put together
        a publication about our experience, good or bad.  Everyone
        we meet is a potential contributor/subject of this 
        publication.
 
        For those familiar with WWW, we'll also be putting together a
        web-bundle for hyperlinkish perusal and scrutiny.  Pictures,
        sounds, words and drawings from our trip.
 
        The reason we're putting together this thing you're
        reading here, this brief &quot;INFO-FILE&quot;
        about our trip is that we'd like to meet as many new people
        as possible, specifically denizens of the Internet.  We're
        also interested in input from anyone as far as interesting
        locales, must-see events, unique and non-commercial
        diversions.
 
        Our route is very maliable, here's the current plan:
 
        - Leave Omaha, head NW to Mt.Rushmore.  Arrive at MR.
        - Hike, view, etc.  Move on to Wyoming, Yellowstone.
        - Reach Yellowstone, camp, hike, write, etc.
        - Head west to Washington.
        - Spend time in Washington forests and visit Seattle
        - North into Canada for a day or two.
        - South to Vancouver, WA area...meet up with friend.
        - Time in Vancouver, then south to Oregon.
        - Day or three in Oregon wilderness, coast, towns.
        - South into California.
        - San Francisco/Palo Alto, meet up with friends.
        - Hollywood area, meet up with friend.
        - Sequoia Forest area.
        - Death Valley and east into Nevada.
        - Las Vegas.
        - SE into Arizona/New Mexico, deserts.
        - Towns, wilderness, camping in Arizona/NM.
        - NE into Colorado, meet with friends.
        - E into Nebraska, home.
 
        The route and plan are variable.  Spontaneous changes and
        alterations will take place.
 
        We're looking for the following:
 
              net-links along the way, places to telnet from
              (24hr user-rooms on campuses, friendly netters, etc)
 
              interesting sites that aren't as clearly marked or
              as widely known.
 
              crash-spaces or tips for inexpensive camping
              (we're polite, don't have criminal records and
              we'll make you famous in our zine!)
 
              tips/suggestions for inexpensive vegetarian travel-food
 
              good musicians/plays/clubs to see on the way
 
              good people and their pets
 
              someone we can beat at bowling, miniature golf or 
              Scrabble
 
              fellow travellers, campers, artists, writers,
              musicians and plumbers
