&gt; hey now,

hey bro.. good day to ya..
 
&gt; just talked to my friend sean, who took a look at my bus today. looks
&gt; like the engine might have run hot this weekend, causing the valve seat to
&gt; drop and a cylinder stoped working damaging the head. now i'm looking at
&gt; whether to a) fix it b) new engine. prices are going to be about the same i

i just went through a head gasket not more than a few weeks ago.. 
mucho dollars for sure...

&gt; thing. any ideas? wow, can words express the feelings i have about this stupid
&gt; vw van? tis a sad day indeed. silly ain't it? getting attached to a van? one
&gt; option is getting a 165hp engine for $2100! hehehe i'm not sure what i'm going
&gt; to do. sean reccommended i keep the van since it's so solid....i will be out of
&gt; commision all this spring, possibly into summer. wow. that sucks. and i have no
&gt; $$$. oh well. such is life.

i've been with my van for five years it is definitely my baby.. all 
best with this no matter which way you go... the world revolves 
around money, eh?
 
&gt; later,
don
