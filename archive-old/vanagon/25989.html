Subject:       Mich. A.E.T.

I recently heard from several reliable sources in the automotive 
business that Michigan is getting rid of all emissions testing as of 
January 1.  This is strange because there has beena hard push to 
extend testing to all vehicles not just those 9 years and newer.  
Does anyone know what they might be up to?  There has been no media 
coverage and I find that really strange.  Some people think that they 
may impliment a complete inspection.  That would take me from 3 
driveable vehicles down to 0.
