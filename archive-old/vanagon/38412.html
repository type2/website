&gt;&gt; for sale 61 transporter shortened by 3 ft...vry attractive and unusual 
&gt;&gt; ..pick up

&gt;It finally happened.  I knew I'd see an ad for one on the list one 
&gt;day.  I just hoped it wouldn't be this soon....

&gt;There reamins only one question:  Is it SANO? 
 

My question is....does it have a Bitchin' Stereo???

Ok...so a second question....Is this pickup a Babe Magnet???
