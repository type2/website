Subject: Re: Air Dam Paint

Ed,
If you want the best look you can get, paint it.  Include a plasticizer 
(flex agent) in your paint mixture.  This will help with rock chips.  
Also allow the paint to cure for at least one month before reinstalling it 
onto the car. This will prevent unnecessary chipping from sand and 
rocks.  Paint doesn't completely cure for at least 30 days, unless a 
powdercoating or other electrical treatment process is used.

Good luck,
