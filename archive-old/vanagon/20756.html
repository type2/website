&gt; I've got the same problem on my '82. I looked into it once, and reached the 
&gt; conclusion that you need to remove the inside door panel. This looks like a 
&gt; major PITA since the plastic fasteners that hold the door panel on seem like 
&gt; they'll break and need to be replaced when you pry them off.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any luck with this operation?

No luck here, of course the inside panel on my slider was missing when I 
bought it. However when trying to free up the rear hatch latch &lt;i'm a 
poet! Natch :)&gt; I broke fasteners and found it difficult to avoid marring 
and tearing the cheap vinyl covering the inside panel back there. Of 
course I was frantically(sp?) trying to open said hatch to access engine 
compartment to figure out why said van wouldn't start at 9pm in the 
middle of a mall parking lot with the wife and kids. So i prob'ly wasn't 
as careful as i could have been.  :(

Of course the problem was_under_the van, as I found out the next am. 
Loose connection on starter.
