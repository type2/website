Subject: '77 Westy Heat Question
Date: Mon, 16 Oct 1995 16:42:29 -0400 (EDT)
From: Jay.Goldberg_at_ska_dot_com (Jay Goldberg)

Hi all

Looking for some help (what else is new, eh?)...

When I acquired Samiam, the '77 Westy, he had no heat.  I determined
some of the missing parts (both heater control boxes, and some other
metal pipes - even made my own barrel clamps to hold the cables to the
flap levers!), put everything together.  Rewired the heater blower
fan, and it now works.

However, I only get a wisp of warmth from the defrosters (no different
if the blower is on or not), and nothing from the front vents for the
feet.

Underneath the bus, in the front, there are these three holes, two of
which have tubing coming out of them.  The center hole has no tubing.
Could this be the tube that brings heat to my feet (oh what a feat to
have heaty feet!)?

Any advice on how to complete the ductwork, and how to make the blower
fan seem like it's on when it's on, would be a real help!

	Thanks
		Jay
