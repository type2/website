Subject: Pre Vancouver trip questions (long)

        Well..Im off today at 5:00 for Vancouver in my 83.5...its second
trip to the lovely city. I plan on doing the trip in 2 days so Ill be
camping overnight in Jasper National Park where my buddy and I will be
consuming many beer while gazing at Hale-Bopp through his telescope. That
way we get to drive thorugh the lovely BC scenery while its light outside
instead of pitch black the next day.
        So last night I took the van to buddies garage to try and remedy a
few of the semingly endless little problems the beastie's having lately.

1) The dash circuit board problem: Found that there were 2 spots that had
gotten 'fried' when a wire went in behind the whole works. My freind
repaired the one circuit and now my dash lights work again, but.....the oil
light still flickers periodically when  the van is idling. Not always, just
sometimes. My mechanic said that this too was related to the circuit board
problem, but it just doesnt make sense. Could it be the oil sender unit on
the fritz or what? I have been checking my oil...topped up and clean...and
the heat gauge above the clock is usually around center, maybe a little over
if Ive been driving for quite awile. Ive also not figured out why I blow a
fuse when I try to use the front and back wipers at the same time. Any
suggestions?

2) My sink pump has died. Anyone know of cost? or used possibilities?

3) Drivers side wiper still not shooting to well. I dropped the resevoir
under the front drivers side and watched while buddy fired the wipers, and
it was pumping fine from there, and shoots fine on the passenger side. So I
tried to get at the T connection thinking that there is something stuck
after the T on the drivers side, but how the heck do you get those hoses off
and out? When I kinda pulled and wiggled the hose while firing the wiper
juice it shot ok...or better at least, so maybe its kinked somewhere. I just
couldnt get at the thing to actually see what was up.

        So hopefully the first camping trip of the year will go well, but if
anyone in Vancouver or Kamloops would want to give me there address phn #
just in case it would be appreciated. I bought some extra just in case
equipment like belts, lights, oil filter and what not, but its always the
things you didnt plan for that go wrong. 
        The last time I did this Edmonton - Vancouver trip my rad got a huge
whole via Mr.Semitruck and I had to drop $500 repairing it..._dot_deleting all
trip funds and ending my vacation early. Plus I got beaver fever on the way
home. If this happens again Im never dribing to Vancouver again. :) Ill just
be the pasenger.

Have a good long weekend.
