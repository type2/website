&gt; Yea, after getting a few more opinions I decided that I can afford it and 
&gt; it will be worth it now for the extra power.

You won't regret it.  :)

&gt; So, I have a week till the new engine should arrive, and I'm planning all 
&gt; the other things that seem so convenient to do at this point:
&gt; 
&gt; remove gas tank to check sending unit.
&gt;      (needle goes to F at fillup then to E after ~50 miles)

Mine goes 100 miles.  Still annoying.  For what it's worth, I got a new
sending unit from the dealer (it was IN STOCK for a 73!) for about $35.
Score one for the dealer.
