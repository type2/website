&gt;Is JCW Joel's initials or JC Whitney?  ;)

&gt;Joel Walker IS JC Whitney?!!???  Wow, a REAL celebrity among us.
&gt;Unka Joel:  why didn't you tell us all before?  Can you...uh...
&gt;like..get us free parts 'n stuff?

&gt;From: rgolen_at_burn-in-hell.umass_dot_edu (ric golen)
&gt;No, its Jesus Christ JOEL, don't you have anything else better to do
&gt;than to put together those damned lists!!!!

i regret to inform all of you that:
1. i am NOT JC Whitney. my name is Joel Calhoun Walker. folks call me
   Forrest Grump.
2. i cannot get anyone any free parts. i need all the parts i have. they
   took some out of me a while back, and i think i miss them already.
3. Jesus Christ JOEL is what my father and brother used to call me ... or
   at least that's what they would yell at me a lot. for a very long time,
   i had a very confusing time at church. i am better now. i think.
4. Asshole is NOT my middle name. it is only a nickname. my middle name is
   derived from my mother's maternal grand-mother's family name, once removed.
   out of 51 first cousins in the family, only two of us got stuck with that
   one. both of us are somewhat shunned by the rest of them. neither of us
   mind very much.

thank you for your support.
joel
