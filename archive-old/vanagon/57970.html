Dan,

That's a great summary you've put together, especially for us novices who
are in the market for a used camper, but have no knowledge of the various
problems in each year.

A couple of questions if you could take the time to reply.  

1. I'm going to see a &quot;77&quot; for sale here in Toronto.  How do I check if
this is your category #5 (75-77.5) or #6 (77.5-79)

2.  What is the difference between &quot;Westfalias&quot; from the 80's that I see
advertised, and your category #8 &amp; #9 &quot;Vanagons&quot;?

3.  What is meant by &quot;Type II&quot; in your categories.

4.  As someone who has no knowledge or ability to do any mechanical work on
the bus, and would have to rely (&amp; pay) mechanics to keep it running, my
reading of your article is that I'd have better chances of avoiding
breakdowns, and when they occur it would be less costly to have repaired,
if I chose a camper of 71-79 vintage rather than something from the 80's.
Would this be your recommendation.


Thanks for your time


Steven
