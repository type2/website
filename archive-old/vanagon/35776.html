Somebody wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;        How about &quot;Shiden&quot;- Japanese for violet lightening. (Figures
&gt; &gt;they'd have names for the different colors, yes?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        Better, &quot;Her Majesty Shiden&quot;?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        Then again, what's wrong with &quot;Purple Haze&quot;?

And then Steve suggested:
 
&gt; The color and the name together, had to come from
&gt; 
&gt;      &quot;Purple Mountains' Majesty&quot;.
&gt; 

Doh!  You mean it's not from &quot;Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she 
doesn't have a lot to say ...&quot;
