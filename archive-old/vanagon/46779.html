Subject: '87 Weekender FS

Not mine...

While driving through Los Banos, California today I saw a nice 1987
Wolfsburg Westfalia Weekender for sale.  Not much info on this (the
shop selling it was closed) but --

It is blue/grey metallic, and the top is painted to match.  It appears
to be in excellent shape, refrigerator still there, etc.  This is the 
Weekender package with the Westy pop-top but no sink/stove, etc.  I
could not read the odometer's first digit, so it might have either
100k or 200k on it.  It has Texas plates, but has the California
emissions sticker, so there would be no additional fine in Calif. 
(where there is normally a $300 &quot;fee&quot; for registering an out-of-state
car).  There is some poor touch up along the vertical seam between
the two rear windows on the passenger side -- no idea what this represents.

They are asking $6900 -- painted on the windshield.

This is at a repair shop which specializes in VW busses in Los Banos
(literally the bathrooms in spanish).  Los Banos is really in the middle
of nowhere -- midway along the interminable stretch of I-5 between
Stockton and the grapevine.  I would guess that some poor person from
Texas broke down in the middle of hell (sorry -- &quot;California's
Beauteeeful Central Valley&quot;) and the shop is recovering its expenses.

Phone is (209) 826-1180, name is &quot;Foreign Auto&quot; (clever them Los Baninos!).

Also seen on this trip -- a nice 9-seat diesel 1982 (the dealer's shop
vehicle in Merced, CA) and a Syncro Country Home pop-top, in Cupertino.

oops -- almost forgot -- the weekender has a manual trans and A/C, and
the Westfaliawerk sticker lists 11/86 as the date of the conversion.
