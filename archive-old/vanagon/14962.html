Subject: Recall procedures for consumers




I'm wondering how to utilize the recall info. in the list archives. There 
are a number of terms I'm not familiar with, and I'm not really familar 
with the process or procedures of recalls. Like, How do we determine when 
our particular vehicle was built.... within a given year, how do we know 
if our particular vehicle is subject to a recall notice, and does either 
the dealer or Vw America have a firm duty to fix the problem or is it 
elective on their side? What if we weren't contacted ever about a problem 
seemingly mentioned in the recall bullentins of the archive?

Below is a sample record applicable to the 1985 Westphalias (I presume) 
which also is a problem I've experienced with the sliding passenger door. 
No one from VW mentioned anything to me. Is it too late? Should they fix 
it still? 

As to below, what is a &quot;campaign&quot;, and where do we find the number 
referenced?

TIA!

1985 Vanagon Built from 1984 Jul to 1985 May
     Campaign 85V152000 No. Recalled: 16,328
     Campaign Notification Date: 
     System:  Door Look. 
     Vehicle Description:  Van-type Wagon and Campers. 
     Description of Defect: The latch of the passenger sliding door may
                            become damaged if excessive force is used
                            to close the door.  The damaged door lock
                            mechanism will not properly engage and the
                            door could open if vehicle is driven over
                            bumpy roads. 
     Consequence of Defect: If this occurs there is a possibility that
                            a passenger could fall out causing injury
