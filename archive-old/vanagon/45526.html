&gt;Which way did you go?  I used to drive this from Atlanta to Lawrence in my
&gt;71 VW Bus when I was a student at the University of Kansas.  Can the 40
&gt;miles that Lawrence resides inside the Kansas border from KCMO feel that
&gt;long? :)  Now Lawrence to Goodland (Colorado state line) is another story
&gt;entirely!

up from Montgomery to Nashville, across to St. Louis, then across Kansas
on I-70. Lawrence is only 40 miles from KC?? no way ... isn't lawrence the
town that's out by the army base Fort Riley???? that's where we went.  and
it was a looooooooong way from Kansas City. :(

i'd have sworn it said &quot;Lawrence&quot; ... but then, i'd been driving for a long
groggy time. i know i stopped at Ft. Leavenworth for gas, cause i was almost
out ... put 16.1 gallons into a Vanagon. :) &lt;it has only a 16.0 gallon tank!&gt;
