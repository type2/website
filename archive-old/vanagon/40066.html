&gt; Anyone have opinions (naah, not here) on electronic ignition conversion
&gt; kits? I have a 71 with a stock 1600 engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically, a fellow 71-er recommended the Bug-Pak from Jacobs
&gt; Electronics. Says it did wonders for his power and mileage. Supposed to be
&gt; smog-legal in California (where I am).
&gt; 
&gt; Upsides? Downsides? Warnings? On this brand or on electronic ignition in
&gt; general.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

I installed the Pertronix Ignitor Hall-effect points replacement module 
in my '79 bus and am happy with it, so far.  Cost: $50.  Compu-Fire 
makes a similar points replacement module, as well as a distributor-less 
electronic ignition for somewhere around $200, I think.
