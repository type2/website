Subject: Re: Replacement speakers for '87 Vanagon

Where do the wires run to the rear speakers?  Someone installed a new set 
of speakers and disconnected the rear Blaupunkts.  i would love to 
reconnect them if only I could find where their wires routed.

Thanks, Tom

&gt; &gt;&gt;Can anyone recommend a good replacement speaker for the front and back
&gt; &gt;&gt;factory installed Blaupunkt stereo speakers? I recently installed a new
&gt; &gt;&gt;Clarion tape deck, but the sound is very tinny, I think because of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;speakers. Also, the front speakers need to be flush mounted because of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the window crank being so close, so that limits your options.

&gt; The Blaupunkt speakers on vanagons are actually very good speakers. The only
&gt; problem is that they are small and sound poorly on frequencies below 250 hz
&gt; (no bass).
&gt; 
&gt; What I did was I bought a pair of 6 1/2 inch subwoofers. I flush mounted
&gt; them below the original Blaupunkt speakers and changed a little bit of the
&gt; wiring. The stereo output will drive the subwoofers directly and a capacitor
&gt; in the range of 150 uf is connected in serial with the Blaupunkt then
&gt; in parallel with the subwoofer. The capacitor is actually two 300 uf ones
&gt; in serial with polarity opposite to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; The result is great. The Blaupunkt is really great when it is driven without
&gt; bass. The subwoofer produces plenty of bass. The combination is great.
&gt; In fact I can play music very loud. There is no distortion at very loud level.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how it looks:
&gt;                                  300uf  300uf
&gt;                                  +        +
