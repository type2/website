Subject: RE:  Good deal?


I paid $800 for my '80 Westy, with number 1 cylinder shot (sucked a valve
seat -- very common story, and quite possibly your story on this guy).
$4900 seems high to me (but I only buy these things if they are a steal).

what is the edmunds list on this thing?  (I forgot their web address, don't
feel like a search...)
