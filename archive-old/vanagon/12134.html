Subject:       Re: brake system vacuum leak


&gt; My 80 Dasher does the same thing....sound like the diaphram is gone away which 
&gt; is located inside the booster unit.
 
&gt; I basically live with that problem on my 80 Dasher.  The pedal gets hard when 
&gt; we come up to a stop sign, but once the engine gets up its rev's, the boost 
&gt; goes back to normal


Thanks for your reply.  My problem sounds like what you describe.  
I would think that the problem is with the booster, as I can hear it 
leak vacuum when the engine is off with just holding the pedal down.  
The vacuum pump can keep up with the booster leak as long as the 
engine is running, so I don't think that is suspect at this time.  

I'll have to check around re parts, etc.  I think this is quite a job 
to replace.  This is one of the first things to wrong with this car 
in 170,000 km, so I guess I can't complain too loudly.

Thanks again.

Harry.
