&gt; Just a few days ago someone wanted to know if there is a difference among
&gt; the various heat exchangers which sell at different prices. He or she
&gt; asked if a $200 heat exc. from supplier X is really better than a $50 one
&gt; from supplier Y. I inadvertently deleted that message and don't even
&gt; remember on what list it was. 

Well, they are $200 at J.C. Whitney.  Can you get any &quot;cheaper&quot; than that?
I wouldn't pay $200 for a heat exchanger if were gold plated.  I think it's
highway robbery.  They are a junkyard item, plain and simple.

&gt; My question is: *where* can you find heat exchangers for 50 bucks??
&gt; At Rocky Mountain Motorworks they are $200 for the bus. If you need two,
&gt; that's $400. I don't even want to know how much VW charges.

Right here.  For $100 I'll find you two at a junkyard and ship them to you. :)
Last time I bought two they were $15.50 each plus tax and core (core?) but
the nice lady at ecology said they were gonna raise the price (probably cause
I buy so many of them).  Still, at that price, why buy new?  Hot tank those
pups and they are fine (as long as they are not rusted).  They don't have
any of the 72-74 ones now, cause I cleaned them out, but last time I was
there they had a nice set on a 78 camper.

&gt; And BTW, why are those suckers so outrageously expensive in the first
&gt; place? It's just a bunch of pipes and sheet metal, isn't it? Not some high
&gt; precision performance part?

Yup.  Just a question of supply and demand.
