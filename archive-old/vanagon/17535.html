Subject: Rev limits

&gt;&gt;Well, I read your posts.  I don't think you should stop, but I'm not Gerry.
&gt;&gt;I find it interesting.  As a post script, what is the redline on my 71 stock 
&gt;&gt;1600.  ie. stock valve springs.
&gt;&gt;

Sir,

Thanks for the support, I'm having a bit of a crisis about my VW technique
here, in spite of my dozen engines and ten years of working on them, I'm
reticent about giving anybody else advice about something I can't seem to
keep on the road myself.  But, I guess I'll try.

My Haynes book says the 50 HP 1600 achieves peak power at 4000 rpm, with
&quot;maximum cruising speed&quot; at 65 mph, which is 3900 rpm with the stock tires.
I can't remember where I saw 4400 rpm, but I'm beginning to think even that
is high for anything but a momentary rev on stock springs.  My older brother
once told me, years ago before I ever started working on engines, that the
VW was designed to operate at full power &quot;continuosly.&quot;  I've believed that
for years, which is why I've never blinked even when following trucks down
hills at 85 mph, or slamming up hills or into the wind with a full load,
foot to the floor for hours on end.  I've tempered that opinion a bit over
the years, but I still think it's fundamentally true, just not over say...
4200 rpm.  It's the valve train that's really the most awesome, driving the
cam directly from the crank keeps the valve timing tight I think.

Eug,
'71
Gerry like's em too, so I guess I'll keep it up.  Reposting this for the group.
