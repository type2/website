Subject: Re: List Bumper Sticker? 

&gt;So Bradley says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think a &quot;prune&quot; symbol (if any) would be the best
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think the problem with a prune symbol is that most people would just 
&gt;&gt; think that it was a turd.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Well it is a turd....just waiting to happen.    ;)
&gt;

I guess I missed the first part.  How'n the heck did we get a prune?
