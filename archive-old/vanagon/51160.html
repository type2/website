Subject: Re: Buses FS (CT/MA/NY area) 1977 Bus in Clinton, CT

&gt;was in primo condition. If it hadn't been such a pretty drive, I think I would 
&gt;have left him in a shallow grave. 

Just in time for Halloween!

&gt;3500 mile claim was off by some 37,000+ miles. The bus is worth under $500.
Its 
&gt;owner is from Mars.

Heheh.  Sorry you wasted your time, Eric.  Let's see, either the guy was a
blatant liar or he was wearing rose colored glasses when he surveyed the
condition of the bus AND he was a blatant liar.

While we're on the topic of exposing sellers, I made a call for a fellow
listmember on this ad I reposted yesterday:

&gt;&gt; 76 CAMPER BUS, sink, stove, refrigerator, front pop top, auto,
&gt;&gt; light green, $750. (203) 481-7122. Branford 

The seller was at least honest about the condition of the bus on the phone,
but the ad doesn't allude to the bus's shortcomings which include:

--160k on the body, 20k on an allegedly rebuilt engine that is now running
on 3 cylinders.
--All the fuel injection stuff is gone, it uses a weber carb (will not pass
CT emissions this way so he drove it with fail sticker during the years of
his ownership)
--Has all the camper interior, but he removed the airconditioning and kept
the parts
--Transmission was rebuilt (hopefully not by the same person who rebuilt the
engine).
--And to save the worst for last:  He says he's letting it go for so &quot;cheap&quot;
because he finished sandblasting 70% of the bus with the intention of
repainting and realized there's more &quot;cancer&quot; than he wants to/can deal
with.  So this poor bus is naked on 70% of it's body (can you say &quot;flash
rust&quot;!!!).

Anyhow, this is the reality behind that ad.  This guy probably wasn't from
Mars since he told the truth on the phone (those stinking Martian liars!),
but I'd say he's from a neighboring moon.  

Good luck with your search for a bus,
Ron
