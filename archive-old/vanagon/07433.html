This has happened in two different ways to us: First problem was solved by
checking out the idle stabilizer and replacing it; second time the
ignition and engine needed to properly grounded AND all electrical
components cleaned. Third possibility - the aux. air intake is
malfunctioning - easy to test - check the Hayne's or Bentley's. DC --
