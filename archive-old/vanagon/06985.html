Subject: anti-theft for diesel vanagons?
Date: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 12:00:00 -0700 (MST)

Hello,
Has anyone considered an anti-theft device for the diesel vanagons?
I mean, not an alarm, etc?  What options are there for these things?
I have considered putting a relay over the glow plug line which would
only allow the glow plugs to heat if the switch is thrown, but there
are probably other alternatives which might be better.
Does anyone have an idea?
Stuart
