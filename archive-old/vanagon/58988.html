Subject: Re: Platinum Spark Plugs for Vanagons

Mark, the Bosch Platinum for the Vanagon 2.1Litre engine is a WR7CP 
plug.  By shopping around I can regularly get a set of 4 plugs for 
under $16 CDN with taxes!!  An excellent bargain.  I've been getting 
2 year service life with these plugs, and *excellent* drivability.  
Wouldn't do without them!! :)

Harry.


&gt; Volks,
&gt; What is the recommended platinum plug for a Vanagon 87 GL. The book show
&gt; platinums not recommended and I can't understand this.
