Subject: WTB Thule Roof Rack Uprights

I have been trying to locate a pair of Thule Roof Rack Uprights 
for a month or so.  Jon Christensen posted a source a few weeks 
ago and I have sent several email messages with no response.

Does anyone have a pair of these uprights they would be interested 
in parting with?  The original part numbers were either 753-0630 
or 753-0630-02.  The uprights were part of the Thule Model 355
Volkswagen Westfalia (Camper Van) rack.  I've spoken with Thule in
both the US, Canada, and Sweden with no success.  

My problem, I'm currently set up to carry 5 bicycles, 1 tandem, 
a buggy, and a rack for tents helmets, etc.  And now I need to set 
up to carry a canoe.  The current production Thule Super High Foot 
interfers with my Country Homes Pop Top, as does the Yakama HiRise 
Mount System and I'm reluctant to mount anything on the pop top 
because of the rough roads that abound here in the North.

Any help or leads appreciated.
