     I also did the best job I could flushing out the water/oil emulsion 
     from the cooling system--what a mess! Then I drained the radiator and 
     engine, and refilled just the engine with a 50/50 mix of antifreeze 
     and water.

     I seem to recall a fairly extensive procedure being required for 
     diesel engines that get coolant into the oil.  something to do with 
     the ethylene glycol/oil/diesel combination as being particularly hard 
     on the bearings....hard enough to wipe 'em, if I recall.  Diesel 
     bearings are under some serious loads; 22:1 compression ratio, 
     don'cha'kno....

     Thanks for the input. I should be OK, though, since there is *no* 
     coolant in the oil, just oil in the coolant. Engine starts and turns 
     over just fine. I will be changing the oil and filter when I install 
     the new cooler...I'll look for any coolant residue in the oil then.
