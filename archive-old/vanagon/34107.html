Hi all, just caught the C4 prog that had a feature on the VW Van addiction -
filmed at Vanfest Malvern Englang last Sept. Excellent shots of Bays and
Splits and a good range of interviews with all of the VW types too :)
nice to see a prog that showed the VW Nation from the load and low to to
speadfreks to the customised to the family runabout to well all of us were
there! (well in spirit!) 
Seriously nice to see a prog on TV that captured a feel in just a short five
mins -- the retired couple's home movie doing that river crossing in Africa in
 a Bay was truly amazing. Good one.
