Ellis agrees with Ron's suggestion.

I still think the whole thing is nuts. All I need is more surface area to
slow me down. Driving my Vanagon is like pushing a 4'x8' sheet of plywood
down the freeway~! =) 
I need a flippin sail or something.  I would attach a 4'x8' sheet of clear
plex set on a 30 degree angled and attached to the front if it weren't for
all of the skateboarders in my neighborhood.  Possibly an electro magnet to
attach to trucks as they pass. This might finally be a suitible use for the
silver socket!

A safety note:  Keep all appendages/digits clear of the silver socket!!!
