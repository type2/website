Subject: RE: 87 Syncro CV Joint/ Spares List

In fact, how about generating a cross referenced parts list for the
Vanagons, something to go into Coyotes FAQ site.  Nice to know that a fuel
pump from a ???? will work in a Vanagons etc.  Sort of list that I'd like
with me heading of into the great unknown.  Perhaps the vendors who grace
this list could put this together from their catalogues/sources?

Fuel pump for any type two, beetle, and early Ford Escorts will fit and work 
fine.
