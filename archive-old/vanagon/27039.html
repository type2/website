James Brill's idea of painting cars on the roll is great!  &quot;Drive thru,
scmive through -- we'll paint your car While You Commute!  Call in your
Mastercard number and your route to work.  When you see our paint-mobile,
hold up one finger for red, two for white, three for black, and four for
the special of the day.  Please remember to keep your wipers on until our
driver signals that your new paint is dry.&quot;
