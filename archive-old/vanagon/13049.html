So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; I readjusted it to 7.5 _BTDC_. Runs real well at speed, but still will not 
&gt; idle worth a *$%^$.  Running real cool as well.  I don't know why the 
&gt; manuals say _ATDC_ for the timing.  Muir said that on his 71, with a 009, he 
&gt; timed it at 7.5 but it doesn't say wether it is BTDC or after.  Didn't I 
&gt; have it retarded to far, that is a later spark, or do I have my nomenclature 
&gt; mixed up?  Does anyone want to tell me about the Carb or am I on my own there?
&gt; 

Okay.  Yes I confess, I had to double check for 7.5 BTDC but as you found,
Muir doesn't specify before or after, but I swear I'd read it somewhere 
in there and that's how I set mine when I had my bug.  

So now that you have the timing right, your idle problem can be traced
to possible a vacuum leak.  How new are the gaskets for the carb seat
and the manifold?  Make sure they're good and tight.  Also the throttle
plate may be out of adjustment.  Make sure it's at the right gap.  Check
all of your hoses and make sure there are no leaks.
