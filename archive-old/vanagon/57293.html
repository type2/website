Subject: Re: In Search Of Syncro-Westy

Shawn,
	I don't have a syncro westy, but I do have a 90 westy for sale if
you're interested.  1990 white Vanagon Westfalia, 97,000 miles, AC,
cruise, power windows, power locks, PB, PS, alloys, all the camping gear
works great, runs great, has new CVs. I'm selling it because my dean has
decided to move my job to the main campus in Charlottesville.  I'd
rather sell my toys than my house. 

I know its not a sycnro, but if you're interested, give me a hollar and
I'll tell you more.  $12,500.  Home 540-343-3829, office 540-857-7922,
e-mail ian_webb_at_virginia_dot_edu

&gt; lots-O-Love.  Want one that has been taken care of and in excellent
&gt; condition.  Distance is of no concern for the right Westy.  Please let me
&gt; know if you have one available.  Thank You
