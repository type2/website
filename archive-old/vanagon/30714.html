Subject: water leak underneath dash when it rains

My 84 van leaks.  I see water dripping off my fuse box underneath the left
side on drivers side.  I don't see water coming out anywhere else.  It's
starting to make my electrical system do wierd things.  Where do I start to
look for this leak?  Who else has had this problem? and what did you do.  
Thankyou
Fred
It looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon.
