Subject: A true engineering hero: George Goble

An article on the Telecom Regulatory Grapevine (TREG) mailing list
directed my attention to the engineering professor at Purdue University
who holds the world's speed record for lighting a barbecue, and who
describes the process roughly as follows:

- take a large barbecue
- put a burning cigarette at the bottom
- put 60 lbs of charcoal on top
- using a bucket at the end of a pole, pour 3 gallons of liquid oxygen
  over it
- 3 seconds later, 40 lbs of the coal will have burned, and the grill
  is ready. (It will also be very clean: All old grease will have burned
  off).

Imagine supplementing the fuel with a magnesium wasserboxer cylinder head!

Remarkably, though, this man's talents are quite varied. In 1981, he 
designed a multiprocessor version of the VAX-780, which was put into 
production, and spawned several mini-super-computer companies. And 
recently, he designed a environmentally safe drop-in replacement for
freon-12, with better efficiency than the -12. This is sold as the
Autofrost GHG R-406A.

Has anyone on the VANAGGON list used this ?
(Does anyone on the VANAGON list have an A/C where the leaks are slow 
enough that they even bother to keep it operating ?)
