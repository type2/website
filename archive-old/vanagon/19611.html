Subject: '87 Westy water pump/fridge relay ?
Date: Sat, 24 Jun 1995 06:09:36 -0400 (EDT)

Yes, you read that right, relay for the water pump/fridge main power line.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS RELAY ALL ABOUT ?   Sorry for the shouting but this
one does not make any sense to me.  In the storage box under the drivers
seat of my '87 Westy there is a relay sending power to the camper
waterpump and the fridge.   The damn relay is in the way of putting stuff
in the storage box and it got hit and shorted out frying all the wires to
the main fuse box under the dash and even fried numerous wires that were
near by under the dash.  After spending several hours cleaning up the mess
and replacing and repairing all the affected wires I went to my &quot;Friendly
Neighborhood VW Dealer&quot; to get a new relay, after the shock of hearing the
$95 price for this relay and complaining loudly the service people finally
came up with another relay that would do the same job for $30.  How about
that ?   Well, even $30 is a bit much for a simple relay don't ya think ? 
Anyways, I go put the relay in and find that the relay is &quot;on&quot; all the
time and can not figure out why the relay is there in the first place. 
I've looked in the Bently wireing diagrams and there is no relay
indicated.  A call to the local dealer service dept. to have him look in
his wireing diagrams and nothing showing there either.  The relay does
look as if it was there from the factory as all the connectors seem to be
official VW type connectors and all the wires going to the fuse panel
under the dash go to coded conennectors.  So, I presume that it was not
some PO yahoo that installed this thing.  But why would VW put a relay in
a line that needs to be powered all the time ?  There is no need for this
relay as far as I can deduce.  Anyone out there come across this before or
know of what I speak ?  HELP PLEASE !  It's driving me crazy or maybe I've
always been like this and never realized it before.

Cheers 

Frank
