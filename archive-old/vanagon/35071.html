Subject: FS: 83 Two-Tone Blue Vanagon

This is an extra vanagon sitting in my driveway. It needs a little work but
runs pretty good. Body is in good shape, very little rust, only minor dings.
Interior is blue and nice. Has rusted gas tank, but I have another one in
another vanagon to replace it. The tranny crunches going into 3rd but works
fine other wise. Shifter needs some adjustment. This could be a nice van
with a little time and attention. I dont have any to spare right now. Gotta
have $1000, non negotiable. If I cant get a grand for it, it can sit there
till I have the time to work on it. It is located near Indianapolis, Indiana.
