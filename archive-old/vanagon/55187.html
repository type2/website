Subject: Vanagon Heat Vents.....

Hi Gang,

I have a 1987 Syncro Westie.  When the heat turned on, heat comes out of the 
vents up front.  If I open the fresh air vents (the ones that can be 
redirected) on either side, Cold outside air comes in.  My parents-inlaw have a 
1990 Multivan and when their fresh air vents open and the heat is on, warm/hot 
air comes out.  Whay gives???  Did VW get smarter and add more vents for heat 
to keep the windows clear.  I would be interested in hearing if others have 
noticed this.  Is there a valve that I am missing in order to redirect heat to 
these vents.  I checked all of the piping but have found nothing...  

Cheers
Tony
