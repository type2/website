Subject: LAZY SPEEDOMETER II



This is a second appeal for advice regarding my speedometer.  I received 
some responses seeking whatever info might come my way, but none of said 
info.  

SYMPTOMS:
	speedometer does not register unless given a good thump on its cover,
	then it works fine.  Not temperature related (I once speculated that
	it was frozen to the 0 MPH peg), not noisy.  Occasionally 
	operates without thump.

Many thanks for your help.  I suppose I am lucky that this is the most 
severe problem with my van, excepting the balance on the loan...
