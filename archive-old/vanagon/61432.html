Subject: pop top seal....  solution?

so i think ive come up with a  relatively painless compromise to the
 drooping pop top seal problem that happens when the steel clips inside the
rubber seal rust out.  all i did was to  remove all the old rusted clips.
 then push the seal back on.  the rubber alone holds its shape pretty
well...and when i get more ambitious...ill lay in a bead of silicon between
the top edge and the fiberglass top.  so after months of wondering what the
best way of dealing with it was...i was pretty pleased with the result.;)  no
cost..little fuss...and its still the original rubber seal...which ive heard
is better than aftermarket seals in reguards to wind noise.
