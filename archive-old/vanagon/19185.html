Subject: Re: fix the plug!!!

Out of paranoia of this very thing happening to me, I always use a little 
anti-seize compound on the threads of new plugs. Of course this tidbit of 
information does absolutely nothing to help those of you that need a few good 
words of wisdom the most!

&gt; &gt;If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  That cylinder could easily be worse off
&gt; &gt;after you 'fix' it.  Inserts often leak and the metal shards you'll
&gt; &gt;inevitably get in the engine will not be helpful.  Although at least # 2 is
&gt; &gt;easier to get to, on my engine.

&gt; That was my thought.  I had the engine stripped down to the long block, and 
&gt; applied heat, WD40, and everything else I could think of.  I couldn't get it 
&gt; to budge.  I'm not going to try to do anything about it until I have to.  
&gt; 
&gt; In response to those who said that the life of the plug depends on many 
&gt; things: I might add that the compression is 130-135 all around, and I 
&gt; replaced the other plugs with platinums.  The motor burns very little oil, 
&gt; like less than a quart every 2000 miles.  It leaks a couple of drops too.
