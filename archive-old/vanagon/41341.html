&gt;I am trying to remove the engine from a 79 van.  The right rear piece
&gt;of tin will just not clear the motor.  I have removed the alternator
&gt;pulley, I have removed the blower cage.  The problem appears to be the
&gt;heat shield that is under the main part of the tin.  Any ideas,
&gt;anybody.  What am I missing?  Thanks for any help.

You need to remove the tranny mount from above the bell housing.  Then the
engne and trans can tilt down and then the engine can be pulled out from
under the van.  There are two bolts that hold this mount to the trans, they
are reached from underneath (15mm) and the nuts are welded so the bolts can
be re=moved easily.  I also disconect the shift linkage so it does not get
bent from the trans tilting dowm.
