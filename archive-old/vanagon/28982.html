Subject: Re: Westphalia Top Speed

All,
	I guess readers are interested in top speed in our buses.  I've 
driven all day at 70 -75 mph in a '67 bus 4.12 rear SP 1600 engine.  Top 
speed is about 85 on the speedo.  I feel that these speeds are ok, but 
operating costs can really increase.  If you cut corners on your engine, 
things will break at these speeds/RPMs/loads.  I usually drive 55-65 MPH 
on US hyways.  Your machine will tell you what is right and works.  
Listen.   Gary Gibson
