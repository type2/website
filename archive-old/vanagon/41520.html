Hi, Ben

I had a similar problem in my '77 bus.  I gave it a tune-up, drove
it around for a week, and then headed up to Canada from New Jersey.
I got about 4 hours into the trip, and the bus died.

After a couple of tows and failed attempts to reset the timing, I
determined that when I had adjusted the distributor to set the timing,
I had not tightened it *quite* enough to stay in and it wiggled up
a little on the drive in, which made the car untimeable.

Of course, I now don't know how tight is tight enough...  I have since
twisted off the adjuster bolt and had a new one put in.  The bus has
been running fine since then (September).

Good luck!

&gt; I need help in Tacoma, WA with my '78 FI bus!  I'm supposed to take a 
&gt; friend home to California, and another to Colorado at the end of the week 
&gt; before returing myself home to Texas, but the bus is not healthy for some 
&gt; mysterious reason, and I need help to get on the road by Friday afternoon..
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the story:
&gt;   Last night, I tried to take my girlfriend out to dinner, and as I give 
&gt; the van gas to back up, it dies.  I restart and try again, and every time 
&gt; I give it gas, it dies. &quot;Hmmm...&quot;  Thinks I, just before borrowing a 
&gt; friend's car for the date.
&gt; 
&gt;   Earlier in the day, I had reset the point gap.  Today, I again checked 
&gt; the points (seem fine), then the valves (again, fine), then I replaced a 
&gt; vaccum tube that I had duct-taped, then I put a new gasket on the 
&gt; air-intake maifold for #3 and #4.  Now, it runs even wors, like it's not 
&gt; firing on all four.  It also dies whenever I press on the gas.
