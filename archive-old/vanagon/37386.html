Subject: Re: '88 lurching at 2500-3000 rpm


&gt; for some reason, i was thinking they bent it outward, not inward. might want
&gt; to ask the list and get the opinions of them what has done it. but i think
&gt; that the cleaning would be a good thing. i think you can get some &quot;cleaner&quot;
&gt; in a can from Radio Shack or any good electronic wholesale place.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;How do you adjust the idle? Mine is at about 1100rpm &amp; surges from
&gt; &gt;1000-1250 or so regardless of temperature. I'm thinking this may be
&gt; &gt;another cause for the surging - is this likely?
&gt; 
&gt; hmmm. that sort of surging is usually associated with the coolant temp
&gt; sensor ... the blue sender gizmo on the thermostat. it's a $12 part (don't
&gt; forget to get a NEW o-ring with it ... another $2!!!). it's telling the
&gt; engine that the coolant isn't warm yet. maybe.
removed the connector &amp; idle went up right away (engine hot). When 
given any throttle, engine sounded like it was choked (running rich) 
&amp; almost stalled. Back to normal when plugged back in. I guess this 
means the sender is OK??

&gt; another possible surge cause could be the adjustment of the throttle switch.
&gt; if the engine seems to idle ok with the throttle cracked just a tiny bit,
&gt; this might be the cause. it's the little gizmo located on the air intake
&gt; plenum (the silver &quot;spider&quot; just to the left of the air flow meter) and
&gt; down kind low, near the throttle cable connection. it has a small adjusting
&gt; screw (and it is EASILY damaged!! be careful) which should be set at the
&gt; factory and blobbed with wax to keep people like me and you out of it!! :)
Didn't seem to matter if throttle was touched a bit, although there's 
a vey fine line between idle &amp; 2000rpm... Wait a minute - you said 
switch... hmmmm. I looked everywhere, but there is NO switch anywhere 
connected to the throttle linkage - just a standard set-screw type of 
thing. My Jetta has these switches for idle &amp; full throttle, but I 
can't see any here - it loooks pretty much like my old CIS injected 
Scirocco... Is it possible this switch has been removed???

&gt; another surger cause could be the idle mixture air valve ... on the rubber
&gt; boot that goes from the air flow meter to this silver spider, there is a
&gt; smaller rubber hose that runs off toward the back of the bus. it eventually
&gt; goes to the crankcase breater thing in the middle of the back of the engine
&gt; (back is back). somewhere along that hose is a thing with an electrical
&gt; connection. it looks like a metal cylinder stuck off at an angle to the hose.
&gt; this thing works like a PCV. sort of. when the engine is cold, it's supposed
&gt; to allow more air to recirculate, and raise the idle. you might try removing
&gt; it and cleaning it with spray cleaner (or brake cleaner) to remove any
&gt; gunk and stuff inside. several folks have reported smoother idle after doing
&gt; that.
&gt; 
&gt; and lastly (that i can think of), check all the electrical connections on the
&gt; engine. especially the ground strap over by the ignition coil ... make sure
&gt; it's connected tightly on both ends. and over in front of the right rear
&gt; taillight (we got &quot;front taillights?? :) there is a bunch of relays and such.
I checked all the plugs I could find, but no relays aside from two 
inside a box over the coil... Are they in a different place on an 
'88? With those under the dash maybe?

&gt; the big one is THE idle stabilizer what controls your idle. you might pull it
&gt; out (it's a bear to get it off that plugboard) and clean the contacts and
&gt; put it back. one fellow said that cured his idle problems.
&gt; 
I'll pull all those under the dash &amp; clean just in case..

Thanksfor all the info so far...!

Shawn.



 good luck.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
