Subject: Re: '81 Westy power from key

&gt;I was replacing the (broken) stereo on the '81 I got recently, and I
&gt;noticed that the wire the PO ran to the stereo (aftermarket) goes hot when
&gt;you INSERT the key into the ignition.  You don't have to turn it.  Should I
&gt;connect to a different spot?
Since VW decided that an accessory position on the ignition switch was
unnecessary the wire you found is an easy alternative. If your stereo is
very sensitive you may want to have that wire control a relay which
switches the power to the radio. If you're also running an amplifier you
probably should. If you don't mind turning the radio on manually every time
you get in. Then hook it to a hot all the time wire or a hot with the
ignition on wire. HTH
