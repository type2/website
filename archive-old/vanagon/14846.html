G'day, eh?

Wanted to let you know that the Campmobile is back on the road today 
after a hiatus since last Wednesday due to broken rear carrier bolts.
Pulled the thing home from work on Saturday, and was pleasantly 
surprised to find the bolt stubs rather loose in the case, so tapping
them out was no problem. Spent most of Saturday afternoon looking for
a new breast plate, isasmuch as the old one had been rather squashed
between the rear carrier and the crank pulley. Not being sucessful, 
I hammered out the old one and it seems servicible in the short run, 
anyway. Sunday I spent with the family (my SO is getting tired of
weekends planned around working on the bus, and for once I agree).
Monday evening was spent putting the exhaust and rear apron back on.
The drive to work this morning was enlivened by the driver hanging 
his nose out the window trying to determine whether that burning
smell was just hand oils burning off the extractor or something more
sinister (the thing announced that the last mounting bolt had broken
by burning the fan belt). So far, so good!

Can anyone come up with a source for a post-68 breast plate? The
catalogs have the pre-68's (smaller and squarer on the right side)
but no later ones, and the the junkyards I visited had the small
ones as well, but no late ones.  I'd be willing to trade a 10mm
8.8 bolt for it (I bought three before realizing the lower one
was 8mm).

As the guys at Esso used to say....Happy Motoring!
