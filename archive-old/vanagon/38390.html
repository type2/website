Subject:  re: The Glowing Letter (inuvik trip)

a guy from work just got back from Inuvik, the price of gas there right now
is $0.829/litre or $3.14/(us)gallon. depending on the exchange, that would
be about $(US)2.30/(us)gallon. is this really too expensive?
in Whitehorse right now, gas is $0.65/litre, $2.46/(us)gallon or 
$(US)1.75/(us)gallon.
you will probably find worse on the way to Inuvik, if you look, but planning
will help you avoid REALLY expensive gas (take a jerry can so that you can
make it to the &quot;major&quot; gas stations)

i looked up the Inuvik trip Home Page, and it looks very cool...i can't
remember if there was mention of it, but there is a very big Northern
Native Arts festival in Inuvik during the end of July, i think July 19-
July 28...also Northern Games (Inuit games...) and the gal from 
Inuvik said something about the True North Concert (Northern Native music)
all at the end of July (can't remember the itinerary)
(1-800-661-0788 is the phone number for western arctic tourism or something)

ALSO
the Inuvik trip will just miss the Dawson City Music Festival...which is the
big thing up here in the summer, lots of canadian music...but that's the second
weekend of July or something...(people are ordering their tickets NOW, before
they sell out)

oh, yeah, i forgot the point of this...
the point is that American money is worth WAY more than Canadian, so, buy lots
of stuff (i don't even work for tourism)
