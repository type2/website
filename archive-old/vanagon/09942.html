&gt;I think the majority of us in the Pacific Northwest live in WA.W, right?
&gt;(With a few in BC/OR.) The travel distances would be fairly short, I
&gt;would think. And everyone would get to see the `66 bubbletop camper
&gt;with the `76 Pinto taillights! (I DID NOT DO THIS!!!) And it would give
&gt;me some incentive to put the new transaxle in, so I could make the trip!
&gt;

Just got around to reading some of my backlog...

Suits me, but if its not a weekend its got to be first week of April.

Here are a few ideas for locations:
La Push. (I like the coast, don't know if there is electric though).
There's a campground area on 1st Beach, not far from 2nd Beach, etc.
Ft Worden (the park by the lighthouse - there are RV hookups there but lots
of pavement too. Still, there is the hill behind it, potential for beach
fires, good exploring, and with enough people would probably be fun)
Ft Flagler - haven't been out there but I've heard enough that it has potential.
Deception Pass - basic campground. Nice before Memorial Day. Downside is
those A6 jets testing out carrier approaches w/ afterburners (aka &quot;The
Sound of Freedom&quot;) sometimes.
There is another park on 101, south of Quilcene, right on the water. Can't
remember the name right now though.
Any idea if Heart of the Hills is open at this time of year?

Other places in the mountains that I know of are probably not the best to
go to at this time of year. (Flooding, snow, mud, slides, etc.).

That's my US$.02
