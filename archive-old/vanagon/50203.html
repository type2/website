Subject: Re: Westy camper top mods for a Syncro GL?




&gt;This summer I've been doing alot of van camping in my 87 Syncro GL and I 
&gt;want more room.  What I'm considering is getting the camper top from a 
&gt;thrashed westfalia and having it put on my Syncro.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone from the list ever done this, know somebody that has or know of
&gt; a shop or person that does the modifications.  


I have a good Westy top and canvas for sale from an '85 that was hit.  (I 
also have the complete Westy interior, if you are interested).  I am within 
driving distance of you, in southeastern Pa.
..
I know of a local fellow who converted his '86 Vanagon to a Westy. He 
installed all of the interior parts (they simply bolt on), and then cut a 
hole in the roof and put on the pop top and the top bed.  The factory 
design has one of the curved roof beams cut and replaced with a flat beam 
(which, I imagine, would be difficult to do yourself).  However, this owner 
simply left the factory roof beam there .  The bed sat behind it, and he 
said it worked fine that way.
