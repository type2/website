Subject: m.fische reader FS


I happend into a store today which has a used Bell and Howell micro-fische
reader for sale, and thought I'd mention it on the list, in case anyone
is interested.  They said they would ship.  It's at:

Discount Tools
1601 Contra Costa Blvd.
Pleasant Hill, CA  94523
510.676.3885, or fax:  510.676.7110

Ask for Julie Davis.

The price was, I think $139, which is far less than I would have guessed
one of these things cost.
