Subject: Bus Abouse, er Abuse


	This weekend I think I set a personal best for abusing my
bus.  Three bikes and a Mini-Baja roll cage strapped to the top
of my roof rack.  Inside, three people, 6 tires, two tool boxes,
luggage for three for the weekend, etc etc.
 
	I can't believe the thing would still do 60-65 on the interstate
hauling all this crap. 200 lbs on the roof alone...

I really like my bus :) 
(once I start getting over 12 mpg, I'll like it more)
