Subject: Camping suggestions in Vermont New Hampshire?

I finally got my '84 Westy running, put the engine from my '85 in it,
smogged, registered, insured, and my son and I are leaving next thursday to
drive cross country from SF Bay Area to new York. Our first stop will be
Isle Royale at the top of lake Superior, I love marathon drives, and I've
seen most everything i want to see west of there. After a couple days on
Isle Royale we're heading to Montreal, then down through New Hampshire and
Vermont, where we'll take some time camping.
	I'm looking for suggestions on favorite sites in that area. What
i'm looking for is someplace scenic on a lake where we can rent canoes.
those are about my only requirements, except at least pit toilets.Any one
have any ideas?
tia,
Don Kane
