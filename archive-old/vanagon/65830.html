Subject:      LIST MUGS INFO!!

(note- these feature the old Vanagon list address, but have the current type2
address, and are still every bit as cool...)

  Howdy all! For those of you searching for that perfect container for your
favorite beverages, let me present to you- the List Coffee Mug! Here's all the
information below-
but first a little disclaimer for the many newcomers who may not have heard
about me and my official list merchandise.
  I am in no way a professional merchandiser or printer. I am NOT doing this to
make money. Rather, I'm just a struggling college graduate who loves Busses, as
well as the neat people who drive them. I also like neat bus stuff, like
t-shirts, stickers, and all that stuff. So, over the last couple years, I've
printed and sold t-shirts for the Bus Lists. People send me the orders and
payment, I buy everything, and mail it out. I've never (knock on wood) been
burned by anybody, and in general tend to be very trusting. Anyway, over 100
folks out there in list land have received, and been pleased with my stuff in
the past. So, if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask someone.
  One reason I am mentioning this is that the prices for these mugs are
probably more than you would pay in a store. The main reason is this- I'm
ordering *very* small quantities.
 Printed merchandise is pretty cheap when you order 1000 items, or even 200,
but
when you order less than 50, it gets expensive... So, please bear that in mind.
I actually have certain minimum orders to fill, otherwise they won't print
them...

OK-here it is:

1. Classic 4-bus Netvergnu:gen ceramic coffee mug. This is the same design as
    the list t-shirt, with front views of all 4 generations of busses. The
    design has 4 colors in the busses, and wraps around the mug. (the front
    views are all side by side, instead of 2 by 2) the words &quot;Netvergnu:gen&quot;
    and the Vanagon_at_Lenti address, and the http://www.type2_dot_com address are
    printed above the design. This is a standard sized, white, ceramic coffee
       cup, nice for home, office, or wherever. I have to sell 144 of these, so
    feel free to order several!!!!

Pricing-
   The mugs run  $7.50 each, plus shipping and handling, for a total
   of $11.50.

Non-USA orders please note- I need US cash from you, please, well-hidden in the
envelope. I also have to add $4.00 for foreign postage as well...

Ok then, here's how to order:
Send a check or money order payable to Richard Palmer, and an index card with
your name, address, e-mail address, and number of mugs ordered to:
Richard Palmer
121 - C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC
27605-1832
USA
The costs are again:
Mug 1 - $7.50 + $4.00 s/h = $11.50
Non-USA orders please add $4.00 for foreign postage

I realize this may seem a bit high, but that comes from not ordering thousands
of mugs at a time...
(If anyone is ordering several mugs, like 5 or more, there will probably be a
break on the shipping)

****STICKERS**** may be ordered at the same time, and will be sent in the same
package. Prices on those are 3 for $5.00, and 7 for $10.00

Anyway, please allow for a few weeks for order processing by my expert staff
(me), and I'll try to get them out as soon as I can.
Thanks!
:)
