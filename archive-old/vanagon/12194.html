&gt; How much are those awnings that are attached to the side of the 
&gt; vanagons?  We would love to have one for our Westy.  Does anyone know a 
&gt; place in So. Cal. that carries and installs them?
&gt;

Here is some price point data:

Vantastics
829 Norwalk Street
Greensboro, NC 27407
(910) 547-0144


Awning-Automatic/11'6&quot;		$316.50
Awning-Automatic/9'8&quot;		$294.10
Awning-Automatic/8'		$268.30


I have no connection with Vantastics and have never actually seen one of
these awnings.
