Subject: Re: (?) rear bumpers same on '63 and '66?

as far as i know the back bumper should be the same between 63' and 66',
either that or the changes are so small that only a real fanatic would know
the differences.

&gt;&gt; Subject line says it all, Dave Schwarze has a line on a '63 back bumper
&gt;&gt; and I need one for my '66.  Are they the same??
&gt;
&gt;On the same thread, I called this guy and he still has the bumper.  He
&gt;described it as having &quot;no damage except for two small dings&quot; and &quot;only
&gt;light surface rust&quot;.  I haven't seen it yet, but I guess I will go look
&gt;since it seems a few people are interested.
