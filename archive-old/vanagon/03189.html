&gt; Matthew:  is that 0 to 60 in 4 minutes?   :)

	Actually that 2.1 liter wasserboxer will push Ruby pretty well if asked.
	But I've got to allow it to spin in the 3500 &gt; 5000 range through 3rd.

	I love the tranny whine when pushed.......

	I'd estimate 0 &gt; 60 in 22 sec. with no pots/pans/canned-goods/water/
	futon/CDs/clothes/stereo aboard.
