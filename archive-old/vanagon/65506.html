Steve,

I bought my 83.5 Adventurewagen used in 1987 for $13,500 with 65,000 miles
on the odometer. It was built on the Vanagon GL chassis and has all the
standard AW conversion items. The woodwork was done in Koa wood. Prior to
buying it I owned an 83.5 Westfalia for five months.

I've only been a member of the Vanagon list for less than a week but
between the current message traffic and the Archives I'm getting up to
speed on what to do and what to avoid. Which leads into the most major
repair I've had. In 1991 I took the AW into my local authorized VW dealer
to fix a coolant leak problem. At the time I didn't know that the Vanagons
were prone to having problems in that area. I believe the repair quote was
around $1600, while a new engine would cost $3600. Since my engine had
95,000 miles on it and I planned to keep the van for a long time I opted
for the new engine. VWofA kicked in $600+ as part of some under the table
thing (probably culpability) so my net was around $3000. I've since found a
very good local independent VW repair facility. Looking back I now feel the
VW dealer's service writers have a tendency to build the service orders
into annuities for the firm's owner.

I now at 130,000 miles which isn't much for the age. The only other
problems of any consequence has been more frequent than I'd like CV joint
replacements. Just heard a little knock at Crater Lake last month. It's
quiet now down here at sea level but it's time it should be looked at.

The AW has been back to the factory in Fort Bragg a couple of times for
equipment upgrades. These usually came about from newer ways of making the
product on later year's models. First in 1989 was replacement house
batteries and the later styled sealed battery box with outside ventilation.
Second a couple of years ago was to replace the aluminum 13 gallon air
powered water tank with a 19 gallon black plastic one powered by a 12v
SHURflo water pump. Also had them install a special switch which sends
power from the house batteries to the vehicle battery for those occasions
when the van lacks sufficient starting power. While there I saw a new
reading light on the current Ford AW's so I bought the part and installed
it myself. Plus seeing newer models gives me food for thought. I bought a
sewing machine and customized mine like those on the current models so that
they can be &quot;buttoned up&quot; twice as fast and without gaps to the outside
world.

I had been averaging 20.5 mpg on 1,000 to 2,000 mile trips but this last
year it has dropped to around 18.5 to 19 mpg. Something may need to be
tuned or the drop may be due to the new California gas. I read somewhere
that it can reduce your mpg.

&gt;&gt;Do you know of any other adventurewagons for sail?  (I have a call into
the folks in fort bragg to see if they know of any)

I saw one or two this week in either the SF, San Jose, or Seattle
classified ads. Their URL's are listed at Vanagon_dot_com.
Two years ago Ed Anderson the owner of Adventurewagen had 8-9 used units in
stock. Most I believe were .being sold on consignment. Happy to answer any
question you have.
