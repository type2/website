Subject: Re: VR6 Eurovans

In response to the following:

&gt; MV and the Weekender versions of the 1997 VR6 Eurovan HAVE JUST BEEN =
&gt; RELEASED! (Start calling your dealer, now.) The GL (or maybe GLS) is =
&gt; showing as not available and there's no release date yet. The rep wasn't =
&gt; sure of the price, but he quoted the $25k figure for the pre-Winnie =
&gt; conversion.

I have stated before that I test drove a 1997 VR6 Eurovan Camper in late Nov/
early Dec of '96. The pairc quoted to be via phone from Seattle by a dealer
was $35,900 with NO budging as these vehicles are rationed to dealers. My only
local dealer to have one - in Concord, NH - 2.5 hour drive away - offered me
a price of $32,500 on the same vehicle when I test drove it. 

I test drove the '97 V6 back to back with the '95 V5 used with 5K miles on it
at an offered price of $25,900. I have lots of notes and details on the
similarities and differences, as well as 2 VW/Winni brochures on all the
details of the '97. Call if you want more info. There are several messages
in the archives where I discussed the diferences in driving these campers.
