Subject: Re: Removing Shelves in 90 Westy

&gt; Is this an intelligence test or what?  Cabinet behind the driver's seat.
&gt;  Shelf and lower step shelf thing are supported and held in place by peg-like
&gt; things , chewy plastic on the outside and a hard metal center -- how do you
&gt; get the pegs out -- and then get the shelves out?

chewy is the clue - reach in, grab one with your teeth &amp; pull... ;)

Seriously, I pulled one out with pliers to get the shelf out.
