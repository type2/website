Subject: Re: Bodega Bay

&gt;Ok, the response has been profound about Bodega Bay! I'm talking like
&gt;maybe 9 vehicles!  Way to go, you geeks!  Now, the verdict is not yet
&gt;in on the date, but I wanted to call attention to something at least
&gt;one of you pointed out, and that is that Memorial weekend is THE
&gt;weekend everyone goes out camping/picnicing, 

Well, if you are still taking votes - I'd be interested in the second
weekend (since my Memorial Day is already booked).

BTW - I hit Red Rock a couple of days after you all were there (I checked
around for spare VW parts left behind w/o luck).  Nice place to camp.  From
there on to Death Valley where the rear brakes became *way* loose on a
washboard road (a story goes here that has to do with the dangers of jacking
up the bus, but another time).  Other than loosing a hub cap on one of those
&quot;4x4 only&quot; roads, patching the muffler with some metal I cut from an old
water tank in the middle of nowhere, and almost running out of beer!, the
'64 did great adding on another 1600 miles.  We even took it into Vegas for
a shine (ok, it was my boots that got the shine).  Anyway, I was really glad
that I had the bus and left the Jeep Wagoneer at home.  Want to buy a jeep?
