Subject:  Fridge: light won't light...

my fridge works, but the light doesn't, it used to, and just
died one weekend camping. it is not the LED, it is still good; once
i found out that i thought that i would have to tear the whole fridge
out to get to the problem (the PCB the lights are mounted on looks 
good, and the water tank and battery lights still work)
i now have to start the fridge using the pilot light in the back of the
fridge (i will have to buy completely clear food now)...

does anyone know what it could be, and how to fix it?

by the way, how does the electrical circuit know that the fridge is on?
(what kind of sensor is it)

thanks...
