Subject: Re: awnings, what I've learned

Hi Awning Volks;

I've got a 10' awning on our Syncro Westy, and Todd here made a note 
about the front door not being able to open.  I can easily open my 
front door with the Norseman Apollo 10' awning.  I usually have the 
awning sloped down a bit from the van, and when I open the front door 
I just put my hand over the top of the door to protect the finish.  
If you get an awning that stops at the front of the sliding door you 
won't be able to have the sliding door open in the pouring rain 
without your van getting wet inside.  I'm not sure if the A &amp; E 
awning restricts the front door opening completely or not, but this 
is not the case with the Apollo.

The back of my awning is just behind the rear vertical body seam 
behind the rear side window.  Ten feet from there put the awning in 
about the middle of the front door.  This way the sliding door stays 
dry when fully opened as well.  For a measurement, open the sliding 
door all the way, and hang the awning a little bit behind the door.  
I could measure this if anybody wants me to (the van's at home right 
now).  Just let me know.

Also, beware, these awnings are not light.  I've never weighed mine, 
but I bet it's around 40 lbs or so.  Cut small pieces of inner tube 
to put on the brackets where they will touch your enamel.  This works 
GREAT!!

Hope this helps,
Harry.

&gt; interfere with the front door(you can't open the door with the awning out).
&gt; It seems that all of the awnings that I see only go to the rear of the front
&gt; door. I have been very busy lately and haven't really studied this
&gt; instalation completely, so it might be possible to install a 10 footer but I
&gt; think it will be a problem. If you find out more please let me know. Those
&gt; of you with awnings out there, how long are they and how far forward do they
&gt; come?
