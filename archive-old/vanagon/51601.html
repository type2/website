Subject: Re: Tires - Syncro

&gt; 
&gt; Sears (is anyone cringing) offered tires (195 SR 70 14) manufactured by 
&gt; Michelin, wearing their name &quot;Guardsman Plus&quot; for $44 a piece.  They are 
&gt; double ply tires with a polyester cord, a wet traction rating of &quot;A&quot;, a Temp 
&gt; rating of &quot;B&quot;, tread wear of 320 (50,000 miles according to the associate). 
&gt;  They fit the specs for Vanagon Syncros in the tire book Sears uses.
&gt; 
&gt; The associate offered the tires on sale for $41 a piece and if the payment 
&gt; was on credit, an additional 10% off.  Total price - $161.00 including 
&gt; mounting, balancing is $8.99 each tire.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought them with the knowledge that they can be returned if I'm not happy
&gt; 
&gt; Any input?????

Are they LT rated?
If they do not have a load rating of 1450lbs and inflation maximum of 
40psi, I would return them, especially on a Syncro.
Sears makes a LT load range C tire which will work, but avoid 
passenger tires - you will not be happy. (I am speaking from 
experience here.)

My favourite is the Yokohama Y370G load range D. They are pricey, but 
worth it.
