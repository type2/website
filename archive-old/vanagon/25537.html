Subject: Re: Snow Tires??

I called a good local tire store here in Seattle (Upenieks) for more info
on the Blizzaks. They/he said the Blizzaks do not fit the van.  For me,
this is an '86 Syncro camper.  He recommended Michelin LPX/MS (which he
runs on his own Syncro!).  I did not ask about the Alpin.  I mentioned
that I currently have Toyo 800's which he said are the wrong tire per VW
specs for the Syncro. 

I have not followed the tire thread very closely, but this 'info' may be
interesting to some of you.  I would be interested if anyone has info that
contradicts what he told me, since I should change the tires currently
mounted on my van if I take his expert advice.
