&gt;
&gt;anybody know of a north american source of replacement
&gt;radiator grills for a 4 light system? not the late model
&gt;rectangular lights, but a grill that will accept 7&quot;
&gt;round lights. 


Maybe....   My 85 Transporter (panel) has a 2 light grille with standard 7&quot; 
sealed beams. See your friendly VW dealer/ try BusBoys maybe in EuroCar mag ads.
They should be cheaper than regular setup, but you'll need all the headlight 
carriers behind the grille also. Spend your money on a set of massive 
driving lights instead. It's fun toasting people who won't turn down their 
high beams at night until they're 50 feet from you!    tjs
