Hi there everyone,

	this is a brief note to get those folks in the SE lower MI area
primed for lots of VW action over the next 3 weekends.  More details will
follow in a later message.

	Saturday 7/20:  &quot;Munk Junk.&quot;  A VW repair shop on M59 west of
I75 is having a parts giveaway to MVVC members.  Noon-5pm.  The Ann Arbor
crowd will be meeting to caravan to Munk's Motors together.  Time &amp; place
of caravan TBA.  Come along for the ride at least, even if you're not a
member or aren't looking for parts (yeah, right!).

	Sunday 7/28:  Milan Bug-out.  VW show, swap meet, drag races...
bikini &lt;ahem&gt; &quot;competition.&quot;  Your regular big-production VW event, with
admission fee to match ($11/head!  Ouch!).  We will meet at Arborland
Mall in Ann Arbor to caravan; time TBA.

	Sunday 8/4(???):  Toledo Show!  New location this year:  a drive-
in theater.  (Matt, can you confirm the date, time &amp; location?  Entry/reg.
fees?)

	If anybody has strong feelings about caravan times, etc., let me
know.  Tend to think early... gotta get a head start on swap meets, beat 
the heat, etc.
