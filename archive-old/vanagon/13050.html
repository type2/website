Well today the weather did improve enough to go out and have a look at the
 clutch. The clutch pedal had been going to the floor with no resistance
and the fluid in the reservoir was dropping below the clutch intake tube.
I speak in the past tense because sure enough the pedal is now working but
the fluid is just at the intake point. I am stumped because for the past
three months the pedal has not worked at all. What amazed me was that no
pumping up of the slave or master (like air in the breaks) was required. First
time the pedal went solidly to the floor. A check under the slave area
showed no fluid...ditto the master. I am left with a few possibilities.

Fluid IS being lost but this only happens when the temperature is cold
enough for the seals to &quot;shrink&quot; and the lack of constant lubrication
means  that the fluid can slip past and probably drip out and evaporate
before it can be discovered; This is most likley since the seals have
never been replaced and there is over 160,000 miles on the van.

The remedy in this case would probably be a combination of warmer weather,
bleeding the entire system and monitoring the slave for leaks. In the
event there is a continuing leak then I will probably replace the seals.
Something
similar to this happened to the KG after it was put into storage over a
cold winter; the master brake cylinder seals lost their elasticity without
lubrication and I ended up replacing the master.

I may not be out of the woods yet; there is a small possibility that the
leak is going somewhere else (brake vacuum) but this would not explain why the
level does not drop below the intake.


On another note the Westy starterd reasonably well, but the hydraulic
valves did not kick in. The noise will probably go away once it is out on
the highway.  The thermostat, I noticed had also given up the ghost. It
did not last long (less than a year) hmmmmm. Still the heat is ok without
it (at least today).
