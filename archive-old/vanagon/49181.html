A quick note on antennas.  I had some f**k break off the antenna on my 87
syncro.  Yesterday, I went to MOFOCO and bought a beetle antenna.  I
removed the dash (20 min job) which was suprisingly easy, removed the
grille and the right headlamp, and the radio using a custom bent coat
hanger.  The antenna fit almost perfectly, and the entire job took 45 min
tops.  

Just a quick and dirty tip from the cheap files
