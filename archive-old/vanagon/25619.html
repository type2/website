Subject: 71 Westy and Door Handles

To all,

	I am stuck with the problem on both the drivers and passengers door
that if the door is locked and you pull the trigger (for lack of a better word)
to open the door you can no longer unlock the door with a key. This of course
must be the best part of owning a walk through bus since I have to go in
through the sliding door. I have not pulled off the door panels yet but, it
seems strange that both sides work likes this! Has anyone seen this or know of
the fix?
