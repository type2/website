So Maher, Steve says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;The coldest winter I ever spent, was a summer in San Francisco.&quot; -anon.
&gt; &gt;                                                                   
&gt;  ^^^^^^^????
&gt; &gt;Hey Steve,
&gt; &gt;Ever heard of Samuel Clemens A.K.A  Mark Twain????
&gt; &gt;Just in case he's a little miffed and turning in his grave...  ;p
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I have. Bass guitarist in Boyz 2 Men, wasn't he, till he
&gt; converted to Hare Krishna?    :^P back  &lt;got you last!&gt;

Doh!!

Hey, but 'did you know' that before his Bass guitarist days he was &quot;Steamboat
Sam&quot; and that if he were alive around the time Disney made &quot;Steamboat Mickey&quot;
that Mickey Mouse never would have made it and Disney would not be a house-
hold name it is today.  


.........tag, your it!  ;)
