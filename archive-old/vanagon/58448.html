Subject: Needed: Rear Chrome Bumper for 86 Syncro


Someone backed into my the rear bumper of my 86 Syncro. There was
enough damage that I had to remove it so the rear access door under
the license plate could be opened.

So I need a replacement bumper, but not the end caps. If anyone has
one available, or knows where to find one, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.
