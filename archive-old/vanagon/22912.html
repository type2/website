Subject: bus-chop

Is that Lamb-chop... Pork-chop???Well Hello all there is a crazy little bus
Down here near Carbondale, Ill. It has the entire mid section torched out and
Lokks quite functional. While I don't know how much or even if it runs, i
would go there if someone told me they were interested. I don't really
subscribe to thesse cut up practice as i am more of the purist staying as
close to stock as possible. Hell, I just recently bought an internal frame
backpack!!  The Bus-chop is a wierd faded, shade of orange. Is that like a
hazy shade of winter?? Well as Ray Raynor used to say... &quot;  It's a quarter to
eight you're gonna be late...Bye...Bye...Bye...&quot;
