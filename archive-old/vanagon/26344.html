Subject: Free bus: as is, where is (was: in Defense of Spam)



&gt;In the modern era, those C-rats are referred to officially as MRE's, for
&gt;&quot;Meal, Ready to Eat&quot;.
&gt;Among the people who actually have to eat them (I had the pleasure more
&gt;than once in Thule, Greenland), this is called &quot;Three lies for the price
&gt;of one&quot;.

BTW, when I was there ('85 - '87), there was a breadloaf-style type 2
sitting on its axles there. Looked like it had been there for years. No
wheels. I believe that it was a vintage 68-71 bus. Probably didn't have
an engine.

It may be there till the next ice age, which up there isn't very far off,
believe me. No other VWs there to cannabalize parts for (No, I don't know
where the wheels went), so it probably won't get any worse than it is now.
OTOH, parts are a little tough to get up there-- it's strictly a military
base, and the closest habitation is 60 miles away, and that's an Eskimo
village. Thule does have an APO, where you can get parts mail-ordered in,
evn large heavy ones. But, as for service... don't get me started on that
particular APO.

Supply ships go up there regularly in the summer, thru about November, and
come back empty. If anyone happens to be good friends with a ship captain,
and wants a project with a colorful history... ???

Thule (pronounced too-lee) is on the northwest coast of the Greenland
continent. There's a reason why it's always colored white on maps. Thule
is about halfway between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. The name
is an Eskimo word, meaning &quot;Remotest Habitable Province&quot;. That Eskimo,
whoever he was, was overly optimistic IMHO.

Say, Bob, as soon you are finished having fun in Washington...  ;)
