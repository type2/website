Subject:      Re: vanagon transporter

&gt; &lt;&lt; I understand Canada imported a vanagon transporter in 1980-83.  Anyone
&gt;  familiar with this vehicle?

&gt; You need to be more specific...
&gt; the &quot;transporter&quot; badge was on the back of all Canadian vanagon pickups,
&gt; kombis, and panelvans thru all the years of vanagons...

This means they just carry the European badges. On the same subject:

The terms Vanagon and EuroVan are to my knowledge exclusively North
American labels. They are unknown over here (in the old world). They are
genericly called  'Transporter'. The 8/9 seater versions are sometimes
labeled  'Bus'  and the more luxerious versions 'Caravelle'.
