Subject: Where to get rebuilt engine?


Unfortunately the time has come and my dear friend the 82 Vanagon needs a 
new engine.  It was a long slow ride home last weekend on three cylinders!!
Can anyone suggest some places to chech out for rebuilt engines (2 liter model)?

Thanks a bunch,

Albrecht

Disclaimer:  I _really_ would like to rebuild it myself, but I don't want to
make do without my weekend transportation for that long.
