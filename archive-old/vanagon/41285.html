&gt; as i recall thom fitzpatrick was rebuilding a governpr to put on his 56'? thom 
&gt; care to share any light?

I took mine apart, cleaned it up,put it back together and installed it.

It works!

It works by a small vane which catches the air as it goes thru the bottom
of the carb.  When it flows enug, the vane swings out and slows down the flow,
and slows the motor.  There is a spring with a set screw on to which lets
you set the tension on the vane.  Tightening makes it come on later, looser
earlier.  I set it real loose as a test, and it came on before I could
get into 2nd gear.
