&gt; 
&gt; Ya see, when I turn on the auxiliary heater-- which is of the gasoline powered
&gt; variety, mounted in line with the heater pipes from the heat exchangers --
&gt; I get a lot of smoke in the cabin.  I took the whole thing appart yesterday,
&gt; and there don't seem to be any leaks in the combustion chamber, so the only
&gt; thing I can think of is that the exhaust from the heater is ending up in the
&gt; wrong place and somehow getting sucked into the cabin.  Any ideas, anyone?

You might try to look inside the heater where the hot air blows through.
If at any time in the past you had oil leak into your heater boxes, the
oil gets vaporised and then coats the inside of the gas heater (and your
heater pipes).  When you turn on the gas heater, you get a lot of smoke
from the oil burning off.
