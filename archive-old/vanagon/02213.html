Bill H.... may be surprised and how much &quot;good&quot; is done by a gentle, but
deliberate slap.

There's stuff that I've been called to repair or look at that just a slap
or tap has caused the thing to become &quot;unstuck&quot; and I've still submitted a
bill for time and service call expense.

I also advise that before you call for help try a good slap or tap on the
thing.
