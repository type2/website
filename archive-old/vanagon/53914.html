&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; We're sitting here trying to figure out which is the best year/model
&gt; Vanagon to buy.  It will be used primarily as a workhorse for an
&gt; independent construction person who totes around a lot of materials,
&gt; tools, and a big Rottweiler.
&gt; 
&gt; We're in a pretty good market selection-wise (Northern CA) so once the
&gt; right range is identified we should be able to find one.  Specifically,
&gt; we're curious to know if any models were made for the US with full
&gt; paneled sides (no windows) for commerical use.  I know we've seen them
&gt; in Europe.  Also, can the top handle a roof rack for lumber?  
&gt; 
&gt; Any wisdom/tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

   Wisdom:  Don't beat up a Vanagon! Find a Chevy or a ford,
            no one cares about them!
