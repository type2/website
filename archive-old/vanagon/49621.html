&lt;&lt; I located the vibration that I was searching for in my drivetrain. It
seems
 the rear universal in the driveshaft was drier the dry and scorched beyond
 repair. That was the good news, I had feared it was a trans. problem. The
 bad news is I spent 2 hours on the phone and none of the FLAPS have any
 replacements . They all insisted that this Vehicle has no universal joints.
 Does anyone know of a suitable replacement or have a part #. VOA wants well
 over $145- EACH. Ouch. &gt;&gt;


I can get these for you.  $40.00ea.  Let me know if you want them.
