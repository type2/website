&gt; &gt;           Well, Bradley ...being over 6'2 1/2&quot; I tried driving a splitie
&gt; &gt;           but I got tired of bending down to see or mistaking the metal 
&gt; &gt;           piece in the middle for a tree in the road. No, I like my view
&gt; &gt; unobstructed and panoramic...not looking through a porthole.

&gt; Well... the Vanagon has a really good view.  A nice bis rear view mirror, 
&gt; and large rear window.  And the windshield reminds me of the veiwing area 
&gt; at the airport, because it's so large.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have the same problem with the split window bus.  I'm 6', and I can only 
&gt; guess that Germans in the '50s and '60s were about 5' tall.  And they're 
&gt; a bit harder to see out the rear window, but mine is better than the pre 
&gt; '64 buses.  But the split window bus is still way cool!

I'm 6'2 as well and I really love the bay window I have.  In fact I 
almost wiped out driving my wife's Taurus the otherday because the mirror 
had gotten in the way and I am used to seeing nearly everything in front 
of me with out looking around obstacles. Splitties are still &quot;Way Cool&quot;.  My 
wife wants to get a split window westy now!
