Subject: Stiff Captian's chairs

In reply to the question about stiff captian's chairs.

I had the same problem. I had one chair that refused to swivel. It seems that
the seats are mounted on what looks like a giant lazy susan device - but
instead of bearings between the two plates, there are four plastic guides. In
my Van one of the guides had broken and fallen out - aparently this is enough
to make the seat almost impossible to turn.

The good news is that the dealer can order these and they are only about
$1.50 each. (4 per seat)

Good Luck
