&gt;Can someone tell me everything there is to know

Greetings,

I can't tell you everything but here is some info.  This data is taken off
a set of semaphors that were on a '60 european bug.   They were made by
SWFand are part #111 953 021 F.  The tiny lamp inside is a 3 Watt bulb.

BTW I bought the bug they were attached to for $20.   :-)
