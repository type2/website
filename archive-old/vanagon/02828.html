Subject: RE: Brakes

If I remember the original post, I think you said that the cover was off the
brake fluid reservoir.  Was there a strainer in place? or just a big hole for
stuff to fall into?  In either case, it is quite possible that your entire
brake system has been munged (sp?) up with water (i.e. rust), and/or dirt.  If
it is dirt, you may be able to disassemble all your cylinders, clean them out,
and re-use them after thouroughly flushing (maybe backflushing) the lines. 
Unfortunately, brake fluid has a real amenity for water, readily absorbing it
and then transporting it to all portions of your brake system.  If the system
then leaks dry (causing an empty reservoir since brake fluid does not
evaporate, as far as I know), the air and residual water will cause rust on the
inside surfaces of all parts of the brake system, causing clogged lines and
inoperable cylinders as the rust flakes off and gathers in all the spots that
you don't want it to.

BTW, the white, milky fluid is typically water-logged brake fluid.

On my '64 bus, which had pulling problems, I replaced all the cylinders and
flexible lines and, while I had the lines disconnected, I thouroughly flushed
the system.  I will admit that I also had leaky cylinders in some places, so I
needed to replace some of the cylinders anyway, but there is nothing like new
parts to invoke confidence in your brakes.

&gt;From the fact that the brake pedal only slowly returns to its upright position,
it sounds like you have a restriction somewhere in your system, this would also
cause pulling.

You might try also disconnecting the lines from the rear brake cylinders, and
checking for good flow at that point, if the flow is good there, it is possible
that the bleeder screw is clogged, and you will have to clear it out to get a
good bleeding job done.

Good luck, I hope your problem is not as bad as it could be.
