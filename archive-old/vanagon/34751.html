Subject: coolant leak when cold
Date: Wed, 7 Feb 1996 11:29:41 -0500 (EST)

86 Vanagon
When it is very cold I end up with a puddle of coolant under van after driving.
The puddle is near driver's side of engine toward front of van.
Leak seems to be worst the colder it gets (-8 here this weekend).
Any ideas ??
Thanks Anthony
