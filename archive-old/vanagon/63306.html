I would say that $8995 is high for a 84 Westy.

We just baught a 84 Westy for $6500, which I felt was high,
but it was in very excellent shape, the best of any that we
looked at.  As I remember, the Blue book &quot;dealer&quot; price was
around $8100 and the dealer tradein price was about $4400.
This was with 108,000 miles versus your 70K.  Milage has a big
impact on Blue book prices but from what I am reading here,
the important thing is not the milage but the care taken of the
motor.   I would get a &quot;buyer inspection test&quot; from a good
VW shop and go from there.

By the way, you can look up the Kelly Blue Book price at
