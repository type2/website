Subject: Re: &quot;quick&quot; question on buying a '72

Dan, if that &quot;complete tent set up&quot; you are referring to is an &quot;Add-A-Room&quot;
(tent that attaches to pass. side of van) and is v. good shape, it is worth
almost $400.00 itself! I would say yes $500.00 for that vehicle sounds like
a fair deal (obviously made without the benefit of seeing the vehicle). You
want to be pretty clear about the amount of work this is going to take to
put on the road though.




&gt;Just kidding-- I know there's no such thing as a 'quick' question.
&gt;Here's the deal:
&gt;
&gt;'72 Camper, 56K miles, parked since 1985 and definately a tow-home
&gt;job, red squirrels gotten into it, known exhaust problems
&gt; but was running/being driven when parked,
&gt;some perforation body rust ahead of rear wheels otherwise quite
&gt;solid, totally oxidized paint, needs lots of TLC and fresh rubber
&gt;parts.  Oh, its got AC (yuck) and a complete tent setup!  Is this
&gt;worth $500?  What is it worth?  (this may be my Norton replacement,
&gt;BUT no commitments yet)
