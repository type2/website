Subject: subscription question and repairing twin solexes



All,

I've been away from this list for about 5 months due to a job
change, busy new job, etc. I've just finally gotten back to work
on my VWs so this is my first letter to vanagon_at_lenti in quite
a while.

First a question about subscription to this list.  I've been
keeping up with the goings on here by reading Skip Montanaro's
excellent hypermail web site at: 

  http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-mailing-list.html

I don't feel I really need to receive any e-mail directly so I hesitate
to resubscribe.  Is there a way to subscribe to vanagon_at_lenti but receive
no e-mail?  I used to subscribe in &quot;digest&quot; mode but I don't want to
receive even the once or twice a day mailings since I'd rather just
read it on the web site.  I guess Gerry Skerbitz would know all about
this and I could have e-mailed him directly but I thought others might
be interested.  (I don't want to be left out of Joel's weekly stats!)

Next, a VW question.  The two solex carbs on my '73 Westy are shot.
I pulled 'em out and I see that the bushings on the throttle bodies
have about an eighth of an inch of play up and down which is causing
me idle problems.  There is a place in town that wants $320 to
re-manufacture the carbs which includes re-bushing the throttle shafts.
The alternative would be to purchase a set of aftermarket carbs but
I'm concerned that this would mean I'd have to switch to an 009
distributer and/or lose my chokes (al la Webber).  I've heard of
Kadron carburators but don't know much about them, do they have chokes?
I've used a two barrel progressive in the past but wasn't thrilled
with it.  What other solutions have people tried?

Cheers,

 -Dyer
