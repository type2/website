I don't think it should be necessary to pull the dash to replace the master
cylinder.  I had it done several years ago, and if I recall, at most, you may
have to pull the instrument cluster, and that comes pretty easily.  Remember
that the master cylinder sits immediately below the brake fluid reservoir that
you fill by popping off the top of the instrument cluster.  By the way, don't
forget that the same brake fluid reservoir also supplies the clutch master
cylinder!
