Subject:      hubcaps (wheel covers)

anybody know anything about these folks:

Hubcaps               they have a web site:
822 Clinton Street
Buffalo, NY 14210     http://www.hub-caps_dot_com/VW.html
(716) 856-6923
                      which has a bunch of different vw hubcaps. of interest
to this bunch would be the ones for Eurovans and Vanagons ... both of which
have a price of &quot;Inquire&quot;. :)  can anybody in/near Buffalo call and see how
much they want for one?? the picture in the web page (click on the part
number) appears to be the right one (for vanagon, anyway)

joel
