&gt;I'd say they're doing a pretty good job.  A couple years ago I went to the
&gt;VW dealer in Des Moines after rubber air-cleaner to carb. tube for the
&gt;Camper (Frau Blucher) and they looked at me like I was dripping slime on
&gt;their floor.  Ditto with the VW dealer in Dubuque last year when I needed a
&gt;new oil filler cap for the 79.  Royal, supreme jerks one and all.  Thank

I dunno, maybe it's a regional thing based upon the number of air-cooleds
in circulation.  Here in Tucson we still have lots of Vdubs running
around, and the dealer seems quite happy to take my money.
And they want lots of it cuz they're real proud of their genuine VW parts.
