Subject: Throttle valve positioner

I have a problem.  This thing is on my bus and has no hoses hooked up to it. 
 Does anyone have this still hooked up or does everyone just take it off?  
It's supposed to hold the throttle open when deceleration, and has two hose 
connections to it. One is bigger, I think that this goes to the manifold for 
vaccum.  the other goes to the carb?  There are 2 hose connections on the 
carb, where does the other one go?
Any help would be great!!
Thanks
