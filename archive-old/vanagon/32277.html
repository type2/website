Subject: Re: a snowy day

Another EV success story.  Just been tooling around in my EV MV.  
Blasting along nearly as easily as the HUGE tire four wheel drive 
pickups.  Okay I did better if they had broken up the 20+ inches of 
snow.  Only problems were where I had to cross over the debirs from a 
snow plow.  They plowed the primary route and I needed to get down the 
secondary unplowed road.  Only the plow's bank caused any problems.  

&gt; I was out driving an EV full of kids to their homes last night, a half
&gt; hour before they announced the vehicle ban on the roads. The road were
&gt; plowed earlier, but they had another foot of fresh snow on them, plus
&gt; the drifts.
&gt; 
&gt; The Continental tires on the EV (which Rick wrote about) were deflated
&gt; to around 20psi, and they have 38K miles on them.  The traffic was
&gt; non-existent, and roads had some tire tracks on them which I moade use
&gt; of. It was kind of fun (I had to keep reminding myself I had a bunch
&gt; kids in the van to refrain from having some real fun :-)  I was just
&gt; about the only driver without chains or snow tires on the road.  The
&gt; EV did exceptionally well and I was very proud of it (If the new tires
&gt; Rick got are so much better than the Contis, well, maybe I'll trythose
&gt; when it's time to change the Contis)..

I was on OEM GoodYear (special order import in the US) without messing 
with the inflation pressure at all.

Oh yeah and I was quite warm.  And no I wasn't passed by an aircooled bus 
at anyu point.... ;^)
