&gt; Farmer Jim reports:

&gt; BTW, the local VW dealer has a policy of not working on vehicles over 10 
&gt; years old.  &quot;Say What?!?&quot;  I asked?  Yep.  No micros, bugs or any of that 
&gt; other aged vermin.  I like ta chocked.
&gt; 
&gt; 
 WHAT?!   With that attitude, no wonder VW's market share is steadily
 shrinking and shrinking. 

 Nah, maybe it's because the older ones are too easy to fix and aren't 
 challenging enough for their &quot;technicians&quot;. Yeah, right.

 Geez, VW, getta grip.
