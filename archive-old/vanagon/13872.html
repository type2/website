Subject: Re: alcohol burner question

&gt;Hey, couldn't a propane lantern use up your oxygen and produce
&gt;CO, also?
&gt;
yes for oxygen, CO, dunno, but the propane is burned inside/on the fragile 
asbestos wick, like a mini catalytic heater so should be clean.

&gt;I want the heater for personal warmth.  
 again brandy, whilst swaddled in flannel! (and parked..)
&gt;
&gt;Would you guys out there who have the catalyic heaters
&gt;drive with them on? 
&gt;
 In regular driving maybe, but &quot;what-if&quot; you ever rolled over....?

When I was little... each summer we used to drive 2500 miles in a 1956 
LandRover, on a trip to the bottom of Turkey from England. It would go 50 
mph tops, which my dad did on dirt or Autobahn. He would turn off the 
ignition when we (often) got wedged between oncoming transports and the one 
we were crawling by on undivided highways. He didn't want the danger of a 
fire starting if we were totalled. I still remember these occurences 
vividly, and don't like driving with any more ignition sources than 
possible. his $0.02, tim s.
