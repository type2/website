&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi David.  I use Yokohmama Y370 tires on my Syncro.  It's an
&gt;&gt;LT195 75/14 and is more than capable of supporting these vans.  They 
&gt;&gt;are fantastic as an all-season/all-terrain type tire.  Very quiet, 
&gt;&gt;and resonably priced.  The load rating is 'D&quot;with 1765 lbs and max 
&gt;&gt;air pressure of 65 psi.(I run tire pressures at 43 front/53 rear).
&gt;&gt; These are probably the best tires I have tried in recent years.  Near 
&gt;&gt;perfect balancing, and excellent handling for such a heavy van!  Way
&gt;&gt; better than the Contis, and they are excellent in snow/ice.  I have 
&gt;&gt;recommended these tires to others locally with these vans, and people 
&gt;&gt;really like them.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah, they are 6 ply rated as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Harry.  

Hi Harry, thanks for the advice. I actually try to find Yokohama Y370 as
you have suggested in the past on the list (was it by you?). I have not 
found it yet. It sure sounds a very good choice. Except one question, the tire
size 195/75 is a little wider and bigger (in diameter) comparing to the 
original 185/75. I actually compared a Uniroyal LT 195/75R14 with 185/75R14
found found it to be an inch taller. I guess my vanagon can run at a bit higgher
speed.

What's the price did you pay for the Y370?
Thanks.
