Subject: Ball joints?

&gt;My 85 Vanagon with 180K miles has a thump when I hit any minor bump in the
&gt;road. It sounds like something hitting the frame under the passenger's seat.
&gt;Any thoughts? Ball Joints? How do I check?

--
Where your passenger's balls go,
when you hit the bump.
If they hit the roof or so,
that's what makes the thump

Have fun!
