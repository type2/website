&gt;If you need a new dist for a 2.0 liter FI on a 78 bus, should you 
use
&gt;stock replacement? What would the effect be if you used a 009?

Although the advance curve supposedly differs between the late bus 
distributor and the 009, I never noticed a difference in actual 
driving when I put a 009 on a late bus.  Of course, you should use 
the appropriate timing; a late bus is supposed to be timed at 8 
degrees advanced, as I recall, but the 009 does call for a 
different timing.
