&gt; Subject: kombi on fire
&gt; Hello all
&gt;
&gt; On TV last night, one of the news programmes had brief footage of what
&gt; appeared to be an 1800/2 litre kombi completely ablaze with rear tyres
&gt; exploding. The report stated that while travelling along a Sydney
&gt; freeway the driver noticed smoke coming from the rear of the van and
&gt; was able to pull over and get out before the fire took hold.
&gt; Spectacular viewing (that's why it made the news) but pretty disturbing
&gt; to a kombi owner.

&gt;
&gt; I think I'll check over the fuel lines in my kombi this weekend.

Yes, I saw this too. Mind you its not the only case I've ever seen. I've never
had any problems in this regard, although the cabin of my '72 once filled with
smoke after I pulled over during a freeway trip noth of Sydney. Turned out that
the fumes from oil burning on the surface of the motor got into the heating
system and made their way to the dash board. It certainly made me jump out of
the van.

I know of one person in an '84 model who's front passenger seat caught fire. An
auxiliary battery had been installed without any insulation above the
terminals. Fortuneately it was put out in time.
