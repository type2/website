Subject: &quot;3000 original miles&quot;

Here's a credulity-straining opportunity one of you H2O enabled Vgon fans
may wish to investigate:  1991 Westy, said to have 3000 original miles,
$12,500.  Located in Hackensack NJ.  I stopped to see it because it is so
pretty: white, with the Carat wheels and lower body cladding.  Body looks
perfect with exception of a small but severe ding on the passenger side
rear corner: maybe 3/4&quot; deep and confined to an area 2&quot; in diameter.

Story is told that the camper was used very little and then stolen.  When
it was recovered the transmission was gone, so it sat some more.  Then the
transmission was replaced and it sat some more.  Now the owner and the
shop the van is at want to get it sold; the way they are advertising it is
by letting it sit in the same spot without a For Sale sign for four months
or so now.

I only do v_at_l by visiting the recent archives web page intermittently, so
if you want to follow up on this interesting and somewhat far-fetched 
lead, reply me.
