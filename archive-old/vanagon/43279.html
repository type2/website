William Kennedy says:

&gt;Steve Rosen offers test drives in his Subaru-engined Vgon. Sign me up,
&gt;Steve, and you can drive my (properly German) six-cylinder conversion at
&gt;the same time.

Hoo Boy (2)! 

When you folks arrange this, please let the list know. I for one would
love to witness the event!
