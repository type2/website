Subject: Re: a reason NOT to use the parking brake

Well, volks, I missed the original post on this, but immediately thought of
ONE reason not to use the parking brake.

Do NOT take a long mountain drive, cross a creek, chug up to a hilltop and
set the parking brake!  Did this a few years back in my '69 bug - visited
friends overnight, got in the bug next morning to back out and leave - the
brakes had seized up and I didn't go *anywhere* for over 5 hours while
friends and I labored to get those brakes to LET GO!  Seems other veedubs had
experienced the same thing there.  My host said, oh, no, don't ever put on
your e-brake, just put it in gear.  And he drives a '72 bus. Has to do with
cold creek water and expansion/contraction of hot brake drums.  My .02...
