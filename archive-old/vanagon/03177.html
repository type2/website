Subject: When Volksies are outlawed .....

&lt;soap box mode on&gt;

Like Thom Fitzpatrick, I also caught that nasty little piece in the WSJ.
Boy, talk about a slow burn....What's even worse is that it generated 
just about 0 noise in the mail list! 

Hey, you folks with the restored, cherry 68s? Kiss 'um goodbye! Got
about 4 grand into your restoration? Too bad, the Gov. will give you $950
for it (to get past a tacky little law about 'taking').

Say so long to the 65 Mustangs, 57 T-Birds and 56 'Vetts.

Now why so you think those wonderful folks in Washington are going to
all this trouble?
   a. Getting the industrial smog generators is getting too tough
   b. They are convinced that people that drive 'clunkers' don't vote

Want to help me prove them wrong? Every one of the congress critters has
email...
