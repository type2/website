Subject: hot water help

I've decided that since we never drink from the storage tank, I'm going to 
use the engine heat to heat all the water in there.

Does anyone where I could get either 1) a 110 degree automatic water 
valve (like a thermostat) or 2) a 110 degree water temperature 12 volt switch?

For safety sake, I want to make sure this contraption will automatically 
turn off when the water gets to 110 degrees. The last time I built one of 
these heat exchangers, the water would sometimes get to boiling. Not very 
safe for a shower.
