So Bo Kersey says:
&gt; 
&gt; There is a 1989 Westy parts car that has recently been sent to the local vw
&gt; dismantlers. If anyone needs parts, let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; The van is smashed in the front and rolled over onto the driver's side.
&gt; 

Okay, here's my request.  I'd like the steering wheel bottom cover piece
(plastic cover) and also the turn signal and wiper assembly off of the
steering column.  I really appreciate the trouble.  

Thanks,

Steven
