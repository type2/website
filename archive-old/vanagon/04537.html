&gt; they left off a few gaskets) it would amount to a grand total
&gt; of $1810.89 FOR PARTS ALONE!  Is it just me or

	Try Midas.

	I was responding to your msg. when it occured to me I'd like to have an
	idea of costs for mine. So, I called Midas.

	Muffler = 	$185
	Cat.=		$160
	Install=	$ 12

	Plus any pipes.

	The main reason I'd do Midas is because of the lifetime-we'll-replace-
	any-parts thing. Meinike also, I think.
