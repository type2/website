Morning!

Well, after many cold nights I finally completed my brake rebuild.  All new
wheel cylinders, shoes, and lines.  Repacked the bearings up front and am
preparing to drain/refill aforementioned transmission and reduction gears.
My question is: what size is that damn drain/fill bolt?  Is it 17mm?  That
number seems to stick out in my mind for some reason.  Where am I gonna find
that sucker?

As I was preparing to fill my master cylinder and bleed the brakes (at
midnight last night) I noticed that my fluid reservoirs had some grey pasty
crap in the bottom.  Can I easily remove the reservoirs without removing the
master cylinder?  I have everything disconnected from the master cylinder
but it's extremely well-rusted onto the mount so I don't want to pry if I
don't have to.  Then what can I do about the crud in the bottom?  It's not
solid or anything...

TIA,

Bob J.
