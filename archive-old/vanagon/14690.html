Subject: FS:'62 delux in NC



    While making deliveries out of my '76 bus (As per my job) a couple of 
weeks ago, I ran across a volkswagon beetle graveyard.  Upon inquiring 
about it, I found out the owner runs an aircooled vw shop.  I get all excited
(as I'm looking for a good mechanic in the area) and tool on over there.  It 
turns out that he stores all the beetles out in the country by his house 
and all the busses in back of his shop.  I got a mini tour of the lot and 
learn that he specializes in older vw's. 

    After much salivating over a junked barn-door and 21 windows, he shows 
me the '62 delux bus he has for sale!  He started it right up and it purred
nicely.  He did indicate it needed brake work.  He is also throwing in
another '62 along with it as a parts car.  I took a peek underneath and 
everything looked solid.  He is asking around $1,300.  

    His business card claims 400 junked VW's from 1956 to 1976.  Owner is 
Richard Jewell.  His shop is near Graham NC.  Phone: (910) 376-3828.  I 
might go after this baby myself if circumstances didn't prevent me from 
it. (monetary and otherwise.)  I would like to see it go to a good home.
Inquirys may E me directly, though I can't tell you a whole lot more
