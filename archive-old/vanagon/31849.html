Okay, everyone....a true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A. 
Thought y'all might enjoy this; if nothing else, it shows internet 
justice, if it can be called that.
     
My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe 
in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are 
such cookie lovers, we decided to try the &quot;Neiman-Marcus Cookie&quot;. It
was  so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they 
said with a small frown, &quot;I'm afraid not.&quot;  Well, I said, would you let 
me 
buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked how much, 
and she responded, &quot;Two fifty.&quot; I said with approval, just add it to my 
tab. 
     
Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and 
it was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent
$9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at the 
bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe - $250.00.&quot;  Boy, was I 
upset!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress 
said 
it was &quot;two-fifty,&quot; and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a 
cookie recipe. 
     
I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they 
said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive 
so not just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes....the 
bill would stand.
     
I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of 
my money back.
     
I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going
to have $250.00 worth of fun.&quot; I told her that I was going to see to it 
that every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from 
Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, &quot;I wish you wouldn't do this.&quot; I 
said, &quot;I'm sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even,&quot;
and I will.
     
So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few 
copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.
     
                    (Recipe may be halved.): 
     
      2  cups butter                     4  cups flower 
      2  tsp. soda                       2  cups sugar
      5  cups blended oatmeal**         24 oz. chocolate chips 
      2  cups brown sugar                1  tsp. salt
      1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)      4  eggs
      2  tsp. baking powder              3 cups chopped nuts (your 
choice) 
      2  tsp. vanilla
     
        ** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder. 
            Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; 
            mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and 
            soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into 
            balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake 
            for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.
     
        Have fun!!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story..
