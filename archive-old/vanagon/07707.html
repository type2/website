Subject: Grits &amp; Strontium-90


The Bushrat asked for a recipe for grits.  In attempt to go beyond my 
usual recipe (buy grits, follow directions on back of bag, doctor to 
taste), I pulled out my &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;.  No recipes for grits, but I 
thought I would send y'all the description in re strontium: 

&quot;ABOUT HOMINY
Hominy is corn with the hull and germ removed.  In an attempt to give it 
calcium values, it is sometimes also soaked in wood ash lye.  It has 
recently gained favor as an antistrontium absorbent.  Hominy grits are 
the broken grains.&quot;

BTW, anyone proud of their grits recipe, please send it to the bushrat 
(gremlin_at_iol.ie) and cc me.  I am always looking for interesting 
&quot;doctoring&quot; things.

VW content:  Massive sympathy to both sstones and Thom Fitzpatrick.  Ouch!

BTW, Thom, if you can convince the insurance adjuster that you need a 
replacement engine, will we soon be hearing about your 6-cylinder 
conversion of the '56? Vroom, Vroom...
