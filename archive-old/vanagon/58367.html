Subject: Re: Interior Camping Heater

For the last couple of years I have used a small ceramic heater in our
camper. Wires dont get too hot, element not too hot, tilt cut-out switch, can
be programmed to run only during &quot;fall asleep&quot; and &quot;waking up&quot; times. :
generally safe and effective - if you have electricity.
