Joel said something about a turtle bus...

My brother made shirts last year in his studio class with
a VW emblem on the front, and a picture of a bus shell with
a turtle head and turtle legs coming out of the wheel wells.

Underneath it all it said &quot;Schalegensnsbus&quot; or something like that.
It meant turtle bus....if anyone wants to see it I can prolly scan it.

Besides the fact that he is my brother, it's some of the best VW related
artwork I have ever seen anywhere...

thought I would share becuase I thought it odd someone else would
mention turtle bus...
