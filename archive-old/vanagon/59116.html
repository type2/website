     Hi Chuck,
     
     This is not a dumb question.  I thank you for wanting to search the 
     archives before posting a really dumb question to the list.
     
     See:
     
     http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives//vanagon.html
     
     It should be easy to figure out from there.  Although determining the 
     most effective search keywords to get what you want is the hardest 
     trick.
     
     Good luck.
