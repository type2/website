Hey Bill

&gt; Oh Oh? What is the prevailing opinion on what to do with gas
&gt;       during winter storage? Does the gas gum up and cause problems?
&gt;      I've been leaving the tank almost full to eliminate condensation,
&gt;     and potential rust problems? Is this the right thing to do?
&gt;    I'm quite paranoid about screwing the Fuel Injection system because
&gt;   I'm clueless about it, and suspect all the parts are Big Bucks!!!
&gt; 
&gt; What should I do with the gas situation before putting the van in an
&gt; unheated shed for the winter? Winter here is severe. -20F not uncommon.
&gt; 

POR-15, the makers of all sorts of strange preservative and restorative
chemicals for your automotive hobby, sells a gas preservative that keeps
your gas from gumming up during winter storage.  If I remember correctly,
you're supposed to add a container of this stuff to your gas, and run your
engine for awhile before storage so that you can get the treated gas
inside your carb(s)/FI.

You can reach the folks at POR-15 at 1-800-457-6715 (In NJ 201-887-1999).
I have no association with these folks but that I've had good experience
with their products.

	Enjoy
