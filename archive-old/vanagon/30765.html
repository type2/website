Subject: jump!

Thanks to those who responded to my questions re: hydraulic lifters and 
setting the valve timing. I got a friend to turn the engine giving me the 
opportunity to view the valve train. As I thought the distributor was in 
180 degrees off, so I switched the plug wires to begin at the new #1 
firing position.  I've cranked it over and it putt puttputt brrrr 
almost starts up but it seems I'm just not getting enough juice to keep 
it cranking - with a fully charged battery (12 hrs on a 2 amp charger) or 
a good battery from another fuel injected vehicle - the same thing. I've 
cleaned the main grounds at the  battery to frame, transaxle to frame and 
added another (also from tranny), and the small ground for the double 
relay. Still the same, the battery starts out as if it were low and the 
ground post connection on the battery gets fairly hot after just a few 
cranks. I cleaned fuse box terminals and, following Muir checked with the 
battery ground cable for any sort of spark on hook-up - none, so I'm 
finding no short to trace.	
 It's been 30's in the a.m. when I get out to the van, and mid-forties 
when I need to quit around noon. This engine's not been run yet and 
currently has 2 qts. of 5w30 and 1-1/2 qts. non-detergent 30w. I plan to 
use this for the initial 15 min run as a flush. It turns over pretty 
easily by hand with a socket on the alternator nut. 	 
  What's the current thought (pun intended) on jump starting these fuel 
injected models? Again, any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
                                     thanks,
                                         Eric
