Subject: Re: Vanagon tire ?

&gt;&gt;What tires are best for '87 Vanagon Westy ?  There are LT's on it now

Just make sure that you buy the reinforced tires, Michelin and Continental
make them, you need the strength in the sidewall for the weight of the
Vanagon and for handling, It is an older design tire, but the Vanagon is not
exactly modern either.... I paid about $60.00 apiece for mine at NTW
