                      RE&gt;&gt;KOMBI ON FIRE or A GOOD WAY TO CLEAN...    10/6/95


&gt;From: SMAHER_at_po2.gi_dot_com


&gt;&gt; The small outlet brass pipe or fitting going to a rubber fuel line to
&gt;&gt; the carburetor had popped out of the fuel pump. It is apparently just
&gt;&gt; a pressure fit.
&gt;
&gt;I have heard of the same fittings falling out of the carb itself.  Anyone
&gt;have this problem?  Glad to here there was no fire.


I had that pipe pop out of a Weber 32/36 progressive in a '69 bus, many
years ago. Engine wasn't running, so no fire there either, luckily. I
mentioned it on this list, and someone said that this was a common problem
with Weber carbs on many different cars.

===============================
I co-worker had the same problem, brass fuel hose fitting coming off of the
carb body on his bus.  Just a friction fit.  Also fortunate, no fire.
