&gt;&gt;	
&gt;&gt;	Specifically does anyone know of upcoming VW events, &quot;Bug-In&quot;'s 
&gt;&gt;etc in the south-central Ontario area.  What about upper New Yrok State?

&gt;Hey, there's an annual bug fest of some sort in Kingston each year, usually 
&gt;at Lake Ontario Park, right next to KPH (the loonie bin, figures) Been to 
&gt;one when I lived there. Look for adverts on telephone polls, it's a high end 
&gt;event by gum!   tim s.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As soon as you find out about the fest, let me know friend!
