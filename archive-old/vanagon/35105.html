&gt; I have just opened up the back (very rusty latch) of my 72 camper
&gt;and found a canvas roll with 2 brackets.  I found where they go - above the
&gt;front seats, but What Are They For??? 

I have seen something similar to this that was a tonaou cover ... but that
was in the back and used to cover the rear storage area.  It could be a
privacy screen...

&gt;        Also, the engine (1700 Type IV) had been rebuilt and when I went to
&gt;time it, there was no mark on either the block or the pulley/crankshaft.
&gt;Any clues?  The only anamoly I found on the pulley was a small area with 2
&gt;flat spots about 1/2 inch apart.  I &quot;timed&quot; it to that and a bolt that I can
&gt;see in the Haynes manual.  I would rather not find TDC by poking something
&gt;in number 1.  

You can find TDC by removing the spark plug from cyl #1 and placing your
finger over the hole (need a good seal).  Remove the distributer cap so you
can watch the rotor turn.  Make a mental note were the #1 plug wire would be.
 ( I mark the side of the distributer housing)  Then, place a wrench on the
pulley and turn the engine by hand.  When the you have to fight the pressure
with your finger this the compression stroke.  Continue turning until you
'feel' the wrench lose its resistance.  Use a flashlight to shine in the
hole.  You should see the piston about an inch or so though the spark plug
hole.  If you can't get the flashlight in the engine compartment easily,
carfully poke the earaser end of a pencil through the plug hole.  It should
go in about an inch before it its the piston.  You are now at top dead
center.  Use a drop of white paint to mark the top of the crankshaft pully.
 This will enable you to set the timing easier with a timing light.

Don't forget to reinstall the distributer cap and the #1 spark plug.
