 Hi,

&gt; i always heard that the Westfalia versions were hinged at the front (of the
&gt; car) with the luggage rack at the rear from 1968-1973 ... and in 1974, the
&gt; roof was hinged at the rear with the luggage area at the rear. but then, in

 That fits my obervations.

&gt; the german stuff i have, Westfalia makes all sorts of different camper models
&gt; .. not just the ones we saw at the u.s. vw dealers.

 Absolutely- Westfalia convert all sorts of vans from VW's to big Mercedes.

&gt; &gt;exist for the '72 thru '79 campers: the Caravette (not Caravelle),

 Caravette (or caravanette) is a fairly normal name for a VW camper in the UK.

&gt; .. according to the Alles uber VW Bus book, (as best i can muddle
&gt; through the german), straight pop-ups could also be several other companies:
&gt; KMM,  Syro,  Joch,   Haas,  EMU,  Berger,  Weinsberg Terra models,
&gt; Voll Rhodos models (full length top, and the whole top goes straight up)

 ...and in the UK VW's have been converted by Devon, Holdsworth, Dormobile
and lots of smaller places- Devon do a big pop-top which is full-length and
hinges at the drivers side, then has a fold out platform which extends above
the sliding door. There's a double bed in the top. On the other hand my folks
had a devon without a pop-top at all.

Cheers,
        W.
