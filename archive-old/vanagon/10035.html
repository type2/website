The only issue here is whether the engine has enough life in it for
another 40,000 miles or so. Have your friend do a compression check and
if all are at 120 or better with the difference between any two not being
greater than 10% than it would seem that everything is ok.

The best choice would be to have a look at the maintenance records.
Suspension, tires and brakes may need attention. A good indicator is the
relative condition of the interior. If the seats are worn and torn,
knobs are broken etc, this may indicate that the vehicle was not well
maintained.


BTW - I had a chance to meet David Schwarze while in SD recently. A great
guy who knows how to drive quickly and in control. He and I hit some of
the best VW shops in the area, and I managed to pick up a few items for
the Westy to boot.
