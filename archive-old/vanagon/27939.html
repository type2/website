HI,

As a past member and current lurker of this list I have decided to come 
 out of hiding and ask the brain trust for help with a problem.

I just bought my third bus (Hello my name is Clay and I am a 
 Bus-aholic) a 78 westphalia for the grand sum of $400 bucks. The 
 engine has good compression and got a thumbs up from my mechanic 
 buddy, but the problem is the tranny is stuck in neutral. I seem to 
 recall that this is a common problem that has come up in the past but 
 I cant remember the answer. If you can help me out I would appreciate it.

Thanks 

Clay

P.S. If anyone near Salt Lake City is need of a great 71 Westy have I 
 got the perfect one for you .
