Subject: Clutch - German/Brazilian???

I'm getting ready to put a new clutch into my '68 Camper.  I see 
several different prices listed in the mail-order catalogs with 
the German parts costing almost twice as much as the Brazilian 
stuff.

Has anybody had any experience using the Brazilian.  What is the 
major differences to look for?  Why would I be better off to 
spend the extra money - or would I.

Any input will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jerry
