Earl:
Test for stuck injector as follows:
1&gt;Remove fuel injectors(two 10m bolts). Do not loose dougnuts on injector
tips!!
2&gt;Unplug coil wire and ground.
3&gt;Unplug all injectors but one.Point that one into a jar.
4&gt;Have someone crank engine.
5&gt;A fine cone of fuel should be pulsed.
6&gt;Repeat 3 thru 5 for other injectors.
Good Luck
