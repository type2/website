Subject: Re: 67  generator

Now my question.. does any know what size socket is needed to take off that
nut on the back of the generator that holds the fan... I have 3/4in sockets
but they are all too small.
- - -

it's a 36mm, like the flywheel nut.  i think its the same as 1 and 7/16 &quot;

When I bought the new generator the leads that the wires connect to are posts
and the old generator has pushdown clips.. any ideas or problems with 
changing the wires, or do I have the wrong generator?
- - - - -
66 and 67 buses came with push on connectors to the generator..  im surprised
you still had them.   to use your new generator  cut off the old connectors
and attach  one wire to a fork, the other to a circle type electric connector
available at your FLAPS.  else find a good used or rebuilt 67 only  generator
(as 66 wasa 6V) to have a vintage pervert approved motor.
