&gt;My 86 $yncro has 110k on and I have not had any problems with the heads.  I 
&gt;hear all these horror stories about getting the heads done.  I want to know 
&gt;what causes the problem.  A long time ago someone told me it was due to 
&gt;electroysis, something to do with the water.  So I have never put any water
&gt;in 
&gt;and have not had any problems yet.

The short story is that corrosion occurs between the rubber head gasket and
the aluminum heads.  Eventually enough corrosion occurs to break the seal
between the gasket and the head and coolant leaks out.  Don't confuse this
coolant gasket with an entirely different seal that is used between the head
and the combustion chamber.
