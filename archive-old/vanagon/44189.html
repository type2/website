Subject: Re: Front VW Emblem installation


Hi,

&gt; &gt;This may be a stupid question but, How do I get to the back side of the
&gt; &gt;front nose panel of my 71 Bus to install the big &quot;VW&quot; emblem?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Ya don't.  Well, at least not to do it stock.  (For security, you might want
&gt; to thread on nuts from inside but I haven't.)...

 Purists will wince: When I re-emblemed my '71 I didn't trust the 
plastic sockets
to retain the badge, given the popularity of VW emblems amongst Beastie
Boys fans at the time, so I pop-rivetted it on (it was Chrome, so they didn't
show up too much). Inelegant, but very effective.

 I used the original holes.
 Cheers,
	W.
