Subject: Furnace-for-camping summary

Thanks for all the suggestions from the forced-air furnace experts, but I 
decided to go with a low-tech propane furnace (Force 10, 6000 BTU from 
West Marine). This is basically a propane fireplace with a stove-pipe 
chimney.

Reasoning:	1)Vented (unlike the catalytic heaters)
		2)No DC requirements (I can still hook up a fan, though.)
		3)Safety features like oxygen sensor and thrmocouple cut-off.
		4)A forced air furnace (12,000 btu min) just seemed 
		overengineered/overkill.	

Minuses:	1)I'll need to put a hole in my roof :(
		2) If I actually park at Jackson Hole Ski Resort in 
		midwinter, I might not get the temperature above freezing :)

I should receive it this weekend; I'll post how it works out....

&gt; Subject: Your proposed propane furnace installation
&gt; 
&gt;      Just got thru reading about Morris' proposed furnace installation.  
&gt;      
&gt;      Some comments
&gt;      
&gt;      6000 btu sounds like it ought to get the job done under most 
&gt;      circumstances - Maybe not at Jackson Hole in mid-winter, though!
&gt;      
&gt;      If this is a forced air furnace, the 2.8 amps goes to operate the fan 
&gt;      motor.  The motor in these usually drives a long shaft with 2 fans 
&gt;      attached.  One for air circuation in your camper, the other for 
&gt;      combustion air supply/exhaust.  I had a 6000 btu furnace in my last 
&gt;      camper (a popup trailer) - and Sear's biggest RV deep cycle battery, 
&gt;      as well.  The fan had to run fast enough to push enough air to 
&gt;      activate a sail switch in the combustion airstream.  (The sail switch 
&gt;      is part of the burner safety circuit.)  My battery would get depleted 
&gt;      enough after 3 nights of relatively cold fall (hunting season) camping 
&gt;      (on the Hoback River about 50 mi from Jackson Hole!) so that it could 
&gt;      not push the sail switch closed - and the gas supply valve would not 
&gt;      open. This occured dispite the fact that the battery still had enough 
&gt;      power to run cabin lights and other accessories OK.  
&gt;      
&gt;      I got one of those small generators and used it to recharge the 
&gt;      battery when out more than 3 days - but the noise drove me nuts!  I 
&gt;      finally got hold of a 2'x4' solar photovoltaic panel - about 50 Watts. 
&gt;      I put this on the roof of the camper and wired down to the battery.  I 
&gt;      discovered that as long as there was good sunlight, I could keep the 
&gt;      battery charged up enough to run the furnace for a week or 10 days.  
&gt;      Never tried longer than that.  Effective as hell, not too high-priced 
&gt;      compared with gas-fired generators - and Quiet, too!!        
&gt;      
&gt;      I assume that you plan to install the furnace and leave it in place.  
&gt;      If so, consider connecting it to the propane supply permanently with 
&gt;      (flared) copper tubing.  Copper tubing doesn't wear out and flared 
&gt;      fitting rarely get loose or leak.  Also, make sure that your vent 
&gt;      ducting is installed in accordance with the mfr's recommendations and 
&gt;      that the vent fitting will effectively prevent people outside from 
&gt;      getting burned.  
&gt;      
&gt;      Most of these RV-type furnaces are &quot;zero clearance&quot; - meaning that 
&gt;      they do not require any extra space, insulation, or other protection 
&gt;      if installed as per mfr's recommendations - you shouldn't have a 
&gt;      problem with getting burned, but it might get too warm for your taste.
&gt;      
&gt;      A final item - if you're going to be out for lengthy trips and away 
&gt;      from commercial propane sources, what are you going to do for added 
&gt;      supply.  Extra tank?  Where will it ride?  How will you connect it to 
&gt;      your camper's distribution system.  You might want to take a look at 
&gt;      the double tank valves they use on large campers.
&gt;      
&gt;      and - - - good luck with your install.
