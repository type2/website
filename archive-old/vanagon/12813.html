Subject: Generic graphic-was Re: bumper sticker - tenative list

I think a good graphic to represent all 4 generations of buses would be, 
literally, a loaf of bread on wheels.  The bread loaf shape is the common 
thread...the graphic could be a bagged or unbagged loaf with little wheels 
sprouting from the corners...
