Subject:  re: Porsche 914 engine size 

&gt; I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
&gt; fit in my '79 Bust.  If it would fit, is it a bolt up, plug in the Bus FI
&gt; stuff and go job or something worse.

&gt;Ignore the Porsche part.  I don't know how big the engine had gotten by 
&gt;'79 but suspect it was bigger than 1700 cc which I think was used in '72 
&gt;or '73.  Judge this engine as a VW engine that is better or worse than 
&gt;what you got now.

By 1976 it is a 2 litre fuel injected engine. I always tell the guys at work
I'm going to get the Porche PROMs for the 'computer' and boost it to 325HP
as soon as I find a source for wheelie wheels;-)
