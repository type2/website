Subject: Re: Rebuilt blocks from &quot;Fast German Auto&quot;

&gt;Thanks for the reply.  If I may ask, what was the total bill and how 
&gt;long did it take?

$2,583 including tax and $600 for the r and r and $320 for the new heads,
and various new parts including new fuel lines, injector seals, intake boot
sleeves, vacuum lines, belts, hoses,  water pump, cap, rotor and plugs.  It
took 3 days.

&gt;Did they rebuild your engine or put a rebuilt one in?

I did it on an exchange basis since I was from out of the area and in a
rush.  They will rebuilt your own if you wish.

Hope this helps.  BTW, I've recommended them to several people who have
also been satisfied.


&gt;&gt; They did a rebuild, as well as the r &amp; r, on my 85 Westy
&gt;&gt; Waterboxer 2 years ago.  I was very happy with their work.  They
&gt;&gt; are very knowledgeable, take time to answer your questions, and are
&gt;&gt; reasonably priced.  In fact, I have an 80 Westy air-cooled I plan
&gt;&gt; to have them do this summer.
