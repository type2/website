Subject: vanagon TV spotting

Yesterday, on Hard Copy (the tv was on when i walked into the room, i swear
i don't watch this show  :) ) they had an &quot;article&quot; on high speed police
chases.  

They were talking about new methods for stopping criminals and one was a
small rocket-powered sled that would shoot out of the front of the cop car
and roll under the offender's car and &quot;disable&quot; their electrical system
(don't ask how).  Well, they had test footage showing what looked like a &gt;
86 vanagon being chased and fired upon.

im not sure a vanagon would represent much of a pursuit challenge, but i
guess it was for testing purposes (good ground clearance?)...
