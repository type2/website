&gt;I'd appreciate it.  I'm wondering which kind to look for (on top, back, or
&gt;hanging from the front) and where to get one that fits the lovely form of
&gt;the bus!!!!  Thanks in advance!!!

i just called two of the bike shops in town and this is what they said:
shop1: only got Thule brand, roof mounts only. $300. ouch. said that
       front mounts might be illegal in some states (blocking headlights,
       etc.).

shop2: got Rhode-gear brand. recommends bike carrier that fits into trailer
       hitch (for either 'receiver' hitch or ball hitch). about $100. after
       that, would recommend roof rack: better security. also said some
       states wouldn't like front racks. said that rear hatch racks were
       not too secure (could be unbolted and run away with). said you wanted
       to carry only two bikes per rack (except for roof rack) ... otherwise
       too heavy.

since i don't ride a bike (worn-out old knees, don't you know. wounded in
the crimea, you see), i can't say one way or the other. but check at the
bike shops. both places seemed to have no problem with it being either a
vw bus or a vw vanagon.

good luck.
