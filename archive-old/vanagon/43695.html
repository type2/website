Subject: Can I trust an engine rebuild ?


hi all,
have to make a decision on a syncro westy for sale, possibly
in next few hours. Has hi miles (over 130k), but had an engine
rebuild at 125k, from Bill Barry -- vw dealer nr. Hartford CT).

Drove really great (much better than the 4 or so others I've driven
over the past year.) Asking price will be high, but I'm inclined to feel
it's worth it. Original tranny, but viscous coupling replaced.

Is this almost like getting a new engine, and can it be trusted for another
100-150k if well maintained?

any advice appreciated.
...and if you have the time, you can page me at 800-987-5863.
I'll call you back for a quicker answer.
thanks,
--Jonah
