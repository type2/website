Subject: Re: Front end sitting too high.

This may be a real stupid thing to note about high front ends, but have
you considered the level of the vehicle when it's being driven; i.e.,
when there are two people in the front. My '72 really looked like a
sagwagon, but it looked far more level when a couple of folks actually
rode in it.

BTW, I know this isn't great for checking the oil -- &quot;hey, honey, climb in
to see if I'm a 1/2 pint low&quot; -- but it's something to consider about the
vehicle really running at speed.

My bus also looked a tad better after installing new shocks in the back.
Sure improved the ride as well.
