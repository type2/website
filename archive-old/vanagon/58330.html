Subject: Vanagon Vent Control Positions

Volks,
Have 87GL w/rear heater and no manual, only the Bentley which can't help
me. I need someone to tell me the position of all four knobs for maximum
COLD! Down here in the Houston Area just the wafting of heat from
anywhere is of concern, and I have figured out exactly how to ensure all
vent controls are in maximum cold, meaning for use with A/C, that is no
hot water in front or rear heater cores and no HOT Texas outside air
getting in. I understand the bottom two control knobs on the four
vent/heater controls are for the rear heater, someone tell me how to
position the entire vent/heater panel to ensure the A/C will be most
efficient on recycle mode.
