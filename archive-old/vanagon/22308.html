Subject: no rust !

    spent some quality time under my 73 bus yesterday, and i noticed for the
first time the absence of any rust down there. pretty amazing, actually, i
thought, after 22years...would be nice to keep it that way. you guys do
anything to the underside of your buses ? my bus has some black gummy stuff
on the underside, but it's peeling off in places...should i do anything to
it ? mebbe presure wash underside, then put on a new coat of that black
gummy stuff (what is it ???)...
