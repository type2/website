One more thought, before you go to bed, soak each head in wd40 overnight
and then again in the morn, they may be rusted. The flywheel will fall
off after that (using an extension on atorque wrench) and make sure you check
the oil seal and
felt spacer if they are in good shape. let me know how its going - DC --
