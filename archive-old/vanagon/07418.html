Subject: Recipe for Diesel #1
Date: Thu, 1 Dec 1994 10:09:33 -0700 (MST)

Hello vanagonites,
Does anyone know of the recipe for diesel #1.  My wife, actually  asked it
in that way after my brake fluid feast.  Our vanagon seems to really prefer
to run on diesel #1, the milage is higher, starting is much easier, etc.
However, unless it's 14 below here, we can only get diesel #1 by driving
a long ways (140 miles round trip).
Also, if anyone has great knowledge about diesel in general (the fuel)
i would like to know what type of process produces diesel.  What makes
diesel ultimately cheaper than gasoline?
Thanks,
Stuart
