Subject: Re: put on new oilcooler

The problem with mounting the cooler in front of the air intake is now you
have hot air goin' to all 4 cylinders.  Sure the oil is runnin' cooler, but
the head temp has gone up I bet, shortening the valve life somewhere down the
road.  I'd have stuck it outside in the air flow to keep the intake air as
cool as possible.  I fried a pair of decent heads doin' it that way about 8
years ago.

Just my .005 cents worth :)
