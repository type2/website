Subject: Re: !#?*_at_? Exhaust

Dan Geer asks how to get exhaust system parts fabricated.  It is not inex-
pensive, but your local auto parts deskman will know who the hotrodders
go to to have headers and muffler systems made up.  The VW layout will be
novel for them, but they have all the raw materials.  Because of the cost,
on a stock VW van I would need a very specific reason to have stuff 
fabricated rather than using the JCWhitney pieces.
