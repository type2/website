Subject: Re: Performance Stuff?

I know you have this other motor and all, but if you really want performance,
Kennady Engineering (see archive for address) has a kit to install the Suburu
Leg-I-See motor. It has something like 150 hp and 110 lb/feet of torque.

best o' luck

I hate to be a smarty-pants, but just an FYI, 

The Type I and Type III motors (like in this '67) have no &quot;drive pulley&quot;
seals. the little end of the crankshaft is open to the air, and just has a
little oil &quot;slinger&quot;.
