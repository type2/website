Subject: Re: '66 progress, engine in

&gt;more.  After three iterations of this, then engine fit in but still interfered
&gt;a little with the bell-housing.  I then used the starter/new battery to crank
&gt;the engine around and scrape the last little bit from the bell-housing.
&gt;Finally, with the four mounting bolts tight, the engine still cranks over.
&gt;Clearancing finished.  (using a grinder would have made this job easier
&gt;but I'm chicken of grinding and producing heat with magnesium since I
&gt;have no idea how to extinguish a magnesium fire.  CO2 extinguisher I guess)

I thought the bell-housing/transmission case was made from aluminum and just
the upright engine cases were made from magnesium.  ??
