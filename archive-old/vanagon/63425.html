Subject:      93 EV clutch request

Well my 1993 EV MV with 84,000 miles on it has just about blown it's clutch.
 Ogf course it's the week we most need the vehicle since two of my kds have
to be at different lessons at the same time.  I'm in search of parts and
hopefully reasonable prices (as in less than VW).  My mechanic says he can do
the job next Monday...so there goes our vacation to NJ to see my new niece.
 Ron, remember me?  Thank you again for the timely brake shoes - here's what
I need for the clutch:

clutchplate
Disk
Throwout bearing
Main seal

I hope I got them right.  Any help and guidelines would be much appreciated.
 This will be our mechanic's first EV repair - we're all hoping it goes
smoothly.

Other than this we've been pretty happy with the van.  The AC blew out but
that was with the previous owner.  The paint is terrible tho - much too much
rust for it's young years.  And we also have the side decals balling up.  And
the stereo leaves alot to be desired - we have to crank it up and can barely
hear it it seems.  But I have faith that over the years it will serve us
well.
