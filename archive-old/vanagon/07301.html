NO!  DON'T SCRAP IT!  Unless the body is completely
coming apart, it can be repaired via cut-outs and 
welds, and there are people out there (such as myself)
who are willing to take such a project on.  As long as
it runs well, I can't imagine you'll have that much
trouble selling the Bus whole, especially if it's not
overpriced.  If the body is shot, you shouldn't have
too much trouble parting it out.  BTW, give a howdy to
eastern Pa.-- I used to live in Gettysburg.
