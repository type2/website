No, I didn't sell my van out of frustration. My wife talked me into buying
a Westy for Mother's day.  It's a two toned - white and cream '82 Deisel.

My thought was that I'd rebuild my extra engine and put it back in the '84
and take the engine in the '84 and put it in the deisel.  So, I'll be
asking lots of questions about that conversion soon.
