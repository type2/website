Joe asked...
&gt; A used VW parts seller near me told me that I should replace the 34PICT3 in
&gt; my '71 bus with a SOLEX 3031. Don't know anything about it, but he claims
&gt; it's an easy install with a kit that attaches it to the intake
&gt; manifold...will solve idling problems, increase performance, etc. ...$140
&gt; locally.

To which Poor Richard replied...
&gt; I believe that your '71 is a dual port. If so, DO NOT use the 30/31.
&gt; While these are great for single port engines, for dual ports, they have
&gt; a small adaptor plate, which really decreases the efficiency a lot,
&gt; leading often to a &quot;flat spot&quot; in your acceleration. If your 34 is fine,
&gt; keep it, if it has problems, you should go ahead and rebuild it for a
&gt; few bucks...
&gt; All IMHO of course.

Well, IMHO, and running three SOLEX 30/31s on 1600DP (2) and 1600SP (1),
I would not run any other new SOLEX.  The price is steep, but not much
higher that I paid here in Kansas City.
