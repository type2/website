Subject: Checking Hydraulic Lifters

Howdy all

I have some lifter clatter on the '80 Vanagon I'm getting rid of.  But 
I'm driving it on a daily basis until the person buying the engine has a 
chance to drive it.  But I noticed a clatter like a valve tapping.  So I 
checked it last week and found an adjusting screw that had flattened.  So 
I replaced it.  But there's still some clatter, and it seems like the #4 
intake valve is kind spongy.  I think the lifter has been bad since it 
came from GEX, the reciepts say that there was lifter niose at about 400 
miles, and the valves were readjusted.  And that there was noise at take 
off at about 1000 miles, but that they didn't see a problem.

Does it seem like it's a bad lifter?
Or how do you check if a lifter is bad?

Bradley
