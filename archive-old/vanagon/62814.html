Subject: purchase advice 80 westy
Date: Fri, 11 Jul 97 13:47:09 EDT

i guess i am officilly a wannabus (just have to convince my wife she's =
a 
wannabus too!  she still has nightmares about travelling in my 67 dodge =
van 
back in the college days)

Thanks to all who responded to my purchase advice about a 1980 westy.

just got back from looking at it.  I must have been the first one to look=
 as the 
owner cleaned it up very nicely from when i drove by yesterday.

interior was very nice except all the wall panels seemed to be losing =
the 
coverings (contact paper?) 

Canvas is in great shape, nice and tight and clean.  Cabinet paneling =
was in 
good shape except for the trim pieces along the edges.  some cracked, =

slipping.  

Dash was clean, no cracks.  seat coverings were good.

ran beautifully.  I was quite surprised at how smooth it ran.  downside =
was it 
was dripping oil on the passenger side exhaust and smoking like crazy. =
 after 
test drive a puddle about the size of a silver dollar quickly appeared =
and 
smoke came up from under the wheel wells.  Any thoughts as to what can =
leak 
oil onto the exhaust. (near were it bolts to engine, right in line with =
the 
rear tires?

undercarriage looked clean. only rust was around lower corner rear window=
..

does not have stove or refrig, just sink and icebox. 

shifted and rode nice.

poptop seals were brittle and cracked.

I am making an appoinment w/ local vw guy to check it out for me.

thanks again
