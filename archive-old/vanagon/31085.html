Subject:  RE&gt; Sleeping in Campers                 Ref:

This input on sleeping in campers and hitting one's head brings new meaning to
the old expression of &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;.      :-)

As Sancho says in Man of LaMancha to &quot;Don Quixoti:  &quot;Whether the pitcher hits
the stone, or the stone hits the pitcher, it's going to be bad for the
pitcher!&quot;
