Subject: Help with 81 Westy please
Date: Mon, 16 Jan 1995 09:41:13 -0600 (CST)

I have a friend looking at an '81 Westy that is for sale.  The guy is 
asking $2,000 before any talking.  It might be cheaper.  I haven't 
seen this bus, it is half a continent away.  From reports:  this guy 
is the second owner, 94,000 miles on original motor, little or no 
rust, interior in good shape, pop top and canvas good, motor leaks oil
(possibly from one of the heads?).  I don't know what this last thing 
means.  Do these motors have push rod tubes like my '71?  I guess what
I want to know is how much he might have left on the motor.  From 
there, can we guess what might be a more accurate price.  Hell, it 
might be a good deal now!?  Could someone please let me know.  Oh, 
BTW, the guy looking at doing the buying is the same one who sold me 
the '71.  He misses it.  :)  Thanks, Jim
