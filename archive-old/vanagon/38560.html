Subject: Should I buy? followup
From: &lt;alfresco_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

Thank you for all of the advise and information you have all sent me.  
The 83 Westy I was inquiring about has a water cooled engine.  Beyond 
that I don't know much more.  I am still trying to get the serial # off 
of it so that I can go back to the previous dealer who might then be so 
kind as to tell be the original owner.  I will probably not get this 
camper, so if any one else wants to look into it, you are more than 
welcome.  Word of warning; it's located at a used car lot run out of a 
trailer.  This lot sells mostly boats on wheels (cadilacs, etc.)  The 
owner is not real cooperative either, he won't let me take it off the 
lot to my own mechanic.  Get the picture?

83 Westfalia Vanagon L
   Watercooled Engine
   Little Rust
   200,000 on the odometer
   $2,500
   Located in Louisville, KY

I will keep checking my mail, if you want the phone number, just ask.
Thanks again, all the info I received I will keep for future reference. 
 I am still looking, but obviously need to learn a lot more before I 
make the big commitment.
