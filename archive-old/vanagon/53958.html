Subject: Re: vanagon keys???

&gt; &gt; Another question,,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My 82&quot; vannagon only came with one key...it fits the ignition and the drivers
&gt; &gt; door....did it have another key that fits the hatch and other 2 doors???
&gt; 
&gt; The original setup on my '81 was 2 keys; one for ignition, one for all 
&gt; other doors, including hatch.

That's different for me!  My '80 has one-key-fits-all, except the fuel cap,
which had a totally differnt key.  My '86s have one-key-fits-all except
the glove-box key on the GL (the Kombi has no glove box lock).  Really odd.

I responded that he should get a key punched to code.  My keys were very worn,
and the difference using newly punched keys was striking.  He should check
the codes on the two front door locks to see if they are the same.  If they've
been changed, the dealer can re-key the lock so they match.  I thought about
making all of my Vanagons match, but had already gotten new keys punched for
all.
