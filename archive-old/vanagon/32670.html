&gt;Last night, was travelling home and saw an early model bus (sorry, I'm not
&gt;yet fluent with all of the model years) with the following bumper sticker:
&gt;I BRAKE FOR POSSUMS
[remainder deleted]

======Two possibilities here - 

1)  With the colder temps at night and the repeated re-flattening during the
days to work out excess moisture, we have the option for organically produced
&quot;freeze dried&quot; possum  !

2)  Alternately, a good source for the &quot;Road Kill Cafe&quot; !!

Boy am I glad it's Friday!!!
