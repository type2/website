&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Pioneer subwoofer TSW-X50 (fits inside your spare tire rim).  Fits
&gt; inside wheels that are 13&quot; or wider.  You need an amp of 40 or 50 watts
&gt; RMS to produce strong bass.  13.75&quot; diameter x 4.75&quot; depth,
&gt; Item # 130TSWX50, $129.95.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone already has these, or gets them, I know I and probably others
&gt; on the list would be interested in your comments.....

We were discussing this one over on the corrado list and after
a few calls to Crutchfield and one guy who bought it, the concensus
seemed to be you just can't get sufficient bass from such a small
driver, though it is a real slick idea for a small hatch, but since
you still got to mount the amp somewhere and the displaced jack in
a Corrado, didn't seem much better than getting a small (6.5&quot;) bazooka
with a built in amp, plus on a Bus who cares anyway? Plenty o room
for anything.
