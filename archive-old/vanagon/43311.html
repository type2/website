Hello, fellow Vanagoners -

In less than a month my family will be moving from Boston to Okinawa 
(a little jump, yes).  Since the US Air Force is conscientiously saving your
(USA readers') tax dollars by limiting our allowance for moving expenses, we 
must divest ourselves of many possessions which we have accumulated over the 
years.

We already sold the house, so next down the list of valuable-items-that-we-
can't-take-with-us is the '85 GL.  I'll be driving it across the US starting
in Boston on June 23, going through the San Francisco Bay area and then heading
up to Redmond, WA.  I plan to take about 2-3 weeks for the whole trip.

If you're in the Seattle area and are at all interested in getting your hands 
on a nice '85 Vanagon GL (not a Westy) then contact me at: getschow_at_an.hp_dot_com 
before June 14 (that's my last day at work).  If you reply directly to this 
address (ringo_at_spike.aerodyne_dot_com) then it will have to be before June 6 
because the  movers are coming the next day and they'll take the computers with 
them.  (If you're working out the dates and are confused - tough. I've explained
the gory details to everybody-and-his-brother already and you don't wanna know...)
You can also call me at 617-275-1739 (this number goes away around June 23).

I'm a &quot;motivated seller&quot; so this is your chance to score.  I'm going to this
list first because I'd like to find the bus a good home.  

-cg

PS:  If anyone has useful tips (beyond the obvious) for traveling long distances
with two kids (ages 8 &amp; 6) and two large dogs (ages 12 &amp; 8) via Vanagon, I'd 
love to hear them.
