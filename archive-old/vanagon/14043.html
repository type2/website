Subject: Re: Buying a vanagon

&gt;For a couple of months now i have been on the intense search for a vw van of 
&gt;some sort, i have settled on a vanagon, preferrably 85 and up, i'm having 
&gt;great trouble finding any!!!  does anyone have any suggestions as to where i 
&gt;can purchase one.  I called all the vw dealers in my area and two were 
&gt;expecting trade-ins on vanagons, but one felll thru (damn, it had the 
&gt;weekender package) and another is expecting an 87 camper.  by the way... can 
&gt;the stove and sink and refrig be taken out of the westys so you can increase 
&gt;space?
&gt;
&gt;Hey I am up here in Edmonton, Alberta. I am about to put my 1991 Vanagon GL 
on the market. It is a one of a kind van with dual sliding doors on both 
sides, electric door locks, 7 passenger bucket seats, dark red paint with 
Ming finish, ultra-tinted windows, VW mag wheels w\ mag spare, dual 
batteries, stainless steel exhaust system, deluxe stereo package (still 
sounds like crap), gas heater, VW floor mats throughout, VW sunroof(I picked 
up in Germany and installed professionally here), bra, and I had the molded 
bumpers and mirrors professionally painted to match the van's paint...so it 
is an ultra kewl Vanagon to say the least. It's water cooled and has the 
remander of the extended warranty to 100 000 km or 1997, having only 65 
000km on it right now...and I would like to get $16,000 obo Canadian for it.
