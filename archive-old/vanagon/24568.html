Speaking of states that cannot trust their residents' intelligence and
competence to pump gas, New Jersey is one of them.  The average level
of intelligence must somehow be higher in PA, since we are allowed to
pump our own gas :-)

 &gt; with or without third brake lights below their hairlines. The people I
