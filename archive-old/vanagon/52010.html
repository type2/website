Subject: Bent my bumper

...There I was, tooling through the snow on Hwy 520, laughing at the ditchbound
yuppies in their Land Rovers when the rear end broke loose on the ice.  Smacked
the concrete jersey barrier and bent the front bumper on my '86 GL.  Need a new
one.  Got one?  Know where I can get one in the Seattle area?
