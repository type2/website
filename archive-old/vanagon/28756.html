Subject: Re: 1980 Vanagon Engine Work

&gt;1.  Can a novice drop this engine and do the work? (I had two years of
&gt;auto mechanics back in 76 through 78 and did work on my Fiat, Opel and
&gt;Mercedes during
&gt;ny younger days but certainly not a engine rebuild)
&gt;
&gt;2.  If I can, does anybody have a line on parts with a good price?
&gt;
&gt;3.  Is the procedure documented in one of the popular manuals?
&gt;
&gt;I just left my friendly neighborhood VW specialist and he'll do the job
&gt;for $5,000 plus -  Ouch :-(
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all....

Well, finally, there's another novice on this list who feels equally akward
as I do around engines.  I have thought about rebuilding my own 81 Westy,
without the benefit of prior VW rebuild knowledge.  I'm chicken.  Maybe you
have more guts.  I have gone through 8 engines in mine, replaced by others.
So, even the experts are having trouble getting good engines.  The
guys/gals on this list have the answer - if you are going to drive an
aircooled learn how to do your own work, or be prepared to suffer through
multiple engine transplants.  Same goes for Wasserboxers.

Things to look out for if you hire it done:  Don't go to VW.  They usually
get their engines from a Canadian rebuilder.  Nothing against the other
great N. American state, but I went through 3 of these in less than 10,000
miles.  The third expired right after the 1 yr warranty.  Other rebuilders
are equally bad.  GEX in S. Cal. has been the supplier for the last
engines.  The first 2 were sent back by my good Porsche shop owner within
500 miles.  The third, which I'm happy to say seems strong at 1000 mi. got
special care from GEX, the wholesaler, and my mechanic.  The second engine
I had (after the original one) was from a rebuilder, but the shop
thoroughly went over the rebuild, like these guys do with their own
engines.  It lasted a reasonable time, before dropping a valve seat.  My
advice - learn by doing, or cozy up to an experienced VW mechanic you trust
to supervise a rebuild by others (don't know of any who will take the time
to rebuild from ground up).  This process should cost you around $3000 -
$3500 for the engine.  Be sure to get a full 1 year warranty.  I paid an
extra $300 for 3 year warranty from GEX.  Lotsa luck!
