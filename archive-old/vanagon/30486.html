Subject: Too slow, too bad

So Steve sez:

...Rusty van Bondo...sticker...&quot;TOO SLOW, TOO BAD!&quot;

Hmmm. Has anybody taken a look at www.got_dot_net/~egallant/the_road.html, or
.../guilty.html in particular? Sounds familiar :-)

Thom:
&gt;Even the happiest of amoebae lack sexual organs.
Would you say that this is a coincidence? :-)))))
