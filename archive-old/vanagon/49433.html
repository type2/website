&gt; I have both a CA equipped '80 westi and a non-CA '80 Westi.
&gt; I have been reviewing Skip's archives to determine the differences in
&gt; the FI system.  Most of the components are the same, but where there
&gt; are differences, the Bosch name for a component is not the same as
&gt; the Bently or Haynes name.  Could someone provide a description and
&gt; location of the following parts?
&gt; 
&gt; ECU - Exchange    non-CA only
&gt; (not a clue what or where this is)

Electronic Control Unit, IE the computer, mounted on right side up
where the air intake snout goes to, big electrical connector goes
there

&gt; 
&gt; Resistor Unit         non-CA only
&gt; (is this mounted on the LF firewall consisting of lots of white wires
&gt; attached to white cylindrical objects surrounded by aluminum)

YEP
&gt; 
&gt; Combi-Relay          different model numbers CA vs non-CA
&gt; (is this the fuel pump relay mounted on the LF firewall with a square
&gt; connector from the FI wiring harness and another square connector
&gt; from the main wiring harness?)

YEP
&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum Limiter      different model numbers CA vs non-CA
&gt; (is this the big vacuum biscuit mounted above the engine or the
&gt; deceleration valve mounted on the vertical engine tin or something
&gt; else altogether)

YEP
&gt; 
&gt; AIr Flow Meter      different model numbers CA vs non-CA
&gt; (I assume that this is the Air Flow valve that is the throttle cable
&gt; attaches to?)

Nope this is the silver part mounted on the plastic  air filter intake
box at the upper end of the rubber snorkel pipe going down to the
throttle valve which is what you are talking about.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW what/where are the following parts. They are the same, but I want
&gt; to be educated on my FI system.
&gt; 
&gt; Temperature Sensor Coolant
&gt; 
&gt; Thermo-Time Switch (NOT the Cold Start Valve)

This misnomer is cause the Thermo-time switch is also used in water
pumpers, it is a bit hard to find, as it resides under the air
distribution manifold (the clack thing the 4 intake pipes come out of)
If you look behind the distributor, under the manifold, under the cold
start valve on the manifold you will see an electrical connector
attached to something, this is the thing, its on the left side as
you look at the engine, now the part it controls, the aux air bypass
regulator or whatever you wish to call it is on the right side on
the block in back of the distibution manifold.
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to move all the CA equipment from CA bus to the non-CA
&gt; bus &amp; I want to get all the right equipment, but don't want to
&gt; exchange parts unecessarily.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; - Jeff + (2) '80 Westi's, '67 Sqbk, '64 Ford Crewcab, '87 Subaru 4WD
&gt; Grass Valley, California

Hope this helps, Good Luck
