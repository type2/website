&gt;Can anyone recommend a suitable paint for the vanagon grills? I don't want it

i used Rustoleum Semi-Gloss Black Barbecue Grill and Patio-Furniture Paint ...
in the spray can ... from Sears. :)

the trick (imnsho) is to lightly sand the part you want to paint with some
really find sandpaper (wet or dry) then clean it off really well. i put about
20 (maybe 30) coats of paint on it, just lightly spraying it until it looked
slightly wet, then waiting about five minutes for it to 'dry'. it's still
looking nice and dull and black after five years and 38,923,176.3 insects
crashing themselves into it.
