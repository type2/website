How should one interpret temperature fluctuations when you would not expect
it from the weather or driving conditions?
Since renewing the coolant in my 84 GL the temperature on the gauge has
oscillated between about 25% and 50% of the gauge, during the course of one
hour journeys across town.
Could this indicate air in the system or is it normal?
Also I have not had the car long enough to know how much it should be
dependent on the outside temperature.
