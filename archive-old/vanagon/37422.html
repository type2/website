&gt;As for washing the foam pad you step on it a lot with soapy water inside.
&gt;Then the problem is getting the soap out as the foam holds about 1 ton of
&gt;water, especially the foam pad that is inside the cover over the engine
&gt;compartment.
&gt;
&gt;The only way to get the soap/water out of the foam pad inners was to put 
two
&gt;giant pieces of plywoods down in the driveway with the foam in between and
&gt;then drive on the plywoods. Squeezes all the water out fast;


Yet another use for the most classic car of them all!

Volkswagen does it... again!    :^)
