I've been having a gas smell appear in my bus lately. Where do these 
recovery tubes hook up to the gas tank?

&gt; &gt;Today I was looking at my bus (1974, non-FI) and noticed some weird 
&gt; &gt;things in the airscoops.  There seems to be some metal tubing that comes 
&gt; &gt;up out of the engine, bends and heads back down into the engine 
&gt; &gt;compartment.  This tubing is about 1/4&quot; in diameter, and at the top there 
&gt; &gt;is a section that is about 1&quot; in diameter and about 6&quot; long.  Is it some 
&gt; &gt;kind of sensor or mechanical thermostat.  I know there is one under the 
&gt; &gt;engine, but is this part of it.  The tubing seems to be on both sides of 
&gt; &gt;the bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any ideas what this is?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I do.  These tubes are part of the fuel Vapor revory system.  They conect
&gt; from the top of the Gas Tank and lead back to the Carbon Canister at the top
&gt; of your engine compartment.  They are routed way up in the air on both sides
&gt; so that fuel can not siphpon onto a hot engine.  The carbon canister collects
&gt; fuel vapors when the engine is not runnig.  When the engine is running, the
&gt; combination of engine vacuum,(that valve on the air cleaner), and the cooling
&gt; fan, send these vapors into the engine to be burned off. Hopefully, this
&gt; syetm is still intact.  I have seen this system partially dissasembled allow
&gt; fuel to be spilled onto the engine after overfilling the tank and then having
&gt; the fuel expand.
