I just bought a Cannondale, hope it works out.

Did  the occupants appear to be screaming?  It is likely they were going
downhill and couldn't slow the damn rig down :-)

&gt; Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; I see you ride a Cannondale bike. I just bought mine and love it. It is
&gt; the forerunner to the Delta-V bikes of today.  The rear suspension is
&gt; passive.  The quadra 21-r on the front works well. I am amazed how light
&gt; the frames are on these bikes. I just hope they are not fragile!
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure the camper was not pulling the vanagon??

&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On our way back from our weekly pilgrimage from Rhode Island to New
&gt; &gt; Hampshire in our '84 Westy,  we saw a most interesting sight.  We were
&gt; &gt; traveling down 128 (really 95 south), when my girl friend said look at
that,
&gt; &gt; pointing to a enormous 30+ foot motor home trailer that we were
approaching.
&gt; &gt; Never having seen such a large trailer on this road we both stared as
we
&gt; &gt; passed it, what we saw next almost knocked me out of my seat.  This
huge
&gt; &gt; motor home trailer was being towed by a ~89 VW Vanagon!   The Vanagon
was
&gt; &gt; even keeled and travailing down the road at 65 mph.  This came as quite
a
&gt; &gt; shock to me especially since I just spent the last 2 hours in NH trying
to
&gt; &gt; get my unloaded Westy to go up the slightest of hills!   Anyway, is the
2.1
&gt; &gt; that much more powerful then the 1.9??  What gives here, I've never
seen
&gt; &gt; anything like this and don't know if it's normal.
&gt; &gt; Next issue, heat.  I can't turn the heat completely off in my van. 
I've
&gt; &gt; turned the control to the 'cold' setting and made sure the vents are
closed,
&gt; &gt; but the center heating unit under the dash in the middle still heats up
and
&gt; &gt; pushes hot air out around the closed vents.   This also happens with
the
&gt; &gt; rear heater, even when the switch is turned to 'no heat' hot air still
leaks
&gt; &gt; out.  Is this the price I must pay for heat during the winter, or is
there a
&gt; &gt; way to turn the heat off completely?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Mike D.
