Subject: Rabbit List?

In addition to my '86 Westy, I have an '84 Diesel Rabbit that I bought
new. I haven't done anything to it except change the oil every 3K, and
it still rattles and clatters along as reliably as always, getting 45-47
mpg. It now has 150K on it and has developed an oil leak. It drips down
from somewhere, collects on the right rear corner of the block, and then
makes a puddle on the ground. I've replace the valve cover and pan
gaskets, to no avail. Is there a similar list for Rabbits to which I
could subscribe, and possibly get an answer?

Thanks,

Joe
