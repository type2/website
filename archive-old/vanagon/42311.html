Subject: Good paint shop in Bay Area


My mom wants to keep her close friend, Sadie, alive indefinitely (not a
rational decision, but then again owning a '68 breadbox is more of an
emotional situation anyway...) and would like Sadie to look good on the
outside as she cruises down Highway 1. In order to get there, Sadie
needs some minor body work (small rust, small dents) and a GOOD paint
job.

Can anybody recommend a good paint/body shop in Northern California and
suggest general costs of such work?

Much appreciated!

Steve
