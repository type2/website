Subject: VW and good advertising

&gt;It never ceases to amaze me that VW holds so tightly to

&gt;Not only is it good advertising, but testament to their
&gt;product quality that the old ones are still going, yet they
&gt;seem to want to do anything possible to discourage anything
&gt;but buying new product from them.

Like many others, while restoring my '56 sedan I would myself returning to
the same VW dealer. Their support was amazing. One day the boss came over
to the parts counter and said that I could have a 15% discount on all
spares, any time. Pushing my luck, I asked why. His reply was that VAG
couldn't buy the kind of advertising an old restored vehicle represented.
In the end they were even loaning me strange tools with strange numbers.
