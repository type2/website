I may have mentioned this before, BUT... How about taking to somebody
who has had some experience with Vanagon AC?  They will tell you that a
buzzing noise coming from up front IS PERFECTLY NORMAL!  That's what I
was told when I got mine 7 or 8 years ago and it is no problem!  I
suppose you could install rubber mounts on everything a get it worked
out, but I highly suggest if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
