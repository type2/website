&gt;&gt; What about the stat that says young single males have more
&gt;&gt; wrecks, and drain more payments from insurance companies,
&gt;&gt; than do any other group? I should know, I was one once.
&gt;
&gt;I have never seen any proof of the numbers they use.  I'm partic'ly toqued
&gt;'cause they ding me good for the 911.  However, all the people with
&gt;911s I've seen don't drive them as recklessly as the people with the
&gt;japanese psuedo sportscars.


Well, now, you make me stop and think. In fact, I have also never seen
actual proof of this stat, either. I've just been hearing it ever since
Driver Training, which was a LONG time ago, and I have simply believed
it. It makes sense to me that young people would drive more recklessly,
but that doesn't constitute proof.

What form would this proof take? Very long casualty lists? Color 8x10's?
This can get complicated.

But I still think this can be studied.
