Subject: Replacing bolts
Date: Tue, 18 Jul 1995 09:27:01 -0500 (CDT)

I was wondering if someone could tell me which nuts and bolts should 
absolutly be replaced upon installing a new motor.  On my '71 bus the 
Bentley says to replace the rear engine carrier bolts.  These are the 
ones holding the brace across the back.  Should the four main 
nuts/bolts also be replaced?  Anything else?  I am reading and 
rereading Muir, Bentley and Haynes.  Sometimes you wouldn't think they
were talking about the same vehicle.  Thanks, Jim
