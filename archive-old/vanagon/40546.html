Subject: advice on the 71

Thanks for the info and comments about the 71 camper, unfortunately I must
pass on the bus :-(. I went to take a look at before and this time I
brought a jack to look around underneath. I found that the frame is
cracked, err ...I mean broken, with about a half inch gap separating the
metal of the frame rail. I guess that is the reason that the owner only
drove it for a month and not the blown gasket story the owner gave me.
Hopefully I will find that camper that I am dreaming of soon. For now I
will settle for the 78 bus I have. At least I have one to drive :-). I
guess I will spend the money to keep the 78 going until the right bus comes
along. Thanks again for everyones advice and comments.
