Hi Vangonauts,

I'm passing this on from a friend in Georgia (USA).  This is all I know 
about it:
---
&quot;I found an 83 Westy here for sale, but I cannot buy it.  Mileage-wise is
has 136K. Complete for $1100.+-.  Some body damage to front end.
Could be driven, he says.&quot;

&quot;My wife will not allow another stationary bus in my yard. You may want to
post for others. (706-863-6159 Expressway Imports). All Westy stuff is intact
with good canvas and parts. Great to part out if you had the time. Thanks.&quot;

Good Luck,
