Subject: Deadheads on-line?


I was passing thru a small town in Vermont last night in my '66 bus
and the people went NUTS!  Waving, flagging me down asking me to join them
at their campsites, honking, etc.  I appear to have stumbled upon
a G.Dead concert location.  

Unfortunately I have to work today:-(

I understand their is a mail list for Deadheads 'cause I do want to catch
a (or a series of) concert at some point (hopefully soon) and I'd like to
find out when and where they are at any given time.

If anyone has any info about the mail list please drop me a line.
