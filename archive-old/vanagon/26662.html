&gt;Okay, I once had 28 passengers in my van...
&gt;Anyone had more?
&gt;I also once had 89 bundles of 12 phone books each, which completely
&gt;filled the 85 floor to ceiling back to front with only enough room to
&gt;drive and see thru the windshield, and both outside mirrors.
&gt;That was not a nice drive.. For me or the van.

OK, I can't top either of these, but...

I load the equipment and personnel of a 4-piece rock'n roll band in my '84. 
 Everything easily fits in, and we ride in VW style and comfort.  I heard 
that during the first Stones tour of England, they used a VW bus.  Well, we 
only tour Minneapolis, but it's exciting even during the shortest drives...
