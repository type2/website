Well, in celebration of my one year rebuild tranny anniversary:

Last October, my tranny was giving me problems.  My girlfriend and I were   
not talking because she decided to make sense and I didn't like that!   
 So, I took the risk one Saturday morning of driving my Van to the tranny   
shop to have it diagnosed.  One mile into the trip, my the tranny stopped   
turining the wheels.  So I turned off, turned it back on and was able to   
complete another half a mile before it gave up on me again.

At this point I tried shifting it all over the place to see if something   
would just fall into place so that I can complete the remaining 2 miles.   
 When I went to start it, the engine wouldn't turn over.  I tried and   
tried again, and ( not knowing much about cars ) though that I managed to   
kill my starter.  So I walked to a phone in the 30F degree weather,   
called the shop to have them tow me.  I also called my girlfriend to have   
her pick me up.

When the tow truck guy came, he asked me to put my tranny on Neutral.   
 Then I realized that I left it in drive all this time.  Yes people, I   
left it in drive and I thought I killed the starter!  It cost me $60 to   
tow it 2 miles.

And to top everything off, I had to talk to girlfriend.
