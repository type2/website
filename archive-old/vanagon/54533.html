Subject: coolant and a nightmare

Okay, I've written about the oil on my sparkplugs, lower gas milage, and
oil seepage at the crankcase joint...
Lately, there has been only lukewarm air coming out of the heater, even on
high.  Also, there is a faint coolant smell coming from the van when I
leave it after having driven for a while.  I have never seen any coolant
dripped on the ground, and the temperature needle is at the middle when
the engine is warm (I replaced the sensor about two years ago).
Otherwise the vehicle runs fine...

Also, I had this dream last night.  I lent my brother the  van for the
nnight, but when I got it back in the morning, and tried to ddrive it, it
barely moved. I got out to notice some parts of the engine had fallen out,
and more were too loose to work properly, then I noticed the suspension
was beat up, and my brother said it didn't respond on a turn, and he drove
off the road... then I woke up.  The Duckmobile was safely in the garage,
but why am I still worried?????........
