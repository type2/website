Subject: vintage licens (SP) plate frames

does anyone know if the frames that typically came on bus's back in the 
late 50's/early 60's were chrome plated around the edges?  was it a 
shinny chrome like the door handles or something else.  also, what shade 
of blue was used for the background color?

thanks and God Bless
matt
