&gt;&gt;My questions are...
&gt;&gt;1) Has anyone mounted running boards on a Westie before?

Back in about 89 I saw several new Vanagons which were &quot;conversion vans&quot; - An
outside company other than VW did the custom work and then VW sold them.  All
the ones that I saw were white vans with fancy red paint stripes and pin
stripping, plush - crushed red velour seats and ceiling trim, a lot of oak
fixtures, V - blinds, mag wheels and oh yes - aluminum running boards.  I
don't recall the name of the company that did the work but just wanted to
mention that the running boards did look good and yes its possible.
