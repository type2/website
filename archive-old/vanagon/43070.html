     Thanks for the reply, it's nice to hear from someone who actually has 
     one. This sounds like their more expensive closed loop system. Do you 
     have the cat. converter?
     
     My 1776cc is a type 1, I forget whether a 71 bus is Type 1 engine or 
     Type 4. If type 1, did you have to modify the heads for a temp sensor? 
     Any other engine mods or was it basically bolt on plus wiring and 
     running fuel lines?
     
     The new supply line is 1/2&quot;, is that ID or OD? Is the return line also 
     1/2&quot;?
     
     I'm not that familiar with busses, is that mileage less, about the 
     same, or more than stock?
     
     Were the 48mm the only ones offered when you got it or did you chose 
     them over the 40mm? Do the 48's seem about right for the engine or are 
     they overkill for that size?
     
     
     Thanks,
     Jeff

I have had on of CB Performances DFI systems installed on my engine (1835) for 
about a year now. It is based on GM's DFI system. The ECU comes from an Izusu 
(mounted under the rear seat on the drivers side) and most of the other parts 
(oxygen sensor, MAP sensor, etc.) are of GM origin. Installed it looks like 
dual Dellorto's. Cross throttle linkage, Dellorto manifolds with 2 Lucas 
injectors in each and 48mm throttle bodies topped off with Dellorto air 
cleaners. The O2 sensor is mounted in the exhaust header's collector. The 
larger gas line (1/2&quot;) comes with the kit. I removed the gas tank cover and 
pulled filler neck to tap and insert the return line. Both the return line and 
fuel line pass through the firewall with PVC fittings used as bushings.
     
It was, at the time, not an installation for an inexperienced or 
faint-of-heart mechanic. CB Performance was _very_ supportive at helping me 
getting it set up properly. This included an ECU exchange and many phone 
calls. Mine was the first bus installation they had done. The wiring harness 
is built to order.
     
It runs super strong. Mileage is about 17-18 around town 20-22 on the highway. 
And the best news is that, here in Nevada, smog checks are now a piece of 
cake. All in all I am very pleased with the set up.
