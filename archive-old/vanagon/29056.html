Probably the first thing you will want to do is remove the instrument
cluster/pod -complete. This will open a whole new vista, you will see many
new and exciting things &lt;g&gt;. 

Many times a simple squirt of a &quot;good&quot; liquid lube will do the trick. The
more satisfying and lasting method would be to disassemble the pedal shaft,
clean everything up and relube the whole sheebang with a good light weight
corrosion resistant wide temp range grease. We use a DOW Corning low temp
grease with very good results.

While you're there it is a good time to visually inspect the master
cylinders, the cluster connections and anything else that catchs your eye...
