Subject: Re: CB placement

&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.

   I have a Vanagon Westy and mounted the CB on the vertical carpeted
surface just in front of the shifter. The CB is mounted so it sits
vertically. It's out of the way and it is accessible to both the driver and
passenger. another good thing I like about this location is that the mount
is screwed into a capeted surface and if you want to take the CB out the
screw holes are hidden by the carpet.
