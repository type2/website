Subject: bodega pretour


For anyone interested, Bradley Prunehead and I intend to personally
check out the campground possibilities at Bodega Bay this coming
Wednesday, April 26, and plan to leave from my house here in
Moraga, assuming the trip up there will take around 2 hours or so.
If anyone else would like to join the search committee - they're
very welcome to do so.  We'll probably spend a few hours up there
checking out eh various grounds, have lunch or dinner, whatever,
then turn around the head back to the Bay Area.  

Anyone interested/free?
