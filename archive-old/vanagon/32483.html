I've got these in my 87.  They made a noticable, but not dramatic difference.
 I got them on sale at J.C. Whitney and they fit right into the regular
back-up light sockets - just as they're meant to.  I don't recall the price
that I paid, but I do remember dramatic price differences between the upscale
glossy catalog and the J.C. Whitney sale prices.  Check around before you
buy.
