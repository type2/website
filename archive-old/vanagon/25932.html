Subject: Re: Insurance Industry Regu


&gt;   2)  I have noticed a couple of folks have addressed this topic of 
Insurance
&gt;Industry Regulations and attributed statements to me as included below. 
 This
&gt;is not accurate.  My comments addressed the insurance company I deal with,
&gt;USAA, which is an alternative for current, retired, and former military
&gt;officers (USAA &quot;members&quot;).  They are the only population served by this
&gt;company, and it's financial objectives are to serve it's members, not to
&gt;maximize or for that matter even generate profit beyond what is necessary 
to
&gt;operate the company and serve it's members.  If losses/claims are below
&gt;projections, each member is rebated a prorated share of the excess.
&gt;

&gt;[Harvey's correction, the text attributed to me immediatly following was my
&gt;repeating what some other  individual said, and that I had included to 
provide
&gt;context for my own comments about USAA.]

&gt;&gt; In other words, insurance co's are profit-making institutions, as any 
legit

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any chance that government restrictions before the election, were so 
severe,
&gt;&gt; that even legit, clean companies could only lose money? I have no info


I am the one who said the above.

Sorry, Harvey-- I wasn't aware of a non-profit institution doing private
insurance. All the insurance companies I have dealt with, or heard of,
have been for-profit companies.

Now I know that there is at least one that isn't, with a restricted 
clientele.
I stand corrected.
