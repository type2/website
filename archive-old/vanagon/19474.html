Subject: 72 Bus project -- lotsa questions

Hi All,

Perhaps someone can give me some advice on my options.  I have
(among other vehicles) a '72 bus.  While I was living in Mexico,
I had it painted and had the interior redone.  It took forever
to get them to do things right, but the paint looks pretty nice
now.  Now I think it might be time for some engine and
transmission work.

The engine (a 1700 rebuilt in 1983) has something like 110K
miles on it; the heads have maybe 15K-20K hard miles on them,
and I think it's starting to burn oil.  (Can't tell for sure
because it also leaks oil, but a friend following me says she
saw oil smoke coming from the exhaust pipe)

The transmission has 220K+ miles on it and seems to be getting
louder than it used to be (whining under load, etc.).  I should
probably check the fluid level (it's been a year), but even so
it seems like 220K miles is a long life for a transmission.

So I am considering upgrading the pair by purchasing a new
tranny and engine from one of the engine builders who advertises
in VW T&amp;A.  Can anyone give me advice on which rebuilder to use
or avoid?  I am considering a 2000cc motor and matching
transmission.  Am I likely to have any problems fitting these
into my '72 chassis?  

Alternately, perhaps I will just buy a new tranny and rebuild
the motor myself; in that case is it worth it to go to larger
cylinders, longer rods, and the headwork to turn my 1700 into a
2000?

I have an old single weber carb right now that's showing its
age.  Any advice on new, improved, possibly even legal
carburetion (or, with the 2 liter, FI)?

This bus once had air conditioning, I think installed (and later
removed) by the mechanic that owned it before I did.  Now that I
live in California, I'm considering A/C again.  Will a 2 liter
engine be significantly better in case I decide to re-install
A/C?

Finally, does anyone have a 72 or similar vintage brick with a
working, non-oily smelling heater, or am I doomed to driving a
cold or smelly bus?  I have been totally unable to track down
the source of the oil smell in my heater.  Even before this
engine had oil leaks, the heater smelled oily.  The heat
exchangers seem pretty well sealed up (and new ones are
expensive!), so I don't see how engine air would get into the
heater system.  I figure this will all be easier to figure out
once I get the old drivetrain out, and no doubt a new engine
will be less oily smelling anyway, but I would like to have a
working, fresh air heater even after the new engine gets leaky
again, as all aircooled VW engines seem to eventually leak oil.

Enough questions for now...

Thanks!
Dennis
P.S.  If people reply to me privately, I promise to summmarize
to the list.
