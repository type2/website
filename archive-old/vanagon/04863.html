So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; Grovel you Son of a Bitch...I was right all a long....go ahead
&gt; Joel, say it again so EVERYONE can hear...

No way Unca Joel!  Don't Do It!  It was biased from the start!
Ric was groveling himself in front of the C &amp; D writers with
his Eurovan tryin' to explain it wasn't a mini-van, but a 
deluxe tall persons big van.  He also mentioned that he was
a lawyer and threatened to sue.  So the writers new they 
couldn't reprint the other story cause they'd look bad.  So 
instead they (pressured by Ric's slime-ball tactics ;) ) wrote
another article to semi-exonerate the EV.  Well of course the
article was factual if you only consider CURRENT models!  

So Don't be stroking Ric's ego Joel.  It's a set-up and we have
the goods!  

&gt; WAIT...that sound too much like the end of Revenge of the Nerds
&gt; (the movie)...we are definately NOT Nerds...

That's it that's where the EV fits.  A minivan loaded with a 
bunch of nerds!  Yeah, that's it!  On the front of VW Trends
with Ric in a bikini!   :O  ;)

&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, however, its nice to see the EV getting the recognition
&gt; it deserves.....I WAS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!   :-)

Oh please.......
