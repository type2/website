Say, you wayward buspeople...

Are any of those of us who are not going to do this _weird thing_
planning on hosting youall while you are making the rounds though
the great expanses?

I would like to extend an invite to any and all of you that make it
all the way to No. Calif to stop by for Suds+Steak catered by as many
of the locals as I can get together. I figure we can put it on at one
of our great parks..should be a hoot.

What do you think?

Now ... what was that about the plaid bikini and boots?

Regards,
