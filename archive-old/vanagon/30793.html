Subject: 1989 Westie - What's a good price?

Howdy all:

At the recommendation of a few people from alt.autos.makers.vw.aircooled, I 
just subscribed to this group, so I'm a newbie. Hello!

I've been looking to buy a Vanagon since last spring but the pickins' are 
slim (I live in the Boston area). I recently came upon a Westie that's an 89 
with 100k miles, sink, stove, fridge, and is supposedly in mint condition 
(owned by a VW mechanic). The asking price is $10,500. Is this a reasonable 
price? In general, will this engine last a while or is a rebuild just over 
the horizon?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Paul
