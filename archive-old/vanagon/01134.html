&gt; &gt; Toss together all ingredients except the Beaujolais.  Drink the
&gt; &gt; Beaujolais right down as if it were Thunderbird and spread the
&gt; &gt; salad over any holes that have rusted through the bottom of your VW,
&gt; &gt; where it will harden into a nice, servicable floor.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Seriously now, we should explore the benefits of MMOil if there are
&gt; any...
&gt; Actually, about the above mentioned usage of MMOil, USED engine oil,
&gt; preferably diesel, works mush better at coating potential rust areas.
                           ^^^^
&gt; Used diesel oil just won't go away...I don't know why.

Sounds like Cherlyl has already started in on the Beujolais &lt;grin&gt;
