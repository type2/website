Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of you VWrs.  May all your
vehicles be perfect and truble free for the New Year !  And to you Shawn
out there in BC, hope you get the westy of your dreams.  The one you've
been looking at sounds overpriced for the problems you've found so far ?
Be careful !

Peace &amp; Love

Frank
