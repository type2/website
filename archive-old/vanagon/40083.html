&gt; It does sound like we are getting there.
&gt;Lets look at a simple circuit: I've got an O2 sensor and temp sensor,
&gt;outside of telling me what readings are which I can do nothing
&gt;about on the fly, how do we make it do a fuel adjustment or maybe a
&gt;choke adjustment? What are our intentions here? You mentioned a wheel
&gt;rev sensor, why, as opposed to rpm? I could get next to one of those EDL
&gt;thingies tho!              west


I'm really looking at it from the perspective of a monitoring device, not
necessarily as a feedback loop to the engine. Well, it might be a feedback
device in the sense that it would warn the driver when something happened.
You know, a fancy beeping alarm that indicated oil pressure was going too
high or something.

Maybe I'm just too much of a gadget head, but I think it'd be cool to be
able to monitor fuel consumption relative to RPM, relative to ground speed,
engine temp, outside ambient temp, stock prices, etc. ;-)

Direct engine feedback would be a toughie. For me at least.

Wheel revs was just something I was thinking about for determining ground speed.
