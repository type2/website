Subject: Round Elec. Connector Tool Recomendation

I have wished from time to time that I could remove those round electrical
connectors from their housings when working on the electrical system of the
vehicle. I bought an extractor tool at Radio shack but it was the wrong
size. After studying the microfiche I determined that two little $2 parts
could be ordered that would do the job. 

I ordered these and they are invaluable. I recomend all VW owners order
these at their dealer. There is no need to buy the $50 extractor tool
itself, just the round tubes, especially the first, smaller one.

The part numbers are:

Little tube 000 097 007 A
Big tube  000 097 009
