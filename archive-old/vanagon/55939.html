&gt; On a lark I'm going to test drive a '87 Syncro. It's on a small-time used
&gt; car lot, price in paper is $5999. I have not seen it and I imagine it's
&gt; thrashed.
&gt; 
&gt; What to check for?
&gt; 
&gt; Vanagon items:
&gt;         head leaks
&gt;         coolant leaks
&gt;         what else?
&gt; 
&gt; Syncro items:
&gt;         viscous coupling (turn tight and listen for what?)
&gt;         cv joints - where and how?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't expect to buy this vehicle unless it's WAY underpriced. But I have
&gt; Syncro envy and want to learn about them. Any pointers will be helpful.

The prescribed method to test if the viscous coupling is working is to
jack up one side of the Van (both front and rear wheel off the ground)
then turn the front wheel by hand. The rear wheel should turn easily (in
the same direction).

When you make a slow hard turn on dry pavement you will find that the
inside front tire will grip (crunch). You do not want to hear any other
crunching or popping sounds that could come from the CV joints. Do the
test in both right and left tight turns.

Most Syncros in N.A. came with a rear differential lock. On the dash
behind the gear shift lever will be a schematic of the power train
showing the front and rear differentials (and center diff!) with a knob
below each that has a lock. The rear diff is on the RHS and this is the
only knob on my '86 Syncro.
If you pull this knob and drive ahead slowly, a light over the rear diff
schematic should show red. This indicates that the rear differential is
locked. If you try to take a tight turn you will find the front wheels
will tend to plow. If you push in the knob and drive ahead slowly, the
light show go out and you will have returned to normal drive.

The Syncro is a little slower than 2wd Vanagons due to higher gear
ratios. The gas consuption is about the same or slightly higher
(probable due mostly to added weight and drag from the extra power
train.

IMHO the syncro is a more robust vehicle with added strength and quality
in all suspension and drive train components. IT IS A PLEASURE AND A JOY
TO DRIVE.
