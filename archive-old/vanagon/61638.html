Hey, Blake
After reading your great fridge piece, I thought I'd see if you had any
ideas about a problem I'm having. I'm a new Westy owner ('87), and my
unit doesn't seem to work in _any_ mode. I haven't really focused much on   

the propane mode, so I can't swear that I've ever actually gotten it lit;   

however, the simple fact that it doesn't get cold on AC or DC suggests
some overall problem to me. Any suggestion on where to start looking? I'm   

a fairly competent mechanic/electrician, just haven't torn into it yet.
Thanks,
        -Malcolm Williamson
 There is a three prong plug in the back behind the refrigerator that can   
be reached by going through the side compartment on the right under the   
sink.  There isn't much space for hands and you may have to take off the   
face plate of the fridge which the door is mounted on,(4 screws and a   
tongue and groove on left side), to see what you are doing in the back.   
 Look over the top of the fridge where all the controls are.  Before you   
do any of this, Check to see if your fridge is plugged into the 120V   
outlet under the sink and also check the circuit breaker (left of fridge   
by the bench seat by the other 120V outlet) to see if you are getting the   
power to the outlets when plugged into the house.
 The easiest way to get your fridge cold is the 120V.  It's fast and   
hassle free.  Just flip the switch and turn the dial to high (clockwise).
 I hope that your fridge and cabinet system in you 87 is somewhat similar   
to my 83.  Let us all know what is happening with this project, I'm sure   
we'll all be glad to help on it.
