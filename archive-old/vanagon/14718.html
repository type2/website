Help!!

After treating my '71 Camper to a power wash and counrty cruise, I was
rewarded with the generator light coming on while driving home. This light
had been coming on before when I first started her up, but always went off
after a coupla seconds....After I made it home I shut her off and tried it
again--she started fine. Could I have gotten some wire wet?? What should I
check first? The generator, I know, but how can I tell what's causing the
problem?? It could be the gen., or the starter, or the volt. regulator,
or...??? What??!! Help me out here; I'm not profesh, but I've got the Book,
so give me some hints and then I'll hunker down to some J. Muir...
