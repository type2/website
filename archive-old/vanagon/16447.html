&gt; Anyone who has ever made your shifter feel new, PLEASE tell me how you
&gt; did it!! With as much detail as you like-- Email me direct if the list
&gt; gets long, if you like. I will post summaries to the list, for those who
&gt; are interested.
&gt; 
I, too would love to hear about this...
Richard
