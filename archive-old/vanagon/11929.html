&gt; when we're getting low on gas, but the replacement gas guage behaves as badly

&gt; Symptoms:  Fill the tank and the guage reads full.  Drive a bit and the guage 
&gt; dips to 1/2 full, back up to 3/4 and after driving a bit more down to 1/4 and 
&gt; sometimes towards empty.

I experience the same problem with my '80 Vanagon Camper: the guage reads 
full after refill, drops to half within 50-70 miles, jumps around a bit 
(especially when vertical or horizontal forces are applied) and 
disappears to the left after approx. 120 miles....

I think - with reference to some earlier discussion on this list - that 
is related to

(1) the weird shape of the gas tank;
(2) a malfunctioning (misadjusted) sender unit (located in the tank).

Possible solutions:

(1) Drop the tank and adjust/replace the sender;
(2) Ignore the problem and rely on known fuel consumption and 
    driven milage (I get between 15 - only downtown - and 24 - pure 
    highway - mpg with a camper conversion/pop top and 2.0l FI w/ 4gear MT)
(3) Install one of these fancy computers that measure miles driven, actual 
    fuel flow etc etc etc, and ignore everything else that you ever 
    looked at.
