Subject: '86 vanagon choke problem?


Anyone else have this problem?

	Start the car without a problem
	Battery light stays on
	Have to give the gas pedal a kick to turn it off
	When I do this, it comes off the choke (apparently) and
	   if any light inside are on, they get brighter
	Car stalls or is difficult to keep alive
	It does not get back on the choke if I rev it higher
	If it stalls it gets more and more difficult to start
	It it doesn't stall right away, it is very difficult
	   to get it moving as I have to keep revving the engine
	   to keep it alive. On an uphill it's quasi-impossible,
	   I'm afraid to ruin the clutch I fixed recently.

	Problem seems to go away once the motor is warm.

Thanks!
