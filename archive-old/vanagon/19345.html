 Martha sez:

&gt; I assume we're talking about a weekend, probably to include Friday
&gt; daytime, and possibly even Thursday and even Wednesday ahead of
&gt; it.  Let me know which weekends in October you all prefer,
&gt; and I'll post the results soon, so that we can all start planning
&gt; datewise accordingly...
&gt; 
  

  If the Baja trip was to leave, say, San Diego &lt;don't we know someone there?&gt;
  on Friday AM and return there Sunday evening, would that be enough time
  &quot;south of the border&quot;? That would be a 3 day weekend for the So. Cal folks,
  vanagon types from the Bay Area/Arizona/Nuevo Mexico/Alabama and points East
  would likely need Thurs. and Monday to/from San Diego. Does anyone know
  if there are any of those public school type holidays &lt;Columbus Day, etc.&gt;
  during October? What about getting a group rate on Insurance??
