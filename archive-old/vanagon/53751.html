Check the connection between the valve and the heat it self. Start
the engine, let it warm up, (under pressure) then put side to side,
on the hose leading to the valve and look for leaks!

&gt; HELP!  I pulled the never-used seat belts up from underneath the rear

&gt; coolant.  I imagine there must be some kind of leak from the rear heat 
&gt; exchanger.  I seem to remember a thread along these lines a while ago, 
&gt; but I'm afraid I might not be able to find it in the archives.  Can 
&gt; someone shed some light on what needs to be done?
