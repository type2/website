Subject: Blown a/c fuse and oil everywhere, but where's the leak?

Hi Volks!

Ah yes, another a/c question.

As the subject says, the 50A(!) a/c relay fuse on my 90 GL blew last
week and there was lubricant behind the plastic panel covering the
a/c hoses.  Before launching into removing the evaporator assembly (and
we all know what a bitch that is) to search for a leak, my mechanic
decided to replace the fuse and recharge the system first.  He says it's
working fine and holding the charge.  Assuming the two events (blown fuse
and oil everywhere) are related, where could the oil be coming from?  Or
could the oil be evidence of a small long-term leak that I discovered only
because I dismantled the panel to look at the blown fuse?

Puzzled in Houston,
Joachim and his cold-then-warm-and-now-perhaps-cold-again 90 GL
