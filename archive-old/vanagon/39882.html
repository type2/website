&gt;Have you checked the center steering link?  That's the most common cause of
&gt;steering play in your model of vehicle.

You can check this by having someone turn the steering wheel while you
watch under the vehicle.  If the swing lever pin is not firm in its bushings,
the swing lever will have an up-and-down component to its motion instead
of only side-to-side.

I've checked this by myself by putting the front of the bus on stands
and using my foot to shove the wheels back and forth in a &quot;steering&quot; motion.
Yup, my '62 needs a swing axle kit :-(

Muir has a good description and some pictures of this.

How much play is there in your steering and have you tried to adjust it?
