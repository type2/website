Subject: Syncro front tire woes
Date: Tue, 5 Apr 94 16:53:23 PDT

I recently bought an '87 Vanagon Syncro, and the front tires are
worn on the outside edge.  Is this because of too much toe, or do
the tires tend to wear that way?  The tires have about 10K on them,
and had a front-end alignment done when the tires were put on.

Any ideas?
