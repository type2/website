And Gilligan thus wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; a floor jack and up in the engine bay in no time.  Mating the
&gt; engine to the tranny was a little bit tricky.  But with a second
&gt; pair of eyes (Benji's) The job got done in short order.  

So I guess Gilligan thinx getting the motor off the ground and into
the bus in about 5-10 minutes is slow...
 
&gt; The next step was getting the accelerator cable up and through
&gt; the dog-house fan housing.  Thom futzed with it a bit and was
&gt; unable to get it though the opening.  I tried reaching around,

The dam thing was wrapped around the clutch cable for &quot;safekeeping&quot;

&gt; Thom messed with the fuel line and after some confusion about
&gt; which tube it connected, it was hooked up and done.

The fuel situation on this bus was seriously hacked.  It has an 'merkin
car tank in it, so the default fuel lines were not used.
 
&gt; WD-40 the wing-nut went on much better.  But....  the cable

WD-40 is Benji's answer to everything.  Having trouble in a relationship?
WD-40!  Kids not doing well at school?  WD-40!

&gt; start.  There was some confusion and discussion with Benji
&gt; about what wires go where which got straightened out.

The basic wiring in the negine compartment had also been hacked.

&gt; Well after Thom and Benji fiddled around and decided that a
&gt; plastic coupling was the culprit, they put the linkage back
&gt; together in the best way they could and chaulked it up to
&gt; another fun job I'd have in store for me.  
 
The bushing under the shifter is gone.  I adjusted it sideways a bit, put
some grease in it, and we were on our way.

&gt; Monkeyed around with the front signal lenses.  Benji through in
&gt; a pair of Euro rear lenses, but they didn't fit right.  Thom
&gt; 'McGuyvered' them on and now it looked suitable for the road. 

These lenses look nice, but are really crap.
 
&gt; Oh, one more thing.  Gas.  Well, as it turned out, the 5 gal
&gt; gas can I'd left aside was used by some other guy that had 
                                                ^^^
You mis-spelled &quot;redneck yahoo&quot;

&gt; check.  I declined to buy the extra set of gates as they were
&gt; not in good enough shape to warrant $300.  So Thom and I left

Benji was kinda torqued that Steve didn't buy the gates.  I explained to
him that the area where the hinges bolted on were rusted thru.  Oh, !
didn't see that!
 
&gt; We headed out and I was not exactly pleased with the acceleration

That first hill was interesting!

&gt; noise.  So I had to use the red marks on the speedo.  I figured
&gt; the slow acceloration was due to crummy gas and that the timing
&gt; and dwell weren't exactly right.  That's okay, I could get it 

The throttle cable had too much slack.  I tightened it at the gas station.
