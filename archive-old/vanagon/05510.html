Amazing.  Now I understand why twice, upon seeing my '91 Synchro
camper, folks have offered me &gt;$20,000 on the spot.

BTW, the Synchro is an amazing option. With studded snows it is an 
awesome winter-mobile.  Could use ABS, though, as my wife found out in a 
little spin out last winter.  I also have a '86 VW Quantum Synchro (which 
uses the Audi Quattro 4WD system) and because to the higher clearance, 
the Camper is my preferred winter vehicle.  And both of these vehicles 
are vastly better in snow and other nasty stuff than our Slaab turbo 
convertible (Front-WD only).

In '91 (and presumably '90), the Synchro was was only available fully 
loaded with power locking/windows, etc.  That may also account for a 
small amount of the premium price.
