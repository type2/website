&gt;&gt; and very snazzy... Oh, and it had this little badge on the
&gt;&gt; back which read:
&gt;&gt; syncro
&gt;It is a Golf Synchro indeed. There are few of them around.
&gt;I personnaly think it is a misconception. It does not really
&gt;look like a 4wd. It is, just as you wrote, a weird Golf

I like to add, it's not only a Golf Syncro, which looks like
a usual Golf with no extra external applications, just a 4WD.
And the Golf Syncro is still available.

The Golf Syncro with enlarged ground clearance is called
Golf Country in Germany. Only a few were built and not any
more available. Significant is the raised chassis like that
done with the Vanagon Syncros.

By the way, the Eurovan Syncro follows the concept of Golf
Syncro, no enlarged ground clearance, no special exterior
applications, just a 4WD.
