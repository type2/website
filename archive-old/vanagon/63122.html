Subject:      Book Review: Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management

I picked up an interesting book this weekend on Bosch fuel injection. Here's
a brief synopsis for anyone that might be interested in learning something
about fuel injection systems.

4. Pulsed Injection--Troubleshooting &amp; Service
5. Continuous Injection--Theory
6. Continuous Injection--Troubleshooting &amp; Service
7. Tuning for Performance and Economy
8. Appendix
9. Glossary
10. Index

The book provides a very well written description of the history and theory
of fuel injection systems as pioneered by Bosch. I was quite suprised to
learn that fuel injection has been around for as long as it has--the first
passenger car fuel injection appeared in 1927!

The book has separate chapters for both theory and servicing for continuous
injection (CIS) and pulsed injection (EFI or AFC) systems. It does contain
some specific sections for the Digijet and Digifant systems found on
Vanagons. I found the book to be very informative on the theoretical aspects
of fuel injection. The book also contains chapters on servicing and
troubleshooting pulsed injection systems, although I don't think these
chapters were quite as good as the theoretical chapters. There are no
specific troubleshooting sections for Digijet or Digifant systems. The
chapter on tuning for performance and economy was informative, but
disappointing. Apparently, the bottom line is that there's not really much
that you can do to squeeze more performance out of the fuel injection
systems found on Vanagons. That's a pity indeed!

All in all, I think this is a very good book for anyone wanting to
understand the mysteries of fuel injection systems.
