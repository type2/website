&gt;Any chance of fitting a Syncro rear tank into this application? That would 
&gt;give another 18 gallons or so. It should work in any 2WD gas vanagon, but 
&gt;dropping the engine+tranny to check smells like a lot of work.   tim s.

You can definitely stick a syncro tank in a 2WD van, and yes, you would 
get another 18 gallons!

Thus, you would have a van with 34 gallongs gas total capacity. Wow. 

And Tim, theoretically, you only have to drop the tranny, not the motor, 
to stick that second tank back there. So the hot thing is for every one 
of you guys out there to get a syncro fuel tank and put it in the garage. Then,
next time you change the clutch stick the tank in there before putting the
tranny back.. 

I have a used tank from my 87 syncro but I sold it to someone in the deep south
somewhere. But it is going on three years now that I have not heard from him so 
I think he is losing his right to the tank, for which he paid good money.
