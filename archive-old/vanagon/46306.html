Rodney -
Banging on the brakes drums with a hammer should work.  Similar 
problem with my '67 sqbk in the rain.  Rust formed between the 
bracket from the handbrake and the brake plate.  Cleaned the 
components and applied very light grease to contact areas.  Amatuer 
solution though.

&gt; Well, the last time I parked my bus (planning to drive it to
&gt; work the next day), I never figured it would sit a month without
&gt; being driven, and I set the hand brake.  I went to drive it
&gt; last night, and it won't move!  Engine runs, transmission and
&gt; clutch seem OK, but letting out the clutch only turns the wheels
&gt; a few degrees.  Then it feels like they hit a stop, and the
&gt; engine stalls.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure the rear brake shoes are rusted to the drums.  Is there
&gt; anything else that could possibly be wrong?  It's only been a month--
&gt; could brake drums rust solid that quickly?
&gt; 
&gt; What should I do to try to correct this problem?  One person here at
&gt; work suggested smacking the wheels with a sledge hammer a few times.
&gt; If that fails (or I like my wheels undented), pull the wheels, and hit
&gt; the brake drums directly.  What do I do if THAT doesn't work?
&gt; 
&gt; After I get the brakes free again, do they need any maintainence
&gt; because this happened?
