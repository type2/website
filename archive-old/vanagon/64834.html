 &gt; That big space under the driver's seat is calling to me to fit another

 &gt; I want to put in a second battery, but I am not sure how to go about it.
 &gt; I want the battery to drive the fridge and lights and I want the engine to
 &gt; charge it (Naturally).
 &gt; But, I don't want it to crank the starter - I don't want to put in the
 &gt; heavy duty cables.

&gt;over to the main battery and ground the other anywhere handy.  It is
&gt; worth it, 'cause I guarentee you will have occasion to want to crank
&gt; with that 2nd battery.  For most of a year I had a misterious starting
 &gt;problem that required the help of bat #2.  I put a marine switch on the
 &gt;back of the main battery case, but you don't have to go that far: Just a
 &gt;cut out switch will do.  Plus all the other times bat #1 goes dead.

 I too have been comtemplating the second battery deal for my 84 Westfilthia,
after I get all the broken stuff working.  I notice that JC Whitney has a
number of RV second battery installation kits in their catalog.  Has anyone
on the list any experience with these?  Any good?  Which kit works best with
the Bosch alternator?

Thanks
