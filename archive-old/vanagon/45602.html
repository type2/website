Subject: Re: 9-pass vanagons

No Ric you are mostly wrong.  I own a T1, T2, and T3 9 passanger
busses/van.  ALL of them have the metal partition behind the driver's and
passanger's seats. ALL of them.   ALL of them including the Vanagon and the
one I have is NOT a double cab.  A double cab  wouldn't be a 9 passanger
would it?  SO THERE ;-p.  I don't know about the T4s as I've never seen a 9
pass.

I hope this settles the debate.

&gt;That was certainly true of the T1 Type 2s and quite possible with the T2
&gt;Type 2s but I believe only the double cab T3 Type 3 had the full partition
&gt;across the front. In the T4 9 passenger there is no partition behind the
&gt;front seat.
