&gt;What really bugs me about these silly door vents... is why VW went to
&gt;the expense of putting them in?  What purpose do they serve?  In
&gt;summer
&gt;with the AC I keep them closed.  In the winter the heat blow just fine
&gt;into the cavernous Vanagon.  It's not like it is air tight with
&gt;nowhere
&gt;to go...

It's probably because NOT ALL Buses 68-79 and Vanagons thru 1987 have Air
Conditioning (&amp; 88-91's using those Rear Side Window Vents too) because
it was an OPTION - not standard equipment (even though most of them on
the lot here in California had it installed due to marketing surveys I
suspect).  And when these vehicles were new, they *were* pretty darn
air-tight.  Ever try to close any of the doors with seals, felts, etc.,
having been newly installed?

Heck, even the Beetle didn't get true flow-thru ventilation until 1971
when they finally added the exhaust vents behind the quarter windows even
though they had inlets starting in 1968 with no place for the air to go
(Loved those pop-out windows on 68-70 models just for that reason).  And
you still had to &quot;crack&quot; a window when you closed the door from the
inside or your ears would pop.

I bought a 73 Ghia Coupe new in July 73 - first two weeks I had the SOB
my left arm was sore from having to pull the door closed on that when I
forgot to &quot;crack&quot; the window open.  I sure miss that car though - put
85,000 miles on it the first year traveling all over while in the
military.  Then the ex-wife got it when we separated and divorced in 76.
Haven't seen nor heard from her or the car ever since.
