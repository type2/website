Subject: Re: Bus towing bus connection

Just a quick question.  I'm thinking about towing my Westy with my Bluebird
bus, but 
don't want to risk a weak connection, nor leave cosmetic defects on the
Westy's front.  
This should store away in a Bird storage locker by some non-fixed connections
in the tow 
bar allowing some collapse or easy disassembly.  What have others done?
  This should give the best combination of class towing class.

i have successfully towede a split with a split.    sometimes people gave me
funny looks, but it got the job done.   longest distance- whidbey island to
olympia, about 150? miiles.    it's easier if both buses have good steering.
  this is a fixed hitch tow, with a heavy duty tow bar bolted to the frame of
the tow bus.   max speed i liked - 45mph, better done in the wee hours when
there is less traffic.
