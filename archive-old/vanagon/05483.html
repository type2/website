I'd take them to an automotive machine shop.  If they're anything like 2.0
heads, they're pretty pricey if you mess them up too bad yourself.  When this
happened to me, I bought some replacement studs (same size, I believe) from
VW and took them, the heads, and the manifold that bolts onto them to a machine
shop.  (Not a repair shop.  These guys are the ones repair shops send heads,
blocks, cranks, etc. TO.)  They didn't seem too phased by it.  I think they
ground off the broken one and re-drilled and tapped the hole.  The other
hole was stripped and they filled it in with aluminum (heliarc, I guess) and
re-drilled it.  By letting them use the manifold, they could make sure the
holes were drilled straight and the exhaust would bolt on.  It only cost about
$20 (if that) and it was worth it to me to let people who do this for a living
handle it.
