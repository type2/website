&gt; I would be happy to put Gerry in touch with the listowner to get the

Thanks for your help, but this is an option that is available via the
&quot;real&quot; listserv and not the Unix ListProcessor.  The &quot;real&quot; one runs on
IBM mainframes.  The listserv that I run will eventually mimc it, but it's
going to cost the department $250 to run my vanagon list, and I don't
think they'll go for that. 

In the future, any discussions of this sort should be sent to me and not 
to the list.  The list is noisy enough.  Try to keep on the topic of VW 
Vans and Buses etc.  Ok, I guess you can sing a few songs now and then 
as long as they are about VW Vans's &amp; Buses.  :-)
