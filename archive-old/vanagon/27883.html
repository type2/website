Subject: Re: Has anyone done front brakes on Eurovan?


    I have!

    Piece of cake!  I paid abou $60 for my pads, make sure they are 
semi-metallic.  
    I think the only tool I needed was a small screwdriver, the job is 
self explanatory.  I dont recall if they are vented but I do know YOU 
MUST HAVE THE ROTORS TURNED.

&gt;
&gt;Mine are almost gone, VW wants $120.00 for the pads alone.  NAPA has 
them 
&gt;for $40.00.
&gt;
&gt;Also the dealer asked me if they were vented, have you seen any 
Eurovans 
&gt;with vented rotors?
&gt;
&gt;Do these prices aound about right?
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody have any pointers on doing it?
&gt;
&gt;Is it any worse than a Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;I haven't got my Bently yet (two months and counting).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help,
