I have a question regarding the propane tanks for the Westy's, does anyone
have a good figure for what they should sell for used? I'm looking for one,
as the tank I have is too big and doesn't provide enough ground clearance.
An RV place local has one used, but he said they're pretty &quot;Pricey&quot;.
Alternatively if anyone has one for sale I'd be interested.   Thanks Tom

&quot;I'm fine thanks, who are you?&quot;
&quot;I'm fine too, but you no get in without the password&quot;
