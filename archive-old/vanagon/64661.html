Subject:      Difflock in 97 Syncro

I looked at a 97 EV syncro and noticed that the nice illuminated &quot;syncro
panel&quot; with the knobs for the locks is gone. =

Newer syncros doesnt have any difflocks at all. Sad.

BTW, I had to resubscribe to the list, so I'm not up to date with the
subjects being discussed right now. =
