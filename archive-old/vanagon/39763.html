To All:

Although I've had my doubts about the Inuvik run, having bet Tobin there
would be no more than four vehicles crazy enough to do it  :-) it now appears
that there will be more than a few of us.  Of course, Real Men drive the
whole route...  :-)

I'm still trying to find a ham radio operator familair with digital
communications via short-wave and with the internet.  So far, the only
qualified volunteer is in New Zealand, a bit far away if someone's family
needs to get a message to us en route.  Failure to find someone capable of
manning a base-station while we're out communing with the bears means I won't
be able to file a daily road log, a delight some masochists on the list
especially asked of me :-)

I imagine everyone will take lots of pictures, and some of them may
eventually find there way onto the 'net.  Toward that end I've arranged to
have my film processed by the Seattle Film Works ( http://www.filmworks_dot_com )
who will also scan the images for an extra four bucks per roll (six for 36
exposure rolls).  Once scanned, the photos will be available, via passworded
accounts, directly from the Film Works computer or they will mail them,
compressed format, on a 3.5&quot; diskette.

By mailing exposed film as the tour progresses,  the images will be available
to Vanagon subscribers within days.  Indeed, we will still be fumbling about
the Arctic when the first scenes are being viewed back home.

I mention this because some of you might want to take advantage of the Film
Works lab and scanning.  I think you'll find their prices are competitive.
 I'm very satisfied with the quality of their lab work.  I'm waiting to see
how the scanning turns out.  The first roll will include some shots of the
Polys engine and various tools and equipment mentioned in earlier articles.

The availability of scanned photos of the trip is unique in that the list
subscribers will probably see us coming down the Dempster Highway before we
see those pix ourselves, assuming the mail from Dawson is as good as it is
elsewhere in Canada.
