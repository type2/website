Subject: Re: Any musicians out there?

I was a music major in college but I was a classical guitarist.  before 
college trhough I q was a reeds man - flute, clarinet and some sax.  
Could probably still play the flute (if it hadn't been vandalized in 
college) but can't remember squat about clarinet. (sax is just a funny 
flute with a reed in fingering but haven't done much reeds in  almost 
twenty years.  I used to carry an assortment of recorders, harmonicas, 
guitars, etc on camping trips.

Oh and I can carry all of these in my Volkswagen Eurovan  (vw content)
