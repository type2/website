Subject: Westfalia woodslat roof rack replacement parts

Does anybody know of someone who is reproducing replacement parts for early
Type II Westfalia Woodslat Roof Racks? They typically were seen on pre '68
camper buses.

I've heard of someone in San Jose and in San Diego Calif. but have not
located these people yet.

The parts that I need are the uprights that hold the alumnin tubing and
latches that secure the rack to the bus.

I live in California and am eager to restore my roof rack.

Regards,
Brendan
