Subject: Eurovan For Sale

There is a Eurovan GL for sale near me in Phoenixville, PA. It has about 55K 
on it, it's blue and in excellent condition. It's sitting at a Chevy 
dealership and they are asking about $14K.  If anyone is interested, Email me 
and I'll find out more.

(It's gorgeous! Wish I had and extra $14K.)

Bryan
