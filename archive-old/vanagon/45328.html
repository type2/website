Subject: Re: Buying in Germany?


&gt;Does anyone know what it's like to get one from Germany/Austria in terms of :
&gt;
&gt;-cost
&gt;- problems with incompatability of parts, etc. once in USA
&gt;- more availability of 4X4 models in Germany/Austria?
&gt;- other?
&gt;

Rich:

        The main problem that I discovered when I lived in France in 1993,
was that no Volkswagens in Europe met North American standards with
respect to safety, exhaust emissions and so forth. As I understand it,
none of them are permitted to be imported unless you buy a new one 
and have it certified by Volkswagen to meeting the standards of the U S 
or Canada.  

        Just bring home with you a few VR6 and TDI motors that you've
scrounged from auto wreckers in Europe.  Sell 'em all over here, and
then buy the VW of your dreams here at home. 

Good luck !
