Subject: WTB 86+ Westie Full Camper &lt;$9k

Hi, all

Have just joined this list, hoping it will 1] lead me to a mid- late-'80s
Westie *full* camper with plenty of miles ~left~ in it; and 2] be a resource
where i can learn more about them, for making a good choice, and for giving
it the good care and gentle handling that will keep it running.  Already
this am, after finding the Vanagon FAQ site leading to the archives of this
list, i've had quite an introduction to the &quot;leaking heads&quot; problem.  :-\

I'm 57, suddenly retired d/t medical problems, thus with limited resources.
Located in Sacramento, CA [and noticed in the archives a posting of
classified ads from the Sacto Bee].  I've had 2 prev. Type II vans, a 1976
that i enjoyed for 4 years, and a 1973 sunroof that i bought used, and held
onto for 2 years until a piston melted, probably my fault for driving 60mph
on a 115-degree day. 8-(  I'm older and more patient now.

I'd like to find something for no more than $9,000 if possible, including
tax &amp; license.   Most important is that it be in solid mechanical condition.
If it has a recently rebuilt or replaced engine or heads [not totally sure
what i should be requesting here], then i could try to dig a little deeper.
Cosmetics are not so important, as long as the problems would either not
interfere with use, or would yield to TLC.  I do not want one that was
submerged in the recent NoCA floods [no joke---that's what happened to my
'76], or has not received regular maintenance.  Can't afford expensive
surprises.

The Westie will be my sole transportation.  As well as daily, I want to use
it both as a camper for short camping trips, and as a kind of &quot;sag wagon&quot;
[as in marathons or long bike races] to be able to rest &amp; renew in as needed
during the day.

Desired/needed Specs:

        AT, PS, AC; popup top, and everything else that is included in a
&quot;full camper&quot; 

Am willing to follow up on any suggestions within 200 miles or so of Sacramento.

I look forward to participating in this list, which is obviously quite
active---i sent the &quot;subscribe&quot; post only an hour or so ago, and have
already received 6 posts!

Thaanks,
