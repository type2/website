Subject: THANKS for HELP! on 90 Overheating on Road Trip

Thanks everybody who responded to my plea for help on my overheating.  I
bled the rad. and cleaned all the electrical contacts.  I was able to drive
it around town, up big hills and all and had no probelms with it...the rad.
fan came on and everything kept in the safe zone.  It wasn't low on coolant
or anything, so I left that alone. 

Thanks again, everyone.  I'm off for Conn., Rhode Island and eventually Cape
Cod today.  I hope Eduardo leaves soon...

Ian Webb
