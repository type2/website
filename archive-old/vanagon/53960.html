&gt; I've been quoted $60 US per cubic metre to transport an '84 Westy by
&gt;  freighter. This week,  I'm separated from both my Westy and my Bentley
&gt;  manual. Can anyone figure the dimension of a Westy from the bottom of the
&gt;  tires to the top of the camper top?

Assuming an 84 is the same size as an 86 (which I have figures on), here
goes:

Length: 179.9&quot; x 25.4 mm/inch x 1/1000 m/mm = 4.57m
Height: 80.9&quot; x 25.4 mm/inch x 1/1000 m/mm = 2.05m
Width: 72.6&quot; x 25.4 mm/inch x 1/1000 m/mm = 1.84m

Volume: 4.57m x 2.05m x 1.84m = 17.24 cubic meters

I guess that means $1,034.

Good luck,
