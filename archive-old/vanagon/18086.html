&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle. 
&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt;The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
&gt;&gt;at idle.  When driving all seems fine. &gt;&gt;

Your problem could be just improper idle adjustment. If the idle adjustment
is set to too high this surging symptom could happen. 

To adjust idel, disconnect and bypass the idle stablizer and adjust the 
idle screw (at the throttle body) to set idle at 900 RPM. Reconnect the
idle stablizer. 

This should most likely solve your problem.
