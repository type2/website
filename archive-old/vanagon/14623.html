HELLO, ALL

 It's friday and it's the end of another week...
 another week that is that i've put off the replacement
 of a slowly seeping water pump on my 86'

 so, since i have nothing better to write about i figured
 that i would try to tap the collective wisdom all you
 vanagon gods...
 
 I'm confident that i will have no trouble changing the wasserpump
 but, i figured that since i have yet to ever do one on a wasserboxer
 i would ask if anyone had any tricks of advise, so maybe i don't
 have to learn them myself the hardway...

 It's the newer style pump,  so it's a bit easier, than the earlier
 style...but i was wondering about that o-ring thing or anyother
 possible tricky parts...

 later
 Patrick

 BTW to those of you who i told i would fax flyers about the
  April 29 volksfest, i will be sending those out on monday...
 my fax has been broken...

  86' Doppelkabine
