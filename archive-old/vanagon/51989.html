&gt; &gt;I need the CO meter to properly set idle and timing on my Vanagon.
&gt; &gt;I've called all the usual rental places around Lafayette, CA but
&gt; &gt;no one I've talked rents them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is anyone aware if somebody local rents these things, or am I doomed
&gt; &gt;to visit my friendly, knowledgabe, local VW mechanic? &lt;wry grin&gt;


Here's a idea for some CALIFORNIA VW clubs or the business inclined.

&quot;The Get A Sniff Smog Shop&quot;

Set up a garage with a few bays, with gas analyzers. The do-it-yourselfer
then either pays a fee to get a &quot;quick&quot; sniff (to asses where his/her car
is with respect to exhuast emission, or rents the bay (by the hour, day)
to &quot;get a sniff&quot; and make real-time adjustments to his/her vehicle. If you
really want to get elaborate, you can also have a certified SMOG
technician on hand to do the &quot;real&quot; inspection when the do-it-yourselfer
has finished fine-tuning his vehicle.

As for &quot;operating&quot; the gas analyzers, if you are competent enough to make
your own car repairs then surely you can operate a gas analyzer ...
&quot;idiot&quot; keys and all.

Any takers ?

Chris
