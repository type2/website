&gt;         Now---- is there a way without removing the top on my 86 Westy to
&gt; replace the screen part? If not I will attempt to replace the whole banana.
&gt; Any ideas? Thanks for that.

The screen on my '88 was replaced by the PO with a black vinyl mesh. 
It appears to have been done with a machine, rather than sewed by 
hand. I have heard there there is handheld sewing machine for this 
type of job - maybe check an upholstery shop. The canvas appears to 
have never been removed, as the staples look original.
