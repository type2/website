Joel: we can probably dispense with the &quot;CAN&quot; designation for the Canadian
provinces. I pity the bus whose owner doesn't know the short-form terms
for the provinces and territories.... But just in case some do not know, they
are: ALB
-Alberta; (say it with me) BC- British Columbia; NB -New Brunswick; NS-
Nova Scotia; ONT - Ontario - SAS - Saskatchewan; PQ - Quebec; NEWF -
Newfoundland; NWT - North West Territories; YUK - Yukon; PEI - Prince
Edward Island (Phonetic pronunciations available upon request). DC

&gt; it would appear that the bay area up north (the one sitting atop the next
&gt; Big One! :)  is the clear leader.
&gt; the only CA i don't know what to do with is Eric Townsend ... i don't
&gt; know if he's north or south. :)
&gt; 
&gt; for the grumbling Washingtonians, you'll notice that your request has
&gt; been granted. big deal, you're all on the west side.  but i don't
&gt; know where three of you are.
&gt; Eric Oster, and Ben McGough ... i don't know where they are. and
&gt; Rick Gordon is on some island that i can't find on the map ... i can
&gt; assume it's over by the ocean, but i'm not sure. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; i guess texas and pennsylvania are next, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; sigh. the things i do just to keep other people happy. :(
