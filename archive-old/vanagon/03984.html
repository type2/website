Subject: Vanagon Alloy Wheels

Hi Gang,

Do you know anyone or where I can buy 5 Vanagon Alloy wheels and
what they cost. I think the factory alloys look real sharp and
I would like to buy some for my van. I'm an unknown who drives
an 87 Vanagon GL Wolfsburg Ed. I grew up in a VW loyal family,
my dad had a 65 Bug, 71 Squareback, 71 411, and a 76 Rabbit.
I have owned a 68 Bug, 78 Transporter, and a 92 Jetta GL. I love
the way the flat fours rumble or chug, the motors are really cool.
Porsche will put a flat 4 and flat 6 into thier new boxer. I guess
I'm really hooked on VW Vans. 

My first one was a 78 rust bucket that I used to drive to the beach
to o surfing. I rebuilt the engine with a MOFOCO rebuild kit and it
was a great cruiser. It broke down at inconvient times, but it was 
always easy to fix. I bought a Jetta against my better judgement 
(I should have bought a vanagon) :-). I don't know what it is
about vw vans. I guess its a combination of nostalgia and utility,
all that I know is that I'm happy being in another VW van.

Sincerely,
Alan Loo
