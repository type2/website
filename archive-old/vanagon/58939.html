&lt;&lt; One item caught my eye.  Cargo liner.  It's a heavy plastic tray that fits
 over the back floor of your SUV or Taurus wagon.  I called Sears, and,
 naturally, they don't make them for Vanagon.
 
  Does anybody?

Hey, what are the cargo floor dimensions of the Vanagon? Wolfsburg West is
repro-ing the black rubber cargo floor mats for the '50-'79 buses without
holes for the middle seat (leave solid or cut your own) This might be a
possibility seeing if WCM or someone would be interested in repro-ing the
rubber cargo floor mats used in the standard non-GL Vanagons and Vanagon
Kombis.  I have the front cab floor rubber mat out of a '80 Vanagon Kombi.
Easy to clean, and lasts a whole lot longer than carpet.
Jim, would Bus Boys be interested in repro-ing these??
