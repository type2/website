I have no idea, however, how the Dead became associated with the VW, as Jerry

Garcia drove a Beamer.

but in his younger, wilder days the band hauled the equipment around in a 58
panel.   I heard they had many problems with it's mechanicals, and actually
once had to push it partway across the Golden Gate bridge.

And walking around a Dead parking lot I would have no idea how anyone would
associate their fans with VWs

Actually some guys in my vw club went to the Seattle Center when they came to
town last summer, and videotaped buses.  They showed the tape at a meeting,
and i kept saying, hey that's kevin's bus!  or, o my god, i used to go out
with that guy! (blush)  and i saw a double cab split that had moved to
california and was now two blocks from my dad's house.

nope, no vws at Dead shows.   especially never welded  to the roof of a
school bus.
