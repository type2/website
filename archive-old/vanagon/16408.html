Subject: 185 XZX's good for a camper?

&gt;&gt;4 VW Vanagon tires for sale, Michelin X, 185 R14, PR6, XZX.  Two of them
&gt;&gt;have about 200 miles on them, two have about 1,500 miles on them.  They
&gt;&gt;came off of a 1987 Vanagon.  Asking $220.  ($290 + balancing &amp; valves new.)

I know people think highly of these tires, but I have a couple of questions:
- do they have sufficient strength for a camper?
- I have 205r14 tires on my camper now - does one need new rims to switch
  to a different size like this? (They don't have rims - the van was totaled
  and the owner only got the tires off it.)
