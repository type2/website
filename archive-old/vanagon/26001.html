  Steve,
          I have two vehicles fully insured in Christchurch, New Zealand and 
  a '67 bus with minimum coverage in Arizona.  I pay less annually for the 
  two in NZ than the crappy coverage in AZ for 6 months.  Gary Gibson
  ------------------------------
Not to apologize for the U.S. insurance industry or their regulators but
the difference between the rates for your Kiwi coverage and the US is
driven, in no small part, by the fact that New Zealand has a wonderful
national heath care system.  That plan covers much of the medical expenses
incurred in traffic accidents so auto insurance premiums can be much less.
Also, and I'm not completely sure of this so I stand to be corrected, the
accident compensation system is very different in New Zealand (isn't it a
very strict no-fault system?).  Add a different cost of living and you
simply can't compare the AZ and NZ premiums.

However, both places contain some of the most beautiful locations on the
planet and NZ has the friendliest people I've ever run across.  In fact, I
could use an ice cold Dominion Bitter Double Brown right now.

Nick
