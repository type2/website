Subject: The Glowing Letter


                          The Glowing Letter        

I recently received an e-mail containing such glowing words of
praise I could not answer it immediately.  The writer was a
woman, obviously perceptive, no doubt beautiful, young, wealthy
and well educated.  She had discovered the file of my articles
maintained by Richard Kurtz and wrote to praise my wit, wisdom
and tenacity in extravagant, but wholly justified, terms.  In her
eyes I was a cross between Albert Schwitzer, Aristocles and Wrong
Way Corrigan, with a dash of Hercules thrown in.  The
outrageously complimentary letter had me strutting about the
shop, shaking back my mane of golden curls with various body
parts puffed up, jutted out and generally getting in the way of
things.

I'm planning to make the run to Inuvik with the other crazies but
recently discovered the astronomical price of gasoline as you
climb toward the top of the planet.  I'm financing the trip from
my mad-money budget and the thought of paying nearly four bucks a
gallon for fuel had me sweating bullets as I tried to figure some
way around it.  The Glowing Letter helped.  I applied my wit,
wisdom and tenacity to the problem and came up with a design for
a pair of saddle tanks I could strap under my 1965 bus that would
allow me to travel a thousand miles without refuelling, the idea
being to do so with a load of low-cost fuel.

I didn't need 155 pounds of steel for the tanks, which should
only weigh about forty pounds each, but when you buy scrap steel
you've got to take what you can get.  Forty-one bucks at two-bits
a pound.  Sixteen gauge hot-rolled steel sheet is tricky stuff to
handle on a windy day and getting it into the roof rack was a
real chore.  Then I thought of the letter and the bit about
Hercules.  I tossed the steel onto the rack and drove outta
there.

When you make stuff out of sheet steel the whole secret is in the
design of the welded joints.  Being fuel tanks, the design was
even more critical.  Accordingly, my design incorporated a number
of joggles and offsets and overlaps and baffles, all held to very
close tolerances.  

I didn't have the shear or the break or the press needed to make
such artistic shapes and none of the local shops were willing to
tackle the job, saying my tolerances were too tight and the whole
thing overly complex.  About the fifth time I heard that I
started to get discouraged but I remembered The Glowing Letter
and pressed on.  

I finally found a shop to shape the steel.  They immediately knew
what I was trying to do and praised my engineering genius as they
stood around watching me hump the steel off the roof rack.  Their
insurance didn't cover man-handling steel.  But once I got the
material onto their fork-lift, they took over.  Beautiful shop. 
Their last contract had been some hush-hush stuff for NASA. 
Unfortunately, their shop rates were still in orbit but since
they were the only people who appreciated my design and
understood what I wanted, I went ahead and pony'd up the bucks.

That was just the start of it.  Having procured and transported
the steel, and having had it sheared and folded and joggled and
offset, I then had to lug it all home, make up a couple of jigs
and get busy with the welding, which was pretty tricky in itself,
since 16 ga. likes to warp from the heat.  But I kept thinking of
The Glowing Letter and finally figured out the proper gaps and
angles so the seams drew themselves into perfect alignment as the
welding progressed.  

Of course, the tanks leaked.  I marked the leaks with crayon,
ground down the welds, did it over.  And over.     

After only thirty or forty hours of welding, I had my tanks. 
Beautiful things and no leaks at all.  But testing them for leaks
had left a haze of rust on the inside.  I had to buy four gallons
of sulfuric acid and fill the tanks with water and add the acid
and seal them up and roll them over and over and over as the acid
etched the interior of the tanks.

It was messy work, and risky, too.  I got some of the acid on my
boots and ruined them.  Perfectly good boots, less than twenty
years old and just getting broke in good.  Then I thought of the
young woman.  I wondered if she had large breasts.  I decided she
probably did.  I made a note to buy some new boots.  

Neutralizing the etchant came next, after a half-hour of running-
water rinse.  To keep the etched metal from rusting, I mixed
soluble oil with the neutralizer.  When I drained the
neutralizing solution the soluble oil clung to the metal.  I
mixed up two gallons of sloshing compound then discovered I
needed a couple of gallons of solvent to strip off the soluble
oil before pouring in the sloshing compound that would seal the
interior surface of the fuel tanks.

I haven't mounted them yet.  There's still some tricky bits with
the vent lines and the filler neck and the plumbing to the
electric transfer pump, for which I'll need to design a fail-safe
circuit so it can't over-fill the regular fuel tank.  But that
will have to wait until my budget recovers.

Last night I was going over the bale of notes and receipts
amassed while working on the tanks.  The numbers seemed kinda
high.  Depressingly high.  I pushed them back into the file and
checked the e-mail.  There was another message from the young
lady.  I still hadn't gotten around to answering her first
message and this one was even more complimentary.  I read it, all
wrapped up in a warm fuzzy glow.

In closing, she wondered if she might come by the shop to meet
me.  She also mentioned that some blue stuff was dripping from
her engine that had her husband totally baffled and which the
Volkswagen dealer would only look at for an incredible sum of
money.  

Blue stuff?  Husband?  MONEY?

Faintly, far in the distance, I heard the sound of laughter.  I
snatched up the bundle of fuel-tank notes and ran the figures
again.  I'd spent over three hundred dollars to save forty bucks. 
So much for wit and wisdom.

I re-read the woman's first message.  My long blond surfer-god
hair vanished, leaving me as bald as before.  I read the second
message again.  By the time I finished, my Herculean physique was
hanging over my belt.  I fired off a snarling note telling the
woman to stuff a sock in it, the only Volkswagen's I knew
anything about were air-cooleds.  And I obviously still had a lot
to learn.
