Subject: RE:97 Eurovan


&gt;I just got some info from a local dealer on some of the changes from the
&gt;'95 EV Camper to the '97.

&gt;new VR6 engine
&gt;new engine and transmission mounts (3)
&gt;140 hp  (was 109)
177lb-ft: torque  (was 140lb-ft)
&gt;Dual airbags added
&gt;ABS made standard
&gt;Traction control system added (low speed)
&gt;4-wheel disc brakes (rear added)
&gt;Automatic transmission (4-speed) made standard
&gt;Any thoughts on any of these changes???

Comments?  You bet.  Overkill??   I think so.  VR-6, Air bags and ABS are
good.  4-wheel discs is too much for more $.  And what happened to the 5
speed manual transmission?  The 93 and 95 EV's were expensive and these
ones will be even more expensive.  I hope it's not true for everything.  I
bet you won't find a camper equipped like this stickered for under 40K. 
Youch!!!
