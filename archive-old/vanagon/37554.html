Subject: Re: Caravelle?

Bob, 

Thees types of VWs were, and still are, marketed here in Australia as 
Caravelles. The first ones came out in the early 80s after the production of 
the breadloaf ceased.

VWs vans are generically referred to as Kombis here in Australia, 
except the new front engined ones which, at the risk of raising the ire 
of their owners, look just like the Japanese vans anyway. Maybe that, 
and the favourable exchange rate, is why Australians are buying them. 

Just my opinion and, as usual, made with absolutely no research or 
statistics to back me up.
