Hi Greg,

Thanks for the entertaining note. No problem returning the book - we'll pay
shipping both ways.

You also convinced me to take it out of our catalog. We should have taken
it out before but it's the only &quot;book&quot; on VW conversion we could find. The
book, Convert It, though does have some good relevant information and it's
100 x better. I think we'll stick with that from here on out.

I really appreciate your feedback. Just let us know what the return
shipping comes to.

Best regards,

Steve Troy
