Subject: Bus runs again, but stalls
Date: Mon, 27 Nov 1995 22:35:14 +0100 (MET)

Since August (when I bought my '71 bus) I have posted some messages about
what had been happening after the engine got `killed'.
I bought a '78 and transferred the (type I) engine. We had some trouble
getting the engine connected and started, but has been solved now.

Today I went to work on the bus again, as we had only started the engine
but hadn't try to put it in gear yet.
I soon found that the clutchpedal free-play was way too much, about 3/4
of the way. This meant that it was nearly impossible to change gears with
the engine running. Is this the result of replacing the entire pressure group ?
The free-play was adjusted without any problems and I started the car up.
I took the bus around the block, going through all the gears. Now I know
what I had been missing all those months !

The ride went well, but an old problem (from when this engine was in the '78)
was still there: when pressing the accelerator fast the engine actually
delivers less power (is this called stalling ?). What is causing this,
and how do I solve this ?
My immediate thought was flooding, so I searched in the Bentley book but
could only find &quot;Engine stalls when accelerator pedal is released
suddenly&quot; (page 3-12) but this obviously isn't it.
