Subject: COOL VW Stuff!

We (people at work) regularly have trinkets made up with our logo to give 
out as promotional stuff.  Well, I was talking with the company that does 
the work and the rep mentioned that they had some leftover VW stuff they are 
trying to unload.  Needless to say, I jumped on the opportunity.  I imagine 
they have stuff like pens, coffee mugs, keyrings, letter openers, ballons, 
pocket knives, etc.  They will only sell it as an all or none deal.  I 
cannot afford to buy the stuff if I can't pass most of it on.  Apparently, 
this was a run made for a convention or VW gift shop or something.  If any 
of you would be interested, please let me know.  I'm sure the items would be 
rather inexpensive (under $10 or $20, probably $3 - $5 for most items).  I 
just want some for myself and would pass extras on at the same price I paid 
(+ shipping).  Let me know soon, as the stuff will probably be gobbled up 
quickly.

Thanks!
