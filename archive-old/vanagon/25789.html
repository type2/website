Subject: tent poles (still) needed

Hi all-
I've asked for these before, and i still need them!  Many of you have 
suggested ways to build them and i will try that as time permits...

however, being essentially a person that seeks the easy way out i'm 
still hoping to find someone who's dog has shredded their tent but 
has the poles lying around.  i specifically need the 4 angled braces 
that form the top corners of the perimeter supporting the tent.  i 
have the big tent with a floor, orange (mango??) canvas, and a 
blue/white striped entrance.

private email fine if you have them.  chortles can go public if you 
don't!
