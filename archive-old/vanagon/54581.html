&gt; &gt;Besides, that way you don't need a giant socket, a hub 
&gt; &gt; puller and a breaker bar capable of 360 ft-lbs.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry.  Yes you do.  The drum can't come off without taking off the big 46mm
&gt; &quot;castle&quot; nut.  After you remove the nut, you could remove the two bolts that
&gt; hld the hub to the drum and then remove the drum without the hub, but I don't
&gt; see why anyone would want to do such a thing.
&gt; 
&gt; 
No you don't.  The purpose of those two bolts is to let you remove the
drum without removing the hub.  Just release the parking brake, undo
those two bolts and the drum practically falls right off into your
hands.  The only thing that 46mm nut does is hold the hub on.  I do
agree that the hub blocks your access, but I've not had occasion to try
a brake job on my van yet so I don't konw for sure.  But I have been
inside that drum on a few occasions so I know that you don't have to
remove the big nut to remove the drum.
