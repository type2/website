Subject: Re: Rather odd EV 'road test'

Tell us more!!!!

They claim 115mph w/a 2.5 petrol engine? Sounds reasonable...did
150 kph on the Autoroute between Grenoble and Avignon two years ago in the 
2.0 petrol engine.

Now if we can only get HUGH Grant to do a &quot;load&quot; test in the back-seat
of a EV (as opposed to a BMW), maybe VWUS can cu...oops come up with a
new marketing angle! ((nudge..nudge..wink...wink)...its definately a Friday 
afternoon...)


Mind in the gutter as usual...
