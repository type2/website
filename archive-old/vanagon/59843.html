&gt; I like the idea of a newsgroup. That way when I go away for the weekend
&gt; I don't have 250 new mail messages waiting for me. I can easily browse
&gt; a newgroup and look at the threads to see if I am interested.
&gt; 
&gt; If that is a problem, check out the &quot;most recent messages&quot; page
&gt; at http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/
&gt; 
&gt; I use this to avoid mailbox overflow, and reading all the spam you see
&gt; in newsgroups.

So, what you are saying is that we should unsubscribe to the list, and
use this site instead?  Sounds good.  Any negatives?
