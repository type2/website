Subject: early wheel hubcap clips
Date: Wed, 15 Feb 1995 20:46:58 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

I am going thru a frustrating experience with those stupid little
clips for the hubcaps on the early wheels!

I got the old rivets out just fine - I use a hammer and chisel and the come
right off.

The problem is the NEW clips.  I am using steel pop-rivets to hold them on,
which is fine, but when I went to put the hubcap on, the clips BROKE!
1 wheel (the first one) was fine, but the clips on the other wheels are
so brittle its not even funny. 

I bought the clips at the LAPS (not FLAPS), and the clips are made by
West Coast Metric, but they are CRAP!  The first ones came in a baggie
that was shrink wrapped to the carboard, and they were not painted -
just bare metal.  The others were just shrink wrapped, and not in
a baggie, and were painted black.  

I can't believe somebody sells something this bad.  Anyone else
have any input on this subject, or alternate sources for these clips?

I know one of you doesn't like the pop-rivets, but thats all I had to
put them on with, and they went on nice and tight.  And with the
hubcap on, you don't see the rivets!
