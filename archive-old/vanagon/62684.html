-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Ivan,

I've preferred the $65 a year, in Texas, AAA membership.  It's the upgrade
of the  standard membership, and it contains a few &quot;extra&quot; services which I
find attractive. We drive about four times times a year between Central
Texas and Palm Springs,CA and we make at least two trips a year to
Pennsylvania from California, and two parts of the AAA membership appeal to
us, in addition to the usual. The 1300-mile journey is characterized by
lots of sparsely inhabited land.  One important attraction  is the extended
towing allowance, if needed, out in West Texas and the other is the AAA-
approved service providers.  Many years ago, I determined that the AAA
approval was important to those garages and towing outfits that hold it and
it was more of a guarantee of honest service than any other that I could
find.  In addition, the relationships with other national auto clubs and
the provision of trip tiks (itineraries and maps) are valuable to me
because of my personal automobile travel patterns.  Also, I can always find
a person, in an office, in towns along my routes, especially when I travel
to the East.

I've compared the Mobil, Chevron and other gas companies' offerings, along
with several department stores' programs and I can't see any advantages to
them in comparison to AAA's, in either Texas, Southern or Northern
California.

Usual disclaimers apply.

Hi,

Still planning our trip from New Mexico to California and I'm wondering
what opinions ya'll may have on auto clubs like AAA?   Recently, Chevron
has been calling trying to get me to join as well.  I've never been a
member of any but have been thinking that towing, overnight lodging, etc.
might be nice to have w/o having to worry about claiming on my regular
insurance policy.

Thanks,
Ivan  '85 Westy
