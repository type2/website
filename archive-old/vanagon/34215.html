                                        Rebuilding brake cylinders

&gt; Can a person do
&gt;an acceptable (safe) job by hand, just sanding with a high-grit sandpaper?
&gt;Can
&gt;you use your eyes as a good judge of the smoothness?

No.  Buy a brake hone.  They aren't very expensive.  Get one set of coarse
stones and two sets of fine.  You'll do most of your work with the fine
stones.  Use the coarse stones on really cruddy bores.  If they don't clean
up, give up on them.  Seriously pitted bores need to be turned on the lathe.

To hone a brake cylinder you must hold it in a fixture.  Never clamp it in a
vise, as that will result in an oval bore -- a common problem with Brazilian
brake parts.  The fixture can be anything that does put pressure on the bore
or cause distortion.  For some VW wheel cylinders you can grab them in a vise
by their mounting tab, for the others I use an aluminum plate clamped in the
vise.  The brake cylinders are bolted to the plate.  The plate is drilled to
hold several different types of cylinders.  I have a different plate for
master cylinders. 

The hone is chucked into a drill press or drill motor.  I usually use a 1/4&quot;
drill motor but if doing more than a few, set-up the drill press for the job.
 The honing is accomplished by moving the hone back and forth in the bore as
the hone is spun by the drill.  On the drill press, the hone is fitted in the
chuck, the speed set to about 800 rpm.  You move the cylinder up and down on
the spinning hone.  I use kerosene as a lubricant and coolant, spraying it
into the bore from a pump-type oiler.  The kerosene prevents the stones from
becoming clogged and washes the debris out of the bore as the honing
progresses.

While most are statisfied with a well-honed bore, I've found that polishing
the bore gives longer service.  

A polishing hob is a copper or brass bar or pipe meant to be mounted in the
lathe or drill press.  It is a sliding fit at the size you wish to polish.
 You may make it expandable by slitting it and using wedges or screws to
force it slightly larger -- we're talking tenths here (ie, .0001&quot;).  I use
tin oxide or cerium oxide, mixed in a paste with water, painted on the hob
with a brush.  Keep the polishing compound, brush and container perfectly
clean.  If you get a bit of grit in it you'll scratch the bore and have to go
back to the honing stage.  Your best source of information on polishing cast
iron is to locate a live steam enthusiast in your area and inquire about
model steam engines.  Making the cylinder of a model steam engine calls for
the same skills and procedures as for making the bore of a wheel cylinder.
 Such amateur machinists are usually well versed in boring, honing and
polishing small diameter bores in cast iron.

All cylinder bores look pretty good to the untrained eye because of their
ability to catch the light.  Machinists use visual comparison to standard
surface-finish samples to keep from being mislead.  An experienced machinist
can tell you the surface finish by examining it with a loupe for the finer
finishes or by scraping it with his fingernail for the coarser.  

If you are not familiar with cylinder honing, buy a new cylinder of German
manufacture and use its finish as your comparison gauge.  When your honed &amp;
polished cylinders match the German cylinder in a side-by-side comparison,
you will have done well enough... although you can do better with more
polishing.

Since the kerosene and polishing compound will contaminate brake fluid, you
must use MEK or laquer thinner to make the part perfectly clean before
rebuilding the cylinders.  When rebuilding, lubricate the bore and the new
seals with brake fluid.  If you are using two sets of parts and plan to hold
the rebuilt cylinders as spares, wrap them carefully in plastic then in
several layers of aluminum foil, molding the foil to their shape.  The object
here is to exclude as much air as possible from the package.  A wrapping of
masking tape will serve as a lable.  The stored parts should be dismantled,
inspected and reassembled about every two years.

Honing isn't always necessary.  If the cylinders are in good shape I often
just polish them.

The most cost-effective brake system maintenance is to flush the system about
every two years.
