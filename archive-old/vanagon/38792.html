 &gt;Subject: vanagon rear hatch struts
 &gt;
 &gt;Thank you for your interest in purchasing our quality replacement parts from
 &gt;Teutonix Automotive.  You asked about price and availability for rear hatch
 &gt;shocks for the Vanagon vehicles.  We offer replacement parts that are an
 &gt;improvement over the originals.  The improvement is that while these won't
 &gt;spring up and hit your chin with the hatch, they are very reluctant to lower.
 &gt;This is a very good thing if you've ever had a Vanagon hatch hit you in the
 &gt;back of the head.  Often we've seen an owner with weak shocks install one of
 &gt;our Boge/ hydrolift rear hatch shocks and have no more problems.  These are
 &gt;very effective in helping another weak shock.  If replaced in pairs, the rear
 &gt;hatch won't raise itself, and it will require approximately thirty pounds of
 &gt;weight to lower the hatch even with a rear wiper.  We are confidant that
 &gt;purchasers will not be disappointed with this brand and model.  Even if you
 &gt;don't purchase from us, beware of the Suspander Brand.  They are grossly
 &gt;substandard and Teutonix refuses to sell them anymore.
 &gt;
 &gt;The price is $43.00 each, shipping included, anywhere in the U.S.
 &gt;ask for part # 251 829 332  Hydrolift.
 &gt;
 &gt;Teutonix accepts Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express over the 'net
 &gt;or the phone, cashiers' checks, travelor's checks, money orders upon receipt,
 &gt;and personal checks with a wait.
 &gt;
 &gt;Teutonix is family owned and operated.  Sorry, we don't have an 800 number
 &gt;yet.  We're working on getting one and looking into having a website built.
 &gt;tel. (803) 689-5431
 &gt;fax (803) 689-6352
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanx, Norm.
