Subject: Re: Help a paint newbie!

&gt;Hey folks!
&gt;
&gt;After much prodding by my wife (and others), I've decided to look into
&gt;getting myself set up for doing paint work at home.  I know there are some
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;body of the '68 is completely straight and already in primer, so there is
&gt;nearly no bodywork or de-rusting that needs to be done.  I've looked
&gt;briefly through a couple of how-to books, but that is the limit of my
&gt;experience.
&gt;
&gt;My questions follow two tacks:  practical and how-to.  Right now, I'm
&gt;mainly looking at the practical, to see if this is something I can really
&gt;do.  If I decide to go for it (which, if you couldn't tell, I'm leaning
&gt;towards right now), I'll get to the more particular how-to questions later.
&gt;
&gt;So for now, what basic equipment will I need to get myself going?  Here is
&gt;the list that I've put together.  Please send me comments on any or all of
&gt;these items, and, especially, let me know if I've left anything off.
&gt;
&gt;Compressor.  I'm limited to the (dedicated) 120 volt line in my garage.
&gt;Why didn't I put in 220 while I was at it?  I don't know...  I'm assuming
&gt;that I should get the most horsepower and largest tank that I can afford.
&gt;What sort of cfm rating will I need for painting and media blasting?  Any
&gt;brands better than any others?
&gt;
&gt;Hoses.  Type?  Brand?  How many feet will I need?
&gt;
&gt;Gun.  HVLP?  Brand?  Remote cup?  Greg, if you saved those files from
&gt;VINTAGVW as we discussed, could you send them my way?
&gt;
&gt;Respirator.  Type?  Brand?
&gt;
&gt;Sanding equipment.  Anything other than elbow grease?  Will I need a random
&gt;orbit sander?  Also, how much paper of each grit should I count on needing?
&gt;FYI, this car is already in primer- little or no heavy sanding is needed.
&gt;
&gt;Blowing attachment.  Do I need one?  This is the little gizmo that sticks
&gt;on the end of the hose and just blasts air out with a trigger.
&gt;
&gt;Sand/media blasting equipment.  The only things that need blasting on this
&gt;project are the wheels and possibly the fenders (which are new, but in
&gt;cheesy primer.)  What kind of set up will do for this, or should I send
&gt;them out?  What media would I use for best results?
&gt;
&gt;Cleaning/Solvents.  What will I need for cleaning both the car and the
&gt;equipment?
&gt;
&gt;Finally, are any types of paint more suitable (er, easier!) for beginners?
&gt;
&gt;I know this is a ton of questions, but I'm really looking forward to doing
&gt;this project and I'm going to need a little guidance.  If anyone has saved
&gt;files relating to these questions from previous discussions, please send
&gt;them my way.  Every little bit will help at this point.  Also, I'd be more
&gt;than happy to compile this information into a FAQ if there is interest.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

Primer is not waterproof/impermeable, if it has been on the bus and exposed 
to the weather for some time you might consider a thorough resand and reprimer.

I've only painted using a DIY garage set up, fun, lots of work, worked well. 
On the actual painting of your bus: Do the rain gutter regions (side/roof) 
before you paint the nearby flat surfaces. This way you don't overspray/run 
that paint while trying to stick enough into/under the rain gutters. BTDT. 
Bend/squat down to spray the rockers, else the paint just blows by, and 
doesn't land on the lowest regions. BTDT.  (I wouldn't pay me to paint a bus 
BTW!, professional advice is worth having!)
