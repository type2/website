&gt; 
&gt; And the answer is...
&gt; 	MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL!
&gt; 
Good God Man, HOLY GRAIL quotations, now we're really degenerating,
I'm getting out of here befor someone starts singing &quot;I'm a Lumberjack&quot;

ONE, TWO, FOUR... THREE SIR.

I'm a bus driver and I'm OK,
I work on it all night, and sleep all day,
I adjust the valves, and change oil,
I like to pick wildflowers.

(well I do)
(everyone feel free to sing along)
