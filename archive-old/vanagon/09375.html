Subject: Administrative ragging.

I'm home sick and in a bad mood, so I'm going to lecture the list.  I've 
already sent a couple of personal messages, but just to save me some more 
ragging I'm going to say it here.
The listserv is set up so that replies by default go to the list.  There 
are a fair number of people who don't like that, but it makes the list 
what it is, and that's the way it's going to be.  However, what that 
means is that if you reply to the list, you need to be conscious that the 
message you just got was ALREADY seen by the list members within the last 
24 hours.  Most people can remember basically what was said, so what I'm 
asking is that if you reply to a list message that you DON'T include the 
ENTIRE text of the message you are replying to.  Please.
End of rag.

Tip of the day.  You come into work on a weekday and horror of horrors, 
there are only 72 messages in your inbox and only 70 of them are from the 
vanagon list!!! What's going on? Is the list down?  Your first instinct 
is to dash a message off to Gerry, but you pause and remember this.
On the vanagon gopher 
URL gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon
the first item is &quot;Status of the Listserv&quot;
If you go to Status of the Listserv, it'll return two lines of stuff.
If one of those lines is
/home/halfdan/server/listserv/serverd -l 10 -e
then the list is up and you can conclude that someone actually spent some 
time WORKING! (It's not true...they're just composing messages off line 
so they can post them in the evening).

Hope that's of value.
