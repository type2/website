Is $3,000 to much to pay for this baby?  I've had some estimates on
the water pump and exhaust, I think I can get them done for about $800.

First, I gotta repeat the same recommendation made earlier....maybe =
running it by the VW dealer and asking them to give it a kind of =
pre-purchase inspection might help give you the confidence to buy, or =
the information required to make perhaps another decision...however...

...I guess it depends on your intended uses.  We need the bus for daily =
use, for business travel (we are contractors on a nuke deactivation and =
site remediation job here in Idaho), and recreational travel ( two =
adults, two kids, two dogs, one exceedingly arrogant cockatoo, and one =
cat ).  Our bus fits us like a glove.

So if your intended uses, your budget, and a thorough, professional =
inspection of your bus all match up, sounds like you might be on the =
right track!
