Subject: 

&gt;A while back their was a thread regarding &quot;interchangability&quot; of vanagon
&gt;driver and passenger seats with other car seats, ie. Audi 4000?
&gt;Any more info? Anybody installed non-stock seats?

I installed some junkyard (but excellent condition) Vanagon seats in my 
'76 Westfalia, and they are infinitely more comfortable, and work fine. 
They are complete with the fold-down armrests, but did not come in orange 
and green plaid, so don't fit the interior color scheme (was VW on drugs 
in '76?).

It took a bit of machine-work to get the runners to fit.  I used the old 
runners and attached them to the new seats, so that the turn-around passenger 
seat would work, too.  Some work, but DEFINITELY worth the effort!
