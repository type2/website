&gt; He wants $650.
&gt; 
&gt; *My* only possible hesitation here is the side damage (and any secondary 
&gt; damage that may have caused).  Do I need to be &quot;skittish&quot; about a bus which 
&gt; has taken a tumble like this (i.e., bent frame or other horrors not outwardly 
&gt; apparent?).
&gt; 
&gt; What's the consensus from the list?  Would &quot;the list&quot; have any hesitation?  
&gt;( I haven't driven it yet)

I can't speak for the whole list, but I can give you an opinion.

Your test drive should be the key to determine if the frame has been bent.
Bring along someone to ride behind you so he (or she) can observe if the
bus &quot;crabs&quot; down the road. While driving, does the bus seem to track
properly. Also, check the tires for even wear.

If the bus just &quot;fell&quot; onto its side, (perhaps as a practical joke performed
by some inebriated friends) there probably is no damage. If the side damage 
is the result of some sort of collision, then look for the signs I mentioned
above.

To put things in perspective, the repair bill for my vanagon's blown coolant
hoses, water pump and fan belt will be about $650.
