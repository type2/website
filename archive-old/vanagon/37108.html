Subject: Re: Rocker Shafts--1600cc

Ron,

As you've probably noticed,  stock VW rockers have drilled oil passages.
 Unfortunately, the part of the rocker-arm shaft facing the crankshaft is
starved for oil due to the constant pressure from the pushrod and valve
spring.  Poor lubrication results in rapid wear on that part of the shaft and
on the contacting surface of the rocker.

To compensate for the asymmetric wear the rocker-arm shaft is normally
rotated 180 degrees when you do a valve job, presenting the new, unworn face.
 If the rocker-arms are not worn beyond spec (check with a snap gauge), they
may be reused.  But once both surfaces of the rocker-arm shaft have been
used, it should be replaced.  If you prowl the junkyards and check any
rocker-arm shafts you see (they dismantle in less than a minute with only a
screwdriver to pry off the hairpin clip), you'll often find shafts that are
only worn on one side.  If you install them with the unworn side down, they
will make a suitable replacement.

To improve oiling, some mechanics deliberately groove the lower side of the
shaft.  I've found that this appears to accelerate wear in the rockers-arms.

I don't know why anyone would want to bead-blast a rocker-arm shaft.  It is a
precision ground shaft.  Bead-blasting would destroy the polished surface.
 Unless rusted, they clean up fine in carb cleaner.

Every rocker-arm shaft comes with its own built-in gauge.  The portion under
the tower reflects the original dimension of the shaft.  Make sure the stud
hole does not have a lip -- if it does, polish it away -- and try a new
rocker-arm on that part of the shaft.  The amount of play is what the rest of
the shaft should feel like.  Compare the unworn portion to the worn parts,
and you old rocker-arms to the feel of the new one.  If the amount of wear
does not appear excessive you can reuse the parts. 

I don't know the dimensional spec, I'm sure it's lurking somewhere in the
manual.  But the inspection method above will provide the information you
need, plus you can pick-off the dimension of the shaft from the unworn
portion.

I keep a few unused, original VW parts as gauges, picking dimensions from
them instead of looking them up.  Trial fitting a known-good part is often
the best way to determine if the part it is being fitted-to is worn beyond
spec. Measurement by inspection, or trial fit, is a valid procedure often
called 'gauging.'.  Using a gauge is faster than using mikes or dial calipers
and saves wear &amp; tear on your precision tools.
