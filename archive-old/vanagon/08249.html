Subject: You know you belong on the vanagon list when....[F], for those who , care

You are on vanagon, vintagvw, and rec.autos.vw (Thom....)

You subscribe to at least one humor list (I KNOW Martha's at least guilty...)

You read all articles for `substance' (Ric?, mabey all of us...)

You will drive a VW bus for any reason...`Yeah, sure, I'll drive the 40
miles to the store to get beer.' (Well, that's all of us....)

You wear flannel. (You Know Who You Are...)

You try to mask technical experience with `book learning'  (JOEL...)

You pretend to be a `lurker', then post 10x in one day... (DavidS...)

You ask Joel; `Can we be indexed by our VIN numbers...?'

You post most things in a drunken stupor, and expect people to actually
_understand_ what you mean...(Eric Oster...)

You have read this _entire_ list...

You love your bus, and will depend on it to take you anywhere......
