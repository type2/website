&gt;Oh, by the way, I don't know how you get so much time to do all this
&gt;typing and research, but I want a job just like yours. ;)

HA! if you guys think you can sweet-talk me into divulging MY secrets, you're
nuts! :)  it took me 13 years to find this rat-hole to hide in, and now that
they've all forgotten about me, it's almost perfect. Phantom of the Computer
Center ... nyah ha ha! ;)

besides,  i learned to type a long long long time ago on old manual typing
machines, and did an awful lot of it on some really old clunkers ... so i
can type a whole bunch faster than most of you plonkers. :)  (and it looks
like i am SOOOOOO busy!!!)
