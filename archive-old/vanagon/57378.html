Subject: FS: Multivan

I saw a very nice late-model ('91 I think) Multivan sitting on a dealer's
lot today. White, great shape in and out, stone guards (or whatever you call
that lower body armor), pop top, full length rear bench seat plus two
additional rear-facing seats, A/C, 85K miles, manual transmission. No price
advertised, but I'm sure they want (and will get) top dollar. Contact
University Volkswagen in Seattle (not me please) if you're interested.
