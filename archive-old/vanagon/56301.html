Subject: Coolant Leak: heater

Vanagoners:

	The coolant leak three weeks ago was caused by a leaking distribution
unit. After wasting a few days before diagnosing the problem, my mechanic
took almost ten days to get the part. He went through the dealer. The
cost: $110, parts and labor.
	Because of the postings on the list, I took some time to check the heater
core under the rear seat. Found a very slow leak between the valve and the
heater core. The 7mm bolt didn't seem loose and tightening it didn't seem
to stop the slow (1-2 drops/minute) leak. Clamped the inlet hose and tried
to unfasten the fitting to investigate, but coolant flowed copiously.
Tightened it back up, sopped up coolant, and called it a night.
	Presumably, with cold cooling system and clamping both intake and outflow
hoses, one can examine the fitting without spraying coolant. Any advice?
The leak is on the far side of the valve, where it is bolted to the heater
core; 2 7mm bolts. It's a 91 Carat.
	The coolant distribution unit (part # 251.121.438.B) differs from the one
pictured in Bentley (19.11) Perhaps the one pictured in Bentley is
251.121.438.A?
