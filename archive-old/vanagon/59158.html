Hmm....i'm not certain where the head studs are located on a wasser, BUT! 
if one can get a MIG or TIG welder's tip in there, you'll be fine...

take the case to someone who welds....either MIG or TIG (TIG prefered...)..

and have them weld a nut onto the end of the busted stud...weld through 
the center of the nut.....

after teh weld has hardened, but is still warm, get a wrench on it, and 
start unscrewing it...(the leftover heat will help it come out....:)

it works better than those damn extractors....:)

and works on most everything....

later...david....

(btw, i learned this from someguy or the other who has/had a machine(?) 
shop, on either the T2 list, or the VintagVW list....to give credit where 
its due...:)
