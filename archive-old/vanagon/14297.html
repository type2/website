Subject: Re: The Flue covers are all reserved but....

&gt;As the subject says, all of the flue covers I ordered have
&gt;been spoken for.  If more people want them, I'll put in a
&gt;second order after the list builds up.  
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!

At such a time as you put in another group order for flue vent covers, order
me another 5. Meanwhile I'll send, like, $14 for the two to cover shipping,
the box, the gasoline, etc.. OK?

I'll have to see if your address is in this PC somewhere.
