Subject: Tiger581 CDI for VW

Here's the one CDI Bob Hoover recommends.

Universal Corp.

970 242-5267                get Tiger581  $84.99 includes shipping

I just installed this one...easy.  Uses existing points as trigger
and has the capacity to switch from electronic to points if the unit 
fails.
