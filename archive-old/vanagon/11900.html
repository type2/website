Subject: Misfortune, woes, disasters,  dammitall 

I'm not having fun anymore.  Why is life such a bitch?  I was 
downtown on Friday afternoon, the blue thing full of elderly, 
defunct mainframes belonging to a friend.  I was just doing him 
a favour in moving them from one place to another.

I slowly accelerated from a standstill and one of the bungee 
straps securing the load snapped.  The sodding cabinet sailed 
majestically through the rear window of the van.

Thanks to Galvo, outside whose place of work this happened, I 
didn't go completely berserk.  Mind you, I provided some of the 
people in reception with great entertainment as I banged my 
head repeatedly off the desk.

He rang up every dismantler on the west coast to find a 
replacement screen for me - but to no avail.  Only one place 
had Transporter rear windscreens and that was in Limerick, 
twenty miles away.  Everyone else said that the T4 was too 
recent and that they weren't crashed very much.

So, off I went to Limerick.

Good news - they had a screen.
Bad news - it was 180 pounds! ($350 approx.)
Good news - it had the heater element for demisting.
Bad news - the van doesn't have wiring for that.

When I went home, I ran out of diesel.

Have I offended some deity?
