Subject: Re: help - bentley manual



&gt;I just called around to the 2 VW dealers in town and neither has a
&gt;Bently manual in stock. They can order them in no problem, but 
&gt;they cost $145 + GST.  So does anyone know where I could order one 
&gt;for cheaper?
&gt;
I have them for $66.00 (US) plus shipping. Shipping to Canada 
should be about $10.00 via US air mail.  
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
