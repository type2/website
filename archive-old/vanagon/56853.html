Hey all,
Well, time is getting short before the Kiptopeke camping trip.  

For the stragglers, I've been organizing (with a little help from my
friends) a camping trip at Kiptopeke State Park on Virginia's Eastern
Shore for the weekend of March 7.  Anybody who wants to join up, please
let me know before Friday.  

As for those who are already signed up, I'm looking forward to meeting
all of you.  Hopefully the weather will be nice, it's been rainy here
the past couple days so hopefully by this weekend it will be all rained
out and we'll have sun and nice temperatures.  It looks like we'll have
a fairly decent turnout.  Unfortunately, John Anderson has informed me
that he will not be able to attend due to family obligations and Steven
Dolan has said he will try to make it but isn't guaranteeing anything.

On the other hand, Chris Chubb has said that for sure he will stop by on
Saturday with maps for back-road exploring.  This will be particularly
useful to me as I plan to kick around on the Shore for the early part of
next week in addition to the weekend.  

Take care all and I'll see some of you on Friday evening.

Sean
