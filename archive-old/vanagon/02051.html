&gt; &gt;that sounds really high.
&gt; &gt;Under no circumstances exceed max on sidewall.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; What you've just found is a classic VW cheap move. The tires that are MOUNTED
&gt; when you buy the vehicle will handle up to 55 psi. The &quot;identical&quot;
&gt; SPARE tire will only go to 40 psi.

I've never looked at the max on the sidewall.  When I got ready to do a 
trip to Chicago (370 miles) I looked at the door plate and inflated to 49
and 36.  The ride was really nice, and I think the hight pressure made 
for a better ride and better tire wear.  I only hope that I didn't 
inflate past the max on the tire.  In my very limited experience, I'd 
recommend the recommended tire pressure for ride and mpg, but can't say 
anything about safety.  I'd be really glad to see more people say what 
they inflate to.
