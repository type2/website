Subject: Re: stove=heater=safe?

Still alive.  I haven't run the stove - yet!  :)

The reason it seems that the stove in a westy is vented (at 
least to me) is that there is a round silver
thing on the outside side panel of the car that says something like
&quot;flue vent,&quot; no?  Is this not venting the stove?  If not, then
what IS it venting?
