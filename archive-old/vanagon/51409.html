Subject: Re: Manuals


I now have the Haynes, Bentley and Clymer manuals for my '81 Vanagon
and I find the Clymer the most generally useful.

The Haynes is good, but it covers every model of the Vanagon made from
'80 to '83, including stuff we never saw here in the states.

The Bentley manual assumes you're a qualified VW mechanic and doesn't
have the step-by-step &quot;do this, then do that&quot; routine that most of us
really need.  I just got this manual so it covers everything from '80
to '91; lots of extraneous stuff.

The Clymer is the most complete in my experience, giving pretty good
step-by-step guides to most of the common things that home mechanics
do.

As a practical matter, I usually look at all 3 manuals!
