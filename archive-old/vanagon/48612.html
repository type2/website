&gt;Has anyone had any experience in moving an inoperative Vanagon a couple of
&gt;hundred miles using a Tow Dolly with the rear of the Vanagon mounted on the
&gt;TD axle and the front wheels on the road surface?  The Vanagon is without
&gt;engine, without spare tire and with one rear tire of questionable
&gt;character.

Tom,
Here's what the Bentley book has to say about towing (with my comments,
rearrangement and paraphrasing):

ALL VANAGONS: (My advice here. Bentley doesn't exactly say this, but they'd
probably agree) &quot;Towing&quot; on a flatbed truck or flatbed trailer is the
preferred method for
all Vanagons.

A. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION:
1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  Lock the wheels with an
external wheel lock device.  Do NOT rely on the steering column / ignition
switch lock.  No speed or distance recommendation is mentioned in Bentley.
2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground:  Tow van at up to 30 MPH for
up to 30 miles.  Use dollies to lift rear wheels if these limits must be
exceeded.
3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van at up to 30 MPH for up
to 30 miles.  Driveshafts may be removed if these limits must be exceeded.

B. MANUAL TRANSMISSION ( two wheel drive):
1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  Lock the wheels with an
external  wheel lock device.  Do NOT rely on the steering column / ignition
switch lock.  No speed or distance recommendation is mentioned in Bentley.
2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground:  Tow van at up to 50 MPH for
up to 50 miles.
3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van for unlimited speed
for unlimited distance.  (Yes, the Bentley book actually says unlimited
speed.  I can just hear the phone call now: &quot;Well, I was towing the Vanagon
behind the Blue Flame out here on the Bonneville Salt Flats and.....&quot;)

C. MANUAL TRANSMISSION ( Syncro, All Wheel Drive):
1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  NEVER! (Unless I suppose
you've disassembled part of the drive train to prevent problems!)
2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground: NEVER! (Unless I suppose
you've disassembled part of the drive train to prevent problems!)
3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van for unlimited speed
for unlimited distance.  (Yes, unlimited speed.  See comment above in C-3.)


My comments: 
When towing with all for wheels on the ground, make sure the steering column
ignition switch lock is unlocked.

What's left out of the above: 
Specifics on attaching sling type towing equipment.

A curosity: 
The recommended limits for towing a 2WD Vanagon on its rear wheels only is 50
miles &amp; 50 MPH.  The recommendation for towing the same vehicle with all
wheels on the ground is for unlimited distance at unlimited speed.  Why the
difference?  The only explanation I can offer is that the gear oil is tipped
toward the rear while the front wheels are raised and at its normal level
while all wheels are on the ground.
