Subject:      '81 Westy excessive clutch pedal play

Over two days my clutch pedal has gotten very loose, to the point where
it's almost all &quot;play&quot;. The clutch still engages fully, I have no trouble
shifting, but to engage it I have to depress the pedal all the way to the
floor and only the last couple inches actually activate the clutch. Letting
off the clutch gradually takes some very subtle footwork.

I didn't know the clutch was hydraulic, and even the guy at the Parts Place
was surprised when he checked the Bentley manual and found that the clutch
and brakes share the master cylinder. Anyway, the brake fluid was a hair
low, I topped it up and this helped the clutch slightly for a day. Now it's
all loose again but the fluid level is still good and there are no apparent
leaks. Has anyone else experienced this problem or have any suggestions?
