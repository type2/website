Subject: high pressure LP gas for appliances

A while ago someone asked about taking LP gas from a Westy's tank for 
small appliances such as BBQs and lanterns.

I just this weekend installed an &quot;Extend a Tee&quot; from Marshall Brass. I 
bought it at an RV place for about $25. It was a cinch to install. It 
goes between the gas valve and the regulator...these appliances use high 
pressure gas. I had a 25 foot hose made up so I can put the BBQ on the 
picnic table in most cases.

It works like a champ. I might add a tee at the end of the hose so I can 
use my lantern and BBQ at the same time.
