Subject: 63 Westy sold for CHEAP

A buddy of mine had been trying to sell a '63 Hitler Hatch Westy. All mint
green and 100% dry and relatively straight considering it's age (perfect
nose/dinked rear passgr corner). Asking price had been $1500. with a locked
up 40hp and all of the interior and both bumpers. The price included a zero
mile brand new rebuilt tranny.  Finally sold it yesterday for $1200. He was
way bummed when I talked to him last night. He is in between jobs etc. The
bummer was that he negotiated a price with a local fella who nit picked the
death outta the bus. No more than 30 minutes later a well known mid-west
&quot;WestyGuy&quot; called. It woulda been perfect for his needs at the full price,
without a doubt.
