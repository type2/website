Could someone please explain what a resitor type plug is and which years
of the Vanagons use them? I am currently using W77C's which are suppose
to run cooler, but now am wondering if they were designed for waterboxers
(mines an 82).

BTW there was athread on rec.autos.vw discussing the merits of platinum
plugs and basically it came down to this. If your ignition system is
marginal, then platinum plugs will do wonders; but if it is up to snuff
and/or a high powered system the the difference will be negligible. One of
the few cases where adding a high tech item might actually compensate for
weaknesses in the overall system. DC
