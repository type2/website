Subject: Re: Tires again !?!

Re-Reading this I realized my tone might have been too strong.  Sorry!

I'd just like to emphasize for new people to the list that the FAQ on Ron's
Web page is in its infant stages.  It's a great idea, but doesn't really
contain &quot;THE&quot; answers to the FAQs. Just a lot of good things to think about.  
&quot;THE&quot; answer is not to be had.  There are lots of opinions by lots of people
-- some of them more knowledgable or experienced than others -- and it is
your job to decide whose opinion is the best for you.

One example is that there are people on this list who swear by Yokahama tires,
and yet there's no mention of them in the FAQ.  If you really want to know
what opinions are out there, you need to search the archives as there is no
agreement about many of these things, there are only lots of opinions.
