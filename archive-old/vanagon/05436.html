Subject: `66/show/`63 update

Well, I'm driving the `66 everywhere now. All sorts of gremlins are 
popping out of the woodwork now. (Mostly electrics.) The show starts at 
9:00 am. The `63 I am.......(it's hard to say this.)...parting out,
but there isn't much left...most of it went on the `66. Including the
bumpers. (Sorry, Thom.) I can check for you at Bry's auto wrecking here
in Seattle, their prices are reasonable, but it may require the use of
a hammer to straighten. PLEASE don't cut that spare tire section out
of an old kombi! It's getting really hard up here to find one that that
hasn't been done to. Most professional camper conversions include the
placement of a second cargo floor beneath the existing one for strength.
Rumors of a barn door hiding in a barn up here....have to check it out.
Mabey Thom won't be so smug then.
