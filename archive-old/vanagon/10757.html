&gt; &gt;&gt; Can anyone elaborate for me on the relationship between Jack Kerouac
&gt; &gt;&gt; and VW busses?

&gt; &gt;Well, Jack did have a thing for Mexican women.  In fact, so did 
&gt; &gt;William S. Boroughs, it almost got him a life sentence once, or 
&gt; &gt;something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Burroughs escaped to Northern Africa after killing his &quot;wife&quot; in a drug
&gt; induced fracas.  As far as W.S. Burroughs having a thing for Mexican
&gt; women...  He might have come closer to having a thing for Mexican men. :-).
&gt; BTW he's still alive and living in Lawrence, Kansas, where he is a tenured
&gt; professor of English at the University of Kansas.

I used to drive by his house on my way to work.  It's a very small little 
bungalow with a few cats &amp; a dirt driveway, very non-descript.  As far as 
his tenured professorship, he recites poetry and has readings now and 
then, but that's about it (my mother was an English Professor at KU).

VW content--a friend of mine had a 78 Westy a block to the west of 
Bourrough's house.  An old Datsun usually sat in Burroughs drive and a 
friend of his (male) had a late model Volvo Station wagon that sometimes 
sat in front of the house--no VW's.
