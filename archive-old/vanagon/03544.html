Seen several of them over the past year.  Don't know where
to get one though.
P.S. I'd be interested in one also.  They are pretty cool!

'81 'falia

&gt; Being a 'newbie and all, I'm hesitant to overstep the bounds of propriety
&gt; and offend anyone, but having found this wonderful forum, I just can't
&gt; suppress my curiousity any longer.  So here goes (and I really don't
&gt; think it's all that bad):  About a year ago I spotted a recent model
&gt; Westphalia, parked in a rather large (and, incidentally, definitely
&gt; upscale) local restaurant parking lot, sporting a rear window decal, that
&gt; looked exactly like the standard VW Fahvergnugen sticker, complete with
&gt; recumbent stickman figure, that read &quot;Fukengruven&quot; even including umlauts
&gt; over the &quot;u&quot;'s.  I'm sorry, flame me, call me tasteless, heck, kick me
&gt; outa here (no, not that please - I'll behave from now on), but I WANT
&gt; ONE!  My wife, a staid, reticent woman of pure Norwegian descent, will
&gt; even let me mount the d*mn thing!  As anyone else seen these?  Where can
&gt; I get one (preferably by special courier, or maybe I could settle for FedEx)?
