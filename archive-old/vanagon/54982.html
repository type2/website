Subject: Time to upgrade...

In the past I have been the proud owner of a '61, 21 window rag top, a
'78 type 2 and now I'm the owner of an '85 Vanagon GL.  All have been
passenger vehicles. I now wish to purchase a late model &quot;Westy&quot; and/or
Syncro for camping.

Now, its time to start doing my homework. Can anyone tell me of a
publication that describes and gives specifications of the various
Vanagon models since, say, 1985?
I've searched the Archives but haven't come across anything that gives
me what I want.

BTW, can anyone tell me why the Vanagon was discontinued after 1991?

Thanks in advance.....
