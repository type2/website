     Wait, 
     
     What are you saying about 2) below?  Isn't that what a battery 
     isolator does?  If you use a switch, then the isolator is of 
     absolutely no use, right?
     
     I hope my library has a copy of that book.  I need to read it.

2) The battery isolator is of no use whatsoever without a &quot;battery selector 
switch to take one of the batteries out of circuit during charging.  The 
switch
you need comes from a marine supply house (try West Marine chain in US)
     
3) the reason for 2) is best understood by reading a book on Marine Electric 
systems try &quot;The 12 Volt Bible&quot;
