&gt;&gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond' suggest
&gt;&gt;using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly toxic (it is for
&gt;&gt;this reason that you don't compost them)
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Now that's an interesting potion.  If I were to experiment with rhubarb
&gt;leaves, where does one get these?
&gt;
&gt;Bmoran

Rhubarb leaves contain the chemical, oxalic acid.  This is the chemical
that makes them toxic, and the chemical that makes them useful for metal
finishing work.  Oxalic acid can be used (in dilute solution) as a
rust/tarnish remover.  It is commonly available in hardware stores as a
wood bleach.

P.S.  I'd experiment with using homebrewed oxalic acid solutions on scrap
pieces of chromed or rusty metal before dunking your valuable metal parts!
