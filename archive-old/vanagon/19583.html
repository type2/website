Subject: Re: Bus camping in Washington, DC


     DON'T camp anywhere around RFK stadium, unless you are with at least
     ten other buses. That is not a nice neighborhood; you will routinely
     hear gunshots at night. But it is worth checking out if some sort
     of quasi-legal, or at least tolerated, camping happens near RFK,
     perhaps in the north parking lot. But DO NOT do it alone...

     WAL-MART has not arrived in Washington yet, only nibbling around the
     suburbs 40 miles out.

     Alternatives-I'm afraid I'm not to helpful for closein locations.
     There is a (ack!) RV park near Route 1 just north of the Beltway
     near College Park. There is a rest area (on both sides) of I-95 about
     half way between Baltimore and Washington - that is a sure thing, big
     rigs pull in to sleep all the time. I do not think there are any legal
     camping grounds inside the Beltway. If you are only coming in for one
     show, camp at one of the numerous parks within about a fifty mile
     radius. Otherwise, is the usual guerrilla camping scene - just be
     careful where you try it...

     Once its over, I would be interested to hear what you did find...how
     'bout a trip report?
