Subject: Re: vanagon turbo-diesel

Steve Maher refers to my Porsche-powered Vanagon as &quot;pretty much [an]
all-VW conversion&quot; which understates the glory of the thing a good deal
but does hint at the relative ease of installing an engine that is config-
ured very much like the VW four.

For those of you who are looking to power up wasserboxers, here are some
fax numbers for German companies that (at least a few years ago) were
putting Ford V-6s into VWs:
ML Tuning 02823/3930
A. Winkler 02323/82374
Staubermann 02534/5166

In other news, I passed NJ inspection this morning -- no problem except
the expected need to swap the halogens out and back in.  I thought the
jig was up when the inspector got his mirror-on-a-stick and looked at
the muffler.  Whatever he was looking for, he apparently found it, and
I'm street-legal for another year.  The original VW engine, sitting in
the garage in case of need, can wait at least 12 more months.
