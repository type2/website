Subject: Re: Buying 88 Vanagon- Anything I should know 1st?

Thanks to everyone who replied!!! Unfortunately, I did not purchase the
vehicle because my wife hated it. Since she would be the primary driver
that sort of ended my search for a Vanagon.

I did not get a chance to put it through its paces, but if anyone is
interested the 88 Vanagon is available at a local dealership here in
Sacramento, California for the price of $2,850.00. I can forward more
specific info to anyone that requests it. Thanks again and Merry Christmas!





&gt;I am contemplating the purchase of an 88 Vanagon. It has 173K miles with
&gt;70k miles on a rebuilt engine. The vehicle seems to run well and appears to
&gt;have been well-cared for. The selling price is $2,850.00. Seems like a
&gt;great deal. Anything I should look out for or inspect closely before my
&gt;purchase? 
&gt;
&gt;The idle hunts up and down a bit, but I think that is normal for the German
&gt;cars with the oxygen sensors. I had an Audi and a VW Jetta that both did
&gt;the same thing. Other than that, it seems fine.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
