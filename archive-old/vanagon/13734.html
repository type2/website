Subject: alternator light on

Help.   I don't know what is wrong with my '77 bus.  I was having problems
with the alternator light coming on until eventully it stayed on all the
time.  I figured it was the alternator itself.  I had recently bought a 2.0
liter from someone with all the fuel injection components (mine had a 1.8
with a carb that never ran right) so I decided it would be a great time to
put in the new motor.  After getting it in, it runs great, except that the
alternator light still comes on.  The alternator that is in the car is off
the 2.0 and I had it checked out as good at a starter/alternator/generator
shop, so I do not think that it is the alternator.  The light comes on
brighter when the headlights are on and when the engine is reved high.  Does
anyone know what could be at fault?  I also do not think that it is the
voltage regulator, because I have tried the regulators off both the 2.0 and
the 1.8 and they act the same.  I was thinking it may be the battery or a
short somewhere. ????
