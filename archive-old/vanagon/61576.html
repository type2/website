Subject: &lt;syncro&gt;  snorkels

Hi Syncronauts,

I think the term snorkel is a bit too generous for the intake ducting in the
Syncros.  That system will let water seep in at most of the joints, since
they are push-together. If you want to see a VW snorkel look at the crewcab
and LT  installation details given in the 'Adverse Conditions...' bulletin.
The pipe sections are glued together, or held with clamps.  

What the OEM Syncros does is to get the intake above ground level a ways,
unfortunately it's still at the rear of the vehicle, unlike the usual 4x4
with upfront engines.  The cyclone trap does work well, I've dumped rain,
mud, and very fine dust out of it at various times.  Well worth scrounging
for any 2WD vanagon.

Likely the Syncro intake could be properly sealed against water, but the
distributer etc. are still low enough to limit fording to 16-18&quot;, so no real
point in 'fixing' the snorkel.  My $0.02.  Anyone done anything special
about waterproofing the engine in other ways?

Tim
