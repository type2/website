Kip and listees,

Contact Martin Schneider Design, 818-448-8726, for Porsche/Vanagon

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; I have had an 84 Vanagon for about two years now.  I have had two different
&gt; people tell me that a Porsche flat six will fit in the rear (one guy owned
&gt; such a monister).   Does anyone know if this can be done?   I am not ready
&gt; to do it at the moment, but if anything serious happened to my engine, this
&gt; might be an option.   I'm sick of being passed by everyone and not passing
&gt; anyone!
&gt; In the meantime does anyone have any bolt-on performance suggestions for
&gt; the 1.9L.
&gt; Will a 5-speed tranny bolt up to this engine?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Kip
