Subject: 86 Syncro

The folks at Bus Boy suggested is e-mail you about my Syncro which I am
trying to sell.
Details:
1986 Vanagon GL Syncro, 138,000 miles on chasis, vw recalled the van
when it had 70,??? miles and put in a new engine/heads/clutch because of
a porrosity issue in the castings. The van has been well cared for and I
have all records.  The van has spent almost all of its life in Napa, CA
where I lived for the past 12 years.  The van is medium blue, in and
out, has front and rear A/C, front and rear heat, fly rod racks inside,
front rotors were replaced at 100K, rear drums rebuilt at 135K, there is
an aftermarket (Kenwood) AM/FM/Tape deck with CD changer control, and 4
Polk Audio speakers and a rear differential lock.  Everything works
well.  I am selling it because we are looking for a similar vehicle with
a pop top (our two young boys no longer can sleep with us in the rear
fold down queen bed).  
I can be reached by phone at 612.475.8095 (w) or 612.476.1138 (h).  I'm
not sure if you are in the market or just a resource to help me find a
buyer.
Please advise,
Chuck Ankeny
