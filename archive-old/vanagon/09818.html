Subject:       Re: getting and staying bent...

Steve clarifies:
&gt; Yeah, but do I want to do this?  I don't want to lose too much pressure
&gt; of the blade against the window or it will not give a good wipe.  I'll
&gt; play with the adjustment and see.

STOP!!!
MIS-COMMUNICATION (...What we have here is a failure to communicate)

Don't bend the arm 'up and down' in a manner that would add or 
relieve pressure on the glass.  Hook the cresent wrench on the flat 
part of the arm and ROTATE the arm so that the blade angle changes 
along the longitudinal axis of the wiper.  I guess this would more 
correctly be called a 'twist' rather than a 'bend.'  It will make sense when 
you go out to do it.  Hint:  place the wrench as close to the blade 
end of the wiper arm as possible so as to give the maximum amount of 
arm length for the twisting to occur.  

Let me know if this still seems futz'd up.  I hate trying to describe 
things verbally-- if you could just see my hands....
