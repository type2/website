    My advice would be to boycot the AAA.  I was a member for a
    few years when I had a 76 bus too old for my insurance to give
    me towing cover.  Now I have  nice &quot;new&quot; 84 westfalia I have
    had the pleasure of dropping my membership.  IMHO the AAA is
    a backwards anti-environmental pro-gas guzzling pressure group.
    They are against any increases in auto related Tax that might
    actualy force us to pay the true environmental costs related
    to driving.  They actively oppose the use of public money to
    fund alternative transport.  As a dedicated auto user I do not
    feel that they represent my interests.  Read their newsletter
    if you doubt me.  I complained about their policies several
    times but of course did not get satisfactory answers.  They
    are very useful but I am glad not to have to be a member!

Hear! Hear!

The Right Honorable Gentleman from the State of Oregon
knows his facts.  Here in the great Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, the AAA Board includes such a collection
of hacks, bought-and-paid-for lobbyists disguised as
legislators, and assorted conflicts of interest that it
is a wonder they haven't gotten a thorough debunk by a
major newspaper.  No, wait, former editors of same are
on the Board.  Fancy that.
