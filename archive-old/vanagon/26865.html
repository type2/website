&gt;&gt;You said that you saw the spark advance
&gt;&gt;when you rev the engine but double check the weights inside the
&gt;&gt;distributor for movement.  Spray liberally with WD40 if dry.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Don't get WD-40 on the point contacts! Also don't get it on the distributor
&gt;cam lobes where the little phenolic piece on the points rides. There's
&gt;a special grease on the cam lobes (or should be!!), but WD-40 might
&gt;wash it off.
&gt;
&gt;If you get WD-40 on any of these parts, dry them off with a paper towel,
&gt;re-grease the cam lobes (NAPA has the grease if you don't already), and
&gt;back to the drawing board.
&gt;
&gt; 
If you get WD-40 in the distributer, it can burn.  I found this out by
spraying it in the distributer of my wife's '72 Pontiac LeMans will it was
running.  Nice little flame out the adjustment window!
