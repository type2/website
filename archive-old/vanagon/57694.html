Subject: F/S: porta potty . Gotta go?

Hello from a some times lurker .
My 85 westy arrived equiped w/ a rather nice chemical toillet . 
I want to part with it as I prefer a good cat hole to cold plastic . 
All the instructions for it are included  . It has a nice cover that is an
excelant match to the brown/tan interior of my 85 westy .
Price is 100.00$ and I'm located in philladelphias western 'burbs .
