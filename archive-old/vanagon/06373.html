So Jim Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; Intro:  I'm one of the new unknowns and I do have the missing 65 
&gt; microbus.  It's a Westphalia with the split front seats and a pop top.
&gt; Also have a 67 Westy, 59 Single cab and a 71 Karman Ghia convert.
&gt; I'm always looking for parts for any of the above so let me know if 
&gt; anyone has any extras.

Well Another Walker... I'll bet your one of Joel's 2nd or 3rd cousins.  ;)
