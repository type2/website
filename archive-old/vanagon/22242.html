Subject: Re: PTFE as Transmission Eli

Speaking of transmission oil, the other day I figured I'd replace the oil in
my 87 Syncro transmission and could NOT find any fill plug.  I did find the
drain plug, but think it'd be a bit difficult getting the new oil up into the
transmission.  Where is that fill plug?
