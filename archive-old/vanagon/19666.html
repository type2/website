&gt;From the June 26 issue of the Providence Journal (RI):

1990 Vanagen (sic), Synchro (sic) 4x4, runs/looks great.
$7500 or best offer. 401-294-9660

I spoke with the seller. It has 97k miles, no engine work has been done
(heads are original). He is leaving hte country so he is selling this 
and some English cars. No A/C.
