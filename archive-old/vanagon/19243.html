Subject: shortened 59 single cab and other tinies

Saw an ad for a very strange bus today, it was a '59 single cab,
but it was way too short!  It looked like somebody chopped out
the middle third of it, so the space between the front and
back tires was really small.  Kind of like a single cab
cab with a double cab bed :)  They wanted $3500.  If anyone
wants the phone # email me.

Also, same price, an Isetta 300!  The strange thing where
the whole front is a door and it looks like the robot monster
in a bad 50's movie.

Wants a bus with some room inside!
