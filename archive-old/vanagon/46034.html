Subject: fun road trip for free parts

Hi volks,

here's a mini trip report of yesterday's activity:  Thursday someone
posted on the local &quot;umich.forsale&quot; newsgroup of some VW parts, free, about
a 40-min drive from Ann Arbor.  Of course the prospect of buckets of
rusty, oily, junk parts of no use got us all excited here so a caravan of
three (my '62 bus with Malika the intrepid dog, Greg with his '71
Squareback and Emily the intrepid daughter, and Dan (since his bug and
notchback are &quot;in resto&quot;) in somethingorotherwitharadiator set out on the
quest.

First Greg and I had stopped off to check out a convertible super that a local
woman had just got (drove down to Texas to get it and drove it back!), that
was fun.

Then it was off to free-part-land (read:  son off to school and  dad says
time to clean out the shed).  The deal was we had to take everything and
that it
was admittedly mostly junk.  This proved to be the case, as heavy wire baskets
of rusty old pistons and rods were loaded into my bus, as well as an engine
which had seized sometime in the 70's and had sat outside since then (it had
a &quot;B&quot; on it but no serial number, a replacement case?).

I wish I could report that bins of barndoor bus parts were found, but no, mostly
engine stuff that should have been thrown away a long time ago.  I did get some
stuff I could use, like underneath engine tin in better shape than what
is on my bus now, and Greg liked the Type III fuel-injection fuel pumps.  The
convertible that we had stopped off to see needed heat-riser seals and a
shifter, which it will now have, and Dan's bug gets an intake manifold.

Other potentially useful stuff was some beetle turn signals, knobs, and a
steering box, and a whole box of new engine bearing sets, plus some things
like another 34PICT 3 carb that I can take parts off of.

The only thing I'd never seen before was some aftermarket distributor, made
by Scat, big enough for the condensor to fit inside.  Also, has anyone ever
seen a Bosch &quot;019&quot; distributor or know what it's for?

OK I've rambled on enough, just wanted to share a fun little road trip.
