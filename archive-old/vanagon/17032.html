Subject: Speaking of Vanagon Shocks

I was thinking that new shocks may improve the ride/handling on my '87
Vanagon GL. While browsing the Bentley manual the other day in my spare
time, I noticed that it says that you need a special tool to undo the top
nut on the front shocks. Can it really be? Have you guys successfully done
this at home in your garage (or parking lot) without the VW tool? Also any
ideas on good replacement shocks?
