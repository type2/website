]&gt; This I'm not convinced about- given that the drive plates at the

]&gt;CV. I agree that the wheel must effectively do most of the moving but
]&gt;in practice the geometry dictates that the angles that the CVs take on
]&gt;must be the same.
]&gt; Intuitively the wheel does the moving, in practice the joints experience
]&gt;identical motion.
]&gt; I may be wrong but if so then I would appreciate an explanation of why :-).

]hmmmmm. the man has a point. :(  i guess it is true that while the transmisison
]end OUTER shell doesn't move much, the inner shell has to move with the axle
]and so, must match angle for angle with the wheel end (of the axle).

Cousin Billy from the Olde Country is correct.  The loads on the inner
and outer CV joints are virtually identical.  FWIW, the angles are
actually slightly greater for the inner ones than the outer because of
camber changes allowed by the semi-trailing arm, but the difference is
negligible.

]rats. if it's too good to be true, it must be. but it sure SEEMS like that
]wheel-end joint, moving up and down as much as the wheel does, OUGHT to be
]doing something MORE than the wall-flower-transmission-end.  i wish i had
]paid more attention to which end had more burnt spots. well, i can always
]check the current set when i do them in a little while. i'm gonna still try
](if they are not toooo burnt) to swap ends and see how far i can go.

]i do remember reading something about vw changing the transmission for the
]water-cooled vanagons, and part of that change was to relocate the cv-joint
]so that there was a zero-degree angle front-to-back-of-the-car between the
]two joints on each axle. it seems that on all the older buses, there had
]been a small angle there, in addition to the large angle of up-to-down from
]transmission to wheel ends.  but, again, the angle does have to be the same
]at each end IF the joints are parallel. aha! but what if they are NOT parallel?
]hmmmmm. nah.

They are so close to being parallel that you might as well consider them
to be.

]ok. so what have we got?
]1. joints need grease.

Greasy marijuana?

]2. more grease is better than less grease.
]3. grease dries out. needs cleaning off and replacing.
]4. joint boots dry out and crack and get cut. need replacing eventually.

Particularly if they're on the front CV joints of an old Eagle and your
son thinks it should be used like a Jeep.   :-(

]5. flipping/reversing should extend the life of the joint for a while longer.

More often than not.

]6. bolts can be a bitch to get out. best to have lots of options.
]7. star-bolts is better bolts if you can get them.

Try your local industrial fastener supplier.

]8. re-check the bolts after a while. they might loosen up.

Sounds like a potential security problem to me.  We wouldn't want them
giving away any secrets, now would we?
