&gt;If I had $30,000 to spend...Hmmmm.....
&gt;

Buy the vintage Westy, get the best you can whatever year, I love the shape 
too. Drive it only in the summer. With the abundant (?) leftover $$ buy a 
NON-Westy Syncro, club cab would be wild, and drive it only in the winter. 
See, easy fix, and you wouldn't have to insure two vehicles either. Best of 
both worlds.

PS: this is the only politically correct solution, pleases all, except those 
EuroVan fools (ooops, donning my asbestos undewear now!)
