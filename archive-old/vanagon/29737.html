ooh!  ooh!  don't suppose you have the PN on that adjustable 
regulator??  i imagine an auto-electric shop would know just what 
they are...  good tip!

===============================================
Just because you are nice people, I went out to my car and checked my
&quot;emergency kit&quot; and found toe original fixed regulator (that is set at 13.3V)
in the box that the adjustable regulator came in (unfortunately, that
regulator departed with the car in which it had been installed, so all I have
is a &quot;limp along&quot;  unit) .  The adjustable regulator :

Transpo Electronics Inc.
IB370A
Ref VR/BH Assy
BO Adj.  12V

Cost was $24.95 about 5 years ago from a local Alternator/Starter rebuilding
shop.

This was a direct replacement for a Bosch 64 amp(?) alternator.  It mounts on
the back of the alternator with 2 screws, nominally at the 12 o'clock
position, and when you remove it, the two brushes that ride the slip rings are
attached.
