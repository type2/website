&gt;&gt;Very nice job, Joel, but where are the pre '67 buses? How long were they?
&gt;
&gt;sorry guys. :)  Ralf distracted me. ;)
&gt;1950-1955 Kastenwagen, Kombi, Bus, Krankenwagen,   4100 mm overall length
&gt;          Pritschenwagen                           161 inches, 13.5 feet
&gt;1956-1959 etc.                                     4190 mm overall length
&gt;                                                   165 inches, 13.7 feet

Now you're talking! :)

&gt;1960-1964 etc.                                     4280 mm overall length
&gt;                                                   168 inches, 14.0 feet
&gt;the Grossraum-Pritschenwagens were, again, longer (4300mm) and the later
&gt;single and double-cab pickup trucks were 10mm longer (4290mm). hmmmm. kinda
&gt;odd, that.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hmmm. I always figured the 2-door and 4-door Rabbits were the same length.
&gt;&gt;Where did the length go? It certainly wasn't in the back seat legroom!
&gt;
&gt;i always thought the extra length was in the pillar between the front and
&gt;rear door (it looked thicker than the same pillar in the 2-door).

Hmm. There's such a difference in the front door length that I never
noticed the pillars. 

Some mystery. Guess will have to find some and measure 'em...
