Rod--

        I can't help you, but I had something similar happen.  I had a
bolt fall out of the linkage resulting in losing gears 1,2 and 5.  And the
shifter went really limp!  Since I was on warranty and the free autoclub,
I had it towed and the dealer fixed for free.

I wonder if there's a design flaw here.
