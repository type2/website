Subject:      FFFFriday Follies: One More Once ...

Gimme a &quot;V&quot;, Gimme an &quot;O&quot;, ...

V is for the Victory of wrenching,
O is for the Other times I've lost,
L is for that Lost and Lonely feeling
     when the dealer tells you what it cost!!

K is for the Thousand miles I've driven,
S is for the Speed I never had,
W's for the Wagen that has striven
     to carry me through weather good and bad.

A is for the axles always turning,
G is for the Gears that sometimes grind,
E is for my Even-tempered engine,
and N is for the End of this here rhyme. :)

Put them altogether, they spell &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
Who made the Buses I have learned to love.

:)
