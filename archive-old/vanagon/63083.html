Subject:      cool find - alloy wheel

I finally got around to pulling out the spare tire to see what shape
it was in.  Yeah, I know, I should have done that a long time ago,
but I didn't.

Imagine my surprise when I pull the little ring and out pops an
original VW alloy wheel!  It was dirty as all hell, but after some
dishsoap and a plastic scrubby, it's like new!  Now I'll be on a
quest to scrounge up 3 more (but not at $650 a set :-P~~~).  Now I'll
have to go back and review that alloy wheel lug nut thread.  :-)

Regards,

-Karl
