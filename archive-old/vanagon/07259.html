Subject: A/C an' all that stuff. 

I've been intently reading all the comments about 'fridges and 
air conditioning. 

You people should come over here.  I have never *seen* (or 
felt) in-car air conditioning.  All this talk about such things 
just sails right over my head.

Then again, our 'isle of mists' never gets sunshine, either.
