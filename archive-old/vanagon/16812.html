Subject: Re: Canvas Cot Conundrum...


&gt;&gt;will an early (Late 60's/ early 70's) cab-area canvas cot fit into the 
&gt;&gt;mounts on my 78?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, no problem. I've seen two versions, oldest is round tubing with welded 
&gt;on ends that fit into the brackets, newer are square tubes with a gentle 
&gt;bevel cut off and end bent over to fit brackets. I've shortened new ones to 
&gt;fit a Vanagon, works fine, has to be higher up than older busses. If you can 
&gt;pick one up cheap do it. They are great for heaving towels coats sneakers 
&gt;and even children into, keeping the floor clear.    tim s.

This answer is not 100% correct.  The cot design changed in 1976 so that
the poles are collapsable (each pole made of two rods, one of which fits
in the other).  From personal experience, a 68 cot will fit up to a 74
at least.  My 73 cot WILL NOT fit in my 77.  The front fits tightly but
the rear will not go in as it is too short.
