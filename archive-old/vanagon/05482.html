Subject: Re: mufflers


Hey kids!

Good news on the muffler front.  I am rebuilding my exhaust/heater assembly
(thank God the exchangers are still solid :) ) and I am buying most of the
parts from our dear freinds at Rocky Mountain Motorworks.  They have a free
flow muffler for my particular breed o' bus ('78 siebsitzer) for, get this,

$126.00!!

The reduction of back-pressure, not to mention the &quot;bitchin'&quot; idle note, make
this a real steal.  Before you Midasize (read &quot;overspend&quot;), check with
Dave Pennell at Rocky Mtn..  He just spent 20+ mins. with me on the phone
ensuring that I had all the components I need.  Since RMM works on commission,
I feel loyal to Dave.  Real nice guy.

Get yerselves the Bus Stop catalog and stop overspending.

-Kurt

P.S.  I ahve no connection with Rocky Mountain.  No motivation except being
a very satisfied customer.

P.P.S.  I know I typo'ed friend.  Sorry! :o
