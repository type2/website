Subject: Air in cooling system - advice please...

Things are starting to look scary with my `84 van (100K miles).
For some reason, air pockets build up in the cooling system.  I
just had my mechanic check everything out; he pressure checked
the cooling system and found no problems.  No coolant leaks from
hoses, connections, or the engine.  No signs of coolant in the
oil.  He bleed the system of air and sent me on my way.  100
miles later, I find the coolant level in the reservoir (not the
expansion tank) has risen from &quot;MIN&quot; to 2 inches above &quot;MAX&quot;
(probably about 30 ounces of fluid).  I experienced the same
behavior last time he bleed the cooling system about 1000 miles
ago.  Luckily, I have not noticed any signs of overheating, just
low coolant level in the expansion tank and high coolant level in
the reservoir.

I hate to be negative, but I'm suspecting combustion gases
seeping past the head gasket.  Anyone else in net-land care to
comment.  

Next week, I will probably take the van in to the dealer (yikes!)
or another mechanic for a second opinion.  If you know of anyone
in the Portland, Oregon area that knows Vanagons well, please
fill me in.

Thanks!

Dave Johnson
