&gt; but the heating system alone holds alot detracting from the 
&gt;thermal storage.  likewise, they are slow to warm due to the quantity 
&gt;of coolant.  yeah, yeah, the thermostat is s'posed to hold up the 
&gt;circulation until things are warm but experience says other-wise.  
&gt;also, there are *2* heater cores pulling as many BTUs as they can from 
&gt;the engine.

&gt; my personal unfounded biased 
&gt;opinion is that one *seems* to warm the van up faster if the engine 
&gt;gets to temp quicker *then* the heat is turned on.  totally 
&gt;subjective.  i do this occassionally but wouldn't dream of suggesting 
&gt;it to my wife...  leads to &quot;the look&quot; given an obsessive husband.  

According to my better half, I resemble the last sentence.  I'm also married
to a great lady who unfotunately defines &quot;cold&quot; as any temperature below 82
degrees F.

Sounds like what we really need is the secret to how BMW does it in their new
5 series car.  According to reports, there is some sort of heat storage unit
that &quot;retains heat generated by the engine for serveral days, feeding it back
into the car immediately whei the engine is re-started.  Not only does the
eigine warm up more quickly, adding to improved efficiency and fuel
consumption, but it also makes for warmer passengers and cleaner windows.  the
air from the heat vents after the car has been parked for two days at -6
degrees reaches +68 degrees in 30 seconds.&quot;

If wishes were horses I would  have one today!
Harvey
