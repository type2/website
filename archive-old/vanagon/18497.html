Subject: Re: Front shocks for a '71 bus

Mitch sez-

&gt;Hi folks-
&gt;
&gt;I hope someone can shed some light here.  I'm trying to put some new
&gt;shocks on my bus (in this case, KYB Gas-A-Justs) and have encountered
&gt;some confusion.
&gt;
&gt;I mail-ordered new shocks all around and the rears went fine.  The
&gt;fronts that arrived claimed to be for bugs up to 65, but the supplier
&gt;claimed that they were also the right ones for the bus (I beleive
&gt;71-79 or some such).  Unfortunately, the sleeve in the lower end of
&gt;the shock will not fit over the stud on the bus.  The
&gt;currently-installed shocks don't have a sleeve on the lower end, just
&gt;the rubber bushing.
&gt;
&gt;I called the vendor again, and they suggested that I &quot;just pry the
&gt;sleeve out with a screwdriver.&quot;  No dice; they are bonded to the
&gt;bushing, and I chewed one up trying.  I called RMMW and they verified
&gt;that they sell the same shock for that application.  The KYB number is
&gt;KG4521, by the way.
&gt;
&gt;So; what gives?  Did VW change the shock mount in mid-71?  Is that
&gt;oversize stud on my bus really the old sleeve self-welded to the stud?
&gt;Anybody got any clues?

Yes, it's the old sleeve bonded onto the stud mount.  I went through this
on my '77 and my buddy's '71.  You basically have to do what you need to do
to get the old sleeve off the stud.  What worked for me was soaking like
crazy with WD-40, some heat, and a pair of vice grips.  After soaking, I
put the vice grips on the bastard just as tight as I could, then rapped it
with a hammer until it loosened up.  When it starts turning on the stud,
you are halfway home.  Just keep turning it until it loosens up good, then
you can pry/pull it off with whatever tool works best for you.

When mounting the new ones (btw, I used the GR-2's up front both times- the
Gas-a-justs were just *too* stiff under my butt up front there!  Used 'em
in back though) I smeared the stud with anti-sieze for next time.  When the
bus died and got hauled off to the knacker yard (rust cancer), we pulled
'em back off with no problem.

Good luck!
Bill
