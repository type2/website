Subject:      'VW Driver' Fall 97, error

Hi All,

I was just looking through the latest 'VW Driver' put out by Volkswagen of
America and was surprised to see an error on page 12.  There is a picture
of an early, carbureted wasserbox motor with &quot;2400cc 6-cylinder diesel&quot;
captioned underneath.  Did anyone else catch this boo-boo, or is there
something I am missing?
