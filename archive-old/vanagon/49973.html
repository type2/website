&gt;&gt;&gt; The Eurovan, however, is not considered very safe.  I remember hearing the
&gt;&gt; Car Talk guys talk about how uncrashworthy the EV was in some test or
&gt;&gt; other. ( It might have been consumer reports, or gov't tests, I don't
&gt;&gt; remember).
&gt;
&gt;	I'm skeptical.  VW hangs part of their reputation on safety.
&gt; Does anyone have a reference?

i've never heard the Car Talk show, but from what people have told me that
they've said, i don't think i would believe ANYTHING they said about
Volkswagens or any other &quot;foreign&quot; car. it seems (to me) they have some sort
of personal hatred for anything other than GM, Ford, or Chrysler.

i don't suppose one of their sponsors would be Consumer Reports, would it??
