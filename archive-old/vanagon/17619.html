On the subject of fridges...

I put a couple of Coke cans in the fridge on the door compartment. After
about three days of sitting there, the fridge door sagged enough to let
the cold air out. I tried to adjust the door hinge, but it would not
close as tightly anymore (the door was thus warped). So, what I did was
to fabricate a plastic door latch at the bottom corner of the door (oppo-
site the hinges) so that the doors clamp tighter again. Has anyone
ever experienced this 'door-warping' after putting stuff on the door 
compartment?
