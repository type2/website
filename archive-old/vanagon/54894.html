Subject: A Close Shave - paint required near Munich!

Well not a nice day for a Friday: somehow managed to lose all my
bookmark files, i.e. all those carefully accumulated VW links :-(  
and then had to swerve to miss 2 pedestrians running down the (very 
narrow, no pedestrians HA! HA!) spiral  exit ramp of the local food 
hall car park and didn't quite miss the central wall :-(  $%^$#_at_!!.  

Result: somewhat less paint on the sliding door and rear quarter 
panels and an &quot;interesting&quot; body line (the van's, not mine!).

Anyway, to the point:  can anyone living in Germany 
recommend a good paint mixer in the Muenchen area?  I guess I'm in the 
garage this weekend.

Oh yeah, the Eberspaecher Standheizung has packed up (again).

This isn't the 13th is it????
