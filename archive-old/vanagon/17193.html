&gt; Lee, Not to be negative, but how long have you had the P44's, a
&gt; friend had a set on his '79 Dodge Challenger, bought them at
&gt; SAMS (discount warehouse place) they had a &quot;40,000&quot; mile treadwear
&gt; warranty, and he paid a bit more but felt great he was getting
&gt; Pirelli's instead of cheapo Generals, at 15,000 miles they were
&gt; totaly gone treadwise, might have lasted another couple thousand,
&gt; he went back to SAMS and complained they said everyone had these
&gt; problems and they were not reccomending them.  They gave him a
&gt; generous prorating (more than he deserved) he got a set of General
&gt; XP2000's and with 10,000 miles they look brand new.  I note the
&gt; wear on the P44's was even across the tires, on all 4 and not due
&gt; to alignment problems, etc.  Frankly I am steering clear of Pirelli
&gt; in general as a friend had bad luck with P6's on a CRX.  On the
&gt; subject are the non-reinforced P44's a wise choice anyway, though
&gt; since they are S rated probably do have stiffer sidewalls.  Plus I

I have had good success with the P44s on my rabbit truck.  I used a set of
175/70-13 for over 60K miles before taking them off.  They still had about
1/4 thread left on them.  I took them off only to use a set of Dunlops on
alloy wheels.  After about 30K miles I wore those down so I got another set 
of P44s.  The old P44s make a good set of rain autocross tires.  I was
surprised how well they handled.  I also got the P44s from Sam's also.

The XP2000s are pretty good also. I have a set on my GTI that are 4 1/2 years
old and they still look good.  They are holding up well even with a year of
autocrossing on them.  I have heard that the P6s aren't as good as they used
to be.
