&gt;The final tally: $1,331.16.  The carb itself only accounted for $350 + 150
&gt;(labor) of the total.  Here's the rest.  How's it look to anyone?  Fair/unfair?

     You have the carb on a high pressure FI system? Does the
     carb work with that pressure? Was the whole fuel system
     altered?! Any idle problems?
