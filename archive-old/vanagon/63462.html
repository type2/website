&gt;When you get the lenti list started could you drop me a note.
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to send the list a message explaining what happened and what
&gt;we've been doing to rectify the problem. I also want to send a cheer the
&gt;FEDEX way and a not so cheerful toot the UPS way.

&quot;My&quot; UPS drivers were *highly* ticked that the %^&amp;%%$#% union never 'let'
the members vote - both felt  (&amp; stated 'all' the other drivers felt the
same way) that their beloved union was trying for a power play &amp; not really
working on behalf of the workers. 

Usual disclaimers - as a former union member/believer.
