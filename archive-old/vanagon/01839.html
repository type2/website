Subject: Re: sychroning carbs

Use a long pvc pipe and &quot;listen&quot; to each of your carbs (filter 
removed). Ideally you are looking for a similar pitch from each carb 
adjusting each carb's idle mixture screw.  It 
does work; I use it on my KG Kadron dual carbs.

 This advice was passed on 
to me by a mechanic who worked on MG's for years...
It IS cheaper than  buying  a  unisyn - DC

&gt; OK, I've been reading this thread for about a month now.  What I've read
&gt; has helped me in a lot of my troubleshooting problems with my '72/'73 bus.
&gt; I've also noticed that you all really like to bash mechanics, which they most
&gt; definitly deserve.  I however have a simple problem.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that:
&gt; 1.)  I hate to give a grease monkey any more money to work on my bus.
&gt; 2.)  I don't know of any efficient way to sychronize the carbs.
&gt; 
&gt; My question lies therein.  Is there any way that I can sychronize the carbs
&gt; myself?  I've read the Bentley and it's very explicit about how you should
&gt; &quot;take it to an authorized VW mechanic&quot; to have this done.  It then gives this
&gt; lenthy definition of how to adjust the carbs.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem:
&gt; 3.)  Bentley says you need a CO tester.
&gt; 
&gt; Without going out and buying a couple thousand dollar Sun measurement machine
&gt; is there a way to test the CO level?
&gt; 
&gt; I know this probably a hopeless case but I'm just hoping that the Bentley
&gt; manual is wrong.  Well, just this once.
