Subject:      Norcold analysis

Fellow Norcold owners,

The high altitude kit is in and I've done some study of the problems that we
have all written of concerning the fridge in our Eurovans.

1.  I do think it's very important to keep the thing close to level.

2. Our flame went out once before we got the high altitude kit.  We left the
van for the morning exercises in the toilets and returned to see...no flame.
This was after a full night's running fine.  I believe the flame can be
snuffed out by the air pressure created when closing the large hatch in
back; maybe even the doors could do it.  Tried to kill the flame this
afternoon after the extra kit was installed...could not kill the flame, even
when all the doors were closed at the same time.

Would someone without the high altitude kit  try closing the doors to see if
the flame in the standard Norcold can be snuffed out by the increased air
pressure?  Try it with the van out of perfect level position to really test
the theory.

3.  Possible analysis; if the van is:  (a) out of level
                                                           (b)  without the
high altitude kit
                                                            (c)  you close
the large doors/hatches
        I think these would contribute to the flame being killed.

Well, &quot;Let's have a little music, Ray.&quot; and test this combination to see! (G)

Wish you were here,
Gary
