Many owners of Type II's are not aware that Volkswagens form a symbiotic

rhinos their tick-birds and crocs have those bold little birds to do the
dental work, the Type II is not complete unless there's a Type I in close
proximity, ideally one having the same engine, and being in the same state of
repair.  When this bond exists, the Type II will run smoother, get better
mileage and require repair less often.

what you are refering to is the well known spiritual nature of vws.  In fact,
they like most to reform the Holy Trinity, of bug, bus, and Karmann ghia.
 It's a synergy thang.


Many women will not understand this.  Perhaps it's a guy-thing.

come come, what?  I think it's a mess/junk thing, though I guess I come from
a place where expectations are less rigidly gender defined.  I've met  men
who want to  get rid of the junkers, and I have happily drug the poor waif
home.  It's how i got my beloved beetle.  BTW, it was his ex girl friends
bug,  and there were two of them.    Between the two, and a battery, I got
one to drive away. =)

I would insist on an early bug myself, and never get a Stupid Beetle.
