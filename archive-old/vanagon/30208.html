Is there anyone in the country that stocks Eurovan parts?

I need the plastic pipes the connect run from the firewall just below =
the brake booster to the rear heat exchanger in behind the right front =
seat.

My local dealer indicates that there are none to be found at any of the =
parts depots or any other dealer and it could be a while before this =
part can be found.

Has anyone had any success in getting VWoA's attention when it comes to =
parts problems?
