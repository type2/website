Subject: Re: Questions--Re: WTB 86+ Westie Full Camper (long)

Gail,

Please don't be discouraged by so many of us asking for parts and repair
help.  The main reason, is that there are FEW mechanics across this
country that know enough to repair these fine vehicles.  Most that
actually know what they're doing, charge an arm and a leg.  There are
only a few out there that are worthy.  As such, most of us have resorted
to the DIY approach.  Granted, a number of listees would probably be DIY
just because they want to!

I have owned an 87 vanagon for 2 years now.  It's not a camper, it's a
wolfsburg which has plenty of great features.  It suits us just fine for
camping too.  With the arrangements of seats, it's great around town. 
And it has the table and bed for overnighting it.  An ice chest that
plugs into the cigarette lighter serves as the 'fridge' on long trips,
and a good ole coleman for heating things up.

I have NEVER been inclined to work on my vehicle until I started having
problems with my vanagon.  After being, as you say, on the wrong side of
the cash register way too much, I turned to the list and found the
engine  quite easy to fool with.  It's not overly complicated and, with
the guidance of all the gurus you have access to on the list, something
just about anyone can tackle.  There are still some things that I
wouldn't touch (like brakes--don't trust myself yet).  But, with the
help of the list, I know that I can go to a mechanic with a good
diagnosis in hand.

If you find a Westie, and I hope you do, be prepared to work on it some
yourself (or maybe a friend or such can lend a hand if necessary). 
You'll be much happier if you do.  If you're not able, turn to the list
first so that you can go to a mechanic prepared.  From what I've heard,
you'll have better luck finding a good one since you're in California.

I really think that they are good reliable vehicles.  The better you
maintain it, the better off they are.  With good, timely maintenance you
don't have to worry too much.

As for your ECU question, ECU stands for Electronic Control Unit, aka
'the brain' or the computer unit that controlls the fuel injection
system.  They are, typically, very reliable and not 'fragile'.  When
they do go out, they ARE expensive!  That's why you've been reading so
much about them lately.  Most people will try anything they can to not
spend the $600-$700 (or more) for them!  My 87 has 133K and no ECU
problems.  I've read where some people were told to have them replaced
only to find out that the whole problem was caused by a $40 sensor (or
something even more minor like a loose or broken wire!).

Keep looking, and I hope you find what you're looking for!
