Subject: Almost robbed at VW parts counter today!!

Hey Volks,		
	
	I went down to the local VW dealership today to get a 
few parts(by the way this was my frist time at the VW parts 
counter). So I walk right on in after seeing that they had 
sold one of the eurovan campers(six months ago the sales 
manager had said the wouldn't last through the week end, this 
was at five o'clock sunday afternoon). Sorry getting a little 
off track here.	
	I let the guy at the counter know what I need And he 
starts looking at the microfich. I said, &quot;I would like to 
have the cover and locking plug for the water on my 80 
westfalia&quot;. He starts looking and has a little trouble 
finding it. So the service manager gets involved. He tells 
the other guy that there is a westi in the service area let 
me look and see if I know what I'm talking about.
	So I show them. Well the service manager looks at me and 
says, &quot;What do you need?&quot;. Again I pointed with two fingers 
and said,&quot;see this little black square thing on the end I 
need that one and I need this little plug.&quot; We go back and 
forward like this a few times(I guess they send the service 
manager to the same school as the used car manager now!) 
	With that part all taken care of I return to the parts 
counter. The guy who works at the counter is rather nice, He 
starts to look up the price and he writes down $81.00. So i 
figure that is list for the whole thing. Then he writes down 
$32.00. Now where I live in NYC you get use to reaching in 
your pocket and forking over money all day long. But this 
time I said NO!!! Sorry that's too much!!		
	So if you've lasted this far into the story maybe you 
know. Where can I get these parts for less than my last parts 
van cost.		


Thanks!!
