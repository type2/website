When you get ready to put up wood panelling inside, a good source is 
regular panelling, but just be sure to get the type using a wood backing 
as opposed masonite.
Some owood panelling on the reverse side of the &quot;regular&quot; side is 
actually very very pretty and makes a swell inside job fer the VW Camper 
walls.
Also ........... A lot cheaper than the other stuff.
