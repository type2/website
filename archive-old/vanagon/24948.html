Heres another thread to bitch about:

Movies/VWs/Fantasy/Rusty's finally over the edge


-Al Pachino as Tony Montana in &quot;Scarface&quot;
Lambada,
The &quot;Forbidden&quot; Dance! 
and We are the Cuban Brotherzzzz!
(You cock-a-roaches, youze guys anyhow!) 
&lt;and things you can't EVEN say on the list! (EEK!)&gt;

................................................................

-Rusty VanBondo as BenPoon in  &quot;Car-face&quot;
Here we are! Two (One?)Coo-ban (Dutch/whatever- don't get picky?)immigrant
brotherz in America, Home of the Free! Don't you just love it?
(Take these cars that look like Cock-a-roaches, youze guys anyhow!)
&lt;and things you can't EVEN say on the list! (EEK!)&gt;

What would have happened if Ben Poon, famous importer of the beloved breed,
took a direction of and had the demeanor of Senior Tony Montana (Mon-ton-ya).
History would have been quite different, VWs would have been alot more
popular and BUNCHES more expensive! People would own multiple vehicles,
keeping them on the sides of their properties, in the back yard, and be like
totally obsessed by them. Folks would create fanatical groups simply for the
search and obtaining/hoarding and maintaining of their vehicles! Can you
imagine people basing their relationships solely on their passion/obsession
of Volkswagens! Gosh these obsessed souls would travel miles and spend WAY
too much money just for bits and pieces of these vehicles. Barter, banter,
buy and sell! VW,VW,VW... These obscenely posessed people would never be the
same after only one ride in one!!!! 

Street Scene, Big Parking Lot just after dawn, Pomona, California:
&quot;Whadda ya MEAN $1000. for NOS single cab gates?!! Only last week you GAVE
me some engine tin for FREE!!! YOU GOT ME HOOKED! NOW YOU'RE KILLING ME! AAAHHH!

The final scene would depict us (oops, YOU all, not me) trying to break into
his placial estate to get at his stash of NOS 25hp parts and what-not cabinets!
&quot;Come and GET ME!!, Karmann GET ME!!&quot; YOU &lt;insert more things you cant EVEN
say on the list.&gt; Visualize a totally wired Ben Poon (realistically played
by rvb chewing on a COO-BAN cigar, brandishing a totally cool illegal fully
automatic weapon. Ben would eventually get killed and everyone would puss
out and start driving waterpumpers or dodge baby vans (so sad). It would be
an ending more cruel and uncomfortable than having to wear a pair of those
&quot;knock me down heels&quot; and sell cosmetics to fat women at the Dayton-Hudson
store inside the Galleria (depending on the color?- oooh, Rusty you're so
bad! ;)  ).
