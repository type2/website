Subject: many questions about the westy..

or, maybe just the late mdel bus in general..anyway..


first, in re: to the bus burnings, and fuel line problems, is the oddly 
riged fuel lines on this thing. i got the carb &lt;2 barrel proggressive&gt; 
yesterday morning, so today i started working on it. it seems that a PO 
had already 'verted it to carberation. anyway, the fule lines run as follows:
two lines off tank &lt;normal for FI, right?&gt; one going directly to engine 
compartment, the other running across bottom of bus to driver side, 
attatched to a &quot;thing&quot; looks like it may be a fuel pump, has wires 
dangleing from it. from there, it runs into what i KNOW is a fule pump. 
it is &lt;now&gt; connected and running. from there, the line runs into 
compartment and attaches to the other &lt;!&gt; fuel line. from there, they go, 
i assume, to the carb. so, anyway, if i rip all this out, should i block 
the return line &lt;i asume that is what it is..&gt; at the tank? or should i 
leave it combined? &lt;i DO know i will rerun all the hardened old rotted 
lines..no fire here!&gt; and what bout that &quot;item&quot;? what is it? it doesnt 
impead fuel flow, 'cause i pumped all the old gas outta the tank &lt;didnt 
even want to think about running that trash through the engine!&gt; i will 
use my new fule pump bought for this purpose..and the fuel lines..are 
they 1/4&quot; or 3/8&quot;? it seems that there is quite a combination of this 
running in this bus.. which should i use?

and now the oil..

i pulled the plug on the old oil, &lt;surprise! one bolt, and the strainer 
falls in my hand!!:)&gt; but i have heard rumer that these engines have a 
&quot;real&quot; oild filter &lt;found a new german one in the van wheni got 
it!&gt;..where is it? and, these baby's hold 2.5 qt's, right? or did they 
increase capacity on these motors?  as the oild DUMPED on my hands, i had 
opportunity to &quot;feel&quot; it..it felt not to bad..no metal particales &lt;maybe 
filtered out?&gt; and it still had a decent consistancy. smelt it and it 
just barely had a ting to it..no where near what my 68's motor has every 
time i hange it..&lt;has nice chunks of metal too, but i digress&gt;

and the other problem...
i went to change the plugs, &lt;boshe supers to install&gt;, and stick the 
wrench &lt;sparckplug socket, 3 inch extension, and ratchet&gt; in engine 
compart ment, and guid e the socket down the hole in the tin for #2. not 
sure where exactly the plug is under there,i pull wrench back out. well, 
the socket falls off the extension. i stare dumnfoundedly at the hole in 
the engine tin for a few moments before sticking my fingers down there. 
nothing. i can feel the plug, and the head, but cannot find the socket in 
reach. i crawl inder bus and explore hoping to find somewhere i can fit 
my ahdn around..&lt;yeh right..&gt; well, the socket is still there,. how do i 
get that peice of tin off? i cannot find my majic magnet ona stick, so 
that is not an option..ideas?


oh..and the rear engine hatch.

how do i get it to close?!?!? the latch appears to work ok, and the 
stickerplate appears at proper angle, but they do not connect..ideas?


thanks all...
