Subject: what's a 1991 cargo vanagon worth?

Hi all.  I was picking up some parts for my 85 van at the dealer the other
day, and I asked if they had any used vans.  There was one trade in.  A
vanagon cargo van. . . exactly what I was looking for.

It's a 1991, very plain, no radio even.
Bench seat across front.
150,000 KILOMETERS (I'm in Canada)
It looked good, but it was dark and snowing, I'm going to look at it again
in the daylight.  It was about -25 celcius but it started with a twist of
the key, and sounded pretty good.  I didn't climb under to check for any
coolant/oil leaks, it was backed up to a snowbank and it was dark and
snowing.  All was well until I asked the price. . . they want $9,995.00
(canadian)


What would it really be worth?  I still have to really take a good look at
it and take it for a ride of course, but that price seems really high.

Is there a place online where I can get used car prices? (canadian)

Thanks already and Happy Friday.
