Subject: Table in an 87 Wolfsburg
Date: Fri, 4 Apr 1997 13:17:12 -0800

Would someone with a Wolfsburg Ed or Carat Vanagon describe the latching
mechanism for the table?  I'm trying to figure out how to fix mine.  

My table at the very end, underneath, it has 2 pilot holes, diagonal
from each other &amp; spaced about 1&quot; from each other.  Looking at the
inside of the cabin where the table latches onto, there is a spring.
Attached to the spring is a plate with holes matching in distance from
each other as found on the table.

Now either the plate got stuck in that spring (I can see something solid
in the spring) or I'm missing another part which attaches to the table.
Any information would be appreciated.

Durby
87 Wolfs.
