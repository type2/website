Subject: VW Germany Web SIte

For all you web-surfers on the list, VW Germany has recently updated their web 
site. Still no vans :(, but they do offer a Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge Golf. 
Yes, this is an as-ordered-from-the-factory option! Most bizarre....

It's located at:     http://www.vw.iplus_dot_com/golf/index.html

Oh, and, brush up on your German before you check it out....
