More electrical load = more mechanical load.

A simple non-VW experiment that can be run if you have a small permanent 
magnet motor such as used to power battery powered toy cars.  These, when 
spun, will generate electricity.

1) With the motor disconnected from everything, spin the shaft
   with your fingers, and note how long the motor coasts.

2) Then, put an electrical load on the motor (generator) such as
   a flashlight lamp, or just short circuit the motor leads.
   Spin the motor again, and you'll find that the motor coasts
   far less, or not at all.
