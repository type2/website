Subject: Re: High Idle Speed Problem

In a message dated 95-12-06 08:35:30 EST, you write:

&gt;My questions are first, has anyone experienced something similar, and if so
&gt;did replacing the idle stabilizer valve fix the problem? Second, does it
&gt;sound
&gt;like the idle stebelizer valve could produce this problem? Bently is not too
&gt;much help (at least in this case) as it doesn't get down to basics and tell
&gt;you how the system works or how to trace down problems.\

Although the idle stabilizer can cause this problem, I would first check the
throttle valve switch located underneath the throttle body.  I had a idle
problem that occured recently in my 87' Syncro.  The problem ended up being a
defective throttle switch which could not be adjusted to get the correct
switching point gap.  The routine for checking and adjusting the switch can
be found in the Bently Manual.
