Subject: Built in vented furnace already in Westy

While tearing into the fridge in my Westy guts I had to remove the 
insulation and tin chimney around the propane/12/120v heater section of the 
fridge. Press and pull apart the tin, then pull out the fibreglass.

Once I fired the propane up I got lots of heat out.  Damn all cooling in the 
fridge mind you! This free furnace is already safely installed in your 
Westies folks, just prep it for winter. You won't need all that cooling 
power for the fridge anymore until spring.
          Adding a small fan to blow air over the heater section and out the 
top/side vents should be fine, it's been done by many, or bypass the 
thermostat on the cooling fins in back and use the existing fan, just aim it 
against the heater. I don't know about heat buildup behind the fridge 
against wall panelling, but the fan should help, plus the bottom of the 
fridge is open for airflow into the area.  This should take the chill off at 
least, no condensation probs, and it's free, just a bit awkward to setup 
twice annually.
         It's around freezing all day here now, so I'll try this in the 
drive this weekend and report back.   The BN-4 I was working on is not 
cooperating, everything works but it won't ignite, and I just got word that 
the pump for the real heater (Webasto) is $265.00, no go!
