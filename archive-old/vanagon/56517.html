Subject: Re: Lighter tyres for lighter steering?



&gt;I don't recommend a change in tires.

Lionel,

I agree with that Michael wrote, but when I changed from the reinforced car
tyres 185SR14 Reinforced 94R from Michelin to light truck tyres 185R14 C6PR
I recognised a very lighter steering. I could not do hair spin corners with
one arm and Michelin, but with the light truck I can.
