Subject: Re: 87 syncro won't start

     Did you loose compression?   YOu can tell just by the sound,
     as the motor cranks, if something bad happened hear...

     If that sounds OK replace the coil. I had A coil that was
     internally shorting. You could see the spark, but it wasn't
     enough to run my Vanagon. It shorted because of the wrong plugs.

&gt; I have checked sensors and switches that are shown in Bradley's Vanagon 
&gt; tech manual and they read correctly.  I can smell the fuel when I try to 
&gt; start it.  The spark and compression are good.
&gt; 
&gt; The one or two times that it tried to start, it pumped black fuel and 
&gt; white smoke out the tail pipe. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for ideas.
