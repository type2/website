Subject: &quot;water-based&quot; paint on EV's

I asked a friend who's an &quot;automotive enthusiast&quot; about the &quot;water-based
paint&quot; used on EVs. He sent this back as a response:

&gt;It sounds very similar to what BMW's gone to. They are water-borne paints,
&gt;not water-based. I can't tell you much about the difference other than that
&gt;the water-borne paint application process results in much less toxic stuff
&gt;going into the environment. Unfortunately, the resulting paint job sucks.
&gt;I've read about bird droppings eating through the paint in a matter of
&gt;hours. I'd recommend waxing (with real wax, not this &quot;polish&quot; crap) every
&gt;1-3 months.

So, use that wax folks. Johnson Paste, Mother's Gold, even Zymol if you're
up to it!
