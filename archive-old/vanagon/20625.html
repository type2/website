Subject: 1972 (engine almost in?!?!?) Westfalia

To all out there in Type II land!!  HELP!!!!

I have spent the last two nights trying to get the recently rebuilt (by me)
'73 1700cc into my '72 Westy.  After I finally got it in the engine
compartment (had to tak the carbs back off) i found out that when I raise the
engine to get to the input shaft, the cooling tin at the rear catches.  I
kinda gave up on the idea of installing with the seal in place.  

My questions:

1.  Is it possible to install a 1700 with the cooling tin in place?

2.  Is it REALLY possible to do Number 1(no bathroom jokes) with the seal on?

3.  Is Haynes pulling my leg by saying Numbers 1 and 2 are can be done?

If can be done, any hints?, words of wisdom?

I am awaiting your responses with baited breath.  (should have used Scope)
