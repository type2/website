Question, while waiting for my coppy of the Official Factory Repair
Manual, published by and affectionately referenced as, Bentley, I
discovered at the Hayses auto book display that their number 1029 covers
only the Vanagons.  Has anyone seen and inspected this one?  Would the
additon be worth considering?
  John
