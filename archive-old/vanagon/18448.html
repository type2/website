&gt; 	The implication of a cleaner acting as a 'primer' is that no
&gt; priming is actually happening, but cleaning helps. That's certainly

This is what I inherently believe but I'll share another perrspective.
I would normaly be inclined to believe that 1,1,1 Trichloroethane leaves
no residue, certainly doen't seem to on brakes, and I personally hate
the new enviro safe ones that don't flash evaporate, never seem to get
all the crap off, anyway back to the story.  Working on my masters I
have done a lot of experimental stress analysis using strain gages
bonded to metallic, fiberglass, and carbon fiber substrates using a
variety of adhesives, now the simplest adhesisve is nothing more than
super glue.  In fact the major strain gage manufacturer in this country
simply relabels Locktite super glue and sells it for use, now the
interesting part is this, before applying the superglue you do an
extensive, degreasing with 1,1,1 tri.. surface abrading, acid cleaning,
neutralizing, then right before you lay down the superglue you put
down a &quot;catalyst&quot; on the gage, if you don't the superglue will take
forever to set up and won't be worth crap, guess what that catalyst is,
yep 1,1,1 tri..., nothing else MSDS tells all.  Now you let it
evaporate fully before applying the glue, and no residue should be left,
the surface has already been totaly cleaned but without it bad results,
with it the superglue sets nearly instantly.  I've tried it when using
superglue for other uses and results are similar, it makes superglue
WORK and well, I figure it does much the same for Locktite, in fact for
Locktite I also often use cans are totaly pure 1,1,1 tri... that dad
got somewhere.  As a sidenote, recently the strain gage manufacturer
started sending a different &quot;catalyst&quot; that only works about half as
well as the previous one, due to problems shipping that evil 1,1,1
tri...  This one is simply reagent grade isopropyl alcohol.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm loosing my patience with Mill Supply. I've not yet recieved
&gt; 	I hear their stuff is good, but their customer service stinks!

Sorry to hear this, as one of the people to reccomend them earlier,
I can truly say I got good stuff with no problems but this is entirely
out of line.  If you paid with credit card as I imagine you did, I
would let the credit card sharks attack or would at least threaten
the company with such a possibility, it's really helped me rectify
some disputes with computer parts companies in the past, even with
just the threat of action.
