Subject: Re: Propane Heater &quot;Tundra Toaster&quot;

New option for those hungry cold-blooded reptiles on the list.

Just seen in a hardware store nearby, The Tundra Toaster, a high efficiency 
all stainless steel construction hot air 'source'  requires standard propane 
tank 20lb, and 12V ?amps with cable and spring clamps for direct battery 
attachment. Output 100C to 700C air, 10,000 to 30,000 BTU/hr at 160 cubic 
feet/min.  Straight outlet nozzle about 4&quot; square, with optional extensions 
for single burner hot air cooking  and one for engine block warmer. All in 
stainless steel. Looked brutally/elegantly simple and durable, mil-spec 
appearance.  The finest Soviet technology, made here in New Brunswick.  ULC 
approved, $400Cdn. Use in well ventilated conditions! 
        About the same size as older BN-4 gasheaters, might just fit into 
loafs etc. Lemme know if you want more info.  It is manual control, ie. 
valve/regulator/ignition-sparker/fan, not convenient!
