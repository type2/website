Subject: Re: Rain Made a Mess of my Bus :(

I just had the same leak in my Westy. The handle is where the water collects 
and where the drip appears. In my case, the skylight was cracked. It was 
pretty rotten from years of UV, so I chose not to repair it and sprung for a 
new one. Cost $139 from Euro-American RV Products (818.760.4214). Took about 
3 hours to remove/install.

&gt;Likewise I have a leak.  Rain seems to be coming in through the knob for the
&gt;skylight.  (You know, the rotating knob that opens and closes the skylight.)
&gt;
&gt;Any idea on how hard this would be to fix?  Anyone?
