Subject: RE: Generator access or engine access on Pre 72 buses???


&gt; I remember seeing a 71 bus one time that had the top of the engine
&gt;compartment or the bottom of the luggage comaprtment (whichever way you 
view
&gt;it) removable so that one could access the carb/air cleaner/generator from
&gt;above. this involves cutting the sheet metal out and making a pretty rigid
&gt;cover that replaces the hole.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else seen this and is it worth while doing????  It would let you
&gt;remove the fan cover &amp; generator without removing the engine or are all we 
VW
&gt;mechs meant to be able to remove the engine in 20 mins.


If you do this, you *will* be able to remove or replace your engine
in 20 minutes-- those top mounting bolts will be a cinch to get to,
as well as the fuel line and throttle cable-- everything a growing bus
needs!
