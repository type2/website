a van-list anecdote ....

was in palo alto last week on the company and stopped at the
palo alto duckpond for a look at the waterfowl

Saw a eurovan, two vangons, a loaf and an 'owl-face' (my version
of split) all packed into a little space. One of the bird watchig 
groups came up and drove off as i watched and didnt 'see' anything unusual

Here in upstate NY if you see an owl-face you honk and jump up and down
in surprise .....

wasnt anyone on the list was it ????? ;)
