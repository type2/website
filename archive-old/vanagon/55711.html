Subject: coolant leak

dear fellow vanagoon,

i have a 90 carat with what sounds like the identical problem!!!!!

after a drive there develops a puddle of coolant below the oil 
filter/oil cooler/water pump.  my pump was replaced by the dealer at 
50,000 miles and appears not to leak.  Coolant leak can be traced back 
to the oil cooler housing.  Thats as far as i have investigated. there 
is however two coolant hoses that feed the cooler?  or the cooler could 
leak or the water pump.  Let me know what you find......
