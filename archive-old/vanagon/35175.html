&gt; &gt;&gt;P.S.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The canvas is the child cot that goes over the front seat.  Just not a very
&gt; &gt;&gt;big child.

&gt;i often wondered what is the maximum amount of weight those cots will hold 
&gt;before those 3/4&quot; screws pull out of the door pillars and the cot 
 comes crashing 
&gt;to the ground??

I would regularly put 150 pounds worth of greyhounds on my cot.  Both 
 dogs sleep there fine and haven't put a foot through the canvas yet. I 
 replaced the material with a nylon mesh material from a awning company 
 because the regular canvas did stretch, but they slept on the original 
 fabric for years.
