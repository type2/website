Ok,
	
	Tonight I set the garage up for &quot;Winter Project Mode&quot; and pulled the
bus in.  It baaaaarrrreeeelllleeeeey fits (height-wise).

	I decided to attack the nose first.  I bought a couple more of those little
brillo things for the drill (I swear by those babies) and started grinding 
away the bondo.  It looks like the bus was hit and repaired at least twice,
and then hit once again for good measure.

	The sad/funny thing is, the bodywork underneath wasn't all that bad. 
Its the bondo that was piled on top that was awful.  In most places it was
3/4&quot; thick, over an ince deep in some others!  It seems they had tried to
re-sculpt the V in front, but they were way off.  Once I get the bondo
off, it actually won't be too much work to hammer/dolly/pick the metal
straight and to shrink a few spots.  I'll be a journeyman bodyman by the
time I'm done, though :)

	I went ahead and ordered inner rockers from Das Bulli Haus in Conneticut,
so I figure it'll be a couple of weeks before they get here.  That should
give me enough time to make good headway on the nose.  Then again, I could
just finish the nose and then go to the rockers.  

	Another trick I did.  We have a diaphram-type air-compressor my SO 
was using for airbrushing.  Its a 3/4 horse unit.  I'd used it for 
painting my last bus, and it was kinda difficult, and I used it to paint
a friend of mine's crotch rocket, and it worked well for that.  So what
I did was buy a 7 gallon air tank, took all of the fitting on and put on
new quick-connect air fittings.  So now I use it an an intermediate tank,
which really works well.  I makes my small air gun (4-6 CFM) work really
well, and it just barely keeps up with my big gun (9-11 CFM)  I even have
a guage on this apparatus (came with da tank) and now I can't wait to
paint something!  Any victims wanna &quot;volunteer?&quot;

Well, until next time...
