&gt;           for that price, you should throw in the 5th one (the spare)....
&gt;           don't you think?
&gt;
&gt;       Hey, Chris!
&gt;
&gt;       Lighten up! %)
&gt;
&gt;       At $13 per for lug nuts and $11 per for the caps, that's only $346 for
&gt;       the four wheels.
&gt;
&gt;       (Sorry, couldn't resist!  Been traumatized by dealer prices for too
&gt;       long!) &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I just think that dealers who sell their merchandise on this list should at
&gt; least pop in from time to time to give their advice on a mechanical problem,
&gt; say hi, or at least SOMETHING.
&gt; Afterall, the other parts dealers on this list do offer technical help and
&gt; such, and at least let people know they're participating listmembers (bus
&gt; depot/sherwood automotive , etc.) and I commend them for that, despite their
&gt; busy schedules.
&gt; But (and this is MY personal opinion) when a &quot;listmember&quot; who only pops in to
&gt; sell overpriced merchandise, and inquire about cheap westys for sale, BUT
&gt; never adds anything to the list otherwise, I think that is Very unfortunate,
&gt; and is obviously just using the list to their monetary advantage.
&gt; THIS IS MY PERSONAL  OPINION.
&gt; i dont want to start a flame war, It feel it was my perogative to voice my
&gt; opinion on this matter.
&gt; if you dont like anything i said, or disagree, delete it!
&gt; 'nuff said...
&gt;
&gt; chris
&gt; (who has sold a set of Carat alloys on the list before, for MUCH less, and
&gt; doesnt go unto &quot;unknown lurker&quot; status until I have something else to
&gt; sell...)


I've noticed that the &quot;dealers&quot; on the list do provide advice and are
careful about how they use the list.
