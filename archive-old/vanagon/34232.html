So /martha sez:
     
If all of us could put together a rig attaching a boat to our vans, but so that 
either could tow the other (the van towing the boat on land, and the boat 
somehow carrying the van on water, obviously), then we could literally go 
anywhere!  
     
     
Here's one with some historical precedent --
     
Back in about '04 there was a NY-Paris auto race. The orginal plans were to 
cross the Pacific at the Bering Strait, which is frozen over between Alaska and 
Russia in the winter. The route was changed to include a SFO-Kamchatka ferry 
instead of the Alaska leg, but communications being what they are, some 
participants didn't get the word and did the Bering thing anyway.
     
So by putting off the Inuvik trip a couple of months, the bus-avan could hang a 
left at the Yukon River and drive down the frozen Yukon down to the flatlands of
the Kuskoquim Delta. Hang a right on the Iditarod Trail and head to Nome. Cross 
the Strait and follow the Trans-Siberian railroad into Europe proper.
     
     
The fact that it's been done before shouldn't detract from the adventure!
     
Todd
