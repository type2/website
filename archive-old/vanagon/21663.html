A few days ago I put in a new starter for my 65 bus
and it started just great.  Then yesterday I tried to start
my bus and nothing happens.  The battery checked out fine.

So, I pulled out the starter once more.  Nothing unusual, so 
I reinstall it, turn the key, and the bus starts.  A few days
latter the bus won't start again.  

I take the starter out one more time and I notice little metal
flakes or shavings around the bushing(was probably there the 
previous time I took it out but didn't notice it).  The bushing 
is in good shape.  I reinstalled the starter again and the bus 
starts right up.

Anybody have a similar problem or a clue to what might be happening?
I have a 6 volt starter going into a 12 volt housing.

Also does anyone know of a reputable VW repair shop near the
Edmonds, WA area?

Your responses would be greatly appreciated!
