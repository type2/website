Yep, buses are certainly suspicious vehicles :) I lived in the Southeast US 
up until ten years ago when I moved to the Pacific Northwest. I used to get 
hassled by the law regularly, but now I only get hassled by customs (coming 
into US, not into Canada). What about all those dudes driving around Virgina 
with the fuzzy dice hanging from the rear view?

&gt;Be careful, as in some states, Virginia for instance, it is illegal to
&gt;have items hanging from the rear-view mirror, and generally impeding
&gt;your view of the road. It's one of those laws they use to stop
&gt;&quot;suspicious&quot; vehicles, like busses, and search them without consent,
&gt;since you've already broken the law...
