Subject: Another neat VANAGON/EUROVAN toy

So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than tone-down my driving style I bought a new toy for the
&gt; EV (which can be used in the less-able-to-be-spirited-driven-Vanagons)..

Hmf... less spirited...  I bet you don't get the misfiring-hesitation
fits in your EV like us Vanagon drivers do.  Make ya mess your pants,
it will!  ;)

&gt; 
&gt; Now when I go wizzing around corners (as opposed to urinating into
&gt; concomming traffic (see last week's discussion)) the groceries 
&gt; stay in place.

Wonder if they have a straight jacket for Ric when the Misses is 
driving?  ;p

;)
