Subject: re: Extra Gas

Hi Joel,

I called this Stnls Stl Brakes Corp and the fellow insisted they have
nothing to do w/ gas tanks or carriers of ANY type, spare, imported, etc,
etc, PERIOD.  Is there a certain person i should ask for?  I really do want
one of these tanks.  I did check w/ Griot's Garage, and they do have them,
but at $79.95+12.95 shpg.  Guess I'll do that if necessary.  TIA.

&gt;for anyone who is interested, here's the address of the folks who make
&gt;a little 1.5 gallon STEEL gas can that fits into the wheel of the spare
&gt;tire (i.e., the &quot;hole&quot; that's already in your spare tire). it ain't cheap,
&gt;but it is really solid and tough. comes with a latching lid (like those
&gt;big military cans) and a detachable steel/flexible pouring spout/neck.
