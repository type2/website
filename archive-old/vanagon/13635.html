Hi again, and time for anther cattle prod!  Below is what we have in the way 
of food sign up for Red Rock.  Some of you are &quot;lurking.&quot;  Pst *zap* = sign up!

Firstly, please BYOB, or whatever beverages you want to drink.  Feel free to 
bring things to share.  There are plans to get deep into margaritas and 
sangria, so ingredients for either are much appreciated.

Please tank up on gas before leaving civilization, and especially to bring 
lots of water!  Remember that we have no electricity, and no water on the 
immediate site (it's one mile away).

Friday night potluck: (please bring lots of pots to cook in)

     I'll bring whatever we need after everyone else signs up

If I have omissions or additions above to tend to, please call them to my 
attention!

On Saturday nite, I suggest that we just piecemeal it - how about we all bring 
things to go with pasta, and we can just sort of do it chaos and see what turns 
out - it might be artistic! - i.e. bring some sort of pasta, some sort of 
sauce, a side dish, and put everything out to share?  We did this at Big Sur, 
and together with leftovers, it worked out pretty well.  We &quot;sort&quot; of did this 
with lunch and breakfasts, too.  If in doubt, bring food, since I don't think 
there's a store too near by.  We will especially need stuff for breakfasts!  

Remember that I may have internet access problems this week, so you are 
welcome to use my alternate address (andrea2_at_aol_dot_com) if you encounter problems 
 

Thanks!
