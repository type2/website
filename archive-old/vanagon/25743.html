Subject: Re: 12 volt heaters?

&gt;I saw a tiny heater that plugged in the cigarette lighter (which isn't 
&gt;used for cigarettes by anybody I can think of). Anyone know if these 
&gt;work? Just to make a warm patch for the feet?
&gt;

I actually got one of those, intending to use it to help defrost
windsheilds, rear windows, or some such thing.  I have yet to use it though,
so will refrain from commenting.  Haven't even turned it on.  Maybe I will
and get back to you later.

Eug,
