Subject: Re: '71 bus rear brake drums

Jim,

Sometimes rust freezes the center of the drum where it slides over the axle
nut.  I just use a long screwdriver poking through one of the inspection
holes in the backing plate-- hammer the screwdriver so that it pushes the
drum off, rotating the drum so that you can work it off gradually.  Before
you reinstall the drum, clean off the rust where the drum contacts the stub
axle and apply a thin coat of anti-sieze.   Should work fine!

&gt;Hello all, This weekend I decided to remove my rear brake drums to 
&gt;have a look at my stuck adjusting stars.  I removed the rear wheel and
&gt;those two 11mm bolts on the drum.  The drum did not come off.  All the
&gt;books say that post August 1970 should just come off.  Mine was built 
&gt;in November so they should be that kind.  They don't look like the one
&gt;piece drums in the book.  So, am I missing something here?  There is 
&gt;no mention of any pulling or cranking to get these things off in Muir,
&gt;Bentley or Haynes.  I do have the mongo set of sockets to remove the 
&gt;axle nut but I didn't do that since I didn't have seals or anything 
&gt;for the bearings.  I did spray the thing with liquid wrench thinking 
&gt;it was just stuck in the center there.  No luck.  I finally applied 
&gt;tiny amounts of the stuff to the stars themselves and they moved!  
&gt;Tiny amounts.  Nice brakes.  I am still puzzled about the drum though.
