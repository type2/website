Subject: RE: water pump for 76 Westy

&gt; &gt;1) The water pump is getting juice but is dead. :-(
&gt; &gt;Anyone know where I can get a replacement?
&gt; &gt;Is it a hassle to install? (I'm a very MINOR mechanic).
&gt; 

One thing I would try before paying the man is to run the pump direct from 
the battery.  Because of resistance losses due to corrosion, etc., if the pump
is seized or gummed up or just dried out, it may not be getting enough juice 
to crank it over.  Before removing the pump hook up a couple of small jumper
lines hooked to jumper cables attached to your battery.  Run these small jumpers
to the input to the pump.  If it doesn't fire hooked up one way, reverse the leads
and try it again.  Just make sure you don't hook the jumpers to the pump switch
leads.  If the switch is on and you cross pos and neg you're going to have a 
REALLY BIG SPARK right in front of your face.  It should only take a day or
so for your vision to return, a little longer for your hair to uncurl 8).

I have to do this every Spring after the van's sat for the Winter.  If nothing
else you'll be sure that the pump's shot, since the RV shop probably won't check 
it for you, they're more interested in selling you a new one.

Good luck, let us know how it goes,
Jack
