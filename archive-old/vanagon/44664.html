Subject: Re:  ! Magnesium grinding

(back to fire basics) break the fire triangle, remove one leg -- air, heat
or fuel.  in this case only hope is cooling.

Magnesium fire reaction makes it's own O2 so it'll keep burning in water,
i.e you can't smother it but you can try to cool it.

navy training said extinguisher for Magnesium fire is purple k type.  locks
up the O2 thru some kinda chemical reaction.

otherwise, training was bucket of sand for small class 4 fires or use mondo
quantities of water to cool it and if possible push it over the side when
shipboard.

&gt;Magnesium is VERY dangerous when burning.  NEVER use water to put it out,
&gt;as it will cause the hydrogen and oxygen in the water to seperate and
&gt;explode.  Use a chemical fire extinguisher(sp?) to put out a magnesium fire.
