&gt; 	One question I have that this group might be able to answer is 
&gt; which model year Canadian spec Vanagon pickups can be legally imported
&gt; into this country? I remember a dealer in Idaho who was bringing low-milage
&gt; &quot;used&quot; ones over the border- they used to advertize in DB&amp;HVW but they
&gt; aren't in the current issue...

I would appreciate any answers to this query regarding importation of 
Canadian spec vehicles into the US. Thanks --
