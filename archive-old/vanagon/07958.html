Subject: For Sale: 87 VW Vanagon 

For Sale

My trusty 1987 VW Vanagon is needing some work and I don't have time to do
it. 

Features: fold down rear seat (nice for car camping), air conditioning
recently serviced works great, cruise control, AM/FM cassette. Engine runs
great.

Bugs: A couple small scrapes on the body, the auto tranny slips a little
bit in 2nd but it perfectly driveable. Brakes need some work- I replaced
the pads, shoes, master cylinder but still some funky problem. Total miles
are about 150K; I bought it at 90K and haven't needed to do any engine
work, don't know if previous owners replaced engine or if it is original,
but it runs great.

What's a reasonable price?
