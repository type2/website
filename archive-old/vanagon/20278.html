Subject: Re: proper oil temp

&gt;From: David Schwarze &lt;des_at_teleport_dot_com&gt;:
&gt;Your temps sound fine.  230 is about the upper limit you should consider
&gt;acceptable, although I know lots of people including myself that see
&gt;higher temps regularly.  This question has been asked quite often, is

I regularly see 250 or more when it's 115F and I'm climbing the mountain 
(the usual operating condition around these parts).  I run 20W50 and watch 
the oil pressure gauge.  The engine doesn't seem adversely affected.
