Subject: Re: 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels on the Syncro?

There are some rims and tires available to match Syncro and non-Syncro
needs. You can put 15&quot; or 16&quot; onto the Vangon without changing the total
diameter of the tires.

I sent a list of rims and tires to a listmember I don't remember. Because
I have no access to my files yet, please replay this rims-list to V_at_L.
