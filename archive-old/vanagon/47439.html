&gt;All '86 up GL's have a fold down middle seat and a sofa bed in back -

The &quot;Weekender Package&quot; (rear folding seat &amp; cushion) was an option on GL
models at least through 1989.  However, VW may have built all the GLs with
this option, making it kind of a &quot;mandatory option&quot;.  It did cost extra $
above the vans standard price.

&gt;All '87 up Wolfsburg / Carat models have 2 rear facing jump seats, fold out
&gt;table from left side,and sofa bed in back and alloy &quot;carat&quot; wheels-

Yes, but the alloy wheels were not part of the Wolfsburg Edition package in
1987.  They were a seperately ordered &amp; priced option.

&gt;A '85 up &quot;standard&quot; or non GL Westy is one with a jump seat behind the
&gt;driver, fold out table from left wall, pop top, cabinets overhead and in
left rear,
&gt;sofabed, but no stove, sink, fridge-

I'm not certain about 1985.  For 1986 &amp; 1987 this description is accurate
except they did come with a removeable 12VDC/120VAC refrigerator that sat
behind the front passenger seat. 1988 &amp; 1989 had no basic Camper model.  1990
&amp; 1991 had the &quot;Multivan&quot; model, more or less taking the place of the basic
Camper, but with many more standard features not relating to camping
capabilities.

&gt;A Multivan is essentially the same as a &quot;standard&quot; or non GL Westy,but with
2
&gt;rear facing jump seats??  Do the Multivans have cabinets in the back??

Yes.  For 1990 &amp; 1991 the Multivan model was similar to the earlier non-GL
Campers.  Multivans do have the rear storage cabinet, making the the rear end
of the bed a bit narrower, but the cabinet did not extend past the back of
the rear seat, yielding seating for 7.  Multivans did not come with the
12VDC/120VAC refrigerator of the earlier non-GL Campers.

&gt;So, uh, well is a &quot;weekender&quot; a &quot;basic camper model - or - a '86 up Vanagon
GL

I thought it was just the &quot;Package&quot; that meant the fold down rear seat and
cushion over the engine.  I think Joel has just corrected me in his recent
post on this same thread where he said: 
&gt;folks, the operative word here is &quot;package&quot;. VW used the term &quot;Weekender&quot;
&gt;at two different times, once as a &quot;package&quot; which was optional on the GL
&gt;models, and then as a &quot;model&quot; ...
&gt;
&gt;the Weekender Package is the fold-down rear bench seat. period. &lt;snip&gt;

Plus the cushion over the engine.

Joel continues:
&gt;the Weekender MODEL was a whole bus .... with a pop-up top. almost a camper
&gt;but without the camper interior. i think it had SOME of the cabinets but not
&gt;the whole camper cabinet setup.

I hadn't seen VW use the &quot;Weekender&quot; term for these models before, but it
sounds like Joel knows what he's talking about.
