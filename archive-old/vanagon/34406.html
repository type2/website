Subject: Noah, The Arc &amp; Gullwings

Forward thinkers:

&gt;From the January/February 1996 VW Autoist:

     &quot;The Frankfurt Auto Show revealed two concepts
     from Volkswagen.  With its new minivan (VW
     Sharan-Seat Alhambra) now in the showrooms, VW
     revealed its Noah.

     The small van features a single central door on
     either side; both driver and passengers enter in
     the middle of the vehicle.  The doors swing up
     into the roof, but they are not just giant
     gullwings...&quot;

It is described as 40 cubits by 60 cubits by 100 cubits, so
prepare for 40 days and 40 nights of rain.  OK, males to the
back, females to the front...everyone gets a seat on the
arc.

Yes, but does it FLOAT?
