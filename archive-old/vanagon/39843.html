&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'll have to fab and weld back in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My plan is to get as much low end torque as I possibly can, so we're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talking stroke here right?  How much can you do one of these lovelies?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Find the pieces or buy a 2 liter engine.  It will give more torque and power
&gt;&gt;&gt;without expensive modifications.  If mor is needed, go the corvair option.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I had a 140hp corvair engine in my buggy, ran great (when it ran)
&gt;&gt;I think finding someone to work on corvairs is even harder than
&gt;&gt;finding someone to work on VWs.  Corvairs have some of the same
&gt;&gt;problems that VWs have, and even more, so I wouldn't throw in
&gt;&gt;the towel on the type IV yet.  I think Dennis was right about
&gt;&gt;the 2.0 engine, just trying to find one is going to be tough
&gt;&gt;because these are the ones the type IV hot rodders want to use.
&gt;&gt;Different rods, crank and heads than the 1.7 and 1.8.

  Me again, I will try to elucidate if I can spell it. 
  The engine is already stripped to parts and case open, the 
  half I can see anyway. I hope to salvage the case but the crank
  is at best an exchange for my super whupem counter-balanced and 
  long strokin replacement. I will use the stock flywheel or heavier.
  I assumed I would put either the stock piston/cyl or a size larger.
  I don't want to go a hundred mile per hour, I want to go to the top
  of my 10% drive way with a 6000 lb load. BTW how steep is 10% in 
  real money? I have visions of having a single Weber progressive
  on top for air or maybe the 2 liter fuel injection setup. I got     both.
What is this data about all those parts being different?
  My neighbor has a dune buggy with a type 4 punched out to some 
  monsterous number which he doesn't even know. I'm asking can't you
  take a 1700 and make a 2500 or so out of it? The 1700 heads are all
  I can safely say are good. Is it not possible to punch them out a 
  few more millimeters. I have no idea what is even available.
  I can probably buy a 2 liter for less than I will spend on this one
  in the box and I may even throw a 1700 type 1 in while I build the 
  one in the box. Just talked to neighbor again, he says he had the
  stock cylinders bored out 0.104&quot; oversize and has no idea what 
  pistons they used. I shall have to check with the shop that built 
  the thing for him.     c'mon back now    west
