Larry reports, by way of Martha, that:

&gt;an old Subaru 4WD Wagon while on the Big Island of Hawaii. Of course we
broke
&gt;down on the infamous &quot;saddle road&quot; half way between Hilo and Kona, miles
from
&gt;nowhere, and later lost headlights while driving a dark back road from the

For those unfamiliar w/ Saddle Rd., it's akin to driving a 2hr. stretch of US
50 in 
the middle of Nevada, &quot;America's Loneliest Hwy.&quot;  The only &quot;services&quot; on the
road are an old army base and the UH observatory facility atop Mauna Kea 
(which can be reached by a Beetle, even though it's supposed to be a 4WD road
to the top).

Tales are told of hapless drivers picking up lone female hitchhikers who
utter
not a word (from the back seat no less), only to find that their guests have
vanished
w/o a trace when the driver checks in the rear view mirror.  This lone female
is 
supposedly the human incarnation of Madam Pele, the Hawaiian fire goddess....

So 'fess up, Larry &amp; Alice, you folks were illicitly transporting PORK
between
Hilo and Kona, weren't you?! (*)   ;-)

So much for our Friday (ghost) storytelling....now, back to our regular
mayhem.

(*) It is said that one must NOT have pork in one's possession while on
Saddle Rd.
Man, what IS it about pork??....
