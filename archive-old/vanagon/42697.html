Subject: '85 Weekender FS - Fair price??

Volks Folks,

In my search to find a Vanagon for the family I have come across a '85
Weekender.  It has 97K miles with the engine suposedly being rebuilt at 65K.
 It has a 4spd &amp; AC.  I haven't seen it yet but supposedly it has no major
dents or rust and a perfect interior.  The only problem is a bad A/C
compressor.  Asking price - $4150.  Does this sound fair??

I think I want a 2.1 with an automatic trans so if anyone is interested let
me know and I will forward the info.

-Dan
