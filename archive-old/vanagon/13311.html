&gt;Getting a Vanagon Westfalia Syncro GL sounds great, though I doubt I 
&gt;could find one.  Do the Syncros get lousy mileage?

Ron:

My 87 Westy Syncro gets 17 city, 20 highway.

There are always Syncro Westfalias for sale at dealerships here in 
Seattle, and private party sales appear in the paper about once a month. 

I was in the market for mine for about 18 months, and looked at appx 10 
Syncro Westphalias '87-'89, ranging from $15,000 to $26,000 (none of 
which - I now realize - could I afford) before I found it.

Someone on this list saw it for sale in the parking lot where they 
worked (Livermore Labs east of Oakland) on Monday morning and posted the 
info to the list. I saw the posting on Monday, talked the owner into 
waiting one day for me to look at it. Flew to California on Tuesday 
(thank you Southwest Air!), checked out the bus, had a mechanic check 
out the bus, paid my money, and started back towards Seattle - in the 
Westy Syncro - on Tuesday evening.

Why did I go to all that effort when I live in the Syncro capital of 
North America. List old timers may remember this, the 87 Westphalia 
Syncro with 46k miles was $8500.

After 10k of daily driving, only significant problems (so far!) has been 
a growling alternator. But then I don't drive like Derek!!!

Patience Syncro wannabes, they are out there!
