Subject:      automatic vs. manual transmission

Hello,

    I have found a nice 87 which I might purchase, but it has an automatic
transmission.  Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of the
automatic tranny ?

    As usual, thanks in advance for your help (you folks have been quite
helpful so far with information, and I appreciate it !)
