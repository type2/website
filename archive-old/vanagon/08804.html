&lt;------ Begin Included Message ------&gt;
Pardon the intrusion, but I've been sending subscribe
notices to the listserv_at_lenti, but get no response.
Could someone kindly give me a hand getting onto
this list?

&lt;------ End Included Message ------&gt;
After being kicked off recently and trying to
resubscribe, I can tell you...  the address you have
to send to is listproc_at_lenti, subtle distinction.
