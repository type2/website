&gt; What about mileage range?  When I fill up when the guage reaches the red

&gt; My question is how far can one go on a full tank?  I know that it has a 16
&gt; gallon capacity.  What's with the other 4 gallons.  It it a safety margin?

In the area of mileage range, it's alway frustrated me that the gauge at 
half is nowhere near half full.  I've decided that the top of the red 
area is about 12 gallons for me too and that half is about 6 gallons.
