&gt;
&gt;Vanamaniacs,
&gt;Does anyone know of any visible distinctions between the 1980 &amp; 
1981
&gt;Vanagons?  I mean if one were to see a 1980 or 81 driving down the 
street,
&gt;how could you tell which year it was?
&gt;
&gt;If you're reading this from the Type2 list, please email me 
directly,
&gt; since I
&gt;don't subscribe to that list.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

them!!
