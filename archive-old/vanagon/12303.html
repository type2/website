&gt; The thing is shaped sort of like cutting a 2&quot; wide cross section of a 
&gt; pipe with a grid in the middle - sold in a plastic bag type of display. 
&gt; We have made rice dinners, baked goods and such in it. Works just like it 
&gt; says in the included instructions and recipe book. 

OK, let's have a show of hands.....how many campers are the
boil-in-bag types, and how many of us keep a dutch oven under
the jump seat and charcoal under the bed?

Curious....
