Subject: Who paints 2-tone splitties in L.A. (South bay)?

Howzit crazies, after a terribly long hiatus from
this group, I'm now back in business.

I'm looking to have someone paint the top half only of
my '60 camper.  I'd prefer the usual characteristics:
experience, quality, reasonably priced, and close
to home (Redondo Beach, CA).

Thanks in advance for any recommendations you wizards
might have.
