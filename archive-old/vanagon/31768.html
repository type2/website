Ok,

	I've had a couple of replies on the 25hp vs 36hp
motor questions.  This much I knew going into it:

	* The 25/36 hp motors both have the generator stand
built into the right half of the case

	* The 25/26hp motors both have the fuel pump on
the left side of the case with the big funky tube up to
the carb.

	Now what else besides the case and the fuel pump
and a few cc's of displacement do they have?  Or is it just an
internal difference like the 1500 vs 1600?

	What is the displacement of the 25/36 horse motors?
something like 1100, isn't it?

Thom
