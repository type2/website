I've been wondering the same thing myself. I think the connection is
that they're both cutsy consumer goods, that are somewhat
anthropomorphic. 

Think of the splitty weeping for Jerry Garcia and the smiley Mac icon
welcoming you to Macintosh. &quot;I think I'll hug it and squeeze it and
call it George&quot; :)
