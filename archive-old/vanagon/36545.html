Subject: Mexican buses!


All,

I've been thinking (now,now David don't hurt yourself), since the busses
in Mexico are watercooled, do they suffer the same head gasket leaks
that the Vanagons get?  If not then why don't those that are looking at
replacing the heads of their Vanagons look in to ordering them from
VWoMex? If they do then the point is moot of course.

Just a thought,

Hi David,
   Someone I'm sure has already wrote you and posted their comments to 'the
List' But here is my 2 cents:  Mexican buse use 1.8L rabbit motors instead
of the flat-4 watercooled motor we have here in the states.  I've been the
Cancun and rented a bus for the day, what a nice bus.  The old style bubble
window mated with watercooling, what a concept!  A few of the options on
the mexican buses come form the Vanagon, IE: steering wheel, mirrors, seats
and radiator. I would love to have one.  The Salesman at the VW dearlership
in Cancun said the bugs go for about 7K and the bues were about 10k.  That
was almost 6 years ago.  Hope this answers your question. Take care.
