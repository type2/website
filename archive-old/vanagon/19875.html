&gt;&gt; A droplet of gasoline, however tiny, has a million times more mass than a
&gt;&gt; molecule of air.  The greater mass makes it difficult for the droplets to
&gt;&gt; negotiate the bends encountered on the way to the combustion chamber causing
&gt;&gt; a portion of the fuel charge to strike the walls of the intake manifold or
&gt;&gt; cylinder head casting and to form a film of liquid gasoline.  This process
&gt;&gt; occurs more easily if the surfaces are rough.
&gt;
&gt;I've heard this argument before, and also the opposite one (that a
&gt;smooth surface will cause the fuel to condense on the walls of the
&gt;intake manifold).  Some books say to leave the walls rough.  Does
&gt;anyone have some definitive proof (i.e. plotted HP/torque curves) that
&gt;one or the other is better?

Porting and polishing intake manifolds and heads are standard race
procedure, they can't all be wrong.
