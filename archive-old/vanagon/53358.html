Subject:       Re: Raceware Head Studs (coolant again...)

&gt;   I do want to add a couple of things;
&gt; 
&gt;   I've seen many Waterboxer engines torn down, many are rusty inside, and
&gt; the studs are pitted and rusty.  Many of the rusty studs are thin and about
&gt; ready to break.
&gt; 
&gt;   Today we tore down a motor, it looked like it was built a month ago, best
&gt; we can tell it was original from VW, it came out of a 85 7 passenger.  
&gt; 
&gt;   From our opinon this is a Prime example of a Well maintained Cooling
&gt; System.  Correct coolant used for the life of the engine, changed on regular
&gt; intervals.  This just goes to show us if we maintain the cooling systems and
&gt; use corect coolant Always, Maybe we won't need to spend BIG money on studs
&gt; like Raceware?
&gt; 

I hate to bring this up yet again, but I have yet to find ANY
coolant around here (Victoria, BC) which states that it IS phosphate
free, aside from the VW stuff, which is made by BASF in Canada. I
can't find the long life Prestone stuff, and Canadian Tire long life
doesn't say anything about phosphates. Same story with Zerex. So, is
the VW stuff the best choice? I don't mind paying $17 /gal. for VW
if it is the best, but at the moment, it appears to be the ONLY
choice for phosphate free AF. (My thinking is that a &quot;long life&quot; AND 
phosphate free AF would be better, but I can't find one!) Should I 
just stick with VW?

Sorry to bring this up again...

Merry Christmas All!
