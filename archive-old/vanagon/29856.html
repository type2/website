&gt;I wouldn't put too much weight on the Chrysler minivan
&gt;getting car of the year award.
&gt;
&gt;These &quot;awards&quot; are driven more by manufacturer/magazine politics
&gt;than actual quantitative measurement.


This is very true, I remember reading a Motor Trend magazine in which they
were doing a Car of the Year thing, well the Chevy Caprice won and also had
a 3 or 4 page ad in the magazine, rigged!
