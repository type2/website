&gt;think of an unreinforced 
&gt;tire as a clincher, and a reinforced tire as a sewup.
&gt; Which would you rather ride?

Would I have to get glue all over my hands mounting the reinforced? : )

Thanks for all the help on the frequently discussed tire topic. I have opted
for the Conti reinforced 205/65's. The guy down at Big O will warranty them
against all defects down to 1/8th of an inch of tread which seems like a good
deal. Along with free rotation and flat repair. The only downside is that
they are $91 a tire.... OUCH!!

Road testing them to Grand Junction (about 500 mi round trip) this weekend to
see the little sis graduate high school. 

Thanks again.....

Kevin
