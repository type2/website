&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;  I had an idea that I thought I might share with you.  . . .  [edited] 
&gt;Get one of those solar shower bags, the ones that holds about 5 gallons
&gt;of water, throw it on the top of the van and let it get warm. Put the
&gt;bag on the top of the open hatch, a voila, a shower.  What do you
&gt;think? 

Those shower bags work really nicely. You might not need the 5 gallon 
size. We have one and can do a &quot;quick rinse&quot; with just a gallon. They get 
really hot in direct sun!
