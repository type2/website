Subject: bumper sticker - tenative list

I have pasted together the suggestions that I recieved today as of about
1:30 EST this afternoon.  I'm sure that more suggestions are forthcoming,
and are certianly welcome by all of us.

I haven't tallied votes for favorites, but it seems that so far, people
have been favoring the following three ideas:

1. NETSURFEGNUGEN, or NETFEGNUGEN
2. a square sticker with a graphic, possibly ascii...
3. something to do with prunes

A flannel antennae flag is also favored over a sticker by some...

I like a bumper sticker because you can see it easier while in motion than
an antenna flag.  I like the idea of a sticker that says NETFEGNUGEN with a
little prune on wheels graphic...


&gt;- since we have all FOUR generations represented, the image should be maybe
&gt;  generic vw bus and NOT any specific generation.
&gt;- or all four represented.
&gt;- how bout a turtle/tortoise with wheels and a camper top? :)
&gt;- phrases:
&gt;     Byte my Asphalt?         :)
&gt;     Type II for YOU?
&gt;     Internet? You Bet!
&gt;     Busses by the Byte

&gt;I think taping the label from a can of prunes to the bumper or rear window
&gt; would be a marking that only a listmember would identify and is unlikely
&gt; to be copied by imposters of the conoscienti.

&gt;we could have the list name with each of the four generations
&gt;of Type 2s on each of the corner, and the list name in the center.

&gt;I vote for an ascii graphic of a breadloaf with some smartass ^h^h^h^h^h^h^h^h
&gt;witty saying to follow!   :-P

&gt; How about a bus driving around flannel, crisco
&gt;and prunes?  ;-)


&gt;how about everybody just put a big 1'x1' square of reflective tape on the
&gt;rear hatch? :)  sure it would look stoopid, but ...

&gt;Follow us, we love our bus
&gt; Ain't no fuss, just drive a bus
&gt;
&gt;or maybe just a big VW logo, with TYPE II beside it
&gt;and the list address
&gt; or 
&gt;&quot;I'm on the Bus List&quot;
&gt;with the address
&gt;
&gt;or
&gt;&quot;my bus made the honor roll at vanagon.lenti...&quot;
&gt;actually, I kinda like that one...

&gt;NETSURFEGNUGEN

&gt;what about a big vw logo with just the numeral 2 superimposed on top??

&gt;&quot;My C-student kicked the crap outa your honor student at ...&quot;  :)

&gt;I think a &quot;prune&quot; symbol (if any) would be the best

&gt;&quot;Pentiums...blindingly fast, but
&gt;in accurate....VW Vans....unnervingly slow...but accurate (?)

&gt;what about a bar-code label with the list address at the bottom?
&gt;in 3M reflective tape, of course. :)

&gt;My vote is for a piece of badly colored flannel (something vw-like)
&gt;with a prune silkscreened onto it.
