Subject: Re: 85 spedo repair

Reading all of the posts on the subject, I feel I got lucky with the 
solution to my problem.  I bought my diesel van with the speedo 
non-functional. One day, when I was feeling handy, I pulled it and 
investigated the problem.
In my haste, I busted the speedo &quot;hand&quot; off the face, which made me even 
more determined to solve the odometer problem.  Well with a few 
repositioninsg of the gears, I succeeded in making the odometer work-
for About a mile! :(. So now, without a speedometer OR odometer, I headed 
to the junkyard.  I almost fainted when the guy told me $200 for a used one.
A couple of weeks later I visited a junkyard away from home, and saw an 
85ish with an speedo intact. With little hope, as it was a huge 
computerized operation, I inquired as to the price. The guy wanted to 
sell me the whole cluster, but I complained that since I had a diesel it 
wouldn't be compatible.  He shrugged, looked at his busy manager, and 
said, &quot;10 bucks?&quot;!  needless to say I gave him the money and was on my way!
Now my speedometer goes up to 100mph, but my van still only goes 60!
the end.
