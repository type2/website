Subject: Re: |'81 vanagon turbo dream


I've seen various postings about alternate engines in a Vanagon... does it
really work?  Do these motors mate to the stock tranny?  Anybody got some
info on this?  Pros and cons?

Thanks,

&gt;hello, Jan, you could put a 4 cyl Jetta or 5 cyl Quantum (Passat, to you
&gt;guys) turbo diesel under the rear deck of your Extermely Lazy Auto..  :&lt;)
&gt;or you could go to a gas engine, and install a GTI 16 valve under there, or
&gt;do what they do in South Africa, and run a 5cyl audi gas (maybe even a turbo
&gt;5 cyl).....
&gt;and yes, most fire engines here in the US are red, but I've seen some
&gt;flourescent yellow ones too..  :&lt;)
