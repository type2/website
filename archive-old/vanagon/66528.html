Subject:      FS: front axle nuts for syncro

I got two pairs (one as spare) of front axle nuts for my syncro when I was
replacing the rotors. Turns out you don't have to remove these nuts to do
the rotors, so I'd like to sell one pair of these nuts. Any syncro owners
have a need for these? Please reply privately to raven_at_halcyon_dot_com.
