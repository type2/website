 Paul Smiley want to know if $2700 is a good deal for a '74 automatic:

 I'd say that price is WAY high. Here in the SF bay area, that bus would go
 for $1200-$1500 if it had a 4 speed. In a '74 you will have the early
 automatic -  penalty points for difficulty locating spare parts. Even a 
 '74 Westy &lt;very desireable bus, IMHO &lt;chuckle, chuckle&gt;&gt; would be less than
 $2700. 

 Also, I don't know what the emissions inspection situation is where you are,
 those webers will make it &quot;un-passable&quot;.

 I'd say that for $2700, you should be able to get a PRISTINE '77-'79 seven
 passenger bus or a clean, straight '76-79 westy.
 

 Hope this helps,

 Dave
