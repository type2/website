Subject: Re: Porche Fuche Alloys

&gt;Can anyone tell me if you can polish the whole of the fuche rim??
&gt;I've just bought some (5!!!) and the inserts are painted Pink!! - I'm 
&gt;wondering can I get them shot blasted and then polish the whole rim 
&gt;as I've heard varying stories...
&gt;Can anyone put me straight??? Cheers

I'm not 100% certain but it seems like i have seen these polished on a 
porsche that runs around town here. I'm not sure why you couldn't do it. 
Seems like it should work. Pink, huh! Not a real manly color. 

BTW what's the story on the '91 Mexibug/ I want one too.
