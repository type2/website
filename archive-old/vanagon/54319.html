Subject: Re: Redline:CV-2 High temp. CV grease

	Todd,
	Just my $0.02, but if the grease 'slung out' then either
the the boot or flange wasn't sealed tight or theres a big hole in
some otherwise solid metal. Seriously. The boot should be grease-tight.

	I'd be interested in your experience with adding STP- it
wouldn't be my first choice, but the 'moly loading' from adding
assembly lube sounds interesting for extreme conditions. 

	I put Redline in half my Rabbit's CVs and they were still
going fine 60-70K later when I sold it (209K total). The other two
were also going fine, with whatever it was I got from VW. Valvoline?

	Bill
