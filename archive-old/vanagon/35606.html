Subject: expectations from 67 sitting for 14 years

Howdy. After finally actually gaining posession of my 67, we are preparing to
dig into the restoration. I have 3 questions:
1. For the brakes, I have new flex lines, cylinders, and Master Cylinder. I
would also like to clean out the metal lines with compressed air. Should I just
remove all the lines, and blow it out dry, or should I add some fluid to the
closed system, to perhaps loosen up any crud inside, and then blow them out?
2. I am planning to tear down the engine to rebuild it, even though it runs
now.
  Other than checking for endplay, etc, will I have to/ should I split the case
anyway?
3. I am unsure of the transmission condition. I plan to change the oil in the
trans, as well as the reduction boxes. Anything else to do?
 Anyway, this is my first &quot;bringing back from beyond&quot; project, so it seems to
be rather a lot. I am hoping that wll will go well, though. Not as easy as
fixing things when they go wrong.
So, As I just sold my first '67, I am vehicle-less until this one is running.
( Although the '65 Single cab is still for sale!)
Anyway, thanks ...
