Subject: Papa Wants a Westie!!

Friends;
    My dad is desperately seeking a Westfalia!! He almost got an '88, but it
was sold out from under him. He was wrecked!! He'd like an '88 or '89. He's a
campin' freak like mahself, and it's breakin' my heart to see him without his
dream toy!! I told him I would post his cry on the Vanagon List to see if we
could hook him up! He has a '93 Honda Del Sol in primo condition that he'd
trade for the Westie. If not, he wants one anyways! He lives in Fremont,
Calif. Outside of S.F. and would be willing to travel (within reason) to sate
his appetite for said Westie!!! Please, help him out. He's just separated
from his wife and needs something to go his way here. He wants a Camper
something fierce!!! Lemme know, ok??? Thanks!--Rachel
