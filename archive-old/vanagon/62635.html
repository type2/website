Subject: Looking at 82 Westy Diesel: What is the Market

Volks,
Looking at 82 Diesel Westy:
1) Very clean; paint w/in one year
2) Odo at 102K but odo not working
3) Owner claims PO put an O-Haul on engine at 70K
4) No dents, rubber good
5) Owner tossed all Paper work on everything (even O-Haul!)
6) Says it will do 70mph all day at 35-38 mpg (he is an elderly gent
w/some PT Barnum in him)
Price is $3,000 but apparently soft for I know he's had it on the market
-at least- 8 weeks and no bites. No A/C (or worse the possibility
thereof) is a bad thing down here. Any ideas the market on this unit
down here in Hot/Humid SE Texas?
Regards
