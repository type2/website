&gt;I know someone out there has already done this. I have an '87 camper
&gt;and I'm try to remove the plastic lower portion of the dash right
&gt;in front of the stick and below the radio. It's a vertical section
&gt;of plastic that I want to mount drink holders to and possibly
&gt;my CB. I have the radio out and I've looked from above, below
&gt;and the sides but I can't find where it's attached. If anyone has
&gt;(successfully) removed this piece please tell me how you did it.


Thanks to everyone that responded this weekend. I got the piece off
and have started mounting two cupholders, a remote temperature
readout for the refrigerator and a cb.
