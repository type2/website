Subject: minor electrical problem

Hi Volks,
  Reciently I sent a post about having a weird electrical problem with my
dash pod on my '82 Vanagon.  Well, I hav another problem.  Receintly my
camper likes to stall out when I beep the horn.  I know it sounds funny but
it can be a pain in the butt.  Most of the time it will do this when I have
the headlights, wipers and blower on.  It has done it when nothing is on.
It will stall, and then it takes a second for it to start again.  I can
tell that the power is getting to the relay and coil because the hot pulse
relay shoots fuel into the engine and it tries to start. It will not for a
few seconds, then finally it will catch. (I'm I making sense) If anyone can
offer some help with this I would really appreicate it.  Thanks.
