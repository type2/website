&gt; A while back I looked at my Bentley to see about similar
&gt; work under the dash.  When the first step was to drill out
&gt; the breakaway bolts for the steering column, I figured it
&gt; would take something crucial for me to take that little
&gt; project on.  Good luck.
Naaaaaah. This  is a breeze.  I pulled mine off with a vice grips and 
they came off easily.  I replaced them with new ones that didn't break 
away.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, today I noticed the top ventilation control lever (for
&gt; &gt;the windshield) does nothing, and feels like it is attached
&gt; &gt;to nothing.  Can anyone shed a little light on these for a
&gt; &gt;still-Bentley-less, slightly chilled list mate?
You can view the path of the wires by looking under the dash and by 
taking the glove box out.  If you take the glove box out, I THINK you 
can see the one for the defrost.  They are held on by these weird clips 
that are hard to get on but appear to work well.  I took my dash off 
because I had some of that smell, and one of those clips sprang away....I 
ended up having to buy a new one from the dealer. I was able to get it 
back on even thought I had put the dash all back together.  The dash 
removal isn't hard, it's just tedious and sometimes painful because you 
scratch the backs of your hands trying to maneuver everything back into 
place.  I'm pretty confident that I could do it again, and I know I will 
have to.  I just don't want to spend over $100 for a friggin heather core.

&gt; This at least should be easy.  All the cables can be traced
&gt; without too much trouble after you remove the plastic heater
&gt; core cover, 
This may not be obvious, but the piece of &quot;dash&quot; right in front of the 
shift lever just slides right out after twisting some clips at each 
side.

Give me a call if you think about doing it, but buy a new core foirst.
I couldn't find a leak in mine.
