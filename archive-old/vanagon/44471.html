Subject: Meet at Winnipeg Folk Festival?


If anyone is interested, I and my family will be camping in &quot;Thrush&quot; 
bay during the Festival.  Drop by and say 'hi' at the TITAN RED 
'87 Westy with MN plates.  I'm the one with one eye brow and his 
knuckles draggin' on the ground.

and yes, i have broken my vow of silence....  it is good!
