Subject: '71 Bus: Extractor problems.

Hello,

I have been bugging (pun intended) everyone here with the tale
of woe that my '71 Bus is putting me through.

Story: '71 Bus. Muffler rusted out. I replaced it with a 
Bugpack single quiet-pack extractor set. I also have the
stock dist. and a Mexican (Brosal) 34-PICT-3. 

When the engine gets hot, and the car drives the enging, it
gives me a little backfire. Sometimes it does this when I step
on the clutch. Gets much worse when hot. The engine also seems to have
a hard time getting above 3000 RPM. This is fine for some city
driving, but I wanna go on the highway.

I have heard your comments about exaust leaks. I will go around again
and make sure all the gaskets are tight. Especially the
big triangle one. I could not get one heat exchanger off, so
I cant check that, but I will look at the others.
I used the asbestos-between-metal brand of gaskets and copper nuts.

Where can I get stock 34-pict-3 jets? I was told that they dont sell them
individually anymore, or if they are the same for the Brosal brand
over the Solex.

I am worried that the extractor is too big (I got it free) for a stock
engine, or that the Mexican carb will run too lean, melting down
the engine.

This is a pretty standard setup, from what I understand. Seems
like it should have been covered before.

Worried.
