&gt; 
&gt; The Koolatron is not as effective as the fridge in your campers,  It was 
&gt; made for people who do not have campers and will only keep stuff cool 
&gt; (KOOL) not cold.  I wouldn't trust one with milk for more than 12 hours.  
&gt; Also, they do not have plumbing, They have no moving parts at all.  Yes I 
&gt; didn't beleive it at first either but appearantly it used Some sort of 
&gt; wonderful new semiconductor to transfer heat from the inside out or vice 
&gt; versa.

Well, if you want something KOOL, then I would rather put up with a lack 
of cooling power, than the hassle of lighting the fridge. It just doesn't
seem to light until my thumb is good and bloody! EVERY TIME!

Anyone have any maintenance tips besides vacuming the spider webs?
