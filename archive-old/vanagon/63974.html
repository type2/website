Hi All,

While out camping in our '82 Westy this weekend my son and I managed to
break the water spout (the piece the water comes out of, I'm not sure if
I'm communicating well here or not) off of the pump down low where it
swings vertically.

It appears I could just epoxy it back on, but am wondering if this fix will
be such a pain that I should just spring for a new one?  And if so, where
is the best place to get one?
