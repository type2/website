Subject: Re: Coolant disappearing

&gt;My neighbour has a 1990 Westy (same as mine).  His coolant keeps
&gt;disappearing. No leaks on the floor and he could not find any around
&gt;the engine.  He replaced the water pump with a new one.  Since then,
&gt;has lost about a liter more. Would appreciate any help.

My '88 Vanagon GL (used to be known as &quot;Thirsty&quot;) had a similar
problem, leaking about a half cup of coolant every week or so. 
Neither I nor two dealers, nor an independant mechanic could find the
source of the leak.
 However, after having the engine pulled (by the independant that
 couldn't
find the leak) for a clutch replacement, the leak stopped completely. 
My guess is that there was a hose connection somewhere that, under
pressure, would dribble out a minute amount of coolant, that would
later evaporate before it could accumulate enough to drip.  The mech
couldn't find any traces of this, but he sure didn't replace any head
gaskets for free!

So, have your neighbor/friend check all hose connections and tighten
(not a bad idea to do regularly, anyway).
-------------
I almost bought an '83 which overheated before I closed the deal... 
After it was 'fixed' I watched it idle for 30 minutes and noticed a 
few small drops of coolant seep out of a hose fitting near the water 
pump, and promptly boil away on the hot metal casting - this could be 
what's happening here also...

still looking for a Westy...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
