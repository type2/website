&gt;&gt; A scanner?  Sorry, that fiche sized print is much too small to be scanned 
as
&gt;&gt; anything but litttle blobs by any scanner that I'm familiar with.
&gt;
&gt;I think you might be suprised.  Most modern flatbed scanners can do 600
&gt;dpi which is close to 10x1 magnification.  I was very impressed the
&gt;first time I scanned something at high res.


Uh, guys, I think that Bob intended to do blowups of these fiches before
scanning them. You know, sort of the way you magnify them before you read
them?

Gawd, I love Fridays...   :^)
