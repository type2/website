&gt;well ... we Americans wuz gonna try that a while back,   but the Texans got
&gt;all pissed off and started a filabuster in Congress. ;)
&gt;
&gt;so they snuck up north to Alaska when nobody was looking.


To bad for Texas, as we are crying all the way to the bank.  :-)
Last year evey man, woman, and child resident of Alaska got $968--our
portion of the oil revenues.  This year it is expected to top $1,000.  
(helps up pay for large heating oil bills  :-)   )

BTW, gas here is about $1.30 for cheapo unleaded.
