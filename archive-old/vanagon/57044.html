Subject: Re: Wondering about Westfalia table heights.

I've taken the front table off and bolted a four place drink holder in its
place.  It's small enough not to interfere with the cabinet doors.  The flat
table is stored under the rear seat for the times I need it.  Change over
time is about five minutes.  Ours is an 87 and the rear table swings around
and stores over the cabinet in front of the closet.
