Subject: RE: Should I Buy

        Tracey:
        
        1. The EVan is not a bus.  My daily driver is a 72 Westy that I 
        dearly love but my wife drives (and adores) our 93 EVan GL.  Both 
        have their unique appeal; we are fortunate enough to own one of 
        each.  Don't buy the EVan expecting it to be a  bus.  They are 
        two different catogories of vehicles.
        
        2. We just finished a 2200 mile trip to Kansas (Nickerson, near 
        Witchita) and back in the EVan.  The EVan performed flawlessly.  
        I enjoyed the creature comforts (AC, power steering/brakes, 
        comfortable ride.)  I would do the same trip in my 72 in a 
        heartbeat.  My wife would only if the temperature in purgatory 
        dropped below 32 degrees F.  (I have not yet calculated gas 
        mileage but it seemed reasonable considering the size of the 
        van.)
        
        3. The EVan has a much greater cargo area than other vans, 
        especially with the seats removed.  That was its biggest selling 
        point for us.
        
        4. It does have its quirks.  The steering wheel is at an odd 
        angle, some road noise at 55 mph (might be the tires) but none 
        are serious enough to convince me that this is not a good 
        vehicle.
        
        5. I do not know if that is a good price or not.  Check the &quot;Blue 
        Book&quot; at your bank or credit union for a better idea.  Some of 
        their prices are really strange but it will give you a place to 
        start.  If the price is right, then you get a lot of vehicle for 
        the money.
        
        Just my humble opinion.
