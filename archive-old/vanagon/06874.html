my choice comes down to two:
richard palmer's &quot;Transporter going is fun&quot; gets the nod as being particularly
appropriate to this bunch of crazies.

and pj kenny's 'i'm a car engine, too' struck me as the funniest. unhappily,
it is, for me, unpronouncable ... so it gets 2nd place kudos. ;)

you will, of course, notice that i disqualified all of my own entries out of
an enormous sense of fair play. :)
