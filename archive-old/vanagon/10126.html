Subject: RE: vdo speedometer repair: palo alto, ca

Just talked to very nice individual at the Palo Alto number joel gave for
speedometer repair.  He wants $80 to repair a Vanagon speedo over the counter,
and reacted to my lack of enthusiasm by saying it MIGHT be a LITTLE less if
as I indicated it was simply the one little broken gear.  He does not sell
parts.

Back to the wrecking yard.
