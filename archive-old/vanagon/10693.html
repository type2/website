IMHO, The most important thing to look for is rust.  I recently bought a 71 
westy with a siezed motor for $650.  I thought this was too much at the 
time, but every time I'm under it, I think it's a *bargin*.  She's got very 
little rust.
        About the engine, Type 4's are expensive to rebuild.  I am building 
a T2 engine right now, and money just don't go that far.  If you look in any 
VW rags, You'll see aroung $1200 for a T4 long block.  I'm in the $700 range 
right now, and thats just parts.
        Someone said that its worth what you'll be willing to pay.  True true. 
there my 2 cents.
