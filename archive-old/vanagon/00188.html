Subject:      Bus parts for sale

I sold a bunch of stuff on the first go-around, but then realized
that I had posted it during lots of _dot_edu folks' spring breaks.  So
here's what's left!

OK! Here's the list of bus parts that I have for sale.
First column is the part, second is the price (plus
shipping) and third is the year of bus that the part
will fit.  Some of the year spans I've had to guess
on- if it's a guess, it'll have a question mark.  I've
based the prices on two things- cost of the part new
and what Recycled Bugs charges for the used part.
Since I've always said their prices are high, mine are
much lower ;-)

As usual, all things are negotiable, but these prices
are already *really* low.  I'm also willing to work
out package deals.
