Subject: EVs all around!

Well, the local Vanagon owners must be moving up. I've seen 2 new EV
Campers over here in the past week. (I actually saw both vehicles sitting
in parking lots near each other or I would have thought it was the same one
since they're all white!) This in the land where there's at least one
Vanagon per block (my block has 2 Vanagons, 2 buses, and a beetle!) Is
there someone on the list from Bainbridge or Poulsbo who just picked one of
these up?
