&gt; I'm curious about the location of the gas heater heat outlet on a 68-71 
&gt; Campmobile.  I know those Eberspacher heaters are mounted on the driver's 
&gt; side of the engine compartment and there is some metal ducting bringing 
&gt; the heat into the van, but all the pictures I've seen are on passenger 
&gt; vans and not Westy's.  How was that ducting orignally routed through the 
&gt; storage area under the fold down bed?  Was a hole cut in the face of 
&gt; the storage area in-line with the ducting or was the camper equipment 
&gt; different on gas heater equipped models?

    I just sold an Eberspacher type BN4 I used to have in 
my 69 Westfalia (RIP) originally imported from Germany. It 
was mounted on the driver's side of the engine compartment. 
It did have an in-line duct like you describe that was 
rectangular at the firewall to circular at the hole cut in 
the drivers side of the storage area. It also had a piece of 
sheet metal mounted at the exit to deflect the heat across 
the front of the storage area.  Kept the van real warm too. 
On high it put out 4000 kcal/hr of heat ( equal to about 5 
hairdryers blowing on HI)
