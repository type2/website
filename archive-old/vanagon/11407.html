&gt;Hey, I gotta jump in here. This point intrigues me. I spent a
&gt;lot of time rebuilding the heater system for the 82. New flaps
&gt;were found (orange silicone disc inserts), all the heater
&gt;boxes were sealed and all the joints were sealed and a thermostat
&gt;was installed. In other words every effort was made to ensure
&gt;that the maximum possible heat could get from the rear to the
&gt;front. And you know what? The air IS hot and the flow is pretty
&gt;good


What did you seal your heater boxes with, if I may ask. I found an old
pair of boxes at a junkyard for a 78' bus, one is in perfect shape, the
other has the outer sheet metal shell rusted out in little rings about
1/4&quot; wide around the pipes coming in from the exaust manifold. I was
thinking maybe high temp silicone gasket, but didn't know if 700 degree
max temp rating was good enough, any other suggestions on sealing these
up?
