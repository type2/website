Subject: re: Moose  -Reply


&gt;Every year at the beginning of moose hitting season the local paper runs
&gt;their &quot;Give a moose a brake&quot; ad.  It is a picture of a chevyish van with a
&gt;moose laying across the front seats and all four legs sticking out the
&gt;front window.


Of course, if it had been a VW van, the proper caption would have been:

&quot;Give your trusty VW a brake&quot;.

Gotta keep the priorities straight...   :^)
