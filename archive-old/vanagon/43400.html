All:

Well, after a long hard decision I've decided to unload the 79 Bust.  It
could be on the road with a minor bit of effort but the title is sort of in
limbo so it'll probably end up as a parts bus.  Here's some details:

79 Bus, Automatic, 103K miles, 2.0L, starts great, runs well but no power in
gear.  After considerable time/effort and new parts I'm convinced that it
needs new lifters or needs the old ones rebuilt.  Cylinders 1 &amp; 3 have no
compression but after removing the #1 lifters and bleeding them the bus ran
much, much better.  All of the cooling parts are present and working
properly.  It could use some exhaust work but the cat is still there.  I
replaced the air flow meter, temp sensor 2, cold start valve, air injection
valve, fuel pressure sensor, fuel filter, vacuum lines, plugs, cap, rotor,
points, etc.  The only bummer is that the PPO gutted the EGR assembly.  Oh
yeah, the paint job sux.  It's Ocean Blue/White but severly oxidized and the
roof is starting to rust here and there.  Other than that, it's in good shape.

SO, why do I want to sell it?  Well, for starters, my former roommate bought
the bus from some guy and promptly signed the title.  He never titled it in
his name, just signed it.  So, I signed it.  No problem except I either need
his drivers license # to jointly title the bus (never happen) or I need him
to give me some notarized document granting me sole title to the bus (he's
in Florida and doesn't return many calls).  In other words, I've got a parts
bus.  Secondly, I already have a '67 bus that IS titled in my name and even
has plates/insurance.  It's almost done and I really want to direct all of
my attention to it.  Thirdly, my landlady/roommate has been really, really,
really good about me taking up 90% of the driveway but I now she secretly
wants to burn the bus down.

I'm willing to let it go for $450/obo.  I've got at least that much into the
bus with parts and such.  I've got way more into it if you count time but
that doesn't really count with these things ;).

I haven't publicly put it up for grabs but I just saw your message.  If
you're interested, let me know.  I'm in St. Mary's County, MD.  About 30
miles due South of Waldorf and probably 2 hours from Baltimore (About 35 min
from Dahlgren, VA).  If you want to get ahold of me I'm _at_ 301-373-3018.  If
there's no answer, call 301-904-2525 and leave me a message.

Later,

Bob J.
