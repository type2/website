Subject: Stop Fill Valve Rebuild

Ok, some of you have told me about rebuilding your auto stop-fill valves
with a rebuild kit from Mancester.  Question for you is, were your
valves made of brass or aluminum?  Manchester tells me that only the
brass ones are rebuildable and of course, mine is aluminum!  Help!  I
don't really want to replace the whole tank.
