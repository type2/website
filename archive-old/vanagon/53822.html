Subject: Re(2): Rough running when Hot

Bob,

Thanks for the wisdom on my rough running engine.  What happened to you sounds
exactly like what I am experiencing with my GL.  What I can't understand is how
adding a ground strap to the right side of the engine.  On yours, do you know
where the ground straps connects, from what to what.  How would this have an
effect on the FI computer.  Could the ground connection only not be made during
a warm engine?  Otherwise, these are the same behaviors that my engine is
performing.

Thanks,

Charles
