Subject: Vanagon Cooling System Testing

Tim:

There are two adapters necessary to use the Stant Cooling System 
Tester:  one is the Audi/Volkswagen System Adapter (Stant P/N 
12016 {old Stant P/N TA-16}) which will allow you to test the 
cooling system itself.  The other is the Audi/Volkswagen Cap
Adapter (Stant P/N 12017 {old Stant P/N TA-17}) which will allow
you to test the expansion chamber cap. 

The best prices I have found on these adapters has been an auto
parts house in Santa Clara California.  I have included a series 
of equivalent part numbers and venders below.
