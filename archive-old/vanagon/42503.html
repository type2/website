Subject: Re: oil tooo cool?

I recently put in an external oil cooler and replaced a piece of missing 
engine tin. The van was running around 230-250 oil temps. Temp guage is a 
VDO temp on the sump. But now with the oil cooler and replaced tin it is 
running around 160-190. Are these too cool? I am running 20w50 for oil. 
Should I try 10-40 or 10-30 to get the temps back up? Or should I be 
happy that the temps are so low. I have heard that too cool oil temps are 
hard on the engine.
