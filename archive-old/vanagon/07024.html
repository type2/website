&gt; I've found the best ant-theft device for busses is extensive rust, especially
&gt; in the rocker panels and roof.

If that isn't a problem, you could put an 8-track in your bus!

Eric Oster (ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu) could not think of anything
for this week...I own two busses, both mostly broken, one drivable.:)
(`66 with 8-track.)
