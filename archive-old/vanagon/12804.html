Subject: New cargo doors...


I visited my local boneyard in Potsdam NY and grabbed a 3-seater
(was $50 too much?) and was hoping to buy a set of NOS cargo doors
but unfortunately they were for the wrong year.  I've got a '66 
and the doors were for the pre-'62?  Anyway, they had the hinge near the 
top of the door.

He was asking 100 bucks a door.  They were still in factory primer.

If anyone is interested, let me know and I'll dig up his number.

ps: anyone know where I can get decent cargo doors for my '66?  The search continues...
