&gt;Hey all,
&gt;	OK, one more question.  On this bus I am looking at, the wipers
&gt;	work well on low speed but when you move the switch to high
&gt;	speed, the speed of the wipers does not change.  Does this
&gt;	indicate a worn wiper motor?  Is there any way to fix it or is
&gt;	replacement the way to go?  Is there anything else that might
&gt;	cause this, like too much friction in the wiper arm joints or
&gt;	something like that?  Any ideas?

Could be wiper motor or switch.  My experience has been motor.
