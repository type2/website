Subject: Re: Does air cond.=hp loss?

We use the the same A/C compressor on our helicopters (that I have in my
'86), it cools the electronics and the crew. The compressor runs off the
tail rotor drive shaft. When they went to this system for A/C the engineers
claimed that it would use 14 hp. I believe it, if I'm trying to get up to
speed I turn the sucker off, I need the power.
I can't see any reason to pull the belt unless the clutch was messed up.
