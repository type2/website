Subject: Re: 1971 original windshield wiper length


&gt;Maybe someone once replaced your wiper *arms* with too-long ones? maybe
&gt;from a later year bus??
&gt;
&gt;Actually, I guess I don't know how long the original blades were in 1971.
&gt;But 16&quot; ones seem fine now, on mine. They don't hit the rubber trim at the 
&gt;top, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Now if I just had about 10 degrees more rotation of the arms when running...
&gt;
The whole blade assembly is most assuredly not original on mine.  The 
drivers side hits the windshield seal, and the antenna :-(.  The arms look 
like the right ones.  Thanks.
