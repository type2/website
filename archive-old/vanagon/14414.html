Subject: Re: Out comes the motor...

I've never taken the two out of my '73 together, but the engine comes out OK 
as long as you have 1)a stable platform rolling under the engine, i.e. 
transmission jack or I built a 'custom' plywood thingie to bolt onto my 
roller jack, and 2)you raise the rear of the bus high enough.  Most of the 
time I use hydraulic bottle jacks under the rear jack mounting areas, on 2x4 
wood pieces and remove the left rear wheel, bringing it out at the wheel 
well area.  I know this sounds complicated, but I dislike having to raise it 
up *real* high!!!  Anyway, it's worked OK four times now.

&gt; I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
&gt; to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt; easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt; go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
&gt; and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt; it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Dave
