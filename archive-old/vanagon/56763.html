Subject: '82 Diesel Westy FS Milwaukee

Hi, All!

Friend of a friend has an '82 Diesel Westy FS.
Details (sketchy, I haven't got a real good look at it yet, so I'll only
comment on the things I know):

Stick shift
full camper package (stove, sink, 'fridge, pop-top)
Captians chairs in front
No Air Conditioning
Yellow
front table included!

58,000 miles  :-)

Overall condition appears good.

Anybody got any ideas/feelings about the diesel in particular? What
should I look for on it? 
He's asking $3250 for it. I'd sure like to have it, but I'd have to sell
mine first.
