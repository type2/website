&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How do you guys/gals do it?  A friend of mine really wants to sell me 
&gt;&gt; a '73 beetle,  it runs,  no rust,  a real beauty....plus two of its 
&gt;&gt; organ donors which can be left in the field where they currently reside.
&gt;&gt; The price?  $750.00 for all three...my wife is quite sceptical.  Is ity
&gt;&gt; jealously?  Could be the staggering price tag....Should I be sneaky?
&gt;&gt; I tried the Xmas thing already....I would love some input...
&gt;&gt; 


Remember, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission....
