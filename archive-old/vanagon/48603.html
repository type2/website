Subject: Re: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS


I am deeply saddened by Richard Palmer's post about the t-shirts and 
stickers and how he has to refrain from using the &quot;type2&quot; list name because 
the list administrator has &quot;plans&quot; for it.

Prior to the split, we were one big, if not to some, combersome mostly happy 
family. It seemed to me that the list name belonged to all of us, and the 
job of the list administrator was just that...one of administration...not 
one of ownership.

Since when did anyone grant ownership of the &quot;type2_at_primenet_dot_com&quot; name? I 
didn't realize that &quot;type2_at_primenet_dot_com&quot; was a piece of intellectual 
property that could be  &quot;owned&quot; by an individual. Gee...I guess I'll have to 
go looking in my copies of Computer Law Journal to see where that one got by 
me.

Sorry for the rant...but RIchard Palmer did yeoman service (much I 
understand out of his own pocket and generosity) on providing us with shirts 
and stickers....now it seet making venture.

Ric
