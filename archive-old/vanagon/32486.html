&gt;&gt;How about this approach to building a faster Vanagon:  take a Syncro,
&gt;&gt;replace trans with 2wd trans.  Replace center driveshaft with engine
&gt;&gt;and trans from a front-engine, rear-drive car, driving the front diff.
&gt;&gt;No modifications needed to the rear deck area, use the new engine cover
&gt;&gt;as a table, and no emissions hassles (unless you mention the other
&gt;&gt;engine).  You could even go hybrid, with an electric motor for the
&gt;&gt;front wheels and gas for the back.

&gt;Awwww... I was going to put the superconducting magnetic levitation
&gt;device there.
&gt;
&gt;Back to the drawing board.

No that spot is clearly for the Flux Capacitor!
