&gt; I built an awning with two wood dowels, a joiner, an 8x10 tarp, two spring clamps and two

I'm going to be doing something like this in the next week. What kind of
spring clamps did you use?  Where did you get them?  Can you tell me more
about the telescoping legs?  Were they expensive? How tough are they 
(will they survive two kids, or am I doomed?)

Mine is going to double as a room extender of sorts because I need to leave
the door open to sleep in it (it's not a camper -- it's just a vanagon). I
plan to sleep on the floor with our feet out the door.  I've built two steps
that go into the vanagon -- the top step is at floor level so It gives me a 6
foot bed to sleep on.  The kids will sleep in the back, and the gear will go
a in a tent (probably -- we're still thinking about how to do that. The 
step contraption folds into a neat box in which I will store the awning 
and tent and anything else that'll fit.
