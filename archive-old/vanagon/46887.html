Subject: Re: 84 Wasserboxer Coolant Level Light (U)

&gt; Continues to flash while running. Checked 14 point connector at panel, tightened 
&gt; nuts on gauge, replaced both sensors on thermo housing and sensor in bottle. 
&gt; Coolant level (Sierra) full. However, that side of panel is goofy, fuel gauge 
&gt; wanders and clock has stopped. Related? Becoming discouraged.

Sounds like a bad ground or possibly bad voltage regulator. Check 
battery voltage - should be 13.5-14v with engine running (I 
think-check Bentley). If it's higher the reg is probably gone. Also 
check all grounds leading to the panel, or supply an alternate ground 
to see if it helps.
