Subject: bumpers on Vanagon (81)

I just took off the rear bumper on my new (to me) 1981 westie.  It looks
like it was bumped just hard enough to flex it, and the chrome all flaked
off.  This is the only rusty spot on the vehicle.  Comes off easily, with 4
bolts, but you all knew that.

I want a better looking bumper, and I also need a trailer hitch to pull a
small aluminum boat.  On an American van this would be a no-brainer -- just
bolt on a shiny new step bumper, and head for the lake.

I see no reason why a bumper couldn't be made to bolt on the frame ends
just like the OEM, but with a place for a hitch in the middle, just like a
step bumper.  Does anybody make or sell something like this?  If not, why not?
