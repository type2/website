&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know if J.P. White of Sidmouth, England is still in business
&gt;&gt; making those wonderful Devon conversions?

&gt;Martin,

&gt;	As far as i know the company is still in business and still fits
&gt;	its interiors to the new vanagons.

Ben,

Glad Devon is still around. Have trouble with phrase
*new vanagons* though.  Is this old vanagons or new eurovans?
