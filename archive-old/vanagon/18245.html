Subject: Re: warranty/heads/gaskets

I just called VWoA 1-800-822-8987 #3 to ask what they will assist me in repairing
my westy's leaking head gasket problem. Got really pissed!!!

Talked to a VWoA lady, described the problem, told her my 83' westy has only
61k original miles. Told her I got a repair bill dated 1991 when it was at 46k
and had the sysmptom of the leaking gasket. She said sorry VWoA is not going
to help me. She said VWoA will not help my old car for such a problem.

I asked about the VWoA's settlement with FTC and it made no difference to her.
VWoA lady simply said no help... She is going to send me some forms and suggested
I can go ask BBB for help. I am going to call BBB next.

I wish to send this mail all over the world. I wish every one in the world knows
how they treated their customers for their own faults. A month a go I thought
of riding a golf, now this must be out of my mind...
