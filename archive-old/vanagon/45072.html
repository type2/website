Subject: Re: Dumb question re: windshield washer reservoir

&gt;        My suggestion is this: Go to a junkyard, find a rabbit or something
&gt;H20 cooled (and VW or Audi), pull the electric pump out of the washer
&gt;resiovoir, put it in your bus, add a toggle switch. Voila! You now no
&gt;longer need worry about the stupid air pressure. Works great on mine, even
&gt;when I forget to check air pressure...  ;-)

I was thumbing through a surplus supply catalog recently and found an air
powered motor that is used to operate windshield wipers (at 100psi).  I
don't know what type of rig this was for, but imagine if we had these
installed in conjunction with our little air pressure washers.  And we think
we have problems now....
