Subject: Re: Follow up on stuck in first gear problem in my '71

&gt;Test drove it and all is well! I'd still like to figure out how the hell what 
&gt;I found happened. Just doesn't seem possible...one of life's little mysteries.

No mysteries, Like I said, the faces on the selector are worn enough to let
it pull out of shafts if someone &quot;inexperienced&quot;  really reefs on the stick.
There is no gate on the stick to limit it's range, relies on parts you
described being within spec.  It WILL happen again, I'll guarantee it, this
was a warning, do not adjust your.... Most likely will happen in traffic
when you speed shift into second, (BTDT on my '71).  Get a new part handy
for installing next time, DON'T put in/fix a used one, not worth the $s
saved.  Tim Smith
