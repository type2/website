One more story for the Fram filter file...

2 summers ago, when my van was still diesel, It started blowing-off
(excuse the expression) filters when the engine was cold. Turned out to be
a stuck press. relief valve. So instead of dropping the pan and fixing it,
I decided to see if it would unstick itself and switched to Fram HP-1
filters. They are quite large and thick walled. They would stand the 150
psi generated at start-up. When I got the jetta engine installed, a
different filter was installed (can't remember what brand), it produced
oil prees. readings of; cold 60 idle, 90 max, warm 25 idle, 60 max. On my
first oil change I decided to switch to synthetic (Castrol 5W-50) and use
&quot;Autobahn&quot; filters. The filter was dark green and made in USA. Well this
change caused the oil press not to come up for up to 25 seconds after a
cold start. I was chagrined. So I switched oil, back to 10W-40 Penzoil, no
change. Then I switched filters, back to the Fram HP-1, problem went away.
Now I run with Fram HP-1 and Castrol Syntec 5W-50 with no probs, 90psi max
when cold, 60 psi max when hot, 25 psi min when hot.

Alistair, puzzled but sticking with what works
