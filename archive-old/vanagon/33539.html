&gt;I still can't figure out why when the starter is engaged the juice to the
&gt;coil goes out...only to return the moment I release the key and the starter 

&gt;stops. Is this the norm? I don't think so.
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I'm getting voltage to the switch and when the key is in the &quot;on&quot;
&gt; position I get 12volts to the coil.  It's just that when I turn the key to 

&gt; turn on the starter everything including most of the fuse panel go dead 
until
&gt; that starter is off...very odd.


The basic ignition switch has three terminals: a hot line to the battery,
a switched line to the coil, and a momentary contact to the starter.
The first one always has 12V, obviously. When the key is &quot;off&quot;, neither
of the other two do.

 When the key is turned to the first position, the
Ignition contact also has 12V. Lights on the dash light up, 12V goes
to the coil, and the engine is READY to run.

When you turn the key (against a spring) to the &quot;START&quot; position,
the ignition contact still has 12V, and now the starter contact also has
12V, as long as you hold the key against the spring. This cranks the
starter, the engine starts, and you release the key, letting it snap back
ti the first &quot;RUN&quot; position.


Well, many ignition switches nowadays, have a fourth contact. It acts
just like the first &quot;ignition&quot; contact, except when you turn the key to the
&quot;START&quot; postion, 12V is REMOVED from this fourth contact. The radio,
headlights, etc. are often wired to this fourth contact, so you can use them
when the key is turned on EXCEPT when you are actually trying to start
the engine.

Sounds like your switch has this fourth contact, and somehow the wire that
goes from the coil to the ignition switch, has mistakenly been put on this
fourth contact instead.

Turn the key off, get a meter with real long leads, and test the resistance
between the 12V terminal on your coil, and each of the contacts on the 
ignition
switch. If one shows zero ohms or real close to it (less than 2 ohms), 
that's
where your wire is connected. Next, check all the contacts on the switch
for 12V. With the key off, only one should have 12V. Turn the key to the 
first
position (&quot;RUN&quot;), and check to see which additional contact(s) now have 12V.

Then pull the center wire to your coil so the engine won't start, and turn 
the
key to the START position to crank the engine. WHile it's cranking, check 
the
contacts to see which additional one now has 12V, and which one used to
have 12V but now doesn't.

My guess is, the one that used to have 12V but doesn't while you're cranking
the engine, is the one your coil is connected to. Is it the one that showed
very low resistance to the coil earlier? If so, that's your problem.

The wire from the coil, should be attached to the contact that didn't have
12V when the key was off, but did have 12V in BOTH the other two positions.

Hope this helps...
