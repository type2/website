Tonya,

They wouldn't even fess up to HAVING a recall until I had had Joel's
receipt in from of me! After giving them that info and my VIN, they gave me
the name of the dealer and location who performed the recall and then I
called them to confirm it. Again, Joel's help was invaluable. However,
there were a couple recalls that HADN'T been done on my van which are now
being done. So at least I get some satisfaction. I also registered as the
new owner while I was on the phone with them. Funny, once I had Joel's
receipt, they were very friendly and helpful, really. The 2-3 previous
calls were like talking to a wall. The local dealer was (and is) , well...

Hope all this helps someone else.

tony

&gt; Tony,
&gt; 
&gt; How did you find out that the recall had already been done?  There were
&gt; a number on the 87's and VWoA claims that I have none outstanding. 
&gt; However, I'd feel better if I knew where and when they were actually
&gt; performed.
&gt; 
&gt; (and I guess Joel knows better than the NHST people--figures!)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
