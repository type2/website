Subject: cool lingo,help! &lt;rest assured&gt;

natasha!kombi_at_adobe.mv_dot_us.adobe_dot_com was scolding us &quot;Blue Meanies&quot; for being
smart-alecs in our (my?) response to the newbie loaf and splittie questions.

Rest assured that I responded privately with a very kind and clear
definition for each of the requested terms. I am a wise guy but I am also a
softie when it gets down to it. BUT Don't tell anyone!!! ;-)
