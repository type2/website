Subject: '97 Eurovan ($$$)

The January _VW Trends_ has a spy shot of the '97 Eurovan on p.56.
Basically it's the current van with some snazzing up of the front-end
design. It's supposed to have a 180h.p. (!) V-6.

Don't know why a devoted aircooler like myself would be interested in this
(180hp sounds downright _dangerous_ to me. . .) but I thought there might be
some front-engine watercooled afficiandoes in this list. . .with $25-30K to
throw around.  (But would you _dare_ paint it in psychedelic colors and put
a big smiley face on the front??)
