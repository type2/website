Subject: Re: (warm beer) For the Diesel freaks 

why do Brit's drink warm beer?
they have Lucas refrigerators.

i know, i know.  it's not friday.

btw,  our 85GL was a champ down to Ensenada and back Saturday.  great on
the road and it loves the tight parking and bumpy backstreets in towns
along the way.  do need to find a good cup holder tho' -- maybe i'll try
Walmart.  (duck! :-) )

cheers from insane diego,
dwight
