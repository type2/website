Dear Ivan:

Thanks for writing to us at Amazon_dot_com!  I've done a quick search of
our online catalog, using the &quot;Keyword&quot; search tool found on our Web
site.  Keyword searches reference elements of the title, the author's
last name and the subject categories that a book fits into.

Generally speaking, it is useful to set wide parameters for your
searches and progressively narrow them, so I entered just &quot;volkswagen
russek&quot; into the Keyword area and pressed the &quot;Search&quot; button.  I
didn't find the exact title you mentioned, but I did find the following:

-----
Volkswagen transporter, covering Volkswagen Transporter with 1200,
1500 and 1600 c.c.engines: repair guide
     Peter Russek / Unknown Binding
     (Hard to Find)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you return to our Web site and repeat this search, you should be
able to find these items in our catalog.  On the search results page,
simply click on a specific title to access more detailed information.
This search is also the first step in the ordering process, which is
done online.

Since Amazon_dot_com only deals in books available through American or
Canadian suppliers, there will always be some titles we cannot supply.
Please note that if a title is not in our catalog, we cannot obtain a
copy for you.

Thanks for shopping at Amazon_dot_com!

Best regards,

Katie D.
