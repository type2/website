Subject: generator light staying on

Hi all,
 I have a 67 bus, and the generator light &quot;flickers&quot; when at idle, and
 is a solid glow when under power... I replaced the belt (kinda worn)
 and replaced the regulator.. I also fixed the loose wire to the 
 wipers..  no change.....

 any ideas... I guess i am hoping its not the generator...

 thanks....
