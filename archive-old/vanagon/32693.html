        Two fellows in an early split drove up through North Dakota. After
a long and desperate hunt for that elusive mother load of spare parts, they
pulled up and asked a farmer working his field what was the name of the
next town.
        The fellow takes a long look, reaches into his pocket pulls out a
rag and gives his forehead a wipe: &quot;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan&quot; he says. The
one fellow looks at the other and says: &quot;See I told you we were lost, they
don't even speak english here.&quot;
