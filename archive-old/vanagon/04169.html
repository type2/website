Subject: Another newbie ('72 Westy)


Time to jump in and say hello...some of you might have seen my post to
usenet asking about engines for my '72.

If not, I just purchased the '72 Westy for $500. Only has 3 minor
dents, good interior (roof cot needs repair), great undercarriage, and
needs one new head (lost an exhaust valve seat). Red be the color.

I will be driving it about 80 miles Saturday morning from its current
home to mine - which is Felton, CA...way, way up in the Santa Cruz
mountains...let's hope I make it over hwy 17! Looks like I have to
take it slow, since there is the possibility of particles in one of
the piston chambers. Mileage is at 171K miles, or so I glean from
every scrap of paperwork that was saved.

[ any locals on this list what to go drive 880 and 17 *real* slow ]
[ with me Saturday morning? :) ]

Speaking of paper work, I have a &quot;nonoperational status receipt&quot; for
it from DMV. Could someone please inform me as to what this means for
me when I get it into running condition and wish to register it?

Other paperwork I have is this weird thing :

I won't even try to copy the green card that came with it! It's title
is &quot;Skraningarskirteini&quot;, dated on the same as the above.

Enough for now, just excited as a kid to have my VW finally!
