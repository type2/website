Subject: Westfalia Tent (Reconsidered)

 The response on my Westfalia tent has been beyond my wildest expectations,
 and has turned into a bidding war.  You'd think that Jackie Kennedy had
 spent a night in it!  ;)  I got long distance calls, and email from as
 far away as Newfoundland.
 Most responses have come from the east coast, and it appears that S&amp;H to
 there runs about $80  (~$35 for UPS and the balance for packing-a MailBoxes
 etc estimate)
 I also got one response from a previous seller who got $600 for a Vanagon
 tent.  His estimate was that the tent should go for at least $450.  I have no
 idea what it's really worth, but clearly, it is a good deal more than the
 $150 I was asking.
 I don't wish to appear greedy, but, in order to give everone the same
 opportunity, I have decided to open it up for bidding.  I will accept
 the best offer recieved by May 10.  Buyer is responsible for for S&amp;H
 Payment will be either by money order, certified check, or COD
 (buyer will be responsible for any COD charges.)
