Subject: VW Themes for Win 95 HELP
Date: Sat, 17 May 1997 10:04:21 -0400

I realize this isn't really the place for this but I figured if anyone knew
how to make the work I would find them here.  I downloaded the Volkswagen
Theme for Windows 95 by Jennifer Sarantites and tried to follow her
installation instructions.  I have the themes all in &quot;PLUS&quot; but I cant get
them into &quot;THEMES&quot; so they will run.  Any clue?  Please keep in mind you
are talking to a new Win 95 user and a person that usually &quot;points &amp;
shoots&quot; don't know too much technical stuff.

Thanks in advance
