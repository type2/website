----------
&gt; 
&gt; Higher octane gases don't inheriently produce more power or torqure, nor
will
&gt; they create any better gas mileage.  They just have the ability to resist
&gt; compression detonation beter than lower octane gases.  That said, it may
have
&gt; been some other characteristic of that particular batch of gas you used,
that
&gt; could have lowered it's available power - but not just the octane number.

	Mmmm, maybe. But, I've noticed the same behavior with other 
	machines.

	In the '70s I had a Maverick Grabber with a 302 &amp; stick. There was a clear
	difference in acceleration between, then, Mobil Reg. &amp; Premium. It would 
	run fine on Regular, but noticebly stronger with higher octane.
