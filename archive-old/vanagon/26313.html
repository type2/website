Subject: Need some help Eurovan MV

Well, I just finished my first moderate sized trip in the Eurovan.  We
took it from Jax, FL to Kill Devil Hills, NC and back. ;)  I only had three 
days, I don't think I'll try doing that again.  Didn't get in till
2:00 a.m. this morning, I had to be to work at 8:00. :(  It ran fine, but I
have notice a very deep kinda grindy noise coming from the right front. 
The noise is not constant, it tends to happen when making left turns, and
every now and then when under hard acceleration with some sort of drag. 
Like up a steep bridge, or through lots of standing water.  Does anybody
know what this could be?  I checked the CV Boots there intact and I'm not 
getting any clicking noises.

Also, while looking for this noise, I was unpleasantly surprised that a
boot that covers where the a steering rod goes into the power steering
unit, has completely ripped in half.  Has anybody had this happen, the van
has only 40,000 miles on it and I'm certain that this wasn't ripped two
months ago when I purchased it, because I checked it VERY closely. 
Any Ideas what it might cost to fix.

Sorry for the lousey parts descriptions, but I haven't received my 
Bentley's yet.

Thanks,
Trace Choulat
