Subject:       More cylinder numbering

Ok, so I now know the correct cylinder #s:
3   1
4   2

Aside from checking the distributor rotor, how does one check for TDC 
on #1, instead of #3, since both would give TDC on the crank, right? 
Do you have to remove a spark plug &amp; peer in, or is there a notch on 
one of the pulleys, or what?

The reason for this question is the following: If one sets TDC on the 
crank, then looks at the rotor, it is possible to assume that #3 is 
#1. Then by following the firing order 1-4-3-2 (which would actually 
be 3-2-1-4 since the starting point was off), one could derive the 
following cylinder numbering:
1   3
2   4

On an OHC engine, one can simply look at the cam to confirm TDC on 
#1, and one can derive #1 from the firing order. But such is not the 
case with a boxer engine. Am I totally confused and off base? 

The above scenario has just occurred (not to me), but I can see how I 
could have done the same, especially since I could not find any 
explicit mention of it in the Bentley.

So what's the secret?
