You are a good man Eddie, for helping that poor cat.  

I will be taking my two cats on the road with me for the cross country tour.  
Has anyone travelled with animals and if so what kind of advice can you give 
me?  Dick and Fritz have travelled in the Westfalia to Mich. and back and they 
did pretty well.  Dick loves the van and acts more like a dog (he likes to 
stick his head out the window and is completely comfortable roaming around any 
vehicle). Fritz, on the other hand, is a cat out and out. He handled the trip 
by curling up behind the driver's seat and never moving. He would rather stay 
at home and wait until we get back.  Problem is the Westy will be our only 
home for five months.  I did get some kitty valium for Fritz if things get to 
crazy for him.  I would love to hear from anyone who has experience travelling 
with pets.
