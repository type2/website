The price that I was quoted (in Milwaukee) was also around 40 dollars!!!


-------Quoted article---------

&gt;Can someone tell me a source for temp sensors that is close this price?  
&gt;I just called the dealer, and he wanted $40 for it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Gerry

&gt;Today I'm THRILLED to report that I was able to replace the coolant temperature
&gt;sensor and that ALL of the above symptoms disappeared.  Starts right up and runs
&gt;right, no surging, no stalling and accelerates smoothly.  AND I got all this for
&gt;the $11.32 the dealer charged me for the sensor (and a $1.68 for the new o-ring
&gt;seal).
