 The drums are supposed to come of seperately from the hubs. However, they
 get rusted together in the center where the hub locates the drum. I've 
 gotten them loose sometimes by heating the drum with a torch and lightly
 prying and tapping. There is nothing substantial to pry against so a lot 
 of force can't be applied. Sami suggested &lt;based on personal experience,
 perhaps?&gt; that a drift can be inserted through one of the adjustment holes
 and the drum tapped off from behind. The other alternative is to remove
 the 46mm nut, pull the hub and drum off together and press or hammer them
 apart off the car.

 To prevent the problem in the future, put a small amount of anti-seize 
 compound on that locating surface on the hub before re-assembly. Don't
 overdo it or the stuff will find it's way on to the brake shoes with 
 poor results.
