So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; Now I can tell you why I really bought a Westfalia - a new member of the
&gt; family! My daughter Madeline was born at 12:40 pm Thursday and she is
&gt; without a doubt  the best Christmas present ever...I hope the westy's
&gt; still around when she's old enough to drive....then again...  -- 
&gt; 
&gt; here, have a virtual cigar...
&gt; 

Congratulations David.  BTW, I'll bet reading/posting to the Vanagon
list sure beats pacing up and down waiting for the baby eh?  ;)
