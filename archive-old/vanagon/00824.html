Subject:      westfalia restoration articles from HOT VWs (1968-1979 buses)

ok, i have, in my collection library, the following episodes of &quot;Project
Westfalia&quot;, by HOT VWs.

Dec 1989, Part 3: Banging our bus' body into shape.       (body work)
Jan 1990, Part 4: Interior revival                        (seats and dash)
Feb 1990, Part 5: Finishing the interior on a high note   (stereo)
Mar 1990, Part 6: Suspension                              (sway bars, shocks)
Apr 1991, Project Westfalia update

and some semi-related articles:
Aug 1990, Minimizing Engine oil temperature
Mar 1991, Bus bumper straightening (let the pros do it)
Mar 1989, Poptop Revival (restoring the high-rise hardtop)
May 1989, Bus gauge installation (three gauges just below the radio slot)
???     , smoother slidedoor (one page of tips)
???     , CV Science (understanding and servicing constant velocity joints)

and some other junk about stuffing porsche 911 engines into buses. :)

so ... does anyone have copies of the parts 1 and 2 of Project Westfalia?
and is there a Part 7?
