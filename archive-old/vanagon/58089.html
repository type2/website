&lt;&lt; What is the &quot;Weekender&quot; variation 
 listed for the 86 and 87 model years?   And what is the latest on 
 introducing the VR6 EuroVans into the US?
 
 Next question.  Has anybody tried swapping the Audi 5-cylinder into a 
 Vanagon like the ones being produced in South Africa?
 
 Lastly, I see a lot of posts about clutch problems.  Let's hear from 
 some automatic owners.  As far as I know, the Volkswagen Transporter 
 automatic transmission hasn't changed much since it was first introduced 
 in 1973.   &gt;&gt;

-The term &quot;weekender &quot;  describes the fold down middle seat and sofabed in a
7 passenger NON-CAMPER vanagon. This option was first intro'd in '85, and
continued to '91.

-Helmut Ziedler put a Audi 5 into his '80 Vanagon Camper.

-The automatics in the wasserboxer Vanagons are FAR superior to those in the
'73-'79 buses.
