Subject: '91GL Not Dead!

As someone famous said, &quot;riddle me this&quot;.

The Vanagon decided to start without any problem this noon when the
temperature was a few degrees above freezing.

Obviously, water in the fuel...but (1) I pumped a half gallon of gas from
the T connection during freezing temperatures and (2) the injectors sprayed
in sub-freezing temperatures. I'll probably never know for sure.

The other &quot;event&quot; is that when I went to tow the '91 back to my warm garage
a couple of days ago, I discovered the right rear wheel was frozen. I
actually pulled the car 6' or so leaving a nice skid mark.

Today, with the warmer temperatures, I had to rock the car mightily several
times to break it free. Lesson is not to put the emergency brake on during
cold weather.

Many thanks to the fine folks who offered ideas about the problem. I wish
there were a clear answer but right now I will live with ice in the fuel
and some weird things going on to fool me.

Herb
