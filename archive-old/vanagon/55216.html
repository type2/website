&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; One of the few things I need for my recent purchase of an 86 Syncro GL is
&gt; a left front headlight.  I think 86-91 are the same.  Any good, used ones
&gt; out there for sale?
Dittos,
I need the exact same item. I will of course defer the first available
unit to Jon, but I do need the second. Driver side, rectangular lense
for 87GL.
