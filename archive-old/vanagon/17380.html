Subject: 2 liter split window

Lots of comments come and go about powering up/subsequent handling and 
stopping in older rigs.  Just a few thoughts about my 67 deluxe and 
changes it's been through.  I had the reduction boxes pulled and a super 
beetle tranny put in, then installed a 2007 cc low compression engine 
with dual Weber 40's, ported and polished heads, lots of bells and 
whistles.  Up front, new king pins and disc brakes, rebuilt center pin 
and rebuilt steering box.  Total bill $6000.  It has been a mixed 
blessing.  I took a family van and made it my personal screamer.  Even 
with a carefully tuned exhaust, it's much noisier.  On the freeway, it's 
second heaven....turns 75 mph all day long at low rpms and never heats 
up.  Stops well.  It can be done, but is obviously expensive.  I 
researched parts for a long time before making choices that would 
maximize the longevity of the set-up.  20,000 trouble-free miles later 
and I'm glad that I chose the parts I did, but still second-guess myself 
as to whether it was reasonable to tinker with the original set-up.  
Steve Phillips did the mechanical, he's an ace.
