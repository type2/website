Subject: Re: GEX (was Re: short-lived rebuilds)

        I second the positive opinions about GEX.  We bought a 
        replacement engine for my son's 72 Super Beetle from them a 
        little more than a year ago.  The engine was exactly as 
        advertised; sales personnel were knowledgeable and concerned with 
        the details of what we needed.  We have had no trouble with the 
        engine.  It cost about $100.00 more than the prices of other 
        places but it has proven to be worth it.  Most other sales people 
        sounded as though they could probably identify a VW if given 3 
        chances.
