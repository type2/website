Subject: Manifold drawings for turbo wannabees!
Date: Fri, 11 Jul 97 21:50:33 EDT

Helmut in Germany sent me the missing link in the Vanagon
TD puzzle. Now I have all three manifold style drawings on
my turbo WWW page:

The Vanagon TD manifold is indeed different from Golf/Jetta style. 
However, like the Quantum manifold it does position the turbo forward of 
the left motor mount to avoid interference. The Jetta/Golf manifold has 
the turbo centered between cylinder 2 and 3.
