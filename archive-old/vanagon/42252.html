Subject: Engine surge


Hello Everyone.                                                                 

I met an elderly gentleman today who owns an '82 Westfalia with only            
40,000 miles on the original engine. He still uses origional everything,        
including tires, but I digress.                                                 

We got to talking and he mentioned he had an ongoing service problem that was   
not resolved by his VW dealer. I told him about the great people on this        
newsgroup who share their experience, so he asked me to relay this question.    

Occasionally, specifically when he is running at higher rpms, the engine seems  
to surge or kick out. The engine doesn't actually stop as he normally puts the  
van in neutral and the engines purrs along. He says it is as if someone had     
applied the brakes as he was accelerating.                                      

This problems usually occurs at highway speeds or when he is accelerating       
quickly in first gear. Any ideas or comments.                                   

Thanks                                                                          
Paul
