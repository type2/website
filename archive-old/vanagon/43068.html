&gt;&gt;Are there any other Vanagon repair manuals than just the Bentley manual?
&gt;&gt;Did Haynes ever publish one?  Has anyone every spent the $85 (per model)
&gt;&gt;for the microfiche that VWoA sells?  What do the dealers use?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For my bubble window I have the Bentley, the Haynes and a Chilton. I also
&gt;have all three for the Vanagon. Not sure what the dealers use.

Please note that the Haynes &amp; Chilton books DO NOT cover the Vanagons with
the wasserboxer engines.
