Don't know if this will help with any confusion(maybe create more) on the 
year vs.
application question but I have several Bosch catalogs, mainly electrical 
and ignition
parts, and they seem to list models by a combination of year of production 
and model year.  The ignition parts book lists my '69 BMW(model yr.) parts 
under '68
(year of production).  Don't know if this helps.  By the way if anyone is 
interested in part numbers for ignition and/or electrical parts let me know. 
 The most recent
catalog I have is '90.
