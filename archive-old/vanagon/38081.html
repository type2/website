Subject: New VW TV ad

Dunno wether we all get world kulture and adverts but over in England the
latest VW ad on the tele is quitw amazing! Hard to describe but sort of done
like an X Files docu - drama mixed with ET. Scene...American midwest (?) at
night, desert, hills in background, lonely gas station...old couple tell their
&quot;story&quot; to the camera (lovely midwest drawl) about this strange light. Cut
during their narration to a light in the distance seeming to float getting
closer. Old couple totally bemused by their &quot;encounter&quot; - this thing wizzes by
their gas station without stopping. All they can remember is this funnny sort
of little symbol...(you have to hear the accents for the last bit)...&quot;a sorta
vee ... yeah a sorta vee dubblyuh..&quot;
Going down a storm over here - already its a catch phrase with authentic
drawl! First time I saw it I thought wow, what movie is this trailing..must
catch it!
Only problem is the kids at school take every opportunity to use the phrase in
class...&quot;What do you think Del&quot;  &quot;Well sir...is it a vee dubblyuh&quot; Snigger
snigger.
Still, they have learned SOMETHING i spose! :)  

PS Our Bus comes out of the paint shop tomorrow...now that really will
gobsmack them!                  Dave
