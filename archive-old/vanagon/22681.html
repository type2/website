Subject: Fiche Viewing

I just got a parts fiche from a fellow listie and just had to look at it
before I could bring it into work and see it with a viewer here.  I think a
minute about how to view this fiche and then it strikes me.  A &quot;microscope&quot;!
  The &quot;microscope&quot; I have works pretty well.  The reason I use the &quot; &quot; around
microscope is that the scope I used is a little plastic handheld unit from
Radio Shack - hardly a real microscope. 
 
This little unit really worked well.  It has a little AA battery powered ligh
inside and is small enough to be able to take it and the fiche with you on a
road trip.  Cost is $10 regularly &amp; $6 on sale.  So just think of it as a $6
portable fiche viewer!
