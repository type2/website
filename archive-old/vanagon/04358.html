 Some people will
&gt;want the confidence that comes from having the dealer do the work, especially
&gt;when brakes are involved.  

I wouldn't let any dealer anywhere near the brakes on a car of mine. In fact 
I wouldn't trust most of them to find thier own arse with a magnifying 
glass. Look at some of the stories on this list of incompetent mechanics 
(e.g. Thom's recent BMW nightmare), and the complete bollocks that most of 
them talk ('Oh yeah, they all do that'). I take the view - If you want 
something done properly, do it yourself. Brakes are not complicated and you 
are likely to take more time and care over the job than anyone else is (and 
learn and save money to boot). OK, so there are a lot of good, honest 
mechanics around, but there are an awful lot more thieving dickheads. If you 
don't already have a tame, friendly mechanic, why put your life in someone 
else's hands. 
(This isn't a flame, B, just my opinion on fixing things yourself)
