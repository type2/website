Forget the little light in the corner of the fridge, just pump your heart
out, click, click, hold button in, pray, click, pump, go outside and listen
to the vent, pump, click, pray.......sooner or later it WILL work.  Just
make sure you're on a level surface and give it time after you try to light
it before you decide it isn't lit.  Ours took about 10 or so minutes before
the temperature started to go down, we were watching it with one of those
indoor/outdoor digital thermometer thingys from Radio Shack.

 I was just informed today by a RV dealer that you can permenently fry the
coil in a Dometic if you run it on an angle.  It apparently traps the
amonia in a coil an causes something (?) to melt down, ugly scene!

Maybe you should give it a try on A/C first.  If you don't suceed right
away you will have earned the right to join an elite group of
&quot;Farfrumkulen&quot; (coined by Kelly Bauman) fellow VW owners.  

Good luck, warm suds are good too!
