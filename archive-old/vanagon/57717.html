I tried to send this directly to you but Eudora won't let me.  The address I
used is jarnott_at_ordenet_dot_org

Thanks for the offer of your ECU.  Several questions. Numbers on mine are
0280 000 501
025 906 021

Are yours and mine the same?
Now the tough questions:  How do I know yours is good?  How would you send
it to me?  How would I pay for it?
