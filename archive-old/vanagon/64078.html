Subject: '85 Westi swaying

Hello out there...

At highway speeds my '85 Westy vanagon seems to be swaying more than feels
right.  The load we were carrying included 3 adults, 1 child, lots of
camping stuff inside, on the upper luggage rack and in a light utility
trailer.  Sometimes the amount of sway was scarry on curves when going
between 65 and 70 mph.  My questions are:

1.  Is this normal or seem about right?

2.  Can I beef up my shocks to improve the situation?

Thanks,

Ivan

p.s., I have brand new tires if that's a piece of the puzzle.
