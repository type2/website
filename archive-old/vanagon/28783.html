Subject: SF Bay area question (little VW content)

to All on the left side of the U.S.--

My family and I are visiting 'da relatives in Sacramento round abouts 
Xmas time and was wondering if there were any list members that had 
some lodging recommendations on the ocean front for 1, 2 , or 3 days. 
 We are probably looking for a house to rent as it would be about 9 
or 10 mild-mannered, midwest-type folk in various stages of mental 
and physical development/deterioration.  Bodega Bay area would be 
really nice (or &quot;just fine, then&quot; as we say).

Also (obligatory VW content), if there is a pizza/beer/magnesium 
smoker going on about then, I'd *really* like to sneak away for a 
while from the chaos...
