How does this work?

I don't have the Bentley manual (OK, I feel appropriately ashamed), and I am
looking at the thermostat flaps for my '82 air-cooled engine as I put it back
together. 

The flaps look something like this:

    --------                      --------
   | left   |                    | right  |
   | flap   |           thermo   |  flap  |
   |      | |   shaft   cable v  |        |
          --------------------+-----------
   |        |____________________|        |
   |            fan housing               |
   |______________________________________|

Under the left flap is the oil cooler, the left flap seems to do sort of a
double duty.  The right flap is only to close off the air to the right
cylinders.  Also, the right flap is connected directly to the main shaft which
the thermstat cable hooks to, while the left flap has its own shaft and is
connected by a linkage to the main shaft.

When the engine is cold, it appears that the right flap is almost closed
(down), and the left flap is up, exposing the oil cooler, while shutting some
of the air off to the cylinders.  When things heat up and the thermo cable
gets longer, the right flap goes up (opening) and the left flap goes down,
opening the air flow up to the cylinders, while CLOSING OFF THE OPENING TO THE
OIL COOLER!  This bothers me immensely.  Is there air flow here that is not
obvious? Does the air flow to the oil cooler actually decrease at high temp?
This is really bugging me. Somebody straighten me out please!
