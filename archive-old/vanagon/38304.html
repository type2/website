Subject: leaky oil pressure switch
Date: Mon, 25 Mar 96 14:31:29 EST

Hey all,
After not having anything to post for a while, I discovered something
today.  The oil pressure switch on my '78 is leaking oil.  The oil is
leaking from the top of the switch body, not from the threads.  There is
a narrow cylinder with the push-on wire connection on top of the switch
and then below that is the main switch body.  The oil is leaking from
the seam between the narrow cylinder and the switch body.  So, I will
naturally have to replace the switch.

It looks like it will be a MAJOR pain to get that thing out.  There is
almost zero clearance between switch and tin to get a socket on it.
Does anybody have an easy way to get this thing out and get a new one
in?  

I like the location of the type I switch, right there where you can get
to it.  This one looks like it will be tricky.

Any tips and tricks will be greatly appreciated,
Sean
