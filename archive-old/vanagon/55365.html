Subject: Family Camper

Hi all,
	I sent a message asking for advice on a particular VW I'm looking 
at (86GL Vanagon,2.1L,110k,rebuilteng,7seater,foldbed,$3900).  Thought 
I'd relate what we decided on for camping.  
	If you recall, I was interested in a full camper with pop top and 
would seat 7.  Basically the answer was--Not all in one.  At least not by 
VW.  You can get close.  But seating 6 with the full camper is all you 
can get.  By the way, this is all info I got from MANY MANY people from 
this group.  Thanks again to everyone.
	I got one letter from Norman Leong (thank you!) who turned me 
onto a place in San Jose called Country Home Campers.  Basically it is a 
custom camper place and he specializes in VWs, Ford Aerostars, and Chevy 
Astrovan conversions.  He puts on:

			Pop top
			Fridge/sink/stove combo
			Tables
			Any cabinetry you desire
			Curtains and similar amenities
			Lots of other extras (luggage racks, awnings, 
tents that attach to the rear for camping, pottys, tinting, TV, etc. etc. 
--really just about anything you want!)

	2 neat things:
	First neat thing is the sink/stove/fridge is made so it doesn't 
block any of that rear big seat, so you can sit 3 easily back there.  He 
is gonna put in another seat belt for us so you can even seat 4 (I 
couldn't believe how big that seat was) on the rear seat in a pinch.  
It's actually not that big of a pinch either.  We will also have one of 
those rear facing seats behind the front passenger.  That makes 7! Yeah!
	Second neat thing is that, unlike the Vanagon camper models, this 
sink/stove/fridge unit is completely removable--fairly easily (It gets 
easier the more you do it).  We will also have the bench seat that can go 
back (of course, pull the rear facing seat out) in when the &quot;camper unit&quot; 
is out so we can seat 7 comfortably and (with that 4th seatbelt across 
the rear seat) 8 in a pinch.

	Anyway, that's it.  On solution for a family who wants a minivan 
some of the time and a camper some of the time.  I got a lot of mail from 
people who had a similar interest so I thought I'd post to the whole 
group.  The prices, of course, vary upon what you're gonna put in your 
particular custom build, but I'm probably gonna pay around 7 - 8K. With a 
4K vehicle, I don't see that as being unreasonable since I get exactly 
what I want.  And it sure isn't $37,000 for the new EV.

If I can help in anyway, please E-mail me.  I am very grateful for all 
the extensive advice I have gotten from this group.

Thanks all...Thad
