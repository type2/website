 Sorry if some of this has been discussed, but of course I wasn't paying
attention at the time. I have a couple questions about gas tanks.

1. How big (capacity) are late model tanks?

2. How big are vanagon tanks?

3. What's the biggest tank you can fit in a '67 bus?

4. when changing gas tanks, you must also put in the new sending unit
along with the new tank, correct? 
 
thanks.  Answers, and any other pertinent facts I'm forgetting
appreciated.

Richard, tired of filling up so often.
