Hi Volkspeople!

 Wishing y'all a happy long weekend! Now, to the point.
I'm going through the procedure of acquiring a 1956 Kombi, 36HP engine. Will
I have extreme difficulties getting parts for this vehicle? The idea is to
restore it to original mint condition. Of the mail order companies, which
ones are, to the majority of the list, the best ones not only about quality
of parts but quality of service?

 I sincerely appreciate your comments/help. TIA!

Wilma and Raul
