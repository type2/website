On a completely unrelated trip that took me through a nearby
town, I pulled into a McDonald's and there in the parking lot
were (2) beautiful Things (one orange, one yellow) and a totally
awesome 1950 bug that was, as far as I can tell, pristine in
every way.  Walking into the restaurant it took about 15 seconds
to tell who the right people to talk to were.

Maybe next year...
