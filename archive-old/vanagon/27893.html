Subject: fuel pressure test

I've used my compression tester in the past with no ill effects to it.
However, it really is not accurate enough. You need a gauge that will
measure 0-100 lbs. or less. Professional tool companies like &quot;Mac&quot; or
&quot;Snap-On&quot; should have them. If you see one of their trucks, stop them, they
will be more than happy to sell you a tool. Their tools are very nice, but
pricey. Also just look around at flea markets and garage sales, discount
tool dealers, etc.
