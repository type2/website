Subject: The '59 Bug

        Won't someone please buy this car?

        Its a '59 bug, located in Galt, CA, just south of Sacramento.  

Its straight, pretty clean, although it has been sitting for a while.  
It has a non-running 40hp motor 
Original interior.  
The doors are straight and true
boot and bonnet are in really good shape - no crack in the hood where the
they usually get a crack from the support.  Correct taillights in good shape.  
No dents; 
faded original paint
no under-battery rust, pan is in good shape
trunk and engine compartment are in good shape
good seats, including back seats
nothing has been hacked or drilled on the body

Please buy this car!  He only wants $900 for it.   I want to see it go to a
good home!  I'd take it, but I've already
filled my allotment of VW's and I have my hands full with the '54 bus!

Call Benji (209) 748-5411
