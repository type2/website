Subject: '56 kombi - new security system

Wie Ghetes,

	My '56 kombi has created its own security system!

	For whatever reason, at least once a day, I'll turn the key and
nothing happens.  I then turn the lights on and off, and then she
cranks up like normal!

	I tried several differnet things, like trying to start it with the
lights on, but nothing else works!

	What in the hell would cause this, especially having to flash the
lights?

	As usual, any comments would be appreciated...

Thom
