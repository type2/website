Subject: Re: '77 Westy: Interference between Bed and Table

My only concern would be that the Pipe Support for the table lends support
to the end of the bed.  I beleive that the bottom of the seat actually rests
on that support once you convert the back seat to a bed and I don't know how
stable it would be without the bottom of the seat resting on it.

Anyone else have any ideas???
