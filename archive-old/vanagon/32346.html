&gt; I need a little info regarding early bus window rubber.  I need to replace
&gt; one front windshield in both my '56 &amp; '67 busses.  Who makes the best rubber?
&gt;  Is it the same rubber for both busses?  TIA

Yes, they're both the same.  If you had a Barndoor it would be different 
though.  8-)

My personal choice for VW window rubber is Vintage Parts, Inc.  I had 
the opportunity to meet Bob Scott as he was hauling a load of the rubber 
he sells and it is not the same type West Coast Metric sells.  Personally 
speaking, I have had both products and the Vintage Parts, Inc. product 
held up better, was easier to install &amp; looked better.  It did not have 
that 'shiny' look to it like WCM's and it felt &amp; acted like the stuff VW 
originally installed, IMHO.  BTW, I have no vested interests in either of 
these companies.  8-)
