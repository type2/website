&gt; In today's Saint Paul (Minnesota) Pioneer Press:
&gt; 
&gt; '86 VW Vanagon 4X4, blue in color, fresh trade.  Call for details.  On sale
&gt; at $2,961.  White Bear Lincoln-Mercury (612) 482-2631.  This dealership is in
&gt; White Bear Lake, MN (St. Paul suburb).  At $2,961, I wonder what it looks
&gt; like.  Probably &quot;good condition&quot;.

&gt; '72 Westy
&gt; '87 Syncro GL
&gt; .- For that price I'd be very careful,or very happy. 

 Fresh trade? who advertises that?
