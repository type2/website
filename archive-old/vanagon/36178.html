Subject: 21 window fs (FLA) 1,750.00 obo

Yesterday at the BugBash (Here in Lakeland, Florida) there was a 1964 Deluxe
Bench 21 window for sale. 

It was your basic interest-lost restoration. Usual rust and rot in the usual
places. Most of the rust has been covered by BusBoys panels, cargo bed, rocker
and wheel well panels, etc.,etc. The downside to this is the PO riveted them
in. The upside is they look like they can to be salvaged, trimmed and then
welded in properly.

The body is otherwise straight, good nose, roof, etc.,etc.

The bench back has been removed to facilitate a neat hinged boat seat :-(
and the middle and rear seat are missing.

All the windows were broken by vandals, but have been replaced with BFY glass.
New opera window and front windsheild rubbers are in the rear cargo area.

The motor supposedly runs, and was being driven until it was vandalized. Will
post further info on request.

BTW: It sports a new Imron &quot;Kodak Yellow&quot; and &quot;Warm White&quot; two tone paint job!
