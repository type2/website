Subject: 70 Single Cab

Hey volks,
I'm a lurker in the archives but thought some one might be interested in 
a 70 Single Cab I noticed in the local lemon lot.  It's a red single cab 
without sidegates and looks to be in decent shape.  Please call (916) 
678-3530, the guy is asking $2500 OBO.  Happy shopping.

Phil
