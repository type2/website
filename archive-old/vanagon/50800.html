Subject: PROPEX Furnaces: Group Purchase?

I am going to be calling PROPEX in England within the 
next couple of days to order a &quot;Propex Compact 1600&quot;, a
vented propane furnace for my Syncro Westie. I expect cost
to be around $600. These are the units that are often put in UK
buses, a couple of listmembers have installed them and are real
happy...see

Anyway, I'm always ready to talk volume discounts, and its probably 
cheaper to handle export paperwork for one shipment, so if anyone
is interested in going in on this, please let me know asap.

Thanks

Tom F.
