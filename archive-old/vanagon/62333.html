Soak it with penetrating oil (many listees have said that &quot;Kroil&quot; works 
real well).  Without damaging the bolt head, give it a hard tap with a 
hammer (I use the round head of a ballpeen hammer).  This sometimes 
breaks the corrosion bond.  Try again.  Soak and repeat several times, if 
still no, try a piece of pipe or breaker bar.  Be careful, you might 
crank the head right off the bolt.  I would soak it for a few days before 
giving up.
Good luck,
