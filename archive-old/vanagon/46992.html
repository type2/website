Subject: Water Wetter: Again

I saw this post in the SAAB group.  It is copied verbatim - I can't
verify its correctness.  The author writes:

=================================

Water wetter.......
                I do love seeing strange topics such as these. What is
water wetter? If it's what a definition of what I heard once, it's
something (a substance or solution) which reduces the surface tension of
water molecules (the Van Der Waals force). Simple water wetter is
dishwater
detergent. Those good old anionic surfactants. About three tablespoons
of
concentrated dishwash liquid or similar (I use Amway LOC (no plug by the
way)) and the car runs cooler, there's no suds and it keeps the
waterways
clean and defurred. It doesn't interfere with the antifreeze`performance
as
-28C here in Aberdeen just proved. This is not necessarily a
recommendation
but it works for me and together my 900 T16S Aero and I have chalked up
220K miles + with no radiator declogs, hose replacements or bust heater
cores.
