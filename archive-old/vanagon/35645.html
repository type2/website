Well, she's not, yet! Because I'm waiting to see if HotVWs or VWTrends 
will buy an illustrated article about her... and they both require 
exclusive rights to the material. We have done a professional photo 
shoot - but we're on hold until we hear from the mags.

I could forward gifs from our big wall books! Nah... maybe not ... what 
does big wall climbing have to do with vanagons, anyway?
