&gt;    I'm throwing out a line to see if anyone bites.  Is anyone interested in
&gt; doing a live chat night?  I'll be glad to set it up if I get enough
&gt; interest.  Just a thought. We could talk about anything that comes to mind,
&gt; of course I thought we would talk VW's, but hey who knows?  If anyone is
&gt; interseted let me know.  You will need a program to do live chat. PC users
&gt; will probably need mIRC38  and Mac users can get ircle 2.2.  You may find
&gt; them a your internet providers FTP site. Or write me and I can get you some
&gt; more info.Looking forward to hearing from you.  Lets all talk live!

Some of us already do that.  Jim is talking about IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
which of course mIRC and ircle are both clients of.  People running real
operating systems ( :-&gt; ) like unix can use ircII, which is text based
but fast and powerful.  There is a channel called #VW which is sorta
maintained by our own BradleyM.  Martha is there a lot, and I stop by
from time to time.  Gerry S. has been seen there a few times too.  Would
be real nice to see some other listmembers too!
