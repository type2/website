Subject: water wetter again

Hi All,

Thanks to all those who replied about the water wetter. I have another
question though. If the surfactant reduces the surface tension of the water
in the coolant, thus making the air bubbles in the water smaller, would
this perhaps reduce the amount of air that gets trapped in the radiator?
Just something to ponder.
