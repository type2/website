&gt; Vanatics,

&gt; I saw a new camping product recently that looks intriguing.  It's called the
&gt; Car Top Tent, and I read an article about it in &quot;Four Wheel Drive &amp; Sport
&gt; Utility&quot; magazine.  It is basically a folding tent that fastens to roof racks

and stuff...

&gt; I really like the idea of having the tent-on-top.  Just the ticket for us
&gt; non-Westys!  Right now I'm searching for ways to afford/justify the purchase.
&gt;
&gt; If you're interested you can call them at (800) CAR TOP1.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else seen or used one of these, I'd be anxious to here more about
&gt; it from someone who has.

Like many other &quot;new&quot; ideas talked about lately on this list, VW already
had this back around 1960.  I saw one at a SOTO meet.  Mounted on top of a
splittie and had a ladder that hung in the rain gutter on top and rested
against the tire on the bottom (so no paint gets scratched).  Anybody on
this list have one of these?  It was pretty cool, with red and white
stripes that matched the regular tent!
