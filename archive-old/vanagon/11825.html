&gt;I'm very curious, and I haven't seen any questions to my last question: How
&gt;does one get into the upper bunk on a Camper?

Well, in our 75 camper, we first climb onto the fridge/stove top and climb
into the upper bunk from there. It takes a fair amount of agility; I
couldn't see my parents getting up there.
