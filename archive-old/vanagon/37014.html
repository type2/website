Subject: '78 Camper for sale in CA bayarea

I was driving through Hayward and saw this one.   It's NOT mine.
 
Said the engine was still under warranty.
New: Brakes, clutch, alternator, am/fm/cassette
$1950 OBO 510-247-0318
 
It looked pretty rough to me.  I was looking at it from the outside, but
I thought I saw tape on the screen of the pop-top.  Also, the seal of the
pop-top could use replacing.  The interior didn't look so hot either, I
didn't see any cushions on the bed.  Both windwings were damaged.  It had
a bald spare on the front, 2 good reinforced tires on the rear, and a
mismatched set of standard load tires on the front in fair shape.  And the
radio is really cheap looking.  Has the normal rust under the windshield.
 
On the good side, the body is looks straight.  So I think the camper
would be a good base for someone that wants to redo the camper stuff
anyway.  And I think $1950 is a bit steep.  I'd offer something closer to
$1000.
