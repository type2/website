&gt; 
&gt; They make beautiful tools (IMHO) - do they have a distribution network in 
&gt; the USA?

I agree, nice tools.  Pendergrass Tool Specialist, at (714) 827-4210, 
sells Hazet, Stahlwille, and some others.
&gt; 
&gt; ... are they kind of like the SnapOn of German tools?

Yes, I would say both Hazet and Stahlwille are on par with SnapOn.  Very 
expensive, too.
