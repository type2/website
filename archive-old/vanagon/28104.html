Subject: End of season stats...

Hello Everyone.  Well, we just finished our last camping trip for 
1995, and thought I would share some stats with you.  Our camping 
season is from March to November.  We have camped a total of 76 days, 
and covered 12,671 km during that time.

I've just winterized the water tank today, the van has been emptied 
ready for a rest until next March.  The awning has been removed, and 
hung up in the garage.  Over the winter months, I hope to 
shampoo the camper rug, remove the fridge for service, get the front 
end CV's packed (Syncro), completely detail inside/outside/engine.  
Our top bunk cushions have also been removed, a &quot;dry-z-air&quot; 
container has been placed inside the van, and the propane tank has been 
filled.  

The van is in the garage, and aside from changing the oil next 
weekend, will probably only do 500 km from now until March.  Oh yes, 
I have to get it AirScared (emissions tested) as well.

Looking forward to staying home until March....
Harry.
