          I'm in search of a 93 Eurovan Westfalia Weekender to replace the 
          one I rolled a few weeks ago.  The weekender (without the stove, 
          etc.) is VERY hard to find, as they were only imported in 1993.
          
     In the spirit of Friday (which it isn't):
     
     Oh, so you've slaughtered one of these rare beasts and you want us to 
     help you find another?  Well, no way, mister!  You've had your chance! 
      And what did you do?  Total annihilation!!
     
     How about a Voyager?  (From the company who &quot;invented the Minivan&quot;)  
     We'll not mind if you wreck a dozen of those.
