&gt; &lt;&lt; I am definitely seeing a delay.  It takes 3-5 hours for my posts to return
&gt; to my E-mail box. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; yeah. maybe it's an aol thing.
&gt; Any other aol members notice the same thing?

I'm sure it's an aol thing; my posts usually show up before I have time 
to log off.  I understand aol &quot;pools&quot; outbound e-mail and then 
periodically sends it as a batch out to the internet.  Remember, when 
you're on aol you're in their little gated community.
