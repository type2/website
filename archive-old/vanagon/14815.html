Subject: Re: '56 update - misc ramblings

A friend of mine here at the lab asked me if I knew about the secret &quot;combi
wave&quot;.  I just kind of looked at him.  Well, it ends up that the secret wave
hasn't been shared with the St. Augustine crowd.  I got a couple waves before
the bus needed parking though!  
For any who remember the story of woe, I am hopefully trading my '86 Cougar 
with turned bearing for a head gasket job (with accessories) on the '85 bus.

I'll find out tomorrow, I certainly hope it works out.  I want to drive this thing and do some of the minor repairs that I'm waiting until after to do.
