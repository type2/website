Subject:      Re: Retail Price of an '87 Vanagon GL??

&gt;I'm looking at an '87 Vanagon GL and was wondering if anyone can tell me the
&gt;&quot;Book Price&quot; of this Critter.  It has dual A/C, Alloys, 4sp, cruise, 114K mi,
&gt;Weekender rear seat (did all '87s have this?) and is in real good condition.
&gt; If you don't have the book price would appreciate your best guess as to what
&gt;it is worth...yes I know that varies from region to region....any input would
&gt;be appreciated.

here's the stuff that's out in the FAQ. the &quot;best&quot; pricing info you can get
for your area is available at the bank or credit union ... call their loan
people and ask how much they'll loan on the car.

hmmmm. 114K. that's just about as much as my 88. it's not REALLY &quot;dual&quot; a/c
... you should have a big long duct up the middle of the roof, but all the
a/c stuff is in the back. all the GL models after about 86 or so had that
Weekender rear seat. it's something that should have been in ALL the buses
from day 1!!! :) i love it!
