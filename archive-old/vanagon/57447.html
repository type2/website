Subject: Re: Help With Instrument Lighting Please

The instrument lights are funny, in a tragic sort of way.  The old style
lights had replacable bulbs in a flanged holder.  The bulbs are standard,
but not common.  The later style was an integral unit.   My '80 has the
old version.  These fit into the same spots as the later ones, and you can
get bulbs.  I don't know when they changed, and many early Vanagons have
had their old-style lights replaced with the $$$$$ new version, because
that's what the dealers carry.  Sadly, most of the holders were thrown out
with the bulbs.

I too have fashioned my own -- now I pull spares from any junkyard copy I see.
I have one full set of the old style.  Much nicer.  Thank you again VW for
your continuing goal of screwing up basically good designs.
