Subject: Clarification to the Correction

Sorry, folks, and Gerry.

You still go to the direct URL
http://www.off-road_dot_com/4x4web/travels/metrodc.html 
But do not click on the link marked 
&quot;George Washington National Forest, VA &quot; because 
it leads you off on another wild goose chase. (Its all
a navigation test to see if you are really prepared for off-road)

To actually find and read the trail report on GW National Forest, just
scroll down through the document.

Apologies again,

Tom F.
