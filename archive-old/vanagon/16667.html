&gt;No I didn't, but what a good idea. Do you think there is enough room just
&gt;below the bleeding nipple to weld/solder in some sort of &quot;mini-cap&quot;?

Hi,   that area on my rad is plastic, the bleed screw is seated in a 
threaded metal insert. I am going to try to replace the bleed 'bolt' with 
one that has a brake bleed nipple in it, as soon as I can explain what I 
want clearly to the machinist. I want something that I can easily open, then 
slip some tubing onto, then bleed into a bottle. Space is at a premium in 
that area due to the support though. Let you know how it goes, probably 
others would want one too. tim s.
