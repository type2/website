&gt;
&gt;   I wonder why _anyone_ would buy a VW Eurovan camper for over $30K, since
&gt;   you can buy an RV with shower,  microwave, tv, etc., for about the same
&gt;   price (mid- 30s).  What market is VW/Winny trying to hit, anyway?

I don't know about $30K+.  The dealer in my area has two of them,
and the sticker is $29.5K.  I suppose there's some bargaining room
there also.
