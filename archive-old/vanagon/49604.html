&gt;Hi, I just received the electrical and water supply hookup 
&gt;replacements I orderded and installed them on my 85 Westy. The 
&gt;electrical hookup has three screws on the back, on the original the 
&gt;black wire went to the brown screw the white wire to the silver screw 
&gt;and the green screw. The new one worked out so the black wire went on 
&gt;the silver screw and the white wire went on the brown screw and the 
&gt;green (ground) screw. Is this OK?

Not OK. Not to code. You're swapping the hot and neutral wires. Could be
dangerous. Rewire properly before applying power!
