Howdy!

Bob asked Sami to write a trip report, and somehow that duty got foisted on
me, Maria.  So here goes--all complaints and criticisms go to Sami :-)

Laden with  baby Julia in the Samimobile, we arrived in Springfield on
Saturday afternoon while the June Bug Jamboree was wrapping up.  The
reports we heard from those who had been there were mostly that it was very
hot out there on the asphalt!  We saw some very interesting suntans and
burns to attest to that.  About 15 busses and crew cabs were parked at the
lovely Springfield KOA when we arrived.  Lots of familiar faces and busses
from BBTA, but we got more of a chance to chat and put some names with the
faces.

That evening a drive-in movie had been planned, but a general sense of
lethargy coupled with an antipathy towards the feature film (_The Cable
Guy_) led most everyone to stay and chat at the campground.  Of course,
many of those who said they wanted to get to sleep early were the ones
engrossed in VW chat in the wee small hours!

We all had a lovely sleep at the campground, punctuated only by about 50
freight trains rolling through with whistles blowing, 10 low-flying
aricraft, a million mosquitos, and half a million early-rising songbirds.

Fortunately, the next morning, Bob (Hufford) and Lance (Moeller) and their
families were so kind as to cook us a lovely pancake breakfast (food
provided by Bob's brother-in-law the food broker). It was a good chance to
continue to visit, and at the end of the breakfast, Lance distributed door
prizes. The gathering was small enough that we all got a prize! 

Once we were all packed up, we headed out on Route 66. Most of the busses
went out west towards Joplin and Kansas City, but Pete Sellers, Bob, Mark
Mihalik, and we went east towards St. Louis.  We saw lots of lovely
scenery as well as some deserted towns and cheesy deserted motels.  After
a BBQ lunch at a truck stop, we parted ways. Sami and I were lucky enough
to meet another bus owner on our way home--I guess some bus owners are
crazy enough to pull off a freeway just to compare busses.  This one was a
lovely 76 custom bus owned by a ballet dancer in Connecticut.  We topped
off our Route 66 experience by visiting Ted Drewes in St. Louis and eating
frozen custard.

This was a really fun weekend--the gathering was small enough to really get
to know people. Lots of nice folks and nice busses. Thanks to Bob and Lance
for putting it together--we look forward to the next one!

Respectfully submitted,

Maria and Sami
