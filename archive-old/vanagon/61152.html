Subject: O2 and battery light on!

After a pleasant weekend camping in Conn. the battery and O2 lights came
on at the kennel where we picked up our noncamping pooch. I had a
similar but not identical  problem a year or so ago when those same
lights flickered dimmly. Now they are on solid. Then it was traced to a
bad connection of some wire at the alternator. So I had a look and see
that one black wire is hanging free. It comes from a small black plastic
thingy (condensor/capacitor?) that is bolted to the edge of the
alternator. I can't see where the other end should connect. Can anyone
tell me? Is this likely to be the reason the lights are on?  Thanks for
the advice, Nelson Hogg
