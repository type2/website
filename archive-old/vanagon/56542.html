Subject: Solo Brake Bleeding Success (finally)
Date: 26 Feb 97 11:27:10 PST

As some of you are well aware, my past success with brake bleeding has 
be a perfect zero percent.  Well, that has FINALLY changed.  I bled 
the brakes, again, this time with a minor set-back, then success.

In the neverending quest to find solo techniques, brake bleeding had 
eluded me.  A couple of sneaky tips and a nifty modification finally 
did it.

Sneaky tip #1 - After attaching a clear hose onto the brake bleeder 
nipple, run the hose OVER the top of the tire.  This will ensure that 
air coming out of the line, and any getting in at the bleeder will go 
away from the cylinder by floating UP to the top of the tire.  Use a
long hose.

#2 - After breaking open the bleeder, let gravity do it's thing and 
let the juices flow.  After fluid has collected to the top of the 
hose, hold the hose up a little more and then move the hose around to 
get the bubble to go to the jar end of the hose.  Viola, fluid 
throughout the entire hose, without bubbles.  Watch closely and 
you'll see flotsam and jetsam flowing through the hose, and little 
bubbles too.  Remember to keep the master filled.

Modification - I installed a drip irrigation nipple/threaded gizmo 
into the master lid ('80 Vanagon) and applied a little pressure to 
the master to help the fluids flow.  Nature assists in keeping the 
pressure to about 16 psi using my Mity Mite vacuum as a pressure 
giver.

I can press on the pedal to force out fluid, and with pressure 
applied fill the master without drawing fluid back in from the jar 
(do it slowly)

Everything looked good, went for a test drive.  Noticed 
lack of braking ability.  ARRGH!  Checked and found a leaking nipple.  
Re-bled leaker and all was right, finally!

So, THAT'S how brakes are supposed to feel!
