&gt;
&gt;- They provide less heat transfer.
&gt;- They may not provide adequate corrosion protection (to meet Mazda's
&gt;specifications.)
&gt;- Freezing temperature of these coolants is 10-20 percent higher than
&gt;ethylene glycol-based coolants.
&gt;
&gt;For these reasons, Mazda recommends the use of an ethylene glycol and
&gt;water mixture in the cooling systems of all Mazda vehicles.&quot;
&gt;


What does it mean for one temperature to be 10-20 percent higher than another?

Neil
