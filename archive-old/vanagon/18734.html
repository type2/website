Subject: Spark plug wires

What is a GOOD brand of spark plug wires that could be used on  an
82 Westy? It seems that the air-cooled engine gets so hot in that little
compartment of his, that the wires get &quot;fried out of service&quot; after about
6 months or so.  I need a set of spark plug wires that are good
performers, stand the heat, priced decently (unlike those $100 or so
sets), and are readily avaiable (no need to special order).  Thanks
for the help.

BTW, the 82 Westy is gasoline powered... not diesel.
