Subject: You are invited.....

An open letter to all out-of-area vantypes.

As an extension of the mail thread on hosting the van migration...

Please consider this an open invite from Althea (the bus) and I
to any vanagon-list members who might roll through the Santa Clara
vally area (aka Silicon Valley).

Give us a ring (or an e-mail) and we will be happy to roll out the
red rug for you-alls -- ahhh what's the plural of you-all, anyway?

Keep on roll'n
