&gt;Do you still have a functioning reserve tap? I leave my '56 bug
&gt;on the &quot;off&quot; position (even when I have the shifter locked) when
&gt;I park it in a strange place.
&gt;
&gt;I figure that not too many people know about the old reserve tap...
&gt;and within an 1/8th of a mile or so the car runs out of gas.

My friend with the '59 bus told me about that.  I have to get the 
cable working, though.  Might be something to consider this weekend
when I am putting the new tranny in, though :)

Thanks!

Thom
