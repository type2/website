Subject: Handbrake cables for 1967 Type II 

Mail sent from AIR Mosaic (16-bit) version 3.06.04.01 

Please forward this if necessary...

I have just been quoted $80 (Can) for each handbrake cable for my 1967 
Deluxe.  Can anyone tell me the name of a reasonable supplier for these
cables?  They have to be less than that.

Thanks for your help.

Don Fugler
