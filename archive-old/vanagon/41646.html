Subject: old e-mail account

Hey all,
Well, forget everything I told you about my Wow account.  It seems I can send
mail fine from there but I'm not receiving any.  If anybody out there has sent
me e-mail at sean_bartnik_at_wow_dot_com, I have NOT received it.

Send all messages to 76065.3075_at_compuserve_dot_com from now on until I get this
e-mail problem resolved with Wow.

Sorry -- anybody who sent me something on the wow account should probably resend
it to the compuserve account.

Sean
