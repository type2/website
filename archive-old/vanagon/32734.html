&gt;&gt;OK, I'LL BITE AGAIN SINCE NO ONE ANSWERED WHAT THE SMALL ROUND GIZMO ON THE
VANAGON DASH IS. THE MANUAL PICTURES IT BUT DOESN'T ID IT. WHAT IS I

I have that silver scocket in my 80 Westy and often wondered what it was - I
couldn't find it in manuals either.  Its right between the steering wheel and
the heater controls.    So one day with more time on my hands than brains - I
stuck a screw driver in it - I thought maybe its a switch that broke off.
 WOOOH - sparks flew  (just like on Tooltime) and it blew out some fuses.
 I'll go along with the popular opinion that its a (secret) electrical
outlet.
