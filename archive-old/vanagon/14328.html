Subject: 88 Vanagon - Blown tranny



Hello to all:

I just joined this list in the past week or so, and am enjoying it immensely. I
live in MD. and I never seem to meet any Vanagon folks out here.

 I just bought a 1988 Vanagon in great shape- except it came with a blown tranny
and a cracked windshield- for a song:only $900!

The big questions:
1. Does anybody know if a windshield from an '82 or '83 will interchange with an
'88? I know of two different donor Vanagons being parted out close to home.

2. Is there any recurring problem with the Vanagon trannies? Mine will not go
into third or fourth gear. You physically cannot push the gearshift into the
position. It doesn't yell at me, just refuses to go in. Leads me to believe I
have a broken shift fork, or a mangled syncro sleeve. I plan on tearing it down
in the next two weeks or so (After I finish doing the %$_at_* taxes!) to take a
look. I cheeesy-built the tranny in my '80 Vanagon when I had it several years
ago with &quot;Tom-engineered&quot; tools. (I was still in school, had to be cheap)
This time, I'll at least buy the alingment fixture for the gear stacks/forks!

Thanks for any input!
