Subject: Re: Oil cooler

&gt;been sticking. I got the one out at the bottom of the engine and 
&gt;cleaned it, but I never could get the one out at the front front of 
&gt;the engine that really regulates the oil pressure. Has anyone ever 
&gt;done this?
&gt;
I did!  I did!  I was so proud of myself!  Thanks for the advice,
man.  --Ralf
