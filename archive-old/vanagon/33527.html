Subject: Re: stretch net for 'falia luggage racks

My wife bought me a lightweight nylon car roof rack for Christmas for the 
same purpose. Also haven't tried it, but it looks like it'll do the 
trick. Looks like a suitcase with straps on it. (I'm thinking &quot;Toss the 
clothes in there and zip it up&quot; She's thinking &quot;toss the toys in there 
and fold the clothes.&quot;) 

&quot;Wrinkles? We don't need no steenking wrinkles!&quot;
