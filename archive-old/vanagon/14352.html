Subject: '82 parts vanagon


 &gt; From: Richard Smith &lt;rich_at_indynet.indy_dot_net&gt;

V&gt; If I am able to get hold of this thing cheap, would anyone be interested 
 &gt; in some parts. It is all there. Two-tone yellow with some rust (three-tone). 
 &gt; Motor has a spun bearing. Brown interior. Computer. Glass.

Hey, I need a clock, interior door handles and a rear view mirror.
