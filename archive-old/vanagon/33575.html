Subject: the ccc's take over southern CA!


Flash news - the California Camping Crazies, in a last minute quite
impulsive decision to help out fellow list member Jeff Schneiter (as
he buys his very own bus w/ rebuilt engine back from Schwarze) have decided
to land in southern CA briefly this weekend.  This is sort of loose, but
will be generally Friday morning thru Sat mid-afternoon.  There's a
possibility of taking a quick 2-hr. trip into Tijuana on a tequila/
blanket hunt.  If any one from the list (Maher, etc.) from this area
wants to try and get together, let me know.  Please e-mail me
suggestions, directions, addresses, phone numbers, etc.  I'll be
departing from the Bay area with other list members Thursday evening.

Stay tuned...
