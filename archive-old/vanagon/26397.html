&gt;&gt;&gt;This morning I spotted what looked like a 76 VW bus (saw it from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;distance)that was a converted camper (looked like a vertical pop top).  What
&gt;&gt;&gt;was unusual was that it was about 5 feet longer than a normal bus.  Looks
&gt;&gt;&gt;like this fellow welded the middle section of another bus to the front and
&gt;&gt;&gt;back ends of his bus.  His plate was of U.S. origin, I couldn't make out
&gt;&gt;&gt;what state.  I've never seen one of these in Canada or anywhere else!
&gt;
&gt;Nope. The front and back ends were as usual but the middle was 4-5 feet
&gt;longer(picture a stretch limo) . I'd say the total length was 17-18 feet.

there was a Dutch company ... Klemperer?? ... that made extended versions of
the panel trucks. they were used for ambulances and backery trucks and such.
i've only seen them in some of the books about buses, and one in the last
issue of HOT VWs (at some show. someone had converted it to a camper).
it really looks a little strange (in the pictures).
