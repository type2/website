Subject: pictures

Well, I took a few more pictures of the EV in action over the holiday weekend.
My old secret camp site is no more - tribe has converted it into an ugly
campground. A shame. The 'before' shots are on my Vanagon page, the 'after
shots are on the 'EV' page.
Fortunately I've found another place to hide out.
