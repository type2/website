&gt;---Ben Franklin
&gt;'69 transporter


Late followup to last Friday's thread:

There is no truth to the rumor that Ben Frankling DID NOT drive a
'69 Transporter, due to being refused a smog certificate by the EPA,
even though he was able to demonstrate that his bus put out far less
emissions than the other modes of transportation in vogue at the time.

He then discovered electricity as a means of providing alternate
power for his favorite ride, but the kite kept snagging when he drove
under trees and bridges.



Sorry, folks, couldn't let it go.   :^)
