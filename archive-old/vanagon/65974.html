Thanks to all who have responded. You have been very helpful in helping
us decide that this is probably the vehicle we will get in the next
sevearl months.

But, would like to keep the thread going too, so anyone else have
something to add??

To Andy, can't get on that website you gave for Vanagon archives, some
problem there?

Thanks again to all,
Charles
Oh,
1985 Gulf diesel, 187K, going strong
wishing I had the 1956 Karman Ghia, high compression heads, dual carbs,
and Abarth muffler that my dad owned in the early 60's! Boy, did we
surprise a few folks with that one!
