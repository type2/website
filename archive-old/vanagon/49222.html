&gt;On Sat, 7 Sep 1996 11:57:26 -0500 you said:
&gt;&gt;My 86 GL's radiator fan is only going on when it's time for the high speed.
&gt;&gt;Low speed is not going on at all, not even when the A/C is on.  I have
&gt;&gt;checked the 2nd stage relay (good) and the fuse (good).  I haven't made it
&gt;&gt;to the fan switch yet.
&gt;
&gt;my 86 did exactly the same thing: nothing happened until the high speed fan
&gt;came on ... and it was LOUD! scared pedistrians and people in the cars in
&gt;front of me in traffic! really. but the car never overheated or gave any
&gt;indications of anything &quot;wrong&quot; ... it was just annoying.
&gt;
&gt;now, my 88 does NOT do that. sometimes i can hear the low speed fan come on,
&gt;but i don't think i've heard the high speed on more than a half-dozen times
&gt;in eight years.
&gt;
&gt;my point being: there are probably some different switches to signal the
&gt;turn-on points for the fans. or a different fan blade (our 86 low-speeds
&gt;may have been coming on, and we just didn't hear them ... you might try
&gt;letting the car idle while you clamber up into the spare tire well and watch
&gt;to see if the low-speed ever turns on).
&gt;
&gt;just some rambling data points ...   good luck.

Joel,

I did visually check the fan to see if it was moving and it never wnet on
until high speed.  Is there something behind the left headlight  that is
somehow involved is turning the fan on when A/C is on?

Thanks
