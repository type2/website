&gt; I have had the oil changed at places like Jiffy Lube, etc. BUT YOU NEED
&gt; TO WATCH THEM LIKE A HAWK WHILE THEY DO IT!
&gt; 
&gt; After finding out (from me) that you fill the oil from behind the
&gt; license plate they proceeded to top off all the other fluid levels.
&gt; They were just about to top off the radiator expansion tank with
&gt; windshield washer fluid when I told them that it was for the radiator!
&gt;
Reminds me about the time I had KMart change my oil.  Came off the rack
with the oil light on.  Put it back on the rack.  I watched them change
the oil again.  Light still on, but the guy said he could feel the oil
circulating thru the oil filter.  Must be the sensor, they said.  I got
a mile down the road before it froze up.
