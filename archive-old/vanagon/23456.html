Subject: /f Children, wise beyond their years

I was goofing around in my '62 bus last night at the apartment
complex, and a couple with a 3- or 4-year-old boy came out
to get in their Jeep Cherokee.  The kid kept saying, &quot;Mom,
what's THAT?&quot;  &quot;Mom, what's THAT?&quot;  over and over, until mom
finally answered, &quot;A car.&quot;  This is when I realized the kid
was staring at my lovely green and white bus, so I 
popped my head out to say hi.  Then he said, with that
voice of assuredness only little kids can have,

&quot;It's a RACE CAR!!!!&quot;

All I could do was agree.
