     Last night, while I was driving around, I was listening to a talk show 
     on one of our local stations.  There was a lengthy discussion of a new 
     system that is apparently coming on the market now.  According to the 
     developers, this system consists of the following items - all existing 
     within current technology:
     
     1)  Standard anti-theft alarms and related components
     2)  A satellite-based geographic locator receiver
     3)  A cellular telephone
     4)  A microprocessor based control system
     5)  Self-contained backup power for several weeks operation
    ________________________________________________________________

These have been availible in the Los Angeles area for some time....and they 
work, provided your theif isn't so smart as to park the stolen goods deep 
underground to interupt the phone signal, etc.

When stolen, the high value car is then left at some innocous place for a 
few days.  If the police and a tow-truck show up, the theif knows he made a 
good decision NOT to place that particular car directly into the chop-shop.  
If still around after a few days....all is well, chop away....or whatever.  

I guess the bottom line (of getting your car back) makes it all worth while, 
but it might be best if the cellular called the owner, who could arange for 
the appropriate corrective actions be taken against the low-life slug.....
