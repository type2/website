Subject: Help! I'm very confused.

Talk about a bad day. I'm so frustrated I could bite the head off a
rattlesnake...and I WOULD if one would happen along right now. I won't go
into all the vectors contributing to my frame of mind, but I would like to
ask for help on one VW-specific problem. 

I have my engine sitting in the garage waiting for reassembly. I checked
the endplay and it's way out: .012 to .013 inches. I'm not checking it
with a dial indicator like I should be, but I am using what appears to be
a reliable method with a stationary bolt and a metal bar extending out to
rest on the end of the flywheel. I've done the check so many times that
I'm not concerned with the validity of the measurement. My problem comes
when I add shims to adjust the end play. 

I have some shims from my spare engine which appear to be .008 inch shims. 
If I add one of these, I can get to .005, but at that point my flywheel
won't turn anymore. I'm confused. Is this symptomatic of some much larger
problem? I'm sure the end play is way too much to live with at .012 or
.013.  It's very obvious that my crankshaft would be slamming back and
forth and dramatically reducing the life of my engine. I've tried
everything I know to no avail. I hope someone out there has a good
suggestion. 

BTW, I'm in digest mode, so I'd appreciate direct replies.

Thanks! Joe
