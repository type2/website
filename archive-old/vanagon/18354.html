To All:

When doing an overhaul on a high-time engine it's a good idea to pull the
soft aluminum plugs used to seal (hopefully!) the various oil galleries,
replacing them with threaded set-screws, for galleries up to 1/2&quot; (13mm),
using socket-head aluminum pipe plugs for any of larger diameter.  Set-screws
come in a variety of lengths, diameter and thread.

It is extremely important the the engine be dismantled when the oil galleries
are tapped, and that the crankcase be throughly cleaned after.  To insure a
leak-free seal, the threads should be primed and the set-screws treated with
loctite.  After insertion of the set-screws the case should be allowed to
cure for 24 hours before further assembly.

For those of you running the 'drop-in' hydraulic cam follower (available from
CB and others) in Type I engines, you will have noticed occasional clack and
collapse of the lifters.  The problem stems from the small diameter of the
stock cam follower oil galleries.  Under some conditions the 'corner' lifters
will be starved for oil.  You can cure this problem by opening up the
cam-follower galleries with a long-reach 1/4&quot; drill.  The cam follower bores
should be smoothed after drilling to remove any burrs.  Enlarging the center
cam bearing oil trough (ie, the space under the middle of the bearing) will
also help, as this is the sole path for oil to the cam followers on the
right-hand side of the case.
