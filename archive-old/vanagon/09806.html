Subject:       getting and staying bent...

Steve whines...:)
&gt; My main problem is with the wiper.  Even with new ones.  What happens is I
&gt; get them installed and after a relatively short time, the blade tends to
&gt; stay bent in one direction so that if there is not enough water on the
&gt; windshield, they chatter across their path driving both driver and passenger
&gt; insane!
At the risk of insulting the obvious, the fix for fixing those 
chattering blades is to place the jaws of a cresent wrench on the 
 flat part of the wiper arm and 'adjust' the blade so that it is perpendicular
 to the glass.  This gives the blade the choice (free-will for wipers!) of 
flipping either direction depending on the sweep.

I know you know you knew this already, right?
