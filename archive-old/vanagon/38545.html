Subject: GM alternator


Steve,


My question (finally!) is: Does the lead from the light to the alternator,
play an active part in the energizing of the alternator field?

                  Yes
 Meaning,
if I interrupt this circuit, do I disable the alternator? Or, is the light
seperate from the charging-circuit part of the alternator, and I've done
something else to destroy the entire alternator?

                No


  Ok this is how GM built them. The post from that alternator
  goes directly to the battery. This leaves 2 other quick
  connect terminals. One goes to a 12v source that is switched
  with the ignition switch. The other must go to a resistance
  and then to ground. The resistance in most GM car is a #194
  light bulb!!!!
          Who knows what the PO did with the existing VW light
     there??? Good luck, keep us  up to date
