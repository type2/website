Subject: Help! with VW info for '91

Tom suggested that I request the following:

&quot;Can you call and have someone look at the sticker for you? 
. . . ask anyone on the list with the same Westie to go out
and look at theirs for you.&quot;

So - Please help us with this. If you owne an '88-'91 Westfalia Camper -
look at the tire specs sticker in your door jam (glove box?) and see what
the details are on the tires - 

Does it specify a 97 weight class or something else, what tire pressure does
it specify. You info will put this issue to rest for some of us.

Thankx -
	Kenyon
