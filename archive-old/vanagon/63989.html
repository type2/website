Mike :
Very common problem. Wrecks havoc on ground clusters behind fuse block
also, check it out. I used &quot;flowable&quot; RTV. It is runny RTV made for this
purpose. The water was entering in the upper windshield seal corners on
the outside and running down the inside of the pillar.
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I found a large puddle of water on the driver's side floor mat 
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
&gt;  I was wondering if there was a sealant I could use around the seal to 
&gt;keep this from happening again.  
&gt;Any Ideas??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
