Subject: Subscription info


I subscribe to a number of mailing lists covering a variety of subjects.
 After subscribing to the Vanagon list my eyes began to bleed.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Is it somehow related to leaking head
gaskets?  (The problem never occured with any of the aircooled.vw lists.)
