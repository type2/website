Subject: Re:Fridge:erator

A key concept in the successful operation of fridge in ballast.  If there is
large cold mass in fridge, cooling system can keep up with hotter outside
temps, frequent openings etc.  If no mass, the fridge is working to cool air
only.  And then you let it out.

Keep a bunch of cold drinks (preferably beer) in there and it stays cold
well.

Put drinks *in* cold.

My preference is household current for stationary, propane for camping, and
DC operation for driving (in summer for more than an hour).  Propane
sometimes works while driving.

Also- almost time to inspect and repaint (if necessary) propane tank.  Be
mindful of that thing.



 &gt;&gt;Wow! That sounds much, much better. Those auto-stop valves do have
&gt;&gt;an awful reputation, that's for sure- I wonder why VW continued to use
&gt;&gt;the stupid things, anyway... BTW, the fridge in my '85 can run on
&gt;&gt;battery power as well, but it doesn't seem to get very cold like that-
&gt;&gt;is there any way to get it to work better, or should I be running it off of
the
&gt;&gt;battery at all (it seems to work fine when I 'plug' the van in)? Oh
&gt;&gt;yeah, and how long can you run your fridge on a tank of propane (the
&gt;&gt;tank looks pretty small)?
