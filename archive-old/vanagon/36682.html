Subject: Re: Valve cover leak

&gt; Hi volkspeople! Like it is customary, to the point.
&gt;
&gt; I'm curious in finding out why would a valve cover leak in the very same
&gt;spot for the third time. I've changed gaskets twice, check the valve cover,
&gt;the part where it mounts and there are no cracks, ruptures or anything in
&gt;the likes. I'm going to try a different material and see what happens.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments, ideas, etc. will be listened to and appreciated. TIA

&gt;I've been smearing a thin coat of red ultra copper hi-temp silicone stuff
 on both sides of the cork gasket and this really does the trick.  It also
 makes for an easy removal as there is no cork sticking to the metal surfaces
 when you remove the valve cover.
