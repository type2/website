&gt; I've always used Simple Green with good results, but usually a warm
&gt; engine, not something stone cold.  It does a pretty good job degreasing,
&gt; and is biodegradable so it shouldn't kill off your lawn or your neighbor's
&gt; pets.  ;-)


The Simple Green is biodegradable, but the crap you're cleaning off won't be.

Food for thought, or your neighbor's pets.
