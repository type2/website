Subject: The VW MPV - press cutting.  

This is copied directly from today's Daily Mirror newspaper ... 
needless to say without permission ...

&quot;Roomy, with a view to the top.&quot; - by Tony Lewin.

'Ford is in great shape with its latest model, the futuristic 
Galaxy people-carrier, designed to tackle the trend-setting 
Renault Espace head-on for the favours of Britain's big 
families.

'Built in conjunction with Volkswagen in Portugal, the Galaxy 
goes on sale this summer for between (UK stg.) 16,000 pounds 
and 24,000 pounds.  It has room for seven people and their 
luggage.

'Engines include Ford's two litre petrol four cylinder, VW's 
much-praised 1.9-litre TDI turbo diesel giving up to 57 mpg and 
VW's super-smooth 2.8-litre VR6, which gives the top version a 
maximum speed of 127mph.

'The Galaxy's interior can accomodate seven luxury airline 
seats, with front chairs swivelling to provide a conference or 
picnic facility.

'There is a built-in child safety seat and twin power points in 
the boot.  The vehicle has conventional hinged rear doors 
rather than sliding doors and the Galaxy's boot is notably 
roomier than the Renault's.

'... Industry experts predict that the Galaxy will overtake the 
Renault Espace to become Britain's biggest-selling people 
carrier.'

There was no accompanying photograph or anything else about VW.
