Subject: Flushing the cooling system.


G'day everyone

Thanks for all the info regarding the Auto of my 90 Vanagon. I think I 
will keep it and sell the F100.

So to that end, I am going to give it the once over, including a full 
cooling system flush &lt;cringe&gt;!

Has anyone go a complete idiots guide  to changing the coolant in  the 
wasserboxer? It is dificult to get hold of the Bently manual here and 
VERY expensive, so I cant refer to it. (I will get one eventually, when I 
have saved up $240 US)

Thanks for the help and all the informative postings.
