&gt; yes, finally the weather gods &amp; the circumstances at work brought together
&gt; a sunny weekend that I could take off! So we went down to Oregon coast,
&gt; which was
&gt; great. It's been a long time since I was there when it was both warm and dry!
&gt; 
&gt; For this, we pulled one of the pads down from the top bunk, placed it the
&gt; floor in front of the kitchen unit, and let the baby sleep there. (At this
&gt; point she can't even rollover, but she did perform an interesting trick -
&gt; spinning around in a complete 360 degree circle over the course of the
&gt; night.)
&gt; 
&gt; Clearly this technique isn't going to work once she's more mobile - I don't
&gt; want to find her sleeping in the foot well by the sliding door! Has anyone
&gt; come up with any interesting tricks to keep a sleeping infant confined
&gt; safely?
&gt; I'm debating taking a folding playpen along and setting it up in that
&gt; space, but  it would sure be awkward.

Went camping with our 9 month old (now 16 months and really mobile)last
october in basically the same situation.  What we did was place pillows
or cushions against the door and galley to keep her from bonking her
head on the wall as she rolled around.  Obviously that won't work now, 
so we are still brainstorming what to do.  Dont think our fold-up
playpen will fit in the space with the bed made down... but haven't
tried it.  Let us know how you turn out.
