&gt;&gt;Not to detract from David's accout of overcoming a broken accelerator
&gt;&gt;cable, but there are a couple of tricks that can get you home, or at least
&gt;&gt;off the freeway should your cable break.

&gt;&gt;If you advance the idle adjustment screw to about 1,500 rpm you can make
&gt;&gt;about 30 mph.  You gotta eat a little clutch to do it, but it will get
&gt;&gt;you off the freeway.

     I have experienced many throttle (and clutch) cable breaks in my
     various VW's over the years. I have found that one of three things
     happen, and here were my solutions without replacing the cable on the
     road:

     1. The swedged-on &quot;hook&quot; end that goes into the pedal assembly pops
     off. Solution: Use a small pair of needle-nose Vise Grips to clamp on
     the end of the cable. Remove shoe from right foot and grasp Vise Grips
     between toes. A little painful, but works. This solution was used on
     Bugs. Type II's, this may not help much since the cable is &quot;below
     deck&quot;

     2.The other swedged-on end, at the carb falls off. Solution: Use one
     of those cheap &quot;Throttle cable extenders&quot; to temporarily replace it.
     This little gizmo sell for about $4 at VW shops.

     3. Cable breaks somewhere in the middle. Usually where it was rubbing
     against engine tin, due to improper bowden tube seating, or a missing
     guide tube. Solution: Profanity. Then, as Bob mentioned, bump that
     idle waaay up. I usually go to the end of the screw travel, which
     seems to get me almost 2500 rpm.

     I guess I could always carry a spare, but even then there is not
     always enough time to replace it on the road.
