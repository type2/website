I assume those 205/70-14's are for a bus. Make sure that's what you want.
They will fit on the stock rim, as I have this size currently on my bus.
However, when I placed stock size tires (185-14's) on the front, it felt like
I had power steering. Those wider tires do take some additional effort to
steer.
