Subject: Metal chips in oil!!!

 Help!

 I was just now changing the oil in my '74, getting it ready for the trek
 to Red Rock. I took off the sump and strainer and there are PIECES OF
 METAL IN IT!!!! Bunches of them, mostly small, roughly 2 mm in diameter,
 but some are larger, about 6mm by 3mm, bent and sharp. They are all very
 shiny and they are not magnetic. I'm guessing it is the aluminum timing
 gear on the camshaft.

 I think I'm going to cry. Looks like I'll be spending the Red Rock Weekend
 taking my engine out.

 Other bits of evidence for the engine detectives out there: 108,000 miles
 on this engine &lt;guess I got my money's worth&gt;, valves adjusted &lt;1000 miles
 ago and only one was out by .001. Good power and running smoothly. No
 big unusual noises &lt;yet?&gt;

 Please email advice/sympathy/teasing direct since I am still on the 
 miserable digest

 Gerry, if you're out there, will you please put me back in real time? I
 think I'm gonna need it....


 Thanks everyone,

 Dave
