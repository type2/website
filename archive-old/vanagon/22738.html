Subject: trans mount agin..

Well made it to D.C. and back with no major problems in my '65 deluxe.
I'd installed a rebuilt transaxle just prior and was a little apprehensive
as this was my first encounter with an engine pull/transaxle swap and
no significant road test prior to heading out to D.C. last week.  It ran like
a charm (after adjusting the valves for the trip). No popping out of 4th 
reasonable shifting (new syncros-required about 500 mi of breaking in.) 
Reaching D.C. the shifting got stiff and at an intersection about 15 min
from my destination my linkage went south.  Had 1st gear (the one I was in) but
it felt like I had lost the coupling connection.  Pulled over and sure enuf,
the coupling had separated from the transaxle end of the shift rod.  I'm glad
I had wired up the set screw as it had separated itself out of the coupler.
TURNS OUT MY NEW FRONT MOUNT IS BROKEN AGAIN... The set screw was stripped out
of the shift rod coupling.  I raised the transaxle, placed the inner race of
an old reduction gear bearing between the transaxle and the cross member and 
clamped the front mount with vise grips.  For the set screw, I used two small
hose clamps to secure set screw into the coupling/shaft and I was on my way.
I'm thinking of replacing the front mount with a solid one (If there is such
an animal) or through-bolting the one thats there.   On the way back I was 
unable to get juice to the starter.  Replaced the wire from the ignition
switch to the starter with new 10 gauge and voila... I'd say not bad for
the last minute assemblage/ road trip!
