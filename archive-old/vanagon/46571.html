        well, i'd say you woll have to order a new (or used one).

        Now for something really scarry, when I ordered mine.  The guy
takeing the order asked me what I wanted th new spedo' to read.  I said (in
my very articulate way) ,&quot;what?&quot;.  He then replied ,&quot;your replaceing the
spegometer to keep the car under waranty, aren't you?  what do you want the
spedometer to read?
        At a loss for words I said 100k.  It arrived at 99,999.
        I won't name or recomend this place because I do NOT think well of
that practice.  (for that matter I would expect that it's illegal)
