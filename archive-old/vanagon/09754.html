     Thom,
     
     Nice to hear that you are actually getting down to camper
     things also.
     
     When I did my bay-window interior (it started life as a 
     panel van), I made the complete interior, including pull-
     out double bed. I've got some photos which I will scan and
     put on my server.
     
     I am currently restoring my Samba interior which is a 
     Devon conversion and all fits very nicely. You tend to
     see a few complete interiors for sale over here. Last
     summer I saw a '50's LHD Devon interor for 100 quid!!!
     I would have had it if it wasn't for a LHD bus.
     Fortunately I had a mate who just imported a Deluxe from
     the States so he jumped at the chance of a LHD Devon
     interior and bought the lot.
     
     It's (so far) taken me longer to restor bits of the interior
     than it did to weld up the whole of my bay window.
     
     cheers,
     
     Lee.
