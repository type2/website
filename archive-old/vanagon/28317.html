Subject: FS Chicago-1964 for $8000

Rich Folk:

The Chicago Trading Times has the following ad:

1963 VW van, call for details, (312) 737-5100.

It is listed in the *Antique* category, so I was not sure
what to expect.  The guy answered the phone *Architectural
Artifacts* which threw me off, but yes, they have a bus:

Actually a 1964.  Mint condition.  $8,000.  No rust.  1400
miles on rebuilt engine.  By description a standard
microbus, not Deluxe.

When the guy, Stewart, said it could do 75mph on the
expressway, I began to have serious doubts.  And anyway, *I*
do not have $8,000!

Unfortunately the 64 listed at $275 and the 67 listed at
$175 were both sold by the time I called. :( Like I needed
another one!

Usual disclaimers apply.
