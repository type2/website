Thanks to all of you who have been so helpful in this situation.  It seems
to me now that Dave Garth has the answer.  The power cannot be on to the
fridge especially when starting the engine, therefore the relay to shut
down the fridge.  This being the case then I must have misconneccted one of
the wires from the relay to the main fusebox.  I think it's the blue one. 
If any of you know where it's supposed to connect to on the fuse box
could you let me know please.   In the midst of replacing all the burnt
and melted wires I must have lost the original location of the end of the
blue wire.  The other black/red wire can not be misconnected as it
terminates to a permanantly fixed position in the fuse box.  A friend of
mine who fools around with VWs a bit also suggested to me that this relay
was to get the load off the camper when starting the engine.  Now that I
think about it, it makes sense.  One more piece of information for the memory
bank !  Overload coming soon.  {:-(

Cheers

Frank
