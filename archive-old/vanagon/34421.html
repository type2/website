As of yesterday afternoon, I'm the proud new owner of a '67 single
cab!!  Rust in the floors, battery, and cargo floor, and hit in the
right rear, but otherwise in quite good shape...

That's in the miscellanous Northern California region, I guess, and if
you didn't already have it down, theat's where my '71 (non-camper) is
too :-)
