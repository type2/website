Subject: I'm Off!

Well, guys, its time to put the 83 Westy to the test again...I'm off to
the west coast.  Long drive from the center of Texas... I'll drive half
way there...  and still be in TEXAS!

The Beast is running fine, AC cold, but without an inspection sticker
due to running rich.  Thanks for all the advice, but so far nothing has
worked.  My mechanic says he's booked for 3 weeks, and wouldn't even
give my a spot a month from now.  Think he is trying to tell me
something?  (I'll just leave it in his lot when I get back!)

Wish me luck!  (With 139k I'll need it!)

TBill
