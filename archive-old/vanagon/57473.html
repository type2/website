There is no way that a van went 141k without new heads      and gaskets
       and
cv joints       and probably   exhuast    and and and and ........
price is cool          you'll need the vanagon emergency repair kit if you
buy it 
1} get a plastic  milk carton 
2} put in a roll of duct tape ,   er . make it two
3} 2 or 3 gallons of coolant 
4} a looonnnngggggg  funnel
5} a gallon of oil  
6}another gallon of coolant 
7}  a new pair of  NIKEs'    and 8
8} another gallon of coolant 
everything can go wrong   and the more things that happen     the more you'll
luv your van
