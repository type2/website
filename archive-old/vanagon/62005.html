Subject: My    1st 1st 1st 1st 1st   Westy

I just bought my first Westfalia.   It is my 8th VW, second Vanagon,but
first full camper.   The owner gets back in town tomorrow, I am beside
myself with excitment.  This is worse than a child on Christmas
morning.  I can't even focus on work, it's all I can think about.  OK I
have it under control!! 

Are 84 models prone to special problems that I should be aware of ?  It
only has 61,000 miles on it.  The PO said he put a new clutch in less
than a year ago.  Is that normal?  My other Vanagon has 110k on the
original clutch.    The AC compressor sounds like it has loose marbles
in it.  I know don't run it.  I will likely unhook it to avoid messing
it up.   The last question is what type of glue should I use to reattach
the sagging top seals.  They are in good condition but they are coming
loose from the fiber glass.   Will contact cement work?

Excuse me while I do little volkswagen dance.

I await your response.
If you can please call with advice 1-800-264-6757.
