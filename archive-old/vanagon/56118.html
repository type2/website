Subject: Re: If you've replaced your CV joints--please read

&gt; 	  I also noticed and  I'm not sure if this is true for all VW CV joints
&gt; but all of the ones I have done for VW buses are all marked with a date
&gt; of manufacter. Just in case your wondering if your CV joint is original
&gt; or not.  Mine were marked 12/82. Now one side is marked 5/79. 

This is true at least of all OEM Bus/Vanagon IRS CV's and all FWD VW
CV's I have seen.  Showed this fact to Steve Dolan the other weekend in 
fact, but here is a puzzler, I always assumed the marking was month/
year, but I got one downstairs marked 14/81, long year I guess, 
ideas?  The point about a Golf/Jetta CV has me sort of intrigued as 
well as I would never have guessed that or even looked, anybody know 
more specifically are they thicker? different in any manner?  What 
models/years, rabbit/golf/golf GTI are all different.  I ask as 
sometimes the FWD peoples prices get really appealing would be good 
to know.
