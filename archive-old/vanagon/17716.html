(snip)                               (Auburn Hills, MI VVWCA show)
 We also might be meeting with
a few people for VWOA on Monday after the show. Their Headquarters is only 40
minutes from  my house and I have already had two meetings with them this
Spring. It's an attempt on my part to maintain a good relationship with them.
Each year it gets better and better. You may have heard they are doing a survey
with various clubs throughout the US attempting to get imput into their
products. I have  sent mine in already, plus i have a copy of the first draft.
It's a smart move on their part. I see a much more cooperative attitude.
