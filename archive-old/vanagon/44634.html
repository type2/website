Subject: '71 with Kadron Carbs


I have recently acquired my second '71 Transporter/Camper. It comes with a 
fresh, stock engine (Tom Noble) and a pair of nearly new carbs, presumably 
Solex, sitting on Kadron intake manifolds. The previous owner advises that 
the carbs are too rich, to the point of jeopardizing the lubrication of the 
engine, and that the tank is so fouled with rust that he has needed to 
replace gasoline filters on a regular basis. The bus came with 1/2 dozen 
extra filters.

I've adjusted the timing to specs, 5 deg. ATDC, and checked the advance. I 
tuned the carbs as best I could using installation instructions given to me 
from the files of a local supplier : Autovice/Bow Wow.  These are all 
verbal, no pictures, and don't seem to exactly match what I see. What's 
more, the instructions say that the particular Kadron/Solex combination to 
which they apply are not suitable to engines with compression ratios above 
7.0. The VW service manual gives the 1600 engine's compression ratio as 7.5 
!

The engine backfires occasionally and the fuel flow to the carburetor 
appears to be weak, but the translucent in-line gasoline filter seems clean. 
On my first trip out of the driveway, I needed a tow home. It died in a 
cloud of smoke after going approximately 3 miles. The spark was present, but 
the engine wouldn't fire. It started running again, by itself, but I haven't 
ventured far since then.

I plan to check the fuel pump next. At the same time, I need some info on 
the carbs, please.  Are they appropriate to the engine? How does one 
identify them? Tune them? Are they worth keeping. What jet size is 
appropriate? Is there a place to write for manufacture's information? Any 
advice would help.
