Subject: Re:  what the stuff i get looks like (for nick and anybody else)

As I pointed out to the list maintainer (gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu - sorry, I
forgot your name...) I think the Reply-To: field should be the sender of the
message, not the list as a whole. We had a huge rash of replies about getting
the message from the list processor that should not have gone to the entire
list...
