Subject: Mirrors

Does anyone know if there is a concave (magnifying) mirror replacement for
the right side mirror on '80 Vanagons?  I'm getting really tired of looking
into that mirror and seeing only the hood ornament of the vehicle in the
other lane.  At night or in rainy weather, the mirror is nearly useless for
lane changes, and there's a humoungous blind spot.  I've tried a small
circular mirror glued onto the existing mirror, but it's too small to see
anything at a glance.
