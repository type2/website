   Bob or one of his people comes up here to NH every month during the =
summer for our Amherst Antique Auto Flea market.  This is held the last =
Sunday of every month from April till Oct.  Only once a summer does he =
bring up his Foreign car stuff... His VW stuff usually consists of a =
&quot;milk crate&quot; of Ads, Brochures, Dealer color charts.  Last summer they =
had an OEM full color KDF brochure... it measured 'bout 8&quot; x 15&quot;... =
absolutely beautiful! 'cept for the price... $795...

most of his prices are very reasonable and the Really Rare gems he picks =
up, well he knows what they're worth...

I picked up some kids activity books ( dealer giveaways from the early =
'60s) shaped like a Beetle for $5.00 each... I also picked up 2 Dealer =
brochures for the Type II from the late '50s, ya know the ones where all =
the Buses look like they've been chopped, channeled, and lowered... NOS =
for $8.00 each...

If you're into Literature, give them a call...  if he hasn't got it... =
he probably knows where you can get it...

	If all else fails, call Terry Schuler ( yeah, I don't really like some =
of the stuff he's pulled either...)
