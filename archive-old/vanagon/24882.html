&gt;Just heard from fellow listie, Fred, up in Alaska, who had some
&gt;insights on next year's trip to the top of the planet.  First, though,
&gt;he recommends Prudhoe Bay - isn't this further north than Inuvik?  Help!

the problem with Prudhoe is that the oil company runs it ... and you (the
civilian population) are not allowed to drive up to the Arctic Ocean. you
must turn around and head back 10 miles short of the shore. :(

of course, at Inuvik, you have a somewhat similar problem ... but it's
Mother Nature that stops you instead ... Inuvik is kinda back up a river
from the &quot;real&quot; ocean, and the little settlement that is out on the coast
(with a much longer name) is reachable only in the winter ... when the river
freezes over and makes a nice road.

supposedly the Prudhoe road also has worse trucks and bigger rocks. :(
