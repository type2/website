... aw, the hell with it!

&gt;In my '89 Syncro, there seems to be rain water leaking down past the
&gt;seals in each corner of the windshield, where a little low spot forms
&gt;from the angle between the glass and rubber.  Anybody have a hint about
&gt;sealing this up?

HINT!
3M (who else! :) makes some stuff perzactly for this problem. it's caused by
the gasket becoming older and drier (ain't we all?) and pulling away from the
metal of the body. the product is called

Heavy Drip-Chek Sealer     part no. 08531.  costs about $5 per tube, i think.
                           in a blue box.

you'll also need to pick up some 3M General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner,
part no. 08984, in a red quart can (about $7) to clean up any ooze/overkill.
and you'll need one of those smaller slippery-plastic Bondo spreaders.

what you do is to lift the edge of the rubber gasket (between the rubber and
the body metal, NOT the glass), and squeeze the Drip-Chek into the gap. as
you move the spreader-thingie and squeeze a bead of the Drip-Chek, the rubber
&quot;closes&quot; behind the spreader and squeezes the Drip-Chek into the leak/gap.
squeeze a good bit, not just a small bead. and you'll need to start ABOVE
where you think the leak is ... like about a foot or so UP the side of the
windshield.

the BEST thing, of course, is to get a new windshield rubber gasket. :)

&gt;There seems to be two rubber gaskets (or one gasket with a recess?)
&gt;separated by a plastic-covered metal band which runs the perimeter of
&gt;the windshield.  Does this band need replacing, reseating, etc.?  Or is
&gt;it the rubber gasket.  (I believe that the windshield in my van is the
&gt;original.)  Thanks for any tips!

the &quot;plastic-covered metal band&quot; is just plastic. no metal in it. it doesn't
do anything except decorate. but some people say that if you remove it, the
windshield will eventually pop out. eh? other folks say you can remove it and
it won't hurt anything. but taking it out won't stop your leak.
