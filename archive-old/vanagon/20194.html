&gt; &gt; Last i talked to everyone i was trying to sell my syncro.  We'll i just
&gt; &gt; couldn't do it!!  My wife is pissed, but i think she knows things would be
&gt; &gt; worse if i got rid of it.  My problem is that i'm due for emissions in
&gt; &gt; connecticut in a couple of weeks.  (connecticut has gotten really severe
&gt; &gt; concerning emissions). Last time thru i failed terribly and had to get
&gt; &gt; waived.  Of course this is after spending some big bucks and it still failed.
&gt; &gt; The dealer is no help, he said they all fail.  
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you could put on a fuel pressure regulator and reduce the fuel
&gt; pressure?  That should make it run leaner.  Anyone on the list have any
&gt; thoughts about that?  It might help if you posted your emissions
&gt; results to the list, so we could all see how it failed.

I agree with David.  Post your results.  Does it fail on hydrocarbons or CO 
and NOX as well?  If it is HC then it may be the catalytic convertor.  If it 
is running lean then use the mixture agjustor on the airflow sensor.  If you 
can't get it lean enough via the adjuster put and air leak in the pipe from t
he airflow sensorto the throttle plate. This is just what the adjuster screw 
does anyway, leting unmetered air by the sensor.  Use a high impedence 
voltmeter on the O2 sensor and bleed air in until she goes low and stays there.  Once it passes the test you can fiddle it back into shape.
