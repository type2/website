Subject: Late 1970's fuel injection 

Has anyone ever had any bad experiences with a late 70's type of fuel
injection unit?  I have one and everyone I talk to claims to be an expert
on them and I ahve heard every witch tale there is.  Can I now hear some
good news from the list pundits so I can put the thoughts to rest? ddd
