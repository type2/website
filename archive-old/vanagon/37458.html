Subject: Vanagon Westy Accessory Boxes..

Hi Everyone.  I was doing some checking while I was at the dealer today 
about the costs of these black accessory boxes.  I couldn't believe 
the costs of these parts.

City water .. $162.34CDN
water tank    $163.97CDN
electrical       $212.35CDN (for Canadian Westy's only)
the above includes gaskets

Yesterday, I received a fax from Euro-American RV Products (Delta-Six 
Industries). This is the company that makes the parts for 
VW/Westfalia.   Here are their prices:

city water  $29.50 US
water tank $35.50 US
electrical    $32.50 US (for US Westy's only)
electrical    $34.00 US (for Canadian Westy's only)
gaskets       $4.24 US each

So, hmm.. even with a 35% exchange rate, shipping, even duty.. errr.. 
there's a bit of a savings here!!!

For those new to the list, Euro-American can be reached at:

Euro-American RV Products,
