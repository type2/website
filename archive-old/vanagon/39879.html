&gt;Easiest if you check out the NEATO web site - it contains info on datind and
&gt;deciphering plates and also has paint codes M nos model nos ..and a whole
&gt;bunch of intersting stuff. 

Dave is talking about http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html
I had used that site to decode the optional equipment and paint codes,
and to confirm that the first three digits of the VIN indicated it was
a Standard Microbus, RH Cargo Doors, LH Drive, so a big thanks to Dave 
Easterwood and the rest of NEATO. But there is no build sequence or
year of manufacture data. 

A few people have pointed me in the direction of the vehicle differences 
on Skips server: 
http://killer-whale.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/early-diffs.html,
and that is where I first looked.  But the vehicle (clearly a 64-67)
ID 22-1308189 does not &quot;compute&quot; with any of the initial three digit codes 
cited on that page :
1964 1-222-500
1965 215-nnn-nnn
1966 216-nnn-nnn
1967 217-nnn-nnn

There is a clue, however, in that a difference cited for 1965s (and later): 
&gt; 5)  Chassis number changed to reflect model type (bus, pickup, etc.) If this is true, the first three digits for 65-67 would not be all the
same for each year, but would vary to reflect the specific model,
as per the NEATO model numbers at: 
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/model.html 

I found in the archives that Jim Bryant also pointed this out last November.
This starts making sense. If true, 22-1208189 would be correct number for a '65
or later Standard, RH Doors, LH Drive, and you would think the last six digits
are sequential build numbers.

Anyway, your eyes are all glazing over and I still don't know the year of the subject 
bus. I think its not a '64 because it has the later VIN format, and not a '67
because it has the square key lock on the gas filler. So '65 or '66. Maybe the family 
will find the paperwork, and solve the mystery, or next time I visit, I'll check
the engine number and the rear deck lid lift.

(Hmmm. Lots of buses have the undeciphered M-code of 425, and Dave Easterwood
thinks it might be walk-thru seat belts. Since this bus is not a walk through
and has a 426 code, it kinda makes sense. However, it also has 025, lap
belt anchors, which may just refer to the rear seats)
