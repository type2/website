Subject:      flush the cooling system?

Hi, gang, and many thanks for all the fascinating info about coolants!

I acquired Prestone phosphate-free long-life at Pep Boys (Wal-Mart was
out, and PB honored their lowest price policy with Wal-Mart as their
&quot;competitor&quot;!).  While there, I also picked up some Prestone Super
Flush, but now I have misgivings.  To wit:

SHOULD I FLUSH THE VANAGON COOLING SYSTEM WITH THIS STUFF?

If so, any tips on how?

Thanks for your input!!!
