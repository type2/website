&gt;Mitch,
&gt;
&gt;I didn't mean to set your hair on fire.  You're the mechanic-in-charge,  the
&gt;person closest to the task.  Whatever your decision, once it's made I'll back
&gt;you up ...  within reason :-) so long as I know you're aware of the options
&gt;and consequences.
&gt;


Yes, and next time use a stapler when your pants split (If you were a real
engineer, you'd know that one).
