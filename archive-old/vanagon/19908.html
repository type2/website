&gt;&gt;you guys ever seen an 8-gauge wire evaporate in front of your eyes?? that

Once I saw a worker in his auto battery shop testing a fully charged brand
new car battery. I did not see him pulling a meter or tester anything like
that. Instead he hooked up one end of a jumper to one end of the battery.
The jumper is the kind we use when our cars do not go and had to beg others
to give us a jump start, you know what I am talking about.

The guy grabed the other end and hit the other end of the battery. It's like
a thunder in front of you, a momentary white out. Before I realized what
happened he disconnected the jumper and picked that battery for a sale to
a customer.
