Subject: RE: Westy Pop-Tops in the wind

Poptoppers,

I have no solutions, but I can add some of my own frustration on this 
topic.  The latch that holds the front of the pop top down on 68-71 
Westies does not look mysterious, but it is a mystery to me how they are 
able to work properly.  There is a length of metal (arm) attatched to the 
front of the pop top that hooks behind a metal clip that is bolted to the 
roof behind the front windshield.  On my 70 poptop, the arm/clip assembly 
was steel and on my 71 it is aluminum.  The front of my poptop lifts a few 
inches at highway speed.  I admit that I have yet to install the roof rim 
gasket that I bought from WCM, although I am not convinced this will solve 
the problem entirely due to the loose fit of the arm and clip even with 
the clip adjusted as far back against the arm as possible.
  
The aluminum arm on the 71 poptop is curved to mate with the curved 
aluminum clip bolted to the roof.  The clip part is adjustable from front 
to back by loosening 2 10mm bolts (if I remember correctly).  The problem I 
have is even when I adjust the clip as far back as I can to maintain 
pressure against the arm part on the poptop, either the poptop arm won't 
close down behind the clip as it should or the resulting fit is to loose to 
hold it down securely.

Has anyone overcome this with maybe some strategically placed shims or 
anything???? My theory is that over time these aluminum pieces wear enough 
through bending to be rendered useless.  Any guidance on this would be much 
appreciated.


Thanks,

Ron
