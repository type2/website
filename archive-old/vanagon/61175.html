Subject: quick belt question.

Hi,

My Power steeing is making some serious noise when cranked and driving
slow (it has been since i bought the van).  My mechanic offered to flush
the system for a cool $80, said it could be the filter.  Last weekend I
flushed and replaced the filter on my own, but I still have the whine.

The PS pump was replaced a year ago (have receipts) but it looks like it
was remaned.  I guess it could be bad, but then I noticed that the belt
connected to the PS pump look be on inside out.  Does it matter which
way a belt is installed (sorry for the ignorance)?  The other belts in
plain view have the smooth side of the belt pointed outward.  The belt
connected to PS pump had the 'grove' side pointed outward.  Is this
sucker on inside out??

thanks,

jeff
