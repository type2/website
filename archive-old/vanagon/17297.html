Subject: Re: handling on pre '68


&gt;Now that my bus is on the road, I've noticed the handling isn't quite 
&gt;what I would like it to be.
&gt;I think this is because of the apparent slack in the steering wheel.  I can
&gt;turn the wheel a couple inches in both directions without any perceptable
&gt;change in direction.

Get a buddy to help you.  Crawl under your bus (remove front breast 
plate if you have one).  Have your friend turn the steering wheel back 
&amp; forth from the points you feel there is slack.  Watch closely at the 
steering box and the drag link which is attached to it.  If the drag 
link moves correctly along with the steering box, look farther back to 
where the link pin is.  The link pin is what transfers the back &amp; forth 
direction from the drag link to the side to side direction of the tie 
rods.  There should be NO PLAY at all in the link pin.  If there is, 
this is where your problem lies.

In most of my buses (I've had a few) I have found this is where 90% of
steering problems are.  The brass bushing wears out over time.  You will
have to take the pin out, press out the old bushing, press in the new 
bushing, ream the new bushing out for the new pin, and press in the new
pin.  Sounds simple, but it takes me about 4-5 hours to do it.  Link pin
repair kits run from about $28 Brazil to $40 German.  Don't just replace
pin, as most wear will be in the softer brass bushing.

If it's not in the link pin, look at your tie rod ends as your friend
turns the steering wheel to see if the play is at the ends.  Also check
your steering dampner.  I think the only way the dampner could help is
if there is a problem somewhere else, it helps hold things steady.

Hope some of this info is helpful to you.

Dave
