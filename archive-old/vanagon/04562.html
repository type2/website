&gt; 	I agree. I've tried to convince my sister to go thie above route.
&gt; 	But, like most buyers, she's dazzled by the Previa's shape, meaning
&gt; 	the functionality of the MV/Weekender doesn't prioritize over looks.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I work with someone that traded an '8* something camper for an MV
&gt; 	with weekender pkg. (poptop/12V fridge/aux. battery) and while he
&gt; 	says sometimes they miss the cook hardware, having more seat room 
&gt; 	and more window square footage is better for a family of 4+.
&gt;

Yeah, it's amazing how people are easily seduced by a sleezy looking
car and never think of the practical side.  I'm guilty of this.  Sometimes
I'd like to just trade in the Westy and get a 911, but the practical 
side always seems to win out.  And I can't afford both.  Besides that,
If I get a third car, it'll have to be a pick-up.
