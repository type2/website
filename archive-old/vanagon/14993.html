&gt;I have a air conditioning unit that mounts on the interior roof of a '78 bus,
&gt;unfortunately i don't have the motor anymore.  Also, for sale are two bench
&gt;seats and some seat belts (non-retractable).  If interested get in touch with
&gt;me soon, as i will be closing my computer account within the next few weeks.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

thanks zyno_at_infi_dot_net
