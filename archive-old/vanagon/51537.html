Hey all,
The mileage figures are in.  '81 Westy, and in 162.2 miles of city
driving (almost no highway drivng at all), I managed to use 10.5 gallons
of gas (as measured at fill-up tonight) for a grand total of 15.4
whoppin' miles per gallon.  That seems kinda low, but then again we are
talking a Vanagon Westy with a little teensy air-cooled engine pushing
it around, so I will ask the list gurus.  How's the city mileage on your
air-cooled Vanagon Westies?  What can I expect it to improve to in
highway driving?

Thanks a lot,
Sean
