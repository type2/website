Subject: Re: Reenforced Deluxe splitties (also soundproofing buses)



&gt;According to other members of SOTO, the belly pans under the corgo doors
&gt;came on all year bus's that had either a sunroof or double doors.  it was
&gt;to reinforce the body.

Anybody have a set of these (or singles) that would fit a '71 bus? I've
been trying to soundproof this creature forever, with limited success,
and these sound like they may help, especially with lots of fiberglas
packed up inside  under the floorboards.

If you have some, or know of some, please let me know!  $$$!

BTW, the most effective soundproof material I've run across to date,
is the one-inch-thick two-layer foam with Mylar backing available from
JC Whitney, part number 15BT8489P in their catalog number 579J, page 94.
Expensive, tho-- nearly $60 for a 32&quot;x54&quot; sheet. Sometimes it appears
in their sale catalogs, for somewhat less. I bought two sheets, and
used 3M contact cement to fasten it all around the inside of the
engine compartment. Some of the cement is coming loose-- I should
have paid more attention to the warning ot the can that said &quot;high
heat resistant-- but let it cure for at least 72 hours before
exposing to temps higher than 150 F.&quot;

Lots of carpeting helps, too, both on the floor and over the engine
compartment, with dense foam underneath. &quot;Sound board&quot; from the local
lumber yard, didn't seem to do much. Gonna carpet the walls next!
