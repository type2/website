Subject: 87' Wolfsburgs ??help!

I have a few questions on my 87'Wolfsburg, feel free to fill me in on
what you know, thanks everyone!

1) What is the usual RPM say if I am travelling/crusing on a level road
at 60mph    with one passenger on a 87'vanagon with AT.?

2) What is the big slot like screw on the trottle body for?

3) How does one adjust the CO% mixture and idle speed on the Vanagon?

4) How do I test if the fuel injector switches? Volt or Ohm meter?

5) How do I know if I have tighten the PS, AC and the alternator
belts     too tight or loose?

6) Will it make any difference if I install a K&amp;N air filter element?

7) My motor still misses a little despite new plugs,rotor,cap?

Thanks for any help anyone can give!
