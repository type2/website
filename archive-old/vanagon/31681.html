FYI,  The Water Boxer Crankshaft is actually a likeness of the type 4 crank.
 The cam and valve train is similar to the type 1 except for the lifters.  In
fact ratio rockers for a type 1 and a late model (71+ up) oil pump will fit
and work perfectly.  For high performance use, type 4 solid lifters and push
rods to eliminate problems with the hydraulics.
