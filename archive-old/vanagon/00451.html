]only trouble is, it's 'instantaneous' mpg, not average for the whole tank.

I genuinely don't understand this.  My '84 wasserboxer is stock, except for
being kinda ragged out and running like crap just off idle part of the time
(not consistent enough for the guys at MotorMania to find it).  I figure it
to be anything but optimum.

Because my youngest goes to school in Galveston and drives a 200SX with no
packing room, I get to make the round trip from Austin everytime he needs
to move anything, in addition to going down there whenever we want to visit
him.  When I'm in a hurry (which is usually) I run an indicated 85 mpg most
of the way; when I'm not I usually run an indicated 75 mpg most of the way.
Some of these trips involve running loaded one way (and all his aquarium
gear amounts to a real load) and many involve running the A/C all the way.

I can no longer recall which trips I've measured the mileage on to match up
with the conditions I just described (I've not checked the past few trips),
but I have measured it at least three times and have always been over 24
mpg.

For comparison, the last time I checked fuel usage around town I got around
19 mpg, but then I tend to drive boxer VWs with the pedal to the floor just
about all the time, a habit I developed with my old '58 bug.

So what gives?  Why am I getting better fuel economy than Joel?  If the 
best Joel can get is 23 mpg, I ought to be getting 13.
