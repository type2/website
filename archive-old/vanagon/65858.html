Chris, I'm having the same problem with my 86 Syncro. I thought it would
be the ignition switch so I tried moving it a little to see if the lights
would come on, didn't. So then I tried jiggling the rocker switch for the
lights and found that if I moved the switch slightly back form the &quot;on&quot;
position the lights would come on. I suppose I'll have to buy a new
switch someday.
