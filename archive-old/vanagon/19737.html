Subject: valves: what's with them..?
Date: Mon, 26 Jun 1995 21:43:38 -0500 (CDT)

What makes valves go out of adjustment? Is it mostly just stretching and
contracting? 

Less generally, why would a valve suddenly get tight? (the engine
was rough and I found #4 intake valve had 0 gap.)

Grateful for any insights.
