michael&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I was glancing through my favorite book this morning--Webster's 9th
&gt;Edition Dictionary--and I stumbled across some definitions for 'deadhead'.
&gt;I found them interesting:
&gt;
&gt;'one who has not paid for a ticket' (This could relate to the Grateful Dead!)
&gt;
&gt;'a dull or stupid person'  (nothing personal to anyone intended 8-)  )
&gt;
&gt;'to make a return trip without a load' (I guess this could be VW-related)
&gt;
&gt;Just a thought for the day I guess.  8-)
&gt;
