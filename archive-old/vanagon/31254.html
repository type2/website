Subject: DC Holiday Fest Report

     Last Sunday DC area listmembers gathered at my home for a little
     party, and to get to meet the faces behind the _at_ signs.

     It turned out to be an all vanagon-owner event, although Tom
     Carrington drove over in his '65 Type III notchback for a dose of
     the olden, aircooled and 6 volt days, leaving his '88 Vanagon at home.
     Patrick Egan &amp; Tara Mulligan came by in a nifty '86 Crewcab. There
     were three 1990 Syncro Westies: Tom Forhan and Michele Moriarty's
     silver, Rick &amp; Wendy Koller's blue, and Pat Horrocks' burgundy (easily
     confused with Drew's). For a little variety Forrest &amp; Lorraine Minor
     bought their '85 Weekender, and to increase the Syncro count to four,
     my DOA '87 Syncro GL was present.

     Show and tell was fun. The Crewcab got a good going over, this was
     originally a Canadian vehicle, and has some very interesting
     differences from the buses. I liked the &quot;Transporter&quot; badge on the
     rear.  We all considered the hole in the case of the  DOA Syncro,
     examined Pat's nifty front mounted collapsable platform for carring
     bikes and haybales, came to understand what a Weekender really was,
     and decided that we had the world record for Syncro Westies in one
     spot. Tom C's notchback was sweet, though we wondered why he parked on
     the downhill ;-).

     All in all, it was a great opportunity to meet each other, and a fun
     time was had by all. I think I got Pat convinced to come to the Range
     Rover Test Area, just so she would know what to do if she got caught
     out somewhere...
