Subject: RE: 87 now has round eyes




&gt;Reckon I'll cc the list on this since it's the second inquiry. I'm 
&gt;going to hang on to all the parts I replaced with my headlight 
&gt;swap.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Mark :
&gt;&gt; Want to sell your square headlight hardware?

I have a square headlight set available. I was going to convert my 
'85 Westy to square headlights, using all of the parts on my '87 
parts Vanagon.  When I asked about this on the list, a few people 
recommended that I buy a pair of round non-sealed-beam headlights 
instead.  Well, I just sent my old ('76) parts bus to the junkyard 
(to make room for the '87), and, lo and behold, when I removed the 
headlights to save them, they turned out to be the type that was 
recommended on the list!  They've been sitting in my driveway on my 
parts bus for the last year, and I never knew it! Just put them on 
my '85, and they are in fact noticably brighter than the stock 
headlights.

That being the case, I will not be using the square headlights, 
grill, etc. on the '87 after all. If anyone wants to buy these 
items (preferably as a package), please E-mail me directly.
