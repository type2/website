Subject: Re: showers at wailaki

well I have to admit it, I broke down.
Last week Susie and I went to Mel Cotton's Sporting goods in San Jose and we
bought a privacy tent.
It is a 6' by 3' by 3' blue box with poles. It would be ideal for your
portable shower, We have something elase that is portable inside the blue
lagoon.
