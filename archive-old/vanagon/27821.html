&gt; &gt;The kit will give you a whopping extra 2311cc in capacity (to around 19100cc
&gt; &gt;from memory) and is probably the biggest bang for buck you can get with a
&gt; &gt;1700.
&gt; 
&gt; 19,100cc's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     WOW!!!!!!!              I WANT ONE OF
&gt; THOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you imagine how fast the Westy would go with this?

Reminds me of an old George Carlin skit.  If you had everything, where 
would you put it?  Same thing here, the engine would fill the whole van!  
The other problem you'd have is keeping tires on it...
