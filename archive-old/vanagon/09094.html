&gt; My 72 bus had windows on the side of the canvas in the pop top so I could
&gt; look out. Neat!
&gt; 
&gt; My 90 bus does not have these windows. It has only the window in the end.
&gt; Bummer!

Just a tidbit of information... the new Car and Driver has an article about
the 95 Eurovan camper (Winnebago) and they give it high marks for its
&quot;panoramic view&quot; out of the windows in the pop top.  They also printed a
few letters from people that thought the guy who would buy the Eurovan (if
he could have any vehicle he wanted) was insane.  Might be worth the $3 or
so to pick up this issue for the Eurovan content...
