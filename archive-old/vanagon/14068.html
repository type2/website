Subject: Stainless steel exhaust systems.

All I know about VW stainless steel exhaust systems is that they have had 
limited prodution of it...I'm not sure from which point in time it was 
available, and it sure isn't anything they advertise...all I do know is that 
my 91 Vanagon GL has it as an option from VW...considering that mine was a 
special order and built in Austria's VW plant. It has a 10 year warranty on 
the life of the muffler so hopefully a baffle goes at around 9 1/2 years so 
I can get a renewed version...my coisin works in Germany's VW headquarters 
and said it may be a political thing to do with stainless steel exhaust not 
being the norm for mordern autos, can anyone come up with a more likely 
reason why this is so.
