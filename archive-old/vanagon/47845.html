Subject: Koolatron

I've been reading the archives on the subject of Koolatrons, and was
wondering if anyone has any more recent experiences with these, and/or
their klones. I see at least two powered cooler/warmers on the market
now, Coleman and another one, but both those have moving parts, not the
solidstate device the Koolatron has.
  What I would really like is an insert version that I could put in my
'73 Westy icebox. I saw one post by someone named Chris
(ATVenture_at_aol_dot_com) but mail to him bounced. He was offering to sell one
of the insert versions. Other than that one, I haven't even seen an
insert model advertised anywhere. Does anyone know where to get them?
   Yes, I know they don't work that great, but I figure with a few solar
panels on the roof and a good deep cycle battery bank it would be &quot;good
enough&quot;. 

  I don't get the list direct, so hit &quot;r&quot; instead of &quot;g&quot; (group). 8-)
