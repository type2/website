Subject: Re: Bus as primary residence...

     As, this brings back the sweet(?) memories, when I lived in my
     '62 Deluxe in the campus parking lot, close to the gym, for toilets,
     showers and the sauna. I did have to move around because of the
     campus police, and for a while worked out a truce of sorts. Somehow
     the Deans office got word of my domicile, and I got called in...I
     pleaded that it was the only way I could attend college, and, after a
     bit, they GAVE me a vacant dorm room for the rest of the year, when I
     graduated!

     These days, don't forget state parks and the like, some legal camping
     spots are close in to our cities. There is always the campground of
     last resort, the dreaded KOA - and let me tell you, there are always
     working people there living on the cheap.
