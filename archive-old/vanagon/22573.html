Subject: Need Eurovan Info, Please Help.

I was just about to write a trip report.  After spending 4 wonderful
days around Acadia National Park and Maine in general,  I got back to
work on Wed., and am finally catching up with mail.

Due to a last minute surprise the '87 weekender served us, we had to
take the EV for the trip.  This meant having to buy an extra tent, and
sleeping in it rather than the quite comfortable bed of the weekender.
Oh well, the tent was not so bad.

When passenger side coolant hose that connects the cylinder head to
the plastic (yeah, Joel, you're right)pipe that goes all the way to
the radiator blew on the '87, there was less than 24 hrs to find the
part and put it in, among all other stuff I had to do, so, the EV got
the nod.  

In short, the EV eagerly swallowed the 1,450 miles we drove on (2x650
plus driving around in the region), got 20.5 mpg (with two bikes
strapped on a front carrier and speeds usually around 75 mph and the
stop-and-go yuppie traffic around Freeport (LL Bean Land), where my
wife insisted on stopping at least once :-(

During our stay there, we took to some of the many trails, the kids
tried their climbing skills on the rocks by the shore.  We went whale
watching once (not as great a show as saw a few years earlier, but it
still felt great to be on the ocean), and also did some shopping at
the local tourist traps.  

I'd like to thank to all of you who replied for the great bunch of
information -- also those of you who said 4 days were not enough were
right -:(  .  There was a sign on I-95 on the way back that read:
  &quot;If your Business were in Maine, You'd be home by now&quot;
Hmmm... maybe they have a point.  As things are, I think we'll try and
go back there again for a longer stay -- not that many
software/hardware/Telecomm companies in Maine yet :-(


This weekend we camp in PA -- Oh well, you take what you can get...

Have a nice weekend everyone....

In response to the query, I think the only thing to check for is the
excessive &quot;piston slap&quot; problem some of the earlier EVs had.  This is
very noticeable when the engine is started from a cold state -- it
sounds like a diesel engine.  Other than that, the EV seems to be a
veryreliable, powerful and utilitarian vehicle at 33,000 miles.

Oh, also, in one of the problems you list
in question #2:  The rear A/C somehow failed in my EV also.  It was
replaced while under warranty.

 &gt; First, to all who responded to &quot;Should I Buy&quot;, your responses are greatly 
 &gt; appreciated and very helpful.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Update, I did not buy that '93 GL, at least not yet, I'm trying to let 
 &gt; the dealer simmer for a while.  So far I've only been able to get them 
 &gt; down to 15,600 from 15,900, kinda irritating.
 &gt; 
 &gt; However, I did find a '93 MV about two hours away.  I went and checked it 
 &gt; out last night.  It has 36,000 miles, is in generally good shape and they 
 &gt; are asking $17,000 for it.  I haven't been able to contact the original 
 &gt; owner yet and the dealers story is that a 50 year old woman owned it and 
 &gt; traded it in on a Passat.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Here is my problem, I have only driven three Eurovans, this being the 
 &gt; third.  One was a stick and the others were automatics.  The long and the 
 &gt; short being that I do not have a feel for these things yet.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Question #1 --
 &gt; I don't remember how the other Eurovan with an automatic that I drove 
 &gt; felt, but the MV that I'm looking at (and really, really want) seemed 
 &gt; kind indecisive about which gear to use, and jerked quite a bit when 
 &gt; changing gears.  Could this be the reason this MV is $1,500 cheaper than 
 &gt; any others I have found? Is this anything normal or characteristic?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Question #2 --
 &gt; Regarding the dual A/C, the air in this one felt great in the front just 
 &gt; like the other ones, but the rear A/C blower seemed kind weak.  Here 
 &gt; again I don't really have anything to compare it to.  Can the rear air be 
 &gt; diverted to other vents, reducing the flow?  Could it be all six roof 
 &gt; vents being open, that makes it seem like it dosen't blow that hard?
 &gt; What are your experiences with this?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Question #3 --
 &gt; What temperature do the engines usually run at?  Most the time while 
 &gt; driving the MV it hovered about the half-way mark. Then I let it idle for 
 &gt; about ten minutes in hot FL with both A/C's running.  The temp rose to 
 &gt; about 3/4 and stabilized.  Is that about right?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Question #4 --
 &gt; Has anybody had any CV Joint experiences with these things are they more 
 &gt; difficult to change that Vanagon CV's?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Question #5 --
 &gt; I really want to pull a 19 foot boat with this thing, does anybody have 
 &gt; any towing experiences with the EV, and is a stick or automatic better?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Any responses would be greatly appreciated.  I really don't want to pour 
 &gt; $17,00 down the drain.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thanks,
