Subject: Fire Extinguisher: C02 or Halon?

Jimmy Cohen and Dennis Haynes have pointed out to me that if I use my ABC
fire extinguisher in my van to put out a fire, the damage it does will
likely be worse than having a fire in the first place.

Accordingly, I plan to get a C02 fire extinguisher as Dennis recommended but
I seem to remember than Halons are even better somehow.

Anybody have a take on whether this is true and whether I should shoot for
Halon?
