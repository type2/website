Subject: T2 early turn signal ground spades?

	Tiny progress on Little Martha over the weekend- I installed
the front turn-signals with new seals and cleaned and Armor-All'ed the
lenses before attaching them. Ian picked up the signal bodies and lenses
for me in a junk yard and one has a ground wire spade, the other does not.

	Did VW drop the ground spade from the original T2 turn signals?
(These are the down-low version, not the later T2 signals up by the vent
grille) Or did the spade that I should have there come adrift? For those who
haven't explored this region, the body of the turn-signal is a galvanized
steel stamping held by 2 big sheet metal screws to brackets recessed
in the body. The bulb reflector/socket assembly is riveted to the
galvanized body, and on one signal, a spade for the ground is sandwiched
under the rivet on the back side. 

	On the other turn signal, there's no spade and no evidence there
ever was one- no broken-off piece, no slop in the rivets. I think the
spade-less assembly had the less faded lens, suggesting that it's either
newer or has been better cared for...

	The wiring harness has the usual two lugs for the turn-signal
and the parking light, and a separate, brown, wire for ground. I suppose
the ground current could flow through the big sheet-metal screws into
the body, but that strikes me as a poor way of doing business. If I
put my own ground spade on the presently groundless turn signal, I think
I'd drill a hole, bolt it on and then solder the bolt.
