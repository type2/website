Subject: Suspicious Syncro Shifting Symptoms

&gt;On my '89 Syncro (95K miles) the shifting has actually gone beyond the
&gt;suspicious stage - I really should have said &quot;Sh*tty Syncro Shifting
 ....
&gt;1) Since I got the van in October, it's sometimes been just a tad
reluctant to downshift into 2nd or 1st (hard to find the &quot;slot&quot;), but
I've never any problem upshifting.
.....
&gt;depressed.  A few times the van has actually begun moving slightly as
the engine starts up, as if the clutch pedal is not really depressed all
the way...
