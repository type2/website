Subject:      15&quot; syncro tires

Hi all:  I hate to bring the tire subject up again but I was wondering
if anyone has found a 15 inch tire that would work on a syncro Westy. I
am about to put 15 inch wheels on my Westy if I can locate a tire that
will work. I intend to do a lot of shopping for the right tire. It would
certainly help if someone has already found something that will work.
Thanks
