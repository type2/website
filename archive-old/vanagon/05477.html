Subject: Re: Drinking Water Dump Valve


&gt; Dave, 
&gt; 
...
&gt; 
&gt; All we need now is an electric valve positioned in the bottom of the drinking
&gt; water tank which will open should the water reach 34 degrees or below. This
&gt; way, we would never have to worry about the drinking water freezing on us
&gt; during those periods that the vehicle is not being driven, and hence not
&gt; warming the water.

Speaking of the water tank drain, does anyone know where one can get a 
replacement cap for these.  They use a Metric thread in the ~25 mm range
and I can't find one locally.  The dealer wants around $35 for these little 
jewels.

Anyone know of a source for an 81 Westfalia more reasonable (not hard to
do) than the dealer?
