A few days ago you wrote:
&gt;Just a quick note that the 1-owner '89 Westy that I posted to the list some 
&gt;time ago is still for sale.  Excellent condition, fully loaded, Kelley Blue 
&gt;Book value is $16,200, asking $12,500.  Email me 
&gt;directly for a full description.
We may be interested. We are definitely wanting a vanagon westy (my ideal 
would be an 87 synchro), timing may be a factor here (too long to 
explain). Where are you in PA?  How many miles on it? on current engine? 
tell me everything it has (options, standard etc.)  Tell me everything it 
needs (besides a new owner). BTW- What color is the interior?  Have you 
always had this van in PA?
Thanks
