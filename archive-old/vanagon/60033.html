 Does anybody have the opinion that these A/C lines/relays need to be
 ventilated?   &gt;&gt;

These electrical A/C components (fuses, relays, pressure switches,
lots-o-wire) in my non-Westy Vanagons don't have any apparent source of
ventillation air.  I doubt that this could make any significant distance.
 Perhaps in moving the wiring you provided an inadvertant short to ground?

Good luck,
