&gt;Everybody, keep in mind that Cory's talking about mounting a &quot;Carat&quot; V-gon

&gt;Also, I would imagine, if one was to purchase a set of used Vanagon &quot;Carat&quot;
&gt;style 5 spoke alloys, they would be smart enough to get the lug nuts and bolts
&gt;too, therefore your problem would be solved......

When I bought my 87 syncro a couple of years ago I also picked up a set of
Carat alloy wheels. I DID NOT have to replace any of the studs to mount the
alloy wheels..
