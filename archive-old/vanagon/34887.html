&gt;
&gt;Got a problem..		
&gt;
&gt;There is an intermittent short in the engine electrical system that results
&gt;in 
&gt;a 
&gt;dramatic loss of power.  The condition lasts for 15 to 20 secs and
disappears
&gt;
&gt;to again 	
&gt;reappear at irregular intevals.
&gt;
&gt;Problem:
&gt;	*only occures in the rain or snow(wet snow).
&gt;	*only after engine is warmed up
&gt;	*checked engine with water spray at night repeatedly, seemed ok.  One 
&gt;time got a 
&gt;	  real shorting condition..looked like a xmas tree with shorting along 
&gt;sparkplug
&gt;	  wires.
&gt;	
&gt;Fix attempts: 
&gt;	*steam cleaned engine to eliminate dirt trails
&gt;	*replaced plug wires, distributor cap, rotor
&gt;	*installed std plugs in place of resistor plugs
&gt;	*shielded plug wires with hose to reduce shorting potential
&gt;	
&gt;Above fix(s) cleared up the problem for entire summer (6months) even with 
&gt;driving in major rain storms.  
&gt;
&gt;Come the late fall and the problem came back !#?...
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts or suggestions?????
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

Problem is probably not ignition related.  Check the connections to the O2
sensor,  temp sensor, and all low voltage grounds.  See if you have a groung
wire connected at the base of the crankcase breather.  If so, move it to a
solid metal connection.  This wire is the reference ground for the O2 sensor
circuit.  Any voltage drop here renders the system in operable causing al
sorts of grief.  Also check that your O2 sensor is working properly.  It can
become intermittant and become affected by weather.  Especially if the sensor
heater is not working.
