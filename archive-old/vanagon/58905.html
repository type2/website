&lt;&lt; Question to any other '87 Syncro owners:
 	My Syncro does not have a differential switch.  I thought that all
 Syncros '87 and up come equipped with a switch.  Does anyone else share
 my switchlessness?  AND  It is possible for me to retrofit a switch? --  &gt;&gt;

No.  I don't think the rear differential locks were standard until '89 or
'90.  Until then they were optional.

Yes.  It is possible to retrofit a switch, but not easy or cheap.  The switch
isn't the tough part, but the locking differential that the switch activates
is.  The easiest way to do as retrofit would be to replace your current
transmission with one that has the differential lock.  Quite costly though.
