Subject: Re: Drain Plug? What's a Drain Plug?

I've got the same round plate on my '71 engine. I like it, since it forces
one to at least expose the filter/screen...and while it's exposed, you
can't pass on examining it...you know for little metal shavings and such.
I'll admit that changing oil's always a little messier, but whatever
spills on me, I rub between my fingers feeling for signs of grit.

&gt; All this discussion of drain plugs reminded me of an oddness I
&gt; encountered on the Wombat ('58 microbus, roughly a '71 engine).
&gt; There's the usual round plate underneath the engine where you'd expect
&gt; to find a drain plug, but it's a smooth plate -- no hole for a drain
&gt; plug.  The plate itself is held on by the usual handful of studs, and
&gt; looks to have been made this way.  Almost like somebody didn't get
&gt; around to drilling and tapping a hole for the plug.
&gt; 
&gt; The questions become:
&gt; 
&gt; - does this seem weird to anyone else?
&gt; - why would you want to have such a plate?
&gt; - would there be any harm in replacing it with a normal one (this is
&gt;   probably covered by the answer to the previous question)?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
