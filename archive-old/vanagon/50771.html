&gt; &lt;&lt; 
&gt;  The engine is running very rich during idle and haphazardly hesitates to
&gt;  accelerate from a stop.  These symptoms have resulted in.
&gt;  
&gt;  1.      hesitation from stop to first
&gt;  2.	hesitation from first to second (happens less frequently than #1)
&gt;  3.	high hydro carbon emissions readings
&gt;  4.	high carbon dioxide emissions readings
&gt;  5.      very bad gas mileage.  
&gt;  
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; Me thinks your problem is a bad O2 or temparature sensor.  A bad throttle
&gt; switch will not cause the above conditons.  I would also make sure that all
&gt; the grounds are good. I would definately repalce the leaking fuel system
&gt; parts.  Do not attempt to repair those crimp ends.  There could also be
&gt; another problem but check those basic things first.  Also check that the fuel
&gt; pressure regulator does not have a ruptured diaphram.  Check by disconecting
&gt; the vacuum hose. If there is any fuel there at all, the regulator is bad.

The bad O2 sensor is a good bet. I wish I'd thought of the fuel regulator
as well -- I need to check this on mine!  Find another mechanic.  A sticking
throttle should not cause the rich mixture, but a bad O2 sensor certainly
could.  Make sure there are no exhaust leaks as well -- these let air into
the exhaust system, and the computer thinks the mixture is too lean.  This
is a similar situation to a bad O2 sensor.  Disconnect the O2 sensor and
see if it runs better (the single wire if yours gots three!).  Fix the
fuel leak, too, but this also should not cause it to run rich.

Damn, but I love VW dealers!  They work soooo hard to encourage the old
fix-it-yourself batch of yay-hoos like me.  I guess they feel like you
were sucker enough to buy a VW in the first place.  Didn't they try to
sell you a new one?
