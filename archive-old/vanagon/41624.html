Subject: RE: Water Pumper Head Corrosion

assuming it is galvanic attack, one needs to know which is the anode.  the
stud or ...?

in the case of pipes in the ground i recall from explanation by a power
engineer i work with that the underground pipe is biased w/ a low voltage
(~1Vdc) to make the pipe the cathode.  That way it plates up instead of
being the sacrificial element and plating out into the earth.

&gt;&gt;I think this trick works only if the current flows in the right direction.
&gt;&gt;Saltwater boats use it to protect their propellors etc. from galvanic
&gt;&gt;corrosion (not from chemical saltwater corrosion as I recall). A current
&gt;&gt;does inhibit galvanic action... but a current in the wrong direction
&gt;&gt;*accelerates* the galvanic corrosion!
&gt;
&gt;Basic point was, I have a hunch that a simple ground strap from heads
&gt;to cylinder, wouldn't help, and might even hurt, by promoting current
&gt;flow in the wrong direction. Maybe if you could somehow put a battery
&gt;and resistor, in a circuit including the head and cylinder (if those
&gt;two are indeed isolated), and so created an electrical potential in the
&gt;right direction between head and cylinder, then it might have some positive
&gt;effect (no pun intended) (well, not much).
&gt;
&gt;Any physical chemists out there? They would know far more about the
&gt;validity of this effect, if any. Of course, I think my 6-year-old son
&gt;also knows more than I about galvanic corrosion sometimes...  :-\
