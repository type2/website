Subject: '73 ventwing Part#s

All,

Is there someone out there who can look up some
partnumbers for me?

I need the VW partnumbers of the L&amp;R ventwings in the doors,
the numbers of the complete assemblies including rubbers.
Or, the collection of partnumbers they consist of. The car is a
'73 SingleCab, The frames are chrome and they have the black
plastic knob on the release lever.

TIA,

Brian.
