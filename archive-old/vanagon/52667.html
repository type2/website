&gt;Her tale of woe,

&gt;do I need to shift again?
&gt;what's that clanking sound
&gt;that's getting louder all around?
&gt;then there is a bang and a cloud of smoke,
&gt;perhaps this is no joke?
&gt;lets stop the car and take a look,

&gt;Hun, can you fix my car,
&gt;I didn't want to go very far...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We like our car, but...
&gt;Is there a market in used engines, or is it salvage time for the old beast?
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions appreciated,
&gt;Mark

   Mark,

   Sorry to hear about your engine!
   I was recently in the market for an engine for my '84 GL.  I did not find
any working engines in Portland, OR, auto recycling yards.  One place had
sold one recently for $550.  The Vanagon it came out of read 200,000 plus
miles. I don't think I saw a newly rebuilt engine for less than $1,300. And
the range of prices I found, went up steeply to $4,000.
   I decided to rebuild from 2 blown engines (with different areas &quot;blown&quot;),
and many new parts.  So far, 300 miles on rebuildt, so good.

   good luck,

   Scott Maurer
