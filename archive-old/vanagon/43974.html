Hi,

&gt; &gt;What is a synchro?

&gt;A Syncro is the all whell drive Vanagon.  Also, all wheel drive Quattro.

 I understand the 4WD systems on the Audis to be different from the VWs.
 The Synchro system used on Vanagons, Golfs (&amp; presumably other VWs)
is designed to improve traction on slippery surfaces (Snow, Mud) and so
increase the versatility of the vehicle at low speeds  whereas the Quattro
system on Audis is designed to boost traction on pavement at higher
speeds with a view to improving performance. I think the systems are built
differently because of these different (though overlapping) design goals.

Cheers,
	W.
