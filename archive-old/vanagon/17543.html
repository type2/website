Subject: [f?] Hey, can I sue for plagarism?

I just picked up the June issue of VWT&amp;A (Without much T&amp;A anymore...),
and read DL's `A VW-related Internet Newsgroups &amp; Mailing Lists primer'.
A lot of it sounded AWFULLY familiar. :) Here's something that I post to
rec.autos.vw occasionally, see if you can see the resemblance to the
article:

=========begin excerpt===========================================

Hello! it's time again for the weekly posting of the [A]ircooled 
mailing lists again!

FOR YOU TO WRITE DOWN THIS INFORMATION!!! `nuff said.

To subscribe to the vintage vw mailing list, send a post to:

LISTSERV_at_SJSUVM1.sjsu_dot_edu, with `subscribe VINTAGVW Your Name' in the

Hmm. I don't know wether to be disgusted at a lack of writing talent,
or just sit back and be amused. &lt;g&gt;.
