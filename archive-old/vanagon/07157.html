&gt; 
&gt; For sure it's the slave cylinder. That oil stuff you see leaking is
&gt; brake/hydraulic fluid, which should be forcing the slave cylinder to disengage
&gt; your clutch. Time for a quick look I'd say, to decide if it's a loose
&gt; connection or a shot cylinder. Sorry to hear that, trade you for my 78; it
&gt; doesn't have a hydraulic clutch system! :)
Well, I hope that after this problem is solved, most of the problems will go
away for a while.  I like my 82 diesel, though!  The oil definate does come 
down the side of the cylinder.  Strange thing, though ... shouldn't this also
affect the brakes somewhat?
