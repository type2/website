Subject: WANTED : Water filler cover plate and lock wanted

HELP!!!! 	
	
	I am in need of a water filler cover plate for my 80 
westi. For all of you out there that are Volkswagon service 
managers, &quot;IT'S THE ONE TO THE CLOSEST TO THE REAR OF THE 
VAN!!&quot;.	If any one has the other covers let me know I need 
them too. But I really need a water filler cover plate.	
		OH, Gotta go the started bombing iraq again. I 
hope they don't hit the VW dealership!
