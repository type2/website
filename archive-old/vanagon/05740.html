Subject: Re: Need Vanagon Tires

I too have been using the xzx tyres on my 82' westy and love them.  
35,000 miles of hard cross country driving--tough transition from my 
Triumph-- and they look very good, maby 60% left?  Only one blemish from 
a huge curb in Acadia Maine which decloaked as I was rounding some 
&quot;high&quot; speed curb, six inch gash that just looks bad.
Thanks for saving me some worry about the bearings, Joel, I was sure I 
adjusted $80 incorrectly. Just started to hear the noise about 2k ago and 
now i realize that i havn't rotated for a while.
take care y'all,  walt.
