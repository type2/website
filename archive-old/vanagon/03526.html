Here's another alternative....go to your local carpet retailer/installer
and get a section of reminent rug....you know the left over stuff.

Ten minutes after we took delivery of our EV, we stopped at the
neighborhood carpet place got a piece of grey carpet...paid
$5.00 for it. Took it home, gave a friend a six pack of
Bud (ok...he likes cheap beer..)....he laid the carpet out,
trimed it to size. 

We then bundled the carpet up took it back to the carpet shop, they
put binding on the edges for $10. We carpeted the rear seating
area for $20!!!

The carpet has withstood mud, puke (10 year old, non alcohol induced),
sand, etc..etc...  A little rug cleaner once in a while and its
nice and clean!
