So has anyone ever had any good results with this stuff
on your windshield, I suggested that I and quite a few
of my friends had not on the corrado list, and nearly
everyone jumped to the products defense.  Personally I
find it to usually decrease visibility when using wipers
and lead to more streaking unless you do it nearly weekly.
I use it on side windows with great results, but never on
front or rear glass.  It's been a while since I've used it
on a windshield though so if I get some more positive reviews,
maybe I'll give it another go, the only problem is IMHO the
crap can not be removed if I don't like it so I'm stuck until
it wears off.

Anyone with some thoughts?
