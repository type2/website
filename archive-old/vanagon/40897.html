Subject: hmm, is this bad? could it hurt?(lost spark plug)

hey now,

hmm, when changing my spark plugs today one fell out of the ratchet and back
into the spark plug housing. i tried to get it out with pliers but only
succeeded in pushing it back where i can't even see or feel it. i shrugged and
put the new plug in, started up the engine and went to work. i'm extremely
paranoid now. could that spark plug in there do major harm? how do i get it
out?
