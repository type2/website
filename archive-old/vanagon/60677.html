Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee
Little Jackie Paper loved that good old bus
And brought her oil and sealing-wax
And other fancy stuff

Oh! Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee
Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee

Together they would travel
Over friendly hill and dale
People waved and Jackie smiled
Again he told his tale
Puff could spring up friendships
Happened where-e'r they came
Jackie's friends would smile and laugh
When Puff roared out her name

Oh! Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee
Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee

A bus can live forever
But not so little boys
Oil changes and muffler checks
Made way for yuppie toys
One sad night it happened
Jackie Paper bought a Ford
And Puff that red VW
She puttered forth no more

Her tires soon lost their pressure
Left out in the rain,
Puff no longer was seen at play
Along the Cherry Lane
Without her lifelong friend
Puff could not be saved
So Puff the red VW
Finally slipped into her grave

Oh, Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee
Puff the red VW was a sight to see
And puttered through the morning mist
In the hills of Tennessee
