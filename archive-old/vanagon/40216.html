BTW I bought a used engine from the Volks Cafe through Kyle (pengi_at_cruzio)
and I've been very satisfied dealing with him. It's been really nice
(though I don't have then engine in yet) to have all the parts for the
engine already on. He's gotten me other parts in a reasonable time 
and fielded my questions for his mechanics. Shipping to MN was very
reasonable too.  If you're at all in the market for an engine, give him a
call.
