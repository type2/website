Phoenix, AZ:
The Texaco &quot;Superstation&quot; / Carwash that I frequent quoted:
Unleaded =  139.9
Power =        145.9
Super =         152.9

Surprisingly, the same company at a different location quoted:
UnLeaded = 133.0
Power =         Not available at that location (weird)
Super =         152.9

These prices strike me as at least a  $0.05 - $0.10 increase across the
board in the past week.

Try looking at Petroleum Indutry News located at
http://www.csc.ibm_dot_com/petrol/petnews.htm
or more specifically, the Daily Petroleum Report located at
http://baervan.nmt_dot_edu/prices/current.html
The headline here says:
&quot;Daily Petroleum Report    8:00 EDT April 11, 1996

OIL PRICES HIGHER WITH INCREASED DEMAND

Updated 16:00 MDT April 11, 1996&quot;

Prices and additional poop are provided.
