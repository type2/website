Subject: VW adds



&gt;&gt;Anyone else recall any memorable &quot;cute&quot; or otherwise funny ads
&gt;from the
&gt;&gt;past, from VW or not?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;My favorite shows a guy driving thru a snowstorm on his way to work
&gt;in the early morning darkness in his beetle.  He arrives at work
&gt;and climbs into a huge snowplow.  The announcer says something to
&gt;the effect:  &quot;Ever wonder how the snowplow driver gets to work?&quot;
&gt;Phil

My brother sent me a great VW add that he found in Canada a few years back.
The scene was a country road with a black split sedan just about to rise
over the hill in the horizon. In the foreground, parked over to one side,
were a line of new VWs, Passats, Golfs, etc. The text under the add read,
&quot;After 50 years we still haven't worked out all the bugs.&quot;
