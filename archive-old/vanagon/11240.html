&gt; I guess you don't like the two 6volt batteries in series. 
&gt;about the 1 12voly deep cycle-

A friend of mine has 2 6V's in his '59 bus, I think his are in parallel,
though, so he gets same voltage &amp; 2x amps.  He loves it to death, but I
don't want batteries in non-stock locations, so I wanna put the bat in
the left box in the engine compartment.

&gt; You need a voltage doubler circuit (not cheap) or a DC to DC converter(not 
&gt;cheap either.)  Or maybe two generators!  You could use two 6-volt or one of 
&gt;each- 6 and 12.  I don't think you'll like either of these.  can you get 
&gt;deep cycle 6 volt batteries?

Voltage doubler, eh?  How exactly does it work?  I've never heard of a DC/DC
converter!

Is it possible to run 2 6V's, but use the series output for the fridge?
