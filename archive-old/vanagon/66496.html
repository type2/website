Subject:      Procedures for Buying Used Westie in Canada?

Hi all. I live in Los Angeles, and am possibly interested in a '91 Westie
for sale in Canada. I've read here on this list about problems importing =
a
new Canadian Eurovan into the U.S. due to smog laws, etc., and am =
wondering
if I'll face the same problems with this used Westie.

The scenario would be that I fly into Canada, buy the Westie, and drive =
it
back home from there. Are there any kind of &quot;duty charges&quot; imposed at the
Canadian border for something like this? Any other complications to be
aware of? Or is it just a simple matter of &quot;pay the man, then cruise home
hassle free&quot;?

Any pointers of advice would be most welcome.

Chris
