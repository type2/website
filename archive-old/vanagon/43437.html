Subject: I'm back ... and Concept1 pins....


I'm a bit jet lagged (its 4:20 am) after comming home from a week in Italy 
and France....so what the hell, it's an ideal time to get back on the list 
and say &quot;hi&quot;.

When I got home there were two envelopes from VWAG waiting for me from the 
&quot;New Beetle Information Center&quot;....each containing a Concept 1 pin. These 
were briefly available thru the C1 web site about a month or so ago...nice 
pins, but small. Inside was a letter saying that I was now in the New Beetle 
Club. Its nice to know that the Germans are efficient enough to have me down 
on the mailing list TWICE!! Now I can get doubles for my collection!

Got to get going for now...

Ric
