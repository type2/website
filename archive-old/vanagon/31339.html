Troops,
I hope you fully realize that I was merely kidding you all about the EV's. I
was merely giving y'all your &quot;Christmas Goose.&quot; 
The van that I saw actually may have been a Sharan because it was different
from any other VW van/bus/whatever that I have ever seen.  Definitely looked
much like the current car like Chrysler &quot;Aurora&quot; minivans that I dared to
describe but had a slightly taller roof line topped off by a very thin
poptop section. The poptop was about twice as thick as those fiberglass pick
uptruck bed covers. Definitely low and squatty compared to any other
generation. Still had the hook ups on the side though... I seriously thought
it was a Chrysler product until I saw the VW logo.  It definitely was not a
barndoor. 

God Bless / Happy Holidays  and never take VanBondo too seriously,
