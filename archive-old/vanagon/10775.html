Subject: RE: Gone Fishing - 1983 Vanagon Camper in use

In that excellent Fishing Expedition R&amp;T article, there was an intriguing
phrase: &quot;a modest torque peak (106 lb-ft at 2600 for the Wasserboxer right
now, but watch this space)&quot; - ??? what was on their minds?  Have there
been variations on the wasserboxer engine?  Was VW contemplating something
more radical for the late Vanagons?  I'm not talking about minor tuning
variations for automatic vs. manual, or 2wd vs. synchro.  I think VW had
shelved all the 6-cyl air-cooled experiments by this time.

What kind of leak were they planting in R&amp;T's ear?
