Oh, I wish I was an old Westfalia Camper,
That is what I'd truly like to be.
Cause if I was an old Volkswagen Camper,
All the girls would come and sleep with me!    :)



         The Letters of the Line ...

Very carefully tune your car
Or you won't get too very far.
Little things can break or die,
Keeping you from getting by ...
So if you go out after all
Why not take with you something small:
A little book that tells you how,
Gives ways for you to fix it now.
Either that or call a truck ...
Nobody cares if you are stuck. :)
