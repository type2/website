Subject: re:exorbitant EV parts costs

I usually don't answer my own posts, but checked with Parts Place for
brake linings (VW dealer wants $58/pad, or $232 for both wheels).

PP charges $12.95  + $6 core for BOTH wheels!  I feel like I won the
lottery, of course I should reserve judgement until I actually see how fast 
they wear.  Front pads (both wheels) are $22.95.

I think I heard good things about Parts Place in the past somewhere on the net.
Hopefully it's all true.
