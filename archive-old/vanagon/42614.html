Subject: RE: towing boat

Steve M. asks if anyone's FWD vehicle has ever lost traction going uphill
(frontwards).  When my Vgon's ignition unit died, I had my wife pull me
home ignominiously behind the old Integra.  At one point we had to stop
at a stop light on an upslope, and she had to try a second time, feathering
the clutch very delicately, to avoid wheelspin getting the two cars
started again.  FWD is great because the front wheels are always pointed
exactly where the drive wheels want to go, which is not true of RWD.  But
in special circumstances, you can spin 'em.
