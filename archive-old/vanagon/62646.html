Subject: '86 Vanagon Q's- any special problems?


Greetings!

As a regular member of the type2 list, I hear a lot about aircooled vans
every single day.  What I don't hear about is their watercooled brethren.

I was offered an '86 Vanagon 7-passenger with dual air, (almost)immaculate
exterior, complete, untorn interior, strong motor, new clutch/.tires for
$3000US.  Not knowing much about vanagons, I turn to the most logical
place to get advice.

Is there anything that I should look for on this van to be a red flag?

Is this price reasonable? ( I am in Knoxville, TN )

Is my wife going to absolutely cut my throat for looking at ANOTHER VW
van?


My dream vgon would be either a sunroof or a westi.  This is neither, but
is is very good shape, and has been well-loved.I am seriously
contemplating the purchase of this fine beastie, but If I dedcide
otherwise, I will post its whereabouts to the (collective) list
communities of type2 and v_at_l.

Thanx for the time,
