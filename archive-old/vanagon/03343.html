Subject: Re: tires, once again

185/75R14 XZX reinforced is what I got for my 84 vanagon. The cost was
about $58 each from Price Club here in Sunnyvale California.

These are excellent tires for vanagons but do not last as long as those
original Michelin reinforced tires came with the car. The original tires
lasted nearly 60k miles. The XZX has less than 40k so far but I can see
that they need to be replaced soon.
