	Thanks to Bob and Mike for the quick responses!
	More soap-opera as it happens. My brother promises to physically
restrain me from shovelling rocks into it sans some kind of bed protection.
He also says dire things about swing axles, but points out that the
bay-window busses came in at the same time as the first Japanese
pickup trucks, and so it makes sense that lots of pre-68 double
and single cab pickups are out there.
	He also wants me to call the dealers in the northwest and B.C.
Charming thing, he also got the the dealership directory with their
phone numbers!

	Bill
