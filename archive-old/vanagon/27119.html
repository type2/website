Subject: practical tailgater deterent

It's not as satisfying as nukes or oil dispensers, but a simple 1 minute
tailgating defense is to take a pin and redirect the rear window washer
outward as far as it will go.   (This takes more than 1 minute if you
don't have a rear window washer.)

On our Golf, the front washers are set to squirt up over the windshield
some (some gets on the windshield too).   When people get too close, a
squirt makes them back off quickly, wipers frantically working to clear
their windshield.
