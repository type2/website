Volks,
	Apologies for the wide distribution.  Martha asked me to post to the
list with suggestions for a &quot;mountain&quot; campground between the Bay area
and LA/San Diego.  I have two in mind, both of which I have camped at
several times.  I will describe each of them and beg for comments from
potential campers:

1.  Long Valley 
	This campground is waaaaay away from everything.  It's about a 20
mile drive North of highway 178 near Onyx.  In the extreme Southern tip
of the Sequoia Nat'l Forest, it is about 7,000 feet up and a mixture of
high desert terrain and pine trees.  There is a small creek running
behind the campground, and a mine tunnel nearby.  The biggest advantage
of this place is that it is *so* remote that we could burn or blow up
anything we wanted without fear of bothering anyone.  ARE YOU LISTENING
BRADLEY?  :)  I believe it's also free.  Oh, the 20 miles is on a dirt
road.  It's pretty country, but can get a bit dusty at times.  With the
weather lately I don't think that will be the case though.  It would
probably get cold at night due to the elevation.  There are no hookups,
showers, or flush toilets, so if you're a pansy camper, you probably
won't like this place.  :)  Long Valley is pretty much due East of
Bakersfield.  It's a BLM campground.

2.  Peppermint (I think that's the name)
	Also has no hookups, showers, or flush toilets.  Also has a creek.
This place is near the highway but still not well known, it seems, or
very well organized.  I think they charge a small fee, like $4/night.
The terrain is similar to Long Valley, but I think the elev. is a bit
lower - around 5600 ft?  Might be a little warmer at night.  This place
is on a highway which runs behind (East of) an indian reservation
somewhere East of Visalia.  I brought in a map to give directions but as
luck would have it it was missing this page.  :(  It might be a bit
closer to the Bay area but the road in is a steep, windy mutha.  We
could probably burn stuff here but there will be other people around.
There is likely to be NOBODY else at Long Valley.  One advantage of
Peppermint is that a few miles down the road there is a nice trail,
about 2 miles long leading to a great overlook of the mountains.  There
is a rock outcropping on the side of a mountain with a house built on
top of it.  You can walk up to the house and look out around it with
telescopes.  It is quite spectacular but you have to see it to
understand.  It's used by the rangers as a fire lookout most of the
time.  I guarantee it will be worth the hike.

Well, those are my two ideas.  There are tons of other places we could
go too, so if anyone has suggestions, please let them be known.  Also,
there is a slight chance I may not be able to attend this trip, but I'll
know for sure in a couple of days.  Please give Martha and I your
comments!

Thanks,
		-David
