Subject: Re: Phone number for VW dealer

Ok... thanks to Joel and Jack for the number.  I thought I'd kept the 
post before... but oh well, must have burned it.

I called and got a great deal, $36 for the filler thing with the duckbill 
inside (list was $46).  The dealer here wanted $54.  The scarey part is 
that they all recognize the number... and so it makes me wonder if I 
should have gotten two of them.
