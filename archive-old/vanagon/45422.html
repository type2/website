Subject: Re: Rebulding a '74 motor

It's been my experience that most VDubs ended up in the junkyard because 
of the engine in the first place.  Unless it appears really rusted out or 
had been in an accident (evidence of other reasons why it's there in the 
first place), I'd watch out....could be an oil burner...but it you don't 
mind adding lots of oil to patch you by, might not be a bad idea.  Once 
again, time is money.
