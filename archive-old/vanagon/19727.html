Subject: Re: 82 rebuild advice sought

&gt;Hi there folks
&gt;
&gt;I have an 82 Vanagon in desperate need of a rebuild. I dont have the time 
&gt;or knowledge to do it myself so I am seaking external advice. 
&gt;
&gt;I live in Boulder CO. I have been talking to Verners VW and Wolfgang's VW 
&gt;repair. Both have quoted me around $2200 - $2500 for the rebuild. Or I 
&gt;can get one from GEX for around $1600 plus $400 core charge plus either 
&gt;place will put the GEX one in for $400. What should I do? All the places 
&gt;offer 12 months 12,000 miles.
&gt;
&gt;2nd question. I really only need a valve job and new rings, one of the 
&gt;places I talked to said he would do a top-end rebuild for $1500 and the 
&gt;other guy said you are crazy to just do the top-end because the bottom 
&gt;end is going to go soon after. The van has 100,000 on it. Can you please 
&gt;give me some advice before I blow my piggy bank.
&gt;
&gt;Appreciate it
&gt;
&gt;Jared

&gt;'82 Vanagon
&gt;Jared,
With the cuurent prices of 2.0 liter parts the best buy is, believe it
or not the dealer at $1950.I'm only building custom motors now and installing
long blocks from VW.
