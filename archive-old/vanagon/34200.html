Subject: RE: Dielectric grease


&gt;This stuff sounds very useful.  I went down to Radio Shack to get some
&gt;and the guy said what's that.  Where can I get dielectric grease and how
&gt;expensive is it.

I got some at the local FLAPS, Kragen to be exact.

Is this the stuff you used when replacing your points? you put just a
little on the distributor cam that the points rider rubs on, to open
and close the points, so it won't wear down to a nub?
