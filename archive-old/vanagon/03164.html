&gt;David S. How do you tell if your cat is plugged? Is there a simple
&gt;test? Do the chemicals designed to clean 'em out work? How long before
&gt;they fail? Curious - DC&gt;

when they get plugged or collapse, you will experience engine dying. :)
if collapsed, maybe even rattling noises. the only way i know to 'test'
them is to take them out of the exhaust system and look at them and shake
them (to see if they rattle).

chemicals to clean them out? never heard of that. what kind of chemicals
and how to you get it into the cat? take the cat off the car?

how long? woof. i've heard of them going over 100,000 miles. and i've known
people who had to replace them at 40,000 miles (american car). i think it's
just the individual car/part/driver/treatment, with a dash of luck thrown in.
