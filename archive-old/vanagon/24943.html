Subject: Cassidy turns 100k

Hi All,
Well Cassidy my beloved '77 deluxe westy turned 100,000 last evening at 6:54
edt on I285 in Atlanta. I pulled over to the side of the road feeling like I
should have a ceramony of some sort. Then pictured the delightful Georgia
State Patrol stopping to see what s wrong as I am dancing around the bus
waving incense and chanting. Some how I thought the moment might be lost on
them and did not want to end up in the county psych ward, or spend hours
waiting as they tore the bus apart in search of illegal substances, finding
none but ruining the interior. So I simply thanked the bus, gave her a big
kiss on the dash and drove on to a rather boring party, where the
signifigance of the event seemed lost on the others, &quot;you mean you are gonna
still drive something with that many miles on it, man you were far better
off in your Rodeo&quot;.
So this weekend is gonna be a big one as far as maintainence goes, valves,
bleeding the brakes, checking all the connections, new points, plugs,
condensor, lubing etc. I have been offered the assistance of a friend who is
alot more mechanically inclined than me (I just learning 6 weeks ago when I
got the bus how to check the oil)so it should be a learning experience, I am
looking forward to it. Please forgive me in advance if you see urgent help
messages here this weekend, I have this fear of taking something out and
forgetting where to put it back, I do have a system planned though, an old
sheet and a marker, everythign laid out and marked on the sheet. Thanks for
all that I have learned just lurking around the edges. 
Peace,       &quot;Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand and say's 
Scoob         Don't you see, got to make some how, on the dreams you still
believe,
              Don't give it up, you got an empty cup,
              Only love will fill, only love will fill&quot;
              Jerry Garcia
