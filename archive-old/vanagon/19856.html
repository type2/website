&gt;        I now need advice on the best material for coating the stud to build
&gt;up a water tight structural fit, Permatex...  Locktite..... I'm not looking
&gt;for a silicone goop type sealant, something with a bit of body in it, ie.

i had really good luck with J-B Weld, a two part plastic-steel stuff. if
you can't find it up there, let me know and i'll send you some. i used it
to hold a magnet in filled out drain plug (at the bottom of an oil pan) and
it worked great. held up to the heat better than the magnet! (which lost
a lot of its magnetic attraction ... due to the heat, i think).

&gt;the muffler + rear heat shields to redrill. Besides, the stud will tighten
&gt;in nicely, full threads there, just crooked and a bit too deep!  TIA  tim s.

now, i DON'T know if you'd ever be able to get the stud back out, though! :(
