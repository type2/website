&gt; &gt; &gt;I just bought a set of reinforced Michelin X tires for my 86 Westfalia. The
&gt; &gt; &gt;max tire pressure is 40 psi, yet the sticker on the door calls for 48 psi in
&gt; &gt; &gt;the rear tires. The dealer (Wheelworks, a large chain in the SF Bay Area)
&gt; &gt; &gt;insists that they are the correct tires. What's going on here?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The tire recommendation is for a wide range of vehicles, including cars.
&gt; &gt; The sticker is for that tire on your individual vehicle
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You have a much heavier van.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I inflated to the door sticker pressure, despite the 40psi on my tires.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just my opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; The door sticker on my '88 Westy says:
&gt; 
&gt; For 185r14 REINFORCED tires: 30/40 psi front/rear
&gt; For 195/75r14 6PR LT tires: 39/48 psi front/rear
&gt; 
&gt; So you ARE ok with 40 psi if they are REINFORCED. If they don't say
&gt; it, they probably aren't (and should not be used).
&gt; 
&gt; btw: I ran my re-inf. tires at max pressure all round, as they were
&gt; too soft. I now run LT load range C/D tires at 39-50 psi depending on
&gt; conditions and loading.

The 48 PSI sticker on your Westy is for the original equipment
Continental Transporter tires with reinforced sidewalls.  Thank your
luck stars you no longer have them on your van.  They were by far the
worst handling tires I ever had, especially in the rain.
