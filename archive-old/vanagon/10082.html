So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:

&gt; Lets not go blaming VWUS about this. My local dealer works on ANY
&gt; VW...They just put in a factory rebuilt for my wife's 79(80)
&gt; Bug Cabriolet, and replaced the flywheel and pilot shaft seals
&gt; on my '56 beetle all within the last month! Oh, yeah...they even
&gt; work on my EV from time to time.

Yeh! Ric, you already know that since you're an attorney, the mechanics
will change out any of your dirty nuts!  ;p

My dealer adjusted my carbs on my '74 real nice in '89.  That's the last
time I had the '74 in before I sold it.

I still think in general, companies want you to give up the old beast
for new ones.  If were them, I sure would.
