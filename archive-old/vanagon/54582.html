&gt;As people accessorize their buses (high wattage stereos, aux. lighting,
CB's, high output 
&gt;headlights, ..., etc.) it might be prudent to run a separate heavy gauge
lead from the 
&gt;battery for this things, as Ken Lewis suggested is a previous posting today.
&gt;
&gt;In additional, I would suggest adding an auxiliary fuse box just for this
line and then run 
&gt;these items through this box.  Also, be liberal in using relays to activate
these items.

        I have done this by using the #2 battery for the radio deck but,
being as there is a running conversation on CB's going I would like to make
the point that a CB is not a High current accessorie.  Few modern AM only
rigs will draw a much as 2.5 amp ON TRANSMITT.  and a SSB rig (ie. uniden
Grant) will pull under 2 amps on transmitt,  keep in mind the the transmitt
cycle (transmitt/recieve)on a CB is probably under 1/100. On recieve a
modern CB is in the area of 250mA.  This is much less that the steady and
peak draw of even a normal stereo.

        I do recomend running seperate wireing, but mostly to reduce noise,
it isn't needed if you use the cigar lighter circuit or the accessorie
circuit (both fused at over 15amps).  DO install fuses when you install any
electrical accessorie THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.  Mostly, dont be affraid to
install a normal CB or other 2way radios but that 300W linear or base amp
will need a seperate wire to provide power.
