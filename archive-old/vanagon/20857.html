Subject: EV A/C Question....


Ok....I think I may have found a &quot;bug&quot; in my EV....and I need someone
to do a quick check on their EV for me...assuming of course you
have A/C.

Here's the problem. I believe that when the AC is put on...whether
on the first position (quick cool) or on the second position
(regular cool) the radiator fan should come on at low speed.
My 86 GTI did it, and when the engine became &quot;hot&quot; the
high speed fan came on.

The low speed fan does not come on...only the highspeed.

Also the temp gague has been sitting at 230 or 3/4 on ths
scale. Don't they run at the 1/2 the gauge?

It could be with this &quot;heat wave&quot; that it is just running
hot...but I don't recall it going that hot.

Thanks in advance.

Ric
