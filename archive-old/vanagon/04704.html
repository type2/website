Subject: Esp For Eurovan Owners, Tires


Unfortunately, I must state that VW USA has done me in.

At first the VW dealer-point of contact stated they were in touch with a VW 
regional 'Tech' and had been authorized to replace my tires.

After I took the van to the dealer, I told:

	 the VW 'tech' did not authorize the exchange

	The van neeeded both front-end and rear-end alignment (at my expense)

	if I had them (the VW dealar) perform the alignment, they'd try
	to get me a 'deal' on the purchase of four new tires

I will not have that dealership do the alignment.
I'll think carefully about my next action.

Sorry to put false hope out there!
