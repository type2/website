Subject: Re: The Mystery Machine Lives..but costs

&gt;
&gt;JC Whitney has Vgon rotors for $49.98 (early) or $52.98 (late) apiece,
&gt;or around $100/pair plus shipping. Not for Syncro, tho-- was yours
&gt;a Syncro or a 2WD Vanagon?

        It's a 2wd 83 Westie. Is JC Whiyney a US thing or is it Canada to?
I havent heard of them before, but then again I havent had a need for auto
stuff before : )

forever on a  mental bus trip,
mike
