Subject: re: Free(?) VW History Book (sorry, all gone)

I called 1-800-444-8987 about 11:00 EST today and asked for &quot;VW History 
Book/Video&quot;.  I spoke with a woman, do not remember her name.  She asked 
a few questions (if I was intrested in buying or leasing, what year model 
vehicles I own, if I would buy/lease in the next 3/6/12 months, and how I 
got this phone number) then said they would sent the goodies to me.  
After a little prodding about the Jerry Garcia thing, she said they would 
include that too.
I asked for info. on the VW Visa Card and she gave me an 800# 
(800-847-7378) for the bank that is issuing it.  I called up and told the 
female operator I was interested in the &quot;Volkswagen Visa&quot;.  I heard her 
type, pause, type, pause.  She says &quot;I can't find anything under 
Volkswagen, let me try 2 words: Volks Wagen&quot;  Turned out she was spelling 
it volkswagOn.  Once she found it she took a bunch of info. and in 
several weeks I should get a no-fee VISA with &quot;Volkswagen&quot; printed on it.
The intrest rate is high, but I pay it off every mnth anyway.  AND every 
purchase earns credit toward purchase of a new VW (which I will never use).
