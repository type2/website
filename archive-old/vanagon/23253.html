Rusty says:
&gt;Well we could have &quot;Hands Across Hoover.&quot; Treat Bob like a pass
&gt; around pack/Pony Express kinda thing! Everybody sign up for a twentymile to
&gt; two hundred mile stretch. One thing is for sure, at least you won't be out
&gt; of luck and with out a clue if you break down! 

How about this:  Why limit Bob to just the West Coast?  After his 
obligations are met, let's take him on a tour across North America 
(including Canada, of course)...  

we could see how long vanagon.lenti people could host, move, feed,
and entertain one individual.  i suppose Bob would have to be a
willing participant in all this but if the idea gets enough
momentum, that point may become secondary!  :)

Jerry could post a web page that instead of &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot; he could 
have a map and dots representing geographic locations of members;  
then we could do &quot;Where's Bob?&quot; as we try to pinpoint his current 
whereabouts.

In all seriousness (and apologies to Bob) i hope we(collectively) can 
assist him.  i wish i was close enough to do a 'leg'.  good luck, 
Bob!
