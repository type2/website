 varmit-proofing a Vanagon?  &gt;&gt;
Mark I had a mouse condo in my heater box.I finally got sick of pieces of
insulation,sticks and turds flying out at me from the fresh air vents at
60mph, that I disassembled the htr box and did a clean sweep, including
putting screen over the fresh air intake,They got inside as well and ate 2
holes in the rear area of my westy poptop canvas.All I found was some
skeletal remains and anest.I hate them too.They can be quite damaging.Good
luck.
