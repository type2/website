Subject:      Request for opinions

My wife has fallen in love with the idea of owning a Westphalia, having
been inspired by a friend's '93 Eurovan. (A very deluxe model with all mod
cons.)  In order not to spend the rest of my life regretting that I bought
the wrong model just because it was there, I have done some homework, and
now solicit your opinions.
The early ones are underpowered.  (On the other hand, I own a '68 Ghia, so
I don't have to learn the mechanics.)
The 1984 - 90 wasserboxers are nice to drive, but have cooling, head and
injector problems, and cost a lot to fix.  The 91 - 92 models have more
power and fewer problems.  The 93 and later Eurovans, according to someone
in the business, have lots of mechanical problems.  (My friend just got his
with very few Kms on it, and it's sure nice to drive.)  So.  Confirmation?
Arguments?  Recommendations?  Thanks in advance.
