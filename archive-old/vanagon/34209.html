Subject: wasserboxer oil buzzer warning = Fram

Okay.  Here I go on another tirade against Fram.....

This just happened today.  Actually, the last several days.  On my 
last oil change 300 mi. ago, i used a Fram filter because i didn't 
have a VW one on hand.  Still have that stock-pile from when Frams go 
on sale for $1.99 :)      Anyway, the oil light and buzzer had 
started going off at specifically 2200 RPM.  above that or below that 
RPM it behaved.  actually, it seemed to go off most when the rpm was 
up around 3000 or higher and then hit 2200 on the downsweep.  Picked 
up 6 Autobahn filters at the dealer for $7.50 ea.  put one on and the 
problem is cured.  period.  same oil. same conditions except for the 
filter.  i'll blame the Fram, thank you.

Now, i use Frams exclusively on my Toyota and there's not a wit of 
problem.  Here's my theory on the wasserboxer:

Frams are made with a tight filter fabric-- they rate the highest in 
Consumer Digest type tests for fine particulate removal.  For the 
most part this is a good thing, but a tight pore-space material means 
higher back pressures given comparable surface areas (this isn't 
entirely true but we'll ignore the rest of the facts).  In the 
wasserboxer, i'm proposing that this higher back pressure jams the 
engine's oil pressure relief valve to the top of its travel.  The 
relief valve sticks there for a while, either due to the flow of oil 
running past it or some 'stickiness' in the bore.  At rpms above 
2200, there is still enough oil pressure to keep the system happy.  
when the rpm drops to 2200, the warning buzzer activates due to the 
reduced pressure.  Rpm below 2200 drops the backpressure enough 
whereby the relief valve unseats and restores normal flow pattern and 
pressure.  Additionally, oil light flickers at idle (a different 
problem) could be caused by the restrictive filter material.

So whaddya think?  sound like BS???   The VW service manager said 
they are also seeing problems with &quot;Valvoline&quot; in addition to Fram 
filters.  Installing the $10 Autobahn cures the problem.  :)
