&gt;1) as far as glue for the gaskets, i've heard use silicone based glue
&gt;or whell bearing grease.  anyone have an opinion.

I use grease only, saves me time scraping and polishing the valve covers next
time the gaskets need replacing.  and I have no leaking from the gaskets so,
why glue?  :)  'course if they leaked at all, I'd use the glue (cover side
only!).
