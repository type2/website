Subject: 87 Syncro: engine hesitating

Lately my Van has begun to hesitate occasionally while driving around
town. This is not the classic &quot;harness cured&quot; problem that I suffered for
a number of years until VW isolated the problem. That had to do with
prolonged driving on the interstate: this is low speeds around town and it
disappears on the interstate. I replaced the fuel filter but, alas, that
didn't do it.

Any thoughts? Thanks, Nelson Hogg
