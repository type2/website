So Tom Forhan says:
&gt; 
&gt; The instructions show, as a sample installation, the air inlet directly
&gt; above the outlet. Since warm air rises, it would seem this would cause
&gt; the heated air to get drawn back into the furnace. I'd rather see the
&gt; inlet as far down toward the floor as possible, and the outlet above it.
&gt; Another option would be to put the outlet near the center of the van,
&gt; and have the inlet off to the right side, near the door. You only run
&gt; hose from the furnace to the outlet, the inlet simply allows airflow
&gt; into the area under the seat. 

I mounted the thermostat on the closet just below the level of the speaker
on the adjacent panel.  

I drilled the air inlet on the bench kick panel to where if you look on 
the inside, it's just above the computer box.  I didn't route a hose to
it as shown in the Propex diagram.  Since I wanted the heat outlet as
short as possible (heat transfers poorly), I put the hole in the kick
panel just between the aux. heater box cover and the Propex heater. 
This gave the shortest possible hose run to the heater outlet itself. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the instructions, here is what you should either dig up in the
&gt; basement, borrow from your unca', or go shopping for:
&gt; 
&gt; Power drill and your usual drill bits
&gt; 
&gt; Usual screw drivers
&gt; 
&gt; 1&quot; hole saw, or 1&quot; bit. For cutting through the floorpan
&gt; for the combustion inlet and exhaust; it needs to be able to
&gt; cut metal.

Uhhh... This should be a 1.5&quot; hole saw.
&gt; 
&gt; 2&quot; hole saw - for wood. This one is my suggestion for Westies, and not
&gt; mentioned in the instructions. Propex shows the exhaust passing 
&gt; through a metal floor, but in my Westie it will have to pass through
&gt; the wood floor of the underseat compartment before going through
&gt; the metal floorpan. I examined the exhaust pipe, and it is not double
&gt; walled. So to insulate the wall of the exhaust pipe from the wood,
&gt; I want to open up the wood portion of the hole through the floor
&gt; so that it never touches the exhaust pipe. I'd like to hear opinions on
&gt; this...

I just used the 1.5&quot;.  I don't think the exhaust will get hot enough to cause
problems with the wood.  I went to about 10 places to find the 1.5&quot; metal
hole saw.

&gt; 3 3/4&quot;  hole saw: for cutting out the air inlet and outlet holes in the
&gt; wood/laminate front face of the rear seat.  I suppose you could do this
&gt; with that wobbly, jumpy hand-held jigsaw, but I'll just use my hole saw.
&gt; Call around, I found this item at a wholesale plumbing supply store, my 
&gt; fourth stop in the quest.

I found mine at a power tool outlet place.  Be sure that the hole saws come
with a center tap for a guide.  Forget using a jigsaw.

&gt; 1/4 copper tubing. I got ten feet, probably twice as much as I need, but 
&gt; it allows for one major error. 

Get a 20 foot one for when you do f**k up.

&gt; Tubing cutting tool. The ones I like have cutting blades on both sides,
&gt; and are called &quot;minimum clearance&quot; or something like that. They are
&gt; designed for work in small, cramped spaces, like VW buses.
&gt; 
&gt; Silicon sealant. This is used for sealing the holes in the floor pan.

The heater should have come with this????  Mine did.  Maybe I ordered
it, but I don't remember doing so.

&gt; (4) hook up the power to the aux battery system you installed last
&gt; weekend  ;-). 

You should run, at least, a couple extra wires behind the fridge so 
that if you need more for other uses, then you don't have to pull the
fridge again.

Good Luck!
