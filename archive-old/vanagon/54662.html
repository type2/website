&gt;      Does anyone know of, or if, there are spacers available that go under the rear coil springs of the Van/Westy to counteract the inevitable spring sag?, i.e., raise the rear to spec. height or more?

   I'm looking at a JCW cataloge right now and they have an AIR LIFT air
springs suspension for 85 to 95 VW Eurovan for $59.98.  Says to &quot;restore
ride height, improve handling, extend shock life, bla, bla, bla...&quot;. Air
suspensions work quite well; big-rigs have been using them for years, so
it is possible that this is not a JCW questionable product, and AIR LIFT
is a known brand name.  I'm thinking of trying them when my van gets its
new paint and engine and returns to the road.
   I also remember seeing lowering springs in a Bus Boys cataloge for
about $500 (price before your 10% list member discount).  You'll be
lower--but level.
   Hope this helps,
Garth
