Hi y'all...

You might remember me as the &quot;newcomer with a lot of questions, but no 
bus...&quot; Well, we did it. It's a '71 Westy, with some surface rust, but a good 
drivetrain. 1600 engine, single Weber carb, nice original interior... we'll 
see how well she serves us. Paid $800, which seemed reasonable...

So whaddya think - should I try to get the cables to the heater boxes 
unstuck, or should I just replace them? Yup - they're rusted stuck, and it's 
mighty cold here in New York right now (and it's even colder in Minnesota, 
where we're going for Christmas - whether or not we drive the bus depends on 
whether or not I get some heat going). What's the number one heat strategy? 
Gas or propane heater? Electric? Original with a blower?

In any case, we're in for real now. I'm a little excited and a little 
frightened... but what the heck - it runs! :)

BTW - if anyone wants a '64 Beetle for restoration, I happen to have one... I 
have a feeling the Westy is going to take what time I have for messing with 
VW's... &lt;gulp!&gt;


- Anton in Brooklyn, proud new Westy owner
