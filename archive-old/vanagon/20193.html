Subject: Valves getting much tighter much too fast

Well, the #3 exhaust valve has tighted up .004&quot; in the last 1075 miles.  I 
am really concerned.  Further, when I took off the valve cover, I found two 
1/4 circle washers which have a square cross-section.  I took a file to one 
and they are _not_ metal.  I looked at the valve keepers and they are all 
present and accounted for.  I think they must have come from the heads, but 
I can't figure out where.  I think that they must be the remains of a valve 
seal, as the hole size is about the same size as a valve stem.  Other than 
this, I can't figure out what they are or where they came from.  Anyone have 
any ideas?  These pieces seem to be made of phenolic resin or something.

Help!
