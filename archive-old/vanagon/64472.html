I forgot to mention, those of you with eagle eyes - look at the rear
side
window of the red South African Vanagon....
notice anything??

:&lt;)

(maybe we could get a group purchase of these too!!  :&lt;)

** I also noticed the mud flaps that look molded to the wheelwell. I
also looked up the VWSA web site and they have 15 inch steel wheels,
in-line 4 and 5 cylinder engines!  Wouldn't it be cool to ge one of
those here. =)  I guess the next step would be to get the ball rolling
and put in an order.  Any volunteers?
