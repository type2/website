&gt; &gt;Hello All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a noise from my 1986 Vanagon engine compartment.  Upon further
&gt; investigation I find that the waterpump bearing has a lot of play and is
&gt; getting ready to let go.  Does anyone care to venture a guess at what this
&gt; job could cost. I wonder if I can do it myself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any ideas will be welcomed
&gt; &gt;

I recently had my water pump replaced for about $300 (parts + labor) here
in Portland, OR.  This pump lasted only 25K miles.  Also, the old pump was 
leaking antifreeze.
