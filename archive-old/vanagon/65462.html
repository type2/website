Subject:      87 Syncro Westy for trade

     Hi list server members,

     I am searching for a 90 Westy.  I own an 87 Westy Syncro with 94K in
     fantastic shape.  The reason for this move is I do not need the syncro
     and would like to simplify my Westy needs.  My Westy Syncro is really
     nice and I would like to trade for a 1990 Westy.  If you are
     interested in my Syncro please e-mail me directed.

     Thanks for this list.
