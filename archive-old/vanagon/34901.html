Subject: Point Lube from Car Quest


        A little while back I promised to post the info on the point lube
that I bought from the Dukes of Hazzard clones at Car Quest.

        The tube came in a box-- the box says &quot;Car Quest engine controls--
ignitio - electrical - emisssions - fuel.&quot;  The part number is &quot;SL2 Lube
Tube.&quot;  Also says Qty. 6 on the box... I got one, and it was like 6 or 8
bucks (ouch).

        The tube says:  Blue Streak SL-2 LUBRICAM distributor cam lubricant
containing SILICONE, Standard Motor Products, Inc., Long Island City, NY
11101.  &quot;LUBRICAM, containing silicone, prolongs the life of the breaker
arm rubbing block and cuts down on adjustments of contacts.  CAUTION:  mild
eye irritant, etc.&quot;  Also, &quot;contains over 85&amp; petroleum mineral oil.&quot;  Tube
is 7/8oz.

        That's about it!  Hope this helps someone.  This stuff is
definitely sold as Point Lube, not Dielectric grease.
