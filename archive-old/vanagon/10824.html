Subject: installation of front door seals
Date: Sun, 29 Jan 1995 22:35:13 -0600 (CST)

I'm about to replace the front door seals on the '75 bus. I got the
Brazilian ones for $20 instead of the German ones for $80. Once they're
in, I'll let you know if the Brazilian ones are acceptable or not.

Right now, it looks like I'll encounter a problem with that ring/donut
shaped part of the seal that goes to the lower front of the door. Am I
supposed to cut it open, or is there a way to remove that metal bar that
goes from the frame to the door?

Also, is there some special glue that's recommended for that job? Anything
else I should know?

Merci.

Sami
