Volks,
	I have updated the itinerary (finally!) on the GNATT home page.
I also shamelessly stole and modified Matt Sanner's excellent logo to use
as the GNATT logo.  There is a picture of it on the GNATT page, which
is:

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw/tour.html

I plan on printing out a large number of pages with this logo on, to
post at campsites that GNATT will pass through, thereby giving others
some indication that we are there.  Those that are participating will
want to look at the logo in advance (but it is very distinctive!) to
know what to look for.

-David
