Subject: Re: F.Y.I. About Isetta cars

In a message dated 96-02-19 00:25:43 EST, you write:

&gt;Any one interested can contact me, and if not too many of you are
interested,
&gt;maybe I can copy and mail or fax some of this .
&gt;
&gt;

Yeah, I'd like to hear more about em.  An Isetta is (another) one of my dream
toys.  I wonder how hard it is to acquire parts for these.  If there are a
lot of vw parts built into the German models, can someone just use vw
replacements?
