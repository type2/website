Subject: Back issue articles

Weeeel,

I find this kinda hard to admit, but I was diggin around in my 
closet this weekend, and came across my stash of old issues of
DB&amp;HVWs and VWT&amp;A. Did not need these old issues, so I sat
down with a razor blade and cut out all the tech articles, and
tossed the ads and bimbos.

I have some series in the pile, and I need some of the missing
issues. 

If someone out there has some good stashes of '90-'94 DB&amp;HVWs
series, I would appreciate hearing from you.

I am still making a list of the exact issues I still need.

PS: What I would really like to do is get the publishers 
permission to scan these articles and make the availible
on the net. But, they 'recycle' the articles so shamelessly,
they prob wont allow it.
