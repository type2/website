&gt;Anyone with an 87 vanagon with a/c that had the recall service
&gt;performed--i.e. metal support brace added to ceiling piece so it doesn't
&gt;fall down and konk someone on the head.  Is the new support visible? 
&gt;What does it look like or is there no difference in appearance?

The metal brackets are placed inside the AC duct.  There is no visual
indication that the recall has been done.

Good luck &amp; duck quick when the duct falls!
