Subject: Re: 91 injector seals recall
Date: Mon, 15 Aug 94 10:35:48 CDT

&gt;
&gt;&gt; does anyone actually have the letter that came with/for/about that recall
&gt;&gt; on the injector seals? would they mind typing it in or mailing a copy to
&gt;&gt; me?  i'd like to add it to the Recall data file.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I've got the letter, but it doesn't mention part numbers or such...
&gt;Only that it affects &quot;some 1990/91 model Volkswagen Vanagon and Synchro
&gt;vehicles&quot;.  Contact me by email if you'ld like me to mail you a copy,
&gt;though...

&gt;

I've got a '90 GL, I'd be interested but I don't have your email
address.

And for Joel...has that recall list been posted recently?  If it has,
could you mail it to me please (to save bandwidth), since I missed all
the postings of recent months :^)

Thanks,
Joachim
