Hi vanagon people,
Here's another question in my list.  Since it is kind-of snowy today,
it seems like a good day to ask questions.  (if you happen to live
south of Montana, forget that comment).

My starter bendix in my 1982 diesel vanagon needs to be replaced.  Has
anyone actually done this themselves?  The Bentley book says to remove the
axle.  They way there's another way, but it is difficult.  Has anyone done
it the other way?  What pitfalls should I watch out for? 

By-the-way, Thanks to everyone who responded about camp grounds which are
open in Oregon.  We have, however, sort-of decided to go to Canada instead.
And, our vanagon is now no longer being powered by my chevy pickup, which
is nice.

Stuart Hutton
