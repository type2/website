&gt; &gt; Holy Moley, Mother of Cripes!  I hope NOT! 8^)

&gt;
&gt; Just to clarify, I just hope your van is an isolated case.

I took no offense, and none is meant.  I hope this case is isolated, too.
Hope that I can isolate it and eliminate it too, before costing me too much
time and money.  Dealer has been good about warranty things, including not
charging me for this possibly needless fuel pump change.  I just wish their
mechanics were a little more gifted with good ol' common sense, and gave a
sh*t about the Eurovans.

&gt; Because, there is NO way I could afford what you are having to go through.
&gt; I've only had my van 6 months and so far repairs include:
&gt;
&gt; 1. 2 Radiator Resistors and loose heat shield. $100.00
&gt; 2. Power Steering boot. $10.00 part, $120 labor.

The engine has been tough and economical so far, just can't squirt gas or
spark into it all the time...


&gt; Yes, this V6 only has one head.  It is a very narrow V, I think its 60
&gt; degrees versus the standard 90.

That's really interesting!  Hopefully reduce cost for valve jobs for those
of us who keep our cars for 20 years (if they're reliable to start, that
is!).


&gt; &gt; Is the EV VR-6 really coming out??? Maybe I'll swap for one after


&gt; Who knows, I'm about ready to give up.  If they do, and you can afford
&gt; it, go get one and we can all user your GL for parts.
&gt;
&gt; Heck, have you thought about disassembling it and selling the parts.
&gt; I bet you could double your original investment. :)

Funny you should ask!  My favorite line at a SOTO meet years ago, when a
bunch of us were standing around this early 60's Doublecab that had just
been waxed, but had huge patches of rust-through all around the
windshields, rocker panels, etc...  Guy next to me says in a moment when we
were all quiet and just staring at the thing: &quot;Best to just crush the thing
and get the crying over with!&quot;  I've revised that to &quot;Part it out and crush
it&quot; for the benefit of a few friends driving dinosaurs (Detroit iron, not
VW's).  Hm.  If there were only a few more EVs in the LA basin, I might
have a market...
