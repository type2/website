Subject: Westfalia Type II

I am new to this list server, and I realize most posters are
vanagonites.  But I will go ahead an raise my question anyway.

I drive a 1970 Westfalia, in very good condition, that has about
90,000 miles on a rebuilt engine.  It still only uses about a half
quart of oil between oil changes (every 1500 miles), but I am
starting to get some lower compression readings in one of the
cylinders.  And because I do a lot of camping with my wife and
our 4 year old and 5 month old, my comfort level with the current
engine is starting to be suspect..

My preference is to purchase a rebuilt long-block.  Is there
anyone out here who can give me some good advise on the
rebuild market?   I am familiar, in name, with rebuilds through GEX
and MOFOCO, but I am sure there are more as well as differences
between them.

Any information or guidance you can provide would be
appreciated.

Thanks
