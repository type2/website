Subject: Air-Cooled (Bread-loaf) Syncros!
Date: Wed, 23 Apr 1997 16:10:02 -0400

There were rumors  that the first syncros were breadloafs, and I once 
glimpsed a picture or two. Finally, I have the evidence, a photo of a
factory
4x4 breadloaf crawling up a snowbank. Several prototypes were built,
including
two Westies.
