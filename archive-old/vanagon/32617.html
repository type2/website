Subject: /f In Praise of Invisible Gloves

Hi All,

The other day I had a chance to try out a Christmas gift from my 
wife--a tube of 'Invisible Gloves'.  This stuff is a cream that you apply 
on your hands that coats them against grease etc. prior to getting dirty 
while working on the VWs.

I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised by their function, especially 
after a messy oil change.  The cleanup was a cinch!  One of the nicities 
about this stuff is that it works well around the fingernails, keeping 
the grease/oil/dirt out of them.  Sort of like cosmoline for the hands.
