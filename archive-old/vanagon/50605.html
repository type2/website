...or stupid things...

I used to have a '57 singlecab.  Now the heaters on these things were
not real swift in their new days, and like many splits, mine were non-
functional.  Eventually I put a '72-era motor in, with all the goodies
including that amazing fresh-air heating system I always dreamed of!  
With some careful fabrication, I connected the heater boxes to my rather
different-sized heater channels, got all the cables run, overhauled the
little knob-screw control, fixed the defroster lever can-thingy...

No heat.  Damn.  Well, maybe a pitiful amount, certainly no more hot
fresh air than the old oil-fume-pumping-stale-air heater gave.  Well, I
sent all the air to the defroster that cold morning, and drove off wiping
a little peep-hole on the windshield.

Here comes the hill!  Downshift, and rev that puppy up!  The twin Webers
and 1835cc's realy do pull an old singlecab well.  Well, that is, until 
I'm blinded and attacked by 20 years of mouse nests and pine seeds blasting
out of my defroster vents at mach 2!  I stop off the side of the road, and
get out looking much like Robin Williams the first time we see him in Jumanji.

I guess them mice found that open pipe under my truck as a haven all those
years, a silo, bedroom, birth-center free-from snakes VW mousie paradise.

Till it's death last year, I could only stand to run that heater sometimes --
it really cooked the bitty cab on that truck.  I'd hear about the little
wimpy VW heaters, and smile, knowing that they really could pump out some
significant heat into a small volume.  With significant force.
