&gt; This is more-or-less related to the original post.  I just bought a Sears
&gt; 36mm, 12pt socket to attack the gland nut on my engine.  I'd rather have
&gt; a 6pt, but Sears doesn't have one.  Will I screw up the nut with the 12pt
&gt; socket?

I have a 36mm Proto that I've done gland nuts and bug wheels with --
I've broken breaker bars with it, so I suppose it's ok. The only
time I needed a 6-pt is when trying to get a frozen gland nut off,
and ended up using an air chisel....
