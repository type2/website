Hi Dr.,

Mine look they are a plastic screen material simply cut to fit and glued in
place. I just took my screens from the '71 Rustfalia to the local hardware
store and had them rescreened for about $10 each. I bet you could do the
same with vanagon westy screens.

Good Luck!

&gt; I have found a set of Westi side windows with the screens but no
&gt; screen material in them,so:
&gt; 1. How hard is it to remove the screens from the windows?
&gt; 2. Can they be rescreened once they are off?
&gt;
