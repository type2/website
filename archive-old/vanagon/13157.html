I can testify to the usefulness of one of the Canadian designs; namely the
retractable power cord. Mine doesn't have it (its from CA) and so when I
plug in the battery charger or electric heater inside the Van and then run
the extension to the house from the outside, it is very difficult to get
a solid connection; only after scraping the three pronger can a good
connection be had. This occurs I believe because of exposure to the elements.


There is a blue air-cooled Westfalia here in town (the Glebe area) in pristine
shape.I believe it is an 82 also. It has the silver dash knob/hole of
which we know not  the purpose. But the headrests are different (they have
a hole in the middle) could this also be a Canadian requirement? Also the
power cord is much lower on the side.

The Van also sounds different - this may be because of the slightly
different exhaust/emission system required for Canada at the time (namely
CAT, O2 and EGR setup).
