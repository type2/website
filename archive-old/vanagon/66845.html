Subject:      Thanks for all of the help!

I just wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond to my
Eurovan questions; we bought it last night and will take delivery next
Saturday when I return from Alaska.  We're giddy.  The dogs will love
it!

On another note, today our house and two others on our street were
broken into.  Looks like my Greyhound was kicked around and then thrown
outside; he seems okay, but a little shaken.  I don't know how they kept
the Whippet from attacking...

Net loss?  A watch, couple of rings, and a old gold chain.  Oh.  And a
bottle of Scotch I recieved as a gift from my company's president.
The thief (or thieves) then took my 12 lb.log splitter / maul and used
it to break in to my neighbor's house.  Once inside they opened a *safe*
with it.  Handy knowledge if you should ever forget the combination.

I'm in pretty good spirits, as my family is okay and everything taken is
easily replacable.

Calling Guardian Alarm tomorrow...
