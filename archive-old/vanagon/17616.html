Subject: Re: Introduction and some questions

&gt;Well, we've moved to Palo Alto, Ca and Pacheco is too far to go.  Can anyone 
&gt;recommend a VW mechanic on the Peninsula we can trust?  I like doing my own 
&gt;work, but sometimes life is too short; I'd rather go on a picnic with my kids 
&gt;than spend another weekend under the van.

I've been going to Bugformance in Sunnyvale, on El Camino, for several years
and I'm very happy with them.  I recently had some work done at Fred's
Garage (which someone else mentioned) and they seemed like a cool shop.
