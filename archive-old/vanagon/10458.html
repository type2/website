I finally did it.  Add me to the stats ...
87 Vanagon GL, with weekender package, ac, excellent condition, 105K, for
4750$.

Many thanks to those of you who have responded to my sporadic requests over
the past six months.  (And thanks in advance for all the help that I will
surely need in the future).
