Subject: Re: Excellent Automotive Books--Add these to book Database

&gt; I discovered two automotive books at my local library that are worth
&gt; recommending.   Whoever is in charge of the recommended book archive should
&gt; add these to the list.  They are not VW-specific, but would be invaluable
&gt; additions to your personal automotive library (or at least worth checking
&gt; out of your local library).  The first is &quot;Tuning New Generation Engines for
&gt; Power and Economy&quot; by A. Graham Bell (1988, Haynes Publ., ISBN 0 85429 609
&gt; 
&gt; 
Whoa!  That A. Graham Bell has been around for a while.  Always keeping
on top of current technology, I tell ya!  First, the telephone, and now
he's writing for Haynes!
