Amen!

In addition:

I recently used a combination of stainless steel nuts, bolts &amp; washers and
anti-sieze compound when reassemblying my exhaust. Although won't be able to
see the fruits of this change for years, I'll bet that the next
dissassembly/reassembly will go much much easier.  I would recommend using
only stainless fasteners with anti-sieze for VW exhausts.
