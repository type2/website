Hello,


I pretty much skimmed the earlier discussion about these new Eurovan 
conversions because I am really not terribly interested in a Westy type 
vehicle these days.  This weekend I attended an auto show, and saw the 
Winnebago Westy type conversion.  It looked very similar to what has come 
before and had a sticker price of about $30,000.

However, what surprised me is that there was another Winnebago Eurovan 
conversion at the show as well.  This was a much larger vehicle that was 
truly a small motorhome, including a 110V generator etc..  Somehow, I can't 
imagine the 2.5 liter engine even making this thing move, since other 
vehicles of this size have hefty V8's.  And, it only came in an automatic!

The top views were approximately:

The big one had a sticker price of $46,000 and was on sale for $42,000.  Has 
any of you folks seen or driven the behemoth?

Thanks,
Mike
