Subject: Cal is powerless still


That's right, the Cal football team has no power, they are a bunch of
wimps! :) I liked the last take on &quot;Cal floods over&quot; so I thought I
should continue...

Dammit Janet, I go into the weekend with no electricity still. I
really hope I have some for the niners/cowboys game on Sunday!! I
mean, if I lived in a VW bus I would at least have a fridge and heater
to make me comfy.

No one has given me an update on the Copley's travels, doesn't someone
know where they are?! I also need to apologize to them...my roommate
was a dick to them when they stayed over on Sunday - I can't apologize
*for* him (especially since he meant to be a dick), but I can
apologize for not telling him to shut the f*ck up and kicking his ass.
