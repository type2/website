Subject: Power Brake Booster 71 Bus

Hi folks,

A few questions for the power brake endowed:

I'm resurrecting the aged (currently disconnected) power assist system on my
71 Bus.  The original large vacuum hoses are cracked and falling apart.  Is
it possible to replace these with heater/coolant hose or is there a &quot;special
vacuum-only reinforced rubber&quot; hose needed for this application?

It appears my master cylinder has been leaking fluid where it meets with the
booster.  I suspect this bodes ill for my (booster) diaphram as I've read in
the archives.  Can anyone recommend a good source for the booster should I
need one?

Also, I can't seem to find the vacuum line check valve that the Bentley
manual mentions (prevents pressure from an engine backfire from damaging
diaphram in booster?).  I checked the vacuum hoses and found no such valve.
Do I need a valve specifically for my bus or can I go generic on this (i.e.
one from a Dodge Caravan, Ford Windstar etc...)

Curiosity question:  There is a hose that comes off the front of the power
booster that joins to a metal tube that disappears into the wheel well sheet
metal.  Is this some type of vent tube?  If so, why is it venting into my
body panels???

Parts Buy:

For all you 71-72 bus people, I just ordered new front rotors from
Mofoco--only $36 each (Wow, what a bargain!).
