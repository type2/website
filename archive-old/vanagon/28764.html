Subject: RE: Early 70's Van with Toyota Engine


&gt;i was camped out in stone mt, ga when i saw this vw van (1970 i believe) 
with
&gt;a radiator in back where the engine compartment door should be. i talked to
&gt;the
&gt;owner he said he bought it and it had a Toyota Corolla engine in it. he 
didn't
&gt;know any details about the conversion it took or anything. he had great 
heat
&gt;coming from the heater...it ran quiet, never overheated. how the hell do 
you
&gt;get a toyota engine in a vw van?

Verrrrrry carefully...

Using the adapter kit from Kennedy Engineered Products probably helps, too.
