Subject: Metric Cubic Measurements of '84 Westy

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

I've been quoted $60 US per cubic metre to transport an '84 Westy by
freighter. This week,  I'm separated from both my Westy and my Bentley
manual. Can anyone figure the dimension of a Westy from the bottom of the
tires to the top of the camper top?
