Subject: Re: window rubber: removing those unsightly plastic thingies

On second reading of Donald Baxter's note, I've understood him to be asking
about the WINDOWS, not the TRIM.  The windows are not virtually impossible
to get back in, but they are difficult enough that I would do it only in
the course of repairing rust around the windows and maybe painting the whole
car.  Or changing out the aluminum trimmed side windows for late black trim
ones.

The job takes two people, and it should be someone you like a lot or not at
all, so that the relationship won't change when you swear at each other.
