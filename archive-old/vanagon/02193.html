According to Brent Applhead Jarvi:
&gt; 
&gt; I got hhis of DC.for.sale.  I tought you fellow VW lovers might like
&gt; to read it, or send this Chucklehead some mail
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a 71 VW Bus which I NEED to sell, soon! I am moving and it has
&gt; &gt; to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Do us all a favor and junk that under-powered piece.  It has no place trying
&gt; to merge onto the heavily traveled roads around here.
&gt; 
&gt; 0-60 in 20 sec is a danger to us all.
&gt; 
60 mph?!?!?!? when's the last time anyone saw DC rush hour traffic at
even close to that speed....and the other times there's enough room on 
the road for all....I-66 is getting the nickname of Disney's Parking Lot
'cause of the theme park they're building there and the 30 minutes it takes
to go a couple of miles!!!!!!  A bus is hardly a nuisance under these       
conditions although it does suck being out in the heat in stopped traffic...
I wish I had access to DC.for.sale...

&gt; Also about this trip.  I am definatly interested but I have heard nothing
&gt; about the plans over here on the east coast, near DC, NYC, Philly, and points
&gt; south.
&gt; 
Ditto here!!!!  I'm moving to Texas at the end of the summer and definitely 
would be interested in a part of the trip if it came down this way!!!  Looks
like I'd be at the tail end, so I hope everyone doesn't get tired or drop
out by then.... ;)
