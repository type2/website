One more thing to look out for on your Vanagon's.  The front control arm
bushings.  I just had to change mine.  170,000 km with new tires about two
months ago and I just noticed the fronts wearing more on the inside.  I
bring it to the VW shop for alignment as the camber is probably out and he
says he can't put it right cause the upper control arm bushings are gone. 
VW wanted $55.00 each bushing, there are four.  I finally found them for
$30. each and changed them myself.  It's   an easy job to do about a hour
each side.  Remove the upper control arm as you will need to cut the small
tack weld the frisky little Germans put on the bushings to keep them from
turning in the control arm.  After that just hammer them out and hammer in
the new ones.    One other note about these Vanagons.  If you have a
locking gas cap keep your eye on it.  I had a service station attendant
put gas in and some how he did not get it put on right and it fell off
somewhere.  The kicker in all this is VW wants $95.00 for the thing,
YETCH, for a gas cap ?????  And one more thing while I'm in the mood. 
Water pumps.  Where do we get GOOD ONES ??  I just had to change mine
again !  Last one I put in last October so it didn't even make a year and
not much milage either.  The guy at the parts place told me I put the belt
to tight, RIGHT !  I've been tightening fan belts for over 30 years now
and have not lost a water pump before these.  Seems to me a cheapo bearing
or cheapo casting or an overall cheapo pump !  They go for $120.00 a pump
up here.  All these prices being quoated are in Canadian Dollars, the ones
with the Beavers s on the back.

Cheers

Frank
