C'mon Sean, cut this guy some slack... We all screw up sometime :-)
Cetin

On the matter of the 'recovery force' or whatever we may decide to
call it, my Home Phone number is 610-868-5873, we live in Bethlehem,
PA (I-78 corridor, Eastern PA), we have a garage, some tools, an extra
bed to crash in, if a listmember needs help, and I might even get my
wife's permission to go look at a VW every now and then.

BTW, Bob's suggested method is exactly how I acquired the '87... Ric
(Golen) actually found it and test drove it for me... Thanks Ric.

 &gt; far as I know I'm not busting on a list memeber.  If I am, sorry.
