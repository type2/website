Subject: breather hose:-)|:-(  

Got my parts today.  Tranny boot, lock-washers, air-filter, and breather
hose.  All correct parts.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that my
$26 length of breather hose was only one meter long, not the five meters
that the 'fiche said I was getting.  The invoice says &quot;1 length&quot;
(&quot;Non-determinism means never having to say you're wrong&quot;).

The parts manager says that one meter is what I get - not five.
I may never know if this is true or they have a wonderful pyramid scheme
running on 'order five::sell one' then sell each of the other four for the
price of five meters.  A nice scheme.

 This does not leave me with the vast surplus that I'd imagined.  I'll have
to check to see how many more 180mm lengths I can get out of what's left
before I can decide to sell some (I had two orders so far).  I'll let you
know.
