&gt; I have used BarsLeak for the last 50k plus with excellent results in my
&gt; '85. I've mentioned this a couple times on the mailing list but have
&gt; received little comment. I think the tendency is to stay away from any
&gt; type of stop leak gunk out of fear that it might muck up the cooling
&gt; system. I have instinctively stayed away from the powdered aluminum
&gt; products out of such fears but the BarsLeak product has proven itself
&gt; to me.

Steve,

What is the material in the BarsLeak?  I presume it is doing some kind
of coating.  My concerns I'd have is that it could coat the radiator
in such a way that the radiator couldn't do it's job as well.  The other
concern would be that it would coat the sensors such that they could not do
their jobs either.  Clogging is a concern too.  How many miles have you
driven after you've added this stuff?  And did you start using it before
or after you started having leaks?  And where were the leaks.

Hope that's not too many questions.  :)
