Subject: Re: Losing Power

&gt; surging... the power would be there, and then go away... in about 5 second
&gt; cycles.
&gt; 
&gt; - I went through fuel really fast... like 3/4 of a tank over the last 90
&gt; miles. 

Before going thru a lot of work, check the tail pipe for soot.  If
black, disconnect 02 sensor.  See if that doesn't take care of the
problem.
