Subject: Windshield Sunshield for Vanagons

While at my local Price Club (Sam's, BJ's whatever you may have...or not), I 
found a plethora of windshield sunshields that fit my Vanagon perfectly.  It is 
collapsible and fits under the driver's seat in a provided 1' by 1' flat bag.	
	The model is:
		NEW!  IMPROVED FIT  REFLEX SUN SHIELD 2....DELUXE SIZE...FITS CARS 
		29&quot;h by 58&quot;w.
	One side of the shield (the side that faces out) is reflective, and the other 
side is available in tan, light blue, silver, and black.
	The price is the best feature at $3.99 plus that annoying little bite the good 
state of Maryland takes.  
	I bring this up because I will be at the Carlisle show over the weekend and if 
there is interest, I could pick up a few more to take with me.  I'm not looking to make 
a profit. Each unit will cost the buyer....$34.95.....oops! pressed the wrong button on 
the calculator...$4.19...we're at 5% tax here.
	Just let me know before Thursday...and tell me the desired color.  I'll probably 
be doing the same at some of the other east coast shows.
							Later,
