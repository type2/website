Subject: Re: Engine cleaning

Hi There.  I just use a low pressure garden hose with a nozzle on it 
to produce a small gentle spray, an old chamois and a bucket of soapy 
water.   Rinse, and chamois dry :)  I wash it every spring, and wipe 
the compartment down at every oil change to minimize buildup.  I keep 
water away from the ignition system, and electricals in general.  
Even the engine lid comes out nicely.

If you have a greasy engine, you might want to try an engine 
degreaser or that Citric Orange stuff.... that works pretty good, but 
slower.... I use that on my bike chain with reasonable success.

Hope this helps,
Harry.

&gt; Now that spring is almost here, does anyone know a good procedure for
&gt; washing the waterboxer engine.  Is a high pressure hose safe?  Can you
&gt; use engine degunk?
&gt; Thanks,
