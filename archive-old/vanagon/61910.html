Pioneer PIO TSA 1086  auto speaker.  They're &quot;identical&quot; in size to the
factory Blaupunkt; actually just a tad larger. I enlarged the front panels
slightly for them, but just pushed hard on the rear overhead molding.
Besides the molding is HARD to cut. Not much room for extra size, but extra
depth would work. The front ones sound like they have more bass; perhaps
the physics of the location or the peculiarities of the radio, wires...? My
audio knowledge is basic and my &quot;ear&quot; is even more ignorant. They look
pretty good!
Bought 'em at Circuit City.
Estra weight wouldn't be a problem.

Philip
