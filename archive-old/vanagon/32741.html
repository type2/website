&gt;&gt;
&gt;theres a good chance your heaters hot water switch is stuck on &amp; when you 
&gt;adjust the cable it just bends.  Pull out your spare and look up inside the 
&gt;box up in there &amp; you'll see where the cable turns the switch, wd40 it then 
&gt;use a bicycle cable lubricator to lube the cable (ask a bike mechanic).

Chirs,

Thanks, I'll take a look and give it a try.  Just as soon as I find where the
snow plow burried it!
