&gt;Underneath it all it said &quot;Schalegensnsbus&quot; or something like that.
&gt;It meant turtle bus....if anyone wants to see it I can prolly scan it.
&gt;
I'd like to see the scan--I can use it for a bitmap on my BBS if nothing
else . . .
Anyone, by the way, into disc golf?  (Subject of my BBS) . . .
