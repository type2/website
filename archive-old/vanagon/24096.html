&gt; Hi Thom--I was intrigued by your homemade-sounding interior
&gt; panels, would you mind giving me some more details of what
&gt; you did?  (post the lists too I'm sure it would be appreciated).
&gt; 
&gt; My '62 bus has NO interior of any kind except a rubber mat and a
&gt; rear bed/seat out of a '70 Westy.  (and yes it really makes
&gt; the bus quieter to have the very back portion in there)

Well, first I got some super heavy duty cardboard stuff from a local
upholstery shop.  I think the biggest problem mmost people have when doing 
interiors is getting the proper material.

I cut the panels, in some cases going on an old one, and in others just
WAG-ging it.

For the areas around the windows, I just glued vinyl (headliner vinyl,
to be exact) to the painted metal)

I then covered the panels with a simple plaid print cloth.  I thought about
doing them in vinyl, but the $$$ held me back.  The vinyl runs about $12-$15
per yard, and I would have needed about 10-15 yards, to do everything.  The
cloth ran me about $25, and was easier to work with.

I use 1/4&quot; foam underneath the cloth, which makes the panels look, well,
padded.  I'm convinced it adds a small amount of noise insulation, too.

For adhesive I use 3M Super 77.  You can also use Super 90 (more $$$) but
stay away from &quot;General Trim Adhesive&quot; - doesn't work.

If people want, I could write a sremonnette on covering the panels, but its
pretty easy one you learn a couple of tricks.
