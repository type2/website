Subject: '85 Westy fridge noise

 Yesterday, I left my '85 Westy in the parking lot of the local golf course
while I hacked around for nine holes.  Outside air temp was about 100 F.
When I finished, I noticed a noise coming from the area of the fridge.  (The
ignition was off).

The thermostat was set for max cool.  The power rocker was set for 120V AC,
but there was no AC being brought in.  I turned the power rocker to propane
and the thermostat to  minimum and the noise continued.  Not knowing what
else to do, I drove home.  The noise was present when I parked the car in
the garage but stopped in a minute or two.

Any ideas what this noise might be?  Do I have a mixed up power rocker?  Am
I hearing a noise coming from the engine compartment?

Thanks,



Rob
