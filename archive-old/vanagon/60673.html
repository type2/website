Subject: engine swap on 86 syncro
Date: Fri, 30 May 1997 00:58:40 -0700

Hi everyone, 

looking for info on converting 86 syncro to 85 ,1.8 GTI. I have a complete
motor,but
i need info on a adapter,flywheel, clutch,oil pan,exhaust,engine mounts,and
some 
price's on some of these part's if anyone has any. If this project gets
under way, I
plan to use a progresive 2 barrel on a omni 1.7 intake manifold, untill i
get the bug's worked out, and later to cis injection.
   
                                                  looking foward to hearing
from everone soon
                                                                   thanks  
  
                                                                           
          Shawn
