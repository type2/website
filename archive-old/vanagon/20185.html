Subject: Re: ' Westy waterpump/fridge relay * update
Date: Tue, 4 Jul 1995 06:42:00 -0400 (EDT)

I think I've finally gotten this thing sorted out, with the help of a few
of you, especially Derck.     The   relay is an ordinary relay and must be
good for at least 30 amps as it must switch the fridge power.  The relay
is for making sure the fridge only works when the ignition is on.  The
power to the water pump bypasses the relay to allow the water pump to
opperate any time.      So there, not so complicated after all.  Why is
there not a wireing diagram of this in the workshop manual ?   Some
miscomunication between Westfalia and Volkswagen.  They didn't go out to
dinner together that day or what ????  Anyways, my problem is over for
this time around.  BUT, wait when I was out last evening I noticed that
the brake pedal was going pretty-well-all-the-way-to-the-floor UG ! Even
double UG !  Never a dull moment with this Westy !
