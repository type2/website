&gt;I just bought a '86 Westfalia Syncro.  I have tried to find out how the
&gt;Syncro
&gt;is supposed to work and nobody seems to know.  A lot of people &quot;think&quot; they
&gt;know how they are supposed to work, but it all sounds like BS. The guy I
&gt;bought it from said that I had power to the rear all the time and when there
&gt;was any slipage in the rear, power is automatically transfered to the front
&gt;tires.  He said that the only time I would lock the differential is if I was
&gt;stuck.  I own a 4-WD and always lock the front hubs when I am driving in the
&gt;snow or sand.  Why wouldn't I want to lock the differential if chains are
&gt;required or if I am driving over sand to PREVENT from getting stuck?  Also
&gt;when I make a tight turn and turn the steering wheel all the way to one side
&gt;or the other there is a definite resistance as if the front tires are not in
&gt;synch with the rear.  Is this how it is supposed to be?
&gt;
&gt;Anybody know for real?

Craig,
Welcome to the world of Syncros!  It's always nice to have another
Syncronaut.

The Syncro system operates just like the seller says it does.  The 4WD action
occurs only when you begin to lose traction at the rear wheels.  There are no
hubs to lock or unlock.

The rear differential lock is a seperate system from the Syncro system and
was an option, thus some Syncros have them &amp; some don't.

A differential lock rigidly locks the left and right axels together
eliminatint the ability of the differential to allow them to spin at
different (differential) speeds.  This greatly aids in the amount of traction
that can be applied to the ground, since one wheel on a slick surface will
not stop the vehicle with the lock engaged.

Aftermarket differential locks (or lockers as they're called in the 4x4
community) can be installed in most pickups and sport utility vehicles.  A
few vehicles (like the Toyota Land Cruiser) can now be purchased with lockers
from the manufacturer.

With a manually engageable locker like the Syncro's, it is ideally engaged
just before you get stuck, thus preventing you from actually getting stuck.
 It is o.k. to engage the locker anytime you're on a loose surface such as
snow, loose-ish dirt, mud, etc.  Excessive wear &amp; driveline strain will occur
if the locker is engaged on pavement, rocks, or any other high traction
surface.

Have fun with your &quot;new&quot; Syncro!
