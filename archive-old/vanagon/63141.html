Subject:      FS: extra single seat

howdy people-

forgive the fs post, but i'm trying to scrape up some money for a down
payment on a house.  anyway...

i've got an original 'extra' single seat (the seat that slides in the tracks
between the front and rear seats) from my '85 Westy. it has a dark brown
base and tan/beige upholstery. this seat has full rotation and also has the
extra storage compartment underneath.  it is in extraordinary condition.

i live in gainesville, fl. and can deliver it to the surrounding areas
(within a days drive or so).  not certain if it can be shipped because it's
so darned heavy.  best offer owns it.  thanks.

Rik
