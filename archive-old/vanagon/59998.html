Subject: Part# Air-intake behind panel


Hello,

sorry to waste the bandwidth, but I can't remember who asked
me for the part number of that air-intake manifold which
sits behind the panel in the top left rear corner of the van:

251 129 533  manufacturer code KYS

This is only a 40cm snorkel which goes into a oval downpipe
into a knee with the airfilter of a Diesel. The downpipe is
made of paper/aluminium and is a separate item.
