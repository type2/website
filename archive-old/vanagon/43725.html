Subject: '68 Westy FS (NICE)

I list this one seperately as I went to see it and am duly impressed, 
alas a bit too much for me, for a collector maybe not.

'68 Velvet Green origional paint and everything Westy
This thing is incredibly nice in a number of ways, origional
owner brought back from Germany on tourist program, all shipping 
reciepts etc from new, including the $148 or so to ship it over.
Before leaving, BN-4 heater installed and some other options.
All brochures etc from new. 103k miles, Ziebart new, TENT NEVER USED (I 
was going to buy it seperately but could not break this up).
Bus generally shows 25+ years of meticulous loved and cared for use, 
paint is generally quite nice though, 2 creases from small trailer 
jacknife on rear right corner (not bad at all), pop top is still smooth 
and beautiful, garaged all its life except for vacations, ice box 
replaced with custom imported from England Electrolux fridge, origional 
ice box retained.  From the rockers up this bus is PERFECT small dings 
here and there, needs polished, chips up front but damn near PERFECT.
Now the rockers unfortunately Ziebart never figured how to do correctly 
and they show a few small holes, front right jack point needs replaced, 
heater tube gone and replaced nicely but not origionally, and rear of 
wheelwells shows rust along joint with floor coming through, BUT this is 
the second nicest BUS I have seen in my life (I bought the nicer one) 
with the tent and all the records, this is setting up to be a real 
impressive show piece.  The owners are wonderful we BS'ed for hours even 
after I told them it was simply too rich for my blood, I ended up buying 
a DeVilbis air compressor off the guy we had great fun taking it apart. 
 The story is the old guy had a stroke 3 years back, his right side is 
pretty bad and they won't let him drive a standard, his wife does not 
drive, they just picked up a '94 Jetta.  They fed me lunch, these are 
good nice people, unfortunately as I only paid $3800 for my mint '77 I 
could not see paying the $5775 they ask but it is worth it.  With the 
small amount of metal work it needs and spot repaints This is a $10k 
show bus, heck the value of a new in package tent is anyones guess they 
paid nearly $800 for it in '68.  I was not going to post this one as I 
was hoping to go back and make and offer later but less someone less 
worthy buy it I submit it to the list.  Call the man talk to him and go 
look if interested, you will not be dissapointed.  He rebuilt the engine 
top end a few years back.
