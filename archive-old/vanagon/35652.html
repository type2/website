&gt;Well, chalk one up for the idiot factor. The CV I repacked last Fall came

&gt;
&gt;Well, I lost two of the bolts/screws out of it and several of them seem to
&gt;have damaged threads. I'll check the local hex-head bolt vendor and see
&gt;what I can come up with. Fortunatly, nothing LOOKS damaged...except,
&gt;perhaps my confidence in other repairs I've performed. ;0 (Guess this 
&gt;makes a good case for going back and double checking reparis from time to 
&gt;time.)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all the good tips. I'm glad all the expensive ideas were off base.

&gt;Cheap fix anyway, Joe!!!

I ahd the same thing happen to a 1982 Diesel Rabbit a long time ago!!

Sorry to hear all the bolts got scored up.
