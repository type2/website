&gt; That do-dad is the thermostat that is temperature sensitive and the
&gt; cable it is connected to is suppose to operate the flaps that direct/
&gt; restrict air from the fan housing to the engine.  I'm a die-hard fanatic
&gt; about having those flaps hooked up and working properly.  On colder
&gt; mornings it allows the engine to warm up ASAP which reduces engine
&gt; wear.  I strongly recommend that you make sure that it gets hooked
&gt; up and working.  The Bentley manual will give you the details you
&gt; need to do this.  Your gonna hear from others out there that don't
&gt; think it's worth it to hook up, but I just feel it's worth the 
&gt; trouble cause it's not that hard to do and it's not that complicated.

You gonna listen to advice from a guy that drives a Wasserboxer??  :)

I have mine disconnected, but it probably isn't a good idea to leave it
that way unless you are in a very warm climate and always take the time to
warm your engine up properly.  Even then...
