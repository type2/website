Subject: Trip to Red Rocks, Colorado and Phish, and Camping Mods.

After a long summer of working, (12 hour days on average in the moving
industry) im going to take a road trip in my 85 GL, to morrison, colorado
from northern virginia. Im planning to see phish out there and do some
hiking for a week.  I think my van will make it, it has never given me any
problems in the year that i have had the priveledge to own it.  However, i
was wondering if any vanagon-friends who would be close to Route 70, would
be willing to offer a hand, incase of a break down?  Ill be carrying my
parents cellular phone.  Also, if anyone here is going to be traveling to
the same place, tell me and maybe we can meet up or travel together a bit of
the way.

Camping modifications i will be making.

Im going to be adding an additional battery, and what i am looking for is a
HIGH current switch witch will give me a make-before-break action so i can
switch between batteries.

I am going to add a flourescent light (energy efficient) light in the back
for use during the night.  

I am going to put a folding table in.
