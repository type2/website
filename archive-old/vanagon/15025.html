&gt; &gt; The actual date is Sunday, April 9. However, I think several of us are
&gt; &gt; going up Saturday, the 8th, in the evening, to camp out so as to be
&gt; &gt; there at 9 or so when they open up.
&gt; 
&gt; Really?  From the sound of it I thought no one was going to camp over 
&gt; anywhere.  So... if you're planning on it, tell Martha.

DOH! much though I wish I could attend the California show to which
I think you are referring, I don't think I could make it there by Sunday,
as this show is in N.C. Since we're camping, does that mean the east
coast is actually doing something you super-westerners are not doing?
:)
Anyway, hope all you have fun as well. maybe you can make an mpeg out of
the video tape...
