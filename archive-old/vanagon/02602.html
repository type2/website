&gt; I own one of their 5 gallon showers and my wife and I both find that
&gt; push/pull valve to be impossible to close with soapy hands, so be
&gt; warned!  I was thinking of adding a pinch type thingie that squeezes
&gt; the tube shut to stop the water flow. I've got a nice one I use for
&gt; homebrewing beer, but don't know where else I'd find one of these.

My first try would be a phography/visual arts supply store.  We use
these things to clamp the chemical replenishment hoses.

P.S. Random comment:
If you liked _Forrest Gump_ the movie, read _Forrest Gump_ the book--
It's different and better (though not little or yellow).  :)
