Subject: ABSOLUTELY LAST CALL FOR LIST T-SHIRT ORDERS!!!!!! 
Date: Wed, 01 Nov 95 17:01:25 EST
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

Ok, gang, this is it. I am ordering the second super-cool, wonderful
batch of shirts next week, so if you want one, ORDER NOW PLEASE!!!!
:)
Thanks to David for putting a picture on his web page; check it out if
you haven't seen one. BTW, the wrinkles in the picture are from the
picture of the shirt, not the design....
So anyway, orders in now, please. I hope to get them in your hands by
Christmas...
details are below.
Thanks
Richard



 Ok then, I have been persuaded to do another batch of list t-shirts, so
EVERYONE can have one. I will plan to have these out in time for
Christmas, as they will make lovely presents (hint, hint). I am placing
the order the first part of November, so there is time, but please, if
you are ordering, do it as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Also, I will change around some of the colors from the first run, just
to differentiate, so if you want to , feel free to order another if you
got the first one...
Here's the deal for those not aware:
High quality 100% cotton t-shirts, of a natural, earth-tone.
5 color screen print design, featuring front views of all 4 generations
of transporters, as well as &quot;NETVERGNU:GEN&quot;, and the list address in
computer-style type.
To get one, mail an index card with your:
-name
-e-mail address
-mailing address
- SIZE OF T-SHIRT!!!!!
and a check (prices explained below)
to:
Richard Palmer

Pricing information
the prices of shirts go down as the quantity ordered goes up, due to
both price breaks in the plain shirt cost, as well as the diffusion of
the printing cost. Since most of the regulars already ordered shirts, I
doubt as many will be sold this time. In addition, mailing costs were
more than I thought.
therefore, prices are as follows, and include shipping and handling:
shirt, sizes S-XL = $16.00
shirt, size XXL   = $17.50
shirt, orders outside the United States = add $5.00 shipping/handling
PER SHIRT.

DISCLAIMER:
As the US Mail screwed me on the last shipment, with about a 2% failure
rate, I must state that I cannot be held responsible for shirts lost in
the mail. All orders are sent 1st class, multiple orders sent priority
mail, so they should be shipped properly. As a poor recent college
graduate, I cannot afford to cover Uncle Sam's screw-ups, and while I will be
really sorry, I can't do anything as far as a refund.
If you are really scared about that, for an additional $6.75, I can ship
it registered mail. Like I said, 1 loss out of 54 isn't bad, but it is
still inexcusable on their part. Anyway...

If you want a shirt, please order now!
If you are unsure as to the quality or appeal, feel free to ask any of
the list members that have one for their opinions. I have heard rave reviews
from around the continent!
Anyway, thank you all, and please order soon, and enjoy your bus!
Richard
Therefore, please send a check for the appropriate amount.
