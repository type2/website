 A while back, I was doing some engine searching myself and I recall VW
having
 a core charge policy such that if the core was damaged internally from
engine
 failure, they would still refund the core charge.  The only time they would
 deny the core charge refund was from external damage such as a fire or
 collision.  Of course VW charges about $2,400 for their longblock, but it
 might be worth checking out.  I recall hearing this core &quot;policy&quot; at a VW
 dealer.  I did not see it in writing and I did not hear it directly form a
VW
 representative - so if you pursue this, check it out carefully.

The above is correct.  The engine must however be assembled and complete
including the lower.  Any mechanical failure will be accepted.  Including a
rod through the top.  Thier core charge though is about $1100.00.  This is
not a mistake.  They want that motor  back bad. You must also exchange like
kind..You can not get a 2.1 and turn in a 1.9.  You may wan to consider
buying a 1.9 elsewhere and paying the core charge.  Although the engine
quality may differ, the extra ponies are worth it.

Dennis.
