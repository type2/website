Subject: Re: Canadian Camper Rentals?

&gt;We are planing a trip to Nova Scotia, Canada this summer.  We want to spend
&gt;a couple of weeks camping, but we will be flying and won't be able to bring
&gt;our Westy :(  Does anyone know of a canadian company which rents VW campers
&gt;or even a Winnebago rental place?  You know, like 1-800-Cruise USA (or
&gt;whatever it is).  Any suggestions from our canadian friends?

I'm in New Brunswick, (300 miles to Halifax, N.S.) will check around for 
you, but.... where are you flying into?  tim s.
