Subject: Re: *&amp;^%_at_ gas gauge!!!

&gt; For me the issue is the randomness of the gauge. There is no definite
&gt; point at which the gauge will always say .5 gal left....I have lowered
&gt; the tank to replace the handbrake cable and it is a messy and difficult
&gt; job. Replacing the sender is a no go at this stage. The second gauge
&gt; sounds interesting - how much do they cost? DC -- 

They _do_ read differently at rest and underway.  I've never figured
out whether this is due to changes in gas tank attitude while moving
or current flow.  If I think I'm getting too low for comfort, I'll stop for
a minute on a level surface.  That reading seems to be more accurate 
than what you get while moving.
