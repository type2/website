Subject: Koolatron cooler

Ok Chris, I think the westy fridge kicks butt campared to the Koolatron.
But to buy one of these Westie Models in Canada costs about $700. My
Koolatron cost me $80 with tax. Yes it does take time to heat up &quot;45
minutes&quot; but when it does I have no problem with milk, meat or beer! I have
run this thing for on year with no probs. I use it in the winter to keep my
gloves warm.:)

If u can afford a to buy a Westy model they are much better.

Ps I leave the fridge run all night and have no prob starting the van. I
will hook up a solar panel to it this summer.
