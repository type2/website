Subject: 1989 VW Vanagon Carat For Sale

Folks, 
This is a Vanagon FS in a shopping center parking lot near here(Baltimore).
Its a 89 Carat, burgundy, seating for 7, includes the foldup table.
Air conditioning, automatic transmission, new tires, state inspected, 
100,000 miles.  Also cruise control.

THE GOOD
-nice looking inside and out
-state inspected
-$5500 (I don't know how firm)

THE BAD
-has been &quot;keyed&quot; half way up the passenger side.  One single scratch half
the length of the van.....
-nose(front) damage.  Looks like it hit a pickup truck's rear bumper slightly.
Not much damage at all(no rust or anything) but the radiator cover is missing.
-looks as if a decent oil leak around #3 cylinder.  It was fresh oil, not
water.

Overall a VERY nice van that could use touchup paint and a radiator grille.
I have not driven it, but could if someone was interested.
Phone #- 410-706-0225
work- 410-667-3423
