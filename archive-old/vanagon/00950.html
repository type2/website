&gt; Joseph,
&gt; Of course you are absolutely right that a VW van is the ticket for
&gt; vacationing!  Generally, though I have a '71, I recommend a post '71
&gt; model because the engines have more displacement/power.  Also, the
&gt; price of parts has gone up steadily in the last couple of years, while
&gt; availability has gone down locally.  You must be a true VW survivalist
&gt; if you want to go with the vintage models.  IF you are mechanically
&gt; inclined, there's nothing like the satisfaction of driving your own
&gt; hand-crafted vehicle. If not, make sure you test the compression and
&gt; inspect for rust/corrosion at the very least, before you take the plunge.

You're assuming that this person does not want air conditioning.  Maybe
you can survive without it, but on a long trip I'll bet most people want
it.  Can't be without the comforts of home ya know.  

For the price range, I'd say a '79 or later.  Not too old and plenty of power 
'for the load.  You don't have to adjust the valves, so tune-ups are a snap.  
When you go to look at them be sure to check the engine compartment out.  
If it looks like it hasn't been cared for, I'd pass it up.  Make sure all of 
the gaskets are in place and the belts are good.  If it looks neglected, don't 
buy it.  Look for any kind of fuel leaks.  Use your nose and eyes and ears.  

Oh, make sure to get a porta-potti.  They're great for camping!  One of those
portable gas grills are quite useful too.
