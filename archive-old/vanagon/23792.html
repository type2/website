Subject: Wheel bearings, brass drifts

	Wheel-bearing races can be gently tapped-out of drums just
as they can be gently tapped in- the tool of choice (if you don't have
an arobor press and those nifty blocks you see in the Bentley manual)
is a brass drift. A brass drift is a handly lenght of brass bar stock.
mine is 1/2&quot; and about 9&quot; long. Its softer, MUCH softer, than the
steel race or the iron drum, so it doesn't mar or distort the race
when you tap it. Buy some brass stock whereever you can get it cheap
and cut it to size. Give the extra to your friends. 

	NATURALLY, use common sense, move the drift around in a star
pattern just like tightening wheel nuts or head nuts. 
	Tap at 12 o'clock
	Tap at 7 o'clock
	Tap at 2 o'clock
	Tap at 9 o'clock
	Tap at 4 o'clock
	Tap at 11 o'clock
	etc. 
	Use a regular carpenters hammer or whatever you're comfortable
with, start gentle and watch what happens as you go. Note that there is
a flat part on the backinside of the race to tap it out with, and a flat
edge around outside front to tap it in. Use a file to dress your drift
flat before you start, and if it distorts too badly during.

	I put anti-sieze on everything, so I probably put just a little
between the bearing race and the drum.

	Good luck, and let us know how it goes!
	Bill
