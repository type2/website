I wrote that in Seattle BP blends ethanol in the winter for CO reduction air 
pollution control.  Our Vanagon stalls and has poor power on this mixture (I 
think it is 10% ethanol).  We also use Chevron and Texaco and they are 
blending something and we haven't had a problem.  In Denver the used to use 
MTBE for the same purpose and it always worked fine (maybe better than 
normal gas!).  I read or heard that this could somehow contribute to water 
accumulation in fuel filter or elsewhere.  That seems counter intuitive to 
me because you can use alcohol to chase water out of a fuel system.
