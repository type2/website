Subject: Re: What weight motor oil?

My VW dealer also uses either 10W40 or 15W40 here in MA. I drove on this
for 8500 miles across the US and back last summer with no problems. Dealer
knew that I was doing trip and said that this weight was appropriate for
the '91 Westy. They actually used 15W40 Mobil oil - I was surprised! My
Toyota dealer has always used Castrol 10W40, and I always used the Castrol
10W40 in my Triumph Spitfire -- a 27 year histroy of daily drivers with 
10W40 Castrol.

	Comments?

&gt; &gt;I don't want to start another week long discussion on motor oil.
&gt; &gt;But what weight oil should I put in my 84 Westy.  I have been told
&gt; &gt;several things.  Right now I am leaning toward 20w-50. ??????

&gt; I would bet that the CW on the net says 20W50.  Certainly for summer in
&gt; most parts of the world this would seem to make sense.  However, I just got
&gt; my oil changed at a VW dealer.  They used 15W40 and claimed this is per VWs
&gt; recommendation.  I am not that well versed on the topic but think this may
&gt; be regional.  Vancouver is cool year round so I am not worried if someone
&gt; got it wrong.  
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, the oil change was free (C$7.00 for the filter).  All I had to
&gt; do was download a coupon from the net.
