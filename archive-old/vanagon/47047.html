&gt;My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is 
&gt;a noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the 
&gt;dash.  I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of
the 
&gt;heater controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in
mid
&gt;summer.
&gt;
&gt;Is this a common problem? What's the diagnosis and what's the fix?
&gt;Many thanks in advance,

I had this on the Syncro.  On mine the cable for the heater valve needed
to be adjusted.  You can do it after you remove the instrument  panel. 
There is a 7mm (I believe) bolt holding it (the cable) in a bracket and
after loosening said bolt you can move the cable left and right.  You
should move yours to the right.  On mine you could not move the lever
all the way to the right and have it line up with the other three
levers.  It was always a little to the left.

Hope this helps.
