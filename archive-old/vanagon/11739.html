I took the afternoon off and headed back out to the junkyard again,
to get more stuff off the '67 bus they have out there ( U Pull It, Mack
ROad, Sacramento)

I got 6 poput windows, door latches, engine lid latches, wiper, light
and flasher switches, steering wheel, and the big trophy, the piece that
goes underneath the master cylider and stuff, which I knew existed but
never actually saw one before.  I also got the gas tank.      

I really wanna get the steering box, which looks new, but the bus
is _sitting_ on it!  D'oh!

There is still good window glass and frames, although they don't have
the latches.  The speedo is still there, gass guage got taken by someone
else.

Not much else left!  Busses don't last long in junkyards around here!
