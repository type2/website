Hi All,

For you few, fortunate and far between 'Barndoor' owners out there, I
have 4) 5.50 x 16&quot; 'Dunlop Gold' nylon belted tires and tubes for these 
old buses.  There is some weatherchecking, but lotsa tread.  They're 
UPS-able.  email me if you're interested and you'll probably end up with 
them!  8-)
