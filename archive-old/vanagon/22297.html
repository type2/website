Subject: Thoughts on remote oil coolers?

Although Muir is agaijnst it, I have been thinking about added an ugly
remote oil cooler to my 73 Westy.  As far as I can tell the stook cooling
system is working as designed, but can't deal with temperatures above 80F
and extended freeway driving.

I would be like to know about other experiences with these coolers, and
suggestions for mounting them.
