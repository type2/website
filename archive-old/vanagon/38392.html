Ok folks, info/advice time.  Found the above parked next to a house ways
outa town.  Spotless (SPOTLESS!) inside, usual seam rust, never hit/painted,
has 100/200/300K? Kms on the clock, transporters only show 5 digits on odo.
One less than perfect prob, it's not a walkthrough, it's got the
single/double front section, full width partition, rear is 3 seater bench.
Seats 6 or 7 if you pack the backseat with 4. Never used as a work truck,
mostly highway mileage since new, one owner only. Bra and rear bed
factory(?) tarp, bed in great shape with one broken slat. Gates undented. A
rare find, made all the more so by the transmission.

Wierd part where I want advice... it's an autobox!!  Anyone with a 1.9l and
autobox got pointers for me?  Any vanagon pickup drivers with rust areas to
check beyond exterior/seams.  Underbed locker looked rustfree, as did wheel
wells.  This is one of those wierd 'iffy' deals, it was for sale last fall,
unknown to me, dammit.  It's now parked in the neighbours drive, who's going
to give him some money soon as he gets back from winter working in USA....
so I'm holding my breath on this. Guys been gone 4 months, due back this
months end. No keys/test drive, sigh. 

Wish me luck.  This should finish my SOs objections over buying another van,
she can't/won't drive a standard, sooooo..... ;&gt;.
