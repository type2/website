 I've always taken the little bit of extra trouble to set them in the
 1-4-3-2 order, turning the engine clockwise, since the idea of turning
 the engine counter-clockwise and thereby sending the oil in the oil pump
 and feed lines back to the sump doesn't appeal to me. I really don't 
 know if this is a legitimate worry, however. Any thoughts?

&gt; If you start at 1, and turn the crank counter-clockwise, you get
&gt; 1-2-3-4.

&gt; I think its real easy to remember.
