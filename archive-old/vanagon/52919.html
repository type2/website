If that cold air return line is for some sort of internal cooling you could
have problems. I'll bet they put that there for a reason.
Just a thought.

&gt;I used some tape to close off my inlet and noticed
&gt;no difference in the output of the furnace, nor any difference in the
&gt;sound the furnace was making. 
&gt;
&gt;My theory is that cold air backflows through the 
&gt;rear heater and squirrelcage fan; plenty of air
&gt;is available to be heated by the furnace without supplying a new inlet
&gt;vent.
