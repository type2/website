Ron,
I wouldn't have a problem giving $3-5 for you to get equiped for the list.
You might want to ask for at least $5 since many may not do it.  Then
change the SUBSCRIBE reply  message to suggest that donations for
maintenance are encouraged.  Any lawyers, et al, out there that can shed
some light on the legality of or tax issues regarding collecting donations
for maintenance?

Karl

PS - I'd be willing to send some homebrew out that way, too.
