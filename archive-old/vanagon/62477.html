Karl -

I just purchased a genuine Bosch O2 sensor for $29.  It came with a 
half installed splice connector and shrink wrap.  The expensive one 
has the proper length wire and connector on the end.  Save a hundred 
bucks and buy the DIY one.  It even had anti-sieze on the threads!

Pull your O2 sensor (22mm or 1&quot; wrench) and some Liquid Wrench or 
Kroil).  Cut the wire from the existing O2 sensor, strip, place 
shrink wrap onto wire, install into connector on new, crimp, place 
shrinkwrap, shrink using match or lighter, re-install.

If you have the three wire one, same thing, but times three.  Follow 
directions for which wire is which.  If in doubt. ask the list.  
I have a single wire model, so can't help.

Dropped by NAPA and they said $138.  Said I could also use a general 
purpose one if I wanted to do some wiring.  Uh...I donthinkso.
