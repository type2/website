I'll be there at the Toy Show Saturday.
I'll be there at the Navigational Rally too, Saturday night.
I'll be at the Calssic on Sunday too.

Re: SOTO meet:
&gt; The Long Beach Vets Stadium is indeed in Long Beach. You get off the 405 at
&gt; Lakewood Blvd and go inland, just opposite from Circle Motors where several
of
&gt; the past regular meets have been.

Won't be there.  Us Vanagon types &quot;need not apply&quot;.
