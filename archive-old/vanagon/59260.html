Subject: RE: 90 Westfalia handling 

Dave,

I have never owned a '90, so this is just opinion.

It seems that a 30 psi front / 40 psi rear is a very high (25%) bias towards the rear.  I am 
thinking that running 30 psi on the fronts is a little low and may be affecting handling.  
You might want to consider increasing it a little.

CAUTION -- running too high a pressure in the fronts will result in an oversteer condition 
and your bus may tend to spin.  Moderate understeer is always safer.

Michael

&gt;I don't have the tires in front of me, but I think they are 205-70R14 (they
&gt;are the stock wide tires that VW put on the vans).
&gt;
&gt;30-40 is the pressure balance VW recommends for the 205's.    Max inflation
&gt;for the MXLs is 40 lbs, I believe.
