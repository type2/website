As others have noted, alarms don't get too much attention these days.  I
figured that if *I* were raiding someone's vehicle or house, an
ear-splitting siren real close to me might deter me; so while there are
sirens outside my cars &amp; house, I've also put sirens *inside* to try to
drive the perpetrator crazy...awful hard to concentrate when you can't hear
anything except 120db noise only a few feet from your ear.
