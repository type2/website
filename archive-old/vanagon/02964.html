&gt;The transmission on my trusty '67 has began leaking oil from the front.
&gt;It''s not so bad for local driving, but it spews horribly on the
&gt;highway. I am fairly certain it is coming from the front, where the
&gt;shifter comes out. If anyone knows what sort of gasket or bushing this

There is a seal where the shift rod goes into the nosecode.  Those are 
prone to leaking.  However, this will necessitate the removal of the
tranny to fix :(  The nosecone itself is easy to remove, once you have the
tranny out...

Also make sure that all of the bolts holding the nosecone on are snug.

Also make sure the oil level is proper - not empty (since you're leaking) 
and not too full, since that will put extra pressure on the seal (or
what's left of it...)

BTW - these transaxles are not impossible to find:  take a bug transaxle
(swing) and have the R&amp;P flipped to the other side.
