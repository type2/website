I paid $452 for mine at a local surplus store.  Just called and they have
no more.  I was hoping to find the net enclosure for the awning. :-(  I
think that the $452 was cheaper than the awning/screen room combo from
Winnebago.

I should mention that the tent can't be used next to the van if you have to
stay at a site with those posts next to the paved pad, which we seem to
find alot of...

For the question on the exhaust getting in the tent.  The chute has a strap
around it so you can pull it tight from the top of the open hatch around
the bottom of the bumper.  The nylon chute rolls up nice prior to driving
away and you can close the rear door of the tent.

&gt; &gt;     It's too late!  I just got off the phone with Johnson's customer
&gt; &gt;     service.  They have had the Eureka AVT in their catalog since
&gt; &gt;    1989; until this January.  All the speciality tents have been
&gt; &gt;     discontinued, including the AVT -   poor sales.  They also
&gt; &gt;     couldn't hazard a guess as to whether any of their vendors
&gt; &gt;     have any in stock (probably not, was the answer)....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;  BTW, I think she said that the tent sold for about $250!
&gt;
&gt;      Blaine, it's been dropped from Campmor's summer '97
&gt;  catalog.  The late spring issue listed &quot;very limited quantities!
&gt;  while they last!&quot; for only  $460.00, US, which might explain why it
&gt; wasn't such a hot seller.
&gt;
&gt;      Campmor's customer service and product information
&gt;  line is 1-800-525-4784, hours- 0900-1700 eastern time.
