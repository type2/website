give dealer &gt;$C120 -no frig'en way;

  I can get the Security code if I have the Bar code # from the side of the
radio.

  I know how this is done, there is a Cross reference of some kind that the
dealer does to get this #.

  I don't know why the dealer would charge a person for the code, as long as
the person wasn't coming in All the time with different radios getting codes!

   Anyone that needs this problem solved can e-mail me at;  vwmaster_at_
volks-motorsports_dot_com   then I'll help you out.
