Subject: Re: RESULTS - Tire Survey

&gt; Another question - I know that 'SR' means 'sport radial' and that 'R' simply
&gt; means 'radial'. I also believe that the 'P' before the id means 'passenger'
&gt; I do not know the meanings of 'VR', 'HR', and 'TR'. I'd rather not guess.
Actually, in SR, the S is a speed rating, where S, T, H, V, Z, etc 
list increasing max speed rating for car tires. All else being equal, 
the higher speed rating usually means stiffer sidewall (=less heat 
buildup) which would be desirable on a Vanagon if LT tires cannot be 
found. Based on my experience with performance tires, I wouldn't go 
any less than HR if you must go passenger tires, and make sure the 
load rating is adequate, ie ~1300lbs+ at max psi.
 
&gt; None of the tires state that they are reinforced. And, are the 'Orig Eq' tires
&gt; actually tires that meet specs for being shipped on vehicles from manufacturers
&gt; My local tire man has told me that &quot;original factory tires ALWAYS wear better
&gt; and longer than ANY replacement tires.&quot; Is he correct? If so, shouldn't I
&gt; go for that choice?
Not true. My current Michelins on my Jetta are guaranteed for 140,000 
km - the stock ones were lucky to last 80k.
 
&gt; Any correlation between survey data and the tires listed above would be 
&gt; helpful! Any input on what any of YOU would choose for quality and longevity
&gt; would be helpful.
Generally speaking, higher speed ratings mean faster wearing tires, 
but this is not always true. Compare treadwear numbers within 
comparable tires of same speed rating. Higher = longer lasting.
(my michelins are 440)
