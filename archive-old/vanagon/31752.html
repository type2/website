&gt; I heard a rumor that the German VW dealers are replacing their
&gt; microfiche readers with PC's and CD rom's...
&gt; Brian.

	I went into my FLVWD (Friendly Local VW Dealer) a number of months
back so I could get laughed at in person when I asked for some Type III
suspension parts.  Anyway, in his (fruitless) search for my parts, one of
the places the counter dood looked was on a PC... he popped up a blow-up
of the Type III front end on the screen to i.d. the part. 

	&quot;Do you guys have that on CD-ROM?&quot;

	&quot;Uhhh, it's just on the computer.&quot;

Thanks buddy.  So, anyway, my local dealer has at very least *some*
stuff in *some* format.  Wow, sure would like to have a copy.  Wonder 
what all they have...
