     Seems the A/C equipped units have a two speed fan - quite a shock the 
     first time you hear it on high, eh?
     
     Personally, I would go ahead and add some water and just watch it 
     closely - chances are the dealer wasn't thorough, but it could have 
     just blown off in an overheat.
