to
&gt; stop.
&gt; I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier

network

&gt; I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt; purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt; cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a
T1.
&gt; If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt; host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.


As a couple people pointed out in the past, I owe a great debt to the
Vanagon list and its members.  Had it not been for the support of Gerry and
the members of the List, I might not have been able to realize my dream and
start my Bus/Vanagon parts business.  (Not to mention the many times that
the collective wisdom of the List and the Archives have helped me keep my
own Vanagon on the road!)

Since the Vanagon list has given so much to me, both personally and
financially (by way of list members who became customers), it only seems
fair that I should be willing to give back to the List.  To this end, I'll
offer to make up any shortfall toward the $1500 cost of keeping the list
going, up to a maximum of $500.00 (the most that I can afford right now).  

Let me quickly add that I am NOT attempting to &quot;buy&quot; the list.  I do NOT
expect any special priveleges in return, such as the right to advertise on
the list.  I do NOT have any &quot;hidden agenda&quot; of turning this list into a
Bus Depot list.  I do not want advertise on the list any more than I
presently do (posting periodic special buys or responding to queries).  I
merely hope it to remain exactly as it is, and if my financial support can
help make that possible, then I think it's the least I can do considering
that you all have supported me.  I'm getting more out of the list than
many, so it only seems fair that I should put more in.  Once again, let me
reiterate:  No strings attached, whatsoever.

Of course, if someone steps forward who has access to the neccessary
equipment for less than the $1500 (or free??), then of course I'd be happy
to save money, as I'm sure we all would.  But if buying this equipment is
going to be what it takes to keep our Vanagon list going, then count me in
for as much as I can afford. If there were more hours in the day, and I
knew the least bit about computers, I'd very happliy volunteer to run the
list myself, but as it is, the only useful support I can offer is
financial.  So Ron, if it's okay with you, just let me know how much you
need when the deadline approaches.

I'd like to add a special thanks to Gerry for everything he's done for us
Vanagoners over the last few years.  My hobby, and yes, my life, has been
enriched and enlivened by the existence of this list.
