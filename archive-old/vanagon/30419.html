This strikes me as the best solution.  Why?  Because people come and
go on the list, both those willing to help, and (more often) those
needing help.

That said, I'm in northern Colorado (half an hour from Jack Reed) and
willing to help with whatever.  Of course, my judgement in what's
worth trying to fix is pretty suspect....
