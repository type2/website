Subject: Re: Starter Solonoid Blues

&gt;&gt; A nagging problem I have had with my 81 Westy through several engine
&gt;&gt; replacements (see 81 Westfalia Blues, posting) has been the sticking
&gt;&gt; starter solonoid.  On long trips, the transfer of heat from the engine to
&gt;&gt; the starter housing seems to overheat the solonoid, causing it to fail to
&gt;&gt; engage.  The cure is to crawl under with a tire iron and rap on the case,
&gt;&gt; then cross the hot leads to force a revolution.  Then my baby usually
&gt;&gt; engages and starts.  Anyone else had this problem, and found a cure?  Also,
&gt;&gt; if you know of a good retrofit air conditioning compressor fit, I would be
&gt;&gt; grateful!  Last rebuild my boat anchor disappeared.
&gt;
&gt;I had this problem for years in my '79 bus as well.  What I eventually did was
&gt;have an aftermarket Ford solenoid put on IN ADDITION to the VW one that is
&gt;in there.  The advantage is that the Ford solenoid can be attached far 
&gt;enough from the enging area that the transfer of heat is avoided while the
&gt;VW is attached to the starter and so is limited to being next to the engine.
&gt;It has worked great so far, but I've only had it on there for 2 months or
&gt;so, so you might get a second opinion from some of the other list members.

Yep, I've had the same problem with my '79 bus several times, usually after
driving 100 or more miles on a hot summer day.  I'm gonna try this Ford
solenoid trick, too.  I beleive there's a description and drawing of it in
earlier printings of Muir's Idiot Book.  Jack Reed, on 8-30-95, left a
detailed posting about the Ford solenoid fix on the Vanagon list.  I can
repost it if someone needs it.
