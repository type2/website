Subject: re:  gasoline politics


&gt;did you hear congress passed a bill to allow oil drilling in a nat'l 
wildlife
&gt;refuge in Alaska  &quot;to make money to reduce the deficit&quot;  ha.  and i have a
&gt;bridge to sell you.  Goodbye caribou ( the drilling site is at the 
caribou's
&gt;breeding site,   to which they migrate every year)

Caribou are indigenous to all of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and I
believe most of northern Russia. ALL of these caribou go to this one
location in Alaska to make whoopee? I think not. (Oh, how cruel,
heartless, etc.)


&gt;funny enough, the Alaska senator is now saying they don't want to share the
&gt;oil taxes 50 50 with the feds, but 90 10.

...and they then return a lot of it to the citizens of Alaska. Kudos!


&gt;so for those who say, well you drive, don't bitch,  I say,  you can't 
really
&gt;believe that these companies are acting in anyone's interest but their own
&gt;pockets.

Why, that's horrifying!!! How DARE they look out for themselves??? They
should GLADLY accept decisions that go against business interests, and set
them at a disadvantage to other companies who are trying to compete them
right into the ground!


&gt;What wrong with holding them to standards that are in the public's
&gt;interest?

See above. Do you think oil companies going out of business, are in &quot;the
public's interest&quot;? I can't believe people still fall for this tunnel-
vision-oriented poppycock.


&gt;Caribou are important too.

I'll support my family before I support caribou... and, right now, I can't
do both. Maybe I could if half my income wasn't going for income taxes, 
sales
taxes, etc. etc. Sorry, caribou-- that's what you get for being the wrong
species in a world of Human Chauvinist Sapiens.


&gt;They don't drive cars.

Too much time resting after long treks for making whoopee.   :^)

&lt;now taking this offline, while changing into asbestos underwear yet again&gt;
