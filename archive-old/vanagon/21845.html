Subject: Re: New Starter Cost with Install

That's about what I paid. If you have time and space you can install it 
yourself and save money, though the place I was living when I needed the 
starter replaced and where I am now are not friendly to folks working on 
their cars. 

The mechanic explained that a previous owner had hooked up a wire from 
the battery to the starter to give it a little extra juice, but the gauge 
was too small to do what they wanted it to do. He tossed in a few other 
minor fixes that made biting the bullet and parting with that much cash 
worthwhile for me, he caught things that would have eluded me, such as a 
decayed battery ground strap...

&gt; This didn't sound too high to me but I just though I would ask.  I

&gt; Let me know what you all think...
