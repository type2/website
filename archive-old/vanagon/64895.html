&gt;did we really have to unbolt and remove that passenger seat?  It seemed the
&gt; only way to get full access to the well

on the left side of the passenger seat, there should be a small spring
loaded &quot;hook&quot; that prevents the passenger seat from sliding all the way
off of the seat rails.  to remove the seat, twist the catch and the seat
will be free to come off of the rails.

if anyone can explain this procedure more clearly, please do, as i have
not taken the passenger seat out in a while. thanks..
