Matthew Drahzal states about wonderful diesels:
&gt; 
&gt; Other than oil-changes, this is a zero maintenance engine. 
&gt; 

If you want your diesel live a long life, it's not a zero maintenence
engine.  You need to check the valve clearances every 15K (at least).

This is a pretty simple job, but you need a micrometer in order to measure
the shims and make sure that you're putting in the correctly-sized 
replacement.

And, it just happens that I have some tools that help with this job.

Injection pump lock &quot;bolt&quot;
Cam lock
ice-pick-like tool to grab the shims 
spare shims
set of new Bosch glow plugs (I'll check the number, it think they're slow)

These were used to service previously owned diesel Jetta and Rabbit.  I
don't know if I'll ever own another VW diesel again (maybe the ecodiesel
golf when it comes out), so I might as well let these tools do their job
on someone else's engine.  I think the vanagon uses the same engine as the
rabbit/golf/jetta?

Anyway, the above parts are available at a nominal price ($5 or $10 to cover
shipping).

If anyone wants them...
