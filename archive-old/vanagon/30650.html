Subject: Re: additional fuel tanks ...


&gt; said they had made up some &quot;saddle&quot; tanks for a vanagon (remember the one
&gt; Brad saw??), one on each side of the &quot;frame&quot;. one filled via the &quot;normal&quot;
&gt; filler and the other one filled via a wheelwell filler.

Didn't Chevy try that w/their pickups a few years back?  Seems to me they 
had a few problems.....    ;-)
