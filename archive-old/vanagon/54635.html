Subject: Re: Vanagon Eng Wire Harness needed

Wow, $836???

Don't have one, but just wondered ...  If all of your connectors are
physically in good shape, couldn't you just buy appropriate wire with
appropriate insulation and make a new one?  Seems to me, this would be a
very cost effective solution.
