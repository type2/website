Subject: Collection of Bus Names (Was: '57 Names...)


&gt;I have now christened the bus, &quot;The Pioneer.&quot;  The name seems to fit
&gt;it as it resembles a covered wagon, is about as noisy, and goes
&gt;almost as fast as one.  Also living in Utah seems to fit it as well.
&gt;Maybe Joel will put together a list of bus names!


My '71 will be &quot;La Volksie Vitae&quot;... if I can ever get it to act like
an automobile rather than a four-cyl toaster oven on wheels.
