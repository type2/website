Subject: Covercraft Vanagon  Mask......help!

 If there's a Vanagon owner out there with a Covercraft or whoever Bra on
 their later model vanagon with the big plastic bumpers with the matching
 door  trim.....one question:
 How   didja get the lower hooker thingy  past the trim and the door
 rubber!?
 that's the only piece that won't  go. The space  between the door and the
 rubber is tiny! How'd you do it??????  I dont wanna chance taking off
 the door trim  because i  might break it,  and I cant afford to replace
 it!.
 HHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!
