So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; After searching unsuccessfully for a looonng time for a set of the
&gt; &quot;Y&quot; poles for the Westy Bigtop tent I own, I finally got up the
&gt; gumption to fabricate a set.  As it turns out, this was extremely
&gt; easy to do with some ready-made gazebo awning parts available
&gt; widely.

Dan,

Would it be possible for you to get some pics of your setup on a
web site?
