So Joel Walker says:
&gt; the funniest thing to all us locals is watching the germans eating
&gt; bar-b-cue with a knife and fork. :)  &lt;it takes a while for them to learn
&gt; how to do it &quot;properly&quot;&gt;

I suppose by that you mean that you're suppose to just bend over and
just bite it right off the spit and shake till you get a chunk of meat
to swallow.  ;)

&gt; actually, the site is located IN the town of Vance, AL. but Vance was very
&gt; much ignored by the state and county and Tuscaloosa and Birmingham governments
&gt; as they tripped all over each other trying to give more and more money and
&gt; credits to MB. in five years, the town of Vance will not exist. :( already
&gt; the property values around there have gone up over double in most cases and
&gt; much higher in others.

That sounds very much like what happened to Folsom when Intel moved here.
Instant mega-suburbia!  

&gt; &gt;first AAV off the line will be badged the Folsom.

Hmmmmm......  Coincidence?
