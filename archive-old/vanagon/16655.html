Subject: Re: Hesitation again

&gt;HEllo all:
&gt;
&gt;Weel, unfortunately, the hesitation at highway speeds  has started up again. 
&gt;I checked the plugs (They have a grey ash colored covering on all of 
&gt;them((Bosch Platinum))) and the rotor and cap are new as of 2,000 miles ago. 
&gt; How can I tell if my wiring harness is to blame?  Is there anyway to 
&gt;distingush the new from the old?  The person I bought the bus from cannot 
&gt;remember if he changed the harness or not(no records either). Any ideas as 

You don't change the harness. You add a harness. 

After you have done this try changing the O2 sensor. Last time I had this
problem it was this part that was bad.
