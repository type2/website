Jay mentioned:

&gt; I thought this story might be worth sharing, so maybe a jumpstart can
&gt; fix your problem before you start mucking about with adding and
&gt; replacing
&gt; solenoids...

What the heck *is* the final word on jump starting AFC busses?  The
manuals always say &quot;don't EVER jumpstart&quot; (I imagine positive or
negative spikes from the donor-car might fry your ECU) but on the other
hand, I've always gotten away with it. (Those VW automatics *do* have at
least one drawback...).

What's the collective wisdom - has anybody ever fried their brain doing
this?
