Take another look at #5 up there...  Unless you're funded as well as the 
U.S. military,  Just buying new tires for this &quot;THING&quot; not jeep &quot;on 
steroids&quot; is going to be a little rediculous.  You might be a little 
happier with the Land Rover  Defender.  It's the same sort of vehicle,  
It is better looking IMHO,  and it's a better price all around.  Besides, 
you can fit it into a normal sized parking space and it has externally 
corrugated body panels much like the vehicle of which it is a take off. :)

Cheers
I'll stick with an 85 Vanagon or a 911 depending on whether or not I get 
any roadie work prospects in the next few months.
