&gt;Eeeeek! What are all those &quot;=20&quot;s in your message?
&gt;
&gt;About the Syncro &amp; driveshaft:  I think that not having the driveshaft in
&gt;might slightly (very silghtly) increase the wear on the Syncro's viscous
&gt;coupling.  In normal operation both sides of the coupling are rotated at the
&gt;same speed, the back side from the transmission &amp; the front side by the
front
&gt;wheels.  By not having the driveshaft installed, the viscous coupling would
&gt;need to keep the coupling's input shaft rotating and this might add a
&gt;slightly greater strain on the coupling.  I think the only fuel milage
gained
&gt;would be by not carrying the weight of the driveshaft - probably about .001
&gt;mpg.

Jim,
This is not true.  There is almoost no, load on the front diff input shaft.
 During normal operation, the front and rear never spin at the same speed in
real life.  That is why the coupling is needed. Even minor road variations
and tire wear make a difference that has to be constantly taken by the
viscous coupling.  Removing the shaft will eliminate excessive wear on both
front and rear diffentials.
Dennis.
