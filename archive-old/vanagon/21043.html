&gt; Yes - In the early 80's I bought a water injection kit from Edelbrock.  It had
&gt; a control box that looked a vacum and rpm (via coil primary) and from that
&gt; used some sort of algorythm to determine when and how much water to spray. 
&gt; The water mist cools the incoming charge and effective &quot;raises&quot; the octane of
&gt; the mixture to reduce or delay ping.  It also  cleans carbon deposits pretty
&gt; effectively.   Since it contributed to reducing pre-ignition, you could
&gt; advance the timing to get better power and economy. 

I feel I have to jump in here.  Water injection dilutes the fuel mixture
going into the cylinders, thereby reducing the power output of the
engine.  You will not gain any more power or economy by adding water
injection and advancing the timing.  Nobody I know uses water injection.
The main reason to add it is if you have a very high compression engine
where preignition cannot be controlled by other means.  one use for it
would be if you milled your heads down too far and can't afford a new
set.  As we know, high compression and air cooled engines don't go
together, and I can't see any reason for adding water injection to one.
My two cents...
