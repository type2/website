Subject: mystery brains

In all the stuff I purchased last year at the VW dealer auction I have
discovered that I have two mystery computer brains. These typically cost
about $700 each. I looked in what microfiche I have and none of these part
numbers are listed as meaning anything. This is a real long shot, but
anybody with a more up to date microfiche know what these are?

2 each Bosch computer brains VW part number 037 906 258 (Bosch part number 0
261 200 497).

2 each air flow VW part number 037 906 461.

2 each valves 048 133 455 (VDO part number 408.202/013/002)

If I find out that these are for, say, a Corrodo or 6-cyl. VW or some
current model, I guess I will sell 'em off cheap with a warranty.
