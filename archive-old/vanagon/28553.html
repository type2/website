So Joel Walker tripped over a possum and regurgitated:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Yes, but at what cost?!!  Now let's compare the price of a 1950's car (by
&gt; &gt;todays
&gt; 
&gt; ok. a today-car costs about the same as a year's wages.
&gt; 
&gt; gee ... in the 1950's, a car cost about a 1950's year's wages.
&gt; 
&gt; funny thing about that. :)

Yes, well those of us think in real time and not on AMD time... ;p well, ahem,
realize that the above quote taken out of text doesn't mean much, but if
you included the lines that spoke of 'improvements' (tongue in cheek) 
of which most are debatable.  Especially the ones that are for emission
control which we all know is mostly a form of consumer blackmail.  Especially
here in California where the fees are beyond ridiculus.  Then, the cost
for a new car is outrageous when the above stated 'improvements' start to
fail as was further stated by another poster.  Joel, being a vanagon owner
should understand this difference quite well considering the cost he's 
put into at least a couple of those beasties.
