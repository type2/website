Subject: Re: trans mount

Christain, I just went thru the same thing on my westy, I'd bet it's
your front mount, I had let off the throttle before pushing in the
clutch to upshift because of the bind. Finally the coupler broke, I got
the parts from &quot;the bus stop&quot; (RMM),The mount costs around five bucks,
no more bind on the shifter.
