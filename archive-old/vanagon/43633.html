Subject: In search of '86 Vanagon Air Cond. compressor. 

Hi.
I need to replace the AC compressor on my '86.  It is made by Sanden and is
a SD510.  Problem is the local VW dealer quoted me $603 (!!) and another
$150 (!) for the new reciever dryer!  This seems excessive - but none of the
local parts sources can get me this compressor from the aftermarket.  
I would be willing to modify the system if needed to fit a cheaper
compressor - can anyone suggest (1) a source for a cheaper OE compressor, or
(2) a cheaper alternate compressor that will fit the existing bracket.
Thanks in advance!
Cheers,   MIKE
