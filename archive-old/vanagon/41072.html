Subject: Gerry's Beer-A-Thon update

Volks,

First, many thanks to those who have contributed so far.  I have received
enough fundage to extend Gerry's subscription to the Beer of the Month club
another three months, for a total of six months.  And, as luck would have it,
they were having a special when I called to renew, which saved $12!  Now we
already have a good start towards the next three month subscription.  :)

For those who don't know what I'm talking about, I have organized a small
drive to pay for a subscription to a gourmet beer club for the list
administrator, in appreciation for all he has done for us in the last two
years (i.e. made the Vanagon mailing list possible!).  Details are
available at
http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/beer-a-thon

I have received 11 donations thus far.  I am not asking for donations right
now, since the subscription is paid up for 6 months, but those of you that
would like to show appreciation to the list admin for his hard work can send
me a donation at any time and it will be used to extend Gerry's subscription.

Thanks for listening...

-David
