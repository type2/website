&gt;The coolant level sensor is simply two probes that stick down into the

the level sensor can also be fooled by a &quot;concentration failure&quot; of the
coolant. :)  i.e., if the amount of water-to-coolant gets too far the
&quot;wrong&quot; way (i guess it would be too much water?), the LED will blink.
perhaps it's caused by old weak anti-freeze ... that's lost all its electrons
and can't pass the current. ;)

&gt;Now, if I can only figure out why the headlights go off and the radio
&gt;stays on when I shut off the ignition ...  :-)

and the parking light stay on. i think it has something to do with the laws
in germany, about parking on the side of the road. Mercedes has a light
switch that allows you to not only turn ON the parking lights, but to decide
if you want (1) Left side parking lights, (2) Right side parking lights, or
(3) BOTH side parking lights. :) so if you park on the left side of the road,
you have to turn on only the left side parking lights (to warn other folks
that you are there).

and the radio works without the ignition. :)
