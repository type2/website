Subject: Re: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling

Hi all-Im new to the list and thought it introduce my selfself&gt;
     My name is steve I own a 85 vanagon, with over 150,000 miles on it Ive
had this fine machine for just over 2 years and love the heck out of it. My
previous car was a Volvo '78 242 GT(sort of an oxymoron, if you are familiar
with 242's!) but before that Ive had a wild assortment of VWs-everything from
a handful of bugs, a clasic manx styled dune buggy(street legal), 2
scirrocco's,a Thing,and a rabbit.
      Im an avid mountain biker and use a Macintosh performa 5215CD( so any
mac users interested in exchanging software for &quot;review&quot;(wink wink) let me
know
       BTW, My Vanagon tales about 15 minutes to warm up enuf for heat to
come out-Is this normal?
