&gt; Why isn't it a good idea to cover a vehicle ??
&gt; 
&gt; Is this like a &quot;Knock Knock&quot; joke ?

    NO time to write, but covers are water proof. Most cars rust
    because of water or humitity in the air. It gets under the
    cover and cann't get out. NO Joke!  The best thing you can
    use is an omni bag. Yes a bag for the hole car. If you do 
    cover your van, park it in a dry lot, (no over dirt)
    area, and some how vent the cover!
