Subject: Temporary au revoir

Went to the computer today to load the file for the April issue of the SSVC
magazine...file not found...panic , then remembered I hadn't started the issue
(typing wise)..and I have just about 10 days to turn it round...aaagh!
I have to cut something temporarily so have to unsubscribe till the mag goes
to bed...
Please contact me or SSVC direct so I can do something when I get blisters on
my fingers...helter skelter..stay in touch ..speak soon? Dave :(
