Subject:  AllData CD-ROM Shop Manual Campaign

	As some of you know, I work for a company called AllData,
which sells shop manuals on CDROM.  The manuals have all the parts
listing, diagrams, shop times, repair procedures, diagnostic procedures,
etc.  The price is $25 for a particular year make and model 
(ie '91 Vanagon GL)  There is a Windows and DOS version (no Mac yet...)

Does AllData have a CD for the 93 Eurovan models?

Inquiring minds want to know. Thanx,

Jeff
