Subject:      EV/Vanagon Poptop Raincover(?)

I have a 1997 Eurovan Camper and I live in the soggy PNW.  I was thinking=

about attaching velcro pads between the inside lip of the poptop and the
canvas tent.  From this I was thinking about attaching anything from a cu=
t
and fitted shower curtain to an insullated/waterproof  curtain of some
sort.  The free end of the curtain would then be bunggied to the window
from, mirrors, or the base of the van to keep the curtain fairly tight.  =
I
would probably need to prop the roof up so it doesn't get pulled down.

Anyways,  this is what I was thinking about to better cope with camping i=
n
the rain and snow of the winter months.  Does anyone else have any =

suggestions, or is their something on the market already?

Thanks,
