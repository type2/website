Subject: Re: Mystery wire on '73 ignition switch

To the best of my knowledge this wire is used in European cars for a 
park light or something.  I may be wrong but thats what I've been lead 
to belive every time I install an ignition switch that wire has been cut 
off at the base.  I haven't found any problems in doing this and have 
installed quite a few switches in my time.
