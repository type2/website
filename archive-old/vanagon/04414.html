Subject: '72 engine wanted, other questions


I was going to buy a rebuilt 1700 for $500, but was beaten to it and
now need an engine. My Westy currently has a 1700 at 170K miles and
needs either 1 new head or valve work. My intention was to buy the
rebuilt engine, put it in, then use the original engine to learn how
to rebuild them myself - this way I would have a running bus while
taking my time on the rebuild, and would redo the interior probably
before even finishing the engine.

I still wish to find another engine to put in there, but I expect that
I have to pay much more than $500 now.:( Does anyone have a good lead
for me on this quest? Would it be cheap enough to buy the crankcase
and other parts seperately and put it together myself?

Also, the speedometer is off by almost 10 miles/hour - the speedometer
said 68-70 while I was really going 60. The tire size is
175/60R14. Any ideas?

Has anyone here completely redesigned the interior of their camper?
Such as take out all the original seats/cupboards and built their
own. A nice example that I am thinking of is in _VW BUS Custom
Handbook_ by Laurence Meredith, page107, upper left. If someone has
done this, I would like to trade some email concerning the procedure.

Is the ice box/sink worth much? I don't believe that I will need it
and would like to get a couple bucks for it.

Oh yeah, almost forgot...along with my getting a Westy in good
condition for $500, for an extra $20 I got an EMPI oil cooler still in
its' package. Where is the recommended position to put this? I see
that the FAQ is missing information about these items.

Thanks,
 jeff
