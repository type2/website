&gt; 
&gt;    EV'ers:
&gt; 
&gt;         Has any of you found a source for side window screens for NON-
&gt; camper EV's?  VW doesn't have them, but I seem to recall a place out
&gt; in Oregon that made them. ANyone know anything about this?

	What would be different for non-campers?  Should be exactly the
same.


&gt;         BTW: How does Dan Hebert get 22.5 mpg on his much heavier camper
&gt; while we can never break 21 on our MV? Is it engine timing? Tires? Richness
&gt; of fuel/air mixture? Any thoughts?  We usually get 14-15  around town in the
&gt; winter, 16-17 in the summer. How does these figure square with all of you?

	Gee, my heavy camper (sorry girl, I don't think you're overweight)
gets 20-22 consistently.  And I think +/- 1 mpg reasonble accuracy.
