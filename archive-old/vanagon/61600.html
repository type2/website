Hi John,

This time of year things are getting pretty warm -- Today in Las Vegas
we're looking at a high of 107 degrees -- although it is cooling off to
about 100 by the weekend. 

What time of the season are your kids going through? Do you know their
intended route? The pass out of the valley to the west (190) is a pretty
good grade. They should be fine if they just take it easy.

The US Park Service has a site for Death Valley at:
