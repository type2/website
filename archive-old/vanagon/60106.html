&gt;Pretty cool!!!  Since it was melted, I just cut the metal connector off 
&gt;it, and grounded it somewhere else.

Wires melt when something is wrong, (Let's the smoke out, that's how I
generally know I have an electrical problem!&lt;g&gt;). You really need to find
why the wire melted and fix that. This could turn out to be a major problem
if the wires keep letting the smoke out.

Good Luck,
