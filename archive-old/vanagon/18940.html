Subject: Audi 5+5 Electrical Problem

My stock '81 Audi 5+5 (five cyl. with 5-speed trans in light 2-door coupe
body, 160 kilo-miles) seems to need a new fuse box.  Any thoughts?

Three circuits are troublesome: left low beam, fuel pump, and engine fan.  I
can make the headlight or fan work by reaching thru the fuse replacement
opening in the dashboard (while driving, if necessary) and firmly pressing on
the upper (hot) fuse holder thingie.  The fuel pump will quit sometimes, but
wiggling the 1-inch cube relay always gets it going again, so maybe that's a
different matter.

Rumor has it that this was a problem for dealers some years ago, and the
factory produced a &quot;D&quot; (?) fuse block to fix it.  Rumor continues that the
replacement block costs $150, so a kitchen-table rehab of my existing one
would be preferred.

If I can't get this fixed, I guess I'll have to part-out my engine and trans
to a brick-head. :)
