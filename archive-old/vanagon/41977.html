Subject: Re: Question: Polishing Glass

I know there are compounds that are sold specifically to remove scratches 
from glass, but in my ever-thrifty quest for solutions, I wonder if 
polishing or rubbing compound would lead to the same result. Any 
experiences, thoughts, rebuke? Thanks! Joe ('71 campmobile) - on digest.

i polished the windsheilds of the 67 camper im driving, when i polished the
dash (looks great!) .   when i wax the bus i'll wax the windows too, it'll
help the water bead off and reduce glare.
