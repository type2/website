This will burn out the connector at the bulb and your ignition switch. You
have to overcome these two problems ( w. relay, better connectors) before
running these bulbs.

&gt;&gt; i just substituted 60/100 bulbs for the stock 55/60's
&gt;&gt; on the low beam side of my 91 synchro....i doubt that
&gt;&gt; the headlight switch will last forever...
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else tried this?  Did the switch(es) survive?
&gt;100/55 bulbs are easy to obtain in the UK.  Do I *need* to fit
&gt;a relay or will the switch(es) take the extra current?
&gt;
&gt;The current through the switch is presently 10A (2 * 60/12), it
&gt;will increase to 17A (2 * 100/12).
