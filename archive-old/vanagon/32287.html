Subject: re. a snowy day

I've never made the transition from rear wheel to front wheel drive (really
hate not being able to steer with the throttle) but the our EV has been
great during the&quot;winter of discontent&quot; in New England. Even with the Contis
at 40 psi or thereabouts it's stable and damn near unstopable. If only it
didn't down shift at 2000 revs....(Ric's right. Don't buy the auto if you
have the choice).
