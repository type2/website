Subject: Re: One last EV/Vanagon/Caravan observat

&gt;Chrysler shitboxes (can we all
&gt;agree on the Chrysler shitbox designation?....after all they don't
&gt;even have a ladder frame like a VW) this weekend.

Seems to me that the publice has spoken on what is a shitbox and what isn't.
Just look at what sells. 

&gt;Grateful Dead stickers
&gt;do not look out of place on a EuroVan,

Even if I had a Eurovan (the true shitbox) I wouldn't put a Grateful Dead
sticker on it.....it would make the Eurovan look even worse.
