Subject: Tranny fluid change, how much??

I drained and filled the trans/diff in
my '82 diesel Westy last night.
My owners manual states a volume of
3.7 quarts.  I put 4 in and thought
the excess would flow out of the
side filler hole when I lowered the 
van off of the jacks.  Nothing came
out.  
How much should I put in????
Should I fill it until it runs out the side filler hole???

I am off the list temporarily due to restrictions
at work.  Please mail directly to me and not to
the list.
