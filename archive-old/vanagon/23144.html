Subject: Re: Propane

Maybe the more important question is: why waste the propane when you
have another source of power that is immediately available and does
not tax any other resources (while the engine is on)?  am I missing
something?

 &gt; Even in this ultra cautious litgious society, I've never seens anything 
 &gt; in any RV owners manual about not travelling with the LP gas on. In fact, 
 &gt; all of the major refrigerator manufacturers make 2-way propane/LP 
 &gt; refrigerators which must have the LP gas on to cool when travelling.
