Subject: Re: How  original is this type II ?

&gt; The bus was a `cargo'-bus, with no rear seats, a sliding door, and at
&gt; first glance no rust at all. I understand the sliding door option is
&gt; quite rare, but I'm not sure.

The sliding door, from all the literature I have read, was available as an 
option from '64 or '65 on. I have *never* seen one at all the shows and swap 
meets I've visited, so I would guess it's extremely rare, at least on this side 
of the pond.

&gt; The sliding door had 2 windows in them, just as the opposite panel (are
&gt; they a factory option ?) These windows looked good, but they seemed
&gt; different than the side windows I see in the magazines (on micro/deluxe
&gt; buses).

I have no idea if they came with windows.

&gt; The bumpers were blades, no overriders, and colored white.
&gt; The bus itself was two colors, a white/cyan(?) combination which looked
&gt; original.

I thought overriders for these years were only for the US market, nes pas? The 
white/cyan was indeed a factory color for this year, although I didn't think the
panels ever came in 2 tone paint jobs from the factory.

&gt; I didn't get a chance to see the inside of the bus, or the engine clearly,
&gt; because the doors were locked. But if everthing is as good as the outside 
&gt; looks,
&gt; it should be alright.
&gt; 
&gt; The price the owner was asking (Fl. 6500  about $ 3600) didn't sound
&gt; unreasonable, but I haven't talked to him yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone tell me, from the above description, what is original and
&gt; what not. And if the price he is asking is reasonable.
&gt; 

This is a tough one to put a price on, but I would say it's about right or a 
little high, at least for California. Regardless of the rarity, the panels never
will command the prices of a crew cab or a deluxe bus / Samba.

FWIW...,
