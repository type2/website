Subject: The new bus


My friend added another bus to the family of 7 last weekend.  It was a 
really clean 80 vanagon with gas heat.  The owner said the engine was 
shot because it had a dead cylinder.  Last saturday I tried to get it 
running, so he could store his westy for the winter.  Checked the spark 
first.  Good fat blue spark.  Removed the airbox and found lots of gas 
near #2 injector.  Removed that and checked its spray pattern. Cheched 
out OK.  Just on a whim, removed the valve cover. Immediately got soaked 
by the 4 extra quarts of liquid in the sump/cover (notice i did not say oil).
Also found nuts and washers.  Curious I pulled on the rocker shaft and it 
came off in my hand!  Fount all the hardware ane replaced it, runs like a 
top now.  Especially with the proper amount of oil, not twice the 
recommended amount of gasoline with a little oil in it!
