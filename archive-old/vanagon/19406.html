Subject: RE: baja trip - dates? 

nothing better to clear the mind and recharge the soul than a mex trip.
The farther down the better but for a quickie, two days in a little place
called El Pescador (The fisherman) is just fine. It's just a couple of miles
south of Rosarita (about 4 hours from OC) which is touristy enough and not as
scummy as Ensenada and a resort compared to TJ.

I'm not sure on the camping there but I know there are places around there
where you can camp. Lobster dinners are cheap ($8) what else could you want.

A lot further south is a place called Punta Conejo (Rabbit Point) it has
camping facilities (I think it was $3 a night) hot showers. A roaring right
point break. About a hard days drive away.

And of course at the tip of baja there is Cabo which is pretty cool and away
from it all. I've heard of people driving like hell and getting down there in a
24 hours. Images of Hunter S. We surfed this place called shipwrecks and there
was only this one other guy in a van camping/living there. Surfers will show up
during the day. Idyllic.

There are tons of spots in between these three I've mentioned. I have this book
(actually someone borrowed it but I think I'll get it back and make you some
copies) that charts out alot of spots down the coast with directions; Turn
right at the little red house... 
Baja on the pacific side is pretty dry and desert-like but it has the surf
I haven't really checked out the gulf side but I hear it's nice.
If you're really going for it you can take a ferry across from La Paz which is
just north or cabo ($35) and cross over to the mainland side which is the
closest thing to hawaii I have ever seen. Michiochan (sp?) Nothing to do all
day but to eat drink surf smoke. heaven.
