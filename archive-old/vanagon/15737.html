Subject: Re: pre 68' type II engine access hinges

maybe that hinge thing was common knowledge, but not to me! I thought i
would pass along my glee and discovering something that was interchangeable
between bubble windows and splits!

up here splits are very rare, but there are still bubble windows
around...........so all the hinges i can scam the better.

btw the &quot;back&quot; door is the rear hatch that i was referring to


the bottom line is that anytime i can find cheap exact replicas of split
window stuff i'm pleased

michael

p.s. have you eceived my package in the mail yet?

&gt;
&gt;Gee, I thought the hinge this was common knowledge!  I have a spare set -
&gt;one from my '56 and one from a '72+/-!  You can't tell 'em apart except
&gt;for the color!
&gt;
&gt;Now, the back door - which - the engine lid or hatch?  Engine lid is
&gt;a definite no.  Hatch maybe.
