&gt; I don't know what you are going to use for wood, but DON'T use laminate

&gt; stationary use, but the vibration and flexing of your van will cause glue 
&gt; joints to crumble and screws to work loose. The cabinets last a few months 
&gt; before they soften. I got this from a British used VW salesman who warned me 
&gt; against one particular companies conversions because of this. He wouldn't 
&gt; sell them. 

Thanks for the advice.  The old cabinets had 3/4&quot; particle board tops,
bottoms, and shelves.  They weighed a ton, and like you said they were
falling apart.  I have already cut a top for the cabinet out of 1/2&quot;
plywood, and I bought a 4x8 sheet of paneling that closely resembles the
original Safare-installed paneling for the sides and front.  I haven't
decided how to deal with doors and drawers yet.  I figure I will make the
frame from 1x2s.  I would have liked to put formica over the exposed
surfaces, like Dave Garth did with his heater installation, but the
sheets of formica were very expensive, and it looked like a lot of
trouble to install.  Anyone have comments on that?  Oh, and the only
colors of formica they had were various shades of white and some ugly
patterns.  I want either blue (to match the original) or a shade of grey,
I think.
