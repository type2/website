Subject: The Blue Paz


Well, here we go again. The Blue Paz pooped on died on the freeway this morning. It started blowing
heavy black smoke, hesitating, gaging, and all of a sudden, it died. It wouldn't start at all. I got in
the motor messed around with a few wires, fuel-filter, and tapped on the distributor....and then
it started right-up. After that it ran nicely! I was so excited that I found myself going 90mph....
The fun didn't last long b'cause when I got to work it died again. *&amp;*&amp;*(&amp;* it, I just came in to
release my frustration on my computer.

By the way, I have changed my CV joints at ~40K. Is that reasonable ? I talked to someone yesterday
who has a 1983 van and said he changed them at 120K; his van has 190K now with no major work done
to it, incredible! I am sure you will all agree that I can generalize on this, old VW's are definetely
better!!!!
