Subject: Most Expensive part for its size?

I needed to replace one of the socket head bolts that holds a coolant 
pipe to the head on my '84 vanagon. (someone messed it up, and I had to 
cut it off)  I had two choices, either order a box of 100 from McMaster 
for about $30, or buy one from the dealer.  After paying the dealer 
$3.50 for a single bolt, I think I should have ordered from McMaster and 
found other Vanagon owners that could use the other 99 bolts.  After 
paying $7.00 for a two inch long hose Monday, I'm glad these are the only 
parts I need from the dealer for this head replacment job!

(The cashier said &quot;What is this screw made of, gold?&quot; ... &quot;Oh, it must be 
something unusual, maybe metric or something&quot; ... &quot;Oh, a Vanagon.  One of 
those rare cars.&quot;)
