&gt;         It WAS too good to be true :(
&gt; 
&gt; Little cars are going back to Mexico due to govt. saftey standards, feds
&gt; did
&gt; the bust, a nurse at Thomas husband works for importation and she heard
&gt; you
&gt; and I talking about them and told her husband, there are 23 loose in the
&gt; US
&gt; and the feds mean to track 'um down and capture them, if we had bought
&gt; them
&gt; too bad.  But I loved the idea of a NEW Beetle.  The ones due here in 98
&gt; will
&gt; be water cooled front engines and not really the same at all.  I might buy
&gt; myself a restored one, now I've got the fever.  LaterSemi-New Beetles : it's my understanding that there is a place in 
seattle and vancouver BC that will build (repair) you a brand new bug on 
an old chassi (yours) for around $7000. maybe someone out there has more 
info on this. seattle  i heard somewhere, but vancouver i read in 
magazine archives at library, if anyone wants to research it.
