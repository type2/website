Subject:      FS EV alloys

i have a set of borbet type &quot;o&quot; alloys that came w/ the EV that i
bought...they are 16&quot; with pirelli p-7's in a 225/50 ( they really do
fit w/ no problems! ).  two of the tires are 70% left but the fronts
were never rotated.  the wheels are excellent.  looking to sell or
trade for 15&quot; alloys,  as i have new tires to fit the 15&quot; wheels

cheers
