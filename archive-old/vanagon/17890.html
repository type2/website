Subject: Did we lose another one?

Anybody catch the helicopter shots of the wayward tank in San Diego?  
It appears to me, on my tiny 13-inch set, that the vehicle that got
pancaked just prior to the motorhome was a vanagon.  It got pushed
a hundred yards or so before being stopped by the motorhome, otherwise
it might have got away.  David Schwarze?
