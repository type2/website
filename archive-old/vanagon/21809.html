Subject: Rocker Arm gaskets?

Well, I installed the heads on my 1600 DP and did the torque thing
as per St. Muir.  Reading over the procedure for installing the rocker
arms, Muir says to use gaskets provided for in the gasket kit.  I found
four &quot;O-Rings&quot; that fit over the studs, but when I disassembled the head
there were no gaskets between the studs and rocker arms.  Should there
have been?   The engine ran fine (~15000 since rebuild).  Should I put 
gaskets on?
