&gt;After cruising the turnpike at 65-70 for over 1 hour when I  slow down on

In a sick way, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one on the list with this
problem. I have heard from several Vanagon owners I've met in my travels
that they've had this problem, too. One dealer tried to tell a customer
that the oil pressure buzzer was a shift indicator!

Since the day (well, maybe after the first month) I bought my 91' Camper,
I've had that annoying problem: lots of buzzing after a long highway run,
disappears when rpms are above about 2200, worse with 10w40 than 20w50 and
in warmer weather, etc.  I've been back to the dealer (my ex-dealer) three or
four times for diagnosis, then new parts, etc. They replaced the circuit
board up under the instrument panel, replaced my Fram oil filter with a VW
one (no I don't use Fram anymore!), and futzed around with this and that and
still no progress. I finally gave up and have learned to live with it over
the 52k miles I've got on the Camper now. One of these days, I guess I'll
break out the Bentley book again and go through the diagnosis steps, some-
thing I suspect the dealer never once did. It will be due for 60k service in
a few months so that's probably a good time to give my new dealer a crack at
it. How much you wanna bet it's just a bad sensor? :-( Oh yeah, both the
first dealer and the mechanic we use for our other cars checked out the oil
pressure and said it's just fine.

Anyway, if you find the problem, Kerry, please let me know. I have yet to
find someone who has gotten to the bottom of the problem and fixed it. Isn't
the &quot;dynamic oil pressure system (tm)&quot; just wonderful?  By the way, I've read
Joel's comments about installing an oil pressure gauge, i.e., that the two
terminal sending unit won't fit between the manifold ports, but is there
anyone who *has* successfully installed a sending unit there and if so, what
exactly did you install?
