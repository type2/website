Subject: Audi Turbo Rims - My Story


Hello all,

I guess you read my 'AUDI Turbo Rims - Warning' and you
ask yourself, how I could send this information.

It starts while dismantling an AUDI 200 for the engine
to put it into a Vanagon. I recognised that the bolt
patterns of the nice looking rims will fit the van. The
rims have a wrong offset, but this can be corrected by
using 10 mm spacers. On German rights I will need a
approval for using.

On February, 24th I sent my first letter to VW Wolfsburg
for a certificate that the AUDI rims will fit the Vanagon.
In fact, VW and AUDI are the same company. I got the
first answer: AUDI got an independent company in 1993.
I should ask over there.

On March, 3rd I sent my first letter to AUDI Ingolstadt.
I got a short phone call: The rims doesn't fit. No more
detailed information.

I know, the rims do fit and I called AUDI again, different
person. I got a better information: AUDI was an subsidiary
company of VW in 1982 when the rims were built. All
development files are over there, I may call VW.

So I did, but different person as my first time. That I
he answered me: Right, AUDI was a subsidiary of VW in 1982,
but all development information were sent to AUDI when
it got an independent company.

Back to AUDI. I found a very helpful person. He wants to
try to get the technical file from the development department.
This will need some time. After two week I called him again,
he was in holidays, I should wait some more days and call
again. I did, but he had bad news, no technical documentation
were found on this rims. The approval of this rims were made
in once with the car. I should send him a copy of the car
license papers to find the right approval certificate. I
happy to have the wreck still in my garage and the papers
on hand. It sent them.

Finally, on April, 17th, I received an official letter from
AUDI stated, that the rim is approved to carry 520 kg each
and that this letter is intend to be used for an official
approval.

Any comments?

PS: For everyone, who needs this letter for an approval on
this rims should send me an e-mail. I'm happy to send a copy
of it if the recipient will pay the postage.
