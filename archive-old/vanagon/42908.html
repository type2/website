Subject: Strange oil drain plug -- '77 Westy

Today I planned to do my first oil change on Frink, my recently
acquired '77 Westy friend.  I got everything together, went for a
short drive to warm things up, and then climbed underneath.  I was
surprised to see that the oil drain plug did not have a normal bolt
head, but instead was round and had a Torx-like fitting.  My 6mm hex
key fit and was sloppy, but my 1/4in hex key would not fit.  The
largest Torx key that I have is a T-40.  It fit and was sloppy.  When
I pushed it in all the way it fit solidly, but I think that it is just
reaching the end of the flutes of the Torx key.

What kind of tool do I need for this?

P.S.  The PO had all his oil changes done at the VW dealer.
