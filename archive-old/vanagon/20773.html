Subject: 88 Westy-Third Seat Option?

Just wondering if the later model westy's had a third seat option.  There
is one for sale near where I live and it is basically a 4 passenger.  Does
anyone konw if another bench seat can be installed or was it ever an option
in this model/year.

Also I've been lurking in this mail group for the past few monthes and I'm
very impressed and thankful for all the information shared here.

Thanks

Tim Marciniak
