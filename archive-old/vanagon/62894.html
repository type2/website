Subject: Solar Panels

I forget whose www page it was on (picture) but they neglected to
explain why they had four solar panels mounted across the top of their
pop-up top.  Could someone please explain?  I'm a wanna be gadget freak
(I'm sure I'm the only one on this list,...NOT) and thus this
information would fill another hole in my metaphysical framework.

Don't own one yet but will be shopping in the near future
