Subject: valves getting looser:  how much is too much?

Hi vanagonites, I have a general question for y'all.
I did a valve adjustment yesterday, and in the past 1,000 miles
or so my valves went from .006 to .008-.009 each.  Is this just
what I should expect?  It was a very cold winter and I drive
mostly short distances, so the uneven expansion of engine parts
must have been pretty severe.  Oh, it's a '62 bus with 1600dp engine.

Thanks in advance. . . . .
