The big question becomes one of organization:  how should things be
laid out so as to be most useful?  Doing it by person needing stuff
seems like the least practical.  Doing it by year makes some sense,
although there are lots of things that aren't really year-specific.
Hmm.

Send me want-lists, and suggestions on organization, and I'll put
something up either tonight or tomorrow night.
