Subject: Re: Heat Exchanger repair

Don't know of any kit, but it sounds like a great idea to me. Especially 
if it came in stainless steel. However, you can definitely take the boxes 
to a welding shop and have them plug the holes; a similar job cost me 
$45, but those boxes were in really bad shape, too.

Brake drum: stick a long screwdriver from the back into one of those
inspection holes and place the tip against the drum (from the inside, am I
being clear?). Then bang the head of the screwdriver with a hammer while
turning the wheel. Try no to lie under the bus while you do this, etc.

Frozen adjuster: soack it in penetrating oil, then find a long bolt (M8, 
M10?) that can be screwed into the top of the adjuster. Wrench that puppy 
in all the way until it hits the bottom and pushes the adjuster out.

Have fun! :)
