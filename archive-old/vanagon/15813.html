Subject: Cargo Hatch locks for 70 single cab

	Thom,
	Thanks for the offer, friend. My pickup has keyed locks
that look similar outside to the lockable engine cover lock/latch
units, but are very different inside. The splitie single-cabs I've
seen have a church-key-like mechanism, taking the same tapered
square section key as the engine cover of older splities.
	I'm pretty sure the mechanisms inside are different, since
the units I have are operated by pushing in with the thumb, after
unlocking, and the older units operate by turning.

	If I can't turnup a replacement for what I've got, I'll
probably improvise something using an engine cover latch, since they
are cheap and plentiful.

	Cheers!
	Bill
