&gt; &gt;Does anyone have or know where we might find a cross reference for
&gt; &gt;Vanagon Syncro parts with the Syncro parts from Quantum Syncros and/or
&gt; &gt;Audi Quattros?
&gt; 
&gt; hmmmm. for those of you with microfiche, you might check the part numbers of
&gt; the syncro parts. what i've seen seems to indicate that Vanagon parts, that
&gt; is, parts specific to Vanagons, start with 25x-xxx-xxxx. so if the syncro
&gt; parts start with something else, it MIGHT be an indication that the parts
&gt; are NOT Vanagon specific.  i think i've got a Syncro car fiche at home, so
&gt; i'll look and see what i can see tonight. don't have any audi fiche ... the
&gt; dealer isn't nearly as nice and accomodating. :(
&gt; 

I'm pretty sure the all-wheel-drive system on the Vanagons is different from the 
Audi system, which is also used on the Quantums.
