&gt;I'm having a very hard time finding tires. MXL's are suposedly
&gt;discontinued and My tire guy hasn't been able to find MXT's. I've found
&gt;some 185/14 light truck tires but they look very narrow. I have them on
&gt;my Nissan p'up. They work well but I'd like to use the original size
&gt;tire on the Vanagon. Any help would be appreciated.

I run Michelin light truck tires on my '85 GL and have been very pleased.
 Last month I put a set of XC LT4 (LT195 75R14) on and they ride and handle
great.  Sears had them in stock, installed them in 1 hour, and I was on my
way.  Hope this helps.
