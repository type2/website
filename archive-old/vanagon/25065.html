Subject: Re: Viking Edition/Ra Edition

How about the Thor Hyerdahl (sp) &quot;Ra&quot; edition made out of bound together
reeds and sticks. Dang, talk about engine fire hazard potential. The good
thing was that you could take the family camping and boatng on the same
weekend and not have to tow a trailer. Kinda like a Westfalia schwimmer
model. You should see the floating tent option! The down side was that cross
winds could carry you to Hawaii unless you had those expensive reinforced
sidewall sails. =)



Jon Querries re the &quot;Viking Edition&quot;&quot;
&gt;&gt;What does this constitute??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I think what the ad is referring to is VWs answer to the &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot;
&gt;edition of Ford's Bronco...in this case the Thor Hyadal (sp?) limited
&gt;edition Vanagon...
&gt;
&gt;It came complete with a wood carved dragon figurehead bolted to the
&gt;front of the van...each passenger has their own helmet complete
&gt;with horns...the CD player comes pre-programed with only ONE
&gt;CD...Wagner's Die Valkerie....and for additional
&gt;gas mileage there is a mast and sail arangement that can be
&gt;raised to take full advantage of tail winds...
&gt;
&gt;According to &quot;Rodent Track&quot; (the magazine of the rat race) the
&gt;sail can, with sufficient tail wind, blow that sucker clear up
&gt;a 30% incline.
