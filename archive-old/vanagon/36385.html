&gt; the vin number on a 64 single cab is in the same place as any split- look in
&gt; the engine compartment on the right side on the fire wall there is a metal
&gt; plate.  Maybe your need to get out a scrub brush and clear off the gook and
&gt; tar.   

Um, somewheres in time I changed that to be on the air box in the (US) passenger
side.  Which is where steves is - I saw it meself.

&gt; hey - a little advice to anyone with the solid engine brace used on buses
&gt; produced before the beginning of 64- this means any with the pullout front
&gt; oor handles.  If you have the brace there, dont let the inspector close the
&gt; engine lid, or theyll bend the brace.  :(

I don't let _anyone_ touch my engine lid for that very reason.
