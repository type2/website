&gt; To any and all,
&gt;       Fairly minor problem has occurred (unless I drive at night).  My
&gt; headlights won't turn on.  The running lights work, and the highbeams work.
&gt;  I checked the fuses and they seemed fine.  This same problem happened a
&gt; month ago but after flipping the headlight switch a couple of times they
&gt; turned on and now they will not at all.
&gt; Any ideas would be much appreciated!

Umm, how about a bad switch?  Or is that too obvious?  Wire around it
and find out.
