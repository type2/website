About 5 or 6 years ago, the right front suspension of my '82 developed a
&quot;clunk&quot; sound when going over bumps, chuckholes, etc.  I tracked this down to
the right front wheel upper &quot;A&quot; arm.  This piece attaches to the frame with a
bolt that runs through from from to back at the bottom of the &quot;A&quot;.  Between
the legs of the &quot;A&quot; there is a tube that connects the two legs, and the bolt
threads through this tube.  In my case, the weld at one end of the tube
failed.  At that time, I was able to get VW to repair the problem.

Well, it sounds like the problem is back, but I haven't been able to visually
confirm.  

Have any of you had this or a similar problem?

Thanks
Harvey
