&gt; extension cord. Does anybody know why Canadian Vanagon westies have a
&gt; built-in cord? Is this why the access flap is down near the bottom of the
&gt; vehicle?

Hi  Alistair.

I think CSA might have something to do with it.  All Canadian RV's 
have built in powercords.  Actually, I thought that all RV's did, but 
maybe I'm wrong.

Have a good one,

Harry.
