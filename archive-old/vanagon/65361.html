Well, at least I plan on going (of the CCC group).  I think I'll camp with
Jim since I don't think anyone else from the CA camping group is serious.
I just did my CV joints today for the drive.  Someone from from IRC
channel #VW said they'll come from Phoenix if I go.

We should have an Internet camp there.  I plan on getting there sometime
Friday.  I'm open for a caravan from the bayarea, but I want to do some
other things, ya know... be one with the wind and all.
