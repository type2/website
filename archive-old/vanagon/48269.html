Subject: Vanagon AC

Hello All,

I have a 1986 Vanagon GL with AC.  The AC does not work right know.  I think
it needs freon.  Has anyone had there Vanagon AC converted to the new &quot;Green
gas&quot;?

How well does the work anyway ?  Is it worth putting the money into?

Also does anyone know a likely cause for the clutch on the compressor not
pulling in?  I can apply power and it pulls in ok so  know the clutch is ok.


Sorry for all the questions so quickly but I start a new job in a week and
its shirt and tie.  I sweat alot so therefore all the questions.


Thanks
