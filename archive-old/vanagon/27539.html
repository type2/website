Subject: Re: The Forever Car (or Bus)

Anybody ever read the book &quot;Why Trade It In?&quot;  Early editions had a couple 
chapters on how much waste goes on in cars since the average life was 12 
years from showroom to junkyard.  Later ones took it out.  At that time he 
had some really great figures as far as national savings if this average 
went from 12 to 20 years, as it was at the end of WWII.  Also took care of 
the car builders put out of work, since more people would be needed for 
maintenance and other stuff.  (The basic premise was preventive maintenance, 
i.e. replace the fuel pump every 75,000 miles whether it needs it or not.  
This was for non-mechanics who never wanted to be stranded and had a lot of 
good ideas.)

When I was back in college in early '80s (second time) I read some papers in 
the library written in '68 on some very effecient 1, 2, and 3 passenger cars 
- gasoline powered.  The big problem with this is the same as motorcycles - 
safety.  Driving a motorcycle for one person is efficient until the guy in 
the Lincoln nails you.
