Subject: Re[2]: backfire!




&gt;What causes are there for backfiring (mine's starting to do it on the
&gt;down shift).  I know incorrect timing can cause this - why exactly?  Is there
&gt;residual compressed gas in the cylinder during exhaust stroke followed with
&gt;late ignition?  What other causes can lead to backfiring other than the
&gt;timing disorder?

Another possible cause for backfiring is a leak in the exhaust system. During
the downshift, vacuum will draw outside (oxygen rich) air in through the leak
and cause a backfire.  It will be even worse if your engine is poorly tuned (ie,
late timing or over-rich mixture). I have found this a problem with some of the
header systems for the type II and early type II engines that used the little
&quot;doughnut&quot; behind the heat exchanger. The pipes would shift and vibrate, and
cause a leak. On the last set I had on my '66 Bug (God rest it's soul- It gave
it's life so that I might live!) I bought a set of flanges from the local bug
shop and welded them on the back of the heater box and on the end of the header
pipes.They bolt together using a gasket, and never leaked up till the very end.
Before that, I used Hi-temp silicone and muffler patch compound, but it never
lasted. Of course, if I hadn't lowered the car so much (Mufflers dragged the on
small speed bumps,etc), the problem would never of happened.Just a thought.
