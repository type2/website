Subject: VW Classic or Bust - IT WAS BUST :-(

Being a major sponsor of the VW Classic normally inspires one to make an
appearance, bring along a few things to sell, go to the SOTO Meet, Toy Show,
hobknob, etc.  But due to an uncooperative 80 Wanagon, I failed to make the
first one in 11 years.

I should have known it was a bad omen 2 1/2 weeks before when I cracked a
piston ring in #2, just before Sacramento Bug-O-Rama (didn't make that one
too).  I figured what the heck, I'll make the Classic after throwing new
P&amp;L's, seals and gaskets, break it in properly, etc.  Was runnin' fine up
thru Wed 6-5 and after loading Safari Windows, Side Steps, Display Cases,
etc., in 100+ degree weather I was ready to roll at 2AM Thursday to be in
L.A. to go to the annual WCM Host Sponsor party that afternoon/evening (it
takes about 11 to 12 hours to reach L.A. from Redding by way of loaded
Wanagon).

So everything's fine, oil temp is doin' just great at 190F until I reach the
north end of Lodi, just south of Sacramento (I-5 at CA Hwy 12) and after a
few jerks, clatters and such the 2.0 just locks up!  Seized to the MAX.  I
call an uncle who lives in Stockton a few miles down the road and have the
Wanagon towed to his place.  Call my sister in West Sacramento to haul my
butt back to Redding (she say's &quot;I didn't wanna go into work today anyway&quot;).
 My funds are stretched a bit thin, so I can't rent a van to continue south
to the shows, so I spend the rest of Thursday and Friday looking for a truck
and flatbed trailer to eventually haul it back to Redding on Saturday (which
I did).  Spent today unloading the stuff back into the warehouse.  In
addition to good chunk of change spent on sponsoring, about $150 in gas
(Wanagaon &amp; truck) the potential loss of about $5000 of possible on-site
sales, I'd say it was a BUST.

But I'm sure it was a great time to be had by all that were there :-)   Hey
Rusty, give me some details when ya get back - thanks!
