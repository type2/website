Subject: RE: Shop Manuals



&gt;Anyway, the new company I work for, AllData, sells manuals
&gt;on CDROM that have the TSB, recall, info, wiring diagrams,
&gt;diagnostic and repair procedures, test procedures, maintenance
&gt;schedules, and bunches of other stuff.

What is the source of these manuals? Are they Bentley reprints, or Haynes,
or etc., or did Alldata write them themselves?
