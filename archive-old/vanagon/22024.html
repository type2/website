Subject: Water pump and plumbing &lt;the sink, not the engine&gt;

I have a couple questions related to the drinking water system in my '74
Westfalia. But first, let me bore you with a little background information:

This all started when my nephew proved that those little electric pumps really
aren't designed to be run dry. He was sure that if he left the pump on for 
a little while some water would eventually come out...... now it doesn't work
at all. 

The water tank is a custom molded affair - says &quot;Westfalia Campmobile&quot; on the
side of it - and has two female threaded inserts molded into the bottom. The 
pump was threaded into one of these and the drain valve into the other. The
drain valve, incidentally, has been seized shut since I bought the bus in '87
and needs to be replaced too.

Now, I have never been happy with having the pump mounted to the bottom of the
tank since it sticks down into the storage cabinet below. This is a waste of
precious space and the pump is always being banged into by pots and pans and
other objects - I am nervous that eventually something will hit the pump
hard enough to crack the 21 year old plastic water tank which, short of 
stealing the one out of Sami's '75, would be difficult to locate a replacement
for.

Sooooooo, in true Kautzian fashion, I have turned a small repair job into a 
bigger pump relocation job. Now, lucky for you, I have already successfully
installed a new pump on the wall of the lower cabinet, moved the wiring  and
hooked it up electrically. Here's where I need help:

I bought some brass fittings with the same threads &lt;3/8&quot; male pipe taper&gt; as
the old pump. I wrapped the threads in teflon tape and installed them as 
tight as a dared - there is no way to hold on to the metal threaded piece 
piece molded into the tank. They leak. Very slowly, but they do leak. What 
sort of a sealant can I put on those threads that will effect a seal but will
not poisen those who drink the water? Is the pipe thread sealant that the 
hardware store sells safe? The tube says &quot;Do not take internally, if swallowed
do not induce vomiting, blah blah blah&quot;. How about using RTV Silicone? It is
very unlikely that these fitting will ever have to be removed now that the
pump is moved. Epoxy?

Second question: What sort of hose should I use to connect all this plumbing 
together? Same theme here, I want to use something that is safe. Is that 
clear, flexible plastic tubing &lt;PVC, I think&gt; going to pose any health 
hazards to the kidlets? The RV store where I bought the replacement pump
sells some &quot;potable tubing&quot; but the stuff &lt;gray plastic&gt; is very rigid and
nearly impossible to get over the barbed fittings on the pump. 

Sorry this is so long. Thanks in advance.
