Subject:      SA Quad round driving light grille....possible group purchase

Hello all again, while on the current topic of a group purchase from Germany
for the fender flares, I would like to bring up the other possible group
purchase I was looking into awhile back, the group purchase of the Vanagon
Quad round headlight/driving light grille from South Africa.

I posted this awhile back, and still have the list of all who were interested
at that time. this is the headlight arrangement that is currently being used
on the new Vanagons (Caravelles) that are being made by VWSA.

[Oo  \X/   oO]

the &quot;kit&quot; consists of the grille ('88-'91 style w/ the larger \X/ emblem and
wider fins)
and 2 round smaller driving lights that are incorporated into the grille.

for those w/ '86-'91 Vans, you will need to pirate the round headlamps and
housings off a '80-'85 van (simple process to change - the pilot holes are
already there ) get the wires and plugs too. These '80-'85 housings are
relatively cheap and easy to find in junkyards, cause usually nobody wants
them!

here are some sites that have pics of the new SA Vanagons w/ the quad round
driving light grilles:

Unfortuneately, I personally won't be able to coordinate the group purchase.
I have made all the contacts, and have quite a bit of info, and prices (the
whole unit will run around $300 (US), and would like to find someone who
would volunteer to take this over for me.
the only feasable way to do this is a group purchase, because shipping costs
would be cost prohibitive to ship kits individually...

Is there still enough interest in a group purchase, and is someone interested
in taking it from here??

let me know....
