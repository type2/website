Subject: Its not Friday but...

	Folks,
	As some, particularly Jeff S. know, beside VWs and poetry, I
coach an Odessey Of The Mind team. In some ways, a good preparation for
VW ownership, perhaps. Anyway, there's a story about OM, an organization
that encourages creative and spontanious problem solving for kids,
in the current issue of Smithsonian. And *I* got quoted saying something
about kids needing to spend more hands-on time getting greasy! I'm famous!
	Odessey of the Mind encourages a lot of the same self suffience
and originality I see every day here on this list. I figure doing something
is better than just gripeing about Kids Today...
