&gt; &gt;...          Also, I propose that we adopt &quot;UrineVan&quot; as the list-approved
&gt; &gt;slang for the latest generation of bus.  Good one, Wizzer!
&gt; 
&gt; now, now, children. :)  as much as i like a good phrase, i'm afraid that the
&gt; Urinevan name just doesn't fit. all the other nicknames (split-window,
&gt; bread-loaf/bay-window, brick) refer to an external feature or the shape of
&gt; the bus. besides ... EuroVans don't come in yellow in this country. ;)

Aw, Unca Joel!  You take away all of our fun...  ;)

&gt; 
&gt; so what does a Eurovan look like?  

A Minivan.  I'm sorry, but that's the first thing that comes to mind
every time I see one.  But I'll try to think of something that will
be tolerable to the EV set.

&gt;well, it ain't a loaf of bread. it ain't
&gt; a brick. it's rounded, tall, and has a short nose. hmmmmm. i'm not getting
&gt; any ideas here. anybody else?

I'll let ya know when I think of something......


later....
