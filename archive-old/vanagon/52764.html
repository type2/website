Lopez is a master cost cutter.  He was hired away from GM Purchasing to
help VW &quot;cut&quot; the cost of their cars by &quot;cutting&quot; the cost of the parts.
 This ment outsourcing parts and moving production out of Germany to
Spain where labor costs are lower.  The information he &quot;stole&quot; related
to outsourcing companies he had negotiated with while at GM, whom he
quickly contacted once at arrived at VW.  The rub is this...is he using
information gathered while at GM (confidential contract legal stuff) to
negotiate a deal for VW.

&gt;
&gt;Well, I remember reading in Business Week (I think) that VW's interest
&gt;in   
&gt;Lopez was simply for his marketing know-how.  In my opinion, there are 
&gt; 
&gt;two types of car companies:
&gt; 1-Companies who build cars for selling
&gt; 2-Companies who build cars for driving
&gt;
&gt;GM clearly build cars for selling and VW, obviously, for driving.  I am
&gt;  
&gt;certain that from VW's standpoint, there is no need to steal secrets
&gt;from   
&gt;a company who cannot even change the oil of a Rabbit.
&gt;
&gt;My two centavos!

&gt;
&gt;Joel and others,
&gt;What really gets me is why would VW risk their future and reputation to
&gt;steal car designs and and other sensitive information from a sh*t
&gt;company like GM??  Why would VW want to lower their standards?  Maybe
&gt;they figured their new cars lasted too long.  Maybe they wanted them to
&gt;break down more often and wear out more quickly just like those GM
&gt;cars.
&gt;
&gt;I don't get it, but if VW loses this suit and has to pay GM billions of
&gt;dollars, I fear what will happen to VW.  Bankruptcy?  Man, and we think
&gt;it's hard and expensive to get parts now!  Imagine if VW went under!
&gt;Granted, that's worst-case scenario but I don't like it.
