&gt;From a newbie Breadloaf owner:

Had to work on Sunday this week :(

Problem;  on the way to work, just about a half an hour ago, my EGR
warning light in my '76 Breadloafer illuminated.

Symptomes;  none.  The warning light was accompanied by no loss of
power or performance.  The bus was just smogged this last week with
excellent performance (it must be mentioned that some tweaking had 
be done to the vehicle first).  It measured 73 ppm per max 250 ppm 
in HC's and 1.83% per max 3.50% in CO.

I will look in my Haynes manual tonight when I get home about the
warning light and its meaning.  But if anyone has had the same problem
before, tell me please about your experience.... that way I can 
compare the manual's fix to your fix to my fix   :)

Thanks in advance
