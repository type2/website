 sounds like a lot of work.There is a marked difference in power between
 my 86 2.1L Transporter and my wifes' 85 GL (but not enough to justify
 all the work). I credited that to mine being from Canada(see 2 below).I
 would like to explore easier ,more conventional ways to gain HP.
 How about: &gt;&gt;


Actually,  if  you are only swapping the long block, the 2.1 is a perfect
fit.  Since I usually use a complete used engine for thse conversions,  I
change the nneded pieces to use the 2.1 cooling system as it works better.  I
use the 2.1 exhaust also.  Use the 1.9 injectors if using the 1.9 FI.
 Everything else interchangable with minor wiring changes.

Dennis.

PS.  Done this conversion many times.
