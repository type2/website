Subject: Hoops for pick up truck 


        Hi All

        A question on parts prices.

        I saw and touched an original set of the 

        metal hoops for the canvas cover, over the truck bed,

        A no rust holes, seems to be no cracks all fittings are 

        present, surface rust and pitting, (no paint)

        The clamping bands need minor straiting, they are 

        rounded to fit the form of the top of the hoop.

        If they were installed they would be about (guessing) 

        1 1/2 to 2 feet above the cab.

        Could yous give me an experenced guess at reasionable 

        price for thies. The guy wants to play, ya know, 

        &quot;well how much would you give me for them?&quot; ect....

        I'm not all that sure I want to put a canvas cover on the 
        truck any way, but I do think thies things are 

        kinda rear to find.

        Tnx fer the help. Laurie
