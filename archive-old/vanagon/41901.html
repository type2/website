Does anybody have experience of fitting a gas/electric fridge to replace the 
coolbox? - given the standard Westfalia (1973, UK)  layout with the coolbox 
in the cabinet by the sliding door.

If there's  insufficient depth to the cabinet, my tentative plan might also 
include removing the standard water tank and replacing it with a tank slung 
under the floor.

I've often considered this as a sensible improvement but cannot figure out 
how to install, safely, the fridge exhaust.

Mind you, with ground frosts in mid-May, I wonder if it's worth the effort.
