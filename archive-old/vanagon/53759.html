John -
	In response to your info noted below:
&gt; 
&gt; Recently Kelly Blue book went on line
&gt; 
&gt; www.kbb_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Their free service is simply incredible, they pegged the values of 
&gt; the '81 Westy, '85 GL, '90 Corrado (which I did much better on 
&gt; thankfully) as well as a number of others I've run right at what I 
&gt; would put at on the nose.  Two services one for what to pay from 
&gt; dealer (retail) the other for trade in value I'd put actual values 
&gt; between the two but in general they are on the money and are highly 
&gt; customizeable and know what should be on your '89 Syncro Deluxe 
&gt; Westy, etc and give a near correct market price for it.  Pretty neat, 
&gt; only go back to '75, and older values are a bit on the low side of 
&gt; what &quot;collectibility&quot; if it exists seems to dictate prices will be.  
&gt; You would be hard for instance to get them to say anything over $2500 
&gt; for any late Bus camper unlike the exhorbitant values requested by 
&gt; some list members occasionally.  Of course I have paid $3800 for a 
&gt; '77 and people have told me I did well.

I recently lost a '91 Vanagon GL Camper/Westfalia to an engine fire. It was
a total loss, including most of my camping gear onboard. The vehicle was 
outfitted as follows:

	Fully loaded with all options (power everything, cruise, etc)
	Standard Transmission
	Alloy Wheels
	Custom Heidleburg Stereo with tape and security detection
	Flash Silver Metallic Paint

	Mint condition, never driven winters (garaged)
	25,025 miles - detailed records (every gallon of gas, maintenance, etc)
	Dealer maintained (at quite an expense!)
	about 50 miles on new VW battery ($107!)

	Add-ons included Custom Awning, Security system, VW/Vanagon &quot;Bra&quot;

The insurance adjuster is quoting me $17,500. This is actually less that the
NADA Blue Book! which seems to be his guide/Bible. Kelly Blue Book states
$24,180 as MA. dealer resale for this vehicle, before the Add-ons. We are at an
impass as I see it.

Two questions for anyone:

	What is the diference between the Kelly Blue Book and the NADA Blue
Book. Which is correct? It seems that Kelly gives credit for the 'collectable&quot;
value of this vehicle - but NADA doesn't?

	Any input that would assist me in the case with the Insurance Co. would
be greatly appreciated. I am in the process of trying to talk with my lawyer -
but that may get expensive!

	And ANY idea where I could find a similar vehicle would be greatly
appreciated!

Kenyon
