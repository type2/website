Subject: Inuvik write-up in VW World
Date: Fri, 31 Jan 97 13:40:23 -0600

well... sitting on the dealers counter is the Winter 1996 issue of
Volkswagen World.  and inside this issue a a write up with lots of photos on
the Inuvik trip.  and gee, kinda sounds like VW sponsored it.  naw, mebbe it
be my corrupted brain.  only one paragraph.

&quot;Volkswagen lent support to the venture by providing the participants with
oil changes and extra air filters to combat the dusty roads they'd be
traveling.  The company also gave Ron Lussier the use of a Volkswagen
EuroVan camper for the duration of the event.&quot;

the rest wasn't bad for a glossy promo. 
-dan (apologies if this has made the list already... and if it hasn't over
on Type2, could someone mention it?)
