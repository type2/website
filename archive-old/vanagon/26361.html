Subject: Re: Triangle N.C. gathering this weekend!!!!

Hi you guys! I wish to be there. As part of my research work I visited
several times the North Carolina Fish Barn where I did some collaborative
work with Dr. T. Losordo and Mr. Dennis Delong. What a grateful experience.
In fact some of the parts that my Westy carry on came from West German
Garage in Raleigh. I'm planning to visit the lab again at the end of the
year and spend some time looking around for some parts and cold beer. I
would like to share some time with you guys and talk about the VW scenario
here in Puerto Rico. Please let me know if anybody is interested in doing
that.

Best regards,

Angel
