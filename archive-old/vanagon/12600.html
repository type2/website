&gt;&gt;If the engine has minor problems then I would rebuild it myself. Buy all
needed
&gt;&gt;parts from VW dealer. 
&gt;
&gt;That strikes me as an unusual statement on this list. Wasn't the
&gt;conventional wisdom that VW is always more expensive than aftermarket
&gt;suppliers? I'm not at all suggesting that you're wrong; just curious to
&gt;hear on what you base your opinion?
&gt;

My experience has been that they are much more expensive.  We had an 87
Synchro that needed the exhaust replaced (rusty MN) and the parts were only
available at the dealer.  Was almost $1K!!!!!  It is ridiculous for any
manufacturer to make things &quot;dealer-only&quot;.
