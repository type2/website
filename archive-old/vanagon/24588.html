&gt; old 72 bus.  Could live with a hybrid.  So, whadya think?

Bob: all kidding aside; unless you need speed and are determined to get
something water cooled, why not get a diesel instead? They are cheap,
reliable and  probably a lot easier to install. Many of the people on the
list will testify to their durability and economy. Of course if you like
to go above 60mph.....
