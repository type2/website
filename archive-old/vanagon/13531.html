Subject: Re: $25,000 in Syncro Camper repairs

Fun to see all the posts coming back about my experience with repair bills.

The fact is, I am the 4x4 Westfalia  is the ultimate VW Van and I would do
it all again and if I crashed my 90 tomorrow I would go right out and buy a
used 88 and up syncro camper, no matter what. 

And now that I have transmutated into a automotive-knowledgeable person I'm
stuck. That is, I have transmutated and there is no way of going back--I
*like* it now. When I go to parties I know that I have to hide the wealth of
my Vanagon knowledge because if someone got me going, well, then, I'd never
stop and someone would say, &quot;There is some *nerd* over there talking about
*car parts* of all things!&quot;

Someone says, &quot;Oh yea, you should see it. Derek has this neat van and he
drives it on snowmobile trails&quot; and I just say, 

&quot;Yea,&quot; and bite my tonge.

And Jon is right, I am brutal to my van in a loving kind of way. A lot of my
repair expenses were similar to those Harry had--little niggling things that
I forced the dealer to fix two or three different times including fit and
finish type stuff.

For example, I forced them to fix the fact that the arm rest bolts come
loose, probably *every three months.* Each time they would tighten them,
bill VW, I would have had free parking again on the dealer's lot for a
couple of days. It never occurred to them to loctite the bolts because,
well, because they arn't told to do that. 

I know I went off the deep end last month when I bought *all* the speiclized
VW tools at a dealer going out of business here at auction. I paid about
$1,000 for these tools and I cannot find anything in my toolshed because the
floor is three to four feet high in these tools. I have to climb over them
to get anything in there and I have to figure out how to categorize them and
find a way to make them fit in there.

[Like, I gotta sell off all the cool tools for Corrodo, Bugs, Busses, etc.,
and just keep the special tools for Vanagon.  
Anyone who wants to shoot me a part number for a non-Vanagon tool, feel free
to do so, and when I get down to that level in the shed its yours, for, like
20% of wholesale cost. (These are the sorts of tools sold by Zelenda and
frustratingly mentioned throughout your Bentley catalog.)]

Only someone who didn't have one of these vehicles could be fooled by my
rhetoric and think that I ever had second thoughts about it. I haven't. 

I used to have doubts about Vanagon when I had a VW Bus. The bus seemed so
much friendlier, like a happy puppy dog. The Vanagon seemed more impersonal
and military like. But now that I have it I really couldn't go back. The
creature comforts are just too many and significant. 

I don't think I could ever *love* my Vanagon the way I loved my bus. But I
am certainly more *attached* to my Vanagon. It treats me nicer. I goes over
things. And I have heat in the winter. And the luxury is higher. Women in
business suits will get into it. 

How many women in business suits wanted to get in to my 72 bus? You know
what I am talking about. As they get in they look down to see if their dress
is going to swipe against some grease in the doorjam.

I don't get that in my Vanagon.  

So, back to my thoughts of suicide...

&gt;Derek,
&gt;	
&gt;	I don't mean to sound sarcastic but do you have the feeling that
&gt;you know this vehicle inside and out now, and it would be a shame to waste
&gt;that knowledge by buying a non-VW?
&gt;
&gt;Or do you want to try something different?
&gt;
&gt;I have often thought that it would be interesting to try and build my very
&gt;own 4WD &quot;westy&quot; from a 4WD Econoline (or similar American van). I've seen
&gt;passenger versions, and yes they are huge and tall and I don't know how
&gt;well they travel off-road, but could they be more expensive to run than a
&gt;Vanagon?
