&gt;&gt;ok folks. i went and did a very stupid thing ... and then forgot about it.
&gt;&gt;i called the vw dealer in atlanta and ordered 2 each of owner's manuals from
&gt;&gt;1977 to 1991.
&gt;
&gt;How far back can one go?

that i don't know. i'm gonna try to go back as far as i can, but i suspect
that 1975 or so would be the limit ... that's 20 years, and it would be a
bit much to expect anything prior to 75 to be still in some warehouse.

for the splits, didn't NEATO or SOTO reprint some owner's manuals??
