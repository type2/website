Subject: Vary Your Wiper Delay W.Special Relay

I sent away to a British VW Mag that advertised a &quot;Vay Your Interval Wipe&quot;
relay for VW wipers. I popped out my factory relay and poped in this special
relay and now I can select any interval for my intermittant wiper setting,
from, like, a minite to continuous.

I highly, highly recomend this simple mod to all Vanagon owners. 

I just tore the ad out of the mag (can't remember which one now, but it
might be  VW/Audi Car) and put my credit card number on it and specified a
NYC address. They sent it right away.

The relay is the ultimate in simplicity since there is no dial to set. You
set the interval wipe by turning the wiper off and then back on. The length
of time the wiper is off is the length of time the interval is set to.
