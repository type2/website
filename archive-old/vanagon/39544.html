&gt;i put in bosch platinums this sunday....and am having some problems now.
&gt;seems i back fire a little when i first start the engine. i push down on the
&gt;gas , the engine revs, then it wants to cut off when the engine is starting
&gt;to idle. i understand the platinums tend to run a little richer..what should
&gt;i do, go  back to regular bosch plugs...adjust the carb? what?
&gt;
&gt;

Unless somthing is wrong, no adjustments should be needed to run the
platinums.  I have had some experience with defective ones.  Inspect them to
make the tips did not separate and short out the electrode.  I find the
engines with marginal HC emission problems do clean up with these plugs.
 They will not make you van noticeably faster though.
