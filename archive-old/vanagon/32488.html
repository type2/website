I don't recall if it was you who was looking for VW toys, but here si 
teh list.


Here are some beautiful Siku 1/64 scale cars I just got in from
Germany. I will be carrying more varieties in the future. This is my
first sample run. All cars are mint in blisterpacks. All are
BEAUTIFULLY desigend, most with AUTHENTIC wheels!!! The detail is great
on these cars. I have a bunch in my own personnal collection and love
them! Each car has it's engine size, displacement, horsepower, torque,
and top speed (along with another figure I have not been able to figure
out yet) listed on the underside of the car! I only have 1-3 of each
car so hurry!

The cars on the first list are $6 each or $5 if you buy 5 or more.
