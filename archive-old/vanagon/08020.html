Subject: New Seats For Type II's

I have a very stock 65' Westfalia, and am looking on putting some more
comfortable seats in it. I would like to have comfortable seats in the van,
yet can be easily replaced by the stock seats. I definitely don't want to
do any drilling on the van or welding the seats to the floor! What I would
like to do is to bolt some sort of aftermarket seats on to an old set of
seat frames. That way they can be removed easily. Does anybody have any
particular brand names and/or model numbers that they would recommend?
