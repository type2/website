&gt; I have some confusion regarding the timing notches on the flywheel:

&gt; When setting the timing (Temp Sender II disconnected, revs at 2000 rpm)
&gt; which notch gives the required 5 degree ahead of TDC? In other words
&gt; which notch is which if either?

Do you really want to set it a 5 degrees?  I've got mine at 12, which is
probably too far.  8 degrees would probably be best for a good working
distributer.  I know the book says 5, but 8 works better.
