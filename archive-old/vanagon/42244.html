&gt;Turbo diesel swap! Sweet music to my ears. Perhaps you could
&gt;enlighten us with a writeup of the swap. If you have pictures
&gt;even better. I'm sure there are a lot of people willing to put
&gt;the up for examination on their WWW sites.

I second the motion!

I believe Vgons need more power (surprise!), but have had my share
of problems with the Chevy-V6 conversion of the V6anagon-- particularly
with the clutch, which is not yet resolved. An all-VW solution bodes
well for the future of the drivability of these otherwise-fine vans.
Bill Kennedy has had good results from his Porsche conversions (right,
Bill?), which are pretty much all-VW conversions. It would be nice to
see if all-VW conversions have fewer problems than the (one) non-VW
example I've had experience with.

How much power/torque are the turbo-diesel engines rated at?
