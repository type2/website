&gt;Today I was looking at my bus (1974, non-FI) and noticed some weird 
&gt;things in the airscoops.  There seems to be some metal tubing that comes 
&gt;up out of the engine, bends and heads back down into the engine 
&gt;compartment.  This tubing is about 1/4&quot; in diameter, and at the top there 
&gt;is a section that is about 1&quot; in diameter and about 6&quot; long.  Is it some 
&gt;kind of sensor or mechanical thermostat.  I know there is one under the 
&gt;engine, but is this part of it.  The tubing seems to be on both sides of 
&gt;the bus.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas what this is?

Yes I do.  These tubes are part of the fuel Vapor revory system.  They conect
from the top of the Gas Tank and lead back to the Carbon Canister at the top
of your engine compartment.  They are routed way up in the air on both sides
so that fuel can not siphpon onto a hot engine.  The carbon canister collects
fuel vapors when the engine is not runnig.  When the engine is running, the
combination of engine vacuum,(that valve on the air cleaner), and the cooling
fan, send these vapors into the engine to be burned off. Hopefully, this
syetm is still intact.  I have seen this system partially dissasembled allow
fuel to be spilled onto the engine after overfilling the tank and then having
the fuel expand.
