Subject:      flushing cooling system

--------------
        Could some one please point me to the cooling system flushing and draining
in the Bentley book for an 86 westy.I have found the bleeder valve in the
engine compartment and the one on top of the radiator,the 2 engine head
drain plugs.What is confusing me is in the Bentley after removing the head
drain plugs page 19.15 the manual seems to go into a rant about removing
the engine and clamping off hoses.Now all I want to do is flush out the old
and install some new.Filling the cooling system page 19.16 seems straight
forward enough and should be no problem.
        There is a lot of cooling system information in the archive,but none seems
to cover draining of the system.After reading through the archive it is
unclear which hoses need to be pulled if any.  tia
