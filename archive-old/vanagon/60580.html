Subject: Rear hatch lock question.

I have the following curious situation on my '90 Westfalia:

The rear hatch lock does not seem to unlock using the key. The key can't
catch the lock for some reason. The only way I can get it open is from
the inside by removing the plastic latch cover on the door and pushing
on the metal bar inside. 

Can anybody famaliar with this problem suggest a solution?

Thanks,

Jeff
