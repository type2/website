&gt;Yo Cheese!,
&gt;
&gt;You mentioned that you saw a 'schmidt for sale in Austin. Was it recently?
&gt;Do you remember a price or a location/address/phone? Your help is appreciated.

&gt;BTW: My wife tells of naming a doll &quot;Cheese&quot; as a very young kid. The doll
&gt;had blonde hair and said that she hadn't thought of naming it. Some adult
&gt;asked the dolly's name and wouldn't let up until she coughed up a name. Just
&gt;to jerk off the adult she named it &quot;Cheese.&quot; 
&gt;

No, it's been at least a year ago.  It was at the service station at South
Lamar and Barton Skyway.  I think it was sort of an orange color, on a trailer?
