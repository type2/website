Subject: Head gasket leaks
Date: Wed, 7 Dec 94 15:08:19 EST

This information may be of interest to wasserboxer owners - the use of #3
aviation head gasket compound (Permatex or equivalent) was claimed to
work by a guy on rec.autos.vw. He says to retorque the heads after 1000
miles. Says it also works on VW diesels.

Question: is this the silicone stuff that comes in gold, orange, grey and
black
and would it be ok for sealing the oil valve covers on an air-cooled engine?
