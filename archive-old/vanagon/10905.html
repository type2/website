One thing that you could do (It'll be almost as good as new) to salvage
your distributor, using thread inserts.  The type that works well is
E-Z LOK Thread Inserts.  You only need to use standard dills and taps.  
Simply drill hole to the appropriate size of the thread insert.  Tap w/
a standard tap and clean newly threaded hole with a de-greaser. Insert 
E-Z LOK with a bolt.  These come with a self-locking epoxy adhesive on the
external threads, so you want to clean the threaded hole well.  THe only 
thing is the size - smallest that I've seen is 4-40 internal thread.  (Re-
quires a 10-32 Tap size.)  You can get the thread inserts (E-Z LOK) from 
Small Parts Inc. (in FL) Their # is (305) 557

-8222. (one of my favorite 
catalogs)  Hope this helps.

Christian
