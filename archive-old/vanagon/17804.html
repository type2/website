Subject: bass in a bus (wasRe: crutchfield/stereo)

I installed one o' those inexpensive radio shack bass cannons under the rear
seat with the official mounting device of vanagons. (Bungee cords)
Works great.  Has a 100 watt (peak) amp built in.  Has dual voice coils
so one speaker handles both right &amp; left channels. (Bass is s'posed to
be omnidirectional  anyway)
sounds ok, but not spectacular.   (somewhat muddy)
I wonder if I taped over the ported end of the bass tube if that would
'tighten up' the sound ...  ???
