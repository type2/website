&gt; The Eurovan was the lowest-priced car on that list at
&gt; 23,235.  For that money you could buy the most perfect
&gt; condition 23-window deluxe ultra-cool bus and have
&gt; money left over for a Karmann Ghia convertible just
&gt; in case you ever really wanted to go fast.
&gt; 
&gt; Think of the air-cooled fun you could have in the place
&gt; of the Roll Royce convertible at almost $300,000!
&gt; 
	Gawd. Air cool this...........................weezer
