Subject: Re: Intros

Erik&gt; There were only 2 types of Ghias: Coupes and Convertables.
Erik&gt; Sunroofs and Ragtops came on the bugs only, to the best of my
Erik&gt; knowledge. (OK, there were also Type III Ghias, but that's a
Erik&gt; different animal).

        Hmm. I have been looking at a '63 Ghia for sale parked out on a lot
here in Austin. Has a sunroof, looks decent. Is this a hack job? If so,
they did a good job-might be a good barganing chip if it's not stock
though. As for ragtop, I have always understood that to be slang for
convertible. What's the difference? My apologies if I have grossly stepped
upon anyones toes...   ;-)

Peace,
