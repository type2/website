 &gt; &gt;Uh... couldn't you achieve the same thing by throwing gravel at a
 &gt; &gt;pile of Coke bottles? But that wouldn't be music (either), would it?
 &gt; 
 &gt; no, but hanging a bunch of metal pipes outside and letting the wind bang
 &gt; them into each other is.   ???  :)

One of the things Cage was exploring was just what *is* music anyway?  If you 
think about it, it's pretty hard to define.  For almost any definition you 
come up with, someone else can say &quot;Well, yeah, but what about XXXX?&quot;.
  As I see it, Cage's 4'33&quot; is a piece that asks you to stop for a few 
minutes, think about what music *is* and listen to the music of the *world*.

  But this has nothing to do with Vanagonia.  At least it's FFriday.  (That's 
Friday, but Fortissimo...)
