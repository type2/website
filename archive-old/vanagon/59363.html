&gt; As many of you know, I recently sold my 1986 Vanagon GL to purchase a 1988
&gt;  Wolfsburg Edition Vanagon.  My wife wanted an automatic transmission.  Again,
&gt; as before, several questions leap to mind as I am motoring along:
&gt; 
&gt;  #1.  Why are they called power mirrors when they don't seem to work?
&gt; 

The wiring has a tendency to go bad at the point where it leaves the
drivers door and goes into the main portion of the van.  Of course, you
first want to check fuse stuff, but it's probably a break in the wire. 
Especially if you also experience problems with the power door locks
and/or power windows (if you have them)--they share the same wiring
harness I believe.


&gt;  #2.  Isn't there supposed to be a gray plastic cover over the hinges on the
&gt; rear facing seats?
&gt; 

I can't recall any exposed hinges in my Wolfs, and I do believe that
there is grey plastic on the sides of those seats (I'm not going out
right now to look :)

&gt;  #3.  How did all the cupholders get broken?
&gt; 

Quite easily!  If you're referring to the bottom portion that supports
the cup, I believe it was designed to be a break-away component for
safety in the event of a crash.  Regardless, they easily pop back on
unless, of course, your PO conveniently lost them for you.  In that
case, you can apparently find replacements for them in a number of
department stores across the country.

&gt;  #4.  The &quot;ground effects&quot; kit will not allow the shaft on the Bilstein jack
&gt; to go in all the way - was this really designed by a German engineer?  Or do I
&gt; need a Special Editon jack?

I've had no problems using the jack that came with the van, so I can't
comment.


&gt; 
&gt;  #5.  The VW repair shop I used to recommend has proved unworthy.  Can anyone
&gt; recommend a good shop in Seattle?

As I'm sure you've discovered with your '86, the best garage in the
world is located at, conveniently, your own address (with virtual expert
advice from this wonderful list!)
