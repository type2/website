&gt; 
&gt; Canadian price 2.95/ft

Here are the prices I culled from the local Colorado dealers:
K+C RV, 800.452.5278, $2.95US/ft.
Nolan's, 800.232.8989, $2.05US/ft.

Both shops will ship USMail, UPS, Fedex, whatever, to bypass Canadian/US 
customs nonsense.  No minimum orders, although they will need to order 
what you want.
