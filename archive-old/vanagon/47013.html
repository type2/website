Subject: Event-VWCA Convention-Rockford, IL

VWers:

The 1996 Volkswagen Club of America national convention is being
held in Rockford, Illinois starting today.  They are billing it
as Un-conventional because they are inviting VW folk who are not
members of VWCA to join them for a picnic and Show'n'Shine on
Sunday July 21 at Alpine Park in Rockford.  To encourage
participation, there is only a small $3 donation if you wish to
be &quot;show&quot; which also allows you to &quot;vote&quot; in the various classes.

I admit I don't know all the details.  From what I gather
8:00-11:00 a.m. will be register time and some awards will be
given out shortly after noon.  I plan to get there mid-morning
and leave early afternoon, just to show my face and my '67 Deluxe
and meet some fellow VW-enthusiasts.  This is a family-oriented
show which is not a &quot;swap meet&quot; and not a beerfest.  Alpine Park
does not allow vendors or alcohol.

So...if you will be or can be in the area of Rockford this
weekend stop by.  For NEATO or LiMBO members, I am listed in the
TTT and have space if you wish to camp in the midst of
cornfields.  I have a 3-acre farmette about 30 miles from Alpine
Park, in DeKalb, Illinois.
