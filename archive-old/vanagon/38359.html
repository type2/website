My understanding is that pancakes (thinking 2.0 L here...) are more 
reliable than uprights generally, but are generally more expensive to 
repair when they do break down.  They are certainly more powerful 
(relatively speaking, of course).

&gt; p.s.  did any of the model yrs have front seat that could swivel
&gt; toward the rear?  when?  could they be retrofit? or did all yr.
&gt; campers have the &quot;wall&quot; behind the front seats?

Our '76 has a front passenger seat that swivels to face to rear.  Our '76 
has a &quot;wall&quot; behind the driver's seat that comes up as high as the sink 
counter immediately behind it.  There is no wall behind the passenger 
seat.  If you get a bus with no wall behind the passenger seat, all you'd 
need to retrofit would be the swivel seat base.  I haven't seen any of 
these at wreckers around here--they might be hard to come by.
