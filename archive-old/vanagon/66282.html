Subject:      '87 Westy F/S on Cape Cod

While driving around yesterday I spotted an 87 charcoal gray metalic Westy
with a For Sale sign on it and did a U-turn to check it out.  Looks like it
came out of the show room.  no rust, but there is front end damage to the
grill area where he hit something.  Doesn't look like it would be too
expensive to fix.  Didn't have time to check milage as they has to go but
they only wanted $4700.00 for anyone interested I could get the phone
number.
