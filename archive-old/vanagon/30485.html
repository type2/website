Subject: Re: bus-buying checklist?


I've made several efforts to come up with such a check-list only to find I'd
made too many assumptions.  For example, checking for chipped/cracked glass
assumes the thing HAS glass.  Ditto for tires, axles and so forth.

I finally decided I had become over-sensitized by Grendel's supposed 'good
condition', ie, a vehicle that could be registered and driven.

To keep the decision tree to a manageable size perhaps it would be best to
have more than one check-off list, starting with Licensed/Operating vehicles
and working our way down...  Out of License,  Mechanically Complete, and
finally 'Grendelesque' -- the 'G-code' buses.

Whatever the number of check-off lists, all would have pretty much the same
structure, starting with a Gross Visual Inspection that involves a slow walk
around the vehicle, then a Mechanical Inspection, calling for a look inside
the engine compartment, jacking up the front wheels the test steering and
suspension, and a creeper-trip under the machine to inspect linkages, rust,
leaks and so forth.  Interior inspection and a test drive should give you
enough data to do a proper evaluation.  

Even so, the different styles of Type II should stress the features unique to
that style, which would call for additional branches on the decision tree.

In addition to a standardized check-off kept in all of the Type II related
archives, I think a video would be a good idea.  A list tells you what to
look for but if you've no experience with the sound of a bad differential
bearing you might confuse it for a wheel bearing.  Hearing/seeing the thing
on TV would be a big help in learning what to SENSE when getting to know a
bus... and would be very handy for the novice doing his first tune-up,
brake-job and so forth.
