Long day!

Today I removed the motor from the bus, which was more difficult than
it should have been due to the top two bolts being rusty, which I had not
anticipated.  I ended up taking out the tire tray working from the top
with my whole body in the engine compartment.

I also pulled both rear drums to have a look-see at the brakes.  I have 
good linings, but I can't tell the condition of the whell cylinders.
These brakes are quite different than what I'm used to, and I wonder about
the availability of parts.  The soaking of lug nuts and wheen nuts paid
off - they came off like butter!  Cleaned everything and put it back together
without further disassembling the brakes.

I also made a small discovery:  the speedo cable still attaches to the left
wheel, even though the bus is RHD.  Its just a lot longer cable than normal
busses.  A friend of mine consulted his parts book, and it seems the entire
front end is RHD only - steering box, pedals, beam, drag link, yada yada yada.
All RHD only.  Interesting.

I tried to remove the exhaust to make the motor easier to store, and got
as far as getting the muffler nuts off, but the pipes are rust-welded together.
More liquid wrench...

Next I'm going to cut some of the extranneous metal off, and then I'm ready
to start blasting...

I was slated to go look at a '67 single cab with Steve Johnson, but he
partied a bit too much last night, and called me about 1 in the afternoon
asking if I knew where he'd left his clothes...  Musta been one heckuva
party...
