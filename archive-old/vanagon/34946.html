Subject: Re: 1974 Bus price

That sounds very high.  I paid $1400 for mine, which is in better than 
average condition.  It's a Westy, with everything inside working except 
the stove, which was removed.  kThe motor runs great, the body is 
straight (mostly), of course it's painted like a cow which could have 
some effect on the price:)

I'd say that $2000 would be the absolute highest price to pay, and only 
then if the paint is new, no dents on the body and with a rebuilt 
engine.
