Subject: RE: throw out bearing


&gt;Actually, it really does not.  Although a beetle throw-out bearing appears
&gt;to fit,  the proper bearing has a larger face surface wear it meets the
&gt;pressure plate.  I have used both with no immediate problems.  I hate when 
&gt;parts suppliers provide the beetle bearing at the Vanagon bearing price.  
&gt;I guess they know the interchange also.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;About 18 months ago I had my clutch replaced with a new sachs unit. and 
&gt;&gt;all was ok untill wendsday when it went south on me. The shop that has 
&gt;&gt;the van now showed me the problem with the old clutch, the throw out 
&gt;&gt;bearing did not match the pressure plate.. Is it possible that the other 
&gt;&gt;shop tried to bluff there way through the instal by placing a beattle 
&gt;&gt;t/o bearing with a vanagon pressure plate?? 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Actually, a Vanagon *does* use the same throwout bearing as a Beetle.

Although VW listed different T/O bearing part numbers in their original 
fiche, these parts are no longer sold by Sachs (the original supplier to 
Volkswagen).  The only one listed by Sachs is their part number SN31846, 
designated as a direct OEM replacement for use in all Vanagons, plus busses 
and bugs from '71.  I suppose maybe you could get the original one from 
Volkswagen themselves, but I've never tried myself, and don't anyone who 
has.  If you buy a Sachs T/O bearing from a FLAPS or mail-order 
distributor, no matter how much you pay or what they call it, you're likely 
to get the universal one because it is the one Sachs sells for this 
application.  That said, I've used the Sachs T/O bearing in every late 
busses and vanagon I've ever had, and never had one fail except after a 
*lot* of miles.
