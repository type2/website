&gt;&gt; You have discovered the difference in the heater boxes. On the bug
&gt;&gt; the cables connect down below. The bus connections are on top. There
&gt;&gt; is a kit that you can buy to make the modification.
&gt;
&gt;Where are these kits availible? Thanks

Yeah, I'm interested in this, too.  I got new heat exchangers but the old
ones were just wired open so I don't know how they're supposed to be hooked
up.  The pictures in the Bentley I've got seem to show the connection on the
bottom, which someone else pointed out won't reach the cables.
