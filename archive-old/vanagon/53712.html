Subject: Re(2): Rocker Mouldings

Kenyon,

Thanks for the response on the Vanagon rocker mouldings which I am looking for. 
I called the specialty shop that you referred me to, and they said they did'nt
have any of the mouldings.  They get them from wrecking yards.  He said they are
fiberglass, and need to be painted to match the color of the Vanagon.  Also said
they only came on 88 and later vehicles. 

Therefore, if you ever see a set of these fiberglass mouldings in your travels,
please give me a shout. 

Thanks,

Charles
