     Hi Richard,
     
     Nice to see that you've joined the &quot;Deluxe crew&quot;. Is it a 21-window?
     
     On the front panel theme, you could drill a hole through it, tie a 
     piece of rope through the hole and round a tree! then reverse it.
     But to be honest you can never get a bent peice of metal back to its 
     original shape because the metal will have been stretched in various 
     places and it's impossibe to do the opposite.
     
     It's a nasty job to weld the front panel in, but not half as nasty as 
     the results of a pull'n'bondo job. Replacing complete panels is really 
     easy. You'd have to cut the seams at either side and the bottom, and 
     cut somewhere under the windscreen. Then trim the new panel until it 
     fits in snug then MiG the sucker all the way round - no bondo needed 
     apart from covering the welds.
     
     Lee.
