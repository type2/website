&gt; So, what has worked in getting these nuts off for you? How big a
&gt; breaker bar, how long a cheater pipe? If I cook the nut with a
&gt; propane torch, will it cook the rubber grease seals?
&gt; 
Bugpack makes a 46mm wrench, for under $5.00, that you put on the nut
and bang on it with a regular hammer. I got one, and it takes about a
minute to loosen it up, but it is AMAZINGLY easy, and pretty much
hassle-free, as well as nothing to break.
