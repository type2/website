Subject: Re: VW issue Vanagon floor mats $10.00


&gt;I bought the third to last set of Vanagon mats, so call 610-253-6244 quick
&gt;if you are interested.  The guy I talked to couldn't believe all the calls
&gt;he's been getting, from GA, CA, etc.

Gee, I wonder who the California guy was.   :^)

Between Bill and me, the mats should have said V6anagon, or something
close. Equal representation for hybrids!!!!
