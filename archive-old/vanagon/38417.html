Subject: Re: End play (was: Siezed pancake on table)

&gt;   Take a big flat screwdriver and pry the flywheel away from the case.
There
&gt; should be a tiny amount of endplay,   thunk thunk is junk.   rebuild that
&gt; bottom end.   You can seize yr motor by building it without ANY endplay.
&gt; 
Isn't this just going to bend the flywheel a tiny bit?  I tried to 
measure the endplay on my brand new engine before I installed but 
couldn't get anything to move.  I did the screwdriver plying bit but 
felt I was only bending the flywheel 0.004 or whatever.  I am hoping 
that when I have it out for a new clutch I will have been enlightened 
as to the proper way to check this.  I have the little measuring 
device.  I just can't seem to get ANY movement.  I assume there must 
be some or I wouldn't have gotten these last 3,500 miles.  
Please advise.  Thanks, Jim

Your flywheel is a thick very sturdy piece of metal.  If you can warp it this
way it's junk to start with.  Im not talking about really cranking on it,
just pulling the flywheel away from the case.   The appropriate amount of
endplay is very small, so I is not obvious.   Please go ahaead and measure
endplay before putting in a new motor, if it hasn't been done by a shop.  If
your new motor was buildt by a shop, and it came back with the flywheel on,
they should have done the endplay, and i wouldn't worry.
