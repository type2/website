&gt; no one in the family ever married a brother or sister. that kind of stuff
&gt; doesn't happen in alabama. it's been agin the law for 160 years. can't even
&gt; marry your first cousin. has to be at least a third cousin or beyond.
&gt; 
&gt; so there. :P
&gt; joel &quot;Is that my Mint Julip, honey-chile?&quot; walker
&gt; 

So who was that Jerry Lee Lewis was walking around with?
