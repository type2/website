&gt;Before you get all excited, note that it also had European plates on it.

 Hi Rick
 A Few weeks ago when I was in Prince George B.C. at the dealer having some
service done I was talking with the parts manager and he was telling me that
they saw all sorts of strange (for here) combinations of VWs that come here
with German tourists (they get a lot of German tourists I am told). One
thing that he did mention was a Syncro EV camper that had driven in for
service that they were impressed with. Another interesting EV I saw was a
new EV  panel on their sales lot. You don't see them here.
