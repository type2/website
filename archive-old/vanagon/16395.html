&gt; My fiance and I are planning on taking our '90 Vanagon GL 
&gt; camping on our honeymoon and would like to have a little
&gt; privacy. So I was wondering how hard it would be to add 
&gt; curtains like so many other vanagons have? We don't have
&gt; any snap attachments on the inside. Will we have to add 
&gt; snaps? Could we use the existing black mushroom shaped things?
&gt; Or how about using velcro? Any suggestions would be helpful.

I assume you mean you don't have any curtain rods.  In that case, you
can just get some elastic rope and stretch it across the top and bottoms
of the windows, and secure the ends with screws and washers.  You
could also use thin aluminum slats as curtain rods - that's what my
camper has.  I was appalled at how much material costs.  I needed 10
yards (to make double-thickness curtains) to cover all of my windows.
The nice material was all between $8 - $20 a yard.  Forget that!!!
You might have to look around a while unless you are willing to pay
over $100 for curtain material.
