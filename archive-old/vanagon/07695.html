Subject: '81 Gas Tank Removal (long)

For those folks that didn't get their own, personally requested copy,
here's the poop.

First, a little about my experiences pulling VW gas tanks...

I've dropped the tank in my van no less than 7 times trying to find
and plug various leaks rather than shell out the $600!!! the dealer wants
for a new one or take a chance on a used one.  Hopefully you'll be able to
benefit from my experience/bullheadedness 8-).   One thing I would suggest
is that if your tank leaks it's because dirt, oil, grease, etc. have found
a home in the tunnel that runs the length of the tank.  Water finds this
the perfect place to reside while it slowly eats away the metal on the
top of your tank.  Once it's done it's business it's best to find a 
replacement since neither JB Weld or epoxy stemmed the leaks on my old one.
YMMV, tho.

Ok, here it is for those that are interested in it.

Before you actually go and try this out, I'd suggest that you read this
all the way through.  My stream of consciousness style of writing lends
itself more to abstract thought beforehand rather than instructions to
follow once you're under the van.  Just my $0.02 though since everyone
does things a little differently.

A couple of things about orientation here.  All directions are from the
drives seat facing forward.  So obviously, right is the passenger side,
front is the front of the van no matter which way _you're_ facing.
Just a quick clarification for those who haven't done this kind of thing
before.

Introduction
------------

Before we actually get started talking about how to remove the tank,
let's talk about what all goes to the tank and from where so we have
some common reference points.  

There is a thick (2&quot;?) metal tube that runs from the filler neck to the
side of the tank.  If you look inside the right side wheel well you can
see where it goes into the tank.  The tube fits into a rubber seal in
the side of the tank.  The tube itself fits into another rubber seal at
the filler neck.  The seal is held in place by 3 screws on the outside of
the filler neck and by a worm clamp on the tank side.

At the bottom/back side of the tank are two hoses.  One (on the right side)
feeds the fuel pump, while the other (on the left) is the fuel return from 
the engine.

On the top of the tank, at the front are three holes with sealing rubber 
rings.  Two of these (one on either side) fit into a plastic connector/hose
arrangement that runs to the two expansion tanks on either side.  The 3rd 
hole accepts the overflow pipe that connects to the side of the filler pipe,
which is located on the right side.

Also on the top of the tank are two other expansion tubes that are welded
to the top of the tank and have inlets/outlets inside the tank.

Somewhere in this maze of hoses is the charcoal cannister feed which then
terminates at the air filter.  For our purposes it's not important where it
begins or ends.

Getting Started
---------------

While the tank can be removed with the van level, I always support the front
on a pair of ramps.  If you don't have ramps, don't worry about about it, they
just make it easier to remove the beams.

To start with, make sure that you've run the gas level down as low as you 
can.  This will reduce the amount that will need to be drained from the tank
later.  Believe me, you want to remove this thing as empty as possible, since
every gallon left inside is another ~8 lbs. for you to maneuver around whilst
laying on your back.  The job can be hard enough without having to deal with
the extra weight.  Drain any left in the tank by removing the hose that leads
to the fuel pump on the right side.  Make sure that there is a catch basin,
gas can with a big funnel, etc. ready and waiting when you are.  Remove the
filler cap before removing the hose so that suction doesn't slow the drainage
process down.

On my 1981 Westfalia the tank is held to the body with two thick steel
straps that run longitudinally.  These are held to the body with two 13 mm
bolts.  Before you remove these though the filler pipe has to come out.  Remove
the filler cap and you'll see 3 phillips screw heads.  Loosen these
enough to be able to move things around without seperating the screws from
the metal backing plate.  There's a rubber seal in front of the backing plate
that has a worm or screw clamp around it.  Loosen this as well.  You can get to
it through the wheel well.  Undo the clamp that holds the hose that goes to
the overflow pipe and remove the hose.  

Use a big pipe wrench to twist the plastic housing that holds the filler neck.
It's made to fit into cutouts in the body and when twisted about 3 degrees will
come right out.  Then grab the filler pipe and twist it back and forth until 
it comes out of the seal in the side of the tank.  The plastic housing should
be gripped and twisted from _inside_ the wheel well so you don't tear up the
paint.

If you've left too much gas in the tank it's all going to come rushing out
the hole you've just made in the side of the tank, so make sure there's 
something there to catch the overflow.  I would strongly caution you against
having that much gas in the tank though.  There should only be the dregs you
can't get out by draining the tank first.

Place a support of some kind like a jack or jack stand underneath the back
of the tank to support it through these next maneuvers.  From the drivers side
wheel well you should be able to look up and see one of the expansion tanks.
This tank has two small hoses that snake their way towards the gas tank.  The
hoses are held on by compression clamps and are a bear to get off.  I've 
replaced the 4 clamps with worm clamps in case I have to do this again.  I'd 
suggest you do the same.  The clamps can be removed by holding the hose with
one set of pliers while &quot;wiggling&quot; the clamp off with another pair.  
Be careful when you do this so you don't accidentally break off the plastic 
fitting from the expansion tank.  Do the same thing on the other side.

Ok, you should have the 4 expansion tank hoses off.  Now comes the tricky part,
hohoho.  Not really, you just need eyes on the ends of your fingers since you'll
have to feel your way around the top of the tank.  Look through the wheel well
on the right side over the cross member that runs the length of the van.  See
the gap there between the member and the body?  That's where we're going next.
Reach through there and feel around on the top of the tank.  From the right
side you'll feel the overflow pipe where it fits into the tank and the hose
and fitting arrangement mentioned earlier.  They fit into two rubber seals in 
the top/front of the tank.  Pull them out, then go around and pull the one
fitting out of the left side.

If you can't get to them, can't find them, don't know what the hell I'm 
talking about, don't worry.  When you drop the tank, if you're careful they'll
pull out by themselves.  It's better to pull them out by hand first and take
less risk damaging the seals and fittings.  I've done it both ways and the 
seals are still good.

Now we're ready to drop the tank.  Get back under the van and make sure both
hoses at the back of the tank have been removed.  If you haven't removed the
return hose from the engine yet, do so now.  Make sure you have the catch
basin/whatever there to catch what's left in the hose, since there's sure to
be a little gas still trapped in there.  If you can, fab up a cap for the
two gas tank outlets, since there's going to be a little gas still trapped
in the tank that'll trickle out when you drop the tank.  A short piece of
gas line hose with a big screw in it to plug it off works just fine.

Undo the two 13 mm bolts, and twist the beams out of the way.  Be careful
when re-installing those beams that you get _both_ tangs back in place before
you put the bolts back in.  You'll see what I mean when you get them off.
With your feet forward and you on your back, support the tank with one hand
while you move your support out of the way with the other.  Gently lower the
tank towards you, feeling for hoses you may have missed, not gotten to.  Once
the hoses pull free, if you didn't get them earlier, support the front of 
the tank with your knees while you pull the tank towards you.  There's a
short shelf at the front lip of the tank that you have to pull the tank 
off before the tank will almost be free.

You should have a bouncing baby gas tank in your lap at this point.  Reach
across the top/left side of the tank and pull the connector to the sending 
unit free.  Slowly slide the tank off one hip until one corner rests on
the floor. Slide/sidle the tank sideways until you can get out from under it.
Pull it out the front of the van and go have a beer!  You've earned it!

The first time through is the hardest.  Take your time getting everything apart
and you should be ok. 

Putting it all BACK together
---------------------------- 

A couple of words of caution when it comes time to put everything back 
together.  Get the tank up on the front lip and supported at the back, then
get the respective hoses in their approximate locations. Then you can loosely
bolt the tank in place while you secure the hoses at the expansion tanks and
in the top of the gas tank.   

When you put the filler pipe back in, push it in a little farther than normal.
Put the filler neck assembly back into the body being careful that everything
is seated before twisting back in place.  Be sure to have the filler pipe and
the rubber seal approximately lined up before twisting the assembly in place
and tightening the screws to give you a little freeplay to work with.  Also,
make sure the worm clamp is in place before you insert the pipe into the seal
since there's no way it'll go in place otherwise.  It's a little tough to get
to, but if you work slowly you should be able to snug things up with no leaks.
