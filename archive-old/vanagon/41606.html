Subject: '62/3 Deluxe $300

Also for a friend:
'62 (or '63) hard top deluxe, probably a parts bus. The best thing about this
bus is that it has both rear corner windows in really good shape. Otherwise,
it's a pretty sad bus. body is rather rusty, and couple other windows are
broken.
It is a rolling chassis, with possibly good front and rear ends.
It is located in Raleigh NC, for details please call Sean at 919-834-2800
