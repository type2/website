&gt; &gt;pleas send me information on the vanagon 96.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, its kinda square, like a big box.  Has 4 wheels that go round and
&gt; round!  Just about every one I've ever seen was white.  It has a little
&gt; motor in the front that goes Vrooom!

Except that VW hasn't sold Vanagons in the US since '91, and they aren't
even selling a van this year.
