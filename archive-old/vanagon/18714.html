Yea. I'm still here.

There is nothing wrong with your speedo. All late model vanagon speedos that
I know of read way wrong. Like, when it says 75MPH you are really going 68
or something. They all do this. 

I had a project to find a way to add a correction to this once but I musta
put this in my &quot;Chores To Do By The Year 2,000&quot; file.

I put on tires that are 2&quot; taller than stock and it still didn't fix the
problem I still read significantly faster than I am actually going.
