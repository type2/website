Subject: '78 Camper FS in the bay area

I stopped in a 7-11 today to get a Mt. Dew fix, and one of the people in 
there started asking me questions about my bus.  Well, seems he has a '78 
he wants to sell.  He said he put a new engine, but he told me he only 
paid $700 for it.  He also said the camper stuff was in good shape.  He 
lives in Oakland and works in Hayward.  Here's his info if you want to 
contact him:
