Subject: Centerfold Spittie

     Ok, splittie spotters, IBM, the folks in the blue suits,
     has a new magazine ad as part of its Solutions for a Small
     Planet series.

     Its about an insurance firm. It includes a full
     color illustration of a safari windowed, psychedelic bus. Lowered
     a bit in front, and it looks like Porsche 356 Super hubcaps,
     but its still a splittie. Fellow in front of the vehicle is
     lying on the grass, guitar in hand, and a kind of far away look
     in the eyes ;-). The whole thing is solarized, for that extra
     groovy effect.

     Where did I see it? Get this, it is the centerfold, really, in the
     December 25/January 1 issue of Business Week. (Don't give me a
     hard time, we get it at the office.) Likely in other mags, too,
     whereever IBM adverstises.

     If you can't find a copy, you could tell webmaster_at_www.ibm_dot_com that
     you'd like to see it up on the net. Corporate responsiblity and all
     that.

     Tom F.
