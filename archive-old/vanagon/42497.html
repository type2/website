Subject: humming fridge?

Jumped in the 89' westy yesterday and noticed a slight humming sound coming
from the fridge/cabinet area.  Can't be certain it was fridge but what else
could it be?  The ignition was turned off, there is no spare battery to run
fridge.  Flipped the 3-way fridge switch several times, humming still there.
Any thoughts?
