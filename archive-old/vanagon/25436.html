	Friends,
	You'll recall my sweetie and I were doing body work on the
pickup together, and I had to share this with everyone since it made
me so happy. Well, now there's more.

	Jean and I went up to visit my dad and step-mother a couple 
of weeks ago. Having had a very nice evening together, I felt that I
had shown or told her everything she needed to know about me, and 
asked her to marry me after we had driven back to my house. Where I actually
proposed was kneeling in the walkway betweeen the two front seats of
my brother and sister-in-law's Vanagon, which I'd traded my car for earlier
that day to haul rain gutters. :)

	She said yes! She's looking forward to driving the pickup too!

	Really, I didn't plan it this way, but that's how it worked out.
I'd say its an auspicious beginning too.

	Cheers!
	Bill
