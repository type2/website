David,

Sorry to hear about the woes that thine Bus (pronounce it 
with a long u) is having.  I can understand how that 
would quell the urge to...  Well lots of urges.
Apologies about the tone of my original post but I had
visions of all these juicy discussions passing me by 
just like the cars do on the road. --Ralf
