My apologies to those who didn't care for my poltical &quot;ranting&quot;. It
wasn't my intent to offend. But, I was at the impression that Friday's
were open discussion days ... global topics related to our beloved VW's.
Here in California if you think that keeping your VW is an apolitical
process ... don't plan on keeping your VW (or other late model
vehicle) long!.
