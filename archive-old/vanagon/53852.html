Sounds like a bad sender to me.  At least that was my problem when my 
fuel guage began acting in a similar fashion.  Time to drop the fuel tank 
and have at it!

The problem, as I recall, is that the &quot;wiper&quot; action of the fuel guage 
sender eventually wipes off the resistive substrate (the sender is just a 
variable pot) giving the fluctuating readings.
