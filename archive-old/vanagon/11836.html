&gt; January 7, 1980 - February 17, 1995

That figures........
&gt; 
&gt; It is with much sadness that I announce the death of our recently
&gt; purchased Bug Convertible which was totaled out when struck by
&gt; a delivery truck travelling in the breakdown lane while the
&gt; driver was asleep.
&gt; 

I'm really saddened to read of your loss Ric.  But I'm really glad
that your wife was not hurt either.  It's one hell of a loss and
all you can do is go on.  I'm sure by the time you read this, your
already turning the gears in your head about the next purchase to
replace 'New Bug'.  I will take the moment of silence and raise
a glass to the beautiful convertible that went to VW heaven.

BTW, about the remark above.  Guess which date was my birthday? 

Take care,

Steven
