&gt; &gt; Some observations on fridge lighting...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	...I have given up on looking for the pilot light through the little
&gt; &gt; 	window in the fridge. I look for the green LED (below the water
&gt; &gt; 	level LEDs, has an * beside it) to begin to glow....

Personally, I find the pilot light useful only for diagnosing problems 
with the burner (flame should be blue and steady).  The LED is a much 
more practical indicator of status, and with a little practice can be a 
fairly useful diagnostic tool as well (the intensity of the LED is 
related burner output;  the higher the flame the brighter the light).
