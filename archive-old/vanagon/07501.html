Subject: Re: what is this device in my '72 Westy?

as stupid as this sounds, it sounds like you are describing an Eberspacher
gas heater. Noticeable characteristics of this beast are an exhaust pipe
down through the floor, and a metal tag w/ Eberspacher written on it. Are
you familiar w/ Eberspacher gas heaters? That green knob on your dashboard
w/ the white cross controls your gas heater. if you turn it, you will hear
this whirring sound that is the timer

&gt;In the engine compartment of my '72 Westy there is a ~2.5 ft long
&gt;black cylinder, 5&quot; in diamter, with German writing all over it. It is
&gt;in the upper left corner of the compartment, with what looks like an
&gt;exhaust pipe dropping down thru the bottom of the compartment; on the
&gt;back end is a white plastic cap with its own tube running up the side
&gt;of the vehicle somewhere; a few wires running off it also.
&gt;
&gt;A friend took a wild ass guess that it was for the outlet inside. If
&gt;not, how is 12V converted to [110v or 120v]?
&gt;
&gt;Please cc: to jeffs_at_almaden.ibm_dot_com please, otherwise I won't see the
&gt;answer until Monday - in digest mode.
