Shit!

Good start.... well, so far lots of shit has been stirred, but nothing yet accomplished! 
I need a good mechanic!!!!! I scream!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I heard of a mechanic at the VW-dealer in Gulfport, MS. Earl Case is the name! I have talked
to VWoA and they said to tow it there. Nobody has mentioned anything about the cost or repairs.
I just want the van fixed!!!!!!!!! Or is that too much to ask from VW engineering ?

Well, I will be towing the van there on Monday. Let's see what happens.

Shit!

Have you driven a FORD lately?
