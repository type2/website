&gt;well, see, i'm getting a little worried about my bus. the mpg has been going
&gt;UP for the last 16,000 miles. to such an extent that the AVERAGE for 86,000
&gt;miles has risen 0.2 mpg. now, to me, that's a lot (for the long term average)
&gt;.. and it worries me. for years, it plodded along at 19.4 average. now it's
&gt;creeped up to 19.6 and gives every indication of going to 19.7 this summer.
&gt;

Carbon deposits increasing your compression ratio, maybe???
