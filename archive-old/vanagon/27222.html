Subject: Re: OK, barndoor nuts! What's this?



     
&gt;      I found it yesterday in the Sierras.  It is definitely a barndoor, 
&gt;      very rust free (no thru the body rust holes) with all the parts there. 
&gt;       I couldn't get a look at the body number badge because of this mad 
&gt;      rotwiler that lives with it.  It has semiphors, bullet blinkers that 
&gt;      are inside and below center of the headlights, and the cutiest little 
&gt;      sewing machine in the rear, I'm sure it's original.  The popup is only 
&gt;      about 3 foot by 2 foot just over the side doors.  four windows per 
&gt;      side.  It looks like it had been sitting here for a while, at least a 
&gt;      couple of years or so.  It looks to be complete as far as camping 
&gt;      setup, but the wood does need work.
&gt;      
&gt;      Is it worth my persuing (like I don't know already)?
&gt;      
&gt;      Tell me quick before some wannabe comes by and gives him any price he 
&gt;      asks.
&gt;

Cecil,


	Without anymore info it must be between a 1952 -&gt; 1956 model.
     Can you get any more info?
