Subject: VW sponsors Stones

&gt;I've heard that VW is sponsoring the European leg of 
&gt;the Rolling  Stones' &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; world tour.  Most 
&gt;of the dates are next  summer, I believe.  &lt;crunch&gt;  &lt;yum&gt;

... and they are bringing out limited editions of the range 
with the Rolling Stones' lips moniker pasted on especially for 
the events.  If I remember correctly, one of the 'popular' 
newspapers insinuated that the company (should be in 
Upper-case, I know) will be manufacturing a totally new car 
called the 'Stonesmobile' or similar.  Of course, we all know 
that they're not and that the paper is confusing a Polo with 
the Concept-1 (due 1998.)

Thankfully, there are no plans for a Rolling Stones' 
Transporter.

I *hate* the Rolling Stones.  Blech.
