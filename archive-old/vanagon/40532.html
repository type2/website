Subject: RE: air cooled? : non van


this friend of mine took an &quot;auto fix it&quot; course, and the
instuctor guy told him that VW was the only car manufacture to
make air cooled autos...i said that porsche also made air cooled
engines but could not think of any others...are/were there any others?


Chevrolet made the air-cooled Corvair series of sedans, convertibles, and 
vans in the '60s. Any others?
