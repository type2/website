some further thoughts.....

prior to March 55' the roofline was flush w/ the windshield (i.e. minimal
ventilation). To facilitate more ventilation an optional (not sure if from
factory or aftermarket) small &quot;nose&quot; could be fitted up on the roofline,
and acted as a crude &quot;scoop&quot; to direct fresh air into the cabin. This scoop
would be situated directly above the bar between the two windows and was
approx. 1.5 ft. wide. There was a van in New York State that had this set
up and was for sale in the back of HVW's classified's a few issues ago.
More details please!

BTW... Lee Griffiths would probably be able to better comment on the sun
visor i was referrring to.

&gt;you'll probably get lots of responses to this one....
&gt;
&gt;basically what you saw is a VW Panel Van of a 56-67 vintage. Without more
&gt;deatails, it is difficult to pinpont the year. The &quot;visor&quot; over the
&gt;windshiels, is actually the air intakes. On the underside of the &quot;visor&quot;
&gt;there are two screened air intake vents, they ventilate the cabin and/or
&gt;the cargo area. If the van had a bench seat, there would be two extra air
&gt;vents, right uder the roofline at the back of the van. If the van is a
&gt;walk-thru, it would not have these two vents.
&gt;
&gt;Please note, an additional &quot;visor&quot; was available in England, that served to
&gt;deflect the sun. I haven't seen any of these over in N.America, but they
&gt;were/are popular in England.
&gt;
&gt;If you wanted to know what year the van it is or its' origin, take note of
&gt;such things as the front and rear taillights, exterior and interior door
&gt;handles, as well as whether or not the bumper had overriders or not.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Saw the greatest VW bus I've ever seen yesterday.  Don't know
&gt;&gt;too much about the older vans (earlier than mid '75's) so let
&gt;&gt;describe it and I'm sure someone on this list knows.
&gt;&gt;It was a split front window, no side windows, had some sort of
&gt;&gt;'visor' over the front window.  Also, it was painted battleship
&gt;&gt;grey and had AZ historical plates (# 78B9).  I know it's up to
&gt;&gt;the individual to say their car is historical and get those plates
&gt;&gt;but this bus deserved them!  I assume everyhring I saw was
&gt;&gt;original?  It was a clean bus.
