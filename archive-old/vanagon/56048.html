&gt;By the way, on page 97 they mention a 12 seater '84 Caravelle Carat, I have
&gt;never seen one, or could imagine the seating arangment.  Has anyone actually
&gt;seen one of these?

&gt;

I have a dealership brochure from the UK, and the interior layout is pictured
in there. 
It seems that the 12 pass. was exempt from the &quot;car tax&quot; in England, so
that's why the popularity in the UK.
