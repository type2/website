Subject: Gas Smell

&gt;concerns me alittle is the owner says that when the tank is full he can smell
&gt;gas. When the tank gets off of full it goes away.  He said that there was a
&gt;&quot;T&quot; fitting on top of the tank that needs repalcing. I am going through the
&gt;Bently book right now to see what I can see.  Any one have any Ideas on this??

Wasn't this one of the things on the recall list for Vanagons that was
posted last week?
