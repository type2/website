Look more closely.

&gt; Is there air flow here that is not obvious? 

Yes.

&gt; Does the air flow to the oil cooler actually decrease at high temp?
&gt; This is really bugging me. Somebody straighten me out please!

The left flap is sort of hinged in the middle, if I remember.  When
closed, it shuts off most of the air to the cylinders and oil cooler.
When warm, it divvies up the air between the cylinders and the oil
cooler by &quot;slicing&quot; the incoming air into two separate streams.  The
obvious one goes to the cylinders, and the less obvious one (underneath)
goes to the oil cooler.
