Subject: Neat Map Site on the WWW

Dear vanagoniacs,

I am visiting Orlando next week to go on a job interview and have been 
searching the WWW, looking for Orlado information, especially good
quality maps.  I discovered a site that provides an interactive atlas
of the continental USA.  It is

	http://www.mapquest_dot_com

It appears to be detailed down to the street level, although it
contained a mistake within a block of my home, I suspect it is
normally accurate.

Since I brought the subject up of visisting Orlando, I'd like to ask
any listmembers that live in the Central Florida area to email me with
any suggestions about life there.  I'd like to locate near VW friendly
FLAPS, for example.  I have problems here in Missouri with the local
city codes, as it pertains to storage of spare VW parts, so I plan to
study local codes before deciding on whether to settle in a particular
municipality or not.

The Bob Hoover Sermon web pages will remain at their current address,

	http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/

even if I move, for a while.

TIA,
Richard Kurtz
