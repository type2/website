Subject: noisy wasserboxer valves, what to do?


Over the weekend I did a 200 mile road trip and since then the 
valves have been rather noisy. I've had valve clatter before
and this sounds different. I also notice that some oil or coolant
or both had dripped onto some cardboard that I have on the garage
floor. This wasn't the normal couple of coolant drips that I have 
with the wasserboxer, more like something leaked an 1/8 or 1/4 cup 
of fluid. My oil level is the same as before the trip and the 
coolant level is a little lower. The stain on the cardboard was 
towards the right side head. As I type this it sounds like the head 
gasket leaked after the long drive, but would that cause the valve 
clatter? I've also noticed a slight decrease in performance.

TIA,
