Subject: FS: My 86 Syncro GL Daily Driver

Hi All,

I need to sell my 86 Syncro GL.  It has been my daily driver 
since January.  I can deliver it to Buses by the Arch near St. 
Louis Labor Day weekend or a Denver delivery is also possible the
first week of September.  If you'd rather pick it up, I'm in 
the Kansas City Area.  $5200 obo.  My wife thinks 13 VWs are 
too many!  This is a very nicest VW I have ever owned.

* Blue/blue with fold down back seat. 105k miles.
* 2nd owner, no dents.  Has diff differential lock.
* New heads &amp; gaskets &amp; radiator at 90k
* New rotors _at_ 80k
* New 1/3 exhaust _at_ 98k 
* New muffler _at_ 94k
* New 6 ply Michelins _at_ 102k

No alloys, pwr mirrors or locks, or rear wiper.
A/C needs charging.  Very small amount of seam rust.
