Subject: Transmission rebuild


Here's the story:

Newly bought 1979 Westfalia with a bad main bearing in the 
transmission (manual, not automatic).  Local (San Luis Obispo, CA) VW 
mechanic estimates $800 for a rebuild job.  I think this is very high.
Any option?  I was told that it didn't have to be rebuilt for a
 while-- the noise is not very bad right now, but the mechanic 
said it would get much worse. 

I am not very experienced working on VW's.  Is it a good idea for me 
to buy a manual, a rebuilt tranny, and go for it?

Anybody know of a place that will do a rebuild for cheaper in the Los 
Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange County area anywhere?

Any and all suggestions and comments are appreciated.

TIA,

Matt Lamar

P.S.  Update the statz!  I am no longer a wanabusser.  1979 Westfalia.
