Add another to the list of dissatisfied dealing with VWoA... my experience was 
not good with VWoA either.  In fact, it was looking good for awhile when the 
service rep said thay VWoA may chose to buy the vanagon back from me, but then 
apparently the local &quot;god&quot; aka - regional rep said otherwise, VWoA changed 
their tune, too.  They said that the regional rep had the final word.  I 
couldn't believe this!

My experience with VW America has not been a &quot;joy&quot; either...
