Subject: made it to New Jersey!

That's right, folks! The newly rebuilt engine ran (almost--see below)
flawlessly all the way from Missouri to New Jersey, a 20 hour trip. In
fact, I drove long stretches at 70-75 mph, while head temperature stayed
at a steady 350 F. Well, the 15mph tailwind probably had something to do
with that. 

About the &quot;almost&quot;: every couple of hours or so, the engine misses a few
beats and &quot;bucks&quot; (is that a word?), as if the fuel injection went on
strike. Actually stalled at a turnpike booth and had to push the bus out
of the way. Wiggled the F.I. harness a bit and that always fixed the
problem for the next 100 miles. As an experiment, I wiggled the same
harness while the engine was running, and sure enough, it stalled.
Tonight, I removed the harness from the bus and made continuity checks
with the ohm-meter; couldn't find anything wrong. Perhaps there was a bad
contact at one of the multi-prong connectors (MPC?). If anyone has *any*
suggestion as to how to fix this, I would be most appreciative. For
example, is there some kind of spray to improve electric contact? WD40?
