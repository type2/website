&gt;you will all please note that there is a SECOND bus in alabama &gt;now! :)

Interesting !! Verry interesting !! I live in NJ an know of so many other
1976,77,78, &amp; 80 - 84 Campers and or Busses around here. At times I wonder
why we all don't know one another, mostly young kids ! Maybe thats why ?
