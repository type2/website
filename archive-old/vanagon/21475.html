Subject: Re: curious about campers

&gt;I've been wondering about changing my 79 bus into a camper.  I have
&gt;access to a Westfalia pop-top, so I'm on the way there.  Did campers
&gt;roll off the assembly line at Wolfsburg or did busses get shipped to
&gt;Westfalia(a company??) to be changed to campers.  If they were shipped
&gt;to Westfalia, it seems that all they did was cut out part of the 
&gt;roof, install the top, seal it, and install the refrig and sink.

As far as I know, the buses were sunroof kombis without interiors (or 
sunroofs for that matter), which went to the Westfalia factory to be fitted 
with the camping gear. The pop-top just fits over the sunroof hole so no 
cutting or reinforcing was needed. BTW, I've fitted a couple of pop-tops so 
mail me if you want any help.
And, just to be a smart-alec, the bus production line wasn't in Wolfsburg :)
