Subject: Re: alcohol burner question

&gt;Does anyone know much about alcohol burners?  Do they
&gt;produce as much condensation/moisture as propane?  What
&gt;about their consumption of oxygen?  Do they produce
&gt;as a byproduct of their combustion CO, the way that propane
&gt;does?  Therefore recommended to be ducted/vented?  Pros?  Cons?  

Sailboats use alcohol stoves etc, alcohol isn't cheap/always available. My 
preference for carrying volatile flammable heating fluids is kerosene 
(actually cheap brandy is great but no one else gets warm). Kerosene heaters 
are available in many sizes/shapes/powers. I use a large unit 24&quot;W X 20&quot;H X 
10&quot;D to take the chill off our cottage when skiing. The unit has a large 
round wick and a round stainless steel grid, all inside a glass chimney. The 
grid gets red hot, vapourizes the kero off the wick and it burns smoke free. 
Still smells, as will your flannels days later. Rated for indoor use, WITH A 
WINDOW OPEN 1/2&quot; or so. 
        A friend of mine had a similiar unit tied into the back of his '73. 
It worked well, except that the automatic tip-over shut-off  would work if 
he cornered or hit the brakes hard. I don't recommend driving with one 
personally. I currently have a small Coleman propane catalytic heater, 10&quot;W 
x 8&quot;D X 16&quot;H which really puts out the heat, supposed to run 17 hrs. on low 
setting, which is ample in the van(agon). Cost $30 in a second hand store. 
Windows run with condensation, or freeze up when the heats out.
        I won't sleep with any form of heat on except thermostat controlled 
electric fan. In fall hunting season we get several deaths annually where 
Bubba was heating an old travel trailer out in the woods with A) 
propane/kerosene/BBQ briquettes/Sterno, burned in a B) 
stove/furnace/bucket/grill and died from C) CO 
poisoning/flames/explosion/inhalation, (pick one from column A, one from 
column B, etc.)
        No matter what you burn, it'll produce water vapour, at the very 
least, plus CO, CO2 etc. What's the heat for? personal warmth? brandy and a 
down sleeping bag are very energy efficient, try a Coleman propane lantern, 
since they kick out lots of heat, and keep the pop-top shut, brrrr..
