Subject: J-Tubes  or heater boxes?

List people,
   While the engine is out, I am thinking of replacing my deteriorated 
heater boxes with j-tubes.   It's Alabama, and I can just wear heavy 
clothes and a blanket for the two cold months we like to call &quot;winter&quot;. 
I'd rather spend the bucks on one of the other zillion things I have on 
my fix-it list than on expensive and seldom-needed heater boxes.

Here's my question:
  Will J-tubes cause any cooling problems?  It seems that the tin fits 
semi-snugly against the ol' heater boxes, helping direct fan-blown air 
over the cylinders.  Are there any other concerns related to the use of 
J-Tubes?

Sagely advice welcome!  (half-baked opinions, too)
