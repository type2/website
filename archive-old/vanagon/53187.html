Subject: Thanks for poltergeist response
Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 16:31:32 -0700

Thanks! to all of you who so generously took the time to respond to my =
first ever posting (87 Syncro Westy poltergeist).  I copied and pasted =
the bulk of the responses into a document and faxed all nine pages to =
the service manager (Klaus :) at the dealership working on the van.  He =
was genuinely appreciative and admitted that he had exhausted Volkswagen =
as a resource.  For the record, the dealership (B. A. Wackerli in Idaho =
Falls, Idaho) has been great.  Even though I bought the van &quot;as is&quot; the =
dealership made no attempt to avoid responsibility for fixing this =
problem and hasn't charged me a dime.  They've made me feel just as =
significant as if I'd purchased a new $50k Audi.  Finally, I want to say =
how gratifying it is to find a cyber-community such as this.  In the =
future I hope I can be a &quot;leaver&quot; and not just a &quot;taker&quot;.  If the =
dealership gives up, I at least know the problem can be found and fixed =
and I'll do it myself.  Regardless, I'll post the outcome when it comes =
out.  Thanks again!

Bob Stevens
