So Mike White says:
&gt; nut off of the edge of the sump hole, and I DON'T want to push it 
&gt; back into the engine, so I use that silly 10mm to gingerly work it 
&gt; out.

That's why you need one of those magnet tools.

&gt; to put it back together.  Getting that nut back on should be the 
&gt; funnest thing this side of my dentist visit yesterday!

You need a longer stud and two nuts.  One being a lock nut.  Put 
the non-locknut on first using a piece of sewing thread looped 
through it.  This way if you lose it before you get it on, you
can fish it out.  After you get the first nut on, put on the locking
nut over it using the thread as before.  It's easier with 2 10mm
box end wrenches.

&gt; BTW, I've been a Pennzoil SAE 30 man since the day I bought the bus, 
&gt; and yesterday all my parts place had was Castrol 30.  I bought it.  I 
&gt; still feel uneasy about it.  My only experience with another brand 
&gt; oil was the fiasco with Valvoline Synthetic.  ACK.   Anyone else out 
&gt; there running Castrol?  Good?  Bad?  Ugly?

I use Castrol 20w-50 exclusively in the late spring, summer and early fall.
I prefer the extra protection during the hot months.  I use any cheap brand 
20W-50 Kmart or Walmart or whoever has for sell during the cooler months.  
Haven't had any trouble for 78K miles.

I know Dennis H. is gonna have something to say about this...... :)
