Subject: '81 air-conditioning Q


On my '81 air-cooled westy, I have a stock VW air-conditiong unit,
mounted in the stock location, above the rear seat.  Since the condenser
is in the same location, when I run the AC, drops of water
form and drip down over top of whatever I have stored there
right behind the rear passenger seat.  Does anyone else have this
problem and if so, anyway to minimize it?
