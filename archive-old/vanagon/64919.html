&lt;&lt; I have never been able to find an easy to install upgrade to the Vanagon
 brakes.  The calipers will not accommodate the extra thickness of a
 ventilated rotor.  You could cross drill the rotor, but I don't know if
 that would help.
  &gt;&gt;


on the same note - does anybody know if the 4 wheel disc brake setup w/
vented rotors and such off a Audi turbo would fit the vanagon??
the lug pattern is the same....
??
V-gon w/ 4 wheel disc brakes...  hmmm...  :&lt;)
