&gt;Does anyone know of the recipe for diesel #1.  My wife, actually  asked it

i recall something from long ago about tripping down to mexico in a diesel
vanagon ... and the fellow ran out of fuel with no diesel pumps around.
so he mixed up gasoline with 30w motor oil (it was 4:1, but i can't remember
which was 4 and which was 1!!) and it got him back to the states.

&gt;Also, if anyone has great knowledge about diesel in general (the fuel)
&gt;i would like to know what type of process produces diesel.  What makes
&gt;diesel ultimately cheaper than gasoline?

as i understand it, diesel #1 is much closer to kerosine than is diesel #2.
which is why the 18 wheelers smell funny in the winter time. #1 doesn't
have the 'waxing' problems that #2 does in very cold temperatures.

the best place to find all this out would be at some local big truck stop.
get a cb radio and listen/talk to the truckers. maybe go up and ask the
folks at the fuel desk (but be prepared for the possibility that there's
only a Bubba behind the desk! lots of dummies work around those places.)
