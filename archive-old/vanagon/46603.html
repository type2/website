Subject: Polutions Producers: '64 Rambler Classic



I have been interested in the thread about older cars polluting more than new 
cars with catalytic converters and such.  It springs to mind that the general 
claim is that if you buy a brand new car is will produce 97% less emissions 
than a car bought new 30 years ago.

It seems to me that the NZ Saab commercial is a bit too good to be true.  
That said, there were reports on American news a year or so ago about some 
type of experimental filter being developed in smog-choked Los Angeles which 
straps onto the radiator and somehow cleans the air as it passes through.  I 
don't think that this filter is dealing with the pollution produced by the 
actual car it's attached to, but rather it just takes care of the excess 
ambient pollution.  Anyone know about this development?  Is it just a bunch 
of hyperbole, this the talk years ago about Indianapolis getting it's very 
own major league baseball team.  (Geez!  How they play with your mind 
sometimes!)

WARNING:  NON-VW CONTENT FOLLOWS!
I'm going to pick up a '64 Rambler Classic on Saturday that I bought last 
night - she's a real beaut: 72,000 miles on a striaght 6, original *perfect* 
interior (seats covered with these thick plastic slipcovers), everything 
works beautifullly, only *one* tiny rust spot on the room where it looks like 
something chipped the paint - it's about the size of a dime.  All for the 
incredible price of $900 from an estate.

Anybody know of a listserv dealing with Ramblers/AMC?  Specifically, I'm 
looking about info. on whether I AMC used Ford and GM components on their 
engine - the distributor is that suspicious Ford blue, and the starter 
reminds me of an early Nova started.  I did a couple of searches on Yahoo and 
Excite, but was only able to locate a Rambler club *without* a website.  
Thanks for any help.

Thanks,
Justin
