Subject:      Eurovan Camper

I am looking for some leads on Eurovan camper.  Did Westphalia make a
full scale camper out of the Eurovan (with pop up roof)?  Is it
available for the 5cyl Audi on a long wheel base?  I am in the market
to buy one, recent vintage, but used, in Europe when I return from my
assignment in the Persian Gulf.  Any leads would be appreciated.
