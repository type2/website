Subject: Supid Westy question

Okay, I'm slowly getting around to putting my '71 Campmobile back together
and completing its restoration.  I've come to the point of reinstalling the
seat belts and have a question about the rear ones.  My front belts have the
little roller thing in the lap portion to wind them up.  Are the three rear
belts &quot;supposed&quot; to have them, too?  (Rear facing seat and the two for the
bed seat.)  I've got some with, some without.  Could someone with another
'71 Westy check and let me know?  Also, for the belts for the bed seat, what
order do they go?  Ie, are the two short belts with the release button both
in the middle, both on the left, etc.?  I realize this is kind of trivial but I
haven't been able to find a picture in any of my manuals and I'd like it to
be &quot;right&quot;.  Thanks!
