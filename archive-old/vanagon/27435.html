Subject: RE: HIGHWAY SPEEDS

Like all problems, this one goes away if you throw money at it.  Some months
ago I scanned into the list an article about putting an early Porsche
transaxle in a breadloaf.  And MSDS, in addition to their 6-cylinder conver-
sion kit, has adapters and instructions to put in a G-50 (late Porsche)
transaxle.  Fourth gear on a stock Vgon is between 3rd and 4th on most Porsche
transmissions.

You can get a few percent lower revs/mile by putting on 80-series tires on
15 inch wheels.  This is a change I'm alert to (eg watching the parts ads for
cheap Mercedes 15 inch rims).  In the meanwhile, I find solace in the fact
that at 70mph and 4000rpm I'm in the meat of the Porsche engine's power curve
and the wind noise is louder than the engine so who needs 5th gear anyway.
