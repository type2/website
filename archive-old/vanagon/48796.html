Subject: Syncro Crewcab FS

Haven't been on the list in a while---don't know if anybody posted this thang
from my hometown of Laguna Beach, CA.  It's an '86 w/60k, looks repainted.
 Owner is a Teutonic sort named Max, who runs this little lot that rents and
sells Westies, phone # is (714) 494-8645.  Guy probably wants big $.  I drive
by it all the time, been FS at least 2-3 months.  Other than that, I know
nothing.  

Regards, Matt Q.
