&gt; I have a request to make if a second batch of list stickers are to be =
&gt; made. Can they be made with a white as opposed to chrome background?
&gt;
&gt; Two reasons:
&gt;
&gt; 1. If the sticker is supposed to look like one of those &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; =
&gt; country identifier sticker...then they all have white background..
&gt;
&gt; 2. The MAIN reason......I have had a couple of opportunities to follow =
&gt; my EV while my wife was driving it. Once during the late afternoon, and =
&gt; later that evening. Both occasions when either the sun hit the sticker, =
&gt; or my headlights, the sticker basically reflected the light and washed =
&gt; out.
&gt;
I selected the chrome background for specific reasons as well. Mainly, as (to
me) one of the main reasons for having the stickers was to be able to easily
identify fellow listmembers, I felt it should be easily noticable. The chrome
is much flashier than plain old white. The shape of the blinding silver flash
will be enough for those in the know to recognize a fellow bus. For those who
don't realize what it is, they would probably not notice it on the fly anyway,
so whether or not it is reflecting light or not doesn't matter to them.  As to
the fact that most (NOT all) country stickers are white, I am well aware of
that. Most country stickers don't have that country's e-mail address on them
either.
:)
My purpose was not to create an imitation country sticker, so that people would
say &quot;Duh, what country is VW???&quot; but rather to use that concept as a starting
point for the design. Anyway, yes I am a bit defensive and taking it way too
personally I'm sure, but hey, you know how those crazy bus drivers are...
