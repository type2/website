Jim,

I've been thinking of installing one of these Amsoil sub-micron oil filters, and
use synthetic oil. I have heard good reports about their use.   Do you know
where I can get the installation kit to fit my 2.1L engine?  As I understand it,
the spin on filter remains, and I understand there is a spin-on filter which
Amsoil makes, which filters down to 1 micron.  Sounds good for my rebuilt
engine, to get the dirt out.

Thanks,

Charles
