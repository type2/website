Subject: Vanagon diesel

Does the Vanagon diesel have an inline-4 engine ala the VW Rabbit? I guess 
these were really slow compared to the gasoline versions. Would anyone 
recommend against owning one of these. I'm interested in any technical info 
and personal experience anybody has concerning Vanagon diesels.

				Thanks Justin Shepard


PS: What years were these produced for U.S. consumption?  Are parts for these 
readily available and are they extremely expensive compared to the gasoline 
versions?   Thanks again!
