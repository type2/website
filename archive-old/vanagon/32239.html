    The new speed limits out here in California have proven to be
    a mixed blessing; while its nice to be able to go faster, yada yada
    yada, it has significantly eroded my margin of comfort on
    the freeways.  I live in the right lane, but occassionally I
    could slideover a lane or two as the need arose, because I had
    the 15mph reserve to do so.  Now I have to use that 15mph 
    &quot;reserve&quot; just to keep up!  I hear they're renaming the right
    hand lane the &quot;Thom&quot; lane...  Anyone else having similar problems?

I'm just about ready to get off highways
anyway.  I simply do not want to go fast
(a good thing, considering), and the hot
shots are now so fast that I'm beginning
to wonder if my greatest danger is ahead
or behind.
