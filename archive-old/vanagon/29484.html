Subject: PC Hog Rings

Gee, you never know when this list is going to take an interesting turn! 

I skipped the Hog Ring thread, thinking it had something to do with
pistons and cylinder clearance (not a relevant issue yet on Da Stud
Bucket), and then I skipped the PC Stuff thread, thinking *that* was
just the same old flame war between the Mac 'noids and Wintel cabal
(again, irrelevant to me on my SGI Indy). 

Boy I'm *so* glad that I was desperate enough for Vanagon content that I
took a look back through all these posts... ;-)
