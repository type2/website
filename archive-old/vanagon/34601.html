Subject: Re: Syncro Driveshaft Shot!


&gt; Anybody know if the U-joint is really a replaceable and available part,
&gt; and if there's an OEM equivalent?  Alternatively, has anybody out there
&gt; who has replaced their driveshaft know the part number and/or cost of a
&gt; new one?  (Or got the old one still hanging around with a U-joint left
&gt; on it ;-) ?  No doubt these are hard-to-find items at *any* price.
&gt; 
&gt; Larry thanks you in advance...

Derek Drew posted an add he saw in one of the VW rags for Vanagon
U-Joints. I don't have the in front of me so check the archives. If
I get a chance, I'll check the fische tonight and track down the 
part number.
