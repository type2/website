&gt; ???????????    Are you both sure about this?  Don't like scouring
&gt; windshields and Bon Ami is scouring powder I thought.  Tried Windex? Works
&gt; fine for me. Spray it on thick and rub/wipe thoroughly, lifts grease film
&gt; fine.  Do the inside too!   Tim

    Hey Tim,

    I have used it for years. I have bought wiper blades, maybe
    4 times in my 21 years of car ownership.  I learned about it,
    (as a matter of fact) when I was cleaning the windshield with
    Windex, and was told not to use it. I was told that it has a 
    pollish in it, that make the blades work poorly!!!!
