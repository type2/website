So REP_at_icbr.ifas.ufl_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; OK, being among the poorer recipients of this list I feel OK in 
&gt; suggesting this.  There are about 300 of us right?  I say we find out who 
&gt; the poor Vanagon owner is(was) and all send him $10.  That should put him 
&gt; in at least a mid to late 80's Van.  C'mon.  I spent that much yesterday 
&gt; on doo-hickies and thing-a-ma-jigs.  Can someone find out who the van 
&gt; owner was?  
&gt; It would be such a gooooooood thing to do.

Ummm..... I believe that is what insurance is for...  :)
