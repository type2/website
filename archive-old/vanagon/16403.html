...(SNIP)

&gt;As far as I know, premium
&gt;(ie high octane) fuels are seldom required except in antique
&gt;detroit '70's iron and really old carboned up or modified
&gt;engines.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else care to comment on this?

The great thing about being on a growing listserv is that you get to tell
all your war stories over and over and over again. What great &quot;old man&quot;
training.

:-)

My brand spanking new 92 Toyota truck was supposed to run on regular, but
even under perfect tune, it would knock like crazy. I hear they were all
that way.

It ran great on premium, so that's what I used and didn't think much more
about it.

My '87 Syncro has never shown any signs of detonation, so I use regular.

I have been told that using premium is a good idea for air cooleds, as
their more extreme temperature variations can induce destructive periods of
intermittent, relatively undetectable detonation.
