We installed our dual sender when the tin was removed. We actually had to
cut some of the tin away, and I would think you would have to do the same
if you want to get around the distributor. Since the sender is at least
three times the diamter of the old one it will have to be quite a big
hole and go in at a slight angle. If you feel confident r/r the
distributor makes it easier. -- Use high temp silicone to to fill in any
gaps...As Joel says it goes in quite a bit at least 10 turns or more.

As far as gauge placement goes - buy the gauge brackets which can be mounted
into the underside of the dash (with two sheet screws). IMHO the best place is
out the way by the right knee just tucked to the right of  the steering
wheel bracket. This necessitates the occasionally glance over the wheel
(or a mirror) to see both directly, but the alternative is to place it in
the dash itself which is more work. Since I generally lean on the wheel
anyway its not a problems.

 For feeding wires the best way is to
trace the fuel line out the back and then feed the wiring through the gas
tank area with a coat hanger (twisting the wire together and using
electrical tape and plastic &quot;twist ties&quot; helps. Feed the line right to the
front of the van and up through the same grommet that feeds the brake line
(there are also lines coming through). This is easier to do with the
spare and grille removed. The  wire will come up right by the 
heater outlet and hidden from view. Its an easy hookup to the gauge from
there. Taking a light source from behind the dash can work, but be careful
that you use low resistance wire as you could damage the printed circuit.
Simply tap into one of the bulbs by twisting the wire and bulb in  at the
same time. As for your 12 volt source you could tap into your lighter if you
don't use it much - Good luck - DC
