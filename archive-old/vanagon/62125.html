Subject: Smogging

My 84 Water-cooled vanagon will not pass the smog check.  I told my mechanic
to just &quot;fix it&quot; and he can't.  He put the engine in a little over a year
ago.  When the time came to get the smog cert, it wouldn't pass.  The shop
told me they knew that was going to happen.  I was told that when the van is
brought into specs, it idles rough and dies.  Finally, they told me to leave
the van with them and they'd get it smogged, but to not ask any questions.  I
did, and they did.  Now my van has always run great with this engine (1.9).
 I don't like doing anything deceitful, but I also want to be able to drive
my van.  I have trouble not believing my mechanics, because I've told them
I'm willing to pay to get it fixed.  The mechanics told me that some engines
just don't pass the smog requirements.  Other than this problem, my mechanics
have been wonderful, gone beyond the call of duty when I've had a problem,
and my van is in great shape.  Any ideas about what's going on?  I appreciate
any help you can give me.  You should know that I really rely on my mechanics
and that I want to pass the information you give me over to them to solve the
problem.   THANKS!
