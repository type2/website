Subject: Pre '71 bus wheels(Seattle)

Hi I'm Jon Ulrigg,

Haven't been on the list for a year or two, and am in need of help.

I am looking for a set of wheels(or even just one) for a '70 transporter.

I checked a couple wrecking yards in the Seattle area, and can't find 
what I'm looking for.  Anyone in the area have a large bolt patter wheel 
they aren't in need of???

I just put new tires on, and this one wheel leaks(it did with the old 
tire as well).

In addition, I have an interior for a transporter (the two bench seats) 
that is just gatherin dust if anyone is interested.  I restored a 
Westfalia interior for my bus, so have the old one that is in good condition.

No reasonable offer refused. =)

Muchos Danke

Jon Ulrigg
