Happens to me too ('88 Westy w/ key locked filler cap).

Every time I filler-up there's gas on the ground and sometimes when I park
there's a gas odor. However I've checked the tank neck and can't see or
smell any cracks or leaks.

&gt;&gt; Being a new owner of 85 Westy, I'm surprised that every time
&gt;&gt; I fill it with fuel it overflows out the filler tube onto the ground.

&gt;I get this as well. I also would like to know if it is normal, or whether
I
&gt;have a leak in the filler neck or something.

Also happens to me in my 84 Westy and I just had the whole tank-filler
assembly replaced...so I'm thinking it's normal...I hope.
