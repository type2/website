&gt; batteries WILL definitely explode, under the right conditions. i know of
&gt; two folks who barely escaped loosing their eyesight when this happened.
&gt; luckily, the worst damage was acid burns on their clothing and on the car
&gt; paint.
&gt; 
&gt; as i understand it, the most hydrogen gas is generated after you really
&gt; crank on it a while ... so BEFORE you attach the jumper cables, wait a
&gt; while and let the gas bleed off.  other folks i know always put a rag over
&gt; the top of the battery ... i've never quite understood the reasoning behind
&gt; this, but they always do it 'to prevent explosions'.  (all the hydrogen gas
&gt; that i ever knew would go right through a rag).
&gt; 
&gt; it is a tribute to the makers of the batteries in general that MORE of them
&gt; don't explode ... considering how batteries are treated by the 'mechanics'
&gt; and grease-monkies at auto-service businesses. and owner-drivers. :)

You are right about that Joel, but in the case of my
exploding/melting/burning CANADIAN TIRE  battery, it simply was not
charging properly. It may have been a faulty regulator. The regulator may
have caused the battery to be overcharged at highway speeds----- DC If
batterires are prone to explosion and gas leakage how did VW get away with
putting them in the bug? DC
