So Tom Forhan says:
&gt; I called the number Ron suggested. Though the rep was very
&gt; knowlegable, he knew nothing about a Carver P4 or anything like
&gt; it. We did talk about Propex, this outfit carries in stock a larger
&gt; Propex line, the Propex X-1, 17x10x5&quot;, available in 1600(5200BTU) and
&gt; 2600(8000BTU) models. Cost is 589.26 and 721.00 respectively. 
&gt;                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wow!  And it also looks like they don't hesitate to pass the cost of
shipping on to the consumer at all.  :o
