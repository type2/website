Subject: 	RE: 87: follow up on leaking head

&gt;Actually, we are talking about replacing the nut aren't we? The bolt is a 
&gt;stud with a cap nut, at least in the drawings in Bentley. From what I can 

clean stud thread, nut threads spotface on head where nut presses and face 
of nut. Apply goop to stud thread and spotface, som into nut threads, then 
tighten.  You need to seal leaks along the threads AND under nut.  Tim
