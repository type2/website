The Arizona Childrens Burn Camp is the charity which benefit from all of the
raffles and auctions at next weekend's Jerome Jamboree VI.

The Arizona Childrens Burn Camp held a benefit banquet/auction/raffle this
past Friday, 12 September 1997. Several memebers of the Arizona Bus Club
attended the banquet and watched all of the big monied folks bid on various
items.
To my surprise, the club ended up being the winning bidder on a &quot;Petting Zoo
for a day.&quot; Imagine if you will a room full of the upper crust residents
named &quot;Biff Retent III&quot; dressed professionally all with thier surgically
enhanced trophy wives and three tables of Merry Pranksters dressed in tie
dyed VW T-shirts bidding on barn yard animals. hahahahahaha. Being a family
oriented club we some how figured the zoo would be fun for the kiddies...
Negotiations are still going on but we all are trying to get the owner of
the pot bellied pigs, pygmy ponies, and mini deer to drag them up to Jerome!
The owner was freaking out at the prospect of bringing animals to an event
populated with &quot;VW Freaks&quot; wearing tie dye clothing and bartering over
ancient scrap metal. I'm sure that she thinks that someone will slip the
pigs some tainted Kool-aid or something... &quot;I will bring the apple for the
mouth if you bring your pig.&quot; wouldn't have been a good negotiating line...
;-) All I can say is that this is going to be a fun weekend.
