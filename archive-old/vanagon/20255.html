Subject: engine swap heat

I have a few questions involving the Porsche engine swap kits for Vanagons.
First, has anyone tried them and if so how complete and/or easy are they?
Second, considering that Porsche engines are air-cooled and I assume the 
 vehicle's heat comes from that air, how would one heat a formerly wasser
 cooled Vgon with a Porsche engine in it? 
Third, same question (almost) about A/C, namely, use Porsche A/C or Vanagon? 

Thanks Brett Campbell cad00u_at_bacchus.eng.temple_dot_edu
