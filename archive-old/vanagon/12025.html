Subject:       '85, '86 GTI GOLF and JETTA manual

I have the Bentley manual for the above subjects.  Since this is
from a previous love affair, I have no need for it (those nagging
tokens of passions remembered) and would like it to go to a
worthy home.  If someone has a vanagon type article to trade, all
the sweeter.

email me private as this would bore the socks off people on the list.
