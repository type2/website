Subject:       Fram Oil filters

I just searched the gopher archives and couldn'y see a thread on these 
but SURELY it has been discussed.  If I could be (gently) directed to 
the thread I'd appreciate more reading on this.  Anyway, I'll blabber on with my 
story.

I just dropped my van off at the dealer this a.m. for its annual crankshaft oil 
seal change (another story).  I asked the service manager what the pretty red '92 
vanagon was in for (I parked next to it, felt kinda like an older man 
with a younger, beautiful woman).  He said it came in with a 
complaint of a flickering oil light at idle, 52,000 miles on van.  
They put a guage on and indeed it was low.  They were just about to 
start by putting an oil pump in it when they noticed the Fram filter. 
 They changed to a Volkswagen one and immediately gained 5 psi at hot 
idle and 10 psi at highway rpm.  Now this could be due to just an old 
vs new filter or is this a typical experience with Frams?  My oil 
light flickers at idle and I will be changing to a VW filter to try 
this out!
