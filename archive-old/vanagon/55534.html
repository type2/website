&gt;Some loose items that I would like to address:
&gt;2)The best driving experience I've had so far has been a trip from Santa
&gt;Cruz, CA. to Buenos Aires, Argentina (where I am originally from). Me
&gt;and 5 others travelled in a '75 Dodge Van along the Pacific coast for 6
&gt;months, and I could talk about the trip for ever... Anyway, an idea I
&gt;always keep alive is to do the same with a VW. I always thought-and
&gt;still do-that the best VW for this would be an aircooled pre-vanagon
&gt;bus. You can find parts for these almost anywhere in Latin America.
&gt;However, being in love with my '91 Westie made me wonder how would it be
&gt;to do the trip with one of these later beasts. Any comments, questions
&gt;or similar experiences?

&gt;4)As a result of the mentioned running board, the ex-owner took the mud
&gt;flap that goes behind the front/passenger tire. Where can I get one?

Actually, the passenger-side mud flap isn't standard.  You can buy a *pair*
of mudflaps at the dealer for about $100 (!), but I don't think they sell
them singly.

&gt;5)Finally, I should clarify that Barbara's name (my wife) shows up on my
&gt;messages because I am using her e-mail account, but it is me (Cris)the
&gt;one who you are reading from. By the way, is there a way to send the
&gt;list's postings to a special folder? Barbara hates to have to go through
&gt;them while looking for hers...

If you're using a PC, buy Eudora.  It allows you to filter mail into
folders easily.
