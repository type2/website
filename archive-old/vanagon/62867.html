Tim and others,
Along the same lines, I ran into a fellow at the Allman Brothers Band
concert in Knoxville with an '84 who replaced the stock square skylight
vent with a regular car sunroof.  He said it was a big improvement, and it
really vents well.  I believe him!  It looked pretty slick :-)

The glass was tinted and I believe he also had a bug screen on it.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have an older Westy top without the sunroof.  Wanted light so I bought
&gt; a used RV side window.  Tilt-out type/emergency exit.  It is HUGE, 28x36
&gt; and really opens up things. Also opens up really far, so I can play
&gt; On-Safari with the binoculars.   Rear seat has great view now.  No
&gt; screen (yet). You may consider having one of these installed at an RV
&gt; shop.  Mine cost $70 used and I DIY'd it.
&gt; 
&gt;   Friend with '89 Westy with smashed unit simply had a conventional car
&gt; sunroof installed for about $300.  Again, nicer than stock, and vents
&gt; well on highway.  Plus is a flush mount!  My screen will be simply a
&gt; piece of fine bug mesh with elastic sewn into a seam around it.  Giant
&gt; hair net. Have one that fits entire rear hatch right now! Works great,
&gt; cheap.  Tim
