Ian - Did you ever look into something called &quot;bass shakers&quot;? I have seen
several versions, Crutchfield has some that are about 5&quot; in diameter and 2&quot;
high. You screw them to the floor and supposedly they turn the body of your
vehicle into a large speaker. They aren't self-powered, you need to supply
your own amp. They run about $180 or the &quot;pro&quot; model is $230. I haven't heard
them action, I am hoping someone else will be a guinea pig.
