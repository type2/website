&gt; As I understand it there were four choices in colour for the early
&gt; Vanagons, blue, ivory, brown and white.....any others?...DC -- 
&gt; 

  It sounds like you are talking about Westys only here. If so, I have seen
  a some green ones, at least one each of air and water cooled. That would
  place them right around 1983, right?

  IMHO, if someone feels like whining about that eggnog color, they clearly
  haven't spent enough time with an overpoweringly ORANGE &lt;yes, that's ORANGE
  everywhere - even the curtains&gt; '73-'75 Westy.
