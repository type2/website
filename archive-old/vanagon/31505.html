Subject: where to stay when you're away?

okay,  here's my dumb question for 1995!   When you're cruising along en
route to your destination, and decide it's better to make it a 2 day drive
rather  than go straight through, and 1, you didn't bring your list of state
parks with you, and 2, you are not sure of the type area you're in (crime
ridden?, etc), and 3, you just don't want to spend a lot of time looking
around, and would detest staying in a KOA....and refuse to camp out in some
hotel.... whoaaaaaa,  

Where would you stay?  Truck stop? Mall parking lot? All night burger joint?
 I need help for this one in case I run out of pills...  Thanks for any
replies...
