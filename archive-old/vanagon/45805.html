Check out the standard RV supplier in your area.  Mine went out also, 
ended up using old faucet since I couldn't find one with low enough 
height to fit under the lid over stove/sink, wiring in a 3 position 
heater switch (Ford I think) behind the faucet, and using a standard 
water pump from an RV dealer.  One ?problem? is that the new pump 
puts out a LOT more water thatn the old (that's why the 3 position 
switch, to slow down the water flow).  Careful with the plumbing, 
check all hoses and use the opportunity to replace if suspect. 
Potential flooding if hoses break, been that, done there!  No 
reasonable way to dry it out other than park it in the sun.

&gt;   Does anyone have a good source for a faucet and pump 
&gt; for my 80 westi? The pump was burned out by the P.O.
&gt; They did some handi work on the broken faucet and it just 
&gt; kept running until it kind of melted the pump.
