Hi!
I'm an auto technician-formerly with Volkswagen, now with Mercedes-Benz. I
work at a MB-BMW-AUDI dealer here in Westmont,Il. I worked on VW's from '72
to '83, everything from '84-'86 and MB's from '87 to present. I'm happy to
find this mailing list, and would be happy to help any of you if I can.
I've owned buses since I learned to drive in '67,presently have a '84
Vanagon-I love it. I've done a lot to it, head gaskets, clutch, fuel
sender, replaced the coolant tubes, repaired various running problems,etc.
I also have a friend who seems to specialize in Vanagons, and works out of
his garage. If I'm stumped on something about a Vanagon, I call him. Again,
happy to be a member of this list, and willing to help!

Your VW pal,

yug
