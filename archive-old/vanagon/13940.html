Subject: Ball Joints F.S.

Hi,  I have four new ball joints, West German made not VW tho' which are 
still in their packing. They were for my '78, but I &quot;think&quot; they fit all 
breadloafs. Any interest? Best offer/Going cheap!  Can send USMail collect 
relatively soon.  tim s.  yup, it's spring cleaning time.
