Subject: cv joint question 

I just took off the right stub axle on my '71 van.  I am replacing a cv 
boot.  I noticed that the cv joint that connects to the wheel has the 
black grease in it but the other one (transmission side) has oil in the 
cv joint, in fact about a half cup leaked out when I removed it.  Is this 
normal?  Whats up with the oil instead of grease?
