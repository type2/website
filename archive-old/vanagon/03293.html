Subject: Re: rubber surrounding the pop top

Just noticed that a section of the rubber surrounding the pop top of my 83 
Westfalia is falling off. The rubber itself is in good condition. I think
whatever in side the rubber which helps to hold the rubber in place begins
to leave me. I can imagine it is going to cost me a fortune to replace it.
The rubber looks still like new. I hope that replacement of the entire
rubber is not the only solution.

Is there any other alternatives to fix it? Could someone with experience
shed some wisdom over this? Thanks.
