Subject: '89 synchro pricing?

Howdy,

I'm fixing to sell my '89 synchro this summer. It's rare enough
that I don't even see any around these parts - N. Texas, and I
never see them in the paper. Is there any way to ballpark an
asking price for this? Other than bluebook?

The van is a silver GL with weekender package. 92k miles with
everything working. Needs no work.

Pointers appreciated.

Thanks, Russ
