Yup, the sliding door on my '84 vanagon is stuck.  I tried to open it from 
the outside, and the handle felt and sounded like I disengaged the door 
mechanism (ya know what I mean, the sound and feel it makes when you open 
the door).  However, the door didn't open at all.  Simillarly, the inside 
handle has no tension on it, as if the door opening mechanism was stuck.

Has anyone encountered this before?  Please, all suggestions are welcome. 
 Thanks in advance.

Tim Casey
