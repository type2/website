Subject: '79 bus: starts, doesn't start. . .

Okay, so I just spent $1300 on my '79 for a new carb system, the mech put in
a new battery, new ground strap, new Bosch coil, new 009 distributor,
tune-up with plug wires, etc. . .and the other day miles from home it simply
did NOT start.  No turn over, no grinding, just plain SILENCE.  (Easy pop
quiz: Am I displeased?)

The headlights work, the little oil/batt indicator lights work when I turn
the ignition, but otherwise, nada.

Minor miracle yesterday: after taking the city bus out to rescue my Bus,
ta-daa! It actually turns over and starts just fine.  So I drive it home,
shut it off and turn it over again. . .and it starts again, no problem.
Hmmm. . .maybe my problems are over, I think, just a glitch.

I try it again this morning, and nothing.  I try several times in
succession, but nothing happens though the indicator lights work fine.

Right now I'm thinking: STARTER!  (which means, $200 or more, 'cause I've
read in the manuals that you have to take the whole engine out to get to it.)
I'm also thinking, optimistically, SOLENOID! (which seems a little bit
better.)  I've heard a lot about sticky solenoids lately.  I crawled
underneath the rear axle, thinking about giving it a nice WHACK! with some
implement, but I can't see the damn starter.  Is it way up there?  Any way
to get at it?
