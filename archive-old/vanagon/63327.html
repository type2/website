Subject:      Re: FW: Break Fluid

FYI:

I have heard from many VW owners/mechanics, and accepted the rational that
the ONLY brake fluid to use in VW's is Casterol Dot 4. Something about
Casterol being derived from natural materials (castor beans?) and all other
being synthetic or petrolium based. Seems the rubber-ish componants of VW
brakes like the bean goo and not the petro stuff.

Dot 4 has a higher boiling point, but I dunno how much higher.

hope this helps your decision

my friends all think I drink brake fluid...

...it's true...

...I DO drink brake fluid, but I can STOP anytime I want to.  : )
