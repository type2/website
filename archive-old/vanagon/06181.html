Subject: Re: Heute ist Freitag. Schtats again. :) + Fine Poetry

Ok, my turn =)
But second,  poetry:

The small town cop ignores
my Bus, for he knows that
drugs and hippies
are a strain
on his limited intelligence,
And he can always go
after the yuppie
sailing through in his
Black
Shiny
Lexus

So I just smile, and wave,
as he shakes his head in disbelief

Jon
