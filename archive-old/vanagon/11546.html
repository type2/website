Subject: '56 kombi update - engine lid &amp; brake light
Date: Sun, 12 Feb 1995 17:26:47 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

I put my center brakelight engine lid on today, after making some
minort adjustments so the T handle would fit on.  I also put in the
light but with a clear lense.

Someone tried to break into the bus Friday night.  The also broke into
the garage and stole our mountain bikes - I just had one built that was 
only 3 weeks old :( :( And Amy's was only about 5 months old :( :(

I think its the same people, since they went after the bus again.  I think
the club thing was an effective deterrent.  I could tell that they tried
to get in the bus because the driver's side handle, which has a &lt;defunct&gt;
spring, was sticking out, and I never leave it that way.            

This *$#_at_&amp;^$(#_at_ gets old,. fast. :( :(
