Subject: Curtains


I know the last few weeks I've heard a few people who didn't have 
curtains in their vans, and were looking for them.  Currenly the set I 
have is (I think) from the company who is currently selling them.  Since 
I have aluminum bars for the curtains to slide on, which I doubt is an 
origional westy design.

Anyway, if you have access to a sewing machine then I would highly 
recomend making them yourself.  The set that were with my van when I 
bought it are falling apart and sheding a brown dust, so my girlfriend 
offered to make me new ones.  

I just when and picked out the fabric, making sure it kept the right 
about of light out.  Then we used the old curtains for a pattern, leaving 
a few inches to hem over.  

They're not all done yet, but they look sooooo good.  I'm really happy 
with them.  If you have NO curtains to use as a patern then I would 
suggest just measuring the windows.  Mine hang freely at the bottom, so 
the length didn't have to be perfect.  

You could always talk your grandmother into making them.  She'd probably 
have fun at it.
