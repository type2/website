Subject:      Re: Door vents Now Rear Window Vents

Is there an easy way to clean the foam filter in the rear window vents?

&gt; Prior to '88, these were the place where air exited the van (it got sucked
&gt; out through a passage in the door to slots in the front edge of the door
&gt; and then out through the gap between the door and the frame).   This caused
&gt; lots of air  noise and allowed road noise to enter, so in '88, the air
&gt; exhaust was relocated to the rear windows, and the old exit was plugged
&gt; (the gap between door frame and door was filled by a new gasket too).
