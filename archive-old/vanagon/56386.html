Dear Listees, Would like to know if anyone else has had these symtoms, 
87 wb, while driving it has an intermittent miss,then it will go away 
for several days,then comes back repeatedly. This is normally on 
freeways, 60-65mph, will will also do it on stop and go driving,warm or 
cold. Went through shop bulletins found that this problem could be 
remedied by putting harness extension between air box,and did that for 
$115. from dealer.Their input was also that it worked for many 
customers. Still did same problem, no difference. Talked to Kyle at 
Volks Cafe suggested ground at computer,went under seat and found 
someone had alreadsy replaced ground wire, apparently had this problem 
previous with old owner, borrowed a computer from friend, went 300 
miles to Reno and back, no problems, took it out, miss is back. Any 
body have computer part#025-906-082,or bosch #0-261-200-065, suppose to 
be from any 86-on vanagon.Thanks Leonard _at_ AVP.
