Subject: RE: Recall of 1991 Vanagon - Fire danger
Date: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 15:19:00 -0600

This morning I found a note in my e mail that I think was from Germany.
The note quoted prices and certain specs of 6 cyl. engines for vanagons,
non Porsche.  If anyone has that note please forward to me. I erased it
by mistake.
Thanks.
