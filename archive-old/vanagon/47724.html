I prefer to use the term:
&quot;Re-distribution of available resources&quot; when referring to the 
reclaimation of otherwise disposed of stuff.  Being sure that the 
once owner of said objects has indeed removed any negative kharma, 
and that only positive kharma will exude from the items recovered 
from a landfill demise.  Stealing is still a no-no.
