Subject: Re: Upgraded Brakes Bus/Vanagon?


Winkler in Herne, Germany, offers slotted 14&quot; rotors and a conversion
kit to a four disk brake system (front will be 15&quot; air vented). The
conversion kit is also available from Oettinger who has a subsidiary
in US. 15&quot; air vented front brakes for Vanagons are also available
from VW South Africa, but I don't know if they will fit the pre '92.
