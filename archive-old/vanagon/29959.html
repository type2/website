Subject: Re: East Coast Inuvik: Labrador!

&gt;     Yes! Labrador sounds great to us.
&gt;
&gt;     Lets sketch out a few details, though. Like, how do you get
&gt;     there? Drive along the north side of the St. Laurence River, or

right, from city of Quebec

&gt;     take the ferry, then north on 389 to Labrador City, in the
&gt;     interior? What would make the best starting point?

The sound of &quot;389&quot; is deceptive. This is one *heck* of a bush road. Labrador
City is a trip as there are no signs, whatsoever, in the town. The town is
so isolated, nobody drives in from the outside and so they figure everybody
knows where everything is. 

&gt;     How much time will we need? The longer the trip, the more difficult
&gt;     for more listies to make it...

Took us 5 weeks, including the trip down to Goose Bay and the ferry to
Newfoundland.

It could be done in 3 weeks easily.

&gt;
&gt;     When?!?

I might go again around the year 2,000.
