Subject:      Re: Vanagon/Transporter

&gt; The terms Vanagon and EuroVan are to my knowledge exclusively North
&gt; American labels. They are unknown over here (in the old world). They
are
&gt; genericly called  'Transporter'. The 8/9 seater versions are sometimes

&gt; labeled  'Bus'  and the more luxerious versions 'Caravelle'.

And in South Africa 'Microbus' and 'Kombi'.  Are these the original
German names - Helmut?
