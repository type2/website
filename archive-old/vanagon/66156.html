Subject:      Re: Towing suggestions/questions for Vanagon

The problem with locking the front wheels with the steering lock is that
you cannot get the wheels perfectly straight.  I recently had my Westy
towed this way (it's an Auto) and it tows cock-eyed down the road.  Think
of the tire wear for long distance towing that it would create.
