Subject: Towbar Madness: A trip thru the Cornbelt

Hi All,

I returned last night from a whirlwind trip from KC to northern Nebraska
and back.  Although the primary function was to help out with my 90 yr
old grandmother's auction, I had also took the opportunity to haul back a
VW from a collector/enthusiast I know.

I took with a heavy duty bumper-mount hitch to haul back a 64 TIII
Notchback with my 84 Vanagon.  Upon inspection, it did not look stable
enough to pull by the bumper.  I'll get it this fall with a tow dolly.
Looking over my friend's collection, I ran across 'Black Beauty'--a black
62 hardtop bug needing attention.  The basic body is very solid and
straight, although the dash is cut up, but most of the glass and fenders
had been vandalized. Anyhow, I did not bring with my VW towbar, so I 
borrowed one to make the 300 mile trip back to KC.

After about 40 miles I had to make an unexpected sharp left and promptly
mangled the borrowed towbar!  This is in central Nebraska where there
aren't too many VW's.  Soooo, I retrofitted the bumper-style towbar to the
Bug's axle thanks to buy the 'proper' bolts at a tractor supply store and
it worked out ok.  About half way through the trip the Vanagon's OXY light
came on.  After a minute of panic I referenced the owner's manual and saw
it wasn't anything to worry about.  The icing on the cake was a
Continental 'TRANSPORT' tire, 6 ply, with a belt steadily going out with
100 miles to go!  I really didn't have time to change it if I was to make 
it home before dark w/o taillights on the Bug.  Somehow I made it home right
as it was getting dark with a *few* of my fingernails unbitten.  8-)
