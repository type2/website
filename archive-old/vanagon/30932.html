Subject: Re: VWs in Hollywood [was VW sighting (Field of Dreams)]


&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been making notes in my sketchbook (I often sketch when I
&gt;watch TV
&gt;&gt;&gt; or whatever) whenever I see VWs in movies...

Not a type II, but at the end of the credits for &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot; a
person on a unicycle on a street pedals past a bug parked on the left side
of the street.
