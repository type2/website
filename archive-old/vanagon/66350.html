I see no reason why you couldn't use the Propex while driving, but I can't
say for sure. It does have a blower and thermostat. I'm just now in the
process of installing mine so I can't report on how well it circulates the
heat but I've heard no complaints. Probably the biggest problem with the
Propex will be getting one. They aren't distributed in the US. Last year an
enterprising list member (bless his soul) put together an order and dealt
with all the duties and custom hassles and ordered a batch from England.

&gt;Thanks for your input.  I drive an air-cooled Vanagon in which the heat
&gt;is non-functional.  I may not need as much heat as I think.  I know the
&gt;Suburban can be operated while driving.  Is this true of the Propex?
&gt;Does the Propex have a blower, thermostat, etc.?  If it has a blower,
&gt;does it circulate the heat well?
