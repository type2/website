&gt;   I don't know if this will be of any help, but I once passed emmissions on

Shhhhhh!  Don't tell anybody, but I've had to sneak my Hyundai Pony 
(yeah, laugh, it's a winter car, ok?) through our emissions tests here in 
BC and here's how it's worked for me every time.  (But I'm not proud of it)

Go into the test with a quarter tank of Ultra Super-Duper Premium gas and 
a real warm engine.  And here's the trick: dump a litre of methyl hydrate 
in the tank before you leave.  That's the stuff sold to keep your fuel 
lines from freezing in the winter.

Please note: this trick is only good for reducing certain components of 
your emissions, and I don't know what they test for there, or what you're 
failing on.

Also, the engine runs just terribly with fuel like this, so fill up with 
reguar unleaded gas as soon as you get your pass certificate.  

Oh yeah, and I don't do this anymore.  Really.  You can destroy this 
message now....  ;)
