Subject: Re: baja substitution

&gt; a place north-west of where we went when we went to Red Rock (and this
&gt; place should be much quicker to get to).  It's called Lake Isabella,
&gt; and there looks to be a LOT of choices for both commercial and free
&gt; campsites in that vicinty, with the former being very reasonably priced
&gt; ($8-12).  B is I think going to check up for us on one that appealed
&gt; to him, which I think may be quite close to the lake.

You're alot of the way toward Panamint Springs at Lake Isabella - is this
outing also a substitute for the Desert Adventure &amp; Chili Cookoff at Panamint
Springs on Nov. 11?  I haven't heard much about it since Al Knoll proposed it a
couple of weeks ago.  I'd sign up for this one but would prefer going out to
Panamint, Death Valley, Saline Valley, etc.
