Subject: Trip report 

Hello-
	I've always enjoyed reading of other list members' travels in 
their brick-type vehicles, and figure I'm not the only one who does- so 
for the enjoyment of others like me, here's mine! (Very abbreviated...)
	Vehicle: 1978 VW Westfalia---&gt;&quot;Kermit&quot; (he's green)
	Passengers: Myself and my wife, Tammy
	Reason for trip: 5 year anniversary, see friends/relatives...
	Time on the road: left July 27, returned Aug. 27=== 31 nights
	Mileage covered: 8,422 miles
	We left Seattle late in the day, just in time to hit rush hour in 
both Sea-town and Tacoma.  Joy.  We plugged along til we couldn't no more,
and ended up sleeping (top popped) at a rest stop along I-5 south of 
Grant's Pass, Oregon.  Pulled in at 2 AM, slept til 7 AM. (Didn't know 
that was legal!)
	Next day, we headed south again.  Great morning views of Shasta, 
then things got hot: 95 degrees in Redding, Ca.  But, Oh, would things 
get hotter!  I wanted to see Bodega and Clear Lake, since I wasn't able 
to attend gatherings there- beautiful.  Bought local pistacios (sp?) in 
Lakeport.  Sitting in construction shortly after, bus begins to sputter.  
Temp outside about 95 F.  Shut off bus.  Wife busy videotaping, lotsa 
shots of me with scowl- too early into trip for breakdown.  Drive through 
Napa, on a very winding road, hit Friday afternoon rush hour out of San 
Fran into wine country, more bus problems- I'm gassing it to keep it from 
dying. It won't idle.  Bummed a bit, but cheered up by gorgeous Bodega 
Bay.  Extra Bonus- slept for free at Army Corps of Engineers &quot;campground&quot; 
right on water, after draining a couple of yummy Humboldt beers.
	Next day, got up early.  Fog lifts as we drive on.  I've cleaned 
electrical connections, but bus still coughing.  I just tuned it up, so 
I'm a little stumped.  Timing's off, I decide.  See lots, drink really 
scary jalapeno sodapops, decide to stay along Rincon that night.  Bad 
decision, got a ticket.
	At this point, considering funds, wife and I decide to get the 
bus checked out.  We figure a) simple fix by honest, trained mechanic  
b)meet dishonest mechanic, get ripped off, but bus still fixed  c) bus 
fixed, we get way ripped off, spend rest of month in Southern Cal 
penniless.  Deciding option (c) is &quot;worst case scenario&quot;, (not so bad, 
really), pull into garage in Ojai (the only one open, it's Sunday).
	Guy's nice, tries his best, is also stumped.  Timing's way off, 
times engine, charges me 20 bucks, and we're off.  Bus runs somewhat better 
til Malibu, 
where we hit MORE traffic.  Sputter through, make it into LA, and try 
another shop, where we meet a nice Australian guy with a 76 Westy.  He's 
off to the beach, though, and can't help.  Forget to tell him the one 
about how his ancestors were handpicked by the Queen from the best 
British prisons.... 
	Back onto freeway and *yikes* EGR light comes on, car dies, wont 
start.  We coast off an exit and I go back to check things out. Stare at 
engine compartment, begin to flip thru Muir.  But not for long.  A taxi 
pulls up,
and out steps my guardian angel- Carl.  Turns out this total stranger is 
a bus nut like me, only more mechanically inclined.  After pulling out a 
photo album of him and camper circa 1967,(we were parked right in front 
of his apartment), he and I get to work 'round back.  Check vacuum hoses, 
all fine.  Check fuel injectors, all good.  Reset EGR light (this was 
just coincidental, apparently).  Then he pops distributor cap.  Damn 
points had worked loose, and weren't closing.  End of problem.  Carl if 
you're out there, Thanks a million.  Happily, we move on.
	Stayed in San Clemente, surfed.  Right on- trip's back on track.
	(Okay- this isn't a short story).
	Travel next day along Mexican border toward Yuma, AZ.  Up the
mountains in California- very scenic.  Hit summit rest area, go pee.  
&quot;Watch for snakes&quot; says sign.  The trip into the unknown has begun, Tam 
and I agree (we'd never been to the Southwest desert before).  Back in 
bus, down the hill we go.  Temp maybe 90F.  Temp back in San Diego maybe 
75F.  We're hot.  But winding down that pass into SE California, behind
semi's with seriously smoking brakes, the temp began to soar.  At the 
valley floor we thought we were gonna die.  At a gas station in El 
Centro, CA. the thermometer pushed 106F.  I no longer worried about the 
engine exploding, but about US exploding!  But, we made it to Yuma 
intact.  We got an air conditioned room (damn- why did I disconnect the 
Air in the bus ;-)   , and slept in comfort.  The bus would 
suffer only minor problems the rest of the trip....

Whew! If anyone out there wants to hear more of our adventures, I'll 
gladly post more- but for now, my fingers are begging for mercy.

Thanks for listening,
Jeff
