Subject: Cruise (more) blues.

Don't install SCS/Frigatte electronic cruise in your Vanagon.  I just had the
installer replace the servo unit and I'm still having problems.  The next
step will be to try standard vacuum cruise. Don't ask me why this wasn't done
in the first place...but the installer recommended electronic cruise in
Vanagons.

Since this is the third trip back I'm getting a little frustrated.  My
&quot;regular&quot; mechanic hates installing cruise, my VW mechanic (who owns an 87
Vanagon) has factory cruise and won't mess with aftermarket leaving me with
this &quot;custom&quot; installer.

I have the address (thanks to Joel) for Zemco but it's not a brand my
installer handles -yet!  I may insist if this saga continues.

Anyone out there successful with SCS/Frigate vacuum cruise in their vanagon?
 It works great in my 94 Trooper and 90 Subaru.

Thanks!
