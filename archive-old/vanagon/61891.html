Subject: Gas tank repair?

Hello all,

i was going to post this to the type2 list, (its an 80 and thus aircooled)
but figured y'all would know a lot more about the gas tanks.

My gas tank has a 1/4&quot; by 1/8&quot; hole under where the heater tube runs.  It
seems to be in good shape otherwise.

My _plan_ is to fiberglass the outside of the hole for structural rigidity
and then to slosh the inside of the tank with sealer to keep the gasoline
from eating through my patch. Is this a feasable plan?

If not, What can i expect to pay for a rust-free used tank, or even
better, what can i expect to pay a professional welder to fix my little
hole?

thanks,

Steve
