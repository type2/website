Subject: Consensus on Head Leaks

Waserboxer's:

What is the experience with VW for fixing leaks? We have several dozen
Wasserboxers on the list. I would like to know how many didn't leak, leaked
and those that VW fixed or helped to fix. (Send me a note directly.)

My daughter's '91 has a leaky left head. The van has over 100k. Bar's Leak
helped but finally gave out. Dealer cost to do both heads was $1900 or so.
Local shop wants $700.

I doubt VW will cover more than 1/2 the cost at the dealer so it would be
better to go with the local shop.

Are there any magic buttons that can be pressed at VW to get the whole deal
paid for. I'd appreciate your ideas.

Thanks,

Herb
