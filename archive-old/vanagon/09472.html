one more thought:

Eastwood company has a Speedometer cable lubricator ... a little gizmo that
fits on the end of a cable and allows a grease gun to pump grease (of some
sort) into the Zert fitting on the end of the gizmo. says it includes an
adapter for use on &quot;other cables, such as throttle ...  Fits all cables up
to 1/2&quot; in diameter.&quot;
part # 1693 Speedometer Cable Lubricator ..... $24.95
1-800-345-1178

i've never ordered from these folks, so i don't know if their stuff is any
good or not.
