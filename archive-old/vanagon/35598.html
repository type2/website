Subject: FREE High Top for bay window

as the subject line says......

if anyone wants a free fibreglass hardtop (off a 72' camper conversion)
please e-mail me privately for a more thorough description, i would like to
give the roof to a good home instead of just junking it.......

the roof is located in guelph, ontario (45 minutes west of toronto)
