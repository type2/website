Subject: I'm writing a NEATO article 
Date: Fri, 30 Jun 95 10:02:37 EDT
From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

  As the subject says, I am writing an article for the NEATO newsletter
on &quot;Buses in Cyberspace&quot; or hopefully a less cheesy title. Anyway, If
anyone has anything exciting to say, Iwould be happy to see if I can
include it. If no one has any objections, I will probably give the web
page addresses as listed on the weekly stats. Anyway, ideas? comments?
Richard
