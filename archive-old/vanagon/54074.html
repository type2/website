Subject: Import Westy from Canada

In my search for a replacement for my '91 Westy which died, I have found a
'91 near Ottawa with 58000 kilometers/36,000 mi. Sounds like just what I want 
(although wrong color - but can't be too picky here!). Westy had never been
driven in winter and owner sounds VERY nice in discussion.

Question: Can anyone provide information on the potential problems of or
          procedures required to bring the Westy into the states?

          Of course, I can go get it and drive it back - but its all the
          legal stuff that I don't know about. Who should I contact and
          what do I need to provide/do to make this possible?

Thankx -
	Kenyon
