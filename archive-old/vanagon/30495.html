&gt;With this cold weather I'm sure I'm not alone with starting problems, but
&gt;what's a guy to do?

Well, I'm probably the only one to change oil three weeks ago &amp; put in nice,
fresh 20-50. (Yup.  In Iowa.  Stupid and wasteful.)  At -10F Die Frau's
crankcase seemed to be full of jello :)

Her comments?  &quot;Start?  No I'm not going to start, you fool!  Give me the
right oil for winter &amp; I might start.  I'm too old for this crap!  Go drive
the Vanagon.  Go drive that stupid Mazda.  But leave me alone!!&quot;

(It was a rough morning)

Today, with some nice, runny 5-30 oil, she started right up at -5F.  She was
in a much better mood.
