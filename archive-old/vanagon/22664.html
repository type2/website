Bob,
	What kind of &quot;compressor&quot; do you use in your forge?  An 
adjustable sorce of air is a must for keeping them coals hot.  I got 
stuck having to remove a steering wheel of off the '66 with no torch or 
realistically usable puller.  I had a coal (the black stuff that you 
mostly have to mine, coal) fire burning, heating a huge cylinder of water 
and I plucked a few glowing chunks and dropped them into the center of the 
steering wheel around the shaft.  It was obvious that I was going to 
wreck a nice steering wheel if I didn't get enough heat fast enough 
around the shaft to loosen the the thing.  I pulled a Bic pen out of my 
pocket and removed the pen and ink well out of the clear housing the cheap 
ones come in.  I blew air threw this onto the coals.  I had a pretty good 
mini forge here a the wheel almost immediately popped off.  Wow.  A 
friend and I once straightened the frame on a '66 Caddy using charcoal in 
a hibabaci BBQ blasted with air from a shop compressor.  It took a while 
to get the bent part cherry red and then it pulled back like putty.
For me it would be a tuff call.  Welding rig or the air tools and 
compressor.  I end up spray painting things so I might go for the air 
first then the gas as soon as possible.  Check out used tool ads.  Maybe 
both if the price is right.
