Subject: Camping in Maine


My wife and I stayed at a beautiful campground in Southwest Harbor ME (about 
5mi from the park) over the Forth of July weekend(make reservations early), 
I'll try to dig up a name(around 12/nite...for tent/VW site(no hookups)).  I 
even managed to get the 76 Westy I was driving up to the top of Cadillac Mt. 
 I had to open the door and push a few times to keep going up! :)

 I've given up on the idea of camping in ME. until next Spring.  I think 
I'll hit North Carolina instead this coming weekend.

Nickerson S.P. in Mass. is a beautiful campground, and an excellent deal $ 
($8/nite??).  We tried to get in there over Labor Day weekend and it was 
booked up completely.  We tent camped at another privately owned campground 
for around $20/nite and rode for two days on the rail trail.  Cape Cod MA is 
a must for any list Camper folks that are in the area.

Pete
