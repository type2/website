On my 83.5 Westy &quot;Toaster&quot;, tilt and slide levers are on the right hand   
side on both of my front captain's chairs.  I thought that was really   
great engineering form the German's perspective.  Less parts for   
assembly.  I don't know if to PO changed seats they might have.

It woulda been cheaper for VW to make them the same, but
obviously VW felt that there was valid/good reason for making them
different.  I haven't noticed any difference between using either
seat in the driver position though.  The only reason I can think of is   
for
the driver's controls to be on the left, away from the handbrake.
