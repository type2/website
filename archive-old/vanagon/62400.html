Martin,

This seems like a great idea!  My only concern would be securing the bags
against theft.  Do you use any deterents?

&gt; For clothes and stuff that can be compressed without being damaged
&gt; consider canoeing style &quot;drybags&quot; instead of a box. They seal completely
&gt; waterproof, and are eary to hoist up and strap down. I also
&gt; expect less extra wind drag than from a box. Drybags comes
&gt; in sizes up to about 70l (70l is about the volume of a large suitcase or
&gt; backpack). I think one could fir up to 4 large bags on the rack.
&gt; I've had three drybags and one 5 gal jerry can up there.
&gt; Price for drybags? $15-$30 at your canoeing shop or sports store.
&gt; Sealline by Cascade designs are durable.
