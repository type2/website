So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; As needed, I will request more contributions from the list to keep it
&gt; going. will use 100% of the money I receive to pay for the beer, Steve!  :)

Well... I was wondering how you were going to scrap up the money to
keep your Safari goin'.  ;)

&gt; I will keep the subscription going until funds run out or Gerry gets
&gt; tired of those beers littering his doorstep (yah right!!).

Is there an AA web site too.  Looks like Gerry's going to need it! ;p

I think short of just sending Gerry himself, some bucks, that it would
be a pretty cool idea.  Will Gerry sue us 25 years from now for turning
him into an alcoholic?  :I   :)

And when do I get my free mug?  ;)
