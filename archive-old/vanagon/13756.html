Subject: Re: alternator light on


&gt;The light comes on
&gt;brighter when the headlights are on and when the engine is reved high.  Does
&gt;anyone know what could be at fault?  

You had the alternator checked, and you don't think that the voltage
regulator is at fault.  Hmmm...

I had a similar problem with my 1970 Bus, and it eventually solved itself
after I replaced the starter.  I was trying to squeeze the last bit of life
out of the dying starter (fun to do!), all the while worried about the
glowing generator light.  When I replaced the starter, the light glowed no
more!

This may not apply to you.  If the alternator and regulator (aren't they
together?) are OK, I don't know.
