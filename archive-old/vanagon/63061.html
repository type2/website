Subject:      Re: Octane Question

&gt;      At the risk of sparking a &quot;me too&quot; exchange, I'll ask a question:
&gt;
&gt;      Is everyone using the octane rating specified for their Wasserboxer?
&gt;
&gt;       (I am, and intend to continue, so please, no well-intended lectures.)
&gt;
&gt;      If not, is the potential for detonation a factor in head problems that
&gt;      some are experiencing?
&gt;
&gt;      Okay, that's two questions.  Copious apologies in advance if this has
&gt;      been beat to death already.

I use Regular (usually 87 octane on the US octane scale)  I have never
heard a single ping from the engine, even in the mountains where regular
is 85 octane or less.  This is on a 1.9, the 2.1 has higher compression
and is probably different.

I have always figured that you should advance the timing until a very
small amount of pinging is heard (DON'T Try this on an air cooled
engine), but when I tried advancing the timing on my vanagon, the idle
speed became unstable.  Any ideas?

Bill
