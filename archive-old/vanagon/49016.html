Paul,

I had a similar problem with my '86.  Try checking the computer under the
back seat for a short.  While the engine is running,  push the computer
against the frame the see if it stops.  All I did was put a square of
cardboard between the computer and the frame and fixed the problem.  

Good Luck,

Charles Michaux

PS.  The dealer said I needed a new computer for $700.00 to fix the
problem!!!!

&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1986 Vanagon GL with AC and automatic trans and a 2.1iter motor.
&gt; New motor with 10,000 miles on it.  
&gt; 
&gt; This Vanagon has a problem where after about 20 min or so of 60 to 65 mph
&gt; driving it will cut out for about 1/2 sec then keep on going with no
trouble
&gt; for a while (maybe a minute maybe 10 min.)  and then the motor will cut
out
&gt; again. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is very abrupt when it does this. And when the motor restarts again it
is
&gt; also very violent. This seems to worse the warmer the engine temp. 
Although
&gt; over the course of my commute 1 hr+  it may do this once or twice or not
at all.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I read on the list about wiring harnesses and such but I am not sure this
is
&gt; hte same problem.  When it happens, the tach. drops very quickly, more
&gt; quickly than I would expect,  so I am not sure if I am losing electrical
&gt; power to the motor. 
&gt; I does not backfire when this happens though.  
&gt;   
&gt; Also does anyone know the normal operating range as depicted by the gauge
in
&gt; my van. Do we know what the actual spread in degrees is across the range
of
&gt; the gauge. If I sit in traffic for awhile I can see the gauge go almost
3/4
&gt; of the way across the face, but I have not seen it go any furtheer than
that.
&gt; 
&gt; I have bled the system and there does not seem to be any air in it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks folks
&gt; 
&gt;
