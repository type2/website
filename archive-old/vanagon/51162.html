&gt;&gt;I've heard that the OEM setup provides venting of the battery before, but I
&gt;&gt;can't find any evidence of venting on the passenger side battery of either
&gt;my
&gt;&gt;87 Syncro or 88 Wolfsburg.  Neither are Westies.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Can you describe what OEM venting you've seen for these batteries?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;My 87 syncro Westy has venting for the passenger side battery. It consists
&gt;of a ~1.5&quot; tube that leads from the battery compartment through the bottom
&gt;of the van. You can see this tube hanging down from just under the seat area
&gt;if you look behind and above the front tire. When I installed a new
&gt;lead-acid battery, I connected a piece of clear plastic tubing to a vent on
&gt;the battery and routed it out through the 1.5&quot; tube.

Hmmmm.  Neither of my non-Westys has this tube.  Perhaps this is a Westy only
feature.  I can't see why they'd only put it in the Westys though.  The
batteries generate the hydrogen during charging - which means during driving.
 During sleeping time in a Westy no gases would be produced.  I suppose with
the propane stove &amp; refirgerator there would be a source of ignition that's
not in the non-Westys.
