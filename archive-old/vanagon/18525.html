Subject: bodega directions


In response from a few of you who somehow missed this, here's a repost
of the directions to Bodega Bay.

Directions:

There are 4 exits one can take to get from Highway 101 to get to the
Bodega Bay area:

1.  Take River Rd.  Exit. Follow west to Guerneville, then take hwy. 116
    to hwy. 1 south to Bodega Bay - 36 miles.

2.  Take hwy. 12 west exit through Sebastopol until it becomes
    Bodega hwy to coast hwy. 1 - 23 miles.

3.  Take hwy. 116 west exit to Sebastopol, then west on hwy. 12 (which
    is also called the Bodega hwy.) to coast hwy 1 - 28 miles.

4.  Take the East Washington St. exit, and follow the signs
    30 miles west to Bodega Bay.

If anyone wants to call the Bodega Bay Area Visitors Center, their
number is:  1.707.875.3422

We are staying at the Bodega Dunes State Campground, which is one-half
mile north of the town of Bodega Bay.

PLEASE NOTE:  The town on the ocean (on hwy. 1) is called Bodega Bay.
There is also a town of Bodega, about 5-10 minutes inland from Bodega
Bay, but our site is north of Bodega BAY.
