Seems like we have the makings of an impromptu meeting in the Philly area this 
weekend.

Any more willing participants?

I'll probably arrive late Friday or very early Saturday.

Don't know where I'll stay yet. I have to visit relatives (sorta relatives) but I don't 
intend to stay with them.

I have a campground book but any other ideas?
