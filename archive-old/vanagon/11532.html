I would check the little voltage regulator chip (the proper name for this
little black chip escapes me now), that is screwed onto the foil circuit
board. It is supposed to regulate the voltage in the instrument cluster to
10 volts. Use your VOM. Also, check all of your connections again :).

BTW, the Bentley manual describes how to check the volt. reg.
