Comments on Sink Drain, Relocating Drain Hose/Hole

&gt;3. The water fill cover used a plastic key which broke off on first use.
&gt;More water ends up on the ground than in the tank when filling with
&gt;a hose.

You can never fill the water tank with a full blast of hose water. You have
to go somewhat slowly. But if the problem is very severe, it means the air
exhaust tube from the tank is kinked. When this tube is kinked it won't let
much water enter the tank because too much pressure builds up in the tank.
Kinking point is usually immediately inside the black square fill plastic
piece. You have to undo the screws of this piece and pull it out to look at
the see through plastic hose to see if it looks like it could be kinked. 

&gt;4. The sink drain usually didn't. I used a collapsible plastic drain
&gt;bag. Probably need to use a vented bucket.

I cannot understand how the sink could fail to drain unless you left the cap
on underneath the vehicle or unless you stuff cooked egg pieces down the
drain after washing the breakfast pan. 

SPECIAL TECH COMMENT: The sink drain hose is routed through the middle of the
lower storage space under the sink instead of the side, thus limiting how
much stuff you can put in there. All camper owners should pull out the false
floor in the bottom of this cabinet, thereby increasing the space they can
have there. This lower false floor is designed solely to hide the fact that
the hose takes up valuable storage space but removing the floor greatly
increases how much space you have. All camper owners should also consider
relocating the drain hole over to the side of this lower cabinet as I did to
free up this space. Lastly, fanatics can cut out the false back of this lower
pantry cabinet to get anothr 2&quot; clearance in the back. Following all three
suggestions can probably increase this lower pantry cabinet space by 50%.

Estimated time to:
Remove the false floor: 3 mins.
Relocate the drain hole in the floor: 2 hours
Remove the false back: 2 hours

As you can see, removing the false floor is the easy way to start to increase
your pantry space.

&gt;6. Interior lighting is pathetic.

That's why all camper owners should install more factory lights in the back
of their campers as I have urged.

By the way, a used 91 4x4 syncro camper with low miles just sold near here
(at a dealer) for $18,000. Yow!
