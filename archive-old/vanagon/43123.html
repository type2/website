&gt; &gt;From unfortunate previous experience with Sacramento River Killer
&gt; Mosquitoes, use the rear hatch bug screen with CAUTION! At least on my
&gt; '83, the bottom of the screen has no positive attachment to the
&gt; doorframe and those clever, hungry bugs WILL find a way in. I am working
&gt; on a plan to attach extra fasteners to the engine deck, but until then I
&gt; will not use the rear screen, no matter how hot it is.
