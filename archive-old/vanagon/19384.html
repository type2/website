&gt; Well, I was flipping through the channels last eveing, and as the 
&gt; station hit TNN (ACK) I saw the coolest ad for a motorhome.  
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like Winnebago has created a really slick motorhome with the 
&gt; Eurovan's front end on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen or heard about this unit.  If it runs the stock EV 
&gt; engine it has got to be &gt;&gt;WAY&lt;&lt; underpowered!
&gt; 
&gt; Pretty cool though!

Yup.  It's called the Rialta, and it's a pig.  Stock engine, horrible
ground clearance, unacceptably little interior space.  But, it's
relatively cheap (not much more than the Westy) and has a really trick
slide-out bathroom thingie.  Stop by your local RV dealer for a peek, I
did.  :)
