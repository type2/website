So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Without getting too involved, here's a list of things you may want to bring 
&gt; along...  
&gt; 
&gt; Guitars and harmonicas

What about the 7 foot grand piano?

&gt; Special notes:  Since we'll be inhabiting adjacent private sites, the 
&gt; campground suggested we bring folding chairs, so that we can all be together 
&gt; around one campfire at night if we want.  If everyone throws in firewood it 
&gt; would be helpful

If it's raining, we may want to rig up a tarp hung over a picnic table.  Of
course if it's windy, it'll probably have to come down.

&gt; fish chowder for dinner?  Let me know, will be happy to help plan the food.

I think we should do at least one pot luck dinner.  Someone mentioned eating
in town which is fine for at least one meal.

If someone would bring a pictionary game, they're real fun for groups of
people for after dinner fun.  We don't have one because usually someone
else in the family has one.
