Subject:      heads leaking oil-help this guy

Can someone help diagnose?  Is this a simple head gasket problem or
is he right about the engine?  I'm just wary of the dealer diagnosis.

Via e-mail correspondence from the VW W/C USENET group:

---------

I'll call the bus depot and talk with them about some help. The
preliminary assessment from the vw dealership--&quot;You've got oil
pouring out of the heads.&quot; Sounds like new engine time to me. Thanks
again. Chris Parker
