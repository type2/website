Subject: propane tank

Can anyone help me with information on the propane tank of my 84
westy? I had to replace the two-stage regulator to get the stove and
(prop part) of my refer to work. I enjoyed good service from the system
until I needed to re-fill the tank. When I attempted to have the tank
filled it acted as if it were full with liquid coming out of the
(bleeder?). Since this is the first time ive had to fill the tank Im not
sure if there is a problem or if the man filling the tank is in error.


	Thanks for any help you can give.
