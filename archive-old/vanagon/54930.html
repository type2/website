My comment here is not about wiper blades but Rain-x.  I have been using 
this product for several years.  It makes minimal difference in light 
rain, but in heavy stuff there is no comparison.  You can drive with or 
without wipers but with wipers is a little better.  When you need it 
there is no substitute.  When the rain is light it is some help but not 
critical.  This is a very good safety product whatever your wiper 
situation might be.  The key word here is safety.

Application is not difficult and cost, application time and frequency 
are minimal.  I do not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.  
Wish I had invented it and was receiving royalties.  Even better it 
would save lives if everyone used it.
