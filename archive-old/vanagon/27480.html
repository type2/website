Subject: RE: vanagon heat

Kirk Smith wants to run his gas heater intermittently all night.  

The gas heater never struck me as very sparing of electricity.  Would your
aux battery last all night?  If so, I would consider a programmable timer
rather than a thermostat, so you could be sure that the on cycles were no
more than a few minutes duration, no matter what the outside temperature
got to be.

All you outdoorspeople are impressive but a little strange in my eyes.  I
saw all the wet canvas I ever want to in the Army, so the Kennedy family
spells camper M O T E L.
