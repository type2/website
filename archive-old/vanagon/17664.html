Subject: looking for HotVW-Dec.'91 article
Date: Tue, 16 May 1995 12:55:36 -0500 (CDT)

Yesterday, I called MSDS about putting Porsche power into a '75 bus and he
suggested I call someone named Dieter (maybe Martin's brother??). Dieter,
in turn, suggested that I look up an article in the December '91 issue of
Hot VWs. The article should contain pictures of their conversion kit.
Would anyone on this list have a copy and be willing to send me a Xerox?
I'll cover your cost. Thank you.
