Subject: Trip Report

Just arrived back from the family reunion in Dallas. Had no real trouble with the Vanagon other 
than retorquing the transmission to transaxle bolts and transmission pan bolts after the first 
day. Averaged 18.5 MPG for the trip over 2400 miles with the A/C on at 70MPH. Only saw three other 
Vanagons on the whole trip - all three were white. Two were westies headed north on I-75 yesterday 
afternoon. The other one was broken down on the side of I-10 outside of New Orleans last Tuesday. 
I stopped to help but he already had a tow truck on the way. He thought his problem was some bad 
Florida fuel.
Anyway, its time to clean the interior and give the Vanagon a good wash and wax job. Also planning 
on cleaning out the AC unit and oiling the fan motor. Fan speed #3 stopped working again so I need 
to troubleshoot that again.
