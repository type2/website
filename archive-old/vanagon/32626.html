Subject: traction cables/poor man's syncro


FWIW I have a set of traction cables that are very 
functional on my RWD '86. These things go on and off 
with relative ease. If I didn't have the cables I 
would not be able to get in and out of the garage
without some problem. I can put these on and take them
off as the situation rises, don't need a jack or ramps,
but my fingers do get cold. So for $68 I can get around
almost as well as a Syncro at a fraction of the cost.
