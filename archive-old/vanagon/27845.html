&gt; &gt; The splash pan is one of the first things removed from the typical bus, but
&gt; &gt; it has a function and should be retained.  If your bus is lacking a splash
&gt; &gt; pan you can make a good replacement simply by pulling a fiberglas copy from
&gt; &gt; an existing pan.  The existing pan must be sanded, sealed and waxed to
&gt; &gt; prevent bonding, and your pull should have at least three layers of fabric on
&gt; &gt; the body, six on the flange.  The nice part is that your fiberglas copy won't
&gt; &gt; rust or rattle.

re; fibreglass splaash pans....great idea bob!

i have been meaning to put my splash pan back on but the dreaded PO snapped of the heads of the 
mounting screws (the one that holds the pan on underneath), and the remains of the screws (sans 
heads) are now stuck in the frame!.

Unfortunately i can't reach the remains of the screws from the other side either. Essentially the 
screws are stuck in the frame and i can't get them out, short of drilling them out (which always leaves 
the potential for screwing up the threads- not to mention it is a pain in the butt!). As one who doesn't 
like drilling any new holes, does anyone have any recommendations for removing these broken off 
screws?? I'd like to re-install the pan but the busted off screws are currently preventing this!


 I like the idea of the fibreglass pan, perhaps there is a market for these! Most of the pans i have seen 
are rusted out beyond belief!
