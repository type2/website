Not quite true.  I purchased a Syncro once that needed a transmission.  Drove
it around the block a few times, sounded awfull but got up to speed okay.
 When the trans was disasembled, the ring and pinion had no teeth at all.  I
was drivng with only the front wheels pulling and I did not notice it.
 Driving a Syncro in the snow is a blast. it is so sure footed, you forget
that there is snow on the road.  Could be dangerous as you can drive too fast
to stop safely.
