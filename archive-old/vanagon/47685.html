Subject: Bob Hoy Wasser Gasket Kits: Opinions Wtd

Hi,

I know that MoFoCo sells Wasserboxer gasket kits and they have been
recommended, but I've been $crewed over by them about 8 yrs ago on a T1
longblock with poorly reamed valve guides.  I've vowed never to buy from
them again.  The local VW dealer sold me a 4 speed gasket set for $55--way
over priced for what was in the kit, so I'm not inclined to go that route 
again.

I have bought a lot of merchandise from Bob Hoy's in the past, but some
heads a buddy of mine bought from them had *very* poor work done on them.
I noticed that they advertise Wasserboxer gasket kits and head gaskets.  
Has anyone out there used these products from Hoy's?  What brand were they?
How was the quality?  Any better sources for the money?  TIA
