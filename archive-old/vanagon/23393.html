Seat Belts
-----------

My '65 bus has nothing for the middle and rear bench seat belts to
connect to. Nothing. The PO must have put in a new floor or
something. Any suggestions on installing seat belts in these
areas?

Fuel Gauge
----------

For some reason the PO installed a 4 gallon fuel tank(or is this standard...
always thought it should be 8 gallons). When I fill up the tank the fuel
gauge reads 1/2 full(makes sense since it should be an 8 gallon tank). But
I thought a fuel gauge reading was independent of the tank size, true or false?

Fiery Death
-----------

I'm sorry to report that yesterday after leaving work I could see this huge
cloud of smoke billowing over some trees. As I got closer I could see the
outline of a VW bus(a '69 I think...was a little hard to tell). Apparently
the owner was a victim of the dreaded engine fire and could only watch
because he didn't have a fire extinguisher. The bus was completely engulfed
with flames by the time the fire department arrived.

All flags at half mast today.
