&gt;Hi Volks
&gt;
&gt;I have a '77 Westfalia in lovely VW &quot;this-is-the-70's&quot; green.
&gt;I'm about to replace the windshield seal and repair a rust bubble
&gt;or 2 - any ideas where I can pick up on the order of a pint of
&gt;paint that will match fairly closely?  

Your paint color is Tiaga Green.  You can get a small (5 oz.) spray 
can of this paint (now renamed Sage Green, but the exact same 
color), VW Stock # L63H, for about $10 from any VW dealer. Mine can 
get it for me in about 3 days notice. 

Also, I have been told that a full sized spray can sold through 
industrial equipment suppliers by Clarke Lift Systems for touching 
up their lift trucks is the same color, only cheaper.  I saw it on 
a bus and it matched, but when I bought a can and tried it myself 
the can I got was definately a different (yellower) shade. 

For those who have a Chrome Yellow camper, the Plasti-Kote color 
School Bus Yellow (stock #1116), sold at Pep Boys and other FLAPS, 
is a virtually identical match.

(Also parting out 3 '75-78 Busses/Campers - yes, a shameless plug.)
