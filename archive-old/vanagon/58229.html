Subject: Bentley????

I have a book that was in my '81 Westie when I bought it.  It says on the
cover that it is the &quot;Factory Repair Manual&quot;  1980/1981, Has &quot;Vanagon&quot; in
big white letters, and a VW logo.  The title page says it is &quot;Repair Manual
Type 25 Vanagon,&quot; and has the VW logo and Volkswagen of America, Inc.

The next page has a publication #  W 42-020-123-1, First Edition 9/80, and
says it is Copyright 1980 by Wolkswagen of America.

Is this the Bentley manual everyone talks about?  It doesn't say Bentley on
it anywhere that I can see.

Thanks,
Bill
