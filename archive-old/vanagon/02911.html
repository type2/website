Subject: Re: clutch cable tube woes

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;THEN i started sliding the new one in the tube.  About a foot from the end
&gt;&gt;of the metal tube it STOPPED.  Mind you it didn't even make it to the
&gt;&gt;curved flexible section - which is where i thought i would have trouble. 
&gt;&gt;I spent 3 hours trying to get that cable to go.  Even got the vise grips
&gt;&gt;on it and tried to hammer it in the hole.  No luck.  The old cable won't
&gt;&gt;go either.  The tube is not mashed, and is quite full of grease.\
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I fought the bus and the bus won.  (so far)
&gt;&gt;

I had a similar problem with my 73 super beast long time ago. The gas pedal
wire broke. I could not get the new one slide through the tunnel. I went out
(on foot) to get a long piece of steal wire and slide it backward from the 
backend. It went through. I then had the steal wire pulling the gas pedal
wire through. It worked. Give it a try and good luck.
