    Let's get to the root of the problem. Get your prestone jug.
    Call the &quot;1-800......&quot; Number on the back. Ask them about
    phosphate. They will tell you It's the water! NO THE PHOSPHATES!

     My Vanagon is proof I used regular prestone 6 1/2 years ago.
     Today it still runs good, with out leaks. I haven't changed
     it since!
