Subject: Well Excuuuuuuse Me...(was electrical problems)

Darn, these cookies are good!

First of all, in my own defense, I just want to apologize to those of you
who didn't get enough sleep for not snipping out the entire cookie story. I
may be new to Volkswagens, but I at least know that Unix aren't dudes who
stand around and guard the chicks... Mistakes happen, okay? Just be glad it
wasn't the great Warren Peace post of 1982...

Well, so much for sarcasm and cookie dough... moving right along...


My father always told me: &quot;John, it's the little things in life you have to
watch out for...you can sit on a mountain, but you can't sit on a tack...&quot;

Brake light problem solved!  Why?  Uh, I needed to change the...are you
laughing at me?...Don't make me come over there... bulb, okay, I needed to
change the bloody bulb!

Actually, I also had to scrape the connections in the back and reconnect
one of the terminals, as when I had removed the battery, I must have
jostled one of the wires loose...

Well, at least the good news is, after four months of sitting in my
driveway, I can now cruise around Austin and enjoy the finer things in
life...music, women, art, and Neiman-Marcus...

Regards,

Johnny


PS. Thanks to everyone who tried to help...all of your suggestions were
followed!
