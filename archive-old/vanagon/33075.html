Subject: Funny VW cartoon

I don't know what made me think of this, but about 15 years ago I came
across a single-frame cartoon in a magazine (I can't remember the mag!)
that showed an  indian (Native American, to be PC) and a tourist
(Middle-aged white male, to be PC, but he wasn't angry) watching an old and
a young indian with their ears to the ground.  The caption is of the
standing indian talking to the tourist, paraphrased:  &quot;Old brave hears
angry three-legged bear approaching camp.  Young brave hears VW van with
flat tire.&quot;

I cut it out, but it's probably buried in the loft in the garage.
