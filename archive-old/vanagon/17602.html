Subject: Re: Best bus for Mexico (was Some 1600cc questions.)

&gt;Thanks for the comments. I guess my intent is to put together the best 
&gt;bus for Mexico/Central America travel:
&gt;
&gt;I took my '76 Camper down there several years ago and I would of really 
&gt;been deep in caca if I had needed any engine parts.
&gt;
&gt;However, parts for 1600cc powered buses can be found worldwide.... 
&gt;
&gt;Of course, a '71 Bus would be a mechanic's dream, but, alas, I've been 
&gt;spoiled by the royal comforts of my '77 camper... What to do ??? 
&gt;

I just finished reading a couple stories in the
lenti.med.umn_dot_edu/pub/vanagon files that you might find helpful.  They are a
bit dated, but I'm sure much of what is in there is useful.  There are
stories of a trans Sahara trip, a a trans Australia trip, and a couple who
drove to South America, all by VW bus.  The trans Sahara trip is really
something, y'all should check it out.  The VW is truly an international vehicle.

Eug,
