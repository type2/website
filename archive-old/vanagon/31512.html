Subject: VWOA Head Replacement


Could somebody send me some of the info or experiences they have had with 
getting VW to pay some of the cost of the head problem.


- Any things I should be aware of?

- Any numbers I can call? 

- Is it worth a shot when the work was done a long time ago?


I think I'm going to persue trying to get some of the money back. It 
could be some money if they will do it after the fact.

Please send all replies to me!

Thanks
