Subject:      Re: EV Tires


I'd like to ask the EV owners once again about tires. I recall Ric Golen
saying he preferred the Michelin MXL's to the Continental Contacts, but
someone else thought the Conti's were great. I've been looking around for
a set, but local tire stores keep trying to sell me passenger car tires
that they claim are strong enough for vans. My understanding was that the EV
requires tires with a reinforced sidewall, 6-ply tires and not 4=ply ones.
The TIre Rack only has Eagle GA Extra Loads and COntis (CT 22, which must
be a species of Contact). Things are complicated by the fact that Micheline
made MXL's mostly for passenger cars and apparently made a special version
for the Vanagon.
    SO.... in a few words, what tires do you have and how do you like them?
Our Conti's are ok, but the older they get the worse they are in the snow.
Their tread pattern is rather small or &quot;unagressive.&quot;

Thanks in advance,

Hal Roth
