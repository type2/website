&gt; 
&gt; Long article that I posted about this would be in the archives.  Rest of my
&gt; scanty knowledge is that when you lean the Rabbit engine over like a diesel
&gt; you have to cut the body a little or use a Dasher intake manifold.  Some-
&gt; one else has to help you choose an appropriate donor engine; all I know is
&gt; bigger is better.
&gt; 
I have been involved in two, on one the body was clearanced with a
sledge, on another we cut a few inches out of a standard Rabbit
manifold. Never thought of the Dasher, that is probably the ticket.
Get an '83 or '84 GTI mechanical lifter engine, transfer oil pan
from diesel, clean fuel tank, jerry rig an ignition and f.i. system
with the air flow meter box on right with a long 2.5&quot; or so copper
tube routing air over to an elbow off the manifold, standard diesel
exhaust.  Get ready for impressive results, the last one I helped with
for a friend had a warmed over GTI probably good for an honest 120 hp
or so.  The thing moved and it was a Westy, but mileage is poor, we
needed to adress the gearing but never have. Any thoughts?  BTW this one
is probably a stretch but how about putting a Rabbit 4 on a Synchro?
Could you switch the bellhousing from a diesel on to the Synchro? Could
the clutcch be sorted out? Would the Synchro be up to a good 140 hp or
so using a 2.0 liter 8V? I ask because a 80,000 mile '86 Synchro has
shown up recently for a rather appealing price but the Wasserboxer has
had chronic head gasket problems, and I figure the passenger side head
to be warped.  Dad has been thinking about it but rather than at least
$1500 to rebuild the current powerplant I had been wondering how about
an upgrade?

Any thoughts would be appreciated as I have never seen a Synchro close
up with the engine off and the Bentley manual is vague on them anyway.
