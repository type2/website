 Right, they are type definitions, not actually listed on the back of the
 busses.

Hmmm....  I beg to differ...
the fellow I have been corresponding with about the SA quad driving light
grilles has informed me that there is indeed a emblem that says BUS (I have
personally seen that one) and there is also a emblem that says either
&quot;Volksiebus&quot; or &quot;Microbus&quot; on some models of the SA vans.
