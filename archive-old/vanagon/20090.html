&gt; Wednesday driving home from work I encountered the second most frightening
&gt; road hazard in my tender 14 yrs behind the wheel. Some bozo had lost a 
&gt; 2'x8' sheet of plywwod in the fast lane. ........

Back when I was attending Long Beach State, one night after class I
was headed north on the San Gabriel freeway near the 405 interchange
when I noticed the guy ahead of me swerve, or try to anyway. He ran
over a mattress.  Then I ran over the same mattress 'cause I was only
a couple of car-lenghts behind him. I thought I was going to die. 
But, to my great relief, I was still in the same lane, headed the
same direction, and the car still seemed to work, and I had not hit
anybody. Needless to say, I was quite shaken. So I continued home
hoping that nothing worse would happen to me. When I got home, I
looked under the little car to check out the damage. Aside from some
scraps of cotton padding stuck to the bottoms of bolts and tie rods,
things were fine. I wonder what would have happened had I been driving
a bus. I did not own one then.

BTW, sorry I mentioned using gasoline as a solvent. But, it sure makes
good holy water for starting camp fires!
