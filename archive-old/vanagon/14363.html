Subject: Re: '67 Deluxe Saga continues

&gt;Friends,
&gt;
&gt;I feel compelled to tell you all about my continuing saga of the '67
&gt;Deluxe of mine which is still stranded on the edge of the freeway.
&gt;
&gt;As I explained the other day, it myseriously died on me on my way to
&gt;school.  I deduced (not being a mechanic) that the engine was not
&gt;getting gas.  (Golf Clap for Mike!)
&gt;
&gt;On my way home, I stopped, took the line to the carb off, and turned
&gt;it over a few times.  No gas squirted out.
&gt;
&gt;I had a friend rip the fuel pump off my 1800,

moral of the story.........always interchange the same parts (IMHO),
pancake engine parts and upright engines use different carbs and #'s of
carbs!


&gt;.
