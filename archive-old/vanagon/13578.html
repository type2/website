Subject: Re: Major Child Problem

        There are few things in this world more pleasurable than my two 
        sons and I working together on one of our vintage Volks.  Both 
        have their own daily drivers and have tinkered with them since 
        they started driving.  Even so, both guys had to grow to them; 
        they just never had much of a choice in what kind of car they 
        would have.  Maybe that will happen with that other middle school 
        child in the original post.
        
        On a related matter, why do I find myself sounding like my 
        parents?  They are revenged because I was always told:  &quot;Some 
        day, I hope you have one just like you.&quot;  For better or worse, 
        the older one is!  Our interest in old Volks is about the only 
        area we really agree about.  &quot;The sins of the father . . .&quot;
