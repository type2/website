Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon, banshee front pads!

&gt; Friends!   Problem-solvers!   Mechanics!   Lend me your ears!

&gt;        When my front pads wore down to the thickness of onion
&gt;skins, I replaced them with a Beck/Arnley set.  Talk about a
&gt;lot of noise!

I don't know if your kit came with any sort of &quot;anti-sqeal&quot; compound (for
lack of a better description!), but I have a compound that I use for this
purpose.  I think it's made by Permatex, and is an orange goo that you apply
to the back of the pad before installation.  I got this from my VW dealer
back when I worked in the parts department, as we had a shelf full of
supplies for the mechanics to use when repairing customer's cars.  I haven't
done a brake job lately, so it'll take me a while to find this stuff in the
garage, but I'll see if I can locate it and give you a better description.

Good luck,
Ryan
