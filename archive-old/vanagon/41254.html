&gt;Does anyone have a roof mount rack on their vanagon?  Would you recommend
&gt;it?  Specifically, any clearance problems? (other than parking garages and
&gt;burger king drive thru), noise or drag??, trouble throwing your bikes up
&gt;there?

I've sucessfully used a Thule roof rack system for carrying bikes &amp; a canoe
(sometimes at the same time) for years.  I would reccommend them.  I carry
with me a nice aluminum step ladder that helps alot.  The ladder is bigger
than a kitchen step stool but much smaller than a real step ladder.  It folds
to less than 2&quot; thick and I usually stow it under the cushion over the
engine.  For a Vanagon you would use what Thule &quot;high foot&quot; mounting bracket
and then a pair of 65&quot; load bars.  Attach to the load bars whatever mounting
parts that are applicable to your load.  Thule makes adapters for bikes,
skis, snowboards, canoes, etc.

Good luck,
