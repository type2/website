&gt;Though I'm not an expert, I didn't think they offred A/C on pre-Vanagon
&gt;Westys.  Zowee!  I'll have to take a look next time I see my 79.
&gt;Coooooooooool!

well, i KNOW that the 80 vanagons had optional a/c, cause the dealer tried
to sell me one back then.

i have a 1979 Bus sales brochure, and a 1978 brochure and they list:
&quot;There's a compact Air-Conditioner that makes traveling on even the hottest
days a really cool experience.&quot; in the Accessories section. but it's the
overhead unit, just behind the front seats. the trailer hitch is also listed.

the 77 sales brochure also lists it.

i also have a 1976 Accessories brochure, and it also lists &quot;Air Conditioner&quot;
as an &quot;additional Wagon and Campmobile Accessories.&quot;

but the single sheet Data Sheet for the 1975 model does NOT list it (but then,
it doesn't list ANY accessories or options).

anybody know if 75 or earlier could get a/c?  i don't recall 1971 having that
as an option, but my 1974 porsche 914 had a dealer installed vw-approved
a/c unit.
