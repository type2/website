Subject: Dropped Spindles for Early Bus

Disclaimer:  I'm *not* actually thinking of doing this, but ...

In the most recent issue of HVWs there is an article on Early Bus 
(pre-'68) dropped spindles (for kingpin front suspensions).  Looking at 
the photos it looks to me like they just swapped the left spindle into 
the right kingpin setup and vice-versa.  In effect, making the kingpin 
assembly upside down.  Does this have any ill effects on the suspension 
and if this is truly the way it was accomplished, how can they charge an 
extra $150 for the modification (over stock rebuilt kingpin/spindle 
assemblies)?  Of course, I know very little of kingpins and the like and 
may just be nuts.  Could you out there with this month's HVWs (and you 
know who you are) take a look and see if I'm right?  TIA. :-)
