Subject: Re: Battery Purchases

&gt; 
&gt; If the battery shows weakness over the course of the next several days a
&gt; new one is in order.  Having that vent hole probably doesn't help matters
&gt; much and I am wondering if sealing it would effect these new maintenance
&gt; free gell cells?
&gt; 
&gt; DC

Sealing the vent hole would prevent built up gases from escaping and probably would 
crack the case, allowing electrolyte to escape, essentially destroying the battery...
