&gt;The noise seems to come from slightly right of center (FIF).  When
&gt;turning the engine over manually, there's quite a bit of resistance on
&gt;the compression stroke of number one, and not a whole lot on any of the
&gt;others.  Number two seems to have the least resistance of any of them.
&gt;These together make me suspect that number two is the one with the bad
&gt;rod.

Well, this makes me wonder...I adjusted valves yesterday (only ~500-600 on
this top-end rebuild ...been working on the body) and they were all
way-out ...like .012 instead of .006. I have all new adjusters, so I
didn't worry too much about that. I also noticed more resistance on some
strokes than others. Is this something to be concerned about? 

Thanks! Joe
