Eich (pronounced Ike) rides in my '68 Bus all the time. His is a 110 pound
Rottweiler He loves the bus. I keep a scrap of carpet just behind the
walkthrough. The bus means camping, hiking, the beach, or just going to the
grocery store. In motion, he mostly sleeps. Parked, he lounges on the rear
deck-better view. He also likes to sit in the bus when I'm working on it,
which seems to be more often lately. I had to ditch the fridge/sink to make
room for him to sleep. I'm sure he'd do the same for me.
