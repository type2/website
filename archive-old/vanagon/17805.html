&gt; Yes, you must reapply frequently for it to work well.

I have to agree.  It's great stuff.  I hate it when i drive cars without 
it in the rain, the windows are hard to see through most of the time even 
with the wipers going.  But Rain-X works great with or without wipers.
And I've never had a problem with it &quot;gunking&quot; up.  It just doesn't 
resist the water as well after a while.
