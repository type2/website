Subject:      Re: Westfalia font

&lt;&lt;  Was there ever an answer to the chance of creating or
      obtaining the Westfalia font?
  &gt;&gt;
Count me in as one curious about the availability of the Westfalia font.
As I recall someone was going to locate files so that our FLPS (Friendly
Local Print Shop)  could make letters for us. Imagine the possibilities if a
complete alphabet is available!

Anyone out there on this?

Peace
Doug
