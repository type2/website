Subject: Re: Shower/Extendaroom 4 Vanagon

&gt;Ruby has a shower instead of an extendaroom off the rear veranda.
&gt;
&gt;Sunshower lives in cargo well during the day, warming to a reasonable 
&gt;temperature.  Using the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder proppenstock to
&gt;hold up the rear hatch door, place the sunshower on the skylight (rear window),
&gt;attach the modesty curtain, lay out the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder
&gt;shower grate, put your shower kit on the rear cushion along with  your
tevas, next set of clothes,  
the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder 
&gt;proppenstock, close the hatch door placing the skylight into it's fully upright
&gt;position, fold up the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder shower grate and

&gt;NB Doesn't work well in the snow, modesty curtain only necessary near
philistine
&gt;habitation, best done on non muddy surface.

  I need to know what this &quot;Schwartzwalder&quot; is. Yeah I could fake it
 but then it wouldn't be stock issue. Good article by the way.  west
