Subject: NC Busses This Weekend!!!!!!


Howdy everyone, just a reminder that this Saturday is our big camp out. We'll
be out at Jordan lake this weeke,d, so here's the information if you missed it
the first time. I've had several responses, so I hope to see a lot of you
there!
 Therefore, the Triangle Area Busses of North
Carolina are proud to announce our Late Summer Camp-Out, on Saturday, August
10th. Here's the lowdown:
Where:
  Jordan Lake State Park, about 20 miles west of Raleigh. The lake is available
for swimming, boating, and fishing, and there are trails for hiking and such.
We'll be in the CROSSWINDS, LOOP A section, which is $9.00 per site. You can
fit a couple busses and a few people in a site. If we get there early enough,
there are some lakeside sites.

When:
  Saturday, August 10th. I'll probably arrive around lunchtime.
  We can festivitate through the day, and then we'll no doubt cook a
scrumptious meal, and socialize through the night...

Anyway, If you are interested, please drop me a line so I'll have a rough
estimate of people coming. It should be lots of fun, amd I hope to see a lot of
folks there. We are also trying to organize a fall trip to the mountains
sometime, so come help plan that...
