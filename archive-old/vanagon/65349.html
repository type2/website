Subject:      Go list! Thanks Doug Bensen

The list at its best!

        A few weeks ago I posted the need for a City Water supply
replacement.  I was missing the doo and couldn't afford the $50.00
replacement cost.  Doug responded that he had a intake with a good door but
broken threads, would I like him to send it?  Yes,  I received it today and
in about an hour mine was fixed.  The door is fixed, and even the spring works!
         This clearly shows the helpful shareing spirit of this list!
Thanks Doug, Unca joel, Neil (who posted my beloved van on the list) and all
the rest!!!
