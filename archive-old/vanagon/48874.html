    Warning ! Check the Temp. Sensor wiring first. It breaks in the 
    engine compartment where the engine moves. A computer is a $600
    mistake. I have never seen one go bad.

    Who is they? Some 2 bit Mechanic that just replaces parts!
    This is why people give up on Vanagons. Jerk Mechanics that
    don't know anything. Tell him to get the schematic of the engine
    to the computer and go point to point over the wiring. HE will
    find it easier than it looks, and will also find the problem.
