Subject: NEED HELP Olympian Catalytic heater installation

Hello from frozen Montana,

I purchased an Olympian 6100a catalytic heater yesterday.  I installed it in
my Westy, but I'm dissatisfied with it's performance.  

To install the heater, I placed a flared t at junction where the gas was
coupled to my stove unit.  Part of the t included a swivel type extender.
B/c of the swivel the connection dropped from a 3/8 to 1/4 for that
particular fitting.  From the T, I ran 6ft. of 3/8 inch flexible hose that I
had the local propane co. fabricate.    Approximate length of the hose is 6
feet.  The install was extremely easy.  
HOWEVER, I'm still cold.  .

The owner heater manual says &quot;the heater is designed to operate with a
manifold pressure(the gas pressure down stream from the appliance controls)
of 10.5&quot; w.c.(0.38 psig). A gas supply pressure of 11&quot; w.c. (0.40 psig)
minimum is required at the heater controls.  The supply line must be
equipped at the cylinder with a listed regulator set to deliver the
specified pressure.&quot;


Questions.
Is the regulator on my bus the proper size regulator?  1980 VW vanagon Westy

  Is the swivel fitting that reduces the t from 3/8 to 1/4 causing a loss in
pressure? 

The heater has a maximum output of 5,800 BTU/hr.  Is this adequate for
heating the interior of the bus?

Any and all info would be beneficial....thanks for the time...

Mark
