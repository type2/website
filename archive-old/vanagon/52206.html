Subject: Help Timing Diesel after replacing head gasket

Howdy and Help,

I just replaced the head gasket on my 82 diesel.  I didn't have the
tools that were shown in the Bentley. I tried to keep from moving the
crank, camshaft, or the pump...but things happen.  I set the engine to
TDC and the camshaft, IMHO, was properly set (I didn't put a valve thru
a cylinder).  

The injector pump was a different story. The pulley didn't have a clear
mark for alignment.  There were several dents around the pulley and they
each looked about the same. I took my best WAG and set the belt. The
engine turns over and over and over...  No real combustion but there is
exhaust smell being produced.

Is there any help for me or my diesel??
