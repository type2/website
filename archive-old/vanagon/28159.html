One thing you have to watch out for when using this stuff is to make sure 
it stays where you want it.  It makes for a very good electrical 
connection because it conducts electricity.  If you put it on a 
multi-connector plug it can cause electrical shorts where there were none 
before.

When you apply it, make sure to thoroughly wipe off any excess from the 
plug.  Connect the two halves then pull them apart again and see if any 
more excess squeezed out and clean it up.

I learned this on my Rabbit when I was trying to figure out a balky rear 
window defroster.  Had my brake lights short to another connector and 
thence to ground.  Use this stuff sparingly.

Jack
