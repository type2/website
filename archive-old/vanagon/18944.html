&gt; Hello!
&gt; 
&gt; I am glad I found your list!!! It has been my dream to own an aircooled 
&gt; VW van for quite a while now. I have had nothing but odd, nightmarish 
&gt; problems with water cooled vehicles!!

Welcome to the list!  Hope you find yourself an air-cooled bus so that 
you can have odd, nightmarish problems with that!  :)  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone perhaps give me any advice on what to buy? I have been told 
&gt; that buying any VW bus before 74 is a safe idea. I have been told also 
&gt; that the type IV engine is troublesome.

Well, there's a summary of changes in buses over the years out there some 
place (Steve Johnson, you have a copy handy??) that you might find 
helpful.  The 2L FI type IV in my hasn't really given me any problems, 
and I actually hear the type IV engine is highly reliable.  Comments, 
debate anyone?

Someone refresh my memory: what happened in 74?  Introduction of dual 
carbs?  1800 motor?
&gt; 
&gt; Frankly, I am a college student who wants a bus taht will be reliable, 
&gt; yet fun to drive and dependable. Perhaps I am asking for too much? I 
&gt; dunno. Whatever anyone can offer for suggestions I would be thankful :)

Well, '71 had front disks and the rear apron unbolted so you could pull 
the motor straight out to the rear.  73(? correct me?) saw the intro of 
the access hatch in the top of the engine compartment.  75 intro'd FI, 
and '76 got the 2L motor.  78 got hydaulic lifters.  That's a start...

Have fun in your search!

Tobin
