Power steering does not seem very common here in the UK. My 84 GL seems
quite a lot heavier in steering than the 82 Bus, both manual. The 84 GL
requires a lot of effort when parking. Do you think there is something
wrong? The buyer of the 82 Bus thought it had power steering because it was
so light.

&gt; Oddly, the power steering I've got is on my GL, the lightest of my
Vanagons,
&gt; and the one you'd expect to need it the least.  My Westfalia (an '80) and

&gt; my Syncro (an '86) both have plain old manual steering, and both steer as
&gt; easily as any car I've ever driven.  Considering the complexity and cost,
&gt; it amazes me that VW even felt compelled to put it on.
&gt; 
&gt; How do other people feel?  I think most US Vanagons had power steering on
&gt; them since it was first offered.  Did other countries do this also, or is
&gt; this insistence on having power steering an American thing?  Is power
steering
&gt; common on Transporters?  Others out there have Vanagons both with and
without
&gt; it too.  How do you feel?  Any other Syncros without, or is mine unique?
