Subject: '73 Bus Trans. problem

Anyone,

Ive run into a problem. After a day of smooth no hassle cruisin', I 
parked my bus 
to go and get ready for work. As I was pulling out of my complex I 
experienced a 
major lack of power. Acceleration seemed fine but, once I reached a 
higher RPM 
it lagged. I thought maybe fuel problem but, out of gear it ran fine, 
I could reach
higher RPM. In gear is when it lags. Transmission? Clutch cable? Due 
to my busy
schedule I am unable to look at it to see the problem.

PLEASE HELP!

Rich
