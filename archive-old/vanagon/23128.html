Subject: Thoughts on my first 2 weeks with bus

Hey Now,
Well I have had &quot;Cassidy&quot; my '77 westy for 2 weeks and wanted to share the
experience, as briefly as I can.  All in all I love driving Cassidy, two
weeks ago I couldn't even check the oil, now I have a general understanding
of the air colled engine. I think I get the most important thing about VW
air cooled, that is, that it is all about oil, keeping it cool and clean. 

Had a major breakdown on the way home, was the control unit, three days of
sheer misery thinking &quot;great I spent more than I wanted to and now it is
dead. It runs great now, but I am really cautious, I check the oil level
every time I stop for more than a few minutes. I check the temp (right now
it is the very reliable touch the dipstick method) every time I stop. I
listen to her run. I think breaking down so early in the ownership
experience was a blessing of sorts, I have never owned anything but new
cars, and all I ever did was send them into have the oil changed (done it
myself now). So I have learned to listen and check everything I know how to
right now.

I have discovered the far right lane! Suddenly I find myself in no hurry to
get places. My patience has increased. I enjoy every minute that I get to
spend driving her. The funny thing is that I notice that around town, I keep
passing the same cars that zoomed past me only to sit and wait at the next
light, as I just keep rolling on. Atlanta is one of those places where the
average speed on the highway is close to 80, I have only passed one other
car in 2 weeks, and I think she was comatose.

I also have learned that there are no such things as small projects, I find
myself out in the driveway with a screw driver ( I hope to move up to more
advanced tools soon) thinking &quot;well maybe I should just take that....apart
and see if it is... Next thing I know it is getting dark. 

So on Tuesday Cassidy gets her first road trip, Atlanta to Savannah about 4
hours, it is both a business trip and pleasure. I have driven her around the
perimeter interstate loop and tomorrow we go up the road to the mountains
for the afternoon. I think she is up to it. If not I am prepared for a
cellular uplink to this group:)

Well I have taken up way to much space here, but all my friends are so sick
of VW talk, and the poor girl whom I have been dating for a month, she was
so nice to spend the whole evening last night hanging out in the bus
listening to the rain. Great sound btw. I figure you all would understand
the need to share the love, joys and sorrows of owning your first VW bus.
Peace,
Scoob
