Subject: O2 sensor light on means?

Ironically from the way back from the VW show, my OXS light came on.  
I went back to the discussion about open/closed loop, but didn't see 
anywhere what it means when the light comes on.  Anyone?  I presume 
it means either the O2 sensor has failed or there is another problem 
with the exhaust (e.g. hole).

Thanks,

-Karl
