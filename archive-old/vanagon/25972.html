To all,

In my '73 T2 ownersmanual i see this padded dashboard.
In the Dutch '75 salesbrochure VW calls it the &quot;safety dashboard&quot;.
I'd like to know more about these.
I have seen only one in person in a '68 or'69
Is this part considered to be rare in the US? or maybe
even stock on certain year(s) US models?
If a car was so equipped would that show on the M-codes Tag?
Was it only available in combination with (or without) something
else or was it part of a package?

Thanks,

Brian,

'73 1600 SingleCab.
