Subject: ICE PROBLEMS ('86 Syncro Westy)

I need help with an ice build up problem.

Yesterday winter hit us and we had to drive our '86 Syncro Westy through
300 km of ice, snow and slush.  Almost from the start,  the gear shift
lever was stiff. After 100 km shifting was almost impossible.  This
morning, I crawled underneath and found a great ice build up. The drive
shaft was almost enclosed and the gear shift linkage was caked with ice.

During this winter, I won't have any access to a heated garage. Its
going to be almost impossible to melt away any ice build up.  I won't
even be able to run a block heater as I have no power outlet where the
Vanagon is parked.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Larry
