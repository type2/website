Subject: Re: Help: broken rear spring in Syncro

Hmmm well to get the outtere cv's for your syncro I'd call bob's vW and ask
him where he got Tim Gardners front outter cv's for his 87 syncro cause he
got em for me for 220 bucks and thats exactly what he paid...he thought that
the price was outrageous so he didnt up the price at all.....hmm the half
shafts I've found you can get from acme auto....oh and if your talkin bout
the universals I put in a lettere earlier bout goin to the bearing shop for
those....hope everything goes well
heres bobs number....1413-736-3278
