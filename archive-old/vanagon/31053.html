&gt;Subject: High Idle problem, help!

&gt;My 87 Westie is in winter storage but I start it once in
&gt;awhile in the gararge to make me feel better about these
&gt;Wisconsin winters.  Well I just started it and the engine
&gt;reved to 4,000 rpm plus!  I restarted it and the same thing
&gt;happened.  No matter what I do I can't get the idle down.

&gt;Is something stuck?  I checked the accel. cable and it
&gt;doesn't seem to me stuck.

My '84 GL has done the same thing on occasion and I had to
open the hatch, remove the engine cover and &quot;unstick&quot; the
throttle valve where the cable is attached.  Last year I had
the throttle valve removed and cleaned while it was in for
service and have had no further problems.
