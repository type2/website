Subject: Syncro front brake rotors
Date: Wed, 25 Jun 1997 09:49:06 -0500

Does anyone have an old, unusable, worn out syncro front brake rotor lying 
around.  I'd like to get my hands on one to look at improving the brakes on 
my Westy.  I'm hoping one of the listees around Austin may have one.  Let 
me know.
