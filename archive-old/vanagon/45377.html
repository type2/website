2=Microbus, 3=Kombi/Camper, 4=Deluxe, 5=Deluxe 7 seater w/walk thru,
6=Pickups, 7=Ambulances

It might be also noted that there were no 40HP engines prior to engine #
5000001.  There of course was the bastard 37.5HP engine intro'd in June 59
(VIN 469506) with a beginning number of 3400000 which was quickly (and
thankfully) discontinued in May 60 (VIN 614455).

All above is referenced from the original parts manuals and subsequent VAG
Surveys and Microfiche films.

Of course this is VOID where prohibited by law ;-)
