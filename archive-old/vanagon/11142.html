Subject: Re: Useful tools (Eye wear)

If it is not too duplicative, I would like to add here, *I* would up in a
hospital with a doctor picking at my eye.  I got a bit of metal in it
while working on my exhaust system and by the next morning, it had formed
a &quot;rust ring&quot; I could see from the inside.  

First. glasses (regular or protective) are not enough.  You need full
goggles that seal to your face.  My nemesis came in from the side as I was
wiggling the manifold off. 

Second, if something does get in anyhow, get to the emergency room *that
day*.  Don't wait and you will save yourself much pain.

&gt; &gt;&gt;They are also good for using in crawl spaces and attics!  
&gt; &gt;&gt;Be sure to bring protective goggles with you when you climb under the
&gt; &gt;&gt;car so the little particles falling off the cars underside won't get
&gt; &gt;&gt;in your eyes.

&gt; A frind got something into one of his eyes under his car and suffered a week
&gt; long struggling and finally went to see an eye doc. The doc told him if he
&gt; delayed further seeing him he might need a surgery. He took a tiny rusted 
&gt; piece of metal, part of exhaust tube, out of his eye. Good advice, Steve.
