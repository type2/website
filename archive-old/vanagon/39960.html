&gt; one of my busi.  

Are you going through Texas?  Wanna meet another Safare?  :)

&gt; What kind of things should I check out and do to the bus before heading 
&gt; out and also anything special I should do when on the road?

You might want to check the front wheel bearings.  I made it to Dallas
okay, but after a heavy rainstorm one of them went out on me while
driving around town.  Seems the inner grease seal was damaged and some
water got in there.  I always carry spare front wheel bearings and
seals, because if one of them goes bad on the road, yew ain't goin no-
where!  Take it slow on the road and make sure your engine doesn't
overheat, too.  Have a good trip!
