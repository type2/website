Subject: North San Diego service

Any recommendations for a reliable Volkswagen garage in north San Diego County?
Moving down thataway on Sunday, having the muffler and center pin done today
here in Orange (we're bankrupt) County. Post here or try me at
mwagner_at_deltanet_dot_com, today is the last day the Rockwell address is going to be
valid.
