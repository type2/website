Subject: New URL, pix of V6anagon clutch (shudder)


For those who just can't get by without their regular fix of V6anagon
news, I've put pictures of the poor ol' bus in mid-surgery, plus a
few of the clutch remains after I got it out, in my home page. It's
even more disorganized than it was, with a few pictures under slightly
wrong titles. But it's there. Don't everybody jump at once...   :^)

I also have a new URL. The old one will still work for a while, and
send you to the current page. But soon this will be &quot;The One&quot;:

Seriously, It's an interesting look at what happens when Clutch/trans
shaft/flywheel misalignment bites you. At least, it's interesting after
you get bit.

Rust never sleeps. Metal fatigue does, but only until you start the
engine...

 Any Questions?
