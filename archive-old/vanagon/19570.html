The excessively speciesist Ric Golen did write:

So, you're putting down people now are you,  well! I never!
Some people even consider me human now and again and I will not put
up with this sort of thing!

But I do beleive the use of the afro-american label was neccessary
to fill in the reader as to the reason for the use of the word
&quot;Brutha&quot; in the story.  Without it we may have assumed that the
people in the car were monks with speech impediments.

Sorry for wasting your time, but it is Friday.  :)
