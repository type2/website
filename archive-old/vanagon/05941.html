&gt;After my bad experience with an inverter (mentioned in a set of messages
&gt;this past summer), we opted to purchase a generator.
&gt;We have the Honda &quot;EX&quot; unit.  Although it is advertised as &quot;extra quiet&quot; it

just out of idle curiosity, how bad does it smell when you carry it in the
car? i've carried lawn mowers around in the back of the bus, and could always
smell the gas and oil from the waaay up front. any such problems with the
generator? i've always thought that the best place for a generator might be
in a little travel trailer ... but that would make it much easier for someone
to walk off with it. especially after they see you putting it in there. :(

&gt;I'd really like to hear ideas and suggestions from others about how to
&gt;decrease the noise.

we 'silenced' a lawn mower by replacing the exhaust pipe with another one that
was about four times as long and put the muffler on the end of that. i don't
think it hurt anything (such as back pressure and that sort of thing) cause
the mower kept running for years and years.

you might also check with Honda dealers or the head office here ... i'd bet
there is a 'silencer' kit you can order for it.
