Subject: Re: Fram Oil Filters...

&gt;
&gt;OK, we all know that oil and oil filters are a RELIGIOUS issue. Here's 
&gt;my two cents worth:
&gt;

I buy almost any filter that fits, embarassed to admit that however. I found 
the dealers prices to be close enough, &lt;$2-3 more, so that I generally tend 
to get a dealer filter as first choice. There was a long discussion on the 
Porsche list recently on Fram filters, specifically that 3 owners reported 
having exploded Fram filters. Perhaps the humble VW in stock trim doesn't 
generate sufficient pressures to do this, but I won't buy them ever again. I 
want oil pressure AND FLOW at my bearings, not at the sender and filter 
only. If the filter is building up enough back pressure to pop, then it's 
more of an obstruction than I like to think about, even if it is cleaning 
the oil well.
         Can anyone comment on oil flow ('85 Vanagon) when the filter is 
clogged, or is a Fram? Does everything short circuit back to the oil return 
via the relief valve, or do we pump dirty oil to all (part?) of the motor?
