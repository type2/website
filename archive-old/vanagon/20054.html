If  this engine has some basic derivitive of BOSCH fuel injection ( and I
suspect that it does) , it probabaly already has a pressure regulator on the
injector fuel buss, and that's something worth checking that I hadn't thought
of until Dave mentioned it!  If the fuel pressure regulator fails and the
pressure goes to the max unregulated that the pump can supply (higher thatn
&quot;spec&quot; at idle), you will  run rich.
