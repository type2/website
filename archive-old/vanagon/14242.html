Subject: Red Rock--Otto Makes It! (part 1)

Naturally, I was impossibly late. After running around town getting stuff
with my buddy and traveling companion and ace mechanic Al Hubbard, I was
too tired to pack everything up the night before. So the next morning
turned into a mad rush and I forgot a bunch of stuff.=20

Anyway, got over to Al's and he was all ready to go. We trundled off in
Otto, my 1959 Single Cab, who seemed to be ready to go despite the fact
that he hadn't gotten a needed tune up. But since we were looking for
adventure, it didn't matter.=20

The weather was scattered cumulus, breezy and a bit cool as we headed
south down 101. At least the sun was shining, and it wasn't raining. The
truck hummed along confidently, and with a large load of firewood, seemed
to ride as well as a Cadillac. Well, almost.=20

After stopping at the Wal-Mart in Gilroy to pick up just a few of the
things I forgot, we tackled State Route 152, the dreaded Pacheco Pass
Highway. As we neared the infamous Casa de Fruta, we noticed a large, well
ladened brown domestic mid '70's station wagon slowly entering the
freeway. I thought to myself, is that an Oldsmobile? Sure enough, it was
Dave Kautz and his kids. Dave followed us until the first steep Pacheco
grade, then zoomed by in a demonstration of American V8 horsepower. We, on
the other hand, marveled at the way Otto took the grade without shifting
down.=20

Let me note here that Otto has a '65ish 15 or 1600 motor of dubious
parentage and a matching transmission, so perhaps doing 4 to 6% grades in
4th gear isn't so surprising. But it was encouraging!=20

As we crested the pass and zoomed down the other side at a blistering 60
mph, we breathed a sigh of relief. One pass done, one more to go. Dave
stopped at the stop sign on the other side and beyond all reasoning that I
can understand, asked if we wanted to convoy, and then volunteered to
follow. Now, I've had a good time before, but following a bus for 7 hours
at 60 mph isn't one of them. But knowing that driving a 35 year old
vehicle with a 30 year old motor and transmission over 700 miles in one
weekend was somewhat foolhardy too, I naturally agreed.=20

The rest of the trip was uneventful, including another wonderful blast up
the snow-dusted Tehachapi Pass, where Otto once again proved that his
motor was strong. We did have some fun tacking into the wind coming up SR
14, but we never actually left the road surface.=20

We arrived at the campsite where most everyone else had already arrived,
including Martha Rubin and Bob in her Vanagon Westfalia, Dave Schwarze in
Da Boat, which isn't a Westy, Scott and Alice in their Westy, Larry and
Alice and their kids and their Vanagon Westy, Sam and his wife and their
bay window Westy, Jack Stafford in his bright orange bay window Westfalia,
Steve Johnson, who kept bowing down to my truck, and his nifty Westy, Dave
Phillips from Tucson with his Bay window packed with ham gear and, of
course, Bradley =D2Prunehead=D3 Maris and his '66 Kombi. After a few moment=
s
of humiliation, Dave Kautz was allowed to park his Oldsmobile among us.
(Who did I forget?)

As has been reported before, it was chilly and windy. Al and I set up our
tents and joined the party which had evidently started the night before.
Chili, rice and salad, washed down with beer, and then strawberry
shortcake, also washed down with beer, satiated all appetites. Then
Martha left, and didn't come back for a long, long time. Turns out she was
busy hosing out the interior of her bus with some hot water heated up on
the fire and some 12 volt pump Schwarze let her borrow. She may have been
trying to take a shower, but we'll never know...=20

The wind finally let up a bit, but we were all sleeping at the time, and
when we woke up the next morning, so did the wind. After we ate some
breakfast, Dave Schwarze got the idea to drag us all up to some mining
thing. =D2It's just a little dirt road. Not very far.=D3 He said things lik=
e
that. So we all trouped off to 4 waiting busses and headed out.=20

to be continued...
