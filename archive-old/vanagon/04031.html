&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is for Martha and other females on the net (and
&gt; &gt; for any males who might be interested): 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;      I myself, being male, sewed new (and very nice-looking, I might add)
&gt; curtains for my Kombi/camper. I have been sewing ever since Home
&gt; Economics class in 7th grade.
&gt;      I also do All the cooking on trips, as well as most of the cleaning. My
&gt; girlfriend doesn't show much interest in that sort of thing. I use a
&gt; single-burner Coleman white gasoline stove. It works great. On my longer
&gt; road trips, I usually cook breakfast, have something cold for lunch, and
&gt; then cook dinner. 
&gt;      Also on the interior, I re-paneled with 3/16&quot; wood paneling, like
&gt; lots of houses had in the den. I also made a cabinet for the side door,
&gt; and custom built armrests for the front doors...
&gt; anyway

Wow! Do you do windows too!  ;)  Actually, I'm impressed with your Can-do
abilities.  Does your girl friend work on the engine?  :)
