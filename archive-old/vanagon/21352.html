Subject: What's a weltmeister?


Thats my question-
&quot;whats a weltmeister?&quot; Once I know, my life will be complete.

Its on a sticker I have &quot;Die Marke der weltmeister&quot; or something
like that.

Is Gerald going on RAGBRAI? (the only big bike ride I can think
of next week?) If so, stop by and check out my van (and take
a warm shower) when you are in Iowa City...

also, this 0lga spam is amazing. Gotten it on _every_ mail
list I receive.  Spamming technology has sure come a long way...
