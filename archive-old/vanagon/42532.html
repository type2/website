Subject: another oil temp. gauge question

Hey all,
Well, I've been told that a good place to mount the sending unit for the VDO oil
temp. gauge is in the sump plate -- the secondary one that doesn't seem to do
anything.

My question:
Looking in the Rocky Mountain Motorworks catalog, there is a sender on p. 16 and
is RMMW part # 938-838.  The description is:  Sending Unit, oil temp, 12 volt,
300 degrees, (Installs in drain plug plate w/ instructions).  It costs $13.95.
Is this the one that goes in the secondary sump plate??  If so then I'll go
ahead and order it.

BTW, on the 2-1/16&quot; VDO oil temp gauge, what color does it light up at night?
Is it white light to match the rest of the dash??

I'm going to mount the gauge in the dummy plate.

Thanks everyone,
Sean
