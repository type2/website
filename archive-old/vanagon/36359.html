&gt; It seems to me that VW has really slid a LONG way down in the reliability

&gt; Now I know a Toyota doesn't have the personality that a VW has, which

&gt; you're talking about reliability....
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, it's not just Toyota.  My folks own a 1985 Dodge Van that has
&gt; just turned 100,000 and I can't remember any time it's been down and out

Yep, therein lies my quandry.  Do I stick with the EV and VW because I'm a
loyal subject and on the assumption that it's just taking my dealer a
little longer with this vehicle to work out the &quot;bugs&quot; and that it'll end
up being a good van for a lot of years of driving?  Or do I cut my losses
before they become real fiscal losses and bail as soon as I can, taking
VW's apparent attitude toward the van as a &quot;sign&quot; and go out and buy
another Jellybean van???  Only had to fix a faulty starter on that one,
cost me 20 bucks.

Just my paradigm's ($0.20) worth.
