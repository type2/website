&gt;There is no subject Internet group for the same reason there's no Kenmore
&gt;dishwasher group.  People buy most cars as appliances, and consider us strange
&gt;for having any more connection with our cars.  I don't see Caravan/Voyager's

ha! that's exactly it! very well put. i had the picture in the back of my
mind, but couldn't make the connection to appliances. that describes my
sister exactly! :) and also explains why some of these dealers can still sell
cars. especially the ones on their lots. no wonder the salespeople get so
angry at me! ;)

you know, i wonder if the horse and buggy people thought the same way about
those folks who were buying the first 'auto-appliances'. cause you would have
had to LIKE horses to really want to keep them. and perhaps, like the horses,
our cars will ultimately be just too much trouble to keep. :(

But Until Then, I'm Gonna Chase Every Chicken Off Every Road I Can!!!! :)
