If anyone uses the 3M77, they may find it isn't sticky enough for
the applications we've been discussing - like applying velour,
wallpaper, etc.  If you use 3M90, you had better get it on
there EVERYWHERE, and perfectly.  YOu have a little time to
fudge with it, but if you miss something, you can't then 
later peel the thing off to add in the missed spots.  The 90
stuff is what they use to bond formica to countertops - PERMANENTLY!  :(
