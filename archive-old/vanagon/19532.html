Subject: /ffffriday: Racing Brake Pads for Vanagons!

Since I am a member of SCCA I often get a lot of racing catalogs.  So last
week I get this sale flyer from a racing parts outfit.  It had on the cover
announcing they are now a national stocking distributor for Hawk Brake racing
brake pads.  I looked it over and they had a small cross reference section. 
In there is a listing for 80-85 Vanagon.  Now you can get racing brake pads
for the Vanagon!  I believe they listed the Vanagon because they are the
same pads used by certain Porsches, Alfas, Mercedes and Ferrari.

They are available in two competition and one high performance street
compounds.  One competition pad is for 600F-1400F range and the other
is for 400F-900F.  The street pad is for 100F-900F.  Prices are $83.31,
$88.75 and $71 respectively.

Now all you have to do is switch to a higher temperature brake fluid and
go Vanagon racing! ;-)
