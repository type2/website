Subject: Re:  Sealing wax

Shoes and ships and sealing wax if my memory serves....

Back a couple decades sealing wax was 'cool' and you could get sealing 
wax in any card shop - looked like 'hard' candles.  I used to use 
'purple' wax.  Hey it was the seventies - little sensible to that decade 
really.  Demise of the mainstream beetle.  Rise and fall of the 'Thing'.  
Good yet bad buses.

&gt; &gt;Wait!  I thought that sealing wax belonged, like other &quot;fancy stuff,&quot; to

&gt; &quot;The time has come, the Walrus said, to talk of many things:
&gt;  of ships and &lt;something&gt; and SEALING WAX... of cabbages and kings!
&gt;  And if the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Or something like that. Quoted, probably badly, from Lewis Carroll.

&gt; Puff didn't show up till later.   :^)
