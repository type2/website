&gt; HA Martha! Not only do I produce more &quot;minutia&quot; than you on this
&gt; list...but I'm more chronicologically challenged than you (1952)!!

Ha Ric!  I KNEW you we're a little older than me. (Just ask John
Ritchie)  I'm circa 1954.  Oh well.  I'm sure Joel could tell us
stories about when he was a wee lad on the buck-board! ;)

P.S. chronicologically?????
