Bob,

I'm at work so I can look more closely tonight when I get home, but...

I'm pretty sure it goes from the PS pump itself (Not the reservoir) to the metal
tube that runs forward. Its about 12 to 18 inches long, flexible and has an
outer rubber protective tube that keeps stuff in the engine compartment from
damaging it.  I would have to guess that it has a pressure fitting where it
connects with the metal pipe running forward.

So Bob ol' buddy :&lt;)  What kinda scratch would that be worth to ya?

Regards, -Clark

&gt;&gt;PS:  Does anyone know where I can locate used; a small flexible hose that
&gt;&gt;connects from the power steering pump to the metal tube running to the
&gt;&gt;front of
&gt;&gt;a '90 Westy?  It's my current project. The dealer wants $250 for the part
&gt;&gt;alone
&gt;&gt;and already charged me $35 to 'fix' the problem by putting 2 hose clamps
&gt;&gt;around
&gt;&gt;the outer protective rubber sheath to 'stop' the leaking.  I hate giving him
&gt;&gt;business more than ever.

&gt;     Clark your return address is a bit odd, so I'm posting this to the
&gt;list too.

&gt;     Is that the hose with the pressure fitting at the pipe end?  If so I
&gt;have one that I pulled from a junkyard van.

&gt;     Let me know.
