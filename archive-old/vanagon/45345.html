RMMW does have them.  They are the generic lap belts that are attached to 
the mounting bolts.  The '64 Deluxe does have the mounting holes (in the cab 
only).  The original seatbelts have a large, threaded eyelet that 
attaches to the mounting holes and the belts are attached to this with a 
pair of flat, steel &quot;hooks&quot; (facing opposite directions so neither one 
can move off the eyelet if the belt is tightened properly).  The '63 
Deluxe has a pair (in light green) that I may use if I decide to stay 
with the period look.  I have no idea what the early belts were in the 
passenger area (or even if there were any).
