&gt; &gt;&gt; Check your plan of
&gt; &gt;&gt; action real careful before you start cutting tho, coz' you shouldn't have
&gt; &gt;&gt; to.  I often run into situations where I spend hours doing that I could
&gt; &gt;&gt; have saved with a couple of minutes of thinking. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a short update: The extension wire (the 2 wires that connect the
&gt; sender to the gauge) that comes with the VDO cylinder head temperature kit
&gt; _is_ 15 ft. long and hence long enough (though barely), even for a bus. So
&gt; no shortening or lengthening of the wire is necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a new question: The ring which constitutes the sender is to
&gt; replace the compression ring of the (#3) spark plug, per instruction. But I
&gt; find this ring to be much softer than the compression ring and I'm not
&gt; sure how much I should tighten the spark plug. I'm afraid of damaging the
&gt; sender. It just feels different. (Normally, it is easy to screw in a spark
&gt; plug almost all the way by hand and the final tightening with the wrench only
&gt; requires a 1/4 turn at most. Here, however, I can keep on turning at least
&gt; 1 or 2 complete turns, although the ring is not warped.)
&gt; So, I'd like to know: 
&gt; 1) can the sender easily be damaged? 
&gt; 2) how much torque should I use to tighten the spark plug?
&gt; 3) what's the consequence of a loose spark plug?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Sami: my understanding is that 15  feet of wire is not crucial to the
operation of the sender (I mean what if you switched to a differnt
gauge-wouldn't that be as problematic - the system I bought did not come
with wire and I am using 15g).

a) You should consider using the sender ring in addition to the plug's
own crushed gasket. The former is not a substitute for a gasket...
simply slip the ring on ABOVE the gasket of the plug

b) rotating the ring and gasket as you tighten the plug is not a problem
but make sure the sender is disconnected from the leads.

c) I found running the leads from the rubber gasket where the fuel intake
is will prevent it from rubbing on metal...
d) extra tightening may seem to be required because you will encounter
more resistance, simply go by the normal torque required (15?)..
good luck - DC
