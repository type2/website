Subject: Cruise Blues

The after-market cruise on my 87 Westy is blown.  The folks who installed
after market cruise in my 94 Trooper won't touch the Westy....&quot;A needle in
the haystack, too much time, VW, etc&quot; Another installer quoted me $300.  That
sounds steep.  Anyone with any suggestions?  Is $300 fair?  At that price I
may pass.

Thanks for your input....this BBS just saved me $45.00 over dealer price roof
vent replacement parts!

Ajax, 87 Westy
