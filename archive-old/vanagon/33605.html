Subject: Vanagon Stalling (follow up #2)

More information... before the mechanic could get the van into the shop to
replace the offending fuel pump, said Vanagon decided to completely die
before he could pull it into the garage.  Now we're getting somewhere
because at least he doesn't have to wait for symptoms.  He traces the
problem down to the magnetic pick-up in the distributor.  He still seems to
think that my fuel pump is on it's last legs, but now does not think that it
is the problem--pump is just unusually noisy and can be replaced if I want.
What it looks like is a rebuilt distributor at this point.

I'll keep you all posted.

Donald Baxter
