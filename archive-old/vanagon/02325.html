Subject: how does this sound???


So, it was an 'innocent' mistake, Ha?   I found the Sunday
Paper and checked, it definitely says it's a '91....

I would tend to believe the fat fingers theory if the ad came from
an individual, but, coming from a dealer, it really smells of rotten fish...

   &gt;&gt;Their ad lists the VW for $5781.00


   &gt;It was an '81 not a '91......

Thanks to Leo for finding out...
