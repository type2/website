Subject: 1990 Color &amp; Upholstery Guide wanted - Please

Vanagoneers,

In my work to create a Model Summary for the 1990 model year, I have found
that the 1990 brochure reveals little in the way of what paint colors and
upholstery fabrics were available.  If anyone has a &quot;Color &amp; Upholstery
Guide&quot; for the 1990 model year, I would very much like to get a copy of it.
Please, please, please...

Thanks,
Jim Davis
