Subject: 2 loves lost. Sad story

    Well Looks like I lost big time in court Tuesday. I must pay
    big $, big Attorny fees, And lost my girl, because of a real
    stupid statistic. I just can't make ends meet. So I will have
    to sale at least 1 Vanagon. I will try to sale the best one,
    because it will bring more $, and I can fix  the problem
    of the other. Is anyone interested? Here it is ...JPG
    avalible.

    1986 Vanagon GL, blue on blue, 4 sp. with Syncro lock axle.
    About 120,000 mile. minnor body damage, but still looks good.
    run perfect, no leaks, interior almost perfect, I'm the second
    owner, OIl changed every 3,000 miles. Located in PGH. PA.
    Asking $3000.
