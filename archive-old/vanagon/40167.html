&gt;The other day, after finally getting my bus to pass emissions (down from
&gt;9999 ppm in HC to 876 ppm) I busted the hinge on my engine cover.
&gt;Apparently these hinges have pins that run throught them, and after 22
&gt;years of Seattle rain (and yes, my window seals are in excellent
&gt;condition) the right one broke.  I have to wedge a piece of
&gt;feeler-guage into it to hold it up.

PPM HC reading is still rediculously high.  You need to find out what is
wrong.  I suspect loose heads, leaking valve, vaccum leak or ignition miss.
 You must check it out.
