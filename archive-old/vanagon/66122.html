Subject:      Re: D'OH (metic) fridge

&gt;&gt; Does anyone know this for sure.  Not anecdotal evidence but scientific
(
&gt;&gt; I will settle for pseudo scientific) evidence.  I recently had my
fridge
&gt;&gt; serviced at an RV place that knew the 182B backwards and forwards.
They
&gt;&gt; really impressed me with their ability and knowledge.  I asked them
about
&gt;&gt; the fan since they had some for sale.  They said that you don't need it
&gt;&gt; for the 182B (thus denying themselves a sale of a fan to me).  I must
&gt;&gt; admit it works well without it (although I haven't tried making ice
&gt;&gt; cubes).

I purchased a small fan from a camper supply place.  It works off of 2 'D'
batteries, and does seem to increase the cooling power of the fridge.  The
nice thing about the batter-powered fan is that you don't need to drill
holes in the fridge.
