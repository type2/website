Subject: Are '84 Vanagon Camper seats the same as '85?

My friend Kevin called a place that makes seat covers (the company came
from the list archives, I forget its name). they only make seat covers up
to '84 models. He has an '85 (w/small armrests, as opposed to my '87 seats
w/larger armrests with adjusting knobs).
I'm pretty sure that '84 and '85 seats are virtually the same, just seeking
confirmation from my VW brethren (and sistren).

Thanks,
Dave
