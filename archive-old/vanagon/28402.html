Subject: re: VW Video


I just got my VW video in the mail.  It is called &quot;In our time:  Volkswagen
Reborn, an informational presentation&quot;.   I haven't watched it yet (no TV),
 but think they will push Concept 1.   

I also got a paper suggesting I go down to the local dealership and test
drive a new VW.  They lure me with offers of 60 mins free on a calling card.
 Maybe I'll go down and drive a new EV, say the 54 is gettin on a bit now....

Tee hee heee
