&gt;After seeing this mentioned I couldn't help but comment, Not only is this 
&gt;a cool name for the VW mechanics, but they are also some of the most 
&gt;helpful mechanic I have ever seen. So much so that they are service my 
&gt;'69 Camper this Saturday.

Just be careful they don't slip in a turbo or Baja it while you're not looking.

&gt;Andy I guess your based around Oxford Area somewhere.

No, but I have the dubious honour of being in Team Botch, the infamous drag
racing/fish-rearing/incendiary-device-making/beer-drinking outfit that
frequents every VW event. Neal lives near there, though, and his cars can
often be found cluttering up their workshop.
