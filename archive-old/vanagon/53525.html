Subject: Re: Diesel timing tool

I made a Z shaped bracket out of a block of aluminum and used an off the
shelf gauge (one I used for setting cams and valve lash on 911s).  It's
simple and the gauge is about $60.00  All you need is patience.  You can get the
VW gauge and bracket, but it'll cost you.  The VW tool numbers are available
in any Bently Manual.
