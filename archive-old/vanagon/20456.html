&gt;Question numero uno: Ramona will have herself a set of used heater boxes
&gt;installed next week up at VW Bus Heaven and I was wondering, since she's
&gt;never had working heat since we met, just how do those funky levers work
&gt;anyways?? There are two sets of two; one blue and one red. Is 'UP' open and
&gt;'DOWN' closed?? I can't figger it out.

        Red means hot, Blue means cold (HA! no such thing in Texas!), up is
off, down is on.

&gt;Question numero tres (is this fun or what?!):I'll be leaving for my road trip
&gt;at the end of this month. I am travelling with one other person who is also a
&gt;woman. Because it's a '71 Bus with rainbow curtains, should I fret the Law??
&gt;I'm legal and 'Mona's legal, but I have this itchy problem with being asked
&gt;to step out of the car. Have any of you run into raod trip problemos that
&gt;concern local authorities?? Do you kiss ass??? Do you let them search your
&gt;van?? Do ya try fer the border?

        Here's the deal: I went form L.A. to Austin, TX last summer, via
I-10. I'm in a primered '70 transporter, have hair down to my butt, and at
the time was traveling with 5 animals. I expected to get pulled over
several times, and even left time for it, and guess what? It never
happened. Even when I went to see my sister in the air force in NM, where I
had to sign a waiver that lets MP's search any time they want to. Talk
about a weird feeling, driving a bus plastered with dead stickers around an
air force base... Been pulled over twice here in TX, cops have been cool,
only ticket they ever gave me was for no insurance. Didn't know it was the
law here... As they say on the TV ads: &quot;these results are not intended to
be a guarrantee of final outcome&quot;, but my recent luck has been real good.
Of course, when I do get pulled over, I just let 'em do thier thing, it's
thier job, ya know? I'm clean...

&gt;Question numero cuatro: Did we ever decide which gas is best for our babies?
&gt;I've been putting in regular as opposed to Super. Is that good? What about
&gt;additives? Which ones??

        I use 92 or higher octane, 'cuase I get slightly better mileage out
of it. Whether or not it's better- well, I heard it could be; and I've
heard it isn't; but I've never heard anyone say it'll hurt. What's an extra
$.80 per fill-up? ;-) ;-) ;-)
