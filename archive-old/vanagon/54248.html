Subject: RE: Ready to buy....need price advice please

I posted this to the list a few weeks back and thought it might help.

Just stopped by Royal (was Gateley) VW in Orlando. They have two 97 
Winnebago's in stock. List price? $38,500 Broken down, it's 24K for the EV, 
10K for the conversion, 500 for a middle seat, 3K for Market Value???,  plus 
1k in dealer prep (Paintguard, scotchguard ie...). 

For a price on any used vehicle I would do a YAHOO search for Kelley Blue Book 
on the WWW and use the service they provide there.

Howdy.....

We are ready to make a life long dream into reality.  We are going to bite the 

bullet and buy a Eurovan...for better or for worse....

What is a good price for a used 95 automatic with 50,000 km or 32,000 miles.  
It would be an automatic with full camper conversion.

How much for a new 97 eurovan.

Thanks for your help!

The nervious wannabes.
