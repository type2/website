Subject: oil temp?

OK, this has undoubtedly been thrashed to death, but I searched the
archives and could not find what I was looking for, which is:

What is 'normal' oil temperature for my '71?  I thought I might have
heard something like 180F, but when I drove my Bus up from Phoenix,
my recently installed gage showed a max of around 230F!  The sender
is located under the engine, where one of the plugs for the oil
bypass valve is located.

Sorry if this is a repeat, but I looked, honestly!!

Dave
'71 Westfalia &amp; SB
