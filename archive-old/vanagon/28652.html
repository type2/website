You could always try BOW-WOW parts here in Vancouver - Tacoma is
only two hours driving distance away.  With your American dollar
things should be pretty reasonable depending on how the US border
handles it...

Just phoned them - The alternator for a 77 bus is $145.65 Cdn which 
is about $110 US.  The regulator is $30 Cdn on top of that.

BOW-WOW Parts of BC - 604-325-9970.

&gt; 
&gt; Hey now, buslist...
&gt;   Just got off the phone. Karen's bus just broke down in Tacoma \ WA. She
&gt; needs an alternator and voltage regulator for her 77 bus. The guy at the
&gt; gasstation quoted her 390.- and she can't afford that. Can anyone help her ?
&gt; Where in the Seattle\Tacoma area can one get a rebuilt one ? They have tools
&gt; and can put it in themselves. Any Seattlelites with ideas ? I'm stuck here
&gt; in Oregon and can only watch...
&gt;   Can you help ???
