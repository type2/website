Subject: Baaad Morning

        Late for work...low on gas, decide not to temp fate and stop and
fill up. 
Hmmm gas cap doesnt want to turn off so well, and the key seems to stick.
Key tip breaks in lock. I yell. Fellow gas pumpers looking strabgely at me
while I stomp and curse.
        The key tip is lodged in the key opening, and I have about a teacup
of gas in the thing according to the gauge.
        So I called NAPA Auto Parts and they have a replacement(locking) for
$25.95 (CDN). Plus the guys at the shop I take it too said to stop by at
lunch and they'll get the cap off.
        Anyone have any helpful knwoledge on replacing the gas cap? Im
desperate, and am thinking that ht eNAPA part should be ok, but Id like any
listee input if you have any.

Bad morning man. Korrupt Karma day or something.
