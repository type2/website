Subject: Re: Hitches for EVs

     A couple of days ago, S.Martel and Bill Killian had a discussion concerning 
     hitches for Eurovans. I have 93 Eurovan (here in Norway they are called 
     Caravelle), and have just purchased a hitch hook, witch I am about to fit.
     
     It seems to be similar to the one Bill Killian describes, that uses the 
     same holes as the brackets for the bumper and also holds the bumper. 
     
     The bumper seem to consist of three pieces, but I have problems to get the 
     damn thing dismantled. Can anyone give me a tip on how to do this? 
     
     In addition I wonder if it is possible to just remove the center piece of 
     the bumper, or do I have to remove the end pieces as well?
     
     There was a very poor circuit description for the electric connections for 
     the hitch (not an original VW hitch), but I think I have managed to locate 
     the most conveniant conection points at the light bulb socket plate for the 
     rear right lights. But I could not find where to connect the conductor for 
     the power supply to the trailer (caravan). Can anyone tell me witch 
     conductor I can connect to in that area (needs 12 V directly from the 
     battery, i think)?
     
     Last, I'd like to know if anyone can tell me where I can get a complete 
     electrical circuit diagram for the Eurovan.
     
     Any answers would be very much appreciated!!

Changed the subject line since I got surprised...  Having both Things and 
an EV it turns out I'd have read it anyway...

&gt; In reference to your question concerning a hitch for the EV,  I am in the
&gt; process of putting a 2&quot; receiver hitch on my EV-MV.  According to U-Haul they
     
&gt; list a 1&quot; and 2&quot; receiver type hitch for the EV. 
&gt;
&gt; I'll let you know how I make out.

What is the price and weight rating for these.  I've gotten quotes for 
about $200 and about $170 for a hitch rated to 3500# from VW dealers 
around here (Northern Virginia)  Says something like &quot;d'bar&quot; on them. The 
hitches bolt on with 6 bolts - no drilling and apparently no welding.  I 
happened to see an EV at the dealer that was in for service that had one 
of these hitches on it - the bolts seem to be longer bolts that reuse the 
holes that also hold on the bumper and such.
     
I'm not very knowledgeable on hitches (obviously) so what is a 'receiver 
type hitch'?  Is that the kind with an extractable piece that has the 
ball on it? (The dealer hitches are)
