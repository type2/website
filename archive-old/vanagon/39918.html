Subject: 86 Westy Syncro, runs rough when it rains

I changed the cap, the wires, and the rotor, and though it helped somewhat,
it still misfires until the engine heats up enough and it dries off.  This is
not much of a problem during a damp day or during a light rain, but when it
rains hard or snows, it runs VERY rough.  I know that this is a very broad
question, but it seems as though you other fanatics know a lot about the
idio(syncro)cies of your vans. Help me, help me please, or the van gets it!!!
 Tonight!!!  

Very truly your,
