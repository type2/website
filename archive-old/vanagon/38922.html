Subject: Valve Adj. Procedure?

Hi all, 

This is my first go at adjusting valves and it doesn't seem
to be as simple as I thought it would be.  After adjusting the valves 
on my 73 kombi for the 3rd time in 3 days, I'm left wondering why it 
sounds like they are not adjusted properly, and also why when I check 
them after adjusting them (like the next day) they appear to be out of
adjustment.  I followed Muir's procedure of adjusting in 
numbered sequence with 1/2 rotation for each cylinder, starting at
TDC for cylinder 1.  Is there a better way?  Or are my valves in
need of replacing maybe?

By the way, thanks to those who sent helpful hints about the backfire
problems.  I think it may have something to do with the valves since
the character of the backfiring changes with every valve adjustment,
now if I could just get that right...

Cheers from down under!
