Subject: oil cooler seals

Well, my motor is going together very well, and I am at the oil cooler 
stage.  The problem is that I can not figure out which seals go where.  The 
thinner ones seem to go between the cooler and the mounting bracket, but the 
thicker ones don't really fit between the bracket and the case.  Is it 
possible that I should have all thin ones?  I think I took out all thin 
ones, and the mounting bracket sits flush on the case.  The other 
possibility is that there are spacers which are MIA and this would account 
for the thicker seals.

All the seals I am talking about are are about the size of a penny, with a 
shoulder in them.

Another thought: Type 3's have spacers, so they would use the thick ones.  
maybe there are smaller seals which go between the cooler and the bracket.

Does anyone have any pic's which show which go where?

Help!
