&gt; My fabulous collection of camshafts, I've got almost all gear pitches from
&gt; -4 to +4, would not move at $5 each.  I refused to go lower because my

&gt; holders, they'll be worth lots more as conversation pieces.  

Got a cam to candlestick conversion at home. The basic stick
is the camshaft with a couple of valves welded on at right angles
near the top, with bearing cages welded on horizontaly on the end of each 
valve and one on the end of the cam itself, so three candles can be put
on. Sounds wierd, I know but it actually looks very good and
probably would sell for more than 5$ :)
