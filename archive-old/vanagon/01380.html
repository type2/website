Yes, towing !  I too am interested in towing !  I have an '87 Vanagon
camper with the wasserboxer engine and manual transmission and would like to
know if it is possible to tow with this van.  What capicity hitch ?  What
kind of hitch ?  Who or where can I find a hitch ?  I've heard rummor that
U-Haul has a hitch for sale that fits on the Vanagon, it is suppossed to
be a class I hitch.  Has any of you out there in net land used this hitch
and what are your comments ?

Cheers,

Frank
