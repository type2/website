Subject: [F] RE: Bile rack for EV


Tim Smith spews forth:

&gt;Really Ric? I myself use a bucket, nothing like a good bucket of bile...


Tim, was that you in the Restaurant Scene in Monty Python's Meaning of Life?

;-)


Waiter:  &quot;And how are you feeling today, Monsier?&quot;

Customer: &quot;Better&quot;

Waiter: &quot;Better, Monsieur?&quot;

Customer: &quot;Better get me a bucket, I'm going to throw up&quot;



Happy Friday...


Ric
