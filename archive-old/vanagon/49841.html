&gt;I have never tried the J B weld method of repairing pits but I have done 4
engines with ceramic coating. So far so good. I have had the ceramic coating
done is a shop but I just saw a gallon pail of the stuff offered in a
catalog (Groit's Garage) for $60. I would think you could do a lot of heads
with a gallon. You can have the pits repaired, have thermal protection for
the rubber head gasket, and, since ceramic dosn't corrode ,you will have
more corrosion protection. So far I havn't seen why ceramic isn't the way to go.
