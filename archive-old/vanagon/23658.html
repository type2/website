The version of this one I heard was the Long Island Dentist who
ran off with his receptionist....told his wife to keep the
house, etc..sell the Porsche Turbo and send him half...
she did....$100.


Now I can understand my version, Joe Fournier's version...but I am
a bit puzzled at Unkle Joel from Allybammah's version. A Mercedes??
Who are you trying to kid there Joel...the ACTUAL Allybammah version

involves:

A 53 Ford Stepside Pick-up with a rifle rack, 3 original fenders,
mounted on a Chevy Blazer frame with a 427 w/hydramatic and
straight pipes, a light bar with one working light (to offset
the missing one from the right front fender) and 4 coon dogs for
$10!!
