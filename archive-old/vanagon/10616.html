Subject: Re: Coolant disposal

&gt;&gt;the yards to protect the environment.  I always recycle it if it is
&gt;&gt;anything more than what gets spilled on the floor in the garage.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;Recycle it where???  around here in the Midwest there are no places of that
&gt;I know that recycle the sh*t.  The community recycling center only does Oil,
&gt;and states in large letters NO ANTIFREEZE.  The only thing I have heard
&gt;around here is &quot;just dump it down the drain, the sewage treatment plant can
&gt;handle it in small amounts.&quot;.

The fact of the matter is, that in Canada, there are usually facilities to
recycle practically everything, at least in larger cities.  I will admit
that Canadians are much in the forefront of this area compared to the USA.
Most water and sewer authorities in the USA will tell you just what you
found out--I made some further calls today and here in Atlanta there appear
to be no facilities to dispose of coolant that deal with individuals.
