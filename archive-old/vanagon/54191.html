Subject: GEL Tools ?

&gt; Hello All,

&gt; 	I get good tools where I can, a Sears &quot;sale&quot; is the time to pick up what I
&gt; can afford for the car. I carry a Craftsman breaker bar &amp; socket (paid
&gt; regular price) for the lug nuts, and real vice grips. At the 'day after

Lately, each time I have done a major job of more than 2 hours on a 
vehicle, I have broken a tool, almost always Craftsman, SnapOn or 
other lifetime tools. Most recent was a near new GEL brand 24&quot; 1/2&quot; 
drive breaker bar, which promptly snapped while removing my Jetta 
axle nut. (I was using the 5' handle of my floor jack as a lever). 
I just got a ~ $ 70 set of Mastercraft tools for Christmas, so I 
turned to the cheapo, but lifetime warranty, 1/2&quot; ratchet next. It 
performed the job without fuss. (195 ft/lbs + 4 years rust,etc). As 
far as I can tell, Mastercraft are about as good as newer Craftsman 
tools, at half the price. 

Anyway, has anyone had problems with GEL tools, or getting them 
replaced? I bought this one since our local Sears had no stock of 
breaker bars.
