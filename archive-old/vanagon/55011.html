&gt;Joel- or someone wo knows- please let us listmembers know that you &amp; those
&gt;your care about made out ok with your tornadoes-   They sound frightful.

i'm ok. house is ok. car is ok. only one friend got his house wiped out from
over him. but they are ok. only one fellow was killed, when a tree fell over
on him in his car. 100 or so houses were damaged or destroyed, and about
50 cars.

the saddest part was the looters ... the police and National Guard hadn't
even gotten set up before people were looting the Food World (which got
smashed by the tornado) and the apartments and houses!! my friend had to
camp out in what-was-lef-of-his-house to keep his stuff from being stolen. :(

but it's sort of a you-get-used-to-it thing down here. happens every year.
like California and their earthquakes. :)  this tornado was a little freaky,
though ... cause it happened in January. usually, they don't start until about
March.

but thanks for being concerned. :)
