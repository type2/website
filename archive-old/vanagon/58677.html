&gt;oh, and where do you get a seat?
&gt;a junked Van, or you can always buy one from VW if you've got money to
&gt;burn.....  :&lt;)

I just started combing the wreckers for a two seat, middle bench from a
seven passenger.  So far I have only found one and the wrecker wanted
CA$550.00 (US$395.00) for it.  This sounds a bit steep.  Can anyone suggest
what price I should consider to be reasonable?
