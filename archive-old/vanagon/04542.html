&gt; &gt;I currently own an '86 Westphalia. 
&gt; Which means that you need reinforced tires (to reduce sway due to the
&gt; top-heavy van)
&gt; 
&gt; I have the original equipment Continental
&gt; &gt;Transport tires that need to be replaced immediately (one has already begun to
&gt; &gt;separate). I have surveyed the tire stores and they recommend ply tires as the
&gt; &gt;reinforced tires are hard to find and not much cheaper. 
&gt; 
&gt; But they can be found. In fact I'm having new Michelin XZX reinforced
&gt; installed today. They are $85 a piece. I had to call a lot of places
&gt; around town and all but one claimed that the tire was discontinued. One,
&gt; however, knew that Michelin was still producing them from time to time for
&gt; this particular market. So I had to wait 3 weeks for production to resume,
&gt; but now they are here. 
&gt; 
&gt; You basically have 2 choices: the Michelin MXL r/f or the Michelin XZX r/f.
&gt; (Many people on this list recommended against the Continentals.) The XZX
&gt; is an all-weather tire, the MXL is not. So if you live in, say,
&gt; California, go for the MXL: they last longer.
&gt; 
&gt; Sami -- 
My experience with the MXL's (actually I'm presuming it's due to the 
tires) hasn't been so favorable.  Darn van squirms all over the place 
when driving it windy conditions at highway speeds.  Two tire dealers now 
have told me that it's due to the tread pattern.  Seem reasonable in that 
the experience is very similar to driving over the metal bridge decking 
sections.  Certainly didn't have the problem with my '82 which was 
equipped with Continentals.
