No big deal! A/C condensor was NOT a factor on our 85 GL.The freon was
not disturbed when I took the radiator out to be flushed.
 Drop spare, remove hoses, remove temp switch,drop radiator. I recal
attempting to clamp off hoses so whole system would not drain. Can not
remeber if I was succesful though.

Good Luck

&gt;Anyone replaced a radiator in a circa 87 Vanagon w/AC. How difficult 
&gt;is 
&gt;this job with the A/C condensor in the way, is it better left to a 
&gt;mechanic or Okay for shadetree'er.
