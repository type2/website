Subject: Ben &amp; Jerry's VW Show and get-together


Back in February or was it March (?), I posted a notice on the B&amp;J
VW show, and solicited interest in a possible &quot;net&quot; get-together. The
response was somewhat light. I figure it was because June was still a
long way off. Well, June is almost here....

Here's the details... June 10-12, Waturbury VT, Ben &amp; Jerry's All
VW Show. For info cal (508) 568-8450 after 6 pm.

Camping is available near by.

Does anyone out there want to have a gathering of the net that weekend?

Let me know, and I'll see if I can arrange a &quot;reserved&quot; area for us.
