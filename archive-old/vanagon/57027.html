Subject: front brakes don't bleed (?)

what's the trick?
i've done this a jillion times on other vehicles -- another secret VW handshake?

i have an 85GL.  2 bleeder screws on each caliper.
i open 'em all the way and don't get any fluid no matter how much i pump.

front brakes are fine.  i just want to change out my fluid with fresh DOT 4.

thanks,
dwight
