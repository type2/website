Hello Robert.  I had this famous problem in my '90 Syncro in 1991.  
It happened to me in mid-summer while travelling across the prairies. 
It was around 25 Celcius (pretty warm!).  My Dealer installed the 
miracle harness at no charge, and the problem hasn't surfaced since.

What you are saying is probably quite true regarding poor solder 
joints, etc, being more noticable when cold.  However, in my case it 
wasn't true.


Harry.


&gt; 	Well would the above conditions be affected more by 
&gt; cold temperatures.  Would a connection m , that is to say, a 
&gt; poor connection, be poorer when the temperature drops.
&gt; metals shrink when they are cold.  Any thoughts or comments?
&gt; 		Robert
