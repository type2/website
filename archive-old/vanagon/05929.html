  OFFICE MEMO          Re  Let's go Canada                    Date:10/31/94

On 10/31/94, Ric wonders about &quot;that Carment fella&quot;:

&gt;has to wonder just what they teaches up there at that School of
&gt;International Affairs!!   ;-)

Well, Ric, judging by the name of the school and the fact that love-
making in a Canoe (how is that different from a canoe?  and what
the heck is a &quot;Panoe,&quot;  Joel?) is one of the courses, I'd say they
teach folks how to have affairs in many countries...
