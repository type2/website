&gt;How hard is it to remove the canvas, then take the whole top off? 
I 
&gt;might consider this for the summer if it's not *too* tough, then I 

&gt;could scrub (or pressure wash!!) without worrying about the 
&gt;interior...
&gt;
&gt;Anyone tried it? 
&gt;

Major pain in the ass.  The canvas is attached on the bottom with a 
million little screws, and on the top with two million staples.  I 
wouldn't go through the trouble if I were you unless I had to, to 
replace the fiberglass or canvas.
