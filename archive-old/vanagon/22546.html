Subject: '71 Bus Update
Date: Fri, 11 Aug 1995 13:08:56 -0500 (CDT)

I am closer than ever to actually getting my bus to run.  I thought I 
would update you all on my progress.  If you don't care then delete 
this already.

Painting the tin, tanking the aluminum parts, drilling and tapping my 
new intake manifold, etc have added about three weeks to this job.  
Also, paint and stuff are expensive.  Just about four weeks ago I 
ordered my carb and thought I was done.  About $450 later I am closer.
I am down to eating rice now, without the lentils. :)  One of the 
major setbacks was the fault of the dreaded previous owner.  As I was 
scraping and painting all the tin I vaguely remembered a box of stuff 
under the seat up there.  I dug it out and found a lot of old plugs 
and points, etc.  There was also one piece of tin that looked like it 
should be on the bus somewhere.  After looking through as many 
catalogs as I could find and talking to one of the locals I thought I 
had the missing piece figured out.  So I called and ordered the piece 
I needed.  It came yesterday.  It looked a lot like the piece I 
already had.  :(  So, this morning I took these two very similar 
pieces to another local vw guy and compared them to a motor he had 
sitting on the floor.  Whoops, they go around the other way.  So, I 
was explaining this to him how I had ordered the wrong piece and such.
He said he probably had one around, hell you could probably have that 
one.  He was busy putting an alternator into a 944.  Before he could 
think about it too much I grabbed a screwdriver and had the piece in 
my hand.  He looked a little surprised but didn't complain.

Last weekend I fixed that rusty battery tray.  It is not a permanent 
fix but it will hold.  I used fiberglass cloth and resin.  Not a bad 
job for a first time body man.  Someday I will cut the rust from this 
bus and fix it right.  For now I have to drive what I have and keep it
together as best I can.

I have to put on the oil cooler, manifold, generator pedestal, 
tin, etc.  All of the parts from here out are new so I hope I don't 
have too many surprises.  If I get things going this evening I should 
be able to finish on Sunday.  I have to go out of town on Saturday.  
One of the things mentioned in the books and here, and worth stressing
again, is that working on one of these old beasts is hell.  Entropy 
takes a hell of a toll on a 25 year old vehicle.  Very little to date 
has gone like the book said.  I have come to expect this and live with
it.  Of course, I am blazing new ground for myself too.  I am on the 
very front edge of the learning curve.  That is, I have never done 
this before.  Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew.  Oh, wrong hobby.  
Do you think Muir and Papazian ever met?  Anyway, if you are a newbie 
to VW repair I hope this inspires somebody.  With the help of some 
good books and the internet you can fix anything on your VW.  Also, 
keep thinking about driving to strange and exotic places under power 
of something you made possible.  Hell, if it was that easy everybody 
would fix their own cars.  Sometime in the next week and will put a 
calculator to that pile of slips and tell you all what this has cost 
me.  Including the $900 I paid for the bus it should still be 
somewhere below $3,000, maybe another grand for the tools.  Still 
cheaper than car payments.  Watch for me screaming here about my 
running bus.  Jim
