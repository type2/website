Subject: MSW plug wires

I just searched the archive and didn't get a single hit on MSW for any of 
our years of existence.  that's amazing :)

anyway.  i just bought a set of MSW wires for my '87.  $20.  those of 
you familiar with MSW wires may recall they are a spiral winding of 
'monel' (or is it inconel?) around a glass fiber supporting core 
covered with a silicone jacket.  their great claim to fame is full 
ignition energy delivered to the plugs with excellent noise 
suppression.  i found the plug end connector to fit well (gotta use 
the electrode nut tho) but the distributor end boot seemed sloppy.  
less than pleased with that.  the dist. end connectors fit either the 
'cup' or 'post' terminals inside the cap.

they aren't anything new.  i used them in the 70's when i was
running a Delta Mark 10 C capacitive discharge ignition unit with
enough energy to kill a horse.  this particular CD unit required MSW
wires to withstand the burst of energy.  the Delta installation
instructions said graphite based wires or carbon resistors would
quickly deteriorate.  BTW, i found the Mk 10 C unit to be wonderful.
 it had a 'test' switch that would bypass the CD and it definately
made for a smoother engine with it on.  but anything would be an
improvement on Italian electrics.  mebbe even Lucas.   its circuitry
produced that familiar 'whine' camera flash units have when charging
up the strobe capacitor.  only you could hear this from outside the
car.  with the engine running.  yeow.

how do the MSW work?  well, anytime i spend $ to improve something 
that already works i start second guessing myself.  *maybe* the idle 
is a hair smoother.  but i found that the original wires were in 
better shape than i expected when i took them off.  anyway, i 'feel' 
better.

they have a 'lifetime' warranty.
