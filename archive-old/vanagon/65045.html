Subject:      Subaru questions

Here in the UK the 2.2l Subaru is hard to find, and being rare would cost
more to maintain. On the other hand I have been offered a Japanese import
'low mileage' 2.0l for GB# 470 (apparently called EA82, years 1988 - 1992),
from an engine dealer in London who bought 400 of them 5 years ago. He only
has 8 left now.

I don't mind 10% less power than the 2.2, but are there other
considerations such as size, shape and fit?

What does my innovative but non-VW local mechanic need to do the
conversion, will just the engine be enough? Actually the 2.0l I am offered
is called a 'fully loaded runner', meaning it has some extra bits. What's
in the Kennedy Engineering kit?
