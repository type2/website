Hi all,
	Well after continuing my attempts to remove the rusted O2 sensor 
with Liq. wrench and the hammer, I finally got out the blow torch.  
Heated that thing right up and with a twist of the newly incorporated 
vice-grips I, er, it was free.  Spliced in the new sensor and made it 
across town w/o breaking down:)  Thanks to everyone who gave me advice.  	
I could never afford this car without you all...seriously...
