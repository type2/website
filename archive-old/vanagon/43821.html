Subject: '82 Sliding Door Handle
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 96 20:05:38 EDT

Thanks to all those who helped with the stalling problem on our 82. The
problem turned out to be a two broken wires in the Hall Sensor Pickup.
Easy to remove and install but a 110.00 item from the dealer. 

Now we are on the lookout for an early Vanagon Sliding door handle. I
know these were poorly designed - a heavily stressed light alloy prone to
cracking- and suspect they are in heavy demand. If any one has one for
sale I will gladly take it off their hands. My understanding is that VW
switched the design of the handle because of the design flaw. Does anyone
know if the fit is universal?

PS - Initially, I managed to fix the handle with copper tubing and weld bond -
that
lasted a year. This fix is good for small cracks in the alloy. But now the
entire white metal has sheared in two and the lock cylinder has fallen out.


Thanks again - DC
