Subject: 25hp and 36hp Motors revisited


        Hi All 

        I'v gleaned all of this info on 25/36 hp engines,
        from the list to put it in one file (save space)

        And no one has mentioned the spark plug wire tube,
        Is this an after market item???? 

        Any thing else yas can add to this please do!

        I've had a couple of replies on the 25hp vs 36hp
        &gt;motor questions.  This much I knew going into it:

        &gt;_at_ The 25/36 hp motors both have the generator stand
        &gt;built into the right half of the case
        &gt;_at_ The 25/26hp motors both have the fuel pump on
        &gt;the left side of the case with the big funky tube up to
        &gt;the carb.

        &gt;Now what else besides the case and the fuel pump
        &gt;and a few cc's of displacement do they 1.
        &gt;internal difference like the 1500 vs 1600?

        &gt;What is the displacement of the 25/36 horse motors?
        &gt;something like 1100, isn't it?

 Yes the displacement of the 36hp motor is 1100cc.  I am not totally
positive about the 25hp motor.  One of the things that I have noticed
about the 36hp motor that I have is the rocker arms.  The rocker arms
are the same for both the intake and exhaust.  In the later engines
the rocker arms are made at different angles for the intake and
exhaust valves.  In fact there are many stuble differences between the 36hp
and later motors.  I know that not too many people around the area know too
much about the older motors (I have yet to find a comprehensive book on the
36hp motor).  &lt;snip&gt;

crankcase.first glance...)

&gt;25hp motors have different engine tin than the 36hp.  Out of the car, you d
&gt;see a different kind of engone head bolt- uses an allen wrench.   Differnt
&gt;heads.   Have head of 25hp heads bored out to take 36hp ps and cs for that
&gt;extry oomph.  same case,  check the serial number.
&gt;  
&gt;25hp motors should have a wider fan belt
&gt;
&gt;also 36hp nut on gen pulley (which looks wierd.  )  Howver 54,55 maybe 56 id
&gt;have to look it up also use 36mm nut on pulley.   Also used was an oil filler
&gt;that one does not unscrew to cap from.  instead, one pulls off a spring tab,
&gt;and pulls out the oil filler from the case/gen stand.  Actually, the 25hp
&gt;used a 'acorn' shaped oil filler (same part number), norrower at one end, not
&gt;one with the same dimensions as the later one with screw cap (in case anyone
&gt;has an acorn oil filler kicking around in a box of greasy stuff, i would like
&gt;it please) (and a tab, which is held by the gen band bolt)  These 25hp/early
&gt;36hp didnot have a place for to take the screw that holds down the oil filler
&gt;w/screwcap.
&gt;
&gt;The vintage/July issue og hot vws a couple years ago had some good shots of
&gt;beautifully restored type 1s with correct 25hp motors.
&gt;
&gt;also, distribotr cap is flat, cords come off from the side, not the top.
&gt;
&gt;if you already know this stuff,  you spend entirely too much time on your
&gt;car.  Whats your chassis number?
