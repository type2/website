This reminds me of something I've always wanted to try on a long road trip...
You get a long reel of the thinnest microfilament fishing line.  At the end
you tie some small dangly thing, such as a plastic bug or piece of cloth.

As you drive along at 65, you reel out the line, so that the dangly is a few
hundred feet behind you, and try to get it to dance just in front of the
windscreen of a car a ways behind you.

I'm not endorsing this, but the possibilities always make me laugh.
