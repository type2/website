You folks better watch it!!! With all this Japanese art form goin'
on here today...I wouldn't be surprised if some of youze end up
at a Toyota dealer tradin' in that Vanagon for a Previa!!!  ;-)

....I think I'll hop into my EuroVan and get me a six of
SpatenBrau and purge myself of this far-eastern influence!!

Its been fun....
