&gt;What would be the point of stainless steel brake hoses for a vanagon?
&gt;If Martin Schneider sells them, there is probably some reason that
&gt;they're better.  Anyone know?

actually ... they probably are an invisible waste of money. :) but The
Theory is (as i understand it ... at least on other cars) that the stainless
steel braided brake hose (which is really just the braided steel outside of
the regular rubber hose) doesn't expand as much as just ordinary rubber
brake hose. it seems that when you really really mash on the brakes, the
rubber hose will expand and so some of the pressure is being wasted (on things
other than braking).

so the braided steel constricts the rubber hose, and directs more pressure to
the brakes. maybe you NEED this extra braking if you have a porsche 6-cyl
engine in the back! :)  but other than that, it would likely be just a 'toy'
to brag about.  it supposedly makes a lot of difference on a 914, though.
