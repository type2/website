Subject: more on bodega


The campground I mentioned is Bodega Dunes, 1/2 mile north of
Bodega Bay on Highway One.  It's open all year, is at zero
elevation, and the basic nightly camping fee is $12-14, depending
on the season.  Reservations are through MISTIX, pet fee is $1.00,
and there are 98 tent/rv spaces, with a maximum rv length of 31'.

Now for the GOOD part!  They have the following:
sanitary disposal station
water
flush toilets
showers
BBQ rings
table at each site
fishing within 5 miles
riding stable within 1 mile
propane within 5 miles
groceries within 5 miles
landromat within 5 miles
wheelchair accessible
I think one of the following two numbers should work for MISTIX:
1.800.444.7275
1.800.365.2267

----------

As a reminder, the dates we've democratically chosen are:
Friday, June 2 - Sunday, June 4.
