Subject: Re: kooltrons (was Re: STAT...)

I have a Coleman verion of this thing and have had it for awhile.

I use it in my runabout and in the small car while travel to &amp; fro for
school, etc.

While it does a decent job of keeping things cool (haven't used int in the
heat mode), it's a drainer of a small battery without the engine running.

We used it as an aux colling unit on our cross-country trips, particularly
when we wanted to bring meats and cheeses from Wisconsin. The unit work
exactly as we expected.

While this may be unusual, while making the short trips in and around the
area, I infrequently use it with the power souce and, instead, merely use
it as a conventional cooler by placing one or more Blue Ice packs in it.

Still serves my purpose to keep sandwiches, juice, pop or a brew or two
cool or nearly cold.

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
