Subject:  Tight Suspension...Too tight!

I have had my '67 Microbus for 3 years now, and have finally come to the end
of the road.  No not that I could ever sell it.  Or think about that!  (The
two weeks when I was redoing the brakes was toture not to be able to drive
it!)

Anyhow, the front suspension feels like I am riding in the back of a 1 ton
Chevy pickup.  It is terribly hard.  I hadn't really payed much attention to
it until my friend picked up a '64 bus.  His suspension feels like a car!!!
Smmmmmooooth as can be.  I immediately turned _GREEN_ with envy!

So I went to the local VW shop and got some shocks, and went about replacing
the ones that I had.  Of course I am no car mechanic, but I managed to change
them.  Thinking the old shocks were not the right type, and the new ones
would cure it sounded plausable.

Well to my surprise, there was harly even a noticable difference.  I think I
was acutally _imagining_ a difference to hide my disappointment.  So when I
hit a crack in the pavement, it still feels like I just hit a small horse.

The Question:  Is there something else to adjust!?  

Question #2:  The bus has a sway bar.  I noticed my friends '66 and other
friends '64 don't.  Is this aftermarket?  Would it make the suspension _that_
much tighter.

Question #3:  What are your busses like out there?  Am I just whiney?

Thanks!
