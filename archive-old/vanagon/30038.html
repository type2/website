Subject: Eurovan Bentley manual info

A friend of mine received a catalog from Bentley today, and it had the
following item listed in it:

&gt;Forthcoming!
&gt;Volkswagon Eurovan Official
&gt;Factory Repair Manual: 1993-1995
&gt;
&gt;Call now to be notified upon publication!
&gt;
&gt;They're at (800) 423-4595 or sales_at_rb_dot_com.

BTW: he says he knows the email address of the Bentley that currently runs
the company. If anyone is interested in trying to motivate them on this I
could get it from him!
