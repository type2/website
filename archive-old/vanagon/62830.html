          Anyone know where to get after-market replacement sunroofs for a 
          Westfalia. This is the squareish grey plastic roof on hinges that 
          screws up to let air in. Mine is disintegrating and the dealer 
          wants $240 for a new one!!! Has anyone tried using RV parts up 
          there?
     
     The skylights are available elsewhere at much better prices; my 
     FLAVWPS (Foreign Aide, 505-255-9417) has them for less than $150 if I 
     recall.
     
     Unfortunately, a PO replaced the stock unit in my '91 with an RV unit. 
     It's bigger, requiring the opening to be enlarged, so there's no going 
     back.  The RV vent is noisy and buffets in the wind quite vigorously - 
     I hate it!
     
     Even worse, if I ever wanted to park it in the garage, it's too high.  
     Even if it had a low-profile cover, it would be too high.
     
     I'm considering replacing it with an aftermarket automotive sunroof 
     someday.
