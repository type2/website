Subject: Mixing Tire Types

I have checked the archives back to the beginning and have yet to find
exactly the answer I am looking for regarding mixing of tire types.

The PO of my 91 Westy had Uniroyal M&amp;S car tires on the back with stock
Conti LT tires on the front.  The rear tires have a max inflation of 35 psi
versus 55 psi for the front.  My door sticker calls for 43 psi front and 53
psi rear.

I plan to ditch the Uniroyals, however, until I do I am not sure what
inflations to run.  35 rear 53 front, 35 all around, 35 rear 28 front, some
other combo or definately not at all.

Michael Stocker and Steve Maher came close to answering these questions in
some archived mail but I welcome the experience and feedback of the entire
list on how I should proceed.
