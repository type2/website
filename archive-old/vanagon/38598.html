&gt;
&gt;Howdy!
&gt;
&gt;Some of you may remember my previous post praising GEX (if not 
their 
&gt;product).   But due to my recent experiences (most notably my 
&gt;engine dying after 15,000 carefully driven miles) my opinion of 
the 
&gt;engines built by them and purchased by me is becoming less 
&gt;enthusiastic

Refer to my previous posting for my experiences with GEX.  I will 
never buy another GEX product, after 2 defective products in a row 
and very poor customer service. I, too, had to pay money out of 
pocket because the warranty did not cover everything. Sorry to hear 
that my experience was not unique. 

&gt; 
&gt;On a more positive note, thanks to those that gave advice, I may 
have 
&gt;figured out what I am driving.  If a Safare hightop means that the 

&gt;roof of the bus is about 3 feet above the gutter line, then I got 
&gt;one. 

Not all high top campers are Safaris. Adventure Camper also made 
high top campers, under both the Adventure and Adventuremobile (I 
think?) names.  The layout you describe does not sound like any 
Adventure camper I've seen, though.
