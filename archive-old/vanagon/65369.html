&gt; Geez, I know I'm short and all, but how do you guys load bikes on
TOP of a
&gt; Vanagon with a roof rack?? A Synchro no less??

the trick to this is to either open the slider and stand in the van
itself,  or stand on the rear tire with the rack positioned to the
rear of the van.  this only works w/ the fork mount trays from thule.
the upright trays IMHO suck because they require that you hoist the
bike much higher to get it in the tray.  with the fork mount tray,
grab the bike by the rear tire and the fork leg and you really don't
have to lift too high.  another option is to position the rack close
to the front and w/ the doors open,  you can stand on each wheel
house.  even the acutely vertically challenged should be able to load
the rack w/ aplomb.......
