Subject: VW Vanagon 

I have a 1985 VW Vanagon in pristine condition but for one small
problem--the engine.  No, not a blown engine.  The water jacket gasket on
one side is leaky, and I have taken the head off to fix, but have run out
of time and energy as I am now old where once I was young.  Your options
are thus: 


	1.  Ignore this ad
	2.  If you are a mechanic, it would be a great travel van for a 
		great price ($900), as all else is in great shape
	3.  If you are not a mechanic, but want a huge but inexpensive to
		drive van, you could have a garage fix the engine, but I don't
		know how much it would cost.

It has air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, is dark blue, nice
paint, new radials, water-cooled so it goes much faster than old buses,
and has about 90,000 miles on the car, and about 20,000 on the rebuilt
engine (always use the proper antifreeze in these aluminum engines--the
previous owner didn't, and as a result I had to replace the entire engine
when I bought it.  Proper antifreeze is Autobahn from VW or I'm told that
Quaker State is also good).  All smog legal, passed its last smog check
(1994) in flying colors, but will be sold as is. 

If interested, e-mail me at sjbarry_at_ucdavis_dot_edu, or call after 5:00 in 
Dixon, CA at (916) 678-5397.
