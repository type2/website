        This is a rider to the first note of this string.

        D&amp;J.
        Your quite right, I realized after I sent the message that I should
have put &quot;you may email me directly&quot;.  This is due to the fact that I don't
always get to a computer to check my email and I am on the list in digest
form.
        Anyone one the list may also email me if they have any questions
regarding my questions or answers to same.
        Thanks, Walt.
