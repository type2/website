Another solution to clear the windshield on rainy days without
a wiper (maybe it's faulty) will be an apple.

Cut the apple into two pieces and grease the windshield with
the apples flesh. This will allow a transparent screen and
the next service station will be reached safely. There you
should fix the wipers.

I heard this on the radio but had no need to try this.
