When I put my bus on a friends exhaust gas thiny-a-bob-machine it got

Sorry, no humour.

&gt;           Dealer  EuroParts  PartsPlace
&gt; muffler    $386     $179       $199
&gt; cat        $166     $275       $149

Did you try the dealer in Arizona that will sell us Internet folks VW 
parts at 20% over cost?  Call Bill at 800-876-5199.
