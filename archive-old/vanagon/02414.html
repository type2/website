Subject: slow Vanagons

Joel comments that some Vanagons were sold with smaller, carbureted engines.
Haynes manual on Vanagons shows 1600cc Type 1 engine in a Vanagon, which I
guess they did so there would be something else in the same racing class as
the diesels.
Relatedly, when I was in Europe (ogling every Vanagon, of which there were
LOTS -- which reassures me about the longevity of the parts stream) I saw a
few with a Turbo badge.  The first one I chalked up to the same urge that 
puts Turbo badges on Tercels and Cadillacs.  But I saw several.  I assume
that these were turbodiesels.  Anyone know more?  In fact, do we have Euro-
pean addressees on the net?
B.
