Subject: vanagon in a walk on 101

     After being city-bound for many months, the '82 Vanagon was let loos=
e
     on U.S. 101 on a 300-mile trek from San Francisco to Eureka,
     California, for Thanksgiving and it performed just awfully well, ver=
y
     much at home with the Big Boys on the freeway sections and even doin=
g
     not too badly on the long upward grades.  Highway mileage about 17 m=
pg
     (compared to 12 mpg in the city) and, had this been flat Kansas, whi=
ch
     it is not, and had Toto been along for spiritual guidance, I could
     visualize maybe 20 mpg.  This is a fine vehicle, I must say, in all
     respects.  As a result, we are now seriously plotting a trip up the
     coast to the Olympic National Forest near Canada, over to Jasper, an=
d
     down through Glacier National Park, sometime in the great bye &amp; bye.=

     Cheers, Art
