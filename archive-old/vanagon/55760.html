Bill:
The setup I have on my 86 Transporter is made by Reese. It appears to be
made for the  Vanagon. It consists of a bar attached to the tie down
loops with the hitch in the middle. It is rated at 1000 lbs maximum
towing and 100 lbs maximum tongue weight. It was on there when I
purchased the vehicle. I have never used it.
Hope this helps.
