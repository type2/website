Subject: Re: Camper/ pop top conversion

&gt; Hi, van' fans,
&gt;  
&gt; The shop guy also has some camper interiors that he sort of wants to clear out.
&gt; What would be a reasonable offer for the stove/sink/fridge stuff? What should I
&gt; be careful of? I know I won't be able to test the fridge before buying.
&gt;  

Could you post the name of the place after you get done haggling with him?
I'd be interested to know whether he has any heater parts.  Usually, not always,
but sometimes, if they squirrel away one odd-ball thing, they'll squirrel away others.

Thanks,

Jack
