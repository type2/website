Subject: Re: 'Bob'

&gt;On thur 8/24/95
 Brother Larry suggested a bumper sticker: how about 
&gt;&quot;I'm a friend of Bob&quot;
&gt;
With respect to a fellow Bob cult member, Rusty suggests:
10-4! or 
&gt;&gt; Honk if you know 'Bob' insert a reworked KdF logo with Bob written on top
of it. 

Instead of moonies we could be called &quot;Bobbies.&quot; 
bothersome folk at the airports with leaflets unite! ;)
&quot;here, I REALLY want you to have this book!&quot;- Ummm, no thanks! Really.

Heath tells me that they already have too many Bobbies in the UK.  ;)

Instead of the Scientologists wondering &quot;Gee, What would 'Ron H' do?&quot; we
could wonder, &quot;Gee I wonder what would 'Bob H' do?&quot;
Just everyone remember no squirreling, stay &quot;com&quot; and keep your TR's in
place! (inside joke, As 99% of the list sez &quot;Huh?&quot;)

BTW: 'Bob' personnally thanked me for instigating all of this B.S.
He must have meant &quot;Bob Stuff.&quot; He enlightened me to the true meaning of the
mystical concept of 'Paybacks.' The description he passed down to me used
terms that reminded me of former spouses. Mebbee we oughtenta dis-band the
cult before he unsubs and crawls back to aircldvw with out a trace or goes
over to rec.autos for some real interaction between the MENSA candidates...

Poor guy, all he asked for was a ride home from Seattle to Juarez.
Sheesh, I was just going to the Circle K for smokes but hey, lemme call the
wife first... ;)

Extra Credit: What's the term for a word that is spelled the same forwards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ and backwards?
