Subject: Re: Taking out middle row in 7 seater

&gt; I just toss my kids back there without any seat (of course it's all
&gt; padded, both in my westy &amp; 7 (5) passenger), they call it the
&gt; 'backity-back' &amp; have a ball.
&gt; -- 

As a very small child (like one or two years old) I always rode in the
back of a VW bus.  I even liked riding in the VW bug back there.  Times
were somewhat different, though.  Nobody paid much heed to safety, there
were seatbelts in fighter jets and race cars only, etc.

With seatbelt laws in many states, I don't think you can just throw kids into
the back very conveniently.  'Course Tennessee still is livin' in the '50's
ain't it?

I sure loved it as a kid, though (we had a '51 Beetle and a '53 Bus, and
this was in '55-'60).  I played with the &quot;jail bars&quot; a lot, and thought
that the rear corner windows were really neato.  I don't think our bus had
a rear hatch to come open accidently, either.
