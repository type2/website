&gt; I've heard of people driving their cars with the front driveshaft
&gt;disconnected.  Is there any reason that this is a good/bad idea?
&gt;
&gt;     Was the differential lock available on any 2wd cars?

No. Not any 2WD Vanagons anyway.  There are several companies making locking
differentials, and I've heard that Weddle Engineering, (310)598-273, in Long
Beach, CA can install one in a 2WD Vanagon transaxle. These locking diffs
(like the Detroit Locker) are generally meant for off-road uses.  They are
normally in the locked position and will mechanically sense the need to
unlock and do so while you're turning a corner.  After the corner, they will
re-lock.  I've heard that this un-locking and re-locking can cause some
unpredictable handling in curves and you must be very careful and learn how
the differential reacts in order to account for it.

&gt;     I've heard that &quot;with a few minor mods&quot; these cars can be more rugged
&gt;and reliable.  What kinda mods are we talking about?

One minor mod I can think of is tires.  For a sturdy all around tire that
works well off-road I'd recommend the BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain T/A in
size 27x8.50 R 14 LT.

&gt;     I got more, but I'll spare you.  Many thanks!

Keep 'em commin.
