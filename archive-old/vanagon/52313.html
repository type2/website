Subject: Re: 87 Help AGAIN

Tonya, I'm no expert, but it sounds like a couple of things are going
wrong to me.  That little trick its doing after running for a while then
quitting sounds like it might be a catalytic converter (and i've noticed
at least one other list member suggest this).  have you tried this?  You
could test that theory easily enough by removing it for a month or so. 
just a thought.  I too replaced my coolant temp sensor thinking it would
run better at startup, but it only runs marginally better, so I've go to
do some more digging around.  but I'd try to get rid of that cat.
converter for a while and see how it runs.  If its dead, so is the van. 
Does the exhaust smell real bad when its nice and hot?

Also, where do you live?  I'm originally from Shreveport.  You keep
running back and forth to Red Stick, so I was just wondering.  (and I
wouldn't think anyone in LA or MS or wherever you live would be able to
tell you were motoring around without the cat. converter)

&gt; Hi again.  Well, after 3 successfull trips, my vanagon decided to die
&gt; again.  Apparently the coolant temp. sensor didn't do the trick.
&gt; 
&gt; Latest:  Yesterday after returning from Baton Rouge, van had been
&gt; running the roads for about 4 hours, it kinda acted up.  Stopped at DMV
&gt; to turn in a license plate off Beetle, when I started the van back up,
&gt; it idled rough and didn't like me touching the gas.  I put it into drive
&gt; and let it coast for about 10-15 yards.  It then magically recovered and
&gt; operated normally all the way to the post office.  When I got back in
&gt; the van and started it back up, it did it again, and again recovered
&gt; after I put it in drive and coasted 10-15 yards.  This was with a warmed
&gt; up engine--guage had needle right over light where it normally is when
&gt; warm.  Behaved perfectly after each of these little episodes.
&gt; 
&gt; Today--Engine completely cold, start it up and it idles very rough.
&gt; Actually it sounds good for about 2 seconds with rpm at 1000, drops rpms
&gt; nearly dies chugs chugs chugs shakes rattles &amp; rolls for 2-3 seconds,
&gt; back to smooth 100 rpm for 2 seconds, shake rattle &amp; roll, smooth, etc.
&gt; Cycle continues until rpms drop too low and it kills.  If I step on gas,
&gt; it will increase rpms then shake rattle &amp; roll &amp; die.  Tried putting it
&gt; in gear and going up and down driveway to see if it would fix itself
&gt; like yesterday, but it wouldn't.
&gt; 
&gt; List of what has already been done:  NEW--temp. coolant sensor for FI,
&gt; O2 sensor, air intake sensor, air intake boot, ignition coil, rotor,
&gt; distributor cap, plug wires, vacuum lines, fuel pump, fuel filter, and
&gt; has the air intake sensor harness as per technical bulletin installed.
&gt; I've checked all the wiring twice already, but am going to do that again
&gt; as well.
&gt; 
&gt; HELP!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone,
&gt; Tonya
