Subject: Westy Tent WWW page update

[delurk]
Just wanted to announce that my Westfalia Tent WWW page now has gifs, for 
you gooey folks out there.  The URL's:

http://freenet3.scri.fsu_dot_edu:81/users/joeclark/pages/tents.html

also a gif of a waterborne beetle one level up from that.  Go to my 
homepage in the .sig below and click the VW link if interested.

Thanks!  Great list.

Joe
