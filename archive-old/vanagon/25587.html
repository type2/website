&gt;doesn't work it's way around to the locking point.  Derek, Tim Smith, What's
&gt;your experience on this point?

Center diff lock is a bowden cable. A cheap alternative to the fancy viscous
coupling that we have. The left position is for the front diff lock. The
wiring for the front diff lock indicator light is already in your vehicle.
If you crawl up under there you will see a plug just dangling there.

I installled the vacume lines and switch for the front diff lock in August
and plan on installing the front diff itself with locking capability soon.

You have to turn the vehicle some to get the locker to lock.


&gt;It's been my experience that airing down to 20PSI won't gain you much.  I've
&gt;found that 12-14 PSI seems to help alot.  One rule-of-thumb I've heard is to
&gt;air down until the sidewall height is 1/2 of it's normal height.  This was
&gt;around 12 PSI for my old Bridgestone All-Terrains.  I haven't measured it yet
&gt;on my Goodrich ATs.

This is correct.

&gt;
&gt;O.K. enough! enough!  I can't stand to hear any more about all this off-road
&gt;fun while my Syncro is broke!  :-(
&gt;

Why broke?
