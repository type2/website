Hi Dan &amp; Tim,
Thanks for the tips.
In answer to your questions:
The problem with the pre-ignition started recently, i.e. long after the =
engine rebuild.
I use 98 octane leaded fuel, the highest grade available over here.
Yes, the timing was set correctly according to the official VW workshop =
manual (crank case ventilation removed and plugged, idling stabilisor =
disconnected, leads from DLS disconnected and plugged together)

Your tip concerning NOx was interesting. I'll see if I can beg, steal or =
borrow a gauge from somebody.

Any more ideas out there from anyone? All tips gratefully received.
Best wishes, Harley Thomas
