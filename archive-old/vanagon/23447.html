But daaaad, he punched me first!!! =)

&gt; propane needs an air/propane mix to ignite.  it will NOT travel up in 
&gt; a line and ignite the tank.  

Of course not.  Otherwise, your tank would explode the first time you
lit your stove.

That is correct.  So, given this, and the fact that all propane powered
devices are supposed to have a mechanism to shut off the gas if the
flame blows out,, I *still* see no reason not to run with the propane on
while driving.  The only  reason I have heard that makes any sense is
the &quot;lit flame in the gas station&quot; argument.  I'm only arguing this out
of principle - I don't even have a propane fridge.  But, I agree with
Dave Garth when he says to do what ever makes you feel comfortable...
