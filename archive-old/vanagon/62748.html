Subject: Would like some advice on a problem

  Hello all!  I am mailing this to the list even though I am not a current
list member in hopes that someone who knows or has gone through this problem
can help me.  Please email me directly so I can use your words of wisdom and
get back on the road!
  Last week my '86 Westy GL stalled after 45 minutes of highway driving and
would not start.  I discovered the engine was not running as I coasted up to
the stop sign at the exit .  It wouldn't restart so I pushed it to the side,
wiggled all the spark plug and fuel injector wires, checked the oil and
coolant levels (both OK), and scratched my head.  The day was warm but not
hot, and the engine had been running its normal
needle-on-the-LED-in-the-center-of-the-temp-gauge temperature.  I took off
the gas cap and got no 'whooshing' of air in or out.  I had noticed a tiny
'hesitation' or power drop around 3000 rpm every so often--like one cylinder
didn't fire once--but this was very infrequent.  About 15 minutes passed so I
tried to start it and everything was fine!    
  After reloading the luggage and driving for another 15 minutes the problem
resurfaced.  This time I noticed that when RPMs dipped below 3000 or so, it
felt like the ignition had simply been turned off.  It seemed like somehow I
wasn't getting spark or gas, so in a vain effort to get to where I was going,
I stomped on the gas.  To my surprise the engine sluggishly came back from
the dead!  As long as I kept above 3000 rpm I could keep going.  The engine
seemed less and less willing to do this the longer I drove, possibly since it
began to run on the warm side (the front cooling fan was kicking in) due to
the higher sustained rpms.  Later that evening I finally made it to my
destination (after several unplanned stop-and-waits), and checked all the
levels again.  Everything was fine, except for the driver.  We stayed
overnight.
  On our return trip the exact same thing happened.  Fine for 45 mins-1 hour,
stalled unless I stomped the gas, gradually getting hotter and stalling more
readily until it really quit and I got someone to tow me the last 3 miles. 
  So I need some help diagnosing the problem.  Is it injectors?  Fuel pump?
 Ignition system?  A bad sensor?  The computer?  Where should I start?  Has
anyone experienced this before?
  Last bits of info:  I have noticed a small coolant leak from the left side
of the engine, but don't know if this is related.  Also I had 1 occurance of
this 'stall' about 1 month ago, but we were at our destination and didn't
have any problems on the way home.  Then we went on a 2-week-long, 3500-mile
trip through Wyoming and Montana with 95 degree temps and very long
drives--and never, ever had any problem at all!!  I am stumped and don't want
to drive far enough to make this happen again, so I hope someone can help.
  Thanks for your words of wisdom in advance!
