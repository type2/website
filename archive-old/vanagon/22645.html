Subject: Add Another Syncro

Change the stats Joel !  My wife and I are the new owners of a '87 Vanagon GL Syncro
with 44,000 miles on it !!!  ( I am farely new to the list and haven't been posting until now.)

Over the next few months I'll be turning it into a camper using as many original camper
components that I can find.  I would have liked to have found a Westy Syncro but after
hearing of others on the list having a hard time finding them I thought it might take me
even longer because of where we live (northwestern Minnesota).  So, when I ran across
this low mileage GL Syncro I thought we could turn it into a camper instead.

If I can't find all the parts we want within 3 months I may be posting an offer to
trade our '87 Syncro for an '88 or newer 2WD Westy or Weekender.

If anyone is interested right now please let yourself be known.

'87 Vanagon GL Syncro (soon to be camper)
'91 GTI
'81 Rabbit Pickup Turbo Diesel
'85 Audi 4000 Quattro
