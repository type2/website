Subject: Re: Fwd: [Q] : cut wheel wells

Just got my free copy of the &quot;Old Bus Review&quot; NEATOs' great
newsletter... Great, 'cept for one thing... This is the NOV/DEC issue
and right in the middle is a short article on &quot;How to make room for
those Big Cooling Tires&quot;, in other words &quot;How to cut your wheel
wells&quot;... I hope this was a joke...! if it's not, God save us from the
Bus Mutilators!!!

	I'm right in the middle of restoring a bad case of &quot;Big Tire-itis&quot;, on
an otherwise pretty pristine '66 Panel that my buddy just bought for
$800 ( it was advertised on the Epage Internet Classifieds web site)...
the other thing we're dealing with are the CRAPPY Dealer installed
Aluminum framed &quot;Camper&quot; windows... 3 down the drivers' side and 2 in
the cargo doors... 

	Anyone in the Northeast have an idea where I can find a full drivers
panel ( rocker to rain gutter, just behind the front door to just in
front of wheel well) for a Panel Van???


		aren't POs fun...??  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
