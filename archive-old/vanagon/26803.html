&gt; &gt;Glad to hear that New Jersey isn't the only benighted state as far as
&gt; &gt;pronunciation.  Buena, NJ is Byoona, and Bogota, NJ is B'GOta.

&gt; 
&gt; So is Ohio.  Newark is pronounced Nerk.  Lancaster is Lankister.

In California most people get the pronunciation correct for instance San 
Jose' is pronounced San Hose' However the one thing that perplexes most 
people from California is the double l.  I live on a street called &quot;Calle 
Avellano&quot; (pronounced &quot;Caye' Aveyano&quot; ) but unless I pronounce it &quot;Caley 
Avelano&quot; No 
one knows what I am talking about.  Texas also has this problem and they 
call Amarillo &quot;Amarilaw&quot; and armadillos are called &quot;armadilaws&quot;.
