Subject: Re: Removing tie rod ends?

&gt;To all,
&gt;
&gt;I am trying to remove the drag link from my 74 Westy, but the front 
&gt;tie rod end is being a real pain.  I can't get the right angle to 
&gt;knock it out with a hammer.  Are there any homemade tools that you 
&gt;all have come up with for popping the tie rod end out of the drop 
&gt;arm?  Are there any other suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

HI AARON
The way to remove tie rod ends is to take a hammer and strike the end of the
drop arm (at the ring of metal where the tie rod is held). Make The blow
perpendicular to the part of the tie rod that goes through the hole. You may
need to give it several healthy hits, but it should pop right out.  Doing
this distorts the tapered hole for a moment and pushes the tie rod end out.
Don't hit the end of the tie rod end trying to push it up out of the hole,
You'll just screw up the tie rod end.
