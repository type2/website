Subject: aftermarket gauges

I've always contented myself with inexpensive (JCWhitney) gauges, figuring that
what I'm looking for is not absolute numbers but relative, assuming that the
gauges go in at a time when the engine is &quot;known good&quot;.  Gauges are a doable
project for a light duty mechanic, although it may take a couple trips to the
parts store(s).  Getting the VW oil pressure sender out of its den takes a
big socket and/or patience.  Then you need to put a four-inch long pipe in its
place to get up above the sheetmetal so you can put a tee on.  I would recom-
mend keeping the oil pressure sender, with its red light.  I don't trust my
level of attention to gauges to be as minute-to-minute as it should be.  Any-
way, with the pipe in place of the oil pressure sender you need a new big
grommet, or the oil pressure sender's grommet with some silicone goop, to 
keep a good airseal.  While you're in there, make sure all four spark plug
leads have good seals.  What VW gives you for those are useless.  I cut the
center out of beefy domed aftermarket plug seals sold for Type 1 engines, but
there are probably other good grommets that would fit.

Where do people put the gauges in a Vanagon?  I've got the Porsche engine's
gauges way over in front of the passenger, east of the lighter plug.  A two-
inch tach fits in the unused center portion of the dash cluster, although it
looks a LITTLE weird because it is too deep to fit flush.  Other ideas?
