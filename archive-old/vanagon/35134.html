&gt;Also, however, my slave shaft is motionless
&gt;until the clutch pedal is 2/3 towards the floor, but Larry's starts moving
&gt;almost immediately as the pedal is depressed.
&gt; 
&gt;We tried bleeding the clutch using the valve on top of the slave cylinder, but
&gt;we never *did* see any air come out, with fluid emerging on the first clutch
&gt;depression.  Does this mean anything?  After all, Bentley mandates and some on
&gt;this list have recommended using a power bleeder - what is this thing and
&gt;should I use it if I really want to be sure the system is air-free?

I've had no problem bleeding without a power bleeder. However, note that
the connection in the brake fluid reservoir, to the clutch circuit is
very high up 9on the right side). Before noticing this I got air in the 
system during the bleeding. You have to keep the fluid topped up carefully 
in order to avoid this. My guess is that the clutch circuit connection is 
placed this high to leave a lot of fluid left for braking, even if the clutch 
circuit breaks.

Another possibility: Did you make sure you bled the system thoroghly?
I use a clear brake fluid, so I can see the shift from old contaminated
brown stuff, over light brown, to completely clear. The clutch circuit 
holds a lot of fluid, especially in the fairly thick &quot;feed&quot; line from
the reservoir to the master cylinder.

For the &quot;Idiot&quot; thread: This happened when bleeding the system last fall 
(before our two month trip down south). My SO was pumping and topping
off the container. I was under, opening and closing the nipple and watching
the color of the brake fluid. We used Castrol GT-LMA, which is clear,
so I would have her pump until what came out was nice and clear.

The clutch and the rear brake circuit went fine. Took just a few minutes.
So did the front driver side. But on the last one, the passenger side,
she kept pumping and pumping, and I filled up jar after jar of still
brown brake fluid. At last she complained that we had almost no
more brake fluid to fill up with. I came up and looked. THE RESERVOIR
WAS FILLED WITH ALL BROWN STUFF. Doh! While doing the last one, she
had used up the first quart of GT-LMA, and opened another. This one
was not clear as I was used to, but BROWN.
