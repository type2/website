Subject: Re: gauges for a Vanagon

&gt;Anyway, the problem with the Vanagon dash is that there's not any good
&gt;place to put extra gauges. I could put them to the right of the radio,
but
&gt;then they're out of my line of sight. I'm thinking of one of the 2 or 3

&gt;gauge clusters that RMMW sells mounted on top of the dash, over the
speaker
&gt;grille so I can still use my ashtray (I don't smoke but it makes a
handy
&gt;change holder). How do those gauge pods typically mount? Screws?
&gt;Adhesive?

I mounted my three gauges (oil temp &amp; pressure, voltmeter) in an
enclosed pod that sits on top of the normal instruments, right in front
of me--I don't have to look to the side or anything to see the gauges. I
used 2 small screws to mount the pod. Had to drill a hole through the
top of the instrument cover to run the wires to the gauges. The only
thing I don't like about this setup is that there's a reflection on the
windshield of the lighted gauges at night. It's annoying enough that I
throw a bandana or something over the gauges to cover them. Then I have
to peek under the bandana every now and then. Someday I'll find
something to shade the reflections without blocking my view of the
gauges.
