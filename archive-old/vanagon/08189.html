&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Alas, I have a 1-wire sensor (1985 Vanagon) do they sell this item as well?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't know, but I think that the stock sensor is cheap enough that looking for
&gt; &gt; an alternative isn't necessary.  Maybe this is wrong.  The stock three-wire is
&gt; &gt; $120 at my FLAPS, vs $65 for the hack.
&gt; 
&gt; I paid $24 for a &quot;hack&quot;
&gt; 
So what's the consensus of opinion.  Since I have the one-wire connector, 
is the Ford dealer out?  I definitely want to stick with Bosch equipment 
so the aftermarket suppliers are out.  Is the Ford part cheaper than the 
VW issue part?  Is the Ford part a three-wire or one wire?

Should I worry about this after I find out what the oil pressure 
situation is?
