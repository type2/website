Subject: Junkyard Vanagons

In doing a search for a rack and pinion unit for the leaking Syncro I haven't
fpund one yet but I did find other Vanagons in the Minnepolis-Saint Paul
area.  They are

All Star  (612) 436-1168  4 Vanagons  1 Westfalia

Han's Foreign Car Parts, 300 Broadway Street West, Osseo, MN  (612) 425-4561.
 Tey said they had a few Vanagons.

Will post more when I find them.
