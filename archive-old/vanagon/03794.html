Subject: Wiring for gas heater


Hello all!

I'm a newbie to both this list and to the joys of VWs.  Bought a '76 
pop-top the other week and am fixing it up for an extended trip my partner 
and I have been dreaming about for a while.  

because we are planning to visit Eastern Canada in Feb-March (Why? Just 
because!) we're gonna need a little more heat than the heater boxes are 
likely to give us.  I pulled a complete gas heater out of a bus in a 
junk yard last weekend and everything makes sense except for two wires 
which were cut by whoever took the engine out.

OK.  So all the wires on the heater lead back to other components on the 
except for two blue wires with contacts attached to them and the two cut 
wires: one red, heavier gauge, with a fuse; one light grey with a faint 
brown stripe.  These last two were, as I say, just cut clean off.  

What are these wires for?  Particularly the grey one--I can't see what 
that would be for.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

T.
