Subject: Cross-bred cars (was: Busses for sale)



&gt; The later bay window buses shared an engine with the 411,42 and
&gt;VW-Porsche 914/4.  Since the 914/4 was a 'vw' in Europe but a 'Porsche'
&gt;over here obviously having the same engine makes it a 'Porsche' Engine.
&gt;Couldn't very well expect the Porsche to have VW engine could we ;)
&gt;
&gt;A dealer used the Porsche engine bit on my father in '72 when he bought a
&gt;Westy.


When shopping for a car once, A dealer dismissed (contemptuously) an
'80 Dodge Omni, saying it was &quot;a foreign car&quot;. Didn't bother calling him
on it, already knew it had an engine from-- you guessed it-- Volkswagen.
Best part of the car! Too bad Lee didn't import the rest of the car from
the same company-- then Consumer Reports wouldn't have had to rate it
&quot;Not Acceptable&quot; from the get-go, due to its sh*tty emergency handling
(they liked the engine!).

Such automotive cross-dressing is hardly rare. If you bought a Chrysler
LeBaron, Nissan Maxima, Ford Taurus, or several other cars during the
late '80's - early 90's, with the 3.0 liter V6 engine, you got a
Misubishi under the hood!

A very nice engine, actually. Still availale in some non-Mitsu models
(as well as Mitsubishis themselves, of course). That same Consumer
Reports mag top-rated the LeBaron/Diplomat, mostly due to the reliability
of its engine, which they pointed out was made by Mitsubishi.

With the constant demand for more power in later models, some manufacturers
have migrated away from the Mitsu 3 liter.

In the '80s, many chevettes came with Toyota Corolla engines. They proved
far more reliable than the original Chevette engine, and became the
darlings of &quot;Lease-a-Lemon&quot;-type rental agencies everywhere, due to
their low maintenance and repair requirements.

Now it's getting crazy, of course. Is a Nova a Chevrolet or a Toyota?
Is a Probe a Ford or a Mazda? How about a Navajo? Is a Passport a Honda
or an Isuzu? Hyundai/Kia?

In the '60s, Chrysler imported a line of 4-cyl British sports cars from the
Sunbeam company of England. In '65, Sunbeam brought out a new model.
Same basic body as the 4-cyl, but with a V8 engine, and a chassis setup
engineered by Carroll Shelby. A terrific little hot rod, which sold like
hotcakes, until Chrysler found out that the V8 engine was bought from Ford!
The entire line was dropped soon afterward.

Anyone have any other such stories? These are all true!
