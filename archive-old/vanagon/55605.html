Subject: Re: Year Vanagon Stoped?

Hi Kyle,
here in Germany they are starting to stop making the Vanagon (T3) in
1990 in 91-92 they only sold the synchros versions, because the synchro
version of the Eurovan (T4 we called it her in G.) first sold here was
in 93, the first normal Eurovan came out at 1990.
