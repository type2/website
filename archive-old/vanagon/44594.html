Subject:       Re: Summary on Tire Comments, etc

&gt; the following is what i've heard so far on tires...specifically the 
&gt; 185/80r14 that i'm considering:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) They'll do fine go for it.
&gt; 2) Will fit perfectly since it's close to the original tire size (185/82/r14)
&gt; 3) they'll be fine as long as they are rated at 1500 pound carrying 
&gt; capacity.
&gt; 4) this size won't fit.
&gt; 5) they will over-rev your engine on the highway and your better going 
&gt; with a 195/75 or 205/70.

Haha.  You don't need 205/70's!  That's what I had on my Quattro, 
too wide for what your needs are (unless you are drag racing a lot?)

If you know the size and specs of the original tire (from the manual) 
take that to your tire dealer and ask for a comparible tire.  Simple 
as that.  Or post everyone's private mail to the list and we can make 
fun of them.  (Something to do on Friday... :-P )
