Subject: Phoenix Bug-O-Rama XX

Are there any list members planning on attending the Bug-o-Rama in Phoenix
on Saturday, Nov 4? I plan on being at the show parked in the swap area.
Look for a &quot;unique&quot; red oxide primered quasi-early single cab.

Rough details:
Friday   Nov 3   Road Rally  Wolfsburg Registry (local club) 
Saturday Nov 4   Bug-o-Rama XX Firebird Raceway, I-10 and Maricopa Road
Saturday Nov 4   Usual gathering of hard cores at &quot;The Pavillions&quot; shopping
                 center Pima Road South of Shea Blvd (Scottsdale)
Sunday   Nov 5   Some kind of gathering in an attempt to break the record for
                 most VWs in a line (basic excuse for a picnic me thinks). Get 
                 details at Bug-o-rama.

Rusty will call it &quot;enough&quot; with the Bug-o-Rama swaps.
