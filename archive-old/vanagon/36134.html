Subject: (long)VW electric conversion &amp; book story

Hey there,

        I recently came across Jon LeGrand's web page:

        http://www.geo.arizona_dot_edu/home/sacct/jlegrand/webpage/jon.html

which describes his conversion of a '72 bus to electric power.  About the
same time Martha reported on the Thing list, where various transplants have
been discussed, that there was a &quot;VW EV [electric vehicle] Conversion
Manual&quot; being sold by one of her favorite companies (Jade Mountain,
http://www.indra_dot_com/
jade-mtn).  I decided to order it.  I didn't really know much about
electric vehicles &amp; electric conversions, so I was interested to learn
more.  And a book about air-cooled VW conversions?  Cool!

        The book arrived last week.  I promptly returned it the next
morning for a refund.  I've attached my email correspondence w/ Jade
Mountain at the end of this message.  You can get a more detailed
description below of how lousy the (a-hem) &quot;book&quot; was.  To make a long
story short, I'm getting my $$$ back and they're going to quit selling the
book!

        Still interested in electric conversions, I searched a bit more.
There are a few web links which you can chase down via Jon's page.  I
dialed up the local public library and found about a dozen relevant titles,
about half of them available.  I had Friday afternoon free, so I picked up
several:  Brant's &quot;Build Your Own Electric Vehicle,&quot; 1994; Marsh's
&quot;Electric Vehicles Unplugged!,&quot; 1991; and Perrin's &quot;Solo:  Life with an
Electric Car,&quot; 1992.  I finished reading &quot;Solo&quot; last night.  It's a fun,
light read and I think it gives you a bit of a feel for what operating an
electric-powered vehicle might be like.  You know, something different from
just reading specs.

        After leaving the library I took a detour by a used book store w/ a
fair sized collection of auto books.  The spine of one peeked out at me:
&quot;How to Convert to an Electric Car.&quot;  I pulled it out; guess what the two
cover pictures were?  An upright 1600DP and an electric motor.  Heh.  $5.
Sold!  The authors are Lucas &amp; Riess, 1980.  It contains legible drawings,
circuit diagrams, detailed electronic component parts lists and even
printed circuit layouts so that you can make your own printed circuits if
you like.  The mechanical drawings, for the most part, say things like:
&quot;Dimension A for Renault, B for Volkswagen.  Other cars similar.&quot;  This
book is definitely VW-friendly.  However, I should offer one caveat:  their
conversion eliminates the clutch.  You have to drive as though you had a
broken clutch cable!  The Kaylor conversion (see the details of his
terrible &quot;book&quot; below) incorporates a clutch.  Oh!  Remember that an
electric motor doesn't need to &quot;idle&quot; at stoplights.  You just keep it in
gear.  Hmmm, I wonder how big of a deal not having a clutch is?  It would
make the conversion simpler &amp; cheaper; I suppose it would depend on what
kind of driving you'd do with the converted car and the flexibility of your
motor.

        I've learned a few general things about EV conversions that might
interest folks.  You usually end up with about twelve to eighteen batteries
with a total weight of about 1/2 ton.  The motor is about 100lbs, give or
take.  Oh, and the third major component is the charge/control circuitry.
Most of the latest conversion books recommend a light pickup truck for a
conversion since it is light and is built to carry loads (read: batteries).
Useful ranges for typical conversions are about 60miles or so, so that
means 30miles out &amp; 30 back.  Takes all night to recharge fully.  If you go
much over ~50mph your range will suffer, and hills take a heavy toll.  They
can be designed with regenerative braking so that the motor acts as a
generator when you want to slow down, or in some cases separate alternators
are installed.  A &quot;hidden&quot; cost is the replacement of the batteries about
every 3 years at a cost of about a thousand dollars.  This depends a bit on
how you drive:  the more often you drain them deeply, the shorter their
life.  Charging costs?  A typical converted car gets about 3 miles to the
kWh; check your local rates.  If you add several solar panels to the top of
the car, you can extend your range by like 5% or so.  And they're
expensive... we're *not* talking about those JCW 50mA units!

        It seems to me that a pre-'68 microbus would make an ideal
conversion vehicle.  Mark Janello was kind enough to pass on this info:

&gt;1200 Transporter (1955-62):
&gt;Panel van (with driver) 2282 lb., payload 1830 lbs.
&gt;Kombi (with driver and seats) 2469 lb., payload 1643 lb.
&gt;Permissible front axle load is 2094 lbs., rear axle 2238 lbs.
&gt;
&gt;The 1500 buses (1963-7) weigh a little more (about 50lbs), but the total
&gt;allowed weight is the same, so the payload is that much less.
&gt;FYI, a late single cab weighs 2380 (2458 with tarp),
&gt;       double cab 2480 (2536 with tarp)

The vehicle loses a couple of hundred pounds with the engine swap, and
gains a heck of a lot of weight with the batteries added... about 1,000lbs.
Looks like an early panel van would have about an 800lb carrying capacity
left over, give or take.  Another factoid in favor of the VW for the
conversion:  for FWD cars, some of the batteries sometimes take up the back
seat space.  This requires substantial beefing up of the rear suspension.
Another possibility is to add under the FWD's front hood.  With the VW, it
seems to me that you could get the added mass located between the axles and
low, which would help handling.  How about a battery box hidden in a
single-cab's below-bed cargo space?  Perfect!

        I know that folks have converted Type I-based cars, but it seems to
me that your Beetle/KG/Thing would have to give up a large fraction of
interior space to batteries or else require a beefed up front end to hold a
battery box where the gas tank used to be.  There goes your front trunk.
On second thought, I don't suppose that battery boxes take up much more
space than those kewl zillion-watt speaker boxes.  Does anyone have any
experience with converted Type I's?  It really seems to me that the Type II
would be the way to go if you wanted to convert an air-cooled VW.

        I'm taking the liberty of 'spamming' this message to all 3 mailing
lists... I think it's appropriate to discussions that have been/do take
place on each of them.  (Please remember to delete heavily in replying!:)
