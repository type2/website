'75 Camper for sale on the Internet news:

&gt; From: Laura E Vasquez &lt;levasque_at_mtholyoke_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I need to sell my VW bus, unfortunately I cannot afford a car as a 
&gt; student.  This car is originally from Arizona...and has a perfectly sound 
&gt; body with almost no body rust.  Full camper interior in exquisite 
&gt; condition (sink, ice box, pull out bed, and closet).  It has a rebuilt 
&gt; engine with about 10,000 miles on it.  I just had the starter replaced 
&gt; with a new one, which was jsut worn out.  I also had the dual relay 
&gt; replaced also.  the car is with me in Massachusetts.  % almost brand new 
&gt; all weather tires, and two brand new snow tires included.  
&gt; $5000
&gt; or B.O.
&gt; Laura please reply via email
