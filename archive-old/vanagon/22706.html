Subject: Cross-bred cars, vacuum hose available free, Cape Cod area sights

	A Nova or eq. Toyota made in in Fremont by New United Motors Inc
is obviously a TOY(ota-Chevro)LET! Ok they're not bad if you like that
kind of thing... my mother in law has one.

	On the 'hey, looka-that!' front I've scored 12' (3.8m) of
1&quot; ID Aeroquip steel-reinforced hose if someone wants to build a 
truely beefy vacuum boster circuit... Also got what I figure is about
20' of 0.75&quot; ID which I'll keep for a while toward maybe putting
discs on the pickup when I get it running...  pretty blue color, very
thick and impressive stuff.
	Hey Bob Kenyon, is Otto ever going to get disc brakes ? :)

	Lon Herman is going to Cape Cod- wonders what else to see.
Lon, I really liked the little public beach at Swampscot on the way
to Marblehead, or maybe just beyond. There are also signs you can
follow to retraice Paul Revere's Ride, which is kinda a kick.

	Bill
