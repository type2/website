Subject: Vanagon Headlight Sighting
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Yesterday while riding my motorcycle I spotted a vanagon with 4 round
headlights. I have never seen this arrangment before and was wondering
if it was some kind of option or was it just someone's idea of
customizing their VW.
