&gt;Your subject line
&gt;made me think you wanted a badge that said, &quot;BUS&quot;. 

These badges came on some Transporters/Vanagons. I think only on
7 or 9 seaters. There were/are a few different badges available:

Transporter
Transporter D
Bus
Camping
Volkswagen
Vanagon
Carravelle

Maybe even more, maybe 'Syncro', 'Carravelle Carat', 'Transporter C',
'Transporter CL', 'Transporter GL', i dono.

The only ones i've seen in the newer Transporter/Vanagon badge-style
are the 'Transporter', 'Volkswagen' and 'Carravelle' Badges. Most of 
them are still available through my local dealer though i had some 
trouble ordering a 'Carravelle' badge for a fellow listmember. Most 
of them are between 15 and 20 US dollars. Most of them are interchangable, 
but i think the 'Bus' badge will leave one of the holes exposed or 
requires different holes.

I've also seen chrome 'Transporter', 'Multivan' and 'Carravelle' badges 
for the T4 eurovans and also a 'Transporter' sticker of the same 
size/font but with silver letters, it is meant for T4 pickups.

The questions regarding model differences between countries and the 
fact that VW dealers are not very cooperative when it comes to 
ordering parts that were intended for another country/market makes me 
wonder about the microfiches, does/did VWoA issue different fiches for 
the US dealers? Does someone have a Vanagon Fiche? If so, does it
list a 'Transporter' badge? Or a KM/h speedo? Or if you have a
'68-'79 fiche, does it list the different taillight lenses? Or
the different hazard-light-switch-knob-lenses???
