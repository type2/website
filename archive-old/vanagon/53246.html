Subject: vanagon images?

Hi folks,  I was browsing a while back and hit someones bus home page.  It
had definitions of ALL the different configurations and B+W sideviews of
lots of the vanagons.  Doc Alzheimer here didn't bookmark it, so does anyone
Know what/where I'm talking about? Hey, what's that outside, it's a white
kombi with an old man in it, no wait it's Jack Kevorkian, hey!  my wife must
have made the call, somebody help me! I'm not that old, just forgetful, oooh
nooo.  tim
