Subject: Life expectancy of Head Gaskets in Wasserboxer

Having never before really worked on a wasserboxer engine, but figuring I
probably will some day, and still in search of a late model vanagon, I was
wondering if someone could comment on a range of life expectancy for head
gaskets on this engine.  I've looked at some of the articles dealing with
head gasket repair on this engine and figure it is something I would try to
tackle some day if I had to.  One vanagon owner I know with an 87 said that
he thinks the longest you can get is 60,000 miles.  Is this about right or
have some of you gotten more (or less) out of these gaskets?
