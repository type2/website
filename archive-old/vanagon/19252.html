So Dan Houg says:
&gt; Here's a tip for finding some of those irrascable air leaks in the
&gt; intake system, unfortunately, this requires an aircompressor with a
&gt; regulated output:

Since the pressure required is small, do you think a small capacity
compressor e.g. one of those small ones that run off of the 12V car
battery for flat tires?  Or is this too little air pressure?
