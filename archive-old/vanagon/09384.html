in the sense that synth cleans out clogged passages and therefore may
create leaks you are correct. but in thom's case starting soon with synth
would inhibit that buildup in the first place would it not?

as for heat transfer - synthetic does not absorb heat like dyno - and
therefore the heat is transferred to the case-this is good in the sense
of lower oil temps, but it may work the otherway as well..... --
