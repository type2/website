I would suggest pumping some good quality urethane under the gasket
(outside). I have heard that silicone will react with metal and was told
not to use it by an auto-glass installer.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I found a large puddle of water on the driver's side floor mat of my '84
&gt; Westy this morning.  Having had heavy rain the night before, I checked all
&gt; the windows, they were all closed.  I did notice a small amount of water
&gt; collecting on the dash next to the lower left hand side of the windshield.
&gt; The water seems to have come from under the seal.  The Windshield seal is in
&gt; great shape, and there is no visible rust around the outside of the seal.  I
&gt; was wondering if there was a sealant I could use around the seal to keep
&gt; this from happening again.   I really don't want to replace the seal if I
&gt; don't have to.
&gt; 
&gt; Any Ideas??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
