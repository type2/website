Subject: vanagon diesel questions

NEW OWNER OF A DEISEL VANAGON 

Does anyone have a list of what the fuses do what in my 82 diesel vanagon?

Wiring questions ...in the engine compartment ...4 small bluegreen/white wires
one is hooked to the oilsender unit..one to radiator hose heat sensor one to 
heater hose heat sensor...ONE GOES TO NOTHING????

My glows take aprox. 1 min. to go off no mater how hot or cold the van is...
Can i change the timer or glows to speed up???

Where can i get an oil cap and dipstick assembly for my diesel.._dot_can they be 
ordered new from vw???
		

						Thanks Brian
