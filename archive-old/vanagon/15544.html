So Derek Drew says:
&gt; I have had a sense of dread for some time about the list and it goes like this: 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess things are working out just about right. 
&gt; 
&gt; But I wonder if over the next two years as the internet explodes 5x yet
&gt; again, whether the current mix of articles between busses and Vanagons
&gt; (50-50%?) will still continue. There are a *lot* of 'dem pesky busses out
&gt; there. 

I think most of the concerns you've brought up Derek, are legitimate...But,
I prefer to cross those bridges when they really become necessary.  I wouldn't
mind giving better clues as to which make and year we were discussing if
that would make most of the folks out there happy.  This is so long as 
the original poster gets it in their subject line.
