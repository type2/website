Subject: Re: Air Box-Capacitor Fix?

I need advice:
I am planning to use the &quot;Capacitor Fix&quot; for the Air Flow Sensor problem
common to our Vanagons. From the archives I found that the fix calls for
a 22 microfarad 25 volt capacitor of tantalum type. Unfortunately the
closest capacitor that I was able to find was 22 microfarad 16VDC. I do
not know if it is tantalum or not. How does one tell? 
I need to know if this capacitor will do the job.
