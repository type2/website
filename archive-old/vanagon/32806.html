Subject: Re: Penetrating Fluid Recommendations

In a message dated 96-01-14 14:40:16 EST, you write:

&gt;I'm looking for some suggestions on penetrating liquid to use to
&gt;free up bolts that have probably not been moved in 30 years.  I've been
&gt;using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
&gt;there that is better.
&gt;
&gt;

Nothing better than HEAT!  I use a pencil torch.  Pinpoint accuracy and works
like a charm. 

Someone suggested to me once use liquid wrench and then blow it in with an
air hose.  Repeat multiple times over two days and it works like a charm.  I
have never tried it.  Good luck.
