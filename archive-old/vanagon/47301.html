Subject: Re: Greed intervenes on behalf of the EV.....

&gt; The end result...the EV is staying in the fleet. Can't blame the seller, =
&gt; I'd probably do the same thing...as they say: &quot;money talks...bullshit =
&gt; walks&quot;...
&gt; or at least drives away in an EV  ;-)

Heck I'm glad I don't have to assume the mantle of &quot;self proclaimed 
defender of the eurovan&quot;.

Although I'd also like a Syncro Westy its more practical to have an MV 
most of the time.  Now if I could get a Syncro EV MV in this country...

I may get a Westy/other camper eventually.  Loved the '72 we had.  Liked 
it bett than the more recent Westy layouts actually.
