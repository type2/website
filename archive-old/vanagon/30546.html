I just installed Kadrons on my 1776 upright. They were very easy to 
install, even though they don't come with instructions.

The biggest problem I had was removing the single carb manifold. I ended 
up dropping the engine. After that it was simple.

I had to get a T piece made up to connect the brake vacuum hose. I 
installed the T piece in the reinforced vinyl balance tube which came 
with the kit. Another option is to drill and tap one of the manifolds and 
fit a connector of some sort.

The other problem is with the throttle spring. At full stretch it might 
be too tight at the accelerator pedal. Too loose and the carbs don't settle 
back against the idle stops. I used a small piece of fob watch chain and 
some key rings to give me an adjustable set up which I have now got right 
(I hope).

Make sure you get some more hose clamps. Clamp the balance tube at 
both ends (as well as at you T piece) and the fuel line connections at the 
pump and the ends of the metal tubes (close to the carbs). 
 
Tuning is pretty simple and more or less set and forget. The accelerator 
pumps need to be just right to prevent flat spots but the adjustment is 
simple and won't move after it set.

I wish mine had only cost $260. I paid $A600 which was an $A80 discount 
for cash.

The difference it has made to my bus has made it worthwhile, although I 
need to lighten my foot if I want to get decent fuel economy. 

Good luck.
