&gt; Let me get this straight, your Vanagon only has FOUR cylinders?

So let me get this straight, you've got more than 4 cylinders?

Well sheeit, we all have more than 4 cylinders. Hell, my standard 
transmission Syncro has at least *11* cylinders that I can think
of off the top of my head.

Oh oH, you mean ENGINE cylinders...  Never Mind :-).
