Subject:      Oil plug stripped, fix needed

I didn't do it!!!

        Imagin my surprist when I went to change the oil on my &quot;new&quot; 84
Westfalia and found a one inch bolt sticking out of the drain plug area.
there was a wing nut device lolding a rubber stoper in place.  It fell out
with a gentle wiggle.  My heart alomost stopped.  What if that had hapened
on the road?  I don't want to know.  Anyway I ordered a new bolt but ther is
a bood chance the inner threads are stripped.  Waht are my fix options?  Be
reasonable, engine replacement isn't an option!  Anyone solved this problem
yet or have ideas?

Eric
