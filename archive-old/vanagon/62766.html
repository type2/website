Subject: Installing child car seats in a Vanagon

I have two children still in carseats (forward facing) and would
appreciate suggestions as to where I can attach the anchor bolts in an
'84 Westphalia.

I'm hesitant to anchor the seats to the fibre-board bench seat back and
am not sure that poking holes in the body (the bus, not mine) is a good
thing so close to the engine - although I did note where the lapbelts are
secured.

Thanks in advance for your help.

            2 1/2 year old
