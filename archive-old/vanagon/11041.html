Re: DD's  Robot.

I think that's a good idea.

What do you (the rest of the group) think.

I know very little about how these Robots function,
(kind of funny since I'm studying Robotics engineering, but not cyberbots)
But my brother is on a World War II list and always forwards me stuff
about Kubelwagens that pop up there from time to time.

There's lots of interesting stuff floating around in here.

Cheers
