Jan -

Try to get ahold of Brian VerBeek at verbeekb_at_worldaccess.nl

He's there in the Netherlands and may have some good contacts to go from.
 I know he's a member of either the Type 2 List or the Vanagon List.

&gt;I looked at Ron Salmons Bus Depot pages today. He seems to carry a
&gt;mouth
&gt;watering supply of parts for just about any type of bus or Westfalia
&gt;camper. As owner of a '77 and '81 I could use a few parts he carries
&gt;and in
&gt;fact I will probably order some. However shipping some parts like
&gt;bumpers
&gt;is a bit awkward.
&gt;
&gt;So, I my question is:
&gt;
&gt;Do any of you (European) members of the list know of a similar outfit
&gt;in
&gt;Europe, preferably in middle/northern Europe.
