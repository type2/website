&gt; decrease depending on the condition as well as the year.  The later the year
&gt; the lesser the value.  In other words, I find it hard to believe that in five
&gt; years that a '76 bus will be valued at $25,000 even in pristine condition.
&gt; You also have to find someone willing to pay you that much for your baby.
&gt; 
&gt; The real value should be derived from caring for and driving your Type II.

Of course no 1976 Bus will be worth $25,000 in 2001, unless it's gold plated or
filled with very valuable stuff. But, a 1956 Microbus with 126 original miles
may be pushing that ammount, at least in theory. Anyone with such a Bus would
be silly to let loose of it, barring dire circumstances, IMNSHO.

Hope I get my '64 up and running again some day. It'll never be worth that kind
of money, but it should make an outstanding camping vehicle eventually.

Peace,
