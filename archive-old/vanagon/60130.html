Subject: Bug Out 38 Get-together

	
Hello all,

For anyone who wants to get together prior to the Bug Out, I will be at the
Bull Run 
campground site #88 from Fri. 5/23 . If anyone wants to stop by and
bar-b-q, chew the fat
or whatever please stop by. It would be good to put faces to some of the
names on 
the list. The campground is on route 29 between route 66 and route 234. 

If you plan to stop by either Fri Sat or sunday after the show give me a
shout.


See you there.
