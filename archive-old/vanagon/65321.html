I don't mean to be flip, but jeeez!! When you remove the oil cap, the
tube should have a lip around the rim, just ahead of the threaded collar
the cap screws onto. grasp that lip and pull, the extension should slip
out about five inches. It is possible that the DPO pulled too hard and
pulled it clear out and discarded it or having never discovered it, it
may be frozen in place. Well, not actually &quot;frozen&quot;, but you know what I
mean : )  Any way I purchased at my FLAPS, an oil spout that attaches to
the oil container that turns on and off, very handy for carrying that
partial container to &quot;top off&quot; and eliminates the need for the  extenion
tube anyway..cost less than $2.
