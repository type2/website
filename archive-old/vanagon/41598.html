So Bradley says:
&gt; &gt; In my experience, this is not a metaphysical limit, but a very real limit
&gt; &gt; set by each owner. When you reach your limit, you sell the d*mned thing,
&gt; &gt; and then things do indeed begin to improve.

&gt; ObVWContent: I believe it's my good VW karma that allowed me to get yet
&gt; another free car.  Just remember, be happy, love your VW, and it'll love
&gt; you.  :)
&gt; 

Bradley's right here (here that Bradley, you only get that once from me! ;)  )

If you give up, the failure is yours not the cars.  I would suggest getting
another pair of eyes to look at the problem.  That's what's so great about
this list.  Sure wish it was available many moons ago.  Oh well, that would
take too many vacuum tubes! ;)  Anyway, the list isn't your only source of
input.  Hell, sometimes your wife can point out something missed.  Or, some-
times you should just back off from the problem and do something else.  Some
times it'll hit you in the middle of the night and you'll bolt straight up
in bed and go &quot;Wow! I think I know what the problem is!!!&quot;  

I think if you sell the car, it means you really don't want it.  Sometimes
maybe that's the real answer.  If a car isn't as much fun as I thought it
would be or not any fun at all, then I'll get rid of it too.

Just my $.02 worth of blah-blah...
