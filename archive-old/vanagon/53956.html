I doubt that that fiberglass and empty air space would raise the center of
gravity much.  All the heavy stuff is still down low.  I'd guess a raise in
the center of gravity of maybe 1/4&quot; so cornering wouldn't change much.  The
center of pressure is another mater.   The center of pressure would be raised
about 9&quot; and could be a problem in significant winds.
