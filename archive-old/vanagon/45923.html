Subject: RE: 1986 heater fan dead

The only way that I have found to get to the front fan and core is to remove 
the unit which is of course impossible without removing the dash itself. It is 
a big job ,not too difficult, just tedious. Especially around the steering 
colunm mounting points. I had the same problem on an 84 vanagon that I pickd 
up for cheap. Once out ,the heater box has to be opened by removing the clips 
that hold the housing halves together.At that point lube the fan bearings 
liberally. It should solve the problem. before you put the unit back under the 
dash though apply a 12v. source and see how she runs .You may have to repeat 
the lube job a couple of times . Good Luck!
