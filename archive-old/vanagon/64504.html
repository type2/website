Subject:      heating a westfalia

Friends,

Fall is approaching and my thoughts have turned to fall camping.  This
year I'd like to introduce heating into my '85 Westfalia.  To this end I
am almost sold on the Olympian &quot;A&quot; model catalytic heaters.  I talked to
their rep and he recommended the model 6100A for the vanagon.  He said
that although they make a smaller model rated for 110 sq ft, the Westfalia
has so much heat loss, that I'd need the larger model (rated for 230 sq.
ft.)  The &quot;A&quot; series functions in altitudes over 5,000 ft and will run
for 80 hours on 5 gallons of LP..

I was concerned about oxygen depletion, but he said that has never been a
problem on catalytic heaters.  He recommended 24 sq.in of vented space
which he said could be acheived by cracking one window ~1/2 inch and
cracking open the ceiling vent.  The cost for this unit is $275 w/legs.

Here are my questions:

-  Anyone out there tried this or similar heaters in their vanagon?

-  How'd it work, did you like it?

-  Who has the best pricing on these (this price is from Campers Choice)?

-  I've heard that VW always has some airflow, even when all vents are
closed.  Can I include this into the recommended 24 sq.in&quot; of ventilation,
thus reducing the amount of opened windows?

-  Are there any safety concerns that I should know about?

- Since this solution is LP based, is it better to leave the tank outdoors
on indoors.  I'm thinking outdoors, since LP tanks tend to get cold with
use.

- Is there a different technology that is better.  A true RV furnace looks
like too much hassle.

Thanks in advance!
Ivan, '85 Westfalia
