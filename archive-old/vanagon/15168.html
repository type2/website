Subject: /f sat. night (looking for the heart of...)

	Folks,
	I'm about to send Dave Black a tape of suitable Bus music and
it will include selections by The Mermen- psychedelic surf sound, all
instrumentals, best in the world at it, imho. The good news is, they
will be coming to a town near you, soon, if you live anywhere near the
following places! I get nothing out of this except the joy of knowing
that you might get to hear &quot;Honeybomb&quot; or &quot;Ocean Beach&quot; or &quot;The Whales
Are Coming And Boy Are They Pissed&quot; (starts off as Misserlou, becomes
Paint It Black, then Hava Nagila and finally America (from West Side Story))
live. You might want to bring ear plugs if you're going to be close
to the stage- they get feedback the old fashioned way :-)

	They're playing Saturday night in San Francisco, their web page
has some cool posters and the music they play is most appropriate for
VW Buses of all vintages, EuroVans too.

	Cheers!
	Bill
