Rick:

&gt;As for the &quot;lowering&quot; business, I can't imagine why one would want to lower
&gt;it. I'd like to raise the damn thing - anyone know if its possible to get
&gt;another 3-4 inches of clearance? How would it affect handling? Is it even
&gt;possible with a FWD vehicle?

Last week I posted German classifieds 'VW Crewcab Syncro' where I
informed the list about a EV with a factory made higher clearance.

So it's available from VW but I have no further information. May
I do some investigation?
