Subject: Re-padding seats - anyone done this?

I'd like to repad the seats in the westy. They have good fabric, but
the padding is shot. Hard on the fanny on long trips. Anyone here
done this? Is it complicated and hard? Do you have to cut the old covers
off? My husband thinks we should by some of those stretch seat covers,
lay the padding on the old seats, and put the seat covers over them.
Should I take the easy way out and do this? Thanks! Oh, we hope to
put the engine in the Westy this weekend. I'll update all next week
on the results.
Lisa
