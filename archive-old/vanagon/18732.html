Subject: another neat camping toy


It's getting to be the wrong season to post this, but perhaps some of
you will nonetheless be interested, or remember it when you are.  It
appealed to me because I'm ALWAYS cold when trying to sleep while
camping.  The product is a bed warmer - in effect an electric mattress
pad.  The company makes several models, both ac and dc, and one line,
the &quot;k&quot; model, which interested me as it can be used as ac OR dc.  Further,
it is actually wired for both, so needs no special converter/inverter box.
It comes in a variety of sizes from 24&quot; x 60&quot; up to 60&quot; x 60&quot; and some of
the units even have dual controls.  The amp draw at 12v depends of
course on size, and ranges from 4.4-9.7.  I ordered the 3/4 size,
which is 46&quot; x 60&quot; and comes only with the single control.  This should
fit my westy's 45&quot; x 75&quot; bed fairly well.  

The company makes a huge variety of similar products with minor detail
changes here and there, such as function, power source, size, etc.,
and in addition has things you might expect such as heated
throws, back heater/massager, heating pads, sinus masks, etc.  Prices
range for the mattress warmers from about $33 on up to $114.  Be sure
to ask for prices from their special order form, which is at a
15% savings, and ask for a very nice gentelman (who seems to have
been there for the last 40 years) named Bob.  He had heard of the
internet, and I told him I'd post something about the products, so he
should have some clue if you decide to call him up and order.  

Now the exciting part:  they do business the old fashioned way - I
tried to place my order in the typical fashion with credit card.  He
said that they do a lot of business with RVers, and that in his 
experience if people owned a camper, they generally were good about
paying their bills, so that he would simply send me the product, and
invoice me for it in the box.  I couldn't quite get over this in
this day and age, but he apparently does business that way.  Further,
he said to try it out for 30 days and to feel free to return it if
I wasn't satisfied for any reason.  It's sounds like a very relaxed
little place in Danville, Ohio, with old-fashioned mid-western
wholesomeness.  :)   Anyway, the standard claimer applies, as I'm
not affiliated with them, etc.  For $2.50 more, I could get 2nd
day air shipping via UPS, so opted to do this in order to test
the unit this weekend, before joining GNATT at Mt. Lassen, where
in fact even at this time of year, the heat may be very welcome.  I
will try to remember to let the list know how I liked the unit.
