And sometimes can be the reason that family members consider commitment (to an
institution that is) either due to the delirious state of being brought on by
ownership or the delirious state of mind brought on when you can't diagnose the
problem that's been eluding you for months or trying to find that part that you
_need_ to get it back on the road.
