My $.02 Re: the thermostat thread.

As Charles (Boss) Kettering said, &quot;Parts left out cost nothing
and have an infinite service life.&quot;  If it wasn't necessary,
VW wouldn't have put it there.  Over the  life of the program,
no thermostat and associated hardware would have saved millions
of DM.  And remember, these people are the ones with the resources
to properlytest an air-cooled engine.  They are the experts, period.
