Subject: Re: Rain-x Yuks

I hate rain-x for the same reason John does. It gets real old real fast and
after a couple of weeks your wildshield is full of gunk and you cannot get
it off, it obscures your vision, attracts direct, etc. Yuk!

The only reason to use rain-x is if your wipers are broke. I drove our Honda
around like this for six months about two years ago so I have a lot of
experience with rain-x.
