Subject: Best Subwoofer Position

After much thinking I believe the best place for a subwoofer in a Vanagon is
under the passenger seat. There is a box under there used for nothing,
almost sealed, and used for nothing. 

The only reason I haven't installed a woofer in that spot is that I haven't
calculated the volume of air space in that cavity (1 square foot?) and
havn't figured out how to determine which subwoofer on the market is
designed for this amount of space. 

Anyone know of a woofer made to operate with that much space?
