Subject: GTI Motor into Diesel Westy

Volks, 
I am considering a Diesel Westy for purchase and was told a GTI motor
will bolt in w/no mods (100 HP). Has anyone done this? Do differential
gears have to be changed? Any mods to engine compartment. 
I was told no mods at all and the GTI motor just slides right in there.
If this is so it will make a big diff in my purchasing the Diesel Westy.
