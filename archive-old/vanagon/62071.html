My application -- windsurfing
Want far back to help top popping

My front is above the divot behind the skylight.
Back is about 4-6&quot; in front of the thicker part with the poptop hardware.

Seems OK
For big stuff I might either put a thirt bar right at front of pop top or
even in luggage carrier, but have not done that yet -- I also am thinking
that for a long sea kayak I'll just get some sort of styro pad and use the
luggage area and those tie downs along with my 2 existing bars. -- good luck
