Subject: parts needed


Hi again vanagooners!

I'm in dyre need of a few parts to pass swiss inspection (that's
right, it's not over yet). The only catalog I have is J.C.Whitney
and they don't have everything I need. In particular, I need 
a catalytic converter, a windshield seal and a propane tank. My
van is a 2.1l 1986 pop-top. JCW doesn't hold these parts for this
model. Can anyone recommend a place where you know these parts are
available?
I just faxed a bunch of distributors on Joel's list (who had a fax
number) for a catalog, but I'm afraid it will take a while before I
receive the catalogs, order and receive the parts. And new parts here
are *very* expensive.

If you have recommendations for parts catalogs other than JCW (with
non-800 phone number or even better fax number), I would much appreciate
the tip.

Those of you in Europe, where do you get &quot;cheap&quot; parts? From the states?

Thanks a bunch!

Darie
