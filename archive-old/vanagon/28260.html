Subject: big wheels

Just talked to the people at Fast Wheels in Tulsa, 918-599-9022.  They sell
aftermarket wheels in the Vgon bolt pattern.  The wheels have chrome centers
(which they will sandblast for you optionally) and primer, silver, white, or
black rims.  $174 the set of four.  That's the good news.

The bad news is that while they are available in 14x6 (ie near stock) the
15in size is only available in a 15x7 size.  

Does anybody have better than a guess whether tires on that large a wheel
will fit at least at the back of a Vgon?  Fast Wheels will build to any
backspacing specified, so that variable can be accounted for.

15s in back, 14s in front, good looking wheels, only two 15in tires to buy.
It's got me thinking.
