Subject: Re: plugs?

Hello Patrick, and All.  Happy New Year Everyone!! :)

The correct Bosch Platinum Plug for a 2.1 Litre Wasserboxer is 
WR7CP.  I've had trememdous results from these plugs, and they
are worth it.  I can buy a set of 4 from the FLAPS (Canadian Tire) 
for approx $16 CDN including taxes.

Harry.

&gt; 
&gt; i'm at home today with out my bosch parts book, and i cant remember...
&gt; which is the correct platinum plug for a 2.1
&gt; i've got a bunch of new WR7DP plugs.
&gt; is that the one?
