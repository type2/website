This regarding whether or not the propane should or should not be
on while driving.

Derek Drew  claims that it is absurd to switch between propane and 
electric every time you stop your car.  Now when I drive with something 
in the fridge, I usually just leave the electric on unless I plan to
stop for a significant amount of time.  Significant = 1/2 hour or
more.  If I'm stopping for gas or groceries or whatever, I'm not going
to dick with the changing the fridge to propane.  If we stop to eat
at a restaurant, I'll probably change it over unless we're going for
fast food.  Now with that in mind, I don't see what the big hassle
is.  I've never had a problem starting my propane and switching to
DC is a snap.  Maybe I need further clarification from Derek as to
where the 'hassle' comes in or if I'm missing something.  

The reason I use electric when traveling is that is the way the 
system was meant to be used.  Whether it is safer or not is quite
debatable.  I tend to feel that it is safer to use electric while
driving because I don't like having the gas going through the lines
with a flame on while everything is being jarred around however
minute the chances of a problem may be.  I just feel safer.  VW
also discourages the use of propane while driving.  I'll trust 
the engineers at VW on this one.  It also saves gas for the trip
although the fridge uses very small amounts of gas, it doesn't hurt
to be frugal.

So I don't think I'm a raving lunatic for using the 12V system for
keeping the fridge cool while traveling.  And it certainly isn't
a hassle for me to change between the 12V and propane systems.
