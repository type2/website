Subject: 30K camper

	Fellow asks what he should do with his $30K savings
and unrequited love for VW Campers. 

	I'd join LiMBO, this list, get a couple of Bay Area
newspapers in the library (Sunday is car ad day out here) and
graph year versus price for what's available. Remember that
every used car, no matter how nice, will need some work suddenly
just after you buy it. For the least trouble, buy the newest
Van you can afford, making allowance for that first repair, tax
and registration.

	Then look over each prospect like an eagle for unrepaired
body or chassis damage/wear-out. For big bucks, you want and deserve
a vehicle in the best possible condition. Have it professionally
inspected by a dealer or indy service place you trust. Don't even
THINK about dealing with a soon-to-be-former-owner who isn't willing 
to do this with you.

	Finally, buy a color you like: for that kind of money, you're
going to want to like it. If you don't like dark grey metalic, pass up
the dark grey metalics.

	My friend Ken has a Eurovan and I love riding in it. Personally,
I *don't* find the water-cooled motors that much scarier than the
air-cooled. My brother Ian has a Vanagon wasserboxer and I love
riding in it. Wasserboxers seem to have head problems by 100,000 miles,
so price accordingly.

	Of course, for 30K, you could have a breadloaf for every day
of the week and a lot of change invested in mutual funds too...
