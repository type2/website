Subject: Re: LONG BLOCK vs SHORT BLOCK??
Date: Thu, 3 Nov 94 11:10:29 PST

&gt; &gt; I have a 91 VW vanagon and would like to know the difference when some
&gt; body (vw) says they are either going to replace the long Block or the short 
&gt; block....I was told a long block is just a complete engine with alternators...sheet metal and other parts strapped on, while the short block is 
&gt; the core, pistons, and heads and valves...thanks in advance
&gt; john.
&gt; 
 The rebuilders of air-cooled VWs usually refer to a short block as an engine
 without cylinders, pistons or heads. A long block includes those items but
 still doesn't have sheet metal, alternator,etc. A turnkey engine would be 
 the one that is complete with all accessories.

 Now, in the water cooled world things maybe different. If you were buying a
 short block for a Chevy, you would get pistons and rings installed, but no 
 heads. a long block would include heads.

 So, even after all this verbage, I don't know what you would get with a 
 wasserboxer short block, it's kind of in between. I think you can be certain,
 though, that a long block will not be a complete engine, but it would include
 heads.
