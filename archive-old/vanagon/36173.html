Subject: Oil light/Warning buzzer

Hello All,

Sooooo, my oil light/warning buzzer started coming on at 2000rpm plus, when
the van was cold. It would go away within a minute or so, and wouldn't come
on at all if I warmed the car up for a few minutes (5 or so).

The oil light blinks, unlike the steady light someone posted about last
month. So it's registering an oil pressure drop as far as it knows.

I suspected the oil, which had gas in it at the time. So I changed the oil
(didn't change the filter). Still had the problem.

I suspected it was related to my power loss problem (which was causing my
gas in the oil). So I got that fixed. Still had the oil light problem.

I suspected a bad oil filter. So I changed the filter and the oil again.
Still have the problem as of this morning.

My next two or three areas of exploration, in order:
1. The oil pressure sensor plug.
2. A bad ground somewere.
3. A bad relay unit somewhere (I haven't looked at the electrical
schematics yet to see how the circuit runs. I think it's pretty simple,
from what I remember of my 70's vans).
Someone also suggested I clean out the oil pressure regulator with a
toothbrush(I don't remember this part--hope it's easy to get to. Hey,
wonder if it's that big screwlike plug on the bottom rear left of the
engine. Bentley will tell me.).


Why did I have a power loss/gas in the oil problem? Well, that's another
story.  :-)

Hey, I have faith that all these things will be solved. I just have to grok
the car until I find out what it wants fixed. This winter was just a little
harsh on poor Kalypso.
BTW, the coolant leak that I thought was the head gasket nightmare is
apparently just a coolant connection clamp i need to replace (whew!).
