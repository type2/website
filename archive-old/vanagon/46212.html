hey now,

today i cleaned what little rust there was on the heater boxes off....very
nice looking now. i've decided against painting them since the temps will
prolly be to high for even special paints.

tommorrow i install the gauges and run the wires for the oil pressure, temp
and voltometer gauges. hopefully the heads will be back from California
tommorrow. may have the bus back together by friday...and then i have to put
on 500 miles by tuesday so i can check the valves and retourqe the heads if
needed. wouldn't be a problem if i didn't have to work 12pm-6pm on Sat. and
Sun.

trying to keep my hopes up on this....but i really don't think the bus will
be ready for my trip north on tuesday. :-(

jonathan
