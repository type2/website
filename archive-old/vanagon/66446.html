Subject:      Clutch chattering and bucking 84 on

I was wondering how many of you are having this problem. I have a shop in
Tacoma WA and we have been having a real problem with the discs from Sachs that
were manufactured in Canada. We have warranteed 5 or 6 clutch jobs in the last
year because of a real bad chatter that shows up after 30 to 120 days and
occurs only when hot. I have been able to get Sachs to admit there is a problem
but so far they have only replaced one disc. At first they said we were the
only ones that were having trouble!

Thanks for the help,

Brian
