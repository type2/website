Subject: Re: buying a new or used VW in Europe


Bradely writes, in response to what the EuroVan is called in Europe:
&gt; A T4

The T4 designation is actually VWs sub-designation of the current
iteration of the Type2. The T3 is the &quot;vanagon&quot; type, T2 the
Bay window type, and the T1 the original split-windshield type.


&gt;From the various catalogues, brochures, books, etc., here's what
I have come up with:

TRANSPORTER - the overall factory name for the Type2 line. Also
used for the commercial van versions of the T4 as well as the
base-model passenger version of the T4 with the dual rear
doors (a la Chevy vans)

CARAVELLE, CARAVELLE - GL - similar to our EuroVan CL and
GL versions. The mid market versions with seating 
capacity ranging from 7 to 9 passengers. Full line of
engines available.. from 4 cyl gas/diesel and 5 cyl gas/diesel
as well as 5 speed std and 4 speed auto trans.

MULTIVAN - similar to our EuroVan MV and Weekender. 7 passenger,
top of the line passenger version. Also available in both 4 &amp; 5
cylinder gas/diesel versions as well with 5 speed std, and 4 speed
auto trans. Interestingly, there is a brochure which begs the
question &quot;Is this the largest room limousine?&quot; Limousine being
a large luxury car.

There is a &quot;special edition&quot; called the &quot;Allstar&quot; with mag wheels,
special interior seat colors, and available in either white,
GTI red or green metallic.


Others....California Coach - the pop top Westfalia version
California Tour - the raised roof Westfalia version.


BTW...according to one of the other brochures, the T4 came out
on top in Germany's TUV (their automotive certifying agency)
off-side frontal impact test.
