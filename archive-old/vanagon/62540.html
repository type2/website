Hi Randy,

How about a repair windsheild lip piece for busses and vanagons? Should be
pretty easy and I guarantee you'd be able to sell quite a bit of 'em!

I'd love to buy some fiberglass repair panels for my '71 Rustfalia! Don't
have any donor pieces tho. BUT, if you're really serious about this, why
not buy some good replacement panels for a pattern?

Good luck!

&gt; All, 
&gt; In response to a post that I came across the other day concerning
&gt; fiberglass, I talked with my SO's brother, who is in the business. He
makes
&gt; custom body parts for mostly larger trucks and busses (Thompson, Blue
&gt; Bird,...) He said that it would be very simple to make most of the side
&gt; panels. All we need is a donor part for each one to make a pattern from.
&gt; Sounded like a very worthwhile adventure, we can make the pattern in my
&gt; garage and maybe even make the parts there until the neighbors catch on.
Is
&gt; there enough of you guys out there that would be interested to make it a
&gt; worthwhile project? We could possibly even get his employer to pick up
the
&gt; tab for the pattern and offer the parts to the list. It would sure be
nice
&gt; to not have to worry about all that seam rust that we all get. If someone
&gt; out there has undamaged steel parts for tooling, we could work a deal on
&gt; the fiberglass counterparts. Also does anyone know what, if any legal
&gt; problems could be involved? I've been told that you have to change the
copy
&gt; a certain percentage to avoid patent rights, but I would think that a
total
&gt; material change would qualify. Anyone ?????
