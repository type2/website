Subject: vanagon rear window vents


Hi,
I have an 87 vanagon with a/c, but the rear of the cabin still gets bakin' 
hot.  I've seen rear side window vents on some newere vanagons and would 
like to mod my van with these vents.
 -has anybody ever done this?
 -source for the vents
 -can it be done--are the windows the same shape?

Thanks,
Fred
