Subject: MI &quot;Munk Junk&quot; VW parts run

Hi there everyone,

	there's a free VW parts giveaway at Munk's Motors this Saturday
from 12-5pm near M59 west of I75 in Michigan.  (Supposed to be a MVVC
member to get the free stuff; MVVC membership is like $12 or something.)
We will be having a small caravan to this giveaway.  Join us, whether
you're a club member or not!

	We'll meet at 10:15ish at Arborland Mall in Ann Arbor.  Arborland
Mall is on Washtenaw, which is exit 37 (I forget:  either 37A or 37B--it's
the westbound direction) of US23.  The mall is right there nestled up
against the highway; you can't miss it.  We'll meet right at the base of
the giant Arborland sign (big digital clock/thermometer).  We'll be on the
highway and Munk-bound by 10:30.  It should be an easy hour's drive to
Munk's. 

	Don't forget that the 2 following weekends are also &quot;action-packed.&quot;
Short notes about the other events appear below.

See you Saturday!
