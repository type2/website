Robert, about the quantum engine swap to Vanagon..

&gt;&gt; I am wondering if anyone has the part # for the exaust pipe
&gt;&gt;that will go from the turbo to the muffler, or will this part need to be
&gt;&gt;made localy?
&gt;
&gt;When I got to that point, I towed my camper to a local muffler shop,
&gt;and had them make the pipe from the turbo exit to the muffler.   The pipe
&gt;makes a U turn from the turbo and runs outside the engine cover.
&gt; I found a larger diameter muffler looking through the local auto parts
&gt;catalog.  The whole deal cost about $95.  An alternate would be and
&gt;try for the factory van TD parts from Germany or England.
&gt;

The replace for the pipe between the turbo charger and the muffler
will cost DM 310.- at VAG dealer. Part number for a '82 TD Vanagon is
068 251 171E. I guess it's cheaper to weld this locally.
