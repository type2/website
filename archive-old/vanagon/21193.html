Subject: to rebuild or not to rebuild

Being moderately mechanically inclined,  I desided to rebild my own engine.
 Now that I have it a part and have started looking for parts,  I am begining
to question my decision.   Does any body have any advice for me.  At this
point my decision is between getting a long block or by the parts and do it
my self.  I my have also thought about looking at a turnkey, but have not
found one to get the price.

I have a 1972 type IV engine
Here is a list of the things I need to get to do it myself.
Cam Shaft(-4)
Cam Lifters
Pistions and sleeves
Heads or rebuild the ones I have yet another mystery
Heat exchangers
Heat control boxes
Alternater
Fan
oil cooler(I may just clean this)

Just for your notes other things that need to worked on are
CV joints(all)
Emgency Break wires
Heat Control wires
The electrical system

Once these things are done I will be able to drive it and start on the
interior and body.
