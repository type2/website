Sorry to hear 'bout your &quot;fun&quot; with the DMV, its refreshing to know
that DMV personnel traits are universal. As I've always said,
&quot;There are two types of assholes in the world. The intellegent
assholes become lawyers, and the stupid assholes work for the DMV.&quot;

Speaking as an intellegent asshole ;-)
