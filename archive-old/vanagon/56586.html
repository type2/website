Subject: Air-cooled to Water-cooled

I was just curious if anyone has ever turned an air cooled vanagon into a
water-cooled one.  I never hear much on the subject so I imagine it is either
next to impossible or very expensive.  I have an 81 Westy and I am always
thinking about this.  It is one of those things I would probably never do,
but that doesn't stop me wondering about this.  The talk about installing
 suburu engines in the vanagon is what really sparked my curiosity.  I am new
to the list and vanagons, so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
