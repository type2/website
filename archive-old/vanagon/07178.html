While on brief vacation over Thanksgiving, I happen to be in the neighborhood
of the Coastal Highway near Big Sur, so took the liberty of driving into
the campground we've chose for our January gathering.  Unfortunately, because
there were so many people camping there on account of the holiday, they
wouldn't let me drive into the campsites, which were nearly overflowing.
I could have hiked in from an outer parking lot, but wasn't exactly
dressed for it, and it was raining.  But I did enter the park, and saw
the giftshop and store.  It's on the order of 7-11, and although I didn't
check out the prices, they are probably also similar.  They do have
firewood, but they don't have any fish or seafood that I could see.  There
is a lodge adjacent to the giftshop, in case any of you will be vanless.
All in all, it was quite beautiful, and it looks like there are many
things to do there both inside this state park, as well as within,
say, a 20 mile north or south direciton on Highway one in terms of
restaurants, etc. outside of the premesis.    

Points to ponder:

Be prepared for cold and wet
Bring propane
Bring or get enroute firewood
Bring a few folding chairs
Bring quarters for showers
Bring a camera
Bring or pick up fish or seafood for chowder

Also, if anyone has a key to their vanagon westy and would bring it
along, I'd like to try and see if it fits my car.  I understand that
VW made 4 different cuts of this key, and the only one I've been
able to try was not the correct one.  If I can get the locked portion
off, I'll replace it with a cork!  Thanks....----martha
