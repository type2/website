Subject: Friday!  Song Time!

###  Hey, it's Friday!  Song Time!                                 ###
###  All this yak about how fast these vehicles will go            ###
###  has prompted me to offer up the following                     ###
###  paean to the Unvarnished Truth                                ###
###  This is that caissons song you learned in your militaristic   ###
###  grade school.  Does anyone know what a caisson is?            ###


Over hill, over dale, got the
pedal to the metal,
And the Fow Vays go creeping along.

Look, a jogger I do spy,
Friendly wave as he trots by,
And the Fow Vays go creeping along

CHORUS
For it's Hi, Hi, Ham, on our trip to Alabam'
Call out the mile signs we go by, One! One!
One Way's our way to go... It's no big rush, we know,
As the Fow Vays go creeping along.


###    Well, kinda weak there in the tenors...                    ###
###    Let's try another verse...  All together now...            ###


Up the hill, break of day,
We're in first gear all the way,
And the Fow Vays go creeping along.

Emblem &quot;S&quot;, folks will know,
As they see our **S-car go!**
That the Fow Vays go creeping along.

CHORUS
For it's Bye! Bye! Bookin'!  This is Fahrvergnugen!
Call out our true velociteee!  Forty four!
For wherever we go, we just hurry slow,
And the Fow Vays go creeping along.
