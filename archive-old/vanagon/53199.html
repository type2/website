&gt;      Hi All,
&gt;      
&gt;        O.K., I'm off to buy a six foot length of pipe to &quot;ASSIST&quot; in 
&gt;      getting the lug nuts off.  Just one more question.  Where does 
&gt;      everybody stow these essential devices for when they get a flat on the 
&gt;      side of the road?  Will anti seize on the studs or regular tire 
&gt;      rotations prevent this problem in the future for road side repairs 

If the lug nuts/bolts are put on properly - not too high torque - you should
be able to get them off OK with the lug wrench.  I've never used anti seize
or any other lubricant, but I don't see how it could hurt.  I know if the
lugs/bolts are left to set long enough without lubricant they will tend to
weld themselves together, making them difficult to remove - as you know!
