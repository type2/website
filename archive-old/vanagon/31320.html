Subject: RE: coil over springs for busses with sagging rear ends?


&gt;Would coil over shocks &amp; springs be an acceptable, low cost, DIY, &quot;cure&quot;
&gt;for sagging rear ends?


Yes, they would... if you can find such beasts. I have looked for these
for my '71 for months now-- no joy.

If you find some, please please please let me know? I'd LOVE to get
some of these.

I've also heard that the rear torsion bars (in my '71 anyway) can
be adjusted, but it's a real pain, and tricky. Don't know if the situation
is true for your '75... ever heard of this?

Finally, has anyone out there ever actually adjusted the rear torsion
bars on an IRS-type breadloaf?
