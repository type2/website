Subject: Hello, and EuroVan Camper Info

Hello to All on the List,
I'm back from a long break, and can now afford some time to yak with 
others on the list.

My first question is to anyone who has a EuroVan Camper. We (Roamin' 
Holiday) is negotiating with our local VW dealership to buy/lease NEW 
EuroVan Campers for use in our rental business. The terms seem favorable, 
but I'd like to know if anyone has encountered problems with the 
vehicles, or heard of any problems.

Looking at the vehicles, I can see several nice additions, and a few 
negatives. I am interested in hearing how they are to camp in, and to 
drive and maintain.

A word of introduction: I run Roamin' Holiday in Albuquerque &amp; Phoenix 
and rent out Westfalias to folks visiting the Southwest.

I also edit Old Bus Review, the NEATO newsletter (for the pre-'68s).

Good to be back.
