&gt; Thanks Todd-
&gt; I am currently the owner of a light cream (impossible to match paint) 76' 
&gt; Mercades Benz 300D.  With 163K on the all original engine which has just 
&gt; sprung a leak from the front main seal.  Here's the catch- you can't buy one 
&gt; seal... you have to buy the whole gasket set.  Wanna know how much? $260.  I 
&gt; know about hard to find parts and so on.  It still has all orig. exhaust on 
&gt; it which needs to be replaced. Around $550 for parts alone!!
&gt; 
&gt; Until about 4 weeks ago the car had no blower motor.  The heat had to be on 
&gt; par with that of a VW.
[...] 
&gt; When I was very young my dad rebuilt VW's all the time.  He had a 64' bug 
&gt; and a 72' SB.
&gt; I'm hooked.
&gt; Chris Bridge.

Ok, so it seems that you at least know what you're getting into!
(big grin)

So how can we help? Questions on setup?  What to do about the
engine? Paint tips? Go for it!  By the way, where are you
located, and do you have an e-mail address?

Hail and well met, Chris!
