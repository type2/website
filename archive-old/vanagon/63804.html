Yup, passed, which is a thing to celebrate in any old VW, esp. in
California.  Thanks for the info.

&gt; &gt; 	I just had a smog check done on my '78 bus and the smog check
&gt; &gt; guy said the oxygen sensor was bad, thus misinforming the computer
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; making the CO output too high.  Is this right?  Putting in a new one
&gt; &gt; hasn't affected engine running or anything, just what does this
&gt; sensor
&gt; &gt; do?
&gt; 
&gt; The O2 sensor is a little battery.  The &quot;potential&quot; difference that 
&gt; drives it is the difference between the O2 in the exhaust and the
&gt; ambient 
&gt; O2.  A &quot;rich&quot; mixture drives the voltage toward the maximum of its
&gt; output 
&gt; (around .9 - .95 volts) while a &quot;lean&quot; mixture drops the voltage down 
&gt; toward zero.  The computer reads the voltage output and adjusts fuel 
&gt; delivery accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you pass smog with a new O2 sensor?  If so, you were probably
&gt; running 
&gt; rich (and the faulty O2 sensor couldn't tell the computer about it) 
&gt; which, if not too extreme, tends to imporve driveability.  So you
&gt; might 
&gt; not notice significant differences in the seat of your pants, but the 
&gt; exhaust analyzer gives you a &quot;pass&quot; instead of a &quot;fail.&quot;
