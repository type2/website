For those of you that have a fondness for Corvettes, STOP HERE.













For the rest of you:
While riding my 2 wheel calorie powered transportation device I 
happened upon the following.
A Corvette at a red light behind a detroit van, but not exactly 
stopped. The driver had his head turned to talk to his passenger
oblivious to everything else.  He kept talking as his 'vette slowly 
slid UNDER the rear end of the van.  When the bumper of the van was 
about 6 inches from his windshield he did a slow turn forward and I 
could read his lips say &quot;Oh Sh*t&quot;.  He slunk into his seat realizing 
the situation. About this point the van driver tried to drive away, 
but his wheels were off the ground!  I think the 'vette's engine was 
mashed to the ground too. Quite a riot, I thought.  The van driver got 
out and proceeded to have some heated words for the 
'vette driver.  I left about this point.
Anyway for those of us whose front end is a little more square than 
a 'vette this may not happen.  But to watch it happen to someone 
else, what a riot !
Happy Friday
