&gt; OK, folks, here's one:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure if it's just that the EV AC is too strong, or that my Vanagon's
&gt; AC needs to be re-charged.  Before I mortgage my house and take the Vanagon to
&gt; the dealer, are there any things I can do myself? Like trying to recharge the
&gt; AC myself and see if it gets better?  I had done this years ago on a Renault 18
&gt; and it was not hard at all.   Is it possible to do the same on the Vanagon?
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas, opinions appreciated...

Unless I'm mistaken it is no longer 'legal' to do your own A/C freon work 
in the US anymore - guessing that you are in the US by the address.  It 
is good for the environment by reducing the ozone depletion but an 
annoying intrusion.  Glad the Non-freon A/Cs are out now though I don't 
know what retrofitting can be done.
