Subject: Re: Alloy Wheels - again!


&gt; 
&gt;Option 2:
&gt;
&gt;Borbet Leichtmetallrader Alloys (Mercedes wheels) from the TireRack
&gt;--They say this wheel is an exact crossover for the '91 VW Vanagon
&gt;--but they are 15&quot; wheels: 15 X 7
&gt;--these alloys look exactly like the VW wheel, escept there are 8 rather than 5
&gt;&quot;cut outs&quot;


    I installed a set of these wheels on a Syncro with a BFG 235/15's on them!

  I don't reccomend doing this, but a guy I work with a an extremist!

  The wheels look Great!  I do belive that the Tire Rack sells a set of Lugs
to go with these wheels, Check on that.

  As far as the Safety Issue, these wheels are STRONG!  I have a picture of
the Syncro with the wheels on it, I've yet to get scanned to show the list,
Coming soon!
