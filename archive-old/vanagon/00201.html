Subject: Synchro exhaust options
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 94 13:46:14 EDT

I need to replace the exhaust system on my 86 Synchro. It needs
replacement from the headers out.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a replacement system? For
example, should I just buy one at the dealer or will a 914 2.0 exhaust
fit?

Any and all recommendations would be apprecieted.
