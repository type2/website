Subject: ?'s 85-vanagon changing Trans.oilto synthetics

I would like to change my transmision dope in a 1985 westy to 75W90
valvoline synthetics and would like to add some &quot;Mr.Moly&quot; (snake oil).At
115k may be a little late but I guess slicker is better!Any probelms adding
Moly to transaxles? Bentley reads: To reduce shifting effort, reduce oil
level 15mm below filter hole. (p35.32 abd 35.60) Also note 3L or 3.2qts
refill cannot drain 1.5L. OK,if I add 3.0L or 3.2qts will that put the
level at 15mm below the filler hole? I see the 17mm allen drain plug at the
bottom of the trans, where is the fill plug? Is it the 14-15mm bolt on the
top(little to the left) of the trans? If so how do you get the fluid
in?(Pump, bottle?)Suggestions comments.
Charles
