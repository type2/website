Subject: disc brake pre '71

Hi John,
   Yes, you can put disc brakes on a 68-70 bus.  In fact you can install a
whole front end into the bus if you wish.  I installed a '76 front end into
a '70 bus. You'll need to install a vaccume connection and run lines to the
booster.  Also you'll need to remove the old master cylinder and re-adjust
the brake pedal rod. If you want just the disc brakes just remove the old
spindels from the ball joints. Then install the new ones. I think you'll
need to install the steel line  thats with the calliper from the donor bus.
Just remember though, the brakes will be real hard to apply with out the
brake booster.  Of course You'll have to remember you'll need to install
newer rear brakes as well or you can carry an extra spare tire that matches
the new bolt pattern. Hope this helps.  Take care.
