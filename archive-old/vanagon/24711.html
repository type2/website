I spent the last 30 minutes following the thread about Westy
Insulation/Duct Tape/Garbage Bags/Propane/Ventilation/Heat.
It is always a treat to read the solutions people come up
with, but I have a rodent question for you all.  BTW, this
is *not* related to the animal drivers thread.

I live in the middle of farm land, park my 84 GL in a
machine shed with a concrete floor.  Field mice are always a
problem in boxes (etc.) but last year they invaded my
Vanagon ventilation system.

They chewed up the black cardboard (it came out the dash
vents in shreds).  At one point it got so bad that when I
opened the fresh air vents (at 55MPH) on the dash and out
with nesting material came four LIVE baby mice!

The last thing I want to do is kill them and smell dead
mice.  I drive the Vanagon every day, apparently the warmth
attracts them.  Finally, I resorted to moth balls left on
the defrost vents every night.  So far, so good.  Now I just
smell moth balls.

Is there another way into the ventilation system other than
the front grill that I can seal up?
