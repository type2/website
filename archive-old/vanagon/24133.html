How about 'The Upright'?


...I realise this may be a little obscure to some but here in Aus 'The
Hoover' was also a famous brand of vaccum cleaner.  Hoover made a vac in the
50s and 60s called (believe it or not) 'The Upright' - it's a national
cultural icon in the same league as vegemite, kangaroos and meat pies.  

The parallels go far beyond the play on names.  One of the Hoover's original
selling points was it's power  (surpassed by the wattage of most modern day
vacs, a bit like the VW).  However, also like the VW, the Hoover upright was
incredibly durable and many are still around today, outlasting many a Sanyo
and a Hitachi.....
