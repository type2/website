Subject: Re: '81 Vanagon Offered


&gt;&gt; &gt;Located in NYC, this 1981 Vanagon L has a partially seized motor (runs,
&gt;&gt; &gt;can be driven for maybe 20-30 minutes before overheating), but otherwise
&gt;&gt; &gt;good condition (brakes okay, clutch okay, tranny okay.) Good for parts 
or
&gt;&gt; &gt;whatever.  $100.00.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Aye  yie yie...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Right vehicle, wrong coast.   :-\
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well let's see Steve.  How long would it take you to drive this van from
&gt;NYC to San Diego?  At 60-90 minutes per day, if we assume that during the
&gt;20-30 minutes of each leg you are going 50 mph, and figuring 3000 miles
&gt;(hey I don't even know what a mile is, never mind how many of them there
&gt;are between NYC and SD), that would be.......


It's not the trip back that worries me. I've done worse (it's just a flesh
wound!). It's the long walk to NYC that'll take the time, especially with
the V6 weighing down the backpack.

Maybe Bernie Goetz can split expenses with me. Heard he may be heading
this way. My kinda guy. Let's see... He helps with the conversion, and
I'll give him lessons in marksmanship, which I'll bet he wishes he had had
a while ago...   ;^)
