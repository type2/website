&gt;The editors also add that they had an article dealing with modifications to
&gt;the &quot;Wasservoxer&quot; engine for performance in the August 85 issue. 
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got this article or know what it says. It might be a good idea to
&gt;have it posted to the net.

I might be able to check my Hot VWs archives at home tonight and look for it.
But I don't remember anything about doing modifications to the engine.

The only thing I remember from that time period is that they had a small
note about an offroad race team that put a supercharger on the engine.
It said that it developed 250HP on a stock engine.  I will have to see if
I can find it tonight.
