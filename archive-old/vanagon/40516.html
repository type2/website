&gt;&gt; Hmmm, next I say we buy 50 acres of land in Colorado .......
&gt;
&gt;Better yet a compound in Montana by the Freeman.  We could call
&gt;ourselves the Veemen!
&gt;
&gt;The government would surround us and start playing Greatful dead at
&gt;105db to get us to come out.  The wouldn't realize that they are
&gt;actually making out stay more enjoyable...


...and the best part is, we could write lotsa bad checks, forge fake titles
and registrations, refuse to pay taxes... And if we make a few 
pronouncements
about oppressive governments, the feds won't dare lay a glove on us!
