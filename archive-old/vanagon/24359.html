 &gt; 
 &gt; D-Day was... interesting.  I learned how to replace the thermostat on a car
 &gt; I'd never worked on before.
 &gt; 
 &gt; It was the long grades up Tejon Pass that done me in.  Or the heat, which was
 &gt; hot.  Or the fact the car, a 1990 Oldsmobile, was so heavily loaded it looks
 &gt; like a low-rider.  Or perhaps it was the damn fool behind the wheel that was
 &gt; so delighted with the air-conditioning that he kept it turned up to 'Arctic'
 &gt; while motoring through the 100 degree heat.  Or mebbe the fact the car hadn't
 &gt; been driven very much in recent years, and then only around town.  One of
 &gt; those.  I kinda like the nut idea, myself.

Nononononononono......

With all due respect, you missed the main cause for failure: the car
is a 1990 Oldmobile......


Good Luck with the rest of the trip.
