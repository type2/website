I'd be interested to know some areas where prices seem to be high or low.

Now that I have a surplus Vanagon, and being that I am also a fan of
1960's Land-Rovers, I was thinking of trading one of the vans for a L-R.
The Land-Rovers are relatively common and cheaper in eastern Canada.  I
wonder how eastern Canada Vanagon prices compare to those here in
California?

p.s., I had trouble getting any information at all from kbb_dot_com, but I'll 
try again later.
