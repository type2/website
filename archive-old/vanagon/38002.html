Subject: Wood Westie Interiors (T2)

Now that I have a camper that moves under its own power I am going to 
 begin cleaning up the interior. This 78 has the plastic laminate trim 
 in a real oppressive dark color and the front kick panels and 
 headliner are vinyl. I prefer the plywood panels and trim in my old 71 
 and am going to reproduce some panels using Baltic Birch or whatever 
 light vernier plywood I can scrounge.  I think I will whip up some 
 maple cabinets for the van when I am making the cabinets for my new 
 house so that I can sneak them past the watchful eye of my 
 wife/foreman (&quot;your not going out to work on the VW again? Don't you 
 know we have a house to build?&quot;). 

My Question/offer- It wouldn't be much more work to make a template for 
 cutting out the kick panels, headliner and trim versus making a one 
 off set, does any one else wish to install plywood instead of laminate 
 and vinyl? If I can get enough interest I would gladly reproduce these 
 for the masses for a minimum of labor cost and price of wood. If not 
 then I will make one for me and never bring the subject up again.

Also- since I am chief designer of the cabinets I am looking for 
 suggestions on the ultimate layout and configuration. I would gladly 
 listen to any advice about what you would add / subtract from your 
 current setup. 

Thanks 
Clay
