Subject: Re: 15&quot; wheels &amp; brake fluid leak

[brake fluid leak question]
&gt;
&gt;Another thing came up during our trip - our Brake Warning light came on
&gt;when we were on the windy Highway 1. Luckily, I had Bentley with me, so
&gt;I learned a bit about the brake system, including the fact that the
&gt;brake fluid resevoir is under the instrumentation panal - German
&gt;engineering! So, yes, the fluid was low, but there was also a leak near
&gt;the brake pedal from what I believe is the (or one of?) master brake
&gt;cylinder - the leak is small, but noticable. Is this thing the master
&gt;cylinder? If so, does a leak usually mean a replace of the cylinder or
&gt;perhaps a loose screw and/or seal?
&gt;
&gt;My plan is to buy certified VW brake fluid and top off until I fix the
&gt;leak - I believe this is safe as long as the leak doesn't worsen.
&gt;Plus, the Brake Warning light sensor is working and will tell me
&gt;when/if the fluid gets dangerously low, etc.

OK, I'm not yer Mom, but here goes.  For Cassie's sake, your own, and that
of other folks, take care of this one right away.  Motion is optional;
being able to stop is mandatory.

It does sound like the master cylinder, or something close by.  Does the
brake pedal feel spongy/mushy?  These aren't really tough to rebuild as
long as you're careful (if I say this you know it must be true), and are
you sure it's not in a line?

What is Cassie, BTW?
