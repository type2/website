Aren't old German AM/FM/SW...or K/M/L bands great!! I have two
spare Blaupunkt 6v units with power packs....and in the '56
I currently have a Blaupunkt 6/12v transistor AM/FM/SW/MW unit!

I just wish they still made them!

It would be neat to have one in the EV and the '79 Cabby..
there's nothing like driving down by the seacoast on a foggy
summer's night (or any foggy night) listening to Deutche Wella,
or BBC, or Radio Moscow for that matter!
