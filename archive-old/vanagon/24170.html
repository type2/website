Subject: Speedo rebuilders in Texas?


Does anyone know about a place in Texas that rebuilds VDO 
speedometers? Our local FLAPS mentioned that there is such a
place, but didn't know the details. Has anyone had their 
speedo rebuilt? Ours is dead. The gear to the trip odometer 
broke before our big vacation, and Bob got the thing kinda 
working again. The odometer worked, but was about 11% off.
The came the big 55 mile tow home, and that speedo didn't 
like being towed backwards at all. Now it's dead. And the 
gas guage has never been reliable. So we need it fixed. Our 
FLAPS guy said we didn't want a new VDO, and after hearing 
the price, we agreed. Any Help would be appreciated.

Lisa
