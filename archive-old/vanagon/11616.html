&gt; the nasties of nature and does all the work.  I know, I'll taste it.  Gotta be
&gt; able to taste wax.....There's ah, nope...no warnings on the label...says it's
&gt; just like sprayin' roses...I put it in my hair, knowingly....ok.....
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, man, yuck.  How am I ever gonna get this taste outa my mouth?  Where's the
&gt; Scotch?
&gt; 
&gt; Just can't trust these outa-merica labels.  Don't you folks got no manners?
&gt; There isn't a warning on this package that tells me not to feed this to my dog,
&gt; cat, horse, or my kids (if I have any, I dunno), or not to eat it myself.  Like
&gt; pushin' pills on a baby.  It *does* tell me not to put it in my eyes, and to
&gt; keep it out of the reach of children, but I drink stuff like that.  How do you
&gt; folks get away with this???  Don't got no legislaaation?  Too much??
&gt; 

I think the proper application here is to dilute the waxole with cheap
Scotch, or kerosene. Warm it gently, light the liqued, and drink the
mixture rather rapidly....
