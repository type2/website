My public, deepest and most humble apology to Barry and Margarita for the goof.

They were active participants at BBTA (landscapers and exterior furnishing).
We had a good talk.

Barry and I had previously attempted to coordinate for a convoy to BBTA but our 
routes/timing didn't match.

Barry - the publication I mentioned is &quot;VOLKSWAGEN Magazine&quot;. My dealer signed 
us on to the subscription list. I can imagine if you are 'friendly' with a VW dealer 
(oxymoron?), you may be able to get a freebie. I don't have a copy handy at the 
moment. I'll take a look at subscription information and E-mail it to you.

For the volks who did not attend BBTA, I expect you are getting the message about 
what a few young people with a case or two of canned tuna can do to the nervous 
system and mental stability of others.

	Mammas, don't let your sons grow up to be Tuna Fishermen!!

Barry - what's &quot;moonbow&quot;?
