Subject: Re: 86&gt; ECU's,Air Boxes and Master Cylinders FS Great DEALS!

&gt; Listees,
&gt; 
&gt;   I must first thank the people that were patient with my Lack Of speed thru my recent
&gt; move.  I know there were only a few of you but Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt;   I have recently gotten my hands on a few 86 and newer Air Boxes.  I got them at a
&gt; reasonable price and I too plan to pass them on to people in need for a reasonable
&gt; price:)
&gt; 
&gt;   AIR BOXES!
&gt; 
&gt;   These are NEW Bosch units, they came to me in a VW Factory Crate.  They're NOT
&gt; individually Boxed, these were from the assembly line probably at some point.  The
&gt; fact that they're in &quot;bulk&quot; so to speak leaves the fact that thru time they've been
&gt; subjected to a Small amount of moisture.  There is a small amount of crust or?  I'm
&gt; not sure what to call it.  BUT they're sealed on the end that attaches to your air
&gt; filter housing with the Factory seal.  I took all that I had and did the Pin by Pin
&gt; test with a Voltmeter.  I found Zero Bad ones. I ran a couple of them on one of my Co
&gt; Workers Vanagon and found no problems with them either.
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm selling these for $100.00 Plus S&amp;H.  Anyone interested in one or...  should
&gt; e-mail me and I can give more details if needed.
&gt; 
&gt;   ECU's
&gt; 
&gt;   I have Re-Built ECU's for sale too!  I'm selling these for $300.00 plus a Core fee
&gt; of $225.00.  I need the cores to keep this supply Alive! I don't want your core fee I
&gt; want your burnt up ECU.  If you don't neccessarily have a bad ECU, but want a spare we
&gt; can work out some kind of arrangement.  I open to many ideas as some of you who have
&gt; done business with me know:)
&gt; 
&gt;   Master Cylinders &amp; Vac Boosters!
&gt; 
&gt;   I have a few NEW Factory Vaccumm Booster AND Master cylinder units for sale.  I'm
&gt; selling these for $100.00 for the pair.  $100.00 is the price of a New Master, I
&gt; figure that sooner or later the Boosters will start to fail and these will be worth
&gt; something.
&gt; 
&gt;   A Booster WITHOUT being subjected to Brake Fluid has a very long Shelf life.  I
&gt; wanted to offer these savings to the list knowing that most Listmemebers are Bargin
&gt; people and would be able to see the savings in these items.
&gt; 
&gt;   I have a NEW PHONE # for any of you who may have my old one take note:)
&gt; 
&gt;   Kyle
