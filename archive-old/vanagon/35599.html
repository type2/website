Subject: For Trade: 2000 for 1600

A fellow stopped by Saturday afternoon asking if he could look at my bus. 
That's a rare occurrence. Usually people laugh as I drive by with primer 
spots on oxidized original blue. Of course, my bus is paid for, it takes 
me from point A to point B without once failing me, and I can live in it 
if I have to. 8)

At any rate, after striking up a conversation, the guy tells me that he's 
got about 5 VWs, including one 63 beetle he chopped (it had been rolled) and 
made into a &quot;coupe&quot; that he wants to sell for ~$1400.

He also has what he kept calling a  2 litre (I assume 2000cc) that he 
wants to sell or trade for a good 1600 dp to put into his 57 oval.

You know about all I know. If anyone's interested, send private e-mail 
and I'll put you in touch or ask more questions...or whatever.

I'm in Fayetteville, AR and so's the motor...and the &quot;coupe&quot;...and the 
&quot;oval.&quot;

Joe
