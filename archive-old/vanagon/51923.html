Subject: Diesel Vanagon conversion / CV Joints

The fun continues! I am probably 50% done on my conversion project.
I am hoping to install the gas engine next weekend, weather permitting.

I also started another page outlining how to service CV joints. This 
page has descriptions and photos of the process.
