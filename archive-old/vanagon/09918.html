&gt; You can't possibly believe for one instant that the Chargers are actually

Of course I believe it!  I have all my Steelers voodoo dolls lined up
and ready to go...

&gt; BTW, please scan those pics before I go home!  :)  I can't see them on my
&gt; dumb terminal.  

DOH!  Turns out I'm not going to be able to get to the scanner today.  :(
It will have to wait till Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, thanks for checking the vintage faq site for me.  I'm on NTCA Mosaic
&gt; and can't seem to get the full page. :(

NTCA Mosaic?  What's that, Nauseating Thorougly Crappy Application?  I
suggest you acquire netscape, it's much beddah.
