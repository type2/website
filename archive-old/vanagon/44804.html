Subject: oil temp gauge

Hello all,
Today I ordered the VDO 2-1/16&quot; oil temp gauge, the sump plate sending unit, and
the wiring harness.  I have about 1000 miles to go until my next oil change so I
will install it then.  

Oh yeah, before I forget:  Please, if you're gonna reply to this, reply to
s_bartnik_at_wow_dot_com and not the address I'm mailing it from.

Now, as I said before, I will be installing the gauge in the dummy plate next to
the speedometer in my '78 bus.  Someone said that I could get a hole drill bit
to drill the hole for the gauge.  I've never heard of this, but I'm new to
drilling :) , so would sears have this?  Any tricks I need to know?  If I run
into any difficulty with installation, I will be counting on you.  If anyone has
done this procedure, I would appreciate if it you'd send a procedure to me at
the above address so I can study ahead.  

Many thanks everybody.  I have a bad feeling though that this gauge is going to
tell me something I'd rather not know.  Sometimes ignorance is bliss, until you
have to buy a new engine :) .  Actually, I think my bus seems to be running
cooler than before, especially since my engine compartment is much more sealed
than it used to be.  We'll see, I guess.

Sean
