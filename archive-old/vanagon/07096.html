&gt;
&gt;&gt; Who can solve this mystery? Why would a tight valve cause the EGR filter
&gt;&gt; to fly off? 
&gt;
&gt;I have no (factual) idea, but If you are willing to listen to me play in 
&gt;my mind.....
&gt;
&gt;I would suspect that the tight valve (exhaust? {usually}) was never
&gt;getting completely seated.  This allowed a little gas/air mix out the
&gt;exhaust unburned.  The EGR filter caught the unburned mix (per its design
&gt;spec) and after a bit the amount of gas in the filter got to the point
&gt;where the hot gas from the other 3 cylinders ignited it and BOOM.  Am I
&gt;making sense?  I dunno?  Just thinking.... 

Sounds like a good theory to me! So good, I decided to forward it to the
group. Hope you didn't mind. 

&gt;&gt; Maybe there is no causality relation here, just pure
&gt;&gt; coincidence?
&gt; 
&gt;Somehow I doubt it.  Even if my fantasy is wrong, they sound like 
&gt;related problems.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; (Did I tell you about the time three (3) things broke down
&gt;&gt; within one minute: Engine, turn signals, and steering? Those *were* related
&gt;&gt; and whoever guesses what the problem was gets to call him/herself Vanagon
&gt;&gt; Stud/Studette of the Week.)
&gt;
&gt;I am willing to bet on the wiring harness at the top of the steering 
&gt;column getting caught somehow, which would bind the steering wheel, as 
&gt;well as shorting the turn signals and engine circuits.  Am I a stud? 
&gt;(Expiring minds want to know!)

Yes, you are awfully close! It's actually the plastic housing of the
ignition switch that cracked and eventually blocked the steering wheel.
Good thing the engine gave up just before that...

I hereby confer upon you the title of Herr Stud von Typ 2. Congratulations!

PS: Any opinions on possible implications of sucking in fresh air instead
of inert gases through the EGR system?? Would I be running to lean, for
instance?
