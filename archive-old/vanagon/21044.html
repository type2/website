Harvey,
there is what looks like an empty connection at the rear of my vanagon
in the engine compartment.  I have also found an empty connection at the
front.  I believe it might have been used for a diesel water sensor 
connection.  Perhaps the lead for the light could be run through this 
wire.
Stuart
