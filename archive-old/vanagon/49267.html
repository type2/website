Subject: need advice on buying a used van

Hi Volks, I am looking into buying a '87 GL to upgrade to the larger engine,
power steering, and A/C which my '84 doesnt have. the body is very straight ,
paint good, and has the optional &quot;sport stripe&quot; kit ( wowee!!) and those neat
&quot;carat&quot; alloy wheels. the price is very reasonable, I think, ($ 2300),  but
there are a few drawbacks. First is that  the odometer reads 157k. At this kind
of mileage I am sure the head gaskets have been replaced, but the current
owners,( very short term that is,) don't have any repair records. How many of
you 2.1 liter wasserboxer owners out there have this kind of mileage or more on
your engines? What is the average interval for head gaskets? My '84 which has
110k on it had the head gaskets replaced at 80k by the PO. What other problems
should I look for on a hi mileage van? The second problem is that the shifter
linkage is messed up and I cant get it in gear, but I have a friend who had the
same problem with his van and it was just the shift linkage,and not a problem w/
the tranny. I ran It for a while and the coolant light did not come on so I
guess this is a plus.    

Any advice would be appreciated ASAP as iI'm going down to look at it again this
evening and go over it w/ a fine toothed comb. 

thanks
chris
