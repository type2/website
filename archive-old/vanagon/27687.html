Subject: NJ law, I told youse months ago!

I posted these same stats and facts months ago only to be rebuked by those
holyer-than-thou types that spouted some ecodiatribe regarding my filthy 
emissions and how it only benefits everyone to get my pristine '83 Westy
off the road.  The third biggest contributer to the REPUBLICAN FEEDTROUGH
are the new car dealers of the state of New Jersey.  Our Governor is
letting industry write all of the ecopolicy on the backs of us poor working
morons who voted them in office because Rush Limbaugh told them so {not I
by-the-way}.  Don't forget to vote next week,  that is all that they
listen to.  Incidently....you detractors of gas engines....my westy
has never failed for emissions or anything for that matter because I'm
cheap!  Or,  in other words,  I maintain her.  When things are broken,

they are fixed right,  every 2500 miles,  the oil is changed,  if it
runs poorly,  the problems are eliminated...it just galls me that our
gumment would do such a thing...and it galls me even more to read the
revelings of those out there who don't think that their VWs could be 
taken away because theirs run cleaner than ours...some of us should
just THINK about wallking in someone elses shoes before they start in
on their agenda.

Now,  before you lay it on...I am an ecologist,  at least I work with
the ecology department at Rutgers University {as well as Cell, Chem
Pharm etc...} so don't make me out to be a capitalist non-thinking
republican type...you all do know that there are much more fesable
ways to clean the air...and there are ways to make our gas burnin'
CO belchin&quot; sleds alot cleaner...lets try fuel stabilizers,  hey,
that TORNADO product really worked on my '83,  or how about taking
the train to work twice a week.  Nope...Gov Whitman got several
hundred thousand from new car dealers and from what I have heard the
company that makes the new inspection system is a very powerful
lobbier in the state house.   I know that there is hope,  the best
way is through your vote.  Show Unca Newt that his contract is 
something we didn't vote for,  of course unless there is a VW 
provision in there somewhere...
