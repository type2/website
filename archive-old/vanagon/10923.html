Subject: Re: Coolant draining

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The manual shows a socket-on-extension easily reaching between the push-rod
&gt;&gt;tubes to drain the fluid from the heads.  I found only sheet-metal covers
&gt;&gt;preventing any access to this region.  They were bolted to the bottom of
&gt;&gt;the case (much like on an air-cooled engine) and also had tabs that were
&gt;&gt;under the bottom exhaust port stud nut (and I sure didn't want to open
&gt;&gt;another can of worms by altering the exhaust system's integrity).  Are
&gt;&gt;these not-indicated-in-Bentley dirt shields common or weird?

I think the sheet metal is there to protect the push rod tubes from being
damaged by road rocks, etc. They are not that difficult to remove. The most
difficult nut to loosen is the rear exhuast port stud nut. I remember I had
to remove the oil filter to get to it.
