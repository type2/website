Well Tony,

I have experience a similar experience with other starters.  The starter
may have a &quot;flat spot&quot;. This is described by a &quot;pair&quot; of stators on the
commmutator end of end of the armature being shorted.  Yeah it made a lot
of sense to me, my first time.  Anyway the result is that much like a
roulette wheel your starter spins to crank the engine, and the the starter
slows to a stop.  If the shorted stators &quot;happen&quot; to be underneath the
brushes, nothing happens when your turn the key. This short is often
repairable by a starter rebuild shop.  These guys say that what occurs is
the the Owner will crank the engine for an extended period, ie hard
starting, the armature gets so hot it &quot;melts&quot; the solder joints, then the
centrifugal force slings the solder off, and viola, you now have a short.

BTW starter crank times are about 30 seconds with a 30 minute cool down
between attempts. I realize that nooobody does this, but from my aviation
days thats the recommended procedure, or was it my marine engines, well I
heard it somewhere.

The point is that starters have rapid heat build up, 300-400 amps can do
that.  So if your engine is hard to start for whatever reason, fix that
willl save your starter.

&gt;Hi Gang,
&gt;
&gt;Spent some time in the Banff area this past weekend and a problem has appeared
&gt;again on our van.  It sometimes starts with the key and sometimes we need to
&gt;push start it.  It is *very* intermittent.  When it does not start, there is no
&gt;starter noise.  The lights come on at the dash are, so the ignition is working,
&gt;but no starting.  It happened twice on this trip.  The goofy thing is, it may
&gt;not start, so we push start.  we drive for a while and then stop.  It will then
&gt;start with the key.... maybe.  Very intermittent and irritating.  I crawled
&gt;underneath last night and trace all of the ignition wires as per Bentley.  They
&gt;are all tight and rust free.  The last time this happened, 1 month ago, I
&gt;tightened all connections.  I don't think this was the problem.  The van
&gt;wasn't driven much over the last month so I cannot say for sure.
&gt;
&gt;Any place else I should look or is the starter going to give up the ghost
&gt;soon??
