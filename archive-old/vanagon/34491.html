Finally got my E-mail account straightened out on the new Inet Provider...

my new Address:  JonR_at_empire_dot_net


so I won't be considered a lurker/great unknown...

I currently own an '85 Vanagon GL
                      an '85 Audi 4000s
                        a '68 Beetle
                      and with any luck soon a '71 CrewCab...

I hail from the great white Northeast in southern NH
and I'm a member (if not a frequenter of meetings, right Mike) of the NHVW club..

glad to be back here on &quot;THE List&quot;, if only gone for a few hours...

                    JonR
