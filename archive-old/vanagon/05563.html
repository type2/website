&gt;Is it illegal to sleep in your car on a public street?

I did this all summer traveling around the western US.  My guidelines were:
Get out of town, find someplace where you don't think anyone will be.  
Your camping!
California was the hardest place to find somewhere where there wasn't 
anybody, it usually involved pulling off on a side road going to 
someone's ranch, and finding a pullout in the road.

I didn't know I was doing anything illegal =)
