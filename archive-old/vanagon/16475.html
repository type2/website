Subject: Need 95 Porsche 911 

I'm trying to track down a 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera Turbo. No dealer in 
Michigan can help me, nor can they find one on dealer exchange lists.

It needs to be a Carrera turbo, black on black. We will go where we need 
to get it. If you know of a dealer in your area that might have one on 
the lot (fat chance, but hey! the power of the Internet has seldom failed 
me!), please let me know.

Kristine
