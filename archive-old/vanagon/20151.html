&gt;&gt;I'd love to have intermittant wipers on my vanagon.  Derek doesn't have the

&gt;&gt;how to get this part?
&gt;
The Eurovan's have this type of intermittent wiper. Perhaps an EV relay
would work. On the other hand, mine isn't working right now and I need to
get it replaced. If I get around to it any time soon, I'll list the part
number and price.
