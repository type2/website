I have heard from a reliable source that
MediVan has 385,000 miles on an '85
Vanagon.  It is still in service transporting
physically challanged people.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?


Guess I'll need to refer to my '71 loaf, with its questionable 1600
engine, as &quot;motivationally challenged&quot;?

Heater doesn't work, either... &quot;climactically challenged&quot;?
Steering's pretty loose, too... &quot;directionally unimpaired&quot;?
Some rock dings in the windshield... &quot;panoramically compromised&quot;?

Anyone else?

Happy Fri\\\Wednesday, all...

P.S. It's not a car, it's a... what the hell is it, anyway?
