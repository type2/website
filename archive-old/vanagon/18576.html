Subject: *** Needed, source for metric hose ***

As the title implies, I am looking for a distributor, a shop, or a
manufacturer who carries metric size hose, for applications on my Bus.  I
have searched for months now for the right size hoses for my L Jetronic Fuel
Injection system.

Also, does anyone know how to get ahold of BOSCH directly?  Please let me
know.
