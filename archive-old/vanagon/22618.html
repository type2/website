Yo
	Ok you engine gurus, listen up!

	About 2 weeks ago I rebuilt a 28 PICT and put it on my bus.
I've been experimenting with idle mixture settings here and there, and
now its running OK, but when I turn the bus off after driving any distance,
it _diesels!_

	The dipstick test failed, as expeced.

	What have I wrought, and how do I un-wrought it.  I have instructions
for setting the idle mixture and followed them but it didn't seem to
help.

	This problem is keeping me from taking it to the show in
Vallejo tomorrow. :(

	Other info:  I have the choke disconnected and rotated all the
way away from the stop thingy.  The bus didn't seem to run right with it
connected.  I think the problem was a 6V bus with a 12V choke - I forgot
to switch it when I had it out!
