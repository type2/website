Subject: a reason NOT to use the parking brake

A few weeks ago, the car talk guys gave some reasons for not using
the parking brake.  I discovered yet another.

There's a small probability that your spouse will forget to release it
before driving away.  In my case, it went 15 miles before being detected.

The brakes *were* new and the parking brake *was* fairly tight.  Now they
feel a bit spongy and there is a squeal in the back when you apply them
hard.  Regardless of what physical damage has been done (warped drums???),
I think I need to fix the psychological damage.  That is, everytime I hit
the brakes, that sound gets to me.  So, I'd like to fix it even
if its not really broke.  Thanks for any advice.
