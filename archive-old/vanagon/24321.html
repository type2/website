&gt; it could be the ignition coil &quot;hiccupping&quot; ... sitting atop #4 cylinder
&gt; like that, the coil gets pretty hot. my 80 bus had the coil fail on me out
&gt; in the boondocks. :( but it just flat died suddenly. i did have a set of
&gt; points go &quot;bad&quot; and give me the same sort of symptoms you describe ... about
&gt; 1/8th inch had broken off of the little cam-follower and the timing just
&gt; went to hell really quickly. replaced the points and everything was fine

good lead, i'll open up the distribtor and check the guts out.  is there 
a way to test the coil?

&gt; i'd suggest (1) replace the rotor and distributor cap.
&gt;             (2) replace the points.
&gt;             (3) get a spare coil and put it on the engine. save the old
&gt;                 one somewhere.
&gt; then check the rotor every 5,000 miles or so to see how it is holding up.
&gt; good luck.

So, timing is manually adjusted by rotatin gthe distributor body?  Thanks 
for the suggestions!
