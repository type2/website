&gt; I'm personally glad that your brit-ass is off this volkswagon
&gt; list....I'm not racist, i'm just tired of seeing ads from across the
&gt; sea with vehicles I can't afford to buy because of shitty shipping or
&gt; travelling costs..........no offense

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm about to unsubscribe from this mailing list as it doesn't
&gt; &gt; really have a great deal of relevance for me over here in the UK,
&gt; &gt; having a 1989 1.9L carburettor Tranporter with minimalist camper
&gt; &gt; conversion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But a last couple of questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)  Is there a club in the UK which caters for my type of 'van?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2)  Any recommendations for VW garages and bodyshops in South-West
&gt; &gt;     England?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Many thanks and keep up the excellent work Vanagoners!

And best wishes to you too Charles. Most of the stuff on the list is
related directly to the US, including vans for sale, equipment, etc.
That's why I'm unsubscribing - it's a great list but not too relevant to
me. The best part for me is reading about the excellent trips you all make in
the US but hey, France, Italy, Norway, Russia etc are on my doorstep so
I'm not too jealous!

I suppose we Brits shouldn't even have the right to subscribe to your
US-centric mailing list?  Whatever happened to free speech?
