&gt;        I am progressing on my '72 camper, but the distributor is a
&gt;mechanical advance only Bosch (don't know what number).  What does anyone
&gt;suggest the timing should be set at?  All the books say 5 degree ATDC - but
&gt;this assumes there is a vacuum module attached.  I have it running at about
&gt;0 at idle, but am dissatisfied with the &quot;load&quot; response if the RPM are not
&gt;high.  Also, does anyone have any specs what the overall mechanical advance
&gt;range should be?  It looks like this one is running about 20 degrees advance
&gt;when I rev it up.  BTW, thought I had an alternator problem (light stays on)
&gt;, but found out last night that the PO had wired the high beam indicator to
&gt;that!  Oh, the tangled webs we weave when first we practice to hack up
&gt;wiring.
&gt;        Any ideas or suggestions are appreciated.  
&gt;        Oh, I thought I read something on the subject on the net suggesting
&gt;that vacuum units were for wimpy DE-troit iron, but it would be nice, I
&gt;think.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,

Your engine should have the degree indicator on the fan housing.  If not,
they are stil available from VW.  The timing can be set to 27-30 dgrees BTC
at 3000 rpm.  This is how the timing is set when this engine is installed in
a 914.
