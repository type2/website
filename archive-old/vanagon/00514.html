Hi Folks,

I sent the original posting describing the $12 temp sensor for the ECU.  I'll 
pass by the VW dealer I purchased it from again next week and will try to
buy more.  All of you seem to pay between $30 and $40 for them so I suspect
the part department just made an honest mistake and charged me the wrong
price.  I'll let you know.

In general, I'm NOT aware of a third party source for this kind of part.
Are there sosme ??

&gt; The price that I was quoted (in Milwaukee) was also around 40 dollars!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -------Quoted article---------
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Can someone tell me a source for temp sensors that is close this price?  
&gt; &gt;I just called the dealer, and he wanted $40 for it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;Gerry

&gt; &gt;[pared down]
&gt; &gt;Today I'm THRILLED to report that I was able to replace the coolant temperature
&gt; &gt;sensor and that ALL of the above symptoms disappeared.  Starts right up and runs
&gt; &gt;right, no surging, no stalling and accelerates smoothly.  AND I got all this for
&gt; &gt;the $11.32 the dealer charged me for the sensor (and a $1.68 for the new o-ring
&gt; &gt;seal).
