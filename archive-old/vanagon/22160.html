Just about to trade my 1985 Vanagon in on a 1993 EuroVan GL.

I wanted to get some feedback from EuroVan owners as to 

owner satisfaction, reliability, good points, bad points,

etc.



I'm a diehard VW loyalist from way back. Also own '78

Convertable Beetle and '68 Porsche 912.



EuroVan a little scarry to me because of front drive and 

5 cyl. engine. Also, concerned that EuroVan essentially

discontinued, excepting the camper version. Don't want

to end up with animal I can't get parts or service for

in the long term.



Any HELP would be appreciated!



Thank you in advance for your comments.



Michael
