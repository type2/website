Subject: Philly gathering -- Historic Event


Well, the weather was too good and activities too many to write about
this anytime sooner, but we East coasters did manage to get together
and have some pizza.  Since I figure I must be the only poor soul
who has to work today,  I'll take a few minutes and report.

We managed to hook up right outside of Sesame place ( a little late, because
of the Seren's infinite wisdom and capacity to get lost in the most familiar
of places ), at the parking lot of a next door pizza place.  

We were really happy to meet some of the folks we correspond with so often,
and enjoyed the pizza and the conversation thoroughly.. More on that at the
end of this posting...

The participants were:


Pete (Sellers) and his beautiful white EV 
The GOLEN gang,and their White EV multivan
Dave (Mancuso) and his &quot;Big White Appliance&quot; 
John &amp; Suzanne and their 86 Westy
Kevin          (Kevin rode w/Dave Mancuso)
The SEREN gang and their white EV CL..

And, the historic event:

(Notice anything Joel???????)

in a vanagon list gathering.....


Of course, I held the swing vote, and decided to make some history (ahem :-)


we talked about a lot of different things, enjoyed looking at each other's
vehicles (the Seren EV, &quot;Falkor&quot;, won the dirtiest, messiest van contest
hands down ;-( ) .  In my opinion, Pete's EV won the &quot;best equipped EV&quot;
award, and Ric's EV was next in line...  Dave's Westy is also very nice
looking, immaculate except where his wife had put a barely discernible
nick on the bumper -- they're still married, BTW....  John's '86 looks very
good, too...

We also talked about the other listmembers some...  Pete told us
wonderful stories of his trip and about his GNATT experience, and much about
the TUNA cans and stuff... (We even considered things to do just so that
we could outdo the GNATT stories, but could not come up with anything that
would not get us arrested...)  We settled on doing something quite outrageous,
though, to prove that we are real Northeasterners, (take this, you
TUNABOMBERS ...) we ordered artichoke pizza !!!! My suggestion for anchoviese
was unanimoously turned down ;-(

On the way back we had to separate from the group in order to make our
obligatory stop at IKEA, so we had to separate from the group :-( We hope
everyone made it back home without incident....

It turned out to be very nice, and we'd like to do see more of it happen,
hopefully even the Serens will be able to participate in between the
events they have to play chauffeur for their kids...

Happy 4th of July everyone!!!

(BTW, I took 2 hours yesterday  and actually washed the EV!!!)
