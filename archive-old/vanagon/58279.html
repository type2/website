&gt;I have an 87 &quot;westie&quot; that is in dire need of tires, wheels, and a new
&gt;suspension.  Here is what I would like to do with it.....
&gt;
&gt;1)Replace trashed steel wheels with 15&quot; alloys.
&gt;2)Use lower profile 60 or 70 series tires.
&gt;3)New shocks (or is it struts??) all around and potentially stiffer
&gt;springs.  I would like to lower the front end slightly from its stock
&gt;configuration.
&gt;4)Potentially add anti sway bars.


I put 235/60-15 on 15X7 Alloys on my Synchro and the work fine.  Not
great in snow though.  The load rating is 1550 lbs/tire, the diameter is
1.6% greater than stock and the handling is much improved.  I can still
&quot;make the tires laugh&quot; and haven't come close to rolling it.  I tried to
find shorter stiffer springs but had no luck.  I've put sway bars on
just about every other vehicle I've owned but am content with the
Vanagon without them.

I still run stock wheels with P195/70-14 snows in the winter as the big
wheels don't steer well in new snow.  I've gone uphill at full throttle
and full steering lock in a straight line at 40 MPH!  (Diff wasn't
locked)  I look forward to the big tires every spring though.
