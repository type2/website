Subject: Re: Mud flap

Kedar,
	With respect to your question:

&gt; I noticed that there is a mud flap on the drivers side front
&gt; wheel, but there is none on the passengers side.  There isn't
&gt; even any bracket!  Is this normal?  My theory is that because
&gt; the valves are on the drivers side, the mud flap prevents stones
&gt; and mud from flying up and hitting the valve covers.
&gt; 

My '80 Westy had dual front mud flaps - which I really appreciated as I know
the one on the driver's side also helped protect the propane. When I purchased
my '91 I had the same question as you. The VW service department said that
VW had decided that this driver's side mud flap 'was not really necessary',
but my personal belief in that it was a cost cutting measure. I really
prefer mud flaps all round to protect the body as well. Check the archives - 
as I am sure I remember seeing a discussion of third party mud flaps, where
to get them and how to install them.
