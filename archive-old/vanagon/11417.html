I'm going to try and pull myself out of this one....
I plead lack of caffiene. :0

&gt;Subject: Re: Westy auxiliary battery (why not keep it going)

&gt;This is not ideal because most of the time, the output of one half of the
&gt;alternator will be wasted charging the almost-full starter battery.  Also,
&gt;what is the fascination with three golf cart batteries?  :)  You are the
&gt;second person that has mentioned this.  The golf cart batteries I have seen
&gt;are all 6 volts, and therefore the third one would be essentially useless.

I got the three battery setup from some presentation I went to...  I don't 
clearly remember the setup for three batteries, but your right it doesn't 
sound right.
We do have one truck with 4 golf cart batteries wired in series-parallel, it 
will run a refrigerator for 17 days. :)

&gt;Deep cycle batteries are not designed to be drained completely.  I think
&gt;the manual for mine said to avoid discharging more than about 75 percent,
&gt;and preferrably 50 percent.  Anything more will greatly accelerate the
&gt;death of the battery.  The golf cart batteries are designed for heavy
&gt;current draw over an extended period, similar to a marine/rv battery.
&gt;Golf cart batteries _are_ deep cycle batteries, just like the marine/rv
&gt;batteries, except that they have even thicker plates (so I'm told) which
&gt;accounts for their extreme mass and longevity when compared to other types
&gt;of batteries.

Again you are right, about the batteries.  The golf cart battery is a very 
deep cycle battery.  I understand that periodic draining of a deep cycle 
battery is a good thing because it maintains the &quot;memory&quot; of the battery.  As 
I understand it, during the charge/discharge cycle of the battery an oxide 
develops on the plates, and without a complete discharge ocassionally the 
battery will not store as much of a charge as long.


&gt;&gt; ** As an aside: in putting together my latest fire truck project I used a 
120 
&gt;&gt; amp dual output alternator one side connected to the truck battery, and the 
&gt;&gt; other side connected to (2) 8d auxillary batteries.  The truck batteries 
are 
&gt;&gt; continually topped off with a shore power connection.  I used the deep 
cycle 
&gt;&gt; because those emergency lights suck the power like nothing else.

&gt;Is that 120 amps per side, or 60/60?  In any case, it sounds expensive.  :)

Again I plead chemical imbalance, the alternator is a 200 amp, with two 
windings providing 100/100 per side.  $ 800.00

Thanks for the corrections.  I'm glad you staightend me out.

Matt Rathke, A little confused.
