Subject: VW Customer Relations on Westfalias in US

A while back I wrote to VW asking them about the possibility of
re-introducing Westfalia vans in the US market. Here is the response that I
just received. They apparently think that there is no demands for these
vans here. I wonder if there is a way to convince VW that there still is a
decent demnad for Westfalias in US.

&gt;Dear Sir,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your e-mail. Please accept our apologies for the delay
&gt;in replying.
&gt;
&gt;We are pleased to learn that you like to drive the Volkswagen
&gt;Transporter with Westfalia equipment. On the other hand, we regret
&gt;that the Winnebago conversion does not meet your requirements.
&gt;
&gt;As you know, offer follows demand and in this case it has been found
&gt;by marketing experts that there is no strong demand for Westfalia
&gt;equipment in the US-market. However, the firm Winnebago offers a
&gt;conversion for the Volkswagen Transporter in the United States. The
&gt;equipment they offer is orientated towards customers=B4 wishes in your
&gt;country.
&gt;
&gt;For more information, please contact our subsidiary
