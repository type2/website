Subject: Any Thoughts on purchase of '87 Westy?

I'm looking at an '87 manual Westy for $10,900 in CO.  The odometer says
65K, but the dealer says he doesn't trust it (He says he's just covering
his ass).  He says it was &quot;imported&quot; from the Wash, DC area.  Anyway,
anybody have any specific thoughts on things to look at?

$10,900 doesn't sound like to bad a price if . . .
	Everything works . . .
	No rust . . .
	Heads good . . .
	? . . .

Thanks,
Stephen Jones
