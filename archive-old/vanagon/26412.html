&gt; With all this talk about used vans no longer being cheap in 
&gt; Europe....I wonder if it would be worth while, if one were to
&gt; be in Europe on an extended trip (more than a month...) to ship
&gt; one's own camper/van from the US to Europe, and then ship it back
&gt; when the trip was over.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what it costs to ship cars back and forth?

I checked that out once, and decided it wasn't worth it.  It would have
been almost 1.5K each way, and would take several weeks to ship.  Also,
I have heard too many horror stories about how they beat the hell out of
cars when they ship them overseas.  I've heard of cars showing up with
dents, scratches, even missing parts.  No thank you...
