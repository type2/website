Subject: Campers

We are looking for something that will show the differences of the V.W. 
campers.  If anybody knows of anything (book, magazine, or likewise) 
please let us know. We like the way the front hinged pop top looks (up 
to '73?). Is there a major difference between the '73s and '74s? We are 
looking forward to purchasing one.  Thank you for all comments.
