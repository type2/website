Subject:      wrecked westy person

Actually, my apologies for sending this to the list (hey... at least it's not
an &quot;I can post more inane messages than you&quot; post). If the person who totalled
the westy still has hub caps (as someone else already noted), and if they are
the same as mine, I'd be interested in the hub caps, and possibly a few other
little plastic pieces if the interior was that brown that came in tan to beige
to brown vanagons.

Actually, since we're at it, let me ask about something of a delicate nature.
Does anyone out there carry a porta-john? Those available commercially seem
flimsy. I'm 6'4&quot; and 215 lbs and I don't want to gamble on paper thin plastic.
As near as I can figure, the porta-johns are simply a receptacle to hold a
large plastic bag and some sort of sewage treatment liquid. If anyone knows
different please enlighten me. Anyway, If I'm correct, I'm thinking about
something that might fit in the flip-top storage stool that came with some
mid-70s buses would look better. Now, has anyone seen one of these items in
good shape in a salvage yard somewhere? Does anyone have any experience with
portable toilets?
