Oh Joeeeeel.....! (and list members):

I picked up my new Eurovan Camper yesterday, so you can now add me to next
week's stats!

It's a '95, and I live in Seattle, Washington. Anything else you need to know???

Thanks to the many of you who responded to my purchase queries of last week.
Your advice and &quot;go for it&quot; attitude were big plusses in the decision-making
process. I am now breaking it in (currently at 113 miles), and my friends want
me to get a license plate that makes reference to &quot;Megan's Playhouse.&quot;

Now that I'm an owner, am I required to participate in a blood pact or a sweat
lodge ritual or anything? Or perhaps there's a scarification rite, performed
with a tool  heated over the two-burner propane stove....&lt;g&gt;

No longer a sniveling lurker---
Megan

PS--Do the Eurovans typically come with floor mats? Mine didn't, but I'm
thinking that they forgot to replace them following detailing. I can't believe
that with a &quot;car&quot; of this price, they WOULDN&quot;T provide floor mats.....
