I'm goin to getta new toy!, I'm gonna getta new toy!

I mean, that I have an opportunity to acquire another tool for usage 
in the maintenance of my bus.

Just though I'd pass on a sale price for you to ponder on a couple of 
timely objects.  

West's disgorges on heads includes the use of a Dremel Moto-Tool or 
similar for grinding things, also for balancing rods.

Found a good one for a good price.
Coast to Coast Hardware in the US is having a sale on the variable 
speed unit with case and bunches of cutting &amp; grinding tools too.

Best price I found for it was $99 on sale on the 'net, other prices 
spotted, $119,  $129.

Coast to Coast price, $69.  I'm gonna getta new toy!


Other threads have touched on the subject of Carbon Monoxide 
detectors/alarm.

Coast to Coast sale price for $29, battery powered.  
Another good deal, usually about $50.

Keep your eyes out, others may have similar sales.

No connections to them, just spotting a good deal, and passing it on.

I'm gonna getta new toy!
