&gt; Would not putting in a can of Chevron Techlorine a tank or two before 
&gt; an oil change have the same effect?  I run on Chevron Supreme, and 4 
&gt; times a year put in Chevron's wonder additive.  The van runs like a 
&gt; top.  It is important to do an oil change after a burning these 
&gt; cleaners as the deposits end up in the oil.  Just my 0.02 worth.
&gt; 

I doubt anyone can prove or dispute the Techroline theory, but I have one 
question:

How do the deposits end up in your oil?
