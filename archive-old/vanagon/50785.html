Subject: Carat Table Problems

Today's problem with my buddy's new Carat is that the table does
not unfold from the wall.

I've never seen one of these tables before. It seems there is some sort
of catch behind the table low on the side. Is it a positive catch, or
some sort of jamming or spring mechanism: should he try to force it?

Thanks,

Tom F.
