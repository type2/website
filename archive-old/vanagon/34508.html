Sean,

As I am a late model bus owner (85 Vanagon) I can't really answer any of your
specific questions.  However, they all sound very minor.  The big things to
check are engine compression and oil pressure.  If this is a big investment,
you may want to consider hiring a mechanic to perform an inspection before
you buy.  I have served as a maintenance officer in the Army National Guard
for over 10 years now and I still hire an independant mechanic to inspect
before I buy.  He usually can catch things I might overlook because I'm too
enamored with the idea of a new toy, don't have the tools, time, etc...  It's
usually a very worth while $50-100 spent.  Good luck!
