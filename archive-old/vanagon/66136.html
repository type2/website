Subject:      Fuel pressure regulator price and intallation Question

Hello all,

Autozone has a fuel pressure regulator (fpr) for 52.99 for my 84 gasoline=

Westy.  =

Good price?

Also,  the hoses that connect to the current fpr have special looking hos=
e
clamps
(without screws) over metal bands which are in turn over the rubber fuel
lines.  Is it =

ok to replace this clamp/metal band assembly with just a regular hose
clamp?

What's the best way to get the clamp/metal band assembly off?

Thanks for any help.

chad.

PS  I sure hope replacing the FPR gets rid of that damn buzzing fuel pump=
