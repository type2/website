Subject: VANAGON EVENTS? Possible T2 parts

Does anyone know of any scheduled get togethers this summer? (hopefully
in the east) or any good organized trips scheduled?
  Also, thru someone at work who's parents have recently sold their
67 Westy but kept the luggage rack, ladder, and a tent that was only
used once. What is this stuff possibly worth? any ideas? Has anyone
used the old tents with their Vanagon?
