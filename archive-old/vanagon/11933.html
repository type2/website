Thanks Al, for that GREAT and informative trip report!  

I, for one, am happy with staying at either place, and will let
the rest of you decide.  However, I must tell you that I'm a patsy
for pot-bellied pigs (NOT human ones).

If we decide to stay at Red Rock, what about (Al, Dave, are you listening)
everying mailing in their money ahead of time to the list member who
expects to arrive there first, and the letting them prepay all our
spaces.  Do you think Ranger Rick or whatever his name is would
allow the buddy system of we flashed good, cold, hard $$$ at him?   :)
