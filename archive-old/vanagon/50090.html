&gt;Sorry, but I just had to tell someone and y'all were the closest ones. 
&gt;On the way back from lunch just now, me and my co-worker found a check
&gt;on the ground for $10,000!!!!  Someone had withdrawn it from their
&gt;checking account and dropped it.  We turned it in to a branch of the
&gt;bank on the check, but I just got to thinkin'...that would have been a
&gt;nice down payment for a new EV camper...

Jeez the wind picked it up &amp; blew it a *long* way - please e-mail it back to
me! THX
