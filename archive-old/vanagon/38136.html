well, i still can't get my creative slop working again ... too burned out
and bummed out. but here's something i saw on another list that sort of
fits with us as well:


	SONG OF THE WIPER
		  by
	 W. H. Charnock

	Flip Flop, Flip Flop,
    Never falter, never stop,
Through mist and mud and sleet and snow
    On and on and on I go,
The same by night and the same by day,
Chucking the raindrops out of the way;
    Call it an easy job but, Lord,
A chap gets stiff and a chap gets bored
With the same old swish and some old slop,
	Flip Flop, Flip Flop.

	Flip Flop, Flip Flop,
   Waiting for the rain to stop;
Everything else has some sort of a range,
 The gear box gets no end of a change,
   Carburettors choke and cough,
 The lights go on and the lights go off,
    Tyres can to soft from hard,
Even the spark can advance and retard,
    But I go on until I drop,
	Flip Flop, Flip Flop.

If I might indulge in a skip and a hop
  Such as Flip Flop, Flipperty Flop,
  Or even the tiniest ghost of a skip
    Like Flop FLop, or Flip Flip,
  That at least would something be
  To break this damned monotony,
But never a chance, I keep on turning,
Gears gone dry and windings burning,
    Till my armature goes pop,
	Flip Flop, Flip Flop.
