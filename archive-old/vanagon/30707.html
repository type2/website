&gt;It looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon.


I too have a 84 Vanagon GL and want the weekender setup. I believe that the
weekender will
fit (let me know if you hear differently)

There are three routes to go.

Go dealer: $1,100 for the weekender seat

Go Junkyard: Good luck finding them. They are about as hard 
to find as the interior panel for the sliding door. (In the Bay Area of San
Francisco)

Go Aftermarket: Z-Products says they have a conversion kit to turn
a normal back bench into a weekender style seat. I asked them to send me
some information on it.  The kits costs $250.00 and they said you'll 
need power tools and a good mechanical sense.

I'll let you know as soon as the info comes in.
