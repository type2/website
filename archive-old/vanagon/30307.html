Subject: Re: Bus trip Vancouver to Artic Ocean

&gt;Has anyone found the web site out there that is talking about a trip in the
&gt;Summer of 1996 from Vancouver north to the Artic Ocean in Canada?
&gt;I was looking around the other night and found it but now cannot find it
&gt;&gt;again, I did'nt write down the address.
&gt;Any help would be appreciated.

        I don't know the URL offhand, but it's linked at my web page.
Inuvik is the destination. It's run by Ron Lussier (sp?), I believe his
page is at http://www.chaco_dot_com/~coyote

        Gonna join the madness?

Peace,
