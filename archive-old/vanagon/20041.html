Apply RustCheck fluid, or similar all over the underside, and let it soak 
into the seams corners etc. Undercoat with a rubberized spray &lt;$5/tin, need 
4+ tins.
Just stay away from the exhaust/engine bay. Main damage is from road blast 
off the wheels, so do the w. wells and underside in line with the wheels, 
further inboard depending on how much undercoating you have left. Vanagons 
rust much more slowly than the older busses, but keep the exterior seams 
clean and well waxed.   tim s. (who must do all this to his latest toy)
