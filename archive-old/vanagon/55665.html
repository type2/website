Subject: Re: K2 EuroVans and body trims

This thread has been getting further and further 
from the apparent interests of hard-core VW tinkerers,
but today is Friday, so just a few more words on
the looks of the all-white EV.

Given the low number of VW vans exported and sold
in America in recent years, I can understand VW having
settled on a single color.  I also find the Winnebago
interior quite appealing; the unpractical floor-to-ceiling 
carpeting of the earlier Westies was the reason that I kept
my 78 Bus for so long.

I agree that if one cares to have a car with some &quot;personality&quot;,
then the EV is crying out for an exterior addition.  The
K2 trim, although not my personal choice, does have the personality 
of the wild skier:  lots of color against white snow.  Several of
us EV'ers have the black front bra, but Dan's mural or Drew's panties
are not my idea of addition.  I also think that too many cars
out there today don't gain from stripes.

Still, it is possible, with a few strokes of color, to give a 
very new image.  For example, back in 1977, I bought a new white
VW Rabbit:  with a red interior and a few thin red stripes
on the outside, it was called a &quot;Wild White Rabbit&quot;; it wasn't
a convertible, but it went perfectly with my wife's image, in those
days, of the new Californian.  

In closing, now we're again environmentally conscious, nature-loving, 
Washingtonian moss-backs. We stay away from the TV watching, 
air-conditioned Winnebagger in the RV park, and we'd like to advertize
it discretely with the stripes I imagine, but have not yet seen. 
Maybe this is a theme for the new camper to pick up as a sales pitch.
