Subject: It's not my starter


I need help with this one.  I finally got a nice day to pull the starter 
out of my '79 bus, but when I tested it, it worked just fine.  I started 
worrying that my problem is someplace deeper in the engine, so I put a 
wrench on the alt. and got the engine turning.  It would not turn 
forward, but it did go backwards pretty easily. Then it would turn 
forward to its originial sticking point and STOP..._dot_dead... nothing.  
This seems really bad, so, does anybody know what I should check next or 
is it time to start looking for a different engine?
TIA
dave.
