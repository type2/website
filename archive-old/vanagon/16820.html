Subject: performance engine question

I am about to send my stock 1600 case to the shop.  I was thinking of getting
a performance rebuild kit  It will be a 1776 stock  kit with a 110 cam
substitution.  The Heads will have 39mm intake and 32mm exhaust valves all
with heavy duty springs.  My question is,  will my compression ratio be all
messed up and will I need shims to clear up this problem. if I need shims how
do i know what size.    Thanks for any help.
