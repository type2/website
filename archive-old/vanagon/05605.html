Subject: dual carb


Does anybody has experience with a dual carb? My vanagon does not have the=
=20
full power, maybe 10 or 20 hp are missing. I guess it is the second chamber=
=20
of my dual carb.

Here are the symptoms: Some power is missing while accelerating and only in=
=20
the fourth gear it does not reach its maximum speed. But sometimes the=20
lacking power is suddenly there for five or ten seconds, occassionally even=
=20
for some minutes. Really strange and confusing.

Any hints are appreciated. Dirty jets? Throttle valve of the second chamber?

T.S.
