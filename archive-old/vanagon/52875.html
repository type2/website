Subject: Re: Tents for Vanagons web site address

Phillip, and list members,

These tents are steep.  But they're also way cool.  
The address is:  www.supernet_dot_net_dot_net/~jclark/vw/tents.html.

Does Westfalia make nylon tents for Vanagons?  Do they have a web page?
Please post address if they do.

Thanks,

Craig
