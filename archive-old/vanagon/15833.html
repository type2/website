I am planning on buying a stock motor with a new case and installing 
009, extractor w/single QP and dual Kadrons.  Now, Berg is telling me 
that dual carbs means dual springs.  He quotes some stats about valve 
train failure and such.  He also warns that most builders do not 
correctly install and shim dual springs, which can cause a whole other
set of problems.  My question is this:  do I order my engine with 
dual springs or go without?  He doesn't say how often others screw 
this up.  It would seem from his writing that stock single springs 
would give me more trouble than risking having someone screw up 
installing dual springs.  Opinions?  Oh, this would be a stock 1600DP 
going into a '71 bus.  Thanks, Jim
