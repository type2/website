try to find an independant car-hauler.  Dealerships use them all the time.
 If one has an empty space, your van can travel space-A for a reduced rate.
 You usually needn't be present to have the vehicle loaded.  Just be on the
receiving end or have a local used car dealer receive it for you for a fee.
 The other alternative is to rent a U-haul or Ryder truck and a tow dolly and
drag it home one-way.  U-haul also has dedicated car-hauler trucks.
