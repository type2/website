&gt; Must be nice.  My wife and I had only two weeks.  Gawd, I wish we could
&gt; do a trip like yours.  BUT I'M NOT JEALOUS!!!!   ;)
&gt; Hey, you too have this life style.  Just quit your job.  I did it. Or 
more precisely,  will.  But, by the looks of your vehicles you have a 
pretty good job. Maby you should think that over a few times.&gt; 
&gt; Ahh... I get to post my essential tools list again and lest I forget (cause
&gt; some rude humanoids will remind me :P ) you should obtain a copy of the
&gt; &quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagon Alive!&quot; manual by John Muir (moment of silence,
&gt; please) which is affectionately referred to as the &quot;Idiot Guide&quot; in this
&gt; group.

Check.

  You should read through this manual at your leisure and use it
&gt; as a reference for on-the-road help.  Another good manual is the Bentley
&gt; for your year vehicle.

&gt; Change your oil, oil filter and fuel filter  - Start out right.

&gt; Have a tune-up done or do it yourself.  - Good way to catch any problems.

&gt; Have the headlights aimed (With the car loaded) - Mis-aimed lights are

WOW!
I just printed this list.
Sounds like you`ve been there.
Invaluable information.  Some of the stuff we have some I went out and 
bought last night. More stuff to buy next week.  Good sale at Sears.
&gt; &gt; ----------- end of essentials list ---------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, since you are in camping mode, you'll be taking more food and
&gt; stuff for &quot;roughing it&quot;.  Be sure to bring sleeping bags, even if you are
&gt; going in the summer.  It gets pretty cold in some places.
Summer?  Summer is for wimps.  Winter is for No tourists.
Besides we're from Vermont anything over 30 is a heat wave.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are also planning to buy an Eagle Pass to National Parks. Has anyone 
&gt; &gt; done this?  Is it worth it, or is it best to just play it by ear?
&gt;Beats me...


Actually someone else replied that it was an excellent deal.&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are also going to do most of our cooking on a camp stove.
&gt; 
&gt; Good for you!  Get a 10 or 20lb. tank so you don't have to buy those
&gt; little canisters that can't be recycled.  When you travel, just strap
&gt; it to the top of the camper in the cargo carrier.

&gt; Great idea!

&gt; Also, get one of those portable gas grills for about $20.  There are a
&gt; must for camping.
&gt; 
Can you grill tofu on them? (just kidding, well, not really).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also what should I expect to pay for a sink/cooler unit, used from a 
&gt; &gt; wrecked van?
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't pay more than $60.00 bucks for one out of a wrecking yard.
&gt; Depends on the condition.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Another questsion is about bras.  Our bus has one and it seem that rust 
&gt; &gt; has been forming under it.  Any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it a cross-your-heart or what?  ;)  Since damage is already there, I'd
&gt; just chuck the bra.        
DONE.

Hey Steven,

Thanks so much for all your help.
Hope this reply is not too hard to read.&gt;
