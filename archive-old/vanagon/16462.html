This simply can't happen!  My friends are tired of hearing about this 
friend of mine with a '56 bus and '72(?) 911, but I am not.  We must 
figure something out.  Can you use the account from home?  Can you 
afford one of the other providers and do it from home?  I would 
probably go through something akin to the bends if I lost this access.
