Joel,
Please put me on the list as a &quot;Wanna Bus&quot; (really WANNA WESTY&quot;) if I am 
currently listed as an unknown.
PEJ

I am STILL LOOKING!!!  I've had two people put their rigs on the block, I've 
gotten interested enough to get a check plan a trip, and at the last minute 
have the owners become emotionally attached and decide not to sell. 
 UGH!!!!!  Talk about frustrating, I know VW owners get attached, because I 
have had many and am currently having withdrawal symptoms, but this is 
ridiculous!

Just in case anyone happens to see one, or have one, I am looking for a 
1986-1990 Westy as close to loaded as possible, with a reasonable amount of 
mileage (75,000 or less).  I will consider just about any full Westy in good 
to excellent condition. Traveling distance within eight hours of New Jersey 
is preferable.

Thanks Everybody
