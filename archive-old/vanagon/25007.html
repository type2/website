I'd like to get the 'net opinion on the advantages of vinyl vs canvass sunroof
covers.  I need to re-do mine purty soon.

Here's what I have so far:

     Vinyl                   Canvass
    + $95                  - $225
    + Lotsa Colors         - tan or black
    + Easy to work with    - Can be a pain
    - Cracks over time     ? Rips over time?
    - Fades                ? Fades?
    + Water repellence     ? Water repellence?
    - Looks OK when new    + Looks Excellent when new
    - looks dowdy after    + How does it look after a year or so?
      a while 

Any others would be appreciated...
     
Thom
