Subject: FS 85 WolfsWesty

Hi all,
        This recently came on the market here in Lincoln, NE. Its an 85
Wolfsburg Westy (has poptop and fridge, but no sink or stove) with 56K
miles. New tires and new waterpump. I checked it out and there are a couple
small dings, but absolutely no rust. There appeared to be a small leak in
the skylight. The guys name is Joe (402.466.1298) and he is asking $6900.
Apparently this has been on the market for 3-4 weeks so he may be willing to
go lower.

        He was also throwing a 70's style westy tent in the deal for free.
To make a long story short, he sold me the tent for $50!!!!! This tent looks
like its been used maybe 5 times, incredible condition.

Pat
