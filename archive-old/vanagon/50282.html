Subject: Re: Seneca Rocks Camping Trip

In regard to this weekend for anyone sitting on the fence
I might point out that foilage colors along I68 (50-100 miles
north of Seneca) in the 3000 ft elevation areas are already
spectacular.  From 1500-2500 ft so, so.  But I feel it will
be a great time.  I have an idea in mind for a good trip to
higher elevations that we might discuss when we get there.

As a further bit of incentive my personal contribution will be
breakfast on Saturday starting at 8:00 am in the form of omelettes
for whomever wants them, first come first serve as I just came into
3 dozen free eggs and have nothing better to do with them.  This
assuming I can even make an omelette on the Westy stove, I admit I
have not yet tried, might end up scrambled eggs.

Oh and FWIW one of the reasons my SO accepts me is her opinion of
my omelettes.
