Subject: Tom Wilson Head Torquing

If anyone out there has the Tom Wilson book &quot;How to Rebuild your VW 
aircooled engine,&quot; could you refresh me on what the torque is for heads 
and the torquing sequence? Please? I want to retorque my heads, but I 
don't have this book...and my friend who does is away on holiday.

Thanks! Joe
