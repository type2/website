&gt;I just returned from the parts store over lunch.  Not having owned an
&gt;gasoline powered car since 1980, its been a while since I purchased
&gt;spark plugs!  Now that we own a wasserboxer I thought I'd replace the
&gt;rotor, cap, wires and plugs.  Did you guys know that spark plugs now
&gt;have THREE &quot;prongs&quot;!  Never even heard of these critters before!
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there using these 3 pronged jobbers?  Comments?  What do
&gt;three prongs do for you?

I can't help you out with personal experiences with the three prong plugs,
but I do know they a widely used in VWs and Audis. I use Bosch platinum
only, I know there are some Vanagon owners that'll say other wise. But the
vehicle I put them in have better overall performance. This test was done
after only changing the plugs. IMHO
