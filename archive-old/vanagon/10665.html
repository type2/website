It's not as simple as a bug, where you can just park it on four bathroom
scales and add.   :)

Seriously tho, I had 29 people in my van one night and it didn't break.
I would guess, that that's about 5000 pounds of passenger weight plus
curb weight.
Needless to say, It didn't get above 2nd gear and took a long time to get
going fast enough for even that.
