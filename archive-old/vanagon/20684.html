Subject:       Re: '56 kombi - brakes (again)

&gt; What I find funny is that it seems like all split window busses have 
&gt; problems with the brakes.  :)  I want to replace everything on mine in 
&gt; the hope that t'll stop pulling to the right, and to stop the leaking 
&gt; master cylinder.  Does ANYONE on this list have a splitty with perfect 
&gt; brakes?

Strangely enough, I have a friend with a '64 Kombi that has PERFECT 
brakes!  He's never messed with them in the time he has had it.  You 
barely have the press the pedal, and they really grab!  Almost like a 
NORMAL CAR!  I get green with envy every time I drive it!
