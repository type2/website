Subject: Responses to  your inquiries (&amp; other misc. comments)

First I want to thank everyone who sent me comments, suggestions, 
well-wishes, etc.  Some of your ideas were excellent, and I'm going to make 
use of them.  Please keep 'em coming!

If you e-mailed me for a price quote and didn't get a response yet, please 
be patient.  I was absolutely overwhelmed with queries!!  I was answering 
them until about 2am Sat. morning (and again today), but had to do the 
mother's-birthday thing Saturday, and then list member Stefan Ufer came by 
Sat. evening.  If I didn't respond to you yet, I promise you a response 
tomorrow.  (If you don't get one, please let me know as it may mean I 
didn't get your query for some reason.)

Stefan Ufer, on the Type 2 list, drove up late Saturday afternoon from 
North Carolina in his '76 hardtop Westy to pick up a poptop for it.  We 
ended up talking about busses and listening to the Dead until late, and he 
left for home (about 9 hours away) again this morning.  It was a really 
great visit!  It's nice to be able to attach a face to the e-mail! Got a 
chance to see Richard Palmer's air-cooled search &amp; rescue shirt in person 
for the first time (Stefan was wearing one.)  Really nice.  Any chance of 
another batch, Richard?

Stefan is using a standard Bosch 02 sensor as an idle mixture/emissions 
sensor for his bus, to adjust his idle mixture with.  Could be very useful 
for tweeking a bus (or any VW) prior to emissions inspection (not to 
mention just to make it run better), and a heck of a lot cheaper than a 
&quot;real&quot; emissions tester.  Simple and cheap, I don't know why I never 
thought of it.  I'll let him expound on it when he gets a chance.

Thanks to all,
Ron Salmon
