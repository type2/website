Subject:      Re: PNW Camping Trip

This is a description of the proposed camping site. It was suggested by
Jim Arnott, a member of both Vanagon and Type II lists. Together with
him and Jack Manyard, we are trying to make this work out. We'll need
confirmations as soon as people know if they can or cannot make it. So,
once again, the preliminary plan is to go to Eastern Oregon, close to
Union, on the 13/14th Sept. weekend.
Jack and Ron Lussier are planning to set up a special list-serv, like
the CCC's, so we can organize events like this without wasting list
bandwidth.
Cris.

&gt;
&gt; I have been in contact w/ Cris.  (You see, I also subscribe to both
&gt; lists...)  Anyway, I went out to the campground this morning and foun
&gt; out the following:
&gt;
&gt; 18 campsites (easily hold 2-3 buses ea.)
&gt; $8.00 per night
&gt; They don't see any problem accomodating as many as show up.
&gt; They (both the ranger (a neighbor) and the campground host (a former
&gt; customer)) are excited about having the group stay there.
&gt;
&gt; I picked up a handful of brochures and I'll quote:
&gt;
&gt; from Oregon State Parks NE Oregon Campgrounds brochure:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The campground at Catherine Creek State Park provides 18 primitive
&gt; sites* with water and restrooms nearby.  Firewood is available for a
&gt; fee.  A day use picnic area is located alongside an arched bridge with
&gt; tables, restrooms and horseshoe pits.  THe campground is open April 15
&gt; through October 29.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The ranger tells me that they do NOT take reservations at this park, but
&gt; he feels that there should be no problem this late in the season. (and
&gt; he IS my neighbor...:) )
&gt;
&gt; &quot;*NOTE: Primitive sites have no electrical or sewer hookups, one water
&gt; source may serve multiple sites and there is no paved parking at most
&gt; sites.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Catherine Creek State Park is a scenic pristine area that has the Eagle
&gt; Cap Wilderness Area as a backdrop.  Bicycling , fishing and wildlife
&gt; viewing are popular activities within the park.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;To the east of the park, ice caves can be found on federal land.
&gt; Historically native inhabitants used this area for steelheading and
&gt; huckleberry picking.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Union County Museum, in Union, contains many historic items and related
&gt; programs.  To the north is the Cove Hot Springs pool, open to the
&gt; public.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Directions:
&gt;
&gt; I-84 east to the Union off ramp (#274?  I'll check later this week.)
&gt; Turn right. 10 miles to Union (watch for my house, 916 N. Main St.,
&gt; corner of Fir &amp; Main)  Turn left at Bork's Hardware, Beakman St. (Hwy.
&gt; 203).  Eight miles up on the right.  Tell the campground host that
&gt; you're with the VW group from the west side that Jim has been talking
&gt; about and he'll take good care of you.  (Jack, Cris, I'll get the
&gt; Interstate off-ramp # and measure precise milages if you'd like.)
&gt;
&gt; I guess that's about all.  Oh yeah,  District ranger is Larry Gruis in
&gt; the Meachum office and the local Ranger is Chris (the boss) or Gary
&gt; (seasonal aide) at the Catherine Creek Office (541)562-5427.
&gt;
&gt; If there is any thing else you need, either drop me a note or you can
&gt; call me between 10am and 2pm at (541)562-6044.
&gt;
&gt; Jim
