&gt;&gt;I believe you are wrong, the 86 wolsburg had black fiberglass bumpers, =
mags
&gt;&gt;and black non-power/non-heated mirrors

&gt;I've never heard of a model like this. Anybody else??




Look on page100 of the Brooklands Books &quot;Volkswagen Bus-Camper-Van =
1979-1989&quot;  There is a silver one on the upper half of the page.

By the way, on page 97 they mention a 12 seater '84 Caravelle Carat, I =
have never seen one, or could imagine the seating arangment.  Has anyone =
actually seen one of these?
