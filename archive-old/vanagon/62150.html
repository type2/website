Subject: Asbestos in VWs--Volkswagen Replies (sort of)


Received today from VW in response to my request for a written policy on
the hows and wheres of the asbestos &quot;parts exchange&quot;, aka covert reall. I
don't know why my address is all hacked up, but I get everything sent into
the domain so that was no use...
