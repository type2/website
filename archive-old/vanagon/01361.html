Subject: LiMBO last call for submissions/ads


Hi all!  Harris here.


I'm putting the next issue of the Late Model Bus Organization newsletter,
&quot;The Transporter&quot; to press tonight and I thought I'd go round and see if
anyone had any kind of submission or classified ad to place last minute.

To anyone in LiMBO-  You'll see the next issue in the first week of July,
and -BONUS- you'll see the continuation of Joel Walker's fabulous article
&quot;Guide to Type IIs,&quot;  this issue covering 1975-1991 models.

If anyone has any classified ads or articles to send, e-mail 'em
to me at:  hupham_at_fscvax.fsc.mass_dot_edu

You can read ads to me over the phone or fax 'em, too, if you feel like it.
(508) 343-8907


Harris
