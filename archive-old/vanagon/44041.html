Subject: Re: Amp output for 1600 generator?
Date: Mon, 10 Jun 1996 15:17:39 -0500 (CDT)

&gt; &gt; Anyone know what the amp output on a stock 1600 generator is?
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the basic 12V generator had a 30A max output, so your 3A

I wasn't going to answer this since I have incomplete information but 
I guess I will now, just to add to the confusion.  Some of the bus 
generators put out 38 amps.  It is stamped into the casting.  This is 
the ....17x generator that is ~3/8&quot; longer than the others and has 
the indented tin to fit the longer length.  The ....15x is the 30 amp 
model.  What I don't know is exactly which years had this one.  My '71
does.  Hope this helps more than it hurts.  Jim
