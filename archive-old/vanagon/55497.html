&gt; Hi folks, I'm havingt trouble opening my sliding door! It seem that the
&gt; little wheel on the outside of the van is not running along the track like
&gt; it should. When I try to open the door the wheel falls of the track on the
&gt; inside side? Kinda a weird to explain. It seems to be very lose. I tryed to
&gt; take the panel off but it seems that u have to do more than take the two
&gt; screews off??? Can anyone help me with this.
&gt; 
&gt; Ps I hope I don't have to take the door off to replace that slider wheel?:(

	Sounds like you have a bad bearing. These bearings are the exact same
as what's in in-line skates. If you don't have any call the dealer for a
price quote. Then call me, I'll send you the bearings for free. Take out
the screws and firmly apply force upwards on the panel. Do it gently,
don't dent it or anything. Inside on the track the bearings run in,
right in the middle, is a dent in which you can lift the door up and
away from the track. Use a box to support the door. 
	I hope you can identify where the bearings go. When I did mine, they
were completely gone. I don't exactly recall, but there are two screws
that hold the bearings to the door. Actually, the bearings are held on
with snap rings, but if you can remove the two screws you can take the
bearing holder inside to work on. One bearing was easy to remove and
replace. The other only had the inner race left and was hard to remove,
until I hit it with a hammer and it simply broke away. 
	Install the new bearings, lube everything up and you're in business.
