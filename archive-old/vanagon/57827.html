You blew up the disk or pressure plate.  If disc, the cause was a bad pilot 
bearing or worn out main shaft.  Also, make sure clutch was not a Chinese 
special.  I've had a few fail on me in a short time.  I only use Sachs or LUK 
now.  Especially in a Syncro.  To all getting clutch work done,  you want to 
see the boxes the parts came in.  Most suppliers are now getting junk clutches 
for many cars.  Even Beck Arnley is passing some junk.
