Subject: RE: gas heater vs. H2O heater

Tony M asks whether he should keep a late aircooled or an early watercooled
Vgon.  I would like to be true to my school, but I think in terms of heating
the watercooled vans definitely have the advantage.  One detail to consider
is whether your passengers are typically in the second seat (which the
aircooleds heat) or the third seat (which the watercooleds heat).  The gas
heater in the aircooled makes lots of heat right away, and can be used for
preheating, but is an additional mechanism to maintain, and since it is a
part of the fuel system it can't be maintained casually.

The key advantage of the aircooleds is the ease of upgrade to six cylinders;
I think that's what should happen to all the straight rustfree aircooled
Vgons.
