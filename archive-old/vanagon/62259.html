Subject: The Idiot's Guide?

Hello all,
	I was just wondering how many folks who have only driven the watercooled
vw have every read Muir's book?
	I'm prejudiced, I learned, really learned, about cars with his book, a '59
bus and some tools. 
	Lot's of useful info in there. The tools, the mechanic tips, how to buy a
vw, what to do while waiting for it to cool! Yes some of the technical data
won't help, (with hydraulic lifters you aren't going to be adjusting the
valves), but a lot will.
	Muir's book entertains and gets you started, the Bentley shows you where
it is on your bus. 
	Just my opinion. I do wonder how many bus folks out there haven't seen it?
	Have a good 4th of July!
