So William Abbott says:
&gt; 	How about &quot;Shiden&quot;- Japanese for violet lightening. (Figures
&gt; they'd have names for the different colors, yes?)
&gt; 
&gt; 	Better, &quot;Her Majesty Shiden&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Then again, what's wrong with &quot;Purple Haze&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Help me!
&gt; 	*Help* me!
&gt; 	Oh... Purple Haze...

    &quot;Is it tomorrow,
          Or just the End of time?&quot;
       
   That's what I say every morning after the alarm goes off!  ;)
