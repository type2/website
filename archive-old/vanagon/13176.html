Hi Martha:

I was there for disaster assistance (took some personal time off). Things happened so 
fast I did not have time to get on my computer here to get a contact list or anything.

Thought about many of you and wondered if I was seeing some on the highways but 
didn't have an option to do more than look and wonder.

Got to see my grandchildren (I got excited because the 13-month child decided to start 
walking - towards me even).

I tried and tried to find one but, as I mentioned, there was not a Eurovan in California 
to be seen.

Could it be that after the first seven days and nights of rain the Eurovan owners 
started a 40-day countdown and headed for the higher country? :)
