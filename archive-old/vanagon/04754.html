&gt;i got you ALLLLL beat:  1994 Chevy Suburban, limo tint, neon license plate,
&gt;12-inch offset wheels with teenie-tiny tires. brand new, no less. now ...
&gt;them big suckers ain't cheap. and he goes and does THAT kind of 'custom'
&gt;work to it??? ol' P.T.Barnum was right! :)

Nope.  Not even close.

You gotta have:

neon running board light and whip antenna.
Oakley sticker across the windhield.
Gold plated rims.  Here in Sacramento, people literally get pulled out of
  their cars and SHOT for those gold wheels!
Bad Boy Club or some cheezy car club sticker on the back window, ie
  &quot;Wet DreemZ&quot;  (seriously!)
knock-offs on the wheels
gold-plated trim.
Nagel-esqe mural on the hood and tailgate
curb-feelers
TV-antenna on the back
chrome louvers on the doors, hood, tailgate, etc
Hydraulic bed, able to tilt to all positions
Crystal chandelier inside the passenger compartment
velvet diamond tuck interior

I could go on...
