&gt; Okay, going to make this short and sweet:
&gt; 
&gt; I need an engine for my '69 Westy.  I would like to get a complete one,
&gt; rebuilt w/ new accessories if possible.  I only want a single port, single
&gt; releif engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I am about to order a GEX longblock for $800.  If you have ANYTHING THAT IS
&gt; POSSIBLY BETTER LET ME KNOW!
&gt; 
&gt; I am in Stockton, CA which is near Sacramento.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

good.
