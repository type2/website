&gt;Here are some beautiful Siku 1/64 scale cars I just got in from
&gt;Germany. I will be carrying more varieties in the future. This is my
&gt;first sample run. All cars are mint in blisterpacks. All are
&gt;BEAUTIFULLY desigend, most with AUTHENTIC wheels!!! The detail is great
&gt;on these cars. I have a bunch in my own personnal collection and love
&gt;them! Each car has it's engine size, displacement, horsepower, torque,
&gt;and top speed (along with another figure I have not been able to figure
&gt;out yet) listed on the underside of the car! I only have 1-3 of each
&gt;car so hurry!
