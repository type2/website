Real-life Welfare Quotations

The following are taken from actual letters received by the Welfare
Department in applications for support (no bull sh**)

1.  I am forwarding my marriage certificate and 6 children. I had seven
but one died which was baptised on a half sheet of paper.

2.  I am writing the welfare department to say that my baby was born two
years old. When do I get my money?

3.  Mrs. Jones has not had any clothes for two years and has been visited
regularly by the clergy.

4.  I cannot get sick pay. I have six children can you tell me why?

5.  I am glad to report that my husband who is missing is dead.

6.  This is my eighth child. What are you going to do about it.

7.  Please find for certain if my husband is dead. The man I am now
living with can't do anything until he knows.

8.  I am very much annoyed to find out that you have branded my son
illiterate. This is a dirty lie as I was married a week before he was
born.

9.  In answer to your letter, I have given birth to a son weighing 10
lbs.  I hope this is satisfactory.

10.  I am forwarding my marriage certificate and my 3 children one of
which is a mistake as you can see.

11.  My husband got his project cut off about two weeks ago and I haven't
 had any relief since.

12.  Unless I get my husband's money pretty soon, I will be forced to
lead  an immortal life.

13.  You have my changed little boy to a girl, will this make any 
difference?

14.  I have no children yet, as my husband is a truck driver and works 
night and day.

15.  I want money as quick as I can get it. I have been in bed with the
doctor for two weeks and he doesn't do me any good. If things don't
improve, I will have to send for another doctor.

16.  In accordance with your instructions, I have given birth to twins in
 the enclosed envelope.
