Subject: Wanted:  How to Keep your Rabbit Alive (later edition)

I understand that later copies of this now out-of-print Muir Publications 
book covered the early wasserboxer Vanagons.  I'd love to find a used copy. 
I posted this request once before, and a listmember kindly sold me a copy 
for ten bucks, but alas it was an earlier edition that predates the 
wasserboxer.  Does anyone have a later edition they would sell, or can they 
confirm that it does indeed cover the Vanagon motor?

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
