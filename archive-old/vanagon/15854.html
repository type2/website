&gt;Yes, I agree with Alistair -- you can take your plastic window trim out,
&gt;but if you want to replace it, you will need to remove and reinstall the
&gt;glass.  I would even suspect you would want to buy new trim, rather than
&gt;painting the old, as it is pretty brittle after all these years of sunshine.
&gt;My vote: take it out and leave it out.
&gt;B.

I have taken mine out of the front and back windows with no problems so far
(it's been about three months)
