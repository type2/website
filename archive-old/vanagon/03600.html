Hah!  Same here.  I had a nice looking Pioneer digital auto-reverse deck in
the dash.  Biggest piece of junk I have ever owned.  Stopped working one
day and I was just too lazy to take it out.  The person who stole my van
was nice enough not to break any windows, but did destroy my steering
column and rip holes in my paneling to get the 6&quot; Craig speakers out. 
Go figure.  I go the stealth route now.  Stereo is in the glove box,
box speakers behind the seats.  Haven't had a problem since!
