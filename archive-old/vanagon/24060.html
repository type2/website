Subject:      Re: Road sign interpretations - (F)

anybody remember Burma Shave??? :)  and those idiotic little signs they
used to put alongside the road?
  &quot;If you                                 Ben
      don't know                             met Anna
         whose signs                            made a hit
            these are                              neglected beard
               you can't have                         Ben-Anna split!
                   driven very far!                      Burma Shave.
                      Burma Shave.

or the signs folks used to paint on the farmer's barns and silos?
&quot;See Rock City&quot;, and that sort of stuff. i guess billboards kinda put them
out of business ... or the lack of farmers nowadays. around here, we had
one fellow with two large silos right by an old highway. Schlitz beer paid
him some money and painted those silos to look just like two big tall cool
cans of beer. quite impressive as you rounded the curve.
