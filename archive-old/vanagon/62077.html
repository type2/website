&gt;My question is, Where do I start?  
&gt;
&gt;Because of all the discussion on the list of just the right coolant, etc.,
&gt;and since i managed to make it home, i hesitated to just fill up the tank
&gt;with water.  I have a Bentley manual, if someone wants to refer to that.
&gt;
&gt;Will appreciate any suggestions.  I've hesitated even to drive it because
&gt;it's been so hot here, the the weekend has been beautiful and moderate.

Hi Gail,

Well, it's hard to tell how much you taxed your engine/cooling system
without now exactly how far you drove it with low coolant.  In the
first place, I wouldn't panic.  I'd top it off with coolant, then
run the engine at 2000 RPM for a minute or so and then check to see
if you need more coolant.  Run the engine again and add coolant as
needed until it stops going down.  Then, taking your gallon of 50/50
mix of water/coolant with you, go on a test drive around your neigh
borhood for 5 minutes and stop and see how the coolant is doing.  If
it needs more add some, if not drive on for another 5 - 10 minutes
and then check it again.  You get the idea.  I'd keep an eye on 
the coolant level from then on every time I stopped.  

Just a note.  I recently had my coolant changed at the dealer and
had to top off the coolant as well and it took several additional
top offs before it stopped going down.  You should also bleed the
system too once it has stopped going down from your initial topping
off exercise.  

I don't think I need to tell you that you should check your coolant
reserve at least once a week absolutely sure your not losing coolant.
I usually check it along with check my oil and power steering level.

&gt;From what you stated, I kind of doubt that anything too serious is
wrong, but don't hold me to it.  Just get the coolant back to where
it needs to be and drive it around.  If it drives okay, then it probably
is okay.  If you have further problems with the fan coming on or the
light blinking, then you may need to have it checked out.  But I think
once you get the coolant back up and full, you should be okay.

Let us know how it goes.

Good Luck!
Steven
