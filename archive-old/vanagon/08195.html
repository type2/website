Subject: Re: 34-PICT 3 questions


VW Folks:

I couldn't agree more with Bill here; I hacked off the plunger part of 
the E-mag. cutoff but replaced it 1 month later.  I also re-hooked-up 
the choke, where I had disconnected it, a la Muir.  Here's why:  

Cold mornings:  major hesitation, noxious odor of unburnt gas.

Hot afternoons:  turn key off, wait until run-on ceases (releasing clutch 
pedal jolts car backwards).  

With e-mag. cutoff/choke, smooth starts, smooth stops.  The 34-pict seems 
to like it this way.

&gt; 	Jim,
&gt; 	St. Muir was a good and fine man, but I wouldn't bother
&gt; to unhook the electromagnetic cutoff (Which is actually an
&gt; electromagnetic enabler- it only allows gas through when you
&gt; put 12V across it.) Meaning to say, where is the possible harm
&gt; in the thing, as long as it works? If it broke, I'd be strongly
&gt; inclined to blank it off, but that's a separate issue, and depends
&gt; on how much is needed to fill the resulting hole. Certainly, metric
&gt; threaded bolts suggest themselves...
&gt; 
&gt; 	Regarding the electric choke, it certainly true that a poorly
&gt; functioning choke will make the engine run poorly, AND put out a
&gt; far-too-rich mixture, which will dilute the oil and foul the plugs
&gt; and other bad things. I'd overhaul everything, and see if it will
&gt; idle without the choke after the overhaul. If you find yourself pumping
&gt; the pedal to keep the engine running when cold, then you're using the
&gt; accelerator pump to accomplish the same enrichment the choke it intended
&gt; to acomplish. But you can stop pumping as soon as the engine doesn't
&gt; need it. Do you want to give the engine the very least enrichment
&gt; possible, using yourself as the control element? Or do you want the
&gt; engine to start and idle feet-off? Attention versus convenience.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I certainly use the manual choke to start the neighborhood
&gt; rototiller, or my father-in-law's '63 Triumph Herald.
