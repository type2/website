Hey y'all --

The lineage is purely spiritual, as I'm sure you-all (suthern colloquialism
the rest of the world should appropriate r'at now -- mind you i'm a 
californian who's settled in new england and i've got family in the 
South...) understand by now if y'all can handle long parentheticals.

My dad was a true hippie -- that's why my mom divorced him and I haven't seen
him since.   I think he was more into Bikes (not the human-powered kind)...

My step-dad was into VW's but wouldn't admit it.  At least my mom was a good
judge of character, and my now-wife-of-9-years bought me a $100-squareback-
that lasted-5-years-and-is-probably-still-running-in-Ohio so here I am....

Life's great, ain't it?  
Looking forward to the gathering at Ben&amp;Jerry's  -- now what's that
date again?

-- 

Peace.
