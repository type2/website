I had that problem on my '66.  As you may know, the P/C set 
comes with wire clips.  So I bought some cir-clip type to replace them.
I guess they worked... only had them in about 15k miles.  But then I had 
the wire ones break within about 20k miles.

I never had a piston pin clip break, in i dont know how many 10k miles.
   Actually i never heard of it before.  It cant be that common.
