Subject:      EV shift linkage

I have a '93 EV MV in which I just lost all gears except 3rd&amp;4th. The
shifter went completely &quot;limp&quot; or very sloppy. I suspected problems with
the linkage. Sure enough a $1.75 nylon bushing on top of the
transmission fell apart. This allowed part of the linkake to come out of
the bushing therefore causing the inability to shift. The bushing has a
raised lip on each end. Anyone ever have this problem? How do I get the
new bushing into it's metal holder with lips on both ends?
                Thanks, Rod
