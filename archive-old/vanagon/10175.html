Subject: The case of the missing brake fluid.
Date: Wed, 18 Jan 95 16:05:17 EST

Several weeks ago, I posted a message about how the brake fluid reservoir
had dropped to a dangerously low level just below the take up tube to the
clutch master cylinder.Result? Clutch pedal goes to the floor with no
clutch action. Since then I had filled the reservoir 
and was able to &quot;pump  up&quot; the system to again have a working clutch. Now
today I went outside to do the weekly start-up (the Westy is in storage-no
point in ruining it with the salt on the roads). Guess what? The fluid is
down exactly at the point just below the clutch fluid tube. Normally I would
say &quot;ok there is definitely a leak somewhere&quot;. BUT, I can't find a leak
anywhere and since the van hasn't moved in all this time, you would think
a puddle would be reasonably easy to see. What gives? Are my eyes failing
me? Has the fluid vapourized?  Has it been transported to a distant
planet? 

TIA - DC
