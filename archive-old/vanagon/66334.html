Subject:      Re: Suburban Heater

Friends,
Have any of you tried a Suburban RV furnace heater?  I know they make
12,000 and 16,000 BTU models which will fit under the rear seat of a
Westy.  Price seems high, though.  I was quoted $750.00 for a full
installation, including an auxillary battery and isolater.  Hope
someone's tried this thing, because I'm tempted.  Info needed!
