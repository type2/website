Subject: Re: More WWW sites

I sent them email asking for the account number and everything and they
never responded back to me. Has anybody ever got on to this thing yet. First
one to get on here and download all the bulletins is obligated to repost to
the list! :)

&gt;Another cool WWW site, 
&gt;
&gt;http://www.alldata.tsb_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt;This list almost all Technical Service Bulletins for any
&gt;and I mean any car, hell even a friends, '79 Dodge Challenger,
&gt;quite a few listed for Vanagons of all years and all other 
&gt;VW's.  These people will give you 10 free minutes to download
&gt;complete bulletins then the price gets pretty steep, but still,
&gt;its an easy way to look and see what's available on you car, and
&gt;then you can take your free ones on something you really think
&gt;might help.
