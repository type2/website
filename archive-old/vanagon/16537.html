Subject: bodega/mistix update


Just phoned in my reservations to Mistix (1.800.444.7275,
for those of you with short memories).  

You may encounter the same EXTREMELY stupid sales person I did,
and if so, they won't have heard of Bodega Dunes.  If so, use
the term &quot;Sonoma Coast State Beach,&quot; instead, which comprises
both Bodega Dunes and Wright's Beach, and then just make sure
you tell them you want Bodega Dunes specifically.  

There's a $5 fee for the additional vehicles (2 per site total allowed),
which can be paid upon park entry.  

Schwarze:  eat your heart out!  THIS one has showers! *exxxtacy!!*
Anyway, check in time is 2 p.m, and check out is noon.  If I recall
before, sometimes places like this are rather loose about this,
and if they have space available, may allow check in earlier.  For
more info, you can call 1.707.875.3483 and ask about that.  The
answer may vary depending on how friendly a person answers the phone,
and what kind of day they are having  :)
