Subject: Bus Belly Pans

&amp;&amp; you want to call them available on post 68' vans (i,e,the pan that &amp;&amp;
bolts underneath the the cab section's pedals and cables?

&gt; If these do exist for the 68-71 (or later) breadloaves, I'd sure like 
&gt;them.  Nothing like driving on a slushy day and getting delayed 
&gt; responses from both clutch and accelerator pedals--scary!!  Plus, I 
&gt; imagine some  reduction in engine/road noise...

I do believe these exist as I recently fought one at the local U-Pull-It
to get access to the shifter linkage on a 7/74 Bus.  If I remember there
were three 10mm bolts holding the pan on (it looks like a shallow
wheel barrow pan without the wheels) with a small sheet metal dimple where
the bottom of the steering box went.

I remember my old 69 Westie had one as we improvised one winter
when living in N.Carolina and used said pan as a snow sled for my
then smallish daughter.... She loved it!
