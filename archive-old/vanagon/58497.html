Please note that this only applies to vehicles with a rear weight bias, such as the Vanagon.

This does not apply to the Eurovan or any other front engined vehicles (except for a very 
small minority (front mid-engined)).

&gt;I would like to comment on the recommended psi your tire guy recommended:\
&gt;
&gt;According to my tire guy - who I have used for some 12 years, with tires on
&gt;2 Westies and 3 toyotas (2 of the 4 x 4s) you should never inflate front and
&gt;rear the same. Front tires (and the vehicle specs) require lower inflation
&gt;than rear to prevent &quot;over steer.&quot; That is, loss of control in quick moves
&gt;especially! This could cause you to loose control and . . . .
&gt;
&gt;Just offering this info for what it is worth - but if your tire people say &quot;40
&gt;psi all round&quot; I would have to question their expertise!
