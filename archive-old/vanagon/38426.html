For your information:
On this list I have seen someone wondering about the availability of 
the  VR6 in the Eurovans. In case you have missed it &quot;over there&quot;, 
here are something I read in a magazine from the norwegian VW 
importer:

The 2,8 litre VR6 engine is now available in the new generation 
Caravelle (Eurovan).
It is the same engine as in the Golf, Passat and Sharan but the 
specifications are as follows:
140hp and  240Nm at 3200rpm.
Acceleration is 8,5 s from 0 to 80 km/h, top speed is 174km/h.
Fuel consumption is 8,5 l/100km at 90 km/h and 14,5 l/100km in 
&quot;city traffic&quot;. This is better than the  2,5 l gas engine.

Even more economic is the new 5 cyl. 2,5 l TDI (diesel with turbo 
and intercooler.)
This is the same engine as in the Audi A6, but tuned to have more 
torque at lower rpm.
The specifications are 102hp and 250Nm at 1900-2300rpm.
(more than 200Nm in the range 1600-3200rpm)  
Acceleration is 11,9 s from 0 to 80 km/h, top speed is 157km/h.
Fuel consumption is 6,6 l/100km and 8,8 l/100km.

The new Caravelle will have new headlights and the nose is 12 cm 
longer to accomodate the bigger engine. New gear ratios, new 
exhaustsystem and new engine mounts reduces noise, and the front 
axle/suspension  is improved to minimize the front wheel drive's 
effect on the steering. Rear brake discs is also new. Dashboard is 
also more like the Passat.

The Transporter vans will have the same front as before.As a 
curiosity: A new option on the doublecab. pickup is a integrated 
hydraulic system, which can tip the dropside aluminium body, or via 
outlets in the front, operate snowploughs and sweeping gear.
