Subject: 82 Vanagon Exhaust parts ? 


I have an 82' Vanagon (2.0L, aircld, feul-inj), non-California exhaust
system, for which I am seeking new/used replacement parts. Would anyone
have any leads on persons or parts shops from whom I could get (trade,
purchase, etc.) these parts ?

I need:

1) EGR filter unit

2) Cross-Over pipe

or worse comes to worse, I'd consider purchasing the complete (no holes)
exhaust system (EGR, Cross-Over, Catalytic Converter, Muffler, etc.).

Thanks, Chris
