Subject: Wiring Troubles



Dear all,


  I started to fit the wiring in my '62 at the weekend, this is the last thing i 
 have to do before it will be on the road,  and i ran into the problem of, on the
 dash there is two knobs one either side of the steering wheel one operates the 
 headlights the other one the windscreen wipers, which side does each one go as
 they were not fitted when i bought the van.

Cheers,

Ben Ryan
