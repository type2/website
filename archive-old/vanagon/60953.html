&gt;I finally got the Redline MTL into the transmissin and front differential 
&gt;in my '87 Syncro GL last weekend.  It took just about the entire weekend, 

I personally went through all of this myself about nine months ago with
similar trials to yours and huge outpouring of time. 

I was thinking that if you sawed off a 1 inch piece of allen head wrench and
jammed it into the drail plug on the tranny, then perhaps it would fit
without your having to remove the skid plate. Then, you could turn that
allen head with a wrench that just might fit in the space between the skid
plate and the tranny.
