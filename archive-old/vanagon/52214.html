Subject: Re: steering rack parts


(Die Busbesitzergruppe or Die Gruppe der Busbesitzer, I told you.)

I'm also on search for a power steering rack since half a year.
I have one spare from AUDI, but it do not fit. On Vanagon the
steering arms to the wheels are going out of the ends of the
actuator, on AUDI (I guess also the Quantum) the arms are going
out of the middle section of the actuator. But in functionality
they are equal to each other.

I asked a salvage yard for a whole power steering set. He want to
have DM 900.- for all. That's too much I like to spend for.

Has anyone been able to locate power steering rack parts for vanagons?  I
have a friend who rebuilt his own rack on a Quantum, and I'm assuming the
racks are nearly the same.  He said the job was very easy, and that it ran
reliably after the rebuild.  So, if I can find the parts, I may give it a
try on the syncro

thanks for the help
(ps if not parts, anyone got a cheap rack FS?)
