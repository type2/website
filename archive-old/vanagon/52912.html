Charles, 
could you describe exactly what part of the computer was shorting
against the side of the van. On my '86 Syncro Westy, the computer is
screwed to the wooden panel that forms the left side of the box under
the read seat. The metal box which contains the computer is connected to
a grounded wire. Larry

&gt; I had the same problem with my '86.  Check the computer unit under the rear
&gt; seat, mine was shorting out against the side of the van. Fixed with a piece
&gt; of cardboard between the unit and the van. My '91 has plastic spacers.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Last night while driving on the highway my engine cut out for a second or
&gt; &gt; two, I was turning about 4000 rpm. It felt like the igniton was turned
&gt; off,
&gt; &gt; this has happened twice before in the last six months. There were no
&gt; &gt; indications before or after. This is an '87 Syncro. Anybody have any
&gt; ideas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks
