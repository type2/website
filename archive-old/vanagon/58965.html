&lt;&lt; Whilst I was paying for the item my son 
 spotted a Concept One in the showroom. As we were looking at it a 
 salesman says &quot;why not take it for a test drive?&quot;, so my son hoped on and 
 scooted away. It was a nice shade of blue with silver mags and conti 
 tires. It was a lot smaller than I expected. Weh it came time to go my 
 son wouldn't leave the car behind so I had to buy it - my first new VW! &gt;&gt;


Geez - you had me goin' there for a bit!  :&lt;)
