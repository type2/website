&gt;Does anybody know of a maker of an exhaust system for the vans (mine is a
&gt;'90 Syncro) that makes a system from stainless steel?  I am trying to do
&gt;some research before I am forced to buy more VW shares!

you might want to check with a company in california named Borla. they make
stainless exhaust parts for other cars. when i was in the market for a
muffler for my 88 bus, i didn't want to pay the $520 for the vw stock
replacement, so i called Borla and some others. the Borla guy said they didn't
make anything 'at that time', but that since he owned an 84 vanagon, he was
thinking about doing it. that was last year, and they might have actually
done something by now.

eventually, i succumbed to the OEM-syndrome, and found a dealer who would
sell me the vw muffler for $300. :( don't think i'll do that next time.
