Subject: this is a bust

&gt;&gt;I'm planning on driving my '77 non-hippie, normal colored, van from here
&gt;&gt;in Lubbock to Tacoma WA for school.  What are you all's experiences with
&gt;&gt;getting stopped/harassed by police for driving a van?  Being an 18 year
&gt;&gt;old male probably doesn't help... have any of you actually been pulled
&gt;&gt;over and serched for drugs?
&gt;&gt;Since I'm not the original owner (it is only 4 months younger than me),
&gt;&gt;should I worry about someone's stach hidden in the seat cushin or
&gt;&gt;something? 
&gt;&gt;Or is it stupid to worry about that since I don't use drugs?
&gt;&gt;

I have been pulled over once in 72 bus.  It was two days after i bought it
and had not yet gotten it register(ie no plates).   I have quite long hair
and do some what resemple a hippy.   The cop gave me no hassle despite not
having plates, turnsignals and breaklights(break lights still don't work, no
switch in trans(suggestions??))

I am the 4th owner of my bus.  At somepoint i am going to rip out the
interior and look for a the lost things and drugs people got about.
There were days i worried about this.

Good luck
