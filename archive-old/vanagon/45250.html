Subject: Window Replacement

Some idiot smashed out a vent window and a sliding window in my Vanagon to
grab my stereo without the faceplate. I won't go into the details because it
still makes me mad but now I need to replace the windows.

The vent window just bolts on but the latch is another story. I still have
the old latch but I can't seem to figure out how it comes apart to put it in
the hole in the glass. I was never good at the Rubik's Cube either. 

The sliding window looks harder. My mechanic gave me the window out of an old
wrecked van at his place so I have the window. The question is how to get it
in??? Am I going to have to take the whole window assembly out???

This whole situation sucks, criminals suck, and I'm hoping I can get some
feedback that will help and keep me from becoming an advocate for capital
punishment.

TIA..............Jeff Short
