Subject: Vanagon door locks

	Taking lock cylinders out is easy, but remember to put the key
in the cylinder before you do! Besides lining up all the little metal
pieces so that you *can* it, the key actually traps them because it goes 
through the middle of them. On door handles, look for a Philips head screw
that holds the lock cylinder to a little lever and the spring that rotates
the lever (and thus cylinder) back to the neutral position. 

	Naturally, take them apart and put them together one at a time,
so you can refer to one that's put together when you are reassembling.

	I personally prefer light oil or WD40 for cleaning
locks as opposed to killer parts cleaners, since I *don't* intend to 
disassemble and clean off all the cleaner- you want a cleaner that'll
either evaporate or not be a problem if some is left in there. Brake
cleaner is an alternative. 
	I pump oil all through the cylinder/wafers/key assembly and then, 
holding it in a clean towel or rag, and restraining the wafers with my 
fingers, slide the key in and out of the keyway. A little oil down the keyway
will flush out the most amazing crud... the predictable mix of dust
and old grease that's been baked for years.

	If your lock goes &quot;spoing&quot; and parts fly all over the place,
I'm sorry. It hasn't happened to me so far. I'd take the remains and the
other lock(s) to the lock-smith. They can make it all better.

	When the cylinder is clean, I put some high-temp wheel bearing
grease on it from the outside, cycle the key a few more times. Then I clean
the bore it came out of, the spring and the little arm that
unlocks the door latch, replace the little o-ring seal and put it all back
together. Then dry the key with cloth, towel or rag, in sert and operate
the lock, remove, dry, and repeat until the key comes out agreeably dry.

	Its cool the way they're put together- a fun clean and re-assemble
project that will leave you feeling good about yourself and your old
car.

	Bill
