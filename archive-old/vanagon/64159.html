Van Run 	Man Happy
	After taking everyones good advice and following the bentley book again
and redoing the grounds again,  I checked the whole harness for grounds to
non-grounded wires.  All OK. then i was checking for shorts to each other
and i found a short between two of the hallsender wires.   after digging
into the harness i found a sheilded wire that goes to the Idle
stabilization Unit and found that the sheild was shorted to the wire. after
cleaning that up she started right up.  Whew no ECU purchase needed. Thanks
for all the help i find the list just the crutch i need to keep this
wonderful machine running.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'am at the end of my rope. My 86 double Cab hasn't run since late June.

&gt; It just quit on the way home one evening it would start but won't keep
&gt; running.  I cleaned the grounds up and away we went for a coupla miles.
&gt; Then she quit altogether.  I found there was no spark. I replaced the
spark
&gt; plugs, rotor, dist cap and one spark plug wire.    then the was no fuel. 

&gt; so i took the harness apart and fix the multiple ground connection at the
&gt; front of the engine, the fuel came back.   But still no spark.  I rang
out
&gt; wires to the ECU, cleaned the coil connections tested the coil as per
&gt; bentley OK.   brings me to the Hall sender  I tried testing it with a
&gt; multimeter(digital Fluke 77) but didn't get a blip. Bentley says to use a
&gt; digital probe.  I also did the ground the center lead of the plug to the
&gt; hall center to get 4.5Volts across the coil and didn't get change in
&gt; voltage.   I tested all the other switches and the air box and all appear

&gt; OK.   As i type this it seems like i have to bite the bullet and replace
&gt; the ECU.   I am not too enthsiastic about this as the ECU was replaced 2
&gt; years ago and i feel that these should last the life of the vehicle and
not
&gt; less then the life of the exhaust pipes. Any advice or suggestions would
be
&gt; welcome.
