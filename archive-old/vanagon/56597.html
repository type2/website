Subject: Re: Air-cooled to Water-cooled

&gt;| There's a guy with a web page who installed a water cooled toyota motor
&gt;| into a breadloaf westy. It's painted like a cow, pretty wild. I can't
&gt;| remember the url but he goes into some detail of the transplant on his
&gt;| page.

	If you do a search on the archives for &quot;Road Cow&quot;, it should turn up the
address. I thought I had it bookmarked, but I cannot find it now..
