Been there done that and converting your AA Maglight (tm) to use a high power
amber LED is pretty easy.  Gitchasef the LED in question.  Makeyasef a between 
the cells droppin resistor.  Yank out the &quot;Krypton&quot; incandescent.  Trim 
the leads on the LED, hawg out the hole in the reflector to slide over the LED,
shove it in, stick that resistor disk between the cells and vwalah!  A purty
bright amber LEDLITE,  Mind you not as bright as either the inventor or the
standard maglight/krypto set up but hey the AAs only need to provide 20ma and 
at a typ of 550maH datsa loong service life.

F'rinstance:

HLMA-CL00 (1000-3000)mcd _at_ 594nm (amber) _at_ 20-30ma with Vf ~2.0V nice light.

or HLMA-BL00 13.3 mm Diam. 3deg viewing angle 592nm but woh! 15,000 mcd _at_20ma

Czech it out buttcha gotta like amber.

Didja git that Joel?
