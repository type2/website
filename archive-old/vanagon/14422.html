Howdy,

	I recieved the new cab floor sections today from West Coast Metric.  I
also got some engine lid screws and gas-filler-neck-rubber-thingy.

	The floor pans suck.  I did a sample fit, and they are &quot;sorta close&quot;
but they will need some persuasion before I can weld them in.  I wonder if
A) the joker who made them never tried to put them in, or B) these are
some sort of funky universal piece that will fit '49 to '89 or something...

	This reflects the experiences I've had with other body-bits, so
my conclusion is to never buy body panels from them again.  The only reason
I did was I already had a credit...  Das Bulli Haus in the future for
me.

	It won't be too hard for me to &quot;adjust&quot; them, but someone with 
lesser mechanical skills might have a problem.
	
	The other bits are good, however.

Thom
