Subject:      Second Battery for Westy

I have a 1987 Westy GL USA model

That big space under the driver's seat is calling to me to fit another
battery.
I want to put in a second battery, but I am not sure how to go about it.
I want the battery to drive the fridge and lights and I want the engine to
charge it (Naturally).
But, I don't want it to crank the starter - I don't want to put in the
heavy duty cables.

My Bently manual (Section 97.9a) shows what seems to be a simple wiring
job, but there is no detail.
It look like all I have to do is to hook up the new battery to the battery
cut-out relay.

I can't find the cut-out relay.

Has anyone out there done this? How do I do it? Where is the relay?

Thanks for your help.
