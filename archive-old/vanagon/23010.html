          hey rusty, fellow fossil you, when my son was 14 and
          aspiring to be a guitar god i of course attempted to steer
          him away from the glam rockers of the day and turned him on
          to hendrix, beck, hooker, etc.  one day he was playing
          &quot;watchtower&quot; with a vengeance and i played him the original.
          he was crushed to learn that jimi didn't write this and
          turned to classical which he is now a master of in his 2nd
          year at music school.  but he's not all bad, he drives a '60
          beetle (vw content!).   p.s.- i just installed my
          beautifully straightened (by me) and painted deluxe rear
          bumper last weekend on the '66 kombi.  last night i was
          rear-ended by a driver who was too busy reading while
          driving and it's not so beautiful anymore. :^(((  the state
          trooper who came to the scene waved it all off with his&quot;long
          arm&quot; and said &quot;it's so minor damage that it's not worth
          writing up&quot; and advized us to swap insurance info.  he
          turned to me and said &quot; this can't be worth much can it?&quot;
          obviously he never sat for hours on end with the hammer and
          sandpaper and paint, lovingly bringing a part back to life.
          ray   bummed but not beaten
