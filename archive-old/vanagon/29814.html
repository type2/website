Subject: V6anagon: Get your kicks on Rte 66


Hi, all...

Tomorrow evening (Thursday) I'm flying to Missouri, there to pick up
the '80 Vanagon with the Chev 2800 V6 engine, and (I hope) drive it
back to San Diego. Bob Hufford of list fame, has graciously offered
me a ride from the airport to the V6anagon's soon-to-be-ex domicile,
in exchange for a chance to test drive the creature, plus bribes to
be named later.

I sincerely hope that this &quot;saga&quot; will be about 1/100 as interesting
as Hoover's recent Pacific Northwest jaunt-- or less. Get in, turn key,
point it west, stop for gas a few times, arrive in San Diego, shut off
key, get out. (Has anybody ever actually had this happen in a VW more
than ten years old?).

Well, I already know it won't be quite that simple. I'm bringing with
me a used steering rack, new fuel pump, and a sh*tload of tools (well,
a small load, compared to Hoover's). But the good news is, the new clutch
is in, the engine runs (beautifully, says the PO, but we'll see), and
the car drives. Bad news is, the fuel pump (or hoses, not sure) leak,
dripdripdrip, the front rack is definitely needed, and front tires
are pretty far gone. Also, the Vgon has been sitting for most of a year
with same fluids inside, and only an occasional engine run (clutch was
shot).

So, upon arrival, I will change out the front rack (getting the coupler
off the old pinion shaft could be tough, anyone ever done this?), then
head to the local rubber dealer for new front Reeboks and some of Castrol's
finest brew. Probably do the fuel pump too, if it isn't just a loose
clamp. Then, sometime Friday afternoon I hope, I'm off!

FUN STUFF:
This trip can follow the old Rte. 66 of folklore fame, and I intend to
take advantage of the opportunity. Have even gone so far as to obtain
the book, &quot;Route 66: The Mother Road&quot; by Wallis. A cool book-- it
describes the route in detail, and laments the passing of many old
attractions no longer there. It also mentions a few that still are
there, despite the Route being mostly bypassed by the modern interstates.

My question is: Can any of you who have recently travelled any part of
the Route, or who live near it, suggest any noteworthy places/things/
people to stop and see? The book is great, but it's 6 years old. And
though Wallis did a fine job, he doesn't actually live on each stretch
of the road, obviously.

Any last-minute advice on Rte 66 roadside attractions, and/or sage words
on Vanagon quirks that can bite the unwary?
