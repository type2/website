Subject: Proper Starting Procedure (was RE: Cold Starting Question)
Date: Wed, 24 Jan 96 10:46:00 PST


Greetings all,

This thread seems to be developing into a discussion of the proper starting 
procedure for VWs.  I of course, am no expert and in the course of looking 
for some information on this collected these responses.

As for my concern around this, I have an 83 Westfalia (Fuel Injected) and 
find that pumping the gas pedal once before starting allows for an easier 
start.  When I don't do it my idle is very weak and the bus stalls during 
warm up.

Now, in my limited Muir knowledge it seems as though he mentions the good of 
pumping the accelerator before starting (in his choke-less busses) but also 
admonishes doing it in later passages.  All I know is that it works for me, 
and thanks to others input I have a clue as to why:

&gt;Bill,
&gt;
&gt;If you can find an original owner's manual for your vehicle you will see 
that
&gt;the proper starting procedure is to fully depress the accelerator pedal 
then
&gt;release it.  This not only gives the engine a priming of gas from the
&gt;accelerator pump, it positions the cam on the automatic choke into the
&gt;'Start' position.
&gt;
&gt;This has been the standard starting procedure for Volkswagens since
&gt;introduction of their automatic choke.  Works like a charm :-)

Now is this for Carbs or FI?

&gt;Do you have a carb or fuel injection?  If it is fuel injection, contrary to
&gt;popular opinion, pushing the gas pedal half way to the floor manual sets 
the
&gt;cold start throttle valve in the open position.  There is not actually any
&gt;fuel being pumped since the fuel pump is electric and the ignition would 
have
&gt;to be turned on.  (If you listen carefully, you can hear the pump 
activating
&gt;when you turn on the ignition).  So to answer your question, yes it does
&gt;help, and no, you are not flooding your engine.

&gt;If you have a carberator, none of the above applies.  I'm no expert when it
&gt;comes to carbs systems.

What is the concensious on this?

Thanks for all the help,
