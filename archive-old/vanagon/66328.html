Subject:      Re: Syncro springs and shocks (long)

Harry,

BusBoys had syncro front shocks (OEM, made by Boge) last year for $45US
each. I imagine they or some of the other list vendors can find a similar
deal. Also, the KYB Gas-Adjusts are a rear good shock for the Westfalia--you
should be able to find these for $30US each or so. When I replaced the
shocks (both front and rear) on my 87 syncro Westy last year, it made quite
a noticeable improvement in the handling--much less sway when turning.

I'm not sure what to tell you about your rear springs sagging. If they have
indeed sagged, then I'd look for some used ones in a junkyard before forking
out the big bucks. You might want to visit the dealer where you purchased
the van and see what they say about the springs. Are your tires wearing
abnormally? Is the van handling OK?

&gt;Hi Everyone.  Well, during the summer I mentioned to the list that
&gt;the rear springs of our '90 Syncro Westy have apparently sagged.  The
&gt;rear wheels are 3/4 of a degree out of camber (tops of wheels leaning
&gt;in), and the alignment adjuster is at its max.  Many of you suggested
&gt;not to worry about it, as it's so slight, etc. Well, I've also
&gt;noticed the van is sitting noticably lower to the ground as well.
&gt;The front shocks seem a bit &quot;soft&quot; as well.
&gt;
&gt;So, I've done some research on this topic and I'd like to share this
&gt;with the list.
&gt;
&gt;First of all, NOBODY makes replacement springs for this van other
&gt;than VW.  I've been in contact with 3 spring shops, and they can't
&gt;get a replacement.  I've also dealt with a major flaps (Lordco), and
&gt;they can't help either.  Same for the front shocks.  Again, VW is the
&gt;sole supplier of these parts.
&gt;
&gt;Once coil springs sag, they are rendered useless.  If they have a
&gt;model, they can custom build springs for about $150 CDN each.  BUT,
&gt;there are no guarantees, etc.  They will measuring wire diameter to
&gt;figure out the spring rate, and they will only have a collapsed
&gt;length, and will have to guess as to it's full height, etc.  Since
&gt;the only model I know of is on my van, this isn't good.  The turn
&gt;around is about 4 to 6 weeks to get these made locally.
&gt;
&gt;So, here's the poop... Now, sit down, take a deep breath.... these
&gt;are NOT typo's
&gt;
&gt;front spring   251 411 105F 952  $456 CDN EACH
&gt;rear spring    251 511 105E 952 $506 CDN EACH
&gt;
&gt;front shocks  251 413 031C          $354 CDN EACH
&gt;rear shocks   251 513 031D          $242 CDN EACH
&gt;
&gt;TOTAL :  $3116.00 CDN
&gt;
&gt;Now, this is serious money.   Also, my dealer has checked his
&gt;computer tracking system, and in the past 18 months since they've had
&gt;this computer system have NEVER sold springs or shocks for a Syncro.
&gt;Of course it's my luck that it's my van that has this problem.  Gee,
&gt;I don't even go off road!
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to know why the springs have sagged.  Any ideas?  The spring
&gt;shops couldn't tell me the exact reason.  My van sits 5 months of the
&gt;year (unladen), and I wonder if this static load could have caused
&gt;this.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, there are other ways to get VW parts (ie. Kyle, etc), but
&gt;it's pretty scarey with these prices.
&gt;
&gt;Am I the only one, or have other Syncro owners had spring/shock
&gt;problems?  Are there any gas shock replacments for this van?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any input.
&gt;Harry.
