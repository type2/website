Subject: Re: Should 1982 bus steer straight?


&gt;
&gt;Is it normal for the steering to drift slightly to the left when coasting
&gt;or driving on a flat road? Someone said all busses pull to the left - can
&gt;this be true? If not what would be the most likely cause? In case it is
&gt;relevant the suspension at the front of the bus is a bit lower than the
&gt;rear - is this normal?


It is definately not normal for all buses to pull to the left.  That is 
ridiculous.  There could be a number of causes, though, such as uneven tire 
wear (or different sized tires), the need for an alignment, a dragging 
brake caliper, worn front end part, etc. etc.  The most lilely causes 
should be relatively inexpensive to fix, I believe.
