Subject: Re: Overheating

As I understand it, rodding the radiator involves unsoldering the upper 
and lower tanks, then running special rods down each tube. It is supposed 
to be the right treatment when the radiator is clogged but not badly 
corroded itself. I was prepared to buy a new radiator, but the radiator 
shop (who I've done business with for year) suggested the rodding 
instead. It has woked great.  Even at 110 degrees ambiant temperature, the 
needle stays over the little red light. (I also changed the fan switch 
and ALL radiator hoses...now that was expensive!)
