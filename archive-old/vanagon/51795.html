Subject: Re: 87 HELP!!!

&gt;1)  Trying to replace coolant temp. sensor for FI.  Part given to me is
&gt;#025 906 041A.  Part I think (or thought) in van is #251 919 372.  Part
&gt;(again I thought) is at top of coolant expansion tank in rear corner of
&gt;engine compartment.  New part doesn't look like old part and old wire
&gt;connector won't fit into new part either.  Am I trying to stick this
&gt;thing in the wrong place?  Or do I need a different sensor?  HELP!!!
This temp sensor goes in the thermostat housing in the left front area of
the engine.
