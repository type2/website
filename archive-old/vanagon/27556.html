&gt; go.  The 091/1 4spd. trans was in both air and H2O vanagons, diesels got
&gt; five speeds (sometimes)  Syncros have 094-4WD.
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know if it is possible to put one of these five-speeds, in
&gt; an '81 Vanagon, to mate with the original '81 Vanagon gas engine?

Well, not that I know the answer, but isn't it pretty academic
anyway, since personally I've never seen one in my life, and
certainly never one in a junkyard.  Plus the gear didn't net
you anything higher, so unless you wanted one for off-roading
you would need to change the final ratio for any big benefit.
Hardly seems worth the effort, plus beyond pictures in Bentley
I doubt I'll ever run across one.  I will conjecture to the conversion
being vaguely possible though as likely the bellhousings were
interchangeable, as I believe my mechanic once mentioned the
diesel 4 spd simply had a different bellhousing and clutch assembly,
and certainly the 4 and 5 both had to mate to the diesel, but
then again, it could have been totally different, the 5 could have
only worked with the diesel.  On a side thought though was this
5 ever used in something else, like maybe an early Quantum or Dasher
or Audi with the longitudinal engine?
