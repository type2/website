&gt;We are having the same problem with our '81 Westy.  I have a couple of
&gt;questions about this:
&gt;How can you distinguish if it is the sender or the connections?

about the only way i know of is to lower the tank and clean the connections
and then put it all back up. and if it doesn't fix it, then replace the
sender. the problem with this approach is that since you already had to drop
the tank, why not just go ahead and replace the sender while you are there?

&gt;Is it really easier to cut a hole in the &quot;floor&quot; than to drop the tank down?

nononono ... that was for a bread-loaf bus only!! their fuel tanks are behind
the rear seat, and to get their tank out, you have to remove the engine ...
for them, it is easier to cut a hole in the hump (in the back) that to
take out the engine and the fuel tank.

&gt;Has anyone dropped the tank in an early '80s vanagon?

bentley book has the steps ... the big deal is to get as much gasoline out
as possible BEFORE you start, then it's loosening a whole bunch of stuff
and then it drops down. much easier to say than do. ;)

&gt;Where does one buy the appropriate replacement fuel sender?

vw. nobody else is gonna have them. :(

&gt;Does anyone have any idea how much a mechanic would charge to do this for
&gt;me?  (i.e., is it cheap enough to be worth having the pros do it?)

i would hazard a guess of at least 2 hours labor (around here that's about
$80 for just the labor). the trick is to find one that can put it back
up in there correctly!! with all the screws tight and hoses clamped, etc.
get a place that has worked on vanagons before.  me personally, after getting
gasoline dumped on me many times over my long illustrious life, i'm at the
age that i'd just about rather pay someone else to get dirty. but that's me.
