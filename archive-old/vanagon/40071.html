Subject: RE: V6anagon soon to be re-V6'ed

Herr Maher wonders whether his engine mount may contribute to the short
and vibration-filled lives of his clutches.  I suspect not, as I have
installed my engine at two very different heights, neither with any 
apparent vibration problem.  The engine and trans bolt together, and
can be angled differently by about 3 in. height as measured at the
muffler without a problem.  Steve's setup includes an adapter plate, and
I could certainly picture that a mismachined adapter plate would put the
engine off line.  Steve, is there a way compare the position of the 
engine's crank pulley center to the centerline of the tranny?
