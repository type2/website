Subject: Vanagon tires in Vancouver

While searching for tires in Vancouver I came across the following 
excellent deals.

Continental Transport - New - $60 each installed.  Graysons Tire at 
Main and 2nd.

Woosung (???) - New - $79 installed.  Econo-Tire in North Vancouver.

I purchased the Woosung for the front two tires on my Westfalia and 
it feels like I've got power steering now!  Also I don't slide across 
three lanes anymore when it rains here, which is quite frequently.  
The Woosungs seem to have a half decent tread which might even be an 
all season capable tire.

Has anyone got a recommendation on a snow tire for my bus for when 
skiing starts?  I would like to find something somewhat reasonably
priced and somewhat durable also ( cake and eat it too.)

You'll all also be happy to know that I brought back a personalized 
'ELVIS' license plate from Nevada.  Another cheesy souvenir for the 
Vanagon.  Now if only I could find those mud flaps which have the 
chrome lady on them - you know the ones the truckers have? (insert 
sarcasm here)
