&gt; I just called VWoA 1-800-822-8987 #3 to ask what they will assist me in repairing
&gt; my westy's leaking head gasket problem. Got really pissed!!!

David,
   I'm real new to the list so forgive me if this is a FAQ &amp; I should have
known better...  My '81 Westy leaks oil like a sieve, I paid to have
push rod tube seals redone and it still leaks.  From the tone of your 
note, this is not uncommon?  Thanks for any insights -
   Rick Harper
