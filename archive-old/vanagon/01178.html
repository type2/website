Subject:  Vanagon Intermittent Misfire

CONDITION
After driving for 1/2 to 2 hours at a constant speed, vehicle
experiences lack of power, cuts-out or stalls, often accompanied by
bucking or jerking of the vehicle.
In ALL cases, the vehicle will restart immediately.  This symptom may
not re-occur for several weeks/months.  Inspection by the dealer results
in nothing conclusive.

Some air-flow meters may experience a vibration resonance of the
metering potentiometer wiper during extended constant driving.  This
resonance causes the air-flow meter to supply an intermittent signal
to the Digifant ECU.  The ECU will then default to a &quot;no-load&quot; condition
and reduce the injection time.

SERVICE
Harness, Part No. 025 906 302, is available to resolve this condition.
* remove electrical connector from air flow sensor (see Figure 24-174)
* install converter assembly, Part No. 025 906 302, between harness and
  air flow sensor

NOTE
If customer complaints persist after performing the above repair,
contact your Zone Product Support Specialist (TSM in Canada).

harness costs about $100! very simple to install. takes about three
minutes maximum. the new harness fits between the old harness and the
silver air-flow meter box attached to the air cleaner box. remove the
silver clip, wiggle out the big wiring connector (from the side of the
air-flow meter), connect the proper end of the new harness to the big
big wiring connector you just wiggled out, put the new clip into the
new connection; then take the other end of the new harness and plug it
into the air-flow meter connection. put the silver clip back. and you
are done.

it stopped the problem of stuttering and stumbling on my 91 automatic. now
if Cetin's cousin got the problem fixed for $15.00, i'm gonna be kinda irate!!
:)  can you find out exactly what kind of shielded extension he had put in
and where in the engine compartment they put it? i'm really really curious
about where they would have put that shielded extension.
i've heard of problems like this, but they were ignition problems having to
do with spark plug wires ... mostly on porsche 911's. they have to have a
grounded shield around the spark plug wires (so that the plugs don't 'cross-
fire' each other).

p.s.
any vanagon owners who want to get a copy of the vw tech bulletins i've got
laying around, let me know and i'll send it to you (rather than clog up the
list again). :)
