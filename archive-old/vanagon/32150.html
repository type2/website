Subject: Re: What size Threads?

&gt;What size are the threads on the bolts that hold the engine to the
&gt;tranny.  I lost my old ones and
&gt;&quot;borrowed&quot;
&gt;some from somebody elses engine
&gt;
&gt;and must replace
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Dave

Dave, you didn't say want type engine you have, but most VW engine bolts,
Aircooled and Vanagon Water, are 10mm by 1.50 pitch  length is about
4inches but they are threaded on both ends.  Finding this type of bolt my
be hard unless you go to the dealer or find an junk engine from a salvage
yard.  Hope this helps.
