&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; WOW!
&gt; &gt; I just printed this list.
&gt; &gt; Sounds like you`ve been there.
&gt; &gt; Invaluable information.  Some of the stuff we have some I went out and 
&gt; &gt; bought last night. More stuff to buy next week.  Good sale at Sears.
&gt; 
&gt; Sean, you're new to this list so you probably haven't yet gotten a flavor for
&gt; our various list personalities.  Steve stands out even in this anal crowd as
&gt; being Mr. Preparedness (he surely made Eagle Scout... ?) so his list is
&gt; perhaps longer than many of ours.  Not to argue that he hasn't been there
&gt; since anybody who's owned a `74 bus has to have been there at least several
&gt; times! :) :)
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a shortened list of essentials to provide counterpoint to the Long
&gt; List:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) 1 quart of oil for topping.  If it's leaking so bad you need more you're
&gt; doomed anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Toolbox with tools.  Can't do anything without them.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Make sure to throw a long pair of pants and a raincoat into the bus incase
&gt; you need to hitchhike somewhere (maybe some shoes other than Birkies if you
&gt; think of it).
&gt; 
&gt; 4) A towel.  Read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy if you haven't already.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Swiss Army knife, mostly for the corkscrew.
&gt; 
&gt; 6) Flashlight for topping oil in the dark.
&gt; 
&gt; 7) OK, probably ought to make sure you have air in your spare and a working
&gt; jack although all this does is keep you from having a flat in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; 8) Relax.  If anything goes wrong you'll work it out somehow.
&gt; 
&gt; :) :)  :)


John,

Now that really covers both ends of the spectrum.  I guess, that between 
all of you, and by the time we leave, we will have our bus at the ready for 
anything.

Oh, by the way, it's not Sean it's Sean's girlfriend Lee Ann.

Thanks for the tips. Especially the one about how it will all work out 
That's great advise.

Lee Ann
