Subject: Oil cooler placement

The different opinions on this subject are amazing! When my box of goodies
shows up from JCW, I'm going to go with Joel's scheme of mounting it above
the tin and in the air flow of the left intake for three reasons:

1)Joel's circumstances match mine exactly as far as vehicle (81) and location
(Atlanta).
2)It's the simplest solution offered.
3)Most importantly, it worked for him!

My problem is at idle and at highway speed. Joel's arrangement bothered me
from the standpoint of dumping heat into the engine compartment but the light
went on the other day when someone mentioned the tremendous rate of air turn
over at highway speed. I'm not going to worry about dumping heat at speed and
we'll just see what happens at idle. Frankly, I think I'll just turn the idle
up 'cause I dont think I'm going to whip 90* heat while standing at 800 rpm. 

My objective/hope is to pull the current operating range of 210* to 250* down
about 20* to 190* to 230*. Maybe we'll find out this weekend.
