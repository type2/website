Subject: RE:Dealer Service

&gt; I think one of the keys to dealing with ANY department at a dealership...
&gt; sales...parts...service is letting the &quot;manager&quot; know that:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. you know your stuff....
&gt; 2. you don't take any $hit...
&gt; 3. you EXPECT the job to be done right...
&gt; 4. and if you aren't treated properly you will BITCH and BITCH and BITCH!!
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately if you don't communicate the above, you will be treated like
&gt; a sheep...the sad part about the above is that you could probably
&gt; replace &quot;dealership&quot; with restuarnt....doctor....lawyer....laundrymat...
&gt; retail sales establishment, etc...etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Howmany people send food back when it isn't cooked to their expectation...
&gt; or tell a doctor off after sitting in the waiting room and finally seeing
&gt; the dweeb 1.5 hours AFTER your scheduled time?
&gt; 
&gt; Call me a pain in the ass....(ok...not so loud huh!) but I figure
&gt; if I'm paying good money for something I expect that I get what I bargain
&gt; for....
&gt; 
&gt; now back to the dealer....I have my local dealer trained....the sales
&gt; people know that before I've walked in the door to buy a car I have
&gt; the price, financing info down not only for his dealership, but for
&gt; the competition as well...
&gt; 
&gt; I have bought enough parts that I was able not only to get the garage
&gt; discount, but a line of credit as well...Hey, I don't get this stuff...
&gt; I'll drive 10 minutes extra in the other direction and hit the other
&gt; local VW dealership....
&gt; 
&gt; The service people know that I won't be too pleased if the work isn't done
&gt; right the first time....
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, I do admit when someone goes out of their way,
&gt; I will make sure that &quot;extra&quot; is rewarded...the parts guy gets
&gt; a case of beer for  Christmas...the service guys get a couple of
&gt; bucks if they have done that little &quot;extra&quot;...
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line...we have a nice arangement at my local dealership...
&gt; sort of mutual respect...or mutual deterance...I don't know which.
&gt; 
&gt; But in the past 10 years I've bought 4 new cars from them...and a couple
&gt; of used ones as well.
&gt;

1. I know my stuff, but I don't know much about mechanic work and that's Why I expect them to
   be there. I pay the big money for the repair... I expect it done right! I do know what's 
   done right!

2. I take no shit. I have been reasonable, polite, etc, etc and although they have gotten
   extremely rude and apathetical with me, I kept my cool.

3. Yes!!! I DO.

4. Can't you tell I am bitching like a bitch! I have bitched to everyone starting at service, via
   manager, ending in the owner...who buy the way wouldn't take my call. Of course, I was a polite
   bitcher. I've talked and bitched about it with VWoA, BBB, Autoline, News... Believe me, I have
   bitch, I bitch, and I will bitch. (THIS IS MY BITCHING OPINION)


Sounds like you have a great relationship with your dealer! I wish I had a similar one, unfortunately,
I don't think many people do.
