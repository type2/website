&gt; Serious? attaches to the rear brace?  Doesn't the rear brace move around on

Not the rear carrier, -- the rear brace to the engine compartment.
I don't know how it is on the 69, but on the 71 it is removable,
making it rather much easier to pull the engine...no lifting 
required, just twist the engine 90 degrees and pull out.
