Subject: Song Parody Archive - problem update

All,

The two problems with the Song Parody archive are being tougher than I
thought. The files have been re-encoded without any success in eliminating
the background noise. I apologize for this - maybe it'll even convince you
to go out and buy the CD. :) I will continue working on a fix for the
problem... for the moment, I admit to being mystified. Grrr. However, they
do play the *full* file length, except for admin.mp3; haven't gotten to
that one yet. I will soon.

For reference, the problems are:

1. File won't download properly when clicked on. This can be worked around
by right-clicking on the link, choosing &quot;Save Link As...&quot; and then saving
the file. When it's done, it should be playable on any .mp3 player.
Hopefully, when Problem #2 is fixed, the files will download correctly.

2. File has noise in background and/or does not play completely. This is
either an encoding problem or a file transfer problem. I am re-encoding
affected files and uploading them tonight. Workaround: I'm looking into the
problem and hope to have it fixed sometime in the near future.

- J
