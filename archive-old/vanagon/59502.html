Subject: 91 Transmission Woes

The Carat was at the transmission shop today. The news was not good, since the problem could not 
be diagnosed without a teardown and his estimate was $1300 minimum. He thinks the most likely 
cause is a clutch pack letting go. Going to pick it up tonight. Got the garage cleaned out and the 
tags are already on the Bus. I've been driving it for a week and do miss my AC, Cell Phone and 
stereo system. I got my choice between a used unit with 100,000 on it or a rebuild by a highly 
recommended VW transmission specialist for $700.00 if I pull it and bring it to him.
Either way, I will be pulling the old unit out this weekend. 

Any morale building encouragement would be greatly appreciated.
