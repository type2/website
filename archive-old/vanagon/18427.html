 FINALLY, I got everything hooked up and ready to go. It took about two 
 minutes of cranking with the plugs out to get the oil pressure light to
 go out &lt;dipstick went form max to min&gt;. Put the plugs in, hook up the
 new electronic ignition, set the timing and ...... sputter sputter. After
 finding the loose clamp on the gulp valve &lt;air injection stuff&gt; it 
 started right up. Running smooth, oil and alternator lights off - it even
 idles! Wheew, what a relief.

 One casualty to all the wrenching is my 21 year old muffler. the right flange
 cracked along the bottom  when I was tightening it up. The crack quickly 
 spread up into the muffler as the engine heated up. What is 
 best to do as regards replacement? Get another stock one &lt;about $150 from
 RMMW&gt; or get an extractor &lt;about $70&gt;. $150 sounds like a lot, but if they
 last 20 years, maybe it's not so bad. I used extractors on my '64 and I'd say
 that 5-7 years is all they last. On the other hand, how many more years is
 the faithful '74 going to be around?

 If I do go to an extractor, is it necessary to re-jet? Any other caveats?


 It's great to be rolling again &lt;albeit noisily&gt;!



 Thanks,


 Dave
