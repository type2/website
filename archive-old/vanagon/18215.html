Subject: Re: luggage rack / sunroof??

Note that sunroofs don't provide a welcome &quot;breeze from above&quot; -- they ex-
haust a breeze that you let in from somewhere else: vent windows, fresh
air system, even heater in a season when you don't lose too much through
the hole.  VW's seal so well that the difference is very obvious between
air flow with roof open and air flow with roof shut.  Only counterexample
in my experience is gigandous fabric sunroof on 60s buses, which is big
enough to have an inward draft at the rear along with the outward draft
at the front.
