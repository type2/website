Dyer asked:

&gt;One more question about my '66 fan shroud.  I'm mounting a dog-house
&gt;cooling system on the engine I'm building and the dog-house shroud has
&gt;a small (mebbe 1/2 inch) pipe sticking out the *top* of the shroud off
&gt;to one side a bit...  What is this pipe used for?  

It's for a tube that connects to the charcoal canister, part of the smog 
stuff for the '71 and later. There are varying arguments about whether or 
not you should use the smog stuff. The best logic I've heard so far is 
that if you have the '71 engine with the 34PICT3 carburator, you should 
in fact have the charcoal canister (you'll probably want a new one) 
hooked up. There about $100 if memory serves correctly. I'm told they're 
a throwaway item after 30-40,000 miles.
