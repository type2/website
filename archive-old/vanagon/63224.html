&lt;&lt; For repair I would like to remove the engine ( just the engine,
 not the transmission !) from under the vehicle and bring it
 to my garage. This shouldn't be too difficult according to the
 manual. I wonder if it is possible carrying the whole thing
 with two people into a car and mounting and remounting it using
 a simple hydraulic jack. What is the weight of such an  engine  ??


                         Any tips:     Ger de Graaf. &gt;&gt;


they're not that heavy. 2 people can lift any type 4 engine easily.
done it plenty of times, remember, lift with your &quot;legs&quot; not your back..
