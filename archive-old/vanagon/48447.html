Subject: rear view mirror swap?

Hello all.  I'm thinking about replacing the side-view mirrors on my '87
Westy and since I don't yet have a factory repair manual, I need to ask 
a question. Do the electric side mirrors utilize the same mounting 
holes on the door as the non-electric type (which is what I have)?  My 
wife and I differ in height by nine inches and it is a pain in the butt
to have to adjust the mirrors every time we switch driving, especially
when the driver is alone.  The van needs new mirrors anyway and I was
just thinking.....well, perhaps too much. If anyone has done this swap,
please let me know.

Thanks
