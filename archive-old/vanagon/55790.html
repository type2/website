Subject: Early breadloaf Westy hi-top sighting

Saw a nice early breadload today, with a sort-of hightop, with a pop 
up centre section. It was red, with white top, big Westfalia decal 
on the rear of the top. Higher than a standard Westy poptop, but not 
as high as a solid hightop like the Getaway Vans.

Anyone know if Westfalia actually did this kind conversion in 68-71? 
First one I've seen, I think.
