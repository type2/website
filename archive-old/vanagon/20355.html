Subject:      plastic model vanagons, etc.

well, it's ALL Martha's fault!!!! SHE made me do it! :)

i stopped by the magazine store to get a copy of a mag on electric cars
(but more from that mag later), and also picked up a copy of Scale Auto
Enthusiast (cause i build plastic models) ... and on page 3 was an ad
for Mountain State Hobby Supply in Teays, WV. big deal, you say. yes, well,
what caught my eye was:

Revell Germany Cars
H7330 VW Bus ELW ........... 22.50
H7380 VW Bus UN ............ 24.50

so naturally, i had to call and foolishly order one of each. he said the
ELW is a fire truck!! and the description he gave is that it is a double-cab
pickup with a &quot;cage&quot; on the back for the fire equipment. that fits with some
pictures i've seen in books. :) :) :)  so when i get them next week, i'll
let you know what they look like.

ok. so what about the non-vanagons on the list? well, he said he also has
the 1/25th scale Corrado and Jetta and Beetles (hard top and cabrio), as
well as a whopping big 1/16 scale beetle.

not enough, eh? how bout (ready for this, Alistair???) ...
H7503 Unimog with snowplow and spreader body .... 41.00
H7505 Unimog RW-1 ............................... 54.00

i asked about an old Revell of Germany kit of the breadloaf passenger wagen
... he didn't have any, but said he orders direct from germany so he's going
to check on that and some older bus kits. :)
