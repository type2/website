Thanks for the fire-watch info. . .I wasn't aware this was a prob with Buses
though I've seen a few burnt-out Bugs. This was discussed on
rec.automakers.vw.aircooled a few months ago, and it seems almost ANYTHING
can be the culprit, the most likely source however being loose fuel lines
(esp. on Type I's, where the fuel filter &amp; line is right above the engine.)
In Bugs you also have to watch for people sitting on the back seat over the
battery -- evidently the springs in the cushion can touch the battery
terminals resulting in sparks and a real &quot;hot seat.&quot; (Obviously not a
problem in buses.)

I will say that watching those guys fearlessly working on that humungous
B-29 makes me feel a lot better about fiddling with my Bus !

&gt;Didn't they have a Fire Extinguisher? Yes, mounted on the
&gt;bulkhead back next to the APU. I'm not making this up- I saw the 
&gt;Confederate Air Force's &quot;Fifi&quot; this summer and the big extinguisher
&gt;is back right next to the APU. In the film someone mentions that they
&gt;had their extinguisher there too.
Uh, Confederate Air Force?  Did I miss something in history class?  I mean,
I knew they had a submarine, but . . .
