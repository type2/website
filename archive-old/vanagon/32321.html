&gt;  
&gt; Hi people,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Does any person out there in computerland know how much the 
&gt; locking strip that goes around all the window rubbers cost?

I got a new windshield from a junk yard and put it in without the 
chrome strip. The glass guy put plenty of sealer around it and said 
the strip was just there for appearence. I haven't had any leaks and 
don't notice the strip gone.
