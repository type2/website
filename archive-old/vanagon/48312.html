 After a rash of mis-diagnoses I am happy to report that i have
 found the problem with my 86' GL.  I should say that i am very
 unhappy.  The problem seems to be the valve lifters.  The shop
 that i took it to wants to do the work including putting in new
 rings and putting in new head gaskets.  He wants $2000 for the
 work.   &gt;&gt;


Valve lifters??  What is the problem?  If the lifters are noisy, there is
probably only one or two that are bad.  The lifters can be repalced without
tearing down the engine.  A competant mechanic should be able to locate the
culprits and they can be changed by removing the pushrod tubes.  Collapsable
tubes are available to allow this repair without removing the heads.  Lifters
should only cost about $20.00 ea. They are the same as used in the aircooled
engines. 
Hope this helps,
Dennis H.
