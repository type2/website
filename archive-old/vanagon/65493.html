Subject:      Windshield FOUND

Hey all,
OK, found a windshield for my '81 locally, used with a couple of very
small rock chips.  Came from a local junkyard/used parts house.

It came out of an early water-cooled Vanagon, and it is original VW
glass, as evidenced by the symbol on the lower left corner of the glass.
My current cracked windshield is PPG.

It had a really crappy tint strip at the top, which was halfway off, so
I scraped it off the rest of the way, it came off surprisingly easy, and
even more surprising, the leftover adhesive wiped away with Windex.

The VA inspection sticker left some tough residue, tho, but a couple
squirts of WD-40 and that stuff practically dissolved!  I'm never buying
Goo-Gone again, WD-40 works a ton better :-)

And the price was OK, about $100 cheaper than new, so I'm happy.

I will be installing it tomorrow, looks like a nice day for it.

Thanks to everyone for their help.

Sean
