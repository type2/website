Subject:      fuel line size

I am getting ready to replace most of my fuel line.  I spent yesterday
trying to figure out the right size to buy and find a place to buy it.

Questions for those who are in the know:

1 - the archives say to buy 8mm(5/16&quot;) hose.
I know my fuel filter takes 7mm hose.
How much of each?

2 - I also need to replace one of the Y fittings on top of my tank.
I am thinking about replacing all the hose up there too while i'm at it.
Is this a good idea?
Do I need clamps for this hose?
What size hose do I use for this?

3 - am I in for hell while doing this??

Thanks as usual
