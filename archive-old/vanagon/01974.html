The Name of our van is &quot;slug&quot;, for obvious reasons. As for a group trip, you 
would be very very surprised how many campers there are up here in 
Canada, how beautiful it is AND how far your US dollars will go....DC

&gt; What about our vehicles pet names?  Shouldn't Joel be keeping a list of

&gt; have a van named &quot;joel&quot;, and if so, is it true that it's built for
&gt; comfort, not for speed?
&gt; 
&gt; As yet, I haven't named my '84 Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have one named &quot;Hitler&quot;?  I think it would be great to have a 
&gt; Volkswagen named Hitler.
