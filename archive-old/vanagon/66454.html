Subject:      clutch pedal problems on my '86

The hydraulics are okay and the clutch itself is working fine, but the
mechanicals of the clutch pedal are causing it (the pedal ) to bind.

With the frame member in the way, I can't even see what the problem might be.
Anyone ever had this assembly apart?  How to remove?

thanks - Frank
