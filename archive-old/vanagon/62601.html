Subject: Re: Replacing the seal on luggage rack
Date: Thu, 10 Jul 1997 10:20:12 -0400


&gt; I have just installed the new rubber seal on the top and luggage rack of
my
&gt; camper.  Does anyone know a trick to keep from pushing the four rear
bolts
&gt; on the luggage rack back into the top when trying to align the luggage
rack
&gt; while bolting it back on?  I just don't want to take out the headliner if
&gt; there is any other way to do it.  HELP!

I hate to have to tell you now that it's already too late, but it is
possible to replace the seal without removing the luggage rack.  Hopefully
this info will help others, though...
