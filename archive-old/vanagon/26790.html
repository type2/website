Subject: Re: Leaking gas tank overflow vents on a '90 GL?  Read on...

Saw your note----

&gt;after filling up (90 Vanagon) the other day I noticed a little gas
&gt;dripping from the frame surrounding the gas tank.  When it seemed to
&gt;stop I drove from the gas station back to work (all of two minutes and
&gt;0.5 mile), and the drip didn't recur.  Nice odour of gasoline, though.
&gt;Same when I drove home that evening, no drip but smell of gas.  Tried to
&gt;check out the tank and hose connections last night but couldn't see
&gt;anything amiss; of course, you can't see much of anything down there,
&gt;even with a small mirror and flashlight.  Did a little test drive today;
&gt;again no drip but still gasoline odours.

Don't know about a 90, but my 86 has two plastic &quot;expansion tanks&quot; which are
connected to the main fuel tank by small vent hoses.  Several years ago one
of the tanks on mine developed a small crack which left gasoline odors
everytime I filled it, but I never could see spilled gasoline.  The tanks
are under the drivers and passenger doors on mine.  I would look at them
closely before doing anything with the main tank.

Imagine you could repair those tanks with GOOP or some similar adhesive.
But I got my replacement free from VW under the extended emissions control
warranty.
