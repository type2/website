&gt; Well, as I got inside my dash to fix my headlight problem, I realized
&gt; that not only is the Fresh Air Cable broken, but now the heater cable is
&gt; broke.  I can pull it with a tool, and since it is spring I may just
&gt; leave the heat off.  Though it is really a hassle to get in there to turn
&gt; the heat on/off.
&gt; 
&gt; What is it like to replace the control cables for the heat levers?  Where
&gt; could I get the cables?
&gt; 
&gt; If I can't replace them, then I may attempt to just rig them up with a
&gt; wire attachment.  Though I would like to replace them, now that it is
&gt; warm and I could have some time in the nice weather.  If I ignore it,
&gt; I'll hate myself next fall.

&gt; Hi: My 86 has just developed the same problem. I havn't had a chance to take it apart and check it out yet. If anyone has any thoughts on this subject please share them with me also.
