&gt;This is hog wash!  There's no analogy here.  Who is to say what &quot;Genuine&quot; oil

you wash your hogs in synthetic oil?? wow. now THAT's a hog-lover. bet it
keeps the mosquites and ticks off them hogs real good! :)

and &quot;Genuine&quot; oil is only when it says &quot;genuine&quot; on the can. course, nowadays
everthin comes in them little plastic bottles, and it's hard to read them
little bitty letters.

&gt;But with motor oil there's no sentiment value and thus no analogy.

well, i don't know ... down round here, if you give a girl a quart of oil,
especially if you wrap it up real purty, it's kinda like you've jumped over
the broom together. if she takes it, that is. lots of girls won't take a
quart of oil from a fellow ... especially if she figures he's about a quart
low already. :)  and the girls what do take the oil, well, they want only the
best ... none of this Uncle Bubba's Recycled Dino Surprise stuff. the best
impression can be made with a case of straight 30W High Detergent Valvoline.
:)  &lt;cause they've seen that name on the sides of racing cars&gt;

besides ... you can't keep a car running with a diamond or one of them cubic
whatevers.

remember, folks ... A Diamond may be a Joy Forever,
                    but a Quart of Oil will get you nearly 3,000 miles!!
