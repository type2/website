Subject: Re: roller on bus door

Jack, you sure it's not a worn door seal that's causing you problems? I 
removed my seal for bodywork/painting and I've noticed a marked difference 
in the quantity/quality of noise in the van. 

You might get some cheap weatherstripping and apply it strategically (on 
the corners to see if that stops the rattle. Just a thought.

&gt; hard when I hit a bump or whatever.  Is there supposed to be some kind of
&gt; bushing between the metal roller and the rail?  I'd say that there is about
&gt; 1/8th of an inch on either side now.  I'm fairly sure that it would be safe
&gt; to say that it's well worn..
