I believe that the Los Banos vanagon is the same model that I have (minus 
some of the options), a base camper.

&gt; &gt;Westfalia Weekender??  If this has a poptop, rear bed/bench and two rear 
&gt; &gt;facing single seats it's a Multivan. Excellent choice, all the Westy stuff 
&gt; &gt;you need without the price!! Add a full kitchen later if you happen upon a 
&gt; &gt;deal. $7900 seems a bit high those repairs total $500 +/-.
&gt; 
&gt; VW didn't introduce the Multivan model in the USA until 1990.   Did they have
&gt; them in Canada before that?
