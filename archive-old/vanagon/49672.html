&lt;&lt; fires all 4 at once don't it? &gt;&gt;
Tim, my Bosch manuals are in storage, but I had always thought that they
fired in  pairs because the amp in the ECU could only handle firing like
this(I could be wrong...MBZ,BMW and Jag all operate this way), but youre
probably right...maybe a bad wire to inj. Needs to trace back to the
multipin_at_ECU
