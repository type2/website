Subject: Wasserboxer Overheating

When I bought my 1991 Carat with 125,000 miles on it, the VW dealer
who did a prepurchase inspection said it  &quot;already had the head job&quot;.

A couple of months later, the red coolant light would go on, and shortly
thereafter the temperature guage would climb.

I've replaced the coolant and bled the system per the Bentley, twice.
There does not seem to be any coolant loss, still, we've looked all over
for leaks,
including the heads. My mechanic insists it can't be air in the system,
but
has no other suggestions. Can anyone give me some help?

I have limited e-mail and cannot get to the web to search the archives.
Please send cc: any replies to me at the address above.

Thanks, 

Scott Davis
