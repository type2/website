Subject: Re: manual

&lt;&lt;anyone have access to either the original owner's manual for an '83
air-cooled Vanagon or a good substitute?  The van I just purchased didn't
have it in the glove box, and I'm finding I need this little book more 
and more as this is my first VW Thanks vargsman_at_aol_dot_com&gt;&gt;

I have the Haines manual for the '83 air-cooled Vanagon -- mine is water 
cooled, so it's not as helpful as it can be.

If you want it, e-mail me with your 'real' address.

Nancy
