Subject: rusty seam treatment, 85 

I, too have found the nasty rust forming is some of my seams this spring.  I
then read the archives and have considered my options.

While I like the thought of replacing the seam sealer with a weld bead,
wouldn't that weaken the metal.  I would expect there to be a good reason not
to weld the seam or it should have come from the factory that way?  I am
leaning toward sandblasting the sealer out along with all the rust and using
a rust preventative primer, then fresh seam sealer and then prime,  paint, &amp;
clear coat.

Is there anyone from the salt belt that has a few years on any seam repair
that can lend some opinion?
