&lt;&lt; I'll be looking at a 1991 Westphalia with all the equipment soon.  Does
anyone know of any particular problems with this year/model.  Also the asking
price is $14,900.  Is  this reasonable?.._dot_mileage is about 65k.  Anything I
should look for? &gt;&gt;

Run!  Vans with the spelling &quot;Westphalia&quot; are known to be counterfeit!  The
&quot;real&quot; ones are spelled &quot;Westfalia&quot;.  :)

Actually, this is the last year for Vanagons and the newer the better.  I'd
say a 91 with only 65k is about as good as you can get.  The price seems a
bit high though.  I'd offer them a couple thousand less and go from there.
