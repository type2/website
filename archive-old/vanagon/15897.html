Subject: Rebuilding Baby Dels

I have a set of Del 34's but have been unable to find a current location for
rebuilt kits for them. As a separate issue, I'd also like to find a source
for having the shafts redone i.e. reamed and rebushed. I have contacted a
couple of sources in So. California that &quot;used&quot; to be the spots for this
work. (Sorry, I don't have the names in front of me right now). These
sources say that the kits are next to impossible to get any longer and that
a smaller machine shop would be the place to have the shafts done due to the
amount of work involved compared to the required amount of dollars that they
would have to charge. In other words buy a $500.00+ set of del 40's and
don't waste their time with the small stuff. BTW: rebuild kits for Weber
40's are not hard to find. Your help would be appreciated.
