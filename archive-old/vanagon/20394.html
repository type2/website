Subject: re: window winder thingio - Gary 

     Please, where did you get the new mechanism?  I need to replace one in 
     my van, and it gets damn hot in NC not being able to roll down the 
     driver's side window.
     
     Gary, I bought this spare part in a VW spares dealer called Volkspares 
     here in London. Their address is:
     
     Volksparews Ltd
     104 Newlands Park
     Sydenham
     London
     SE26 5NA
     
     TEL: 0181-778-7766/0710
     FAX: 0181-676-9619
     
     Thanks for your reply - I might make another attempt this weekend and 
     I'll let you know how it goes
     
     Cheerio
