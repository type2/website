So Harry Yates says:
&gt; 
&gt; I never use mine.  The manual says only to cover the flue if you are 
&gt; going to wash the van or direct water around the flue itself.  If you 
&gt; cover it, you take a chance of letting condensation collect in the 
&gt; breather tubes.  I also leave my vent under the fridge (the brass 
&gt; end) off during the winter months.
&gt; 
&gt; The only time I put it on, is when I take the van in for service.  
&gt; Sometimes the dealer likes to wash the van, and they use high 
&gt; pressure.  Most of the time I remember to leave a note for them not 
&gt; to do that either!
&gt; 

While this may work for the moisture angle, it doesn't keep those pesky
spiders out nor the accumulation of dirt and vegetation crapola.  So
I do recommend using the cover and if condensation is evident, to remove
it when the opportunity is there so that it will air out the system.
