&gt; Wah-HAH-kah).  The road quickly became the twistiest, steepest, 
&gt; and highest we had yet encountered.  The road followed valleys, 
&gt; climbed mountain faces, followed mountain ridges, then dropped off 
&gt; the other side.  On some sections of road along these ridges the 
&gt; mountain dropped away thousands of feet on _both_ sides of us.  
&gt; I'd never experienced vertigo while driving before.  The road 
&gt; climbed up so high we felt short of breath when walking around, 
&gt; and the jungle had disappeared.  Oaks and scrub surrounded us, 
&gt; with the jungle canopy visible in the valley bottoms far below.  

       Incredible!!!
