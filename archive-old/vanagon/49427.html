&gt;In regards to taking the belt off the compressor.  I've heard that it is
&gt;unwise to take your belt off completely.  Apparently the seals in the A/C
&gt;system are lubricated by the Freon itself.  This helps them stay soft and
&gt;retain their sealing qualities.  If you don't use your A/C or take the belt
&gt;off, the seals dry out and the Freon leaks out and no A/C.  I run my A/C on
&gt;my '89 Jetta once a week all year and it still works like the day I got it.
&gt;Never been recharged.  Perhaps its unrelated....any ideas on this theory?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

Right you are Chris.  A/C Compressors need to be run in order to stay lubricated
