Locating these is a problem.  I'm reluctant to put a housing on the dashtop
for fear John Law will think it's a radar deflector.  I thought about 
putting an instrument binnacle in front of the passenger seat, to match
the original one in front of the driver.  Move the radio into that and
put the gauges where the radio is.  A lot of trouble, and then a long
reach to change tapes if you're driving alone.  I finally put two gauges
east of the lighter socket.  They look fine, and are readable even tho' the
angle is oblique.  Note that there is room for one 2 1/8&quot; gauge in the
blank area below the LEDs in the middle of the stock instruments.
Please play back any other ideas you have.
