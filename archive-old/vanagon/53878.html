Subject: 86' paint codes
Date: Tue, 7 Jan 1997 15:19:46 -0500 (EST)

I have been following the thread on rust repair as i am about
to do the same thing to a seam or two of mine.  Unfortunately i
have not been able to find my paint at a FLAPS.  I have the
metallic blue colored paint. I think it is the same that was
used on 84's and 85's and maybe even some later models.  Does
anyone know the paint code for this color or has anyone posted
this to the archives.  TIA
seamus
