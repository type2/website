&gt; Heys Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Did the road trip to Chicago from Philly and wiped out on the ice in
&gt; Indiana on X-Mas Eve. I slowly spun into the guard rail around South
&gt; Bend and whacked both my LF and LR sections of my bumpers.  I hit it
&gt; hard enough to rip off the front bumper and twist it into a pretzel, the
&gt; rear might bend back but it has a rip in it from the guard rail bolt.
&gt; 
&gt; All I can say is the van is tough as nails and slid to the lesser of two
&gt; evils, the guard rail not the median ditch.  NOBODY GOT HURT!!! not even
&gt; the dog, we did get minor muscle pulls in our necks but for as hard as
&gt; we hit I was amazed at what little damage was done.  As I had mentioned
&gt; both bumpers need replacing, the LF corner behind the bumper got crushed
&gt; but only up to the seam that's hidden by the bumper when on, lost a turn
&gt; signal lens, dented around the turn signal, the LR tow hook got bent
&gt; into the skirt that got bent into the CAT flange (made an awful noise
&gt; till I pulled it about a cm away) no damage to the exhaust.  Already
&gt; replaced the turn signal bulb with a yellow one to get home on and had
&gt; to replace the the RF headlamp cause the filiment broke during impact.
&gt; 
&gt; I was one of over 30 cars and trucks that lost it on the ice. Indiana
&gt; did not salt the road and there were fatalities.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm already getting a price from volks sport on new bumpers, but if
&gt; anyone has a parts van I could pick at it would sure help, email me
&gt; prices.

Hotch, 
I have two new chrome bumpers for a Gl. They are VW NOS.
I will sell them for $100.00 plus shipping.
                        Thanks,   Jay

PS I live in the Harrisburg PA area.--
