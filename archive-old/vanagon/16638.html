Subject: Did anyone else make it?

Did anyone else make it to the Wintermeet in Puyallup today (4-30)?  I saw
plates on buses from Oregon, BC, California, Arizona, N.M., as we were 
leaving- not exactly the time to think of making plans to meet anyone on the
net... 
Next time, as they say- but with sincerity.

Jeff
