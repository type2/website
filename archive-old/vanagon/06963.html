Subject: clutch cable replacement

&gt;What Fun!!!
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday my clutch cable seperated on my 72 bus - 8(
&gt;
&gt;So, tell me...How do you replace one of these things? I have done it
&gt;in a bug (had to remove the pedal assembly..) I know what it loos like
&gt;on the rear, what about the front? What needs to be taken off?
&gt;
&gt;Any and all help greatly appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;Regards,

&gt;\--------------------(Opinions Expressed Are My Own)--------------------/

The clutch cable is a snap!  So much so that I always carry a spare for my
1976 Westfalia.  I replaced mine twice in the last year, having learned an
important lesson on the first one: Don't stop at the clutch cable -- replace
the Boden tube as well!  A worn out Boden tube will eat a brand new clutch
cable in a few thousand miles.

So what the hell is a Boden tube?  It's the black stiff rubber-coated curved
tube that is attached to the transaxle, to handle the cable through the
necessary curve to get it to the relaese bearing lever.  If it is worn
inside, the cable scrapes against metal in the tube and frays.  

Replacement - the rear end is obvious, though you might grease it up with
some never-seize compound to make future adjustment easier.  The front:
Remove the pan, and take you 13mm box end (I think) with you.  The cable
comes from the back in its own metal guide tube, feeds into the frame, and
attaches to the spring-loaded return lever which supports the pedal.  This
is bolted to the frame with two 13mm bolts on a cup-shaped housing -- you'll
see it.  The cable has a little zig-zag to feed through the hole.  It's
rather obvious, just dig in and go.  There's no big trick -- just remember
where the cable feeds, and use plenty of grease on the new cable.

Good luck.
