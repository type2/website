Have you tried flowable RTV for windshields ?
Good Luck

&gt;   My '84 vanagon GL drips water from the inside body behind/below the

&gt;leaking
&gt;from the windshield, not the wiper or antenna mount? The PO mentioned
&gt;repairing extensive front end damage. 
&gt;
&gt;   Would removing the portion of the dash over the instruments reveal 
&gt;a
&gt;better look than what little I can see from below/under the dash?
&gt;
&gt;   Is there a windshield sealent that might fix this?
