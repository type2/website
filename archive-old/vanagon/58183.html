     I concur whole heartedly.  This has been my experience as well.

Yes! This is the second message of a similar vein I have replied to 
this week. The 10w30 does not &quot;hold&quot; enough pressure when hot; 20w50 
will work fine. Some say this is due to worn crank bearings/journals, 
but all I know is I have put 100k on my TD engine since first having 
this problem, with no signs of trouble. I installed a mechanical 
pressure gauge and saw a difference of up to 10psi between 10w30 and 
20w50 when hot, measured from the cylinder head sensor location.
