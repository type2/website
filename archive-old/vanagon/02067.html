Subject: EGR valve info.

This question is directed to those with EGR valves bolted to the throttle 
valve of their vanagons. When the engine was smogged the people at
 Fred's Garage (Menlo Park) put a smaller diameter washer to restrict the 
flow of exhaust gasses being returned into  the system. This was done to 
a) ensure proper startup and acceleration without  stumbling and b) to 
avoid the complexity and cost of replacing the valve ($200). My question 
is twofold: a) Is there any reason (other than a moral one) that the EGR 
valve should not  be blocked off completely thus avoiding the hassle of 
replacing it? and b) does the EGR lower the temperature of the fuel/air 
mixture making it less efficient (than without one). I ask this because the Euro models
of the Vanagons never had fuel injection and EGRs so maybe these engines 
weren't designed for this kind of pollution control equipment.

PS Is there any place that sells EGRs cheap? Thanks in advance - DC
