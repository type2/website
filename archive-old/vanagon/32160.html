Subject: Re: Using some list post in Limbo newsletter 


Jim,
I can't speak for the other listmembers, but I think the way to do this 
is for you to ask people's permission first.  At least I'd appreciate you 
doing that for me, in any event.  I've had some articles published in 
Funkengroovin and always have them attach a copyright disclaimer, just in 
case I decide to submit it somewhere else for publication.
Jack
