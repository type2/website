Subject: 84 Westy - *&amp;^#} sliding door handle - help!


After a year of getting floppier &amp; floppier the slider door handle 
finally broke right off. Lousy, cheap, shoddy white metal strikes again. 
Local VW dealer wants $175 Can. for replacement!

My local bus guru is having a hard time finding a replacement from the 
local wrecking yards. Little wonder - most 84's have probably had their's 
replaced and the supply is depleted.

I remember a fleeting reference on this list once about someone using one 
of the older chrome slider handles that was a perfect fit and didn't 
suffer from substandard metallurgy/engineering. 

Can anyone offer more specific help i.e. appropriate model years, 
caveats, etc. ?

I've searched the archives to no avail.

As a solution the older handle may not be pretty but I don't give a damn 
as long as it works.

TIA
