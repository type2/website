&gt;  
&gt; Hey James, 
&gt;  
&gt; Martha and I have been discussing here plans to use the stove as 
&gt; a heater off-line.  She's concerned about the by products of the 
&gt; LP burn and how to evacuate/vent them out of the camper.  I thought 
&gt; that there were no nasty by-products from burning LP gas and that 
&gt; the only concern would be the replacement of oxygen.  Can you 
&gt; or anyone else clarify this? 
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks, 
&gt;

 What do you mean by LP? Liquid propane?
 If so all the ***ane series of gases (methane, ethane, propane, butane, 
 pentane etc etc etc) can all produce by products of co, co2, H2o, c 
 among other things (not to mention minute amounts of the next gas 
 in the series)during the combustion process. What it actually produces 
 depends on loads of different factors, but any of the above are possible.

 Having said all that, my van has no heat in it, and in the past I've
 used a friends Tilly camping set (a big tin box with a gas canister,
 cooker and a grill/heater) to provide heat, and a brilliant job it
 does too. There are enough leaks/holes in my van to provide enough
 air intakes, but I still wouldn't sleep over night with it on and
 no window down.

 Marcus
