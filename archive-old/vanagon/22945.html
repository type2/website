&gt; have any information on the bottom line cost of doing the 6 to 12 volt

&gt; when I convert?

I would say do the 6V -&gt; 12V conversion when you do the engine.  The crank
is differnet on the 6V, so the 12V flywheel requires machining to fit on a
6V crank.  Or, I'll sell you a 12V flywheel already machined for a 6V
crank.  :) If you don't do it now, then when you do, use a 12V solenoid on
the 6V starter to avoid chewing up the teeth on the 6V flywheel.  

And if you have the original transmission, it WILL need to be clearanced 
for a 12V flywheel.  

When I got my bus it was 6V, but had a 200mm flywheel, so it was already 
clearanced for 12V.  

Does Hoover have a sermon on 6 -&gt; 12 volt conversions?
