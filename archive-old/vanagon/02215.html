An update for those of you keeping score at home.

I am having the problem with the Bus turning over but not
starting after I put in a relay a la The Idiot Book.

I put in a new battery and now it turns over faster but
still rarely starts.

The symptoms:  I wired in a relay per the Idiot book.  One
circuit involves the wire from the ignition switch and a
ground, which closes the second circuit which sends 12v from
the battery to the solenoid.

When I turn the ignition switch, the engine merrily turns
over but won't catch.  The thing is, I still have a wire
running from the ignition wire to the battery.  When I touch
that to the battery, it starts immediately.

I checked and cleaned the battery contacts (as someone
suggested), but since it DOES start... oh yeah, the ignition
switch is brand new too.

This is a '76 bus FI.  I am open to suggestions!

-Randy
