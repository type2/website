Subject: Re: Dual Carbs (help w/source)

&gt;Is there a source for for parts to the Dual carbs on the 72 -    Bus?
&gt;Just about exausted my resources trying to find either a replacement(s) 
&gt;or a source for the Solex air correction jet (155).
&gt;

I have a set of PDSIT's I pulled off of a '69 type III.   They are in good
shape with chokes and ran fine when removed and stored over five years ago.
I'd box them up and sell them for um..... $75, I'd cover the shipping.  They
have type III manifolds, linkage and air cleaner assembly (wide, flat,
roundy thing that goes across the top of the engine), with two new spare
filters (over $20 each).

Eug,
'71
