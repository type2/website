Subject: Re: Getting a vehicle into California - How hard?
Date: Wed, 1 Feb 95 13:49:49 PST

&gt; 
&gt; There is a possibility I will be moving to the magical land of earthquakes,
&gt; mudslides, floods and droughts.
&gt; 
&gt; How hard is it to bring a vehicle from Canada into California and how much
&gt; does it cost?  Does all the original emissions equipment have to be present
&gt; and functioning, or do I have to pass a smog check?

Be VERY careful! Not only must you pass smog, but your engine must
be stock and be outfitted with Cal Smog Gear appropriate for the
year and model..

Have lots fun..
