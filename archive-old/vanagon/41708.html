Subject: Eurovan Catalytic Converter

     Hello Eurovan Drivers:
     
     I have been considering trading my 1986 Vanagon GL for a 1993 Eurovan 
     and while doing some research via the Internet, came across an unhappy 
     Eurovan owner. Among other things, this individual states that as a 
     result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger 
     compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle, which requires 
     running the air conditioner constantly.
     
     Has this been your experience?
     
     Thanks for your help,
     
     Dave Maguiness
