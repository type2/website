Doug,

I am replying to the whole list on this because it does have a bit of VW 
content.  I recently (re-)viewed the movie version of &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot; 
and a nice red microbus is in many scenes and is pivotal to the story.

So, for anyone who wonders what happened to Arlo Guthrie, look at:

http://www.clark_dot_net/pub/downin/cgi-bin/arlonet.html

While your there, you will have the chance to send him email to which you 
just may get a reply.  Tell him how much you enjoyed his concert.  (You are 
welcome to say that I sent you, but I'm not sure whether that's a plus or 
minus.)

I do hope he gets to Phoenix one of these days.

Mike
