It's served me well, but I need to sell my '81.  I would have to get $750
for it.

It's a blue on blue, no frills model.  It currently has a 1700 (I think)
transplanted from a '73 or '74 411 or 412 (don't remember which), with a
pair of DCNF 40's for carburation.  We've driven this combination from
Kansas City, loaded, twice and commuted here for half a year.

Known foibles (besides the wrong engine):

cracked windshield, missing center seat, missing right side mirror, heater
controls locked up.

Good news:  no rust, heater heats well, pads and shoes new, clutch 15,000
miles old.

I could deliver in the Pacific Northwest, or in a line toward KC, or sell
the body, engine, and carbs separate. 

Thanks,

Port Townsend, Washington
