Subject: westfalia letters


I just bought the 9 plastic self-adhesive letters that spell
W-E-S-T-F-A-L-I-A at West Marine for 25 cents each.  Put on
a fresh coat of kool seal for a strong &quot;tooth&quot; on which to
apply them, and it looks pretty good.  As it's a lot cheaper
to do this than the reaffixing the stock ones, thought others
might be interested.   I got black, but I think they had several
other colors.  The font/typeface doesn't match exactly, but I
think it's good enough...
