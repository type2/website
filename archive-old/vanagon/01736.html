Subject: Things for Joel to Keep Track of....


It is obvious that Joel needs things to do on Fridays, so here's some
additional fields of data for his list:

1. Number of times sexual relations occured in one's van

2. Number of different sex partners

3. Size of rust holes

4. Number of rust holes

5. Number of drunks carried at one time

6. Number of drunks carried at one time WITHOUT anyone tossing
their cookies in the van.

7. Highest number of people carried in the van

8. Number of people carried in the van while high

9. Number of times crossed border into neighboring country versus
number of times stopped at the border

10. Number of plastic Jesuses on the dashboard (St Christopher 
medals do not count...however plastic Virgin Marys do).

11. Number of T1 Typ 2s still equipped with an 8-track tape player.


I'm sure we could come up with more!

P.S. The data for #2....number of different sex partners, that only
refers to the ones actually done in the van.

P.P.S. Hell, it looks like I have about as much time to waste as
Joel!!!
