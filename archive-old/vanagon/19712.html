&gt; I have the problem with the inner one that is plastic with a metal mould 
&gt; around insert.  I've been looking for some slow cure epoxy so I could mould 
&gt; a new one off of the broken part.  All the epoxy that I can find these days is 
&gt; the 5 minute stuff which is useless. Used to be able to get it in hobby shops 
&gt; about 15 years ago when I was into model aircraft but can't find it now.  
&gt; Anyone got a lead on this stuff?

There's lots of choice out there! Get thee to a plastic or fiberglass
shop. They should have a choice of epoxies. I've had good luck with
Industrial Formulator's G2 and Cold Cure epoxies. The G2 is better for
oily/resinous woods (not that that matters in your application) and
ColdCure is as the name suggests, able to cure at lower temps. Thickening
the resin with microballoons or fibers would be advisable - adds strength,
saves resin, and thickens.
