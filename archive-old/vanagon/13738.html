&gt;Yes Ive seen that Conversion too...!!! Its all fine and dandy, until you
&gt;want to go somewhere it seems! I have only seen pictures but i would like
&gt;to know more if anyone has a stat sheet on it....

if you can gopher in to halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu and look in Miscellaneous/
Vanagon/Files, there are a couple of Road Tests on the vw eurovan camper
and the winnebago camper, and a short take article on the vw camper. these
articles have some specs/stats in them.
