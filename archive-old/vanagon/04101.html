&gt; &gt; Hey joel...watchit!!  This list has been theraputic...my shrink says
&gt; &gt; that I am improving...I no longer spend all of my time 
talking/e-mailing
&gt; &gt; myself!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; :-)

&gt; &gt; &quot;They're comming to take me away, ha ha...they're comming to 
take me
&gt; &gt; away, ho ho....to the funny farm where life is beautiful all day 
&gt; &gt; long...&quot;  Napoleon the 14th....1966
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you play the flipside of the above 45 record...its the song played
&gt; &gt; backwards..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What the hell does this have to do with Vanagons? Dunno...except 
one
&gt; &gt; has to be insane to own an 82 Diesel Vanagon...I'm just plain
&gt; &gt; crazy...I own a EuroVan!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; COFFEE....COFFEE!!!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ric,
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm one of the few who actually remember this song.  ;)

This was actually one of my favorite songs until they took it off the 
airwaves because it offended a few people.  I glad to see it come back 
in a funniest hits CD.
