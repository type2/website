The gurgling noise, and I'm hypothisizing here, is the vaccuum control
unit that moves the flaps inside of the box that houses the heater
core. I assume that is what it is because I get the same noise
in my GTI and EuroVan.

Its nothing to worry about...what you have to worry about is if you
do NOT hear that noise!   :-)
