Subject: RE:  Good deal?


	I am looking at purchasing a 1983 Westfalia.  I would
appreciate any input on the situation.  
	The interior is in good shape, body and paint in excellent
shape.  The engine is not holding pressure in the third cylinder, and
the local VW mechanic estimates $800 to fix.  The odometer doesn't work, but 
the speedometer does.  A new windshield is needed sometime in the near
future, and there is no radio or antenna.  Brakes, tranny (manual),
shocks, CV joints, etc. are all in good shape.  The dealer is 
asking $4900, but said he will take off $800 for the repair of the bad 
cylinder.  The van has 124,000 miles showing on the non-functional 
odometer.
	Is this a decent price considering the condition and age of the 
van?  FYI I am planning to travel in this vehicle when I graduate in 
June.  Also, if anyone in the San Luis Obispo, CA area is interested in 
looking at the van with me, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Matt
