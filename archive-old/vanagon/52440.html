Subject: Re: Copy of: Bench seats for the front

A dealer in Merced, California has a neunsitzer Diesel Vanagon, sunroof too.
There are a few in the US, where *no* transporters were delivered -- only
Vanagons (aka Caravelle?).

Nice bus, they have removed the rear seats (making it into an almost Kombi)
and use it as a delivery vehicle.  They also have a factory Turbo Diesel
Rabbit Pickup they use.
