Subject: BUSES, VALUE, &amp; RESALE

Has anyone out there ever seen a real &quot;bluebook&quot; for older buses?  From an 
insurance point of view, I was quoted $150 a year for coverage when I asked 
about a '78 bus, IN DC, &amp; I'M IN MY 20's.  I was told that personal property 
tax would be $25.  This is great for now, but what happens when some fool 
hits me? (After all, DC can be pretty crazy)  Do I get a check from the 
insurance company for $50 because that's all it is worth?  I know an 
appraiser can give a value for an individual vehicle, but I was wondering if 
indeed there are older bluebook values with fair, good, excellent 
conditions, etc.  I seldom see buses for sale here in Wash DC and they vary 
so much that is almost impossible to compare.  I am going nuts trying to get 
one (even though I've never even stuck my head in one).  If I had a baseline 
&quot;value&quot;, I could add or subtract extra costs necessary to get it in the 
condition I want.  Again, any advise is appreciated.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!
