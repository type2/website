Subject:      drinking song (well, it FEELS like it oughta be Friday!)

ok, i'm silly enough to play this game. :)

how about the tune to Oh My Darling Clementine?  that's pretty easy to
screw up when you've had a few beers.

after fooling around with it for a while (trying give full value to the
taxpayers' dollars), all i could come up with was (to that tune, now):

Put a Honda on my roofrack
Just to carry it away.
People thought i had gone crazy
When i drove to work that day.

&lt;chorus&gt;
Oh my darling, oh my darling,
Oh my darling Volks-wa-gen.
You will likely live forever         &lt;You are gone and lost forever?&gt;
....&lt;can't think of a good one here&gt;

ah, well ... i guess it's a good thing i didn't sell the farm and move to
nashville as a songwriter, eh? :)
