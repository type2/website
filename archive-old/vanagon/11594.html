So Tim Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; The dealer came good for this! I am E-mailing from intensive care unit 
&gt; recovering from shock. Parts + repair + flatbed tow covered so far, and a 
&gt; compression check, 120-130 psi all round, adequate, not great, for 115K Km. 
&gt; Starts and runs normally, so no damage hopefully. Dealer is also picking up 
&gt; tab for new dash printed circuit 'board' which caused the oil light not to 
&gt; function. 
&gt; Will miracles never cease? Remember this was a used vehicle, 8 years old!
&gt;    tim s.

Wow! Which dealer is this?

I'd feel luck with just the tow..
