        Reply to:   RE&gt;VW motor lifespan ? (A Poll!)

'87 GL Weekender with 160k miles. I've only had it about a couple months, but
was told it is the original engine and heads. one head leaks a little. no oil
consumption.

'85 GL with 90k miles. Again, I just purchased it. Had rebuilt at 70k and had
one head pulled at 90k because the gasket was leaking.
