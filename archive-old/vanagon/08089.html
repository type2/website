Subject: Front Engine Seal

Hello !
	I was thinking of replacing my front engine seal on my '71 
Westy.  What I've read tells me I must pull the engine first.  It looks 
possible with much luck, lubrication, and aggravation to do it without 
pulling the engine.  Despite the ease of engine removal on my bus I would 
like to avoid that process in this weather and under my current working 
conditions. If anyone's done it before and could make any suggestions I 
would like to hear from you.  If it isn't possible I guess I'd like to hear 
about that too.

Thanks,

Ron Van Ness
