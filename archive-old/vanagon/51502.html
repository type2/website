Subject: next CCC's date


It looks like the third weekend of January may be preferable for
many of you, rather than the first weekend.  Or maybe even the
4th weekend would work as well.  Comments/votes?

Jan 17-19
Jan 24-26

Sami - I guess maybe we could do a pizza thing agian during that first
weekend, when you are out here visiting?

Lemme know...

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
