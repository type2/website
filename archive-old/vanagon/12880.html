Subject: Re: Lifespan, the next level??

OK, OK, I'll do it, send all the data you want, aarrgghhh. Is there a 
graduate degree in this study for me, modern anthropology?? The Vanagon and 
Its Owner, A Study in Obsessions and Errata.


Anyhoo, fill in the blanks after each line below, add your own details, no 
holds barred.  I've only had 18 wasserboxer responses, and 9 aircooleds. 
C'mon folks, eat some prune and get moving. 
        About them aircooleds, anyone willing to take them on? Perhaps 
grouped by engine size 1200, 1500,1600,1700,1800,2000cc. A lot more 
variability exists for the aircooleds, unlike 1900,2100cc vanagons, not to 
mention way more after market engine components. I don't know if one could 
make a lot out of them.
