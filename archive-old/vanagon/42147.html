Subject: CV joint bolt tools


&gt; 4.  Where is a good place to get the 12 point tool for removing CV joints
&gt; with the dreaded connections?  Thanks

I've used a 6-point metric allen wrench with no problems (I think it was
6mm but it could have been 7mm). You can buy the whole set of metric
allens for under $10 or pay $12 for the one 12-point tool (and I'm only
quoting a price I heard..I don't know of a source). 

	There are two different styles of bolt head AND tool-
6mm allen OR 12 point star (also 6mm?) You need to have the tool
that matches what's on your bus, at least to take 'em apart
and put on what you want!

	Try Snap-On (Yellow pages) or Mac Tools for the 12 point star.
I've seen '12 point VW wrenches' which were 10mm or so hexagonal stock
machined down to the 12 points for $5-$7. I guess you put your 10mm
socket over 'em. Its a tool you'll need as long as you work on VWs
(the 12 point star is what the factory uses).

	Bill
