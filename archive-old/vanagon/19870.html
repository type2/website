Subject: Re: Horse Trailers that look like Busses

I've done this many a time.  My Dad says that when he was looking for 
Model-T's (the Ford, not VW Trends) back in the Sixties, that he was often 
fooled by old manure spreaders (top bow looks like the windshield frame 
on a &quot;T&quot;).  Don't ya just hate it when that happens? ;)

&gt; an awful lot like a micro from a distance.  After many false alarms, I
&gt; finally realized that that smooth two-toned thing captured in my peripheral

&gt; Well, maybe I gave an extra peek just to be sure. : )
