Subject:      zu: automatic vs. manual transmission

hey james,
same pros and cons as with nearly all cars.

pro: easy and comfortable to drive
     from my point of view longer life than manuals
     more fun, no stress

contra: less mpg (about 8/9%)
     some people need to shift per hand to be a real driver
     less max. speed (about 6 mph)
     once broken, hard to fix
     hard to find here in europa

I have had a 88 2.1 auto without catalyst for more than 3
years and it was a wonderful car. i would prefer auto again
please xcuse my terrible english
best wishes
michael

&gt;Hello,

&gt;    I have found a nice 87 which I might purchase, but it
&gt;has an automatic
&gt;transmission.  Would anyone care to comment on the pros
&gt;and cons of the
&gt;automatic tranny ?

&gt;    As usual, thanks in advance for your help (you folks
&gt;have been quite
&gt;helpful so far with information, and I appreciate it !)
