     I did find a small tear in the Circuit foil, a friend says that a

 Go carefully and add a short piece of multi-stranded fine copper wire as a 
bridge. Scrap the protective coating of the region near the break with a 
sharp knife, X-acto. Lay on the copper wire and hold the iron on it to 
solder. Use flux cored solder, or flux paste and wipe clean after as flux 
continues to corrode metal afterwards. It is very easy to do more damage 
than you are trying to fix. Be patient. Try this before you order the new 
foil, you've got nothing to lose.


&gt;     Can I get it straight from VW? If so who has the number?

straight from the dealer? yes.
