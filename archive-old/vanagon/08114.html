Subject: Re: Re[2]: Water in gas tank

on a somewhat related topic, when i change the gear oil in my outboard
motor, the oil will look &quot;milky&quot; if water has mixed with the grease. It has
been my experience with gas and water that the water looks like droplets on
the bottom of a container. Gas and water mixed together kind of look like
what oil and vinegar salad dressing looks like before you shake it up.

&gt;&gt;Problem is, the stuff that came out was milky looking. I assume my gas
&gt;&gt;somehow has gotten water in it.  The problems seem have occurred since my
&gt;&gt;last fill up and I am now on the bottom quarter of the tank.
&gt;&gt;Any comments regarding what I should do to drain the tank and whether or
&gt;&gt;not any damage has been done?  Besides changing the filter, is there
&gt;&gt;anything else I should do to try to purge the system or clean it out once
&gt;&gt;I drain the tank?
&gt;
&gt;Milky? That does not sound like water. As a pilot I routinely draw samples
&gt;of gas out of tanks to check for water, and often see it. But it appears,
&gt;in a clear container filled primarily with gas, on the bottom as a clear
&gt;&quot;bubble&quot;, perhaps containing rust or other contaminants. Of the hundreds
&gt;of times I have seen water in gasoline, it has never appeared as &quot;milky&quot;.
&gt;Did anyone use a sealant on your tank? An oil/water emulsion might appear
&gt;milky...I guess.
