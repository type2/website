Subject: Re: No-starter situation.



&gt;The discussions over the last week about this problem sound like the wiring
&gt;circuit is getting some high resistance connections.  Has anyone tried
&gt;tofilrst identilfy and trace the starter circuit, and then go through the
&gt;circuit connection by connnection and open each one, clean and reconnect to
&gt;see if this solves the problem?


A short re-post, Harvey:

In my experience with (older) busses, the connection to the solenoid
(from the starter switch) is usually the culprit. Clean, tighten,
reinstall, enjoy.
