Subject: fair price for 91 GL ???

I am sad to say that it seems to be the time to move on from 10 years of
Vanagon ownership and hopefully into a Passat TDI Wagon.  I need to know
what a fair price would be for my  GL.  Edmunds guide lists wholesale
around $9600 and retail at $11800.  This is what I have:
-1991 Vanagon GL, 4spd, Tornado red.  It has the weekender feature.
-serviced on schedule and very well maintained!!!
-107,000 miles, however, 2 new cylinder heads at 102,000 miles, new brakes,
rotors and pads, 1 year old guaranteed for life muffler, most other pipes
replaced at same time.
-clutch is original and working fine.
-new Kelly Navigator tires

I wouldn't mind keeping it but I know nothing about working on this (or any
other) vehicle myself and with many long trips still on the agenda I'm a
bit worried about what may lie ahead.  It seems to make sense to sell it
while it still has some decent value to it.

Considering it's excellent shape, can I expect anything near the Edmunds
price range or am I way  off base because of the miles?

Thanks in advance for any opinions offered.
