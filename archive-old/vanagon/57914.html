Hi all...

My Vanagon and I took our first trip together over Easter, and it was great
with the exception of some minor problems.

At one point, when I attempted to turn the engine off, the key was stuck in
the on position. I was able to turn it enough to stop the engine, but I had
unplug the wire harness from the switch and hot wire it to get home
(praying the whole way that the steering lock wouldn't engage) because the
lock was completely jammed. My question is this; can the electrical switch
part be separated from the key cylender or do they have to be replaced
together? Is it possible that a short caused the electrical contacts to
fuse together?

Also...

What is normal operating water temperature? The needle on my temp gauge
hovers anywhere from just over the top half of the LED to not quite to the
next little dot on the scale. This seems high to me. Also the fan sometimes
comes on as soon as I turn the key, and other times it doesn't seem to come
on at all. How do I check it?

And...

Has anyone had any experience with Dunlop GT Qualifiers? My FLATS tells me
that its a 6-ply tire that would be sturdy enough yet be very responsive
and quieter than an small truck tire.

Thanks in advance!!!
