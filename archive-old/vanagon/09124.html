Subject: Heater Cold

Well, I purged the air from the coolant system, but on occasion, the 
heater runs cold.

My guess would be a continued air blockage.

Any other suggestions?

Also, my bus is later than the VIN numbers for the rear heater T and the 
metal bleeder screw, so I'm OK there.  Still, I have a seep.  Any 
suggestion before I eviscerate the heater?  Any ideas on cost, if it's 
the heater - can it be fixed or does it mean a new one?
