Subject: Re: Leakin' oil

I had an oil leak I couldn't track down on my 80 Westy. It seemed 
to be leaking around the oil filter, cooler area.  I finally 
changed the oil pressure sending unit and the leak dried up.  Now I 
have no oil drips at all under the engine when parked.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'd noticed before (and I checked then, believe me!) that the oil 
level 
&gt;&gt;was dropping a lot faster than normal.  I'd say Peter Lima's 
description 
&gt;&gt;of &quot;dripping oil like a seive&quot; describes our situation pretty 
well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Total repair cost?  Zero.  Time invested in repair?  Maybe 12 
seconds.  
&gt;&gt;Problem?  Oil filter unscrewed and was nearly ready to fall off!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;D'oh!!  I check the tightness of the oil filter before every long 
or 
&gt;&gt;off-road exploring trip now.  I'd hate to pollute our wilderness 
with 4 
&gt;&gt;litres of used 20/50--also hate to risk blowing the motor by 
running it 
&gt;&gt;for even a few seconds with zero litres of oil in it!
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Two questions!
&gt;1. What if I ain't got an oil filter?
&gt;2. Why were you using 20/50?  Seems very thick -- my mech recommends
&gt;straight 40.  20/50 can hide leaks however, I've noticed.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway ol' Scarecrow is back in the garage again. . .failed emissions
&gt;miserably yesterday and is really leaking oil (someone had to mop up behind
&gt;me at the emissions station after I drove away!)
