Subject: Aerodynamics



The thought of a bus being 'aerodynamic' tends to make some folks jump up &amp;
down, wave their arms and make strange noises.  To them, aerodynamic means a
car that looks like a pumpkin seed.  Wrong.  They're getting the definition
of 'streamlined' mixed up with 'aerodynamics,' which deals with how solids
interact with gases.  If we were were talking boats we might call it
'fluid-dynamics' but the truth is you use the same formulas, changing only a
few of the factors.  To a physicist, gases and liquids are both 'fluids'.

A brick can be aerodynamically defined.  The definition has to do with how
much drag a shape produces at a given speed.  If you streamline a shape, it
will have less drag.  I think the drag co-efficient of a brick is about .95,
mebbe more.  Bricks work best at jobs where they can just lay there and look
at you.  Flying a brick is a task reserved for foolish young Air Force
pilots, who are usually in the reserves.

To establish a standard defining how well streamlined an object may be, you
compare the drag of the flat-plate profile of the object to the actual
object, with the drag of the flat plate -- whatever amount of drag it may be
-- chalked up on the board as '1.00'.  Then you run the same test with the
real object.

A Volkswagen bus turns out to be pretty well streamlined, at least up to 28
miles per hour, the speed at which the original work was done.  The early bus
had a drag co-efficient of about .30, compared to its flat-plate area,
meaning the bus has less than a third of the drag of a flat plate that
exactly matches the cross-sectional profile of the bus.  Adding the overhang
above the windscreen screwed all that up of course, bumping the drag up to
.32
  
Even so, a drag co-efficient of .32 is pretty good.  Or, as an aerodynamicist
would say, pretty slick :-)

Given enough wing, you could fly a bus.  Assuming you had enough engine.  And
a big enough fuel tank.  And a foolish young Air Force pilot to drive the
thing.  Of course, it would be a terrible thing to do, what with all those
folks on the ground craneing their necks and pointing up at the sky when the
old bus thundered overhead.   On the other hand, if you stick a husky 2200cc
Type I engine on the nose of a Piper Cub you can fly around the world an no
one would even notice.  Truth is, a lot of folks have done just that.
