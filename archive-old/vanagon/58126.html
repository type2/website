&gt;&gt; Chris, Thoreau is right, though I doubt he's the original philosopher. I
&gt;&gt; don't care if you banter like biddy hens off the list, but political
&gt;&gt; discussions aren't appropriate on the list...at least not on my watch.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks! Joe (substitute list administrator)
&gt;
&gt; But, I was at the impression that Friday's were open discussion days ... 

If someone is going to write something inflammatory, controversial or
otherwise provocational in the context of their VW then shouldn't we at
least be able to offer a counter point on Fridays?
