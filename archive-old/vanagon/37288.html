&gt;Above the sliding rails for the side door on the baywindows is a 
&gt;cover plate.  It's held in place by two screws.  My question is, 
&gt;after these 2 screws are off, how do you remove this plate?
&gt;There is one on the opposite side of the bus, too.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

There is a long metal strip that is wedged between the body of the bus and
the cover plate.  Toward the front is a screw that, if loosened, relieves
the tension in this metal strip.  It's hard to explain without pictures.  But
you have to have the sliding door open to get to the screw.  And the center
line of the screw is parallel to the the center line of the bus.  When you
have the screw loosened several turns, tap the end of the screwdriver to move
the metal strip toward the rear of the bus, relieving the tension.
