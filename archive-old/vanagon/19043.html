Subject: Benz rims



I am quite glad to learn that they will fit.  I had my van
parked next to my dad's wonderful deisel spewing Mercedes,
and had a sneaking suspicion that they were the same size.
 
Where can you find them cheap??  Gads if everything on that
car isn't very expensive.
 
 
My other tidbit of knowledge is that I finally found a domelight
for my '77, which happened to come from a '80 Rabbit.  I had been
looking for one forever......
