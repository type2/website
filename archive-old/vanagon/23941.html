Subject: Re: WTB Type III Bentley or Haynes

&gt;I guess the subject says it all.  My friend bought that '72 Squareback
&gt;so I told him I would see if I could scare up a cheap Bentley and/or 
&gt;Haynes for it.  Anyone?  Thanks, Jim

James,

Yeah, I have the Haynes manual from the days of my '64 Notchback.  But
what's the use?  I think they sell for $13 or so.  Hmmm, also happen to have
a Type III 12v generator (working), voltage regulator, rubber accordian,
blah and blah...

Cheese

P.S.  I traded the Notchback (needed paint real bad, otherwise great
mechanically and body-wise) for a '71 Westfalia (good shape, low miles)
plus, the guy threw in $250!
