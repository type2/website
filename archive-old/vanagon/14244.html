Subject: Photos Needed for Screen Savers

We write Windows-based screen savers and are looking
for shots for our automotive product line.  (If you want
to learn more about our company, check out 'The Boston
Globe' 17-Mar-1995 for an article in the Business
section that talks about what we do!)

Subjects for which we currently need photos:
  British Sports Cars
  Rods &amp; Customs
  Antique Vehicles

If you want your photos to be considered for use in a
screen saver please send us your pix - no more than
2 photos per subject - standard photos, not slides.
(We'll accept almost any scanned file format)

We can return your photos if you include a Self
Addressed Stamped Envelope.  Let us know if you want
a caption displayed with the image (ex: &quot;Jane Smith's
1960 Bugeye&quot;).  If we use your photos we will also send
you a complimentary copy of the screen saver.

Here's a short description of our screen saver features:
 - Fully Windows compatible, integrates into Windows Desktop
 - Optional password protection built in
 - Extra program included which lets you quickly turn on a screen saver
 - Adjustable display time for images
 - Comes on two  3.5&quot; disketts
 - Easy-to-use Setup program installs everything
(And no one beats our price of $7.99 plus $2.00 S&amp;H!)
