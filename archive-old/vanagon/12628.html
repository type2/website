&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From the March 11th Auto Trader:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;     1.  Rare 1960 Volkswagen delivery van, doors both sides, all 
&gt;orig., 
&gt;&gt;&gt;runs good, minimum rust, $4500 obo, days 214-579-7440, eve. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;214-254-4807. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What makes it so rare?  Is it a panel or a Kombi or deluxe?  I have 
&gt;seen
&gt;&gt;both a rare deluxe and a rare Kombi both being double door buses.  But 
&gt;a
&gt;&gt;double-door panel doesn't seem so rare.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;     2.  1960 Volkswagen Bus, double doors, walk through, most there, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;less motor, new tranny, straight axles, some body work, very little 
&gt;&gt;&gt;rust, great restor. project, needs someone w/time, money, TLC, $700 
&gt;&gt;&gt;nego., new glass tail lenses.  214- 272-7840.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Don't want any hack jobs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;     Both these vehicles are in the Dallas, Tx area.  Picture of #1 
&gt;&gt;&gt;shows both sets of doors open and appears to be a bench seat.  Picture 
&gt;&gt;&gt;of #2 looks like rear wheel arches have been opened to allow bigger 
&gt;rear 
&gt;&gt;&gt;wheels.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks though for looking.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;     I see e-mail from somebody in Minnesota who says he is looking for 
&gt;a pre-1962 double door.  I take time to respond to him because I have 
&gt;seen two of them for sale in the Auto-Trader (pretty unusual to see one, 
&gt;much less two in the same issue).  I write the ads exactly as they 
&gt;appeared in the Auto-Trader.  The first one says &quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  I write 
&gt;&quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  He responds &quot;What makes it so rare?&quot;  How the hell do I 
&gt;know?  I'm just trying to be helpful to someone who says he is looking 
&gt;for a particular split window.  The sellers phone # is included so you 
&gt;can find out why he thinks it's rare.
&gt;      Then I include my observations from the pictures in the 
&gt;Auto-Trader, &quot;...looks like rear wheel arches have been opened to allow 
&gt;bigger rear wheels.&quot;  He responds &quot;Don't want any hack jobs.&quot;  Buy your
&gt;vehicle in Minnesota then.  Be sure to get one that already has the 
&gt;rusted out rear wheel arches replaced so you don't end up with a&quot; hack 
&gt;job&quot;.  How much do those arches cost, $50-100 each plus installation?
&gt;         
&gt;
Boy, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  I wasn't accusing you
of any of it - lighten up!  Do you take everything so personally?
Geeeeeeeeezzzzzzzzzzzzz!
