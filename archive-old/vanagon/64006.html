Last year I sent them a $4 check for a catologue, they cashed it and I never
recieved the catologue.  I know its only a lousy four bucks but when I called
them a few months later, they said &quot;we have a new one at the printer and will
send it out&quot;  I never got it. Called again a few months after that and the
same thing was told to me. So I would never bother to order from them in the
first place.
