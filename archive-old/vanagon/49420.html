Subject: What prep/primer should I use?

Hi folks,

Well, I'm getting ready to install the Propex/Carver heater
under the bench seat in my '91 camper.  I have to drill a
couple of 1.5 inch holes through the floor which I will measure
at least twice and then think about it some more.  And then
after some more hemming and hawing will actually cut the holes.

What I need input on is how should I post prep the holes so they
don't start rusting.  Propex set some epoxy, but I don't think
that will cut it.  So if you folks can give me some good recom-
mendations, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
