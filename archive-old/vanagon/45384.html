Brian asks:


&gt;Hi Ric, all OK? You said:

All's fine here....how's things over there?

&gt;&gt; It seems to me that VW has been having problems with these things burning 
&gt;&gt; up...all considering that I purchased the &quot;B&quot; resistors last July and now 11 
&gt;&gt; months later they have a &quot;D&quot; version.

&gt;As you probably know, VW parts can be long on the shelf as well, maybe you
&gt;get a &quot;B&quot; version again next time...

I don't think so this time. I went to the parts department with the receipt 
from when I purchased the resistors last year. The parts guy punched in the 
&quot;B&quot; number on his inventory system...the system responded that the number 
had now been replaced by the &quot;D&quot; number.

As I said, there is a major difference in the construction of the two 
resistors, and the date stamp on the part indicates an April mfg. date.

Ric
