Subject:  rebuilding an 81/spare engine

hello again, it is me with the chirping van freakshow.  

i had a mechanic do a leak-down test, and he did a compression test
while he was at it.  i tested compression (hot engine) last week, got 125,
125, 90, 105. (wet 125, 125, 105, 120).  he tested cold and got 75, 85,
95, 100.  ouch.  maybe i don't know what i'm doing, but i thought i did it
right.  leakdown results: 60%, 30%, 20%, 10% (0-10% acceptable). oof. 
as with the previous 2 times i brought it to him, he couldn't find the chirp,
even though i isolated it to the passenger side, but thinks it is the
head/jug interface.  (did i mention that there are _NO_  good type II/vw
shops in lansing michigan? they either charge too much, or try to rip you
off, or don't know/care what they are talking about/doing)  i just got the
vehicle last summer, and was hoping for no major attention for awhile,
but it looks like it is time.  140,000 miles tend to tire out an engine.  at least
i have a  job.  

friday i'll be driving mellowly about 175 miles (to my hometown of
traverse city)  to an excellent, reputable type II mechanic who works for
$40/hour (hope i make it there ok w/o a flatbed), and he will rebuild it.  i
have stopped giving myself delusions that i could do it myself without
experience/help/garage/proper tools (i don't want to rely on the list for
quite that much guidance), even though it was fun to live under those
delusions for awhile, and i bought the bus with the intention of doing so. 
i guess i'd rather be backpacking than clueless under a bus this spring.

i thought of just putting in a semi-fresh engine instead (my brother has
one in los angeles), but for the cost of shipping/miscellany and
considering longevity it seems to make more sense to rebuild mine.  it's
nice to have a backup plan in case something is really wrong with mine,
though.  if i don't use it/for parts, i'll surely let the list know, after i inform
david shwarze (sorry if i spelled it wrong again), who expressed
interest a few months ago.

if you have any suggestions/cautions i'm open to them.

matthew (and mobius the adventurewagen, soon with reconditioned
ticker)
