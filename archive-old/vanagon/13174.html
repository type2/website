So Pete Sellers says:

&gt; I spent two days in San Franciso; the remainder of the time in and around 
&gt; Sacramento.

Well damn!  You should've let me know, I would have met with ya!

&gt; After the second day I became very aware of a visual absence and went looking ...
&gt; 
&gt; During the entire time, I did not see one Eurovan in California. I even looked for 
&gt; addresses in the Yellow Pages and drove past VW dealers, none there. I was up and 
&gt; down Highways (5, 80, 99, etc.). Saw plenty of vans (all types, colors, configurations, 
&gt; etc.); no Eurovans. Even saw a Vanagon (possibly '91) with ski racks mounted on the 
&gt; top and rear hatch, looked very good!!

I see them pretty frequently in Sac.  Where were you at?

&gt; Perhaps California does not recognize Eurovans (or worse, the folks out there aren't 
&gt; aware that VW still is making new models) ;)

I think you were driving with your eyes closed. ;)
