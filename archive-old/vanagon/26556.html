&gt; one can never put a price on something without seeing it, but I have NO IDEA

Well, I recently bought a '66 Westy for $400 from a psuedo-junk yard.  It 
is rough but very complete.  The only things missing are the sink/icebox 
and one screen.  It has no brakes and lots of rusty places.  I'm planning 
on using this as a Winter project while I drive my '73 bus/camper (if I 
get it running again soon) so I have plenty of time.  I would, however 
like to getting running and stopping well before I take it completely 
apart, though (hmmmmm).  Oh yeah, the interior is in perfect condition 
(once I get all that hideous brown plaid contact paper off everything).  
Hope this helps.
