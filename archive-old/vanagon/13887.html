Subject: Salutations!! and.....

Comrades!!!
    Thank you, Joel, for inviting me aboard! As soon as I got your e-mail I
unsubscribed my self from the Vintagvw deal and signed up with you kids!! I
was growing a skosh weary from the &quot;Re:My Hot Bug&quot; enthusiasts!! It is a
great releif knowing someone has had the inspiration to create a cyber-world
for Buses alone!!!!
    And now, the meat::::::I have a new baby; she is a '71 Camper, and I
loved her at first sight. She looked so dejected resting all alone and
segregated from the other cars (used car lot). Aged and abused....but proud.
I scooped 'er up an' brought her home whereupon I promptly invested a fairly
healthy chunk of dough on new calipers, rotors, brake lines, discs, shoes,
wheel cylinders - basically, the whole braking system. Only AFTER doing so I
had a mechanic take a Compression Test. Yeah, I know, I know; color me
brain-dead. But, what's done is done, and now I'm left with a very tired
engine. I want to keep her. I don't wanna give up on her; she's been so
neglected as it is! I'm asking you all what my options are and how cheaply I
might be able to make her strong again. What do new engines start at? Can I
just replace the heads and rings with good results?? Is that expensive to
have done?? &lt;&lt;sigh&gt;&gt; I'm desperate. Somebody heellpp meeee!!
Thanks ever so much!
Rachel
