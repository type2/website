Sell the van and buy a one when you get to Portland.

&gt; Subject: How to ship a van across the US?
&gt; Date: Monday, December 02, 1996 12:01 PM
&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I need to get my van from Raleigh, NC to Portland, OR and I don't want to
drive
&gt; it (for reasons, see below).  I also have a paultry amount of personal
&gt; belongings, all of which will fit into the van. I have to be in Portland
by
&gt; January 6, and I cannot leave NC until after Christmas day.
&gt; 
&gt; If any of you have experience that may help me make a decision as to how
to do
&gt; this, I would greatly appreciate some input.  Here are some of the
options that
&gt; I want to investigate:
&gt; 	-) renting space on a Car Carrier and shipping it there
&gt; 	-) having a moving company ship it along with my furniture
&gt; 	-) renting a truck and towing it there myself
&gt; 
&gt; The question I am most interested in from this list is the feasability of
&gt; having the van towed/car-carried/shipped across the US.
&gt; Are there transport companies that can do something like this?
&gt; Has anyone shipped a vehicle across the US in a car carrier or by some
other
&gt; 	form?
&gt; How much money might I be looking at?
&gt; Who might I contact for more information?
&gt; Are there any options that I do not know about?
&gt; 
&gt; You might ask why I do not want to drive it there, so here are the
answers to
&gt; that question:
&gt; 1) This would be my fifth trip across the US in the past year and a half,
and
&gt; I've kind of seen enough of Kansas and the world's largest groundhog.
&gt; 2) The van isn't running well, and I don't have any money to get it
fixed.
&gt; 3) I have furniture to ship, as well.
&gt; 4) I want to spend my small break between grad school and the real world
(HA!)
&gt; climbing in central Oregon and not driving a rented Uhaul towing a van
across
&gt; the US alone.
&gt; 5) My company will reimburse me for the expenses, but only AFTER I show
up for
&gt; work (see money to fix van).  Plus, I don't need transportation or
furniture
&gt; immediatley.  I can have it all arrive after I get the money to have it
&gt; shipped.
&gt; 6) I don't have the mental capacity to want to deal with diagnosing my
van
&gt; problems right now.
&gt; 7) I'm tired.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any and all help you can give.
