Subject: broken CV bolt on an '85 Vanagon
Date: 5 Mar 1995 21:23:59 GMT

	HELP!!  I just pulled the axle-shaft to replace both the left CV's
in my '85 Vanagon.  Well as soon as I got the axle out, I noticed that
one of the 6mm allen head bolts that's used to hold on the outer joint 
had NO HEAD on it!
The axle shaft itself came off with no problems, but I don't want to put
 on a new CV until I can get the old bolts all off,
I've tried vise-grips and pliers...but it's an incredibly tight spot
inside that trailing arm.  Does anyone know of any way to get this out?
I'm going to the autoparts store tomorrow to get one of those stud
removers.  $30 for a tool I can't foresee myself using anytime in the 
near future, plus, if it ends up just breaking the bolt, and a screw
extracter won't work...it's off with the stub axle.  This is supossed to
be a relatively simple, but messy job.  ARGHHHHHH!!   I hate former
mechanics who use air tools and no torque wrech!!!
