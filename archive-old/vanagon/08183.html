Yo,

	I am thinking about eventually putting H4's on my bus, when I convert
to 12V, when I get the fridge from David.  I just put a set on my SO's
BMW, and wowser! what a difference.  She has a 530i, and I put in 2 H4's
and 2 H1's, with 55/60W bulbs.  I'm also planning to put them on the
911, if I can't find the other Hella lights I want for a reasonable 
price.

	Has anyone put these on a VW, especially a bus?

	For the uninitiated, these are the headlights with the separate lens
and bulb.  The lense and reflect are WAY superior to even the halogen
sealed beams.   There is also a 100W bulb available.  Yow!
