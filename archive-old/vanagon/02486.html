Subject: westy tipping?


Has anyone else out there heard that westy's in the US are prone
to tipping to the left on left turns because of so much of the weight
of these things being on the left side of the van (kitchen, etc.)?
If so, does anyone have any brilliant idea about how to prevent
this potential?
