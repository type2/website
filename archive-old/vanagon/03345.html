&gt; Hello to all!
&gt; 
&gt; This database that my husband has is 
&gt; *not-for-profit* in any way, shape, or
&gt; form. It has never been printed in its
&gt; entirety - if we were to go to a show
&gt; in Connecticut, say, we might print the 
&gt; portion of it of CT folks. Then when he
&gt; meets someone, he asks for their name.
&gt; If they are on the list, he may ask for
&gt; more info, like what type of 64 bus. If
&gt; they want to be included, we'll add to
&gt; the list. It is *not* intended to be dis-
&gt; tributed to any persons, clubs or after-
&gt; market advertisers.  

I have a '73 Safare custom camper.  Are you keeping track of
this year?  I would be happy to add my data to your list...

-David
