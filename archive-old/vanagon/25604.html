Hi folks,

Any ideas on this?  Its starting to change seasons here in
Roanoke, VA, and as its getting a little cooler, I'm seeing a
slight problem with my 89 Westf.  When I just start it up, if
I don't let it warm up for 10-15 min, it wants to bog out &amp; die
when I put any load on the engine (like when I pullout at the
stopsign at the end of my road).  Other than that, it runs
great!   (didn't I just describe this as a &quot;cherry&quot; not too
long ago?  I shoulda knocked on wood...)
