Subject: FS in Pa:  Rust-free Calif. '76 Westfalia

For sale:  '76 Westy, chrome yellow, from Calif.  Body totally 
solid.  NO RUST.  Small dent behind sliding door.  Pop top canvas 
and camper interior not perfect, but nice. Missing the table.

Needs some mechanical work, although it does run &amp; drive the way it 
is. Pretty bad oil leak (oil cooler seals, I think), seems a little 
lethargic (compression is OK but not great; (112, 91, 97, 100).  I 
think I hear a slight knock, but it seems to come and go.  Front 
end a bit loose, brakes a bit spongy but they stop.  Trans &amp; clutch 
seem fine.

In summary, this bus has a really solid body but needs someone to 
give it some mechanical attention. If you have the time &amp; 
inclination, you'll never find a more solid bus here on the East 
Coast. I was going to do the work, but I've got way too many busses 
on my hands.

Price: $2000 firm.   

Email me or (610) 754-8989.  I am in the Philadelphia/Allentown 
area.
