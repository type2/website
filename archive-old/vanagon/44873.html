&gt;&gt;As a 20 year old, I once chased a friend around his own turf in western
&gt;&gt;Pennsylvania in my '69 Loaf. He, being well aquainted with the roads, tried
&gt;&gt;hard to shake the &quot;squid&quot; following him. On one turn, which was blind, down
&gt;&gt;hill and right angled, I threw the bus over hard enough to gring something
&gt;&gt;on the underside against the ground. Oh, I had some sticky Toyo Z raidials
&gt;&gt;on the bus inhibiting sliding. After he saw the sparks, he slowed down
&gt;&gt;considerably, he said, to save my life. My motto: always make friend who
&gt;&gt;are smarter than you are!

&gt;Jim do you have any idea what dragged? Looking under my van, everything
&gt;seems to be at least 14&quot; off the ground. If I were to lean my van further
&gt;and further, I think the first thing to drag would be the rear view mirror?
&gt;After that it would be a toss up between the hubcaps, and the door handles?

May be it was that JATO unit I had duct-taped on ..:~}

Actually, I have no idea what the source was, but both I and my friend saw
sparks in the twilight lighting conditions. I do believe I was on two
wheels. Theory One: The BIG C-channel bumpers I had bolted on rubbed (they
didn't stick out that far, though, for safety reasons). Theory Two: A rock
from the road edge (which I definitely used all of to make the turn) got
stuffed up into the wheel well and pinched when the wheel compression
started. Theory three: The California Camping Crazies, on a recruting
mission to the east coast, were at that very moment attempting to start a
magnesium fire under &quot;wonderbread&quot; (the vans name) and the sharp turn
thwarted their plans.

Remember, you're not paranoid if they really are out to get you.

P.S. Your post was one of the nicest I've ever had anyone use to question
my veracity :')
