&gt; I think I'm interested in selling my 86 Westy syncro. Not camping 
&gt; anymore - what is a realistic price to ask?  I bought it new and 
&gt; have all the repair records. Just replaced the heads, muffler and a 
&gt; a wheel bearing.  Small rust in seams, noisy sink console and small 
&gt; dent in nose from a flying 2x4, bra covers it. It has air, stereo 
&gt; and all the other standards.  Sherwin
&gt;  Sherwin Kaufman Spring Valley, New York 86 Westfalia Syncro

Just one data point on an '86 Syncro Westie in NY (They are scarce here).

I saw one for sale some time ago. The lady was asking $7800.

Data: '86 Syncro Westie Weekender (Poptop and electrical fridge but
without the stove and sink). Some 60 000 miles. Rusted muffler.
Couldn't see much other rust. Recent tranny repair (diff lock). Clean 
camping interior (Nearly unused! Why do these people buy westies?) 
Two tone brown exterior. Similar interior colors. 

I wanted a full camper interior (like my '82) and didn't like the
brown color, so I passed. Was bought by another westy owner who
upgraded 2WD -&gt; 4WD. I don't know actual selling price.

Tip: If you want to sell locally put for sale signs in the windows.
VW bus addicts tend to fixate intensively on brick-shaped moving
objects. I would guess that this kind of exposure is more effective
than placing microscopic ads in the local &quot;shopping guides&quot;.
Stimulates impulse buying ;-)
