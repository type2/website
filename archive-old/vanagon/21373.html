Repadding your seats (your westy's!) will make a huge difference in the 
size of your smiles while driving your westy.  Christa and I did this in 
our '76, and it was pretty straightforward, relatively easy, and worked 
out very well.  

Don't listen to your husband.  Putting another cover over the old will be 
unsatisfactory, and will continue to trash the original seat covers.  
Don't take the 'easy' way out.  

How to do it:
Remove the seats from the vehicle.  In my bus, the driver's seat just 
slides forward all the way off the seat rails.  You may have to depress a 
lever somewhere to get the seat past a stop designed to keep the seat 
from derailing unintentionally.  Snoop around as you're trying it, and 
you'll figure it out--this isn't rocket science.  I forget for the moment 
how the passenger seat comes out, but it's fairly straight forward as well.

OK, you've got the seats out and they're sitting on your living room 
floor.  Look at the underside of the seats.  The covers are attatched to 
the seat by little pointy metal tabs spaced around the edge of the bottom 
cover, and the tabs hold down a piece of wire that goes around the bottom 
edge of the bottom cover.  I hope this is making sense.  Look at the seat 
as you read this, and you'll see what I'm trying to say.  Bend these tabs 
back with a large flat head screwdriver or vise-grip or whatever works 
for you.  Try not to tear the fabric though!

The bottom seat cover should just lift off now.  The cover, as you'll 
see, holds the padding over a bed of springs.  CAREFULLY remove the 
padding--it'll be messy, 'cause it'll want to fall apart.  You'll be 
using this old padding as a pattern when you go to the foam store to buy 
new replacement padding.  

The cover for the back of the seat is secured in a similar manner.  The 
metal tabs are located at the bottom of the seat back, on the back edge.  
The cover lifts off by working it straight up.  If you've got headrests, 
just leave the cover dangling just below the headrest inside out.  
Carefully remove the padding for the seat back, draw the pattern for this 
one too.  

Clean the frame of the seat up.  Check for broken springs, hoping you 
have none.  Check the condition of the covers.  Mine had several holes 
where the springs had poked through, so I patched them from the inside 
with pieces of canvas fabric.  Draw your patterns for replacement padding 
using the old pads.  Leave a comfortable margin all around--you can always 
cut stuff off if you've got too much.

Go to your FLFS (Friendly Local Foam Store) and get replacement padding, 
showing your patterns to the folks there, explaining exactly what they 
are for.  We had them laminate two types of foam together: a high density 
foam for the bottom, and some softer stuff for the top layer.  The also 
have a band saw so they can cut the foam to exactly fit your pattern.  We 
really went for the high-priced stuff, and the foam cost us about $40.00 
CDN to do but drivers and passengers seats.  But we were heading off for 
a 3 month driving trip, and we wanted to have comfy tushes for the 15,000 
miles the trip would take us.  And we felt like big shots.  ;)

Stop by a fabric store or any place you can get a sheet of heavy canvas.  
You'll need this.  If you had any broken springs in the seat bottom, go 
to a lumber yard and get a small piece of thin plywood as well.  If your 
seat cover were absolutely shot, order some replacement covers from one 
of those places in the back of VW mags.  Maybe someone on the list has a 
good source for these.  Oh, yeah, and pick up a couple of rolls of duct 
tape.

Go home, check the padding for fit.  Better too big than too small!  Take 
your canvas and use your patterns to cut the canvas into padding-shaped 
pieces, but make them a bit bigger than the padding. 

You're ready for re-assembly.  If you've got broken springs, place a pice 
of plywood  over that are of the seat frame.  Cut it fairly large, so it 
covers a good part of the seat.  Take your canvas, and duct tape it 
securely to the outer edge (frame) of the seat.  Leave some slack in it 
so that it won't tear of the edge when you sit in the seat.  Remember how 
the seat bows?  You need extra fabric to allow it to do that. Before 
moving on to the next seat part, put on the padding you had cut, and tape 
it down really securely.  Really securely--and allt the way around.  Tape 
doesn't want to stick to the foam, as you'll see, so make it secure and 
work fast.  Use the tape also to get rid of the lumpies around the 
edges.  Make your work neat.  Slip the cover on again to hold everything 
together.  You'll need someone to help you with this assembly part.  Work 
your way through all four seat cushions (2 on both seats).  Wrestle the 
cushions down enough to let you trap the little wire in the bottom of the 
covers with those metal tabs on the seat frame.  It may help to have a 
friend sit in the seats to load them when you try to do this.  Get all 
the tabs done up.

Sit in the seats and admire your work.  Big difference, right?  Go 
re-install the seats in your bus, and smile really wide as the 
countryside slides by.  

Happy camping!
