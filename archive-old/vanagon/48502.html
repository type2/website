Subject: Rear Hatch Screens Now Available (Was Re: New Item Available Posted 6-12)

Well, they're finally here and they're absolutely gorgeous.  The Vanagon
ones, that is (68-79 Camper/Bus ones are coming in late September, Early
October when the right material is received).

Just received the screens in Grey and Brown screens are due in another week
and a half.  Here's a repost of my original to the V_at_L last June:

P/N 230-85913 (VAG 231-069-602)   68-79 Models (Brown Only)  $69.95 (VAG No
Longer Available)
P/N 230-85914 (VAG 253-069-602)   80-87 Models (Brown)  $69.95 (VAG Price
$237.65)
P/N 230-85915 (VAG 255-070-412)   86-91 Models (Grey)  $69.95 (VAG Price
$167.40)

Note:  Vanagon Non-Westies had a screen available too. VAG 255-862-771
(Grey).  This has been superseded to the 255-070-412 above at VAG (Last
posted price on these was in the $250 range) .  Why the VAG price discrepancy
between Brown and Grey is beyond me - they're identical except for the color.
 Of course V_at_L and T2_at_P members get 10% OFF ($62.96).

I'm still off of both lists for awhile due to our warehouse move next door
and while this computer is being enormously used by our bookeeper for our
annual corporate tax numbers crunching, so please phone or fax your orders
in.  I know that quite a few Vanagonites expressed a genuine desire for these
screens, so they're here.

For those who own 68-79 models, hold off on your orders until I know for sure
when the exact due date will be.  You can express your serious intent to buy
- just E-Mail me direct.

I would have posted this last week, but I've been down with a very bad case
of STREP and confined to the bedroom :-(, so Bill's handling the action at
the office.  I should be back in the office later this week.

Cheers :-)
