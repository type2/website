Subject:       Boxster Engine design

Just saw my first Boxster last week...

Anyone know some details on the engine construction in this beast? I 
know it's a watercooled version of the flat six, but I'm just curious 
what Porsche has done to overcome the problems in the wasserboxer. 
Afterall, they did have something to do with the wasserboxer design, 
didn't they?
