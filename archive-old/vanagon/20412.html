On the subject of ventilation...

On my last excursion to West Virginia I tied hanging mosquito 
netting across the sliding door opening with magnets. This 
worked pretty well. The only problem was one night the mosquitos 
were aggressive and would work their way in. So I'm thinking of 
gluing Velcro around the door opening and sewing Velcro to the
netting. Has anyone else tried this?
