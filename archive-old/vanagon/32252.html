&gt;try the &quot;VW of America maintenance engineers.&quot;  They were so excellent that
&gt;I asked if they would give me the CDrom with the blueprints and they said
&gt;with a small smirk, &quot;Like hell!.&quot;  Well, I said, would you let me buy the
&gt;CDrom?  With a evil smile, he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked how much, and he
&gt;responded, &quot;Two-fifty.&quot; I said with approval, just add it to my bill.
&gt;Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from First Digital and it
&gt;was $2259.95.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for
&gt;two gaskets and about $2000.00 for a tranny.
&gt;As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;CDrom - $250.00.&quot;
&gt;Boy, was I upset!!  I called VWoA's Accounting Dept. and told them the
&gt;mechanic said it was &quot;two-fifty,&quot; and I did not realize he meant $250.00 
for a
&gt;CDrom.

Now that's more like it!   :^)
