Subject: Overheard in the ladies' room

My band was playing at this rather trendy nightclub, and the drummer's wife
overheard in the ladies' room two of the locals bemoaning the lack of
suitable prospects at the bar.  Said one, &quot;The guys in the band are kind of
cute.&quot;  Said the other, &quot;Yeah, but they probably drive VW busses.&quot;  Ouch.
