Subject: A 1776 for a 70 bus


Any experiences in using the 1776 motor in 71-earlier busses?  This seems 
to be the most common upgrade, power-wise.  SO, my questions:

1)  What mods. need to be made (better carb., external oil cooler, new 
case, etc.)?

2)  Is the 1776 the best for a bus?  I understand that it uses the stock 
69mm crank and 90.5 jugs; what about larger crank options and modified 
heads, i.e., the &quot;041&quot; or &quot;044.&quot;

3)  Driving Specs.:  Combination of city/highway driving and fairly 
rugged mountain-road driving.  I'd prefer to keep the tranny stock.  

THANKS!!
