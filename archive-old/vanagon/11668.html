Subject: HEaters -n- Heads

OK, I have a heater question (Surprise Surprise!)

My heads are leaking the the Blue liquid all over the place, but my heater 
(up front) always pumps out enough heat to get things toasty after about 15 
minutes of driving (Chicago driving) It's an '84 Vanagon Gl and the Heads 
and heater are probably unrelated, but I thought I 'd just advertise my 
ignornace



'84 Vanagon GL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perseverance my child....it's a Vanagon&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
