&gt;Got a bit of a shock last night: after a spirited jaunt down the hwy,

&gt;out.  I bumped up the idle by about 1/2 turn of the scre, and the
&gt;problem went away (it seemed to be idling too low)
&gt;
&gt;The engine was pretty warm; it didn't seem to be overheating, but it
&gt;was working.
&gt;
&gt;Should I be alarmed at all by this incident?

I'm pretty sure that VW in their owners manuals said some flickering of the
oil light was normal when you came to a stop after a long stretch of freeway
driving.  Sounds exactly like what you're reporting.  I think someone
mentioned last week that the oil is thinned somewhat by the higher temps.
associated with freeway driving.  This is okay when you're actually freeway
DRIVING, but when you come to a stop the oil is still thinned only now the
engine isn't turning fast enough to keep the pressure up.
