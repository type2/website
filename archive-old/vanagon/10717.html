&gt;i'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, by reversing the axles, that the balls
&gt;will move into new wear areas of the races ... and so maybe last longer
&gt;(instead of wearing the old paths even deeper). no basis in science or
&gt;history supports this claim, however.

I did this on my 911, on the advice of the shop I take it to.  That was
3 1/2 years ago - so far so good!
