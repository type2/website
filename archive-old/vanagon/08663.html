Subject: Re: Sodium Valves: Your Ticket to Fame and Fortu

&gt;I think I smell a new stat here for Joel.  All those with burnt #3 
&gt;exhaust valves sitting on your desk, stand up and be counted!

Err...., I also have a radiator and a bike wheel (and some juggling clubs 
and other junk) under the desk, a wall full of VW pictures, a row of model 
Beetles (made out of recycled platic bumpers) on the window sill and the 
bottom two drawers of my filing cabinet are full of old parts. I spend all 
my time reading mail on this list and one collegue spends all his time 
making models, in fact work seems to take a back seat to just about anything 
in our office.
