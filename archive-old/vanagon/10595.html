Subject: Re: puke yellow color


	Only one this list can I feel good about the tan with oxidized 
resprayed brown centre on my westy.  Unfortunetly, the respray of the 
lower tan has this weird salmon tinge to it.  Certainly though, on any 
other car, the colour would be important to me, but on a Volkswagen, it 
is the car that's important.  Thus I put the respray off till make some 
extra money and simply enjoy my westy.
	BTW, what is the official colour called that was on the late 60's 
and (perhaps) the early 70's that was a sort of grey tan?  That may be 
what my westy will wear in the future.
