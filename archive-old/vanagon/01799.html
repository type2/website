&gt; 115mph in my '90 Fox GL (two people, 5000+ RPM)
&gt; 145mph in a '92 Corrodo SLC (unladen, 5000+ RPM)
&gt;                              ^^^^^^^
&gt; 167mph in a Ferrari 308s (two people, on a race track, forget RPM)

Josh,

  These speeds are well above the cruising speeds of the *Planes*
I fly. The 145 number is AMAZING. Let's see some Asian *sedan* 
do that!

 I would be really p.o'd if I were flying IFR (I Follow Roads), and
I was passed underneath by a Corrado (Or even a ...FOX!)

&quot;...if she had a set of wings man I know she would fly..&quot;

Matthew

p.s. I guess now we know &quot;the airspeed velocity of an unladen Corrado&quot;

ppss Way to much Monty Python and Beach Boys as a teen..sorry.
