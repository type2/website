Subject: Trans for 83. Fix or replace.

I bought an 83 from a guy real cheap. He said transmission was blown. It 
wouldn't go. Had been crunching gears when shifting into 2nd and 3rd. It 
is an 091/1 4 speed. We pulled it out and guess what, the clutch was 
shattered. Easy fix. With new clutch we can go but still crunch gears.

Sooooo, do I shop around for a replacement 4 speed (or a 5 speed)?? Do I 
open this baby up and replace syncronizers? Any body done this before.

Your advice will be greatly appreciated. I do have a fair amount of 
normal auto tools and have repaired a TR6 manual trans once. Just 
currious how tough (and expensive) Vanagon trans are to repair.
