Subject: RE: unplug '86 idle stabilizer?
Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 20:12:42 -0500

I have had my idle stabilizer, 1987 2.1l, unplugged for about 4 months.  =
My VW dealer actually disconnected it, I have since added a switch to =
turn it on for cold starts.  The idle was at 2000 before it was =
disconnected, it ran at about 1000 for a while, now it's back up to =
2000.  When the idle stabilizer is connected it idles between 3000 and =
3500.  To get the RPM's down I now turn on the A/C.  I believe my =
problem might be related to the hole in my exhaust that I haven't fixed =
yet, I have the pipe, just not the bolts yet.  I hope the idle goes down =
when I fix the exhaust, do you think the exhaust is the problem?
