Subject: WTB: weekender rear seat

Subject says it all.

color, Condition of uphoulstery, and looks are unimportant.  Must
work.

Cheap is important, this is going in a van that was voted to be a big
beater by people who know ;)

Peace,

Steve

p.s will consider a westy type rear bed too.  anything so i dont have to
sleep on the floor next campout without giving up all the passenger
seating...
