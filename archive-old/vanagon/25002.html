&gt;  Is there a 1 Ton (or 2000lb) 200 lb tounge tow hitch available for a 1984
&gt; vanagon?
&gt; 
&gt; I have already checked out the Vanagon automatrix_dot_com web page's suggestions
&gt; and only found a 1500-150 lb tow hitch.  Which would not be enough to tow my
&gt; beetles.

There is a mechanic in NY, who custom builds hitches for vanagons.
His name is Dennis and number (evenings and weekends) is 516-563-8248.
Derek Drew posted info on this about half a year ago. I got all the
hitch threads on this list saved, so if you want it drop me a line.
You can also look it up yourself in the list archives.

I just installed one of these hitches this weekend. It is a 2&quot; receiver
style. Mounts with six bolts to frame. Replaces standard bumper mounts,
and bumper remounts to hitch assembly instead. The hitch sticks out
a little bit in the back, and is not as inconspicous as some other
receiver style hitches I've seen. The receiver is placed low, just
10&quot; off the ground.

I'm happy with mine, and plan to use it for one of those &quot;basket&quot; things
(wheelless trailer). My only problems were: The fit was so-so, so what
should have been a 30min swap (the 6 bolts to the frame+four for the bumper)
took me a good 3h of wrestling, first with the aid of so + breaker bar, 
later so + hydraulic jack to bend the hitch parts so they fit. (The misfit was
only a couple of mm, but it's not easy to change the shape of steel of this
dimension.

PS: Anyone know of other places than Camping WOrld for those basket things?
(I'd like the simple platform one, not the enclosed plastic box style)
