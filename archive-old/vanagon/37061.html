Subject: RE: MIG Welder Advice Needed

Hi,

Another consideration on MIG melders is scan the ads.  A few years ago 
when I was in the markert for a MIG, I was very close to buying a new 
low-end Lincoln unit when an older Miller Sidekick appeared in the 
paper.  It's pretty good sized compared to its newer counterparts, but it 
had seen very little use and was priced very reasonable.  It had all the 
accessories I needed and the PO even gave me a MIG welding lesson.  Since 
then I've been through 2 spools of wire and a tank of Co2.  It pays to 
look around, but act fast on the ads as they go quickly!  8-)
