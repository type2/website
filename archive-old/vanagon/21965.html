Subject:      Air conditioning?



I followed up on that AC evaporator that was put on. Apparently the evaporator
this guy had was a VW approved item to be used with AC. He said that that
usaully the bus AC was located above the driver (is this right?) but this was
designed for campers that could not locate above and is for under the dash.
This is not a swamp box but for use with AC compressor. So what is the reality
for putting a compressor on an upright engine? Seems to me this sucker has a
tough enough time going up those itty bitty hills without a compressor. Thisk
I saw a post once that said comprssors take about 5 hp off. What say. Is this
forbidden fruit?
