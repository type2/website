&gt;  Jonathan described the first trip in &quot;The Whale,&quot; a '76
&gt;  Bus, with a 2000cc FI engine.  Sounds like it was a good
&gt;  road trip, even with the starter problem.  Averaged 72
&gt;  MPH?  Whoa!  What was your top speed, and how long were
&gt;  you able to sustain that speed?

It was Randy, not Jonathan :-).

My top speed was around 85mph (downhill!), but only for a
minute or so.  Honestly it ran fine at this speed, except
for being pretty &quot;light&quot; in the steering.  But I just get
too nervous pushing the engine that hard for any period of
time so I had to back off to the low 70's.

Note that the road was straight and level and there was no
wind!  Coming off of some mountains there was a winding,
windy road with a steep downgrade and I couldn't go any
faster than 50 without having a heart attack.

Besides the starter problem I also found that the gear shift
started buzzing at highway speeds, and now there is
something wrong with my cold starts... but once it's warmed
up it runs great.
