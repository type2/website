I hauled my sick '74 camper from California to the Rockville, MD area this 
past July.  I was fortunate to have found and I have received excellent 
service from Auto Centro in Rockville, MD.

Labor is ~$50/hr.  However, they are factory certified and know how to 
search for those not -so-common parts.
