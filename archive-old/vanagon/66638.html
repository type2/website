Subject:      Removing interior side trim in the luggage bay

I have tried to find the appropriate directions to do this in Bentley but have
been unsuccessful.  How does one go about removing the side panel trims (the
PO had attached a couple of brackets to the trim panel using stove bolts and
nuts which I want to remove)?  Bentley seems to hint that the rear headliner
should be removed first, but I don't know if this is necessary.

On a related issue, will this give me access to the rear light markers from
the inside.  I have a problem in that the passenger side the plastic tabs into
which the marker is screwed into, are spinning in place.  I haven't
successfully been able to get the marker off to replace the burnt out bulb.
(And yes I have done this on the driver's side so that I know that you have to
pull at the marker to maintain pressure on the plastic tab as you are
unscrewing ;-)).

I'd be most grateful if someone who is familiar with the procedure could walk
me through the steps.

advTHANKSance.

Cheers,
- pavneet
