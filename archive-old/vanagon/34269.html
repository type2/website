Subject: Frozen in Time

	The NOVA program about the Kee Bird, the B-29
in Greenland, was broadcast on 'first run' PBS channels
last night. The smaller PBS channels, (KTEH-54 in the
Bay Area for example) will be showing the same program
later this week/early next week. So check your TV 
directory or the little flier the PBS channel sends you
every month. What? Don't get one? Send 'em a check :)

	This show is marvelous, heartrending and very
much made to appeal to people who irrationally keep
old cars alive. I felt a real pang watching them
re-installing the elevators, banging on things and
reaching into dark, remote places to adjust stuff
that they would only really understand after it worked.

	I didn't see any work on the reduction boxes, (missed
first 15 min) but the scene of them assembling a propellor
is Very Familiar Looking. Parts dropped, picked up and cleaned
again, and the exhaltation of getting it together RIGHT!

	The tragidy that overtook Kee Bird involved the Auxillary :)
Power Unit (APU) mounted in the rear fuselage. Either the APU (a 
small gasoline engine) or its fuel tank broke loose once the craft
was moving, and fell, mixing gasoline and hot engine parts. The resulting
fire spread forward into the central gunner's station, up the tunnel
that leads through the bomb-bay and into the cockpit. Although the
airplane is metal, there's a lot of flamable stuff like cloth liners
and insuation in the crew compartments and it all burned. The aluminum
structure of the airplane was melted in some places but didn't burn. 
The wing fuel tanks did not catch fire, and the new motors and propellors
survived, hanging sadly over the burned-out hulk of the fuselage.

	Several lessons here: 

	Be SURE stuff involving gasoline is all nice and strong and it 
good shape. These guys worked on the plane for a long time, maybe they 
checked the APU mounts, maybe not...

	Keep a good eye on ALL possible sources of fire, not just
the obvious ones. In the film, you can see someone watching the big
engines as they are started. Clearly, no-one was in the back, watching
Kee Bird's APU. It would have been an extra person on the plane and all
that, and it probably made sense beforehand to not watch it. I wonder
why, though, they left it running once the other engines were going. 

	Notice the Roaring Inferno inside the metal airplane? The
metal isn't burning but all the upholstry, etc. is. We have metal
firewalls in our busses, but a big enough engine fire will light
the seats, and an electrical fire can happen anywhere there are wires.

	Didn't they have a Fire Extinguisher? Yes, mounted on the
bulkhead back next to the APU. I'm not making this up- I saw the 
Confederate Air Force's &quot;Fifi&quot; this summer and the big extinguisher
is back right next to the APU. In the film someone mentions that they
had their extinguisher there too.

	Lets not loose any busses this way, ok? If you've only
got one extinguisher, don't keep it in the engine comparment. Do
keep an eye on EVERYTHING when you get that old treasure back
under power for the first time in 1-5-15-20-25 years. Make sure
everything involving fuel is tight and in good shape BEFORE you
try running it.

	Bob Hoover didn't specify how many carbs the 3350 had- one, 
three? Bob?
