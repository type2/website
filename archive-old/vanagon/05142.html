&gt;2. The wiper fluid pump no longer works.  I saw yesterday that
&gt;    it might be possible to check if it's frozen or does this just
&gt;   apply to the water (sink) pumps?  Also, where is and how do I
&gt;   get to it.

&gt;Look under front of van just infront of driver's door. the resevoir is right
&gt;there, held in by 2 (I think) bolts/screws. Removing them allows the tank
&gt;to fall down and lets you get at the pump which if I remember correctly is
&gt;attached to the outside of the tank.

also check to see if the plastic tubing going up to the squirter nozzles has
not become crimped and closed off. that happened to my 88. you can tell cause
when you run the squirter, the fluid runs out on the ground.

it's kind of a mess to follow that tubing, too. you'll have to take the
grill off for part of it (i think).
