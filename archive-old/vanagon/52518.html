hi all 

jonce here, ive just signed up to this mailing and i also belong to others.
ive been trying to read and understand all of the different questions before
posting my own.  to reply to a few 

hal and every one else i live in MI and i own 5 vws spanning from 56 to 92
and i hear alot about shops and quality of parts from local suppliers no.1
on the s**t list has always come up is the parts place. ive had many friend
that have tried to purchase something from them and had a bunch of problems.
now im talking about the used stuff. as far as new goes you get what you pay
for. just compare prices and make the purchase.

jay if you want the german fabric that is fine but it will be hard to obtain
and will be exxpensive. if available at all. than unles you have a
commercial sewing machine and some time and experiance your best bet may be
to order the new seat covers and install them your self or have them
installed. just to let you know a burn in your upholstery will run about
75-125 to repair and thats just for one seat and if its a removable panel of
fabric. if your looking for the cheapest way to make it look its best. call
around to your local upholstery and trim shops and see if you can get a slip
on style seat cover in a compatible fabric and enjoy your van. you may even
look into custom made mail order seat covers that are pre-made. the dealer
will be expense and so will a reputable uph. shop.

hows everybody like day 4 of turkey leftovers?
