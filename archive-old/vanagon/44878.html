&gt;When you want to make a 90 degree turn and do it fast in an aircooled VW,
&gt;you twitch the wheel hard left (or right) and accelerate.  You turn the
&gt;wheel in the direction of the slide and find yourself going 90 degrees to
&gt;your previous direction.  My direction of choice was a left turn because
&gt;even at 22 years old I knew it was better to have the passenger side
&gt;between me and what I might hit than the driver's door.


When I was a &quot;kid&quot; driving my dad's 79 bus, there was this neato
left-hand hairpin turn I had to drive nearly every day...  It was a
very hard left hand turn at an intersection where the turning traffic
always had the right-of-way.  I kinda liked that setup! :-) :-)

I often wondered what people thought about a bright orange bus
barreling into this intersection with the left turn signal on and
no brake lights showing...
