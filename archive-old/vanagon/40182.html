Subject: The Matty J  &amp; Suz epic trip update!!!

Greetings to our fellow type II's ( that's thread bait if I've ever seen
some!) 

Suz &amp; I just finished reading the archives and enjoying the stories of our
trip so far! We hope Marlin has recovered from his Moose-juice hangover.
Turns out Marlin was born just 4 days after me, so no wonder we clicked!
G'day to Lucille and Barbara as well! 

We tried to contact Jim Arnott in Union Oregon, but just got their answering
machine. No doubt they were out playing with their bus!!

It was cool to finally meet Tobin and Christa in Vancouver! What an awesome
couple in a beautiful city. We loved Vancouver BC (almost as much as
Stockton), even though we only saw the sun once while there!

We'll give a more detailed account of our trip later on. Currently, we are
Southbound Again (to quote an Allmann Bros. song),  staying at Wolf Haven
outside of  Olympia, Washington. This is a sanctuary for wolves that have no
where else to go- or as our host Tom McMahon says..&quot;it's an eclectic home for
wayward wolves!&quot; They have a breeding program for Mexican Wolves, and house
coyotes and arctic foxes. 

Now to our hosts here at Wolf Haven: When our clutch cable broke, Tom McMahon
was the first car we saw. He tried to help, but told us to wait for 10
minutes, as his friend and co-worker Michael Wyatt would be along, himself an
expert in VW repair. Not only did he  help us get the part we needed, he lay
under our bus for an extended period,  installing the new cable for us. As
you can guess, we went out to dinner, drank copious amounts of alcohol, and
got a backstage tour of Wolf Haven. We even did a midnight howl with the
 wolves! We stayed the night in their WARM (read not wet like outside) house,
and were on our way the next day, after some sad goodbyes!

Well, we're here again, drank even more last night with them while playing
Trivial Pursuit, and are feeling the after effects today! By the way, we're
not chronic pissheads-we just have a lot to celebrate! Anyway, if you are
ever in the Olympia/Tumwater area, stop by Wolf Haven and ask for Tom or
Michael and say Hi! They're totally VW people without owning any!!!

At the moment, we're trying to coax them into going to Olympic National Park
with us. We should be near the Bay area in the next 2 weeks, so hopefully
Martha has something going to get us all together-we can't wait to meet all
of you!! So far, we've been so blessed in the people we are meeting and the
adventures we are having. We may never go home (which incidentally is NOT
AUSTRALIA!)
 
To Matthew Henricks, we don't have your phone number, so if you could e-mail
that to Steve Johnson, we'll look you up!

To Steve Johnson,  Lost Coast was it?

Martha, We're still looking for those portable showers etc for ya!!!

I guess that's all for now. We're off to catch dinner (why DID we bring a
camp stove?)!

Hope to see you in our travels! Till then.....

Love, 

Matty J &amp; SUZ!!!
