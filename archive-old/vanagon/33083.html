Hey, what about calling attention to one's self by telling the list what a
stupid thing one did?  Like:

I once borrowed one of those torque wrenches that clicks when you get to
the proper torque (I actually even OWN one now, but I check it against my
old needle-type wrench) to rebuild my 67 engine over the weekend.  The
thing was way out of adjustment, and the torques all came out too light.  I
remember thinking it didn't feel right, but figured it was due to the
longer handle.  Well... Monday I'm driving home from work, it had gotten
over 100 degrees that day, and ALL the bearings started knocking!  I
couldn't take more than one day off work, so I did the whole thing over on
Tuesday between 7am and 7pm.  (I was pretty proud of that, especially after
having been such an idiot, until I saw one of those engine-pull contests at
a VW meet.  SHEEEZZ!).
