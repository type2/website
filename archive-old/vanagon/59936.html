I routinely post any Syncro advertisement I find, Westie or Regular, at
my
site.My sources are the list, classified ads on the Web, as well as many
that
are sent directly to me by e-mail. Right now there are about twenty-five
of them, starting at $2500 and going up to $24,000, so there is
something for everyone.
