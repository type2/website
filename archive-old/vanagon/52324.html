Subject: Ground strap on air flow sensor

&gt;From the gopher concerning the Digifant-Diagnosis-Checks:

&gt; 6)  Connect a ground from the metal part of the air box to the
&gt;     empty 6mm ground connection point on the right cylinder head.
&gt; 

This appears to be a VW afterthought.  They suggest this in addition to
the harness.  For those of you who haven't spent the $100+ on the
harness, the directions for adding a $.50 capacitor are also in this
file which works (apparently) just as well.

How to to make the connection on the air box?  What guage ground wire?
