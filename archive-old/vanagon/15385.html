The problem here sounds like the regulator, but first check the
generator. This should read anywhere between 40 and 60 volts
depending on the rpm. If this is ok then check the regulator
for loose wires. The next stage is to measure the voltage coming
out of the regulator and should be approx 14.5v. Don't measure this
with the battery connected as this will give a false reading.
If the voltage is ok then start looking towards the loom!

If the generator is the problem, it is possible to remove it without
taking the engine out. Undo everything to do with the fanhousing
and the generator strap. Undo the bolts/screws holding the fan
tinware on (a fiddly bit..) and lift the fan and generator as much as 
possible. The complete fan/generator assembly should then pull out 
with a bit of effort. If you have the removable cover on the top of
the engine bay then its a piece of cake to do this.

Assembly is the reverse of disassembly with the exception of the 
following :

		It takes about twice as long!

Hope this is of some help....
