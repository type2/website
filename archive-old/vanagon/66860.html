Subject:      Re: Westy for sale in Ottawa

Ron, and whoever else is interested.  '84 Vanagon Westy forsale in Ottawa.
Motor problem, may be leaking head gaskets, I'm not sure.  Green and in
excellent condition throughout I'm told.  Never been in the salt of the
north.  Call 613-235-4455.  I do not know more as I saw this add in a
local paper and made one call to find out what I have posted so far.
No price given, their looking for offers. Call 'em up and make a deal !

Cheers

Frank
