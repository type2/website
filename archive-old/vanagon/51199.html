&gt; &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's a way to test the coolant for contaminents?  I'm
&gt;getting
&gt; &gt;ready to do a coolant change and I'd like to get the existing fluid tested to
&gt; &gt;see if there's major chunks of engine/radiator/hoses floating around in
&gt; &gt;there...
&gt;
&gt; there are analysis labs that do oil analysis and coolant analysis. cost is
&gt;about $15-20 per analysis. also, some local parts places (FLAPS: friendly
&gt;local auto parts stores) sell litmus strips for coolant testing. i can send
&gt;the names of some of the analysis places if you want.

I recently bought the fuid test kit for this test from NAPA for about $35.  It
came with a bottle of the blue fluid, the test tube, and a bulb to suck the 
vapors through the fluid.  I figured it was a real bargain, since I needed
to do this test anyway on a Ford Taurus, and I have two of these waterboxers,
so I'm sure I'll use it in the near future...
