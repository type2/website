    Unplug The O2 sensor. If still on start, check the wiring from
    the computer to the Temp. sensor.

&gt; Well... from what you've said, it sounds like you're getting gas okay.
&gt; 
&gt; First, Check that your throttle valve is adjusted correctly.  Have someone
&gt; press the pedal and make sure it is opening.  
&gt; 
&gt; Next, check to see that your getting spark from the plugs and go backwards
&gt; from there.  Check the wires, distributor, rotor, cap, coil.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're getting spark, then check that you're getting enough air by
&gt; removing the air snorkel from the air distributor and see if it will
&gt; start.  If it starts, then you know you have a problem with air delivery,
&gt; so check all of those components out.
&gt; 
&gt; If it still doesn't start then I would check the oxygen sensor, coolant
&gt; temp sensor, idle stabilizer and all the electrical connections inbetween.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing to check is the catalytic converter.  See if it is clogged.
&gt; This may not allow the system to breath properly.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck!
