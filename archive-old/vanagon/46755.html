Subject: starting anomily


When starting my bus ('66) after it has been sitting for a while, it
occasionally takes several engine turns to start (like about 5 or 7).

When I drive, gas up, continue driving, it will start on the first engine
turn.

A friend indicated that it could be that the carb is leaking gas, and a few
engine revolutions are required to purge the flooded engine after it has sat
for a while.  

Does this sound likely?  Any other ideas?

Thanks,
...Markus
