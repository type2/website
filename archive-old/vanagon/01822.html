yeah, the bago model is a big one, but i'm not sure that bago did the
stretching. the story i heard was that vw was shipping the long wheel base
T4 to bago, and the camper stuff was just added onto the rear of what is
basically a frame with a cab on it.

&gt;Does anyone know why VW didn't just have Westphalia do the camper
&gt;thing, like they always have?... (instead of just the pop-top)

supposedly that's what the vw version is: just like the old westfalia
campers. but the picture i saw had a middle single seat as standard ...
so it looks like you could seat five inside. (don't know what you do with
the middle seat when you want to use the sink/fridge/stove). leave it out
in the rain?
