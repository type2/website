&gt; The Van is safe at home now, after a tow.
&gt; Any ideas?  I havent checked into it as its dark now, but I plan to test
&gt; the thermostat.  Does that sound like the problem?  Obviously, the
&gt; pressure had built up.  Perhaps a clogged radiator?  I need Advice!
&gt; Does anyone know whether the reservoir is the same out of a gas vanagon?
&gt; Thanks in advance.

As proud owner of another Westy Diesel, it sounds as if you've blown a 
head gasket from the original overheating incident, and in the process, 
compression and combustion gasses are leaking into the cooling jacket, 
pushing the cooling water away from the metal even more, while sending 
the coolant pressure sky-high.  'Never had it happen on the Westy, but 
have owned a couple of Rabbit and Dasher Diesels that have been 
unortunate enough to suffer your same symptoms.  Sorry!, and good luck 
with the fix.  You'll probably have to pull and repair and/or replace 
the head and gasket.
