&gt;I use Castrol 20w-50 exclusively in the late spring, summer and early fall.
&gt;I prefer the extra protection during the hot months.  I use any cheap brand

&gt;Haven't had any trouble for 78K miles.

&gt;I know Dennis H. is gonna have something to say about this...... :)

Yes I do! See previous post.  My only real question, why use cheap stuff at
all?  Different Oil companies use different additive packages.  When a
decision is made as to what brand of oil you will use, you should stay with
it.   Although all SAE rated oils must be compatible(?), the different
additives on a regular basis can cause deposit build ups (sludge, varnish,
Ash etc) that can shorten the life of an engine. 20-50 is my choice for VW
engines also.  That is why i do not use Casrol Syntec.  I tried the 5-50 in
wifes rabbit. Although I observed no problems, the lower oil pressure told me
I was getting less protection.  I know this is not completely true but the
wife's goal is 250K on that engine.  We now have about 12K to go.  By the
way, for all you Diesel junkies,  I use Castrol Super Fleet. Goes to much
higher CD ratings than Gas engine oils including the synthetics.  Outstanding
product.
