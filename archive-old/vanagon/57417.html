Subject: DOT5 fluid (Was: 68-79 rear brake parts info)

&gt; After all the work you go through painting your backing plates, replacing
&gt; wheel cylinders etc., you might want to take Bob Hoover's advice and switch
&gt; to DOT 5 brake fluid.  Apparently the DOT 5 doesn't contain the paint eating
&gt; Methyl methanol that your typical brake fluid has.
&gt; 

If Hoover reccs silicone fluid, he could be DEAD wrong.  Something 
I've found finally working as a &quot;rocket scientist&quot; is that some 
O-ring and seal formulations work with silicone based fluids, others 
work with glycols.  Sometimes they work with both, sometimes 
they do not and you DIE.  Just because OEM German might have been OK 
does not mean neccesarily that that Brazilian seal is up to it after 
a couple of years.  Just a thought, use quality DOT4, and bleed 
regularly, change every 2, that is what VW recced, or be very sure 
you can use the silicone, which is a great choice for &quot;collector 
vehicles&quot; driven infrequently as it is not hygroscopic (sp?).   A 
little thing people need to know, and don't use DOT5 in ABS equipped 
cars in case you own something besides Buses.  I know some swear by 
DOT5, I always thought the rumors of problems were BS as the military 
switches the 4 out to 5 when they buy vehicles, but I gaurantee you 
it may really be a problem and brakes are something you do not fuck 
around with.  If you don't believe me look in the compatibility 
section of any major O-ring manufacturer catalog (Parker, Apple, 
etc.)
