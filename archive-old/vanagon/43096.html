a couple
very early jesus handles

do you have to pray to open the door?

but seriously, what do you mean by this?

 Briefly checked out the car show; only 1 bus there that even got my
attention: a 1955 fire truck.  It was barndoor in the front end, with a
later back end (factory, not hacked),
- - - - - --

do you mean by this that it has a smaller engine lid, and a big back hatch?
  or the suspension is different.    BD firetrucks  have piano hinges on the
deck lid and hatch in the back. 

sounds like you had fun
