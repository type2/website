Subject: Re: Warm air from under dash.

&gt; My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is a
&gt; noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the dash.
&gt; I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of the heater
&gt; controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in mid
&gt; summer.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a common problem? What's the diagnosis and what's the fix?

I believe there is some insulation to shield the heat from the rad. 
fan - possibly this has come loose, or been removed. Or, more likely, 
the flow control valve for the front heater core is out of 
adjustment, so that it does not stop flow completey.
