&gt;where should I locate the sender?

The best place I've found for accuracy is the oil sump plate just below the
oil filler on the Type 4 style engines.  Having owned a '73 and currently an
'80 Vanagon I find that VDO provides an excellent diagram in the instructions
included with the sneder for this location (VDO-323888, $14.95).  Note that
there are two (2) oil sump plates on this engine type - one in the center
with a single cap nut holding it on, the other located just below the filler
with two (2) 6mm bolts (10mm hex) holding it in place(This is the plate to
mount the sender).  Just pull the plate the next time ya have to change the
oil, drill the hole specified in the instruction sheet, mount the sender,
then re-mount the plate.  Connect to the gauge, refill the case with oil and
you're on yer way.

The only alternative to mounting the gauge in dash is to purchase a gauge
mounting cup and mount it on top of the dash like I've done in my Vanagon.
 VDO's mounting cup is quite pricey in my opinion, so check around the FLAPS
for an alternative.  Another alternative is to remove the blank plate from
the gauge hole to the right of the speedo and drill that out, mount the gauge
and re-install.  They do not make a 3 1/8&quot; diameter oil temp gauge to
completely fill the spot, bummer.
