Subject: Re: drum brake adjustment

......brushed it with a wire brush.. It won't budge. I thought that maybe
for this one we could try to take the 46mm nut off. Forget it. This
thing is not moving until it rots and falls off. Well, the tools I have
won't get it off anyway. I got a 46mm socket but have to use a converter
and the point of pressure end up too far away from the wheel perpendicularly.
I don't have a torch to heat it up. Can anyone suggest another method?

you can get these poundy things- its a piece of d*mn sturdy flat metal about
1/2 thick that had a place for the big nut, and a place to hit it, you take a
big hammer and pound the nut  off.  works a treat.  they  come in 36mm and
46mm sizes.   I've seem them for sale at vw shops for ~$5, and well worth it.
  just make sure the wheels are on the ground and the parking brakes on.
  actually, this could also be used to free stuck rear wheels too.

my two cents
