&gt; On this subject, has anyone noticed, generally, if your air-cooled runs
&gt; cooler in rainy (although not necessarily cooler) weather?  Perhaps a Rube
&gt; Goldberg solution for overheating during extreme heat is to rig up a
&gt; 5-gallon water bottle, a 12v electric pump, some hoses, and an atomizing
&gt; nozzle.  Mount the nozzle near the fan intake, and voila! 

Believe it or not, I have considered this.  Although what I was thinking
of doing was slightly different, since I have only had trouble with high
oil temperature, not CHT.  I was thinking of mounting one or two of
those windshield squirters on the engine tin of my type IV, so that
the nozzle(s) pointed down directly over the oil cooler.  One would
only have to drill a couple of small holes through the tin directly
over the cooler.  A windshield washer reservoir in the engine
compartment and a momentary switch mounted up front would complete
the system.  Should be a few dollars worth of junkyard parts and a
couple of hours to install.  I still may try this some day, but lately
the bus hasn't been running as hot (ever since GNATT - the Italian
tuneup must have worked!).  I don't like the idea of getting cold water
on the cylinders when they are working hard - couldn't possibly be good
for the engine, but a couple of squirts of water on the oil cooler while
going up a grade could be just the ticket for acceptable oil temps
without an external cooler.
