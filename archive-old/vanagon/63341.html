Subject:      1984 Vanagon &quot;Adventure Wagon&quot; what is it?

I saw an ad for this in the local paper.  Has anyone heard of this =
particular type of conversion?  If so, what type is it?  Sink, stove, =
fridge, pop top, etc.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  By the =
way, I'm new to the list and the Vanagon.  I took one on a test drive =
about two weeks ago and I'm hooked.
