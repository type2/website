&gt; Well after taking everyone's advice I was able to get the fridge to light.  
&gt; It took about 30 minutes of pumping and sparking to get it to light.  During 
&gt; the course of all of it there were a 3 flare ups through the flue ( kinda 
&gt; like backfires or when you leave the lid down on your gas grill when you are 
&gt; trying to light it, not quite as big though). 
&gt; 
&gt;  I was just about to give up trying for the night when I looked down and saw 
&gt; a little blue flame  in the window of the fridge!  Let it burn for a few 
&gt; minutes and turned it off and tried again.  This time it lit after just a 
&gt; few pumps and sparks.  The flow meter moved all the way to the green!  
&gt; 
&gt; I had run the fridge for a day and a half off 110V to test to see if it 
&gt; could cool.  When I got home last night frost had formed on the cooling fins 
&gt; inside as well as some ice in a container of water I had put in there.
&gt; 
&gt; The only question remaining is whether to drive with the LP running the 
&gt; fridge or to run it off of 12V.  If it takes much effort to light the fridge 
&gt; once you get some where then all the cold escapes while you are trying to 
&gt; light the thing !
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again....
&gt;

I was not aware that some of the fridge ignition systems had a three way
LED set up. Mine glows red only if the fridge is working on LP, there is
no green....DC
