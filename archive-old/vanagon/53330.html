Subject: Re: Moving to SLC, Utah

I love the billboard when you cross the Colorado border into Utah.

It's a beautiful full color one that is supposed to say &quot;Utah; still the right
place to be.&quot; or something like that.

Every year they fix it and someone just repaints it over to read:  &quot;Utah; still
the right (wing) place to be.&quot;

They have some crazy liquor laws.  And I'm from a dry county in NC.

It is a beautiful place.  Be sure and go up to Little Cottonwood Canyon. Maple
Canyon is fascinating, also.  I've never seen cliffs like that anywhere on
earth.  It must be a geologic freak phenomenon (sp?).  It looks like someone
took millions of polished, round river rocks and just pasted them to the sides
of these overhanging cliff walls.  Fascinating.

Don't even get me started about the skiing.

You will have a great time living there.  There's so much to play on.  How
would you ever get any work done?

Take care and best of luck!
