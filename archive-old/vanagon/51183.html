 &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's a way to test the coolant for contaminents?  I'm
getting
 &gt;ready to do a coolant change and I'd like to get the existing fluid tested to
 &gt;see if there's major chunks of engine/radiator/hoses floating around in
 &gt;there...

 there are analysis labs that do oil analysis and coolant analysis. cost is
about $15-20 per analysis. also, some local parts places (FLAPS: friendly
local auto parts stores) sell litmus strips for coolant testing. i can send
the names of some of the analysis places if you want.

 &gt;&gt; The names of the analysis places would be a big help.  Even here in
Seattle it's hard to find a FLAPS that employs really knowledable people &lt;&lt;&lt;

 &gt;Would an electronic ignition set up smooth out the idle?  I wonder what
system
 &gt;would work the best?  I had a Perlux ignitor in my '67 for a while and it
 &gt;worked great...

 you already have an electronic ignition. the only things you need to replace
are the distributor cap and rotor. my bet is that the surging/searching idle
is a result of the coolant temp sensor gone bad ($15) or the O2 sensor gone
dead or dying (about $60-80 from other-than-vw dealers). my guess would be
 the coolant temp sensor ... that's what it always is on my 88.

 &gt;&gt; Would the coolant temp sensor be the cause of the flashing red light on
the temp guage?  I'm sure it's an electrical problem because sometimes it does
it on startup, sometimes it doesn't.  It'll go for weeks with only the
obligatory flashing when you first turn the key, then it'll go dark.  Other
times it'll do the startup flashing, go dark for a moment, then start flashing
again.  The temp needle does not rise and I can usually make it stop by
switching everything off and restarting.  Coolant Temp Sensor, OK, I'll add
that to my shopping list...

 &gt; The tires (Goodyear Arriva P185/70R14) are getting pretty thin.  I'd like
 &gt;tires that fill the wells a little more on a stock 14&quot; VW steel wheel.  Maybe
 &gt;Michelins...

 yeah, i'm in the market for tires right now, too. not having much luck
 finding anything in stock. :( the thing is, you want to make SURE you get
tires that can support the load of the bus and its cargo ... which means
 at least 1500 lbs max load per tire. this puts you close to the Light Truck
category. most places have tried to sell me some crappy passenger car tires
that are 100 lbs LESS than what i have now! (Michelin XZX reinforced side-
walls. which, of course, aren't made anymore. :( so they tell me).

 &gt;&gt; A buddy of mine runs Michelin XZX's on his '66 Westfalia, swears by 'em.
BUT an early Westy is a flyweight compared to a Vanagon.  The archives are
full of tire advice (as I discovered last night) but it seems to be an issue
of particular importance to the alloy wheel crowd.&lt;&lt;

 &gt; This shifter seems sort of stiff, but then this Vanagon has 129k on the
 &gt;clock.  I rebuilt the shift linkage on my '67 Bus and it shifts nicely now.
 &gt;But I'll bet it's a little more complicated on this rig.  I wonder what parts
 &gt;I'd have to replace to shorten the throws and take the mystery out of this
 &gt;pattern...

 Gene Berg sells a short-shift kit for the vanagon. $20. WELL worth the money!
i've had it now on three buses and love it. but be SURE to follow the
directions about marking the position of the base plate BEFORE you start
loosening it!! :) last time, i figured i was too smart to need to do that ...
took me two weeks to &quot;adjust&quot; it back to where it should have been. :(

 &gt;&gt; We'll go this route.  Seldom is heard a discouraging word about Berg
stuff.  I chopped up my credit cards last week (never marry an accountant) so
I hope they do UPS C.O.D...&lt;&lt;

 &gt; How come the left turn signal ticks normally and the right turn signal ticks
 &gt;about twice as fast?  Is a bulb burned out somewhere?

 yup. your right side bulb is burned out. either front or rear.

 &gt;&gt; Now that it's dark damn near all the time it should be easy to spot...&lt;&lt;

 &gt; I wonder when that Bentley manual I ordered from Mr. Salmon is gonna get
 &gt;here...

 next week. Wednesday. after it starts raining. :(

 &gt;&gt; That forecast has been modified to Sunday.  I've got to take my brother's
'79 VW convertible and run the hell out of it at some point this weekend.  I'm
hoping to find the break between the FOG and RAIN modes.  His car sat in a
garage for SIX years and now that he wants to sell it, the #2 cylinder is
low...&lt;&lt;

 &gt; Sometimes the digital clock works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I wonder how hard
 &gt;it would be to replace...

 not too hard, but EXPEN$IVE! :( but you can take it out and clean it up and
that usually helps. remove the dash pod: pull the cover off (have you figured
that part out yet? you'll need to learn it to check the brake fluid)

 &gt;&gt; The mechanic I hired to look over the Vanagon popped the top off the
instrument pod to look things over and the seller damn near died.  Having been
around VW's for 20+ years nothing surprises me anymore, but the seller was a
&quot;take it back to the dealer&quot; man when it came to maintenance.&lt;&lt;


 , and disconnect the switches from the pod base (each switch has a press-clip
that you squeeze and pull the switch out. do NOT disconnect the wires from the
switches!), then undo the four hold-down screws. then undo the connector
 from the printed circuit &quot;foil&quot; ... be careful with this foil: it'll crimp
easily. :( then you have to disconnect the little lights ... twist/rotate
 them 90 degrees and they pull out. THEN you can get to the two screws
 holding the clock in!! :)  yeah, it's involved, but not difficult.

 and when you get it all put back together, do NOT tighten the hold-down
 screws too tight ... it'll crack the pod base plastic. :(

 good luck. joel &lt;&lt;

 &gt;&gt; Joel, you are a wealth of information and I thank you for your time and
expertise.  I am confident that application of your suggestions will result in
many years of happy motoring for me and my '86 Vanagon GL.  If I can be of
service (areas of expertise include 1950 - 67 Type 2, Coleman camping gear,
WWII and the Japanese assualt on the US mainland) drop me a line.
