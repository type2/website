So Marcus Doherr says:
&gt; 
&gt; Here are two ad's that I saw in yesterdays newspapers,
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Something to think about:
&gt; 
&gt; 69' VW Westfalia Camper
&gt; good condition inand out,
&gt; excellent mechanical cond-
&gt; dition. $ 2300.
&gt; (707) 446 7812
&gt; 

Unless it's in immaculate condition, I'd consider this a bit steep
too.
