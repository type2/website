I just bought a set of four for $200. Good deal for me, but even at $650
they're a great deal. Check out what parts place wants for a set!

&gt; &lt;&lt; I just got another set of VW Vanagon alloy wheels for sale.  If anyone
is
&gt;  interested let me know.  The price is $650 plus shipping for a set of
four
&gt;  which includes the small hub caps in the center and the special lugs and
&gt;  nuts. the wheels are located in Los Angeles but UPS can ship anywhere
and I
&gt;  can deliver them to San Francisco
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; for that price, you should throw in the 5th one (the spare)....
&gt; don't you think?
