Subject: '90 distributor cap

Hi Everyone.  Well, today I was giving the engine compartment some 
cleaning... long overdue from the dirt road we took back in the fall. 
I cleaned out the dirt trap (Syncro) in the air intake as it was full 
of dust with the consistency of flour.  I washed out the trap, and 
snorkel assembly, and put 303 Protectant on the rubber seal.  With 
the engine nice and clean I decided to check the distributor cap and 
rotor.

I pulled off the plastic bag from the distributor, and it promptly 
started to disintegrate.  Gotta get a new one, I guess!  Anyway, the 
rotor wasn't bad, but the distributor cap was due for replacement.  
No problem, I thought.  I bought a new cap and rotor last fall from 
my dealer, and figured now would be good time to install it.  Well, I 
think I have the wrong cap.  

The cap on the van has a metal shroud around it with a braided copper 
ground strap attached.  The cap I bought last fall doesn't.  It has a 
black plastic cover over the brown cap with a metal tab where the 
spring clip locks onto the cap.  Hmmmm.  I couldn't get the old cap 
out of the metal shroud as it is crimped on, but the black plastic 
cover can come off the new cap.  Ok, put it all back together, and 
write this note for clarification.

The new cap is a German Bosch part with part #1235522370.  The black 
plastic cap has a part #0290004019.  The rotor part# is 1234332350.. 
also German.  The VW part # is 027 905 207A BOS for the cap, and 
052905225C for the rotor.

Could anyone verify the correct part #'s for the distributor cap and 
rotor for me for a '90??  Really appreciate any information on this.  

Thanks,
Harry.
