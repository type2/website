Subject: RE: Pla-Cool Air Cooler?


&gt;My 71 semi-camperized bus has, among other accessories installed by an
&gt;unknown PO, a unit called a Pla-Cool that sticks up out of the otherwise
&gt;stock roof. It's a white, rounded, heavy-duty plastic sort of cowling
&gt;affair, about 6&quot; tall and maybe a foot square. I think it might be a
&gt;circulating water air-cooler, but I really have no clue.
&gt;
&gt;Controls are mounted on the bottom half of the unit, which protrudes
&gt;downwards from the bus ceiling. It has on/off switches for &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;pump&quot;
&gt;and another switch that flips it from &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;exhaust.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;It sat unused for years until one day I noticed, tucked back in right rear
&gt;corner of the engine compt. above the battery, an empty fuse holder. I
&gt;popped a 15 amp fuse in, went into the bus and turned the Pla-Cool on, and
&gt;the fan began to whirr. Paranoid of a possible VW electrical debacle, I
&gt;turned it off, took the fuse out and haven't touched it since.
&gt;
&gt;But I'm curious. Anyone have experience with these things? Does it 
circulate
&gt;water (that intriguing &quot;pump&quot; switch)? If so, where do you put the water 
in?
&gt;What amp fuse should it take? Would I be inviting disaster to use it?


Sounds like a swamp cooler. My mobile home in Colorado had one, a lot
bigger than yours of course. It has water in a trough at the bottom,
and a pump to spray the water onto a porous, fibrous material, and a fan
to draw outside air in, through the wet porous material and into the
mobile home. This evaporated the water and cooled the air. A nifty idea,
and very powerful.

Never seen one on a bus, tho I've heard of them. Sorry I can't help with
electrical details. Any manufacturer name and/or address and/or number?

You might also ask at an RV shop-- they may also be familiar with them.
