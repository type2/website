Subject: Re: Trouble with Type II rod bearings...


Thanks for all your help, Bob. This is going to be an excellent engine (if
I ever get the ^_at_$%&amp;# finished) largely because of you.

&gt;&gt;Stock crank (per Haynes) was 2.164

&gt;eh... close, but not very precise.

&gt;If the machinest knew his stuff, he
&gt;shot for a finished dimension of 2.1466&quot; to 2.1458&quot; and it sounds like he did
&gt;pretty well in your case.

Good. OK. It's right there. I was afraid I was going to have to return the
crank.

&gt;To make things fit you now need bearing shells that are half a millimeter
&gt;thicker, meaning they should be marked &quot;+0.50mm&quot;

That's what they're marked.

&gt;The shell should be lubricated with a
&gt;wipe of CV joint grease or assembly lube.

I used oil. Muir says use Lubriplate, but an appendix in Muir says don't,
use oil instead. Since this was a pre-assembly specifically to check
tolerance, I didn't want sticky grease in there if it wouldn't be in there
when the engine was hot and running. I'll try it again with grease.

&gt;First, there may not be a problem.  If you are in a warm shop, if the journal
&gt;is perfectly round and well polished, and if the rod and bearing shell are a
&gt;good fit, you have a circle within a circle with a thin layer of grease
&gt;between them and the thing swings down quick like a bunny.  No problem, just
&gt;perfectly fitting parts and warm lubricant.
&gt;
&gt;Are they all like that?

The crank had damn well better be round. I have no idea about the rods.
Three are straight out of the old engine, one is &quot;rebuilt&quot;, which evidently
means &quot;scrubbed off with a wire brush,&quot; mostly. There is fresh
cross-hatching in the large end of the rebuilt rod, and that large end is
the same size as the other three used rods, so I figured everything should
be fine. But I don't know whether they're round. The rebuilt one took the
place of the rod that was banged on in the old engine.

&gt;Can you detect ANY appreciable in/out motion when you push/pull on the little
&gt;end of the con rod?

No. But if I hold onto the cap end and move the small end, I can get it to
pivot just a hair. It slides back and forth (end-play wise) on the journal
*very* easily. What do I know, but it seems to me that it will have
appreciable play before break-in is over.

&gt;Since you do not have precision measuring instruments, use the Plastigage.
&gt; You need to know if the clearance exceeds spec, which should be about
&gt;.0015&quot;.  If the radial play is more than .0025&quot;, then you need to replace the
&gt;connecting rod.

OK. I'll do that today and get new rods if I have to. Thanks again!
