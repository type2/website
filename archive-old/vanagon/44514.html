&gt; joel mentioned to me that he was leaning to the michelin XCH light truck
&gt; tires....i went shopping around today and found out that michelin doesn't
&gt; carry the xch's anymore but that the michelin MX4 replaces them. this si
&gt; an 185/70r14 double sidewall reinforced tire. light truck. i went to
&gt; NTW (National Tire Wholesale) and got a GREAT price quoted on them.
&gt; 
&gt; first, western auto quoted me $88 a tire. NTW quoted me $71.78 a tire.
&gt; the breakdown is as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 287.12  4 Michelin 185/70r14 mx4 tires
&gt; 45.96   installation w/lifetime balance
&gt; 5.76    2% Scrap tire disposal tax
&gt; 28.02   extened warranty
&gt; 17.23   sales tax
&gt; -----
&gt; 384.09 total
&gt; 
&gt; not bad i don't think, good tire....reinforced sidewalls...any comments?

	Jonathan...!!  

	185/70R-14 are NOT the correct size for a Type II vehicle they 
are almost an 1&quot; &amp; 1/2&quot; too small!!!

	Price doesn't matter.. get the right size...  185R-14 or 
195/75R-14 or 205/70R-14....

	all of the above should be Reinforced or C load range or 
higher...
