Subject: Pop Top Lift Off Cure

Greetings all,

Thanks for all the great suggestions on how to keep my bus and its top together.

Here's what I decided to do:

I took an old pair of 'soft racks', since my surfboard now goes on the
Yakima 'hard racks I installed, and cannibalized the gutter mounts, straps,
and on of the 'hold downs'. I made a simple strap which goes accross the
top of the pop-top...it can easily be removed...seems secure...I'm sure it
will come in handy for some tkype of emergency....if one of my surf trips
goes really sour I could boil and eat it....
