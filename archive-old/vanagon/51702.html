Subject: Shift stick extender?

The gear lever (or shift stick if you like) in my 4 speed 1982 bus it a bit
of a long reach and causes left shoulder ache in traffic. Is this a common
problem? Do you find yourself moving the seat forward because of this?

Is it possible/easy to either get a longer lever or bolt on an extension to
the normal one?

On a similar vein, is it possible to get the clutch pedal and brake pedals
to be angled closer to the floor? The gas pedal seems to be at the right
stretch, but for the other two levers I have to bend my knees much more.
