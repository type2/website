&lt;&lt; I know this is probably an absurd  attention to detail but here goes:
 
 The final drive for an auto transmission vanagon ('86) specifies SAE 90
 GL-5 grease but I've not been able to find any.  Will SAE 80W90 GL-5 offer
 the same protection?  How about some quick professional help?
  &gt;&gt;
The 80w-90 will work fine.
