&gt; Thom, Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; The '62 1200 Jadegrun/Weiss Kombi i once had, had the nipple lights with amber
&gt; lenses, to my belief it was the last year for the European Busses to have
&gt; them.

Was your bus American?  My American '57 has bullet (nipple) turn 
signals.  

I am wondering about the European models.  I believe they 
had semaphores into the sixties, whereas the US ones went to bullet 
signals long before then.
