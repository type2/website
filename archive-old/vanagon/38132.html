Subject: Front Suspension Squeek

Hi everybody! 
I am new to the list and wish to introduce myself and my &quot;big brown slug&quot;
('84 Westy) who's feeling alittle stiff in the joints. There's a high-pitched
suspension squeek in the right front upper section. It's a rubber-metal type
of sound that happens whenever travelling over uneven ground especially in
colder weather. My neighbor's Westy is doing the same thing! I've been told
by several mechanics to spray silicone lube on the offending joint, but it
hasn't helped. I did a search of the archives and found someone who
apparently had fixed a similar problem by replacing the upper control arm
bushings. Should I do the same or is this something that can be put off for a
long time?
Also, whats the deal with the occasional clack, clack, clack from the
pushrods(?)  when the van sits for a few days/weeks unused, especially when
the oil level is anything less than the full mark? I've heard other Vanagons
do this,too.  Thanks for any help!!
