Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?


Wow...this thread has finally migrated from VINTAGVW to here...so
let me throw in my $.02 worth...although I DID get chucked off
of VINTAGVW for expressing my views on VWT&amp;A and Douche Bags &amp;
Horny Volks Wusses....

Perhaps when I was a pubescent 14 or 16 the format of a magazine
that featured both cars and semi-nekid wimmen was the ultimate...
Unfortunately, that was 25 years ago...I've had plenty of
cars...and plenty of women since then (not to sound sexist...
but you know what I mean)...

Back twenty five years ago the thought of cars and blonde big breasted
bikini bug/bus bimbos would bring about the requisite necessity for
crank polishing....today, I'm older and I HATE the idea that the
magazine publishers believe that I'm still a 16 year old, and that
my purchasing habits, my life pleasures stil revolve around
this sort of drivel. Hell, if I want to have a car fantasy
today, I'll drive the bug or even the 944...if I want a sexual
fantasy, my wife can fullfill that...I don't need no steenking
magazine!

The second thing I find offensive about VWT&amp;A or DB&amp;HVWs is that
the &quot;bimbo factor&quot; is clearly a devise to cloak the fact that
the writing in these magazines (both technical and event) sucks..
My 6th grade son can do better....and considering that I've
been thru college/grad school/law school reading something written
by an author whose highest literary style is to use words like
&quot;sano&quot;, &quot;bitchin'&quot;, &quot;resto&quot;, &quot;ass kickin' stereo&quot; just doesn't
cut it...to add insult to injury it appears that BOTH the magazine
editors and advertisers appear to believe that I'll probably
ignore the writing style because I now have a &quot;chub&quot; from looking
at the bikini clad bimbos....so therefore I will now have to
run up to the bathroom...latch the door and flog my dolphin..

Their logic being with the amount of vibration going on, the only
thing I'll be able to focus on is the picture...rather than
the print.


I'll pick up those mags only when I have to...if there is some info
that I'm not able to get anywhere else. All is not lost however,
this group as well as the VintagVW group provides much better
and IMMEDIATE tech info than any of those magazines could ever
do! In addition, clubs like the VVWCA, GASS, The CVA etc. puit
out a better newsletter than these editors at the various magazines...

Sorry to get off on a rant....

Ric
