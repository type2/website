After getting screwed by Parts Place (wrong main seal) and then Bus 
Boys, (they forgot to send Tran. end seal) I decided to get the battery 
out of the Vanagon. My weekend project has dragged out a month and I 
wanted to get the battery on a charger.
 When I first opened the sliding door I noticed 
matches all over the seat and cabinets. Since I forgot it takes more 
than brute force to remove the battery, I went back to get my tools. 
A while later I returned and started to notice other strange things 
in the interior, most noticable A Nest in the storage rail above the 
sink. Also footprints all over the place and stuff dragged from the 
cabinets. That's when I started worrying that whatever it was, might 
still be in there. After poking the nest and dismantling it I 
proceded to replace the rear deck lid where it belongs.....If it its 
still in there I don't want to know....A point to consider for those 
with yard busses and grass killing Vanagons.
On a more serious note, I got all the oil cleaned up and the flywheel 
ungunked and just lack the two seals for a bench test. My new 
thermostst and motor mounts have been installed and the carb cleaned 
inside &amp; out. The motor mounts from bus boys were the cheapest 
looking ones I've ever seen! The metal is much thinner than the 
originals and the rubber was painted along with the frame. My biggest 
gripe is one of the outers was bent and took quite a bit of bending 
to get it over the hanger, I was afraid the cheap steel would break.
The next time I will specify OEM.
