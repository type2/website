Brian,

I can't seem to find you new e-mail address....

I received the VW club stuff last week....Thanks! I spoke to Pim Van Loon 
(from the VintagVW list) and he is a director of the club?

I will be in Germany this June, and in Koln probably during the last week of 
June, maybe we can meet somewhere?

Ric
