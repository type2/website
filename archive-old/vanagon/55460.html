Subject: 2nd battery installation question
Date: Mon, 3 Feb 1997 13:21:36 -0800 (PST)

I'm going to be installing a second (deep cycle) battery in the hidden 
compartment between the water tank compartment and the lower storage 
compartment that has the circuit breaker panel in it.  I would like to 
know from those that have already installed a battery in this 
compartment, if you had any problems fitting your battery in there?  
I presume that the wiring running on the floor has to be moved and 
I'm not certain about the circuit breaker panel?  It seems awfully 
tight in there.  The dimensions I came up with for a battery to fit 
were: H = 8&quot; x L ~ 8 - 9&quot; x D ~ 4 - 5&quot;.  That was with the circuit 
breaker panel in it's current position.  I've read in the archives 
that those of you that did this installation have moved the interior 
wood panel by about 1 inch to accomodate the depth and length of the 
battery.  This seems easy enough if that's all I need to do to make it 
fit.  I also assume that you all used some kind of battery tray to protect
the floor?  

I'd really appreciate some detailed input on this so that I don't have
to fumble around too much.

Oh, brands and sizes of batteries would be useful too.

Thanks for any inputs.
