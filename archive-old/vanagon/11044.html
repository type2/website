Those Glowing Bellied cars are illegal?
I've always liked the look of them.
(not that I'd ever do it to my own vehicle, I don't want people to
think I'm the greasy Iroc Driver type with a fuzzy dice fetish)
But they look cool when they pass you on the freeway.
Especially one guy in my neighboorhood who drives his purple glowing
Ginomobile along the highway at twice the limit with no other lights on
at all.
