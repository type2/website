Subject: Re: Still Being Screwed/paying yo dues...

It's too bad that any of us need to pay our dues but I agree on two points.
1. Hang in there Jonathan, eventually you will have fun with your vehicle.
2. Most all vehicles that we buy especially used and VWs of whatever you
favorite flavor will need some adjustments and saddle breaking (Old Cowboy
reference)prior to getting it the way we want it and they way that it should
behave.

Add to this list all of the stories that we've all read about. good thing
we're all here to help each other out.  You're in good company Jonathan.
Don't get discouraged! =)

Last week, a buddy of mine got a screaming deal on a '63 crew cab that he
bought from the &quot;old man&quot; that had it since '67. Yesterday I towed him off
the freeway after he nearly seized his motor after the oil pump failed on
him. Just remember J, I've had the westy resto for 18 months and have
*never* driven it. 
We all end up paying our dues...
