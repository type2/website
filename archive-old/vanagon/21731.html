Rusty sez:
Just tell them that you are taking them &quot;camping and fishing.&quot; In route you
can say, &quot;Hey there is a junkyard, I have the keys, I don't mind being
celibate for the next year or two, let's stop spend all of our cash on parts
and ruin the rest of our trip!&quot; Some how this is related to &quot;HotWater in
Vans.&quot; Outside of the celibacy thing, this usually works for me. Check the
cartoon in the NEATO newsletter for futher details...

BTW:Cherry recently objected to how I portay her in my posts, and the
articles/cartoons in the NEATO newsletter. She says that I portray her as a
complaining, clinging, codependant, spineless, nagging, grumpy, bi***. I
told her that of course the &quot;Rusty and Cherry&quot; characters are only a
reflection of what might occur in some other fictional VW loving family made
of all exisitng possible senarios. I would NEVER portray a lovely,
supportive, patient, caring spouse, like her in this manner. Besides I have
to live with her for the rest of my wrench turning days unless I want to
sell all of my furniture, real estate, misc. property, Vdubs, pay alimony,
and go live in a fleabag apartment with loud neighbors. Somehow I've learned
to be a  nice, sensative, and nurturing guy! ;)
