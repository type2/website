Well, gang,
Tonight's problem was the altenator bearings froze up suddenly.  Sounds a
lot like what I would imagine the death sounds of a pig sound like.  
But, in the continuing fight against oil spots from blow by, it now seems
that there is very little blow by from my vanagon these days.  However 
there are still a few drops of oil which do seem to come up the filler
tube.  
I've come up with a most remarkable solution to this, which I am sure would
be appreciated by the group.  Ready?
I have placed a condom over the end of my oil filler tube.  These things
will catch slight amounts of oil which dripple out the end of the filler
tube without making too much of a mess.  This is also how I can now say
that I don't have too much blow-by.  If the pressure got too high, it
would never hold.  
Now, you might laugh (I sure have) about this solution, but the truth is
that condoms turn out to be extremely useful things quite apart from their
intended purpose.  Therefore, in your survival kits that you carry around
with you, I now have to also recommend a condom.
