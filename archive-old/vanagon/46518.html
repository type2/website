Here I go again.  I wrote:
&gt;
&gt;Everything clear?  Anything missing?  It seems to me this is the real
&gt;goal of splitting the list: reduce the needed remailer resources, and
&gt;at the same time, avoid splitting up a very cohesive group of people.
&gt;

There are two ways this could work out.  As new people subscribe
(often to only one or the other list), and old people leave (who had
often been subscribed to both lists), the two lists might tend to grow
apart naturally.  After some time, maybe 3yrs or 5yrs, the two lists
might be painlessly decoupled, if that trend of seperation is actually
observed.

OTOH, a policy could be established that a subscription request to one
list is a subscription request to both lists, while an unsubscribe
request to a list is specific to that list only.  Hence, any newcomers
would automatically be subscribed to both lists, and if, after a
while, (s)he decides not to participate in one list or the other, the
list could be unsubscribed as desired.  This policy would tend to keep
the group together while dividing the workload between two remailers.

Of course, it all comes back to whether it's even possible, and
whether anyone (Gerry, Ken, or a third party) is willing to go to the
trouble to try to implement it.


I'll shut up now.
