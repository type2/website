Subject:      rear heat in aircooleds./idea

Hi all,

Haven't done this, but seems OK.  Any takers?? :)

Adding the oil/water cooler that is sandwiched between filter and block
in all '86 and up engines can be done to all(?) aircooled bus/vanagon
from '72-'83.  Parts are about $100 from dealer, so yard them.

Pick up an Audi Turbo coolant water pump from the engine bay, they
usually stay in the car when stripped. Grab the hoses/mount too. And get
a wasserboxer rear bench heater and main coolant reservoir.  All these
bits have about 1/2&quot; diameter hoses.

With the oil cooler installed, run hoses through firewall to heater,
then to pump then reservoir and back to cooler.  This should give a
hotwater system that will take up a small amount of space under the rear
bench.  Run the pressure relief hose to a hole in the floor, just in
case it overheats. Use antifreeze, not water!

The engine oil, at 190+F will provide nice heat to the water, BUT...
how much heat can be sucked out of that little oil cooler? May take a
while to warmup and get some storage heat built up.  May need to control
pump flow somehow (dimmer switch/thermostat?) Someone needs to test this
setup, good luck! Lot to be said for a working BN-4 gasheater under the
rear seat too.... :)

Bye, Tim
