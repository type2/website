&gt;Well now that it's certain Joel has left his area ....

uhhhhhh ... i don't understand this at all. :)

&gt;I'm on my way to that area and plan to view the facilities of the infamous
&gt;Monsta, Mayhem and Madcap Corp while there.
&gt;At any rate I'll not be back on the 'net' for a week so.
&gt;I hope you folks will be conservative about sending messages all over
&gt;the place.
&gt;Getting back to read a 'thousand messages does not seem like an
&gt;after-vacation fun thing!

for those of you going on vacation (such as Richard), i can finagle some
stuff and put you on Digest format if you want (then, instead of a thousand
little messages in your mailbox, you'll have only a dozen Great Huge Muthas.)
or i can drop you off the list and let you resubscribe (or contact me or
gerry when you get back). or basically, i can do nothing. :)  your choice.

did he say he was going to see the whizzers of america? they have a group
for that!?!?!
