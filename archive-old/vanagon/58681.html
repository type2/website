&gt;	Could you give some examples?  I have to believe that the Winnebago

&gt;are better than the Winnebago, but I haven't seen any specific examples.

The Westfalia conversion has the propane connections mounted on the side of
the van, rather than hanging below the van.  This results in at least 4&quot; of
clearance at the middle of the van.

I'm not sure about the EuroVan westie, but the Vanagon Westie has a pop-top
that raises MUCH higher than the Eurobago.  In the Eurobago, it's fairly
claustrophobic for an adult to sleep in the top bunk, whereas in the
Vanagon westie there's a lot more vertical space.
