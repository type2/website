Subject: Westy - How to keep the front table leg and top from getting
  lost...

Table leg:   For late model Westys (not sure about earlier ones), the front
table leg  with the table off is a great paper towel rack. 

Table top:   I put  two tie-down clips (from a marine supply place) on the
rear of the passenger side seat box and the table top rides vertically
behind the passenger seat held in place by a bungy cord.    It's probably
better not to drill into the battery when you are installing the clips...

Incidently, I've put clips to attach bungy cords in other places on both of
our vans, including  the driver/passenger seat boxes (bungies keep that
thermos from rolling out of reach or under the brake petal), the front
board below the rear seat (Weekender or Westy) (keeps bags of groceries or
the 1 gallon juice container from spilling all over), and at either side of
the rear hatch opening  (a bungy across the opening after loading keeps the
sleeping bags from falling out in the mud when you open the hatch...)

The clips I user are just U-clips that take a screw at each end.   You can
get them at a marine supply place.

Dave
