Volks,
	I'm trying to track down dpd, the makers of the air conditioner in
my bus.  Another bus I saw at the junkyard last weekend has the same A/C
as mine, with a sticker on it that said &quot;dpd manufacturing, San Antonio,
Tx.&quot;.  Well I called the 1-800 directory service, and directory
assistance in San Antonio, and there are no listings for dpd in either
place.  I also searched the web and came up with nothing.  Does anyone
know if this company is still in business, and if so where they are or
how to get a hold of them?  I want to find out if the plastic covers for
the A/C units are still available.  The one in the junkyard is much
nicer than mine, but it will be a lot of work to remove and if I can buy
a new one I'd rather just do that instead.  Thanks in advance...

-David
