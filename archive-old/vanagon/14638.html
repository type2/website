&gt; I have a new sound I could use some help decoding on my '71.  It's a subtle 
&gt; high pitched (whistle like) sound that doesn't appear to be directly 
&gt; related to wheel speed.  It occurs in all gears (well, I'm sure of 2-4, but 
&gt; the engine revs in 1st might drown it out) but does go away when I press 
&gt; the clutch in at least half way. 

Goes away when you press in the clutch, eh?  Sounds like the throwout
bearing to me.  My Mustang has the same problem.  If so, it should change
a little with engine RPM.
