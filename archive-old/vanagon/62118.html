Subject: Re: RPM

          I'm asking me about the rpm of my van. 
          
          Would you give me your rpm of your van if
          
          --- he got a automatic transmission
          --- when you drive at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h)
          --- it's a westfalia whit all the kit....
          
          My van turn about 3700 rpm at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h), I think 
          that's a
          little too much. Is that right?
     
     You're partly right: It DOES SEEM like a little too much.
     
     But it isn't.  3800-3900 in my automatic nets me 65 MPH and finds me 
     wishing for an overdrive - but the torque probably isn't there.
