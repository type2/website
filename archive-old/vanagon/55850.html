I am no mechanic, But I have had the same problem! The contacts in the
electric door switch become worn down and cause the problem you
described.  The dealer quoted me a price to replace them, That was NOT
an option.  I decided I could try to fix them for that price. I did.  
1.  First you need to find out witch lock is causing the problem. Use
the key in both doors to see if there is a difference.
2.  Remove the door panels.  Fix one side at a time.
3.  Remove the lock mechanism. There should be two electrical plugs and
one lock rod and two screws. Pay attention to how it came out. 
4.  On a large, clean surface slowly open the housing.  Slowly, slowly
and carefully because their several small pieces inside. I discovered
the hard way that the electric motor works in only one direction after
opening and spilling the switch contents in the back yard. You may need
to mark the pieces or take a photo of the     parts to assure
reassemble.
5   Once open you will find brass contacts and grease.  Wipe away the
grease and clean the contacts.  They are kind of fragile so be careful
with them.  Steel wool or fine sand paper will work well.
6.  Once clean you will see the flexiable brass contact that move with
the key. They relax over time.  Bend them slightly and gently in the
direction of their mating surfaces. 
7.  Reassembling the unit take a little time. Be patient it's worth.
Apply lite grease to the contacts.  The seams need to be resealed with
silicon or a similar product.  Make sure the upper boot is installed, it
helps keep rain water out 
    of the switch.
8.  Replace switch in door.  Test before Replacing pannel.
9.  I took me two times to get it right  
10. (Lock Note) Dirty contacts on rear door post cause side and rear
hatch to not  lock. I don't know how long I had been leaving the side
door and rear hatch unlocked, until I happened to check.  Normally I
enter through the drivers side door, witch was locked but the rear was
not.  Use Steel wool or fine sand paper.
Contact me if you need more help.

&gt; To whomever answers these questions,
&gt; 
&gt; We'd be grateful if someone (our VW mechanic can't help) could tell us
&gt; about 88 Vanagon powerlocks. Ours cycle on, lock and immediately
&gt; unlock at the same time. We checked the fuses; unable to indentify
&gt; which relay controls the locks. Anybody know?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
