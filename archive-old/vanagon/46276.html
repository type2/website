Subject: Re: VW Customer Relations on Westfalias in US

Hi,

&gt; 	... But let's fast forward to
&gt; 1992, the first year that I know the Audi division offered for sale in
&gt; England the current 2.5 liter DIRECT INJECTION TDI motor, then rated as
&gt; 115 horsepower _at_ 4000 rpm, which has now been increased to 140 at the
&gt; same speed.  This FABULOUS diesel...

	Look I may be making things worse here rather than better but isn't
this the 5 cylinder inline diesel that is sold in Europe in Transporters?

 The T4 Transporters my parents have in the UK (Scotland, for the record
England is not a politically correct term for the UK (or Britain, either
is fine :-)) have non-turbo inline fives that sound very much like this unit,
I'm sure they are &quot;sourced&quot; from Audi, and I think they are about 115hp not 78.

	W.

PS Sorry about the crap my email system tags onto my messages- Gerry has
   asked me to fix it and I'm working on the problem but so far I havn't
   come up with an answer.
