Subject: Strange Electrical Problem - '56 Bus

The '56 has once again developed an electrical gremlin.

A few weeks ago, it started doing this thing where it would not
start if it the motor was hot.  It would just turn over weakly.
If you let it sit, for a while, it was fine, or if you pushed it,
it would start right up.

It got worse and worse, so I put a new battery in.  The old battery had leaked
pretty bad, and there was acid everywhere :(

Now when I turn the key, it just clicks.  If I keep working it, it eventually
turns over rapidly and fires right up.  I can hear the &quot;ping&quot; of the starter
gear, but it doesn't turn over at all.

I have the &quot;Muir Solenoid&quot; installed.  The starter and bushing are just over
a year old.

Any ideas?  I was thinking the ignition switch might be bad:  One day when it
did the &quot;slow turning&quot; trick, the ignition switch stuck itself in the &quot;start&quot;
position a couple times, so I could take the key out, and it would still be
turning the motor over!

Any ideas?

Thom
