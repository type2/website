&gt;Is the transmission on an '81 geared lower than the trans on a '78 Bus?
&gt;It sure feels like it -- seems like I've got to shift a lot sooner in
&gt;the '81 than in the '78.

bentley(s) sez:
1978 4-speed:
     1st gear: 3.80        Final drive: 4.857 (from 1974-&gt;)
1981 4-speed:
     1st gear: 3.78        Final drive: 4.57

and since i have never figured out gears and transmissions, i have no idea
if that's &quot;lower&quot; or not. :)
