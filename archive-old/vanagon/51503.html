Subject: Initial Start-up After Rebuild
Date: Sat, 9 Nov 1996 18:18:14 +0000

   I finished reinstalling my 1.9L after a bit of rebuilding work, late last
night and attempted to start it.  It turned over but did not fire.  

   Should the timing be close enough to start if I line up the timing mark
on the pulley and the distributor rotor with the #1 firing mark on the
distributor assembly?

   When I had the fuel injection manifold off the engine during rebuild, I
drained fuel from the injector manifold assembly.  How long should it take
to refill the fuel lines and start?  Do I need to bleed the air out of the
fuel line to the injectors?

   Thanks,
