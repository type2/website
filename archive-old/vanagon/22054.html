&gt; &gt; So - where's a good place to get parts in San Francisco?  Good Junkyard?
&gt;
&gt; For parts, I like:
&gt; 
&gt;    - Pick-Your-Part in Hayward, just over the bridge in the east bay.

There's also a Pick-N-Pull on San Leandro Blvd. near 73rd in Oakland.
And the place that Martha bought her Thing from has Van parts.  I can't 
remember the name of the place though.
