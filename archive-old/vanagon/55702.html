Subject: group trip, year 2000?


How about doing some phenomenal trip with both groups in the year 2000
to mark the turn of the month, year, decade, century, and millenium?  Well,
technically I guess this happen in 2001, but it seems the rest of
the world is fairly focused on 2000, so I thought we should be, too.

How about a marathon trip to somewhere REALLY obscure for most of
us - like Tierra del Fuego?

I know this is off in the future, but with something of this
magnitude, I figure we'd need lots of time for people to plan
for vacations, time-offs, sabbaticals, etc., not to mention
getting their vehicles ready and/or upgraded.

Food for thought....
