Subject:  front hitch mount?

has anyone ever put a trailer-type hitch on the _front_ of their
transporter?  i'm wondering if i would have to get something fabricated
or if i can find an existing hitch bracket out there somewhere which will
work.  i have a ball-hitch mount bike rack which i would like to put on the
front as the bikes get super grimy on the back. (i'd rather have bugs
splattered all over them)  thanks for any info.  btw-i made 2 new vw
friends in town, 1 with an orange 72 autostick bubbletop and one with a
mint (actually lime) 78 beautiful westy.  its nice to have some community.
