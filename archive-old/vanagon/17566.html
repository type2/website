&gt; I wish that were true, however, I noticed the performance failing before I
&gt; pulled into that station.  I also have realized that I simply did not filter
&gt; the fuel ring properly.  I used a circa 1971 type III pre-pump filter
&gt; without a high pressure filter post-pump, pre-injectors.  I also had to
&gt; remove the low pressure filter I had installed on the return line back to
&gt; the pump from the ring because it leaked.  This could easily have allowed
&gt; contamination from the tank to enter the pump since it's on the same line.
&gt; Fooey.

&gt; Eug,

By all means keep posting this stuff, first of all.  Second, I can't
remember but did you have the fuel tank boiled and sealed? if not crap
from the tank could be a major problem.  I really figure a Type III or
Bus style pre-pump filter is most likely sufficient IMHO as those
systems used just as complex and probably even more suceptible to
contamination electric needle valve injectors, unlike the CIS systems
that you can run anything through.  But if you want one post pump, I'd
reccomend the style for my '90 Corrado (Purolator replacement about $10)
it has nice hose clamp style fitting unlike a lot of high pressure
filters with threaded or banjo styles.  Still you said you pulled a bank
and had a nice spray pattern so how can your injectors be bad?, if both
banks look ok, measure volume if you can somehow, then I'd rule out the
injectors.  How about a fouled sensor or a problem with the HALTECH
computer? these seem more likely to be causing the difficulty to me.
