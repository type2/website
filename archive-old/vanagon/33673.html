Subject: Re: Resto's and Museums

i guess i have to chime in on this thread.

i am just finishing up a full resto on my 1960 Crew cab.  i took the 
entire car apart.  every nut and bolt.  so far it has taken me 8 months 
and who knows how much money to get it to where it is now.  i did use 
some NOS parts (door handles) and like to keep it looking original, but i 
certanly do't have the kind of money to replace every piece with a 
NOS/OEM part.  what is the point in doing that if i am going to drive 
it.  no way an i going to put all that time and money into a bus to let 
it sit ther and get dusty.  i want to drive it.  there is no fealing like 
driving down to the beach with the safari's open and the wind in my 
hair.  everbody looks because it is a nice truck.  that is what i enjoy.  
if i keep it in my garage all the time, who is going to apreciate my 
labor of love?  nobody.  i feal that one should restore there bus to the 
point that they like it and then enjoy it.  drive them around and let 
everybody see what you have done.

my 2 cents.

take care and God Bless
