Subject: sponsorship


Sponsorship could mean anything from VW providing parking lots for
us all to camp in, all the way up to they (or anybody else) 
providing, money, gas, parts, etc.  I should think that companies/
businesses who might stand to gain widespread PR from this event
might be willing to contribute SOMETHING.  I suppose it's up to
all of us to think of the possibilities and approach these people,
the more people and the more businesses the better...
