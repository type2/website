&gt;From what were told, everything stays the same.  Auto Zone will be carrying our
CD in their stores when our Consumer CD is released in a few months.  About
the only thing I can see happening is it _not_ being carried in other auto parts
stores, which is a bummer because AZ isn't even in California yet, much less 
prolly a few other states.

Prolly makes more sense now to cover earlier air cooled stuff though, because
AZ purports to cater to the Do-It_Yerself kinda person.  So what good does
a set of manuals for a '96 Jeep do ya?  Nuttin'!
