Subject: Re: Da trip, NYC leg

I have parked both my '87 and my '90 syncro campers on the streets of
Manhattan, NYC, for years and I have never been broken into and I have never
had a fender bender in the city. 

My car is too weird looking and too rare for anyone evil in NYC to know what
it is or want to break in.
