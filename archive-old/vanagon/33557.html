Subject: drive it!

	I've gotta agree with Dave Schwartz- excellent cars belong on
the road, not in museums. There's a T2 and a Corrado in some museum
somewhere- Wolfsburg I hope, and I'm making them more valuable by
driving mine on the street. Its fine to keep it in as-new condition,
but I can't see the point of trailering a car around. 
	My dad used to watch a guy in 944 turbo gingerly tip-toe over
the speed bumps and park diagonally across two spots far from anyone's
doors. His observation to me: &quot;The proper way to arrive in a 944 turbo is
*sideways*!&quot; I've gotta agree. We VW Bus types drive our favorites as
a matter of course, as it should be. This weeks Autoweek has a cover
story on the Ferrari F50. Two were delivered in Texas. One went into
a trailer immediately, the other was driven 115 (yes, 115) laps on
the local race track for the benefit of the new owner's friends in
the right seat. He then drove it home! My man!!
