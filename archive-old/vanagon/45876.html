&gt;Dear Vanagoners,

&gt;        This is a follow up to the &quot;dead vanagon engine&quot; post in April.
&gt;Recap: 91 Vanagon Carat (&quot;weekender&quot; package) blew engine at 80K. Local

&gt;        One question: do the heads need to be retorqued at 1000 miles?
&gt;
&gt; HI Philip

&gt;No, from what I understand it isn't recomended. The head nuts are sealed
with silicone and if you retorque the heads you will break the seal and you
may have coolant leaks from under the nuts.&gt;
