Subject: Surplus stuff

Greetings all,
  Last week I saw mentioned on the list the idea of adding blower motors in
the engine compartment and wanted to pass on the location of a potential
supplier of said fans.  Maybe some of you have heard of it, but the place is
called (simply enogh) &quot;Surplus Center&quot; and is based in Lincoln NE.  They have
available a good sized catalog (180 pgs in 1995) of all sorts of pieces,
parts, and stuff.  For example:  winches, hoists, gauges, pulleys, bearings,
alternators, trailer parts, mud flaps, hydraulic stuff, motors, fans, pumps,
air compressors and parts, battery chargers, misc. electrical stuff (a lot
with automotive applications), tools, propane heaters, and a lot of stuff
that is just plain unclassifiable.
Please note:  I am not in any way related to this outfit, nor do I stand to
gain anything financially or otherwise for this posting.  I'm just mentioning
a place that has served me well over the years.  Although I currently don't
have a bus/van, I keep looking through this catalog and finding all sorts of
stuff I could use on one.  Definately worth the price of the phone/fax call.

Surplus Center
1015 West &quot;O&quot; Street, P.O. Box 82209
Lincoln, NE 68501-2209
Tel:  (402) 474-4055  Fax:  (402) 474-5198
