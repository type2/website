Hey all,
With the purchase of my new '81, I can no longer keep my lovely '78 Bus,
so I will post the ad here before it gets around campus and hits the
papers.

'78 Bus.
Approx. 170K miles
painted white by previous owner.
7-passenger, brown interior

This bus is in excellent mechanical shape, the engine has been very
reliable and has really been very trouble free.  

The engine has new pushrod tube seals and new valve cover gaskets, but
still leaks a bit of oil from the second sump plate where I've installed
an oil temperature sender for the VDO oil temp gauge.  

The body is largely very solid, with the exception of some surface rust
on the lower part of the passenger door, the window ledge on the
driver's door, a couple bubbles (not broken through paint yet) on the
bottom of the sliding door, and one rust hole on the back panel that's
immediately forward of the rear bumper.  You can't see it unless you get
right up there and look.  I think there is also a little bit on the
bottom edge of one of the side windows.

I've done lots of work to this bus:
rebuilt alternator
rebuilt starter/solenoid
solenoid relay fix
VDO oil temperature gauge w/ sump plate sender (comes with bus)
restored wheels to original glory with silver paint
restuffed both front seats
brand spankin' new German lower speedometer cable
it comes with an am/fm cassette player as well as 2 pioneer speakers in
the front door panels (PO did it)
new radio antenna
like I said before, new pushrod tube seals
new turn signal switch                  
new hazard flasher switch
new flasher relay (all due to a short in the old turn signal switch)
I recently removed the seats and regreased the tracks
I'm sure there's a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now.

Pictures can be seen at http://www.mwc_dot_edu/~sbart7kb/mybus.htm

Listmembers John Anderson (vwbus_at_netbiz_dot_net), H. Steven Dolan
(dworkin_at_ari_dot_net), Paul Wies (pwies_at_loyola_dot_edu), and Tom Forhan (can't
remember his e-mail address) have all seen my bus and I'm sure they
would be able to tell you their opinions about its condition.

Basically, it's a solid reliable bus that's been great to me but now I
gotta sell it.  I'm asking $1900 but it's negotiable.  The bus is
located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which is about an hour south of
D.C. and an hour north of Richmond, VA.

So let me know if anyone's interested.

Thanks,
Sean
