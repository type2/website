Subject: 87' Vanagon Syncro brain needed

Well, the so-called &quot;final&quot; diagnosis on my intermittent engine failure is
that the computer is faulty (after replacing most everything else but,
fortunately, the engine failed to start in the garage and they sound
confident that this is it). New ones cost $700 and parts place quotes
$600. Anyone know of a cheaper source or a used one?

Thanks, Nelson Hogg
