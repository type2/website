Subject: Re: Euro-Winnebago Complaint (long)

&gt; My guess is that VW really doesn't care about it's customers. At least not
&gt; the ones that by vans. One would think that VW or Winnebago would be willing
&gt; to resolve the problem, even if it meant modifying the vehicle with an
&gt; auxillary heater.  I would consider going to a custom van shop and having one
&gt; installed.  I Would like to someday get a Rialta.  I wonder if this unit is
&gt; any better.  At least it has a propane furnace!  I guess VW feels that por
&gt; heat is as suffecient as the poor acceleration. Maybe someone should take a
&gt; Ford full size Van and equip it as a Vanagin Westfalia.  I think it would
&gt; sell like hot cakes.  I want mine with four wheel drive.  

The Eurovan does NOT have poor acceleration.  I can't outdrag a Porsche 
911.  Whose van can?  Cruising comfortably up to 80 or 90 miles an hour 
is not the sign of an underpowered van though.  If the US wasn;t so pissy 
about importing trucks we would have an EV syncro available here.  I'd 
buy one in a heartbeat.

Getting an extra heater added to the Winnie does sound necessary 
unfortunately.  This is not needed in the EV MV.  Only limitation I have 
is that I can;t turn on the rear A/C without turning on the front A/C.  I 
can turn the heater and or A/C on front and back as I wish outside of 
that restriction.

&gt; PS-  All of us should write to VW to inform them that we know of this
&gt; situation and what our chances are of buying a vehicle from a company that is
&gt; so insensitive.  

I do tell VW how happy I am with my EV.  Best van that I could have gotten.
