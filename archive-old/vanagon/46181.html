&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; The guys at the shop that I had take a look at the front end on
&gt; my '66 recommended that I re-bush my kingpins and linkpins.  Anyone
&gt; have any experience with this?  I had 'em replace the drag-link
&gt; and tie-rod ends but they said they don't do king/link pin work.
&gt; I've seen the assembled, rebuilt, king/link pin units sold for
&gt; $199 exchange, is this the best way to go?  Another shop in town
&gt; says they will rebuild my existing king/link pins but I haven't
&gt; got a quote yet and that shop is a little questionable IMHO.

Hello Dyer.

You would in all likelyhood be better off buying rebuilt units.

Did you know that the front end off a '68 through '71 will bolt up to 
your '66, and it will give you ball-joint front end? The ball joints are 
harder to replace, but they are lower in maintenance.

Have you adjusted your link pins???? This could improve things.

Have Fun 

Douglas
