Subject: EV brake part wanted

My husband is looking for the rear brakes shoes for our '93 eurovan.  The
local Napa store where he initially ordered them, said today that they're
back ordered back to the manufacturer.  They were getting Raylock's for
$25-28.  We then called Parts Place and they said they could get the shoes
for $44, unless of course they call back and say they're back ordered as
well.  The part number is 0813119 Beck Arnly (sp?) rear brake shoes.  Does
anyone have any other sources, preferably in the $25-28 price range, and
hopefully as soon as possible.  The mercury is ever diving lower in this neck
of the woods and with no garage, my husband spends a lot of time stretched
out on the frozen ground underneath one Vdub or another.  So we'd love to get
the job done ASAP : )
Thanks,
Cyndi
