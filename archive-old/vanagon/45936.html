To all Vanagon owners who like to camp:

I am designing tents to fit the Vanagon &amp; Bus and would like your serious
feedback.  If there is enough interest, these tents will be manufactured and
for sale via the internet and by direct sales. The first prototype is near
completion for a rear platform tent designed for non Westy Vanagons and field
testing starts later this month.  I am also working on a design for the
sliding door.  Both will be light weight, free- standing, easy to set-up &amp;
stow, bug-proof, and waterproof.  

What I need from all of you dedicated Vanagon &amp; Bus owners is all of the pros
&amp; cons of the original tents of the 60's &amp; 70's and a wish-list of features
you would like to have in your tent.  Also, tell me at what price range you
would suggest these tents to sell.

Thanks for your response!
