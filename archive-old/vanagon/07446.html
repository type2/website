Subject: Re: 009 and carb leaks

&gt;From: David Schwarze &lt;schwarze_at_superc.nosc_dot_mil&gt;

&gt;&gt; The PO 'plugged' these by putting a small section of rubber hose over 
&gt;&gt; each and then plugging the end of that hose with a screw.  In my 
&gt;&gt; never ending search to my idleing problems I was going to replace 
&gt;&gt; these and hope that it fixes what acts like an air leak.  Any ideas on
&gt;&gt; the best way to do this?  Thanks, Jim
&gt;
&gt;There are little rubber caps for this purpose.  I don't know where to
&gt;buy them but I usually get them from the junkyard.  I was never ever able

You can get those caps at race/speed/V8 shops.  They are in a vacumm 
(no pun intented) pack under the Mr Gasket/Moroso/Accel brands.
