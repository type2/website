Subject: Re: UNIX question -- vw related, sort of

you need to use a command called chmod what you need to do is something like
chmod -e -r -x. That may not be the exact syntax but to find out what you can
do is type &quot; man chmod &quot; This will give you the MANual for chmod. the idea is
that you want to give Read and eXecute access to Everyone.
