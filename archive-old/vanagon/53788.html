Subject: Rough running when Hot

Hi there,

I have a probem with my 86 Vanagon GL.  It starts right  up, even on the coldest
mornings, but when it has warmed up, it starts to misfire, running too rich,
black smoke out the exhaust, and with  no power to pull even the smallest hill. 
But when I turn the motor off and start it up again, it runs fine for awhile,
and then the misfiring starts again with the black exhaust smoke.

The vehicle had been setting for about a year, and I thought it might be bad
gasoline, but after several tanks, it still has the problem.

Any ideas as to what would cause these effects?

Charles
