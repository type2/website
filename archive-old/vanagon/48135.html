Subject: Re: Another LED application

&gt;&gt;drawing upon my degree in Ergonomics (NOT!) I would suggest a single,
&gt;&gt;bicolor LED....  yellow=low   red=high
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

&gt;You know, I'd almost swear I've run across another kind of LED--one with
&gt;only two leads that emits red if you run it one way, yellow if you run it
&gt;the other. But this seems a little impossible, if I'm to believe the folks
&gt;who've been talking about LEDs the last week or so, who I think have said
&gt;LEDs will only go one way...Maybe it was all a dream...Auntie Em! Auntie Em!

There are such LEDs Ryan, I am looking in the Saynor Varah Inc. cataolgue
(Canada) and they list 3 Bi &amp; Tri Color LEDs.  One that is a reg-green 2
lead LED and a 3 lead version.  Then there is a 3 color red-green and
yellow 3 lead LED.  The prices are not listed. Cat# 909 page 573.

No dream!
