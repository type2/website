Subject: RE: Syncro Drivers

Tom sez:
&gt;Of the numerous mountain passes we crossed last summer with the syncro 
&gt;westie , we did Colorado's Monarch pass, a little over 11,000 feet,&quot;in 
&gt;company&quot; with a non-syncro wasserboxer westie, an '87 I think. We just 
&gt;stayed together for the ten odd miles. I had the pedal to the  metal, and 
&gt;I can't believe the other driver did otherwise. So, on dry asphalt, I 

Hmmm, well my '85 1.9l panel with finished walls/roof and an early '70s
Westy interior was noticeably faster than my Syncro GL, 2.1l 7seats, had
both for a while. Upon later stuffing in the Westy gear/roof the Syncro is
performing even more sluggishly, at 7-800lb heavier than the 2WD panel.
Compression is at 120-125 all round, so it is tired. I climb the local
hills/streets with the pedal matted, at 3000RPM, in the '85 there was still
throttle left. I suspect the 2WD Westy fits where the basic Syncro GL did
for 'performance'. Weight should be similar.

&gt;Maybe it worth it to just put on chains and be able to go faster?
Maybe, up to 30MPH max. on regular chains, faster on cable type? Wouldn't
want to throw a chain off much over a crawl though really.
