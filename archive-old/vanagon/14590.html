&gt; Joel,

  Do you have any idea where this &quot;opportunity&quot; is located?

&gt; Subject: save this bus!
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine has decided to get rid of his '71 bus. He's had it
&gt; for years. I don't want to see it end up at the ecology dump, so if
&gt; anybody out there wants it, he's going to practically give it away.
&gt; The engine is in pieces, since he was going to rebuild it.  The
&gt; registration needs $40 and a smog certificate to bring it current.
&gt; I'm sure that he'd sell it for $100.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd buy it, but I already have two.
