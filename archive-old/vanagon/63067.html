&gt;First all VW cadmium coated parts rust swiftly and terribly, it is
&gt;obvious VW did no long term testing in salt laden areas.

The Cad coating is there to rust, it's a sacrificial coating. With a little
liquid wrench type stuff it should all come apart. Surface rust on the
engine steel parts can be cleaned up or replaced.
Body rust is another matter, you can try chemicals and such, but the only
way to really get rid of it is cut it out.
Rust is a fact of life here in the snow country. Get a rust free bus from
somewhere that has never seen salt (and keep it rust free!) or live with
it. IMO a rusty underside is far worse than seam rust.
