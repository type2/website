Subject: Re: VW magazines

Hi, Brett--
Hot VWs and VW Trends cater to all kinds of VWs, and I think it would be 
rare to find something pertaining to 70s era Westies in them. As far as 
all-model VW magazines go, Ben is right is saying Volksworld may be 
better (some bigger news stands will have it in stock). If you can read 
French, my favorite is Super VW Magazine, edited by Jacky Morel. Also sort 
of hard to find, but has amazing photos and great layout.

But, the top o' the heap for relevance to a '77 Westy would be LiMBO's 
&quot;The Transporter.&quot; LiMBO is a club for owners and admirers of '68 to the 
present VW vans of all years (Jim DiGennaro: does this include Sharans?)
Their newsletter is 6 times a year. Jim D. in on the List, and I'm sure 
he'll get in touch with you about how to join/subscribe.

&gt; are Hot VW's and VW Trends.  Are there others?  I would like one that has
&gt; articles that pertain to my '77 Westy.  Thanks for your thoughts on the
