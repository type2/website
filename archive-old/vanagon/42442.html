Subject: Re: 87 syncro: bushings for front drive mount

&gt;On my syncro there is about 1/8&quot; of play in the big donut shaped bushings 
&gt;that are part of the front drive mounting system. At first I thought the 
&gt;rubber had hardened and shrunk, but upon inspection the rubber is still 
&gt;pliable and seems to be in good shape. Is this play normal? Could someone 
&gt;out there with a syncro take a look and see ifyou have the same play in 
&gt;these bushings?

    I just checked my syncro,  it has about an 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; space between
the bottom washer and the bottom of the rubber bushing.  I checked with
Bentley and did'nt find a referance to play in the bushings.  The pictures
all showed bushings with out a space.
