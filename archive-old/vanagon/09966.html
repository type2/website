&gt;At one point after getting some clear sign of air bubbles, the radiator fan

&gt;while even though it was wide open. Do I have a plugged radiator?
&gt;????
&gt;Then after a while, it started coming again.

i think Don was right about the fan cooling the fluid, but it might also have
been a bit of air coming out as well ?? maybe? i.e., a large pocket of air
was just flowing out?
