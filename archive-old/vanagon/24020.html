Subject: Re: sleeping at rest stops in washington

&gt;hey everyone,
&gt;	i remember someone posting a story where somewhere in their
&gt;travels they recieved a ticket for sleeping in their camper at a rest
&gt;stop.  i've never had any problems before, but my girlfriend and i are
&gt;going to be sleeping at at least one rest stop in washington this
&gt;weekend.  anyone have any bad experiences in that state?  
&gt;
&gt;hope everyone gets at least one chance to sleep in their buses this
&gt;weekend on a wonderful trip with beautiful friends!!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;take care,
&gt;	brandy
&gt;		(and his much loved '73 camper)
&gt;
&gt;

well here is my story, not about washington but north carolina, on the two
days this summer i was &quot;touring&quot; with phish, the raieigh and gainsville
shows if anyone was there.  Between the two shows we slept at a NC rest
stop, sign read, &quot;no overnight stays&quot;, there were all years of busses and we
just parked next to a orange split window camper, and slept.  we were
awakened by the NC DMV police, a really nice guy, he knocked on the window
and said &quot;time to get up&quot;.  he proceeded to hang around and ask about where
we were from and what kind of music phish played.  he seemed very
sympathetic to all us longhaired, road-whearied concert goers....

my 2 cents..
