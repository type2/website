Subject: RE: WTB: 73 Bus seats with headrest (Connectiuct area)



&gt;
&gt;&gt;Do Vanagon seats have the same rail spacing as breadloaf vans? 


&gt;I believe the 68-73 rails are the same, but then the rails change 
&gt;in 74. Not sure if your vanagon seats will work on 74-79 buses, 
&gt;though.

I gave a pair of '78 seats from my soon-to-be-history parts bus to 
a friend to put in his '71.  The rails on his '71 do NOT match the 
'78 seat rails, so he will have to do some modifying to make the 
seat fit :(
I once tried to put a pair of plaid seats from a '77 chrome yellow 
Westy into an identical '76 Westy and the rails were also 
different.  This raises a question as to when the change actually 
occurred.  Perhaps in '77?  Or perhaps there were two changes?
