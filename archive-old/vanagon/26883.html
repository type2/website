&gt; I'm curious.  I bought my first new GL in 1986 (an '86) and over the next
&gt; five years  I experienced 4 gas tank implosions. At 30k, 34k, 48k, and 55k
&gt; miles.  The thing just sucked inself flat as a pancake each time and left
&gt; my family stranded in various parts of the country.  VW offered no
&gt; explanation but did replace the tank each time.  Has this happened to
&gt; anyone else?

I experienced one on a '70's Rabbit Diesel. Turned out to be a squashed 
vent, pipe (I lived down gravel roads those days, musta ate a big rock). 
When you opened the gas cap you'd get a &quot;SHLURP!&quot; if you changed altitude
majorly (which I did frequently). Finally it imploded.
