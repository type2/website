Subject: Re: electrical goofiness FIXED!!! :) :) :)

&gt;Someone else (I forgot who) wrote and told me to make sure the fuses
&gt;were OK.  So I go to the parking lot with the intent of cleaning up fuses
        &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;car that does not work is connected to fuse #2.  Get under fuse box and
&gt;pull #2 fuse (which still looks fine by the way) and lo and behold it is
&gt;broken!  I couldn't tell by looking at it but when I pulled it the bottom part

        Oops. I didn't follow this thread as I don't have a '78. However, I
once replaced the brain in my '82 Suzuki GS850 (RIP), to the tune of
$140-used; then found out it was a fuse that *looked* fine, but had rusted
to hell in the back where I couldn't see it. Pulled the fuse and it fell
apart in my hand. Oops. Felt real smart after replacing the brain. So
nowadays the *very first thing* I check is the 10 cent fuses. Anyway, sorry
I didn't post this in time for you, maybe someone else can benefit.

Peace,
