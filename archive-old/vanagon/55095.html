Subject: Re: side mirrors

     I just spent an hour or so dismantling my mirror on my '85 westy.  It is a 
     very straight forward job.
     
     Remove the mirror by unscrewing the two screws.
     
     Inside you will find a nut securing a hefty spring.  I suppose under ideal 
     conditions that by tightening or loosening this nut you will affect the 
     amount of force required to adjust the mirror(when it is attached to the 
     van).  However, mine was pretty rusted up and the plate that the spring 
     rests on was firmly rusted to the shaft that the nut threads onto so that 
     no amount of increased force on the spring had any effect on the mirror 
     adjustment.
     
        My next step will be to patiently try to work the plate and shaft apart.

Hi Volks,

We have an 85 Westy and in very strong winds the drivers' side 
mirrror slowly moves into the side of the van, making it very 
interesting during lane changes.  Is there any way to tighten it up 
or do we have to buy a new mirror?
thanks,
Karen in London, Oh.
