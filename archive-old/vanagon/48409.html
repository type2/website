Subject: Re: Instument pod frame Failure

Thanks for the plastic dissertation John. It is best hearing it from a hands
on eperience...and it makes logical sense for &quot;planned obsolescence&quot;....after
sending my post regarding the pod breakage several days ago ,I had a chance
to visit a local Portland German auto salvage wrecking yard that had 6
vanagons on the lot.Well out of all these vans from 1980-1986 only on had a
pod without broken guage screw bosses....so...I guess it wasnt operator error
with a makita screw gun after all....or spilled brake fluid....possibly your
hypothesis re: plastic breakdown is right on.Anyway thanks for the insight.I
havent been able to locate a replacement pod(BTW: must be from 1985 on)
therefore I must submit to:
When in doubt...Duck It!
