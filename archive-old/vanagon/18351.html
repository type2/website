Subject: PARTS??





I recently purchased an '83 Vanagon (cheap) for parts.
As I only needed the windshield and the center seat, I
find that I seem to have a few extra parts.  Before I
send it to the boneyard, I thought that I could offer
any other parts to Vanagon list readers.  So, if you 
need something, drop me a line and I might be able to
help you out.

It is:

'83 Vanagon GL
1.9 wasserboxer (toasted, but more or less complete)
auto trans (ugh!)
air conditioning (maybe why the engine's toast?)
blue on blue paint
blue interior (excellent condition)

It is located in NE Oregon.
