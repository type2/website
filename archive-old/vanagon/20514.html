The above will all probably show at Lakeport.  I plan (and have
made reservations) to camp at the fairgrounds on Saturday nite, since
the bulk of activity on this Volksfest is Saturday, even more on on
Sunday, so I thought it would be good to be close.  Anyway, the fairgrounda
are apparently only about 4 blocks from the lake.  

I'd like to camp somewhere other than the fairgrounds on Friday night -
perhaps something more in the line of like a state park or so (it
had just BETTER have showers!  :).  Anyway, does anyone know this area?
Can you make suggestions for a place to camp there for Friday nite?

Another possibility:  we could all meet at the brewery in Hopland
at a designated time on Friday afternoon or evening, and go from there
and choose something as a group, hoping to find some space for all of
us....
