    Your wasting time and money. Just change your oil regularly
    and the motor will take a beating. My long lost love is proof!

&gt; Volks,
&gt; I am not a Petrochem Eng, but converse frequently with same. I and
&gt; others covered this subject adequately about a year ago and that thread
&gt; should be in the archives. Nevertheless, in a nutshell: Synthetic engine
&gt; oil, ester or polyolefin based oils do not break down in the standard
&gt; sense of the word. Primarily they do not oxidize or combine with 02
&gt; (air) and thereby breaking down thier long chain molecular structure.
&gt; Mineral based oils have a natural affinity to break down molecularly
&gt; with merely the exposure to air and even light. This is why they are
&gt; bottled in light proof containers. Mineral based oils will &quot;emulsify&quot;
&gt; with water as well forming acid. Your engine crankcase has water in it
&gt; in the form of droplets from the outside humidity number that condense
&gt; overnight as the engine cools. Synthetic oils do not mix, or emulsify
&gt; with water and therefore acids will not form.
&gt; Since syn oils don't break down in combination with oxygen and don't
&gt; make acid as they interact with engine moisture, the viscosity improvers
&gt; last much longer on the multi-vis oils.
&gt; Additionally, syn oil's film strength is superior in all ways to
&gt; mineral, that is synthetic oil's ability to keep two pieces of metal
&gt; from touching each other under pressure and being exposed to heat.
&gt; Bottom line, pay for the synthetic. I have been running Royal Purple
&gt; synthetic 10w30 in my 87 GL for nearly a year. It does make the engine a
&gt; little louder as it is less viscous. However the film strength protects
&gt; the engine much better, and the lower viscosity allows the engine to
&gt; develop measurably more power and a slight gain in fuel economy.
