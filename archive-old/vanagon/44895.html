Subject: Cheap CVs (was: Re: CV Joints)

I bought CV joints from Trans-form for my '71.  They were billed as &quot;heavy
duty&quot;, were realtively cheap, and have worked fine.

You (all of you) may want to look into Axle Express.  They seem to be a
chain and sell mainly to shops, but will sell to individuals.  They tend to
sell whole axles for a little more than a single CV joint and warantee it
FOREVER!!!  I bought 2 axles for my '87 GTI and was very impressed with the
quality and service.  The branch I delt with is Berkshire CV/ Axle Express
in New Lebanon, NY.

They have a 800 number but I don't have it handy right now.  Email me if
you want it.  They do mail order.

However, I don't know if they have bus/van axles nor do I know how much
they will charge (GTI axles cost $99) but the axles come assembled and
prelubed!

That in itself justifies buying the whole axle, I HATE lubing cv joints!
