Subject: Re: out of sight



I'm also interested in this matter of privacy.  My first hack at is gonna
be to visit one of those home improvement places for a I think its called
an oilcloth.

The doohicky is basically the spring loaded window shade you pull down, and
then the spring function jerks it back up. With a little hardware mod I
think I can attach the big end to the seat back and the small end to the
tailgate.  They are available in custom colors and sizes. Let me know if
somebody's been here and done it. In my mind it seems like the give and
spring arrangement will let you open the tailgate, give mode, then rewind
when you close it.  HEY you kids stop jumping on that privacy cover its not
a toy!!! Well you get the idea.

&gt;&gt;I use the clothes closet.  It isn't always convenient since it has a very
&gt;&gt;narrow opening but it gets a briefcase or purse out of sight.  I would
&gt;&gt;welcome a better option but without too much fuss.
