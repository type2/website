Subject: Re: Installing engine seal on '77

Hey now, Bradley...
  Don't drop the engine ! The seal sure looks big for such a small crack,
but it's very compressible and you can squeeze it in there real easy. Might
be a problem if you wouldn't have that access hatch, but your 77 does. Just
squeeze the thing in there till it feels right, then check the other
side from below the engine. If at the end it turns out to be an inch or so
short (as it did in my case) you can sorta pull a little over the whole
length of the thing and that'll give you the extra inch...
  hope this helps...
Breadloaf on !

&gt; Subject:    Installing engine seal on 77
&gt; Being kinda new to these type
IV engines.... I have no idea how this
&gt; thing goes on.  The bus didn't have one when I got it, so I got a new one
&gt; from RMMW.  But it looks like rather difficult to put the seal in.  Do I
&gt; have to drop the engine a little?
