Subject: Last Word in Head Gaskets 



    Head Gaskets-- The last word!

    If Anyone reads this list for a month or so one thing that is
    clear is that VW had Head Gasket problems. Vanagon 2.1, golf Desial,
    Jetta etc., they all had problems. The biggest misconception that
    I feel is not told or understood is that the problem was isolated 
    to VW. Many Auto manufactures also have this problem. I have been 
    working in a Garage for 7 years, part time. We have replaced 
    many Head Gaskets, but not 1 on a Vanagon. Recently we broke a 
    record, for our shop. 8 in 1 week, all on GM Cars. After talking 
    to the night time mechanic, (he works at a Chevy dealer during 
    the day) he proposed that the problem started to acure, when the 
    heads on engines became, dissimillar medal to the block. So I 
    asked him, how many head gaskets had he changed. He said &quot;At least 
    100 a year, It's the biggest money maker for the dealer repair shop 
    ever. I can do a 9 hour head gasket job in 3 hours&quot;, he said. I 
    thought to myself and asked &quot;how did you learn that?&quot; His response
    was &quot;I have it down to and exact science. I know exactly what has 
    to come off, what has to be replaced, and even how long the new 
    gasket will last.&quot; He even said he had replaced the same head 
    gasket on the same car 4 time over a 6 years. I asked &quot;what did 
    the customer think? He said &quot;We charge the customer 1/2 price
    and everyone is happy, the job has become as routine as changing
    brakes&quot;. Then I asked &quot;I wonder what the problem is with Vanagons&quot;
    His reply- &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;There is safety in numbers&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; . 

    Conclusion: Your Vanagon does not have any more head gasket 
    problems then anyone else. VW of America sales screwed us 
    good. They must be fat and happy. Without quantities of 
    knowledgable people Vanagon owner pay full prices for repairs. 
    Parts became single sourced, witch leads to higher prices.
