Just got a good price on 195's and had just about decided to go with them
$265 installed, Michelin XCH4 6 ply  (c rated)

You think 205's?

Are you in the DC area?

As to the door:
The dealer did the recall some time ago.  Could the problem resurface?  

Someone told me to spray a can of WD 40 in there.  Will do very soon, and let
you know.

BTW,
That recall info post was probably a little long for some people.
