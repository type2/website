So Edmund A. Hintz says:
&gt; 
&gt;         How about:
&gt; Check my pulse, it don't change
&gt; Stay 72, without PROPANE
&gt; 
&gt;         or:
&gt; Cold iron shackles, ball &amp; chain
&gt; Listen to the whistle of the ol' PROPANE
&gt; You know you're bound to wind up dead
&gt; If you don't head back to Tennesse Jed
&gt; 
&gt;         and:
&gt; Just a tank of PROPANE, wind &amp; water,
&gt; Believe it if you need it if you don't just pass it on...
&gt; 
&gt;         ok, last one:
&gt; You're PROPANE, I bet you think this song is about you...
&gt; 
&gt;         Allright, exile me now for the non-VW content...   ;-)  ;-)  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Peace,

You forgot:

  Travelin' that train, high on Propane.
  Makes no difference, what's your speed.

  (apologies to the Dead Heads, and condolences too)
