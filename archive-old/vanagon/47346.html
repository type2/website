&gt; I am looking at an '87 Vanagon GL to buy.  Everything seems great except the
&gt; following:
&gt; 
&gt; Idles low (to me) about 700-800 RPM.  After 5 minutes of hgwy driving the oil
&gt; light came on when it was at idle (with the AC on).  I have had several
&gt; Jettas and 70% of them have had problems with oil pressure sending system.
&gt;  Ie problem with the pressure sender not the pressure.  Is this a common
&gt; problem with Vanagons or is there really a problem with the oil pressure in
&gt; this one??
&gt; 
&gt; Please reply direct ASAP.  Thanks!!!!!!

Idle specs for 87 are: 880 +/-50 rpm, with everything off (ie: a/c) 
Although if idle stabilizer is working, it should keep idle steady 
even with a/c on.

Check weight of oil &amp; type of filter - 10w30 oil in summer, combined 
with FRAM or other non-VW filter can lead to low oil pressure. Two 
cases I've seen like this were solved by 20w50 oil and/or VW filters, 
although problem never occurred at idle, usually at around 2000rpm 
while decelerating. (The dynamic oil pr. sensor kicks above 2000rpm 
if pressure is .9 bar or less) 
Assuming warning system is working, you'd have less than .3 bar 
(4.4psi) of oil pressure at idle for the light to come on.
I suppose a low idle, combined w/ light oil non-vw filter could do 
this, but I'd check this carefully. 
How many miles on engine?
