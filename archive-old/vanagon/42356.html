Hi Paul,

&gt;Also another question: my Westfalia has a Limited Edition plaque on each of
    
&gt;the front doors. Was there a Wolfsburg Limited Edition Westfalia produced or
   
&gt;was my vehicle an aftermarket conversion of a Vanagon Limited Edition?
         

According to my files, there wasn't a Westfalia WLE in '89.  There was one
based on the standard Vanagon, either in all white or a medium metallic blue
(and this treatment included the bumpers for a change!).  Back when I worked
in the parts department at my local VW dealer, we couldn't keep these things
in stock, since people were sticking them on any VW they could find.  I
managed to resist the temptation, but a few of my friends didn't, so the
world ended up with a few hybrids like the '64 WLE Beetle and the '67 WLE
Karmann Ghia...

Best regards,
Ryan
