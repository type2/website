Subject: a veritable Horn 'O Plenty of manuals


Listees,
Several of you responded to my offer for copies of the Dometic fridge 
manual that came w/my '83.5 Westy.  When I dug it up, I also found the 
original manuals for the stove and factory Heidleburg SCS &quot;Hideaway&quot; 
pullout radio (this manual tells you how to &quot;disarm&quot; the code protection, a 
useless feature in a pullout, unless there is satisfaction in knowing 
that your stolen radio cannot be used!).  If you have this 
equipment and want the manuals, let me know and I'll get you a copy.

'83.5 Westy (Kermit)
'69 280 SE (Miss Piggy)
