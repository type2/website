&gt; Not an EE, but I do believe you could buy many of these chargers and link 
&gt; them together for more juice. Make yourself a solar-poptop and angle it 
&gt; toward the sun in the afternoon. Though JCW has some good gadgets, go to a 
&gt; real solar power dealer and discuss a serious system... it will probably be 
&gt; cost-prohibitive, but a cool goal to save for?

You could link the chargers together, but I think by the time you got a
decent amount of current, you would have spent more than if you had just
bought a large panel to begin with.  Solar Electric here in San Diego
has a pretty good deal on used panels, which I (and Sami Daklia) bought
into last summer.  8 amps at 16 volts, approximately.  Now THAT'S
amperage!  :-)  Details should be available in the archives by looking
for keywords such as &quot;solar&quot;, &quot;panel&quot;, etc.
