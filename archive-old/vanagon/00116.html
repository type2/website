]&gt; Joel querries as to what what a Kombi is...

Actually, I think I started this whole mess with a question to Joel.  Now
that I've seen a whole slew of answers, I'm glad I did.  It's become ob-
vious that I'm not the only one confused.  I don't know any more about
what constitutes a Kombi now than I did at the start, but I now know I'm
not alone in my ignorance.
 
]&gt; I believe that Kombi is short for Kombination...at least in the
]&gt; early busses, Kombi's were one step higher in the model range
]&gt; than the plain, window-less delivery van. They had three windows
]&gt; on either side of the passenger compartment, usually cloth seats
]&gt; and trim.
]&gt;
]&gt; The idea for the kombi was that you could use it as a delivery vad
]&gt; oops van during the week and use it as a family car on weekends.
]
]	My manual for my old 72 westy showed the kombi as the step between
]the 7pass and the westy.  It showed a van that had a rear seat that folded
]into a bed but, looked more like the regular seats than the westy rear
]seat.  I always thought that it was a kombination of 7pass and camper.

This is as believeable as any other explanation I've seen, but it's con-
tradictory to the earlier message that surmised that a Kombi was somehow
LESS than a 7-passenger and closer to a bare van.

Does anyone REALLY know?
