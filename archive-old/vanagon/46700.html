Subject: A Friendly Wave -- Vanagon to Splitty!!!!

For the second time ever a vanagon driver waved at me
this weekend !!

But it was a &quot;sano-bitchin'&quot; (did I get that right?) one -- black,
slammed, tinted windows (they flashed their lights, couldn't
see in to check for a wave), etc.  

hee hee!
