&gt;My advice to anyone with an older bus is to check the hinge *before* it
&gt;breaks, because it will be much easier to fix if it isn't already broken.
&gt;I am still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it looks like
&gt;drilling it out and running a bolt through the hinge is my best option,
&gt;without actually removing the entire hinge.

I bought four new hinges for my '73 PickUp, they cost the equivalent
of 25 to 30 US dollar each _at_ the dealer.

Brian.
