Subject: Re: ?? Power for stereo in my '86 Vanagon 
Date: Mon, 18 Mar 96 12:59:20 -0800

&gt;    I replaced the stereo in Vanagon this weekend, and all works
&gt; well except... it's not switched with the ignition.  The previous
&gt; radio was always enabled, and I tried to correct it.  I don't have
&gt; the wiring diagram for the Vanagon, so here's my puzzle:

Part of the problem is that you're correcting a non-existent problem. VW
radios are designed to not be switched with the ignition. They do, however,
have a line that turns on the radio lights when the van's lights are on.
I believe THAT line is the blue/blue on your diagram.

You'll have to go a long way to find switched power in there.
