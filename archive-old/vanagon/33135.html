&gt; Yes I am looking down the hatch, it helps but the distributor is still

&gt;  earlier models without the hatch maintain there mental calm.  I guess 
&gt;  my big complaint is that the upright have every thing out in the open 
&gt;  to work on, and it seems that the later motors hide or place 
&gt;  components in positions that are awkward to work on or even observe.

The distributor on the type IV is really simple to work on.  Just
unfasten one 13mm nut using a ratchet and extension, and pull that bad
boy outta there.  Then change/set points and condensor, or what have
you, and reinstall.  The only things you have to worry about are
dropping the nut that holds the dist. down (put a piece of tape in your
socket so the nut sticks in it) and getting dirt in the hole where the
distributor goes.  I tend to keep this area real clean because I pull
the distributor a lot.  You can't screw up, because the distributor only
goes in one way.  You don't even have to worry about where the rotor
was.  Double check the point gap after installation by leaving the cap
off, and turning the alternator pulley with a crescent wrench until the
points are all the way open.  Then measure with a feeler gauge.
