&gt; 2) Intermittent hesitation durin long trips (appears to be a miss caused by
&gt; plug wires shorting to the engine? or a bug in the &quot;brain&quot;?)3) pop top

&gt; a short period of time) That is all I can think of now, maybe more later.

as to the overheating on long idles, I believe the problem with my '85 is
that the cooling fan situated over the spare tire is inoperative.

I have yet figured out how to fix it though.
