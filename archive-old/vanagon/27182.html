Subject: Buyers tips

Hi.
I posted a message this morning concerning buying a 198? Vanagon - I have
sort of decided to confine my search to 1986 on Vanagons.
I am going to see several in San Diego in the morning - if anyone has any
tips on what to look for in the pre purchase inspection, please let me know (
ie. typical weaknesses of the Vanagon etc) and how much to pay?
Thanks again for any advice!
Cheers MIKE
