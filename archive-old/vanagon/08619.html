&gt; OK so by that logic (to play devil's advocate) no. 1 should also run hot,
&gt; because in the suitcase engine the fan is smack dab in the middle and the
&gt; two rear cylinders even if they are staggered are equidistant from the fan
&gt; and the exit as well....

No, they are not equidistant.  They are staggered in the horizontal plane.
#3 is the furthest from the fan, followed by #1, #4, and #2.

&gt; 			   I am wondering if the foklore about no. 3 carried
&gt; over to all air-cooled engines regardless of design, and I would believe
&gt; if I hadn't also heard about strengthening/welding no.3 cylinder in Vanagon
&gt; engines because of  some weak point.....another myth?    DC

I haven't heard of this.  The only thing I heard was that #3 was retarded
with the 009 distributor to make it run cooler.  What a lame thing to do,
IMO.  The decreased power output of the retarded cylinder probably caused
more wear from imbalance.  Boy do I feel like the grinch today...
