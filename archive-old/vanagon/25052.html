&gt;Help!  I've been looking forever and can't find one.  I'm in the Wash DC
&gt;area and there is no lack of cars or people.  You'd think they'd be
&gt;advertised more often.  Any suggestions on sources or techniques would be
&gt;greatly appreciated.  I'm shooting for a '78 bus (this seems to be the best
 &gt;of the 70's type II from what I can tell).


 How about:


 VOLKSWAGON--'74 BUS,Strong engine, good interior, needs minor work $1000 obo
 543-1044

 VW--'66 Panel Van Very rare customized, looks &amp; runs good, rebuilt engine, lots
 of new parts, current inspection. $2,500 neg; Call 244-2337, after 5pm.

 These are both down in the Virginia Beach area. You can check want ads there
