Subject: 1983 stalls

Hope this is the right place to direct question.  My 1983 Vanagon has 
an intermittent starting problem.  Just turns over but no start.  If I 
pull the fuel relay switch it starts, then just as it dies for lack of 
fuel I insert the relay and away we go.  Doesn't stall on the road but 
this is annoying.  I have had the relays and fuel pump checked ane 
they are fine.  Mechanic says time for new injection CPU, but that's 
$400.  Any suggestions?
