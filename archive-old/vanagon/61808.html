Subject: '86 running rich &amp; other probs (HELP!)
Date: Tue, 24 Jun 1997 08:09:05 -0400

Hi Volks, 

Well, the rich running '86 is back :-(  

The symptoms started to show again as slightly reduced power and gas
mileage, progressed to hard starting, and further progressed to what seems
to be a fuel delivery problem. It will start but will take no gas. You can
sit there with the pedal down for about 15-20 secs, it will slowly come to
life, billow a bit of black smoke, and then it's ok. I think I can hear the
fuel pump whining, but I'm not sure I'm being over-sensitive. I pulled the
plugs (6 month old platinums) and they are BLACK.

A little background info...

We bought this '86 for my wife early this year aware of it's problems, the
main being running very rich. After much help and discussion from the list,
the 02 sensor was replaced with a generic new Bosch unit, a couple other
sensors were also replaced but the names of which are escaping me (fuel
pressure??), and finally the ECU was replaced with a used one (found out
the old one was fried when the PO washed the engine, assumed this to be the
origin of all the problems?).  The van has run great until previously and
braved several long trips with many Melanie's students. It's now Summer and
she's not teaching, leaving me with some time to fix it right. Well, a
little time anyway :-)

Oh, I forgot to mention that the idle stabilizer is currently unplugged as
it's bad as well. Haven't had the time (or courage?) to slice into it and
fix it as described by several listees.

So.... where to start???

Any advice at all appreciated!
