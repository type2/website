Subject: Thanks!!!!!  I Bought One!!!!!!

I just wanted to say a BIG THANKS to all of you who sent me lots of ideas,
information and advice on buying a used VW Camper Van.  I cannot tell you how
much your help has meant to me.

I just bought a '86 Westfalia with 66K miles on it put on by the original
owner.  We bought it for under $10K here in Calif.   It is in great shape and
I just love it.  We are going to take it on its first camping trip with my
family this Thursday.

I just wanted to say thanks for all your help.  What a great group of people
you all are!

Thanks again!

Rhonda :-)
