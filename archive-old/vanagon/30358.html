&gt; Well I finally found this list.  I heard about it from a windsurfing mailing 
&gt; list as we were discussing great vehicles for lugging around all the gear we 
&gt; need.
&gt; 
&gt; I own a '88 Westfalia (burgundy) with about 120k miles.  I would consider my 
&gt; relationship with this brick as love/hate.  I use it alot for camping, 
&gt; windsurfing, and commuting.  I live in the Boston area.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a few issues you may be able to help me with.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I'm losing the gasket around the pop top.  Where is the best place to get a 
&gt; new one and is it easy to install?
&gt; 

Hi Paul,

I got a new seal from a truck canopy manufacturer.  It is a 90 degree 
bulb molding and it works great.  It cost me $3.00/foot.  You will 
need about 32 feet in order to do the entire canopy including 
non-popup portion over driver and passenger seats.  It took me about 1 
hour to take the old, deteriorated one off, clean fibreglass with 
soapy water, and put the new seal on.  The seal has aluminum teeth that
 attach quite nicely to the canopy.  Aluminum means that it won't rust 
like the original.

I have not had any problems since I put it in.  In fact, I think it 
seals better than the original at a fraction of the cost.

Cheers
Tony
