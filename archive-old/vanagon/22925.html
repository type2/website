&gt;Well Hello all there is a crazy little bus
&gt;Down here near Carbondale, Ill. It has the entire mid section torched 
out and
&gt;Lokks quite functional.

[SNIP]

Forgive me, but I have a minor quibble -- if the bus has had its height 
shortened by taking a slice out of it horizontally so that the roof is 
closer to the floorboards, it's been &quot;chopped&quot;.  If it had its length 
shortened by taking a slice out vertically so that the front bumper is 
closer to the back bumper, it's been &quot;sectioned&quot;. If it had its height 
shortened by having the body lowered on the frame so that the frame is 
the same distance from the pavement but the lower edge of the body is 
closer to the pavement, it's been &quot;channelled&quot;.  If it had its length 
shortened by pushing the whole vehicle at high speed against a large 
object, it's been &quot;crashed&quot;.
