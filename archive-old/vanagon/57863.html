&gt; It should seem too much of an oddity.  Here in Portland, I regularly 
&gt;       see EV Westfalia's on the road.  I even saw one in North Carolina 
&gt;       about 4 months ago.
&gt;       I'm quite sure they are westy's and not the winnie conversion.  The 
&gt;       westfalia logo on the pop top is usually pretty indicative.
&gt;       It doesn't seem incoceivable that whoever is buying them in Canada
and 
&gt;       driving them across the border would sell one once in a while.  Maybe

&gt;       even way down in PA.

It seems highly likely that these are the 1993 (+other years?) Eurovan MV
Weekender models that came with the pop-top (by Westfalia) but without the
sink/stove stuff, and had seating for 7.
