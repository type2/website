Subject:      Syncro ride height info needed

Hi Everyone.  I wonder if I can impose on Syncro owners for a favour.
I need to know the ride height of the van to determine if the springs
on our van has sagged.  This spec doesn't seem to be readily
available in Bentley or other forms, so I thought I could compile a
list of everyone's specs, and make them available to the list for
future reference.  Please indicate if Westy or passenger van, or
panel van.  Again, this information is for Syncro's only.

Derek's article on Syncro alignment had a method to measure this.  If
this can be followed, and reported back to me, I'll track the
responses.  I measured in cm, but inches are fine as well.

&quot;The measurement is taken by measuring the distance between the
wheelwell and the center of the wheel.&quot;

I just measured to the centre of my hubcaps.

 right front   46.5 cm (this measurement is correct!)
 right rear    45.5 cm

 left front      45.0 cm
 left rear       45.0 cm

 Our van is currently loaded for camping with full propane, food,
and full tank of fuel.    Just missing us, water, and some clothing,
and fresh foods.

Your help is appreciated.
Harry
