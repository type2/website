Subject: Welding problems

OK, I know that this is not directly on subject, but
it relates, trust me.

I have been the proud owner of a Lincoln 100 MIG welder for
the last 5 months. Great machine.

Recently I converted it to MIG operation, and put the gas bottle
on it, etc. (HINT: The $20 hand truck from Harbor Frieght makes a 
better welding cart than the $100 cart that they offer, and it
collapses into the back seat of the bug)

My problem: I cant get the .023 wire to feed. I flipped the roller 
over, but it is a smooth groove, and the wire wont pull through
because the spool nut self-tightens as it feeds the wire.
It is disasterous to have the machine stop feeding the wire while 
welding.

If anybody else out there has experience with the same model, 
please write me back. I am anxious to get cracking on the
structural metal of the Fastback, and the Gas welding is 1000%
better than the flux core.

Thanx.
