FYI,

I know it's not original VW glass, but today I'm having a new front
windshield installed for $145 on the '85 rustfalia. That includes removing
the old cracked windshield, installing the new one and the price of the
windshield! I bought a new seal from Kyle Wade at Volksmotorsports for
$40!!!

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; OK, found a windshield for my '81 locally, used with a couple of very
&gt; small rock chips.  Came from a local junkyard/used parts house.
&gt;
&gt; It came out of an early water-cooled Vanagon, and it is original VW
&gt; glass, as evidenced by the symbol on the lower left corner of the glass.
&gt; My current cracked windshield is PPG.
&gt;
&gt; It had a really crappy tint strip at the top, which was halfway off, so
&gt; I scraped it off the rest of the way, it came off surprisingly easy, and
&gt; even more surprising, the leftover adhesive wiped away with Windex.
&gt;
&gt; The VA inspection sticker left some tough residue, tho, but a couple
&gt; squirts of WD-40 and that stuff practically dissolved!  I'm never buying
&gt; Goo-Gone again, WD-40 works a ton better :-)
&gt;
&gt; And the price was OK, about $100 cheaper than new, so I'm happy.
&gt;
&gt; I will be installing it tomorrow, looks like a nice day for it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to everyone for their help.
&gt;
