So James Brill says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a friend who has an '85 Vanagon that has the stalling problems 
&gt; I have heard talked about here before.  It will lose power and 
&gt; die while driving down the highway.  After letting it sit awhile and 
&gt; much scratching of the head it will start up and run fine.  Now I seem
&gt; to remember that this was some kind of wiring harness problem.  If I am
&gt; right, which wire is it?  If I am remembering this incorrectly please 
&gt; do help me out.  Thanks, Jim
&gt; -- 

Well, if yer referring to the old stalling on the long drive at constant
speeds, then you are referring to Technical Bulletin # 92-01 Vanagon 
Intermittent Misfire which is for all Vanagon Digifant Fuel Injection
Engines.  So I'm not sure if your friends is the same problem or not.
Joel can probably give some input for older vans.

The wiring harness you refer to is the part no. 025 906 302.  I still
haven't got it yet even though I've experienced the problem.  This is 
probably because of the cost and the fact that when it happens, you
are not really in any 'dire straits' (great group BTW).  All you have
to do is stop the car, turn it off and then turn it back on again.  
This is a procrastinators dream. You don't really have to fix it.  
Just do a short stop, shut down, then go again.  I wonder how many 
people out there have had their cars towed because of this one when 
all they had to do is the above?  Thanks to this list and the bulletin, 
I'm in-the-know.  Oh well, the harness is connected between the air-
flow sensor on the top side of the air cleaner and the original harness 
plug to the air-flow sensor.  Be sure to disconnect the battery before 
doing this replacement work.
