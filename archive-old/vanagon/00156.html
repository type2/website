&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just test drove an 86 Vanagon today.  I must say that I was amazed how
&gt; quiet, powerful, and otherwise well-behaved it seemed to me, compared to 
&gt; my old 77 Westfalia.  I am considering getting one of these vehicles sometime
&gt; soon, but I am wondering what the wisdom is regarding the ability of Vanagons
&gt; to keep their passengers healthy during a crash.  Other that going and looking
&gt; up old Consumer Reports ( which would tell me to go buy a new Honda Refrigerator
&gt; (TM)), I don't really no where to turn for this info.  Any help you can give
&gt; would be appreciated.

I believe that according to government tests that the driver will have massive
injuries or death.  I can't remember what it was for the passenger.  When I go
to junk yards I sometimes look at wrecked vehicles to see how they are
contructed and what damage they have taken.  I have yet to see a wrecked
Vanagon.  This brings up an interesting note.  In Autoweek magazine, sometime
ago, they had a list of vehicle accident rates and the Vanagon had the
second lowest rate.  (I think the lowest was the Volvo station wagon.)
It probably got this ranking due to its large size and slower speeds and that
most Vanagon drivers are mature experienced drivers.  
 
&gt; BTW, here's the deal on the Vanagon I tested:  115K, clean inside and very little
&gt; rust,  no records, but the clutch feels good, and it looks like there has been no
&gt; head work.  Also, it has a new water pump.  The place wants $3995, but I already

Our Vanagon is on its third water pump.  Water pump replacement is normal it
seems.   

&gt; know that I could have it for $3100, or $2000 if I trade in my Audi Coupe (83,
&gt; with 135K).  How does this compare to deals you have gotten?

That price seems reasonable from what I see in the local papers.
