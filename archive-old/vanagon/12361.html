i said:
&gt; &gt;Many groups of things with breakdown potential (Norton owners for
&gt; &gt;example) publish a 'guide' of members who are willing to have their
&gt; &gt;name, address, and phone number listed.  This can serve a couple
&gt; &gt;functions: 

then Sami said:
&gt; Good idea, but it's already being implemented. Neato and Limbo have their
&gt; list and Funkengroovin is also trying to put one up, I believe. Unless you
&gt; prefer a internet-geek list only... 

so i say:
hmmm, i didn't realize that.  jeez, am i going to have to join them, 
too?  :)  

maybe a internet-geek list only would be good.  while it may be a 
false impression, we know a little about some of us and i would 
rather call on a list member since that is whom i'm familiar with.
