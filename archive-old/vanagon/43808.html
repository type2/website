Subject: bungee cords, duct tape...

	When I was a kid we got a 100-150 feet of some kind of
black rubber cable at the dump- would tie a loop around the fireplug
at the McNamaras house and the other end to the gooseneck on 
a bicycle, stretch it back a couple of houses and let go. Nowhere
near as interesting as it sounds, but still fun.

	Must be close to Friday anyway :)
