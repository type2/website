Subject: push rod tubes...

Transaxle's in, engine's in.  I damaged the push rods on #2 cylinder using
my dual sissor jack-floor dolly config.  Thought fer sure I'd bent the push
rods. Didn't.  However, I'd feel better replacing the smushed tubes.   Muir
sez you don't have to pull the head to replace the PR tubes.  Do I have to
de-torque the head and pull it off slightly to pull/replace the PR tubes.

Thanx agin

christian
