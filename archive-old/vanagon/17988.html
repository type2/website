Subject: ALCAN Highway Info???

 I will be driving from Anchorage to Colorado in mid-June.  I only have a
 week so there won't be much time for sightseeing.  I will most likely be
 taking route 97 to Prince George, B.C. and then route 93 through the
 Jasper, Yoho, Banff area.
 Any tips, recommended (or NOT recommended) routes, road condition info.,
 etc. would be greatly appreciated.  I have a VW Vanagon Camper so camping
 won't be a big issue.  Feel free to email me directly or post to
 rec.travel_dot_usa-canada.  Thanks in advance.
                                        Jon
