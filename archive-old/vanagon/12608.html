&gt;   Well, Ihave decided to spend the extra $20, and get a personalized
&gt;license plate. I have thought of some ideas, ranging from bus-related,
&gt;to just plain silly. If anyone has thought of any that I missed, or
&gt;would care to vote for your favorites, I will certainly bear all that in
&gt;mind, and alert everyone to my final choice...
