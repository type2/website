&gt;&gt; It is illegal to travel without insurance in Canada.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm... do they check?  I not insured right now, and there's only a 50/50 
&gt;chance that I will be in the next year.  But I'd like to go to Canada.
&gt;
I don't think they check at the border; it's not their job.  If you get
stopped by the police, they will check.  I have no idea if an American would
get away with a lecture, or a fine, but I suspect you're only in the doo-doo
if you get into an accident.  I'll check on the details from an 'official'
source if many people are interested.
