&gt; 
&gt; I sold a bunch of stuff on the first go-around, but then realized
&gt; that I had posted it during lots of _dot_edu folks' spring breaks.  So
&gt; here's what's left!
&gt; 
&gt; OK! Here's the list of bus parts that I have for sale.
&gt; First column is the part, second is the price (plus
&gt; shipping) and third is the year of bus that the part
&gt; will fit.  Some of the year spans I've had to guess
&gt; on- if it's a guess, it'll have a question mark.  I've
&gt; based the prices on two things- cost of the part new
&gt; and what Recycled Bugs charges for the used part.
&gt; Since I've always said their prices are high, mine are
&gt; much lower ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; As usual, all things are negotiable, but these prices
&gt; are already *really* low.  I'm also willing to work
&gt; out package deals.
&gt; 
&gt; Taillight lenses                        $20/pr.         72-79

I'd like to buy the right rear if you sell them separately...
If not, how about $15 for both?  (My reasoning is that sooner or later
I will find one in the junkyards, and they only cost $8 there, so I don't
really want to pay $20 for it...)

&gt; sliding door handle (inside,plastic)    $5              ?72-79

I want it!  I want it!!

Please let me know your address and I will send you a check or money
order for the total plus postage, in advance...

Thanks,
	-David
