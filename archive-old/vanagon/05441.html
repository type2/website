Subject: Re: Berg


I take offense at the notion that Gene Berg is the &quot;heir apparant&quot;
to John Muir. I think there is a difference here. Muir wrote a
nice, simple and classic VW repair book that has done a hell of 
a lot to keep air-cooled VWs alive. Gene Berge, IMHO, is a 
self-promoter...what ever &quot;books&quot;, hints, etc. come from him
are designed to promote the products HE sells. Granted, he
seems to know his stuff...but to use his &quot;stuff&quot; as &quot;bait&quot;
for people to buy his products doesn't qualify him, in my
book, as an &quot;heir apparant&quot; to John Muir.
