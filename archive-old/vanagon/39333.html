&gt;I disassembled my taillights today, just for the heck of it.  Strangely
&gt;enough, I found that there was a bulb missing in each taillight.  Both were
&gt;the bottom-center bulb.  There is a socket there, and a lens, but no bulb.

Room for future lamp additions I guess. No bulb is installed there.
