&gt; Sami mentioned this in a recent post:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;And, if I'm not mistaken, the 78 and
&gt; &gt;79'ers have a swiveling front passenger seat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Several people have also recently mentioned that the 79 bus had a slightly 
&gt; wider body. Were these changes made on North American models only? I have 
&gt; never seen a bay window bus that didn't have any of those panels behind the 
&gt; front seats (except when they had been chopped out by the owner) and when I 
&gt; see body panels in parts catalogues they are listed as suitable for 73 to 79 
&gt; models. This even includes the front panel, so where did the extra inches go?

  The panels behind the front seats were certainly gone , at least in the 
  Westfalia conversion, by the late '70's. I suspect it was in '76, when the
  camper layout changed. Swivelling front seats and the little front table
  were part of the dining set-up . I'll take a peek at a late 70's passenger
  bus next time I see one and look for the panels  if no-one on the list
  clears this up in the meantime.

  I think the wider bus that Sami was referring to is the Vanagon / Brick 
  which was introduced in 1979 &lt;at least in the U.S.&gt; as a 1980 model. I 
  am also confused by year of production vs. model year. The 
  &quot;VW Bus Custom Handbook&quot;, published in the U.K., talks about the Vanagon
  &lt;refers to them as &quot;Wedge&quot; buses&gt; as being a 1979 bus. Was the third 
  generation of buses introduced in Europe and the U.K. earlier than in the 
  U.S.? I think the Golf and Jetta III were.
