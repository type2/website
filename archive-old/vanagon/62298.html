Subject: Where does the power mirror switch go?

Well, I got the set of power mirrors off of Eric O's syncro for my
doublecab.  But I don't know where the switch goes on the driver's
door.  I've been looking about at all the local Vanagons for a few 
weeks and only have seen power mirrors on those driving by -- never
on the ones conveniently parked to look at.  If one of you owners
of a more deluxe VW than my set would kindly send me measurements as
to where this baby sits, I'd be mighty grateful.

On a &quot;tool find of the week&quot;, Central Computer of Santa Clara is selling
a digital tach/dwell/volt/amp/ohm meter.  Cheapo Chinese stuff at $19,
but it works, and is right handy to throw in the old tool box.  It even
has settings for 5-cylinder engines for those of you doing the Audi
transplant.  Nice large, clear display, yellow case.  The world's saddest
sounding audible-continuity meter, diode check.  Ammeter is 10A scale only.
It ain't a Fluke (but I already got one of those), but you won't feel the
hit in the wallet like a Fluke, either.  It's a 3 1/2 digit thing, like
most, with 1/2&quot; display.

Ranges: Dwell: 4,5,6, and 8 cylinder
        Tachometer for the same
        Diode check
        200 ohm, 20k, 200k ohms and 20 megaohm
        2, 20 and 200 volts DC
        10 amps DC
Model is KT-7181

Too late for Father's day.
