Subject: Sagging rear on 71 bus

The torsion bars are adjustable, they do not need to be replaced.  I'd suggest
you let a dealer or a certified mech. do it unless you are very mechanically
abled.  And, no, they would not postpone the inevitable.

 &gt; 1.) Are the rear torsion bars in a '71 bus adjustable? If not, can they
 &gt; be made so? Would this just postpone the inevitable?
 &gt; 
 &gt; 2.) How difficult is it to replace rear torsion bars in a '71 bus? Has
 &gt; anyone out there actually DONE this? Any hints or tips?
