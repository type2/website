&gt;Also, you can't rebuild a 2 liter type IV engine for $250... you'd be
&gt;lucky to get just a piston/cylinder set for that much.

I thought the man had a Type II engine in a Type IV bus. But now I'm
clearer because two people have written and explained the nomenclature to
me. One person wrote three times. It goes like this:

[T1] is not Type I at all; instead, it is a split-window Type II.

[T2] may or may not be a Type II, but it has bubble windows.

[T3] might be a Type IV or a watercooled but it is most assuredly not a
Type III.

[T4] is not a Type IV, as you might suppose--a Type IV might be either a
[T2] or a [T3] but it cannot be a [T4]. Instead, a [T4] is a front-engine
monoblock.

Evidently this was all cooked up for the purpose of MAKING THINGS CLEARER.

I am dreadfully sorry for all the consternation. I will try to do better. ;p
