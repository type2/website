Subject: Syncro fuel sys. question

     Can someone tell me where they put the fuel filter in 
     my 1986 Vanagon Syncro??? I just bought this and I think
     It's never ben replaced!


     Can I get to the sending unit with out removing the gas tank??
     the fuel guage wires look like it was remove for some reason
     and never put back on. Don't answer this it you have to remove
     the transmission and the tank.
