Subject: Looking for a Bentley Service manual
Date: Wed, 26 Feb 1997 11:23:59 -0500

Does anyone know where I could pick up a second hand service manual that
covers a 86 Vanagon GL? I am also looking for any suggestions that anyone
might have to increase my gas mileage. I have already put new plugs, wires,
cap, rotor, fuel filter, and had the fuel system set. The mechanic said
that my OXS sensor is not functioning, but also said that this won't have a
whole lot of effect after the engine is warm and that he adjusted the
system to compensate so I shouldn't need to replace it. Is this true?
