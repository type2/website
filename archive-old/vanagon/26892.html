Subject: /f acceleration

The place I'm temping has a business unit that manufactures the turbine 
engines for the Navy's Harpoon missile, and it looks like an IDEAL size 
to strap/weld onto the sides of a Transporter for vastly improved freeway 
acceleration.

The only drawback might be the $80,000 apiece price tag...
