Subject: Idle surges related to octane?

I'm curious if anyone out there's had the same minor annoyance:  We've got
a '85 Westy with 105K kms on it, auto trans.  It's been totally reliable
and doesn't use any water or oil and it has been well maintained.
Recently, it seems that if I don't run with 90+ octane gas it's idle surges
in P or N but is generally steady in any gear.  However, recently in a
crunch we put some reg 87 in it and within 5 miles it's idle was 'thumping'
even in drive while stopped at lights etc and would occasionally stall.

We rent this van out during the summer up here (BC, Can) and some renters
have complained about this supposed 'stalling' problem.  I've noticed it
sometimes but always goes away when we have it...probably because we use
better gas than the renters (even though they've been told!)  Is it just
this simple?  ...Gas?  Or should I look deeper.  After every complaint,
I've had it checked out but it always comes out without needing
adjustments.  Any help would be appreciated if I haven't already answered
the question.  TIA, Bruce
