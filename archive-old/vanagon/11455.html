Hello,

My slave leaked first.  After I replaced that, the master died within a 
month.  British Auto Parts in Phoenix had both new for about $60 each; a 
little more for one, a little less for the other.  While both looked nasty 
to get at to replace, it was quite easy, about 1/2 hour each.  Of course, 
the system had to be bled afterwards, but that was a snap as well.

$450 seems way high.
