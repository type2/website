Thanks to everyone who helped me choose which tires to get for my 1980 VW
Camper.  

I ended up getting two Vokohama Y356 6ply 185 R 14's on the rear.

I am very happy with this buy except for the size.  I would suggest anyone
getting new tires to get 195 75 14 or larger.  

When my two front tires wear out I may get 195's and have the two 185's I
just got put on the front.  I think that the larger tire would work better
on the rear.

Anyway, thanks again,

Kyle  Haskins
