&gt; Some part of my drive train (on my 65 Deluxe) is faily load as I cruise

&gt; level that I'm use to.  Aren't the reduction gears still rotating?  I 
&gt; haven't check out the manuals - but I pretty sure the trans. is indicating
&gt; a major problem is coming in the near future.  Its a loud whine/growl-
&gt; worst in 4th and under a load (going up an incline).  What trans. can be
&gt; interchanged? 60-67?  Should I switch from swing axle to post '67 IRSs?
&gt; Can I pull the transaxle w/o removing engine?  Anybody?  Thanx in advance.

IMHO, it sounds like your reduction gears.  The four bearings in them 
have behaved as per your description for me before.  They sing and grind 
the worst under a load.  I'd drain the lube out of the boxes and look for 
metallic goo.  Check for play also, but this may not clue you into the 
upper bearings' condition.

If the metallic goo is there, then R&amp;R the reduction gear bearings.  I'd 
change the gearlube in the transaxle while you're at it.  The reduction 
gears work fine if properly maintained, but there are other solutions if 
you care to swap them out, although I wouldn't recommend it.  Good Luck
