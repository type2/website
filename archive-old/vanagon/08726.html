Subject: Re: Thanks for a great evening!


	Sami, Maria, Dave, Mrs Kautz (L?), Kautz kids and cousin, Bob, 
Martha, Pat, Bradley, Bob, and Jim (Who am I missing), thank you!

	It was great to meet all of you, it was nearly as good to 
tour the assembled busses- two of each of the first three
generations! I'm going to have to get my friend Ken an Internet
connection... he and Charlotte and the baby have a Eurovan.

	Sami brought pictures of his Westie actually being used for
camping. I brought a picture of my single cab actually parked in
my driveway, and Moustache the cat.

	Martha has the coolest instrument cluster, upholstered to
match the cushons no yet, monitoring her engine- 4 VDO gauges. 
I'm totally jealous. I've got to get one for mine too.

	Bob had the oldest, '59 pickup, and I'm not sure whether Jim's
Synchro or Martha's Westie Vanagon is the newest.
	For sure, Sami and Maria came the furthest, and the Kautz's
brought the most attendees (6).

	I found out more about type IV installations in busses than
I ever knew before- I must have started college right then and had
my standard of living drop- I don't think I've ever actually
seen a type IV baywindow's engine bay before!

	Anyway, the folks I met were just as fun as you'd expect from
meeting them here in the list. And a lot of musicians! Big Sur is
going to be real fun!

	Bill
