Subject: RE: Engine replacement


&gt;a couple of weeks ago I bought my first car ever, a '71 bus, and
&gt;in very good condition for a low price. I drove the bus home...
     (snip)
&gt;Unforunately, I never got there. Along the way, the engine got
&gt;busted.


Uh, hate to say this, Edward, but I think you'll find this event
directly related to the low price you paid.



&gt;does anyone have any ideas as to what may have caused this tragedy?

My guess is, something was very wrong with the engine before you
ever laid eyes on the car-- hence the &quot;low&quot; price. Could have been
several things-- I had this happen once, and it turned out that
one side of the engine had been assembled without shims.
Compression on that side was 130# on both cyls, 110# on the other
side. The engine pinged a lot, and then blooey. Did you ever
notice any pinging in your engine?

BTW, was your oil full? VERY important in a VW!

Lastly, how were the valves on the broken side? Those on the left
side, tend to break or otherwise self-destruct, if not CONSTANTLY
adjusted correctly. They then break pistons, rods, heads, etc.


&gt;The only extra information I can give is that, when I drove away
&gt;from my house that morning, the engine didn't deliver enough power
&gt;to get the car moving at a decent speed. I solved this by briefly
&gt;flooring the gas-pedal.

We ALL do that!


&gt;I am now searching for a replacement engine case, but am getting a
&gt;little confused. Most of the shops say that I can't use a beetle
&gt;engine, because it does not have the same mounting points as a bus
&gt;case. Yesterday I talked to a bus owner, and he said that this
&gt;isn't true and I can use a beetle engine without any problems.

They're both right. &lt;groan&gt;

Upright-fan bus engines do indeed have three mounting bolts on
the pulley end of the engine, which bolt to a special extra
crossmember that only 68-71 buses have. Early beetle engines
didn't have these bolt bosses, and can't be used as is. However,
I have seen special adapter plates for these beetle engines, that
bolt to the oil pump cover, and have three properly-located holes
for the bus rear crossmember. I've heard mixed reports about these
adapter plates-- some like them, some don't.

All the 68-71 bus engines had the bosses, of course. And, I
believe, so did all bug engines after a certain year (71, I think?)
They often weren't drilled for bolts in these later bugs, but any
machine shop can remedy that for you. These later cases were
called &quot;universal&quot; cases.

Look at your old engine below the big pulley. There are three
large bolt holes to the right, left, and below the oil pump cover
(that square metal piece about 60 mm on a side, with four smaller
nuts of its own). If you can find another engine (or case) with
these holes, you're in. Earlier bug engines didn't have these,
or only had one of the three-- not enough!

Good luck-- hope you find what you need. BTW, these universal cases
can be ordered from many sources in the U.S. But, shipping to
Switzerland, may be real expensive (I'm sure you know this better
than I). Do you get the magazine Dune Buggies and Hot VWs? It
has lots of good ads, mostly from U.S. and Canadian distributors.
