re 25 hp motor for sale

        &gt;Here's one for Clara, Thom and other barndoor owners.
        &gt;I just spotted an advertisement in the swedish magazine Classic
Motor Magasin. The add &gt;describes it as a &quot;reservkraftmotor (industrial
motor) with only 100 hours usage. Sounds a bit &gt;to good to be true. Anyway,
the phone number is Sweden (in Ronneby) 70-8136891 and ask for &gt;Ingvar.

Oops, I was in such a rush to get out the door this morning that I forgot
to include the price. He's asking 3,000 swedish crowns.
