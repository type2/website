This last sentence was a very stupid thing to post.  I realize that you're
probably fairly young and don't know better, but take some advice.  This is
an IMPLIED THREAT, and as such you could be arrested.  I realize that this
wasn't your intention, but no matter how angry you are, you should not post
threats in public forums unless it is your intention to make some new
friends at the local jail.

I strongly suggest that you issue a retraction of this statement.
