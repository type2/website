-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello...
I've been following the digest for some time now... Very enjoyable. I've some
questions that to pose to the collective wisdom.

1) What creative ways have you discovered for the ashtray in the middle
of your Vanagon dashboard? There should be something useful for us non 
smokers.

2) On late 80's Vanagons, the two rear side windows have louvered vents. Do
these seem to help the air circulation in the back? Do they add any wind
noise??

3) On the late 80's Vanagons with the lowered springs (You know who you are
you van has approximately one fist height between the top of the front wheel
and the body...My 85 has nearly two fist heights or 1 3/4&quot; more height!) Is
your mileage in the 19-20 mpg ?? 
My Westie is getting 16mpg. I think the  math works out that 15 k miles yr / 
15 mpg * 1.5$ a gal = $1406 US. If I can improve the mileage to 20 mpg then 
I could save $281 a year. (Optimistically) I could almost pay for the 
lowered spring setup from Bus boys in the first year but really in the 
second year.

4) Any suggestions on improving the radio reception? Do you have a powered
antenna - I don't mean a retractable antenna- but a power lead (as well as
the wire from ) the antenna? 

5) The 914-6 engine for air cooled engines sounds fun but $$. This is a long
shot but...how about the 5 speed transmission mated with the waterboxer???
Mechanically impossible???

6) Your thoughts on FAQ for Vanagons... Interesting topics have been / might
be...Tires...shock absorbers...head gasket problems... oil...CB radio's...
Gas mileage..&quot;California look&quot; windows...a listing of catalogues for parts...
music sound systems...Vanagons &amp; varieties in different countries...England,
Germany, Canada, Mexico, South Africa... Propane discussions...

7) I looked at the Geneva web page showing the new Ford/VW van...Looks a lot
like the Nissan Quest/Mercury Villager. Is this the end of the larger VW's 
Vans?

8) I see a number of postings for Van's to buy &amp; sell. Perhaps a list of
Newspaper Webpages that offer FREE browseing of the classifieds would be 
useful. The San Jose Mercury News offers this service. Those looking can 
do a key word search. 

9) VW's as an investment?? In the last year or so, used Westie prices are
climbing. I've seen a number of 88-90 Westies for $18-20K. Very close to 
orginal asking price! Certainly not following the traditional $2k a year
loss in depreciation! (not factoring in repairs here).

Well, thats enough from my coffee leaded brain. I always enjoy reading
the digests.
