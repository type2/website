So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Still alive.  I haven't run the stove - yet!  :)

Glad to hear it!  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; The reason it seems that the stove in a westy is vented (at 
&gt; least to me) is that there is a round silver
&gt; thing on the outside side panel of the car that says something like
&gt; &quot;flue vent,&quot; no?  Is this not venting the stove?  If not, then
&gt; what IS it venting?

Nope, that's for the fridge venting only.  Sorry.
