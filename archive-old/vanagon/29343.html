&gt; information on this conversion - name of the company, drawings, etc. &gt;
&gt; If not, does anyone have a line on a rear seat from a weekender.  He is 
&gt; also interested in stove, fridge, etc.


Fred,
	I have a '73 with a setup which allows the bottom of the rear seat 
to be flipped forward and the back of the seat to fold down to form a 
flat area which I suppose could be used for a bed. the only information I 
have on this is a sticker which says &quot;Z products, Van Nuys, CA&quot;
	I hope this helps out
dave.
