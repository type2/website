&gt; I have a 1.7 liter engine that I am trying to mount an oil pressure 
&gt; sender on.  The threads on the sender are the same as the threads on 
&gt; the stock oil pressure switch.  The problem is that the sender is so 
&gt; darn BIG that the hole in the tinware is too small.  Has anyone found 
&gt; a succesfull way to mount one of these electric sending units on a 
&gt; type IV engine, while the engine is in the bus?  If so please help 
&gt; me.

VDO has an extension hose for this purpose.  I have used it for about 4
years with no problems.  Good VW parts places should stock it, or at
least be able to order it.  If you get desparate, call Vee Parts in San
Diego at 619-477-4787 and ask them if they will mail it to you.  I think
it runs around $15-20.
