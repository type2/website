Subject:      Re: Batteries

I spoke too soon.  There is wiring in the area under the driver's seat.  A
red wire with an in-line fuse (16 amp?) and a whith wire plugged into a
blue wire.  Are these for the second battery?  How do they work?

Thanks,
Bill                    (Bill_at_freeholder_dot_com)
