Hi John,

I'm not a fan of drilling the holes in the westy top.  I know it does't
leak but it just bothers me.  I've used the Thule system for many years
with no problems.

Three parts required for my base system.

Thule part# 953 &quot;Super High Lockable Feet&quot;
Thule part# 853018216 &quot;Load Bar 200 cm&quot;
Thule part# 599 &quot;Ultimate Upright Carrier&quot;

I can carry two bikes and still pop the top the the bikes still on top!!

If I need to carry both of my canoes I just move one set of support feet
back and have no problem carring two canoe's and both bikes!  When you are
ready to camp just take down the canoes and remove one support and the top
is up!

Maybe I need to take some pictures this weekend and post for everyone?

&gt; Listees,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody have any feedback on whether I should get Thule or Yakima
&gt; rook racks for my Westfalia poptop?  Prices are similar, and REI sells
&gt; both.  
&gt; 
&gt; The people at Yakima recommend getting the shortest feet available and
&gt; using the artificial rain gutters.  Any experiences?  Thanks.
