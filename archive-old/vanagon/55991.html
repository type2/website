Subject: Syncro Junkies Help Me...

Any of you guys know what is used to seal the gear oil in the trans at
the front (Where the center driveshaft meets the trans). Is it a sealed
bearing, like a waterpump, or something else. I've developed a slight
leak at this point, but after 3000k miles I haven't noticed much
difference in oil level. Also if anyone knows the part# that would be
helpful.
