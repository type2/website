Subject:      '71 Bus Parts

HI Everybody,
    Do any of you know where I can find those doughnut sized bushings
that go under the rear spring plate and around the end of the torsion bar?
We don't have a dealer here, and the nearest one in Tulsa (120 miles) has
none.  I guess this isn't one of those things people dig into very often.
The ones on my bus were really worn, so I need the power of the list to help
me find some QUICK!  Seems like these bus parts are getting hard to find. :(

 Thanx,  Chris V.  '71 Camper and Assorted Beetles
