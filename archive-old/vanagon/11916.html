I would like to say at this point that I've found most `Bus people',
at this point (I've owned 3 pre-`67 busses at this point (less than 
two-year period.), and they've all been enormously helpful, especially
the split-window bus folks. Heck, I even got a nice oil bath air-cleaner
from Clara (sgwl from San Fran is her Pop.), which apparently is a
kinda rare item. I had this silly 14.00 paper air cleaner on, that
I got from my FLAPS, and she said `That won't do!', and gave me one.
(I had given her a bunch of headlight bucket parts previously, BTW.),
and I intend to trade with her (or Rain) for a number of years to
come. 
	Well, what I wanted to write this about, was the fact that
if anyone wanted something from the Seattle area, just ask, and the
same treatment would be given to them. I have a FLAPS called Oval's
near me, and all their rubber is from WCM, but what I don't quite
understand is how they sell it for ~50-75% of the catalog price!
