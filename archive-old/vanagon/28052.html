&gt; A few years ago DB&amp;HVWs had an article on the humble
&gt; beginnings of our loved ones (or twos) which included the
&gt; hand-drawn sketch Ben Pon drew in his notebook of the basic
&gt; design of engine-in-back, us-in-front, and lots of space in
&gt; between.  I know I've seen this sketch again in a recent
&gt; publication but I can't remember where.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I just dream that, or was it in something more recent?
&gt; Thought one of you might recall.

I read about what you are describing in a recent VW Trends.
