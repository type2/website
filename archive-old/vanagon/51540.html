&gt; &gt; Sounds like the system is settling down after the normal fits. Had
&gt; &gt; anymore trouble?
&gt; &gt; Ken, no not yet. I thought it might be a head gasket, but if so, I can't understand why
&gt; it blows combustion gases into the coolant, causing it to overflow one time, then not do
&gt; this for quite some time later? When this happened the last time it was rather cold out
&gt; (in the 30's). The same thing happened this summer when it was warmer out?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still perplexed. Right now it's behaving itself.

Rich,

I think that if this is only happening after you do your flush and bleed
that it could just be getting &quot;normalized&quot;.  Mine did the same thing
then stayed at a normal level.  You might just want to bleed it again
just in case though.
