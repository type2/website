&gt; no air coming out of the vents at all?? I would check th fan ciruit, switches,
&gt; wiring, etc before getting into the a/c plumbing ...
&gt;

Good point!  On the air-conditioning on both my Mazda and a friend's Toyota the
air-conditioning doesn't even kick in unless the fan is turned on.  If your
fan is dead, maybe the air-conditioning won't turn on.

Sorry I don't have any VW experience with AC... I use the ole &quot;you want AC,
open the damn window!&quot; in my bus...  :)
