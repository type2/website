  Sounds like the blower's seizing up.  I had the same thing.  I was
able to pick up a used one in Phoenix for cheap.  Things got a little
tricky when I hooked it up though.  Same appearance, mount, connector
for the relay, etc except that it would keep the battery light on
even with the key out of the ignition.  Hmm...  I thought about it for
a bit, looked at the schematics a bit..  The '75 blower relay had a 
built in diode that the '76 didn't.  Swapped relays and all was well.
That was the most benevolent of my problems on that trip.  Between 
leaky fuel lines (at altitude and cold only) and a intermittently 
bad ignition coil I had alot of fun on that trip.
