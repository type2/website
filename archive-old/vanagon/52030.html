&gt; bucks).  However a friend directed me to the local Heathkit (Zenith) =
&gt; dealer who had a CO meter that you could build.  Yes, it takes a couple =
&gt; of hours but I still have it and it.  It has always checked out against =
&gt; all smog tests in CA and Utah where I now live.  It cost about $150.00 =
&gt; but it is still a wise investment for EFI or Carbs (I use it to dial in =
&gt; my Webers on my 2 Liter Type IIs)
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps
&gt; Alas Heathkit is no longer around
