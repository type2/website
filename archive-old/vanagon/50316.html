If you're not in for the Bilstein budget you may want to consider KYB
shocks, I was told they are manufactured under the same patent as Bilstein
only made in Japan. I've always been happy with them, but I must say I
never compared them to Bilsteins on a vehicle. You can get KYBs from New
Brighton Imports 1-800 621-5125 and ask for Bobby. (I have no affiliation
with New Brighton or Bobby, I've done business with this company for the
past 15 years and has been pleased with quality, service and price.)
