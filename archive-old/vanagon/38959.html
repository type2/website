Hello All,

I've sold our low mileage '87 Syncro GL yesterday. It wasn't easy but, it
gets us one step closer to having what we really wanted in the first place
which is a factory Syncro Westy.  We still have our 88 Westy GL which we may
sell to get that right factory Syncro Westy.

Our 87 Syncro GL had 52,000 actual miles and we sold it for $8,250.
