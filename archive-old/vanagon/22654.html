Subject: Viking Vanagon Advice Sought

Hi Type II'ers,

In all seriousness, I have set out to consider purchasing the Viking 
Vanagon.  It's a 1984 manual transmission, 143,000 mile 1.9 liter 
Wasserboxer with what sounds like a thrown valve and or holey piston.  
It ran fine until they experienced a smokey engine, loss of power, and 
eventually engine seizure (they did make it back to their driveway).  I'm 
willing to take on the rebuilding or replacing of the motor, but I'd like 
to hear some feedback on what I may/may not be getting into.

Anyway, the rest of the Vanagon is in good to excellent shape (no rust), 
but I haven't actually looked at it yet.  The attractive part of this 
deal is the price, $900 obo.  I have worked on TI and TIV motors for over 
a decade, but I have never paid much attention to the Wasserboxes until 
now (price being w/i reasonable range for my tightwad scandahoovian blood).
For a little more money I could buy a pretty nice '71 Westy from a friend 
(even has a Gene Berg shifter), but this vehicle will be used primarily 
for the family and my wife really likes decent heat in our midwestern 
winters (I knew I shouldn't have taken her on that road-trip across 
Kansas in the 25 degree winter weather in a heaterless 40hp 64 Kombi!).

If anyone is willing to offer any constructive, precautionary, beneficial 
advise, I would be grateful!  Also, If anyone knows the *true* origins of 
what constitutes a 'Viking Edition' Vanagon, I'd love to get some feedback, 
although the humorous discourses have been pretty good!  8-)
