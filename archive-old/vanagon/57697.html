&gt;&gt; Westfalia still makes &quot;camper&quot; versions of the Eurovans for sale in many
&gt;&gt; parts of the world, just not in the USA.  So you can buy a &quot;Eurovan Westy&quot;
&gt;&gt; today, but not in the USA.

&gt;     Hey Jim,
&gt;        Sorry to differ, but there is a Eurovan Westy at the dealer
&gt;        here is PGH PA. for sale, $35,000. I looked at it.

Well if there is, it's a real oddity and VW didn't import it.  
I bet if you looked a little closer you'd find it was a &quot;Winnie&quot; by Winnebago
rather than a &quot;Westy&quot; by Westfalia.
