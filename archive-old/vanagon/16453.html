Subject: bodega search committee report


Lacking any additional members wishing to join the &quot;Bodega Bay
Search-for-the-best-campsite-to-burn-cool-stuff&quot; committee, we, a
total of 2 (Bradley Prunehead and I), set about investigating
all the campsite options in the Bodega Bay area yesterday, for
our group upcoming campout, June 2-4.

Unfortunatly the campsite we liked the best, Doran, was already
booked, but we accumulated paperwork necessary for us to reserve
this WONDERFUL spot for an outing next year (we were told it
often reserves 5-6 months in advance).  At any rate, our second
choice was Wrights, a private small campground right on the ocean
about 14 miles north of Bodega Bay, with the previous suggestion
of the Dunes State Park being perhaps choice #3.  

Now my question is:  if any of you already reserved spaces with
mistix at the Dunes, then we should I think try for that site.  If
not, it would seem that Wrights suits our needs a bit better (ok,
no showers, but by THAT time, I intend to have a bathing system
to blow the socks of Schwarzes!  :).  Anyway, please let me 
know ASAP if you've already reserved at the Dunes, so that we
can make a group decision to either stay there, or to move
the location to Wrights Beach.

Hurry!!!!!!!!!!  :)
