Subject: 82 Vanagon Diesel


Anyone out there with experience changing glow plugs on a 82 Vanagon.
Looks like the injecter pump is right in the way of removing or testing.

Any information appreciated.

Just put in a new starter and battery, don t want to give up now ...
:-).


                                   Thanks ....
