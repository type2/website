&gt;  Ummmm, boys?  Are you aware that the Synchro Westy is only supposed to get
&gt;  16 highway and 16 city?  Okay, milage may vary, but how is it possible that
&gt;  you're getting between 25-50% better milage than you should?  Could you
&gt;  please share your magic with the rest of us?
&gt; 
&gt;  EPA esitmates are pretty accurate if a bit conservative, but these claims
&gt;  you're making are astounding.  Either your record keeping is inaccurate, or
&gt;  there is something special about your Vans.  Even non-Westy non-synchro
&gt;  Vans don't get 23mpg.
&gt; 

The trick is speed.
The Westy hits a wall about 55 to 65 mi/hr.
It's a E=mc**2 thing ;)
