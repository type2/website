 BatSubject:     Syncro fron wheel bearings??_          5/29/97    9:59 AM
Good Morning listee's

I'm currently rebuilding the front end suspension.  after 145,000 miles it's a
little tired.  Front Wheel Bearings, All rubber bushings, Shocks, tie rod
ends, all being redone.  The upper A arm bushings are completed, now it's on
to the wheel bearings.

Does anyone have any experience pressing the old ones out and what to look for
or expect.  I have access to a press and a machine shop, and am planning on
replacing the seals.  ($3 apiece at Metric Auto in St. Louis Park.)

Thanks in advance
