Subject: Spring Jamboree and how my bus stacked up

well, i spent the whole day at the show yesterday.  it was a typical
spring jamboree.  alot of flashy cars, girls and music.  Not exactly a
vintage type meet, but ....

Jim Burns and his wife came down to check it out.  i got to talk to him
for a while and show him my bus.  they came up from san diego to check out
the show.  (sorry if i got you lost jim in getting here)  i did not get to
meet any other list members if they came out.  i though that there were
going to be about 4 others out there.

there were about 35 bus's there at ther show.  most were custome jobs.
ther highlights were a nice double door that was full customed out.  it
was completely carpeted and detailed in gold trim.  i'm not sure if it
won.  there were about 7 crew cabs out there.  most were custome.  one was
a early binz crew.  mine was the only stock one.  charlie hammil had his
ladder truck out to promote the classic next month.  i don't think htere
were any barn door bus's on display.

the best of show went to a real nice 54 bug.  he won best in class, best
show and best paint.  i have never seen such a nice black paint job.
flawless!!!!!!   it was a real clean, 100% stock oval.  the paint looked
10 feet deap.  read interior realy set it all of.  it was beutiful.
enough about that though.

well, i got a real good responce with my truck.  i was talking to people
about it all day.  i have it up for sale (i don't want to sell it but dad
does.  his $$$$$$$)  we will see if anything comes of it.  

well, when it cam to the end of the day and prizes were given out, i was
unsure.  i knew i had the nicest vintage bus out there but did not know if
the judges put everybody in the correct class.  i was in the Vintage
Comertial class.  well to sum it all up...

  I WON FIRST PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!       Yippie.

i was extaticwhen i went up to get my trophy.   big sucker.  anyway, that
kind of made the last 11 months of resto work worth it.  it made me feal
good that the hard work was apreciated.  i had a blast the whole day
talking to people and sharing my experiance about the bus.

anyway, just wanted to let you all know what happened.



Take care and God Bless
