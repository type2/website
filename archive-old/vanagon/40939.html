Subject: 77 FI - postscript to Chapter 1

It's been a week since I've had the fuel injection running (in loose terms)
on my 77 Westy. This has given me the chance to drive it around a bit and
see how it's operating, and compare it to the Weber kit that was on it before.

Well, it's been running like crap. No gas leakage around clamps and tap
(like before I replaced the faulty pressure regulator). It started up fine,
idled pretty good, lots of power at startup (ie. low rpms), but it seemed to
die out power-wise once the revs got above 2000rpms. You could feel it
trying, though - it would almost 'lunge' for a milisecond, but it wouldn't
just didn't want to go. And talk about lousy gas mileage - pathetic.

I'm thinking there's either a problem with the fuel system, or the ignition
system. The ignition system ran fine before I put in the FI, though.

So I'm reading the latest batch of vanagon_at_lenti stuff, and catch a thread
on 'losing power on hills'. &quot;Hey, I lose power on hills. Maybe the mileage
sucks because I'm flooring it to try and get the power up&quot;. It seems timing
and/or distributor advance may be a possible cause. I did time to spec, but
I'm running a 009 (no vacuum advance), so it still may need adjusting.
Outside I go. Hands filled with tools, brain filled with thoughts about
advance curves and timing, etc.

But, before I start her up to let her warm up, I hear a voice - &quot;pull the
plugs&quot;. The engine is cold - take a peek at the plugs for they will tell you
great tales of combustion.

Pulled #4 (hey, I'm lazy and it was the easiest to get at). OUCH! WAY BLACK!
Coated with crud. OK - so #4 either isn't firing very often, or is getting
too much fuel.

Pulled #3. An absolute dream. Beautiful light tan color - very even. Checked
#1 and #2 and almost completely tan with a bit of a black patch on each.

Pulled the #4 injector - the hard plastic casing at the end was cracked. ah
HA! Replaced it with a spare I had (thanks for sending the spares Martin),
tightened it down, and fired her up.

Idled a bit better. Let her warm up, and took her for a spin. Not much
difference at first, but I could feel the power curve improve as I drove
(maybe it took some gas to clean out the injector???). Idle seemed a wee
high. OOPS... Stopped and reconnected the little vacuum hose to the fuel
vapor cutoff in the air flow meter / air cleaner housing. That dropped the
idle back. Better power curve too. The gas gauge didn't seem to drop as
dramatically, either.

Got home, rechecked the timing, and shut her down.

I've give her another week or so to see how she does, but I think I can
close the book on this chapter.


Dave.

ps. now I know what 'oil dilution' smells like. now I know what I'm doing
tomorrow night :)
