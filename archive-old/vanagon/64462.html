Subject:      Westy tire question

Well its time I joined the ranks of tire seekers for my 85 Westy. So far in
Reno Nevada all I have come up with is;

  Bridgestone model RD603V - 6 ply sidewall, 45 psi rated, C load rated


Found it for $76 (mounted, balanced, etc). Does anyone have any experiance
with this particular tire. TIA

Richard 85 Westy
