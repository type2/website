Subject:      owner's manuals

well ... i got another &quot;shipment&quot; of owner's manuals in today ... still
$6.00 each from Jim Ellis VW in atlanta (800) 653-5547 (ask for Joe Baisle
&lt;bays-uhl&gt; ... who will probably kill me for this! :)

this is what i got (two of each, so i'll &quot;part&quot; with only one!!):

Type 2 1973 Volkwagen Owner's Manual: Operation and Maintenance
Type 2 1974 Volkwagen Owner's Manual: Operation and Maintenance
Type 2 1975 Volkwagen Owner's Manual: Operation and Maintenance
Type 2 1976 Volkwagen Owner's Manual
**no 1977???**

1982 Camper Supplement to 1982 Vanagon Owner's Manual
1983 Camper Supplement to Volkswagen Vanagon Owner's Manual
**no 1984??**
1985 Camper Supplement to Volkswagen Vanagon Owner's Manual
1986 Camper Supplement to Volkswagen Vanagon Owner's Manual
1987 Camper Supplement to Volkswagen Vanagon Owner's Manual

the part numbers are:
W42-022-960-1  OM Camper 82
W42-023-960-1  OM Camper 83
W42-026-960-1  OM Camper 85
W42-027-960-1  OM Camper 86
W42-028-960-1  OM Camper 86

WSA-562-007-23 OM Bus 73
WSA-562-011-23 OM Bus 74
WSA-562-012-23 OM Bus 75
WSA-562-015-23 OM Bus 76

now, for the two poor 1977 folks who have been waiting patiently on me, i'm
sorry. i'll have to call up Joe and get on him about this. i can't see why
we can't get 1977 if we can get a 1974.

but the point is that the owner's manuals ARE still available from some
place ... so find a dealer whose parts guys are willing to bother with these
... and i think the size of the order helps &quot;encourage&quot; them a bit.

anyhoo, if lots of 1973 or 1974 or whatever want copies, i can get Joe to
order more of them. just a thought.
