Subject:      a subtle reminder: it's Friday

boy.

one little holiday season, and the Traditions crumble and fall by the
wayside.  except for Will's vain attempt to set us at each other's throats,
why, there's no silliness whatsoever on Friday/today.

yeah, yeah, i know: everybody's out, fending off the Hordes of Holiday
Housewives, hacking through the shelves of Santa's Supply Stores ... sigh.

well ...

Merry Christmas and a Bah Humbug for the New Year. :)
