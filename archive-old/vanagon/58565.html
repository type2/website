&gt; &gt;PS:  Oh - the little button on the Handbrake activates the Brake Warning
&gt; &gt;Light when the Handbrake is in use - push the button (which happens when
&gt; &gt;releasing the Handbrake) and the light goes out.
&gt; 
&gt; now that's odd.  On my 3 vanagons and in the Bentley manual that button
&gt; releases the parking brake only.  The light goes out when the lever reaches
&gt; the floor and presses on the switch. very odd ;).  Tim
&gt;

Ah, but the person who asked the original question doesn't have a
Vanagon.  She has a Bus and in a Bus there is a little push-button
switch (like the ones in the doorjambs) that turns off the brake light
when the parking brake is released.  Bus parking brake handles don't
have little buttons for release, you just turn 'em and release.
