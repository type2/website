To All:

Gregor has mistakenly given me credit for somone else's comments.

&gt; &gt;Oregon is also the state that gave us the Oregon Citizen's Alliance, that
&gt; &gt;neo-nazi group that is (like a virus) attempting to infect neighboring
&gt; &gt;states.  But at least it gives Lon Mabon's family a job and keeps the
whole
&gt; &gt;gang off welfare.

In the same message that Gregor put words in my mouth, his own words
included...

&quot; if you floor it on I-5 and only stop to get gas i guess you meet the
people you deserve...&quot;  Traveling 423 miles in approximately twelve hours is
not what I would call 'flooring it'.   If I 'floored it on I-5' my four-day
trip could have been accomplished in two days or less..  And as for anyone
deciding what people I or anyone else should 'deserve' to meet...  I think
this list operates a bit above that sort of thing.  I know I do.
