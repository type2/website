Subject: 85 Westy For Sale

I have an '85 Westfalia for sale.  It has a bad engine; probably a bad
head and maybe a burnt valve.  I have not run it since the engine started
knocking, and believe it will need to  be trailered or towed to move it.

110k miles.  New shocks and new tires in last 5k.  Body good; needs some
spot painting.  Color is bronze metallic.  Lights all work, as does
parking brake.  Air conditioning needs charged.  After market stereo with
tape player.  Regularly serviced, usually by VW.

Interior is exceptionally clean.  It has always had full carpeting over
the factory material, so looks virtually new.  

4 spd manual.  No known problems with clutch, transmission or CV joints.
Exhaust in good shape.

This bus has an extra seat so can seat 6, plus an additional extra single
seat, so can be used to seat 5 and still acces refrigerator.  It also has
the childs bed which goes across the front seats.

The stove, sink and water system have never been used.  The refrigerator
has  been used sparingly.

There is an extra set of rims with snow tires.

I dont' know what to ask.  Feel free to make an offer, or if you don't
want to buy it, feel free to suggest a price.

Phone 319-645-1523 for more information.
