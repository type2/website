Regarding the death of a baby sitting in fr. seat of A3 Jetta:

I saw the newscast last night and read the article this morning;
the visual, while not revealing, was not particularly plea-
sant.  Apparently the child was decapitated and the head was
ejected through the passenger window.  Reading the story in the
news, I quote the following:

&quot;Coroner Erwin Sonnenberg said the child car seat was not secured
to the front seat, and that was a major factor in the decapitation.&quot;

Others quoted go on to say that this would have been a minor accident
with no injuries otherwise.


Now I don't know what state &quot;not secured to the front seat&quot; defines,
but if it means the seat was not attached by ANY means, or improperly
attached (wrong belt through wrong anchor points) then I find it very
hard to sympathize w/ the little girl's mother because the bottom line
is that parents are ultimately responsible for their charges.  I mean,
we drive around w/ a 2yr. old in the front seat of both our A2 Jetta
and EV, but this incident is not going to change the seating arrange-
ment anytime soon.

I just think it's time that people own up to their responsibilities
and
not point fingers where they don't belong.
