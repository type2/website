&gt;...            What's wrong with roughing it for the weekend, conserving a
&gt;little H20 and enjoying a nice refreshing shower when you return to
&gt;civilization?  Besides, if the FRENCH can get away with only one shower ...

&gt;I'm going to stick my (dirty) neck out here and agree with Larry.  I'm fine
&gt;going for a weekend without a shower if none is available.  When they *are*
&gt;available, I like two per day.  :)

gee. smells like my old army days. ;)  Why, I can Remember ... those steaming
summer days, a'sarving of 'er Majesty the Queen, ... why we'd go for weeks
with only a &quot;bird bath&quot;. smell? nah, with all the burning of excrement that
went on, you couldn't smell yourself (much less anyone else).

well, cept there WAS this one fellow who really like Ham and Lima Beans ... :)
