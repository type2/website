Spam just so happens to be made in Minnesota and i will not tolerate 
the desecration of this fine food product on this list, even if one 
does invoke of the name of Joel.  We on this list pride ourselves on 
tolerance and acceptance of all, even those Chrysler things.

Pan-fried, placed between 2 slices of buttered white bread-- cuisine
just doesn't get any better than this.  PLUS, one can keep several
cans of Spam under the seat in their van for emergency rations or
wheel chocks.  Spam can also be burned as an alternative heat source
due to its, uh, high lipid content.  the smoke has citronella-like
qualities and keeps biting insects away. 

so i beg you kind folk... give Spam a chance, don't ignore it.
