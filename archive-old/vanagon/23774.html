Subject: GARAGED AT LAST!!!

A kind gentleman came by to take a look at the garage door opener after 
offering advice yesterday over the phone, he tweaked a few things (he 
knew what he was doing) and my beloved (though sometimes maligned) '76 
Campmobile FITS INSIDE THE GARAGE!!! I haven't felt so happy in months, 
this may have saved my marriage. Had to tell somebody. Lucky you.
