Subject: Re: Westfalia A/C Idea


I've been thinking of the same.  It should be easy to fashion a removable
duct that could be stowed when the top is up.  Make a flat one (3&quot; or so thick,
12&quot; or so wide) out of a large cardboard box.

As an interim, just remove the black grills, and the airflow to the front
will increase about 2X.

 &gt;     Forever bemused by VW's inability or unwillingness to do something 
 &gt;     about front A/C in the Westfalia (just CAN'T use that cutsey name), 
 &gt;     I've been wondering:
 &gt;     
 &gt;     How about sacrificing that left side &quot;shelf&quot; and installing a blank 
 &gt;     duct (similar to the one over the sliding door, but without the 
 &gt;     vents). At the rear, the duct would have a fitting to go into (and 
 &gt;     replace) the leftmost air director on the A/C unit.  At the front, it 
 &gt;     could terminate in an air director or two.  Or a more involved 
 &gt;     installation might include ductwork that you install above the ceiling 
 &gt;     panel with a couple of vents to bring the air away from the back of 
 &gt;     your neck.  Maybe even an inline fan to help the air get through the 
 &gt;     tube.
 &gt;     
 &gt;     Anyone done something like this on their own?
 &gt;     
 &gt;     Should I try it and then sell you all copies?
