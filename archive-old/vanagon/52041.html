Subject: Re: Cartalk's VW puzzler

 Hi all: So, what was the answer to the following &quot;puzzler&quot; that was posted
earlier?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I know its not Friday, but this would be really stale by then.  Did
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone catch Cartalk this weekend?  Their puzzler was as follows:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Larry's VW Beetle he had in college caught on fire when he and 3 of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;friends piled in the car for a night on the town. The mishap had to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;with a repair he'd done 6 weeks earlier when he loosened 3 screws and
&gt;&gt;&gt;tightened 3 bolts. What was the repair? Why did the car catch fire?&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;(You can e-mail an answer to them at puzzler_at_cartalk_dot_com if you want)
