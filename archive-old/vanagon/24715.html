Subject: Re: Analog Mouse

Your story reminds me of when I started up my first rebuild. I used a 
muffler that had sat in our shed for 2 years.  After the engine caught 
I went back to tune it and discovered nesting material blown outall over 
the garage. no baby mice, though they were found in later parts box rumaging.
