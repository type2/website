I just did a small INSTALL on the '84.  I left the factory front speakers
where they are ('cause nothing else DECENT will fit there).  I removed the
plastic pocket from the drivers door (held in place from the backside with
screws) and installed a pair of Infinity Kappa 63's.  They are 6 1/2 inch
triaxial and they fit down where the plastic pocket was.

The window clears just fine, and I was able to get two (of the three)
mounting screws to bite into metal for a tight install!!  I caulked the
backside of the door panel later 'cause the plastic sheeting in there
vibrates if you don't (just make sure that everything is put together right
before sealing it shut, I used silicone because I thought it might be able
to peel off easier later)

I left the rear speakers where they were, but I installed an amplifier.  VW
however has a common ground to the rear speakers.  I ran an extra wire along
the same path as the other three.  It took a damn long time, and I cursed a
lot, had to partially remove the headliner, but I finally got it back
there!!!

I plan on installing some tweeter plates (maybe) where the factory front
speakers are, but for now they are just disconnected (they really are
shit!!)

There's plenty of room above/behind the glove compartment if you want to
install an amplifier (oh yea, you didn't want to do that!!)  I did the
install with the dashboard removed (It's not that hard to do, and I had to
fix a squeaky heater fan!!)

I also put a CD changer under the rear seat, facing forward, with a small
hole cut out of the wood (god, that stuff's thick) so that you can take the
cartridge out without raising the seat.

I sounds much better now, however I havn't driven it all week 'cause the
radiator has sprung a leak (_again_).  \

Well, off to fix the radiator!!!
