&gt; 
&gt; .......................................................................
&gt; VW Technical Information
&gt; Group 80, Number 87-01
&gt; Date: July 31, 1987
&gt; Model(s): Water-cooled Vanagons, 1983-1985
&gt; Subject: Carpet wet by rear seat - heat exchanger bleeder screw broken
&gt; 
&gt; The plastic bleeder screw for the rear heat exchanger may be broken due to
&gt; seal swelling.
&gt; * Replace with an improved metal bleeder screw, Part number N 902 061 01.
&gt;   and new gasket, Part number 861 819 037.
&gt; 
&gt; Production Change:
&gt; Metal bleeder screw installed as of:
&gt; December 1984, VIN: 25 FM 050 887
&gt; .........................................................................
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The bleeder screw I replaced was made of white plastic as you described
&gt; above which is odd because your '91 should have the metal screw according 
&gt; to the bulletin.  Anyway, it solved my leaking auxilary heater problem
&gt; although I still smell coolant whenever I run the rear heater which had me
&gt; thinking that the core itself may have a tiny leak.  I have since convinced 
&gt; myself that the coolant residue left in the fiber floor board is the culprit. 
&gt; 

Okay! I called the dealer (Lasher VW in downtown Sac.) and he has the original
plastic screw and the metal screw that is suppose to replace it.  However,
the parts person says that he would he wasn't crazy about putting in a 
metal screw for fear of damaging the plastic casement.  Any comments on
this?  I'm going to buy both since they're only $7.15 all told.  Anybody
out there have any problem with the metal screw.  I could see it if you
torqued it to tight, but if it's just snug I don't see a problem.

I should have my van back on the road tonight AFTER I clean up the puddle
under the seat.  ;P
