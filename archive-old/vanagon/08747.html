Subject: Best way to fix drip rails?

	My 66 camper rolled onto it's driver's side at some time in it's
life, and suffered some pretty extensive drip rail damage. (Wavy, like
~~~~~~~~~~~.) I am using a donor bus for the portion over the driver's
door, and the drip rail was rusted out in a couple of places. No problem!
I thought. Wrong answer! I tried using my mig to gradually build up
the area (for later grinding practice.), but to no avail; I eventually
had to acetylene braze it to fillit enough for grinding. By replacing
the `portion over the driver's door' this is the framework/front
windshield post/ some of the post in front of the first side window.
This is the only major bodywork that needs to be done to this, except
I have to find a way to replace those *^&amp;_at_&amp;^!! Pinto Tail lights that
someone put in, for some awful reason. *sigh*. What I'm looking for is
a less time-consuming way to do this. TIA.
