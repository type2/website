&gt; &gt;A friend of mine may have an 82 parts Vanagon available soon. I was
&gt; &gt;curiuos if the 4-speed in it would fit in my 83 Wasserboxer. The 83
&gt; &gt;crunches gears when shifting unless you really baby it and I thought this
&gt; &gt;might be a cheap fix. Do you think it will fit without too much
&gt; &gt;reengineering?
&gt; 
&gt; the story i heard was that the air-cools had an 091 transmission, and the
&gt; water-cools had an 091/1. supposedly they are the same transmission, same
&gt; size, etc., but the water-cooled buses have different transmission mounts
&gt; and (because the water-cooled engine is shorter than the air-cooled engine)
&gt; the transmission is mounted in a different place (to make the cv-joint
&gt; angles &quot;better&quot;).
&gt; 
&gt; so the first thing you'll need to check is whether the two have the same
&gt; mounting positions.

 Looking back over the data compiled to do the wear index shows a different
 final drive ratio in the 091/1 &lt;4.83:1&gt; than in the 091 used in air cooled
 Vanagons &lt;4.57:1&gt;. Engine revs at 60 mph with stock tires would go from
 3267 to 3072 &lt;calculated values, YMMV&gt;.
