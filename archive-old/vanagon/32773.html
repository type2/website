&gt; OK, I'LL BITE AGAIN SINCE NO ONE ANSWERED WHAT THE SMALL ROUND GIZMO ON THE
&gt; VANAGON DASH IS. THE MANUAL PICTURES IT BUT DOESN'T ID IT. WHAT IS IT?
&gt; 
&gt; AS AN ASIDE, IS IT PART OF THE VW  MYSTIQUE THAT APPARENTLY PEOPLE CAN OWN
&gt; THESE THINGS FOR LIFETIMES AND STILL NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT HOW THE HEATER
&gt; CONTROLS WORK?
&gt; 
&gt; WESTONIf you're talking about the plain knob to the left of the aux heater 
control, I believe it's a push-pull  switch to turn the relay on for 
camper equipment (lights, refrigerator, etc.) to be connected to the 
battery.  I'm not sure though, as mine was broken when I got my brick, 
and I wired a Group 27 Deep Cycle into the camper circuitry.
Oh, and for everyone looking for camping heat, I've had great experience 
with the Olympia catalytic propane heaters.  Crack a couple of windows 
and remain comfortable.  I didn't connect mine into the Westy propane 
system, but use a 20# propane tank instead.  the 3100 BTU model uses 
just 1/8 lb per hour of propane and is flameless.  If you're in serious 
cold, you may want the 6200 btu model.
