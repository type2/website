Subject: Oil pressure Gauge?


Hey,
former vanagon list member wondering if it still exists.  Also, hoping 
that you or someone can answer a simple question.  Where is the oil 
pressure gauge mounted on a 1985 Vanagon?  I got a friend working on my 
Van who is used to the older models, he's been feeling around for an hour 
and can't find it.  SAys it used to sit right up around the distributor.

any help would be great
chuck
