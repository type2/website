&gt; &gt; My significant other just got back from the south side of the world down in 
&gt; &gt; Chile and she said that there were VW buses all over the place, including 
&gt; &gt; pickups.  Don't know about splitties, though.  She saw some that were used as 
&gt; &gt; school buses no less.  The only pictures she brought back were of penguins, 
&gt; &gt; mtns and statues, but no buses.

In last month's NEATO newsletter there was a mexican Type II flyer from
'73 I believe that showed them to still be making split-windows. There
were many different varieties offered, including one that I MUST have
one day- the high-roof mobile dentist's office. it is like a high-roof
panel van, but has TWO ROWS of windows. So if anyone has one, just let
me know... :)
They also had (that I remember) an ambulance, crane-truck, hearse,
refrigerated van, and some other great ones...
