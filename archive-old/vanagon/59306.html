Subject: Clarification on Handling of Vanagons

        The information I wrote concerning the handling differences of a
vanagon and a vanagon camper were a response to a message I read, but
trashed to soon, on the list.  The owner had just purchased a camper and
was curious why the camper handled differently than his regular camper. In
that message he asked about various ideas he was considering. Tires,
swaybars and etc. That is the  context in which I was addressing my
thoughts.

        But since the endorsing statements of overall handling has been
made, I would wholeheartedly agree. I have absolutely loved the handling of
vanagons, from the first test drive. Since I just bought my first one,
after seven years of looking and driving at many different vanagons and
vanagon campers, I thought the two best were a 80 with new gas shocks and a
87 Wolfsburg. My opinion of course.

        One gentleman wrote the my suggestion of 1&quot; smaller tires on the
front axle was &quot;just plain DANGEROUS&quot;. While I don't know of his rational,
I would't hesitate to do it on my vehicle. I do know that different tires
sizes on the same axle is a no no, I have not heard of it being dangerous
on the front or rear of vehicle, as long as the tires are of the same size
on each axle.  I'm sure there is a practical limit as to how much
offsetting differnce you have.  Dragesters seemed to have quite a bit, but
they don't corner, except for right at the end when they turn off of the
strip. A varity of tuned suspension set ups utlize the offset in either
tire height or width to accomplish specific goals for the vehicle.

        So, my suggestions were merely a starting point for the individual
who was considering, and asking for ideas on how to improve the handling on
his camper vanagon.  I would believe he understands that &quot;porche&quot; like
handling is not the goal of this excersise, but to merely do what he can
with what he has.

        Sorry to apparently offend fellow vanagon owners with the
impression that the vanagon and vanagon camper is somehow not a excellant
driving vehicle as is.  I believe the vanagon to be a world class machine,
bar none. And incedently, I agree that any other van that I have driven
falls way short in the total package of enjoyment to drive and
functionality.
