Back to our discussion of propane-related issues...

Sunday there was a news story about an incident not far from here, about
a house blown (literally) to smithereens (literally - its 2 miles south
of Mobile) by a propane explosion from a leak.  No one was home, so there
weren't any injuries.  It destroyed a $300K house (which in California
is 1 bedroom, 1 bath, and an outhouse :)

Be careful out there!
