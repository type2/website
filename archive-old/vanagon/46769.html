Hi, My name is Eunah.  I've been meaning to goto the VW meetings, but 
I've been out of the country since the beginning of May.  Now I am up 
north in a town called Pellston(next to Cheboygan) for um biological 
station.  
I hope to participate sometime soon, meet other bug-riders.
Thanks for keeping me in the list, though.

						Eunah,
