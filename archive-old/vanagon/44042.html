Subject: Busses on '66'

Looks like nice, warm weather this weekend for the innaugural Busses on 
'66'.  I know that list members Sami Dakhlia, Jon Christensen, Joe 
Fournier and former list member Pete Sellers are coming  (Dave Schwarze 
is a maybe).  Anyone else?

This will be a good chance to relieve me of some of my excess Bussage.  
Not only will the '60 DD Panel be available, but the '63 23-Window Deluxe 
Sunroof that I had for sale back in February is again available.  These 
(and others) will be in the car corral at the June Bug Jamboree.  Friday 
night arrivals for Busses on '66' will have the first opportunity. :-)
