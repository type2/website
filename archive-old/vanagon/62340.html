&gt;&gt; &gt;Bill,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Read your post to the list re: your new 83 Westy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I have an 84 with 1st &amp;2nd gear shifting problems that I believe is an
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;adjustment problem, but haven't been able to find anyone here in Fla.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;who knows how to fix it. Do you know what your mechanic did? Any info
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;would be helpful.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Ron

&gt;Ron,
&gt;
&gt;Per Alex the fix was to lift the shift lever boot, loosen the 10 mm bolts
securing the shift plate and move the plate until properly aligned.
&gt;
&gt;This procedure is covered in the Bentley for 68-79 buses.  I do not have
the Bentley for Vanagons yet but I imagine the procedure is similar if the
topic is covered.  Also look for worn/missing plastic bushings where the
linkage assembly passes through metal securing brackets.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps
&gt;
&gt;Bill
