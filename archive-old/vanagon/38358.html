Subject: Flying to US ..advice? (non VW)

Forgive this...we hope to fly to New Mexico this summer to tour NM. AZ, Grand
Canyon etc. Any advice on best route from England to Albuquerque? Has to be in
two stages apparently...prefer not to be planebound for endless time.
Any advice ideas...please reply direct? Thanks.
