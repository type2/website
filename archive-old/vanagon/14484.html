Responding to Rusty asking how those doughnut-type exhaust gaskets could 
get &quot;sucked into the muffler pipe&quot;:

Well, I don't really know what happens to be honest, but when I removed the 
muffler the gaskets just weren't there any more and that was causing the 
leak which caused a backfire problem.  I noticed that the pipe from the 
4-tip exhaust I have seems larger than the pipe on the bug muffler I used 
to have on my 71 Westy (the pipe that fits over the heat exchanger pipe).  
I figger the gasket probably gets so crushed by me torquing 
those nuts down to stop the leaks that it crumbles shortly after and the 
small pieces find their way into the muffler (&quot;sucked&quot; was maybe too 
figurative&quot;) or just fall out onto the road.  

I think the next time I'll try to use some muffler sealer with the gasket 
to prevent any leaks.
