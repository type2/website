Subject: 91 vanagon carat for sale!

Needs a loving home! VW Carat 91
 We don't need this big car anymore now that kids are older. It is dark blue,
grey interior with the two rear facing seats and bench in back. It has the
other cool carat features like the fold up table, cup holders, &amp; interior
florescent light. The bench seat folds flat to a bed and it also has all
around privacy cutains. Great for camping but also a great every day car.
Only 88,000 miles. We bought new from local dealer and it is in excellent
shape. The air is the only thing that doesn't work. Just put in all new front
brakes. Also has four snow tires. We loved this van and you will too! Will
look at best offers. Thanks. We live in Mass on the NH border and could
deliver or meet you to se it.

EMAil to Noel3_at_aol_dot_com

P.S. This is our second vw van and my husband's fourth!
