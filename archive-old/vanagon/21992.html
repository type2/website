Chris,
	Drop the engine, by all means.  Once off of your '71, you can use 
a sharp cold chisel and tap that nut off.  This is also a good time to 
pull off that cooling tin and clean off the top of the cylinders and 
heads of insulating stuff.  I find a lot of fur and acorns when I do 
this.  Have you ever wondered why your engines sometimes make weird 
screachings on cold mornings?  That is the sound of small squirrels and 
rats getting caugth out sleeping on the fan.  I keep on meaning to buy 
one of those &quot;buggyy screens&quot; that fit over the big hole in the fan 
cover.  Drop that engine.  Gary Gibson
