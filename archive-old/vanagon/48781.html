&gt;&gt; The oil pressure light on my '89 Vanagon is worrying me a little.  After I
&gt;&gt; have been driving on the freeway ~65-70 mph for a few miles and then slow
&gt;&gt; down to an idle (~800 RPM) the oil pressure light comes on intermittently.
&gt;&gt; If I increase the RPMs to ~1,000 the light goes off.  I've checked the oil
&gt;&gt; ..  What's the problem?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;What kind of oil filter are you using??  What kind of oil?  The 
&gt;popular consensus is that Fram oil filters (and other cheaper filter 
&gt;brands) cause this problem.  Going to the German Mann filters solved 
&gt;it for me but I've also used Purolator filters w/ success.  Also,  I 
&gt;have personally found that 20W50 really works best for the Vanagon 
&gt;engine.  I use 10W40 if I am traveling north where the temps will be 
&gt;consistently below 30 degrees.  ( I live in Texas)

I live in Texas, too.  I'm using Mann filters.  Castrol 10W40.  The reason
that I was concerned is that I have not changed anything recently.
