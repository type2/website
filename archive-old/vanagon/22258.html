Subject: Get out of Death free!

Regarding Thom's recent posting.  I was in a head-on collision.  I was in
the passenger seat.  The car was totalled.  I had a very sore neck and shoulder.

I realize that seat belts won't save you every time, but they sure saved my
butt.

Also, incidentally, 3 people in my family have been in situations where they
feel seat belts saved their lives.

Seat Belts:  Wear 'em!

Ron
