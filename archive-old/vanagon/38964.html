This message partly about listserv mechanics and partly about an interesting
engine conversion, since I don't know how many saw the original post.

Saturday in Princeton I saw an 84 Corvette V8 for sale.  It is set up for
installation in a Porsche 911, so would probably go *pretty* easily into
a Vanagon.  $1500.  I wrote a note to the list about it, but I never got
my copy from the list.  At least two people did, and wrote to me to say
that the return address had been changed to kennedy_at_their server's name,
which is a pretty good trick when you are not even attempting a hack.  I'm
interested in how that could happen, and back on the original topic would
of course love to see and hear a V8anagon if one of you wasserpumperfahrers
wanted to &quot;see my six and raise me two&quot;.

Gerry -- anything novel happening on the listserver on Saturday afternoon
last?  Should I talk to the people that run admin.njit_dot_edu?
