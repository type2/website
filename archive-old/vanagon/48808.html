As well as what others say to check, make sure that there is no hole
in the exhaust system letting in air.  This confuses the O2 sensor,
making it seem like there is too much air, not enough gas.  The fuel
injection then floods the engine.

Both this and the O2 sensor can be checked by unplugging the O2 and
trying it again.  You only need to unplug the single wire from the
sensor, not the double wire.
