Subject: Towing and easy hitches / 88 Weekender FS

The type of hitch that attaches to the tow hooks is made by Rigid Hitch
in Bloomington MN. I got mine from REcycled Bugs in Pontiac Mich.
810 373 2300

It's so easy (TWO bolts) and makes sense - the tow hooks were made to haul
the VANAGON, right? So there's lots of strength there.  The hitch is Class 1
(1000 lbs. / 100lbs.), but I used my 88 Weekender to haul a 13' Boler travel
trailer (not a tent trailer!) 3000 miles with the family, all our gear,
automatic and air conditioner going.  No problem.  A little slow on the big
mountain grades in Wyoming / Montana, but we made it.  That was two years ago
and my tranny is still fine. The Boler weighs about 1350 lbs. BTW.

I hooked on to my new trailer, a  1500 lb Trillium the other day, but it is
just too much, now that I live in the mountains.  I hooked it onto my 81
Volvo which handles it okay ( a little more HP and 4 wheel discs).

After seesawing back and forth a million times, the Weekender is thus for sale.
My kids are too big now, and we need the trailer.

Here's the latest price: $5000 US - I mean it...that's a good price, no?
Auto, AC, PS, Rear screen, 111,000 miles- no headleaks (gaskets done a few
years ago).
