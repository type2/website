Hey now

For folks outside of NJ, you can call the NJ Legislative Services
office directly for your copy of SCS-1700 at (609) 292-4840.

Please help me save my VWs!

	Thanks

&gt;      To all the folks living in NJ. The state is trying to toughen emission
&gt;      standards with a new bill, making it difficult for all older cars to pass.
&gt;      This will remove many cars from the road including vintage VW's. Listed
&gt;      below are two phone numbers one to obtain a free copy of the bill and one
&gt;      to complain to the govenor. Please take their threat seriously!
&gt; 
&gt;      Free Copy 1-800-792-8630   bill #SCS-1700
&gt; 
&gt;      Governor's Office (609)-292-6000
&gt; 
&gt;      Thank You in advance for all who participate.
