	Alistair,
	Nothing's wasted when the Digifant spritzers all spritz at once-
the fuel vapor just sits there at the end of the intake runner, right 
over the valve, any liquid fuel evaporates quickly, and when the intake
valve opens, the whole lot gets sucked neatly into the cylinder. 
	True, if the spritzers spritz just as a cylinder fires, then
at least one is probably spritzing over an open intake valve (the one
over the BDC cylinder, right?)

	Remember what an FI system does well: it produces a correctly
proportioned mixture at a wide variety of air-flows. Feeding cylinder firings
from the hall effect sensor or whatever as triggers to the FI system tells
it with NO ambiguity how often the cylinders are firing. The FI system then
simply has to meter out the correct dose of fuel for each cylinder- which
is basicly always the same amount of fuel, since the volume of the cylinder
is always the same. Boundary conditions like cold starts and throttle all
the way open can be factored in on a global basis rather than cylinder-
by-cylinder.

	Sure, for simplicities sake, we'd like to see the spritzers spritz
once, just before the intake valve opens.  But I suspect it doesn't
matter that much for efficiency.
