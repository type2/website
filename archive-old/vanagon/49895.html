So David Schwarze says:
&gt; expressed interest in carb jetting on dual Solex'd engines, I thought I
&gt; would share my experiences.  FI dorks might want to hit &quot;d&quot; now.  :-)  No
&gt; really, FI people aren't dorks, I'd be one misself if I could.  Except for
&gt; Steve Johnson, now he's a dork!  Hi Steve!  Did your bus make it home?  :-P

So what's your point?  I thought this was common knowledge...  ;)

&gt; which is an alltime best for my 4500lb, highroof camper.  The bus also ran
&gt; great at 8,000 feet, starting easily and idling smoothly where some others
&gt; were not so lucky.  On the downside, at lower elevations the engine tended
&gt; to buck a little during acceleration, and power might be off a little, tho
&gt; it is hard to tell.
Yeah, us dorks have the F.I. that adjusts for the ups and downs in life. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Well that's all, as usual comments, flames, etc. are welcomed.  Have a good
&gt; Friday, everyone...

Interesting post for a Geek!  ;p
