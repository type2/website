Subject: 87 westy

im a vw bus lover from my earliest driving days.  In fact , buses are all ive
owned.  my latest obsesion is a 87 westy that basically fell in my lap just
as my 81 westy was dying from overheating.(dam squirrels ate at my engine lid
insulation,,,and  it nicely distributed itself on top of my cylinders and oil
cooler.)  anyway...i have a couple of questions for anyone out ther who might
recognize the problems.
         My sliding door seems fine...but on the highway...it just pops open
at the rear of the door!   The margins line up well and sliding and closing
action seem good...but it still pops open.   Im thinking that body sway  or a
bump that lifts the sliding door a bit might contribute to the problem
but?????
          The a/c hasnt worked in a 3 years....and was diagnosed as needing a
new receiver drier.   I was told by the dealer(i hate dealers)  that a safety
button popped out on the rec/drier.....indicating the it needed to be
replaced...?  does this make sense to anybody?    whats this button?
          The other thing thats a bummer is that the fresh air fan dosnt
work.    Defrosting is going to be an issue. ( I live in 
new england)  Ive been told to check the ballast resistor.....but dont know
where it is....  anyone out there delt with this component?
          I truly love the vw campers....too bad the parts situation has to
be so outrageous.    I heard a horrible story the other day......vw destroys
parts!  parts we need and want...are to be destroyed....so that we'll have no
option but to order our parts from vw exclusively .  Dosnt that make u
mad!!!!!!
