&gt;  &gt; I have solved my problem about what kind of antifreeze to use in my '84

&gt;  &gt; antifreeze (about $6.50 locally).  That way, I can use a brand that I
&gt;  &gt; trust and a phosphate free antifreeze.

&gt;  Yes, but if that coolant ever comes into contact with any other brand,
&gt;  it will turn to jelly. Meaning if you bust a hose in West Texas and yoiu
&gt;  can't find that particular brand, you will have to drain the system and
&gt;  install whatever is available.

I've never heard that claim before.  What evidence supports this claim?
Even if true, one could just add water (temporarily) unless the temperatures
were really extreme.
