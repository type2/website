&gt; My &quot;special&quot; van (85, Standard tranny, non-westy, non-synchro) averages at
&gt; 22 mpg highway...  I can imagine 23 being possible if the speed is kept
&gt; right at 60 MPH.

I kept my '85 gl std at 53 mph (3000 rpm) over most of a 300 mile trip.  
The vehicle was loaded to the top with my moving-back-to-college-stuff.  
I got 27.? mpg on that tank...
It seems that my gas milage is higher on long trips when the van is 
loaded (more momentum...)
I generally average 21.5 now that I have converted it into a camper...
