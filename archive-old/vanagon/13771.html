So ROB can't-find-the-caps-lock-key GIMBY Shouts:
&gt; 
&gt; I AM NEW TO THIS LIST AND ALSO A NEW OWNER OF A VW, SO PLEASE FORGIVE 
&gt; ME IF MY QUESTION IS STUPID.  I JUST BOUGHT A 1975 CAMPER A FEW MONTHS
&gt; AGO AND MY QUESTION IS: WHEN I PLUG THE EXTENSION CHORD THAT COMES 
&gt; OUT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE VAN AND TURN THE AC CONVERTER SWITCH ON 
&gt; THAT IS UNDER SEAT THE RED LIGHT WILL FLICKER FOR A WHILE AND 
&gt; EVENTUALLY FADE.  I CAN PLUG APPLIANCES INTO THE ELECTRICAL SOCKET IN 
&gt; THE VAN AND THEY WILL WORK.  THE FRIDGE HOWEVER WON'T COME ON.  IS IT 
&gt; DISCONNECTED FROM THE CONVERTER SOMEWHERE?  WHERE DO I LOOK IF THIS 
&gt; IS THE CASE?  IS THE FRIDGE JUST OLD AND DEAD?
&gt; 

I didn't know '75's came with a powered fridge.  I thought they came
with ice boxes.  Oh will if DC powered, you may have a burned fuse
or bad connection.  Best to track it down from the fridge to the
fuse.
