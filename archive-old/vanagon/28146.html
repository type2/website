Subject: re: head gaskets &amp; bars leaks

I too have used barsleak with great results. It's been in the cooling 
system in my '85 for the last 55k miles. 

It seems that the wasserboxer does not like to idle. The needle on mine  
creeps up at idle in traffic jams but it's no different than before I 
added barsleak. I think the fault lies with the fan thermostat; it kicks 
on way too late. One of my projects is to put in a manual over-ride 
switch.
