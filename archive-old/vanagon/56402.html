Subject: HELP!!! 87 Syncro loss of compression (puttputtputt....)

Fellow list members HELP!,

            I did not think that I would be writing back so soon about a
problem with my new (98,700) seemingly all right syncro.  However something
has gone vary wrong (last letter was for a oil/coolant leak).   I was driving
today on a short 210 mile trip (form Conn to Martha's Vineyard Mass) and
after about 170 miles I lost acceleration (of course I was going up a hill on
the four lane Bourne bridge with no place to pull over), and the car seemed
to be struggling to stay on.  I pulled over and checked the engine out.  The
coolant level was fine and so was the oil level.  I started it up again and
it was fine.  [this was probably not the brightest move, but I had just
brought it in to the VW shop 3 days ago for a coolant leak (needed a new hose
to the water pump) and they found nothing else wrong with it and told me it
was cool to drive it on this trip  ]  So I finished the drive (another 30
miles).  I turned off the engine waited an hour and checked the coolant and
oil levels (no leaks) which were full/fine.  Turned it on and after 5 min it
started to stall (puttputtputt...) at idle I went around to the engine and
noticed a light whitish exhaust from exhaust pipe.  I turned it off checked
around the engine again for any signs of what could be causing this and did
not see anything visible.  So I started it up  to see the exhaust again, and
it was fine so I drove it to my house (at one point starting from a stop sign
in first gear it lagged and putted the then jumped forward and was &quot;fine&quot;)
and here it sits.  I know I have problems, but the thing is I am on an island
(Martha's Vineyard) and I need to know if it can be driven so that I can get
off the island and to the VW dealer in Hyanis  Mass ($$$$$$$$$?????????).
-Here again are the symptoms: Loss of acceleration/pressure, engine to wants
to stall then is OK and it drives &quot;fine&quot;,  NO visible leaks under or inside
the engine compartment, Coolant and oil levels fine with no signs of either
in each other,  a whitish exhaust with (only once I noticed this) clear
liquid spitting out of the exhaust pipe (possibly water), starts up and
drives but every now and then it happens (pressure loss...) and then it
drives fine.
-Here are the ideas that I have:  Blown cylinder head gasket (but there is no
leaking
coolant and it drives OK for miles at a time),  spark plugs,  water in the
gas,  gas line frozen??....

Please any and all help.  I need to know if it can/should be driven so that I
know whether it needs to be towed off the island  (and more importantly if I
can drive 200 miles back to Conn so that I can show up for work on Wens).

Thank you,
Chris Wright
