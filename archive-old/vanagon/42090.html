&gt; Seems all the bolts but ONE fell out of the driver side reduction 
&gt; box/swingarm assembly.  I got under there last night to install a 
&gt; couple new bolts, and noticed one bolt was sheared off.  ACK.

I had similiar experiences.  My solution was to disassemble it down to 
the swing tube, take it to a machine shop and have them put thread 
inserts into the soft metal inner casing of the reduction boxes.  It is a 
good idea not to use any 'screwed' up bolts when you put it all back 
together.  8-)    Good luck.
