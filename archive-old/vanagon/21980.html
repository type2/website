Subject: QUESTION--Engine Restorer &amp; Tires

Hi,

Has anyone used the product &quot;Engine Restorer&quot;.  I have heard only good 
things but I am interested if anypone has heard anything Bad?  It is an 
Oil addative that is suppused to lubricate and increase compression.  
You add it with each oil change.

Also---Whats the skinny on the LIGHT TRUCk TIRES that we are supposed 
to use on Westy's.  When I got my 76' it had standard passanger tires 
and they are ready to go.  The nice folks at the tire place asked if I 
wanted to go with the passanger tires again or the Light Truck tires it 
was supposed to have.

Any advise is of course appreciated.

Thanks

Joe
