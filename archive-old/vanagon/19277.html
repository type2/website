Subject: temperatures on 70 westie

I have just added a rev counter, an oil temp gauge and a cylinder head gauge
to my 70 westphalia.

There have been a series of discussions re max revs, and temperatures.
What is a sensible max rpm for cruising?
what is the danger point on cylinder head temp for #3?
What should the oil temp be?
What is a reasonable gas mileage, I seem to be averaging about 18mpg?
If anyone has a reasonable viewpoint please let me know.
Sam Williams
