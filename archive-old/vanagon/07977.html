Subject: vanagon - pressure bleed brakes? 

I replaced the master cylinder and two rear wheel cylinders on my '87
vanagon and have tried to bleed the brakes the old fashioned way by pumping
them, still very spongy. Yes, I followed all the recommendations about
bleeding order, etc and have done it repeatedly.

So I got one of those hand vacuum pumps, and pumped until my hand was
paralyzed, still didn't help much. Now I'm wondering if I should build a
pressure bleeder or pay someone else to do it. Or if there's some other
problem I'm missing. The new master cyl is german and seems ok, anyway it
doesn't leak (?) It's curious that the front brake lines are designed so
that they loop upward, like a custom design just so you have to do a
pressure bleed. Any opionions, experiences?

Thanks, Tom
