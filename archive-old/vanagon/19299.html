Subject: reimo info


Enough people privately requested info on the Reimo firm in Germany,
that I felt it warranted a public post.  They seem to have at least
7 stores in their chain in Germany alone.  The particular catalog
I have does not list store in other countries, so perhaps our British
brothers/sisters can help us there, but here's the info from my
catalog, which a friend of mine picked up in person and mailed
to me from Germany:

Reimo Kassel (Kassel is the city)
Proprietor:  Wolfgang Gaebel
Hannoversche Strasse 30
34266 Niestetal-Sandershausen
bei Kassel

Telephone:  0561-52 54 57
Fax:        0561-52 88 36
