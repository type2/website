Subject: '85 FOR SALE, PARTS or WHOLE

I'm considering selling the '85, I will sell it whole or I will part it,
I'm tired of the damn thing basically it is cursed.  The body is
quite straight and in fair condition (minor seam rust) as it was 
rustproofed, but every damn thing attached to it, brakes, tranny, 
suspension bits, are severely corroded in order to combat the fair 
condition of the body.  It was cursed for the last owner as well the 
following sums up his investment in the beast, I have receipts for 
all of these repairs. 82k miles currently.  The main reason is I just 
bought the '90 and have no real use for this damn thing.

Power Steering Rack	04/26/91	$841.11
O2 sensor, muffler, flush brakes,	06/19/91	$412.79
flush cooling system		
Water Pump, Thermostat, and	11/15/93	$473.06
housing.		
NOW THE BIG ONE	02/25/94	$2,238.91
2 new VW heads, gasket kit, all new		
pushrod tubes, clutch, pressure		
plate, to bearing, front exhasut pipe		
AGAIN?? (different shop though)		
(Hell, they even wrote ThanK You		
on the receipt)		
New Micro Switches on TB	08/10/94	$179.41

And others for regular coolant, oil changes, etc. all summing a total 
of  $5,809.09 in service between '91 and '96.

I have added new front to rear coolant pipes,new P/S pipes, new Dansk exhaust,
one front spindle, new front rotors, and more to the tune of about $1000.

I'd prefer to part it frankly, engine is very solid, good 
compression, good oil pressure, heads done as indicated.

I'd like $1500 for the longblock (with exhaust pipes, clutch)
$200 for all the FI bits
$275 for the tranny (case is rather corroded, works well, 1st whines 
barely perceptibly, Parts Place wants $500)
$200 for the P/S rack (can't keep for the '90 this one is using ATF, 
'90 uses Pentosin)
$200 interior (blue velour weekender interior, no rips, fairly clean)
$100 each entire front door assembly locks glass etc.

all other bits and pieces priced upon request.  I'd rather part it as 
I need the windshield and some of the body panels, plus although it 
is a solid running vehicle something is always about to go on it it 
seems.  It has been down for me as much as it has been up for one 
reason or another.

$2500 firm would take the entire van however, there are much worse on 
the road every day.

Nothing is gauranteed, this has been a frank representation of it's 
condition, anything on this beast could drop dead tomorrow.  The PO 
was second owner since '90 and cared well for it, I have done the 
same.  If I can get takers for the major components I will part it 
immediately, obviously most of the major bits will be prohibitive to 
ship so I'm selling primarily to east coast, and central atlantic 
takers here.  I'm 2.5 hours form Baltimore, DC, Pittsburg, Lexington 
KY, etc.  I will however palletize and ship the bigger stuff, working 
some deal on the shipping if requested.
