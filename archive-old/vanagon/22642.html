Subject: Dead motor = Dead Vanagon?

	Recently dead motor (connecting rod through case) in an other wise
solid '86 Vanagon Gl (non-syncro, non-camper).  Everything else works
fine; a/c, all electrics, etc.

	Prices for replacement motor running: 
		$2K - junk yard (50k miles)
		$2.3K - VW rubuilt long block

	The questions are:
		Rebuild or junk the Vanagon?
		If I rebuild, what are my odds with a junk yard engine?
		If junk the Vanagon, what can I get for it ?

	I have neither the time nor the space to play junk yard and sell it 
off in parts if I junk It.  Any Ideas?
