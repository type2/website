Subject: Rear shock absorber replacement, '83 Vanagon


Howdy,

For an '83 watercooled Vanagon, I like to replace its rear shock absorbers
myself. Would you please forward me your help on these?
   (1). step-by-step of how-to-replace them.
   (2). which brand (a mid-range quality is fine)?
   (3). any helpful hints. (My VW shop manual doesn't even say anything
        about this job. Maybe it is a job too easy for many people to even
        worthwhile explaining it.)
Thank you very much.

Regards,
James
