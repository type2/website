 SyncroBeast           re&gt;Battery Size
Vanagon normal under seat battery box area (either side) takes either of the
following two battery types, a type 41 or a type 42 battery.  Buy the biggest
baddest bestest type 41 you can find.  The type 41 is 2 inches longer, and my
Champion purchased at SAM's Club for $50 is rated at 850 CCA.


'89 Syncro Beast
'87 GTI 16V
'86 Scirocco (SO's)
