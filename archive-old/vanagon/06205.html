Hi Folks.  I have ALWAYS changed the oil within the first 1500 km, and
I religiously change the oil every 6000 Km or 3 months, whatever comes
first. The filter gets changed EVERY time the oil does as well.

I believe the first oil change is the most critical, to remove any filings
from within the engine.  I also never fill the crankcase.  I usually run
the oil levels from one third to 2 thirds full as to leave lots of room
for fruid expansion from heat.

I have a '90 Syncro and an '87 Golf Diesel.

Thx.
Harry

 Hi, everybody!

 For those of you out there who bought your vehicles new, when did you do
 your first oil change?  After 1K miles, 3K, 5K,...or the VW recommended
 7.5K?

 I ask because the dealer salesperson backed up VW's recommendation of 7.5K,
 citing the need for various engine seals to seat and absorb whatever oil
 necessary to prevent leakage later on (this guy was an enthusiast, too).

 Conventional wisdom says to change the oil every 3K or so (or 50-60 engine
 hours), except a lot of folks do their first change at 1K because of
 various metallic bits floating around...

 So what do you all think?

 TIA
 Norman
