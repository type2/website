Subject: Re: Posting Sweepstakes



This mini tempest about &quot;posting sweepstakes&quot; and frivolous postings
pisses me off. Let me try and explain.
 
The analogy made about this group being like some
business/technical/scientific meeting is a good one. I think all of us go
to such meetings, listen to or give lectures, look at displays,
discuss/argue... But you also make jokes, catch up on (admit it) gossip,
go off on tangents unrelated to the meeting. We're humans, we thrive on
human contact. Admittedly the analogy breaks down, private - public
conversations are not so distinct on a list.
The digressions into non-van realms are unavoidable, just are digressions
in normal conversation. The thread usually comes back round or is dropped.
I think we all know when enough is enough, without being told.
I was the one who made the joke about a race for 2,3rd place in the
postings sweepstakes, but I made the joke assuming that the group knew it
was a joke. Did anybody really consider flooding the list?

I look forward to reading this list, I really enjoy the chatter and
especially the technical posts. In a way it is very liberating to be able
to ask or answer questions with a group of people who won't say, &quot;jeez
Alistair, can't you think of anything else but your van?&quot;
Come to think about it, the digressions are a wee peek into our other
interests.

So here I sit, spouting :)

The holidays will soon be over, and we can start the new year with a
healthy mix of left and right side brain postings.

Happy Hogemanay to you all!

Alistair
