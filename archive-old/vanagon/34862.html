Subject: Re: gas milage on a 75 fuely

thanks aaron and all others for the ideas and help.  my bus runs real 
nicely when it is warmed up.  right  now the routine is this.  

it starts up right away and idols fine untill the cold start valve stops 
injecting.  then the RPM's drop amnd the bus will stall.  after i take 
off and give it gas, it runs fine.  if i come to a stop while the motor 
is still cold, it will lug (the whole car shakes) and stall.  i am taking 
it out of gear for the mean time to stop it from stalling.  once i have 
driven for a while, (about 5 miles)  the engine idols great and the whole 
car runs great.  i still get the bad gas milage, but it does not stall.  
as of now i am getting info and waiting for a free day to go through the 
whole engine.  give it a tune up and check out the FI system.

thanks again to all who have given me ideas and tips.  boy do i miss the 
easier 40 hp motors.  they are so much simpler to work on.  makes me 
wounder why i am keeping this westy.  

take care and God Bless
matt

ps.  when i come to my sences, i will probably have a westy for sale or 
trade it for a early one.
