&gt; Ok, ok, I know it doesn't have ANYTHING to do with vw's or even cars,
&gt; but I just couldn't resist, being that it's &quot;almost&quot; Friday:
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; The results of the Spam Haiku contest!!!!!

&gt;   Cold, Pink, gelatinous mass,
&gt;   The potted meat for which I crave,
&gt;   Warns of impending earthquake.

I have a good friend who was the plant engineer for a Spam processing 
facility.  This is definitly a &quot;pass on&quot; to him.  He always is 
semi-indignant at our attempts at Spam humor.  His biggest tormentor 
is a guy who got to eat Spam for 3 months during Desert Storm! :-(
