Subject: VANAGON digest 469

Lisa Quinn wants to rebuild the heads on her '81 Vanagon.  My
advice is to spring for new heads instead of rebuilding the old
ones.  I had rebuilt heads on a rebuilt engine in my '80
vanagon, and maybe 15K miles (maybe 3K miles past warranty)
after the rebuild, one of the seats kind of receded (&quot;got
sucked&quot;) into the head, resulting in 0 compression.  (Easy to
check for, but expensive to fix.)

Now, finding new heads might be tricky too.  Even the VW dealer
in Redwood City, CA couldn't get new heads.  I don't know where
my mechanic finally found new heads, but you can ask him if you
like.  (Paul at The BUGgie Works in Redwood City, area code 415).

Good Luck!
Dennis
P.S.  How did you get 143K miles on your Vanagon?  Mine is a
year older and only has 88K miles!
