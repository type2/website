 &gt; Using modeling clay, build
 &gt; a volcano-looking dam around the drill site, sloped according to the angle 
of
 &gt; the glass you're working on.  (This won't work if the glass is in a vertical
 &gt; position.)  Fill the crater of the volcano with a mixture of oil and
 &gt; carborundum abrasive.  

Put something UNDER the glass, because when the drill breaks through the stuff 
will RUN OUT all OVER whatever is beneath.  Ick.

Other than that, excellent instructions.
