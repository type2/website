Subject: Coolant pipe

Hey Guys,

Ended up going to the dealer to get a new coolant pipe for the left side
of the engine.  When I inspected my old one I noticed that it had rusted
all the way through.  If you own a 86 or later check your pipe where it
connects to the waterpump, if it's bubbled up get ready to replace it. 
After checking the archives I noticed that this is a 10 year part.  

FYI, the part # is 025-121-081G, list price is $95.57 - net price
$91.00.
