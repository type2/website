I think you're the 4th person in the last few weeks to describe the 
hiccup problem (problem #2).  There have been some suggestions as to the 
possible cause of this problem, but I haven't heard that anyone has found 
a cure.  I have asked at least one person to let us all know if they're 
able to fix the problem.  The symptoms are so similar that it's gotta be 
(I'm hoping) the same cause for all of us.  Maybe one of the experts out 
there will come up with something.

&gt; Hi There!
&gt; 
&gt;         Pulled the '80 Westfalia out of the garage couple of weeks ago after
&gt; a cold and lengthy hibernation.  Fired up right off with a bit of clatter
&gt; from the lifters but they settled down with in a reasonable period of time.
&gt; 
&gt;         Couple of things have been bothering me since I acquired the machine
&gt; last year. We've only put a thousand or so kilometres on it and the PO says
&gt; he did a tuneup shortly before selling, including new ignition wires.  Looks
&gt; to be so and the plugs are clean and gapped properly, but that's all I've
&gt; checked.  But what happens is this:
&gt; 
&gt;         1.  On startup and until the engine is at operating temperature, the
&gt; rpms surge.  It doesn't stall, but the idle dies down and then comes up to a
&gt; point beyond normal and this tends to continue until things warm up, at
&gt; which time the idle settles down to a constant.
&gt; 
&gt;         2.  This second thing really bugs me!  Driving at a constant speed,
&gt; for example 80 kilometres in fourth gear, I get a hiccup in the engine.
&gt; This is sometimes almost unnoticable, while at other times it is more
&gt; pronounced.  The van has plenty of pep and runs very well otherwise.  It
&gt; will do this on occasion even when accelerating, but it is infrequent.  This
&gt; &quot;skip&quot; will occur at any speed, in any gear, but usually when at a constant
&gt; speed.
&gt; 
&gt;         I've noticed both situations since we got the van.  Sitting over the
&gt; winter has neither improved or degraded the situtation.  As an initial step,
&gt; I have added a water-eliminator and fuel-injection cleaner to the last tank
&gt; of gas and that has pretty well been used up but there is no noticable
&gt; change.  If anyone out there has experienced the same problems, your input
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.  
&gt; 
&gt;         Thanks in advance for your help....
