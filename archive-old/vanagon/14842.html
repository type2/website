&gt;&gt;Howabout a trip thru NH, VT or even Cape Cod for part of the Eastern

Although it would be impossible for me to even participate in the Western
leg of the GNATT, I was thinking that Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream usually
sponsor a bus get together in Vermont. Month and date for 1995 is unknown to
me but I always wish I could attend that event. Maybe this could be a GNATT
stop. Make mine Cherry Garcia on a cone!
