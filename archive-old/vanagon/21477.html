Subject: '73 Uneven Braking

Hi All,
I have a problem when braking in my '73 kombi..
It feels as though the front left brake is not on all of the time,
it's as if the brake is applied for half a rotation of the wheel and
then the pressure it lessened for the other half(ish) of the rotation.
The van manages to stop OK, but it just doesn't feel right.
Can this be a warped disc? Doesn't seem too warped..

Has anyone else had this kind of problem, how is it fixed?
and how is it caused??

Thanks
Carl
