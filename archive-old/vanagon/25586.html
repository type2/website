Subject: Re: Weber setup on a '73 bus...


&gt;It took my about two months to  realize that the Weber &amp; 009 distr.
&gt;setup requires totally different timing settings as the values per
&gt;Muir's and that had been the cause of my '73 bus misfiring and
&gt;suffering... (yeah... a novice learning the hard way...). Now, my bus
&gt;is not misfiring anymore, but it seems that my Weber setup is not
&gt;behaving too well... when i try to accelerate, the engine has a lot of
&gt;trouble picking up rpms, specially when the engine is cold. The
&gt;symptom is very much like Muirs diagnosis of a clugged heat riser:
&gt;&quot;... a period of hesitation after you've pushed down on the
&gt;accelerator to speed up the car...&quot;.

My former 73 bus had a 2 barrel progressive Solex which was very
similar to the Weber I had in my 77 bus.  I too had a problem with
stumbling and hesitation upon acceleration.  After days of fiddling
with the carb I finally realized the cause was the accelerator
pump was dumping too much fuel,  momentarily flooding the engine.
After backing out the adjustment screw for the accelerator pump
piston it worked just fine.  

I also had a 009 and had to time the engine at about 30-32 degrees
fully advanced.
