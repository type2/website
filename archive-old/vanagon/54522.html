Subject: Up'n'comming road trip, hitch quest, and..umm..


Hey Everybody...crossposted cause each list may have their own interests 
here..:)

First, looks like i'm taking a trip out to oregan., somewhere..

Be taking my time with it, seeing a few sighst, etc.


Final departure is planned as Beatrice Nebraska. Sometiem around march1, 
maybe a little later.

we may do a bit of west coast exploring when we get there, maybe a bit of 
exploring along the way too..

any body have places to see, routes to take, not to take, the best way to 
get over them mountains, people to meet (and maybe get a meal to!:)

all ideas welcome.

I do plan to go up to seattle, cause my cousin lives there...

then, the return trip may invlove a stop back here in KC, Mo, but it may not.

Eventual final destination is Augusta Georgia.


now the hitch..

I know someone out there has a hitch on their early 'loaf...right?
do you have plans for it? or maybe just ideas...

Or where i could get one ready made? (we'd rather not haveto design our 
own, ya know...)

anyway, thanks everyone.....david...
