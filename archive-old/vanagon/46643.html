&gt; 'points', and 'rotors' when I hit the road. I have NO IDEA what these are,
&gt; so could someone enlighten me a bit?
&gt;         My Bentley should be here on monday so hopefully it'll clarify alot
&gt; of my curiosities, but till then any help would be appreciated.

Points don't apply since the w/c engines don't have them, and 
I don't think the a/c vanagon do either. I'd say replace your 
dist. cap &amp; rotor before leaving if you can (or haven't done so in 
the last 20k or so). If it were me, I'd check the looks of the 
rotor &amp; cap and buy new ones anyway - replace if they're worn, keep 
for spares if they look ok. A worn cap / rotor will show lots of 
pitting on the contacts. It's 5 minute job tops.

Also - check carefully all the fuel line junctions from the tank 
back. My '88 had a leak at the coupler just ahead of the engine, 
which was hard to spot, but could have meant disaster. If the clamps 
look rusty (and are the factory crimp-on type) replace with stainless 
screw-on clamps. If you can move the clamp *at all* on the hose, then 
it's too loose.
