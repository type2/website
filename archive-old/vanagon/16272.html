Subject: Re: SW BC (W WA?) Pizza!!

&gt;
&gt;Ok, I've heard from Harry Yates and Jesus Dizon about camping.  Good.  
&gt;Camping sometime, someplace this summer we go, along with anyone else 
&gt;interested!  Yippee!
&gt;
&gt;Pizza seems a little less difficult right now, at least until the snow 
&gt;melt off the mountains a bit!  :-)   Harry suggested the 2nd week of May 
&gt;for pizza.  Let's put faces to names and get all the area netters 
&gt;together.  According to Joel's stats, we got 10 in BC ('fraid a lot of 
&gt;these folks are on the Island), and 14 (count 'em!) in W Washington.
&gt;OK, maybe Seattle's a little far for pizza (maybe not...), but aren't 
&gt;there people up B'ham way?  Island people: here's an excuse to take the 
&gt;ferry!  :)
&gt;
&gt;Suggestions on a restaurant?  Exact date? Etc, etc?
&gt;
&gt;BTW, all who are interested, let me know where you live so we can try to 
&gt;meet in a place that's reasonably central.
