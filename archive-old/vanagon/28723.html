&gt;&gt; OK,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now I'm sadly sure even now that this is primarily going to end up a
&gt;&gt; west coast thing, so before that happens, since the likelihood
&gt;&gt; of us east coasters having enough time to get out there, then
&gt;&gt; blow 3 weeks then get back is for most of us totally impossible,
&gt;&gt; I feel we need an alternative, and less we fail to get on the
&gt;&gt; ball I think we should start planning alternatives now.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I myself have been bending over backwards trying to work out a way to
&gt;go from North CArolina.But, indeed, 7 weeks is a LOOOOOOONG vacation, and
the State usually
&gt;doesn't like such things...
&gt;Anyway, I really really really want to be in on *something* bus-trip
&gt;related, so tentatively count me in for such an east coast thing.

&gt;
Yip, I am all for an East Coast trip.  I am planing on something similar to
previously mentioned plan 2. We make a 2 week transcontinental US run out to
Vancouver.  But I am flexible (Just not crazy about driving ~2000 miles on
gravel road.)
