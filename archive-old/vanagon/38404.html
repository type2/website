Subject: Setting end play

Jim,

Flywheels are pretty tough.  Pry on one with a screwdriver, you'll break the
part of the crankcase serving as a fulcrum, or bend the screwdriver, long
before you'll do any harm to the flywheel.

You should check the end-play each time you replace the clutch, and adjust it
to spec if it is worn beyond five thousandths of an inch.  You'll need to use
some pretty gross methods to detect end-play in a fully assembled engine due
to the drag of the rods, fan belt and the #1 seal.  The large amount of drag
justifies the use of a lever of some sort to shift the flywheel.  Adjusting
end-play in an assembled engine is an entirely different procedure than doing
so during initial assembly.

When you rebuild an engine, you want to determine end-play as early as
possible after the basic crankcase-work, including any align-boring, is
completed. This allows you to work with a bare crank and flywheel, no seals
or rods to add drag, just the #1 bearing so you'll have the thrust face, and
the #4, so the crank won't bind.  This allows you to get a perfect,
repeatable figure in your measurements using only hand-pressure to slide the
crank back and forth.  Such a minimal set-up allows you to dismantle the
crankcase quickly, should you wish to take a little meat off the thrust
flange to adjust the clearance.  This is how I'm able to set -- and to hold
-- a tighter than stock thrust clearance.  Assuming the flywheel runs in a
truly perpendicular plane, you can get by with a thrust clearance of a fat
.0015&quot; to a slim .0020&quot;, just enough to insure adequate oiling when things
heat up.

The small clearance means less 'working' of the crank as you shift gears and
when the load on the engine changes.  Such working is what puts a side-load
on your rods.  The more an engine can 'work' along the Z-axis of the crank,
the faster the big-end of the rods will wear and the hotter it will run.
 According to some mechanics, excessive end-play is a major contributor to
ovaled main bearings.  I'm not too sure about that one but everyone pretty
much agrees on the effects of excessive end-play on your rods.

Don't misunderstand this.  Close is good when it comes to oil clearance.
 Tight is bad.  Close implies a uniform fit.  Tight means something is
dragging.  If your end-play is set too tight you'll ruin the engine when it
heats up.  

Best bet?  Stick to the low side of the stock spec -- .003&quot; -- until you've
rebuilt a few engines.  Better a little loose than a ruined engine.

Since end-play is a critical factor in engine longevity, I'm going to make
this a general post.
