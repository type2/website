Subject: Re: rusted vent-wings

&gt;that whole back side window- vent wing and 3/4 glass- and &gt;replaced it with
a  pretty-lookin' new seal encircling my &gt;1-PIECE window.  
&gt; No more leaks there, mom.

I intend to do the same thing with my 72. The 77 i've been
scavaging off of had a pair of one piece windows (closet side
and rear driver side) The trade-off is a little less window ventilation, but
with the top open you'd never notice.
I did eye the later model 82-? sliding windows which appear
in the sliding door &amp; oppisite drivers side, but I already got
a pair of jalosies and didn't know whether they would match
up to the window frames.
