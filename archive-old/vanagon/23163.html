You think you have a &quot;bug&quot; with vws? Wait 'til you get into micro mini
cars!!! 8^))))))   You may have seen an BMW Isetta or a Messerschmidt. Rusty
and his brother in law are into them. Scooters are already a big thing. A
hold over from Sal Mineo (another sign that I'm an old farht) and later the
1980's &quot;Mod&quot; crowds. You can find scooter web sights by doing a search in
Netscape using the keyword &quot;Scooters.&quot; also try &quot;coffee&quot; and &quot;mod.&quot;   &gt;
&gt;While at the Pescados fish taco vanagon/bus meet yesterday in Sacramento,
&gt;I got my first glimpse of something called a &quot;scooter car.&quot;  I only
&gt;saw it for a moment, but it was sorta like a motorcycle-sized thing,
&gt;but wrapped in a car body.  It had I think 2 wheels on the front,
&gt;and one on the back.

&gt;I'm fascinated!  Does anyone know anything about these cars?  When
&gt;and where made?  STill available?  Specs?  Success?  I'm told there
&gt;may even be some sort of scooter club, either on the 'net or off.  
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, any info you can give me I'll be very eager to get!
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
