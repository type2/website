I've a 1980 Van converted by Country Homes, and thats exactly the way 
they did it. The screens are still in good shape, however, the screew 
look pretty bad, and there is a ugly looking spot of rust forming in the 
body under one of the screws. I will try to take the screens off without 
causing too much damage and see whats happening underneath. Maybee it 
only needs some rust treatment, new screews, and a good amount of silicone..
