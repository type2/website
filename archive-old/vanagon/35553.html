&gt;In rebuilding an '80 vanagon engine I replaced a chipped pushrod and

&gt;My parts supplier says I do NOT have to replace the old ones if they are the
&gt;same length and the correct (new) one, which they are.  I see that
&gt;hydraulic-type pushrods cost about three times as much.  Can I really just
&gt;use the old ones?

Ends are diffent by manufacturer.  The part differences are the lenght.  The
solid lifter push rods are slightly longer.  It would be real unusual for a
vanagon engine to have the wrong push rods.  They all had hydraulic lifters
and the heads are different from the breadbox engines.  Doubt they got
switch.  Although anything is possible.
