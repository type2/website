Listess,

  I've yet to hear a Vanagon Ball Joint &quot;Clunk&quot; like a Bug or a Bus Ball
Joint?

  I have seen the Control Arm busing TOTALLY worn out, no5thing but the
steel sleeve left!

  Inspect these items!  You can visually see the Upper control arm
busings if you peel in there.  More than likely that the source of the
noise.

  But who knows, I'm just a guy that works on these things everyday:)
