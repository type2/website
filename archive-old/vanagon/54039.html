Subject: bucking clutch
Date: Thu, 9 Jan 1997 19:06:43 -0500 (EST)

I too have been living with the bucking clutch problem.  I am
also among those with a new clutch set.  This never happened
with my old clutch, and my mechanic says i am full of _at_#$% b/c
he can't get it to happen.  I have noticed that temperature
does not seem to matter and it happens most often in reverse.
Any ideas are much appreciated.
TIA
