We have had terrific luck with a cleaner called: Spray Nine by Knights:
you still need elbow grease but it does bring back the white. Buy it in
bulk from Price Club or equivalent. DC

&gt; ***  Also, I'm trying tho clean the headliner the best I can.  I've used foam
&gt; upholstry cleaners, and simple green.  My headliner was installed new in '87
&gt; and has upheld very good, but I am trying to find something that will bring
&gt; a brighter white back.  Any ideas on cleaners that are good in lifting dirt
&gt; would be helpful.

&gt; If you don't leave it on too long (and don't get it on your hands... yuck!) I've 
&gt; used Super Clean by Castrol with great success.  I've used it to clean up the 
&gt; material for the interior panels before putting 'em on new board, I've used it 
&gt; for part of my headliner, and more.  It's good stuff, but if you don't get all 
&gt; of it off it will start to do damage.  It can even take off paint if it's on 
&gt; long enough.
&gt; 
&gt; Brendan, sorry I missed you this weekend.  I tried calling around 4 on Saturday, 
&gt; but you were already gone.  Talk to you later.
