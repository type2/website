&gt; To all,

&gt; 	I am stuck with the problem on both the drivers and passengers door
&gt; that if the door is locked and you pull the trigger (for lack of a better word)
&gt; to open the door you can no longer unlock the door with a key. This of course
&gt; must be the best part of owning a walk through bus since I have to go in
&gt; through the sliding door. I have not pulled off the door panels yet but, it
&gt; seems strange that both sides work likes this! Has anyone seen this or know of
&gt; the fix?

I had a problem with the lock on my '71 bus. I'm assuming the lock on 
yours will be the same as mine here in Australia.

I could turn the key but it would not unlock the door. I didn't have the 
problem of not being able to unlock the door if I pulled the trigger first.
 
When I pulled the cover off the inside of the door, I noted that an 
extension of the lock mechanism moved inside a u-shaped piece of metal 
which, when pushed down, unlocked the door (not open, just unlock) and the lock on the inside would pop out (the opposite to locking it). The extension to the lock was 
a type of pin shaped doova about a 1/4&quot; in diameter. The shoulders were 
worn and weren't pushing against the u shaped piece. I improvised by 
warming and forcing a piece of hard but flexible plastic tube (almost like 
nylon, a riser from a drip irrigation system) over the pin. 

Now when I turn the key, the pin pushes against the u-shaped piece and the 
door unlocks, but not if I have closed it up completely, that is slammed 
it. I sort of have to leavve it half closed. If I close it properly I 
have to get in through the passenger door like the PO (a cousin) did for 
years.

Once I figured out what need to be done the whole job took less than 1/2 
hour. 

I don't know if this is your problem but I hope this info helps.

Good luck
