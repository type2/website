&gt;The 9' 10&quot; size is the largest size you can install on the Westfalia
&gt;without it protruding from either end of the van. Installed, it's about 4&quot;
&gt;shorter than the pop top at each end and extends 8' from the van when
&gt;opened.

I have the 12 foot model (actually 11'6&quot;) Catalina on a 78 Westy- it is
just the length of the poptop + rack,  a few inches shorter than the rain
gutter at each end.  The supports are mounted at either end of sliding
door, behind the rear window, and a homemade support between front top
carrier and the back of awning carrier. (you only get 3 supports) With this
length you can shade the front door, rear window, and even mount the stock
VW ten under it without carrying the poles.  (won't be a driveaway, but
quick to setup and take down!)   If you set this up on asphalt (like at the
short in a parking lot), angle the poles to each tire and fasten them via
rope or short bugee around the tire footprint to prevent a wind picking it
all up- I don't usually pull the awning all the way out in such a situation
(you can lock it at any length from van), just enough to shade car.  BTW,
park the van so  passenger side faces SOUTH- will shade itself on north
side, and awning shades long south side!
