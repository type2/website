Subject: engine died

We drove our '81 Westie down to the station to have our new tires mounted.
Ran great.  Got there and shut it off.  A few minutes later they started it
and drove it into a bay.  Shut it off.  An hour later the tires were
mounted, so I started it and drove to the pump.  Shut it off, Filled it,
and then we started it and went on down the road.  Still no problem.

About a mile up the street there was a stop sign.  While braking as I
approached the stop sign, the engine died.  Wouldn't restart.  We got out.
Could smell gas faintly.  I checked for spark, and it was fine.  We waited
an hour, but still wouldn't start.  Called AAA.  They came out.  Still
wouldn't start.  They towed us home and unhooked the car from the tow
truck.  I got in and it started right up.  Seems to be running fine.

I'm not sure where to look, but we don't really trust it now, and I want to
find out what happened.  Any ideas??

Thanks,
