What year is your VW?  On the earlier models (I can vouch for those from 
68-71, for sure), the starter is a cinch-eroonie.  Two bolts, and CLONK!! 
out it comes (be careful, it might fall on your head).  Oh yeah, 
disconnect the battery first.  And all of the wires, carefully noting 
from where they came (on mine, there's only two, a really thin one and 
the cable from the battery).  You don't need no steenkin' Bentley (though 
it's nice).  

HOWEVER, this may be a battery cable/ground strap problem.  They're a lot 
cheaper to replace, and can often mimic problems associated with a bad 
starter.
