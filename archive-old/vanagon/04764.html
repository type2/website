&gt; Doh?  What's this doh?&gt; &gt; 

It was Doh!  Like when Homer Simson goes Doh!!  

&gt; &gt; Hey, you too have this life style.  Just quit your job.  I did it. Or 
&gt; more precisely,  will.  But, by the looks of your vehicles you have a 
&gt; pretty good job. Maby you should think that over a few times.&gt; 

I'll take it under consideration.  What are you going to do after the trip?
Look for a job?  By the way, it's only 2 cars owned and the rest were previously 
owned.  I'm in no way, shape or form rich. :(

&gt; WOW!
&gt; I just printed this list.
&gt; Sounds like you`ve been there.

Oh yeah...

&gt; Invaluable information.  Some of the stuff we have some I went out and 
&gt; bought last night. More stuff to buy next week.  Good sale at Sears.

Hope my suggestions didn't break the bank!  ;)

&gt; Summer?  Summer is for wimps. 
Not in Souther Nevada....

&gt;Winter is for No tourists.

Very true.


&gt; Besides we're from Vermont anything over 30 is a heat wave.

I've been there.  30 in Montreal would be Hell....  ;)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Can you grill tofu on them? (just kidding, well, not really).

Sorry about that.  Vegetarian BBQ maybe?

&gt; 
&gt; Hey Steven,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks so much for all your help.
&gt; Hope this reply is not too hard to read.&gt; 

Not hard to read at all.  And your welcome.

Enjoy your trip!

Steven
