Subject: Pfeiffer caravan bay area time change


Due to last minute time changes, I'll be leaving the East Bay Friday for
Pfeiffer not quite as early as I had originally intended.  Perhaps this
will allow for more people to join in the caravan.  At any rate, I'll be
leaving the Oakland area at 11:45, then will swing by to Bradley's in
Hayward with luck about noon.  If anyone wants to join in from either city,
or from any other points south, please let me know.
