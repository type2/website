&gt;So I guess the question remains, does anyone know of a low cost alternative
&gt;to Dynamat that doesn't limit your life span?

Don't know whether this would work, but you might try blankets from
printing presses. Used ones. I'm sure printers would be happy to give them
to you because they're worthless once they get low spots in them. They're
made of laminated smooth rubber, pattern-embossed rubber, and textile
fabric. Anywhere from 1/16&quot; to 3/8&quot; think, depending.

If you want to visalize it, it would be sort of like a flexible pressurized
laminate made of many Playtex dishwashing gloves. I don't know that it
would deaden sound well, but I'd be willing to bet that it would.

As for me, I say &quot;wind noise, schmind noise!&quot; It's part of The Way. (Some
people like not being able to hear the kids squabble.) ;)
