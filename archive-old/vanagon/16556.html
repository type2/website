Subject: Re: Sink cabinet for 71 Westy-how to find
Date: Fri, 28 Apr 95 16:23:47 EDT

&gt; 
&gt; I'm missing what I believe is a &quot;sink cabinet&quot; assembly for my 71 which is 
&gt; supposed to go right behind the fron passenger (U.S. :-)) seat - am I correct 
&gt; and does anyone have advice on how I'd go about finding one?  Anyone seen them 
&gt; anywhere, other than the obvious luck of stumbling onto one at a junkyard 
&gt; (which I've tried to do already).

Ken, where are you? There is a really rusted '70 sitting near me
that I have been thinking about buying for the interior which is pretty
clean, I've opened it up and looked through it, it's sort of abandoned
with no engine, I figure $50 and towing it away would take it as
it's obviously not moved in 10 years or more.  The Westy parts were
in fairly nice shape and I myself was interested in the front headliner
panel and jump seat which are pretty beat in mine, and was simply going
to keep the rest as spares.
