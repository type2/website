&gt;&gt;&gt; Since this is my first winter with my Vanagon, I would like to know
&gt;&gt;&gt; what to expect as far as traction and the like when it starts to
&gt;&gt;&gt; snow.  I will buy some snow tires, so can I get away with only two
&gt;&gt;&gt; rears, or do I need all four tires to be stable?  I have been told
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the Vanagons are actually quite good in the snow.  Your
&gt;&gt;&gt; opinions?
&gt;&gt;
I've owned 3 Vanagons over the past 10 years and have always had trouble even
on wet grass trying to go up a slight hill (Its nose heavy with 2 adults in
the front seats).
If it snows, I cant get out of my drive which goes uphill.  What I did for
the snow season was to put 5 - 60 pound sacks of sand in the rear - on top of
the engine compartment and use Continental snow tires in the back. This
really helped and I've never had any trouble since.
