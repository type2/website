Subject: Re: late 80's vanagons



&gt;
&gt;anybody ever do this?  i've always been somewhat curious about the airflow
&gt;around the buses (all years) and always wanted to attach those little tufts
&gt;of wool to the outside, like they do in the windtunnels, and go driving
&gt;down the highway ... and have someone with a camcorder film the bus. :)
&gt;
&gt;
	Hey Joel, I've wanted to do the same thing! Little tags stuck
	on all over the van or someone in front with a smoke generator
	and some sort of manifold to deliver smoke lines in order
	to see the streamlines around the van. Heck I've even gone
	as far as to try and locate a plastic model (kit), to place
	in a flume tank, (no luck, the only one I know of was a
	Revell model of the vanagon from &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;! and it
	is unavailable now). 
	Jeez, what a couple of geeks we are!

	On a different subject, what would be the vanagon equivalent
	of a &quot;full Chicago&quot; - compass, running boards and an awning? 
	

	Its Friday and the start of a long weekend here in B.C.

	Alistair
