Hi!

I'm Kathy Myers.

Steve Johnson suggested I subscribe to this list. Thanks, Steve!

I have a newly &quot;resto-customized&quot; '68 midnight pearl purple and 
midnight pearl turquoise bus (ultra shiny -  full blown urathane race 
car paint with 7 coats of clear) and my signifcant other has an emerald 
green '69 squareback.  (very clean body - but - painted with totally 
flat - Tru-Value Hardware forest green - spary cans! :-) )  

Does it go without saying, that we have a difference of opinion when it 
comes to spending big bucks on restorations? :-)

I have previously owned a '65 split window - customized camper - with a 
super 1600 Porsche engine, and a '70 Kombi - with completely customized 
interior. Mark Blanchard, my SO, has previously owned a '67 bug with a 
sun roof, and a '67 square back.

We love our VWs because we can work on them.   (Mark's the mechanic, 
and I'm  the helper.) 

We are TOTALLY into gas heaters and studded snows on all four. (During 
the winter.) And I'm proud to announce, that  ever since I finished the 
bus, I can easily say - we are both into beautiful old buses... just as 
long as they don't cost Mark anything but his time!

Thank you for inviting me to share your group.
