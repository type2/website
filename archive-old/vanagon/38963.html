&gt; there are two ways that i know of:

after spending too much for the halogen replacement bulbs, i have to 
admit that they really don't do much different than the standard 
ones.  on paper, i'm sure they have twice the light output but 
combined with a cheap reflector and lousy back-up lens optics, they 
are marginal.

definately, the best way to go is with a spare fog light.  fleet 
stores sell vibration resistant, waterproof, halogen &quot;tractor&quot; 
lights in fairly attractive housings that run less than $10 and can 
be bought individually.  these tractor lights have a broad, diffuse 
beam pattern for lighting wide areas.  perfect.

and a perfect example of agricultural cross-technology.  just like 
taping cow magnets on your fuel line.....
