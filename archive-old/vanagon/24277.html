&gt; Having done rockers and front floors myself, I can truthfully say it can

Actually, my front floors are solid.  I was referring to the cargo floor 
sections.  Much bigger area..  can I still do this myself?

&gt; &gt; I did some more investigating on the Bus this morning.. it looks like it 
&gt; &gt; would be wise to replace the two floor halves, front crossmembers, and 
&gt; &gt; rocker panels.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is this major work for a welder to do properly?  I know in a Bug it can 
&gt; &gt; be a pain in the ass to replace rockers and floors, but I have never done 
&gt; &gt; this on a Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a place to work on it, I'd suggest doing it yerself.  You can get
&gt; a decent lowe-end MIG welder for about $300, and you'll make that back in 
&gt; what you save on shop costs.  You should also get a grinder and a jigsaw,
&gt; and a good hammer and some good cold chisels.  The jigsaw you'll use to
&gt; get the old stuff off (or use good shears - yeah, add that to the list - 
&gt; thats what I used) the welder to, uh, weld them in, the chisel to cut
&gt; some of the more hard to get spots, like around the frame members, and
&gt; the grinder to finish down your welds.
&gt; 
&gt; My bus has all new rockers, battery tray, front floors, and hinge carrier.
