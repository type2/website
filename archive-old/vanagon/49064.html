&gt;I am looking for a Late Model Vanagon and have seen several Westy
&gt;campers but no Vanagons...  I may be wrong but I don't thing the camper
&gt;has the center seat.  I have 5 children and need the seating.  The
&gt;camper would be nice if I could add the seating.  My camping needs would
&gt;not require the sink and other stuff... But the two beds would be nice.

I would look for a 1990 or 1991 model called a Vanagon MultiVan.  This model
had seating for 7, a fold-up table, a rear seat that fold into a bed, and a
pop-top with a bed above.  The only problem is where to put your luggage
while your sleeping.  I would suggest calling all ads for 1990 or 1990
Vanagon Campers or Vanagon Westfalias, since the owner or dealer might not
correctly describe this model as a MultiVan.
