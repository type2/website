Subject: Re: Paint/Interior Codes (was M-Codes)

&gt;Jim Bryant wants to keep the interest online (although he, Michael
&gt;Heron &amp; I seem to be the only ones interested)!
&gt;
&gt;My intrigue with paint/interior numbers is this:
&gt;
&gt;I have 2 Kombis (65&amp;66) which are Pearl White/Mesh Grey.  Their paint/
&gt;interior numbers correctly say 131383.
&gt;
&gt;I also have 2 Westys (both 66) which are Pearl White/Mesh Gray, and a
&gt;1968 Westy which is Pearl White.  All of their paint interior numbers
&gt;say 523907.
&gt;
&gt;This is why I asked if anyone had a Velvet Green camper, to see if it
&gt;was the same for all Westys.
&gt;
&gt;The L-codes for paint also had corresponding numbers on the VIN plate:

are the L-codes on the vin plate assigned differently on westys's??

ie i ASSUME that 523907 on my 65' westy means that my bus originally was a
(52) pearl white westy w/ (39) mesh grey (is this the same as &quot;salt n'
peppa&quot; fabric??) interior and a (07) ??? . Any thoughts on why Pearl White
is assigned as &quot;13&quot; on a Kombi and &quot;52&quot; on a westy. am i making ANY sense??

hey keep it flowing !!!!!!!

btw if i had salt and pepper seats, would the door panels be made out of
that gray hardboard material or covered in salt and pepper fabric? most
westy's i have seen have they gray hardboard panels but there is a pic of a
westy in a book by walter zeichner that shows a westy w/ salt and pepper
door panels???
