Subject: f/    it's SUPPOSED to sound that way.

&quot;Po-tato    Po-tato   Po-tato.....&quot;

ahhhh, the classic sound of Harley Davidson's V-twin.  music to my 
ears.  Harley is even trying to get a patent on the sound.

It occured to me last night that with a little stretch of the
imagination (and a few beers) that the lumpy idle common to
wasserboxers is not unlike that ol' Harley beat.  So, take heart. 
That irrascable idle you've been trying to smooth out could be
viewed as a 'feature'.  

Just picture you and some of your buddies standing 
around the back end of your van, longneck in one hand-- thumb of your 
other hand hanging on your belt.  Someone gives the throttle a blip 
and y'all grin boyishly, poking each other with your elbows.

So forget about that new set of plug wires you've been putting off... 
you've got a Classic!
