Subject: Re: Cost of Operating Vanagon

&gt;the cost/month seems a bit high to me, if that includes ONLY maintenance
&gt;items. but a few high-ticket items (like several sets of tires, shocks,

Hmmm, high to me, let's see what the used van market is like.

'85 bus, bought '86.5   $11,000Cdn 
161,000km - 57,000km    104,000 Km (65,000mi)
4 summer tires          $   300
4 winters (used)        $   200
Westy guts + insul      $   400
water pump              $   130    
muffler                 $   120
plumbing/J-tubes        $   150
head gasket 1           $   160
windshield              $   350
battery  2              $   180
belts/fluids  est.      $   200
gasoline est 22mpg/$2   $  6000
VW warranty (new FI)    $  2600
                        --------
           total costs  $21,890
           resale cost  $(4,500)
                        --------
           final total  $17,490 or....  $0.37/mile GAK!
  
                This is Cdn $$, x0.72 = $0.28/mi.  gak!

I thought this was the peoples car, for Swiss bankers maybe.  I tend to view 
the cost of gas as a necessary evil, common to all cars.  Factor that I 
can't account for is how much money saved in moving expenses and motelling 
costs.  Note that there is zero non-warranty VW labour in the above, since I 
DIY.  Add the infinite number of labour hours in there........    Time to 
see if I can fit a Westy setup into a Honda Civic :0.   Tim Smith
