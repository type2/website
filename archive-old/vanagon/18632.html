Subject: Dual Carbs (long)

                 Dual Carbs and Winning the Race

The bilateral symmetry of human beings causes us to readily
accept the correctness of two carbs on a Volkswagen engine.  We
'stand on our own two feet' and swear to things we have 'seen
with my own two eyes.'  Conventional Wisdom sez two things are
better than one; even nature thinks so.

When it comes to engines, sound engineering practice calls for
one carburetor (or fuel injector) per cylinder, anything less is
a compromise.  This was achieved on the Volkswagen through the
use of fuel injection, or mounting a pair of Bug Sprays on
special manifolds atop dual-port heads.  (The Holley Bug-Spray
carb, like the Dellorto, is a pair of single-barrel carbs in a
common body.)  But with the 200 cfm Holleys long-gone from the
veedub scene, and a full-trick Dellorto set-up running close to a
thousand bucks, most of us eager for a multi-carb set-up settle
for the plebeian high induced by a pair of Kadrons.  Actually,
it's a pretty poor compromise compared to the glories of one-
carb-per-cylinder, but Kadrons are cheap, look macho and don't
run all that badly, at least, not if we have the Treuhaft
aluminum carb-mounts, dual-port heads and manage to keep that
crappy linkage from falling apart more than once a week.

                       Big Hat, No Cattle

Alas, the two-carbs-are-better-than-one argument is largely
without substance.  Two 40mm carbs will definitely flow more air
than one 34mm carb, but unless you've spent at least as much on
improving the flow of your heads as you have on your carbs, the
potential improvement goes largely unrealized.  With stock heads
on a stock engine you'll see no significant improvement in
performance until you push the revs above 3,500 rpm or
thereabouts.  But Kadrons are cheap, look macho and don't run all
that badly...

So why do many people run Kadrons?  The answer may surprise you. 
A lot of people go to Kadrons because in their haste to bolt on a
few horsepower they do things that make their engine run worse.

                        Louder is Colder

The first thing a kid does to his bug is throw away the stock
muffler and bolt on an extractor.  Extractors are cheap, sound
boss, and everyone uses them so they must be good, right?  Wrong. 
The stock 'muffler' is actually an expansion chamber, any
muffling is accomplished by the glas-packed diffuser cones in the
tailpipes.  Wanna go fast/make noise?  Pull your tail pipes. 
Install a pair of straight pipes.  You'll pick up about the same
top-end gain you'll get from an extractor, and become the
noisiest kid on the block.  But doing that would fly in the face
of Conventional Wisdom; better to stick with an extractor and
avoid reality.  Unfortunately, most extractor exhaust systems
actually degrade the performance of your engine, and for a very
simple reason:  they can cause the intake manifold to ice up.
  
Without sufficient heat the VW manifold ices up very easily,
reducing the internal bore to a tiny hole.  The intake manifold
is heated by exhaust gases routed through the heat riser pipe. 
The typical cheap extractor is shipped with the heat riser ports
undrilled and is installed the same way.  The manifold
immediately experiences icing problems.

Carburetor and manifold icing can occur in any climate and any
temperature, about the only time you're safe is when the humidity
is below 10%, which occurs during temperature extremes.  But
Conventional Wisdom pays little heed to icing problems; after
all, the engine is too hot to touch, how could there be any ice
in there?  (You'll find the answer in any Physics text.)

Various local experts will diagnose the icing problems as 'flat
spots' in the distributor (icing often chokes the engine when
pulling away from a stop sign), a bad carb (you may see some
black smoke), ignition problems (a rough, stumbling idle is
common with manifold icing), bad plugs, and anything else they
can think of.  But ice?  No way, dude!
  
Unwilling to admit that adding an extractor actually makes their
bug run worse, the next step is to slap on a pair of Kadrons. 
After all, they've tried just about everything else.  Wow!  Talk
about performance!  And Conventional Wisdom wins again.

                        What's Happening?

Here's what's been happening in the engine room.  On the stock
muffler the heat riser takes part of the exhaust gasses from #2
cylinder and feeds them through the heat riser pipe DIRECTLY TO
THE TAIL PIPE.  Not the muffler; the little pipe pierces the
muffler canister and continues to the base of the left tail pipe. 
On cheap extractors, even when the heat riser ports are opened
up, the heat riser connection on the left side simply dumps the
gases into the #4 exhaust stack.  Due to the length of the heat
riser pipe, by the time the gases from #2 arrive at the flange of
the #4 cylinder, they are met with the hotter, higher pressure
exhaust gasses from that port.  The result is little if any flow
through the heat riser pipe.  It quickly clogs, reducing flow
still further, clogs some more and finally gets blocked shut,
providing the intake manifold with no heat at all.  Without
manifold heat, icing problems become painfully obvious.

(The first extractor I ever saw was, I think, from EMPI, back in
the late 60's.  It had a heat riser pipe from the #4 flange to
the collector, insuring proper gas flow through the heat riser
tube on the manifold.  The engine ran a center-mounted Weber
progressive on a trick EMPI manifold.  It ate me alive, three for
three.)      

But everyone sez Kadrons are the cure.  Sure enough, the Kadrons
and the extractor seem made for each other.  The engine runs at
least as good as it did when stock, mebbe even better.  (Factoid: 
With their short aluminum manifolds, icing is seldom a problem
with Kadrons.  The manifolds absorb heat directly from the
cylinder heads.)

                       A Whiff of Reality

So why don't we see more dual-carb set-ups running the Baja?  Or
even reaching the finish line before the cut-off time?  (Ummm,
you noticed that, did you?)  Well, it has more to do with reality
than Conventional Wisdom; Conventional Wisdom sez it's always the
fastest car that wins, right?  Wrong.  It's the one that finishes
first.  Period.

So what do they run?  As a rule, the winners drive vehicles that
have the fewest parts; the fewest things to go wrong.  Single
carbs -- usually a dual-throat Del or progressive -- are winners
because the throttle linkage is less prone to fail and a single
carb eliminates the balance problems common with dual-carb
installations.  With a single carb there's only one fuel line to
worry about and your air cleaning problems are reduced.

The truth is, a good dual-throat or progressive carb, installed
on a proper manifold, has no trouble outperforming the typical
pair of Kadrons, and does so for a lot less money.  Progressive
carbs -- those having separate throats for high and low speed --
offer considerable advantages in cost, economy and ease of
maintenance over a pair of Kadrons.  (The best milage I've ever
gotten on a bug -- between 35 and 37 mpg -- was obtained with a
clunky Japanese progressive off a Datsun pickup.  The primary was
about 26mm, the secondary not much larger.  It didn't do anything
for the top end but I sure passed a lot of gas stations.)

Progressives are especially useful on buses, where your interest
is more in the torque curve than max rpm.  Progressives also
allow you to run the late-model distributor instead of an all-or-
nothing centrifugal type.  Several after-market suppliers offer
progressive carb kits for the veedub, most for under $200. 
Before succumbing to Conventional Wisdom it might be wise to
check them out.    

                         Making it Work

So how do you make the heat riser work with an extractor?  The
only real cure is to take the heat riser pipe off a cheap
Brazilian muffler, extend it to the collector of your extractor
(ie, where the four tubes come together).  The collector is a
low-pressure area relative to the exhaust stacks; you'll get good
flow and the cross-over tube won't crud up.  (You can't use the
pipe off a German muffler because the flange is part of the #4
exhaust stack casting.)  But if that sounds like too much work,
the cross-over won't clog up as quickly if you drill out the #2
flange to about 1/2&quot; while keeping the hole in the #4 flange
something smaller -- 5/16&quot; or 3/8&quot;.  (But it's still going to
crud up on you.)

                           Sermonette

I'm a serious racer.  I compete everyday in the Hoover Endurance
Run.  The trick is to see how far I can drive my bug, baja, bus
and Ghia on the least fuel, maintenance and repairs.  I expect to
find the finish line somewhere around the 150,000 mile marker.
It's a tough course, including some of the worst off-pavement
stretches down in Baja, rush hour LA traffic and high-speed
trans-continental runs on the interstate freeway system.  But the
nicest thing is the cash prize; I make a little money every time
I drive, and smile all the way to bank.

No one has ever gone broke by catering to Conventional Wisdom,
even though it has never won a single race.  Unless you happen to
be a politician.  Or a magazine editor.
