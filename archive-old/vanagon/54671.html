&gt;&gt;wiring harness for your airflow meter that costs $150 that will solve your
&gt;&gt;problem, I found a way around this harness that cost me 41 cents. After
&gt;&gt;cleaning all of my grounds, I also replaced the ground on the fuel pump and
&gt;&gt;ran a fresh ground from the ECU. If you are intersested in the airflow
&gt;&gt;meter fix let me know and I will email the info to you. It has to do with
&gt;&gt;stablizing the electrical flow between pin 2 and 4 on the airflow meter
&gt;&gt;connector with a capacitor. This current can become erratic with age.

My question is:  What is the airflow meter and what does it do?  My 84
Vanagon has been sluggish in 1st and 2nd gear, has problems holding an idle
(at least until well warmed up), and is blowing all sorts of blue smoke. 
It pooped out before I could get it to my VW mechanic so it's with someone
who doesnt really know VW's.  He thinks it's the airflow meter 
(yikes...big bucks!).  My regular mechanic thinks it might be the idle
control box.
Also, could the cold weather have an exacerbating effect??
