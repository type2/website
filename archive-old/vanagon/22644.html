Subject: Dead motor = Dead Vanagon?
Date: Sun, 13 Aug 1995 16:08:58 -0500 (CDT)

&gt;	Prices for replacement motor running: 
&gt;		$2K - junk yard (50k miles)
&gt;		$2.3K - VW rubuilt long block

What shameless junk yard would charge $2K for a used motor??

&gt;	The questions are:
&gt;		Rebuild or junk the Vanagon?
&gt;		If I rebuild, what are my odds with a junk yard engine?
&gt;		If junk the Vanagon, what can I get for it ?
&gt;
&gt;	I have neither the time nor the space to play junk yard and sell it 
&gt;off in parts if I junk It.  Any Ideas?

Since you have neither the time, nor the space, I would just have VW
install the rebuilt engine. With tax and labor, you're in for about
$3,000. GEX would have been an alternative if you had a rebuildable core
(worth $600 to them), but you don't, and their waterboxer was $2,529 a year
ago. Either way, this seems like less money than buying another used
vanagon, plus you know what you get.

Or you could buy Bill Kennedy's Porsche-6 engine for $2,000, if you don't
mind going air-cooled and if emissions control will let you.

Just my two centimes... :-)
