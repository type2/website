&gt;           WHAT?!  you made it to 22 with no tickets?  i'm both envious
&gt;           and amazed.  i got my 1st speeding ticket on the 1st day i
&gt;           drove my '55 pontiac to school when i was 16...ouch...abnd
&gt;           promptly lost my license for a while.

Well... I didn't get my license until I was 21.  I've got a few tickets 
when I was 21-22, but I got off a few by fighting them.  But I didn't 
have any convictions when I was looking for insurance.  :)
