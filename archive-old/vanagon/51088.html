Subject: Re: 'drives like a boat'

&gt;When driving at Highway speeds, the van has started steering herself, 
&gt;feels like driving a boat.  You can maintain a lane ok, but it's kind 
&gt;of a wave to the left, then right, then left, then right, the whole 
&gt;way.


Mine was doing that real bad, complete with multiple unintentional lane 
changes, swerving into oncoming traffic, etc.  I'd just replaced nearly 
everything on the front end, including ball joints, tie rods, drag link, 
wheel bearings, etc.  So I ordered a center pin/bushing kit and new 
steering box ($$$).

Sounds like the problem could be one or more of the following:

* worn tie rod ends
* worn ball joints
* worn or loose wheel bearings
* worn steering center pin and/or bushings
* uneven/inadequate tire pressure
* bad front tires
* drunk behind wheel

Turned out that the center pin and steering box were fine, it was the 
G**damned new ball joints were too tight a fit.  All of the the 
supposedly &quot;German&quot; ball joints' rubber had split open, too, after about 
300 miles of DWI style driving.  I'd ordered them so long ago that RMMW 
wouldn't make good on the deal, so I was out more $$$ than I care to 
even think about.

Then I tried the one truly good VW mechanic in town, who replaced the 
ill-fitting ball joints with good German ones from a proven source, and 
now all is well.  It drives like it did when it was new.  I sent the 
center pin/bushing kit and new steering box back to Bus Boys, who'll 
credit my card with 80% of what I paid for them (the faulty diagnosis 
was mine, not theirs).

Hope you have better luck than I did.

Roy

Know the difference between a drunk and an alcoholic?
Alcoholics have to go to those meetings.
