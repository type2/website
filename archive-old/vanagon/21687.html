Subject: FFFF/ My brother became one of them! :(

We have failed as a family.  It seems that my brother has been brainwashed
and accepted into a cult.  :(

I was informed that my brother and his wife bought a 1996 american
minivan[1] on Wednesday.  They were last seen going on a vacation.

[1] Company and model withheld to protect sensitive list readers.  (It has 
a five sided logo on it)
