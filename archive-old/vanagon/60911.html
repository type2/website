Subject: Westy roof drains?

First of all, thanks to all of you that responded to my question on 
Friday about buying an '87 Westy w/ auto tranny. After much soul 
searching, I decided to go for it. I'm very happy so far - a fun vehicle 
to drive. I had a couple of questions that you experienced folks can 
probably clear up for me.

1. How is rain water from the luggage carrier supposed to drain? I see 
five holes that appear to just go to the metal roof of the van. Does the 
water just seep out around the gasket?

2. Where's the drink holder?! Seriously, does anyone have any really good 
or elegant solutions for cup holders while driving? I would hope that 
they addressed this in the Eurovan if they really expect to sell in the US.

3. Someone at the car lot apparently broke the plastic &quot;odds and ends&quot; 
holder that was screwed to the driver's door. Is this piece worth 
replacing, or will it just get broken easily again? Is it $$$?

By the way, the removable fifth seat in my Westy is just a van-type 
captains chair, but very well mounted to the floor. Four rather 
substantial fine-thread wing-bolts (not nuts) are used to hold it in 
place, and it also has a seatbelt installed independently. It takes about 
five minutes to remove or install it. Overall, a handy addition, even 
if the upholstery doesn't match!

Thanks again,
	-Malcolm Williamson
