AHHH!! HE said the N word!

sorry, but i stay as far away from the !now! stupid shambles of Usenet as 
i can. I remember waht it was, and know what it is.  Besides, usenet 
loses alot of stuff, then who says your provider or such is going to 
carry it, and just how many are going to change just for ONE measely 
little VW 'thusiist. Email, despite its antiquated exchange methods, is 
much more reliable....

UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL.

UNTIED?

&gt; I have to add that a newsgroup is still an option.  This would allow the
