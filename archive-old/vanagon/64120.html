Erik:
Sounds like classic vacuum leak symptoms. Check around the four  2&quot;
rubber tubes that connect the head castings to the central air manifold.
I sprayed carb cleaner at the suspect area, since it is NON flamable the
RPMs dropped when it was sucked into the leak.
Drive Safely &amp; Good Luck

&gt; The idle is too high when it's warmed up (not before, it
&gt;tends to be too low then) and when I hook up the tach meter and try to
&gt;adjust it down to 950RPM, it falls down to around 650--700.  I try to
&gt;adjust it up to 950, it flys up to around 1300.  It won't stay at 950.
