On a related matter, and one that may be of interest to those running
standard ignitions - the consensus on rec.autos.tech is that there are
real benefits to running platinum plugs on a standard ignition. This is
not to say that electronic ignitions do not benefit but simply that the
margin of improvement is greater for  standard systems basically in idle,
acceleration and longevity. So if you are thinking of switching to an
electronic ignition, I would (personally speaking) explore ways of
improving the existing system - including platinum plugs, new ignition
wires and HD coil. DC
