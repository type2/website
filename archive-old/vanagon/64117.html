Mark,
You won't get anything out of it `till the alt is charging the battery.
There's a relay under the driver's seat that controls that. Take my advice,
forget the 12 volt, stick to the gas, works much better...

Fuse?

&gt; 
&gt; KampenVolks,
&gt; The Dometic on my new 82 Diesel Westy Chills great on 120AC/have yet to
&gt; try propane, but I get nothing out of the 12V mode. I mean nothing.
&gt; Particulars:
&gt; 1) Batt Good
&gt; 2) 12V mode properly engaged as per manual
&gt; 
&gt; The manual tells me there is supposed to be a 10amp fuse on the front
&gt; control panel of the fridge, but I sure can't find one. I did find the
&gt; fuse behind the driver's seat as per VW Kampenmanual and this fuse
&gt; appears good. 
&gt; Is there another fuse somewhere else or any other ideas. Any and all
&gt; feedback greatly appreciated.
&gt; Regards
