&gt;  A zagnut is a candy bar and I have fond memories of eating them when a
&gt; young whipper snapper in San Fransisco (67-69 time frame).  However if you
&gt; want to know what's in it, I have no idea.  They are yummy as I recall
&gt; tho. I do remember eating them in a friend's dad's bug back then.

Prolly like sausage: you really don't wanna know...
