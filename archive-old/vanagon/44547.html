Subject:  VW seat Material, or repairs 

Volks: The drivers seat on my 76 Type II is developing a tear where you
       slide your back over the seatback edge when you move to the back of
       the van. It is a dark beige, or brown plastic material.
       Any ideas on:
       1. How to repair/where to get repair materials
       2. Where to get new material to make a new seatback/ advice on 
          re-upolstering this seat.
       3. Is it possible to get either new, or used seat back, or seat
          that would match. Ideally I'd like to find a new pre-sewn VW part
          #Blahblahblah that I could use to replace the existing upolstry
          painlessly. Sort of slip off the old, slip on the new.

I also could use the back side of the passenger seat back, as it si missing.

Please E-mail as well, or post in top 30K of digest, as I only get the first 
30K;-)

Thanks
