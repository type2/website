Subject: Re: Lawrence, MA show, Sept. 4 - Woodstock, NY show, Sept. 11

Lawrence, MA show: It was our first time there -
we just did Manassas in May and wanted to try
something different. There was a muscle car show
the day before, so Lawrence Stadium was busy the
whole weekend. Apparently, years ago, the town/
neighborhood used to be a nice area - it has gone
downhill to the point that they hired security
guards, day and night.

They told us that usually 6-12 buses usually camp
overnight on the Sat. nite, before the Vee dub
show on Sunday. Well, there were only 2 of us.
It was a little chilly, both overnight and during
the show. Anthony bought various parts, including
some muffler for some rare year (64?) so I guess
there were enough parts for him to choose from.

Because of the security problem, I stayed at the
bus a great deal of the time and left Anthony to
wander around. So I got a fair amount of crocheting
done (oops, digressed again into *female stuff*).


Woodstock, NY show: It was a first-time show, and
they did a great job! Had *two* days of  VW's, mostly
water on Saturday and air on Sunday. Sat. aft. was
a cruise of about 22 miles. They arranged it well,
with police escort to get out of the lot. Mostly
bugs, few buses, some water-cooled, etc.

Got back to a reception at Callahan's, adjacent to
the show field. Good munchies, hot and cold. Other
than paying for your own drinks, it was *free*!
Very nice - and the amount to get into the shows
was not exorbitant either.

We saw lots of buses at our campground - we arrived
on Friday and left for home (finally) on Sunday nite.
Some people went to both shows. We didn't go to Sat.'s 
show. On Sunday, they gave away a lot of door prizes.
Anthony couldn't find any parts to interest him at
this show, but there was as much a selection as at the
Lawrence show. There are some things that he is very
fussy about, and he waits till he finds the perfect one
before buying.

There was a great 60's atmosphere, including one award
given for best 60's/Woodstock theme! Some tie-dye shirts 
and other *groovy* clothes from that era. Because it
was Woodstock, there seemed to be more Deadhead-types
than at the Lawrence show, but everyone was nice. There
was a 70's bus that had a trailer made up of the back of
another 70's bus, same color (green) - that caught 
everyone's eye, I'm sure.

They were both fun shows!

Lori and Anthony
