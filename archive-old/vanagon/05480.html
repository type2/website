Subject: copper washers??

Hello, 
  This is a great mail group!!
I have a 1980 wesfalia.  I took apart my oil pressure relief valve the other
day, for cleaning/inspection.  I didn't know that copper crush washers were a
one time use thing.  I can't find them anywhere locally (Milwaukee, WI)  can
anyone help??
Thanks.
Pete D.
