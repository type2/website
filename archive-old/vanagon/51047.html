Subject: Re: Turbo Diesel Purchase


&gt; I have been looking for a diesel engine as a spare for my VW truck( or one
&gt; to put into a blown Jetta or Golf for my son to drive to college).  I
&gt; purchased my last VW Diesel engine from a Japanese engine import place here
&gt; in the L.A. area.  I could them recently and yes, they finally had a VW
&gt; Diesel engine available. The price is about $400.00 complete.  When I made
&gt; arrangements to pick it up, the fellow informed me that it was a VW Turbo
&gt; Diesel engine.  (complete with pump and turbo).  Well, I'm not sure about this.
&gt; Could I use this in a non-turbo VW sedan or Rabbit pickup?  Or is there
&gt; someone out there who would be interested in this engine for a Vanagon
&gt; prodject?  The import place usually gives 30 day Warr. on Diesels, but he
&gt; said since this engine is rare, no warranty would be given.
&gt; 
&gt; Your thoughts on this?

Yes! It will work in a Rabbit or pickup, but you will need the 
downpipe from a turbo diesel Rabbit or Jetta, since the exhaust exits 
the turbo at a different angle than the regular diesel. The turbo was 
offered in the rabbits for a year or two around '83, but a downpipe 
from a '80-'84 Jetta Turbo will also work.
$400 is a very good price for a turbo in working order. Any idea of 
mileage? I paid $1300 CDN 2 years ago for mine, which had 88k km on 
it, and included the downpipe and full exhaust. Can you see it 
running first? Or at least a compression check?
The difference in power is enormous - I can now regularly pass many 
cars going up hills around here, often in 5th gear. Mileage has also 
improved - I now average &gt;55mpg CDN, or about 1040 km on 50 litres 
of fuel. Be aware that factory recommends changing oil *twice* as 
often for the turbo compared to all other engines.
If I were closer, and ready for a Vanagon project, I might be 
interested, but I've got my hands full right now.

btw: I've now put 180K on my TD since getting it, with only problem 
being a head gasket oil leak. It was not major, just making a mess of 
my garage with oil.
