Subject: Transmission R&amp;R part 2

    Part 2

    Step 1 of repairing the clutch was to examine the throwout bearing, 
    pressure plate, disc, and flywheel. To my amazement I found all
    the parts in new condition, covered in heavy black dirt. 
    Everything except the clutch disc. The disc was wrecked: high
    R.P.M.'s tore it apart. As for the dirt, the last (jerk) mechanic
    that was into the clutch (german motorwerks, here in Pittsburgh,
    PA) didn't clean anything. So when the disc came apart it thru
    dirt everywhere. Diagnosis was done, cleaning of the bell housing,
    rust proofing, painting was next and the longest/hardest part.
    I ordered the new disc, some stainless steel bolts and nuts for
    the exhaust, and moved to the starter for a quick check. First
    look, I found silicone seal, Rust, undercoating, and blistering 
    paint all over. It has 100,000 mile on it, I took a quick look 
    inside. This revealed a mess: burn't field windings, a hand full
    of worn brush material, rust, etc. OK, Out to a Rebuilder it went.
    $55 for complete rebuild. Not Bad! Cleaned the CV joints, painted the 
    shift rod, Transmission mounts. Closer inspection of the motor
    (a GEX rebuild, as I was looking for a oil leak), I found the
    rear oil sending unit wiring laying on the exhaust and the insulation
    burn't off. (another jerk mechanic created problem). Fixing the
    wire was easy. Getting it away from the exhaust wasn't. Ended up 
    removing the exhaust head pipes. This revailed a crack in the front
    Pipe, and a stripped thread in the head for the rear pipe. Well... 
    The crack can be a matieral problem, then I realized that my other
    Vanagon has a support in center under the motor. I bet that's the 
    reason it cracked. For the Threads that are stripped....Well I just
    cann't believe these mechanics are still in buissness! I welded 
    the exhaust and cleaned the threads out of the stripped hole.
    I lucked out. These holes in the heads are very deep. With a much 
    longer threads than needed. It looks like I can get plenty of 
    thread and install a longer bolt. 
        Next: part 3 - installation -  To night.
