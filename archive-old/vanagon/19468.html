Subject: RE: speedo resto..

You might want to consider rubylith or amberlith from a graphics arts
shop/printer, it's used to mask areas of photographs or printing negatives
while they're being exposed. It should hold its color longer than anything from
a crafts store...

I'm curious about this too, and am assuming you're talking about the 3 colored 
indicators on the bottom of splitty speedos. I have replaced these a couple of 
times with colored acetate (?) from craft stores, but it seems to fade quickly,

and isn't the right opacity (opaque-ness?).

&gt; Rich sez he replaced the indicator color (windows) in his speedometer.
&gt; Rich, are these homemade or actual acquirable parts...?
