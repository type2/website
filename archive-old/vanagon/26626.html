&gt;&gt; &gt;HEY FOLKS:  We have enough list members to pull off a group 
purchase of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;decent Westy and keep it garaged near London/Amsterdam for our use. 
C'mon,
&gt;&gt; &gt;time share a Westy in Europe, say $100/week initial investment, ie. 
$5200
&gt;&gt; &gt;ought to buy a damned nice vehicle, your second+ years cost would 
be towards
&gt;&gt; &gt;maintenance, based on previous years mileage you used and extent of 
repairs
&gt;&gt; &gt;as normally required. $300 for 3 weeks unlimited driving/camping in 
Europe,
&gt;&gt; &gt;and less the next year(s).......
&gt;
&gt;Depending on how final cost, idea sounds good
