Subject: Oil Temp revisted (unfortunately)



	Its been super duper hot in Iowa lately, so I decided to
hickup my oil temp gauge again.  The guage is a sweet VDO unit that
was origninally in a Scirroco, and cost me a whopping $5 with sensor,
wiring, etc.  The sensor is installed in the sump plate via a brazed in
fitting.  

	The red zone starts at about 140 Celcius.....I can remember it
running about 120-130 on the interstate I think (250+F).  How come
the &quot;danger&quot; zone for that other VW car is sooo much higher than what
everyone has been saying is bad for the Type 4 engine (250esque)??

	I have yet to stick a lab thermometer in the dipstick hole
and see if its pretty close to correct.

	Also, I would be interested in talking to someone who
has succesfully gotten the sliding door to work correctly.  I think
my hinge is a bit worn and its causing an assload of problems.
