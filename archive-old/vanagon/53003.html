     Tonya,
     
     Are you back up and running OK?  Haven't heard from you in awhile about the 
     problems you were having.  Did you get them fixed?  If so, what was it?
     
     Pat S.

Mark--

You probably just had air in the system due to the radiator swap which
wasn't bled all the way.  Just keep an eye on that reservoir.  All the
air should be out soon, but you could try to bleed it some to ease any
anxiety.
