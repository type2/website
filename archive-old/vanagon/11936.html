So martha rubin says:
&gt; I, for one, am happy with staying at either place, and will let
&gt; the rest of you decide.  However, I must tell you that I'm a patsy
&gt; for pot-bellied pigs (NOT human ones).
&gt; 

I for one do not have a problem with going to the other site or staying
with the original.  Sounds good about forwarding the money in either
case.  We need to decide soon though so we get everyones head straight
as to where we're goin'.

Ditto on the nice trip report Al.
