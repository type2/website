&gt;&gt;Anyone out there have any experiance with towing small boats or watercraft
&gt;&gt;with your vanagons?  Anything to be cocerned about.  I have a friend who
&gt;&gt;wants to by an 82 Westy. It has a new motor but he is concerned about the
&gt;&gt;lack of power to pull his small boat.

&gt;&gt;          Eric
&gt;Ed Anderson of Adventurewagen (Fort Bragg, CA) used to use his personal
Vanagon conversion to tow a horse trailer w/2 horses to endurance races all
over the West.
