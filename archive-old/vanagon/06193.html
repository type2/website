Subject: 82 Diesel Overheating


  I'm looking at buying an 82 Diesel Westfalia (asking for trouble?).
It has it's problems but it should meet my needs.  The major problem
is that it is overheating.  I was just talking with a mechanic and he
said this is probably the cooling system not being properly bled
or a bad water pump.  Am I really asking for trouble buy buying this?
My brother had similar problems and ended up losing the engine..

  How tough is it to convert over to a gas Rabbit engines?  Does this
entail any major hassles in CA?
