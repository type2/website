Subject:      Re: EV/Vanagon Poptop Raincover(?)

I use a water proved canvas tent. It do not allow
passing wind or water. But inside we get condensed
water and we're getting wet in cold rainy weather.
We tried some isolation inside and this helps as long
as the isolation keeps on place. But that wasn't
easy while sleeping in the top bunker.

Our solution for three people was buying a Caravan
for a four weeks holiday. The Camper continues it's
live for temporary use during summer time and towing
the Caravan.
