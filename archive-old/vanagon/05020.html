&gt; &gt;Anyone know where I can get a replacement?
&gt; &gt;Is it a hassle to install? (I'm a very MINOR mechanic).
&gt; 
&gt; If it's the same pump as was in my '78, you can find a replacement at any
&gt; RV shop. You'll need to remove the pump and take it with you for comparison
&gt; sake because the shop will know nothing about Westys, but more than likely
&gt; they'll have an identical model.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the difficulty factor, for me the biggest issue was that the pump
&gt; was located in this tiny cabinet space that made the simple task of
&gt; unhooking the hose clamps and wiring almost impossible. If you have a
&gt; clever 10 year old at hand, have them do the job while you supervise.

I would not rule out corroded wiring or connections. Check this first
before replacing the pump, by running two leads directly from your
battery.....
Windshield washer pumps are notorious for corroded connections and the
setup for the water pump is similar...you might even find a washer
pump as a substitute. DC
