Subject: RIP

A moment of silence please for my good friend's recently departed 1970 
Bus.  Owned for 13 years, 250K miles.  A victim of the dreaded fuel line 
/ carb juncture failure.  The victim has been cremated.  I lieu of 
flowers, the family is asking for leads on a '68 - '71 Bus with minimal 
rust.  Thankyou. :-(
