My little brothers bug caught on fire on prom night when some of his 
friends sat on the rear seat and shorted the battery with the seat frame.

Actually the battery exploded beneath them.

Nobody, was hurt. They got lucky.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; The answer was lame for what the question was.
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;correct&quot; answer was the fire was started because the kid put in an
&gt; oversize battery then his friends sat on the back seat.
&gt; 
&gt; The real correct answer, as I read the question, is the kid was changing
&gt; his Voltage regulator, 3 srews (1 ground, 2 to hold it on), and changed
&gt; the battery (3 bolts/nut combinations) and forgot to put the plastic
&gt; back over the positive terminal, then they sat on it etc.
&gt; 
&gt; But hey, who needs to be specific; screw, nut, bolt, there all the same
&gt; aren't they?

&gt; &gt;  Hi all: So, what was the answer to the following &quot;puzzler&quot; that was posted
&gt; &gt; earlier?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I know its not Friday, but this would be really stale by then.  Did
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;anyone catch Cartalk this weekend?  Their puzzler was as follows:
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Larry's VW Beetle he had in college caught on fire when he and 3 of his
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;friends piled in the car for a night on the town. The mishap had to do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with a repair he'd done 6 weeks earlier when he loosened 3 screws and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tightened 3 bolts. What was the repair? Why did the car catch fire?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(You can e-mail an answer to them at puzzler_at_cartalk_dot_com if you want)
