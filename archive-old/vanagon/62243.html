&gt; 

Personally, I like the 87's (but then, I have one :)

&gt;     What should I have checked out when I am taking a propective purchase to
&gt; the mechanic (I'm clueless about auto mechanics) ?
&gt; 

Check the coolant system carefully and look for evidence of leaks around
the heads.  Also, if possible, take it for a good long test drive (at
least an hour).  Some common problems don't show themselves until the
vanagon has gotten good and warmed up.

&gt;     What are typical problems that I should look for, and which ones are
&gt; major ?
&gt; 

See above.  Coolant leaks at the heads is a MAJOR cost problem. 
Misbehaving when warmed up is typically a minor cost, it's the detective
work that's irritating and can become costly when you get into
part-switching mode.

&gt;     Will I have to become a VW mechanic if I want to keep it on the road (as
&gt; I've been told more than once) ?
&gt; 

In all likelyhood, yes.  But it's not that bad.  I myself NEVER looked
under a hood in my life until I became totally frustrated with my
limited choices in mechanics.  Most stuff is really easy.  The engine
compartment is fairly roomy and the design pretty straightforward. 
Besides, you'll always have the list to turn to for advice!
