&gt; I am planning to use the &quot;Capacitor Fix&quot; for the Air Flow Sensor problem
&gt; common to our Vanagons. From the archives I found that the fix calls for
&gt; a 22 microfarad 25 volt capacitor of tantalum type. Unfortunately the
&gt; closest capacitor that I was able to find was 22 microfarad 16VDC. I do
&gt; not know if it is tantalum or not. How does one tell?
&gt; I need to know if this capacitor will do the job.

	A Tantalum capacitor looks like two small wires dipped in a 
ugly Blob of plastic.....Radio Shack has what you need for $1.89 each 
part no rsu 11295805.........
