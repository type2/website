&gt;I think someone mentioned this once, but I don't know 
&gt;if anything came of it -- would it be possible to distill
&gt;the text of these manuals and put them on the gopher? Or is
&gt;there so much non-text info that this would not add much to
&gt;the collective knowledge?
&gt;
I think that was me, but it was to summerize the changes as indicated in the
'68-'72 PARTS manual (not Westy manual).  The Westy manuals pretty much just
show you how to fold out the bed, use the icebox, etc.  The parts manual
would show exploded views of this equipment and the difference between years.
This would be nice for those of us that want to use parts from junkyards
but still have the parts our buses were &quot;supposed&quot; to have.  I was envisioning
having sections such as &quot;Curtains&quot;, &quot;Ice Box&quot;, &quot;Poptop&quot;, etc. and then
listing the changes through the years.

&gt;Also, are we talking about the typical Owners' Manuals or special
&gt;ones for the Campmobile?
Yeah, there's a regular Owner's Manual that covers the various configurations
for that year bus (7 seater, 9 seater, etc.) but not the camping stuff.
There's a special Campmobile (Westy, short for Westfalia) supplement that
covers that.
