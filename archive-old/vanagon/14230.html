&gt; I want to install an oil pressure gauge and an oil temp gauge on

&gt; 
&gt; Where do I install these sensors? The pressure gauge doesn't have any
&gt; clearance, and I dont want to install the temp gauge in the 
&gt; same location? 

They sell pressure sensors that mount in the stock location, made by VDO,
that have connections for both the stock idiot light and a gauge.  Mine
is mounted remotely via a rubber hose, kind of like the kind on a
compression testeer.

The temp sender is typically mounted in the small back plate in the rear
passenger side corner under the engine.
