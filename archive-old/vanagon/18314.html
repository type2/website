Subject:       wasserboxer cold start system

well, since Joel isn't here to expound,  i'll try to give it a feeble try.

The wasserboxer cold start system enriches the mixture by lengthening 
the &quot;on&quot; time of the 4 normal injectors; there is no 'cold start' 
injector as on many other FI systems.  The mixture enrichment is 
controlled by our ol' friend, the temp sensor, and the ECU.

Cold fast(er) idle speed on the '83-'85 is controlled by an
electromechanical auxiliary air valve buried under the manifold on 
the right side of the engine.  When cold, this valve lets additional 
air (bypassing the throttle plate) in the engine, similar to cracking 
open the throttle plate.  As the engine warms up, this valve closes 
and thereby reduces idle speed.  These valves have a tendency to gunk 
up and cause probs.   Warm idle speed regulation is then 
done by varying the ignition timing (i think) thru that balck box on 
the left side of the engine.

On the '86 and on, the increased idle speed is accomplished by that 
little hummer, literally cause it does vibrate, the idle stabilizer.  
It accomplishes idle speed regulation by varying the amount of air 
bypassing the throttle plate.  the auxiliary air valve is eliminated.

Wacky idle problems often arise from out-of-whack basic idle 
settings, as has been clearly detailed in past posts.  Also, false 
air leaks can cause problems.  check for these by removing the 
airflow meter, stuff a tennis ball in the opening of the intake boot, 
clamp off the breather, and pressurize the system with a few psi air. 
 Spray soap-water on the engine and watch for the bubbles.
