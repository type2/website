Subject: Re: used parts

&gt;&gt;Does anyone have a good index for fair prices on used parts?
&gt;&gt;We are getting several used items and want to know if these are
&gt;&gt;reasonable prices:
&gt;&gt;speedo/odo - 50
&gt;&gt;fuel guage - 20
&gt;&gt;sliding door lock mechanism - 50
&gt;&gt;driver's side window regulator - 40
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any idea if these are good prices or not?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What kind of Type II are they for?

Sorry. '81 Vanagon.  Other people have indicated that they sound ok, but
not a real bargin.  I guess I can live with that.
