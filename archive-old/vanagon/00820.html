Subject: help GM alternator in a 74 1800?

I haven't had that problem, but various others on my '74 van with 1800 
dual carbs. I've lost one starter due to heat, and all my gas lines were 
ROTTED! Check them for sure...I almost lost the van in Manning Park {Big 
Mountains!} due to no gas pressure.

Let me know if you have any other idiosycricies {sic} with your van - we 
can trade ideas!
