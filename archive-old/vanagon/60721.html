Subject: Syncro left/right axle swap?

Listees,

I recall reading on the list about swapping the left and right front
axles on a syncro but I can't find the reference in the archives. Anyone
know where to find it?

As I recall the purpose of the swap is to prolong the CV life span by
applying torque to the CV in the opposite direction. I got two pencils
(left and right axles)  and drew the applied torque arrows on the
pencils' ends. I then interchanged left for right and as expected the
arrows were pointing in the opposite directions to the applied torques. 

My mechanic tells me that the front axle on the syncro has different
outboard CV joints than inboard. Does this mean that when swapping I
must also rotate left for right outer CV joint (i.e.: keep the outer CV
joints outboard and the inner CV joints inboard)?

When swapping the rear axles does it matter if outer CV's are moved to
the inboard or must they too be rotated outer for outer?
