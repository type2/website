&gt;leave us not forget: the &quot;Vanagon&quot; body style is STILL being made in South

&gt;would it be for them to produce a left-hand-drive version for the u.s.??
&gt;with a wabbit engine?? surely not as much trouble as it was for the mexican
&gt;plant to completely re-engineer the bread-loaf for a water-cooled engine.

I hear that in '97 the Puebla, Mexico plant is going to make breadloaf shaped
vans with the Eurovan's front drive and 5 cyl motor.  : )
