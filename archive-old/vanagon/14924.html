&gt;2. When I go to start up the Bus I get a whirring sound from the engine
&gt;compartment on the second notch of ignition (with the two red lights).
&gt;Is this simply my fan being loud? or does it switch on that early in the
&gt;ignition process?  I can't seem to find any help on this from Muir's book.
&gt;

to me it sounds like an electronic fuel pump getting itself up to snuff. do
you have one of these? Just MHO
