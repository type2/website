Subject: Re: Monza (sp?) muffler

&gt;&gt;Get it coated with a ceramic material at a place like Jet-Hot coatings.  It
&gt;&gt;is rather expensive, but you will end up with a muffler that will not rust,
&gt;&gt;and very resistant to heat (to 2000 F.).  It will make your muffler the
&gt;&gt;last one you'd buy for a long time.
&gt;
&gt;But what about rust from the inside?
&gt;

I called Jet-Hot coatings, and they told me that they derust and repair any
small holes in your &quot;piece,&quot; and ceramic coat it inside and out.  It is a
baked-on metallic-ceramic coating that is very resistant to corrosion,
heat, and vibration.
