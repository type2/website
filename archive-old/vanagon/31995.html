Subject: Carat Question

     I've been kinda on the lookout for a vanagon for a neighbor
     who's family is growing beyond Volvowagondom.

     On the road yesterday, I saw a very late Vanagon in Carat
     trim. The interior layout was unusual; club seating.
     Two rear facing seats backed up behind the driver and shotgun
     seats. The usual three person bench in back. If I'm not
     mistaken there was a table set up between the two rows of
     rear seats. Seems great for a family with kids, they can all
     color or whatever on the table in backlike our son does in
     the Westie, but it still seats seven.

     My neighbor likes the idea. Is this a standard configuration
     on the Carat? If not, what is the configuration called? What do we
     search the ads for?

     Can you get a carat with a stick ;-)?


     Thanks in advance:

     Tom F.
