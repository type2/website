Subject: 1997 Car Show Calendar

Hello all,
I would like to create a web page(s) containing a calendar of events
Car Shows etc. relating to the VW hobby. If anyone has any information
on events please send the to me with &quot;1997 events&quot; in the subject 
and I will attempt to maintain an up-to-date listing.
Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.


Thanks,
