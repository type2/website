Subject:      Re: EV Tires; Warranties

For those who asked, I picked up alot of tire assessments from a survey
done that polled VW owners on their experience with tires. The internet
address is: http://198.133.164.201/vw/faq/tire-survey

Scott Beckstead confused kilometers with miles in Leon Joshua's posting.
40K Kilometers is 24,000 miles. Also I'd assumed Leon has an EV and it's
front-wheel drive. So the front tires would wear out more quickly Scott.

Nokia Tires are available in the Northeast through University Wholesalers
in Burlington VT. They can give you the names of dealers in your area,
if there are any. The North American distribution center for Nokians is
near Toronto: 800-565-2525. Nokia also makes cellular phones.
University Wholesalers: 800-852-5222. Greer Enterprises handles Midwest
distribution: 414-741-0996.

&quot;Reinforced&quot; tires are ones that have at least 4 plies on the tread. Most
tires have 2 plies on the sidewall and passenger tires usually have 2 plies
on the tread. It therefore looks like the Nokian NRW M+S would be ok for
the EV. But the load rating for each tire is also important. The Contis
have a 1609 pound rating; the Nokians is 1477 pounds. The van weighs about
4200 lbs empty; with a full complement of 7 adults we're looking at maybe
5600 lbs. 4 Nokians would handle 5908 lbs. Close. I'm still debating it.
Would appreciate any words of wisdom from experienced van owners on this.

Extended warranties: I have one from GE Capitol and they've been fine so far.
No independent adjuster had to examine the van; they just took the word
of my VW mechanic. I would recommend them, at least tentatively: I haven't
yet had to present them with a really big bill; VW paid for 3/4 of the $600+
bill when the A/C blew because of a defective fan relay, six weeks after my
2-year warranty ran out. GE paid the rest. If you are considering such a
warranty, reading the fineprint is a good idea.
