Subject: Re: 92 Eurovan transmissions

&gt; Anywho, I too, have little excitement to report on 
&gt; the EV transmission front; and this after a couple
&gt; years' worth of occaisional spastic clutch-gas-
&gt; brake footwork by a couple of owner/drivers.

I've got (didn't really want) automatic and its been just fine.  Clunky 
so I did notice the comment on that but no problems.

&gt; I finally had to replace my original windshield wiper
&gt; inserts last week...does that count?   ;-)

Darned lousy rotten VW doesn't care about their customers....

Actually mine had been dry rotted before I got the EV so they were 
replaced gratis by the dealer.

Have had niggly problems nothing worth complaining about.
