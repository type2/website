Subject: 90 GL: strange coolant idiot light 

Hi all,
strange stuff on our '90 GL with 45k miles on it: my wife took the van
over the weekend to go out of town and 90 minutes into the trip the
coolant light came on.  She pulled over, let the engine cool down and
eventually limped to her destination.  I told her to look at the
radiator fuse (not blown) and the coolant refill tank (very low).  For
the return leg she filled the refill tank with distilled h2o (I forget
how much, but less than a gallon, I think) and made her way back home.
Again, 90 minutes into the trip the light came on, except this time the
refill and expansion tanks are still topped up.  The fan works (checked
by runing a/c), although she says it didn't come on while the idiot
light was doing its crazy dance.

I haven't noticed coolant loss recently, in fact when I changed the oil
about a month ago the refill tank seemed filled.

Strange though, that it would take so long for the light to come on, no,
particularly with coolant in the tank(s)?

Any ideas?  I haven't checked the hoses yet, but there are no leaks
under the van.  Wonky thermostat?  Or have I got an idiot thermoswitch,
perhaps coupled with with an idiot temperature sender, or just an idiot
idiot light?

Many thanks for any and all insight...
Joachim
