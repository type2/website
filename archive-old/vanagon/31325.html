Subject: EV's are amazing.

I was plodding around in the EV/MV the other day looking for a way to store 7
pairs of ski's on an upcoming voyage.  Much to my surprise the facia that
covers the area underneath the rear seat is held in place with clips allowing
easy removal without breakage.

Now I can stuff the ski's in from the rear and they will stick out into the
rear passenger compartment.  

Now I just need to find somewhere for my Canoe and Mt. Bikes.

Cheers and Beers,
