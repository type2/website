Subject: General Questions from a Newbie


I just bought a 73 Camper with a 77 fuel injected 2 liter engin.  I have 
owned VW buses before (71', 66') and bugs (67', 73'which I still own) but 
never with this 
pancake engin.  It seems to me to be very little difference in the amount 
of power I have but the parts are much more expensive and confusing.  
Unforunatly, I am not the technical type and probably shouldn't own air 
cooled VW's but its sort of an obsession.

The 73' has about 600 miles on a rebuilt and I plan to drive it to 
Indianapolis and then on to Taos, New Mexico (total Miles 2000).  I need 
to get everything readjusted (General tune up, valve adjustment, etc.) it 
hasn't been touched since it was rebuilt.  How many miles should a 
rebuilt have on it before it is readjusted?
I don't think I will be able to do it enroute.

Also, the guy I bought it from said that it was ok to run unleaded gas 
in it and to use strait 40 weight oil.  In my previous VW's I always 
ran 10w 30 in the summer.  (I'm sure this has been discussed to death)

If there are any other things I should know about these pan cake engins 
that are different from the good old stand up 1300s it would be helpful.     

thanks,
	Dave Woodward
