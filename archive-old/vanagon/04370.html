Scott, and everyone else.  If you post something in error to the list, please
don't also post an apology.  Most of that stuff the list catches and it never
gets distributed.  Your post (HELP) for example, Scott, never got
distributed, but your apology did.  If you make an error, just forget it. 


Thanks.
