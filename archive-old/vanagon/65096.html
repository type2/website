Subject:      Low Power at Cold Start

My 91 Westy seems to have no power when cold.  I let it run for about 30
seconds to get the oil flowing, then try to go.  It seems that when I
let out the clutch it just wants to die instead of go.  I have to really
give it gas, and then after a minute or two, it goes fine.  Anyone have
a fix?
