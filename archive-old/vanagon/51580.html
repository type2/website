&gt;John (all information likely bogus)

I don't see much &quot;bogus&quot; about your information.  To my recollection your
comments are correct regarding Vanagons.  I don't know much about Splitties,
Bays &amp; Eurovans, so I won't comment there.  The Vanagon Multivan was a model
in 1990 &amp; 1991 and my Camper standards, it wasn't much of a camper because it
didn't contain any camping accessories, but did have the Westfalia pop-top.
 VW did not call it a Camper model.  I wouldn't call it a &quot;standard&quot; or
&quot;base&quot; model though, because it was equipped very luxuriously.  Power
mirrors-windows-door locks, alloy wheels, A/C &amp; more.  The only options were
metallic paint (at no charge I believe), a stereo, and automatic
transmission.  It was much like the Vanagon Carat with a pop-top added.
