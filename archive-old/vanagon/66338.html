To Harry
Can't you install some washers over the rear springs on your syncro?
That's how I leveled my '90 westy 2 wd. It was sagging on the left from
the extra weight of the camping furniture. I was only able to do this on
the rear.
I tried those rubber wedges they sell in auto stores. They really messed up

my ride. Had to fabricate my own washer from solid 1/2&quot; vinyl board.
I would not put more than 1/2&quot; over the spring. This only works on the
back.

&gt;
&gt; Hi Everyone.  Well, during the summer I mentioned to the list that
&gt; the rear springs of our '90 Syncro Westy have apparently sagged.  The
&gt; rear wheels are 3/4 of a degree out of camber (tops of wheels leaning
&gt; in), and the alignment adjuster is at its max.  Many of you suggested
&gt; not to worry about it, as it's so slight, etc. Well, I've also
&gt; noticed the van is sitting noticably lower to the ground as well.
&gt; The front shocks seem a bit &quot;soft&quot; as well.
&gt;
&gt; So, I've done some research on this topic and I'd like to share this
&gt; with the list.
&gt;
&gt; First of all, NOBODY makes replacement springs for this van other
&gt; than VW.  I've been in contact with 3 spring shops, and they can't
&gt; get a replacement.  I've also dealt with a major flaps (Lordco), and
&gt; they can't help either.  Same for the front shocks.  Again, VW is the
&gt; sole supplier of these parts.
&gt;
&gt; Once coil springs sag, they are rendered useless.  If they have a
&gt; model, they can custom build springs for about $150 CDN each.  BUT,
&gt; there are no guarantees, etc.  They will measuring wire diameter to
&gt; figure out the spring rate, and they will only have a collapsed
&gt; length, and will have to guess as to it's full height, etc.  Since
&gt; the only model I know of is on my van, this isn't good.  The turn
&gt; around is about 4 to 6 weeks to get these made locally.
&gt;
&gt; So, here's the poop... Now, sit down, take a deep breath.... these
&gt; are NOT typo's
&gt;
&gt; front spring   251 411 105F 952  $456 CDN EACH
&gt; rear spring    251 511 105E 952 $506 CDN EACH
&gt;
&gt; front shocks  251 413 031C          $354 CDN EACH
&gt; rear shocks   251 513 031D          $242 CDN EACH
&gt;
&gt; TOTAL :  $3116.00 CDN
&gt;
&gt; Now, this is serious money.   Also, my dealer has checked his
&gt; computer tracking system, and in the past 18 months since they've had
&gt; this computer system have NEVER sold springs or shocks for a Syncro.
&gt; Of course it's my luck that it's my van that has this problem.  Gee,
&gt; I don't even go off road!
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to know why the springs have sagged.  Any ideas?  The spring
&gt; shops couldn't tell me the exact reason.  My van sits 5 months of the
&gt; year (unladen), and I wonder if this static load could have caused
&gt; this.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, there are other ways to get VW parts (ie. Kyle, etc), but
&gt; it's pretty scarey with these prices.
&gt;
&gt; Am I the only one, or have other Syncro owners had spring/shock
&gt; problems?  Are there any gas shock replacments for this van?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any input.
&gt; Harry.
