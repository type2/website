Subject: Gas Tank Rebuild

Returned the recently acquired 82 Westy for it's 500 km. valve adjustment.
Among other items on the list to be checked out was a gas smell.

We knew it was leaking from somewhere, but not sure where.  Recent postings
pointed to deteriorating hoses, valves, and connections, but the mechanic
called yesterday and says he determined it was none of the above, but in
fact the tank itself was leaking at the seam.

Since this was all part of his comprehensive 30 day warranty, the fix is at
his expense.  He says he didn't want to spend the Cdn$400 for a new tank,
so he sent it to the &quot;tank rebuilder&quot;.  Supposedly the tank rebuild comes
with a 5 yr. warranty.

Any one have any comments/experience on &quot;rebuilding&quot; of leaky tanks?
