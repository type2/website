yup. in my 86 bus, i made the mistake of putting some bad-rain-tread tires
(that were also rather wide) on ... and driving along in heavy rain (which
we tend to get don' heah in Amabala) was a nightmare! especially on hills
where the water runoff didn't (run off, that is). i got rid of those tires
pretty quick.

oddly enough, years later, i had a 91 bus with the same width tires, but the
reinforced Michelin tires, and had no trouble at all with hydroplaning.
the tread on the tires makes all the difference in the world.
