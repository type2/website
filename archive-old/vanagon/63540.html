Subject: Oh was his face red!

Was: Problems, Problems.

Went out this morning (took the day off) and was ready to swap the ECU and the
coil (I had spares of both).  Took the ECU out and put the other one in.
Went to take the coil out and found the ground strap connected to the coil
wound around behind the ECU and NOT connected to the block. Decided not to
swap the coil. Put the ground strap where it belonged and took 'er for a
drive.  No stumble in the 3 miles or so I drove it.  (The last two days it's
done it as soon as you took off.).  

&lt;sigh&gt; 
I hope that's it and I think it is!

The list will be on autopilot for a bit as I'll be on the road until Monday
night.  If I can check in I will.  When I get back (using a rental car) we'll
do some camping and see how she goes.

&gt; fastened down properly, experienced the same problem.
