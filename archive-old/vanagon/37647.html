Subject: EV sales figures

Just saw sales figures for EV Campers in some Car &amp; Driver type magazine at
the grocery store -
1994 sales - 46xx
1995 sales - 16xx

Compared to Dodge Caravan at 262,000 vehicles.

It's a good thing they have been selling well in Europe - parts will be
available, just not at junkyards! At least they won't be albatrosses around
our necks, we'll see if they become collectors items over here.
