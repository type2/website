I actually don't think its a BRAND new engine. Its one of those well, 
its NEW to this vehicle jobs I think some of you call a rebuild. :-)

the engine number starts out AF something or other. Don't have it here 
on my desk though.

What do you think a running 1600 with new Carb. and Dist. is worth to 
someone? And how much $$$ should I start saving to get this new (our 
should I say NEW this vehicle) engine.

Thanks, I really appreciate it.

The Safety standards are another reason.
