You got my cracks backwards.  I drive the weenie auto.  Wish I had the 
REAL MAN manual...  The old enough meant 93 when it was available. vs. 
'95 when its not...  Well in the US anyway.  We have a '93 bought new in 
'94.  Got what they had.

&gt; 1.  Manual 5 speed
&gt; 2.  Extensive use of cruise control
&gt; 3.  Speed limited to 105 kph (65 mph)
&gt; 4.  Tires inflated to recommendations
&gt; (G64s at 51, 56 psi)
&gt; 5.  Careful engine breakin
&gt; 6.  Minimal/rare use of A/C

Bet you got the list right.  I notice better mileage when I follow 3,4 
and 6.  Don't have cruise so can't test 1 or 2.  Think I did okay on 5...
