Subject:      BUY THIS '85 GL, $1400 in WV

Oh come on people, somebody must need this thing, someone closer than
the people who have been interested in it.  I reiterate, this is a
good running van, no known mechanical problems, excellent
compression, recent oil analysis shows good, if I touched up the
average mid-atlantic seam rust, a dealer would be easily asking $3k
for it.  It is blue metallic, has the weekender interior, no A/C.
Put another 1000 on it this weekend so 95k miles.  Heads new around
65k, along with P/S rack (all new factory stuff), new exhaust, front
to rear steel heater pipes, P/S,  pipes, brakes at about 85k.  All reciepts back
to second owner 60k miles.  This is a perfectly functional daily
driver, cosmetics as you would expect for a 12 year old van.  At this
price it is an EXCEPTIONAL parts van if you are trying say to keep an
early wasserboxer camper running or a greater winter beater or work
van.  I am selling it basically cause I have too many cars, and the
van holds specifically bad memories for me (reason enough if you have
ever been in love).  Somebody buy this before I trade it for a '79
Bus I've been eyeing as that isn't going to help my vehicle situation.
It is a great deal for someone.  It will need tires for winter but the ones
on it will get you home.  This van has the most solid leak free
cooling system you could imagine.  It however does not have it's rear
heater and the rear bumper is a rather custom PO made wood assembly.
