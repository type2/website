Subject: '56 kombi progress: paint


 	&quot;What?&quot; you say? Paint?

	Yes my friends, I couldn't hold off any longer.  I had to paint
something, so I painted the area behind the front seats.  And then I had paint left over, so I painted the front door sills and part of the door jamb.
I still had some left so I painted the back of the headlights and the 
piece that holds the cover for the front end.  I still had some so I
painted the engine compartment!  Oye this stuff goes a long way!  I did all
that with 1/2 quart of mixed paint, which was about 1/2 pint or so of
paint and the rest reactive reducer.

	I looks pretty good - a little lighter than I originally anticipated,
which makes it look a lot like the factory dove blue - its just a bit
different.
