Subject: Nice splittie in new VW ad [uk]


A new VW ad has just come out over here under the heading

`Remember those mind-expanding trips of the Sixties? They're back.'

On the left of the ad is a nice 66 ish splittie, completely flowered 
up, including bumpers, wheels, hub caps and roof. Behind the last
window is the legend 'Katmandu or Bust'. Two short roof racks
joined by a surf board and assorted junk. The bus also sports
safari windows.

On the right is the point of the ad, not a T4, but a people
carrier type of car - the VW Sharan (!). Neat, small and
lots of bits n pieces like ABS, VR6 and power steering. Looks like 
everything else on the road. 

Bland and probably very competent (sp).

cheers
