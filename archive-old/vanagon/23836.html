Jeff,
Just in case no one has replied to you yet, it sounds like you have the 
dreaded VW ignition wiring/solenoid problem.  Pick up a generic Ford 
solenoid (~$5 _at_ Checker) and use it as a relay for the solenoid.  If 
you're not sure how to wire it (or anyone else wants the info), mail me 
direct.

&gt; Hi-
&gt; 	I just returned from a *very* fun month-long, 8,400 mile trip 
&gt; around the western 1/2 of the U.S.  I'd like to post some high (and Low) 
&gt; lights of the journey soon, but first- my immediate concern.
&gt; 	About 3 weeks into the trip I began to experience troubles 
&gt; starting the bus (78 Westfalia).  Usually after running awhile.  I'd turn 
&gt; the key and hear nothing.  The battery is good, so I quickly discounted 
&gt; that possibility.  The key would turn, the dummy lights would dim a bit, 
&gt; but no -vroooom-.  Between my wife and myself, compression starting was a 
&gt; quick fix (and the only fix, since Muir and others warn against jumping a 
&gt; fuel-injected vw).
&gt; 	We just parked on hills when possible.  (The bus started fine 
&gt; when we remembered to do this... if we forgot, Kermit wouldn't go- when 
&gt; we did, he fired right up :-/   )
&gt; 	Cold starts were fine all week- problem was present when engine 
&gt; was hot.
&gt; 	Until this morning.  I went out to fire it up, and nada!  I've 
&gt; done the wire jiggles, cleaned connections, etc.
&gt; 	Any ideas?  All are welcome!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Jeff, who along with wife and Kermit met the kindest people on 
&gt; the road!
