Subject: Re: door hinge r&amp;r suggestion

Rusty, this is great.  I wish the PO had done the same to my bus.
I would use a more elaborate bend in the end of the wire than
a simple 90 deg angle so if the wire twists around the plate
won't fall.  Also, undo the top screw of each hinge first--the
little plates can flail around in there, so secure it with wire
and then take the bottom ones off.  Coat hanger wire might be
too thick.  In fact, any wire might be too thick.  There isn't
much room between the outer door pillar skin (the hinge goes behind
this) and the hinge.  You might be able to back the doors out
enough that you can snag the inner plate hole with another wire.

My bus had some small holes (look above the very top of the door
pillar) that I dropped a string down (with a tiny weight on the end).
I then caught this with a wire hook through the screw hole of the
plate, dropped another, tied them together so that I ended up 
with a loop through the hole.
This way I could manipulate the plate around by pulling the double
strings from the top and easing it around with a wire hook from
side.
Since you are trying to take the doors off, you could run the string
down, pull it through the open screw hole, undo the lower screw,
pull the door slowly out, hook the thread back through the hinge hole,
and snag the bottom hole with a screw or some wire to hold it. 
Make sure the string can't get away and get sucked into
oblivion down the door pillar :(

I ended up with screwing into a hole with string in it, then
pulling as much of the string off as I could, but some of it
is still in there.

Wow, good luck dude.  I can't believe the bus was supposed to 
be like this, all the other hinge plates are secure somehow.  I
bet there is a tiny bracket or support that just rusts away.  Argh.

&gt; Ray Hale door hinge dilema ,any suggestions?   ray

&gt; Rusty suggests:
&gt; 
&gt; How about:
&gt; a) take two pieces of wire coat hangar/mechanics/bailing wire (per hinge). 
&gt; b) Bend a 90 degree angle maybe 1/2 inch from end of each wire. 
&gt;    Use one wire as above for each hinge hole.
&gt; c) locate secondary helpful set of hands.
&gt; d) remove one screw from each top and bottom. 
&gt; e) insert wire into the single empty hole of each hinge. 
&gt; f) carefully repeat for remaining hinge screws.
&gt; g) carefully slide door w/hinges along the length of wire until door is off.
&gt; h) remove wire from bottom hole of one hinge and insert door hinge screw.
&gt; i) tighten screw.
&gt; j) repeat for top hole for each hinge.
&gt; 
&gt; Reverse process for installation of new door. I'm thinking that the wires
&gt; would be used to hold the plate some what in place as the replacement
&gt; door/hinge is slid down the length of the same wire(s)
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know if this works. I ran into a similar situation during an engine
&gt; decklid r&amp;r. Thankfully, the plate was laying on a (supported by the)
&gt; horizontal surface.
