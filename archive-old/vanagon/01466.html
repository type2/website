Hi all,
Being new to the list I am sure this is an old subject, but the recent 
postings about sagging rear suspensions brings me to raise the question: 
 What do you folks on the net recommend for shock absorbers?  The Bus in 
question is a '70 that is driven 90%
on the highway.  I would like opinions on quality of ride vs. price, etc. on 
OEM, KYB,
Boge HD, Bilstein, Monroe, etc. I ran Bilsteins on a '68 Bug before but 
would like to know of other folks experiences.  Thanks in advance.

P.S.  If there is a FAQ out there on the subject, please give directions.
