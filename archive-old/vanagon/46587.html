 Re Ebersbacher Heater repair, parts:
Yo, Ron- that's  Automotive Heater Technologies, Ark Mirvis, 31 Byram Bay
Rd, Hopatcong, NJ 201-398-6363.  I see him prowling for old heaters at VW
meets.  Knows his stuff- supposedly only Ebersbacher trained (in Germany;
you should hear his accent) technician in US; also deals in Stewart-Warner
heaters.       Mike Benthin..
