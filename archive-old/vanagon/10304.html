Subject: Re: Front Floor Mats--Info Roundup

Derek Sez:

&gt;I called up Lloyd Design Group and as suggested in this group, they won't
&gt;sell to the public. The person who originallly posted a notice to us about
&gt;the Lloyd mats suggested in his post (I cannot remember who told us about
&gt;Lloyd) that the Lloyd mats were the original factory authorized mat. Anyway,
&gt;Lloyd referred me to a place where I could mail order the mat for $69.95 from
&gt;California Car Cover (818-998-2100). The problem with the Lloyd mat is that
&gt;it doesn't have the nice little VW logo in a circle on it. The original mats
&gt;I bought at a dealer once had this VW logo

Wuz me that posted about Lloyd.

The reason I said they were the &quot;dealership&quot; mats was that when I asked them for 
a listing of their retailers in the Seattle area, they gave me the names of all 
the local VW dealerships, as well as several VW specialty shops. It never 
occured to me to ask if the mats carried the VW logo.

It wouldn't suprise me - now that I think about it - if dealer part shops are 
free to buy these &quot;accesory items&quot; from whomever they choose
