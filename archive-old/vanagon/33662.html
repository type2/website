&gt; I got the rear hub/axle nuts undone, but the hubs won't come
&gt; off because the brake adjusters are seized up, I can't
&gt; slacken the brakes off enough...

I have been following the digression from this problem to
the use of WD-40 for pyrotechnics, but I am having trouble
with the initially stated problem.  Unless the shoes were
*adjusted* tight against the drums, the adjusting stars
would only be a possible *solution* to the problem.  It
seems to me that the real problem is that the shoes are
corroded to the drums/hubs.  Even if the star adjusters can
back off a little, the stuck shoes will remain stuck until
they are broken free.

I assume you want to keep the existing backing plates so I
won't suggest bending them back to access the shoes.
Instead, I suggest a hard WHACK to the backing plate with a
mallet to free up the shoes...and then send the bus to
his/her room without dinner.  Hey, sometimes you just have
to be a tough parent.

Did I miss something here?  Maybe I was blinded by the WD-40
fire-writing in the snow.
