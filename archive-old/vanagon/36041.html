Dennis,

Would it be enough to replace the thin (originally) green and black o-rings
on the outside of each end of the cylinder sleeve to reduce the seepage?  Or,
would it really depend on the condition of wear between the end of the
cylinder and the head?  And, could this be fixed with machine work and
indexing rings in the head?

 &gt;&gt;

The rings keep the coolant from reaching the very top of the head, wher it
meets the cylinder.  It will not ven attempt to hold back the combudtion
gases.  If they seep past the top metal gasket, the ring will fail instantly.
 When assembling, check top of cylinders in place with staigth edge to make
sure they are paralele and level.  Maching the heads is expensive if done
rith.  Welding is often needed to repair this area.  After bolting head on,
test with air pressuer to ensure no leaks.  Any leakage past seals must be
corrected.  Should ba very little leakage past valaves. if they leak, they
will burn.  They wil also cause HC failure at inspection time. Some lealage
past rings is normal.  Should use leakdown tester to make sure that leakage
is in range.
Dennis.
