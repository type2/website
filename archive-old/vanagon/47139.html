Subject: Re: transmission leaking. WHAT TO DO??

&gt;Vanagon, is this a big problem??  Is it possible to add a sealant??  Should
&gt;I plan on not taking the van on a long vacation this summer??  Thanks for
&gt;the help and if you need more info. please feel free to email me directly
&gt;with questions or answers.  I will be away however from July 24-30.

transmissions don't give you any warning when they run out of oil, they just 
get real hot, then sieze.  Maybe the drain plug is loose, if the puddle in 
at the centre of the vehicle, maybe an axle seal or shift rod seal if at the 
side of the trans.  Get a fix on its location, then repost.  If you do 
gamble on the trip make sure you know how fast it's leaking and fill it 
before you leave.  This kind of job would be a major pain on a roadtrip.  Tim
