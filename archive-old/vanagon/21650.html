Subject: taking a break...

Whew its hot.  Just about have my transaxle out.   Two more 27mm nuts and
its on the ground.  Didn't have any change for the drink machine but I
found a WARM Sharp's (non-alcoholic Millers-Ugh!) in my lab.  Who brought
this crap in anyways.  Well, I'll put one in the fridge so's it at least
cold for the 2nd break.......
Talk with ya later
