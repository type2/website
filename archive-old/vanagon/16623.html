Hey all:

I've got a dillema that I am hoping you can all help me solve.  Here's the deal.
I, and I hope, most of you, believe that all microbi should be public domain.
Microbi are a symbol of love, harmony, and peace with fellow man.

Therefore, it seems to me a hideous crime to lock a microbus.  At the same time,
however, I do have tools which I keep in her which I consider to be only mine.
I need them while I'm driving for when she breaks down, of course; and I don't
want to have to carry my tools in and out every time I drive her.  Yet I'm 
afraid that, where I live, my tools will be taken if I leave her unlocked.

Does anyone have any valuable insights?

goah
