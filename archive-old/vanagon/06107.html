Subject: Re: for campers: Propane Safety

&gt; Does anyone have any first-hand knowledge of incidents where propane
&gt; caused a horrendous explosion?  I think that the our schnozzes are
&gt; pretty good at detecting the rotten egg smell, so good that it's
&gt; pretty hard to stay where there's a big enough leak to cause an
&gt; explosion.
&gt; 

YES! I was a TV journalist in the midwest and California for ten years, 
and I covered several terrible RV explosions and fires. Many deaths and 
terrible burns. It does happen! One time a guy opened the door of his 
camper and while entering turned on a light. His mangled remains were 
found about 50 yards from the camper.
