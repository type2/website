Can anyone give me hints to the cause of failure to start when engine
is warm?  Cranks, but never fires up.  Never even sputters.  Starts
fine after cooling off.  This is 2.0L with AFC fuel injection.

Thanks,
Rodney

P.S. Tried searching the archive for this.  Very unsuccessful.  Every
link I followed to an article returned an incomplete piece of one or
two unrelated articles.  I'm using Netscape 1.12 for UNIX, and it
either doesn't like the interface, or the links are messed up.
