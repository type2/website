Subject: Campbells toy van

Sorry about the bandwidth, but I eanted to let any toy collector who didn't know about the special offer I found in the local coupons in Sunday's paper. a'55 panel vwn with some campbells decorations is available for $5.99 plus 2 labels.  You need the form, so start diggin' through the trash! There are three others in the set, a '31 Morris, a '60 delivery van, and a model T van.
sorry if this has been posted before
