Hello,

I *think* Joel had a list of clubs the
other day. I am not sure if this one
was on the list:

German Air Suckers Society (G.A.S.S.)
927 Liberty St.
Salem, OH 44460
216-332-1865 (9 a.m. - 9 p.m. Eastern)

They have 6 bi-monthly newsletters, 
approx. 60 pages long, with show info,
free classifieds, and all clubs are
invited. It costs $20/yr to join.

Tell them Anthony Gelato sent you!

Lori (and Anthony) Gelato
