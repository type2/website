&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to replace/repair the pop-top

We had the same problem and killed two birds with one replacement screen. 
We had an auto upholsterer do for us with real &quot;no-see-um&quot; screening that 
we got at REI. It seems they have bigger budgs in Germany since the 
screen is pretty course. Anyway, the upholsterer did it in one day (and 
threw in double zipper pulls for the main window cover as well. I took 
one look at all the screws which hold th canvas portion of the pop-top in 
place and decided this was NOT an easy 'do-it-yourself' project.
 
BTW, we also put the no-see-um screening in the side window screen frames 
(just glued in a piece over the existing screen) so now we are no-see-um 
protected all around except the back snap in. Of couse, now the flies and 
all get in whenever we open the door and can't get OUT - Oh well.

Hope that helps -Jack
