Subject: Re: Bridgestone RD-603 LT Tires



&gt;Is anyone using the Bridgestone RD-603 LT tires?
&gt;
&gt;I know someone was because the tire is listed on &quot;the vanagon list 
&gt;tire database.&quot; We can't find the Yokohama's anywhere and I think 
&gt;the Bridgestone's are a little less expensive.
&gt;

I use the Bridgestones on my '85 Westy, and am very happy with 
them.  They wear well, ride quietly, and have decent traction.  
Also, they have a very high load range - D, while most LT or 
reinforced tires are load range C.
