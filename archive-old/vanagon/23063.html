Check that everything is solid back there by the tranny (insofar as the 
linkage goes anyway) and check it out per the Bentley manual.  This 
almost sounds like the dreaded gearshift housing clip failure.  Check on 
the clip by pulling the backup light switch and peering into the tranny 
through the hole.  You're checking to see whether the clip that holds the 
selector finger onto the end of the selector shaft is still in place.  If 
it is then your problem's elsewhere.  If not and the selector finger is 
about to fall off then you'll need to find another clip and put it on.  
Make sure to fish the old clip out first with a pencil magnet.  

I'd also check the tranny fluid level as well.

Write me direct with any questions.

Jack
