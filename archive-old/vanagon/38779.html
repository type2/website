Subject: Re: Propane Auto-Stop Valve

&gt;I replaced the propane auto-stop valve in my '86 Westy 18 months ago, and now
&gt;its frozen up again (2nd time in 3 years). The RV shop wants $115 for a rebuilt
&gt;valve, and $56 to install it. I read in the archives about rebuild kits- will
&gt;one of these fix a frozen valve? Where do I find one? The RV shop said I
&gt;probably have moisture in the tank that's causing the valve to rust. How do I
&gt;confirm/correct this? Should I just replace the whole tank assembly?
&gt;
&gt;I never had this problem with my '83.

Mark,

You might try having the tank purged by a good propane supplier.
