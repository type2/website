&gt;&gt;Grateful Dead Calls It Quits After 30 Years
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;By KARYN HUNT

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) - The Grateful Dead - R.I.P.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;After 30 years of making music, the Grateful Dead, the house band of
&gt;&gt;the 1960s counterculture, is breaking up.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The move came four months after the death of its founder and guiding
&gt;&gt;spirit, Jerry Garcia.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;After four months of heartfelt consideration, the remaining members of
&gt;&gt;the band met yesterday and came to the conclusion that the 'long
&gt;&gt;strange trip' of the uniquely wonderful beast known as the Grateful
&gt;&gt;Dead is over,&quot; the group said in a statement Friday.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Grateful Dead, which Garcia and other members formed in 1965 in San
&gt;&gt;Francisco, was one of rock 'n' roll's top-drawing acts for three decades.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Other groups had more hits, but the Dead attracted a doggedly devoted
&gt;&gt;cult following that brought together Haight-Ashbury dropouts, weekend
&gt;&gt;hippies and establishment stalwarts. Legions of Deadheads traveled with
&gt;&gt;the band around the country to attend the long, free-form concerts that
&gt;&gt;became the band's trademark.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When Garcia formed the band with Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzman, Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot;
&gt;&gt;McKernan and Phil Lesh, he initially called it the Warlocks, not
&gt;&gt;knowing there already was another band by that name.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;They had to find a new name, so they turned to a dictionary at Lesh's
&gt;&gt;house and the first words they saw were &quot;grateful dead,&quot; defined as a
&gt;&gt;traditional British folk ballad in which a human helps the ghost of
&gt;&gt;someone who has died recently find peace.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A breakup had been predicted since Garcia died of heart failure Aug. 9
&gt;&gt;at a drug rehab center.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Although individually and in various combinations they will
&gt;&gt;undoubtedly continue to make music, whatever the future holds will be
&gt;&gt;something different in name and structure,&quot; the group said in its statement.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;It's a sad day,&quot; said the band's publicist, Dennis McNally. &quot;But you
&gt;&gt;know, they've made their decision.&quot;
