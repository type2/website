Subject: 1988 prices put 1995 prices in perspective

The prices recently posted for a 1988 Westfalia sort of puts a different
perspective on the EV Campers...

&gt;VANAGON GL CAMPER, $21,180. - $21,690.
&gt;Air conditioning with outlets in rear only, $990.
&gt;AM/FM cassette radio with anti-theft feature, $625. (Geez what a ripoff!)
&gt;Rear window wiper with intermittent feature, $180.
&gt;Power heated exterior mirrors, $180.
&gt;Power package with power front windows &amp; door locks including
&gt;   side door and rear hatch, $450.
&gt;Cruise control, $220.

This adds up to US$24335. At 3% annual inflation rate, this is US$29929. in
1995 dollars.  The EV Campers are going for significantly less than that.
(Not MSRP of course.)
