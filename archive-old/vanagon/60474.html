Subject: VOA redo of motor (was EV latch stuck)


&gt;Vanagons, having had an 87 which with ALL the usual problems kept us going
&gt;for
&gt;115K miles before I sold it to buy the EV. If anyone is interested in my
&gt;experiences with that car please post.  Most notably, I got VOA to pay for
&gt;the
&gt;SECOND redo of my motor due to failed cylinder head seals at 96K miles. I
&gt;have
&gt;all the documentation on how I did this if anyone is interested.

Rob,

I would be interested in this.  I got myself in a situation with a VW
dealer, a service contract company, and VWOA.  Seems that despite what some
folks say about VWOA helping with head gasket repairs I got the brush off
from them.  I have not posted my situation to V_at_L yet because I'm still
thinking about how hard I want to pursue this.
