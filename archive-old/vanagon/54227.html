Subject: Re: diesel over heating?????

&gt;|  how hot on the temp guage should my 82 vanagon diesel register??
&gt;| 
&gt;| ..it goes up just past the little redlight (about 1/2 way ) and stays...no 
&gt;| matter if your sitting still or running down the road....when i replaced the 
&gt;| engine i placed new thermostat and attemped to blead the radiator.

That is where my new thermostat sits as well... Scared the hell out of me that
I had put it in upside down or something on my test drive because my temp
gauge used to sit right above the white block marker and if I turned on
the heater when it was cold out, I could make the needle plumet down into that
white block. It was nice to have heat in the mountains with the new thermostat.
