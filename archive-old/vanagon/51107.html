Subject:      VW micromachines

Actually, the reason many folks couldn't find them at once is that they only
started shipping the VW set in assortments about 1-2 months ago. Slow ordering
for micromachines kept them out during the off season but they're shipping all
over now. Galoob does not ship all the various sets at the onset of the year.
They are figured on the back of this years sets but commonly, you don't see
them until late in the year. Same thing with most toy manufacturers who make
more than 10 or so toys in a series. Er...not that *I* buy toys or anything!
;-D
