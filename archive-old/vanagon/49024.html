&gt;Unfortunately we couldn't stay there overnight because of other

&gt;to meet --or see again-- in no particular order (name dropping to
&gt;start here) David Schwarze, Dave Easterwood, Jim Brill &amp; Heather, Pete
&gt;Sellers &amp; Rose, Tom Forhan &amp; Michelle, Jon Christensen, Jim Kirk &amp;
&gt;Cate (?), and I know I must be forgetting somebody else. I did NOT see
&gt;Bob Hufford, nor his 21-window superfind (Bob, where were you?) or Dan
&gt;Soiney (sp?) and his Manhattans.

Hi Guys! Made it home safe and sound today.  Sorry we weren't able to meet
up with everyone for lunch. We were invited to Bill Bowman's home for an
after the BBA wrap up party. He and his wife had worked so hard to put this
thing together they were ready for a little R&amp;R. Bill's wife Kathryn made
drinks all night and I cooked porkchops, chicken and ears of corn on the
grill. We had a great time. It sure was great to sleep at night and not get
eaten by mosquitoes.

My wife, Kate, is NOT a camper. She had a good time except for the mosquito
thing and the pit toilet arrangments (made for tall people). She had a good
time playing guitar with Dave Easterwood.  I'd like to thank Jim Brill for
picking up our beer bottles when he cleaned up his site to leave. Sorry we
didn't get to say goodbye. We enjoyed your company. 

It was great to meet people from the list and be able to put a face with the
name. Everyone was great! I did manage to meet up with Dan Soiney, and yes,
I drank from his bottle of $4.99 gin. What a hard luck story!! Thanks Dan!

The weather couldn't have been better. NO RAIN!! It was cool at night. Good
for sleeping. I heard the total was something like 94 registered vehicles
for camping and 44 busses with some misc. beetles and one Thing for the
caravan. 

I also stopped in Casey Illinois on the way home today and picked up the gas
cap I left behind the Friday before. You know a gas cap for an '80 Vanagon
costs $8 at BBTA? I now have a spare.

Hope to see you all next time!
