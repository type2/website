only thing I can think of is to smear some RTV sealant on the
&gt;gaskets, but that makes a huge mess.  Still, that's what I'm gonna hafta
&gt;do if someone doesn't tell me what the heck I am overlooking...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,

          I know this sounds simple, but have you thought of doubling up
on the gasket.  It sounds like you aren't getting enough preasure between
the two parts to make a good seal.  The red RTV sealant MAY work, but 
chances are it will burn off sooner than later.
