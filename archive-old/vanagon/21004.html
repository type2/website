If spraying water on the outside of the engine is not a good idea for 
whatever reason, what about spraying it on the inside?  I vaguely 
remember from my pre-VW life (high compression V8s) that some people were 
using water injection to combat detonation and carbon buildup.  The inlet 
for the water would have been a small diameter tube inserted below the 
carb.  The water would be drawn into the intake manifold by normal 
manifold vaccum, not sprayed under pressure.  

Would this help cooling at all or am I dreaming?  What if you used 
alcohol instead of water or a mix of alcohol and water?
