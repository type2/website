Subject: Re: More on tires

I've run non-reinforced tires on my westies for 7 years with no problems at
all.  However, I have never had more than 2 or three people in it at the
same time and I don't go off-roading with it (I DO carry alot of junk
though).  They should work fine for highway driving.

&gt;Today I priced a new set of tires for the 81 camper and found that the
&gt;reinforced sidewall specification adds about $25 to the price of each. My
&gt;question is does the higher load range tire benefit normal daily driving or
&gt;does it anticipate loading 9 people with all their luggage on a 70 mph desert
&gt;run? In other words, is the heavier tire necessary for safe operation in
&gt;light to medium duty?
&gt;
&gt;The PO had regular tires, two of which would be keepers. If the right answer
&gt;is to upgrade to the reinforced tires, would it be a problem to mix two and
&gt;two until those need replacing?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your opinions,
