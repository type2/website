Subject:      Hummmmm   Vanquished

Hi,
I would likr to thank JOEL, IAN, GREG, and JUSTIN for their help regarding
my bearing noise.
(A hum that disappeared when I turned to the right).  By spinning the wheels
with the car on the lift
my trusty mechanic, Louis, found the culprit - the outer right front
bearing.  Total cost 45$ (Cdn about 32$ US)) including the bearing.
Thanks again for the help and support.
Lloyd
