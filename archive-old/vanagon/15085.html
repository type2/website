Subject: oil temp confusion

I just installed an oil temp gauge into my 71' transporter
I have never used one before.  In most of my reading everything has said the
oil temp should be at 190  but  one of the VW 
mags. said that since I am using a dip-stick sensor the temp should read
under 260 since the oil is in the sump and has not passed through the oil
cooler.  my question is what is my max temp. and what should my avg. highway
temp. be reading?
thanks
tim
