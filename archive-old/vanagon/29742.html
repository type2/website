Subject:      re: 88 syncro

this guy was on the list for a while. he SAID his was an 88, but notice
that he has a canadian email address:

  88 Vanagon Syncro GL       Ron Cunningham       RCUNNING_at_FOX.NSTN.NS.CA*

he's also the ONLY 88 syncro of the 40+ syncros that i know about. most
are 1987's.
