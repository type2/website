Subject: Coolant Leak up Front

For some months now I have been trying to diagnose the mysterious 
disappearance of coolant from my 83.5 Westy.  I can fill the expansion tank 
(one with pressure cap)  and the overflow tank (one without pressure cap), 
and within a short period of time, &lt;1 day, the level in the expansion tank 
is down about 1&quot;.  It never drops below that.

So it makes sense that I have a leak somewhere.  The weather here in Or is 
getting warmer, and the other day I turned off the heat in the front of the 
van, and drove for a while.  When I came home, there was a large puddle of 
coolant on the ground.  I tightened the clamps on the front heater core, 
valve assembly etc, but it is still leaking only when the heat is turned 
off.

I guess that I should replace the hoses.  Does anyone know what the 
diameter of the hose is.  I am assuming that it is metric, therefore 
probably expensive and difficult to find.....

Thanks for your help.
