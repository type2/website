Subject: RE: Old bus info

Hello to all!

This database that my husband has is 
*not-for-profit* in any way, shape, or
form. It has never been printed in its
entirety - if we were to go to a show
in Connecticut, say, we might print the 
portion of it of CT folks. Then when he
meets someone, he asks for their name.
If they are on the list, he may ask for
more info, like what type of 64 bus. If
they want to be included, we'll add to
the list. It is *not* intended to be dis-
tributed to any persons, clubs or after-
market advertisers.  

If you belong to NEATO, SOTO, etc., you 
may already be on our list!  

It grew out of the NEATO (?) traveler's
directory, but we also add people who
we meet at shows, mostly in the north-
east. Anthony will find someone who is
looking for a certain year bus, and then
someone else is trying to sell the same
year bus. He'll try to connect them.
He is also pretty knowledgeable on parts/
fixing bugs/buses and he also welds (makes
roof racks, does floor pans, etc.).

If we travel in your area, we might call
you up (at reasonable hours, of course).
If Anthony has a part you need or you want
him to make you a roof rack, etc., his
motive is *not* to rake in big bucks. If he
has a part that he has no need for and you
need it, he is glad to get it in the right
hands at a reasonable price. Our mortgage
is not paid through these methods (believe
me)!

*If* you are interested, please provide your 
city, state, phone no. (opt.), any notes, 
and any clubs you belong to, that would be 
great. We *don't* ask for street addresses,
unless you offer it. We don't want to steal
your vehicle! We have pride in our vehicles,
too - most of the VW people we have met so far
are very respectful of other people's vehicles.  

I don't know what else to say - but we are
*not* Big Brother! This has been a hobby of
Anthony's for about 17 years or so. I can't
tell you how many people are calling at
home asking for info - Anthony lives, eats, 
and breathes this VW stuff! We do not mean
to offend anyone, by our request for info. 
But he has a wealth of information to offer.

We live in NJ and have about a dozen bugs
and buses (60's and 70's) at home. His 
daily drivers are a 67 Westy camper and 
a 66 bug. Please e-mail me or call us at
home, 201-347-4081, for more info. Thanks!
