Subject:      Re: DOT3 vs DOT4

Dot 4 has a higher boiling point.  Could make a difference in down hill
situations.  In addition, the Castrol Dot 4 is a higher quality fluid more
resistant to absorbing moisture.  Besides leading to rust and corrosion is the
system, moisture will obviously lower the boiling point. Enough of it could
cause unexpected failure after a hard stop.  I had it happen to me in a 924.
Panic stop, later no brakes.  Bleed and refilled system, was okay again. Good
brake fluid is cheap insurance.
