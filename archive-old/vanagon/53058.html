Ron--

I, for one, have gotten all 3.  I'm not sure what's going on, but I've
experienced problems yesterday and today too.  I sent a post to the list
at 6 am yesterday that still wasn't sent out on the list (at least not
to me) by noon.  I re-sent it at noon and finally received it back from
the list around 2:30.  I thought it was just my provider's mail system,
but apparently it's _at_lenti's.
