Re: 68-79 Van/WestyPart for sale 

Everybody,

Sorry to make this a general post, but I can't contact Bill Lund through 
EMail.


Bill,

Tried contacting you through two EMail addresses.  Both bounced.  I am 
interested in this stuff.  If the price is right, I will buy. You decide 
payment method.  I prefer UPS ground shipping.  Please EMail me.

Thanks,

Roy D. Robertson
