&lt;&lt; What about manufacturing an adapter piece of metal/plexi/wood to take an
 older Westy louvre?  Use vanagon rubber to hold/seal in the adapter then
 the old louvres are just screwed in place easily. I think the old ones
 were smaller than vanagon cutout, anyone?  Likely the Reimo catalog has
 louvred vanagon windows for a steep price.

Ron Maxon, NJ Limbo member, tho not on the v-gon list - has taken 68-79 westy
jalosies, and retroffited them into his '83.5 westy, with a aluminum
frame....
looks and works great...
