&gt;  Can anybody come up with the PIN # for the relay that is used with the aux.
&gt; battery hookup. I've been having a problem with my main battery going dead
&gt; after long periods of the van just sitting. I think the relay is supposed to
&gt; open when the motor is shut down. The relay is located under the drivers
&gt; seat in the spare batttery box.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Try  411915511 B.
