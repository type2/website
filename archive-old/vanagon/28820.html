Subject: Re: fixing old heat exchangers

&gt;Sami sez:
&gt;&gt;While the engine was out, I shopped around for a pair of used, but good,
&gt;&gt;heater boxes. The 2 pairs I saw were in worse shape than my own and both
&gt;&gt;merchants wanted $75 per box! That's the rustbelt for ya.
&gt;
&gt;I chime in:
&gt;       *Whoa_there_killer*...   You can get *new* ones from jc whipme for
&gt;around that price-I looked 'em up before I went the j-tube route (it's
&gt;always hot in Texas-well, ok, it's cold for maybe 3 days). They were $69
&gt;ea. as I recall.. Might be a bit more now that they're in season, but if
&gt;you're payin' $70, make sure they're shiny &amp; new.   I intend to replace
&gt;mine, but it'll be when it isn't a choice between heat and food.
&gt;


I believe the $70 heat exchangers in JCW are for the 1600cc engine.  I think
Sami is dealing with a more expensive/later model exchanger.  Also, I don't
know what you'll get if you order an exchanger from JCW--I recall hearing
that the sheetmetal is thinner on some models and rusts away faster.   My
local VW dealer sells the brazilian made exchanger for ~$80 for the 1600cc.
I don't have prices on the later ones.

When I was faced with the heat exchanger dilemma (1600 '71) I looked around
for some good used exchangers with smoothly working flaps.  I had them
sandblasted (for $5 each) and then I brought them to a shop and had them
weld the gaps between the sheemetal and the pipes.  I think that was $10 for
both.  I then painted them with engine paint (which has held up perfectly
after 10,000 miles).  It's best to pay the $10 for brazing or welding if you
don't do it yourself rather than do a patch job with goop/aluminum.  The
donut gaskets at the muffler to exhaust pipe on the exchanger eventually
allow exhaust gas to leak into any holes in the sheetmetal shell and then
into the bus where it will leak into you.  If you have your control box
flaps wired open you'll then have to decide between keeping your windshield
defrosted or poisoning yourself with CO.

Here are some things to check when shopping for used exchangers:

--Look for holes or deep pitting in the exhaust pipes.  If these conditions
exist forget 
  that exchanger.

--Check sheet metal for rust holes and loose fit around exhaust pipes.  This
can be 
  repaired by brazing/welding.  Also, check to see that the sheetmetal is
not badly
  dented--this will restrict hot air flow.

--Make sure that the flaps open and close fully and smoothly.  I would avoid
the 
  ones that aren't smooth.

--I cap off one end of the exhaust pipe with my palm and then blow through
it on the 
  other end.  This is a feeble attempt to check for leaks in the portion of
the pipe
  beneath the sheetmetal skin that you can't see.  I suppose there could be
small  
  fractures in the pipe that would only leak when the pipe is hot and expanded,
  but it makes me feel better to do the blow test anyway.

--It's a good idea to bring a new donut gasket to fit on the exhaust pipe.
Clean up 
  the rust on the pipe and see how the gasket fits.  On some non-OEM
exchangers the pipe
  is slightly smaller and the gasket does not fit snuggly on the pipe.  I
would avoid
  these exchangers since the dreaded exhaust leak will visit you sooner if
you can't
  clamp that gasket down well.

--Check for missing cable hardware.

Well, that's about all I can think of.  I've had good luck with good used
ones, but I'd recommend caution since there are many bad used exchangers out
there.

Good luck,
