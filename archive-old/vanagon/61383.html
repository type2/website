Subject: Friday F/Water in Exhaust of Air-Cooled Westy

Volks,
I'm looking at an 81 Westy for the family Micro-Motorhome. Should I be
concerned if, when running, large volumes of water comes from the
tailpipe of this
air-cooled engine?
Thinking about this, should I be concerned if large amounts of air begin
flowing from the tailpipe of our wasserboxer? 
It -is- Friday.
