Subject: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?
Date: Fri, 22 Nov 96 21:54:42 EST

Derek mentions that lowering tire pressure for better traction.
This is indeed standard procedure for the 4 and 6 wheel drive
Scania TGB 30 and 40 heavy trucks I used to drive. It makes
a great difference!

In my own Westy, lowering the pressure is no problem ;-), but
pumping it up again (in the &quot;field&quot;, far from a service station) is!.
I've tried:

Hand pump: Forget this. My arms are worn out before adding 10psi
into ONE tire.

12V Walmart (or insert generic department store name here) pump:
Does pump the tire, but: 

	Taking my four &quot;small&quot; LT195-75-R14 from 20 to 45 psi takes
	40 minutes!!! (including &quot;cool down&quot; intervals for the pump
	to keep it from smooking.) 

	After 1 year of use (only maybe 10 or so of these cycles,
	plus occational topping off) the pump performance seems to
	have degraded significantly.

The pump I'm talking about is the &quot;250&quot; psi 12v one. It comes in
a dozen different outsides (with and without: pressure gauge, extra 
12 V outlet, various color lights etc), but with the same pump inside. 
Prices range from $9.95 to 39.95. Surprisingly I havent found any alternative
to this pump. Any 12v &quot;candidate&quot; I've examined, regardless of brand name
contains the same pump inside the varuious shape housings.

Two alternatives that comes to mind: 1/ Buy an inverter and a 110V
pump: Price &gt;$100, way more than my student budget can devote to
this. 

2/ Buy a foot pump: Real cheap ($5-10) but do they work? Do they last?
And how long would it take me to pump the tires from 20-45 PSI?
I hate to buy potential junk that break on me when I really need it.

3/ Pressure tank (3 or so gal): Too bulky to motivate its place during 
extended trips, and how many tires does it fill on one &quot;charge&quot;? Less 
than four is my guess. 

Any other suggestions?

in a river bed once. Now wiser)
