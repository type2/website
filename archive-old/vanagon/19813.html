Subject: Re: help! my new tent

&gt;Well I love my new tent but I can't figure out how to 
&gt;put it together.  Tim Smith of this list described his
&gt;tent to me and it seems totally different.

Mark,
It just doesn't look like it'll work. Just send it to me and I'll, umm, I
don't know, find SOME use for it.       :-)

It may be that you're putting the bent end of the pole at the wrong end. I
forwarded your message to someone who might be able to help.

Good Luck!
