&gt;&gt;Anyone else experienced a speedometer that ocassionally just doesn't do
&gt;&gt;its speed thing. The odometer never seems to stop, but for about the past
&gt;&gt;year and a half, it will sudenly decide it isn't going to register
&gt;&gt;anything. So far it has come back just as suddenly and will keep going
&gt;

And Joel replied:

&gt;i think this is the Infamous VDO Drive Gear symptoms ... supposedly, there
&gt;is a little white plastic driver gear on the odometer that breaks easily.
&gt;it is common to ALL VDO speedos, in almost all euro cars ... my sister's
&gt; etc.....

This time I have to disagree with Joel.  Since odometer never stops working,
just the speedometer, then I don't think its the gear.

On my vanagon it was a dirty speedo assembly.

The tolerances are really tight within the assembly and a little grit would
make it either stick in the zero position or around 45 MPH.  

To clean it I used a solvent based silicon lubricant.  I don't think you
want any petroleum-based lubricant in there because it will gum up with time.

The speedometer is pretty easy to access.  Just take of the instrument pod,
and then remove the 4? screws holding it in place.  I couldn't the assembly
itself apart.  I guess the pressed fit parts are pretty tight.  But just
liberally spraying and trying to &quot;clean&quot; with the lubricant worked.  The
first time I used it fixed it for about a day, and then the speedo would
stick in a new spot.  The &quot;grit&quot; must have become partially dislodged and
moved to a new part of the assembly. The next day I liberally sprayed it out
again, and it has been working perfectly ever since (about 2 years now).

Hope this helps and Happy New Year.
