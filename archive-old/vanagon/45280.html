Enough of this crap! ENOUGH! If you want your life so tightly organized suit 
yourself! Go iron your shorts, line up your pencils, or do some other highly 
structured event that you can robot through. Yes the list is big and bulky, 
and it's always a newbie who whines loudest about it. Sure subject lines are 
nice, but my brain and the delete key helps me filter it just fine. I don't 
want a newsfilter chucking out stuff that may have some interest to me just 
because its inflexible list precludes spontaneity and curiosity. Think for 
yourself, if you're too busy, well... ya signed on, so maybe you should...
