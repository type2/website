Subject: a good gas heater find

Hi all,

I was driving to school this morning and saw a twisted exhaust pipe on the
shoulder.  It seemed to ring a bell but I couldn't place it.  later this
afternoon, I was returning and it was still there.  Could it be?  I'll be
damed, it is.  I found a BA 4 gas heater exhaust in nearly perfect
condition!  cool.  

In other heater news, My wife gave me a scanner for fathers day.  yippie!
(I'm not even a father) I hope to scan in all of my Eberspacher manuals and
Email them too anybody who is interested.  I've got manuals for the B 2,
early and late BN 2, late BN 4, and the Bently section for the BA 6.  The
first one I send goes to Tim Smith.  I promised Tim a manual about 6 months
ago and have lamely put it off.  Sorry Tim. Anyway, if you want a copy, let
me know and I'll try to get them out in reasonable amount of time--once
I've figured out how to use this thing.
