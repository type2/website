You might check the vent for obstructions by unscrewing the exterior
outlet fitting. Ensure that your tank is not overfilled. The Dometic
repairman here said that will prevent starting. Remove the combustion
chamber drain cap at bottom left facing the refer and drain. Blowing into the
drain with compressed air, *may* work. Use an air line or tire pump.
Consult your horoscope for an opportune time to try the above.
