Subject: Re: Why does O2 sensor requi

My understanding behind heated O2 sensors is that the electrical heating
element comes on immediatly upon startup and brings the temp of the sensor up
to operating temperature faster than w/o the electrical assist, depending only
on the heat from the exhasust.  This brings the ixture feedback system into
operation faster and reduces emissions during warmup.
