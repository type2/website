Subject: Re: vanagon oil warning system

One more observation on the occurance of the oil pressure warning light/
buzzer:

This last weekend, after several months of no problems, the buzzer problem
returned.  Possibly co-incidently I had just added a quart of oil (10W30)
after noticing the oil had dropped to the &quot;add&quot; line.  I drove off on an
interstate, and the very next time I came to a stop the oil light and buzzer
came on.  Again a slight rev and it stopped.  It did this 3 times that day,
but has now disappeared again.  Yesterday on a 500 mile trip to CT and back,
it never appeared.

It does seem to be related to oil temp, oil weight, fill level and/or outside
temperature.  Except for a momentary drop in pressure (several seconds while
slowing after a high speed run) I'm optomistic (sp?) that the pressure is OK??!!
