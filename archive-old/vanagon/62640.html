&gt;1) Very clean; paint w/in one year

&gt;4) No dents, rubber good
&gt;5) Owner tossed all Paper work on everything (even O-Haul!)
&gt;6) Says it will do 70mph all day at 35-38 mpg (he is an elderly gent

&gt;Price is $3,000 but apparently soft for I know he's had it on the market

Mark,
I would take anything this guy says with a grain of salt. Unless that `82
has been pointed down a 6% grade it's entire life, chances are 70mph and
35-38mpg are just a touch unrealistic. I've had my `82 diesel westy since
`88 and get 26-27 mpg tops but consistently. 70 mph, no way! I keep mine up
all the time and have never gotten that kind of mileage.
Good luck,
Bob Bellanca
