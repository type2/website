Subject: Dealers Dirty Deed!!!

OK folks, here's a nice one for you.  Last spring I had the dealer change
the oil, sheer lazines/stupidity/etc.  It was wet and muddy in the drive OK?
Today I go to change it again, I leave this coming Sat AM for 700 miles
straight run. Funny, last 3 times I did the oil the bolt spun out with my
fingertips, once lossened.  This time it took the socket wrench the whole way.

  Drop the plug into the oil drainpan and think no more about it. After the
oil has stopped dripping I wipe off the plug area, and into the threads a
bit with a cloth.  HEY what are those bits of curved metal on the cloth!??
Yup pieces of the threads from the drain hole!!!!  I dump the oil carefully
into a container and check the drain pan carefully.  Lots of curved thread
pieces, some the length of my fingernail.

  The bastards tightened my drain plug enough to strip it out of the case,
almost.  They may have used an air wrench on it. But it was done 'just
right', tighten up until real tight, then twist it more until you feel the
bolt go 'soft'. Not crossthreaded, a more professional job. Maybe I'm
paranoid, maybe someone was having a bad day, maybe they were in a hurry, or
maybe I've just been f*cked!!!  This was discovered after closing time
today, so tomorrow AM I'm going in to talk with them.

        In the meantime can someone tell me the best way to fix this and
properly.  Helicoil? larger tap size and fresh bolt? weld it up and
retap/reseat? I don't dare have this shake out 15 miles into the woods, so
its got to be solid.  Can't have it blow out on the highway at 4K rpm
either!.  Suggestions folks?  Thanks.  Will post the dealer discussion and
results tomorrow, meanwhile keep those letters coming.
