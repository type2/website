Subject: S. African VW dealer's e-mail address?

&gt; Carl Hansen said
&gt; ACTUALLY - I'm hoping there are lots of Canadian vanogoners, in fact, &gt;I hope most of them have Syncro's.  
&gt;And do we have anyone in South Africa??

	Does anyone have a South African VW dealer's E-mail address?
	I've been to the S.A.VW site but no dealers list e mail address'
	I still can't shake the idea of a true &quot;5 spd&quot; for my syncro
	or does anyone know if the S. African FWD 5 spd has the 
	compound low gear? I wouldn't want to sacrifice the super low 		granny
gear for this is what makes the syncro such a god in the 
	capability dept. Just know when to say when, right?
	Wanting it all - bigger motor and 75mph at 3800rpm or less...
	Jay
	Ps. My next syncro trip is to N. Cal. to see Zero! Cazedero.
