I am just saying thats what they charge for the big RVs and campers.
It could be less for the breadloaf. Anyway since there is no interest
it was just for your info. NYC hotels are $100.00 plus 14% sales tax
so for someone who wants to come to the city, i guess this is one
way not to break the piggy bank.
    I am getting my '84 vanagon ready it has been in storage for two
years and will be aheading south to Florida.
