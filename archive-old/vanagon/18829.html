Subject: fs: 1967 pop top


My friend has a '67 pop top in very good condition, one fender is 
dented.  The engine does not work, but is there.  The canvas is good.  
New brakes, tires, good tranny and front end, no rust.  He wants around 
$2,500.oo but you could talk him down to $2k.  he will install engine of 
your choice for more $.  This guy sold me my '71 pop top and I'm very 
happy with it.  Wish I had the money for the '67.  If you are serious 
about checking out a camper in San Diego, Ca then e-mail 
morrison_at_rohan.sdsu_dot_edu.
