&gt; &gt; Thats not far off what the VR6 produces. It is this torque (which is
&gt; &gt; produced at reasonable rpms) that, in my opinion, gives the van the hwy
&gt; &gt; cruising qualities that Bill and Ric enthuise about.

&gt;  If you can get one with 170-180 ft-lbs. of torque, I'd snap it up. VW list
&gt;  the engine as having 144 ft-lb _at_ 2200 rpm, 109 bhp _at_ 4500 rpm.


Oooops, sorry folks, I guessed I screwed up when converting the 190 Nm to
foot-lbs.
