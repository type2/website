Subject: tune-ups

Hi listees. Im hoping someone out there can give me some tips on tuning
up my 84 Westy. I looked in the archives ,but found nothing(dosnt mean
its not in there). Does anyone know of a book that would be the
equivalent of John Muirs idiots guide to vw's, that covers the vanagons?
This will be my first time tuning my bus so any help you can offer will 
be appreciated. Thanks
Dave 84 Westy
