Subject: RE: Vanagon rear speakers (in the AC unit)

Thanks to those who reponded.  You've probably prevented a decapitation.
Now a follow-up.  The AC cover seems to have significant cracks near the
bolts that hold this thing up (particularly, the ones towards the sides
of the van).  Is this at risk of falling?  Will VW fix it (for free)?
