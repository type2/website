i hit that page, but i was using Lynx, since i dont currently have a 
modem cabable of handling SLIP or PPP at anything orth worying about, and 
it was a bunch of FRAME's...i got 5 linkes for frames the 3rd was the 
text, the rest was normal stupid things people use frames for that would 
just as perfectly be done w/o! including &lt;of all things&gt; and EMPTY frame!!


anyhow, if your browser doesnt support frames, that is why you saw 
nothing...else, i donnu.....

&gt;      Just a blank page; other, unrelated sites worked.
&gt;      
&gt;      Did anyone else have that problem?

&gt; Howdy all. I've been playing around at the new official Volkswagen website, and
&gt; thought I'd invite everyone to go over and sign up for the official VW owners
&gt; club, register to get free stuff sent in the mail, and all that fun stuff.
&gt; They've really been working on the site, and it's coming along. I look forward
&gt; to getting all the mail!
&gt; the new URL is:
&gt; http://www.vw_dot_com/welcome.htm
&gt; but you can get there from the old one as well.
&gt; They finally acknowledge us as well, the owners of older models, and the car
&gt; shows and such...
