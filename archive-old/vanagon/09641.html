1968 VW Station Wagon
Popular Imported Cars, March 1968

While safety and smog occupy much of the 1968 automotive headline news,
appearance, comfort, convenience, handling, ride and utility are
additional nouns you can use to describe the new Volkswagen &quot;boxes&quot;,
the beetle's harder working cousin.

Taking the obvious first, let's discuss the body.  While VW's Type 2
vehicles, known to the public as station wagons and trucks, have never
been glamour wagons, you'll have to decide for yourself this year if the
term applies!  Their all-new, longer, sleek bodies start with a 27 %
larger one-piece, wrap-around, double thickness interlayer windshield
some 2 inches higher and 9 inches wider.  It is wiped by a two-speed
wiper haveing longer blades powered by a stronger motor.

Three long large windows on each side replace the many small windows we
all know, which when combined with the five inch increase in length,
produce a long, modern appearance.

On the right, a 41.7 inch wide sliding door replaces the familiar double
doors.  The door slides in three tracks, top, bottom, and middle.  Turn
the handle and the back of the door pops outward; a touch of the handle
more and the door slides back easily into a locked-open position.  A
light push, and the door closes and locks, and an additional turn of the
handle pulls the back of the door in flush and secures it tightly shut.
The door is 48.2 inches high, plenty big for the largest goods a home
owner is likely to want to move.  The door can be locked on the inside
by a button or outside by key.

There is a vent wing window in the sliding door and another in the left
rear window; a third vent wing is optional opposite the sliding door.

The higher, stronger, larger one piece bumpers wrap around to the sides,
the ends of the front bumper being flattened and rubber-covered to form
steps to enger the front doors.  The doors are about 2.5 inches wider
and contain larger, roll-down windows.  Stationary glass fills out in
front of the roll-down windows, but vent wings are optionally available.

Just below the windshield is a large horizontal air intake grill for the
ventilation system.  The glass covers for the headlights have been
dropped  providing better light output and the parking lights have been
moved into the front turn signal housings via dual filament bulbs.  The
turn signals are mounted below the headlights and wrap around for
visability from the sides.  Amber reflectors are attached to the sides
of the body just below the front doors, red reflectors at the rear.  Two
large outside mirrors are mounted on the doors to provide excellent
driver visibility.  For safety, they fold backward or forward upon
impact.  Door hinges are hidden in the jams to smooth the outside skin
and reduce maintenance.  The air intakes for the engine have been moved
high on the sides of the body in the form of scoops, where they will
draw in less dust.  All of the models come with white roofs and a
variety of body colors, except black.  While the vehicles are
fractionally wider and higher, they are up to 5 inches longer.  So that
everyone will still recognize the make of the vehicle, the circled VW
insignia remains at the front.

The inside of the vehicle now has what can be called decor.  While the
law specified a certain amount of padding for each passenger, it wasn't
just pasted on.  Thorough planning went into the integration of the new
vinyl upholstery and the padding to produce a beautiful modern interior.
The entire dashboard is padded and the padding is shaped into a thick
hood across the entire width of the dashboard; the instruments are also
recessed to prevent windshield reflection.  There's also padding on the
sun visors, all six armrests and ashtrays, and the partitions behind the
front seats and upper edges of center seat.  The rest of the inside is
covered with tasteful vinyl upholstery and headlining, and rubber floor
mats.

The dashboard is all new.  THree round dials face the driver.  The left
contains a new electric gas gauge in the top half, and warning lights
for generator, oil pressure, high beams, parking lights and turn signals
occupy the lower half.  The speedometer is centered and the right dial
is a dummy for installation of a clock.

All dashboard knobs are large, flat, rubber-covered and identified with
symbols.  They are arranged below the dials for convenience of the
driver.  To the right of the dials are four knobbed levers for control
of heater and ventilation systms.  Centered on the dash is a dummy for
the radio.  Below it is a padded draw-type ashtray with a flipper that
pops up to protect the dashboard from smoke.  Below the ashtray is a
padded pull-twist type handbrake handle.  It attaches to the same type
long handbrake lever behind the dash to provide the usual excellent
positive handbrake action.  On the right is a conventional glove
compartment with a padded, top-hinged door.  An over-center hinge action
holds the door open for access.  Above the door is a padded &quot;chicken&quot;
handle.

The two-spoke steering wheel is now deep-dished and the steering column
is angled downward toward the driver more than previously.  The ignition
lock is mounted in the steering column where it is out of the way for
safety, and the lock is angled upward for convenience.  Only one key is
needed for ignition and doors.  The dimmer switch is the turn signal
lever, actuated by pulling it upwards.  The fuse box under the dash now
has a total of ten fuses to spread the circuits out, and the cover is
marked with symbols to identify each one.

Doors are neatly upholstered in leatherette, the armrests padded, and
window winder and vent wing knobs, large, flat and rubber-covered.  The
inside door handles are the small, flush, pull type used in the sedans,
while a plastic door pull permits closing.  At the rear of the window
sill of each door is a plunger for locking the door from the inside.
Doors can be locked from the outside with or without a key.  The vent
wing catch is an unusual one with a knob that must be rotated forward
before the whole catch can be pushed forward to open the window.  This
type of lock adds an extra measure of theftproofing.  On the wagons,
the armrest is formed on top of a box section channel running the width
of the door and used to conduct fresh air from under the dashboard to
the outlets behind the front partitions.

There are two model station wagons available, named appropriately
enough, from their chief distinctions, their seating arrangements.  The
nine-seater has a separate driver's seat and double passenger seat in
front, a three passenger center seat and a three passenger rear seat.
With this configuration, the driver's seat slides separately into 8
different positions through five inches of travel, front to rear, via
a lever at the front of the seat, and the backrest adjusts by turning
a wheel next to the lever.  The passenger seat adjusts to two positions
by moving the whole seat into one of two mounting notches on the seat
bottom section.  The backrests of both seats hook firmly to the
partitition behind them for safety.  The right hand seat on the center
bench has a folding backrest that locks in the upright position for
safety.  The release is incorporated into the backrest high up on the
side.

In the seven-seater, the driver's seat and front passenger's seat are
separated by a wide aisle, and the center bench seats two passengers.
As noted in VW advertising, this arrangement makes it convenient to
swat the children seated in the rear without having to stop the car!

In either model, the center and rear seats can be quickly unbolted for
removal to carry 177 cubic feet of almost anything.  There are grab
handles on the back of the partition for the front passenger and behind
the center seat.

The all new heating and ventilation systems are an interesting surprise,
and both seem to perform more than adequately.  There are two defroster
slots toward the center of the windshield, two heater vents under the
dash, another in the back of the small step between the front seats and
two more under the rearmost seat.  Two red knobbed levers on the dash
control the heat, individually on the left and right sides.  Depressing
one or both releases heat from the defrosters.  Some of this heat can
be tapped for the underdash vents by throwing the lever near the vents
upward.  More of the heat can be taken off for the vent in front of the
center seat by a pull knob under the front of the driver's seat where
the twist type heater control used to be.  The two vents under the rear
seat bench are controlled by levers on the vents themselves.  The whole
system is fast and easy to use, provides more heat, and an even
distribution, with individual control front to back and left to right.
At highway speed, on a cool day, it pushed enough heat to the defroster
vents to make it impossible to hold a hand on the vent!  The larger
engine and better insulation is responsible.

The ventilation system has two slots under the windshield for defogging,
two air-conditioner-type rotating louvered outlets on the extreme ends
of the dashboards and two more on the backs of the front seat
partitions.  Depressing one or both of the blue-knobbed levers on the
dash turns it on left to right, and individual levers on the four round
outlets permit turning each outlet off by itself.

The windshield washer, activated by a push of the button in the center
of the wiper knob has a capped plastic container mounted in the kick
panel in front of the front seat passenger.  Pulling the black cap off
permits access to the 1.5 quart container.  A hose with a tire valve
on it allows it to be pressurized easily.

Front and rear dome lights are mounted in the center of the headlining;
the rear light is controlled from the dashboard, the front by a switch
on the light itself.

The large inside rear view mirror and its stalk are covered in plastic
for safety and provides excellent visibility when combined with the two
generous outside mirrors.  The visors swivel to the side or clip into
their forward position.

The plastic brake fluid reservoir is mounted under the left side of the
dashboard for ready accessiblity, and is transluscent for checking the
fluid level at a glance.  It leads to dual circuit brakes designed to
leave one circuit operating at all times if one of the two circuits
fails.  A brake warning light on the dash lights when the brake pedal
is depressed if either front or rear wheel circuit should leak.
Depressing the light bulb turns the bulb on as a check on the bulb and
the electric circuit.  The light is activated by a shuttle piston on a
separate cylinder inside the housing for the brake master cylinder.  The
front hydraulic brake circuit pressurizes one side of the double headed
piston, the rear the other side.  When the system is pressurized by
stepping on the brake pedal, each of the opposing pistons is pressed
upon equally and the piston doesn't move.  A leak in either circuit
reduces the pressure on one side forcing the piston to move;  this in
turn makes an electric contact in the cylinder, lighting the warning
light. Building the cylinder and its hdraulic connections into the
master brake cylinder housing minimizes the chance of leaks at the
connections.

There's one seat belt for each seat.  The two front outboard seats will
have combination lap/shoulder belts, while all the other seats have lap
belts.  The combination belts will have retractors to keep the belts off
the floor and handy, while all the belts are of the quick release type.

In the wagons and trucks with two separated front seats, the spare tire
is mounted upright in a well in the left side of the luggage compartment
behind the rearmost seat, and covered with a semi-rigid plastic hood
that snaps to the floor; in the three-passenger seat models, the spare
is under the front seat.

These vehicles now have the 1600 engine used in the Squareback and
Fastback, but with the upright superstructure for the fan.  Bore and
stroke are 3.36 and 2.72 inches (1584cc capacity), raising the
horsepower to 57 at 4400 rpm and torque to 81.7 ft lbs. at 3000 rpm.
The engine governor has been dropped and there's a new carburetor
(Solex 30 PICT-2) which has a larger float bowl, different jets and a
larger oil bath air cleaner.  However, top speed remains at 65 mph and
acceleration is substantially the same because of the heavier curb
weight and heavier payload of the vehicle and slightly slower turning
engine.  Compression ration is raised to 7.7:1 but regular fuel is still
used and delivers 23 miles per gallon.

The positive crankcase ventilation system is continued while the exhaust
emission control system consists of a modified carburetor designed to
more accurately deliver the fuel, a distributor with modified advance
curve and 0 degree (Top Dead Center) initial timing, and a carburetor
dashpot.  The dashpot is vacuum controlled from the intake manifold and
holds the throttle cracked slightly open during conditions of high
vacuum such as deceleration, to provide enough fuel at all times for a
more completely burned mixture.  The 0 degree timing and an idle speed
of 850 rpm control emission at idle.  (The .004&quot; valve gap still
applies, as do all other tuneup specifications.)

The carburetor preheater is an interesting development.  The underslung
oil bath air cleaner has one air intake horn.  Last year's weight loaded
air valve is replaced by a valve controlled by cable running to the
engine's thermostat.  When the engine's cold, the thermostat closes the
valve and all carburetor air comes via a large flexible hose from the
area of the two right hand cylinders.  This produces a warm air supply
to better vaporize the fuel during warmup, regardless of engine speed.
When the engine warms up, the valve opens, letting cooler engine
compartment air into the carb.  The whole system keeps the carburetor
air temperature more in tune with the engine temperature for smoother
performance when the engine's cold.

The gas tank capacity has been increased to 15.8 gallons to provide a
cruising range of more than 300 miles.

THe sleeper for '68 is the new suspension and transmission.  The four
transmission ratios remain the same, but the reduction gears in the
wheel housings have been dropped and this ratio incorporated into the
ring and pinion ratio, which is now 5.375:1; this new ratio does not
completely make up for the dropped reduction gear ratio however, and
the engine now turns over slightly slower for a given road speed.
Dropping the reduction gear housings from the wheels increases the
sprung/unsprung weight ratio to improve the ride and better hold the
wheels on the ground.  The transmission is now a strongly ribbed three-
piece job with a separable bell housing, one oil drain plug, and an oil
capacity of 7.4 pints.  The ring and pinion gearing is now hypoid and
10mm offset for quieter running and the differential housing is carried
in tapered roller bearings.

Together with these changes is a double jointed rear axle having
constant velocity universal joints at each end of each axle, each joint
being capable of absorbing up to one inch of axial play.  In addition
to the usual trailing arms which absorb acceleration and deceleration
thrust, there are now diagonal trailing links which absorb side thrust
(the axles tubes have been dropped and the rear wheel bearings have
self-contained lubrication).  The diagonal links are bracketed onto the
torsion bar housings on each side of the forward transmission mount and
swivel on rubber-bushed lateral axes.  They then curve outward and
attach to the rear axle at the wheels.  The rear wheel track is also
increased about 2.5 inches.

The importance of this is the negative rear wheel camber achieved
regardless of vehicle loading or body lean, and the minimized track,
toe-in and camber changes during the full range of vehicle loading and
body lean.

At the front, kingpins are replaced by ball joints which extend the
lubrication period to 6,000 miles and reduce the number of grease
nipples to four on the axle tubes and one for the swing lever shaft.
The trailing arms have been lengthened about an inch, having the effect
of softening the front torsion bars.  The front stabilizer is continued
and the front track increased 0.4 inch.  The steering shaft now has the
flexible coupling used in the sedans, and the steering ratio has been
speeded up slightly to 14.7:1.

The 6-ply rating tires are continued for the wagons, while the trucks
get 8 PR shoes;  both vehicles have slightly increased tire pressures.

The final result of these suspension changes is passenger car like ride
and handling that has to be tried to be believed.  The road for this
vehicle has been almost miraculously smotthed and even hard bumps are
easily taken at speed.  The handling properties are neutral up to all
practical cornering speeds and body lean negligible.  Heavy side winds
can still be felt, but the resulting vehicle movements are largely
self-correcting.

The new heavier engine is no longer cantilever mounted to the
transmission.  It now has a &quot;crossmember type&quot; two point mount of its
own at the very rear, similar to that used in the Fastback and
Squareback.  A new single mount at the front of the transmission
completes the three-point engine/transmission mounting system,
designed to provide better engine support, torque resistance and
vibration absorption.

With only minor changes, the maintenance service for these vehicles
remains substantially the same.  The maintenance interval stays at
6,000 miles, and the oil change at 3,000; the lubrication period has
been increased from 3,000 to 6,000 miles.  There is still a free
initial maintenance service, now given at 600 miles instead of 300.

The warranty period for all 1968 Volkswagen vehicles has been increased
from 6/6 plus goodwill policy, to 24 months or 24,000 miles whichever
comes first.

All in all, the VW &quot;boxes&quot; have been considerably imporved in all the
important areas.  We leave it to you to decide if beautiful is the word
to describe them, but they have got to be driven to be believed.
