Subject: Syncro Convention! :)


Well, almost!
I pulled into the parking lot of the REI (Recreational Equipment Inc) here in
Spokane today and parked next to another Syncro.  It was a 90 or 91, and
silver colored.  While walking across the parking lot I past ANOTHER Syncro.
 This one was a white 86 or 87 GL Camper.  I couldn't believe it.  Including
mine, there were THREE Syncros in one small (15-20 cars) parking lot.  I
thought I might meet one of the owners when  I came out of the store, but
both were gone when I returned.  I wonder if either of the other Syncro
owners noticed the abundance of Syncros??  
Wouldn't happen to be anyone on the list would it??
