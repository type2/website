HI,
Yes I am looking down the hatch, it helps but the distributor is still 
 placed in a bad position for maintenance. I wonder how people in the 
 earlier models without the hatch maintain there mental calm.  I guess 
 my big complaint is that the upright have every thing out in the open 
 to work on, and it seems that the later motors hide or place 
 components in positions that are awkward to work on or even observe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As I continue on my odyssey of discovery on the peoples camper I find 
&gt;&gt;&gt; things on this pancake motor that seem, well, difficult. The most 
&gt;&gt;&gt; current displeasure is replacing the points, what sort of a magnetic 
&gt;&gt;&gt; contortionist to you have to be to get every thing setup right? Is 
&gt;&gt;&gt; there a secret 0 clearance right angle screwdriver I need? Do you pull 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the distributor to get to all the screws on the perimeter off the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; housing ie: the screw that holds the wire grommet in place is 
&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible to get to. And last - does a electronic point replacement 
&gt;&gt;&gt; system, like the Pertronix (?) unit work in this distributor?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Clay &quot;give me back my upright &quot; Perry
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Are you looking down at the engine through the top engine hatch?
&gt;&gt;
