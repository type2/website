&lt;&lt;My current problem is one of the bolts I used to put the exhaust back 
on after I put new heads on was too long and striped the threads.  After a 
while it has blown the gasket and is real noisy now.  If I go get this fixed, 
that will be the end of my van I'm sure of it.  What is the &quot;cheapest&quot; way to 
fix this temporarily at least.  I don't care if the repair only lasts 6 
months, I have to do it myself.  Any suggestions (and prayers) would be 
greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;

Bryan,

Get yourself some case-savers for a T1 upright motor. see what threads they 
are, they come in both metric and American threads, drill and tap the holes
in the head for the case savers, install them with a stud with two nuts or
a bolt, use the strongest loctite you van find. You'll end up with a proper, 
long lasting repair, you can screw the stock VW 8mm studs into the case 
savers.

Brian.
