Subject: Funny mini-van sort of VW's

&gt;This is a VW list, are we to start finding out what a person belives in
&gt;before we help with the vw? 
&gt;I thought this list was for all denominations; aircooled, waterboxers &gt;and
&gt;those new funny looking mini-van sort of vw's!
&gt;Gimme a break!

I'm not going to  touch the missionary issue.  You can insult me, my
family, my upbringing but pleeeze don't call my Eurovan a Mini-van.  If i'd
wanted a minivan there are many much smaller and far less practical vans
available.
