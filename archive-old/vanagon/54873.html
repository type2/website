Subject: question about Macs and VW relation

I'm just wondering if there is a connection between VW owners and Macintosh
users?  Seems that most people I know that have a Mac, have a VW, and most
of the time it's a van.  I have a Macintosh Duo 2300c and an 85
Transporter. . .
What do PC users prefer? Or am I the odd ball out?

Hope I don't start something. . .  ?~)  &lt;-- That's a face with a black eye
and a bent nose.

Happy Friday
