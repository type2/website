Subject: Window Seal Trim Strips

Do the plastic (that used to look like chrome) strips that are inlayed in
the window seals on my '85 Vanagon serve any useful purpose?  They have
discolored and look kind of nasty now and I'd like to just take them out.

Will my windows fall out as a result?  Will they leak?
