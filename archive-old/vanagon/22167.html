Subject: august campout personnel roster


It appears that how many vehicles we have for the August 25-27 campout
determines our choices.  Therefore, I need to ask for an update
on those planning to attend.  I've heard from several of you via
private e-mail, and have been constantly adding/deleting names as
necessary.  Below is what I have for current expected attendance.  If
you do NOT plan to attend, would you please let me know?
