What about using the type you see on work vans ex Detroit? They look like
gutter clamps and pipe metal. Not too pretty but functional. I guess you
could probably paint it tho'.

&gt; I was wondering if you could steer me toward a heavy duty roof rack
&gt; for my eurovan.  The thule and similar ones are too flimsy for my use
&gt; (I am a carpenter).  Perhaps I need to design one and have it
&gt; fabricated?
&gt;
