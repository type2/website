Subject: Re: New life for worn out air flow meter

 Regards running rich,
   One VW mechanic I know told me once that the most common problem
causing this is the microswitches next to the airflow meter. The meter
works but the signal isnt transmitted to the ecu. These were about 50$
to replace on my '85.
   By going thru the same problem, I ended up with an extra ECU for an
85 [digijet]- let me know if anyone needs one-I'll give you a good deal
on it!
