Subject: 95 EV Camper- Winnebago parts have me miffed (long)

Hey Now,
 All you EVers. I'm not in a very good mood about the state of my EV Camper.
Sofar I have have a very problematic year of ownership. Every 3 months I have
had some type of problem. This latest problem might be of interest to us
EV-Camper Winnebago conversions. Now for the story:

My wife,Suzin, drove out to the inlaws in Pittsburgh. She popped the top,
plugged in and fired up the propane furnace. During the visit we stayed in the
EV because I am allergic to the inlaws cats. It had a full tank of LP and
things were toastie. I arrived 3 days later where I met Suzin and the EV at the
airport. We went back to the inlaws. I checked the H20/battery/LP guage panel
and saw that we had 1/2 tank of LP left. Well another day goes by and we're
still toastie until about 6pm and the heat goes cold. We checked the led guages
again and the LP tank read full. Hmmmm.... I then thought to check the actual
guage on the tank its self. It was empty, NO propane! I went back to the inside
led guages again and all of them (battery, fresh H2O, Grey H20 and LP ) were
reading eradic, full one second empty another. Luckily we had a 120v ceramic
heater to plug into the wall(Shoreline).

When we got home I dropped it off at the Dealership (Flemington, NJ). They were
kind enough to give me a rental car(that was cool). I dropped by the next day
and the EV was not fixed. Apparently the VW mechanics were not able to diagnose
the Winnebago parts by themselves and needed Winnebago's assistance.  The
closest Winnebago shop is in Pennsivania. It was suggested that I take my EV
out to them to have the Winne parts checked, specifily the led guages panel. I
told them, in no uncertian terms, that the only place I intended to take my EV
was back to this VW  dealership and that they were responsible for having a
qualified mechanic trained to work on the Winnebago conversion parts in house.
That's what I was told when they sold me the Camper. I scheduled to drop the VW
off a week later but the dealership was unable to get a Winnebago mechianic out
on the day we scheduled. Luckily I enjoyed taking the day off. Again today I am
going to attempt to drop my EV off. This time I hope the Winnebago mechanic
will be able to make it out.

Well I hope that they are able to fix the problem this time. I would like to
take it out camping but not when you can't trust what your guages say.
Otherwise I love the plushmobile and all of the critical systems are working.

Has anyone else had to have Winnebago called in to service their Camper?
