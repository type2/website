Subject: Re: '56 kombi - brakes (again)

&gt; My splitty has perfect brakes, once I stop hard a couple of times. The problem 
&gt; is that if I leave the beast sitting around for a month or more and then go to 
&gt; stop, it usually pulls hard to the right.  I think that the shoes might stick to
&gt; the drums a little, or maybe some brake fluid's getting in there. Whatever the 
&gt; case, a few good hard stops usually &quot;machines&quot; the drums/shoes so that 
&gt; subsequenst stops are fine.  If I drive it every day I don't get the problem.
&gt; 
Well, since it's come up, what causes that hard pulling when you first
stop? My '67 has only recently started doing that, and as far as i can
tell, none of the cylinders are leaking. It pulls really hard to the
right the first 3 or 4 times I stop, then is fine, then starts to pull
to the left. What might be behind this?
Thanks
Richard
