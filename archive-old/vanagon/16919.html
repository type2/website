&gt; &gt;&gt; PS for people interested in exotica, I am now using a high speed exhaust
&gt; &gt;&gt; analyser and it is _way_ cool.  I get an instant readout of rich or lean
&gt; &gt;&gt; mixture, if I had this six or seven engines ago (not all mine) I would have
&gt; &gt;&gt; saved at least a couple of those engines.  It is really helpful, and I think
&gt; &gt;&gt; will enable me to get the most life out of this engine.

&gt; &gt;Eugene,
&gt; &gt;	How much would something like this cost?  Can you tell us who
&gt; &gt;makes such a beast for the common consumer?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks!

&gt; &gt;From Gene Berg, around $250 for the bung you braze to the collector and the
&gt; readout.

I'll give you all a hint, a $35 O2 sensor, the bung to be welded
to the manifold and a digital voltmeter are all it really takes.
There is a FAQ about this available from the fwd VW FAQ location
(which I am not currently sure of the location).  I've personally
been wondering how HALTECH and Berg can charge highway robbery
prices for their little LED voltmeters.  In short it goes like
this, the O2 sensor thread is same as 18mm sparkplug, you can
get the bung from Parts Place or elsewhere or get a &quot;spark plug
no fouling&quot; adapter from local parts store designed to keep
plug OK in an oiling cylinder, the adapter is male thread one
side, female on the other, grind off the male, drill a hole
wherever (remember beyond the merger of the exhaust from each
cylinder bank on a VW or before it if you want to tune each
bank individually with 2 sensors) drill a hole and weld/braze
her in.  Buy a generic heated (3 wire) sensor, around $30 even
if you get a good deal, screw her in, appply 12V to heating leads
look at the output with said meter, .45V is stoich, lower volts lean,
higher means rich, two sensors are great for dual carbs.  Whole
thing even if you buy a voltmeter should be less than $50.  Of course
if you really must have a little LED display I can probably look
in some old Radio electronics and find an article about building
a little in line LED Voltmeter display for under $15.  BTW full
instructions should be at lap.umd_dot_edu in the vw_archives directory
under ExhaustAnalyzer, ftp as anonymous login and you should be
good, if anyone wants I will email you the full instructions if
you don't have ftp capability.  Oh if you put 2 in close enough
to the heads you probably don't even need the self heating style,
you need it only if you are putting them far down line after the
merger, check local speed shops for the bungs and plugs to replace
the sensor if you don't want to leave it in, or if you only want
to buy 1 sensor and tune 2 banks individually.  Thread is hypothetically
18 x 0.5 mm but don't hold me to that.
