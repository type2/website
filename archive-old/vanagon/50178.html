&gt;I just changed  my coolant after checking out the archives first.  One
&gt;thing that was mentioned  was that the radiator bleeder valve looks like
&gt;a brake bleeder.  My bleeder is nothing more than an 8mm bolt (maybe
&gt;tapered).  Is this right? 

Yours sounds like the ones that I've seen.  I've never seen one that looks
like a brake bleeder.  You can bleed yours without removing the bolt all the
way though.  I usually unscrew mine til it has a couple of threads left in
the radiator.  The thought of dropping the bolt down inside the front of the
van while bleeding the coolant isn't very pleasant.

Good luck,
