&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a line on a 1978 bus with a 1974 SUPER BEETLE engine (???!!!). Does
&gt; &gt; &gt; this raise any hackles? Also the bus is possibly in need of some carb 
&gt; 
&gt;   I can't imagine why anyone would want to do that -- having the upright
&gt; fan, etc, makes it very difficult to even get the engine in and out in
&gt; the first place. The older bus w/TYPE I engines had a removeable rear
&gt; panel so you could just slide the engine out. 

No argument here.
&gt; 						Anyway, I bought a '69 new
&gt; and ran it for 10 years or so, and did an awful lot of rebuilding. That's
&gt; why VW went to the 914 engine -- the old 1500-1600 engine is just a hopped
&gt; up 40hp (1200) and the case, et al, are not up to the stress of pushing
&gt; a van around. 

I think that the type I engine is fine for a bus, as long as you aren't
in a hurry.
&gt;		The 914 case, etc, is much stronger, and the oil cooler
&gt; problem is better resolved (not blocking #3 cyl, and has a filter).

The case is stronger, yes, but cooling seems to be a major problem.  With
the type I, adding a doghouse shroud will solve it's cooling problem.
Having a filter is nice, but the success of the type I engine has proven
that it can do just fine without a filter if you change the oil regularly.

&gt; Also the engine I'm rebuilding currently for my '73 is growing
&gt; from the stock 1700cc to 2000cc -- I think that's what you need for the
&gt; weight and aerodynamics of a brick, although the 17-1800 engines are
&gt; simply much more powerful than even my Type I with a big bore kit, 3/4
&gt; race cam, and roller-bearing crankshaft.

You can do an awful lot to a type I to make it more powerful without
sacrificing reliability.  I have a hard time believing that my 1800cc
type IV motor is better than those ever could be.

&gt;   Go ahead, buy that bus if it's really cheap, but I wouldn't pay any
&gt; more than what I would pay for the same year non-running. Less, in fact,
&gt; if he butchered any stock body parts on the install. Then pull the
&gt; 1600 and put in the right engine. Maybe you can sell the bug engine to
&gt; someone, buy a 914 at a junkyard and rebuild it.

I'm not advocating swapping type I engines into 72 and later busses, but
if someone else has already done it, great!  I'd throw some dual-port
heads, a doghouse shroud and some decent carbs on that puppy and enjoy it!
I myself am growing weary of type IV motor problems.
