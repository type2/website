]2. I don't mean to start another oil discussion, but I'm moving to Texas
](hhhhhhhooooooooootttttttttttttt!!!!!!) and want to change the oil to match
]the climate.  Can anyone down south suggest a viscousity???

Where in Tejas are you moving?  We're not really hot down here; we're
just storing heat for use next winter.   :-)

Castrol GTX in 20w-50 seems to be quite popular for air-cooled engines
here, and is what I always ran in my air-cooled buses (and now run in my
Suzuki).  Since I now have a Vanagon wasserboxer I now use 10w-40 in that.
