Subject: RE: Schematic Programmable Delay Circuit

Folks, we've been there, done that. Check the archives at:
http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg02539&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.01

It explains the idea and gives the part number for a replacement wiper
relay from VW that will give your Vanagon programable delay wipers. $35
bucks or so, unless you dig one out the local junkyard. The you just
replace the current relay with the new one.  Many other VW/Audi products
have this feature: you can too!

Good luck, 

Tom F.
