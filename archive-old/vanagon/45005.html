Subject: Re: Well oh ya?

I haven't heard that before.  If that is the case, why is the red line on
the wasserboxer tach all the way up to 6000rpm?  (or thereabouts, I just
know that it goes well beyond 4000).

I did know that the red line on the ac is 4400 rpm, however.

&gt;Excedding those marks for short intervals not a problem.  In all oppsed
&gt;engines, exceeding 4000 rpm for any lenghth of time will heat up the oil and
&gt;pound out the main bearings.  This pounding even happens to Waterboxers.
