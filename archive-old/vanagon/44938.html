Subject: T4 to T1 book

     I'm interested in that book that is offered in Hot VW ad that tells 
     how to convert a T4 to T1. Can't recall the exact name but usually 
     advertised for $29.95 plus shipping, out of NY I think.
     
     Anyone have this book who has decided not to do it and wants to sell 
     it? Let me know at email below.
     
     Thanks,
     Jeff
