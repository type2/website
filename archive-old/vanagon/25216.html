&gt; Related to the recent survey on bike racks, I'm wondering if
&gt; anyone is or has used a rack on the FRONT of their vans--more
&gt; specifically, on the front of one of the newer vanagons with
&gt; the black front bumper w/molded plastic valence underneath.
&gt; 
&gt; (2) a rack on the back of the van means that the bike gets incredibly
&gt; dusty on dirt roads, 
Dusty on the back, bugs/road grime on the front

&gt; (3) you still have to take the bike and rack off
&gt; the van in order to get into back.
&gt; 

I have one of the strap on type bike racks.  I tried it on the front but
the wind resitance caused the bikes to beat together.  My wife was NOT
ammused to have the paint on her brand new TREK ruined.

I transfered the rack to the back.  I attached the rack to the door (Like
as if it were the trunk of a car).  The door opens fine.  Well, it
requires a lot more effort to lift now.  My struts on the door are shot
anyway.  I have a vise grip for one strut, and the other was removed and I
insert a piece of wood.  So I can open the hatch, but I remove the bikes
if I am stopped for the night any place where I would have the hatch open.

Just my 2 phennings worth
