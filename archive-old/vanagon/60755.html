Subject: Naval Jelly on your exhaust? Was: Questions about Naval Jelly
Date: Sat, 31 May 97 22:24:33 EDT


&gt; Firstly, from what I understand, naval jelly chemically bonds to iron oxide
&gt; creating a shell which prevents further rusting. Am I correct on this, or is
&gt; it a very nice dream?

Naval Jelly contains phosphoric acid, which converts the &quot;red&quot; rust
to a more stable iron oxide. Naval Jelly needs to be washed off,
and the surface needs to be primed and painted.

There are phosphoric acid based products which leave a primer like
polymer coating. for a summary see:

&gt; Socondly, If I am correct correct above, how does the new formed material
&gt; react to extreme heat?  Is naval jellying your exhaust crossovers a good idea?
&gt; Outside only or inside and out?

I tried naval jellying the rusty parts of my exhaust, wash and then
paint it all with high temp aluminum paint. The paint still sticks
fine to the non-rusty parts, but has fallen off the rusty patches,
and new rust has developed after just one winter.

Best bet (as always) make sure the rust don't get there in the first
place. Once its rusty it will only take more time to fix (and
last shorter)
