&gt;Judging from the tone of some six recent posts on the subject,
&gt;I take it that I am not the only 95-96 EV owner
&gt;who would like to add some stripes or decal to the
&gt;all-white exterior look.

check the local car dealers. you know, the ones that add stripes to a brand
new car and charge you $89 on the sticker!!! :)  anyway, find out who they
get to come out and put the stripes on ... it's usually an independent
contractor from some tint shop or gold-&quot;plating&quot; accessory place. then check
with them directly for a price. the dealrs pay only about $25 for the labor
and materials to do a normal-size car ... and i would think a flat-sided van
would be a heck of a lot easier to stripe than a contoured car. :)
