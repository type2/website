Subject: replace heater hose 83.5 

Hello--

Thanks Gerry, Chris, &amp; Ron for all the work on keeping the list (and
therefore my Vanagon) up and running.

I need to replace a worn heater hose from cylinder number 1 on my 83.5. (It
was dragging on the axle for a time thanks to the DPO's &quot;mechanic&quot; who
replaced the engine.) And I have a few questions.

Do I have to drain the entire cooling system? I assume the answer is yes.
Then, my question is what's the best way to drain the system and refill it.
And I assume I use 50/50 mix of the phosphate-free anti-freeze and water. Is
distilled water recommended?

I remember coming across a detailed explaination of draining and replacing
the coolant on the net, but I can't find it now. I thought it was at
Vanagon_dot_com. (Incidentally thanks Ron. I've been hanging out at Vanagon_dot_com.
while the list was down. Of course now I think I can't live without a CB) but
I didn't find it there.  

PROBLEM TWO: A hose (maybe 1&quot; or so) on the back of the engine which seems to
be from the water pump (maybe to a coolant tank? I can't remember right now)
seemed to have been worn slightly by the A/C fan belt. The belt doesn't seem
to be currently contacting the hose. But it looks like this is a trouble spot
because there is little clearance between the belt and hose. Is there a
preventative measure, or a way to assure the belt won't rub through the hose?

Just to make it interesting I'm heading from NYC to Wyoming in a week in my
Westy. Anyone want to lay odds on making it there and back? It's my first
trip in my new rig. 

(In my first 2 months of ownership: Installed rebuilt transmission from Kyle
_at_vwmotorsports. Exhaust completely removed and re-installed to correct a
cross-threaded manifold-to-head bolt that slipped. New 02 sensor of course.
Hours adjusting the timing. Replaced all the vacuum hoses. New CD player
[JUST fits]. New cup holders. Remounted fuel injectors. New sink pump. New
wiper blades [OK. Now I'm really milking it.] Couldn't have done it without
the list and vanagon_dot_com. Thank you. Thank you!)

As always, any info is greatly appreciated.
