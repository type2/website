Do these springs improve the performance (i.e. stiffer ride) as well as
lower???  I am very interested if that's the case!

Having driven a 82 Vanagon with these springs and comparing to my 80
Vanagon with regular springs, I didn't notice that the ride was
&quot;stiffer&quot;.  But the handling/steering is a more responsive and the
vehicle feels more maneuverable.  We've tried used springs that were
cut/heated to even get it lower but the steering got real &quot;squirrelly&quot;. 
In discussion with the German mfr, I brought up having them drop further
than the standard 45mm, but they said the same thing happened to them and
decided to just stay with the factory standard drop.  The last thing they
wanted were liability problems (and so did we).

Highly recommend using Gas Shocks, it do make a difference.

We originally brought these in for Westy Owners that wanted to get their
camper in the garage.  But we're seeing a cross section of Vanagon people
buying them as well now.
