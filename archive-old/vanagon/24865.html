Subject: Filthy Hippie Swine...



In the September 7, 1995 issue of the San Diego Reader (a weekly, 
'alternative news' type of paper) there appeared an article titled,

&quot;Do you ever get called Filthy Hippie Swine, driving around in that death 
trap?&quot;  by Patrick Daugherty.

Its a pretty interesting and entertaining look at VW vans and those who 
drive 'em. The highlight of the piece is a 'trip report' (in list lingo) of 
the author's, about obtaining a new tranny for his '71 Westy in a small 
border town in Texas, including three days spent with a drunken ex-Nazi 
(really) ex-VW mechanic, trying to get the guy to stay focused long enough 
to complete a transmission swap. This is truly great stuff. I'll try to 
contact the paper to see if they'll agree to posting the article on this 
list.
