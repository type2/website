&gt;Also seen outside the show (Moscone Ctr), was a white EV MV (non poptop)
&gt;with all sorts of nastiness to spread about VW, for example:
&gt;On the back window:  &quot;My VW Mistake&quot;
&gt;then in smaller print something about plastic bumpers, hidden repairs not
&gt;disclosed, side mounted gas tanks, blah, blah, blah....
&gt;Did you know that VW stood for &quot;be Very Wary of (Volkswagen)&quot;?
&gt;Wow!  I learn something new every day!
&gt;
&gt;I was just wondering why, if this guy/gal had such a bone to pick, didn't
&gt;s/he just ditch the thing and get something else (like the dreaded Chrysler
&gt;products)?
&gt;
I'vw seen this guy's work before.  He's plastered vicious (and very
repititious) anti VW messages all over the Road &amp; Track and Car &amp; Driver
forums in AOL's.  When describing this list all the Vanagon owner's I've
&quot;met&quot; in those forums, I've been very explicit in telling them not to let
this guy know about it.  I figure he'd be blasting his anti-VW crap all over
until he was kicked off the list.  Knowing his work, he'd be back on the list
over &amp; over with new screen names.  It seem that a significant portion of his
life is spent in this hateful anti-VW campaign.
