Subject: Hydraulic Clutch

    Ramona's orig. clutch was replaced with a hydraulic clutch some years ago
by the previous owner. What are the advantages and disadvantages to the
hydraulic?? How do I check it for wear? They cannot be adjusted, I
understand, so replacing them is the only was to get around a potential
problem? And how does it affect my impending engine-swap? Should I ponder a
new clutch (non-hydraulic)??? I dunno, but I'm sure ya'll do.....   ; )
    Thanks again!!     
Rach &amp; Ramona
