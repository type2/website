&gt; Also, I'd like to quiz fellow diesel owners on their personal cold start and
&gt; driving habits.  The '86 Golf I just got is not very fond of starting in
&gt; near freezing weather we've been having of late.  I wait for the glowplug
&gt; light to go out, I use the cold start lever (which is in fact hooked to the
&gt; injector pump). 

This is probably not your problem.  I once had problems starting the
Vanagon (diesel) in 15 degree F weather.  I finally noticed where it says
in the owner's manual &quot;at outside temperatures below freezing -- depress
accelerator pedal while cranking and release pedal slowly as engine begins
to run.&quot;  I did that and continued to run the starter 30 seconds or so
until the engine fires on all four.  I used the cold start lever and let
the glow plugs go until the light went out.  This procedure really made a 
difference.

&gt; Excluding this morning (with 4&quot; of wet snow all over) the
&gt; routine has been like this:  It catches instantly, running on probably 1-1/2
&gt; cylinders.  If I gently bring the revs up to around 1100
&gt;  for a few seconds and the drop back down I'm up to 3 cylinders and I can
&gt; actually make out instruments on the dash ;) .  After about 20 seconds total
&gt; time it's clattering away on all fours. 

Mine does this when I have a bad glow plug.
