=======================END OF INSTRUCTIONS=========================

This list is dedicated to the discussion of Volkswagen Vanagons,
Eurovans, Buses, Kombis, Syncros and Campers or any other brick-shaped VWs.

As a curiosity and a service to the electronic community,
Joel Walker (jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu) is compiling a list of where the bricks
are electronically and geographically.  If you have not already done so,
and you don't mind that being public information, please send him an e-mail
with make and model and location.

The vanagon mailing list has proven to be quite busy.  Since it
really isn't University business, I try to minimize my time running the
list.  To that end, if mail to you bounces several times, I may without
telling you, remove your name from the list.  At that point, your best
course of action is to send mail to gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu explaining
your e-mail situation so I can add you as an alias.

The list is archived, and there is some FAQ information available.  
The archives can be retrieved via listserv commands, or the archives and the
FAQ information can be retrieved using gopher to 
halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:/Miscellaneous/Vanagon 
or ftp to lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:/pub/halfdan/vanagon

Lastly, some brief netiquette specific to this list.
Fridays are a day when people do fun things on the list.  These things may
actually not be VW related, but I strongly encourage it.  To indicate that a
posting is in fun and may not  be of technical value, you should preface or
suffix your subject with /f [f] or (F). Anyone without a sense of humor 
should delete these messages without reading them.

Please refrain from profanity or &quot;pushing other's buttons on the list.  We
try very hard to get along.  Censorship will be enacted for those unable to
control themselves.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Welcome to the list!
