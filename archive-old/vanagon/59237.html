&lt;&lt;  My top is solid.  I don't understand 
 the argument about it not being strong enough since Westfalia 
 essentially does the same conversion that was done on mine.... In fact, 
 the ridges in the roof are set up for the opening to be cut. 
  &gt;&gt;

the &quot;break&quot; in that one ridge in the roof stamping is there for the sunroof
vans. Don't really know why it's there tho, since V-gon Westy's and sunroof
vans have 2 completely different roof sections put on at Hannover....
