Same thing happened to me.  I got a '79 parts bus and stripped the engine, FI, 
tranaxle plus other choice items and the pawned it off on a guy who wanted the 
furniture in it (It was a Westy that had T boned a pickup). I got the engine 
somewhat stripped and found that a) it used the vanagon aircooled heads (very 
different exhaust mainifold flange from the type 4 heads that I had been running 
with up to then) and b) a very worn out cam.  
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Compression was good though. 

 I have a spare '73 set of heater boxes (Not for sale so don't ask) that the '79 
boxes closely resemble.  The '79 boxes are rotten but the cores look good.  The 
'73 boxes are marginal.  I am going to try to strip the skins off the the '73 
boxes and put them on the '79 cores.  Failing that I may have to get creative.  
Up here in Canada heat is a must.  Another fallback position is to weld the '79 
exhaust flanges on to a heater bax set out 
of a '75 that I also have (also not for sale so don't ask). The '75 exhaust 
piping is somewhat weird so I would have to jig the whole thing too while 
welding and drag it to a shop.  

Let us kow if you find a source for the heater box skins or replacemnet boxes 
for your '79.

&gt; Well VW friends, it looks like VW has done it again.  It appears that the 
&gt; heater boxes for the 1979 Transporter are one year only.  They are no 
&gt; longer available new (Why would somebody make replacements for a part 
&gt; that was only produced for eleven months??).  They resemble the '72-74 
&gt; boxes and can be modified to fit the '79.
&gt; 
&gt; However...
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know if the muffler connections on the earlier heater boxes
&gt; will match up with a 1979 exhaust system?  If they don't I may have to 
&gt; replace both heater boxes and switch to the older muffler.   This would put
&gt; me way over budget ('72-74' heater boxes run about $225.00 a piece, not
&gt; including the time and effort involved in modifications).  
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow..
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody have a used driver side heater box for a 1979 BUS (or aleast 
&gt; know where to find one).  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks....
