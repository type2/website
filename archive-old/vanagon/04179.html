&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, if you want something KOOL, then I would rather put up with a lack
&gt; &gt; &gt; of cooling power, than the hassle of lighting the fridge. It just doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to light until my thumb is good and bloody! EVERY TIME!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have any maintenance tips besides vacuming the spider webs?

&gt; &gt; I thought my 'falia was the only one that takes two hours and
&gt; &gt; 1,672 clicks of the ignitor button to start the fridge on propane!
&gt; &gt; Guess not.  The stove burners ignite right away.

&gt; 
&gt; My best fix to date for this is to clean out the spider webs etc. if
&gt; you have them and bite-the-bullet and buy the VW cover for the flue
&gt; vent.  They are, unfortunately, overpriced as Hell ($18.00) and they
&gt; fall apart after about a years use, but they really keep the problem
&gt; from reoccuring.  I've tried to find a Tupperware or Rubbermaid 
&gt; shallow bowl that would be a good substitute, but I haven't been able
&gt; to get a good match.  I think VW researched this one real good so that
&gt; there is no bowl in the entire world that has the same dimensions.
&gt; And, of course, the material for theirs is designed to self-destruct
&gt; every year. :(
&gt; 

the things people will do to waste a perfectly good degree in chemical 
engineering.
