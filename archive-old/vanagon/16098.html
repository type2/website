Subject: Re: Rust prevention...

have heard good things about crown, but haven't actually used the stuff
myself. i am not sure if crown is available in usa as well. btw anybody
have any thoughts on waxoyl (sp?) and it's success in stopping rust? is
there anything in the archives on this thread? Has this topic already been
beat to death? What is the &quot;ultimate&quot; rust preventative (aside from
obviously not rusting the car in the first place)

btw what are you cleaning and painting the bottom of your van with?

&gt;I've been checking around locally and the only rust prevention stuff
&gt;available and suitable for injection into frame heads etc is by a company
&gt;called Crown.
