Subject: Re:Wouldn't start... mea culpa!

What the heck *is* the final word on jump starting AFC busses?  The
manuals always say &quot;don't EVER jumpstart&quot; (I imagine positive or
negative spikes from the donor-car might fry your ECU) but on the other
hand, I've always gotten away with it. (Those VW automatics *do* have at
least one drawback...).

What's the collective wisdom - has anybody ever fried their brain doing
this?

 I had a 73 Westy with a 77 2 litre motor with AFC.   Yes, I did get jump
starts.  It didn't fry the brain,  but eventually I did have to replace both
the dual relay and the air box.    They were expensive then, and I'm sure
more now.    There was no direct correlation,   but those warnings led me to
believe some connection was there.  But after I replaced the alternator  it
always started up.
