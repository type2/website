&gt; Since silicone is not hygroscopic your chances of collecting moisture are
&gt; slight.  I've been running silicone in my 65 bus for about seven years.

A couple of questions, Bob, first how well did you flush the
old DOT3 stuff before adding the silicone as VW claims tales
of extreme woe and corrosion to those who use DOT5.  Some claim one
should rebuild the entire system washing every part in DOT5 then
replacing all the rubber seals, and some even claim the rubber
seals might leak if the rubber is incorrectly formulated, since
you obviously had none of these problems, what precautions did
you take?  I have never truly believed this stuff as dad related
how the National Gaurd unit he was in changed entirely to silicone
in the 80's and simply flushed out the DOT3 as much as would bleed
out then filled with silicone, bled about a pint from each cylinder
and went on their merry ways, he was in charge of the motor pool
at the time and they performed this on all their vehicles from
jeeps to 50 ton dumps (they were an engineering outfit).  I think this
is what they did but they may have flushed with alcohol first. But the
thing that has always stopped me from doing it is that I also
read something from the VW gods that claimed the load sensitive
pressure regulator would not perform correctly on DOT5 as it had
a different density or was less or more compressible or something
like that.  Have you had any difficulty along those lines?, or does
that '65 even have a regulator since it's all drum? I would hate
to put in the DOT5 only to take a spin and lock up the rears
uncontrolably.
