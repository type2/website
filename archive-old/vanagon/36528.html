Subject: MexiVW Pix - Finally!

Hi Volks

I finally scanned my best VW pix from Mexico, and uploaded them
to the Volkswebbin' site.  Where I put them is:

	ftp://ftp.oroad_dot_com/incoming/vwpics

The pictures are:

	mexbug.gif	New white VW Sedan (about 40,000 New Pesos)
	mexeng.gif	Engine from my rented VW Sedan, looks alot like
			my 36hp with emissions control.
	mexbus.gif	New white VW Combi (about 105,000 New Pesos)
			Now you can all see what the &quot;black box&quot; on the
			front (radiator grille) looks like.  These new
			Combis are nice 'n' quiet!

Today, one U.S. Dollar will buy you about 7.5 New Pesos, which makes a
new Bug under $5,400 and a Combi about $14,000.

	Enjoy

		Jay

(Clara, Joe, and Dieter - thanks for your patience!)
