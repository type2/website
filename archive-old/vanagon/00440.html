Subject: Sweeter &quot;tunes&quot; for the Vanagon
Date: Wed, 20 Apr 94 12:34:35 EDT

Hello,

Now my Vanagon is running better I'm interested in making some other
improvements.  Unlike the other two I've owned, the '87 I have now came with
a pretty nice looking &quot;VW Design&quot; radio/tape player combination.  Is it any
good?  The stock speakers in Vanagons are so lousy it hard to tell !  I
don't like the front panel design with all the little buttons either,
cuz I can't see 'em conviently when driving (forget it at night, then it's 
completely touchy-feely &amp; as luck will have it).

Anyway, I'm not interested in an amplifier and all that, just better quality 
speakers. Could new speakers possibly be as large as 6x9, fit the depth of 
the door and still remain flush with the front so the window crank handle 
passes by smoothly (no jammed fingers for me)?

I'm real interested in hearing what others of you did to get better sound
and what brand names you recommend.

Thanks,

Dick
