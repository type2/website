Harmon,
I have a similar problem.  My problem is in 1st.
They tell me that it might be bushings in the shift linkage, the clutch
thrust bearing, or the slave cylinder.  A while back, I bled the hydralic
lines to the clutch which solved my problems for a while.  I now have a
rebuilt slave cylinder also.  However, I still have problems with shifting.
My guess is this: try bleeding your lines and double clutching for a while.
It might get better with warm temps, or it might not.  If it does not,
it sounds like it is going to be expensive and inside the transmission.
Stuart
