 Matt,

 I'd like to help, but I'm still confused as to what is not fitting. Is it
 the manifold not matching up with the head studs or the manifold not reaching
 the collector &lt;transverse&gt; pipe. If the latter, be suspicious of an
 aftermarket catalytic converter that is not the same length as the original.

 If you loosen up some more of the exhaust system connection so that things
 are more &quot;flexible&quot; you might be able to get the bolts started and then
 tighten things up in a sequence to distribute the &quot;mis-fit&quot; through-out
 the exhaust system. Exhaust systems never seem to be precise.

 If it is the manifold not matching the head studs, the first thing I would
 check is that you are not mixing parts between  &quot;round&quot; and &quot;square&quot;
 exhaust port designs. An '81 should have &quot;square&quot; ports, the head/manifold
 seal being made with a flat gasket. &quot;Round&quot; ports make the seal up inside
 the port a ways and use an oval copper ring.

 Good Luck!

 Dave
