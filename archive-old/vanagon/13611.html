&gt; &gt;It seems that one of my elecromagnetic cut-off jets is not working. Muir says
&gt; &gt;they are a waste of time and can be replaced by a screw in jet.
&gt; 
&gt; They were put in to prevent 'dieselling on' when the carbon crud in your 
&gt; cylinders keeps igniting the gas (thus spinning the engine) that would get 
&gt; sucked through otherwise. Put a screw in first, shouldn't affect anything, 
&gt; just use a short one with a seal/gasket/silicone goo. Then by cut-offs if 
&gt; needed. 

I tried the screw thing, and it acted just like the solenoid wasn't working
(i.e. it ran like crap).  I would just buy a new replacement solenoid. 
They are about $20 new over here.
