Subject: Re: Carat dash clock source?

&gt;My newly-purchased '91 Carat has a digital dash clock, which is fine,
&gt;but which is set to the wrong time, which is less fine.  Unfortunately,
&gt;the two little buttons on either side of it do nothing. 
&gt;
&gt;Alternatively, has anyone observed and fixed this problem before?

&gt;

The digital clock in my '91 counts seconds from 01:00 to 01:59 and then
back to 01:00.  Wouldn't even be good for timing a boiled egg.  I have
repeatedly tried to reset it but so far have been unsuccessful.  If you
figure out a fix or find an affordable replacement please let me know.
