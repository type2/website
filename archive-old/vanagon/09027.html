&gt; &gt;specifically where you were?)  Anyway, being in Sac, I've been toying
&gt; &gt;with the idea of somehow rigging in the A/C ducting from a Vanagon bus
&gt; &gt;into my '91 camper so that I can get cool A/C to the front!  Is that
&gt; 
&gt; i saw, in one of the german books, some a/c ducting that ran down the sides
&gt; of the bus roof ... you might be about to get hold of the front overhead
&gt; console (for 86 and later buses) and fit some plastic pipe down the sides
&gt; to the back a/c unit. i have no idea how you'd get the rear single a/c to
&gt; blow down boths sides, thought.

Well, I was thinking vacuum cleaner hose(s) running up the middle of the
ceiling with tie downs to hold it up temporarily.  Real fancy huh?  The 
connecting it to the a/c unit would be trick.  Maybe some specially molded
plastic to fit a couble of the vent holes?
