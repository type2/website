Subject: Re: VW FLAPS in Portland, OR?

&gt;Hiya all,
&gt;     Anyone know of a VW FLAPS in Portland? I need some VW specific parts,
&gt;also a VW friendly junkyard would be good. TIA...
&gt;Peace,
&gt;Eddie
&gt;
&gt;One other thought. I don't know if you are going through Redding(or have
gone through already)but Bus Boys is just North of town ,Very acessable from I5.
