Subject: Re: Those of us in the Midlands

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, hell.  I don't know about anybody else, but I'm
&gt;&gt; &gt; feeling left out, what with West Coast gatherings and
&gt;&gt; &gt; East Coast gatherings and all.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Seriously envious...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe in the spring (Nov.-March being out for most of
&gt;&gt; &gt; us in the Heartland) the rest of us might want to give
&gt;&gt; &gt; a gathering a whirl?  Yes anybody?  Wisconsin, Minnesota,
&gt;&gt; &gt; So. Dakota, and, yes, even parts of Iowa have some very
&gt;&gt; &gt; pretty state parks.  In my part of the world y'all could
&gt;&gt; &gt; even go see the real bridges of Madison County!
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thoughts?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a lot of fun.  My wife would enjoy seeing the bridges --
&gt;&gt; even though she thought the guy in the book was a real jerk. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I went to school in Iowa (Iowa Wesleyan in Mt. Pleasant) and it would be fun
&gt;&gt; to have a reason to visit again. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Doesn't this conflict to some degree with the plans for the big trip?
&gt;&gt; I can't spend my entire spring driving to meet with VW people.  I have a 
&gt;&gt; life!

Count me in.  I too have been envious of the west-coasters and their trip
planning.  If my 67 Samba has sold by the spring I definately will have a
bus to camp in as a replacement.
