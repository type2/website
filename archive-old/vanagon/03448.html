&gt; According to Anthony, they didn't start making

&gt; there were only about 5 years of splits (63-67)
&gt; that could have been a walkthrough.
&gt; 
&gt; Of our 1300 in our database, about 30% of them
&gt; are walkthroughs.

I guess I'll add that my bus is a walkthrough.  I normally get in the 
side door just because it's easier.
