Subject: Intermittent Stutter

Hi all. Got a new problem to me. As I puttered home in the awesome snow
vehicle, my 86 Westy syncro, if you can't get through it, sleep in it, the
engine began to sputter, emit clouds of balck smoke and lose power. I got
to the top of the hill, pulled into a parking lot and as I stopped, the
idle went up to ~ 1100 from ~ 900 and the engine seeemed healthly. I,
trusting in Seigfried, drove on. About 3 miles and one more hill, it
started again. Same symptoms.  I kept going, as I needed to license my
dogs, no clipboarders for me, and the sputter and smoke stopped. He starts
fine and runs fine with those two exceptions. I soaked the idel selenoid a
while back and that cured a very high idle. Is it possible that the idle
selenoid is now going south? Any thoughts folks. BTW, Dennis H, more
thorough directions coming soon!! TIA
