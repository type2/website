&gt;Well... the socket set that Harbor Freight had for $46 is noe $39.99.  If 
&gt;you by another $10.01 in stuff you don't pay the shipping.
&gt;I have this set and I think it's well worth the $40 if you do a lot of 
&gt;hobby car work.  it has a 17&quot; ratchet, 18&quot; sliding T-bar, 4&quot; and 8&quot; 
&gt;extensions, 16 12pt sockets, and a case.
&gt;
&gt;
I have this set as well.  I only have a few bolts/nuts large enough to use it
on but at the price I couldn't pass it up.  I added another item to my order
and got free shipping too.
