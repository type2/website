Subject: cylinder head temp sensor hole stripped

Arrrrrrgghhhh!  A 15 minute job gone horribly bad...

Well, I was experiencing some intermittent engine stalls from my '76 
camper (4800 miles on rebuild), and a friend suggested replacing the 
cyl. head temp sensor.

So I got the old one out ok, but it looks like I stripped the hole 
when I was putting the new one in.  Can't be sure yet, ran out of 
daylight today, but I'm afraid for the worst.

I'm wondering what remedies are available without pulling the head 
off the engine.   Is there something I can put in the hole that will 
both hold the sensor and allow it to work properly?   I hope so.

Thanks in advance,

David
