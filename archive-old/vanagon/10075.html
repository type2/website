&gt;&gt;Regarding Chrysler:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; But hey, they invented the
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing, they can reinvent it, too.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;No, they didn't -- VW did, back in the '50s    8-).
&gt;
&gt;Not exactly.  The steering wheel doesn't come straight up through your
&gt;knees on the Chrysler or the Honda; you don't have to hunch over to
&gt;shift gears; your arms aren't spread out wider than your chest when
&gt;you make a turn; you don't have to move the pedals at an arc opposite
&gt;the normal travel of your feet; the suspension has more travel than
&gt;the seat springs....
&gt;
