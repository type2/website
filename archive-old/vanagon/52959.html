Subject: syncro Golfs?

I know this doesn't concern Vanagons and the like, but knowing syncro
Vanagons are a common subject, someone on this list might have an answer
for me.  I live in a snowy climate (Fairbanks, AK) and I'm wondering if
syncro Golfs were ever sold in Canada or the U.S.  When I was in Toronto,
I spied a couple syncro Passats, but no Golfs.  My second question is, if
syncro Golfs were ever sold in Canada, is it possible to make one of these
legal for registration in the U.S.?  I dont want to break down and buy a
common old Subaru-- I'm a Volkswagen nut.  Please let me know, and thanks
in advance.

	Ron Bertram
