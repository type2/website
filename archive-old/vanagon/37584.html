&gt;From Vdubdude_at_aol_dot_com Thu Mar 14 09:35:13 1996:

&gt;It costs $450.00 to do a 5000 headliner while the
&gt;same shop charges $150.00 for a Volvo.  The headliner is GLUED in to the roof
&gt;with rabbit style carpet glue!

The late 80s Audi 100 (i guess you call it 4000) had a 0.50 mm sheet-steel roof.
The headliner is part of the body structure (to put it like that). Audi had a
special tool kit for removing and installing the headliner, it included an electric
paintstripping gun, you can't pry between roof and headliner. Without the headliner
the roof would hang lower, like a Mercedes Pagode-roof. These Audi's will not pas
their annual vehicle inspection here in the Netherlands without the headliner.

Brian.
