I think what y'all are talking about is a Fridolin.  Gurus: correct me if 
I'm wrong.

&gt; A friend of mine had a really cool VW.  It was a phone repair vehicle from
&gt; Germany.  Basically it was a bus on a bug chassis.  Someone had converted
&gt; it into a camper, but most of the original interior was intact.  It had
&gt; beautifully made wood cabinets for tools and the like and a collapsable
&gt; front passenger seat so there was more interior room when needed.  The
&gt; front end looked like an oversized Bug with a big wrap around windshield. 
&gt; There was a gas heater up front, under the hood, near the gas tank and
&gt; spare tire.   We figured it was from the mid sixties based on the running
&gt; gear.  It had Bus type sliding doors on both sides and these extended from
&gt; the front seats back.  You folded back the front seats to get into the rear
&gt; compartment.  The doors locked open so you could drive with them that way. 
&gt;  I've never seen one of these around since... Anyone else?

&gt; These were very common when I was in Germany in 71-73, but I've never seen one
&gt; in the US.  Somewhat similar to Grumman postal vans in US now, but smaller.
&gt; The other vehicle I coveted that never came to the US was the 4-speed 412
&gt; station wagon.  In my eyes a contender for prettiest VW ever, but only the
&gt; automatics came to the US.  THAT would be a great Porsche six conversion.

&gt; Strange, that...I'm from old Chairmanie and I've seen plenty of phone
&gt; repair vehicles, but never one of those.  Then again, that probably
&gt; doesn't mean squat, since there are many other things that exist and
&gt; I've never seen.  Such ramblings...is it Friday yet, unca Joel?
