Subject:      propane tank re-certification

Hello all,

A few questions about the propane tank on my poop brown 86 Westi.

#1: In Canada do you have to get the tank re-certified after 10 years like
you do for a propane BBQ tank?, What can you do but replace it if Mr.
Propane dealer doesn't want to fill your tank because he can't read the
date of tank(and gets nervous thinking he's going to blow you up).

#2: Dumb Question of the week candidate here:  How long is your stove
supposed to run for if the propane is turned off(both burners on high)?

mine doesn't seem to quit, but the fridge will not stay on with the propane
turned off.

Thanks

Tony Mysyk
