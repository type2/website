Hi,

Would anyone know a source for mud flaps? I found a pair in the West Coast
Metric catalog for about $35, but they seem to be for the rear wheels
only. I would need at least one for the front/right to protect the propane
tank that sits right under the sliding door. 

It looks at if there once used to be a mud flap behind the
front/right wheel: a metal piece that could have been part of a mud flap is
still there.  Sami ('75 Westy)
