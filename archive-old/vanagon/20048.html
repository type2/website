&gt;Just realized this morning that the Space Shuttle is the Vanagon of space-
&gt;craft: no aerodynamics to speak of, chipped brick styling, big door in
&gt;the middle, engine in the rear, needs rocket assist on a hard uphill
&gt;climb.

actually, vw advertised the vanagon as such .... they had a very simple
ad, showing a vanagon (about 1982 or so) with all the doors and hatches open,
no background, no people, and simple caption at the bottom: &quot;Space Shuttle&quot;.
