&gt; I know there has been a lot of discussion on the list about tires for a
&gt; Syncro, sorry for the possibly redundant posting.
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased my 86 Syncro with 2 matching tires on the front and 2 brand new
&gt; matching tires on the rear.  All are 185 75 R14's.   I'm a broke student and
&gt; don't have the money for all 4 but I can afford to replace the front 2.
&gt;  Then all four should match almost exactly, with the exception of about 3000
&gt; miles on the rear tires.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I get by replacing the front 2 for the time being and do the rear tires
&gt; in about a month, or will that stress my VC????
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have to have the exact same tread wear on all 4 or do they just need to
&gt; be the same size.   If they do need to be exactly the same then I'll have to
&gt; trash the two perfectly good rear tires.
&gt; 
&gt; Respond to me directly, I'm frequently bounced off the list due to server
&gt; problems.

Good point there, since i can trash one or two wheels a month, its 
rather expensive to change all four wheels at the same time! I have 
driven with brand new tires amongst slightly weared ones, and I dont 
know how this affect the viscous coupling. When I ask my local VW 
dealer, they say its &quot;no good&quot; but cant tell any closer. Isnt the VC 
there for to take out some mismatch in the driveline?
