Subject: sliding door cover plate-baywindows

Above the sliding rails for the side door on the baywindows is a 
cover plate.  It's held in place by two screws.  My question is, 
after these 2 screws are off, how do you remove this plate?
There is one on the opposite side of the bus, too.

Thanks, 
Paul
