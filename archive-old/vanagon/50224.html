&gt; My '84 GL came with two tire/pressure recommendations.  Indeed, the light
&gt; truck tire recommendation has the 48 psi (rear) specification that you
&gt; referred to.  However, VW also recommended the reinforced passenger tire
&gt; with an inflation pressure of 40 psi.
&gt; 
&gt; My Vanagon came with Michelin light truck tires and I was never very happy
&gt; about the handling.  I replaced the original Michelin with Bridgstone light
&gt; truck tires and the handling got worse.  So, I tried Michelin reinforced
&gt; tires (at the recommended 40 psi), and things got much better.
&gt; 
&gt; My specific complaints about the light truck tires were road noise, rough
&gt; ride, and most importantly, skidding on wet pavement.
&gt; 
&gt; Subjectively, I feel that the reinforced tires are more precise in handling
&gt; as well.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From reading this list, it seems that the reinforced tires are hard to
&gt; find.  However, I like them so much better, that I will spend the time to
&gt; find them when the time comes.

Hey,

I got Michelin reinforced on my 86GL.  I question the 40lb rating when
VW asked for 48lb.  I had the same problem on my old 70 Bus, the tires
say one PSI and  VW says a higher PSI.

I went with the VW PSI  after figuring  the tire PSI  is based on a
heavier load.

Am I gonna blow out?
