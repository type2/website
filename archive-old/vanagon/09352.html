Subject: 71 westy update

I want to thank all those who responded to my post(ADVICE NEEDED).

I went to take a better look at the bus today, the despite 22 degrees f cold.
The ## is:2312267322
and the motor is uo428360.

This is sorta strange, because this is a T3 case, acoording to Muir.
I crawled around and got real cold, couldn't find and rust underneath, but 
the doors have rust on the bottom.

I also got inside and poped the camper, it goes straight up in the air.

I want to apoligize for calling a Westy a campmobile, camper etc..

Thanks all, I'll keep you posted.
