Hi Don,

&gt; Hi all.  As I'm hoping to go on a short camping trip this weekend, I was 
&gt; wondering if my '80 westy originally came with screens on the sliding side 
&gt; windows.  If so, how did they attach (inside or outside) and does anyone 
&gt; know of a source for new ones?  

Yes, it should have come with a single sliding window in the door and one 
behind the stove.  I know of no source for them outside of the dealer, 
sorry.  Maybe someone else can help you there.

BTW, when you finally do find one, if the screen is gone use a hot melt 
glue gun to attach new fiberglass netting.  Works fine.
