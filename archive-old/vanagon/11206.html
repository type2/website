Subject: extracting an impacted battery

We recently had to replace the main battery on our '81 Camper (under the
front passenger side seat; not the one for camping accessories which is
under the driver's seat) but upon trying to remove it, we found that the
dumb previous owner, who we refer to as &quot;boy blunder&quot; forced a ginormous
battery into the shelf, probably by jumping up and down on it.  It was
almost impossible to remove it and alas, there was no handle.  Alice and I
managed to carefully pry it out with the all purpose screwdriver after
tearing up our fingers and producing a variety of expletives.  Is there an
easier way?  We may still have to deal with the camping battery some day,
and since it is an even tighter squeeze due to the close quarters of seat
in front and cabinet behind, I'm not looking forward to that day.
