coincidence? happenstance? well, Jay Leno is a big car nut ... but i don't
know if he has any vw buses. or maybe he is really one of you Lurkers out
there!!!

anyway, on Monday nights' Tonight Show on NBC, in the Headlines skit, some
school menu was shown, and it went something like this:

Monday - Spam
Tuesday - Grilled Spam with Nachos
Wednesday - Spam Nuggets
Thursday - Baked Spam
Friday - Spamburgers with cheese

where the heck was it? i don't know ... Hormel High School?? :)
