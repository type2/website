&lt;&lt; My wife was coming home from a long trip, when she started to have
problems
 getting the van into gear.  I found that with the clutch pedal to the floor
 it would grind into reverse.  With the clutch pedal to the floor you could
 shift into 1st-4th, but it would grap within the first inch of pedal
 movement.  The fellow who works on my van has looked at this problem before
 and said the &quot;shift guides&quot; are worn.  The problem went away, but now is
 back.  Any help would be appreciated. Van has 140K on it.

Sounds like the clutch is not releasing.  Could be a hydraulic or pressure
plate problem.
