   It has 150,000 miles on it but mechanically it's not too bad.
 I put new heads, and pistons in it 5,000 ago. I fixed everything
 I could think of before taking it all over the west this summer.
 The oil pressure is a little low and so is the power. Rear seal
 is leaking and flywheel needs to be resurfaced. It has a new clutch,
 brakes, cables, tie rod, and good tires. It needs new ball joints
 installed I have the parts. I've planned on splitting the case and
 checking the crank. I just finished rebuilding
 my Baja motor and grinding crank, new cam, surfacing flywheel and
 bearings was about $160.
 It's not a camper and it's in Portland, Or. I will be there about
 Sept 7
