&gt;Hi--checked the archive without much luck---Kinda overwhelming.
&gt;
&gt;I do remember someone saying that a Freon replacement was coming out that
&gt;would not necessitate the replacement of the system in the car.  That it
&gt;could just be put in after the Freon was removed.  We have a friend with a
&gt;New Yorker and they want $750+ to convert her car over to the new &quot;Earth
&gt;Friendly&quot; stuff and she just can't afford it.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has any info on the replacement refrigerants that does not require
&gt;mechanical modifications please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for the help.

I would just pay for the repairs with R-12.  New yorker probably needs entire
hose assmbly.  Then Freon charge would be good for 2 or 3 years.  Charging
system should only cost about $100.  Does not use much Freon.
