Subject: Kalypso-drain plug, power loss, oil light, exhaust crack, etc.

Hello All

I'm sorry I haven't written to update anyone on Kalypso (my '87 Westy)
since the drain plug fiasco at New Year's, but I had a host of other
problems (mentioned in the subject line--exhaust crack is the exhaust pipe
that broke apart, not anything to do with drugs).
I'm hoping to type in the details and solutions to my VW problems by this
weekend.
I'm also hoping to set down the story of the engine fire epic from 1989
with HAL, my old '76 Camper, by this weekend too (it's almost comical now.
As you can imagine, it was not comical at ALL then, 800 miles from home.)

Peace,
Dave

PS--Boy this list has gotten big. Remember when it was 40 people strong,
and we thought that was great?
