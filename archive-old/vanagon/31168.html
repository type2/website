Subject: Bad Short '73 Bus

Not a short bus, a bus short.  This is on a friend's '73 bus.  The 
symptoms are that the battery will go dead if it sits for 24 hours 
without running.  The battery was replaced.  No improvement.  We then 
did the Muir fuse thing where you pull out fuses one at a time until 
you don't get the spark when you install the ground cable.  We 
narrowed it down to the number two fuse.  This fuse controls the park 
and tail lights and the license plate light.  We replaced one bad 
bulb and cleaned up one other to get it to work.  Still a spark.  We 
pulled out the headlight switch and ran the volt meter over it.  None 
of them show any power except the big hot wire coming into the thing. 
We also checked the emergency flasher switch, which is on another 
fuse, just to be sure.

So, we are stuck.  This is where we kindly ask you fine folks if you 
have seen this problem before and what was the fix?  Standing at the 
ready, multimeter in hand....
