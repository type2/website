Subject:      Coolant warning light trouble

Hello listees!

I have a problem with the coolant level warning light. Sometimes it goes on
flashing for a very long time (5 minutes or so) after the engine is started
and running. Eventually it stops, and I don't have any trouble with the
actual coolant level. I've replaced the sensor, the one with the two
plastic covered metal prongs, with a used one that was thoroughly cleaned
before installation. Problem is still there. Strange thing is that when I
pull the connector on the sensor and turn on the ignition, the light
flashes for a short time and then stops. The same thing happens if I pull
the &quot;black box&quot; that is supposed to control the system (#3 on the relay
board). My repair book doesn't cover this system at all, just tells it is
there.

Hoping for someone to share experience on this matter,
