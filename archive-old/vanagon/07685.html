&gt;Yes, but these executables have to be RUN in order to infect a machine,
&gt;right?  I think this is where the confusion is.  Just downloading
&gt;something through e-mail (and not running it) is an unlikely way to
&gt;&quot;contract&quot; a computer virus.

This sounds to me like a DOS thing.  You should always scan stuff with
your favorite viral software before you run anything you get off BBS's and
the net anyway.
