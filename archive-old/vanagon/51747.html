Subject: unfortunately unsubscribing

Hey eeverbody-
   I've only subscribed for a couple of months.  Unfortunately, in this
time I've been forced to sell my ailing Vanagon.  Thank you for all the
helpful info and communication.  
   Also...I've been trying to unsubscribe to this list, and I haven't
been very successful.  I know the proper command, but somehow I don't seem
to have the list name exactly correct.  Could someone please help me out?
Thanks very much...
                       JAT
