Subject: '88 Vanagon GL FS, Joel change the stats!

     
     Yipppeee!
     
     Well, I found one! I just contracted to purchase an '82 Westy with a 
     somewhat tired (possible cracked block) diesel engine. This is the van 
     I have been wanting for a few years now. Unfortunately, I will not be 
     able to keep my '88 and the '82. So, I must bid the trusty '88 
     farewell. :(
     
     Basic info:
     The van is a 1988 GL, 7-passenger model. The color is red, I think 
     they called it Titan Red. The interior is a silver/grey cloth material 
     on the seats and grey carpet on the floor. It has the manual 4-sp 
     trans and A/C. It has 118K miles and to the best of my knowledge, the 
     heads have never needed servicivng ( must be one of the few good ones 
     VW made!). I bought it about a year ago from the original owner, and 
     have all sorts of maintenance records. The A/C compressor is a bit 
     noisier than I would like, but it has been working just fine. The 
     water pump and part of the exhaust system have been replaced. I have 
     replaced the battery, rebuilt the trans (Was difficult to shift 
     between 3rd&amp; 4th...turns out to be a cracked 3rd/4th syncro hub) , 
     replaced the clutch and throwout bearing (pressure plate was reused) 
     and installed new rear hatch struts.  It runs flawlessy and looks 
     extremely clean.
     
     I live about 5 miles north of Washington,DC. If you need an 
     independent opinion, maybe we could talk a fellow listie, Tom Forhan 
     to voice his thoughts. Tom F. lives only five minutes from my house. 
     (Tom, I tried to e-mail you about this...but you are still in 
     bounce-mode...)
     
     
     If anybody on the list is interested, please feel free to contact me. 
     Following is the text that will appear in this Sunday's Washington 
     (DC) Post. I am able to deliver it within a reasonable area. Also, I 
     am willing to sell it for $4000.00 to a list-member...just to know it 
     will be at a good home!
