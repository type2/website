Subject: Rust around rear window on 90 Vanagon
Date: Mon, 17 Feb 1997 09:52:36 -0700

Anyone had the rear window out?  How hard is it?  I've got rust (God,
please, tell me it's not so) weeping down about the center of bottom
window frame area.  I can flex up the rubber seal and see the damage.
How to suggestions appreciated!
