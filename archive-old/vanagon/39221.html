Subject: Product Review - Proglass Polishing Kit

Last issue of Split Screen Scene (SSVC club mag, UK) carried a new feature on
product reviews. Our intrepid tester tried the Proglass polishing Kit and The
Windscreen repair Kit; both are US products imported here by the Eastwood
Company..and freely given to our impartial tester.
The polishing kit consists of polishing compound (dry) and a hard felt mop
mounted on  spindle plus instructions. You are told to mix to a slurry..but
george (our tester) now thinks that his idea and the Americans idea of slurry
must be different..as first time it just ran off the windows! Using the mop on
a slow speed drill worked OK as long as the drill was not at right angles to
the glass. The big problem was washing off the remaining compound - a bit like
washing a paintbrush full of emulsion paint - no matter how much water you use
it still takes forever!
Best advice is not to do it in situ but when glass is out and thus job can be
done in a tray of some kind..this works well..in situ its messy but works
okay.
Testers verdict - messy but it does work but only for surface haze and ultra
fine scratches. Glass does sparkle nicely after and fine scratching
disappears. At 28 ponds sterling (42 dollars) its pricey and vinegar and elbow
grease do almost as good a job!
Also tested was the windscreen repair kit..this involved poor George seeing
his windsreen chips turn to cracks! frantic phone calls to Head Office in US
revealed if you live in sunny CA its probably OK as you have to leave the
resin to harden in the sun...this is England remember! The instructions are
also confusing as they are in colloquial American (?!). George's advice here -
 get another piece of glass and forget this product.
Thanks to George Bedwell, Intrepid SSVC tester and technical advisor. I'm off
to clean me van windies with vinegar and elbow grease!
