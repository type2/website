Subject:       Re: VW bus safety (was: back from the dead)

&gt; Also, I spend a LOT of time in the junkyards (as you all well know) and
&gt; I don't think I have ever seen a bus that was smashed in so badly in
&gt; the front that the occupants would have died.  I must confess that I did
&gt; see one where the driver probably would have had both legs amputated,
&gt; but that was just one out of hundreds of wrecked busses, many that
&gt; were front end collisions.

I have an aquaintance that got in a head-on in a '60 Panelbus.  It 
smashed the whole front in.  He made it out with two broken legs, and 
lots of lacerations.  The bus didn't survive! :) 

After I lost the brakes on my '67 I am a &gt;&gt;LOT&lt;&lt; more conscience of 
my surroundings, particularly stopping distances!  :)
