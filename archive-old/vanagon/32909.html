Subject: Re: Adjusting Pertronix Ignitor Dwell ('79 Bus)


&gt; With the Pertronix unit installed, the dwell meter reads a constant 59
&gt; degrees. I think that I want about 47 degrees or so.  The engine runs 
fine,
&gt; except that it idles at about 1200 RPM.  I've tried adjusting the &quot;air 
gap&quot;
&gt; between the ignition module and the magnetic rotor, in and out, with no
&gt; change in dwell.

If it works, don't &quot;fix&quot; it!
