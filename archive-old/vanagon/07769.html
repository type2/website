Subject: Re: more clutch troubles

	John,
		If the sound started as soon as you depressed the clutch, 
then I would say that it was safe to suspect the throwout bearing, but if 
only when engaging 1'st and 2'nd, then it could be something else.
	However, if it is the bearing, it could last quite some time 
before going.  My Mustang had a bad bearing yet I drove it for four years 
without any problems.  That included much street racing and other 
detrimental activities.  
	Anyway, we need more info.
