Subject: Re: Vanagon Diesel --&gt; Gas [long]



I have a copy of that article too...it inspired me to add the cooling duct
to the alternator. I got the plastic housing that goes on to the backof
the alternator from an Audi 5000, it fits with just a little struggle. I
led all-aluminum tubing from the alternator along to the bottom of the
right hand air intake. I really don't have any proof that it helps the
alternator, but it makes me feel better knowing that it is drawing cooler
air than what is found in the vanagon engine compartment, (esp. in the
summer).
I think it is a worthwhile addition to any vanagon, if you can find the
housing for $5.
