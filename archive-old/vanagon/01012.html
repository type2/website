well ... you don't. buy you (David) have been counted. actually, if you are
on the vanagon mailing list, and have told me what you drive, you're already
counted. there are only a few people (lurkers? :) who haven't told me what
their ride is ... and several people who are still looking for a bus/vanagon.
i admit that there are some 'bugs' in the stat progs, but i'm semi-thinking-
about-the-possibility of working on them. i.e., what do i do about you guys
and gals that have multiple buses? if i count them as being 'on' the list,
then my list-count doesn't match Gerry's. so right now, they are 'counted'
in the model year breakdown, but not in the list count.
