&gt; For type IV engines and air-cooled vanagons, VDO sells an adapter plate
&gt; for the &quot;oil drain&quot; plug. Part # 240 827, listed at $33. This is not the
&gt; part BusBoy Jim referred to in an earlier post; I saw the part he referred
&gt; to as being only for all *other* air-cooled engines (bug, pre-71 bus, type
&gt; 3). (Jim, correct me if I'm wrong.)

This plate is no longer being made by VDO.  My friend at Vee Parts said
they were forced to stop making it (by Porsche, since it is the same as
the plate used on the 914).
