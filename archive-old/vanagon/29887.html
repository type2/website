I have 4 used cv joints I parted out from my old bus that check out fine (no
blue balls, no pitting in the ball grooves or cracks in the cage).  The sad
part is that I went through the trouble of storing them intact in four bags
and after a recent move I noticed the joints are no longer assembled and I
didn't mark anything (Dohhh!!).  This means I have no idea of the original
orientation of the cage (not to mention ball placement).  If I use these as
spares, how radically have I reduced their life by changing the wear pattern
and disturbing the balance orientation??  Guesses?  Commiseration?  If I
just kept my balls in their cage....
