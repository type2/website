Subject: i realy like the people in this list

if somebody starts a eurovan mailing list, please let me know.

i'm afraid that there is too much traffic on this list for me.

it's NOT a boreing list, in fact i am enjoying reading the messages here.

it's just that it takes more time than i realy feel comfortable spending 
to read all the messages. 

and being as how i realy hate to just delete a few hundred messages
without reading them (mainly because they all [or almost all] seem to be
writen by quite interesting and inteligent people) i will just turn my
access to the group off. 

so reluctantly, i withdraw from this mailing list. i have found it to be 
very informative, and the best thing i liked about it is that the people 
here are fun.

joel, your doing a great job. thanks for the microfiche.

youre all great people here and i have realy loved the chit,chat atmosphere.

some people might say that the reason that there is too much traffic is 
the chatiness of everyone and the tendancy to stray from strict &quot;VW ONLY&quot; 
messages, but i would say that the rambling &quot;coffee clutch&quot; feeling of 
this group is one of the things i like best about it.

i have looked forward to each time that i have had time to sit and read 
the contributions that people have to make to this fine conversation that 
we have going here.

and now, only because i fell respect for the people here, and because i 
care what you think of me, i will offer a short explination of why i am 
in a situation where i don't have time for this group.

my wife has malignant melanoma, and this will be her last new years 
celebration.

she will soon begin an experimental type of chemothrapy, only 3 people 
have been treated in this way before. it seems that there is an %80 
chance that because of the drugs involved she will be very very ill for the 
remainder of the time she has left without any real benifit being gained 
through the use of the drugs, other than the fact that medical 
information will be gathered that may help treat others in the future.

in any case, she will be very ill and i will be careing for her.

th treatments will not begin till after the new year, so she will be in 
good health till then. so this time is very valuable to us.

it may seem a little morbid to say this, but we are trying to keep out 
humor about us, but by this time next year i may have alot of free time 
on my hands and can rejoin the group here, if you'll have me.

ray
