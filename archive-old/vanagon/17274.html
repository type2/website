Subject: Re: Vanagon Trials and Tribulations


&gt;
&gt;This Vanagon has 138,123 miles (I just checked). At 127,??? miles it died
&gt;over in St. Loius while caravaning along with the Busses by the Arch crew
&gt;last Labor Day weekend. Stranded in St. Louis, I left it with a local VW guy
&gt;who rebuilt the motor from the ground up and hitched a ride back with local
&gt;CIVF friends, Tom, Anne &amp; Kent Meinert. The VW g said the heads looked fine.
&gt;New cam, crank bearings, lifters, exhaust valves, water pump, oil pump,
&gt;gasket kit. Also replaced the front bearings while he was at it. All said
&gt;and done, it cost me $1500 parts and labor, plus a one way ticket from Indy
&gt;to St Louis ($50).
&gt;
&gt;What's a boy to do?


Go after that mechanic, 10K miles on a 'total rebuild' and it's leaking is 
way too soon. You are at less than 12mos/12K miles. If your parts were VW 
brand then you should trry to get some 'parts warranty' deal. From other 
discussions it sounds like VWoA would even consider partially paying for the 
refix if so.
