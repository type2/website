Subject: re:  taking care of pop tops


I redid my poptop with a product available at Camping World (and I assume
other places) called Kool Seal Elastomeric Roof Coating.  It's designed
for RVs, where the surface is likely to expand and contract often.  

In my case, I also had to repair some damage (a crack), which I did
with another product made by the same company, called, I think, Kool Patch.
I used this and fiberglass-type mesh, layering and criss-crossing it over
the area perhaps 4 or 5 times.

Kool Seal costs about $25 per gallon, and I needed just over 1/2 of that
to do the top (it's also available in quarts, btw).  I've heard that other
companies make this product, so the key word here is elastomeric, which
testifies to its strength/expandability/contractability.

The product is water based, dries quickly, and washes up easily.  It is
while, but could perhaps be tinted.  It's not a shiny surface, but rather
more like a flat, thick laytex.  I'm quite happy with the result, mainly 
because it was so easy, and relatively inexpensive, compared to having to
have the thing re-gel-coated.  

Someone else on our list (can't remember whom, but you could check the
gopher archives) redid theirs with a product more closely approximating
the gelcoat finish.  They maintained that their mileage actually improved by
mabye 2 mpg afterwards, since the surface was so slick and shiny.
