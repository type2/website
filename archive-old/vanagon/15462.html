Now, now Thom, if your data is to be reliable we would also need to know
how many junked busses you have seen that don't have GEX engines. Only then
could we determine if your &quot;sample&quot; is representative of the population.
Still we could never be too sure if the busses were junked because of
engine failure. David C.
