In regard to the lawyer's letter....just because your friend received a
letter regarding the comments made, does not in and of itself mean
that the garage has an action against your friend. There is one
maxim regarding libel/slander....&quot;truth is a defense&quot;. So if
your friend's comments were true, then if push came to
shove (he does not cease and desist) and the issue went to
a court of law, he would be able to defend on that basis.
