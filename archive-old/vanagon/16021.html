Subject: Re: Synchro Tranny leak

Hi Drew,  please post Schneiders reply/$, my seals oozing slightly, no drops 
yet.  Any other tips you can glean from him would be appreciated, especially 
what kind of failures are occuring in the trans. His Porsche engine should 
be finding all the weak spots, one after the other.  tim s.
