&gt; They say the brakes need work.  And that VW says &quot;thou shalt not machine
&gt; rotors or drums&quot; and they'd have to be replaced.  Material cost for rotors,
&gt; drums, pads and shoes: $600.  Labor: 4 hours front, 4.5 hours rear.
&gt; 
&gt; My guru says that this is a bit much.  What says the group?
&gt; 
  How about &quot;thou shalt not machine rotors or drums&quot; and just change the pads.
  Were you having trouble with a pulsating brake pedal? Changing pads should
  be $60 - $80 for parts and about 1/2 hour labor on each end.



  The eternal cheapskate,
