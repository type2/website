Subject: Re: Gauges Again (was: warr/heads/gasket/oil leaks)

I have 4 gauges mounted horizontally in line on my dash, to the right
of the plastic piece housing the speedometer, clock, etc.  The gauges
are all in a box, which sits on the dash directly, but is angled to
my line of site.  It is atop the space that previously housed the
ashtray.  In order, they are:  voltmeter, oil pressure, oil temperature,
and cylinder head temperature  (left to right). 

Another option for those of you with good eyesight would be to get an
additional speedometer/clock plastic housing at your local junkyard (or
dealer, depending on your pocketbook), and mount them all in that, on the
right side (or even the middle) of the dash.  I kinda wish I had done
this, so that I could now mount two hella fans in the middle, but
in the meantime, the sending wires would have to be replaced, as they've
since been cut to fit the position they are presently in.  

The box that houses my gauges is fabric-covered to match my car seat
upholstery - velour, of course  :)
