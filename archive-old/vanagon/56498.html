Subject: Re: Daytime Running Lights-91 Carat

&gt;I am looking for information on how to install the daytime running lights as 
&gt;shown in the Vanagon Bentley manual on pages 97.241-97.243. My local dealer 

try the little rocker switch on the left, works fine day or night, at worst
you'll leave the side lights on sometime.  More seriously, would this work? 

?? - Since headlight power is only available when key is on, pull out the
rocker switch and wire the marker lights 'out' lead to the 'in' lead for the
headlights. This should switch the side lights on in the usual manner via
same wiring. No relays, draws current from high amp headlight section.  If
you wanted headlights on too, jumper across the back of the rocker switch
for them. Stalk would still do the hi/lo bit.

 The rocker switch would still work for leaving the side lights on when
parked, but would leave headlights on if you had both set for daytime run.
This could be avoided by bridging to the side light 'out' lead via a diode
that would block the back flow from sides to headlights.  Cheap/small
enough.  Only problem I can see is if you do have both side and headlights
on during day is that they will draw all their current from the headlight
wire/fuse (until you press the switch 1st click).  

bye, tim
