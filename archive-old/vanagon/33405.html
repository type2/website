The changeover will certainly be an effort, but you won't need alot of work 
on the heater (it was 70 degrees last week).
I had a '73 that was converted for speed (carbs, 009, etc.) before I 
acquired the beast. After looking into &quot;buying off&quot; the inspection stations, 
I hit the junk yards (politically incorrect for garden of previously owned 
parts) and found all I needed was the right carb and air cleaner setup, 
original dist. and some misc. hoses. Found parts easily (this was 4 years 
ago) and ended up selling the thing with a note of legal responsibility that 
it was for off-road use only; it is the SELLERS duty to provide a smog 
certificate when selling (that is, if they plan on driving the 7 passenger 
bus on the street). Also, some inspection stations won't even look at 
air-cooled for inspection (this I've found with my '73 convertible).
It can be done, and I do believe you get some sort of grace period to handle 
the smog stuff. Dump the Cutlass; if you're going to smog-up our state, do 
it in a little style (and bring some old volksie parts with you). Have a 
safe trip.
