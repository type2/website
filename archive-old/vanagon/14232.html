So Dave Kautz says:
&gt; 
&gt;   I'll give it a try, my '72 had piston slap in a big way. It basically sounds
&gt;   like a dull knock. It occurs at half speed, like tappet noise because the
&gt;   knock is triggered by the cylinder firing, not the piston movement. Thus,
&gt;   the sound is heard when the engine is under load rather than at idle  and
&gt;   it is heard loudest when the engine is cold and the piston to cylinder
&gt;   clearance is greatest. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Lots of VW engines in good condition, especially wasserboxers and type IVs
&gt;   have some piston slap when they are stone cold. When Steve Johnson pulled
&gt;   out of our shared campsite at Red Rock I heard an excellent sample of 

So, your eavesdropping on my piston slap eh? ;)  Well I hear louder than
normal slapping in the morning occasionally and then as I drive off
it goes away.  I've been told that it's normal.
