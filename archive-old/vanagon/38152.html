I suggest you convert to carbs. That way, the value of the vans of those of us
who still have FI will skyrocket;-)

&gt;&gt; I am sure this has been discussed before but... I have a 75 SB F.I.
&gt;&gt; that I bought and am fixing up. It has 58000 miles. It has not run
&gt;&gt; since I had it. it turns over, has spark and is getting gas. I jumped
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Re: Fix F.I. or convert?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well I have gone through this exact problem myself.  Well not EXACT but
&gt;similar.  My case was a little more severe.  The car had not run in 10
&gt;years and by the look of the parts that came with the car they had
&gt;experienced problems with the FI system too.  Local VW people suggested
&gt;converting to carb. but the deciding factor was when I priced a new fuel
&gt;pump at $200.  Everything that I have read decribes FI in 1975 as not
&gt;perfect.  I am not critizing their engineers, after all it was the first
&gt;year for FI and they were well ahead of most other manufacturers.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway I now have 2 1975 VW beetles and both have carbs.  Only one runs
&gt;but that should change soon.  Why don't you price the different parts
&gt;you may need for your car and see if that doesn't help your decision.
&gt;Good luck!
