&gt; I need to redirect this question - I asked about what type of lubricant

You should know better, Jack.

&gt; 
&gt; One more time folks - what kind of lube works best to quiet the sliding 
&gt; door? One thought of rubber wheels was interesting, but I don't think 
&gt; anyone has made that work - have they? 
&gt; 

I have found that cleaning all of the old hard grease from all of the
tracks, esp. the bottom one which collects alot of grit, and lightly
greasing and oiling them helps alot. Well it helps the door slide, but it
still makes a racket. I also have played with the adjustments on the top
and bottom sliders to see if I could get them &quot;bearing&quot; differently, but
well, not much difference. However, check the bottom track , near the
front of the door, just where it makes its little dive inside. Is the
paint worn away? Does the door hang-up a bit there? Could need some
adjustment up.

Alistair, who will not pee in the sink!
