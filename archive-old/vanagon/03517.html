Subject: Computer Graphics/Lee Griffiths?

Got a msg from Lori Gelato mentioning that a Lee Griffiths may have bus
graphics or can point me in the right direction.  Lee, are you out there?

If you have graphics and wouldn't mind E-mailing me, please do.  But send to,

kwiebe_at_pipeline_dot_com

Not this AOL address.

thx/ken
