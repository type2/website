Subject: My rear wheel ...

Dear vanagon gang,
Yesterday, I found that I had not tightened the rear wheel nut enough on
my vanagon.  I have corrected this particular problem, but I need to ask,
what will happen from this?  I have only driven it about 2000 miles or so
since that, but I am kind-of concerned that maybe I got excessive wear
on my wheel bearings.   Can anyone out there give me an idea of what I might
hear in the initial stages of a rear wheel bearing going bad?

Also, if you happen to do your cv joints, be sure that you are positive the
snap rings holding cv joints to the axels are on good.  I found that one
of mine had come off yesterday.

Stuart Hutton
