&gt; Hah!  Same here.  I had a nice looking Pioneer digital auto-reverse deck in
&gt; the dash.  Biggest piece of junk I have ever owned.  Stopped working one
&gt; day and I was just too lazy to take it out.  The person who stole my van
&gt; was nice enough not to break any windows, but did destroy my steering
&gt; column and rip holes in my paneling to get the 6&quot; Craig speakers out. 
&gt; Go figure.  I go the stealth route now.  Stereo is in the glove box,
&gt; box speakers behind the seats.  Haven't had a problem since!

Ah Ha!   But now we all know where it all is!  :&gt;  just kidding!

When my 85 was parked a block from my old apartment, someone smashed the 
right front wing window to get in and get my tool box.  When I came out 
the sliding door was unlocked and there was glass all over the seat but 
appeartantly my locked 95lb. tool box was to heavy for the SOB so I 
didn't lose anything except the $80 to replace the glass.

Another time, when parked in an alley, some a%&amp;hole, smashed the sliding 
window for no apperant reason at all, all the doors were still locked and 
there was nothing worth taking... don't you just hate some people?
