Subject: '55 Barndoor and '48Scooter FS

They &quot;aint&quot; mine! &lt;rats!&gt;

I promised two acquaintences that I'd post their vehicles as FS. I am
relaying the info as it was presented to me. I have *no* involvement in
either of these deals out side of uploading the posts. I have not seen the
scooter and have only seen the barn in a quick walk by. I didnt bother to
look at it as I am big time broke...
