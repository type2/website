So Edmund A. Hintz says:
&gt; 
&gt;         I don't know about &quot;not reliable&quot;. Seems to me that a car is only
&gt; as unreliable as the work that's been put into it. Don't do anything but
&gt; half-fixes to a car for 20 years, and it will become very unreliable. If
&gt; you want to buy a vehicle which will be reliable from the get-go, you will
&gt; have a hard time finding a older bus which will suit your needs. They are

I strongly agree with this sentiment.  I get sick of hearing people laugh
about how they always see VWs on the side of the road.  Well gee, I wonder
why?  Of course you don't see other older cars on the side of the road
because they couldn't even make it that far.  They all went through the
crusher already.  Thanks to VWs philosophy of building a car that most
anyone can take care of, plus the robust mechanics, the VW has outlived
any other off-the-rack production car of it's class and age.  

Other people complain about the heater not working.  &quot;What a piece of
junk.&quot;  Hah!  Show me any other 20 - 30 year old car that doesn't have
problems.  Hell, show me a 10 year old car that doesn't.  Most VWs
went through Hell by there owners because they couldn't afford to or
didn't bother to take care of them. 

Nice post Ed.
