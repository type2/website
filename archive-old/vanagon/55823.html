I would think something like reflective flags strung from CB antennas help
with keeping people looking up in the air and allow you to spot convey
members farther ahead both day and night). We used to use glowsticks and/or
reflective tape for conveying at night. The glowsticks worked best but would
be utterly impractical for such a long trip...
