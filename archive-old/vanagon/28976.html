&gt; Don't worry about this too much.  Baby oil is best but keep lot's of 
&gt; Desitin around to stop the really loud noises.  I'm told that Gold Bond 
&gt; powder is also useful for quieting these noises.  The lubrication 
&gt; schedule for newborns is pretty light actualy, after about 3 months 
&gt; you'll start getting lot's of demands and rude noises.

If lubrication is necessary, baby oil is appropriate. Most younger 
babies, however, are self-lubricating. If you notice a decline in 
lubrication check the drool valve for foreign objects.

yes, GOOD LUCK. Babies are more fun than old buses and more work! Our
oldest is 5 (then 3, then 1). I sure hope they all love to camp, canoe,
and fish, but mostly, I'm hoping they'll be good parts scouters.
