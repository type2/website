Rudy,
Depending on the set-up the horn section in the steering wheel is
removable. Remove it and then try an emory board or finger nail file,it
may give you the access to clean the contacts. 
Clean not file down.
Hope this helps.

&gt; Hi all. I was trying to fix a problem with the horn on my van and found the
&gt; wire connector near the floor on the steering wheel shaft corroded,
&gt; replaced it and still no fix. Next I checked the connections in the
&gt; steering wheel and found that the connection inside the s/wheel was not
&gt; making good contact. So the problem is I can't get to the contacts within
&gt; the steering wheel. Does anybody have any suggestions
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Rudy B. Santa Rosa, CA
