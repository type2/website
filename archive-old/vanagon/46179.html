&gt; what I'm going to try next.  None of them will start, I'm starting to get
&gt; sick of it.  Why must I drive a front engined, front wheel drive, water
&gt; cooled Audi to work every day?  Someone out there has to remind me why I
&gt; am doing this.  Has anyone out there been on the brink of throwing in the
&gt; towel and had a revelation at the last moment?  My friends think I'm nuts

&gt; lose it.

Hello Erik.

They can be frustrating :&gt;) However, they are one of the most basic autos 
around!

Remember the book *ZEN and the art of motorcycle repair* (i think thats 
right). Maybe that can give you some insight!

I have people look at my '61 T2 and ask *why?* I ask, *why not!* I can work on 
it; make it run. Tha's what you need to do.

I'm going to assume you have the *IDIOTS* book :&gt;) If not, run, don't walk, 
and get one. Read it from C to C. Read it again. Then get the engine one ONE 
of your units running. When you bring life back into one of these things, your 
hooked. 

Have fun.

Douglas
