&gt;&gt; The antenna on my 86 vanagon broke off; the local VW people said that I 
needed
&gt;&gt; to replace the entire unit.  Well I have the antenna unit but I's stuck in
&gt;&gt; terms of the installation.  It seems that the antenna has to be installed 
from
&gt;&gt; the inside.  That is, push the antenna through the hole from the inside and
&gt;&gt; then install the gasket and locking nut from the outside.  However, I 
can't see
&gt;&gt; how to disassemble the dash plastic to install it from the inside.  If anyone
&gt;&gt; could provides some assistance, I would be most grateful.  Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;NO! STOP!!!
&gt;Don't try to disassemble the dash!  They're not quite possible to put 
&gt;back together right.
&gt;If you take the plastic out from around the steering column... You ought 
&gt;to be able to trace the ant. wire from the back of the radio(Take out the 
&gt;ashtray) to the ant.


YES, I remember this procedure, it was relatively painless, in my '85 panel. 
I didn't use the through the radiator/headlight area approach, so it looks 
like antennae instalation varies. I don't know if my installation was 
factory/dealer or aftermarket. Don't take out the dash, (and don't remove 
the radio unless really desperate or you have hands the size of Godzillas). 
I've removed it to oil the defroster fan, it takes a full day of cursing.  
The comments about a good ground should be heeded BTW.   tim s.
