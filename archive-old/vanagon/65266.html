Subject:      Re: EV chassis

I know VW sold an EV chassis for conversion, although they were not popul=
ar
in the states.  Country Homes Campers, which recently went out of busines=
s,
made a camper from an EV chassis and was selling them until very recently=
=2E =

They were on a short chassis, not the extended version used by Winnebago.=
