&gt; While there was agreement to meet at Ron Salmon's outpost Sunday at
&gt; 1PM, but I remember hearing somewhere (Type 2 Chat Group?) that Ron is
&gt; not going to be there. Ron, can you confirm, yes or no? 

No, I can't go, very much to my disappointment.  I'm a solid week behind in
responding to e-mailed price quote requests, and really need the long
weekend to catch up.  (I am sending orders out on time, though - if you're
lucky enough to get a price quote! :)  If you need a quote fast, by the
way, better to call me for now, at (610) 754-VWVW.

I will be set up at Maple Grove, though, on June 8 (practically in my
backyard) and would LOVE to volunteer as the List meeting place for that
show; it would give me a chance to meet some of you who are only faceless
e-mail addresses to me at this point.  I will either have my blue '89 Westy
at my swapmeet spot, or my spray-can painted/primered/multi-colored '63
Deluxe, and I will have the Bus Depot sign up. I'm planning on getting
there early, so I hope to be fairly close to the main gate.  For those of
you relatively close to southeastern/central Pa., the Maple Grove show is a
fantastic show, getting very close to the size of the Manassas show and
with a great swap meet area.  Maple Grove, Manassas, and (I'm told)
Litchfield, CT are the largest east-coast VW shows of the season.
