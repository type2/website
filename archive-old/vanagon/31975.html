Subject: Re: &quot;Foreign&quot; Engines in VWs

&gt;I've never owned a wasserboxer, or an air-cooled type-4 engine either,
&gt;but I'll throw in my $.02 (after inflation-- watch out) as the owner of

and a well spent $0.02, good note. I too have had many buses and still 
consider the engine upgrading to be just that, it doesn't take away from MY 
idea of a bus.  Nor does my set of American brake rotors, sparkplugs, belts, 
Japanese tires, Italian disc pads, Canadian muffler and battery.....  They 
just keep it all working how I want it to!
