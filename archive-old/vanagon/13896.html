We had/have a similar problem on a Renault. Eventually if the rust is bad
enough the windshield itself will begin to crack and deface from the car
(as happened with us).
The best and only solution is to replace the windshield and depending on
the rust remove and patch the area (welding) or surface sand the area and
paint while the screen is out. But consider this: for $50 dollars deductible
you can have a new
windshield put in and while it is out do the rust work yourself. We had to
take the R5 to an autoglass shop because the windshield is &quot;bonded&quot; to the
body
of the car (the VW may not be); but I was still able to remove the rubber
mold and chrome strip and remove the offending areas with a grinder. If
the windshield is not bonded then you can probably replace it yourself.
 It is a two person job though as to remove the screen requires a solid
push with both (four?) feet.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  If the bus body is leaking under the windshield &lt;rust&gt;, is it worth putting
&gt; &gt; &gt;  a kilobuck or more into the engine?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had (have) the same leak situation, but I love the bus and even put 2 
&gt; &gt; kilobucks in the engine.

&gt; I too, have this under-window rust problem.  Would anyone care to point 
&gt; me to the 'easy fix'?&gt;
