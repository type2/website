&gt; air flow regulator) that i put on backwards in the dark. duh! it has an arrow
&gt; pointing towards the engine. so thursday when i crawled under the van i looked
&gt; at the hose again and saw this was on backwards. brakes are back and working
&gt; great!

By having the vacuum flow regulator backwards you ran the risk of
having gasoline enter and even fill the brake vacuum assist unit.
That will ruin the irreplacebale diaphragm.  That happened to us when
the vacuum flow regulator froze in the open position. It let gasoline
flow through the vacuum hose, when decellerating, we suspect. To check
yours, and avoid the $200 or so that it will cost to get a new vacuum
assist unit, crawl undr the driver's seat and take the vacuum hose
off the vacuum assist unit. Smell for gasoline fumes. Leave the hose
off on a warm afternoon in a dry dust-free area. Good luck.
