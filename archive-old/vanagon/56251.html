&gt; 2.)  Checked the coolant hoses for leaks under pressure, with vehicle
&gt; running (not a pressure test), there didn't appear to be any (my hoses
look
&gt; like shit and definately need to be replaced).  The hose leading to the
&gt; radiator was warm (not hot) and the return hose was cool, but the
radiator
&gt; was cool.

I recently had the thermostat replaced in my 1984 GL. It definitely solved
an _under_ heating problem. I understand that the thermostat should fail in
the direction of opening all the time, but it would be worth checking if
yours has failed the other way round. It was not a very costly job.

&gt; I think I should replace the water pump but don't want to spend the money
&gt; if that isn't the problem.  Any ideas?????

If hot water is getting to the heaters then I wouldn't have thought it was
the pump.
