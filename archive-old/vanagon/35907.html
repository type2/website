I found a place cheaper than the parts place and more
competent.  I am willing to bet that you end up sending
something back to the parts place.

Maas Volkswagen auto parts

Tell them you want to order parts,
I usually deal with Don Wright

&gt;I just wanted to let you and everybody else know that I used these people 
&gt;and the service delivery and price was out of this world.  It was more 
&gt;cheaper and more convienient to buy parts from Arizona then right here in 
&gt;New Jersey.  I have the list to thank for finding my Westy and buying it, 
&gt;trouble shooting a problem from the service bulletins, and finally buying 
&gt;the parts easily at a low price.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to the list,
&gt;Peter

&gt;Date: Wednesday, October 18, 1995 3:22PM
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Recently I conducted a test to find out which was the VW dealer offering
&gt;factory VW parts at the lowest prices. I composed a bid form with about 25
&gt;different factory parts I intended to buy new, and I sent this form to a
&gt;half dozen dealers around the country to see which really offered the lowest
&gt;prices.
&gt;
&gt;Included in my survey were
&gt;
&gt;Joel Walker's friend Jim Ellis at VW Atlanta
&gt;Sonnen Motors in California
&gt;Bob Hoy's VW in Texas
&gt;Paul Walser Volkswagen in Phoenix, Az
&gt;
&gt;I mentioned in my bid to Paul Walser Volkswagen that I had heard on the
&gt;Vanagon List that they were willing to sell parts at 20% over their cost to
&gt;people like me (Internet Vanagonatics). The Walser people responded promptly
&gt;and their prices were lower than all the other dealers by a significant
&gt;margin on all parts but one obscure one.
&gt;
&gt;Accordingly, I placed my order with Walser, directing them to send the parts
&gt;UPS. I live in New York, but it is better to buy the parts from an out of
&gt;state dealer so as to avoid 8% sales tax. As for the UPS shipping charges,
&gt;in general they are not significant so it doesn't matter which state I am
&gt;ordering from.
&gt;
&gt;In the future, I plan to buy all factory parts from Walser without going
&gt;through the effort to get bids from different dealers. I am submitting this
&gt;post to recomend that other list members do the same. Be sure to mention the
&gt;Internet and the 20%-over-cost program to get your proper discount.
&gt;
&gt;I conducted the entire operation by fax and have never spoken to anyone at
&gt;Walser. Here is there phone numbers
&gt;
&gt;Paul Walser Volkswagen
&gt;Phoenix, Az 85016
&gt;800-876-5199
&gt;fax: 602-265-8768
&gt;
&gt;List members may wish to copy the 800# and label it something like &quot;Cheap
&gt;Factory Parts By Mail&quot; and keep it handy.
&gt;
&gt;I used to buy my VW parts from the local dealer here but I cannot get over
&gt;how silly this is. You pay sales tax. You often have to go to the dealer
&gt;twice--once to order and once to take delivery. You have to wait in line.
&gt;You pay full price or a high price. Who needs it? Go 800 and do something
&gt;more productive with your time and money.
&gt;
&gt;The one caveat is that I supplied the part numbers and asked them to double
&gt;check some of them. If you lack a microfiche you might be forced to go to
&gt;your local dealer to look at the thing and make sure you have the right
&gt;parts before ordering. But now with the recent innovation appearing on this
&gt;list of how to get a cheap microfiche reader (Radio Shack 50X $7 microscope)
&gt;there is no excuse: all list members should get their own fiches.
&gt;
&gt;By the way, before finalizing my order I called up the Parts Place and found
&gt;that when they could supply a part, it was about 60% of the cost of buying
&gt;that same part from the dealer. Accordinly, I gave the Parts Place my
&gt;business for these parts.
