Subject: Manuals for '60 bus

Howzit!

I have heard quite a bit about these manuals.  Can someone please
summarize the subject matter and/or what they specialize in for me?
Which one is recommended for the above brick?  My engine is not
stock, but I do not know its origin (all I know is its a 1600), and
the bus has been converted to 12v.

I'm searching for how tos on heat, speedo cable replacement, wiring,
engine work, alignment work, you name it.  Especially, what are all the stock
interior/exterior parts, screw holes for, interior camper light covers,
dooly bobs, and thingamajigs that were originally supposed to be on
my new pride and joy.  Mahalo for your time.

p.s. Acquiring an original owner's manual would be supreme!

Be cool,
Danny D.
