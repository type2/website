Subject: exhaust repair/smashed my pipe

I smashed one of my exhaust pipes on my syncro while offroading. The pipe is
now nearly flat.

I don't want to replace the whole pipe so I am considering some strategies
for fixing the pipe that is there.

The section that is crushed is about 2 or 3 inches long and is easily
accessible.

I am considering heating it up with a methacetalyne (spelling?) torch to
make it soft and then trying to pull it apart again. There is no way for me
to get leverage to pull the pipe apart so I am considering drilling a hole
in one side of the pipe and then tapping the hole. Then, I would screw some
stainnless bolts into that hole and let the screws push the other side of
the pipe away when it reaches there. Then, I would back the screw off, red
loctite it in, and cut the screw off at the outside.

Any suggestions for me as to how to get this pipe fixed or whether you think
my plan is a good one?.
