Subject: Reclining the front passenger seat?
Date: Sat, 3 Jun 2000 11:33:15 +0100

There is plenty of room behind the front passenger seat and it would be
nice to have a nap while alternating drivers on a long journey, but the
seat only goes back to about 45 degrees.

Is there any way of hacking at the hinge so that it reclines all the way?

Or else is it easy to replace it with a seat from another vehicle? I would
however very much miss the arm rests.
