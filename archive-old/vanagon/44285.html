Subject: Help: Vanagon Automatic Transmission Service

Hi,
Has anyone serviced a Vanagon automatic transmission?  I expect that it is a
matter of draining by dropping the pan, cleaning the screen, replacing the
gasket and pan and refilling with trans fluid.

Any gotcha's from someone that has done this?

Thanks,
Bo Kersey
