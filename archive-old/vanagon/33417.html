Subject: Re: Death by fire?carb leaks

Can someone familiar with this problem post a picture of the offending 
component on the web? I thought we were talking about hoses coming loose. 
Mine are all clamped down. Now I think we're talking about the brass 
fitting itself coming out.

I'm not anxious to be in a car fire, but more importantly, I have little 
ones...and I'm not about to risk frying their fannies.

Thanks! Joe

&gt; We have carried acouple of these horror stories in the SSVC mag recently. The
&gt; problem sems to often lie in the little brass pipe which is supposed to be
&gt; tight in the carb, the fuel line attaches to this. Apart from wear and
&gt; vibration, removal of the fuel line can also not help! The little bleeder just
&gt; loosens...then falls out..petrol goes on engine...BLAM.No bus..
&gt; A spot check of 30 vans in a field at a meet last summer revealed TWO with
&gt; dodgy little brass pipes (sorry dunno posh name) and potential for OMIGOD!!
&gt; I check mine regularly...now! Suggest others have alook?
&gt; If anyone can suggest how to stick this lil bleeder eternally in position I'd
&gt; be grateful..._dot_can I pass on any ideas in next &quot;Split Screen Scene&quot;?  Dave :)
