Subject: Re: Help with syncro driveshaft?


Mario asks:
 
&gt; My Bentley book says that the u-joints can neither be serviced
&gt; nor replaced and that the driveshaft should be replaced as a
&gt; whole. Is this the reason?
 
The parts fiche lists the entire drive shaft as a single part. The
U-Joints are not listed separately.

The previous recommendation from the list was to have a specialized 
drive shaft house replace the u-joints and balance the shaft.

Don't know if this advice was ever acted upon.
