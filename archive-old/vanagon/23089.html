Subject: Re: VW-WHY JERRY'S VW HEAVEN IS MORE LIKE DANTE'S INFERNO

Nick, I would have thought that after the clutch cable incident (grrrrr), you
would have avoided that outfit like the plague.  Having lived and
owned/operated a VW-related biz in So Cal for a lotta years, I heard daily
from others on the phone about Jerry's Vee-Dub &quot;HELL&quot;.  Heard so much, that
just hadda visit the place.  Slick operation, but no experienced help,
horrible quality stuff, misrepresentation out the a** and no redeeming social
or ethical reasons to return to that hole for anything.  Felt alot better
going back to my small business helping customers, some who had been burned
by them.
