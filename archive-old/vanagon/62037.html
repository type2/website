Subject: what is digest like - 2nd request
Date: Sat, 28 Jun 97 09:41:27 -0400
From: Ed Stevens &lt;ejstevens_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

yesterday I volunteered to pass along list subscribe and unsubscribe 
instructions.

Immediately I have received several questions about digest mode and I 
know nothing about it?

I have not heard from anyone regarding my post to the list asking for 
information.

I hope some kind listee who has digest experience would look at 
yesterdays post and answer the questions I put forth.  I will collect the 
answers and make them available to future people with questions.

Time spent now will help save time and bandwidth in the future.

thanks in advance.



-peace
