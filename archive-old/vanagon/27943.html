Subject: Sale Prices for Parts


Automotion (mentioned here as a source for type 4 engine &amp; related parts) 
recently sent me a sale flyer.  It appears that they are offering a flat 20% 
off for all catalog parts ordered from 07-Nov to 14-Nov.  When I called them 
(800-777-8881, 408-736-9020, FAX 408-738-9013) to confirm this, the guy 
offered me the sale prices now.

It seems that useful things to get from them on sale might be:
(prices shown at &quot;regular&quot; price)

039.133.241P   set of 4 intake manifold hoses 1.8l, 2.0l       $9.95
039.133.241BP  set of 4 intake manifold hoses 1.7l              $9.95

Hose
Cat #        i.d.   o.d.     Price per meter
FH-1035   3.5  7.5       $3.95                  Cloth Braided
FH-1050   5.0  10.0     $4.95                  Cloth Braided
FH-1070   7.0  12.0     $5.95                  Cloth Braided
FH-1071   7.0  13.0     $11.95                smooth (rubber?)
FH-1090   9.0  14.0     $9.95                  Cloth Braided
FH-1120  12.0 19.0     $11.95                Cloth Braided


Question #1: Can anybody think of anything else that they might have that 
would be useful to Vanagon/Bus folks? 

Question #2: I have an '81 Vanagon.  Any estimates as to how much and what 
kind of hose I would need to replace all of my fuel (injection) related hose?
