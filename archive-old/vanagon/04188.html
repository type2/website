Well,

	Last night I installed the new seat cover's I got from RMMW.  Took about
2 hours all told.  There were going into my '56 bus.

	Just a note to anyone who does this in the future - look at your seats 
before you order, and make certain whether or not you need the hog rings and
pliers or not.  I ordered them but didn't need them!

	Also, they sell foram for seats, but IMHO its took expensive.  They want
$25 for the top and $35 for the bottom, whereas I got a sheet of foam at the 
local upholstery shop for $22 and had some left over.

	I used a single layer of 1&quot; on the back part, and 2 layers on the bottom 
one layer that just went to the edge of the seat, and the second that wraps
around about 4-6&quot; on all sides.  I also wrapped the back/top part about 4&quot; 
around each side.

	Another trick I figured out is to use masking tape to hold the foam on
while you're fussin witht he covers.  And in addition, I put the covers
on the tail (ducktail) of my 911 while I was getting the seats out of the
bus and taking toe old stuff off, so they were nice and warm when I went
to stretch them over the frames.

	The Result?  Nice, smooth looking seats!  There are a few wrinkles that
didn't come out yet, but after it warsm up today, that shouldn't be a
problem at all.

	This was a real easy job, and I think it rates up there at the good
end of the bang/buck scale!
