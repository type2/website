Subject:      Re: It's showing up in the template, too, Chris..

&gt;&gt;Somewhere there's an .rc file or an .ini file or whatever NT uses, the
&gt;&gt;variable in there needs to be changed, I think. It's probably called TITLE=.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, as soon as I get the ability, I'll go through our configuration and
&gt;fix these problems.

I searched through listowner.manual on &quot;title&quot; and it assumes the variable
has already been set and there's no way to modify it mentioned. This would
be in the Maintainer's manual, which I ain't got.

Chris, what I said about making it too easy to reply to the list? Right now
it's impossible *not* to reply to the list in Eudora. Muy mala.
