Subject: RE: What do ya think? Eurovan Problem Tracking Database

It looks like I'm going to go ahead with the database, I'll probably do it
in MS Access, but FileMaker is an option.  After I get everything defined
I'll let everybody know what info to include. I am open to suggestions on
what to information to track. 

People have expressed concerns that: A) EV's don't have enough problems to 
track, well be patient I'm willing to bet they will.  B) There are not 
enough EV's on the list to be statistically significant.  On this, 
everybody should go out sell their house, quit eating, and get another 
job so they can afford one!
