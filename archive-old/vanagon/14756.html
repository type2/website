Subject: repainting emblems

Has anyone had any success in repainting the plastic emblems (&quot;volkswagen&quot;,
&quot;vanagon L&quot;) on the back of the car.  After most of the silver wore off
the letters, I wanted to repaint to my own color scheme, but I haven't
figured out how to get a result anyone over 7 would be proud of.  Finally
I just painted them flat black, but is there a better plan?  Anyone tried
letting the background dry and then pressing the letters on a blotter of
paint?
B.
