Subject: Re: 1970 double cab advice pls.

Got a line on a double cab, looks OK, minor fr. dented, bondo'd, old paint 
etc. a rolling chassis, no motor. Sits well, all glass and interior present 
~OK shape. Respectable for a 25 year old pastured out bus.

Any advice on where to look for rust in the beast would be appreciated, and 
on other pitfalls. All sideboards there, can't see the bed, too much junk on 
it. didn't try the hatches, going back this weekend. Local FLAPS didn't show 
any tin for this model, around rear, back door etc. Are there suppliers, or 
is this a beat-it-out-yourself job?  tia,    tim s.
