First you will automatically be charged a $400.00 out of state vehicle
surcharge if your VW does not have an emission sticker that says 50 state or
Calif emission approval.Sorry!They figured a new way to get more bucks out of
the newcomers.Other than that I dont think there needs to be any upgrade
providing it passes the current smog check(probably will) if there has been
no tampering.Otherwise watch your wallet! Good Luck.
