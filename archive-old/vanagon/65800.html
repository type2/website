&gt;| Does anyone know if I can replace the 1.9L in a 85 westy with the 2.1L
&gt;| and still pass smog here in Cal? I will be leaving all the stock ass. on
&gt;| the engine, stock exhaust and fuel injection.
&gt;| thanks

        The law states the car is smogged to the year of the engine and that
includes the visual inspection as well (well, according to the air resources
people). To really be legal, you would need to pull the fuel/intake system
and exhaust as well.
        But, the two blocks don't look too different (do they?) so if you
stick everything back together nice and neat, the smog guys might not notice
unless they check the number on the block (but I haven't had a smog person
do anything more than glance over the engine for disconnected tubes and the
like)... Kind of depends on the smog operator I think...
