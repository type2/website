&lt;&lt; And more important than anything, I'm seeking Lexan headlight covers to
 hopefully avoid costly replacement of those snazzy '91 headlights.  &gt;&gt;


Griot's Garage catalog carries a plastic headlight protectant film that you
stick onto the surface of your headlights.  I haven't applied mine yet, but I
think the stuff is made by 3M and looks relatively tough.

JCWhitney sells rigid plastic headlight covers.  I think I've seen ones
listed for 86-91 Vanagons.

Good Luck,
