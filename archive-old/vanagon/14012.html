Subject: RE: 6v wipers on 12v bus

To: Multiple recipients of list


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It is very easy to produce a solid state 12-6v converters, and cheaply too.  
&gt;&gt;parts are
&gt;&gt;1 power transistor
&gt;&gt;1 zener diode
&gt;&gt;1 resistor
&gt;&gt;1 heat sink 
&gt;&gt;that is it!  we are talking about less than 5 bucks here, kids!  The power 
&gt;&gt;transistor is rated to carry 15 amperes, but I don't think the thing will 
&gt;&gt;supply that much.  5~10 amperes is closer.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I built a similar one for 12-9v for a portable cd player and the thing is 
&gt;&gt;simple, but works great.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

&gt;This is probably not a good idea. Such converter is not a converter. It 
&gt;eats same amount of power as the 6V wiper does. If the wiper takes 50 watts
&gt;to operate the described &quot;converter&quot; will also consumes 50 watts. 

&gt;A wiper moter could take 10 amps to operate. This will put a 10 amps current
&gt;through the power transistor. You would need to have a fan to blow on the
&gt;heatsink of the transistor.

Granted, the transistor would have to dissipate 60 W, but so would any power
resistor that could be used for this application, but the fact that the
transistor controls the voltage at 6V to the wiper motor (or more if you wanted
the motor to run a little faster), means that the motor won't bog down under
any condition (like when it is pushing aside wet snow).  There are many
transistors that can easily handle these requirements as long as they are
sufficiently heat sunk (as in mounted to the chassis), the main problem is that
the case has to be isolated, so a mica or sil-therm insulator must be used
along with shoulder washers when mounting the unit.

Another idea I read in this string regarded two motors in series.  I tried this
some twenty years ago when I converted my bug to twelve volts when I was in
high school.  This doesn't work, as the motor that is driving the wipers has a
larger load than the dummy motor, so the voltage drop gradually shifts to the
unloaded motor, making it run faster, which increases the voltage drop, which
makes it run faster, which, well you get the picture, the dummy motor ends up
running reeeaaallll fast and the wipers stop moving.

Since that first conversion, I have converted a '65 and a '64 type II to twelve
volts and in both cases merely had to scour the junk yard for a VW wiper motor
that was nearly the same as the old 6V unit. I found one in a Ghia and the
other in a Bus.  It was really surprising how many different styles of motors
that VW used, but there were many similarities, so that I could find something
that nearly bolted right in.  I have always been happy with this solution and
am a firm believer that the best way to convert the wipers is by changing the
motor, as reliability is very important here.  An added advantage is that many
of the twelve volt motors are two speed, so not only do they work right, but
they work better than the old single speed six volt wipers.

Good Luck,
