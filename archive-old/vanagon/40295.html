Subject: Engine Break In(Q)
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 12:51:51 -0700

Well, the 2L is back together, I'll be putting it in the Westy on tuesday.
New pistons and cylinders, rebuilt heads from Mark Stephens, new adjusters,
but I decided to leave the case alone. Question involves breaking it in...


According to the book &quot;How to rebuild your aircooled engine&quot;, it says you
should let it idle for 20 mins at 2000rpm, and then do the accelerate to 50
drop to 20, repeat a few times. Is this correct? I've been told that
letting it idle can be bad for it. So any tried and true break in
techniques would be greatly appreciated. Also what oil should I use? I've
been told to use non-detergent as it helps the rings wear in better, and
then switch to detergent (actually I'd like to use synthetic, any
suggestions there?). Thanks alot for any and all help! Tom Story
