**END OF LINE DESC**

They did a good job, but I'm sure not willing to live on the East Coast
again after that. It was the salt in Philadelphia that did it, I'm pretty
sure. Well, there were also the short trips of 4 miles or so back and
forth to work.

I live in Oregon now... where my van has lots of friends instead of being
so alone. ;)
