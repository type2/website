Subject:  vdo cyl head temp sensor location?

just got news from the mechanic that my van is alive again after a full
rebuild! :)  the problem is that he can't find the sensor attached to the vdo
cyl head temp guage.  he says there was no sensor in the heads he
removed, i always thought the sensor was a ring that went around a
spark plug from what i heard on the list, bu he can't find that either.  this
is a puzzle to me, the guage worked fine.  i know nothing about it, as it
was installed by a po.  any clues?

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
