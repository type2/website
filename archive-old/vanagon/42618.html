Subject: Re: VIN question

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.


One more question concerning VINs.  I vaguely remeber a posting not
all that long ago that gave an e-mail address or URL [presumably
somewhere at VW] where one could send/input their VIN and find out
when the vehicle rolled off the floor and what OEM stuff was on it.

If this memory is not just s symptom of &quot;male brain shrinkage&quot;, could
someone either re-post or mail I the reference.

Bugs &amp; Things, &amp; Bricks....Oh my,

Roy
