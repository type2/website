To introduce myself....

I am Jan Allbright. I have a '72 Sunroof Bus. I live in Los Gatos, CA.
most of the time. I am a follower of the 'dead' and play drums...
During the day, I can be found at HP helping people sort out networking
problems (specialties are Firewalls and WebServers)..

Plans for 'Althea' include a Grayhound Sceanicruser paint job..a
new, hydraulic lifter type (boy do I hate rolling around on the ground!)
and a 5-speed tranny...fun, fun, fun...

I am 6' tall, good-looking and rich...
