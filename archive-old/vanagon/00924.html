&gt;What kind of tires does everyone run on their vans?

Standard size is 195-14 C6 for basic vanagon, 205-14 for syncros, also C6. 
Get the C6 tires, it's  worth it for the handling, and for hauling if you 
have lots of weight on board. I have on a pair of Sears Trailhandlers in 195 
C6 size, good all season tread. These were a major bargain, $55US each so 
look for a sale. Uniroyal make a Laredo in 195 C6, also good, up around 
$100. Michelin/Conti are TOO EXPENSIVE for my blood. The C6 tires are high 
pressure, up 55psi, but don't do it! They ride harsh and loud so I use &lt;38 
psi. Beware the replacement tire supplied with the vanagon!! it does not 
have the same psi rating as the mounted tires ie 44 vs 55 psi. I found out 
the hard way, mounted up the spare, inflated it to 45 psi to match the other 
rear tire and it bulged thumped and blew up after a couple of hours. I was 
fully loaded with household effects at the time, hence the 45 psi. A company 
called Gislaved (sp?) make an 8 ply tire in the right size if you really 
like the Mack truck feel!  bye tjs
