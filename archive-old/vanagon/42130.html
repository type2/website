Subject: Re: Vanagon case breather hose...

On May 14, 1996, Grungy was looking for Wasserboxer Oil Breather Hose:

Most dealers I've dealt with will just sell you the desired length of hose
needed and keep the rest for stock and the next sale (or internal vehicle
servicing).  Sounds like this dealer wants a little more than a pound of
flesh, eh?  Unfortunately, my Continental Hose supplier does not show the N
900 725 01 (18mm) Hose in it's line-up, but I'll forward a request to them
for it for our future stocks.  It fits all Vanagon Oil Breathers
(Wasserboxers only) 83-91.

Suggestion:  The metric size (18.5mm) is just a shade smaller than 3/4&quot;.
 Most FLAPS carry 3/4&quot; Smog/Breather Hoses and sell by the foot.  The
microfiche shows that 190mm is needed, which is real close to 7.5&quot;.  Use a
couple a clamps for an effcient seal and and you should be on your way :)
