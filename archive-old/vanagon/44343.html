Martha et al.

Susie and I will be leaving v early on Saturday AM
I dropped HArvey Chao and picked up 2 wheelbarrowfuls of nice dry wood.
The wood is all tied on my roof rack.

We will be arriving at about 3pm in my guess.

As I am allocating the cooking duties I think that waht I will bring will be
plenty of italian wine.
Anything else??
