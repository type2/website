&gt;What gas heater related components are under the dash?  The reason I ask 
&gt;is that twice today (about 3 minutes after starting up the heater on my 
&gt;'81 Vanagon) a very loud noise was generated.  I sounded like a blower 
&gt;motor going bad.  It continued while the heater went through its 
&gt;cool-down cycle (I shut it down immediately).  This is not in any way 
&gt;related to the multi-speed fan controlled by the switch on the dash.  
&gt;What gives?  Very ugly noise ... didn't like it. :(

 Looking at my &quot;manual&quot;, the only things I found were fuses, safety switch,
defroster flaps, overheat fuse and a heater relay located on the right side
of the cabin, just about knee high on the passenger side. Consider that
Wilma is a 1982 model Westfalia. Looking at the drawing provided (where I
located the components) except for the items allready mentioned, just about
all of the components are located in the undercarriage.

 According to the drawing, the safety switch is where the reset is located
(about knee level), right side of steering wheel, under the dash. The
overheat fuse is in the second fuse box from left to right under the dash,
left side of steering wheel. The heater relay apparently controls the
circulation blower located about 3/4 of the way back underneath, on the left
side facing the vehicle.

 Since I couldn't tell if one of the electrical component above mentioned
could cause a terrible noise here's a wild guess: electrical fan installed
by someone?

 Hope that the explanation of the components are close to what you have.
Good luck!

 Wilma and Raul
