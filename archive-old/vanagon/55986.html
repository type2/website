&gt;  &gt;	As we rehash this again, isn't this the VW weekender package (I have
&gt;  &gt;the above interior and no westy placards attached anywhere). I thought
the
&gt;  &gt;westy weekender had something like the fridge and the poptop but no
&gt;  &gt;stove/sink/other cabients.

&gt;  Rehash? I love rehash!! just had some for supper. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Correct you are, there is no &quot;Westfalia-Werke&quot;placard under the kickpanel
of
&gt;  the backseat of the 7 pass.NON POPTOP weekender package EXEPT on the
&gt;  Wolfsburg Ed. 7 pass?? (correct me if I'm wrong, Jim  :&lt;). 

Correct.  At least the 1987 &amp; 1988 (perhaps later ones as well) Wolfsburgs
have a &quot;Westfalia-Werke&quot; placard on the kickpanel under the backseat.  I
don't exactly know what involvement Westfalia had on these models, but their
placard is there. I certainly would never call one of these non-poptop vans a
Westy though.

Well there's Weekender and then there's Weekender.  In all the VW produced
vanagon literature I've seen, VW never once refered to any Vanagon with a
pop-top as a Weekender.  VW did call the: foldout-rear-seat +
cushion-over-the-engine + center bench-with-folding-backrest  the Weekender
Package.  That said, I think that popular terminology, instead, more often
calls a Vanagon Camper that lacks the sink/stove/built-in-refer a Weekender.
 So..... if someone says &quot;Weekender&quot; don't assume they've got the same thing
in mind as you do.
  
&gt;  And you are right, once again, The &quot;westy Weekender&quot; be it a Wolfsburg
model,
&gt;  or be it a Std westy - has a poptop and large fridge behind the front
pass,
&gt;  without the stove or sink or other cabinets.

Here's an example of the &quot;popular terminology&quot; calling this model a Weekender
when VW didn't.   This model is more accurately described as a 1986 Vanagon
Camper (no GL) or a 1986 Vanagon Camper Wolfsburg Limited Edition (still no
GL) or  1987 Vanagon Camper (again, no GL).
 
&gt;  Hmmm....I can see a &quot;Bus Plus&quot; comin' around the corner......   :&lt;)
&gt;  chris
 
Or you could just call it a &quot;Bus Plus&quot;!  :-)
Chris, maybe you should look into getting some &quot;Bus Plus&quot; emblems made up?
 :-)
