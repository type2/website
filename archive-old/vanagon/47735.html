&lt;&lt; Hi all, 
 
 Scenario:
 While coasting down a steepish dirt road carrying a moderate load, 
 braking now and again, trying not to ride the brakes, the pedal suddenly 
 became very soft, and braking power greatly reduced.  This lasted until I 
 reached the bottom of the hill, 3 miles or so.  At the next stop, the 
 brakes seemed fine.  There was an odor burnt something afterward.  Since 
 then, the horrible squealing of the brakes experienced first thing every 
 morning, has vanished.  No other problems for 2 days.  
 
 What happened? &gt;&gt;

You got the pads and rotors so hot that they lost thier grip.  This can be
fairly dangerous as this type of heat can also cause the brake fluid to boil.
 This can result in complete brake failure.  I wpuld thouroughly inspect the
brakes and check the drums and rotors for any cracks or warpage.  You should
also repalce the brake fluid and make sure to use the castrol DOT 4.

Dennis.
