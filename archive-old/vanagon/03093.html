Subject: reverse light woes


well im three weeks overdue on my inspection, so id better get my reverse
lights to work this weekend.  Checked the switch by shorting it out,
lights work fine. Pulled switch, pushed plunger in, no lights.

-&gt; replace reverse lightswitch.

VW has it in stock for $15, a sign fron the gods that the normal order of
things is out of whack.

Replace switch   -----------------&gt; No reversing lights !!!!

AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!

Now im thinking there must be something wrong in the trans with the
shaft hitting the switch.

Last thing i will try is maybe building up the switch end a bit to see if that
will get them to work - last step is to wire  in a switch on the dash (actually
legal in our state). Hmmmm - thats two last steps - the story of my life....

any hints,helps,condolences, good shrinks?

sps
