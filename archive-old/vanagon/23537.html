That's two of us, now cut it out d'yall hear!? 

You want electricity in a car you buy it with gasoline, 
but TANSTAAFL (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch)

The more electricity you want the more gas you burn.
This is called power conversion. The alternator, rectifier
and regulator look after the details so I don't have to.
