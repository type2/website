Subject: GEX rebuild update

     Logged in this weekend at just over 3000 on the 1600 SP from GEX in my 
     '66 standard/camper.  Oil was very clean.  Motor never ran hot, even 
     at freeway speeds on trips to Jacksonville and Tampa.  But it has been 
     running rough.  #4 plug was fouled again, second time since motor was 
     installed.  #3 &amp; #4 exhaust valves tightened up excessively.  Eeveyone 
     else was fine.  Compression on all except #3 was 137.  #3 came in at 
     105.  I guess the next thing is a leak down test.  I suspect the head 
     due to sloppy guide installation that I saw before installation.  I'll 
     call GEX today and see what they have to say.  More to come.  After 
     new plug in #4 and a carb adjust it's running smoothly again but I'm 
     crossing my fingers.
