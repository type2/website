RE:	Copy of: QUIT BLASTING THE GAS HEATERS!!!!

I have 2 Eberspacher BA6 gas heaters with ALL the components (no swap area
mystery heaters that are missing 90% of their parts - these are complete) total
cost to me: 50 bucks each.   They are what the VW buses originally came with if
ordered with an auxillary heater booster from the dealer.  I personally have
been in a friend of mine's stationary, engine stopped, '76 Westy last winter in
15 degree temps here in Allentown, Pa, with the BA6 gas heater running and it
was *very toasty* inside the bus. Almost to the point that it was too warm.  the
gas heater had been running for approx 2 hours (even tho the bus warmed up
nicely within 4or 5 min. of turning that little green temp. knob on the dash)
and there was NO exhaust smell and there was only the quiet whirring of the
furnace under the bus. I almost fell asleep, if I hadn't a class to go to! My
buddy has used it NUMEROUS times while camping at night, turning the knob and
letting the timer run while he was sleeping.  And he's not dead yet! they are
just as safe or safer to use while sleeping as a propane heater is!  With a gas
heater you don't have to go thru the trouble of locating a tank, and figuring
out where to mount it as you do on the propane heaters, and you never have to
worry about running out of fuel (for the most part, unless you are a person who
drives around on empty all the time) Or constantly checking &amp; refilling the
propane tank.  If you have gasoline in your gas tank then your heater will run.
Simple.  The Eberspachers are very safety engineered, there are quite a few
cutoff switches in the event of  malfunction. And the whole unit mounts under
the center of your bus, out of the way - not under the back seat taking up much
needed storage space like a propane heater would. 

I'm not biased, I'm just warm......gas heaters - safe, practical, the way to go!
