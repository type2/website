&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I am now the very happy owner of a 1982 Bus (sometimes known as Caravelle
&gt;in the UK, Vanagon in the US) with 9 seats, air-cooled 1970cc engine with
&gt;124000 miles, and two sunroofs! Interestingly all its past (and present)
&gt;owners including the dealer are Christians. I would usually buy privately
&gt;but Bilbo (the dealer) gave a 3 month warranty and part exchanged my
&gt;Citroen CX 25 (8 seater). I had been looking for this vehicle for over 2
&gt;years. The seats are for wife, four kids and 3 spare for friends.
&gt;

Am I missing something here? It seems to me that about 90% (probably more)
of the people in the UK are Christians. These seems like being amazed at
rain falling in Seattle for five days straight, or walking a dark alley in
Hong Kong and not seeing anybody over six feet for some time.

Now if the dealer is really named Bilbo (wife's name Bimbo?) then it's
getting interesting.
