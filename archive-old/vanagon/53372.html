Been driving by this camper at an AM/PM place every morning for many 
months.  Stopped and chatted once.  I noticed a FOR SALE sigh this 
morning.  He has to pay off some debts, so bus is for sale.  Here's 
what I know:
Sacramento Area

'71 Sundial Camper, thats the one with the fixed fiberglass hightop.
1600 DP, stock setup, lots of new/rebuilt stuff, muffler, carbs, 
heads.  Looks to be in excellent shape, body clean. $3000
