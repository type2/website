&gt;	Ok, I just Did It- I'm ordering a turn-key, smog-legal,
&gt;1970 Bus motor with hydraulic valves, breakerless electronic
&gt;ignition (Compufire) and a dog-house oil cooler. Mark at ECI

&gt;	I know this sorta goes against the DIY ethos of this organization,
&gt;and it sure is a pile of money. I'm sure there's plenty left for me
&gt;to do, and life is short. I'd rather drive a bus than fix a bus.

Don't feel bad.  I felt kinda guilty when I decided to but a rebuilt motor,
with with the economies of scale these shops work with, you can get a 
motor pre-built for much less than what it would cost to do it yourself,
and faster!  And less headache!
