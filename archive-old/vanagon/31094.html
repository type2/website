Subject: Re: exhaust gaskets + permatex?

Permatex is essentially the same sealant used in the vw factory. (Smells
like aviation glue) My mechanic,  who's Austrian and use to work for
Volkswagen Germany, uses  the stuff for &quot;glue&quot; on the gaskets. As it
starts to set up it holds the gaskets in place and makes life much
easier. Permatex (you guys are talking about the brown colored I hope) is
also perfect for the sealing of the two halves of an aircooled engine
because as we all know there's no gasket for this. It should also be fine
for use with any exhaust components.
