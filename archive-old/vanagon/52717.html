     You can also employ the gorilla to dry your dishes therefor 
     eliminating the need for the often over looked stove top drain board.
     
     Well, it's Friday in Belgium

&gt;I knew about the oil filler extension tube, the stove cover/drainboard, and 
&gt;the swivelling front seats.  What I want to know is, where do you store the 
&gt;gorilla required to swivel the dang things?!?
     
Ahh yes... the Gorilla is stored in the aux. batt. box under the drivers seat 
that some Vanagon owners don't apparently know about.   :&lt;)
