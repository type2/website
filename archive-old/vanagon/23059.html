&gt;
&gt;Locating these is a problem.  I'm reluctant to put a housing on the dashtop
&gt;for fear John Law will think it's a radar deflector.  I thought about
&gt;putting an instrument binnacle in front of the passenger seat, to match
&gt;the original one in front of the driver.  Move the radio into that and
&gt;put the gauges where the radio is.  A lot of trouble, and then a long
&gt;reach to change tapes if you're driving alone.  I finally put two gauges
&gt;east of the lighter socket.  They look fine, and are readable even tho' the
&gt;angle is oblique.  Note that there is room for one 2 1/8&quot; gauge in the
&gt;blank area below the LEDs in the middle of the stock instruments.
&gt;Please play back any other ideas you have.
&gt;B.

I mounted 2 VDO guages in the VDO 3-hole bracket just between the steering
wheel and the clock/LEDs. I have to peek over to see the trip milage;
I think that's the only one I can't still see. Pretty neat, actually.
I wanted the gauges right in front of me and there they are.
