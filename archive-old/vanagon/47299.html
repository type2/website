&gt; Hi, I hope someone on the list from &quot;down under&quot; can help me with
&gt; this. Are VW busses or anything similar available for rent in
&gt; Brisbane, Australia?

  Martin, according to my copy of Mobil Retirement Handbook by Jurgen 
Hesse, (under his Australia section) these are valid rental numbers:

Avis: 800 331-2112 (US)
Budget: 800 527-0700 (US)
Explorer Motor Caravans: 800 558-0872 or 800 854-3413 (US)
Great Holidays: 800 551-2012 (US)
Holiday Motorhome Rentals: 800 282-1401 (US)
                          or 714-675-2250 (call collect)

Letz Rent-a-Car or Touralong Travel Homes: 800 472-5015 (US)
                                          or 213 393-8262 (call collect)
Sunseeker Campervan Rentals: 714 675-7620 (US)
                            or 604 734-7725 (call collect)
Thrifty: 800 528-5808 (US)

  Trailer parks are called caravan parks in Australia.  They can be found 
almost everywhere: standards differ, but basics incluse electrical 
hookups, hot and cold shower, toilets, and laundromats.  Fees range from 
$6 to $12 a day.
  &quot;Campervans rent from $350 a week including 1,000 m. and 15 cents per 
km. after that (about 24 cnets per mile).  Micro or mini motorhomes range 
from $450 a week including 1,000 km.  .  . . &quot;
  Sounds like a well established practice.  You should encounter no 
booking difficulties.  Hope this helps.
