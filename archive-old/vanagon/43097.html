Subject: Introduction and good-bye


to All--

A while back, alot of folk were doing introductions of themselves.  
I'll catch up now.  As Gerry can attest, I'm a 37 year old gear head 
with a geek-like facination for things automotive.  The son of a 
retired auto-mechanics instructor (any Dunwoody people out there?), 
I've been imprinted with the smell of carburetor cleaner and grease.  
Well, also the exhaust smell of a pre-smog V-8... gawd I love that 
sweet, acrid quaff.  Traveled around alot as a kid, Dad took us over 
to Khartoum, Sudan for 2 years while he helped set up the Dunwoody 
Industrial Institute there.  Settled finally in the land of 10,000 
Lakes and in fact now reside on one, having just bought the 
house I grew up in as teen.  Among things automotive, I also raise 
honey bees, grow too large a garden, produce a little maple syrup 
with a friend, and brew various fermentable beverages.  My family of 
2 wonderful kids and an understanding wife is the best hobby of all.

My Volkswagen past is not nearly as colorful as many, having owned my 
one and only NEW car, an '86 Jetta GLI that gave me my first bad 
taste for Volkswagen reliability.  And new cars.  I currently have a 
total of over 440,000 miles on 2 vehicles, an older Camry and my 
current love, an '87 Westy.  There was an interim romance with an '85 
Weekender but she made me realize I really could only be happy with 
the real thing.  I and my family heartily recommend them.  Problems 
and all.  Not that my previous afflictions, Fiats and Volvos and 
Bultacos and various Detroit Iron have been without strife.

So, it with very mixed trepidation I leave this list.  I have 
accomplished much through the help of many of you.  You all are truly a 
community of kind, knowledgeable souls.  But the demands of work and 
home life are such that I need to prioritize my time, and for the 
summer anyway, I am choosing to leave.  I may lurk on Digest but that 
is so unsatisfying-- perhaps cold turkey is the only route for 
addiction.  and it makes a good sandwich.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
