Woops, gotta watch those headers!  That was supposed to be a private
e-mail, but I guess it's just as well, since I was gonna post about
this place anyway.  The name of the place is Solar Electric, if anyone is
interested, and their phone # is 1-800-842-5678.  But if youz peoples buy
up all of the panels before I get my second one, I'm gonna be upset!!!
