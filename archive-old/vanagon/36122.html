&gt;        I have been using this special permanent coolant for quite a while
&gt;in all my cars.  Works a champ, no drips from the heads or hoses, never

&gt;needs refilling, inexpensive, easy to get.  I can sell you guys some if you
&gt;need it.
&gt;        Its called air.

now THAT is a lie!! my 71 bus, my 73 bus, my 68 pickup, and my 80 vanagon
ALL leaked air like an open window!!! why, you could just stick your hand
anywhere under the bus and FEEL the air leaking out!!

and because of this, it ALWAYS needed refilling!  why, i'd have to stop at
almost every redlight and stopsign ... just to fill the engine up again
with air!

now, i will agree that it was cheap ... at least in alabama. :)  but i hear
that good quality air is very expensive out in southern california. ;)
