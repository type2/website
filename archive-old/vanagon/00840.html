Subject: How much is that 1971 Beetle in the gas station
Date: Fri, 13 May 94 10:08:51 EDT

Hi Folks,

My oldest came home last night all enthused at finding a 1971 Beetle
for sale at a local gas station.  He's about to get his license and
wants a car!!?  My SO thinks this is a great idea too as she is tired
of carting kids around.  Bet this sounds familiar to many of you ...

Anyway, I took just a brief look at it on the way to work this morning. 
It's recently had a lousy paint job (bright red) and otherwise looks very
used, but nothing stands out as really wrong.  The engine looks dirty.

I forgot to look at the odometer (not really sure it's relevant anyway)
and didn't ask for a demonstration or ride, but I am interested in what
you all think might be a reasonable (help me define this) price to pay.
Asking price is $1500.  If we get serious about this, I'll take it to
the local VW dealer and pay to have it evaluated.

I think this could be a great opportunity for the kid to learn about
autos, both the fixing and operating expenses.  But I'm concerned about
the cost and availability of parts.

What do you all think,

DickE
