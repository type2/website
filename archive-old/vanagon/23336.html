Subject: winch on bus?
Date: Wed, 23 Aug 1995 16:49:13 -0500 (CDT)

Damark offers a winch for about $107 and I was contemplating a purchase.
Although this would qualify as a toy rather than a necessity, I've already
gotten stuck three times on slippery ground: twice on grass and once on
ice; had to call a tow truck in one instance and friends in the other two.
Also just read Harry Yates' fascinating Travelogue on Ron Lussier's
excellent page and now totally *NEED* that winch. (But most of all, I'm
just looking for a distraction from work :-) )

Anyway, is there anyone with a useful opinion out there? How would I
attach the winch to the bus's front? 

Merci.
