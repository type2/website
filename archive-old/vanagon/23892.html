Subject: another silver socket revelation


This thread just never dies, does it?  Newbies:  check the gopher
search utility for silver socket and you'll catch up.  Oldies:  you may
recall my interest in VW Things.  As part of that, I subscribe to
a club newsletter, which I received today.  On the first page of
it is an ad from a firm in Phoenix called (giggle) The Trim Shop,
which carries items for VW Things.  In this ad, they address the
silver socket, and show a picture of it, and I'm nearly certain
it is the same one I've seen in some of your cars, and heard
discussion on.  Here's what they say:

12 Volt Dash Panel Accessories
Does your car have this jack?
We are often asked about this part...what is it for?  Do you
have anything that plugs into it?  Well, now you are in luck!  The
Trim Shop (still giggling) has a complete line of
accessories that plug into the original (European-type) 12 volt
accesory jack.

Trouble Lamp - a drop light with a cord.  Enough to change
a tire or check your engine.  Also comes with universal plug that will
work with any cigarette lighter plug.  Intro Price:  $35

Reading Lamp - For that extra light you sometimes need for a map,
or just to find stuff in the front seat.  $22

Plug Socket - If your car didn't come with this connector, or if you
want to install an extra in the engine or luggage compartment.  $17.50

Angle Plug - This plug will fit flat against your dash.  Use with
any 12 volt accessory such as a tire pump, cell phone, or
spot light.  $8

Straight Plug - Same as Angle Plug, except not with angle.  $8

Universal Plug - This connector will fit the dash socket and it
will also fit into a standard cigarette lighter socket  $12
