Subject: Re: ?Propane Refridgerator Starting

Robins request got me off the dime, so I searched the archives and I 
have linked two revelant posts to the Syncro Westie page at 
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm/

The first one is a comprehensive list of steps to take and things
to check, the second is my (not necessarily universally accepted) 
approach.

If anyone knows of a single comprehensive piece that better answers 
these questions, let me know and I will adjust the links.
