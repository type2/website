Subject: Info on '87 Westy needed!

After spending 3-4 months looking for Westy's in this area, an 87 
came up at what seems to be a good price:

4sp, 190K (km), new engine at 120K, cruise, power mirrors
asking $ 12,900 at a dealer...

Average prices around here are about:
83-84  $ 9-13K
85-6  $ 12-14
87+   $ 16K+
(based on recent ads)
The cheapest 87 I've seen lately has been 16K, so this one sounds 
good. It's been on the lot since the summer (they were asking 16,900) 
so they want to move it.

ps: The engine replacement is said to have been done in Mexico, but I 
haven't seen it yet - is there any quick way to check for a proper 
engine code, etc?

Any other input would be appreciated - I'm going to see it tonight, 
so please cc: to my e-mail.

Thanks!
