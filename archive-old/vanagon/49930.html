To All:

Adjustable mixture is nothing new.  Model T carbs offer dynamic manual
mixture adjustment.  Such things became unnecessary with better fuels and
fuller understanding of carburation.  The feature is retained on aircraft
carbs due to the wide range of air density in which the engine must operate.
 

For automobiles, which typically operate within a rather narrow range of air
densities, variations are taken care of by the air emulsion tube, the design
of which provides more fuel in denser air, less in thinner air.  Should you
find yourself operating at high elevations taking the time to tweak your
mixture AND your timing will put your engine back in the optimum window of
operation.  For prolonged operation at high elevations it's customary to go
to a smaller jet and more suitable emulsion tube.

On modern fuel injected engines the problem of changing air density is dealt
with by the electronic control unit, which alters the amount of fuel
delivered as well as the firing point based on air density, ambient temp and
other factors.
