okay--
i really hate to give away my source on these cause they are the 
thermometer bargain of the year.  Surplus Center has a *digital* 
(appropriate oohs and aahs) one measures -40 to 300 F with a 5&quot; metal 
probe.  all for the low price of $9.99.  i have 4 of them 
(getting as bad as Derek) so i feel i can relinquish my source.  they 
make great gifts for the geek inclined.

item # 21-1228
Surplus Center 800-488-3407

i don't know if they have these left... i ordered them a while ago.
