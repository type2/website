Subject: Re: Stovetop coffee makers


&gt;this reminds me of a co-worker who cut the working end of the spoon away
&gt;with a torch and would substitute it in a restaurant cup of coffee.  Should
&gt;have seen the startled look on the waitress's face when he pulled it out of
&gt;the cup complaining that the coffee was too strong.


An extra pair of dentures, left clamped on a bagel as you leave, has
almost the same effect.   :^)
