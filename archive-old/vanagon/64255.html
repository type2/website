Subject:      PO point of view

Fellow List Members:
         I never thought I would be a PO (previous owner).  The new owner of my
beloved Brown and tan 84 Westy arrives tonight from another state. I can
only hope she cares for it as I have.  Well not quite that much, SO says
I spent more time with the Westy than with her.  I just say &quot; I usually
take you along, don't I&quot;  She just grins and climbs in as we heads off
on another adventure.
        The VW gods may strike me down, but I looked at a Mini Motor home
yesterday.   It was a small unit on a Toyoto ( no flogging please) one
ton frame.  I love VWs, but the A/C, generator and Bathroom are
desirable options.  The SO suggested looking at C class motorhomes.   A
little money in  your pocket is a dangerous thing.
    Motorhomes Are Expensive.
A 25' 1980 model C class costs over $10,000.  It was then that I
remembered the draw of the Vanagon, Efficiency.  I was always amazed by
how much stuff I could pack in my Westy and still have room for a canoe
and bikes.
        Two things that I learned is if you own a motorhome you can write the
interest off as a second home.  The second is that VW vanagon qualfies
as a RV with some insurance companys.   After talking to my StateFarm
agent my insurance cost went from $195 per 6 month to $138 per year.
Well worth the time to check out. I saved $276 in twenty minutes.

My search goes own for a replacent for my Westfalia.    What it will be
time will tell.

Thank you for listening to my saga.

Kenneth Winter
