Subject: Oil burning and Tires
Date: Wed, 9 Jul 1997 12:45:57 -0500

I have a few questions, first, I just replaced a broken exhaust pipe in =
hopes that it would eliminate my high idle and periodic oil burning, =
wishful thinking.  Here was my reasoning, the hole in the exhaust, =
(front X-over) which is before the O2 sensor,  was letting air into the =
system, telling the O2 sensor the engine was running lean, which caused =
the system to use more gas, which in turn washed oil out the tail pipe.  =
Well, the oil consumption has gone way down, but it still burns oil =
sometimes.  It only burns oil at low RPM's in a hard turn.  Any Ideas?  =
Repairing the exhaust pipe also helped the previously constant high idle =
which is now sporadic.  Could these problems be related?  I think it =
could be electrical, like a ground strap or maybe a valve guide.

Finally, I was looking at tires and I found the Michelin Energy MXV4 =
205/70 HR14 95H touring All-season .  The tires are H rated (130 Mph), =
which is irrelevant to me, but they are 4 season radials that can hold =
1,499 lbs. each (95=3D1,499lbs), the tire seems adequate, what do you =
think?  BTW, this one isn't cheep, they are around $110 a piece.  Does =
anyone have these?  Also, are the Michelin MXT's good in the snow?  =
Thanks.
