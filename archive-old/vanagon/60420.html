Subject: Re: Journeys under difficult conditions

Sorry for the repost, but I do need to know which bus etc. 

I recently received plans for under chassis protection for transporters
(splits, loafs and bricks.) I would like to hear from anyone interested
in adding skid plates to their bus.  If you would be interested, please
drop me a note.  Don't have a price yet.  Still need to do a little more
research.
 
BTW, I have nothing for syncros.  :(  Guess with AWD one doesn't need
skid plates.

Oh yeah, you might let me know which bus and which engine and trans you
have.
