Hey!

	This is a question for all y'all early-ealry bus peoples.

	I went to do a test fit of my new rear bumper on my bus, and it looks
like its going to not fit 'cause of the aftermarket exhaust (brand unknown)
Is anyone out there running an aftermarket exhaust with a ribbed bumper?
I know that my '67s exhaust and bumper would just barely touch...

	If I can't run this exhaust, how much i$ a &quot;factory&quot; muffler?$?

Thom
