Subject: Re: O2 sensors: 1-wire to replace 3-wire?


&gt; &gt; Any three wire one will do -- just cut off the wrong connector and splice on
&gt; &gt; the old one from yours (assuming you have the old one).  I don't even know
&gt; &gt; what mine is to -- I just went into Chief and asked for a three-wire 
&gt; &gt; sensor.  It cost about $35 (they were on sale)  The salescritter looked at
&gt; &gt; me a little strange...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Hi.  I've asked around for the last few days, and every parts store is 
&gt; telling me that not just any three-wire sensor will do.  Are they all 
&gt; just rying to sell me a more expensive part.  I've heard that some have 
&gt; different threading and different temp. ratings.  Anyway, does anyone 
&gt; here know the deal for sure?  I've asked a few parts stores for a generic 
&gt; 3-wire sensor, and they claim not to have one.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get back on the road, so any help would be appreciated.

I guess I must have gotten lucky.  The VW uses 18mm threads (18x1.5, I
think) both on the single and three-wire installations.  I would also 
expect that the heater cores have differing attributes, and so may
preclude a &quot;universal 3-wire&quot;.  Almost all of these that I looked at
were Bosch parts, regardless of the car they were for.  Perhaps there is
some clue in the part numbers stamped on the unit itself.  I doubt they
stamp different numbers on the sensor because of different connectors,
but they most likely put different numbers on the boxes.  Good luck,
I am now outta my depth -- glug, glug.
