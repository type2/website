Subject: 73 poptop FS: Las Vegas

Hey Now,
	A friend of mine has a 73 poptop. I think it's a westy but
not sure. He left a message on my answering machine and here's what
it said:

Got a 73 poptop for parts or repair. The following are new parts
that have been installed: brakes, clutch, clutch cable. Not installed
but comes with the bus is a new carborator and poptop seal. The only
problem it had before breakdown was leaky oil seals. The interior is
good.Call steve at 415-987-3528 and leave a message. would like $500
obo.


After that message he called me and said that he will be in Las Vegas
for about a week. That was on Saturday 9/1/96. This is probably a good
deal since he doesn't actually live in Vegas. You'll probably get a
really good story on how the but got there too.........


Could someone in the aircooled list forward this over there. I'm a bit
short on time right now and have to take off.
