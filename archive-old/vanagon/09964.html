Subject:      bus for sale

which reminds me: if any wannabuses would like a silver 1987 Wolfsburg Limited
Edition (with the backward middle seats and the flop-up table), with about
89,000 miles, good tires (he says), power windows/locks/mirrors, and just
500 miles ago had the head gaskets replaced (local mechanic), and an automatic
transmission ... it's in Greenville, Alabama (about 50 miles SSE of Montgomery
on the interstate I-65) for $5000.

i'm not crazy about the silver color and the backward seats. :(
(just too damn picky in my old age). ;)

joel
p.s. if you're interested, let me know and i'll dump the phone number on you.
it's three hours from me (one-way), so i'm not real thrilled about going to
look at it for you. :)
