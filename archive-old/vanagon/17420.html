Subject: Re: FFRiday: short takes ...

&gt;how many of you older types can recall that famous
&gt;hit television series, the Volksy Bus club ...

and let us not forget some of the great Broadway musicals, such as MAIMED,
which as you all remember is about a headstrong and careless woman whose Bus
falls off the jackstands and pins her; and don't forget Jerome Kern's
classic SHOWBUS, Lerner and Loewe's MY FAIR VOLKSIE, and my own personal
favorite, Rodgers and Hammerstein's THE SOUND OF LIFTERS, later made into
the Julie Andrews movie.

Ah, memories...
