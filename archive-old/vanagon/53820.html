Subject: Re(2): Rough running when Hot

Tonya,

Thanks for your help.  I will proceed to check out the O2 sensor, and if good,
replace all the vacuum lines, since they are not expensive.  Following that I
will test the coolant sensor, as it makes sense that this could cause the
behavior that the engine is performing.  Then I will check out the air mass
sensor.  That &quot;add-on &quot; wiring sounds interesting.  Was that a design flaw in
the original wiring harness?

Thanks,

Charles
