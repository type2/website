Subject: '73 Bus, loose steering top bearing
Date: Thu, 31 Aug 1995 09:24:52 BST
From: Carl Waite XL/FEF 4143 &lt;etlclwe_at_etlxdmx.ericsson.se&gt;

Hello,

My bus failed its MOT yesterday because the bearing at the top of the steering
column is worn which means the steering wheel has more movement side-side
than is permissible.
Q. Has anybody had to remove the play in the steering wheel. What's the best 
way to do it?
My local parts place kindly informed me that these bearings are no longer 
available.... :-(
I have a retest on Tuesday so it needs bodging by then.

Help.
