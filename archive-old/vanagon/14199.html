Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome

&gt;&gt; &gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond' suggest
&gt;&gt; &gt;using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly toxic (it is for
&gt;&gt; &gt;this reason that you don't compost them)

That was me. It was one of my Grandma's handy hints, like standing on your 
head and drinking a glass of water to cure hiccups or keeping one foot on 
the floor as a method of contraception. You mash them up with a little water 
to make a sort of polishing compound. It works great on alloy wheels (and 
its free) but I never tried it on anything else. I also used some stuff 
called Chemico, that is sold for cleaning bath taps and the like. I don't 
know if you can still get this, I haven't seen it for years, but it is great 
on chrome and brass and a fraction of the price of Autosol.


&gt;   Symptoms: Severe irritation and corrosion of the mouth, stomach, and
&gt;   intestines resulting in nausea, violent vomiting, and bloody diarrhea.
&gt;   Potential kidney failure and urine blockage. Other symptoms include
&gt;   headache, backache, difficulty in breathing, internal bleeding, con-
&gt;   vulsions, and coma.

Ah yes, that sounds just like my Gran's rhubarb pie :-)
