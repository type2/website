Subject: Re: Westi's and towing small boats


Anyone out there have any experiance with towing small boats or watercraft
with your vanagons?  Anything to be cocerned about.  I have a friend who
wants to by an 82 Westy. It has a new motor but he is concerned about the
lack of power to pull his small boat.
