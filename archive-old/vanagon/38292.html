Subject: RE: Burning Buses


&gt;Unfortunately, saw a mid-70s camper catch on fire this weekend (next to a 
gas
&gt;pump, of all places).  When I inquired, the station attendent said the 
cause
&gt;was that it &quot;backfired.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The question:  What is it that makes these buses burn?


I've talked to VW &quot;mechanics&quot; who claim that the cars originally came from
the factory with special fuel line that didn't need, and therefore didn't
have, hose clamps. This mechanic used this statement to justify not putting
clamps on the rebuild he put in my (then) '73 convertible, until I insisted.

This might be the case. It seems to work well... until the car and fuel
lines get old, relaxed, start to crack/split... then they pop off, and
spew raw gas all over the engine compartment, including the distributor
and generator, which make nice, juicy sparks inside... the rest is left
as an exercise for the class. And for the local Fire Department.
