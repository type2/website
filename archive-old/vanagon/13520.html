Derek,
	
	I don't mean to sound sarcastic but do you have the feeling that
you know this vehicle inside and out now, and it would be a shame to waste
that knowledge by buying a non-VW?

Or do you want to try something different?

I have often thought that it would be interesting to try and build my very
own 4WD &quot;westy&quot; from a 4WD Econoline (or similar American van). I've seen
passenger versions, and yes they are huge and tall and I don't know how
well they travel off-road, but could they be more expensive to run than a
Vanagon?

Alistair
