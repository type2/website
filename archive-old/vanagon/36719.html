&gt; a new designed in-line 16v motor, similar to the late Golf GTI motor. With
&gt; better torgue and better geared 5-speed trans. Anyone else heard this?  If
&gt; it true, great!  I'll be a the dealer in a 'NY minute' to buy one. Rumors
&gt; like this float around all the time, just wondering if anyone else heard
&gt; this to.  Thanks.

VW's thinking of putting a different engine in the Eurovan?  The Eurovan 
is the new Vanagon.  Just like the Golf is effectively the new Beetle.  
The Jetta is the new Super Beetle.

Why would VW bring back an obsolete vehicle?  Do you think Ford is going 
to make more Model Ts just because people liked them?  Sorry folks but 
they have made a Vanagon with improved torque and all.  Its called the  
Eurovan in this country.  It inherited the Transporter name from the T3 
Transporter in the rest of the world.  VW's American organization is too 
dumb to know how to sell it maybe...
