Betreff: 	Volkswagen


Hello,

I am e-mailing you from Guam U.S.A.  We are on our way to Germany, 
Messstetten, 1 hour south of Stuttgart.  My parents have a VW Westfalia which 
they purchased in California.  They currently live there and we are trying to 
get one like theirs.  The U.S. VW dealer has told them they are no longer 
available in the U.S.

1.  Is this true?
===
As far as our US friends say - yes ! A winnebago conversion seems to be 
available instead of the Westies. 
===
2.  Can I get one in Germany?
===
Sure you can in all Versions up to a 6cyl 145 hp engine. There is good info 
about the VW Westies at the syncro Westfalia page and the westfalia owners 
page or vanagon_dot_com
===
 If so where?
===
A new one at every corner. You should check out the Inporting a vehicle to the 
US Info at the SW Homepage
Used ones at every second corner. The VW Vestfalias are the best selling 
compact Camper conversions in Europe. If you want a quite new one refer 
directly to VW asking for returned &quot;Dienstwagen&quot; (=company car) or 
&quot;Jahreswagen&quot; (vehicles sold to VW emloyees at a discount of about 20%)
===
It has a bed on top it's a 1993.  It's beautiful.
===
The latest models are even nicer and more powerful.
===
Please help us or guide us to a another source or even better yet forward our 
request to someone who might know.

Thanks.
