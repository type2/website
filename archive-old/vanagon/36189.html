That is going to be a tough one. I have only one of those and that was on the
highway. Most of the ones I have seen in the paper or on lots are the CL's or
just the non pop-top MV's. I paid more than 16.5K for mine (non pop MV). You
may have to up your spending limit (or maybe I just paid too much :( 
Anyway, I will keep an eye out and let you know.
