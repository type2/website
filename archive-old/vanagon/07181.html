Subject: Rain Water Leaks in My 85
Date: Mon, 28 Nov 1994 13:59:14 -0800 (PST)

The step in the passenger side front door on my '85 Vanagon fills up with 
water every time it rains. It never fills up to the level of the carpet, 
and the carpet isn't wet so I don't think it's leaking from the front of 
the car.  The door is not full of water either, at least I don't hear it 
sloshing around when I open the door.  Before I start investigating this 
further, has anyone on the list experienced a similar leak. --
