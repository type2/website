Isadora Duncan

Isadora (Dora Angela) Duncan, b. San Francisco, May 26, 1877, d. Sept. 14,
1927, was a pioneer of MODERN DANCE.  With very little formal training, she
rejected the restraints of ballet technique and costuming and devised her
own free style, which was based on natural movement and performed barefoot
in loose, flowing tunics.  She made her way, via Chicago, to New York, and
first crossed the Atlantic with Augustin Daly's theater company for a tour
of Britain in 1897.  In 1899 she made a seecond acclaimed visit dancing to
classical concert music. From then on she made occasional tours of major
European cities and the United States.  Duncan first visited Greece in 1903
and Russia in 1904, where she influenced Serge DIAGHILEV and Mikhail FOKINE
in their plans for ballet reform.

The freedom of her dances was matched in her personal life, especially in
her tempestuous love affairs with the stage designer Gordon Craig and the
millionaire Paris Singer;  she had a child by each of them (the children
were drowned in a tragic auto accident in 1913).  In 1921 she visited the
Soviet Union and there married the young poet Sergei YESENIN, who left her
in 1923 and committed suicide in 1925.  By then Duncan had left Russia and
returned to France, where she gave her last performance in Paris in July
1927.  In Nice, in September of that year, she was strangled instantly when
her scarf caught in the wheel of her sports car.  That December her
autobiography, My Life, was published.
