Hello Larry,

I agree.  After 10 years with my Syncro, 4.3 qts is perrrrfect.  Rest is
top off.

&gt; I found that my pushrod tubes leaked just after an oil change. At first
&gt; I thought that the oil being fresh was more likely to leak. But later I
&gt; noticed that the leaking always stopped when the dip stick showed half
&gt; way between min and max. I now conclude that the devils in the level so
&gt; now I use 4.5 qts and keep the remaining 0.5 quart for top-ups.
