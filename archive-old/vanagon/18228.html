  Hey Nick, 
  It is true that those boots last longer..........
  ................ It is a bitch to change  those things without pulling the
  engine.  Maybe it's time you graduated to that stage.  VERY easy on the '71.

  Gooday,         
  Chris   '71 ? ... and assorted bugs.

Chris,

&quot;GRADUATED TO THAT STAGE&quot;??????  Chris my friend, I unfortunately
graduated to that stage 19 years ago when I first pulled the engine out of
a Bus sitting along side Interstate 5 somewhere near Yreka with not much
more than a pair of vice grips and a cheap set of sockets made out of some
metal-like material.  I've yanked the engine out of the various Busses
I've owned more than I would like to remember.  With enough coffee in my
system, a machine shop that is closing in a couple of hours, and no phone
interruptions (or stripped nuts), I've gone from opening the rear hatch to
setting the engine on the ground in 57 minutes.  Does this mean that I
like to do it?  No.  I hate it.  I hate having gas sprayed in my face when
I'm disconnecting the fuel lines while lying on my back trapped underneath
the Bus.  I hate winding up with a little pile of parts after I'm done
without a clue as to where they came from.  I hate having to decide
whether I should delay putting the engine back in for a couple of days
because I noticed that the clutch disk is just a little bit thinner than
specs.  I hate watching one of the engine studs snap off on a Sunday
morning and knowing that the nearest parts shop won't be open until
tomorrow.  I hate having to figure out which of the formally tight and
servicible connectors on the wires to the generator now is broken due to
my thrashing around in the engine compartment.  And I especially hate it
when the engine-transmission shaft mating is more problematic than a sober
Catholic girl on a first date.

On the other hand, it is easier than trying to change the oil cooler
gaskets with the engine still in the Bus (been there, done that, won't go
back) or replacing the manifold boots.  Why do I persist in playing with a
nearly 25 year old hulk while others zip around in their trouble-free
Geos or Datsuns?  Because I secretly love to work on my Bus and it is
the coolest form of transportation known.  OK, I know, I'm one sick puppy.

Yeah, I'll probably spend the upcoming Memorial Day Weekend putting the
silcone boots on by first extracting 1600 ccs of grimy, dirt encrusted,
stripped nutted, German-Brazilian-Mexican machinery.  Think of me when all
of you are at the beach having a good time.

Nick
