	It is a hassle, but I live in Washington DC and therefore am
	aware that there is a greater chance of having my bus broken
	into.  I guess I will spend the half hour and hook up an alarm
	to the front doors with a 8 second time delay and a klaxon
	speaker.

Save the money. Car burglar alarms produce a great deal of noise
pollution, and tend to have NO effect. People are so used to them
going off with false alarms, that nobody pays attention.

My daughter was dating a boy with wealthy parents. They were house-
sitting at the mansion, and took the classic Corvette when they went
out to dinner. Since it looked like rain, they put the hood up, and
after dinner they discovered that they had only an ignition key,
no door key, so they had to break in ... setting the alarm off.
Since they had not been briefed on the alarm, they did not know how to
reset it, so they got in the car and drove off, up the street, past the
police station with the klaxon going &quot;hoot-hoot-hoot&quot;. Nobody challenged
them. (And after two minutes, the alarm timed out).

If nobody challenges a pair of 20-year olds in a red corvette with
the alarm going off as they drive off, who's going to take notice
of yours ?
