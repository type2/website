Thanks for all the info on the brakes. I will bleed the brakes as
soon as possible. There's been another glitch though. I was all set
to change the second cylinder last night, but I couldn't get the 
darn drum off! The passenger side drum came off with a couple of taps.
The driver-side one seems to be rusted to the shaft in the middle.
We hammered away at it and put penetration oil on the joint and
brushed it with a wire brush.. It won't budge. I thought that maybe
for this one we could try to take the 46mm nut off. Forget it. This
thing is not moving until it rots and falls off. Well, the tools I have
won't get it off anyway. I got a 46mm socket but have to use a converter
and the point of pressure end up too far away from the wheel perpendicularly.
I don't have a torch to heat it up. Can anyone suggest another method?

Thank you!
