on the &quot;my 57 does wild things&quot;.  I own a 60 eu. bus and I had this same
problem.  When I took the rear wheel off and looked at where the spring 
plate attaches to the wheel, I found three of the four bolts(17mm) were
sheard off.  I then had to take the whole assembly apart and drill these
bolts out. Needless to say, it would have been easier to take this to 
machine shop and have then drill it out since it took me more than two
weeks with 3 new drills(vw bolts are strong).  finally after getting all
the pieces back together, the problem was fixed.
