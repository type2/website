Subject: Re: VW settles w/ GM

&gt;In case you haven't read about it, VW and GM came to a settlement.  The
&gt;settlement included a cash amount and VW is going to use GM parts.
&gt;
&gt;I know VW uses Ford parts in some of their European models (found this
&gt;out while in the mid-west) for the A/C control panels.  I wonder what
&gt;parts GM is going to supply.

the engines????  oh no...   :&lt;)
The way VW's been going I wouldn't be suprised....
