Mike,

Just my two cents worth:

37K for a water pump is probably average, I had mine replaced at 45K.

4 new tires, brakes and exhaust at 37K? I would suspect how the previous
owner drove his van.  I've rode with people who I would be surprised if
the would even get that much mileage before such replacements.
Personally I tend to baby my camper, No jackrabbit starts, waiting for
the last minute then slamming the brakes, etc.  I got 75K on my front
pads, and 60K on the original Continental tires. (I also rotate the
tires every six months and swap in snow tires in the rear.).
