Luck of the Irish (Welsh?) I guess, just last week someone bumped me in the
rear and bent the engine lid making it a bit of a trick to open, so I couldn't
get the lid up, with all the heat, to use the one (two is good) fire
extinguisher.
  Normally, I agree about the fuel line, but I really was careful, including
watching for rubing. One reason was because I had a bear of time solving the
leaking gas line wear the steel lines join from the two carbs, spent a day on
it. I think the oil spiling is improbable also, but--ther I lost alot and it
was all over everthing, the gravel gards, clear up to the top of the rear
hatch. Ater finally finding the source I had to wash off the back window to
see.

Tim  (now I have to get that bug running--so how do I get in that little engine
 space?)
