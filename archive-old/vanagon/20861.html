Subject: Wanted: Vanagon Camper, 89-91


Hi, I am one of those diesel-westy persons on the list. I've had the 
diesel for 6 years and it's been one of the most faithful vehicles I've 
owned. Trouble is, I just moved to Dallas some time ago and my wife and I 
became parents of twin daughters 2 weeks ago. I need a van with 
air-conditioning now.
Does anybody know of any 89-91 Vanagon Campers for sale, preferably 
somewhere in the southwest? Any clue is appreciated.
Thx, 
Joerg
