&gt; Well I have Done it,I bought a 1997 EV 	winnie Two weeks ago

	Congratulations!

&gt; lot of 
&gt; differences between the two some bad some good In all honesty I would 
&gt; say the westie version camper is better thought out almost like one 
&gt; designer went camping and the the other didnt...

	Could you give some examples?  I have to believe that the Winnebago
designers have done some camping.  Is it a difference between European and
American camping?  I keep hearing on this list that Westfalia conversions
are better than the Winnebago, but I haven't seen any specific examples.

Thanx.
