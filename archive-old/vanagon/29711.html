I always did.  There's the problem of lever angles and gear ratios and
such.  Perhaps more significantly, I've always had some parts of the
cycle require much more force than others, such that coming off one of
the hard parts (where you're compressing a cylinder's contents by
hand) means things suddenly move more easily/faster as the valves
open.  The result was, the first time that I did it, that piston came
up a lot faster than I expected it to.

No one ever told me ``a little deeper'', so following the instructions
I got as best I could, I put the screwdriver all the way in on to the
top of the piston, and started turning.  The spark plug hole forces
the screwdriver to sit at an angle.  Combine this with the variable
resistance described above, and you've got a good chance of being
surprised and having the screwdriver slip.

The trick of removing all the spark plugs instead of just the one on
cylinder one would alleviate a lot of the problem, since then you
won't ever be actually compressing anything.  Nobody ever mentioned
that one to me until Mr. Hoover's message yesterday.  Engines do turn
more easily and predictably when there's no compressive resistance.

You might want to file my message under ``warnings for neophytes.''  I
was certainly ignorant at the time.  I'm still ignorant now, of
course, but in (hopefully) less-blatant ways.
