Subject: Re: Brake Drum removal -- 87 Vanagon

&gt;I can't get either of the rear brake drums off.

The manual depicts one of those enormous puller-offer things - three or
four or five long arms and a threaded rod that fits on the end of the axle
to exert pull.  I was hoping it could be finessed (read: flogged) off like
on The Bozobus, as I'm about to do this to our '90.

Anyone out there with more wisdom on this subject.

I finally got the new rotors out of the box and WOW - that's the thickest
rotor I've ever seen.  As further evidence that the manufacturer *expects*
machining it is engraved in several places with &quot;MINIMUM ROTOR THICKNESS
13mm&quot;
