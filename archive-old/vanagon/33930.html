Well, some people came to look at my '71 bus over the weekend,
and naturally it chose to run like sh*t that day.

it wants to stay with you!!!!!!!!


Put my wrench on the #2 plug, and that sucker did NOT want to come out.
By putting all the torque on it I could in that cramped engine compartment,
I could get it to turn ssslllooooowwwlllyyyy, fighting me every inch of
the way. Yes, I AM turning it in the right direction.

I'm about to put a cheater pipe on my wrench handle, but thought I'd
ask a few &quot;saner heads&quot; for advice before assaulting those soft aluminum
heads like that. The engine is stone cold, I haven't run it since the
weekend.

It would be a lot easier to remove the plugs when the engine is warmed up.
  Actually its easier to undo almost any nuts/bolts when warmed up

I love my propane torch  (not suggested for use on spark plugs)

Ever notice how few truly rich people drive old VW buses?

the ones who do have nice shiny ones that run perfectly - they can pay
someone else to fix all those things that break
