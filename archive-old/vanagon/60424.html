Subject: And the fund raising continues!!!

Howdy Folks,

Today's flood of donations brings the total to $662.00!  Thanks to all who
have sent in their checks (and cash).  We still have a long way to go, so
if you've been putting off sending in your contribution, please go write a
check.  Like so many folks have said, the list is well worth hundreds of
dollars of free advice.

Many folks are writing checks for $10-$25, and these large donations are
very appreciated (Thanks!)  If everyone on the list only writes a check for
$5, we'll have enough to keep the list going.

Write checks to &quot;Ron Lussier&quot; and send them to:
     Vanagon
     c/o Ron Lussier
     10164 Parkwood Drive #8
     Cupertino, CA  95014-1533
     USA

Thanks in advance, and watch the donations roll in at
