Subject: URL for buying/selling cars


Some stranger on the 'net just clued me in to this wonderful URL
for buying/selling cars/parts.  Ads are posted there for 4 days
for free.  Or, if you want to continue, it's a nominal charge of
$4 per month thereafter, I think.  

It's very easy to use, both in posting and in searching.  Perhaps
the rest of you have encountered this, but this is the first time
I'd heard of it, and I think the service could be invaluable.
