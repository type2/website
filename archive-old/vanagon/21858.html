This is gonna be really xenophbic sounding, so you berkley types
hit +++ now

Is it me, or are all taiwanese/chinese/etc tools CRAP!  
(if its not scottish...)

I destroyed all three of the chinese body hammers I bought last weekend.
The sad things was, one of them was the only one I'd found with this
particular style of head...  

Now I wonder if I'll break the dollies.  I didn't think I could, but 
after I shattered (thats right, shattered) one of the hamme heads I'm 
not so sure.

This is not my first experience with such implements of self destruction.
I see some tools in the stores and wonder what they were thinking when
the designed them.  Sheesh!

I have never had a problem with an american tool, or german, for that matter.
reasonable success with a japanese ratchet, until I put a 4 1/2' cheater
pipe on it... (D'oh!)  My Astro (Japanese, I think) paint gun is pretty good.

Anyone else feel the same way?  It seems the market it flooded with this
crap!
