 Subject:    Color wiring diagrams?

&gt;   I bought a Bentley manual about 10 years ago.  It had some very
&gt; nice color wiring diagrams in the middle of the book.  Over the
&gt; years, the book's spine cracked and the diagrams were lost.
&gt;   I replaced the book last fall; now I have a clean copy and a
&gt; filthy copy. The new wiring diagrams are in black and white, like
&gt; the rest of the book.  I called Bentley and they said they did
&gt; the B&amp;W diagrams to save money.  (Their prices have not changed.)
&gt;
&gt;   Would anyone with an old color wiring diagram be willing to make a
&gt; color copy for us?  I have a '73 Type2 Campmobile (built in May 1973).
