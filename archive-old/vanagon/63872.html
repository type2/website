&gt; Tony Moore, Charlie Ford, and myself would like to invite one and all
list
&gt; members in the east coast area to a party on Friday night,  August 15 at
&gt; the Tri-state Dragway, Ross Oh.(outside Cincinnati).  Please RSVP if you
&gt; can make it so we know how many turkeys to cook. Primitive camping
&gt; available and a great VW Show the next day. P-mail for directions.
