Subject: Camper refrigerator

Took the boys on a spur of the moment first camping trip this weekend. It
does beat laying around on the ground!

All worked fine including the frige but a curious thing happened in the
morning after about 12 hours of operation on propane. It developed a periodic
&quot;drumming&quot; sound that lasted for a few seconds every several minutes or so.
It reminded me of a bildge pump. We were near packing up to leave anyway so I
didn't spend any investigative time with it.

I didn't think these things had any moving parts other than perhaps a small
fan. What was that sound?

Thanks,

Weston
