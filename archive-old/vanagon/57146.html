Subject: Re: antifreeze

&gt;| I've seen this new Prestone stuff on the shelf and it says it can be added
&gt;| to any other antifreeze on the front label. No mention of gel formation. My

	I believe the gel formation occurs if one mixes ethylene glycol based
antifreeze with propylene glycol based antifreeze. I recently put some
propylene based stuff in and the bottle said you MUST flush the system
thoroughly if changing over from the ethylene stuff.

	If I bust a hose, I will just stick water in the system until I can
find a place that I can get more propylene based antifreeze (I believe water
is a lot easier to find than phosphate free coolant anyway), and I know I
am not dumping stuff that is quite as bad for the place where I dump the
coolant as it would have been had I been running an ethylene based  antifreeze,
but that's just my choice...
