Subject: EV Jumpseat Question

I have a 93'MV weekender with the removable passenger side jump seat.  This
seat is loose when attached to the vehicle.  It appears that the two (2)
extensions that stick into the floor have to enter the floor behind (toward
the rear of the vehicle) the bar in the floor to allow the seat to click into
the passengers seat.  Looking at these extensions it looks as if they are
supposed to enter the floor in front of the bar (toward the front of vehicle)
this would allow the seat to be alot sturdier.  I have tried to move the
latch to allow for this.  But unfortunately there isn't that much adjustment.
 


Have any other EV owners had this problem?

This is differcult to explain with text,  give me a e-mail if you have any
further questions.

Sincerely,

Scott Martel
