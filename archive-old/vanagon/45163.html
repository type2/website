&gt;Dear list,
&gt;  Does anyone know which way to turn the idle speed adjustment screw in the

&gt;loosen the screw the rpm's will eventually go down, but only at the expense
&gt;of a nasty SUCKING SOUND...Doesn't sound right...

Screwing it  IN (i.e. clockwise) should slow the idle down, and the sucking
sound should be reduced to nothing before it is all the way in.  Unscrewing
it (counterclockwise) should increase the sucking sound and speed up the
idle.  The louder the sucking sound, the higher the idle, in other words.
If your system doesn't work like this, something is broken or hooked up
wrong.  I don't know of any way to advise further without seeing the
engine, unfortunately.  Hope this helps...
