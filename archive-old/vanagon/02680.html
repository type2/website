Steven Johnson notes:


&gt;I just called the number and was told by recording to call back later.

&gt;I STRONGLY suggest that we all follow through with the letter.  I think
&gt;a letter has more sway than just a phone call.  Don't let this one go
&gt;folks.

yeah, the 800 line tells you to call back when it has too many people both
talking with someone _at_ VW and waiting on hold to talk with someone _at_
VW.  but if you keep trying, you WILL get into the holding queue...

BTW, does anyone have a ballpark on the cost of converting to the new
refrigerant?  i would think that it'd be bucky-buckaroos.  better not shelve
those 2/60 air plans just yet... (for those w/o AC, that is).
