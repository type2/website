I am a Rhode Islander with a 1971 yellow super beetle convertible for sale.
68,000 original miles, completely mint inside and out.  Rebuilt engine,
brakes, interior, etc., etc.  I'm asking $6895.  Anybody wanna buy it?  I

also have a crew cab bus, 1966 in pretty good shape that I'd entertain
offers on if anyone had an interest.  It's got a rebuilt engine, new
bodywork, paint.
