Hi,

	As you recall, I recently installed a 1 1/2 qt oil sump, made
by BugPack.

	I was less than thrilled with the quality.  I decided to go back to
the FLAPS today and bitch about it.  They gave me a new one, same brand,
and I installed that one.  Same problems, namely the threads are very
poor quality, the ones for the sump plate studs.  With the stud all the
way in, they wobble!  Sheesh!  In fact, I can't get this one as tight as
the one I just took off!

	Another scary thing!  I found lots of small black grit on my
sump plate, and inside the sump.  Looks like it could be casting residue
or something.  I cleaned the sump out with a garden sprayer real good 
before I installed it, and didn't see any grit, or feel any when I was
done.

	I felt inside the engine case, and didn't detect any up there, so
it may be localised to the sump.  Somehow I doubt it, though :(

	So far my experience with BugPack stuff (this isn't the first time)
has not been that great.
