Subject: John Muir's &quot;bible&quot;

Does anyone have immediate access to a new copy of the 'Idiot'? I am having
trouble locating one up here, and am pressed for time in the near future so I
can't go hunting myself at the moment. I'm in the market for a (Ahaha... be
prepared to see a &quot;WTB:&quot; post in a bit, asking East coast/New England owners if
they would part with...) a '71 or '77.5-'79 Westy, and would like to initiate
my quest w/ some solid research. :-)

If anyone can get a copy for me, I'll gladly send you $ for it, s+h, and an
envelope.

Thanks for any help!!

Sincerely,
Scott
