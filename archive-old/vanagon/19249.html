Considering the number of wannabuses we have on the list, I think this is 
a great idea!!  Also, sad as it is to think about it, my bus may move on 
to better highways someday, and then I'd have to look for another bus to 
welcome into the family.  The prices and rust conditions of So. Cal. 
buses are good enough that I'd probably look hard for a replacement westy 
loaf in So. Cal.  A list of WWW classified sites would be really helpful.

This would mean, of course, that I'd have to actually get a web browser 
(and a computer capable of running it!)
