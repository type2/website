Subject:      one more radio installing question!

Just one more, i promise!

ok, I checked out the wires...there's 2 plugs, I figured out the
speaker wires(the brown plug i think-has 4 sets of 2 wires each). Ok,
which wires are the power wires on the black plug?!?!!?!?!? And the
fuses? The black plug has all sorts of other wires, which is which?!
I need the live wire for power, and i think a fuse wire or somethin?

As soon as I've got that figured out, then I can install it no
problem.
 I even pulled out the stock radio &amp; unplugged it,  and it still
works...I thought it's coded??
The Sony fits fine! Without bending any metal or mods or whatever!
