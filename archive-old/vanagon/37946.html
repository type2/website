and so it was said:

&gt;&gt; &gt;OK, what does NFA 4295 stand for?   &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Wait wait! I know I know!! &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, April 2 1995. NFA is
&gt;&gt; the song, 4/2/95 is the date the Grateful Dead performed it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Close indeed. The NFA is the song &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, as performed originally
by
&gt;Buddy Holly. The 4295 however might be better written as '42-'95, or a
memorial
&gt;to the dates that Mr. Garcia graced us with his inspirational presence...

        Tricky!! I am duly impressed! Did anyone else catch this elusive
detail? I didn't bother to check setlists, being so used to seeing the date
formats as such. VERY stealth indeed!

So, was anyone there?   Was it really good, or what?  Was this a Bird
Song/Help on the Way/Loose Lucy type show?

BTW, i've been hearing a lot of bad deadhead jokes recently.  
 What did one deadhead say to the other where they ran out of pot?
Man, this music sucks!
What do you call a Deadhead without a VW bus?
Homeless.
