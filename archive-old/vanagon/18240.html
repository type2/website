I personally would have a serious ethical problem about putting the large
amounts of unburned volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen 
associated with such a setup into the atmostphere, just to keep cool. 
Don't mean to be harsh, but I think these things should be considered.

Good spirit,
