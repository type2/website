&gt; Haven't played with them yet (which means they may be tightenable?),
&gt; but what are my options re replacement?  New? Remanufactured? ???
&gt; 
&gt; What can I expect to pay for these animals under the various options?

King pin?  Do I have one of those on my 73?  Is the king pin that fat
vertical pin through the front axle?  Mine has always been loose.  A
few years ago, I bought a new one (about $50) and replaced it (real bear
of a job!) and within a couple of months it was loose again.  Now I just
live with it.  :)
