Subject: Front 'badges' / emblems

I'm in need of a front VW emblem for my 71.  I've noticed that many buses (at
least in this area) are missing this piece, and also there appears to be at
least 3 sizes (67-prior have large [12&quot;?] emblem, 68-? have about a 9&quot;
emblem, and somewhere in the 70's they went to about a 7&quot; emblem).

Anyone out there well-versed in this subject?  Would like to know of a source
for the 71 (9&quot;, I believe) emblem.  Haven't seen them listed in the
aftermarket catalogs, not available from dealer (the price would be scary
anyway), and junkyards have not had them either.  (Actually, I did find a 7&quot;
one for $35, but I want the 'right' one)

Ken
71 Westy
