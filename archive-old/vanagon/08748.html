&gt;The USAA periodically publishes a list of crash stats on automobiles.  
&lt;The list is in the 5 category format similar to that used by Consumer 
&gt;Reports, except it uses colors from green to red.

The Spring 94 copy of &quot;&quot;The Car Guide&quot; distributed by the USAA 
Foundation has the following ratings for the Eurovan:

  CRASH TESTS:
      Driver -  RED         (Much worse than average)
   Passenger -  DARK GREEN  (Much better than average)
 
  CLAIMS EXPERIENCE:
      Injury -  N/A         (Not available)
   Collision -  N/A
       Theft -  N/A 
      Claims -  LIGHT GREEN (Above Average)

They did not have ratings on the Vanagon, presumably because
it is discontinued.  I seem to recall that the Vanagon got good
ratings on the crash tests EXCEPT for driver survivability.  If
I remember correctly, some testers attributed the poor results for
the driver's survivability to the steering column configuration 
and mounting.  

Ratings in &quot;The Car Guide&quot; for other VW models are N/A regarding
CRASH TESTS, except for the Passat which is &quot;Much Worse than 
Average&quot; for driver and &quot;Much Better than Average&quot; for passenger.
For CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, they all range from Average to Much Worse 
than Average. 

Some notes from the Car Guide:

Crash test ratings are applicable to 1993 vehicles and may be based
on 1988-92 experience for vehicles that have not been substantially
redesigned.  Crash test results apply only to frontal collisions and 
highlight the probability of injury to the head.

Claims experience is based on the frequency of insurance claims for 
1990-92 model years.
