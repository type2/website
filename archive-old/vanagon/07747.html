&gt;
&gt;THE &quot;Good Times&quot; VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND
&gt;
&gt;In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information requests
&gt;about a supposed &quot;virus&quot; which could be contracted via America OnLine, simply
&gt;by reading a message.  The following is the message that CIAC received:
&gt;
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;| Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |
&gt;|                                                                           |
&gt;|  Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on   |
&gt;| America Online being sent by E-Mail.  If you get anything called &quot;Good    |
&gt;| Times&quot;, DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |
&gt;| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
&gt;originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
&gt;at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.
&gt;
&gt;CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any
&gt;electronic mail message with the subject line of &quot;xxx-1&quot; will infect your
&gt;computer.
&gt;
&gt;This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the
&gt;fact that many people have seen a message with &quot;Good Times&quot; in the header.
&gt;They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have
&gt;saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false
&gt;sense of credibility to the alert message.
&gt;
&gt;There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
&gt;&quot;xxx-1&quot; in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because
&gt;he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
&gt;checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.
&gt; He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the
&gt;virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
&gt;message).  This person then spread his alert.
&gt;
&gt;As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through
&gt;reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.
&gt;Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have
&gt;been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious
&gt;being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm
&gt;(reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).
&gt; But this is not the case for this particular &quot;virus&quot; alert.
&gt;
&gt;If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply
&gt;ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.
