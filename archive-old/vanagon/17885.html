Subject: bass in a bus (wasRe: crutchfield/stereo)

 Make sure the rear hatch is taped shut, too...  you do not want it
popping out on you when the bass hits... :-)

 &gt; Works great.  Has a 100 watt (peak) amp built in.  Has dual voice coils
 &gt; so one speaker handles both right &amp; left channels. (Bass is s'posed to
 &gt; be omnidirectional  anyway)
 &gt; sounds ok, but not spectacular.   (somewhat muddy)
 &gt; I wonder if I taped over the ported end of the bass tube if that would
 &gt; 'tighten up' the sound ...  ???
