Well, I've learned something new tonight.....
In any case, I thought that 'highway safety' for California meant 
bullet-proof glass and a .45 in the glove compartment.. (Sorry ,
couldn't resist -- my wife rented that Steve Martin movie recently :-)

 &gt; *no* safety inspection.  You don't have to have functioning brakes, turn
 &gt; signals, headlights, or seatbelts to pass &quot;inspection&quot; in California.
 &gt; Implementing a safety inspection would take many old cars off the road

 &gt; I'm in favor of getting rid of emissions limits - I'm not.  It's just
 &gt; that in California they are poorly implemented.
