Subject: Re: Bugtop

This particular beastie looked to be a breadloaf bus, garishly painted
(looked 
good!) with the top of a Bug welded on.....rear first, and all windows
intact.  
This strange creation whizzed by the other direction to quickly for me to get
a 
good look, but from what I could see, it was cool!

There was a creature exactly as you describe around Olympia this past winter.
  As summer just started Friday, they had probably decided to migrate to find
the sun.
