Subject: Re: Rear Windshield wiper

This brings up an important area to be attended to:   I also had one rear
wiper motor get slower and then stop (and then get fried and replaced under
extended warrenty on my 87).    When the second motor started getting
slower recently, I pulled the motor and linkage out and took apart and
cleaned/lubricated the wiper shaft.   It was quite rusty and very hard to
get out.   There doesn't appear to be a seal at the road end of that shaft,
so I would recommend that everyone periodically put some oil on the
outboard end behind the wiper arm (need to take the arm off and pop the
plastic cover off), or be prepared to do a complete disassembly as soon as
it starts to get slow.   (or be prepared to replace the motor when it
fries...)

&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;I just got my '89 Westy out of storage for the spring.
&gt;
&gt;I bought it last fall and drove it straight into storage.  When I
&gt;bought it, the rear windshield wiper didn't work, but it does
&gt;spray fluid when I try it.
&gt;
&gt;I opened up the panel on the back hatch and discovered that the motor
&gt;was fried.  The brushes fell out in my hand.  I took the whole 
&gt;mechanism out and took the motor off the actuator.  I called a
&gt;VW dealer to ask about replacing JUST the motor.  They said &quot;Sure,
&gt;no problem.  You can buy just the motor&quot;  How much?  $204.30 + 15%
&gt;tax.  Ouch!
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of a place in the Montreal area (or by mail) where
&gt;I could get one for significantly less?  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
