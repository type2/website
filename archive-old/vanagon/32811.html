&gt;On this subject, what do you think it would cost to build a Vanagon or
&gt;Eurovan from scratch, buying all the parts individually from VWoA?
&gt;Vanagon $40,000?
&gt;Eurovan $50,000?

probably a lot more than that. i recall some magazine back in the 60's that
foolishly allowed one of their writers/editors to &quot;buy&quot; a vw beetle that
way. the normal price at the time was about $1800 &lt;no, really.&gt; but when the
fellow finished the project, after buying all the parts across the parts
counter and paying retail plus tax, the total was in the neighborhood of
$15,000!!!

so i would imagine that a vanagon/eurovan would be more on the order of
$100,000 ... and you'd still have to get it painted!! :)
