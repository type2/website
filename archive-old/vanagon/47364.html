Subject: Re: leaking vanagon

&gt;Greetings! Any Vanagonites (or otherwise) had experience with rainwater
&gt;leaking from behind dash?
&gt;After about 24 hours of driving rain, there were slow drips on both the
&gt;passenger and driver side (91 Vanagon) onto the floormats. I felt around as
&gt;best I could from below: very damp, unable to locate source. windshield seal
&gt;seems intact. Any ideas?

Hello Pat,
     I have had a leak in the front of my '86.  I had the winshield replaced
and soon after I noticed the same signs that you have.  I used a garden hose
to spray  large amounts of water at diffrent points on the front of the van.
After each spraying, I checked under the dash.  I found that it was the
winshield seal leaking.  It was leaking at the lower driver side corner.  I
used some silicone sealer to inject sealer up under the rubber seal.  Bently
shows that an adhesive bead ( sealer?) should be used around the rubber
seal.  I wondered if the installer I used did this.  Be sure to check the
grounding points behind the fuse panel.  I had headlight problems relating
to a corroded ground.  Hope this helps.
