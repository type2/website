&gt; ...[I said the temperature gauge needle always showed 'low']...

&gt; If the
&gt; engine appears to be sufficiently warm, and you're getting good heat
&gt; out, and the front radiator gets good and warm, I'd think it was the
&gt; sensor.  If things do appear to be actually cool, it's probably the
&gt; thermostat.

I was wrong about the temperature showing 'low' all the time:

Today was a warmer day, and I let the car idle for over half an hour. The
needle went up to about 65-70% so I think this indicates that the sensor
does operate over the full range. Also indicates that the thermostat
is doing its job?

The two questions I now have are about:
1. Red LED in temp gauge
2. Radiator fan switch


1. Red LED in temp gauge

&gt; Concerning the red light, it should blink when you start up the engine
&gt; for a few seconds.  This is a test to let you know the bulb works.  If
&gt; it's not even doing that, then there is something wrong with it.

It does blink.

&gt; Most
&gt; likely, the wiring has a break in it, or there is corrosion at the
&gt; connectors.

What I don't understand is that when I take the wire off the sensor the
light does not come on. Does this not simulate a break in the wire? I mean
should the LED light up when the circuit formed by the 2 wires is broken?
Or else is the ground involved somewhere?

If you take the wire off, does your red light come on?

2. Radiator fan switch

I am suspicious that the fan is not coming on, so when idling the engine
heats up (needle at 70% on the gauge). So,
a) How do you tell when the radiator fan comes on, can you see or hear it?
b) At what needle position should the fan come on?
c) How effective is the fan at bringing the temperature back to normal?

If my fan is not coming on as it should is the answer to replace the fan
cut-in switch?
I don't mind the engine being too cold but I don't want it to be too hot.

Thanks!
