The VW gods are laughing again,  kidding aside, good choice/deal, I'd buy it 
for $1,600 in that shape, assuming no other significant probs.

&gt; This is way-way outta my league. 

Maybe not, for you can drop the engine probably, and get it to the 
rebuilders? Takes a lot of your labour/time but that's why you bought it 
anyhow. Will save some $$$.

Or.... buy a headgasket set $$$ and rebuild each side with the engine in the 
van, I've done this route, no special tools needed. Only do it if your heads 
are in good shape, minimal pitting/warping. if not, buying new heads is 
$$$$. This list may be your best friend for this stuff.

Or.... ask for dealer for the rebuilt engine deal, $2500 I think, for NEW 
block/heads. You still need to strip the old one down and transfer pieces to 
new, ie. alternator, exhaust and on and on.

&gt;Thanks in advance (Since I'm sure I'll be here alot!)

welcome, and... yup, most likely, we all are!
