Scratch one lurking unknown sniveler,
replace w/ lurking known sniveler:

Greg Daughtry
'87 Vanagon GL Westfalia
&quot;The Love Macheen&quot;
Maroon with a bad tinting job on all windows,
a solar panel on the roof,
and some rather sick looking body damage incurred on a rock/ice climbing trip
to Colorado last week.

Currently parked in Raleigh, NC but registered in Boulder, CO.

BTW, does anybody know of a good body shop in the RALEIGH, NC area?

Nice to meet you all!
