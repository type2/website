Subject:      How to fit a radio in the dash.

Hi everyone,
It seems as though some people are having problems fitting radios in their
dashes.  I ran into the same problem when installing a Becker radio in
mine.  The clearance problem is due to the heater van blower housing being
in the way.  All you have to do is use a heat gun to soften the plastic and
push it in and out of the way.  It will take a while to get it just right,
and you'll have to hold it in place with something while it cools.
