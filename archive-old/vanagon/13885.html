Subject: Re: Pop-top popped!!!

Yikes! The instant and total removal of pop-top with tragic results.

Might I suggest trying to retrofit the lock down mechanism from a late 
model Westy (such as my 79).  It has a really secure centred lockdown 
point with a pin to keep the thing closed.  In order to secure the top 
you gotta give the lid a good pull and the mechanism reponds with a 
reassuring thunk!

I feel really safe that the top's pretty secure with this baby operating.

Hope thai can help, though I don't have a part # or other info.
