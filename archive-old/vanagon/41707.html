Hello,

	The story is as follows:  I bought it from the original owners in 
1993, w 100K miles on it. 
	At that time I rebuilt the engine - new everything.  I have also 
rebuilt the carbs.  The body is rough.  The front end had been dented 
in.  I repaired the body damage, only to have someone dent it again.  The 
interior is mostly stipped, but I have all of the stuff.  Runs great, but 
needs to be tuned up to smog.  It has dual carbs which are basically 
impossible to tune unless you have an exhaust gas analyzer.  Runs great.  
Also has new CV joints, new brakes, new clutch cable, new fuel pump, new 
brake pressure regultor, brake booster recently fixed up.  I also 
repaired rust damage around the front windshield.  I cracked the 
windshield putting it back in, but will fix it before I sell it.  
	I have two other old cars which need TLC as well, and I just
don't have the time anymore.  Her name is Clarabel and she needs a 
good home.  Let me know if you are interested.
