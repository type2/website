Subject: '85 Westfalia Air Conditioning

Does anyone have an air conditioner on an '85 (or so) Westfalia they 
are happy with?  The one I have is worthless.  There are only two 
vents mounted on the upper cabinet in the back where the door 
originally was.  If you're sitting in the back seat, you get air on 
the back of your head.  Anywhere else in the vehicle it is 
non-existent.  From non-use, the compressor has now locked up, so 
what I have isn't worth much.  Someone out there must have found 
something better than this.
