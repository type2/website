Subject: Tire warning: 1982 diesel vanagons
Date: Thu, 10 Aug 1995 11:59:00 -0600 (MDT)

Hello vanagon gang,
This warning applies specifically to the 1982 vanagons, but it might apply
to other years ... I don't know.
The spare tire on these things has a latch mechanism which is supposed to
hold the tire in place while a person supports the tire ... I guess.
What my warning is is this:  do not trust that latch mechanism to correctly
hold the spare tire!  Do not do any operation which places something that
can get hurt (name your particular appendage) under that tire.  And, do not
expect to be able to get your arm out from under that thing intact if it
let loose.  Yesterday, I almost broke my arm on mine when it came loose.
Learn from my near accident and don't hurt yourselves!
Stuart
