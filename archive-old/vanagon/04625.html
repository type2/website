Subject: camper conversoins

On the subject of camper swaps, we have a split in fair shape (NOT 
showroom) that we are installing a 79 westy interior into.  The sink and 
bed will fit, but the icebox won t.  My friend the cadinet maker says he 
can make a new cabinet instead.  I ll keep everybody posted as to how 
this comes out.
