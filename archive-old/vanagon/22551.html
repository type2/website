Subject: My new Van

Hello,
Yesterday I drove my brand new 95 Aerostar for the first time.  I know, I
know, did he say Aerostar? A-e-r-o-s-t-a-r?  Could that be?  You're thinking:
Is this guy in the wrong place?

Please give me a minute to explain.  See, it's a company car and Aerostars
are what they've picked.  Here's my first impression: Icky.  Yeah, I don't
know how to 'splain is exactly but icky seems to sum it up.  It just doesn't
seem to have any of the inherent goodness of my Vanagons.  The armrests are a
joke.  The power locks operation is goofy (you know, you have to unlock the
driver's door and then reach inside to push the button to unlock the rest of
the doors).  There's &quot;walk through&quot; space between the front seats but only
for kids or a contortionist.  Oh well, I won't belabor the point.  I think
you all know what I mean.

Since it's basically free, I'll try not to look this gift horse in the mouth
(at least not too long).  I sure like the 6 cylinder 3 liter power though!
