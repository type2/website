Bottom line for me: it's YOUR bus. You do what you want to it. If *I* 
don't like it; tough! I should have bought it before you found it. Or I 
can offer you enough money for you to part with it and then *I* can do 
what *I* want to it. (And you can prosecute me for what would undoubtedly 
be a hot check right now. ;)

The buses and bugs in museums are there 'cause someone wanted them to be. 
It's a priveledge to see them; not a right.

just my dos eces 8) Joe

PS If you feel the urge to flame me for my opinions, please do so 
privately. I'd hate to see this get nasty on the list.
