&gt;While playing in my new-to-me 89 Westy, I discovered that I have a
&gt;(Ebersach (sp?) gas heater, with a control panel mounted on the wall behind
&gt;sliding door to the left of the rear ashtay.
&gt;
&gt;There are two flashing lights, one green, and obviously meaning all systems
&gt;go, but when the  dial is on 1 (dial is 1 to 7), the red light blips.
&gt;
&gt;How long should I keep this running when the engine is off?
&gt;
&gt;Any advice?

I've never heard of an Eberspacher control panel mounted there. Are you sure
it's an Eberspacher??

Gas heaters on wasserboxer vanagons are extremely rare to begin with.
Especially on one as new as a '89. 

Do you live in Canada??
Is your '89 Westy a syncro??
