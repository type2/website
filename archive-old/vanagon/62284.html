Hi Everyone!,

We just did the Yellowstone trip, and along with the standard Yellowstone 
shots, I've put some pics of my '85 and my Brothers '86 Weekender on the 
site, with some pictures of the Teton-Bridger area coming soon.

If anyone's interested, feel free to drop by http://www.nicoh_dot_com/ctucci 
and take a look!

Thanks to the list for some excellent info....
