Subject: clarification please

Can someone please shed some light on a problem I am having concerning
the coolant temperature sensor. Is the temperature coolant sensor the
little brass switch and the one with the plug the thermo-fan switch. The
guy at the local flaps said that the temp sensor is the brass one. In
the bentley it appears as if the temp sensor is the one with the plug on
the end. Thanks in advance.
