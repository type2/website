&gt; &gt;Are you sure the info was ok?

&gt; Although I was originally given the address only as &lt; http://www.tig_dot_com &gt;
&gt; you may want to try using &lt; http://home.tig_dot_com/cgi-bin/genobject/index &gt;
&gt; which is the complete address as shown once the site displays.
&gt; 
&gt; Once in try looking up your home address. I did and got an immediate
&gt; neighborhood site map with my home identified at the 40 acre level! =)

Well it gave me a fairly boring route from Seattle to San Diego.  So I suggested 
they include a scenic search option and rate every highway for its scenicity.

Of course I volunteered the services of Caron, Lief and myself to drive every 
highyway in the database for a mere $3000/month + gas + food + maintenance.

Quite reasonable I think.
