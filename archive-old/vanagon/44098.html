 IN REGARDS TO VAN AWNING&lt; Rick Koller wrote (while camping in Fla, Keys)

gale had arrived! I ran back to the campsite where my wife was hanging on
to the awning fabric. It had begun to tear off the roller at a seam. We
both hung on to the thing for about in hour in 35 to 40mph wind and driving
rain it was too windy to roll it back up. After the storm passed I had a
tear about 2ft off the roller and I still havn't fixed it yet.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I have a story regarding the Catalina Awning- I ordered it before a
round-country-trip last summer, and it arrived damaged (by shipper)-the end
was crumpled, but functional, and  it was too late to send back, and
nearest Camping World to NJ on my trip was Ohio.  So I installed it, used
it, and when arriving at Camping World, prepared to remove it, which
requires rolling it out all the way to access mounting bolts.  It was very
windy, and a gust of wind PICKED UP ENTIRE AWNING and lifted it right over
the top of the van!  Much of the support metal was bent, and I learned a
valuable lesson on one they were going to replace anyway!   We used the
awning for 6 week trek around country, and suggest (1) when not camped
(like just opening it to shade side of car or where you sit, unroll it only
as far as needed and lock the roll- protects the more vulnerable area where
fabric enters roller slot. (2) Doing the former allows legs to be easily
tied to wheels when in a paved lot- While at most attractions we parked so
awning side FACED SOUTH and north was always self-shaded anyway, and
bungeed the bottom of leg around tire bottom. (3) further wind protection
can be achievev by running a rope from VEHICLE (not awning housing) top
around front of awning and back to van bottom; we used propane stove
supports. (4) We rolled awning out all the way only when someone was with
vehicle, like when sitting under it with folding picnic table, or when
fully staked at campground.  (5) Yes, it really takes two people to roll up
fully extended awning in a wind, since arm locks must be released while
someone holds  roller end, unless you haver very long arm span!  A
partially extended awning can easily be rolled up by one person.  (In rain,
 the awning WILL COLLECT WATER in center unless you steepen its pitch in
front of the awning by lowering legs!  SO, IF TO BE LEFT UNATTENDED, NEVER
ROLL IT OUT ALL THE WAY (3 ft. is enough to shade car)!     MB in NJ
