Polished tracks are OK, what must be avoided is pitting
galling, etc where the metal has defects you could say
easily catch a fingernail on.  Repack, put em back in
and run till they make noise or stop transmitting power,
Axles aren't that hard to pull.  As to reversing, I have
read this and it makes sense but never tried it.
