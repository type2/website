Subject: more camping updates!

Hey all,
It seems the votes have already started coming in :-) .  

I've been keeping track of all the camping mail and saving anything even
remotely related to this trip from the list.  Since my last post, I've
had a couple more folks express interest.

So let me run an idea by you folks.  Tom Forhan suggested to me a
camping location somewhere on the Eastern Shore so as to be more
convenient for the northern listers as well as the southern contingent.
This sounds like a good idea to me, I don't know travel times but Tom
seemed to indicate that it was pretty well in the middle.  This sounds
like a good place, I've heard the Eastern Shore is nice but I've never
been there myself.  Therefore, I need input from folks who have been
there.  Where is good to camp?  What else is there to do?  I need
specifics, I need names of good parks/national forests/whatever.  

Well, the location is ultimately where you folks come in.  I'm pretty
flexible, but I do want a good location that's fairly accessible to all
interested parties.  Let's also shoot for the weekend of the 7th, tho I
could possibly do both weekends if we want to split this thing up into
two factions :-) .  

I need recommendations because I do NOT know what's around/available as
far as camping sites.  I don't know what's there and I sure as hell
don't know how to get there.  So anybody with any input on that aspect
of things, PLEASE e-mail me with some information.  

As always, stragglers are welcome, send any input to me, and I hope we
have a good turnout :-)

Take care,
Sean
