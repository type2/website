'cuse me, but I thought Joel was from Alabama, not Arkansas.  Anyway, I
can sympethize with being one of only 2 listees in Louisiana (although I
thought Perry was coming to New Orleans for a spell which would make it
3).  Without a knowledgable mechanic within driving (or towing, as the
case may be) distance, this list has been a godsend.  Count me in for 3!
