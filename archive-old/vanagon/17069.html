Subject: Re: 'falia Sink Pump Questions

scott,

I beleave that you need water in the tank for it to work...at least that
is how my '83 works,  and boy did it have me scared the first time that 
happened.  There should be no problem finding a summersible water 
pump in any camping store


         or even in a Walmart.

jg '83 Westy,  '92 Passat
