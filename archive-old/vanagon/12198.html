So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm TRYING to understand this intrigue with awnings.  Why, for
&gt; example, should I want one?  Is it shade?  Can't I just park under
&gt; a tree or go inside the van for shade?  

On a hot day with not a shade tree in sight to park under, it's
nice to have a source of shade outside of the bus where there 
is more air current.  Kind of a veranda effect.  Not much but
better than inside where it can get stuffy.
