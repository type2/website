Subject:      Emmissions help

&gt;&gt; Also - any other experience with possible reasons why I failed
&gt;&gt; emmissions?


It depends on what part of the emissions test you failed. In WA they
check CO and Hydrocarbons at idle and under load. My old Mazda truck was
failing the CO under load part of the test. Here is what I did:

1) Test the engine when it is good and hot. Right off the highway if
possible. The cadilytic (sp?) converter works best when it is hot. The
last thing you want to do is sit in line for a while waiting for your
test.

if it still fails:

2) High CO means incomplete combustion (too much fuel or too little O2).
Try things that will increase the O2 like getting a high flow air filter
or temporarily removing the tube that redirects crankcase emission back
into the air intake.

I too tried the liquid emission test stuff but it made no difference in
my test scores (I even took the empty bottle back to Schucks where
&quot;satisfaction is guaranteed&quot; and got my money back. They shouldn't be
selling that crap to people.)

Anyone who knows more about this emissions stuff, please jump in and
correct me where I am wrong.

General disclaimers:
1) Your engine is trying to tell you something is wrong when your
emissions are high. Consider getting it fixed by someone you trust.
2) Don't do anything overtly illegal to try to pass emissions. If you
get caught it will cost a lot more than just fixing the original problem
would.
