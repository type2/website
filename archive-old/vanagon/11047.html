Subject: question...

Dear colleagues,

I am looking for any information about the &quot;amphibious jeep&quot; ( Ford model
GPA, also known as &quot;seep&quot; ). Where can I found a &quot;maintenance manual&quot; or any
other complete technical data of this vehicle ? I live in Poland, where
this car is a very rare vehicle. Because of that, the information I've
collected is insufficient for me.

 Greetings -

   Wojciech Borczyk
