&gt;Anybody seen the opposite effect?  I came across a modified bread-loaf in
&gt;western Arizona one year with the sliding door segment removed.  The wheel-
&gt;base on that one was pretty short.  Had a personalized plate of *Wheely* or
&gt;something similar.

there is a shorty 70 bus around town ... paint up all rainbow colors. right
now, it's sitting at a repair shop.  a while back, at a local vw show, a
fellow drove down from tennessee in a short 66 bus.  contrary to what i
thought, he said he handled pretty well on the highway. he said the only
real problem was that you had to be careful about your speed going into
sharp corners ... it felt like it wanted to tip over.

both of those buses are/were shorter than a beetle. :)
