Subject: New Person Saying Hello to All

Let me introduce myself (a few may know me, but most not). I'm Tom 
Brouillette in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I wear a couple of different 
VW &quot;hats&quot;: First, I edit a newsletter for owners an admirers of vintage 
VW buses (kombis, campers, etc.) for a club called NEATO. The newsletter 
is &quot;Old Bus Review,&quot; and I'd be glad to mail anyone a sample copy, via 
regular post. 
I also have a business here in New Mexico renting Vanagon Westfalias to 
the public (usually tourists from out-of-state).Here, too, I would be 
glad to send info to anyone about rates, etc. 
So. . . I manage a small fleet of campers, but the apple of my eye is my 
'53 Deluxe.
I'm happy to be signed on to this raging torrent of VW Type 2 mania!
P.S. A friend of mine has an '87 Synchro Westfalia for sale here.
I can be reached at: rmart_at_unm_dot_edu
Thanks much!
