&gt;&gt;&gt;  so we put a 3 pole switch in so we can control what speed we
&gt;&gt;&gt;want. I didn' know the fan has a high speed until I installed this switch.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Todd,
&gt;&gt;        I'm a relative newbie concerning the wasserboxer and its quirks but
&gt;&gt;I like your fan control setup. I would be forever in your debt if you would
&gt;&gt;clue me in or post it on the list  where you obtained your switch and what
&gt;&gt;kind of water temp guage and sending unit you used. Thanks in advance.

&gt;    I bought a high quality switch from Race Ready in San Diego. I don't
know how much current it will take but it will run 2 daylighters through the
switch (I use the same switch in the race car). I think your local buggy or
off road supply should carry Bugpack. They have good sealed switches in
several on-off configurations. The one I use has Off in the center and turns
on in either direction (High and Low).
  The water temp guage I use is a VDO (of course). I cut the hose that the
water comes out of the engine in( the Z shaped one on the right hand front
side of the engine that runs into the firewall), in half, and inserted a
stainless tube with a hole drilled into the side to screw the sender. Hose
clamped it together and wired it up. I like knowing how hot the water is
right out of the engine. It is surprising how quickly the temp goes up and
down.
