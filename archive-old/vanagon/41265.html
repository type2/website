Subject: Advice

     There is a 1984 Westfalia Wolfsburg Edition for sale on a lot near my 
     house.  It has been there for probably two months now.  I think the 
     reasons why may be that it has 105K miles, and they are asking $8995! 
     It looks as though the owners took REAL good care of it.  I am just 
     worried about the mileage.  Does anyone have an idea as to how much a 
     rebuild costs for a waterboxer?  Does anyone also have an idea as to 
     what would be an acceptable price?  Thanks
