Oh, I'm sorry, I guess drug use isn't part of the Dead Head culture.  I
guess that all the people I've ever known who were &quot;into the Dead&quot; lied
when they talked about all the drugs they took.  Nor did kids who wanted to
be part of the the &quot;Dead family&quot; take drugs to really enjoy the experience.
And I guess several close friends of mine from high school didn't screw
their lives up because of their drug influenced invlovement with being dead
heads. I apologize, my mistake.  Maybe they drive type IIs down in
Medelline.



&gt;Sorry to disagree, but this is complete bullshit. Jerry made some of the
&gt;sweetest music I've ever heard and I'd be thrilled with a vanagon list with
&gt;his image on it being on my bus.
&gt;
&gt;I've listened the the Dead since 1969. I am not now, nor have I ever been
&gt;&quot;hooked&quot; on drugs. I believe there are lots of addicts on the streetrs that
&gt;have never even heard of the Grateful Dead. The Deadheads have been
&gt;responsible for resurrecting many a bus from an early grave, fixing them up
&gt;and driving them from one show to another. For the purposes of this group, I
&gt;think this is a beautiful thing. Isn't that what we're all about here? The
&gt;perpetuation of VW busses?
&gt;
&gt;Just for the record.
