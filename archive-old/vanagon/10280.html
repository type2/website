Subject: Re: Westy Manuals - '60 out there?

danny:

I too would like to find a 1960 Westy Manual. Sorry i don't have an owners
manual for a 60' Camper, but I do have a colour sales brochure (i.e.
advertisement that show features, descriptions and measurements etc.) of a
61' Westfalia. I don't want to sell it, but I could send you a copy, and
anybody else that is interested. It is a brochure that folds out into three
pages.

For you others out there, I looked through some of the literature I have.
For your info I have the following Type II, and would be willing to send
interested people some photocopies. For the really big manuals I would have
to get people to pay for photocopying, or swap me some literature they have
(i.e. it would cost a fair amount to copy a 400 page manual and ship it to
the States)

-1967 SO 42 &quot;Camping Car&quot; Instuction Manual (Westy Manual- approx 35 pages)
-1967 VW Campmobile Parts Catalouge ( 82 pages) Part # 734 016 80
-late 60's VW Parts List (dated 2/68) Part # 735 022 20 approx 200 pages
-early 60's VW Parts List (dated Aug 63') Part # 735 032 20 approx 400 pages!
-1965 Type II owners manual (approx 40 pages)
-assorted owners manual from 73' and 74 Transporters

If anybody is interested in this stuff the can e-mail me direct.

&gt;I know this is a long shot, but since everyone's
&gt;hot for manuals, I've gotten hot also.
&gt;I will pay ooodles for a manual (copy) for my '60 camper.
