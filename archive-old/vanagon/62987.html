From:         &quot;Christopher M. Smith&quot; &lt;csmith_at_SDSC.EDU&gt;
Subject:      New VANAGON list - PLEASE READ!

        Greetings from the new VANAGON list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        VANAGON_at_GERRY.SDSC.EDU          &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

For those behind the times, Gerry Skerbitz, the current VANAGON list
administrator at the Univ Minnesota is retiring from list administration.
The VANAGON list is migrating to another server at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center in California, and will be managed by Ron Lussier
(coyote_at_likeminds_dot_com) and Christopher Smith (csmith_at_sdsc_dot_edu).

This message is to INFORM you that I have moved the VANAGON list at
lenti.med.umn_dot_edu to gerry.sdsc_dot_edu.

NOTE: All modifications, unsubscribes, subscribes to the list at the old
server that occured after Tuesday night WERE NOT incorporated in this
changeover. To make changes, send your request to listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu

PLEASE! Be aware that mail service from this server MAY be sporadic for
the next few days, while we (the admins) work out any bugs that pop up
along the way. VANAGON has a LARGE subscriber base, and our LISTSERV/LSMTP
software and server hardware may need a bit of tweaking here and there as
it deals with the volume of mail it will begin to process.

New listserv address: LISTSERV_at_GERRY.SDSC.EDU

        Use this address to change/delete your subscription

New VANAGON address:  VANAGON_at_GERRY.SDSC.EDU

        Use this address to send mail to the group

THIS IS A ONE TIME MESSAGE!

DIGEST and POSTPONE (NOMAIL on LISTSERV) subscribers will maintain the
same status on the new server.

Further instructions will follow in the next few days.

Your new VANAGON list administrators,

        Chris Smith             Ron Lussier
        csmith_at_sdsc_dot_edu         coyote_at_likeminds_dot_com
