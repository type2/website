Subject: Glow plugs and tank troubles

Hey listies,

	A lot of talk on the list lately has been about glow plugs.  I 
can't seem to find these on my '87 Syncro.  Can anyone help me?

	Also, I also have trouble filling the syncro up at the gas 
station.  As soon as I turn on the pump gas spills out all over the 
license plate and the bumper.  Real messy!  I chalked it up as a common 
vanagon problem before.  Can anyone help me with this?

PS Man do I have too much free time!
