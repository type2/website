&gt; cost? welllllll ... that's where they kinda getcha: about $70 for a pair of
&gt; reflectors and two H4 bulbs. :(

May I interject on cost behalf that one should not knock those simple
sealed beam halogen replacements available for $10 each at any parts
store.  I've used both, the H4 route with 55/65W bulbs wired straight
to the battery on my '78 (Hella from Whitless oddly enough for
reflectors, bulbs from a quality source) but on the parents '77 regular
35/65W halogen sealed.  The difference on high beams is trivial, on
low the sealeds fall behind but were MUCH MUCH better than the ancient
incandescents.  On an '84 the improvement may not be so great but
frankly on highs even the '77 has incredible lighting now, better than
my Corrado with 85/100W bulbs, something about the 7&quot; round reflector is
beneficial to proper light application.  Furthermore, I've recently
noticed local places selling 55/65W &quot;sealed&quot; halogens called &quot;super&quot; or
something by GE for $15 a pop, I'm betting as good nearly as the H4
units and I note that these are not truly sealed beam either, the
halogens still have a seperate bulb inside, it is simply not replaceable
but if the reflector only breaks you still got light I believe.  Any way
you go will be an improvement, it will be hard to overdrive any of these
lights in a Vanagon, but I note also for the ultimate in lighting, a
friend has a set of the Hella &quot;aux low beam&quot; driving lights, instead of
being a normal long range driving light or even a low low fog light
pattern these double or triple your low beam lighting area.
Unfortunately go about $120 a set I believe.
