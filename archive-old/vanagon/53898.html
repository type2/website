Subject: 97 EV Winnie at LA Autoshow

Vanatics &amp; EuroHeads,
On Sunday I visited the LA Autoshow and looked at a lot of cars, truck, &amp;
vans including the 97 VW Eurovan with the Winnibago (sp?) conversion and VR6
engine.  I'd seen this van in the dealer showroom before, so there was
nothing new to see.  
What amazed me though was the corwd of people in &amp; around this van.  They
just had one van and there must have been 30 people trying to see it at once.
 More than were looking at the new Porsche Boxster!!  They should have had at
least two of these vans to accomidate the crowd.  The price on the window was
about 24K for the van and 10K for the conversion for a total around $34,000.

For price comparison's sake the show also had a Mazda MPV with all wheel
drive that listed at over $32,000.

Since I mentioned the Boxster, I might as well mention that I saw a Vanagon
in the Porsche booth.  Well, not a &quot;live&quot; one, but about a 3-4 second clip in
an interactive  computerized Boxster video thing.  It was brown, watercooled
and a 82 to 85 model year, judging by its round headlights and 2nd front
grill.
