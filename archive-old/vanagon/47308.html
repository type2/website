Subject: Deer fur in your paint...

&lt;&lt;If you mean that you don't wash your bus either, well then yes I can.
Does painting over the deer hair count? (when the exposed flesh  . .
of the van began to rust, I cleaned up rust and painted)- Jeff&gt;&gt;

Wash it?  Wash a bus?  What a concept...do people actually WASH their 
buses?  

It was impossible to paint over the deer hair, so we tried wallpaper, but 
it didn't cover the dents.  Now we have rust.  It's a &quot;two-tone tan van&quot;, 
and it's quite 'deer' to us...&lt;tee hee...&gt;
