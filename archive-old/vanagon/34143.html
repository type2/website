Subject: poptop seal replacement





I have the Winnebago part number for the substitute poptop seal (bulb 
seal) that I discovered last weekend. It is much like the WCM model but 
better made, all rubber (no vinyl) and with a bead of sealant already 
inplace in the channel. It costs $2.95/ft Canadian, prolly cheaper in the 
US (where its made).

Anyhoo, here is the Part# 081632-01-000.
