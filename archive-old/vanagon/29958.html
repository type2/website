&gt;I didn't take the time to read the Quebec map but I'm not quite sure that
&gt;the Quebec road goes to Inuvik, maybe you have to go to Newfoundland, take
&gt;the Belle-Isle strait ferry to labrador and go north on gravel road (someone
&gt;of my family had taken these road). There is no north road in Quebec, it is
&gt;the railroad that goes from Sept-Iles to the north, the other road are justs
&gt;parts (for example from Fermont (Qc) to Labrador). There is just some small
&gt;non connecting roads between Mingan (past Sept-Iles) to Lourdes de Blanc
&gt;Sablon (near Labrador).

This is wrong. There is a brand-new, absolutely-surreal, very-long, tedious
&quot;road&quot; that goes along rail road tracks, across abandoned towns, marshes,
swamps, abandoned superhighways, mining pits, etc. that links you all the
way from Baie-Comeau to Labrador City. It is on a few maps now although most
don't show it. A giant town is listed on the maps called Gagnon but when we
got there (hoping to buy gas) we discovered that the city had been removed
down to the last stick although they still had a lot of fancy paved blacktop
and first rate sewer and gutters--but no buildings left. We were the fourth
vehicle to ever make it up this road, and when we got to labrador city we
were mobbed by the police and eveybody asking what it was like to drive in
from &quot;outside.&quot; 

Honeymoon in our 72 in about 1987 or so. Railroad tracks vibrated the van so
much the bolts in the accelerator bar unscrewed themselves and the van went
half the way at full throttle--speed control by braking and turning the key
off only. 80F degrees when we left Quebec city at 7:30 AM; snowing when we
arrived in Labrador City at 1:30pm. (That's a good time estimate for you
Tom; 18 hours between the two points.)
