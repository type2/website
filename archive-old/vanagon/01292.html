Subject: 81 Vanagon Swaybar

Just found this list in rec.autos.vw -- glad to know of it.  My first question:

My Vanagon (81 L with 2.2liter Porsche 911T six) keeps breaking the downlinks
on its front swaybar, and at $65 a pop from the dealer I'm tired of it.  Is
there an aftermarket swaybar for the Vanagon?

Thanks!
B.
