Subject: Extra seat

There's been some discussion recently about bolting in an additional bench
for extra seating when not camping. 

How about an extra seat for peaceful coexistance when traveling with three
kids? The bed/bench is really only adequate for two. Any ideas for an
additional single seat other than throwing a bean bag in? This is an 81
deluxe camper.

Thanks,

Weston
