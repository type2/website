&gt; &gt; Folks, we've been there, done that. Check the archives at:
&gt;  &gt; http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg02539&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.01
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; It explains the idea and gives the part number for a replacement wiper
&gt;  &gt; relay from VW that will give your Vanagon programable delay wipers. $35
&gt;  &gt; bucks or so, unless you dig one out the local junkyard. The you just
&gt;  &gt; replace the current relay with the new one.  Many other VW/Audi products
&gt;  &gt; have this feature: you can too!
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  Just called the dealer (Speedway in Victoria). Part # is apparently 
&gt;  now: 1HM 955 531C, and is $ 47.72 CDN.
&gt;  
&gt;  Local FLVWAPS (BowWow) told me the &quot;1HM&quot; indicates a dealer only 
&gt;  part. ie: they have a relay ending in &quot;955 531&quot;, but it's a standard 
&gt;  wiper relay. Has anyone located an alternate source for this (other 
&gt;  than used)?

Here's a source (as seen in and ad in European Car magazine:

Programmable Intermittant Wiper Relay  $25.  (US)
