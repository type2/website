Subject: 1986 heater fan dead

 
   To the hard core Vanagon Brains; 
   
   My front heat fan in my 1986 Vanagon GL is 
   now blowing fuses and making a high pitch
   squeeeel when it does run.  

   Any ideas as to a where I might drill a small
   hole to add some spray lub to the bearings???

      thanks for any information
