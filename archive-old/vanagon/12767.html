So Erik Soule says:
&gt; Well, I haven't really been involved in the whole prune deal, but I couldn't 
&gt; help but noticing that yesterday the guy who invented the prune pitter died. 
&gt; Like most prune eaters, he must have known that it was his time to go.... :b
&gt; 
&gt; (Please observe a moment of silence now)
&gt; 
&gt; Unconfirmed reports state that he was dressed in flannel 'jamas and laid to rest
&gt; in an original, unrestored '57 Westy.
&gt; 

Oh man!  Bradley must be in morning.  Sorry guy.  Must be ...the pits... ;p
