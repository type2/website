&gt; &gt; Apparently the T &amp; A magazines do research on this and &quot;most&quot; of
&gt; &gt; their male reading public do want the T &amp; A pix in the mags.  What
&gt; &gt; is true, however, is that approximately 12% of the reader base
&gt; &gt; is female.  Perhaps it would not be a bad idea for them to poll
&gt; &gt; their female readers and see if they would like Brad Pitt type
&gt; &gt; people posing with the cars.  To be &quot;fair,&quot; they could then feature
&gt; &gt; 12% of their photos in such a light.

&gt; Hey Martha. I agree whole heartedly. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing a 
&gt; Brad Pitt type posing with a car, or with a product in an advertisement. 
&gt; I wouldn't be so pinheaded to decide a product's worth by the person 
&gt; standing next to it in the ad. That is to be decided by reputation, and 
&gt; by asking you guys at Lenti their opinions. I wouldn't spend as much 
&gt; time on a page with Brad standing in his g-string, but I certainly would 
&gt; have no problem with that. I like to think I'm completely politically 
&gt; incorrect, and proud of it!

Well Jim,
You may not be a pinhead about determing the worth of your auto parts, 
but your stance on the scantily clad women in magizines and ads leads me 
to believe differently about how you determine the worth of other human 
beings.  If you MUST partake in the degradation of women, buy magazines 
devoted to that, but there is no reason why a VW (or any other car) 
magizine HAS to have anybody objectified.  
I didn't want to go on a rant about this, but how we act as VW owners, 
and whatever else we all are, has a tremendous bearing on many other 
people. It seems that you have the advantages that allow you to be 
&quot;politically incorrect and proud of it&quot; but the majority of people 
don't.  Try being considerate of other people, it really doesn't hurt... 
anyone.

Dave
