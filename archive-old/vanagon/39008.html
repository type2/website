Subject: Bile Rack for a Eurovan

I have been looking for a bike rack for the back hatch of a 1993 
Eurovan Weekender.  The products I have seen so far either rest on the 
glass window which I don't trust or attach somehow off the frame and 
block the hatch from opening.  I don't want one on top because it is too 
high.  I recently saw a bike rack on a Eurovan that attached to the top 
and bottom of the hatch. The owner said the rack had been purchased fro 
the VW dealer in Vancouver BC.  The VW dealer in Santa Barbara where I 
live had never heard of it.  Does anyone have information on VW bike 
racks?  Send information to Steve Mack, email address sbwater_at_rain_dot_org.  
Thanks
