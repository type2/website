Well, thanks to all for your support (You do realise you're all a bit 
weird don't you?).
I posted that and then commenced moving and cottage-ing so I have been 
away for a week.  Upon returning I had over 700 msgs, most of them from
you nuts and a good deal of those about my post.
Glad to be here humor as Joel is for statistics and part numbers.


Cheers
