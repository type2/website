&gt; '89 Vanagon Syncro, one owner, $4700 OBO.  970-927-0393 (Basalt)

I inquired on this one and almost bought it.  It's maroon with 170k.  The
guy has 7 kids and they don't all fit in it, so he bought a suburban.
He'll take a fair bit less.  PW, Pmirrors,PL, Alloys, 5 speed.  email me
for more info if you'd like.   Basalt is in between Aspen &amp; Glenwood
Springs.
