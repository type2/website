Subject: What $20 Bucks'll Getcha

Here's one for ya:::::&gt; Today I was out havin' a yard sale, y'know since I'm
movin' I'm a-tryin' to unload all my accumulated &quot;stuff&quot;. So it's gettin' on
past 5 o'clock and I start to pack up Ramona when this guy and his family
pull up behind us in a station wagon. He jumped out and asked about Ramona
(which, in my book, warrants mondo brownie points), and then he says, &quot;Hey,
I've got an entire VW engine, a coupla hubs and two snow tires back at my
house. I sold them to some guy three months ago and he never showed to pick
'em up after paying me. I'd give it all to you for $20.&quot; I asked what year
the Bug was that the engine came from and he guessed it was from a '71. I
thought about for around 2.9 seconds and then followed the guy to his house
about 3 miles away. I can tell you that I wasn't expecting to see a fan
housing and generator poking outta the covered beastie!!!!!! But I deeeeeed!!
Yessir, this baby is ready for bolting! Just needs a carb and distributer!!
Plus the tires and two hubs!! Cool show, huh? So...since tomorrow morning I
trek over to Kingston to visit the good folks at VW Bus Heaven....I thought I
just might offer up the stuff to knock down the bill.....good plan or what!!?
The engine's a single port..Ramona's a dual, but I even figger if something
majorly heinous turns up while their checking out 'Mona's belly, there's
gotta be a simple way to rig that up, right? Well, either way it was a really
fun find : )  Me and Ramona had us a fine Sunday. Hope you enjoyed yourn.
