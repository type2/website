Subject:      MSDS Porsche 911 engines into vanagons ...

for those of you lucky enough to have escaped the deluge of files from me,
i offer the following info (cause a couple of you were talking about it):

MSDS                         (Martin Schneider Designed Systems)
2643 Rosemead BL.            Porsche engine kits for vanagons/buses,
South El Monte, CA 91733     brake rotors/stainless steel brake hoses
(818) 448-8726               for vanagons, 'Panzer Brush Guard' - for
Fax: (818) 448-0706          mounting winches on vanagons (or just
                             keeping rocks and bushes out of your
                             grill/headlights)

there were a couple of articles in HOT VWs and in VW TRENDS about some of
the Vanagons AND Buses that he had modified with these engines. as i recall,
the conversion kit costs about $2500 (you get to supply the engine). and
before you get carried away with dreams of turbo-horsepower, only certain
engines will fit 'comfortably'.

as for Oettinger and his 6-cylinder, well, there IS a guy in southern
california that is sort of a 'distributor'. that's the good news. the bad
news is the prices. i called about a larger fuel tank for the vanagon ...
85 liters instead of 60 liter standard. the price was $800. for the fuel
tank. i'm still looking. :)
