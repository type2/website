Subject: EV or late Vanagon Westy wanted

Hi Volks,

    Since Ric Golen posted the possiblity of his EV being for sale, I've
been thinking of getting one.  I'm looking for a MV model with a poptop.
If I can't find one of those I'm in the market of a Late Vanagon Westy.  If
anyone has an leads let me know.  Thanks. Anyone wanna 82 Westy 'GTI'?
Gotta sell that before I can buy the EV.  Take care.
