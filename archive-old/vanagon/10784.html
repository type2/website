&gt; I do have 3 questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) to the right of the spedo, there is a dummy gauge, was there a factory 
&gt; option gauge for this hole?
&gt;

The dummy can be replaced by a clock.  (I got one at a swap meet {gloat, 
gloat})
 
&gt; 2) Just under the said gauge hole, there is a red light thingy with a &quot;B&quot; on 
&gt; it.  Anyone know what this is?

That is, I believe your brake warning light.  Depending on the year, the 
test is (A) it comes on when you push it (B) it comes on when your key is 
in the start position or (C) it comes on when the parking brake is on.  
In any event, its true function is to come on when one of your dual brake 
circuits has failed.  In my '78 the light is yellow, and comes on with 
the parking brake, but not the start circuit.  The Bentley manual says it 
should, but the VW dealer says it shouldn't.  On my '71 SB it was push to 
test.  When the switch in test occured, I dunno, YMMV.

&gt; 3) I found out that I have a frozen heater cable on the right side.  Any 
&gt; ideas short of replacing it?

No, and a messy, messy job it is too.  The only suggestion I have is 
spray in a ton o' WD-40, work it from both ends and pray.  I am, however 
90% sure it will break.  Getting the old one out and a new one threaded 
in the rust-clogged tube will be a ton o' fun.  Sorry to be so negative, 
but I done this before. I have always wished for a 6 foot .22 caliber 
cleaning rod when faced with this.  If you get a new cable, stop by VW 
and get new tube end seals, fit them and spray in as much white lithium 
grease as you can.
