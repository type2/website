Subject:       Fram Oil filters

Steve J. says:
&gt; Well, if I have to use a Fram, I'll only use it in the warmer months
&gt; because it doesn't have the OEM filters built in by-pass valve. 
If I looks into the hole on a Fram I see a little projection 
sticking up from the bottom of the filter with what looks like a 
spring on it.  Could this be the bypass valve?

&gt; I've also not used the Fram filter for quite a while.
Wierd thing.  Last winter, there were 3 of us with different vehicles 
that started having flickering oil lights at hot idle.  All of us had 
changed oil and filter recently.  the VW dealer even said he'd gotten 
a few service complaints at that time.  He was wondering if the 
refineries had shipped out a batch of 'thin' oil but that seemed 
highly unlikely, and we were using different brands.  I know at least 
2 of these vehicles were using Frams.  I wonder if they made a change 
(new improved etc) that has affected this.
