&gt;&gt;&gt;There is an 86 Wolfsburg Weekender  (the WWW) which had the following:
&gt;&gt;&gt;Fold down rear seat (into bed)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Refrigerator
&gt;&gt;&gt;Westy Poptop
&gt;&gt;&gt;Alloy wheels
&gt;&gt;&gt;Fiberglass bumpers

Then Chris wrote:
&gt;  I don't think so, unless someone added the wheels and bumpers themselves.
&gt;  Fiberglass bumpers weren't introduced until '87, and then they were only
on
&gt;  the Wolfsburg Ed. 7 passenger vans. Ditto with the alloy wheels. 

Then Dave wrote back:
&gt; I believe you are wrong, the 86 wolsburg had black fiberglass bumpers, mags

&gt; and black non-power/non-heated mirrors

Now Jim chimes in:
The 1986 Wolfsburg model was based on the basic (non-GL) 1986 Vanagon Camper
 but did NOT have the fiberglass bumpers.  Both Alloy wheels and power
mirrors were optional in 1986, so either of those may appear on this model.
The fiberglass bumpers appeared first on the 1987 Vanagon GL WLE and they
were silver metallic.  In 1988 all the Vanagons had the fiberglass bumpers,
Vanagon GL and Camper GL in black, but only the WLE version had silver ones
and matching silver &quot;rocker&quot; panels along the sides.
