Subject: Dormobile Tops &amp; other junkyard finds


Went to Alabama today to negotiate the price on a top off a '66
Dormobile to go on my '65 Sundial Camper.  The guy said it could 
be mine for $100.  Does this sound like a fair price?

I popped it up and there were no tears in the vinyl sides and 
there were no broken bows.  There were two cots in the top, one 
with the canvas intact, the other with cargo netting.  Was this 
how they came?

The glass skylights were fine, but one of the ventilation lids 
was missing, with a piece of plywood in it's place.  Anyone know 
a source for the lids?

Unfortunately the interior cabinets were totally thrashed.  NOTHING 
salvageable from them.

He also had a '70 Dormobile that was missing one piece of skylight 
glass.  This one had the front half of the cabinetry, but it was 
severely water damaged (under the missing skylight).

He also had a '63 westy that had a few interior cabinets and the 
jump seat left in it.  My heart skipped a beat when I saw the 
submarine hatch, because I have been looking for a few pieces for my 
'60 Westy for almost a year now.  Different interior, though.  It did 
still have an Eberspacher in it though.  I may pick that up.  

Any answers for the Dormobile top would be appreciated.

Dave
