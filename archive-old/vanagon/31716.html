Subject: Teflon Piston buttons.

all,

Having seen a lot of failed pistonclips in VW flat fours,
i decided that i'm going to use the Teflon Piston Buttons,
any reason why i shouldn't? I have no experience with
them, they are fairly uncommon on this side of the ocean,
i know they are available in different sizes. Are there
quality differences between the several brands/suppliers?

Thanks,

Brian.
