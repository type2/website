Subject: That IS strange!

	Bill Killian wants a bus-nose display case for his
living room... I gotta admit- opening Safari windows DO make it
practical as a storage cabinent... still, er, well, as long
as its the front of something from Pick N Pull or whatever,
I guess, go for it! Let us know how it goes? San Jose Pick and Pull
has a 59 pickup last time I looked. Now most of the time, these
are in pretty rough shape- would that add or detract from the theme? :^)

Maybe the thing to do is buy a cheap, rough, nose and pound it out yourself,
paint gently and there you are. Doesn't actually have to be safe, weatherproof,
etc. Good practice for the do-it-yourself bodyperson?

	The hot setup, of course, would be to put about the
last foot of the back end on the OTHERSIDE of the same wall-
the back is more practical cabinent, since it has 2 hatches for 
acccss. That's it, sure, its practical! :^)

	Cheers!
	Bill
