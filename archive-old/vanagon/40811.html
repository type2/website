the new, painted, made in Denmark pipe I got from parts place is corroding 
faster than used OEM pipes i got from SO CAL.

|I need to replace everything.  Front, back, connector, catalytic, muffler
|and pipe.  I've priced the dealer and would rather buy a nice used car.
|I've checked the Parts Place in MI and still find them high (plus have 
heard
|one bad story about their exhaust components).  Now I'm thinking of having 
a
|muffler/exhaust shop be creative and just put to-gether some pipes hook it
|all together and see if it works.
|
|Anybody with a more solid solution?
