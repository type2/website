&lt;&lt;quote&gt;Bobbing to the surface of the Mediterranean, the
&gt;wagon sank in 232 feet of water 20 minutes later when a
&gt;rescue line _tied to a door handle_ (emphasis mine) was
&gt;pulled tight--and opened the door, filling the bus with
&gt;water.&lt;unquote&gt;

There is no truth to the rumor that the title to the bus was in Teddy 
Kennedy's name.
