Subject: Vanagon TV siting

Vanagonuts,

A couple weeks ago I watched an episode of the TV show JAG.  It was set in
Ireland and had considerable footage of a fairly late model Vanagon
(Transporter there?) which was right hand drive.  You'd expect RHD in Ireland
I suppose, driving on the left hand side of the road and all, but what was
really odd was that the single sliding door was also on the RIGHT side!
 Really odd!  Did anyone else see this?
Has anyone else seen this odd arrangement elsewhere?
