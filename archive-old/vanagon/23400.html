Subject:       Re: clogged heat riser

Sean asks:
&gt; the heat riser tube on the intake manifold is
&gt; clogged with carbon.  I've tried jamming a coat hanger in both ends and had a little
&gt; success at getting some pretty good sized chunks of carbon out of it.  I
&gt; can't get it to go all the way through for anything though, and I'm concerned
&gt; that even if/when I do, it won't be totally clean inside and will just clog
&gt; up again.  Are there any good chemicals or anything else that may aid in
&gt; cleaning it out?  Any help would be much appreciated.

and i reply &lt;jumping up and down like a kid that has to go pee&gt;  &quot;Try 
This!&quot;

use the 'trick' for cleaning EGR tubes clogged with carbon.  Fill it 
with ATF and heat it with a profane torch.  As i haven't personally 
tried this, please let me know how it works!
