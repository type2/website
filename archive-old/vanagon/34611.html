Subject: I feel like a outcast at my VW dealership

Hi,
   I read you post on &quot;The Vanagon List&quot; about VWoA home page. I like what
you sent in.  I felt like a outcast at my dealership.  I walk up to the
parts counter and ask about air-cooled parts and they almost laugh.  I can
imagin what they say when I leave.  'Check out that dweeb.  Air-cooled
parts. Get real.HAHAHAHAHA. Beetle parts,HAHAHAHAHA. Bus parts?
HAHAHAHAHAHA. If its not '90 or newer forget it.'  Actually, since I joined
the ranks of professional mechanics, the parts guys aren't so bad. I
started working at a FLAP store 4 years ago then moved onto a GM dealership
turning wrenches.  Since then I've gotten to know the guys at the VW
dealership pretty good. They help me out quite well now. I guess
presistance is the key. Let them see your face enough and they'll get the
idea your serious about your hobbie.   As far as the salesmen, I haven't
quite gotten to know them as well, yet. Anyway I jst wanted to say I like
your post.  My sentiments exactly!  Thanks and take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
