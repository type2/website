I want my mommie!  (Or at least a nice story from Unca Joel!)  :)
After twice getting my bus back from the garage that sold it to me
with less-than satisfactory tuning, I took it to another shop
and was told that the reason it won't stay in tune and gets 13 mpg (!)
is that the carbs (Now I really hate the fact that it's a dual carb!)
need to be rebuilt, at a cost of $1000.  Is there an alternative?
Or have I spent $3000 dollars on a 20-year old vehicle just to spend
another $1000 three months later?

Boy, round trip from Palo Alto to Palm Springs is gonna be expensive
at 13 mpg!

wimper, wimper...
