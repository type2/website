&gt; He is right.  The case was designed to mate with no sealant at all!  When

&gt; I did).  Don't know if it was avation RTV or not.  It was a dark brown
&gt; color and did not smell like it was silicon based.  If you want I can dig
&gt; out the can sometime and see what it's called.

You mean the Permetex stuff?  It's what I use, comes in the 
'enough-to-build-a-million-engines' bottle.  About 4 ozs I'd guess.
