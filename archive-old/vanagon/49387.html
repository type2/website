Subject: Re: Dogs on CCC's Mammoth Trip

&gt; 
&gt; This is NOT a &quot;park&quot; - This is public land that is administered by USDA 
&gt; Forest Service where the rules and regulations are completely different 
&gt; from those on public lands which are administered by USDI National Park 
&gt; Service. It is important to remember that all public lands are not 
&gt; administered by the same federal agencies and that these two agencies 
&gt; have completely different management philoshophies. Having areas, on 
&gt; USFS lands, that allow people the freedom to hike with their dogs is 
&gt; part of the plan. If members of the public prefer not to be around 
&gt; other people's dogs, they should spend their vacation time on National 
&gt; Park lands where dogs are strictly prohibited anywhere except in 
&gt; developed areas - where they must be leashed at all times!
&gt; 
&gt; Just to clarify the rules on the INYO National Forest, where this trip 
&gt; is taking place, dogs need to be on leashes that are no longer than 6 
&gt; feet in length while they are in developed areas, such as campgrounds, 
&gt; Visitor Centers, Interpretive Sites and in areas that are posted as 
&gt; such. Dogs are allowed to be off leashes on trails as long as they are 
&gt; controlable by sight or sound.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps!
