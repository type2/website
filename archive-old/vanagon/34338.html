&gt; 
&gt; If all of us could put together a rig attaching a boat to our vans, but
&gt; so that either could tow the other (the van towing the boat on land, and
&gt; the boat somehow carrying the van on water, obviously), then we could
&gt; literally go anywhere!  I haven't been able to solve yet the dilemma

 Hmmm. I remember seeing some TV program a few years ago about some
 guy that decided he was going to walk across the English channel.
 Basically he made a giant inflatable `Hamspter wheel' type affair
 (obviously no gaps in it though). He stood inside and walked and 
 walked and walked....and the thing slowly bobbed its way across the 
 water. (Dunno if he made it though).

 Surely all you need is a scaled up version, and you could *drive* your 
 bus across??? ;)
