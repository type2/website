&gt;&gt; I've seen the bed fold out for the EV, I think your down to 
&gt;&gt; somewhere between a twin and a full-size bed.  It's more of a 
&gt;&gt; single purpose vehicle than the Vanagon Multivan. 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;Veery Eeenteresting...considering the EV is as wide as the
&gt;Vanagon. I guess its because the outer walls of the EV are 2 feet
&gt;thick  :-)


My folks have a '93 EV and I have an '84 Vanagon, and the Vanagon is
defenitly wider.  The salesman told my parents that the EV was bigger on the
inside than the Vanagon, but then they bought it and rode around in it
for a while then got in my Vanagon and commented on &quot;gee, this thing is
wider than the EV, isn't it?&quot;.  We got home and measured, the EV is quite a
bit narrower.  They also noticed how close the front seats are together and
how much harder it is to walk through them than in the Vanagon (Which was
their former vehicle).

Not to flame the EV, overall they love it.  They needed something more
reliable than the stupid wasserboxer.  They are planning on driving it like
crazy, like they did with the Vanagon!!!
