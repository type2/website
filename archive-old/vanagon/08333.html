Subject: Re: Syncro Westy found! But...

Tom,  We travel in Canada each summer and very often stop to look at Westys
and others.  We tried once to bring one home with us (two summers ago) and
were told the vans were the same as those in the U.S. market but without
the &quot;certified approval&quot;  and we were advised to only consider those that
came from the states in the first place.  So be carful,  They may
phisically meet the requirments, but they may not meet the paper
requirments.

&gt;     3. Its a Canadian vehicle. Any experience with importing into
&gt;     the U.S? I know the duty is 2.5%, and the seller maintains that
&gt;     an 87 will meet &quot;U.S. requirements&quot;, whatever that means, presumably
&gt;     EPA and DOT. I am checking this out with the government agencies
&gt;     myself, but wonder if any of you have gone down this path before...?
