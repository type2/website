Due to untimely schedule conflicts for a number of our members, leaving
so few of us to go camping, I move that we postpone this weekend's
camping trip, and head for Panamint Springs in 2 weekends from now.
I feel badly about this, but it seems to be ok with everyone, so
guess this feels like the right way to go.

In the meantime, since I was raring to go camping, I'm sort of
thinking it would be fun to do maybe a one nighter this weekend
somewhere locally near the bay area.  Any takers?
