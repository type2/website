Recent topical fiction by a good friend of mine. Flames to my personal
account so they can be catenated and dumped, please. ;)

&gt;
&gt;His master's voice...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A Ramblin' Gamblin' Willie story by Greg Swann
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I laid down with CNN on, which is simply an engraved invitation to
&gt;weird dreams. I was just going to put my head on the pillow for a
&gt;minute, but you know how that goes: in a blink I was drowsing,
&gt;snoozing. Not conscious, really, but never fully asleep. It's the
&gt;twilit Neverland of fleeting juxtapositions, not entirely a bad place
&gt;for me to be.
&gt;
&gt;And I like watching CNN, for the simple reason that I love the
&gt;contrasts of absurdity. On CNN, the field reporters are so smart and so
&gt;energetic, and the anchormannequins, with the exception of show-horse
&gt;Bernie Shaw, are so stupid and so lazy. I have the idea that CNN
&gt;administers a very easy intelligence test to on-air recruits, and, if
&gt;you fail it, you have to stay in Atlanta and pretend to understand the
&gt;words you see on the TelePrompTer. To compensate, to keep things fair,
&gt;you get unlimited free access to the company tanning beds.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, the dream wasn't all that interesting at first. It began with
&gt;William Jefferson Clinton, the blow-dried object lesson on the dire
&gt;consequences of casual bastardy, giving a folksy little speech to a
&gt;captive audience of besuited business types.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I thank you all for coming here,&quot; he was saying, &quot;and proving to the
&gt;American people that the era of big government is over. It's
&gt;public-private partnerships like the agreement we've come to today that
&gt;are the path to our future. You good people have given us something
&gt;today we never coulda gotten on our own, and you've handed it over
&gt;voluntarily. Ain't that somethin'!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Clinton grinned like the cat that got the canary and in the dream the
&gt;dream CNN flashed a picture of the besuited audience members, each of
&gt;whom was holding a gun to his own head and shouting, &quot;You vill do as
&gt;you are told!&quot; That's the weird juxtaposition part, in case you're
&gt;confusing this with the real CNN. On the real CNN, they would have
&gt;flashed a showy graphic and an overtanned moron would have mangled an
&gt;internet address. Try to keep the distinction in mind, because things
&gt;are only going to get weirder.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Now,&quot; said Clinton, &quot;when our children see violence on TV, we'll know
&gt;that it's violence initiated and directed by Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh.
&gt;Not the random, senseless violence of entertainment, but the random,
&gt;senseless violence of the omnipotent state. Not good guys versus bad
&gt;guys. Not even Hollywood's nihilistic vision of bad guys versus bad
&gt;guys. No, from now on, thanks to you, the only violence on television
&gt;will be completely remorseless assassins versus unarmed women and
&gt;children, for days and months on end. Ain't that somethin'!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Clinton paused to let the wonder of it all sink in. &quot;And now, when our
&gt;children see or hear about sex on television, we'll have the solace of
&gt;knowing that the people involved are of Cabinet rank or above. We've
&gt;got to protect our children, and you folks are to be commended for
&gt;realizing that. As my wife says, 'It takes a village to raise a
&gt;child.'&quot;
&gt;
&gt;At those words, the dream CNN flashed an image of an army of
&gt;functionaries, teachers and social workers and guidance counselors in
&gt;blousy oxford shirts and boxy herringbone skirts. Each of the
&gt;functionaries had a single child locked in a half-nelson, and the
&gt;children were intoning in unison, &quot;The era of big government is over.
&gt;The era of big government is over. The era of big government is over.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I thank you all,&quot; said Clinton, &quot;for voluntarily setting the global
&gt;village of electronic communications to the important task of raising
&gt;America's children the way my wife wants them raised. I hope you know
&gt;we never coulda done it without you!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Clinton shook his head slowly, as if still unable to comprehend his
&gt;good fortune. &quot;We _never_ coulda done it without you. I mean that,
&gt;folks, from the bottom of my heart. Never, never, never! With all of
&gt;the firepower at Ms. Reno's command, we never coulda blasted through
&gt;that danged ol' first amendment. And here you've gone and done it for
&gt;us, all on your own! And Ms. Reno didn't even have to draw her gun, she
&gt;just kinda adjusted her gun-belt a little. Ain't that somethin'!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Clinton nodded toward the ever-dowdier Janet Reno before continuing.
&gt;&quot;They say Napoleon Bonaparte wished that humanity had one neck, so he
&gt;could chop it off. Don't seem very civilized to me. But I look out
&gt;there and I see fiber optics and I see the merging of cable TV and long
&gt;distance telephone and I see wide-band internet traffic and cellular
&gt;waves and broadcast waves and microwave relays and earth-satellite
&gt;links and on and on and on. And at the center of it all, I see Ms. Reno
&gt;or someone just like her. But she isn't holding a gun and she isn't
&gt;holding Napoleon's axe. No, she's holding a choke-chain, a leash that
&gt;rewards the dogs who know how to cooperate and punishes the ones who
&gt;don't. And that's the _civilized_ way to run a government, don't you
&gt;think?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;And the dream CNN cut away to a shot of the audience, still holding the
&gt;guns to their own heads, and I'll be damned if they weren't nodding and
&gt;smiling and wagging their metaphorical tails. A choke-chain is a small
&gt;price to pay, after all, for a big bowl of crunchy meat by-products.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The fact of it is,&quot; said the blow-dried Bastard-in-Chief, &quot;I like to
&gt;think of America as a big ol' dumb dog, too dumb to know he's being
&gt;ordered around by his own fleas. Now the fleas sure do need that dog,
&gt;can't live without him. But, surer 'n hell, that dog don't need them
&gt;fleas! And it's public-private partnerships like the agreement we've
&gt;come to today that'll keep that ol' dog from catching on. The words
&gt;&quot;censorship&quot; and &quot;voluntary&quot; just don't go together. You can't use 'em
&gt;in the same sentence, no way, no how. And yet, here we are today with
&gt;an agreement that will bring about the voluntary self-censorship of the
&gt;entire communications industry!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;And William Jefferson Clinton smiled the folksy, down-home smile of
&gt;naked, ruthless evil. &quot;Ain't... that... _somethin!&quot;_
