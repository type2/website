Subject:      stuff from the new vwtrends

well, folks ... Da Bus Trip has been beat, before it began. :(

in the january issue of vw trends, they have a little 2-pager about the
vw club of indonesia.  seems they got together this past august and
drove around together.

all 904 of them. :)  yup. nine hundred four beetles, buses, and whatevers.
in one picture, an aerial view of a six-lane highway, there must be at
least a hundred buses going down 2 lanes of one side.

and on the other side, going in the opposite direction, is another bus ...
looks like a 68-79. either he's lost, or really confused about what all those
folks on the other side are doing. ;)

another picture shows a parking lot ... it looks like the good old days
when they unloaded the boats from germany: hundreds of beetles, with bunches
of buses in the background.

wow. :)

joel
