Subject: Rear brakes squeel, '81 van

I recently re-did the rear brakes - shoes and drums - on my '81 and I'm 
getting a squeel and grinding sound when I apply the brakes.  If I was 
getting this sound on my bike I'd adjust the toe-in, but that obviously 
doesn't apply here. :)  Or does it?  Is this sound coming from the square 
ends of the brake pads rubbing against the drum?  Would chamfering the 
ends of the brake pads help?  Any other suggestions?
