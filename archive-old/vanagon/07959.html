Subject: Brown Vanagon Seat For Sale

With all this writing about seats I thought I would mention that I still have
a beautiful brown unused Vanagon seat for sale. This would interest an owner
of an early 80s vanagon who had a seat they had damaged or who wanted to add
another seat to the middle of the van near the sliding door.
