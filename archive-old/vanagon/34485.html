  &gt;      I'm looking for an alternative to pencils for blocking the lines. 

I tend to use phillips screwdrivers, or 1/4 inch extensions.  If you want to be
really fancy you can get some metal rod of the correct diameter and cut a 
couple of  4-6 inch pieces, file the ends smooth, and use them. Tighten the 
clamps down again
if you're going to leave it like that for an extended period.
