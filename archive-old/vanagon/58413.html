&gt; Top lever (1) in the left position directs the flow of air to the floor, in
&gt;  the right position it directs the flow of air to the floor and to the
upper
&gt;  dash top vents for defrosting.

No.  The top lever only opens &amp; closes air flow to the windshield vents.  It
might &quot;seem&quot; as though it controls air to the floor when the floor vent is
open, because as you close the dash vents, more are will be naturally forced
to the open vents.

&gt;  Second lever (2) from the top is the heat setting - in the left most
&gt;  position is the natural, unheated air temperature, and as you move this
&gt;  lever to the right the heater core will start warming up the air flow.
&gt;  
&gt;  Third lever (3) down is another directional switch - moving it from the
&gt;  left to the right will start increasing the amount of airflow to the two
&gt;  air ducts on the opposite ends of the dash, the duct to the left of the
&gt;  instrument panel and the one to the right of  the glove box.

No. This lever controls airflow to the floor area.  Again, it might &quot;seem&quot;
directional as you close it off, more air comes out any open vent.  The air
through the dash vents is indepently controlled by the lever on the vent
itself.

&lt;snip&gt;

None of the control levers acts to &quot;switch&quot; flow from one vent to another,
but merely to open/close it's own vent.  The little cryptic pictures on the
lever frame attempt to convey this.  The windshield air lever (top one) has a
little arrow pointing up - towards the windshield.  The floor air lever
(third from top) has a little arrow pointing down - towards the floor.  And
the rear ceiling vent lever has a four little &quot;slits&quot; in the picture
depicting the four rear vents.
