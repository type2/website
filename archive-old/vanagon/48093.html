Subject: Another LED application

Several of us have installed manual over-ride switches to control our 
radiator fan circuits when we want them on rather than wait until the 
radiator switches finally, if ever, kick in.  Some fans have never been 
heard to automatically come on despite full scale temp meter readings.  I 
propose that it might be nice to parallel drive each fan circuit with an 
LED visible from the driver's position.  The high speed fan operation can 
be heard while driving under 60 mph, but not its low speed operation.  
This would be interesting information to have while driving. 
  I posted instructions on how to install a switch for this earlier.  Now 
I call upon our Zen and the art of LED color selection advisors to tell 
us what color lamps should be selected for each of these two speeds.
