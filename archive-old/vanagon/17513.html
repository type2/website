Subject: My 71' bus update

Being that I am out of school, I have been catching up on my bus maintenance.
So far, I have greased the front end, welded on the window (wow, it really 
does roll up and down), ran conduit under the bus, and greased 4 CV's.  The 
conduit was a real good idea, as it only takes like 3 min. to pull another 
wire from the engine compartment to the dash.  I used 1/2&quot; ENT conduit, and 
it took 2 10' pieces.  I also hooked up the tach after pulling the said 
wire.  I have decided that doing the CV's isn't one of the greasyist jobs on 
the VW, rather it is the greasyist.  

About the tach- does anyone know what the redline is for a stock 1600?  I 
had it out on the highway, and got up to 76 mph in 4th at 4400.  I thought 
that 4400 was the redline, but I'm not sure.

Also, I hauled a 250 amp TIG welding machine in my 71.  I think that the 
welder weighs around 500 pounds, and she hauls that no problem.  I measured 
the bumper height both before and after unloading the machine and she only 
sat 1/4&quot; lower!  I don't think one can say that about any half-pint pickup!  

Yep, busses rule.
