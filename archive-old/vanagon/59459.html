Subject:      Re: Recall info...

it was for the little plastic square fuel &quot;filter&quot;. supposedly it cracked
and leaked. the recall was to replace the filter with straight hose and
put a big mutha filter behind the pump. takes about 1.5 hours and is free.

at least, that's what the PW recall was. according to my records. and it's
listed as for any &quot;1986 through early model 1989 Volkswagen Vanagon and
Camper vehicles&quot;.
