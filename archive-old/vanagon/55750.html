&gt; &gt; How about doing some phenomenal trip with both groups in the year 2000...

&gt; &gt; How about a marathon trip to somewhere REALLY obscure for most of
&gt; &gt; us - like Tierra del Fuego?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Food for thought....

&gt; Today my wife and I started our Spanish Language Study program. 
&gt; 2000 or bust, here we come.

I've just finished reading Ted Simon's &quot;Jupiter's Travels&quot; (again!) - 
around the World on a Triumph motorbike in 4 years in the mid '70s.  
Great descriptions of  'epics' at the bottom of S. America.  I guess 
this idea came up at the right time!

Count us in!  Now how the hell do I get the van across from Europe?

BTW my wife is Spanish, so we have at least one  interpreter!
