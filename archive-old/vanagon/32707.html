This message from me (at home) to Bob Hoover is forwarded to the list in the 
hope that somebody else won't make the same mistake.  Many thanx to Bob for his 
help.

This message is brought to you by the letters F (for frustrated) and 
S (for stupid).
     
After futzing around for a day and a half double and triple checking 
EVERYTHING, I did a compression check and discovered I had no 
compression - nada!  After the immediate rush of sh*t subsided, I got 
my dial indicator out, mounted it on #1 and checked to make sure 
mechanical timing was OK (it was, thank God!)  Then I started 
examining the valve and rocker geometry and realized that I had 
grossly misinterpreted Bergmann's (rather vague) instructions for 
installing the rocker arms, pushrods, adjusters, etc.  Found that 
Bergmann had not shortened pushrods at all, as advertised.  Also 
failed to take into account the effect of the cylinder spacers I 
installed to lower CR and the effect of the new heads.  At any rate - 
the valves were under pressure and open all the time.  So I consulted 
with the local gurus at Painter's Grinding - and did the following
     
1)  shimmed up rocker arm assemblies
2)  ground the adjuster ends of the rockers off a little bit (&lt; .05&quot;) 
to provide more adjustment - was     careful not to get into oil 
passages in rockers.
     
With the clearance that this provided, Bergmann's instructions and 
your advice became much more clear.  So I adjusted the valves at 0. 
00&quot; + 1 turn and fired it up.
     
It ran - started on the first crank of the starter.  Ran it for about 
15 minutes per your sermon, shut it down and changed oil and filter.  
No indications in the oil.  Cranked it up again and adjusted the 
Weber progressive.  Continued with break-in process.  Have about 2 
hours on it now, it's running great - better than the old stock 
engine ever did - starting to cool down and to show signs of the 
power it should have once everything is worn in a little.  The 
jetting on the Weber seems to be about right, I'll run it by the 
local emissions guru and have him put it on the machine after 500 mi 
or so to check for sure.
     
Bob, thanks again for all your advice.  It made doing this a lot 
easier.
     
My next project is to try to get enough pieces together out of what's 
left of the old engine from the super bug and the other engine I 
bought for the near-new case that was on it to build another engine.  
Once that's done, I'm going to try to transform myself from a 
wannabus to a gottabus.  All the time around here we see ads like - 
VW bus for sale, low price, no engine (or blown engine - or doesn't 
run, whatever).  With luck, I can find one with old Grateful Dead 
decals to drive my wife crazy and corrupt the kids in the 
neighborhood.  With even more luck, it will be in better than &quot;good 
condition.&quot;
     
thanx again.
