&gt; 
&gt; Curious: does the sound peak at 58-60 and then decline above say 65 or get
&gt; worse? If the former it could be some kind of &quot;sympathetic harmonic
&gt; vibration&quot;. I have noticed this in my KG and Westy but it may occur in other
&gt; engine types as well - DC
Well, say I just downing more grits,
We were not able to get much about 65 but it did not seem to go away.
I will try tonight right after I eat more grits.
