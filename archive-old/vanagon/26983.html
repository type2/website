Subject: Re[2]: Best Dealer To Buy Parts From (Don't Skip This Post)

     Joel said, among other things:

&gt;one thing for us east-of-the-rockies folks to consider about this dealer
&gt;in AZ: he closes AFTER we get off work!! so we can get home, call his
&gt;800- number, and he'll still be open.  this has always been a problem
&gt;with me calling the guy in Atlanta (who closes an hour before i get off
&gt;work).


...and through the miracle of time zones, if the western dealer has it
in stock, he can Fedex it to you for next day  delivery.  I did this once,
discovering at 7pm on Friday that I needed a part. Called a NV dealer, and
had  it delivered to my door Saturday morning, just after finishing my coffee!
