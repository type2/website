&gt; dave I once replaced the engine in a 73 westy. I think that you ca n only
&gt; remove the gearbox &amp; engone as a unit so that is the answer, you have to take
&gt; them both out together and it is a tricky job slided the unit down and out

Ummm... Sam, I know for sure that the engine can be removed without
dropping the tranny.  It's not really that hard, but definately harder
than the 71 and earlier setup.
