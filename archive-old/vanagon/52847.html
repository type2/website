Subject: THE BEST BOOK FOR VANAGON REPAIR

Since I have moved out to Louisiana I have found it hard to find anythng
VW related. Can anyone reccommend a good shop manuel for an '84 VW
Westfalia? Seems Bently is the book of choice. Is this so? Where can I
get the best deal on one? Anyone want to get rid of an old used book?

Thanks for any info.

Talk about covered in mud, you should see our Westfalia after camping in
the swamp...
