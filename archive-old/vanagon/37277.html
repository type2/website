Greaaat!  Any ideas as to:

B) Where I can get a replacement (not necessarily NOS but HEY! when
dreaming dream big I always say!)

&gt;&gt; My '68 Bus has a Solex 30/31 PICT Carburetor.  Can some one identify the

&gt;&gt; would rather just have everything as it &quot;was&quot; so I can look at the entiure
&gt;&gt; engine as '68/'69
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks

&gt;&gt; -MarlinThat would be the Brosol 30/31PICT carb.  Modern Brazilian carb.  It
&gt;is commonly sold as a 34PICT replacement, with an adapter base.
