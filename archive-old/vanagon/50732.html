Subject: Westy inside view, host=?ISO-8859-1?Q?=3F?=


Hello,

I just scanned some pics. I have a picture of a (high roof)
Westy which is cutted into pieces.

Is someone out there running a web page about Westies?

I would send him this picture (1.2 MB) in PCX format. It
need some work to offer it on the web.
