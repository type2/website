Subject: New Mexico VW Parts Place........

Just wanted to pass on an address for VW parts and VWs in general in New 
Mexico.  This is the place I posted before, but didn't have the address 
or telephone number.  So here ya go.

Continental Specialties
Alan Youmans
21056 Hwy 70 W.
PO Box 1112
Alamogordo, NW 88310

  This place still has a few single and DBL cabs and early busses 
sitting in the lot as well as a bunch of bugs etc.  He tells me he can't 
sell them as parts (ie no salvage license) but seemed like he may be 
able to be convinced to do otherwise.
