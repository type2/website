Subject: Re: Clicking in wheels...


 &gt;OK, so now I got another wierd thing going on with my '86 Westy.
 &gt;It is a heavy clicking that seems to be comming from the wheel(s) that is 
 &gt;rotational (it speeds up when I do) and then goes away when there appears 
 &gt;to be enough rotational speed to keep whatever it is in place. This is 
 &gt;not a heavy metal sound, but neither does it sound &quot;tinny&quot;.
 &gt; 

The sound my wheels ('81 Westy) make is more like a &quot;tink!&quot;, to give the
technical explanation.  I traced this to the aluminum wheel covers.  The
way to check this is to remove all the covers and see if it goes away.
If not then it's bearings.

Obtw, I've tried everything I can think of to get the wheel covers to stop
making that sound, to no avail.
