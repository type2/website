Subject: Re: battery tray comparisons..opinions?


&gt;these are metal...i dunno if i want to keep a piece of wood in the engine
&gt;compartment on a permanent basis...danish vs. brazilian is much
&gt;better...and in my case it's gonna have to be welded in cuz most of the
&gt;old battery try and metal is gone.

why metal?? Why not wood?? Plastic trays are a dime a dozen, so to speak.
If the engine compartment floor is rotten, cut out the rust, spot weld some
sheet metal, and put the plastic tray on top of that. I still say that $$45
for a battery tray is a scam. You could buy something meaningful with that
jack.
