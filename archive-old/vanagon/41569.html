Subject:  tire stores in British Columbia??

this is not a &quot;what kind of tire&quot; question...

i'm looking to buy new tires for my van, and would like to
shop around...
does anyone know of any good shops in either vancouver, calgary,
edmonton or points between???

i will be travelling from Whitehorse in two weeks, and these are 
the prices here:

Mich. &quot;grip&quot; 185/75R14 65PSI max-$148(on sale), $196(reg)(plus 7% tax)
unknown      195/75R14 65PSI max-$153.60 (plus 7% tax)

from Blaskin &amp; Lane, Calgary Alberta
Conti. LS20 185/75R14 65PSI max-$117.45 (plus 7% tax)

if i could get phone numbers, i can call them myself...
(what is the p.tax in B.C. 9%?)

(inuvik guys : bring many spare tires with you)
