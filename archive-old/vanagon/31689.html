Subject: Drain Plug?  What's a Drain Plug?
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1996 09:54:57 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


All this discussion of drain plugs reminded me of an oddness I
encountered on the Wombat ('58 microbus, roughly a '71 engine).
There's the usual round plate underneath the engine where you'd expect
to find a drain plug, but it's a smooth plate -- no hole for a drain
plug.  The plate itself is held on by the usual handful of studs, and
looks to have been made this way.  Almost like somebody didn't get
around to drilling and tapping a hole for the plug.

The questions become:

- does this seem weird to anyone else?
- why would you want to have such a plate?
- would there be any harm in replacing it with a normal one (this is
  probably covered by the answer to the previous question)?

Thanks.
