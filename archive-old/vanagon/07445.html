	John,
	I've been given a hint that they are available, and difinitive
information is promissed tomorrow. Now, you have to understand, the
kit was originally a MicroBus, which was then modified to be a Van
by reducing the number of windows, and customized with a 'peace symbol'
front emblem in the early 70s. In the late 70s, during the CB craze,
Revell further assaulted it, adding oversize tires, nerf-bars instead
of bumpers and changed the nose emblem to &quot;CB&quot;. I'm not sure whether
the stock wheels survived or not. I fear not.

	However, the guy who responded to my plea on rec.models.scale
says that someone sells both the basic Revell kit and a detail package
of rear fenders, bumpers, nose emblem, tires, wheels, etc. He says
the ad can be found in the back of Scale Auto Enthusiast. I'll forward
the hot info tomorrow when he sends it to me.

	For Vanagon enthusiasts, the same plea in the same place also
got back the info that the Vanagon kit has bee re-issued in UN Peacekeeper
garb (!). Some may find this singularly tasteless, but I'm going to
contact some of the european mail-order places to see if they're stocking
it yet. From Europe, it will be about $25, one at a time, airmail, I'm
afraid.

	I'll also post the address of Revell so you can join me in writing
letters to them requesting the Vanagon kit released here, and also
the Transporter Van be both available and returned to decent (stock!)
condition.

	Bill
