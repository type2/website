While it is always &quot;good practice&quot; to remove the cv's and axle assemblies
once in a blue moon to inspect,clean and repack, most volks folk I know
would rather spend the day at the free dental clinic than tackle the dreaded
cv inspection/maintenance.

CV's boots themselves don't need much (if any) lubrication. It is the bearings
and the saddles which need the life preserving goo. Injecting grease into the boot
will fill up the boot, and possibly push some into the front recesses of the bearing
saddle, but in the long run, will not do much else.

Under the assumption that some cv grease is better than none, and not knowing
exactly what condition alot of my &quot;newer&quot; aquisitions are in whenever I go to
pick up a &quot;new lawn orniment&quot; I always take along a special &quot;tool&quot; I crafted
under the tutelage of a revered BMW (bike) mechanic I worked with back in the 70's.

What you do is grab a flared tip from a brazing kit. The kind that fans out in a broad
30 degree radius. I like the 3&quot; longer one. Not too good for brazing, but excellent as a
donor.  Braze (with the good brazing tip from your propane torch kit of course) a
zerk (grease fitting nipple) on the threaded end, and gently tap the flared tip flatter
while shaping the end around a 1&quot; section of pipe.  What you end up with is a grease
fitting that will slip inbetween the axle shaft, and the sleeve of the boot! It will also
reach all the way up to the face of the cv joint.  This allows you to inject your packing
grease next to the cv (Note I said next to), cause short of going in and doin the job
right it ain't gonna completely where its supposed to! If you wiggle the zerk end around
you will feel the flared end &quot;drop into&quot; the bearing saddle. Once &quot;in the groove&quot; you can
lube the cv till you see the boot swell a bit. Don't wait till it comes oozing out as you
may split the boot from the pressure...

As mentioned above, I use this whenever I pick up a cv'd bus or bug which I trailer in
on my car dolly. I can tell you that upon inspection back at the shop more than one CV
had little or no grease apparent (other than our green goo) and could have done the cvs
in had we not used this little preventative measure...

However, I do not condone this as a fix, I prefer to rebuild/replace/service my CVs -vs-
spending lonely hours on the side of the road or under the pleasures from my local dental
technician Brad!
