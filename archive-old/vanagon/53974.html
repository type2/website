List,

	After reading the list discussion on syncro tire sizes lately, I am
still unclear on the general concensus for allowable difference between
the front and rear. 6% was mentioned from the Bently manual, and some
pointed out that it should be lower to allow for cornering. So if my
rear tires are 2.5% larger than the front, due to rotating, then am I in
the clear? Thanks to all.
