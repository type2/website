Subject: Side window found

Thanks to all who offered advice and/or side window replacements for my 83.5 
Westy.  I was able to get one from Ron Salmon (sp?) who lives about 1/2 hr 
from me at a very reasonable price.  With the help of my wife we installed it 
in less than 30 min with the instructions from the archives.

Thanks,

Bryan
