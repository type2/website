Subject: Re: early vs: late cutoff

I know of a local vw vintage shop that jokes that &quot;They are all late model!&quot;
which is joke on themselves for pursuing the oldest possible vw that they
can pretend to get their hands on. It's one of those jokes between mechanics
that try to out do each other (in their dreams) with BS &lt;read:Bus Stories&gt;
as they tune up some kids' rat 79 bug.

The most univerally accepted real answer is that most folks use the 1967
model year as a cut-off date for &quot;early.&quot; 
Other folk recognize 1962 or 63 model years as a cut-off due to the end of
the corner window buses and subtle changes in the bug. Still other folk like
to recognize '57 as the last of the oval windowed bugs or early '55 as the
last of the Barndoor buses. Still other rich folk and dreamers use the end
of the KdF as the cut-off. Hell, I'm happy just not to hear, &quot;Honey, it
won't start again!&quot;


&gt;Hi Y'all,
&gt;
&gt;Just curious...is there a formal cutoff year between what is considered 
&gt;'early' vs. 'late'?  Often in manuals and posts I see things like: 'In 
&gt;early models' do this, use that ,etc. with no reference to the year.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry if this has been covered recently, I haven't checked the archives.
&gt;
&gt;TIA, 
&gt;
&gt;Mitch
