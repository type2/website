G'day folks!

[._dot_description of really nice interior...snip..]
&gt; 
&gt; I remembered that Jim Davis had a vanagon lim.ed. with legrests, now I 
&gt; know something about how they look.

I do recall seeing in the Vanagon line up that there was one with a 
similar interior.._dot_can't remember what it was called though.  It had 6 
seats, all individual captain's chairs, the front four swivelled too.
So, in the back you could have a four person, face to face confrence!
I think it also had a sunroof, facilities for mobile phones (which where 
*huge* back then...:) Can't remember the colour, but it had lowered 
suspension and alloy wheels.

Darren.
