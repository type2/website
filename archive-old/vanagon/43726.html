  I didn't know this &quot;stuffer&quot; piston type super charging system was used 
on VW iron, or is it mag, but the normal ratio was two to one if I 
remember correctly.  Each crank rotation on the compressor cylinders 
produces one output charge, whereas, except for Detroit Diesel and the 
like two cycles, the four cycles take, as their name implies, four cycles 
which is two crank rotations.  So there were some that had an intake 
valve and two alternate opening exhaust valves on the stuffer cylinders. 
 Now, when you start taking about optimizing swept volume ratios, things 
get really interesting, but there was no lag time on these, unlike the 
turbos.
