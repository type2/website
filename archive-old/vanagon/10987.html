&gt;had the starter rebuilt and a new bendix put on but it still does
&gt;this.  I can feel the edge of the teeth on the ring gear are worn
&gt;somewhat.  Do I need to replace the ring-gear?  Is there an alignment
&gt;trick when installing the starter?  Would experimenting with shims on
&gt;the mounting face of the starter help? All help appreciated.

sounds to me like the wrong solenoid ... if it works Sometimes, and if
beating on it makes it work. that's what my old 80 bus did, and i replaced
the solenoid with a Gin-you-wine vw one, and it all went back to normal.
might not hurt to do that large mutha-wire from the battery ground strap
bolt back to the starter mounting bolt ... to give the starter as much
good ground as possible.

&gt;Lastly, if anyone responds to this and their mailer allows, please send
&gt;response to the list AND me personally so I have SOMETHING to read
&gt;today :)
