Subject: Re: EV Fan Resistors

Trace,


Here's the scoop on the resistors. They are accessable by first popping
the front grille/radiator assembly forward. Remove the two 10mm bolts from 
the radiator brace...lift the assembly up, and then tilt it forward.

The resistors are behind the metal panel that is below the driver's side 
headlight. To remove these panels just undo the 10mm sheet metal screws 
which were exposed when the grille panel was removed. The panel then can be 
popped out.

Once the panel is removed, then the resistors will be expsed. The 
replacement resistors are green in color whereas the original ones were 
black (as I recall). They should cost about $30/ea. It will take about 15 to 
20 minutes to replace them yourself.

As to the fans functioning. Your mechanic is full of CRAP when he says BOTH 
fans should be operating. Under normal conditions only one fan will be 
operating. The second fan will only run when the A/C is on its &quot;high&quot; 
setting, or when the engine is very hot. Both fans will also come on briefly 
after the engine has been shut down, and the AC has been on.

BTW, here's the quick check to see if the resistor is in fact roached...the 
entire coating of the resistor should be burnt away exposing the coil of 
wires, which will also be cooked!


If you have any other questions about the resistors, let me know.
