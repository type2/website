&gt;As the bod is in storage i can not say who did the convertion.  I know it was
&gt;done i CA and i think the company name begins with &quot;C&quot;.  I will be seeing it
&gt;soon so i will check.  I am kind a curious about the company and whot not.

Could be Country Homes in Scotts Valley, California.
