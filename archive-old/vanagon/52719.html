     Hi Bob,
     
       Are there any specific Audi 4000 years that would fit an 84GL 
     Vanagon or would any Audi 4000 fit any Vanagon?  If you have replaced 
     the blower on the '84GL you own, how hard was it?  I am told  you have 
     to take the dash completle apart and break some plastic clips in order 
     to change the fan.  I have not looked into it yet, but the PO removed 
     the front fan speed control knob because it blew a fuse anytime the 
     fan was turned on.  I suspect the motor has a short and it will have 
     to be replaced.  Sorry to ramble on. . . but any advice/info you have 
     would be helpful.
     
     TIA
     Vince

     Add the Audi 4000 to the list of possible donor cars that have the 
same heater fan as a Vanagon.  There is a plug instead of spade 
connectors on the motor, and the guy who spent an hour+ pulling it in the 
rain cursed my name, but by the end of today, I'll have a heater again.
