Subject: Re: Water Wetter: Again

Hi All,

In the photographic world we also use a product to lower the surface 
tension of water, its called Wetting Agent, sounds like its the same as 
the old Water Wetter and very similer to dish soap. 

Wetting agents differ from dish soap in two ways though, they are free 
from any salt solutions and PH is relatavely neutral. Wetting agents are 
basically soap in its purest form.  

I am told that dish soaps do contain high amounts of *salt* and other 
nasty impurities, ok to wash your dishes in but no good for the long 
term health of film.  Could it be the same for ALUMINUM?  

Regards,

Chris Gibbs
