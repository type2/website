Subject:      Re: Stainless Exhaust

Someone asked about the Canadian company building stainless exhaust systems.
The company is STEBRO Exhausts, Manotick, Ontario (near Ottawa)
613-692-4984  talk to Dan.  I spoke with him last week and he told me the
compelete exhaust system for Volkwagen Vanagons should be ready for sale in
a month or two.  Price around $500 with life time gaurentee.  Sure sounds
good to me. I've been waiting for this one big time.

Cheers

Frank
