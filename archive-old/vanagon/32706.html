Subject: Irrelevant Post

Hello, 
	This is an irrelevant posting to test the outcome of my 
signature.  In case you can't identify the object represented, it's 
supposed to be an ascii Thing.  Thank-you for your time and any comments 
on the signature.  It's a good thing that it is Friday and I can post 
garbage like this. 
      By the way, Where I grew up in central PA it wasn't considered a 
good day unless one killed something while going for a drive.  We used 
to have a point system established and had an on-going competition.  The 
possum type in question could be good for a range of 3-7 points 
(depending on how, and with what part of the car, it was struck).  The 
highest points given were to a friend that accidentally took out a horse 
with a buick on a dark country road...It was a tie, both horse and car 
had to be put down.   Good-bye--
