Subject: six cylinders, no waiting

Kip asks if a Porsche six fits in a Vanagon, specifically his 84.  Mostly
yes, is the answer.  You do need to raise most of the engine lid about
four inches.  On the 84 you need to figure out a new approach to heat, as
the Porsche engine is not good at heating water, although it is excellent
at moving the car.  My six cylinder Vanagon is based on an 81; there, the
stock Porsche heat exchangers do a better job than the Vgon's own originals.
Another respondent mentioned MSDS.  Their solution is nice but expensive
(almost $2000 before you even pay for the engine) and it assumes the later
3.2 liter Porsche motor, which is the only one that fits (just) under the
stock Vgon engine lid.

I'm on my second iteration of modified decklid design and of rear engine
hanger design.  My first iteration of both, as a kit to get someone
started installing a Porsche in a Vgon, is for sale.  Contact me by email;
I'm a sniveling archives-lurker on vanagon_at_lenti.
