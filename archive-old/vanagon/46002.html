John, 

My 12v water pump went out a year ago in the '82 Diesel Westy.  A very 
inexpensive replacement was found at Wal-Mart.  They stock a line of 
12volt submersible bilge pumps for boats.  In fact, the stock VW water 
hose was a very nice and snug push fit to the inside of the pump's 
outlet nipple.  It works great, and only set me back $10.  BTW I used 
the 300 gallon per hour model.  Plenty of water flow without splashing 
outside the sink.  Good Luck
