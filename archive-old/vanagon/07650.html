Subject: Coolant Fill Crisis Resolved, how about sagging doors?
Date: Tue, 6 Dec 1994 03:00:22 -0800 (PST)

I have tried to adjust the front doors on my '85 Vanagon using the two 
sets of bolts, but my doors are still sagging when they are unlatched.  
Any suggestions from the group.

BTW, I'm trashing the whitewalls that some idiot put on my bus tomorrow 
for the Bridgestones--not easy to find at a decent price.  First pricing 
was $85 a pop, finally found them at Big 10 in Doraville, GA for $69.

Catalytic Converters for $120, prey, where!!!???
