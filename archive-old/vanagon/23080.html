Hello all.  I'm not getting a very big response for potluck signups
for the Aug 25-27 Wailaki trip.  Are you begging for whips and chains?  :)

Seriously, I forgot to mention one thing for you to keep in mind on
this matter.  Thanks to one of our list members for reminding me.  There
has been a growing trend to make these events quite gourmet, which I
think is great.  I realize not everyone likes to cook magnificient
things from scratch, so if you fall into that category, you may wish
to sign up for something innocuous like bread or smores.  That
isn't to suggest we don't favor home-made bread, however.  Anyway,
the tastes of our group have in the past been at a frighteningly
high level (palate-wise I mean  :), so I'm encouraging you all
not only to sign up now, but to start cooking now!
