Hi Clara!  I'd love some miscellaneous bolts and etc. for my '62
(so none of those silly 42mm thingies :-) )  Also any brake stuff
(us pre-63 types have to worry sometimes).  Let me know what you
think it will cost to ship.

I have some extra stuff like ventwing hardware and some door window
glass if you want it. . . . .

Thanks for the offer,

Mark
