&gt;George, what do you think of Bosch O2 sensors?  They are generally
&gt;available at Western Auto, Advance, etc., and usually cost as little as
&gt;$18 for a one wire generic version.  I've used them on all my cars, and
&gt;so far all seems to be well.

&gt;Thanks.

The one wire universals are pretty inexpensive. Bosch has been around
a long time. I would not feel uncomfortable using a Bosch but I would
not go looking for one either.  I have had very good luck with the
Standard and Echlin lines and will stick with them till I have reason
to change.
