Subject: Re: VW mailing received


&gt; From Ed_Pyrik_at_mindlink.bc_dot_ca Fri Jan 12 09:40:42 1996 :
 
&gt; Just received from VofA, Vol.1, issue1, of Volkswagen World (Sept/95 issue).
&gt; 
&gt; Also received computer disk &quot;Free internet Access.  Automatic connection to the
&gt; Volkswagen Home Page&quot;.  Haven't installed it yet.  Says &quot;Spry Mosaic&quot;.
&gt; Has anyone installed the disk?  Is this just another Compuserve promotion?

I have the September and November '95 issues of 'Volkswagen Magazine', These
are the first two editions, they are in they Dutch language and are distributed
through the VW dealer channels and to anyone who has a 3yr old or newer VW.
The magazine is made by Pon, the Dutch importer. I think both the US and NL
magazines are somewhat the same in set up.

Someone who wants to trade his US VW mag against my NL one, sep, nov, Both?

Brian.
