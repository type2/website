 Westfalia there'll be a plate next
&gt; to the VIN number behind the driver's seat, I don't know about other makes.

in n. america the older westy's (pre 1980) i have seen have the &quot;official&quot; westy tag located on the 
passenger side of the &quot;cupboard&quot; below the pullout bed .

my $0.02
