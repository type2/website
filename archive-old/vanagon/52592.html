&gt; Is it best to only let a VW 'specialist' work on your Bus (1982 Vanagon)
or
&gt; are things so straightforward that an experienced non-specific mechanic
&gt; will be fine?

Go with the specialist unless your regular mechanic is incredibly honest,
helpful, and won't learn about an engine s/he's not familiar with on _your_
time.
