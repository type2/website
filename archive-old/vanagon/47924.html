        MY speedometer is not accurate. Can somone tell me
        if your tach is running 3,000 RPM in 4th gear what
        speed are you going in 4th gear. MY speedo. says
        I'm going 53 MPH.

  Use the mile markers on the side of the hiway and a stop watch to calibrate
the speed and odometer.  All VW speed'o's over read buy about 4 or 5%. This
helps hide the lack of performance.  Actually, the speedo is supposed to
overead to maske you drive slower,(the Fed's at work).  The Speedo can be
reset by resetting the pointer on the shaft.  Larger tires will also remove
some of the error.
