Better to put a bus on top of the wedding cake - IMHO of course ;-)

&gt; Dubbers:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a strange request:
&gt; 
&gt; I am getting marrried at the end of August, and I talked my
&gt; fiance to let me put a bug on top of the wedding cake, under
&gt; some conditons:
&gt; 
&gt; Between 5 and 10 inches long.
&gt; Convertible
&gt; Bride and goom in the front seat, either driving.
&gt; Can be a Ghia.
&gt; 
&gt; If anybody out there has something that will fit the bill, please
&gt; contact me. I will pay all shipping, both ways, and take
&gt; real good care of it. I promise.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx.
