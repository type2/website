So Mark McCulley says:
&gt; 
&gt; With that many miles, it's time for a rebuild. A good rebuild will cost a 
&gt; few thousand dollars and should last you another 144K miles or so. I'm 
&gt; speaking in general terms here...
&gt; 
&gt; You might try the BarsLeak treatment and nurse your engine through a few 
&gt; thousand more miles while you save $ for the rebuild.

I agree with Marks assessment (sort of). Actually, I'd probably just do
the BarsLeak treatment and milk that engine for as long as I could.

You may still have some significant miles to go on that engine, so you
may as well get your $$$ out of it.
