Subject: NaOH on Al

In the process of fixing up my recently acquired '84 Vanagon, I wanted
to do something about the aluminum carpet-hold-down at the bottom of
the sliding door.  It was hideous, covered with grime and tar.  Cleaning
and sanding did not produce exactly satisfactory results, though I would
have to say it was &quot;acceptable&quot; in that state.  I asked my wife, who
knows some chemistry--a lot more than I do!--and she said, well you 
certainly don't want to use Easy-Off.  So that's what I tried.  I like
the effect, it's sort of mottled gray and shiny.  I think some of the
gray will wear away leaving more shiny, but that will be okay.
