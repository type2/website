So then, Ric retorts to Steven's torts with:

&gt;I think the price is high because EuroVans are Sooooooo reliable
&gt;that no one will need to buy a manual, so the ones that are sold
&gt;are going to be instant collector's items!!  ;-)

Yes, well be that as it may, I'd like to get a copy of this manual,
but not at 149 bucky buckaroos (+ S&amp;H too!)   :-O

Tell you what, Ric, if you're willing to break a copyright law or
two, I'll split the cost of one of these suckas w/ you (or others).

Maybe it's time to take up a collection....   ;-)
