Subject:      A trick to fill the radiator

An &quot;old&quot; VW mechanic told me last week that when he worked for VW they came
up with an easy way to fill a Vanagon with coolant.  He said that he would
drill a 1/4 in. hole through the edge of the thermostat.  Once that was
done the bus would purge itself of air just by driving. Has anyone ever
heard of this?  I just don't see how it would work, but he swore that it
worked.
