Likewise I also own a full Snap-On fuel pressure gauge set
with adapters to analyze most any American or European or Jap car,
including the diff pressure test valve for Bosch CIS-K series injections
on the water pumper front driver VW's.  If anyone near ever needs
them get in touch, I'm happy to loan them.
