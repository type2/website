&gt; A pair of bowls nine and a half inches in diameter held almost three and a
&gt; half gallons and was subjected to pressures as high as 200 psi.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen bowls as large as twenty inches in diameter but as their diameter
&gt; increases they depart from a nearly hemispherical shape.  Still, for low
&gt; pressure applications they do a good job.

Of course your average ex R-12 or R-22 tank works just as well, comes
pre made and seems a bit safer IMHO,  just what the hell were you using
this for Bob.

(course the freon tanks may be illegal to own nowadays, if so I
never said this)
