&gt; GL-5 is a better drade of lubricant and GL-6 is now becoming available.  The

&gt; improved lubricant.  Instead of testing thier transaxles with the improved

&gt; aproblem when the extreme pressure aditive packages contained sulfur.
&gt;  Remember that gear oil smell of years ago.  Sulfur addditives are hardly
&gt; used now and this is not a concern in an automotive gearbox.  Use the GL-5 or
&gt; 6 and your gears will love you.  Synthetics should also be considered.  The
&gt; extra money is cheap insurance for your expensive gearbox.

I do remember gear oil smelling of sulfur. But I'm still confused. If the 
&quot;GL&quot; classification of 6 is better than 5 which is better than 4, where 
does a GL-4 synthetic (ie Redline's MTL GL-4) fit in?
