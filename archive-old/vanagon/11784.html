Subject: /f Official song of my bus!, instruments

Steve, &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; is 1970- but you're right, a red-hot version!
Ric, &quot;People who claim to *remember* the '60 weren't there.&quot; -Grace Slick

Check out &quot;Goin' Mobile&quot; on Who's Next, camper fans!

Ok, ok, I *did* name my computer after THAT Pete Townshend!

Other good theme songs for busses:
&quot;Desifinado&quot; (&quot;Slightly out of tune&quot;) - Antonio Carlos Jobim
&quot;Flight of the Cosmic Hippo&quot; - Bela Fleck and the Flecktones
&quot;5:15&quot; - The Who
&quot;Tarkus&quot; - Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (great to listen to while driving!)
&quot;Fast Cars&quot; - Buzzcocks
&quot;No One Like You&quot; - Pete Shelly
&quot;Bear Up Bison&quot; - Shonen Knife
&quot;Walking One and Only&quot; - Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks
&quot;Small Blue Thing&quot; - Suzanne Vega
&quot;Keep On Truckin'&quot; - Hot Tuna
&quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; - (can't remember who did this- for sunroof owners!)
*anything* by Brave Combo, The Mermen or Tori Amos :-)

And I, too, would rather be saved by a bag than zipped in one! The
latest Autoweek had something about the Sharran to the effect
that its built and priced for the european market (natch) and
would cost $35,000-$40,000 if they sold it here.
	No kidding- US dollars! 
	Pretty car though. What do they want for it in Ireland or the UK?

	Cheers!
	Bill
