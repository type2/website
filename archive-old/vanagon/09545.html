No, John, I don't have a 12v rug shampooer - at least not yet!  But,
I'm working on it, and in the meantime, in between now and getting my
hot water rear shower, I'd like to install a microwave, dishwasher,
clothes washer, dryer, and oven.  Maybe I'll just have you hacker types
put it in for me at the next pretour meet  :)
