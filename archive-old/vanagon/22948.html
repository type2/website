Subject: Help on the Road

	Eddie, all,
	LiMBO and NEATO publish a membership directory where VW Transporter
aka Bus/etc owners can list their names and addresses if they are open
to anything from telephone support to drop by for a cup of coffee...
Since I was a wanna-busser when I joined LiMBO, I'm not listed. So
I should drop them a line, and I encourage anyone who has an impulse
toward strangers with strangely familiar vehicles join one of these
two groups (Basicly LiMBO is post-67 and NEATO is pre-67).

	Anyway, Vanagon list members and friends are welcome to
give me a call, do an oil change in my driveway, etc. if they
find themselves in the South Bay Area. When you can catch me, and
given my somewhat limited experience, of course. I can loan
tools and advice in emergencies, etc. Good coffee shops, excellent
pizza and a friendly VW dealer, FLAPS and hardware stores are 
all close by.
