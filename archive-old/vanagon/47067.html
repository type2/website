&gt;I also can't seem to light that damn refrigerator on gas... any suggestions
&gt;there? I've read the fridge suggestions on the syncro page (I tried rapid
&gt;fire ignition plunges.. holding the B button down for 30 secs, etc.. but to
&gt;no avail... any tios would be GREATLY appreciated!!). 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any insights!!
&gt;

Unscrew the little metal cap under the lower lip of the refrigerator (it 
usually has a little metal chain on it). Then try to light it. If it 
lights, replaced the cap and light it again.

This did the trick for me. (Felt great to have a working refrig.)

Good Luck!
--Dave
