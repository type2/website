Subject: Re[2]: hubcaps (wheel covers)

     Hi all,
     
     I agree there is a great deal of value in getting your vanagon back 
     into stock shape.
     
     However, for people who are struggling financially, there is another 
     hub cap option.
     
     For under 20$, KMart sells PVC hubcaps that look pretty darn good.  A 
     nice option considering the dealer asks like 65$ each for the original 
     hubcaps.
     
     I seem to have a pension for loosing hubcaps, so a 20$ set of four 
     isn't so bad.
     
     Hope this helps......
