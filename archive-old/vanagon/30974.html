Subject: Re: Toll inquiry: 12 spline thingy 

In a message dated 95-12-14 19:28:20 EST, you write:

&gt;I had no trouble *finding* them; I had trouble finding *good* ones.  I
&gt;wrecked 
&gt;3 K-D versions taking the drive shafts off my Jetta transaxle, then chased
&gt;and 
&gt;tackled a Snap-On truck and bought one from him.  It was worth every penny
of
&gt;
&gt;the $16 to get a *quality* tool that wouldn't break, or make me go back to
&gt;the 
&gt;parts store *again*.  I figure it's better to by a GOOD tool than make
&gt;another 
&gt;trip to the store (which is a minumum hour delay, since I have to crawl out 
&gt;from under the car, wash up, drive to the store, drive to the OTHER store
&gt;that 
&gt;has the part in stock, buy it, go home, drink a Coke, and then go back to 
&gt;work...)
&gt;
&gt;So what is this kerch dude babbling about? Bottom line, I recommend you get
a
&gt;
&gt;Snap-On version of *this* tool.  You just won't have any trouble with it.

I've been to NAPA, Nationwise, Guarantee Auto, Big Wheel/Rossi, etc in
Indiana, Ohio, and Minnesota and have never seen the 12 point set.  That's
why I got mine at the Parts Place.
