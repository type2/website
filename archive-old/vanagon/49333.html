Subject: Automatic Locking Rear Differential??


Hi all,
	I am looking at a '89 Syncro Westy and I cannot find a button to
operate a locking rear differential.  The salesman says that in '89 they
went to a automatic locking differential.  Is this true?  I have never
heard of it.  If it is true is there any way to tell that it does in
fact have this auto lock?  Also what would be a good price for this Van?
It has 127K miles.  The engine was rebuilt by local VW dealer 2000 miles
ago. Please respond to me personally as the list is currently too
overwhelming.

TIA,

Cory

P.S.-There is also a Westfalia for sale here(Boulder Colorado) that has
under 3000 original miles...it is an '89 and is, obviously immaculate.  If
anyone is interested I could find out details:)
