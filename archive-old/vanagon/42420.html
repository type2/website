Subject: Power Steering Rack, A new source

I recently had my 1985 power steering rack rebuilt by a local shop in So. CAl
for a $195.00.  I had to r&amp;r it but the unit is working great (after two months)
They quoted $95.00 to rebuild the PS pump.  I elected not to do this at this
time.  They rebuilt my alternator for $85.00.  I called the parts manager
about mentioning there name on the vanagon list, but he was very reluctant,
because &quot;they are swamped as it is.&quot;
Let me know if you are interested, maybe they will change their mind.
