Subject: Re: Hitch Question - 69 Bus

&gt;I am wanting to add a hitch to my 69 Bus.  I haven't figured out all of the
&gt;engineering yet to hang a frame hitch from the same general area as the rear
&gt;motor hanger and bumper mounting area, so I thought I'd see if someone on the
&gt;vanagon list had done this or had it done successfully.
&gt; 
&gt;What I need is a hitch that would allow me to pull a tandem UHaul car trailer.
&gt; 
&gt;Also, would a pickup-style step-bumper be feasible as a bumper/hitch point
&gt;for a VW Bus?
&gt;
My 71 has a aftermarket hitch, but I don't think its rated for what you wany 
to pull.  Mine says gross weight 1100 lbs and 110 lbs tounge weight.  It is 
mounted to the frame on each side, with a big peice of angle between.  The 
tounge bolts to the botton of the stock bumper.
