yup, two entirely different products (and now that you have a 
concensus of two, it is fact).

&gt;I THINK dielectric grease is 
&gt; conductive goop that you put on high voltage electrical connections 
&gt; to maintain current flow and prevent corrosion.

whoops.  by definition, dielectric means non-conducting.  it DOES 
prevent corrosion and is used on spark plug boots to allow easy 
removal.  it is non-conducting so as to not conduct high spark plug 
voltage.  it keeps plug boots soft, supple, and younger looking.  
also aids in keeping water out.GE makes a nice dielectric grease, silicone based, for plug boots etc.
 i have a tube and do like to use it.



&gt;  Point lube is silicon lube that goes between the rider on the
&gt; movable point and the distributor shaft  to prevent excessive
&gt; wear.

uhh......  it MAY be silicone based but i doubt it. point lube is a high melting point,
 tenacious grease that won't slide or fly off and contaminate the points.


&gt; I've always used regular high temp. lube on my distributor shaft

for the above stated reasons, actual point lube would be better.  it 
is also compatible with the phenolic resins of the rubbing block of 
the points.
