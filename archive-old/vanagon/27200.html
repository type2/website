Subject: Methyl hydrate (was: CO Emissions still out...)

Ok, I've received at least 12 responses from my post asking about the 
effectiveness of methyl hydrate as an emissions test cheat.  Most of 
the responses were of the &quot;what the hell is methyl hydrate&quot; type; 2 folks 
offered opinions on its usefulness.

I'm not a chemist, and I don't even play one on T.V., but methyl hydrate 
is a form of alcohol, most often used up here in the Great White North as 
a fuel additive to keep your vehicle's fuel lines from freezing up in the 
winter.  You can also use it to clean stuff, as it evaporates completely 
and quickly.  And it's dirt cheap, something like a dollar fifty for a 1 
litre bottle at any car-type store.

The lore of it's usefulness as an emmisions test cheat runs along these 
lines:
  - CO is a common failure on emissions test failure
  - Alcohol doesn't produce ANY CO as a product of combustion.  None.  
    Nada.   
  - Diluting the fuel in your tank with methyl hydrate reduces the 
    proportion of CO-producing gasoline in there, producing a concommitant 
    reduction in CO emissions.  

Sounds simple, right?  But does it work?

Bob Hoover (VeeDubber, the Grendel guy for any new folks out there) says 
yes it works.  Harry Yates (Harry, the guy who seems to take one month of 
vacations in his syncro Westy every 6 weeks) says no it doesn't.  I'm 
ashamed to admit it, but once (and only once) I used methyl hydrate to 
get my Korean econo-box through emissions testing after it had failed the 
first time.  And yes, I had new ignition parts and a perfectly re-timed 
motor, well-adjusted carb, and clean air-filter for both tests.  It 
*appeared* to work, but I'm sure there were a gazillion uncontrolled 
variables operating, so who's to say?  

Ok, time for the chemists and whatever-ists to come out of the woodwork 
here.  What's the real scoop on this?  Is methyl hydrate an Urban Legend, 
or what?  I'd love to hear from somebody who actually does emissions 
testing, preferably one who has access to the equipment to do a 
controlled trial on this question.  Let's get some empirical evidence on 
the table here.

God, I love this list.
