Well, having just faced this problem a few weeks ago I can attest to the
fact that in addition to the screws along the sides and bottom of this
panel that you get to from the engine compartment, there are four screws
(on mine, at least) that go UP into the panel from underneath.  Two on
either side of the transmission, right at the FRONT lip of the engine
compartment.  Suffice it to say that with all that plus the lip at the
top, the panel is held on securely.  :)
