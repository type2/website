&lt;&lt;  Is there anything wrong with doing this? I would think it would
 help by letting the system get cooler air into it, instead of the hotter
 stagnant air in the compartment. If anyone has any info on this I'd love to
 hear about it. I think I'm going to try it and see if it helps, unless I
 hear from someone that I shouldn't do this for whatever reason. Thanks
 alot!   Tom

There really is no benifit.  Ductwork would actually slow down airflow and
cause other problems.  Any air that is stagnant in the engine compartment is
air that is not pulled in by the engine fan.  Actually, all air brought in by
the fan is not really warmed by the compartmane before it gets to the engine.
 All that air is constantly changed especially at HWY speeds.  When engine is
shut down or even at idle speeds, air flow is greatly reduced.  The engine
heat then rises into the space above the engine. This gives the perception
that this area is always hot.
