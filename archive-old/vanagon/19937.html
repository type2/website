&gt; Anyone see the shows this past weekend?  Lots of sweet loafs,
&gt; but a lot of splits with missing rear bumpers.  Why is this?
&gt; 2nd set Sunday night was heaven.P?({

You know how it is to back up a bus!  &lt;grin&gt;  But serisously, old 
type 2 bumpers are pretty flimsy, and prone to dinging.  finding a 
good clean rear bumper is a sweet find!
