&gt;A search comes up empty when I try to do a search through Netscape, but &gt;I expect that this is because of the difficulty that Gerry reported in &gt;an earlier post last evening.

I use Netscape to go to the gopher site, and also find that the
overall search does not work. However, if I go to individual years
and do a search from there, it works fine. In most cases, I am looking
for something I have seen, so I have an idea of the time frame and  it
doesn't bother me much...
