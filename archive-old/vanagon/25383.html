Subject: Drake power supply

Dean Aukes asked about an R.L. Drake DC-4 power supply he had been given.
Several people replied, correctly, that it won't convert 12V DC to
anything like 120V AC / 60 Hz.

The DC-4 was designed to power Drake's TR-4 ham transceiver (which
had a lot of tubes in it) from a car's 12V system.  It mainly
put out several different DC voltages for the transceiver, but also
had a 110V AC output jack for powering certain station accessories.
The frequency of this AC was 330 Hz (approximately), because the
DC-4's transformers could be considerably smaller that way.  The
switching circuit which &quot;chopped&quot; the incoming 12V DC operated
at that higher frequency.  

Some electronic equipment will run quite happily at higher frequencies,
but not all, and I wouldn't risk trying.  For sure, nothing with
an AC motor in it will run...

On the other hand, if you are a ham and have a TR-4 lying around,
it'll run great!
