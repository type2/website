Subject:      1.9L TD complete

To all you folks who've been following the progress of my1.6L diesel to a
1.9L TD, the process is now complete. What it's cost:
VW ADE 1.9L industrial(automotive)Turbo diesel: $3900 (includes shipping
and taxes)
Rebuild 4 speed DZ (alpine gears) and change ring and pinion to 4.57 $550
Install engine and make some modifications: about $1500 ( I think) (haven't
gotten the final bill yet)
Included in the installation price were some other non engine upgrades, so
the $1500 isn't realistic.
Exaust: about $45 (straight pipe right off the turbo, no muffler)

What the mods have done to the van:
I am no longer relagated to the right hand lane.
At 3100 rpm I am doing 65 mph, at about 3600 rpm about 75 mph.
I no longer have to anticipate every single time I pass another
vehicle.(Especially on two lane roads).

What I've learned:
This is a very straigh forward engine swap. A good mechanic can probably do
it in about 8 hrs, if he has all the parts needed.
The most difficult part is comming up with a suitable air filtration
system. What I've come up with is a hybred, scavenged from bits and pieces
of other vehicles. It may not be  the most ideal intake but for the right
now, it's fine.

Would I do it again:
YOU BET!
However, the next time it won't take so long...
