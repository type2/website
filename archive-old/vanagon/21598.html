Subject: Re: stuck CV joint (kinda long)

Joe,
I recently had a very similar experience.  It started with wanting to 
replace just the cv boot.  But of course once i got the transaxel out 
with both cvs, i took em apart and cleaned them and repacked em and put 
it back in.  Once they were in, the wheel would not turn by hand, so i 
thought that driving would loosen them up...wrong! One was frozen and the 
rear of the car bounced up and down as i rode around the block.  I'll 
never know what went wrong.  I eventually bought two new cvs (the old 
ones were slightly worn anyway) and had a friend help me put them in.  I 
had put the old ones in backwards it turns out (don't know if this is 
what made them bind).  When he put them in he tied the tranny up with 
some rope so it would not hand down so much (something about the angle), 
anyway the new ones worked just great.  One thing, after repacking the 
old ones they didnt move very well, the new ones moved better.  Did i 
repack them wrong, who knows.  The van runs great now, $100.00 later.  
welcome to the club.
