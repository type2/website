EM,
I had the exact same thing happen to me. I came to the same conclusion.

&gt; Last year I sent them a $4 check for a catologue, they cashed it and I
never
&gt; recieved the catologue.  I know its only a lousy four bucks but when I
called
&gt; them a few months later, they said &quot;we have a new one at the printer and
will
&gt; send it out&quot;  I never got it. Called again a few months after that and
the
&gt; same thing was told to me. So I would never bother to order from them in
the
&gt; first place.
