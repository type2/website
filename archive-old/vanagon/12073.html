&gt; well, i don't know why, but the address for me SHOULD be

&gt; knows ua1vm is alabama!). so i'll leave the name field like it is above
&gt; until i get wake up one the system nerds to tell me how to fix this.

You can't use jwalker_at_UA1VM unless you are on a BITNET system.  The other
way to mail to joel is jwalker_at_UA1VM.BITNET
So, You really only have two addresses -- 1 ineternet and one bitnet.
