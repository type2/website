I notice on my new VR6 that the ground slope when filling the tank makes a big
difference in filling. Even a very slight slope towards the driver's side and
it fills 1-2 gallons short, and the gauge will start to drop almost
immediately. Fill with a slight slope to the passenger side and more gas goes
in, with 30 or more miles before it starts.

The gauge does drop more immendiately from full than any of my past vanagons
or '93 EV. It usually hits 1/2 tank at about 150m+, and when the needle starts
into the red zone there is still 5 gallons left in the tank. At first we were
filling up at about 250m - now we go 300+.

&gt;The EVC has passed all tests, thanks to everyone, except for the gas guage
&gt;needle. Does the guage needle drop within three miles of a topped tank or
&gt;does it wait to drop for several miles.  I'm hoping it's several
&gt;miles....even many miles!!
