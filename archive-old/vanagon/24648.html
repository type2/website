Hi-tech fresh-air cut-off modifications for wintertime?

Heck, yes!  And here's what you need to do it:

- a couple of plastic garbage bags
- duct tape

The Real Complicated Instructions (Certified Mechanics Only!!):
 1) Fold the garbage bags over and over in one direction so they're in a 
long-thin shape, like the shape of the exterior grille for the fresh air 
intake on the front of your bus.  If one bag isn't big enough, fold one 
bag for the left side, the other for the right side, leaving as much 
overlap as possible.
 2) Take the duct tape and affix the precision-folded bags to the front of 
the bus by taping an unbroken strip of tape around the entire perimeter 
on the grille.  Tape directly to the body of the bus; do not tape on to 
the edge of the grille itself.  If you used two bags to get the coverage 
you needed, tape the joint between the two bags as well.
 3) Step back and enjoy the sheer beauty of your handiwork!  Say good 
bye to the bulk of your winter drafts!  
 4) If you want a bra for your bus, but can't afford those expensive ones 
sold in stores, why not make your own?  Use garbage bags to add that 
trendy look to your car, at a fraction of the price most people pay!
