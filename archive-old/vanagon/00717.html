&gt;I noticed that both contacts for LiMBO and NEATO are in MA (where I am,
&gt;incidentally).  Having a family who does not share my devotion to VW's
&gt;but is willing to humor me for short periods of time, I ask if anyone
&gt;knows of similar gatherings of Type II's (in New England, specifically,
&gt;but others would be of interest to other netters).  The rest of my clan
&gt;really wouldn't tolerate the haul to St. Louis, although they may enjoy
&gt;a day trip.

oh, ye of little faith ... :)
