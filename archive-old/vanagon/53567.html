Art,

Ron Salmon has one for sale for $90 with a rip. I just bought a weekender
middle and rear seat from Wm. Kennedy for $100, sides have been dyed dark
brown. And I bought a COMPLETE weekender interior from an '86 in excellent
cond. from Chris Turner ealier in the year for $400 which included
installation. BTW, none of the prices includes delivery/shipping :-(

Hope this helps!

tony

&gt; 
&gt; anyone have thoughts on reasonable price for a weekender back seat
&gt; (folds-down to provide into sleeping space) for installation in an '82
&gt; vanagon, which didn't have one of these?  cheers...
