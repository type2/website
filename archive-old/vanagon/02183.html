&gt; Steve!  You think that &quot;being in the kind of vehicles we are in
&gt; kind of limits us to doing too many crazy things?&quot;  !!!???  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Look at the grateful deadheads.  Look at Ken Kesey.  Look at
&gt; the &quot;reputation&quot; of VW buses - the bumperstickers:
&gt;      &quot;If this van's a rockin,' don't come-a-knockin'!
&gt;             or
&gt;      Don't laugh - your daughter might be in here! 

I don't mean those kinds of crazy things!  I meant the like what
if someone because they were impatient decided to pull out of the 
line-up at a bad time and caused a 40 &quot;brick&quot; pile-up?
