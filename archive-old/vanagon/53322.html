Subject: fuel injector clogging and decreasing fu


Listmembers,

Since I bought my 87 syncro van in Feb 93 with 58,000 Ive been recording the 
mpg efficiency.  Recently I plottted it up and, as expected, it showed a 
nice seasonal oscillation with worst fuel economy in the winter months and 
best in the summer.  Unfortunately it also showed a linearly decreasing 
trend from an average of 22 mpg in the summer of 93 to about 18-19 mpg this 
summer.  Significant maintenance that I have done is replacing the head 
assembly 30,000 miles ago (this would hopefully eliminate the possiblity of 
fouled valves).  But the injectors, coil, distrubutor are all original.  I 
have changed:  oil and oil filter, air filter, fuel filter, plugs, wires, 
cap, rotor and OXS sensor on schedule. This weekend I am going to check most 
of the ignition components and the injectors.  Has anybody had problems with 
clogged in jectors?
Does anybody have any other pulsed EFI tips for me to check that might point 
to ways to help raise the fuel economy of my van back up a bit?
I realize that now with 150,000 miles on the ODO, that age might be playing 
a role in this loss of efficiency, but if i can turn back the clock (not the 
odometer :-) on some of the components for the better, I'd like to try it.

Please reply directly as I am not recieving daily list correspondance.

thanks and happy holidays,
Fred Porter
BTW for van tracking purposes, my syncro will be moving me from southern 
(boring and flat with no real winters) Maryland to Salt Lake City (fun, 
mountainous with lotsa snow) in January.  If there are any gregarious 
listmembers there It might be fun to meet you sometime.
