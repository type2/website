&gt; No, no no, Bill you don't understand. I don't want an transverse de-tuned
&gt; engine infront of me, I want a rough, raspy resposive longitudinally (sp)
&gt; mounted motor behind me :)

Which is a great point, you know even if VW could not get the VR6
in the thing at the start they might have saved their asses if they had 
at least put the 20V version in the van from the late Coupe Quattro, it was
out from at least 89 or so, predating the EV a few years.  And hell
would another $1000 for the 20V really have mattered to EV owners, I
think the power would have justified the price.  Of course if the
20V is like a VW 16V, a revver, it would hardly have been appropriate.
The 2.2 was OK in my 2900lb Quantum Syncro, in a 3500+ lb EV, hardly
stellar.
