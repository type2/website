Subject: Re: HELP - Front end noise 

&gt;         It was suggested that the reoccuring yet unpatterned squeek that I
&gt; have up at the front end of my '83 may have somehting to do with my
&gt; suspension bushings or my wheel bearings. I must solve this little problem
&gt; pronto as I leave in 2 weeks, and  I think its reaking havoc with Mr.Fuel
&gt; Mileage.
I think someone suggested the O2 sensor as a possible cause for your 
mileage troubles - this sounds more likely than bushings or bearings 
(especially bushings). A high friction state (high enough to affect 
mileage) should be noticeable as a lack of power, and the feeling of 
driving with the parking brake partly on. If this is not happening 
then it sounds more like screwed up fuel inj. pumping too much fuel.

Don't get too frustrated - the most annoying problem on mine so far 
took a while to find but turned out be simple to fix (with the list's 
help...)
