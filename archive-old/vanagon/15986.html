Drew, 

I think you should call up Martin Schreiber at MSDS. He blows his syncro
tranny all the time cause he got a 911 motor in there. 

Anyway, ask him about this as he is so obsessed with the syncro tranny seals
he has self manufacturered a line of aftermarket seals for this tranny which
he claims fixes the problem with the factory seals. I think he will have an
answer for you. Please report back what transpires.

P.S. In the old days, Drew was at the end of the name, as in the famous
actor John Drew. But ever since Boe Derek appeared in that move &quot;10&quot; people
got confused and put Derek as a last name. Much to my horror, to compound
things, now we have weird people with Drew as a first name, such as Drew
Barrymore and Drew Jenkins. 

&gt;A couple months ago, I asked if anyone knew what could be causing a leak
&gt;in my Synchro tranny where the drive shaft for the forward wheels comes 
&gt;out of the front of the tranny.
