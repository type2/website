&gt;Question numero dos:This one's fer Pa out in California who is the proud
&gt;Daddy of an '84 Westfalia Wolfsberg name of Ramon. &lt;aww!&gt;
&gt;Recently, he heard a very loud clackety-clack and brought him in to be
looked
&gt;at. They explained the problem was his CV joint and that replacing it would
&gt;cost approx. $1,058 (this quote included some minor rear brake work.)
&gt;He had them do the job. Pa called me the other day from Eagle Lake where he
&gt;is camping to tell me he is hearing the same exact noise again. I told
&gt;him to bring it back to the same garage P-Ronto, and make 'em refix him.
&gt;First: was that a fair price for the job they did?? Second: Are the chances
high that
&gt;the problem recurred due to the mechanic's error or could it be another CV
joint
&gt;going? Are there two?? What's the CV joint do?
&gt;Pappa thanks you!!


Partial answer as I have no idea what a fair price would be.

There is not one CV joint nor two but four CV joints under the rear of all
type IIs, except swing axles that have two (one each side) and EVs that don't
have under the rear (they're under the front, but they still have four).

Thet act similar to universal joints which Chevrolet used on the Corvair (I
had 1968 Convert.  Would love another convert, but not another Corvair).
