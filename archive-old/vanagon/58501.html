Greetings-

One of the most interesting paint jobs I have seen wasn't on
a full-scale bus. Herpa makes HO scale model VW's, and one
of the ones in their catalog was mostly white, but the side
had an accurately sized VW bug painted on the side of the bus. 

On a different note, I am looking for a place to learn welding in
the Dayton, OH area. I have a 77 bus (in addition to my 85 vanagon)
that I need to do extensive bodywork on, and I'd like to learn
how for future vw's as well. Related to that, I wonder
if anyone knows of garages that rent out work/storage space, as
the parking lot of an apartment is a difficult place to work...
