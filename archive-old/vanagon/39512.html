Subject: GreenFest in Chapel Hill, NC this Saturday

 hey now,

 for all you hippies, deadheads, and other folks so eloquently described here
 on the list recently, there is a GreenFest going on Saturday this weekend.
 it's a pro-legalization rally with speakers and about 6 bands. me, being the
 hippy scum drug addict i am, will be camping out there in me VW. if anyone
 is interested in caravaning, let me know.

 for further info try: http://www.unc_dot_edu/~legalize.

 i'll be putting together a potluck dinner and will bring a sample of my
 homebrew....maybe a keg if i can get the rest of the CO2 gear. got a keg of
 armenian stout been ageing for about 4 months now. bout 10.0% alcohol. can i
 run my vw on that?

 anyway, flame away...

 jonathan
