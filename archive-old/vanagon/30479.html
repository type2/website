&gt;Well, this may not be the right place to be asking, but I'll try =

got the car for a good deal (about $3500) Any thoughts are appreciated. Thanks!

Hey Rafi... Nice score.  I only wish I had that kind of money to drop on a
nice splitty, but until I do I'll have to bee happy with my bubble window
busses and super.  I think the blue and white is a good idea, in fact that
is the color scheme that I have in mind for my splittie when i eventually
get one.  I want to paint the lower Wedgewood blue and the upper China
white and get a vanity license plate &quot;China Doll&quot;  in tribute to both J.
Garcia and Wedgewood China. As far as the loose steering... I'd check the
front end parts, i.e. tie rods etc.  Also,  there may still be some
adjustment left in your gear box,  that might take the play out of the
steering as well.  As far as what to do with it... I'd suggest restoring it
to stock and driving it all over the place (all painted up pretty like) with
a big cheesey grin on your face. :) Happy air-cooled motoring to you...
