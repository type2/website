&gt; Hey joel....at least the EuroVan can travel up steep hills at 70
&gt; mph WITH the A/C on full WITHOUT loosing speed!!! So there...so 
&gt; what if I can't get to the spark plugs without unhinging the
&gt; radiator...I'll only change plugs 4 or 5 times...I go up (and
&gt; down) hills much more than that!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To take a quote from Forest Gump :  Vanagon is as Vanagon does, sir!

Well let's see here... Can you pop the top on yours and sleep four comfortably?
You might, I forgot if you had the multivan version or not.  If you did
then more points for you sir... ;)  

I know you have a fridge, but what about cabinets hmmmm.... I'll just put this
suit case right....here yeah in your lap yeah that's it.  And a, let's see here
no stove? NO sink?  How uncivilized.  No supply of water?  What are you, a
barbarian?!  :O :P :)
