&gt;Hello 
&gt;My name is Aaron Roberts in Arkansas. I need some insight on a problem I am 
&gt;having with my bus. After I take it on fairly long trips, which gives the enginetime to heat up, it will not start using a key. The only way I can get it to 
&gt;start is to push start it. Once I do that and am able to get up to speed I have to take it out of gear while moving and then I can start it normally. It is like I am resetting something in the engine cause after that it will start ok for
&gt;the next hundred miles or so. They may be a simple problem but I could use your 
&gt;the next hundred miles or so. They may be a simple problem but I could use your advice/
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
