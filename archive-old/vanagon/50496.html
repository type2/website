Subject: Fuel gauge oddities in EV MV

EVers,

My buddy has a '93 EV MV that gives him erronious fuel level 
readings.  If I recall there were several others that had the same 
problem.  Is the answer in the vault of knowledge {archives}?  If so, 
I forget how to get into the archives;  if not, my bud needs your 
help.
