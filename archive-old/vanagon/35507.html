Subject: RE:  Weber Throttle Body

Several years ago, Weber made available for a short time an 
improved throttle body - slightly larger bore.  I tried to buy 
one of these a few years ago, but they had been discontinued 
by the time I heard about them.  Does any list member have one 
of these units, or any idea where to come up with one?  

A colleague of mine (Ben Watson author of several books on 
Bosch Fuel Injection Systems) are considering a research project 
on improving performance of the Vanagon Wasserboxer engine.  
Would list members be interested in increased performance if 
the items were bolt on and affordable?

I have previously mentioned one easy hop up available at engine 
overhaul is to stroke the 1.9 liter engine (involves modifying 
the crankshaft only) and installing 2.1 liter pistons.  If a 
camshaft regrind is incorporated at the same time, you can net 
a 15-20% increase in power. 

Let me know.

Fred
