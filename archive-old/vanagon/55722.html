In my limited experience, you really can't adjust the idle without also 
adjusting the idle mixture, especially on older cars which have a 
tendency to run rich anyway as the air meter starts to wear.  This sounds 
like a car that's running too rich.  Go out and adjust the idle mixture 
screw in (clockwise) and see if you don't get some improvement.

You can properly adjust the idle mixture using an ohm meter attached to 
your O2 sensor (the archives tell you how) or take it too a shop that has 
a CO meter; if you take it to a shop, make sure they take their reading 
BEFORE the catalytic converter.
