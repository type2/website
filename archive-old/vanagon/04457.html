Hmm.  I posted a couple weeks ago about finding a crunched '82 Westy that 
I was thinking of buying to fix up.  I decided to pass on a project of
that scale 
(having never welded before, and not having inexhautible supplies of cash to 
throw at a bodyshop).  Now I'm thinking: Will the 2000cc engine fit in my '74, 
and would it be possible to kludge all the camper bits to fit  my '74? 
For the 
asking price  of the '82 ($900), it'd be nice to get the fridge, stove, AND a 
1000-mile-old rebuilt engine. 

Anyone tried anything like this before? 

Thanks,
