    Now, I don't wanna start a war over the best tires to slap on a VW, but
Ramona's gonna be stepping on some hard country and I'll need some direction
when it comes time to get her some new shoes.
    I'm just looking for a decent set of good, all-around tires. I cannot
afford to spend $80 each. I really just need good size rec. 15's, yeah, but
what else???
TIA
Rach
A.K.A. Isn't she on the road yet?
