Joel:

Enjoyed the &quot;stoopid statz.&quot;  Questions for the list.  Are the 
double-cabs all of Canadian origin?  What is the &quot;Weekender&quot; variation 
listed for the 86 and 87 model years?   And what is the latest on 
introducing the VR6 EuroVans into the US?

Next question.  Has anybody tried swapping the Audi 5-cylinder into a 
Vanagon like the ones being produced in South Africa?

Lastly, I see a lot of posts about clutch problems.  Let's hear from 
some automatic owners.  As far as I know, the Volkswagen Transporter 
automatic transmission hasn't changed much since it was first introduced 
in 1973.  How are these units holding up?  What kinds of problems are 
people encountering with aging and higher mileage?
