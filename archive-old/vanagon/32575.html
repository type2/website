 How about holding up 2 fingers (like a peace sign) in the right hand, and 3
fingers in the left?   Might be hard to see while both are driving, however,
especially if there's any tintled glass involved.

Rusty adds:
Hard to do especially if you add the bungee, no clutch, no brake, worn and
wandering steering box, hand held via rope throttle return, hand out the
window turn signal, and the requsite 7-11 44oz Thirst Buster. Good idea!
It's perfect!
