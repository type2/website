Subject: 84 vanagon Problem

Hey all:

While driving back home from a weekend in Marin, I pulled out from a stop sign - 
went into first - no problem- as i accelerated, the transmission felt like it 
wanted to pop out ( or something- i've never experienced it before) it felt like 
the vanagon did not want to move, almost as if i had left the break on. So i 
pulled over. After a few seconds I put the vanagon back in gear, and the engine 
had no power. It stalled as i pulled out in first gear. So, i waited a few 
minutes (still have to get back over the golden gate bridge don't wanna break 
down there!) I started the bus up again. Engine would barely idle and any 
pressure to the gas pedal would cause it to cough and sputter-eventually die. 
This lasted three or four startings and deaths. Finally, the fifth try worked. I 
pressed the accelerator down and the engine felt like it coughed up a giant 
hairball.  I get &quot;plus&quot; gas-usually from shell and the tank was half full- all 
fluids where they should be. MAde it home under my own power, but the bridge was 
a bit neverwracking... Any ideas???

thanks
 Matt
