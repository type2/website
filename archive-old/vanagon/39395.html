Subject: Don't include msg. in reply

Many people seem to have missed our list.admin's plea to decrease the size 
and volume of our traffic through his University's server.  Specifically 
DON&quot;T INCLUDE THE WHOLE ORIGINAL MESSAGE WHEN YOU REPLY TO IT.  I hope it 
wasn't Friday OR 4/1 when that message posted...just trying to
&quot;Save Our List &quot;
