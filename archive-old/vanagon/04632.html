Subject: update on oil spray problem
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 09:55:43 -0600

Hi,
After following some suggestions from Joel, I think I have located the source
of the oil spray in my 1982 diesel vanagon. It seems that the head gasket is
bad in the area near cylinders #3 and 4.  The oil come out onto my engine
and then drips down my flywheel into my skid plate where the wind is kind
enough to blow it all over my vanagon's rear.  So, I need to replace the
head gasket.
Here's the first problem:
I am trying to order the head gasket but the following choices are possible:
(1) a 2 grove or a 3 grove gasket.  Does anyone know which I should use?
(2) thickness: 1.4,1.5 or 1.6 mm.  Same question here.  I guess I can measure
the edge of the old gasket to get this.
Finally, does anyone know the exact title and author of the Bentley manual
covering repairs in this vanagon?
Thanks for your help and suggestions!
Also, if you have suggestions and tips for replacing this head gasket, I would
love to hear them.
