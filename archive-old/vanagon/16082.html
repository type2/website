Nope, wrong answer.  The papers I have (if I ever find them) were done by 
the BMW motorcycle riders club, strictly non-profit.  As well as the 
papers done by the alternative energy BBS.  I'll hunt up their number 
tomorrow and post it with the issue number for you to peruse.

Yuasa already adds what I'm almost sure is nothing more than EDTA to 
their batteries.  They call it Sulfate Stop, and if you look at a new 
battery you'll see a white powdery substance across the top of the tank.  
I spoke with the local Interstate Battery rep a while back about 
marketing the product for me.  He informed me that they already added a 
&quot;white powder&quot; to their recycled batteries.  Unfortunately, he didn't 
know what it was...  

It's the wrong answer because the three causes of premature battery 
failure are freezing, open circuits caused by vibration and excessive 
sulfation, which is caused by discharge of the battery.  If they added 
EDTA to their batteries they couldn't sell so many could they?  All 
battery manufacturers know of the existance of EDTA and it's beneficial 
aspects.  They just choose not to add it, their tip of the hat to planned 
obsolescence.


&gt; 
&gt; Can you send us hard data performed by independent testing labs?
&gt; 

I'll dig out the papers I have and post them this weekend.
