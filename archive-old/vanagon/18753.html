	Well, I just spent over $100 on various new brake stuff, and putzed
around with my brakes for a few hours.  THis has been brake week:  Brakes
crapped out on da bus friday; &quot;fixed&quot; them on Saturday; crapped out twice
on Sunday; put new pads on 911 on Sunday evening; new front brakes on 
SO's 530i on Monday; did brakes on bus again Tuesday.  I get to do more on
the bus brakes and the rear brakes on my SO's BMW in the next couple of
days!

	Anyway, I replaced the rear shoes and the lines on the right side
(the rubber ones)  They were in nice shape and didn't really need it, but
now I know what I'm dealing with....

	The rear shoes were worn to the nubs.  Gone. Completely.  In less
that 2,000 miles!

	Anyway, I get it all buttoned up, and I pump the brakes a few times
and the light stays on.  The driver's rear wheel is locked, the passenger
rear is stiff but turns, and the front is dandy.  

	Diagnosis?  I think the rear return springs are too weak to push 
the brake fluid back, letting them drag.  I'm gonna try and find new springs
tomorrow - wish me luck!
