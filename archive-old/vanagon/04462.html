&gt; Hmm.  I posted a couple weeks ago about finding a crunched '82 Westy that 
&gt; I was thinking of buying to fix up.  I decided to pass on a project of
&gt; that scale 
&gt; (having never welded before, and not having inexhautible supplies of cash to 
&gt; throw at a bodyshop).  Now I'm thinking: Will the 2000cc engine fit in my '74, 
I believe it will fit, yes, but the vanagon engines have rectangular
exhaust ports while the earlier engines have oval ports (or less sqare,
anyway) so I'm almost positive the exhaust won't fit.  You can use the
shortblock as the basis for an engine for your 74 though.  Just put some
74 heads, intakes and carbs on it.

&gt; and would it be possible to kludge all the camper bits to fit  my '74? 

Definately!  

&gt; For the 
&gt; asking price  of the '82 ($900), it'd be nice to get the fridge, stove, AND a 
&gt; 1000-mile-old rebuilt engine. 

I priced those late model fridge/stove units at the junkyard.  They all
wanted around $500 for them.  Ugh!  I'd say the parts in that van are
worth a lot more than $900...
