&gt;proposed route: I-70 from Indianapolis to Cambridge Ohio. I-77 from 
&gt;Cambridge Ohio through Charleston WV, Charlotte NC, Columbia SC to 
&gt;Charleston SC. Going back it's Charleston SC to Columbia SC to Asheville 
&gt;NC to Knoxville TN, to Nashville TN, to Louisville KY, to Indianapolis.

&gt;My question is this: where will I be able to fine competent repair 
&gt;service along the way. If anyone has any ideas from anywhere along this 
&gt;route, please let me know. If anyone is touring through Indy, let me 
&gt;know. I'll be happy to set you up. 

I must put in a plug here for my favorite buggy shop in the world -- Keith's
Auto Parts in Clendenin, WV.  It's about 20 miles north of Charleston on WV
Rte. 4.  They do not have a service shop, but their prices on parts and their
machine shop are wonderful.  They could also probably point you to a local
VW repair joint should a crisis situation develop.  It's a tiny little
establishment, but the same 4 or 5 *very* knowledgeable folks have been running
the place since I started buying parts/machine work there 15 years ago.

You can call them to order parts at 1-800-RACE-A-VW.
