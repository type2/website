Subject: Re: My Apologies too/Bench Seat

my apologies too, for rants and raves.




Back to seats, the bench _will_ just fit, but even though I've done this with
mine I have never put the bench in a second time.  Just not worth the
hassles when
trying to get lunch on the road or grab a drink, and having to take it
outside at campsites etc. Also getting into the rear seat is essentially
impossible for anyone, inc children.

  If you want to try something which I think is more practical try to get a
look at an early 70's Westy and check out the rear facing seat.  They can be
mounted behind the front passengers seat, using fat sheet metal screws into
the wood floor panel with a sheet metal backing plate (not really secure!) I
did this in one vanagon. You get a huge storage area under the seat (or
porta-potti closet), and another behind the seat back. 
 Seat belt anchor for front passenger can hold half of the rear facing lap
belt, other half must be drilled/bolted through the pillar with seatbelt
grade hardware.  You will have to peel back the bottom 6&quot; of trim vinyl and
find a 2&quot; diameter plastic cover that lets you get inside the pillar.
Drill well below this hole for the belt mount, and use BIG washers to back
it up on both sides.  You can get the nut, your fingers  and a wrench in via
the 2&quot; hole. This is not a
seat I'd want to be in in event of a major crash.

This keeps 'full' floor space, works with both the tables and gives the cook
a place to sit/work.  It also comes out with 6 screws in a minute. Does not
require cutting etc. the carpet.  The 2 seater bench on the other hand is
about as useful as those in a city bus.  Hope this helps.

bye, Tim
