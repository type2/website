Good Pizza and lots of vw talk last evening at East Side Mario's in Bells
Corners.  Sure would have liked to see more of you there * Next time *. 
Markus suggested we get one of every Pizza on the menu so we did and
shared them.  YUM !  Markus came with his cherry super bug convetible ,
WITH THE TOP DOWN IN OTTAWA FINALLY.  My westy was the only van (:-(.   So
next time I want to see some others.  We are taking our westy for the
first camp out of the season this week-end (eat your hearts out you
californians) down by the Mississipi River in Pakenham.  Yes there is a
Mississippi River in Ontario and NO it's not the same as yours.  There's a
BIG two day, indoor, comunity garage sale there and we've reserved a place
so that's part of the deal.  Seeya there if you come.

Cheers

Frank
