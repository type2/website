Subject:      Subaru Engine Longblock Source

For any of you contemplating putting
a Subaru engine into your Vanagon, check out
the following site:
http://www.rsengines_dot_com

I got a quote for a low mileage used, tested, warranted
longblock for my aging 200K '87 Subaru for $600, no
exchange.  Obviously you'd need to get a junker
motor to get all the peripheral goodies.  Just thought
I'd provide a source for the basic engine if the junker
you got turned out to have a shot lower end or heads.
