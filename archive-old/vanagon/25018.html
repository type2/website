     &gt;Another intersting score was a set of chrome and glass driving
     &gt;goggles - $1 at a garage sale on the way home!  Also got a sears 30 
     &gt;gal wet/dry shop vac for $10, and about 15 feet of tubing for it!
     &gt;
     &gt;Also saw several BMW's (bavarias, 530is, and 02's) a Lancia,
     &gt;and a corvair
