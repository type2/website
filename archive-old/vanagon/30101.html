Subject: Emissions Inspection 1980 Vanagon Westfalia

I recently bought a 1980 Vanagon Westfalia.  I recently determined that one of the previous owners installed a different exhaust system than the factory.  The 
replacement system appears to have the muffler attached to the heat exchangers - no Catalytic Converter .  I am concerned about this because I live in a city 
where certain vehicles must pass an emissions test before passing the North Carolina Department of Transportation inspection.  I have three questions:

1.  Is the 1980 exempt from this emissions testing because of its age?
2.  If not, can I just install a Catalytic Converter onto the exhaust system?
3.  If not who can suggest a reasonably priced exhaust system?

Thanks again...
