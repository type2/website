Subject: Alloy Wheels FS


	I have a set of factory alloy wheels off of a syncro that I need
to sell. They are in excellent condition, but do not have any hubcaps.  I
will sell them all for $500 plus shipping. If you are interested please
email me ASAP...as soon as I get the Westfalia on the road I'm outta
here:)  TIA
