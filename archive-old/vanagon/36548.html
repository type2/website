Subject: More Mexican Busses

All,

With the engine type in Mexican Busses answered, my next question is
this:

What is it about the new VW's that cannot be imported in to the US?
Not the emmissions. It's appearently the safety requirements are not
being met.  I'm wondering if one could call a dealership, or VW Mex. and
have a long block, including the FI &quot;brain&quot; shipped here to the US?
The remainder could be fabricated/procured for a minimum of
$$$(relative).  What do ya'll think?

More thinking, I'm on a roll now!

Cheers,

David
