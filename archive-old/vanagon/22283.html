Re:&quot;I could be mistaken but I don't believe the EV Westy 'CAMPER' was sold in 
     this country.  I know I've never seen one.  THe Westy toped weekender was 
     sold but I don't think there is much crossover in parts beyond the 
     standard Volkswagen stuff.

    BUT if you come down through the Washington Metropolitan area  wave when 
    you're on '95 south of DC.  I've seen more Eurovans in this area than 
    anyone else seems to have seen in the rest of the country.&quot;


Even the standard Volkswagen stuff would be great.  We have very little in the
way of Eurovan accessories here in Canada.  But then again I shouldn't complain
since we did get the Eurovan Wesfalia. &lt;g&gt;


I'll definitely wave on the I 95.

Thanks !
