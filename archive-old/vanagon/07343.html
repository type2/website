Subject: a  really cool VW

A friend of mine had a really cool VW.  It was a phone repair vehicle from
Germany.  Basically it was a bus on a bug chassis.  Someone had converted
it into a camper, but most of the original interior was intact.  It had
beautifully made wood cabinets for tools and the like and a collapsable
front passenger seat so there was more interior room when needed.  The
front end looked like an oversized Bug with a big wrap around windshield. 
There was a gas heater up front, under the hood, near the gas tank and
spare tire.   We figured it was from the mid sixties based on the running
gear.  It had Bus type sliding doors on both sides and these extended from
the front seats back.  You folded back the front seats to get into the rear
compartment.  The doors locked open so you could drive with them that way. 
 I've never seen one of these around since... Anyone else?
