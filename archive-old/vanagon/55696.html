Subject: What tools, books, other do you suggest?

Hi all,
	With the new Van, I'm interested in buying any books or tools 
needed to maintain it.  Any suggestions on WHAT books/tools to use and 
WHERE I can get them?  
	Also, is there anything else I CAN'T live without?  I 
am interested in both necessities AND accessories that y'all find 
outstanding.

Talk soon
Thanks
Thad
