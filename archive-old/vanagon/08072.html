Subject: RE: vanagon cold oil warning system

&gt; I have had a similiar oil pressure warning light and buzzer problem, however
&gt; it is not related to cold temperatures.  Actually perhaps the opposite.
&gt; After cruising the turnpike at 65-70 for over 1 hour when I  slow down on
&gt; the exit ramp, the oil light at warning buzzer will come on.  If I momentarily
&gt; depress the clutch and rev the engine for a couple of seconds, the warning
&gt; light/buzzer go out.  This may repeat for several times over the next
&gt; several miles of slower driving.
&gt; 
&gt; Its been irratic.  Hasn't done it in the last 5 months.  The dealer didn't
&gt; know what it was.  Suggested perhaps the pressure relief valve.  I also do not
&gt; know which sensor is responsible for the buzzer warning.  I haven't checked
&gt; the Bentley manual in awhile, but it seemed like the buzzer warning may
&gt; somehow be indicating which sensor is acting up, but this may be my
&gt; imagination!!!

  The description you give here sounds more like a real problem to me than 
  the cold/low oil pressure combination. I think you may have low oil pressure
  due to high oil temperature. The fact that it hasn't happened it the last
  five months suggests that it may occur more often in the summer, which
  wouldn't be a surprise. A co-worker of mine with an '87 Westfalia described
  a similar situation when he was towing a trailer with motorcycles on it. 
  Also, we learned from the wear index that piston speed is higher on a Syncro
  than a 2wd Vanagon - a very likely result of that would be higher oil
  temperatures due to the increase in friction.
