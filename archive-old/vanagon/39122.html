Jerry Jeff Walker brings drinking and driving to mind! ;-)
*Note: That is if Jerry's behind the wheel. Hahahaha!

I tend to think of:
* Allman Brothers Live _at_ the Fillmore on 8-track: big ol' BRRRRRUBPT CLICK
CLICK noise right in the middle of Hot 'Lanta... =)

* &quot;The Band&quot; at the Big Pink

* Doors' Texas Road house Blues/Texas Radio and the Big Beat on a slightly
dragging sun warpped cassette (makes Morrison sound like he was really on
methatdone)

**Politically correct disclamer**
NO DRINKING AND DRIVING ~EVER!
(the bus you save might be your own)
