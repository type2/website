Sounds like a gasoline auxiliary heater.  Some people love'em, others
hate'em.  Make sure it's played with by somebody that knows what
they're doing.

The Raid foggers that are purple and orange work really well.  Since
you've taken out the headliner, you're set.  The one problem is that
they shoot the fog straight up about seven feet, and the typical bus
isn't quite that tall, so you get condensation on the ceiling.  If you
still have the headliner (or wood, for the camper-types), tape a
paper grocery bag up above where you'll be aiming the bug bomb.
Remember to throw it out after the three hours.  Plan on vacuuming up
lots of dead bodies....
