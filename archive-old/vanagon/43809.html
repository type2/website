In digest 980, SStones comment appeared about stopping  a diesel engine with a
ball peen hammer --&quot;On Thu, 6 Jun 1996, brian verbeek wrote:

&gt; Hi Martha,
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; 1.  If I run out of diesel, what happens if I get stuck and put
&gt; &gt;     regular gas into the car?  Explosion?
&gt; 
&gt; You have to use diesel again and the air that entered the fuel system
&gt; must be bled (sp?) out of it, just like a brake system, some cars
&gt; have a handpump on the fuel filter to do that. Putting normal gas in a
&gt; diesel will give a lot of power and will destroy the engine in a
&gt; few minutes, the diesel has a very high compression ratio compared
&gt; to a gas engine (2 to 3 times as high) it will constantltly detonate,
&gt; pre-ignite etc, ytou may even find that the only thing that will stop
&gt; a diesel running on gas is blocking the air inlet.

Do not use your bare hand for this job.
Smack the fuel pump with a ball peen hammer.&quot;

I have to appreciate that he was joking, but some of you non bunker burners
(or novice bunker burners) might take him seriously and I must  say that is a
sure way to risk having to buy a new injection pump for anywhere from $500-750
dollars depending if used/rebuilt or new.  

The injection pump has very tight internal tolerances around the internal
moving parts, and is in a reasonably soft metal body.  A hammer wack may
impart sufficient permenant distortion of the body housing to cause leaking
and or malfunction/jamming.  In fact, NEVER hose down a diesel engine to clean
it unless it is STONE COLD!.  Again, it gets back to imposing stress (in this
case thermal from cold water and a warm/hot injection pump) that can
dimensionally stress or warp the injector pump housing.
