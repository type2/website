Subject: Re: shower in a westy!

&gt;My plan is to take a rubbermaid 10 gallon tub and put it up
&gt;in the luggage rack of the westy.  This would then be covered
&gt;with some sort of clear plastic bubble, rather like a skylight.  The
&gt;tub will be black, or painted black, then filled with water.  This
&gt;is all obviously done while parked, and the car won't be driven
&gt;while the tub is full.  Anyway, like a solar shower, it sits
&gt;out in the sun, and is supposed to reach temperatures warm
&gt;enough for a shower within 3 hours or so.  (Or, one could always
&gt;boil water and add it thru the screened window if the water
&gt;needed to be hotter).  Then lay a hose in the tub (thermometer
&gt;in there if you like) and run it the length of the westy,
&gt;plus another 3-5 feet, ending in a shower head, with an
&gt;on/off button at the handle, sort of a phone shower I guess.
&gt;The water flow could be started either by siphon, or cordless
&gt;pump (JC Whitney).  A shower curtain attaches around the
&gt;edges of the rear hatch door, which is lifted.  A second curtain can
&gt;also go right where the hatch would be if it were down,
&gt;to protect the interior of the van from getting wet.  Depending
&gt;on location of &quot;shower,&quot; grey water can be collected in another
&gt;rubbermaid tub, (which, when not in use, will nestle under
&gt;the one above in the luggage rack), and emptied at the
&gt;appropriate location.
&gt;
&gt;The luggage rack in my '81 is rated to hold not in excess of
&gt;110 pounds, and 10 gallons of water weighs about 80 pounds.  This
&gt;leaves extra allotment for the skylight bubble, and the weight
&gt;of the tub, and altogether would probably still not exceed
&gt;the 110 lbs.  One would have to stand on some sort of rack
&gt;or mat to avoid getting muddy feet, but otherwise, I don't see
&gt;why this wouldn't work, except that I'm not sure how much
&gt;of a shower 10 gallons is.  Anyone have an idea?
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, would like further input on this...thanks!

Sounds very practical to me.  I have three suggestions:
1)experiment with a black cover as well as a clear cover.  Maybe the black
cover needs to be in contact with the water for best solar absorption, though.
2)what about a 12V pump? You could wire this into a cigarette lighter plug
for portable use.  Marine pumps would be a possible source.  If your shower
head is lower than the tank, you won't need a pump to get water out, but
you'll only have about a 1ft. drop at best (how tall are you?), so there
won't be much pressure unless you boost it with a pump.  I suspect your
water use would be more efficient with a directed spray rather than a
hose-like trickle.
3)with a pressure building pump, you could also try out a low water use
shower head.

Keep us posted if this gets to the testing stage.  I'd like to know if it
works well.
