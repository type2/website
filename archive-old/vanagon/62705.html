Subject: tool for oil relief valve?

I searched the archives and found someone crafter one from some 
woodworking tools.  I am not so equipped, so can anyone recommend 
another solution?  It almost looks like I should be able to do it 
with a silver dollar and a vise grip (not seriously though).  

I'm sure there's an &quot;official&quot; tool from VW that costs $199.95.  :-P

Regards,

-Karl
