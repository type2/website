Subject: did i buy bad brake pads??? help:)
Date: Fri, 17 Nov 1995 12:21:07 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;A Brandon Smith&quot; &lt;brandys_at_ichips.intel_dot_com&gt;

hello all,
	i bought some pads for my front disc breaks and i am a little
suspicious that they may be used.  can you somehow &quot;rebuild /
recondition&quot; these things?  both my bentrly manual and muir show the
pads as having a groove in the center.  the ones i bought are
perfectly flat!  is this right or am i getting ripped off?  and how
much should i expect to pay?  i paid $22 for all four.  what do you
all think?

thanks and take care,
		  brandy
