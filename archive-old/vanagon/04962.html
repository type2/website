Subject: Eurovan: oil over-fill
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 94 11:22:52 CDT


I have had a small oil leak since I had my oil changed at Jiffy Lube by
a couple of HS students. I should have suppected a problem when I had
to get under the van and show them how to get the access plate off to
get to the filter.  At one point, the manager also was up under the van
as well.  When the dip stick was shown to me when the job was finished,
it appeared that the oil level was correct.

After about five days, and driving the van for about 400 miles, I noticed that
the temp. guage was running a little higher than normal.  When the oil was
checked (by me), I noticed that the dip stick had not been pushed all the
way in.  The oil level was way above the full mark.  The person that changed
the oil evidently did not put the dip stick all the way back into the stick
hole and must have put about 3/4 to a whole quart more of 10/30 Mobil 1
than the maximum.

I took the van back in and had the oil completely drained and re-filled
at no charge.  I was also given discount coupons on future oil changes
from the manager mentioned above.  I was informed that the two individuals
that had changed the oil in my van had been fired because of problems with
other customers as well.  I am satisfied that they worked to correct the
problem.

I requested that the drain plug and the oil filter be checked to make sure that
they were tight as I was starting to see the oil leak before I came back in.
After refilling the oil, the temp. came back down but the oil leak still
remains (two or three spots after stopping with the engine hot).  It is not a
bad leak but is enough to mess up the garage floor.  What gets me upset is the
fact that I did not have this problem until the oil was over-filled.

I have not had much luck in trying to find the leak.  I was wondering
if the oil filter had been damaged because of the pressure.  When the
oil was re-drained, it came out like a high-pressure hose.  Anyone
have a comment on what could be causing the leak?
