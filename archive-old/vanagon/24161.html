Subject:       front end

recently i came across a '72 bus with an emaculate interrior and 
exterrior REALLY cheep, the engine is also ok. The only problem is 
that the two tubes and brackets that hold the entire front end 
together are severely rusted and beginning to bend.  Does anyone know 
what it would involve to do the repair myself, of a good detroit 
local repair facility, or where to get the parts cheep?
