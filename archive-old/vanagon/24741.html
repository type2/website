Subject: Re: Waving Vanagon drivers (again)

Mike,  	
	I don't wave to any other than pre-68 vans.  They don't either.  
Only, maybe, 1 out of ten split window care not to greet by waving.
I doubt even that many.  This may jinx me for life, but I have never been 
stopped along the road for over 60 seconds before someone in a VW Bus has 
stopped to my rescue(never needed).  I have driven for days north of Death 
Valley with out seeing any other than old split window buses.  So, I am 
on this list.  Wave to all.  Gary Gibson
