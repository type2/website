Hi Jean Baptiste,

Next week I leave the San Francisco Bay area for Toronto and will leave
Toronto on the 7th to reach SF by the 13th. 
Our tentative return route is:
Niagra Falls	Buffalo		Pittsburgh	St. Louis	Kansas
City	Topeka	Salina	Denver	Cheyenne	Salt Lake City	Winnemucca	Reno 	Fremont

Hope to see you at the campout, and maybe even on the way back, 

Have a safe trip.			Joe Ernest
