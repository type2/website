Subject:       fuel mileage

Hi group-
I would be very curious (and appreciative) if people would post their 
fuel mileage they are getting with their various rigs out their.  It 
would give us all an idea of what to expect from different 
engines/configurations as we continue our search for that ultimate 
van.  It also is a good overall indicator of engine health. Those of you not bogged
 down in the U.S. nomenclature of *miles per gallon* are welcome to post km per
 liter or whatever you use.  We can figure it out -- it'll be our punishment for not 
going metric when we had the chance.
