Hello Richard and other list members,,

	I have some info from '94 at home for a company named Adventure
Verks, I can not remember were I got it, and I have never worked with this
company.  They are located in Bellingham, and LA among other places.  Their
phone number is 1 800 rentvws.  A weeks rental in '94 was between $500 to
$700 depending on your mileage package and extras.  I think they will also
deliver a vehicle for a price.

	Thank You.
