Subject: Howdy from Poor Richard on the road

Howdy all! What a long strange trip it's been indeed! For those not familiar
with my situation, my '67 camper, and a roommate's 70 camper, along with six
fine upstanding citizens (yes, *us* !) are traveling about this fine country
of ours. While we have had our share of problems, we have always been
miraculously near kind folks who have helped us out. First, Uncle Joel put
us up for a couple days while we replaced pushrod tubes. Then, my engine
threw in the towel in Albuquerque, due to some case sealant blocking up oil
galleys. (Be really careful putting those cases, together, kids. That engine
only lasted about 4000 miles) Anyway, Michael, of NEATO, was kind enough to
supervise a complete rebuild. At this moment, I am writing from Jim Kirk's
house, in Indiana. The throw-out bearing arm crapped out just after we
arrived in town, so once again, there are engines strewn about the driveway.
  Anyway, despite all this, we've been having a blast. We have had a chance
to help out a lot of clueless bus newbies, who often have no idea how to
treat a bus. In Boulder, we had 6 busses lined up on a street for a few
days, while doing brake work and other things. I must say, brakes are SO
much easier before '70!!!!
  We have met a lot of really kind folks everywhere, and had a lovely time.
After catching the Furthur Festival tomorrow (and putting the '70 back
together) we are headed to Missouri for the Rainbow gathering. We are not
sure what will happen after that; it's up to time and money. I'm selling
t-shirts along the way, and others are selling patchwork dresses and hats
and such. I have been amazed at all the different folks that have bought
split-window bus t-shirts. 
 Anyway,  I will hopefully have some sort of internet access when I get back
to Raleigh, so I'll post a complete report then.  So, til then, have fun,
and enjoy your busses!
