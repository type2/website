Subject: Vanagon:Gas Heater:Noise:Ugly

What gas heater related components are under the dash?  The reason I ask 
is that twice today (about 3 minutes after starting up the heater on my 
'81 Vanagon) a very loud noise was generated.  I sounded like a blower 
motor going bad.  It continued while the heater went through its 
cool-down cycle (I shut it down immediately).  This is not in any way 
related to the multi-speed fan controlled by the switch on the dash.  
What gives?  Very ugly noise ... didn't like it. :(
