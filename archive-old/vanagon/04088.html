&gt; This is my first week back at work after 3 weeks vacation, I'm trying
&gt; to maintain that holiday relaxation state-of-mind for more than a
&gt; couple of days. 
&gt; It's interesting to review the mail for the last 3 weeks, how some
&gt; subjects keep surfacing, (hey Joel, can you plot the occurances of
&gt; some particular threads, 12 V outlets in dash, tires, etc. and then
&gt; predict their next appearance?).
