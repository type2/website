I reccomend both a Haynes AND Bentley. The Haynes is great with
descriptions and instructions, but their photo's and illustrations aren't 
all that great. The Bentley has got good photo's and excellent schematics,
but is a bit short on descriptions/instructions. Having a copy of both is
a winning combination.

My $0.02

Cheers, Chris
