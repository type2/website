Subject: opinion sought - viability of 2WD Vanagon as a ski-mobile

Greetings,

I'm beginning a search for Vanagon for a family ski use. A syncro would be
good but regular Vanagons are more plentiful (and very cheap).  I seek
advise regarding the on-snow performance (traction/braking) of standard
Vanagons.  I envision using Bridgeston Blizzaks (or the like) on all four
wheels as I've used such tires on my Golfs and Jettas with great success.

I've also been thinking about a diesel to gas conversion as I have a spare
16V engine taking up space in the garage.  Yes, I know this may be a
hair-brained scheme but I like big projects . . .

Please advise.  Thanks.
