Subject: baja substitution


Well, apathy still reigns (do you people fail to show up for national
elections, too?), but counting the votes of those who bothered to
hit the reply (and tainting things with the few &quot;conversations&quot; I've
had with other on the matter), it seems that our group in general feels
it would be best to postpone the trip to Baja until a) more members
can attend, and b) our leadership can make it schedulewise.

However, fortunately, enough of you seem to still want to go camping
that weekend, meaning Friday thru Sunday, the last weekend in October.
Trying to be fair, it looks like something along the latitude of
San Luis Obisop/Bakersfield/etc. would be about half way between people
coming from both north and south.  If no one has to drive inordinately
far, hopefully, it will be more appealing, and more will come.

Here's who I'm pretty sure will come for sure:

Please let me know your decisions, either way, so that this thing
can finally get underway! I move that we go up towards the mountains
east of Bakersfield, since some of you expressed the wish to go where
it is not hot (AC not working, etc.).  Bradley-pyro has suggested
a place north-west of where we went when we went to Red Rock (and this
place should be much quicker to get to).  It's called Lake Isabella,
and there looks to be a LOT of choices for both commercial and free
campsites in that vicinty, with the former being very reasonably priced
($8-12).  B is I think going to check up for us on one that appealed
to him, which I think may be quite close to the lake.

If some of you from the list told me earlier that you definitely were
not able to make the Baja trip, but these same people now think they
CAN make this trip because it is closer, please let me know, and I'll
add you back to the list.
