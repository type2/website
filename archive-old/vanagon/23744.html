Subject: Strange Running Problem Solved
Date: Mon, 28 Aug 1995 22:43:27 -0700 (PDT)

Yo,
	I was having  strange problem with my bus.  Over the last week,
it was running worse and worse.  When I got home today, I started poking
around, and then it wouldn't start at all!

	Turns out i had no spark.  So I pop the dist cap, and have the
SO crank it, and I basically had &quot;infinite dwell&quot; - the screw holding
the points down was loose, letting the points float until they didn't 
close anymore!

	I also fixed my binding throttle cable by drilling a new hole 
in the fan shroud for the carrier tube.  Ya see, I have one of those
extendo thingie for the intake manifold for the carb to sit on, and that
changed the angle for the tube, thus stressing both tube and cable...

	Da bus runns MUCH better now, a LOT peppier!  That combined
with the new, taller tires meand I can almost, but not quite, totally not
compete with traffic.
