Subject: Grendel, Thurs IIa



Thursday morning, about 0600

Dawn is trying to break through the overcast.  No rain.  Today is the day the
drum drops off and I learn the cause of Grendel's wobbly legs.

Removing the drum is a necessary step.  The alternative is to cut off the
axle tube and the forged steel axle within it, slide off the remains of the
axle tube, release the snap ring securing the axle within the differential
carrier and replace everything, including a new emergency brake cable, since
all of these things are terminated withing the citadel of the brake drum; if
you can't pull the drum you can't free the e-brake cable nor dismantle the
outboard gear box to get at the end of the axle.

I'm pleased that a number of you have found these daily notes of interest.
 I've tried to provide a mix of information and narrative so the notes will
be of  mechanical benefit.  But I don't want it to turn into a soap opera.
 I'm dealing with a mechanical problem.  There are some personal problems
that dictate how I deal with the mechanicals, and even a few philosophical
points that have tilted the playing field but the bottom line is performing a
repair in the field with limited resources.  There is also a good chance that
the other problems have skewed my perceptions, I could be making a mess of
things, or overlooking an easier path to the top of this mountain.  Indeed,
this partiular mountain may well be a mole-hill, blown out of proportion by
my situation.  Please keep these things in mind and read my notes with a
critical eye.  If you see something I appear to have overlooked, please give
me the benefit of your advice.

As to the question of rewarding my host for putting up with me, that's a
personal matter I've already taken steps to deal with.  The most immediate
need for them and me is to see Grendel's tail lights winking down the drive.
 Once I'm home some very nice things will happen and we will all look back on
this visit with smiles.

Right now, I'm waiting for the hardware store to open.  

-Bob
