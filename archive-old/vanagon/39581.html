Subject: Re: Front turn lenses '72 bus

&gt;The '72 shares the front brakes with my '71 so
&gt;I keep my eyes open for them.  Calipers and disks for these are tres 
&gt;tres expensive.  Jim

I've just been contemplating the price of new calipers for my 71.  Here's a
list of some prices that I just received after calling around some FLAPS in
Connecticut and looking at a couple mail order catalogs:

Rocky Mt Motor Works    Caliper         $178   (Must be new!)
                        Rotor           $73.50 (New)

Mofoco                  Caliper         $53.13  plus $27 core charge
(rebuilt, but not 
                                                by Mofoco)
                        Rotor           $36.00  (New)

Some Local Connecticut FLAPS prices:

Auto Palace             Caliper         $58.80 plus $5 core (remanufactured,
lifetime
                                                warrantee)

Foreign Parts Warehouse Caliper         $55.00 plus $7 core (remanufactured
by Marks 
                                                brakes in New York)

Foreign Autoparts       Caliper         $74.99 includes pads and all hardware
                                                90 day warrantee
(remanufactured by 
                                                C&amp;W in Massachusetts)

I just paid $40 each for NEW Rabbit calipers, but considering the 71-72 bus
calipers are a 2 year only item the remanufactured price doesn't seem that
bad.  I'd be interested in hearing from those who have had success or
failure stories with remanufactured 71-72 calipers.  I would guess that few
buy the $178/ caliper from RMMW.
