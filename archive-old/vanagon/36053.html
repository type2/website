&gt;&gt;ked and slithered in the background for long enough, at long=20
last,
&gt;&gt;I write.  My girlfriend Whitney and I have just purchased our=20
first VW, an
&gt;&gt;=9188 Westy with 98,000 miles (great condition) with the intention=20
of
&gt; driving
&gt;&gt;it from San Francisco through Mexico at least as far as=20
Guatemala.  We=92re
&gt;&gt;heading south in about a week and plan on traveling for about six=20
months
&gt; or
&gt;&gt;so.  What we=92d really like to do is drive it to Panama, then put=20
it on a
&gt;boat
&gt;&gt;to Alaska and drive it back from there, or to Florida and drive=20
home
&gt;&gt;cross-country.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I=92ve traveled a bit, but not with a vehicle, and I=92ve never owned=20
or
&gt; worked
&gt;&gt;on a VW.  As a result, I=92m quite confident when I say that I have=20
no idea
&gt;&gt;what we=92re getting into.  We=92ve had the van thoroughly
&gt;&gt;inspected/tuned/prepped at Gandalf=92s Garage in South San Francisco (a=
nd
&gt;&gt;they=92ve been really great) and it seems to be pretty road worthy, but=
 I=92ve
&gt;&gt;got some questions about a long road trip like this in Mexico.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1.  What kind of tools should I bring?  I=92m mechanically inclined, bu=
t
&gt;pretty
&gt;&gt;much clueless about working on the van.  I=92m thinking about getting a=
 good
&gt;&gt;harness and length of rope so I can strap myself like a sled dog to the
&gt;front
&gt;&gt;bumper and tow it to a garage when I need to.  Don=92t tell me to bring=
 a
&gt;&gt;super-twisto-double-spanner-wizzlethorp because I wouldn=92t know what =
to do
&gt;&gt;with it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;2.  What kind of spare parts should I bring?  Someone said the tires ar=
e
&gt;hard
&gt;&gt;to get in that size if they need replacing.  Should I have both a good
&gt; spare
&gt;&gt;and an extra (6th) tire, or is that overkill?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;3.  I=92ve been told that the catalytic converter can plug up and cause
&gt;&gt;problems with Mexican gas.  I=92ve gotten a converter that is just a tu=
be
&gt; with
&gt;&gt;no insides that I could put on after we=92re over the border, then swit=
ch it
&gt;&gt;back before we come back to California.  Is that either necessary or a =
bad
&gt;&gt;idea for any reason?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;4.  I=92ve read various comments about over-heating brakes.  This weeke=
nd on
&gt;&gt;the way back from Yosemite, going down Old Priest Grade (Old Mill Grade=
??)
&gt;on
&gt;&gt;Highway 120 (it=92s a VERY steep section) the brakes faded and the fron=
t
&gt;brakes
&gt;&gt;got so hot there was smoke pouring from them before I realized what was
&gt;&gt;happening.  Is that normal for this car or do I have a problem?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;5.  What have I forgotten to ask??  I know about sulfate-free coolant; =
I
&gt; can
&gt;&gt;only assume that=92s available in Mexico.  Anything special about oil?
&gt;&gt; Anything else?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance for anyone=92s helpful comments.  I=92m on digest, so=
 if you
&gt;&gt;could also mail comments to me directly I=92d really appreciate it.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;An additional note:  when the list gets split as it inevitably will (qu=
it
&gt;&gt;fighting it, you whiners, it's just a matter of time), please sign me u=
p
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;the white-=9288-Westy/Northern-California/not-really-a-mechanic version=
..
&gt;&gt; That=92s not too much to ask, is it?  (Did anyone get apoplectic befor=
e
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;got it?  Passions do tend to run high in this group.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;And another note:  we=92re taking an old =91386 portable computer with =
us and
&gt;&gt;using AOL=92s Mexico service to send and receive e-mail on the road.  W=
e=92re
&gt;&gt;planning to have a web site that our friend will be posting our e-maile=
d
&gt;&gt;newsletters to.  I=92ll let you know the address of it when I know it.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Inresponse to all of the above, I offer the following tidbits:
&gt;
&gt;You don't say whether your van is an auto, manual, or syncro.  The trans=
'
&gt;should be serviced.  The most common cause of auto trans failure is the
&gt; final
&gt;drive running low on gear oil and then self destructing.  I do recomend
&gt;synthetic oils for the engine and transmisions.  I would also have the C=
V
&gt;joints insected and packed with fresh grease. Get the gfrease from the
&gt; dealer
&gt;or use AMSOIL synthetic Moly Heavy duty grease.  The wheel bearings shou=
ld
&gt;also be greased. The rears can be greased by removing the wheel hub and
&gt; using
&gt;a needle inserted between the rollers, fill the cavity with fresh grease=
.=20
&gt;
&gt;For the engine, I recomend 20-50 for the service you will be putting it
&gt;through.  See owners manual.  I use Mobil-1 15-50 all year and have had
&gt; very
&gt;good results.  My wifes Rabbit has almost 240K on the original engine.  =
I
&gt;would consider adding an oil temparature gauge.  This will tell you when=
 to
&gt;back off the throttle when going up hills or traveling at high speed.  T=
he
&gt;water cooling is ideal in this vehicle,  Oil temps however can push 280 =
or
&gt;better.  This will destroy seals.  I use an oil cooler on my Vanagons.=20
&gt; Also,
&gt;oil level is extremely important.  Never, never, never, overfill.  Keep =
oil
&gt;between the lines for best lubrication.  Check with engine warm, van lev=
el,
&gt;and let oil return to pan before checking,(about 5 minutes).  1extra cup
&gt;raises oil temp by 20 or 30 degrees, even with large auxillary cooler.  =
Do
&gt;not be tempted that more is better.  Drain excess if you make a mistake.
&gt;I wouls also change the power steering fluid.  Have the system flushed t=
o
&gt;remove al the old junk.
&gt;
&gt;Change the brake fluid also.  Speaking of brakes, the pads and shoes fro=
m
&gt; the
&gt;dealer work best for stopping ability and fade resistance.  The factory
&gt; rears
&gt;are mettalic. I have not found an after market source that does it right=
.=20
&gt; My
&gt;camper has 126K with the original shoes.  I will replace with same.  My
&gt;fronts were repalced at 87 with aftermarket &quot;silver supremes&quot;. Van does =
not
&gt;stop well and rotors are now warped.  Didn't save much money either.
&gt;
&gt;How old is water pump?  Expect 60K or so to be replacement territiry.  K=
eep
&gt;spare.  Primary coolant bottle is another failure ite, (the one with the
&gt;pressure cap).  If yellow, replace.  How about alternator?  Remove
&gt; regulator
&gt;and check brushes.  Replae if brushes are worn.  Also check bearings.  T=
hey
&gt;have a nasty habit of failing.  If they go, you are stuck as this belt a=
lso
&gt;drives the water pump.  If alternator is original, replace bearings and
&gt;regulator/ brush assembly before trip.=20
&gt;
&gt;As for tires, if replacing before trip, consider a size that is readily
&gt;available.  Actually consider brand.  If national brand, they can shipp
&gt;anywhere you need them.  Goodyear or sears maybe good choices.  Consider
&gt;215-70/14 with standard load ratings.  The extra size will hold the wieg=
ht
&gt;with no problem,(1554lbs each), and provide better ride and handling.
&gt; During
&gt;travel to Alaska, you will travel many unpaved roads.  I did it in 93. Y=
ou
&gt;need a tire with strong sidwalls to resist the rocks.  I used Bridgeston=
e
&gt;HP-41 potenza's.  They worked great, no flats in 12,000 miles.=20
&gt; Unforunately,
&gt;they are no longer available. Turanza is new replacement in that size.=20
&gt; Great
&gt;tire except not as good in snow.  Goodyear GSA or Pirelli APT-400 should=
 be
&gt;excelent tires for this trip.
&gt;
&gt;As far as oyur CAT question, I do not know what gas is available.  If yo=
u
&gt;eliminate the CAT, you still need the O2 sensor.  It will also be destro=
yed
&gt;by leaded fuel.  Bring a spare.  Unleaded fuel should be available in
&gt; Mexico.
&gt;
&gt;For spare parts, consider water pump, fuel pump. ignition wires,(or at
&gt; least
&gt;the spark plug connectors, they tend to short out, especially if they ar=
e
&gt;aftermarket),  Oil and oil filters. Air filter due to the dust, and belt=
s.
&gt; Some pieces of hose and clamps for the cooling system may be a god idea
&gt;also.
&gt;
&gt;I hope this answered some of your questions.
&gt;Good Luck, and keep on Busin'
