&lt;&lt; Hello;  I finally found the time to check out the problem with the digital
 clock constantly cycling the hours.  I took out the dash to get at the
 clock, the little target-like plastic peices that you push against when you
 adjust the clock had fallen doown and got itself trapped under the plunger
 (that actuallly does the electrical work that changes the time) I just
 re-aligned the little targets, and re-assembled the dash. Everything works.
&gt;&gt;

the DPO of my van was SO LAZY that when this happened, (BTW, a 2 minute
repair) they went out and bought a cheapo &quot;stick on&quot; digital clock from
K-mart and stuck it over the digital clock which had been cycling
constantly......

well....same DPO took the easy way out and just bypssed the rear htr core
when it starting leaking also...., so I'm not suprised...  :&lt;(  ( all it was
was the little white plastic relief valve...another 2 minit fix....)
