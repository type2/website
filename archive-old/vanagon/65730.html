Subject:      '78 bus for sale

Got this today from an off-line acquaintance of an on-line friend (got-it?):

&gt; Bus for sale:
&gt; Its a 1978 Grand Sport, has an automatic transmission and air conditioning
&gt; ( which they just had converted to R134 and is pretty much new).  Both
&gt; the 2000 engine and tranny were rebuilt a few thousand miles ago.   Her
&gt; and her husband bought it at a show a few years back, but now they are
&gt; buying a new mazda (some people) and need to get ris of it.  she was
&gt; asking 4800 but was 'somewhat flexible'.
&gt;
&gt;  I know nothing about busses, so She could be crazy on price or
&gt; ewhatever- she said it owas the only year like that and It was a beauty.
&gt;
&gt; her number is 813-787-2285.  I think thats only her daytime number-  her
&gt; name is Linda Hinton.

I believe it's in Palm Harbor, FL (taking a guess by the phone #)

Please call here and don't email me.

Thanks,
