(snip)
&gt; Larry,
&gt; Speaking of your trip, how was the trip back from Tom's place?  Must be
&gt; nice to have a wasserboxer and get great mileage like that. :)  Us
&gt; air-cooled Vanagoners only get 18 if we have a tailwind.
&gt; 
&gt; I've often wondered myself why the wind is always head on.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, thanks for having Christy and me over for coffee at Tom's.  I think I
&gt; forgot to thank you two earlier.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't pay the extra for that 92 or 94 octane unless the manual
&gt; recommends it.  I know the manual for my '81 recommends 91 RON octane, but
&gt; in the USA they don't measure octane using the RON method anymore.  I
&gt; forget what the method we use is called, but it involves averaging the RON
&gt; number with another number, so that 91 RON is equivalent to the 87 octane
&gt; that is found at pumps in the US and is cheap!
&gt; 
&gt; Take care,
&gt; Sean

Hi Sean and Christy, after leaving Tom's we followed the mountains all
the way down to Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and finally had Christmas at
a lovely West Virginia State Resort (Pipe Stem State Park) in West
Virginia. Had beautiful walks through the bush, saw dozens (at least 50)
deer and had a delicious traditional Christmas dinner. We intend to
return in the future.

About octane:
I agree that the VW spec of 91 RON is equivalent to 87 octane available
at a US or Canadian pump. But, the syncro 2.1L engine runs VERY MUCH
BETTER on 92 to 94 octane. 

I consider the engine as the weak link in the syncro design so anything
which makes this engine run smoother it gets. It costs more for the
gasoline on a miles/gal basis but probable pays for itself in engine
life (quality or longevity). I think of it in the same terms a using
synthetic over conventional oils.

I hope your exams results were favourabe,
Larry and Avery Johnson
'86 syncro westy
