Subject: Saw a Vanagon Transporter(?)

I'm a newbie 'Wannabus'.  I'm currently driving a Jetta that's gotta
failing head gasket and 220,000 miles on it and am looking for a new
vehicle.  I was on I-5 in Seattle the other day and saw something that
made me start thinking about Vanagons.  I was wondering if anybody
had heard/seen/driven this particular type of vehicle.  Let me describe
this because it is certainly pretty rare:  I believe it said TRANSPORTER
in black letters on the back.
        ______________________   &lt;--- Extended roof

     \#                       |  &lt;--- Small pickup-like box
      \__/~~~\_________/~~~\__/
         \___/         \___/

It seemed like most of the fuselage was devoted to passenger/stuff
space, but there was an outdoor carrying compartment like a tiny 
pickup might have.  It looked very Germano-Safariish with desert
tan paint and the rear quarter areas had corrugated metal that 
seemed to say: &quot;take me to Afrika.&quot;
Anybody know the story or where I can get one of these?

Thanks,
Marlin Mixon
