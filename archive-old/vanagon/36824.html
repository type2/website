&gt; Volks,

&gt;         I adjusted my valves last week and changed the oil/filter (replaced
&gt; with a FRAM - smaller outside diameter, but same seal).  Started OK next
&gt; morning (cold - 35 degrees F), but neede a jump that night from work.  While
&gt; idling, a co-worker mentioned  my oil leak  - and it was running out of the
&gt; oil cooler area.  Looked like water in oil, but careful examination the
&gt; &quot;whitish&quot; look was tiny bubbles.
&gt;         What the heck has happened?
&gt;          Did I blow the oil cooler seals?

	Chris,
	Before you do anything drastic check the oil pressure sensor on 
the left side of the engine (from the back) in front of the distributor. 
I had a dripping, leaking oil leak only when the engine was running. 
&gt;From underneath it looked like it was dripping from around the oil 
filter. But it was actually bubbling out of the top of the oil pressure 
sensor. All I did was replace the sensor ($6.00) and reattach the wire 
to it and it was solved. I don't know if that is your problem, but check 
out the simple (and less expensive) solutions first..
Good luck,
Nathan
