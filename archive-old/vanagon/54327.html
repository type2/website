Boy I hope we're not sliding down a slippery slope here.  You guys
remember what happened the last time we discussed seats, cleaning and
&quot;gas&quot;?

&gt;&gt;You dog!  Heated seats?  Is there anyway on earth the rest of us mere
&gt;&gt;mortals could aquire such a luxury
&gt;
&gt;on the usual VW budget I'd suggest beans and a Bic lighter. Why mess about
&gt;with plain old electricity when modern natural gas can meet all your needs!

&gt;
&gt;sreiously, you can buy them to plug into a lighter socket.
