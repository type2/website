Hoo boy!  *500* GALLONS per minute!!  The potabe water tank is, what, 6 
gallons or so?  That sucker'd drain the tank in... 1.2 seconds!!

'Course, you could hook it up to a water-pistol kinda thing and bore 
holes right through people with it...

Seriously, I have a 1.5 gpm electric pump I installed in my westy after 
the DPO had left the water to freeze with a full tank (cracked the pump), 
and 1.5 gpm is uncomfortably high output.  I'd love to find an elagant 
little rheostat so I could control the speed of the pump and keep 
splashing down.  Even with 1.5 gpm, the usual way of using the sink is to 
do a space invaders type trigger button finger twitch: onoff, onoff.

IMHO, even 150 gpm has great potential for physical humour, but not much 
else.
