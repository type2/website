Subject: diesel heater/cooling problems (again)

Greetings, I'posting to the type 2 list as well as the vanagon one in 
order to tap the minds of ALL the mechanical geniuses out there.  Sorrry 
for wasting any bandwith on non-aircooled problems.
Last week I had a problem in which my van was overheating while the 
interior heater was not working. I assumed I had an ice blockage due to a 
weak antifreeze/water blend. The van was defrosted in the garage and was 
running alright afterwards.
The past few days the van warms up with the temp gauge reading 1/4 - 1/2, 
however the heater blows only cold air.  After driving about 5-10 min it 
starts getting warmer, only to cool down shortly. 
I never had a problem with the heater previously, in fact, after only a 
few minutes of warming up, it usually blows nice and hot. anybody know 
what the problem could be?

TIA
Regards
