&gt; &gt;       In a matter of time your Vanagon will quit dead! Platinum plugs
&gt; &gt;       cause, (only in the Vanagon) the coil to over heat and finally
&gt; &gt;       quit!

&gt; Interesting! Has anyone else had this problem? Our 85 has had them for
&gt; about 6 months.

&gt; 85GLI put platinum plugs on my 85 Vanagon GL about a year ago.  I have not 
had any problem I could relate to plugs or plug wires.
