Chris Chubb laments after his failed safety inspection:
.....The second is that the turn signal unit is not tightly connected to
the steering shaft any more.....The screws that clamp it are stripped....
My high beam unit is not working either......

Chris:

The same thing (turn signal clamp dies) happened in my old 70 and in my
current '71.  The screw hole is some kind of cheap pot-metal that turns
into little aluminum-like shavings at the least little torque.  As you may
have figured out, the loose clamp doesn't hold the high beam switch well
enough and pulling on the turn signal lever is useless.  I ignored this
problem on the 70 when I lived in Oregon because I was strapped for cash
and because high beams and turn signals are less important than a rebuilt
head or whatever else I needed.  However, the failure to secure the unit
lead to wires disengaging from the solder points on the turn signal switch
thus rendering even that useless after a while.  The only solution was to
pull another switch and associated wiring harness from a junker and
replace it.  Very easy since it is just a matter placing the same color
wires into the connector (no more than an hour of work).  When my 71 began
to exhibit the same sort of behavior, I nipped that in the bud with a
liberal lashing of black duct tape (the missing bonding force in the
universe after gravity and elctro-magnetics).  The turn signal switch
stays put and I am a happy camper.

What kind of Neo-Nazi, Authoritarian, Imperialist, Facist, RightWing
Lunatic, Oppressor of the Proud Working Class, Orwellian Control Freak
Bureaucratic Auto-Safety Inspector would even check the turn signal clamp?
What kind of sick, misguided society have we become?

Adios,

Nick
