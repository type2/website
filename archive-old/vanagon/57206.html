Subject: Sliding Door Handle Installation

OK, I've got the replacement sliding door handle thanks to Sorin Bejenaru.
It looks great and I'm ready to put it in. Question: The picture on page 269
of my Haynes (for air-cooled Vanagon) shows three parts which slip over the
part of the handle inserting into the door -- I have the part called the
Escucheon, but not the &quot;Seal&quot; or the &quot;Spacer.&quot; Any ideas as to where I might
find those parts -- like, are they something I could shop around my FLAPS
and find a &quot;make do&quot; replacement?

And here's my dumb question: Is there any reason I absolutely need to change
the lock on the new handle? I generally unlock that door by reaching inside
through the front door, so for my purposes, it's no big hurryup deal. But is
there a chance I could get the new handle installed and then discover it
won't work because it's locked (no key)?

Any thoughts on installing this outside sliding door handle will be appreciated.
