&gt; I don't speak from experience but hows about putting it on jack stands?

Geez, campsites must be really crowded where you live!  Why not just camp 
out of the way a little bit, if a little pseudo-exhibitionism doesn't do 
it for you?  And unless there are a lot of generators running in the site 
(don't get me started on *generators*, grrr...) wouldn't the motion of 
the bus be a secondary indication of there are some festivities going 
on--I mean, the pop-top is up, right?  Talk about thin walls!

Sounds kinda fun to me, though...  I'll bet the folks in the 40' RV next 
door wanted to bring their kids camping to learn about nature anyways, 
right?
