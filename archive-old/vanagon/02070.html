&gt; 
&gt; I only have a couple of suggestions.  First, the trip should hit as 
&gt; many brewpubs as possible.  Second, we should have at least several 
&gt; field trips to the great VW salvage yards of the nation.  Finally, if 
&gt; there is a movie I request that they get a good looking actor to play 
&gt; my part.  I will sign nothing until my lawyer first gets a look.
&gt; -- 

Of course, we could spend a week in the Napa and Sonoma valleys alone!
Oooo... 40 or so VW Type II's weaving all over the road in a caravan.
What a sight!   I don't care who plays me in a movie, just send the 
royalties thanks! ;)
