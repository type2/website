Subject:      plastic vanagon models

ok. got the models today. :)

bad news, good news:

the firetruck is NOT a double-cab pickup. the &quot;cage&quot; he spoke of is just
a partition-thingie between the front and the rear cargo area (which, by
the way, those of you with kids might like to see!). :(

however, the kits are the same old 1982 kit ... so they are air-cooled
vanagons ... us water-pumpers have a decal to put on the front that
&quot;simulates&quot; the bottom grill!

the UN bus is molded in white plastic, and the firetruck is model in, of
course, fire-engine red.

now, the curious part:
both buses are exactly the same kit. the firetruck has some extra parts for
the fire equipment, but the body, frame, etc. are all the same.

so why is one kit listed as &quot;1/24-scale, 18.4 cm long&quot; and the other one is
&quot;1/25-scale, 18.2 cm long&quot;?? :) curioser and curioser.

now, all i have to do is turn one of them into a single-cab pickup!!! :)
&lt;cause i already turned one of Magnum PI's buses into a double-cab pickup&gt;.
