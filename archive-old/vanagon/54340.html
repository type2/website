Subject: Re: 88 Vanagon with &quot;thing&quot; on steering column??

&gt;this is not anything like a thumwheel.  It looks like a little electronic
&gt;display of some sort.
&gt;
&gt;Any other theories????

It's a head up display, HUD, for the built-in navigation system that VW is
secretly trying out.  You simply look straight through it to see exactly
where you are going.  Quite ingenius. After that I'm fresh out of ideas.
