Subject: Looking for a synchro
Date: Sun, 26 May 96 5:30:12 EDT

What a list.  I'm new to this subculture, but I'm looking for a Synchro in
a model year that has a locking rear differential.  

I would love to have a Westy Synchro, but I don't think I can come up with
the $ just now.  I understand that one can later convert to a camper.  Any
truth in this? 

Cheers,

Ed
