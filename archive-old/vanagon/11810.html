&gt;Chevron Pro-Gard Fuel Injector Cleaner PLUS
&gt;Is this the good stuff?  Regular price is $7.99, sale price is $4.99, and
&gt;there is even a one buck rebate going on.
&gt;Also, they are offering something called Chevron Pro-Gard Clean-Up Engine
&gt;Deposit Remover.  Same price as the FI Cleaner.
&gt;Both bottles say &quot;with Techron&quot;.

?? that doesn't SOUND like the same exact stuff (to me), but the prices are
about right. the Techron stuff i'm talking about is labeled &quot;Techron&quot; and
is in about a 1 pint (?) black plastic bottle with a long neck.

&gt;Is there a sensible use for the Deposit Remover on a VW air-cooled engine?
&gt;Any cautions?

as i understand it, only the water-cooled engines needed it for the fuel
injection ... cause the deposits 'grew' in the intake manifold, right behind
the intake valves. the air-cooled engines supposedly were hot enough to NOT
form the deposits.

anybody else heard this?  i don't know what harm it could do to an air-cool.

&gt;Does this stuff have a good shelf-life, so that it should be stockpiled
&gt;at the $3.99 net price?

i'm a little skeptical. what with fuel injection being THE primary fuel system
used on automobiles, i'd bet on the stuff getting more and more available and
more and more companies competing (i.e., price gets cheaper).

on the other hand, it wouldn't hurt to have a couple of bottles round the
garage. ;)  but don't forget to stock up on oil and filters as well.
