Sami: First on the connector issue. If it is like the VDO I have the
sender will be no more than a 13mm washer like device designed for a plug to
be slipped through so a natural spot is no/3 head. This in turn is
connected to two (high heat I
guess) wires which have a special nylon one way connector - do not
reverse the connection as it will damage the sender (receiver?) in the
gauge. There should be  two connectors for your light hook up as well...

AS I understand it the sensor itself is a conductor and requires no
electricity to run (so the only possible drain would be I
guess the lights to the dash). 

DC

PS I posted a note on installing this a while back; it should be in the
gopher files.
