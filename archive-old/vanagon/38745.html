Subject: What would Rumba Fetch? -or- How much should i sell for?

hey now,

i have a '74 transporter that i may sell in the near future. the Westfalia
bug has bitten me and i'm considering a 90's one...oh lord, a water cooled
engine! oh my..what's wrong with me?

anyway, what should i sell it for? let me go into detail:

'74 transporter turned RetroWestie
188,000 miles
**good strong engine...real good engine!!
**will be giving it a spring tune up..oil, valves, etc etc
**putting new upper and lower ball joints and tie rods on
**nice, solid body...couple of rust spots...on roof where fpo backed into
a garage that was too short, i'll be fixing these. floor is 100% solid. couple
 of other small places, minor. some bubbling rust on rear.
**new front windshield seal
**new bosch windshield wipers
**new bosch spark plugs
**new one way vaccum valve (to be installed)
**new vacuum hose
**new fuel filter
**new air filter
*most of the westy interior has been installed...including fold down bed,jump
jump seat, passenger side closet thing, will have ice box and sink in
soon.
**have mount for tire on front
**doesn't eat oil.
**have hammock for front seat
**of course it comes with the Idiot's Guide
**have fold out windows for main side pannels...haven't installed yet
**snap on mosquito netting for rear door
**heavy duty curtains included

so...what would you sell this van for...i'm not 100% sure i'm gonna sell,
just thinking about it atm.
