Subject: gopher

ok all you fridayers.
I suspect with the way things are going that the reliablility of the 
search will be in question for a while, but I've got it working now.
I've reorganized just a little to get it working.  The 

Miscellaneous
    Vanagon

gopher path now contains
      FAQ.1
      Files
      List Archives/

Under List Archives there's
          Search Vanagon List &lt;?&gt;
          vanagon.94.04/
          vanagon.94.05/
          vanagon.94.06/

For those of you asking questions like &quot;what's gopher, and how do I use 
it&quot; the first answer is to contact your local system administrator 
because the clients and setups are so different.

The second answer is that you can contact me via private email and I'll 
give you any assistance I can.  Tell me what kind of computer you are 
connecting to, what kind of computer you're sitting at, and how you read 
e-mail.

I won't be doing it this weenend, though, because my modem got fried in the
last thunderstorm.

Have fun.
