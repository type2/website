OK, I know this borders on heresy, and prolly be flamebait, but I need
advice so am turning to the best source of mechanical wisdom.  I'm
considering a 93 Aerostar (can't bring myself to say F**d) to pull my boat.
This puppy has All Wheel Drive, and that's scary since I know it's not
German quality.  Will be in the same stable with Felix, my 81 Westie, so
there is a danger that they won't get along and one will have to eventually
go.  I'd like to avoid making a big mistake, so any negatives you have
heard and can pass along about 4 wheel drive on this beast would be
appreciated.  Why the Aerostar?  My brother in law works at the dealer.
Thanks in advance for any advice.

Bob Park
soon with 4 vehicles for 2 people. Trouble at home!
