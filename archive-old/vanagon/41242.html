Subject: RE: REMINDER - Rites of Spring


&gt;LiMBO's Rites of Spring is this Sunday at Duxbury Beach, Duxbury MA (just
&gt;north of Plymouth)....
&gt;
&gt;I'll be bring Transporter Ale ... albeit without labels....my supplier
&gt;never came thru....                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


I'd say that a list sticker, appropriately positioned on each bottle,
would be all the label anyone would ever want.

They're even shaped right!   :^)

(pssst... hey, Rich, how about a commission?)    :^)

  - just kidding! -
