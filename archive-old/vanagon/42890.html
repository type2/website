&gt;&gt;How about attaching them to something secured by the wheels.  I'm picturing a
&gt;&gt;couple of pieces of wood or something that you drive the van onto, that
&gt;&gt;extends out away from the passenger side of the van.  Then attach the pole to
&gt;&gt;the wood.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Interesting thought. I was thinking of attaching (bolting) some sort of
&gt;tab under the bus that stuck out flush with the body....
&gt;
&gt;how about putting some sort of reinforced bend into the poles and inserting
&gt;them in the jack points?
&gt;

 Ian:
&gt;That would work great, however the arms of the awning are right at the very
ends of the awning and need to 
come down to the bus at that point. The jack points are just too close
together unless you had a short awning.

P.S. I guess you could lengthen the bus Hmmmmmmm.
