Subject: CHT Gauge for type IV motor

Hi everyone,

I wish to call on the experience of those of you who have 
fitted a VDO cylinder head temperature gauge onto a type IV 
motor.  I have recently bought one of these gadgets for my 
'74 1800 camper and have come into some problems with the 
installation.

According to the instructions the sensor is primarily designed 
to take the place of the compression washer under one of the 
spark plugs. The spark plug holes in my 1800 heads are 
recessed making it appear impossible to fit the sensor there.  
The instructions go on to say that if this is the case then 
attach the sender to another bolt on the head such as a head 
stud.  I don't like the idea of tampering with the head stud 
set up and there's nothing else obvious to bolt to.  Do I need
to drill and tap a hole?

Any advice would be appreciated.
