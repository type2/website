Hey All,
I have been having a great time getting aquainted w/my new westy and 
getting ready for my first trip out (short and close).  Everything seems 
to work!  The only thing is the missing front curtains.  The PO said they 
were in there when he traded it in, and the dealer says they were never 
there (hmm).  I could make some out of unmatched material, but would 
first like to know if there is a way to get replacements.
Also missing are the plastic protective covers for the water and electric 
hook-ups.  Can these be replaced?
Where can I find an awning and screens?
Thanks
Lee and Gretchen
