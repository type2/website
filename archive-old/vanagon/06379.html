Subject: Could this be The One[tm]?

	Well, the morning paper reveals a 63 Crewcab, rebuilt engine,
new paint and interior. $4900. I talked to one of the owners last
night. They did a bare-metal restoration on it, overhauled
everything execpt the transmission, welded-in a new pillar
between the front windows and repaired all other rust damage,
and they've been showing it at the local bay area gatherings. 
(Its grey, with a roof-rack. Anyone seen it?)
	But now they want to sell it because it has to sit outside, 
and should be garaged, and they're remodelling the house and need the money.
	I'm seeing it tomorrow.
	Other than the tranny, this sounds like a basicly
remanufactured 1963 double cab!! (It's 12V).
	How does $4900 sound for bare-metal-up, new rubber,
etc etc etc?

	Having not seen it, my biggest reservation is that
I wouldn't want to damage the paint *using* it- I guess I'd
need a bed-liner too. Does anyone know of bed-liners for
split-window crew cabs? I guess my alternative is to make my own
liner out of marine plywood and epoxy paint...

	Yes, I'm excited! Yes, I'll try it in all 4 speeds forward
and reverse. Yes, I'll ask to see the recipts, expect to see a
few K miles on the rebuild, look at the floors under the mats, etc.
	My friend Rob recomends I ask about undercoating. Any other
suggestions? I plan to bring the Muir book with me and do the 
&quot;how to buy&quot; procedure.

	Bill
