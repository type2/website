Subject: inuvik trip.

    Hi Coyote and other Beaufort Sea travelers,
 just went over our itinerary and map for next year's trip. it looks like
you want to go up the robert campbell hwy from watson lake to dawson city.
i'm not sure that bypassing whitehorse on the way up is such a good idea.
the robert campbell isn't all that scenic. also,people may be craving for a
big city by then, with showers (hi martha !), saloons, etc...plus,
whitehorse is the only supply center between edmonton and anchorage for
parts, and it's a great place to stock up on cheap groceries and anything
people may want before heading up into the dempster hwy's no mans land.
whitehorse has museums, the sternwheeler &quot;klondike&quot;, bookstores etc to put
people in the &quot;klondike gold rush frame of mind&quot;...
 my $can 0.02 worth...
