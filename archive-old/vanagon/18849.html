&gt; Ingredients:

&gt; 1 or 2 quarts of red wine
&gt; 1/2 cup of butter (or whatever fat is currently not politically incorrect)
&gt; reefer leftovers:  onions, green onions, leeks, carrots, cabbage, sauerkraut,  
&gt;  celery, potatoes, tomatoes, etc. 
&gt; 1 pound vanagon-quality beef/cat/coon/etc.
&gt; 1/2 cup brown sugar
&gt; 1/4-1/2 cup vinegar
&gt; liquid of your choice, plus stock/boullion, etc.
&gt; salt and pepper to taste


BEETS, WHERE ARE THE BEETS, call me crazy but due to my 1/2
Ukrainian/Russian heritage, grandma always made borscht primarily
from beets and stock, in fact I though by definition it was beet
soup.  Of course maybe she did it that way because that was
all they had when she left during the Revolution, who knows?
