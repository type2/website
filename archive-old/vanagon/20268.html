Subject: VAN sales


I have driven a FORD lately, and with the deepest of my sorrow, I am selling
my VANS. VW has left a very nasty taste in my mouth!

Here it is
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1983 VW VANAGON CAMPER (green)
-Water cooled, Fuel Injection
-130K
-Everything works, ran great up to 130K
-Needs:
	 transmission/transaxle work
         a muffler
         a rear-bumber (it is dinted) (wife's rear-bumber syndrome)

I'd like around $2800.00, make an offer and come get it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1991 VW VANAGON CAMPER (blue)
-water cooled, FI
-66K
-Everything works, looks like new, runs like shit.
-Needs:
	A good mechanic! (Not the idiots at the dealer)
        Rear-bumber work (cracked) (YES again, wife's rear-bumber syndrome)   

I'd like around $12,000.00, make an offer and come get it!
