&gt;Well, I've put 140K on my 86 Jetta over the last 10 years and have been
&gt;contemplating the Westfalia move.  Joined the list to learn and - after
&gt;reading, searching, and talking to current owners - have decided to join the
&gt;ranks of the converted.  But NOT yet having the best of luck finding one
&gt;(yesterday was particularly disappointing as I thought I had one but it got
&gt;away). Sooo... if anyone is looking to sell a late '80s Westfalia that's in
&gt;pretty good shape (a/c would be nice, I'm flexible on options), or knows
&gt;someone else who is, or has any suggestions about finding one in Southern
&gt;California -- I'd very much welcome the info.  I live in Santa Monica.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!!

&gt;Beth, 
the asking price is $5000 for the 85 Westy weekender.
