Aha,  I just finally found my road atlas and now I wonder if anyone can 
recommend the following State Parks:

Watkins Mill State Park, Missouri, (near Kansas City)
Wallace State Park, Missouri, (Near Cameron)
Crowder State Park, Missouri, ( Near Trenton)

Nine Eagles State Park, Iowa, (Near Iowa / MO border, off I35)
Lake Ahquabi State Park, Iowa, (Near Indianola, South of Des Moines)

If any references can be given to these places, I would appreciate 
it.
