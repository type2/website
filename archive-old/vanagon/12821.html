one of the neatest things i ever saw anyone do to an air-cooled engine was
a fellow who had a couple of braided-steel lines running from his oil pump
to each valve cover. he had put a small spray nozzle inside the top of each
valve cover, and the pump (i'm pretty sure it was a heavy duty one that put
out extra pressure) forced oil through those lines, and sprayed it over the
rockers inside the valve covers. it really seemed to reduce his engine temp.
but it was a LOT of complication, and (to me) might be prone to clogging.

but oil gets hotter in the summer time, and the friction isn't any worse, is
it? the oil gets hot, and unless it's cooled by something, it'll stay hot.
i'm pretty sure that was one of the reasons for the porsche 911 having such
a large oil tank: to oil-cool the engine (since a 6-cylinder is supposedly
too much for air-cooling).

&gt; also true that the watercooled Vanagon engines &lt;both gas and diesel&gt; still
&gt; have oil coolers?

yup. funny thing is, the oil is cooled by running the anti-freeze/coolant
throught the cooler!!! i always thought the coolant was hotter than the
oil, but apparently not so.

when i had my 80 bus, i added an external oil cooler (sandwich plate between
the oil filter and engine, hoses off to a small radiator in the left rear
fender), and the extra radiation/air-flow and extra oil really really helped
the oil temp, especially in the summer. for the winter, i had installed a
thermostat by-pass ... which simply recirculated the oil (back to the engine)
until the oil temp was up enough to need the cooler.

i got the idea from a fellow who had rigged up something similar on his old
65 bus, but he had brass valves which he used to recirculate the oil. in
summer, he opened the flow to the cooler. in winter, he shut it off.
