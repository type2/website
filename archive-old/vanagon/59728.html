Hello Drew,

Going through same with my 100,000mi. '86 Syncro GL.  Here are my
considerations:

1.  Per mile cost has been very low.
2.  I can fix most things.
3.  In spite of some very nasty winters and rugged terrain here in
Colorado, it will still run when others won't get out of the driveway.
4.  I, personally, love the handling characteristics.
5.  I am the original owner.
6.  Its unique abilities have created a real niche in my overall
transportation needs and I'm not very sure I can replace it with a
single vehicle.
7.  ITS PAID FOR!

Just a few thoughts.

&gt; It is decision time on my 86 Syncro so I thought I'd solicit some
&gt; opinions from the cogniscenti.
&gt; 
&gt; Relevant facts: 134000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Very well maintained but it now needs some work:
&gt; 1. Left front inner CV joint boot. (easy)
&gt; 2. 2 rear wheel brake cylinders (easy)
&gt; 3. Left cylinder head leaking. Uses about an expansion tanks amount of
&gt; coolant a week. (fix-able by shade tree mech?)
&gt; 4. I suspect the exhaust headers may only have a 6 month
&gt; life. (Muffler and cat were replaced 2 years ago).
&gt; 5. New rear bumper (very easy)
&gt; 
&gt; The heads have 50k miles on them.
&gt; 
&gt; In general, the vehicle is in very good shape. The A/C was completely
&gt; refurbished last fall, tires (reinforced Michellins) are 1 year old,
&gt; no perceived problems with the transmission or syncro assembly. Four
&gt; shocks and front rotors are 2 years old, new fuel injectors 2 years ago,
&gt; and battery is 1 year old. Whenever something needed to be done, I had
&gt; it repaired by a very competent mechanic.
&gt; 
&gt; (Ric Golen and Moe Walters from the list have seen this syncro.)
&gt; 
&gt; There is some rust starting on the front bumper seam and a couple of
&gt; body seams. Also 2 small surface rust spots on the drivers door.
&gt; 
&gt; My wife wants to throw in the towel and sell it. I haven't decided
&gt; whether selling it now is right.
&gt; 
&gt; We use it as our third vehicle. We have 2 small children and we use
&gt; the syncro as our &quot;beach&quot; car for beach trips and windsurfing.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm most concerned about the heads and the exhaust headers.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone would like to pass on their opinion of what they might do in
&gt; my situation, I'm listening.
