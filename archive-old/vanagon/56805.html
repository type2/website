Subject: FW: Milwaukee Auto Show--VWoA has no plans for Eurovan

You said,

&gt;Just to add a slightly different answer, at the Chicago show, the rep
&gt;told me VW would bring in the V6 Euro as a 98 model.  I guess I didn't
&gt;really believe him, but there you have it.
&gt;

I have heard this for every year since 1993.  They all say it will always
be next year.  VW has thrown the the towel in on the US van market.
