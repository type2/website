Subject: Cold Start question
Date: Thu, 29 Dec 94 14:18:20 EST

This morning when I went to start up the Westy, the starter did its usual
rrr rrr rrr (it is minus 15 degrees Celsius outside). Now my question is this:
someone mentioned that unless the Main Computer receives a minimum
voltage the engine will not fire; does this include a signal to the
starter as well?. In other words if the voltage of the battery is below
the acceptable threshold will the starter turn (assuming it has enough
cranking amps to do so) even though the engine will not fire? TIA - DC --
