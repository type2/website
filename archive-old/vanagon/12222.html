I'm lucky at my high school, we have a great auto shop teacher who builds
miniture cars for a hobby...this man can fabricate you just about anything...


One of my diesel Vanagon's broke a water expansion bottle, rather than to 
order a new one, at mega bucks, I had thd shop teacher make me a new one out 
of copper and brass....

changes colours with the heat but works....
