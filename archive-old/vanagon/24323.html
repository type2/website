Subject: WTB '87 or Newer Westfalia

Hello all!  After going on a weekend trip with me to BBTA, my mother decied
she wanted a Westfalia too.  She likes all the storage and such of mine but
I think she would be happer with a newer Vanagon; mainly because she doesn't
drive a stick and would like power steering.   
Sooooo, I'm looking for a '87 or newer Vanagon Westfalia (full camper not
weekender).  She would like with fairly low miles and under $10,000.  She
would be trading selling her only car so in needs to be very reliable.  So
if any such deals are out there (oh ya, it NEEDS to be an automatic) please
let me know.  I'd love to get my mom (and Dad too) into the VW scene and
they love to go camping so I thought this would be perfect for them.  Thanks
in advance for any leads!!
