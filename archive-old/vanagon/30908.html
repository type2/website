Subject: sunroof like i Jurassic Park, The Mermen

	When I was a boy, Oldsmobile's had such windows for
the middle seat passengers in their station wagons. They called 'em
Vista Crusers.....  I'm wondering if one could form a plexiglass window
to the same lovely curves as the original top- say by drape, plunge or
vaccuum forming, and then cut-out metal as felt safe, and insert the
plasitic. 

	Actually, using standard  H section window rubber, you could
make a frame that had the same dimensions as the front part of the 68-71
westie luggage rack, and glaze the whole thing with flat plexiglass or
polycarbonate. (Polycarbonate isn't as flamable and is physically tougher).
Just (ha!) weld together the frame from square section tubing, then put 
fillets at the corners if you want and attach a rail for the rubber to 
grip. For water-tightness, you'd want to continiously weld the rail,
like this:
			 _
square section tube --&gt; [_]
			 |  &lt;--- rail
			 H  &lt;--- generic window rubber
			 :
		         : &lt;--- plastic window

	Maybe tack welds and then braised filler for waterproofing? 
I'm not competent here....

	Ever since I saw a BMW station wagon I've had a sick urge to
turn one into a Vistacrusier, with metalic blue paint and wood-grain
side pannels. Except, since its a BMW, the wood-grain would be real
birds-eye maple vernier laminated with a couple of plies of alder
or regular maple, teak framing and the whole buiness attached with
brass fittings... :)


	It IS Friday!


	Bay Area folks-
	Tomorrow, The Mermen play at Foothill College, with Brazil 2001
and another surf band. Show starts at 7:00, expect the Mermen at
9:00 or so, tickets are $10 at the door, parking requires 4 quarters,
even on weekends :(. Bassist Allen Whitman says they will be playing
new stuff from their upcoming big label (Blue Moon/Mesa) EP and
Christmas songs :). If you don't attend in person, try 89.7fm between
7 and ??? Saturday night, as the show will be broadcast.

	Bill
