for those of you in the U.S., getting hypos may be a problem ... the druggists
do NOT want to just give out or even sell syringes without some sort of
prescription from a doctor. :( drugs and all that. however ... if you explain
to them that you need a BIG diameter needle (and you DO need one of some
size ... for the oil to flow freely), you might get him to do it. i've found
that cutting the very extremely sharp tips off the needles (using a cutting
file) helps protect yourself from pokes and cuts that can be pretty painful.

the other problem is that (from my experience) the oil seems to gum up or
maybe dissolve partially the plastic that the syringes are made of. so if you
leave the syringe in your toolbox, full of oil, it kinda makes a big mess. :(

and the old glass syringes broke on me. :(

i thought about those big metal syringes that the animal doctors use, but
then, i might as well just use a greasegun! ;)
