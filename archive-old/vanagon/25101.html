     I agree - the price is outrageous, and don't waste anymore
     money at the local VW haus until you have a firm, realistic
     price agreement, then use any bad news from the VW haus for
     further reductions.

     During my search for the holy grail, I found a 87 Syncro Westie
     for $8K, didn't go for it 'cause it needed attention and I dont
     have the time, but there is better out there, for less!

&gt; Although it looks great, as soon as I climbed underneath I was nearly hit in
&gt; the face by a big fat drop of coolant dripping from the rear skid plate, and
&gt; the reservoir was below MIN.  I felt some uneveness in the acceleration and
&gt; they claimed that although they've experienced the infamous intermittent FI
&gt; cutout problem, it hasn't shown up for along time.  The idle is terribly
&gt; uneven but they also claim it's been that way from day one, that the dealer
&gt; tried and failed to cure it, and that it hasn't led to anything worse.

DANGER!  DANGER!  DANGER!

Sounds like expensive problems waiting to happen!  An 87 synchro
non-camper with problems like that wouldn't be worth more than about 3K
to *me*.  I think 10K is outrageous!

&gt; My guys here at the Volks Cafe are going to give it the fine-tooth-comb
&gt; treatment, but I thought I'd solicit input from the greater community of
&gt; experts in the group.  Does this sound like a reasonable deal?  The owners
&gt; said they specifically chose high Blue Book because of the low mileage/hi
&gt; cosmetics, but the price still seemed high to me, especially after looking in
&gt; other used-car price guides (Edmunds on-line and N.A.D.A Mt. States edition).
&gt;  And unquestionably, the price is out-of-whack if I'm looking at a head gasket
&gt; replacement,  not to mention the heinous, dreaded &quot;ghost harness&quot; (ooh - gives
&gt; me shivvers just thinking about it).  I'm also wondering if there should be a
&gt; price hit for the lack of A/C and pullout bed?

Yes to all of the above.

&gt; So, am I blowing it if I pay over $10K for a car like this?  All my rational
&gt; senses are screaming &quot;Toyota LE&quot;, but some more primal urge (is it
&gt; testosterone-based?) is whispering &quot;a VW van with 4WD? TOO COOL, dude&quot;.
&gt; Whaddaya think?

I think you should look at a few more synchros!
