Subject: Re: Factory Alloy Wheels


Well today I had my alloy wheels put on using the studs that were on the
car.  The factory alloy lug nuts _at_ $1/ea from junk yard.  And Saab 9000
alloy lug nuts also _at_ $1/ea from saab mechanic.  I will let everyone know
if my wheels fall off:)

&gt; I have been following the Alloy discussion closely because I too have
&gt; purchased a set of factory alloys to use on my 89 Westy. But, because
&gt; I found them at a local savage yard the lug nuts and bolts had already
&gt; been lost. At an initial investment of $300.00 for the wheels I was thinking
&gt; new dealer prices could not be that bad, right? Well for those of you who
&gt; would like to do the math - what is $8.50 * 5 * 4 ? Answer - big bucks for
&gt; lug bolts (Nuts!). And now I am hearing the studs may need replaced by
&gt; longer Studs? Does anyone know of an after-market source (or any cheaper
&gt; source of factory parts)? And will the lugs from the steel wheels fit (or not)
&gt; temporarily while I purchase one wheel a month for four months?
&gt;  I think there may be more people in this situation than myself - Can anyone
&gt; help nail this one down.
