Subject: Re: $25,000 in Syncro Camper Repairs


	Someone brought up the question of what kinds of problems 
&quot;older&quot; VW vans had when they were new- a good question.

	Our family had a '68 Bus bought new at Spartan Volkswagen in 
San Jose, CA. At a relatively low mileage, according to my father's 
recollection, the cylinder head studs started pulling out of the case- 
this involved major (read, $$$) teardown to repair. As I remember the 
story, the Bus was *just* past the warranty period, so the dealer 
wanted to charge full price for the repair. The dealer finally made 
some kind of deal on the repair, but it took some real arm-twisting by 
my 'ol man.

	Anyway, the &quot;good ol' days&quot; weren't *always* the paradise that 
they are sometimes remembered as.
