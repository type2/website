Subject: need advice!

Greetings all! I have been reading the list a few weeks now- wow!- and I
need a bit of advice. I have an 83 GTI with 203,000 which still purrs,
but needs cosmetic work, and since May I've had trouble shifting into 
second gear. Still, it's a great little car- well maintained. We now,
however, have outgrown the little car and are now looking for a Vanagon.
As kids, our parents always had a VW Bus of some kind, and I remember that
the aircooled ones leaked big oil- I was told to purchase something after
1985? but mot anything new (gasp) I've never bought a new vehicle- ever!
Anyhow I need advice on good years for the 7 passenger vanagons, and if
there exist any deals out there that will take a really great GTI as
partial payment? If I can't release the little red devil to a worthy lover
of vw's who will take care of it- I'll keep it and eventually restore it.
My father has been working on a 64 bug since I can remember...I'd rather
cover it and restore it later than trade it in to a junk-yard. Anyhow,
anybody out there who has any leads on vans in the central Florida area?
Please reply directly to me- this list is so very busy! It has been great-
I've learned a lot and appreciate all the cool info! Cheers! Maria
