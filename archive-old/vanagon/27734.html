Subject: 96mm jugs for 1700?

A guy at the FLAPS has a set of pistons he says are for a 1700 - they are 
96mm but don't require any flycutting of the head.

What cc would this engine be with the stock crank?  He says that the stock 
1700 is a 90mm piston.

Anyone ever use these?  The bottom end should be strong enough since the rod 
journals are reduced for the 2000 engine.  Are these a good thing?

TIA,
Dean Aukes
