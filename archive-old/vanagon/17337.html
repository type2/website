&gt; What is &quot;VW motoring&quot; and how can I get it?

 VW motoring covers all aspects of the VW/Audi scene, and so covers
 alot of water cooled stuff (golfs, sciroccos etc), some air cooled
 (beetles) and very occasionally type IIs. 

 I bought it this month because it had `Porsche-powered Type 2' 
 emblazoned across the front, but normally it dosn't offer nearly
 as much in the way of interest (for type 2 owners and airheads) 
 as say Volksworld.

 World airmail subscription rates are given as 43 pounds sterling
 and a phone number for subscriptions is 01778 391153. (You would
 obviously need to do the international dialing thing to).

 Hope this helps
