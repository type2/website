Subject: Re: hey (Senator Welfare Bus)

If I were a constituent, as some of you are, I would pose as a
conservative and offer to drive the bus...and park it at my house...and
maintain it...and store it until the next campaign...and just to make
things easier, I could get the title changed over and keep up the
registration. 

It might require a haircut, but hey...it'd be worth it for a nice bus.
