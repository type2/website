&gt;Yep, I know caps are yelling, I AM YELLING!
&gt;
&gt;It's about -5 F w/o the wind chill here in Cincinnati, OH. My '83.5 was
&gt;sitting out all night defenseless :-(  I came out of this morning about
&gt;6am, hoppped in pressed the clutch and shifted to nuetral, started right
&gt;up, got out and took the dog to do his daily, came back in about 5 minutes,
&gt;hopped back in and NO CLUTCH! Nothing, the pedal went straight to the floor
&gt;with no resistance at all! It felt OK prior to starting.
&gt;
&gt;What gives?


    Probabally the same thing that happened to my wife's Toyota on 
Monday.  Bitter cold finally pushed old seals on the clutch slave 
cylinder over the edge and all the fluid blew out the slave cylinder.
    I hope that you have a vaugely warm place to work on it ;)
