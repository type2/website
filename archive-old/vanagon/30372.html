Anyone out there currently using Splitfire Sparkplugs?

I am attempting to increase my fuel efficiency ('83 Westy _at_ 15 mpg 
city/hwy), and am considering switching to these along w/a little tinkering 
etc.  I have heard these plugs can really make a difference, any proof out 
there?

Thanks,
Bill Ernest
