&gt; At long last,
&gt;    I just got off the phone with Tom, of TomCat VW parts in Victoria, B.C.,
&gt; Canada.               This is where I found the new 1.9L TDI diesels complete
&gt; for $5000 Canadian. As I talked to him this last time, I learned that he's
&gt; not the one importing these motors. Also, these engines are complete with all
&gt; sensors, controls, catalitic converter, inj. pump, injectors, air cleaner,
&gt; everything. They are coming out of Poland (Germany?) and may be seconds from
&gt; VW. He doesn't know. When I talk to the guy who's doing the importing, I'll
&gt; post again. Should be within a week. I seem to remember a similar deal in the
&gt; early '80's, brand new 1.6L diesels, complete, in a box for $750 U. S.. I
&gt; didn't need one at the time, so I passed. Come to find out, years later, they
&gt; were straight from VW Germany. They were supposed to go to General Motors,
&gt; Canada, to go into Geos. As the story goes, there were 5400 over produced. I
&gt; always kicked myself for not buying one. That's life in the slow lane!

I'm eager to hear more about these TDIs!. I bought my used 1.6 TD 
engine from Tom two years ago. He was very good to deal with, and 
knows VWs very well. At that time, one of their yard vehicles was a 
Vanagon with a TD engine in it.
