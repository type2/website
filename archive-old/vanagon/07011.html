 Evan Estern asks:

&gt;What's a SO?

	That's *an* SO, and means Significant Other. Saves one the
folderoll of trying to guess which of wife, husband, lover, sweetie,
boy friend, girl friend, snuggle buns, sugar-foots, etc, might
be appropriate.

	'Course with the Republicans in charge of Congress now,
&quot;lovely and tallented wife&quot; will probably replace it, after the
National Barefoot And Pregnant Family Values bill is passed. Shoot,
I expect couples all over America are considering abandoning a life
of sin for the sanctity of marriage even now, in the hope that
The Creator will then bless their union with a child like Newt Gingrich,
Jesse Helms or Robert Dole.

	(I wonder if this is really decaf I'm drinking...)

	Cheers!
	Bill
