&gt;Ralf et al - I second this notion.  I'm in the middle of CA,
&gt;and if this plan is in fact decided up, I volunteer my
&gt;driveway as a starting point for this adventure!  And, yes
&gt;you can all park your cars here.  I suppose you can even
&gt;have free computer access  :)

Martha thinks that the Bay Area is the &quot;middle&quot; of CA.  If you press
her on it she will admit that she thinks that it's the &quot;middle&quot; of
the Western Hemisphere.  :-)

As for THE TRIP, I don't see how a decent, self-respecting VW caravan
could neglect to pass through Montana.
