Subject: Re: Bus needs a bra

I would like to get a bra for my splitty bus.  I would like to hear about
your experiences with bras' , for your bus that is.  Tell me about your likes
and dislikes regarding the different companies, styles, etc.  Who has the
best?  Who should I avoid?
--------

The bras i've seen from &quot;Your Mama's Bra Company&quot; look good.   They make many
stock  colours, and will custom make them if you want a differnt colour
combo.    I have the card somewhere, but not hamdy, they are in the Seattle
area.  

Disclaimer- i am not involved in you mama's bra co, but a friend is.
