&gt; Check out your local smoke/head shop.  You know the place near campus that

Thanks.  Unfortunately, head shops are extinct, or nearly so, here, due 
to the unrelenting efforts of those who would protect us from ourselves.  
But it's a lead, and I'll pursue it, even if it means wading through 
throngs of tie-dyed, long hairs and clouds of patchouli.  Hmmm, maybe 
just look at a bong while I'm there.....
