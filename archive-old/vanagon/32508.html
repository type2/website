Subject: Bosch Blue Coils

I recently fitted and am running a bosch blue coil because it was easy to 
get hold of when mine died. However I noticed that people think I should 
have a ballast resistor, which it doesn't have. What damage will I do, 
and where can I get a ballast resistor etc.

TIA

Dave.
