Subject:      ha! found it! permanent coolant...

ok, i think i may have found the passage from VW about the coolant in
the wasserboxer being &quot;permanent&quot; and never needing changing.

in the 1990 AND 1991 Vanagon Owner's Manuals, page 104, it says:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
VEHICLE CARE
Cooling System
The cooling system is sealed and generally requires little attention.

The cooling system has been filled at the factory with a permanent coolant
which does not need to be changed. The coolant consists of a mixture of water
and the manufacturer's coolant additive G11 - antifreeze on glycol basis
with anticorrosion additives (40% for USA models; 50% for Canadian models).
This mixture assures the necesary frost protection and protects the entire
cooling system against corrosion and scaling, and raises the boiling point
of the coolant.
...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

now, to me, if i had a 90 or 91, and i started having overheating problems
or head gaskets leaks, i think i'd be quite a bit upset at this.

because the other years that i checked (Owner's Manuals) did NOT say this.
only the 90 and 91 manuals. the 83 and 85 and 88 and 89 did NOT say anything
about &quot;permanent&quot; coolant ... they never said you SHOULD change it, but they
talk about &quot;adding&quot; and &quot;when the coolant is drained&quot; ... which i infer to
mean that they expect you to replace the coolant.

based on what that BASF tech guy (and other folks) said, and what i've seen
happen to other people's cars, i don't see how they could come up with an
automobile coolant that could NOT need replacing. but a chemist i am not.
