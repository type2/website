Subject: Repco Metal Masters

We have sold Repco Metal Master brake pads for 26 years.  Some facts:
   Repco has changed name to Axxis.  Now available as Lucas GPX and Beck
Arnley 088's.  Repco (semi metalic) Metal Masters have a life time warranty.
They don't fade, squeal or dust.  They DO NOT warp rotors.  They are such a
good pad and impervious to heat that we have many autocrossers using these
pads.  We have never understood where the hard on rotors reputation came from.

  If you have any questions please feel free to call us.
