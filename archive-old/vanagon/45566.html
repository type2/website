&gt;     You must be talking about Manhattan Kansas.  Its only about 110 miles
&gt;from KC. Fort Leavenworth is north of Kansas City.  Seems like you were a
&gt;little lost on this trip.  :-)
&gt;
And Lawrence is a veritable 'garden spot', I loved living and going to
school there in the late 70s.  Even Manhattan is pretty nice, especially
compared to Junction City.  JC was hookers and dope pushers and strip joints
and their military customers.  It must have been what the residents of River
City feared what would happen to their city when the Music Man came to town.
You know, 'P and that stands for Pool and that rhymes with T which stands
for 'Trouble.'&quot;
