I've now heard two stories in two days of busses lost to raging fires... Will
compose a dirge for your lost Kombi, Thom!
This reminded me of another stupid trick I tried once - when I first got my
bus, the fuel filter kept clogging with huge flakes of rust colored crud.  On
a long, twisty mountain road home, the first filter bit the rust, requiring
me to coast into the first safe pull-off I could find (happily, a friendly
rural driveway).  And lucky me, I just happened to have a spare filter, so
set about replacing the bad boy.  Pulled what I thought to be the &quot;dry&quot; side
of the fuel line off first - *wrong*!!!  Gas shot out all over the place, so
I quickly capped it with my thumb while groping/kicking for the tool box and
grabbed the first small cylindrical object I found, rammed it down the gas
line -  wiped my brow, THEN realized - it was a plastic pen and was melting
before my eyes!!  After carving nearly 4 inches of hose away, (and with
*wooden* pencil in hand!) I finally got past the gluey, sloppy mess that used
to be a writing instrument to fresh flowing gazzohleen.  Nothing but pencils
in my toolbox now!
