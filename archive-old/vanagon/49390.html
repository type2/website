&gt; this much?  I'd never buy an air cooled van with A/C, but I thought the H2O vans

&gt; does it take to get reasonably cool inside once you turn it on?  How many of you
&gt; out there have removed your compressor belts too ?  My '84 has the big factory
&gt; sunroof but no A/C. The '87 I just bought had the A/C compressor belt removed. I
&gt; wonder if I should just keep my '84 with it's &quot;natural&quot; air cond (sunrf) as I
&gt; won't have to worry about a compressor dogging the engine. Or is the top hp of a
&gt; 1.9 without A/C the same as a 2.1 with the A/C on full blast??
&gt; 
&gt; A/C would be nice, but I really don't want to kill the engine, and have the
&gt; accelerating power of my '67 bus!  (ie.- reeaal slooowww...)

        AC is the biggest load on an engine I know of. Some cars
        have a switch on the accelerator that will shut off the
        AC compressor when your foot is on the floor. I have a manual
        switch on mine. If I am going down hills I switch the AC On.
        Up hills I switch it off.
