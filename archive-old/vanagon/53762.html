I had my oil light blink and buzz intermittently , indicating the
highpress oil sensor went off in my 91 Carat last week ....(I blew my
head gaskets soon after (within minutes). My best guess is that the
overheat of the engine cooked the oil and caused it to  loose its
viscosity. (I dont believe my low pressure warning ever went off).
   How much would  viscosity affect the oil pressure?  Could the less
viscous oil cause only the high pressure sensor to go off without the
lower pressures sensor going off? 
The oil level is full, but smells really burnt.


I pulled the heads and they dont look too bad...they are off to the
machine shop tomorrow....

Im pulling the heads tomorrow to see the damage.
