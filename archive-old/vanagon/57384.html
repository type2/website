&gt; &gt; oh, and I don't know if anyone mentioned this already or not - don't use your
&gt; &gt; oil fill cap to prop open the lisc plate door - It'll fall behind the bumper
&gt; &gt; and you'll spend a half an hour trying to fish it out.....  :&lt;)
&gt; 
&gt; Also.....dont lean over the engine (hatch off..) with the ONLY key in
&gt; your mouth......it has a tendency to fall into teh depths and require
&gt; MUCH soul (and other places) searching to find it again....:)
&gt; 
&gt; i think it took my cousin a month find it when he did that...(85 GL...)
&gt; 
&gt; but he biked to work anyhow..(lived in Jax FL....:)
&gt; 
&gt; sheesh..i am REALLy rambling today...

 Once I dropped my keys down into that thin crevice in between the
storage locker and the water tank. DOH!! Nothing is more frustrating
than seeing them only one foot away and knowing from experience that
they're now practically irretrievable. &quot;Oh well, I guess we're camping
here, I'm just too tired to be MacGuyver tonight...&quot;
