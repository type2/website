Subject: Seeking advice on my first bus/van purchase

After a few years of being curious about owning a vw camper, I have decided
to take the plunge. Part of me can't wait to have one but I don't want to
make a bad choice. Please can you offer me your expertise?

I have started researching how the vans have evolved but do not yet have a
clear sense of what would be best for me.

My definite criteria are: under $4,000; manual transmission; and a pop
top/westfalia.

&gt;From what I have read, I assume I should avoid a pre-1977.5 in order to not
deal with adjusting the valves. I also read that the after 1980 the
suspension/ handling improved due to the wishbone front suspension. And
finally, I have heard that after 1983, the first few years of the water
cooled engine were trouble prone. I am assuming that given my budget there
is no way that I can purchase a trouble free Wasserboxer (i.e., mid-late
80's on). So right now I am looking at 80-83's.

Are my assumptions correct? What has been your experience? What do you wish
you had done that you didn't? Should I save up more money or can I get a
fun vehicle which I drive more than I repair?

Thanks in advance for your help.
See you on the road...
