Subject: SPECIAL DEALS On Parts

Hello All,

Below are some one-shot deals and distributor specials that I got. I'll 
have these prices for a few weeks, or until sold out (whichever comes 
first; some are pretty limited). 

I am working on setting up an E-Mailing List for monthly specials, which I 
think will be up and running within a few weeks.  At that point, anyone who 
is signed up with me will get first crack at these specials, before they 
are announced anywhere else   If you want to receive these, and haven't 
signed up already, please e-mail me, using the subject heading  SPECIALS 
LIST.

Because my mailing list is not working in time for these specials, I 
thought I'd post this month's deals to the List as a whole. While I could 
continue to do so once a month if you folks want me to, at the same time I 
don't want to offend anybody who may feel it inappropriate for the List. If 
you have an opinion on this, please e-mail me directly.  

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
