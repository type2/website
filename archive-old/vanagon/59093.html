&gt;     After the recent discussion about fog lights and city lights I got
&gt;to thinking again about upgrading the lights on my 84 (and eventually the
&gt;85) to a 7&quot; H4 light.
&gt;     Does anyone have any experience with these?  There seem to be a few
&gt;different kits, some obviously illegal, some supposedly legal.  What is
&gt;the difference?  And finally, is there any wiring involved?  I'd be
&gt;surprised if the H4's use the sealed beam sockets.

actually, it's extremely easy ... the H4 lights just pop in where the old
sealed beam bulbs used to be, and YES, the H4 bulb DOES use the same
connector as the sealed beam. :)

the ONLY downside is the cost. :(  the ones i'm using right now are the
Hella Vision Plus lights. they're $40US per SIDE. :( but the light is
SOOOOOOO much better than the old sealed beams, it's really worth it to me.
(yeah, i know: ask me again after a rock takes out one of my reflectors!)

my previous H4 lights were the Cibie Z-Beam's ... personally, i think the
Hella's are a bit better. the Z-Beam's were &quot;for off-road use only&quot;, but
that was a &quot;get-around&quot; for the days when halogen/replaceable-bulb lights
were illegal in the u.s.  the Hella Vision Plus lights are perfectly u.s.
legal. Bosch also makes some 7&quot; round H4 lights, and Cibie and Marchal also
have newer upgraded lights. it's just a matter of choice, really ... but
expect to pay $30-40 per light. :(
