Subject: 71' bus type vehicle

its got dual Kadrons on a 1776cc motor.  The carbs need a rebuild and to 
be sync'd.  Have never worked on one in my life.  Is it worth it to learn 
how and pay $10 for the rebuild kit, or just pay $200 to have a shop do 
it.  Also, whats a good repair manual? 

BTW- Mustangs rule.  VWs rule.  89' GT /  71' bus
