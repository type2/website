Subject: Re: Smoking Transmission?

I always thought that oil smoked when ignited or brought to very high 
temps.  Well the oil in the trans has no way of being ignited (no spark 
plugs) and if it reached temps high enough to smoke the oil I would think 
you'd be able to tell just by getting close to the trans.  I know under 
normal working conditions my trans stays cool because there is supposed 
to be very low friction between the gears.  Well just my thoughts.
