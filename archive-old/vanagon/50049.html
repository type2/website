&gt;To anyone or everyone,
&gt;
&gt;I have stumbled upon an 87 GL wasserboxer Wolfsburg edition that my wife and
&gt;i are very interested in.  I am asking your collective opinion about whether
&gt;you think it is a good deal, a good year/model, and/or a good investment.
&gt;Of course, all of those things go on the backburner compared to how bad I
&gt;really want to own a Vanagon. I have not owned one yet, but both my wife and
&gt;I grew up being carted around the country in VW buses, and we would like to
&gt;continue the tradition.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, I wondered what opinions are about replacing the head gasket.
&gt;Obviously it needs to be done, usually around 50K, right?  But, does the
&gt;problem reoccur every 50K, or is once good enough, particularly if they do a
&gt;good job--which I am not too clear on.  The guy who is selling says only
&gt;once, but my Dad says it is periodic. who is right?  
&gt;
&gt;Here are specs:
&gt;
&gt;1987 Vanagon Camper (no pop-top, just fold down bed in back) Wolfsburg
Edition, 
&gt;Euro Model (captain chairs and chairs directly behind the front seats),
&gt;New wheels (thick looking ones, don't know what they call them), 
&gt;new brake discs and pads, 
&gt;head gasket replaced at 70,000 miles, 
&gt;exhaust system replaced some time soon after that, 
&gt;2.1 litre water cooled engine,
&gt;automatic transmission 
&gt;am/fm cassette with sweet speakers, 
&gt;power locks and windows and an alarm system that is not currently activated
&gt;but could be,
&gt;air conditioning that apparently works like a charm,
&gt;107,000 miles, mostly in california, no rust to speak of,
&gt;and most importantly, heated mirrors :)
&gt;
&gt;$5,500  (book is 5,900)
&gt;
&gt;opinions?  sorry so long,

I don't know of anyone who has replaced the heads twice.  I think the JB
Weld guys have only done the job once. I am at 95k on the original heads. I
have the 86 Wolfsburg w/poptop.  The price seems fair, but not great.  I
would not depend on the AC more than I had to.  I never have been happy with
the AC.
