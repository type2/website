Subject: Starting problems.... 


- In the last two days my 84' vanagon has been having starting
problems, I changed the spark plug wires to new Bocsh ones this
weekend.  It's also been pretty hot in the bay area. Before, it
started every time just fine. 

- Anyway, the symptoms are : 

1. Starts just fine first thing in the morning, runs fine once 
   started. 

2. After the first start of the day, it turns over but does not 
   catch. There's a strong smell of gas.


 Yesterday, I checked the spark and it looked yellow, plus there
was carbon on the rotor &amp; distributor cap. I installed an new 
coil ( after a couple hours of cooling off ) and it started and
ran fine. When I got home, I tried restarting it and it started,
but ran rough, gunning the engine for a bit smoothed it out. On
the second try it would not start at all, with same gas smell.

This morning I went out and it turned over just fine. I tried it 
a couple times and it was okay. I got to work after about 1hr 
driving and it now displays the same symptoms.. 

- I suspect some part of the car is heating up and dropping the 
voltage to the coil. Any suggestions as to where I should start
looking ?
