I have a 78 camper (167k on orig. engine)- I'd like to put temp gauge on
it- is yours on oil temp or cyl, block?  What brand, and how purchased?
The temps sound normal; my 71 camper bus also got to 250 on long hauls
(oil dipstick sender).  Your milage sounds low- we get about 20 on open
roads-is your compression ok (over 100)?  I'd check dwell (points), then
timing- former must be adjusted first if off (48-52 deg.).  Advance can be
checked with timing light; rev up the engine and it should advance the
mark.  If this is a recent rebuild, could be hot from friction and
compresswion low until rings seal.....MB in NJ
