Subject: Sounds like birds in my front heater blower

Front heater blower is making one heck of a racket when on full blast. 
Sounds like a flock of birds in there trying to get out. Not sure what 
kind they are! Also started making that nasty burning plastic smell that 
my wife likes so much. 

Any advice before we go bird hunting?
