&gt;David:
&gt;I've got a JC Whipme catalog here now, but I don't see an 800 number!?
&gt;The only number I see is 312.431.6102 (24 hours, Chicago). Free shipping 
&gt;for orders over $200 though. Whipee.
&gt;Good luck

I also have a JC whipme catalogue. The toll free number is 1-800-553-1872
for voice and 1-800-228-2888 for fax. My catalogue is the Canadian version
(Ft. Erie Ont. ), but I always get a babe with a *strong* southern accent
(&quot;can y'all please spell 'Saskatchewan'?&quot;), so I think the calls are routed
to the U.S.
