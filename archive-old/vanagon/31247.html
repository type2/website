Subject: Carbon buildup

All,

I know of various ways to remove carbon buildup from the heat risers on DP
engines, but can one apply the same methods to removing buildup from heat
exchangers? Particularly where the extractor bolts to the exit ports of the
exchangers.  This is for my 79 Westy, with 2 exhaust ports on the heater boxes.
I would assume that the same methods could be applied to the heat exchangers
on the Thing motor as well. Though I haven't had an opportunity to examine
them as of late.
I would imagine that removing the buildup would greatly improve exhaust flow
thus making the engine exhale easier.

Waiting with restricted breath
