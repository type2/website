&lt;&lt; It's probably because NOT ALL Buses 68-79 and Vanagons thru 1987 have Air
 Conditioning (&amp; 88-91's using those Rear Side Window Vents too) because
 it was an OPTION - not standard equipment (even though most of them on
 the lot here in California had it installed due to marketing surveys I
 suspect).  And when these vehicles were new, they *were* pretty darn
 air-tight.  Ever try to close any of the doors with seals, felts, etc.,
 having been newly installed? &gt;&gt;

We love the door vents on Suzy' 1976. Having just reupholstered, insulated,
soundproofed and undercoated her van, it is unbeleivably airtight. (As above,
just TRY closing the door with all of the windows up!).

I have been across and through that body (the Van's, that is) from end to
end, and there is no place for air to escape without these vents, not a drain
hole, nothing. Opening and closing these vents makes a significant difference
in the amount of air allowed into the bus through the front grill vent
system. No complaints, kudos, VW!!!

thanks for letting me vent,
