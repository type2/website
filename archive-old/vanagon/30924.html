Subject: Might Need Help! Are you along I-40???

Under the &quot;Where's your compassion&quot; heading:

Presently planning a trek across the US in a recently
purchased Vanagon (maybe . . . this is all contract
pending!).  If you live along the I-40 corridor and
would be willing to serve as a &quot;Safe Haven&quot; in the
event said vanagon bites the big one, please
contact me asap with your addr. and telephone
number.  Being stranded for a day or so isn't so
bad when you have a friendly soul to yuk it up with.

(and remember, it's x-mas, so be christmas-y).

I am heading out within the next 48 hours so let
me know.  Email asap with your name, general location
and tele. (did I say that already??)

William Gau
85-90 Wannabus (but hopefully not for long)

P.S. I'm not a mooch and won't move in with you,
I just don't have a cell phone that will work in
some areas!
