Stephen,

My Alternator &amp; Oxygen also stay on until the enging gets reved.  A
mechanic told me that is the way it is supposed to be.  Anyway, it is
normal for the vanagon to do this.... I've had mine since '89 and had no
major problems so I think you can disregard this.

The idle rev at &gt;6,500 ft sounds odd though and I've never experienced
that in my van, although it does cut out on me around that elevation.  I
posted about this a couple weeks back and got a few responses from people,
one of which believed the coil was the culprit, another, that had replaced
the coil, found that a new coil didn't help.

So, happy campine -- I have yet to meet a vanagon owner whose vehicle
didn't a some flakeyness that they live with.

&gt; Subject: Westy Purchase / Questions
&gt;
&gt; Just wanted to report the I have purchased my first Westy
&gt; from listmember Malcolm Williamson.  Since I am located
&gt; in Jackson, WY (anyone want to visit?) and he is located in
&gt; Fayetteville, AR, we met in Tulsa, OK (I flew, he drove) where
&gt; I purchased the vehicle from him.  I want to thank the list
&gt; for putting me in contact with Malcolm and allowing me to feel
&gt; some modicum of trust in buying a vehicle over $1300 miles away.
&gt;
&gt; So, driving from OK to WY allowed me to explore / experience my
&gt; new Westy.  Camped in Rocky Mtn National Park in CO on the way.
&gt; While in the park, I encountered two small problems.  First,
&gt; whenever I left the Westy stopped for more than ~5 min, and then
&gt; went to restart it, the Alternator and Oxygen Sensor lights would
&gt; stay on until I revved the engine.  This stopped happening as I
&gt; dropped in Altitude (I was around 11,000-12,000 ft) and the
&gt; temperature of the day increased.  The manual seemed to indicate
&gt; that this was normal for the Alternator light, but not for the O2
&gt; sensor.  Anyone think that this is an indication of a potential
&gt; problem?
&gt;
&gt; The other problem that started around ~7000 ft after a long day of
&gt; driving, was that at idle the engine would rev up and down ~50 to ~100
&gt; rpms, causing the vehicle to &quot;surge&quot; forward when stopped.
&gt; This problem seems to get worse the longer I drive, but does
&gt; not go away entirely.  Any thoughts as to what might cause a problem
&gt; like this?  My first thought is the altitude change, as Jackson is
&gt; at about 6500 ft.  Solutions ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
