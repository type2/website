Sorry to bother you again.  But now I am in the need for a daily driver Bus.
 I will be putting my Scirocco into storage due to some unforseen
cirumstances, so I will need another daily driver.  i am looking for anything
between '72 and '79.  This is a regular Bus, not a camper.  I was wondering
if there was any way that I could get you to post that ontot he Vanagon
board?  I would subscribe to the Vanagon list, but same as before,, I am
currently getting too much e-mail, to the point that I would not be able to
keep up with the list.

Let me know if you are willing to do this, or if you need more information.

Thank you,

Tim :)
