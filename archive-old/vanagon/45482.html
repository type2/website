Subject: Alberta camping suggestions?

        I'm looking for somewhere new or unique to go camping this weekend
as was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for places here in Alberta.
Im in Edmonton and am willing to go as far as 500 km in any direction.
        I'll be heading out in the Nordegg, Braseau Dam vicinity if no one
can suggest anything but I thought Id see if anyone has any favorite spots
they could pass on. We're looking to do a bit of hiking and will have our
fishing rods along.

        thanks in advance, and thanks to all those of you who gave me the
great info on pop top seal prices etc.

standing on gaurd for thee,
