Subject: Rusty's IRC link

Rusty VanBondo has initially set up on:

 DALnet:phoenix.dal_dot_net (USA)

Great! One more reason for folks to tell me to &quot;get a life&quot;! =)
Blame/Thanks to Martha and David Schwarze!
**Let me know if we need to be on a specific server**

Dave mentioned on 1/23/96 that he is on the SanDiego &quot;channel.&quot;
Rusty still doesn't have clue one as to this IRC thing but did a Netscape
search under IRC or mIRC. Best bet to check Dave S web page
(http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des) for details relating to your individual
syaytem needs.
