Subject: coolant leak

Got a coolant leak from what appears to be the thermostat, or somewhere
near it.  All this since my wife drove for a while after the water-pump
belt broke.

I haven't been able to pinpoint the leak.  Any &quot;usual suspects&quot;?

I've also got a leak from either the coolant level warning switch or the
coolant expansion tank cap, but I can't tell which.
