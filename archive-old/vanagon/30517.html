&gt; I know there has been some discussion regarding a V_at_L bumper sticker...
&gt; could someone whip one up before 12/30??
&gt; 
While I am indeed looking into the sticker business, it won't be that
soon. My parents have several catalogs from different printing companies
that they have worked with in the past. What I will most likely do is to
peruse these catalogs while I am home for Christmas, and then present
the options to you, the wonderful list, sometime in early January...
So, sorry about the Europe thing, but there is hope for the rest of us.
 Oh, as to the sleepers and fuzzy pajamas, I'm looking into that. They
made mine as a special favor, and uh...oops.
never mind.
:)
Richard
