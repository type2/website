Everyone else must have thought so too because I didn't get any replies.
:-)

On the other hand, there needs to be a test to find what I found (O2
sensor wire shorted (?) with the shielding for that wire (said shielding
being tied to pin 6 of the ECU connector and from there to the Air Flow
Meter)
You are probably right that it might not be a good idea, but it WAS the
key to finding the problem.  In the future, I will recommend checking
impedance between pin 5 and 6 on the ECU connector with the ECU
disconnected and the Air Flow Meter connector disconnected also.

&gt; Check:  I would like to know what resistance you get on this. &quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I have a modest concern about this.  In essense you are probing a very high
&gt; impedence input channel with an ohmeter.  Depending upon the meter and
&gt; resistance range selected on the meter, such action imposes a voltage into
&gt; this input channel that may not be compatible with the circuit under test. 
&gt; Without know the components, meter, and circuit,  there is some potential risk
&gt; of damage in this process.

Of course, in my case it wasn't a high impedance channel -- it was 20ohms.
Which was the problem.   :-)

I'm cc:ing the list so the concerns are heard.
