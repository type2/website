Subject: Antenna Replacement

Thanks for all of your suggestions.  I'll be tackling this later in the week;
I'll let you all know how it goes.  I know it seems silly to make it sound
like such a big project, but I've had the grille and headlights out before,
and there's no apparent access to the antenna that way.  It's pretty well
surrounded by sheet metal.  Anyway, I'll let you know.

BTW, there's a new Web Site out for O.J. Simpson:

(With apologies to the defense team and all who truly believe he's innocent)
