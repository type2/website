Subject: Re: Year model...

I was checking one of the model description lists in the gopher archives
and found info that disagrees with info that I found in a book.  The gopher
archive for models between '49 &amp; ? says that The Bozobus (682457) is a '60,
but the book said that the same S/N was a '61.  Mr. Bozo's manufacturing
date (from VW AG) is 11/15/60, which would lead me to believe that he's a
'61 model year vehicle.  Any truly definitive answers?  I wouldn't want my
data in the weakly stats (or in my alternate signature file) to be wrong...
-------

chassis #682 457 is listed in my sources as being produced in November of
1960.  They didn't start the offset model year until the 65 model year in
fall 64.  So yours would be a 60 model year bus.   im sorry, but what is
&quot;S/N&quot;?    I know of several vws registered as a year later that the
production, especially with earlier ones made late in the year.  I think it
was beecause they were sold in the next year, but this is pure speculation.
