Subject: Paradise by the dashboard lights


Actually, it would be paradise just to be able to _see_ the dashboard lights.

$$Amazing! My speedometer now moves like a Rolex, and is well lighted,

...it led to the following inquiry:

How does one replace those bulbs ('70), where does one find them, and 
about the plastic--that too??
