Thanks very much to all who replied re my congealed oil problem. This is a
very cool list.

Several people suggested a dose of diesel fuel/kerosene, one person
suggests much sloshing, and one person recommends heating it up over a
flame. Since (as you know) anything worth doing is worth doing excessively,
I have determined to combine all these into one regimen, to wit:

I will fill it up with diesel fuel by pouring it through the intake
manifold, then boil it over a Coleman stove for a few hours, sloshing all
the while. While singing hymns. =:o

Seriously, everybody says I'm begging for trouble trusting this bottom end
to get me a hundred yards, and the more I look at it the more I think
you're all right. There's rust in there, there's discernable slop in one of
the rod bearings which means there was pounding on the other end, two of
the studs sheared when I took the exhaust off...

I'm not really going to build a bomb with it. I'm gonna do major surgery.

Thanks again,
