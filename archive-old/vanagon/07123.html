&gt;And mine is invisible except when it's dark. So at twilight if I turn on
&gt;my headlights I can only know whether they're high or low by resorting to
&gt;my memory. Fortunately I have a fabulous memory and can always recall
&gt;precisely whether my lights were on high or low beam at last usage...
&gt;Are there any easy cures for this problem? Get a bigger bulb?

hmmmmm. it should be pretty visible even in the daytime. maybe the volts
ain't getting to it? or the bulb is going bad? try cleaning the contacts
for the dash instrument lighting and such.

&gt;Put a green LED in. My 82 has a green one, as does my spare instrument
&gt;cluster. I guess the folks responsible for the General Agreement on
&gt;Lights and Things slipped.

i always wondered if that would work! :)  but i kinda like the blue, so i
left it alone.

this is kinda wierd. not only do the campers have different led's for their
refrigerators, but now we run into strange differences in other lighting.
i wonder if your 82 green led was put in by some previous owner?
