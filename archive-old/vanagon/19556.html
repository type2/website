This is a great idea, and solves 2 problems: bulbs burning out, and keeping the 
right color. Most LEDs seem to like about 20mA of current. That would lead to 
(14.4-.7) V / 0.02 A = 685 Ohms (or something close) for the current limiting 
resistor. Power dissipation works out to I2 * R = 0.27W, so a 1/4W resistor is 
cutting it close - this is one of the larger SMT resistor packages, 1206 or 1210
I think.

&gt; To All:
&gt; 
&gt; When your indicator lights go out and it comes time to do the dreadful deed,
&gt; consider doing away with the lights entirely by replacing them with
&gt; high-intensity LEDs.  
&gt; 
&gt; While there are some fiddlee-bits involved in converting an incandescent lamp
&gt; to LED, the basic idea is to crush the bulb, clean the cement from the brass
&gt; base, desolder the center connector, and rebuild the thing incorporating an
&gt; LED and current-limiting resistor.  For anyone experienced with surface-mount
&gt; electronic components slightly smaller than a gnat's ass, the task is
&gt; trivial.
&gt; 
&gt; The result is a colored lamp (Red, Yellow, or Green only) that will last for
&gt; as long as your great-grandchild owns the vehicle.
