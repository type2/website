Subject: Headlights Grounded!


(On my 1980 Westy)

I wrote in a while ago having headlight problems.  When I would turn the 
head lights on the &quot;brights indicator&quot; would light up, and I had no 
headlights.  Plus, when I turned the turn signals on, the indicator 
lights would flash back and forth from the green turn signal light -&gt; the 
red brights indicator light.  (hard to explain all this in words)

Anyway, some people from the list helped me brainstorm on the problem, 
and we figured it was a grounding problem.

As I was checking around under the dash last night, I noticed about five 
brown wires ( I figured out brown is the color for grounding wires) 
attached to some sort of prong-like thing screwed into the body of my 
van.  It is located to the right of the fuse box, and back into the 
dash. There was two loose wires, and one that was melted, and broken. 
The melted, broken one turned out to be the headlights grounding wire.  

Pretty cool!!!  Since it was melted, I just cut the metal connector off 
it, and grounded it somewhere else.  

If anyone has a similar problem, and need help, e-mail me and maybe I can 
help.

Kyle
