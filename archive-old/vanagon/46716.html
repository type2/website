Subject: Re: The herky-jerky (a new dance step?)

My herky-jerky bus presently is suffering from a broken front transmission
mount.  It seemed to get into this broken state by the abuse it suffered
from the past cause of hery-jerky's -- the worn spots in the air-flow
sensor box, and the herky-jerky's before that -- a broken ground wire.

I think that this is the *normal* mode of operation for these things -- 
and I have not gotten into the new wiring harness version that is so
much discussed.

My biggest suprise so far on a Vanagon was just how badly they run with
a small hole in the exhaust pipe.  I blew out the seal between the pipe
sections just forward of the Catalytic converter, and it basically did
not want to run at all.  Disconnecting the O2 sensor got me to a friendly
auto-parts store (in Winnemucca) but used incredible quantities of gasoline.
Tiny things seem to affect these cars all out of proportion to their
apparent scope.  Thank god they run as well as they seem to most of the
time!
