Subject: '80 Vanagon exhaust system
Date: Fri, 15 Mar 96 10:49:59 PST

My '80 Vanagon needs the exhaust system replaced.  The van has a catalytic
converter and my city (Spokane, WA) has stringent emissions testing.  The van
presently does pass emissions testing even though the cat is almost certainly
useless (rotted out).  To avoid future potential hassles, I am willing to 
try and restore the factory exhaust system; ie. Replace the existing components
and retain the catalytic conveter.  However, a check with the dealer indicates
that the crossover pipe is no longer available.  I called Bus Boys and they no
longer have any.  

Is it possible to fabricate the crossover pipe?  Could a good muffler shop (not
Midas) construct one?  The crossover pipe is quite complicated.  The name is 
misleading.  It is not a pipe, but more of a manifold connecting the exhaust
headers from both sides of the engine.  It also has an integral  U-shaped pipe 
on the driver's side which connects to the cat (and subsequently the muffler). 

So what is the general consensus?  Can such a part be fabricated?
