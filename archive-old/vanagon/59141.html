Subject: Re: Dash blower install...


Chris,

I don't know the arrangement of the aircooled blower assembly. But I changed
mine from air-cooled without blower to water-cooled with blower. You easily
disassemble the whole iron dashboard, I did it with the attached steering
column because there are two screws I could not open. The dashboard is hold
on 2 screws each side and some below the windshield. You can not disassemble
the heater assembly without removing the dashboard.

The wiring of the blower is not included but easily to add. You have to add
the brown ground strip from the blower to the ground reference point left
under the dashboard. The connector with the three yellow wires has to be
attached to the fan switch and the red/black wire goes to a fuse terminal,
I think it should be fuse#12.

You may search the archives, there are some mails with additional 
information
on this chapter.
