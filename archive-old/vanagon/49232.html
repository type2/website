Hotch,
The first thing that comes to mind is ;check the resistor (and
connections for) that drops the voltage for low speed. If you know high
speed works then 2nd stage relay and fuse MUST be good.(Unless some hack
has rewired it to compensate for overheating like on my wifes bus).The
resistor is located in the cavity above the spare tire.Check for
good,clean connections . Do you have access to a volt/ ohm meter?Let me
know, as indicated above I had to spend more time in this area than I
care to admit.

&gt;Hi Guys,
&gt;My 86 GL's radiator fan is only going on when it's time for the high 
&gt;speed.
&gt;Low speed is not going on at all, not even when the A/C is on.  I have
&gt;checked the 2nd stage relay (good) and the fuse (good).  I haven't 
&gt;made it
&gt;to the fan switch yet.
&gt;
&gt;What else should I check and how do I check it.
