I have an 84 Vanagon GL.  How's the rear bumper, and all bumper end-caps?   
(Any idea if they're the same from 81 to 84?)
Thanks,
EricG

I am parting out an '81 Vanagon in Denver. The motor, trans, front turn
signals, grille, sliding door handle have been sold to other list
members, but almost everything else is still available. All of the parts
are original German, fairly priced, and guaranteed. Also, I am happy to
ship COD in the continental US.
Please E-mail if interested.
TIA,
Josh
