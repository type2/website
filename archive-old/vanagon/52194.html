Subject: 3 more VWs for sale!
Date: Sun, 24 Nov 96 14:21:44 EST

Hey all,
Whoops!  Overlooked the Antiques &amp; Classics section of the Classifieds
this morning, where three more VWs are hiding, one bus among them.

'73 Bus, classic R/W (I assume red/white), '96 MD inspection, lovingly
maintained, garaged, rebuilt Porsche 924 (I think they mean 914) engine
at 98K.  Student owner, must sell, 110K, mid seat/rear stor.  $3800 obo,
301-949-8707.

'72 Super Beetle, dark blue, good condition, 3rd owner, $2500,
703-620-0461.

'66 Beetle, nice original type, some rust, needs work, $600.
703-451-8643.

I'll try to pay more attention next time! :)

Sean
