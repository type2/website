Subject:      a race for the lead (that's LEEEEEED), stat-wise

well, folks, thanks to a new recruit with a 73 camper, the 73's and 71's
are now TIED again!  if just a few of you 'Unknowns' would come out of the
garage, we might have a definite winner in one of these categories. :)

&lt;and you 82 and 85 vanagons need to beat the bushes for more brick-drivers!&gt;
