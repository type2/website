Subject: RE: Much mail, where was the VW content?

This is why there is too much mail for you guys, your posting no VW content!
If everyone followed the rules then it'd be a lot more breif and to the
point. Ya know, no urban legends....

Anyways, We gotta go pick up our new type 2 swing axle next week, then I
gotta put it in.  Only problem, getting an engine swap from a bug to a bus
before then.


&gt;I would like to second Dan's comments, I am finding the amount of 
&gt; traffic a little overwhelming.

&gt;from the vanagon list - 140 pieces this morning.
