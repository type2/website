Subject:       Re: vwoa/head gasket/heater core (VWofCanada ??)

&gt; All in all, I was pleased with the service from VWofA, and considered their
&gt; offer fair, if not generous (considering the 93,000 miles on the
&gt; out-of-warranty van).
&gt; 

Has anyone recieved feedback from VW of Canada on this issue, either 
positive or negative? I'd like to be prepared in advance...
