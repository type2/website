Subject: Help on buying '87 Westy

Thanks to Frank, Tim and Joel for your helpful messages!

I drove the Westy last night - it runs very quiet, and seems to have 
pretty good power, but: 
-Power at low revs (ie: 1500-2500) is very poor and 'rough' - it 
lurches when pulling away in second at around 2000. Accel. through the 
gears seemed ok, but it couldn't hold speed in 3rd at about 2500 rpm 
going up a gentle slope... Is this likely to be a timing problem? The 
Toyota dealer has replaced plugs &amp; belts, but hasn't done much else 
(and they claim to have spent 1400 on it including battery &amp; 
alternator!!)

-After driving about 15 minutes at moderate speed, I ran up the 
highway at about 3500rpm in 3rd, before braking for a hard right turn 
to the dealer, and up a short hill (in 1st), after which the oil 
pressure light/buzzer came on- it stayed on for 5-10 secs before I 
killed the engine &amp; coasted. Temp was middle gauge, fan not on. I 
started it again &amp; seemed fine, oil level ok.
I suspect that the run at 3500 pumped the oil to the heads, and the 
quick stop &amp; turn starved the oil pickup for a moment, but I can't 
believe it was this easy to do...
My Jetta's got 330K &amp; only had this happen once, while climbing a 
mountain pass flat-out (turbo diesel)...
Is this a common thing, or should I be looking for signs of trouble 
here?

-Is the '87 a 1.9 or 2.1 l. ? Is there a code difference? The engine 
looks *very* clean (NO oil underneath) almost like it's been steam 
cleaned. 
-It also seemed to wander (slightly) at 80-90 km/h on the highway - 
is this just tires/alignment, or are there steering parts that wear 
out around 190K km? (it could have been ruts in the road, it was hard 
to tell...)

I plan to have the VW service dealer check it out today, but any 
advice would be appreciated.
The only reason I'm spending more time on this one is the body is 
nearly mint - the paint is like new, even along the bottom edges and 
inside the wheel wells. The side panel where the fridge is has been 
repainted, but it looks good, and the rest is original paint. 

So far all indications are that the price of $12900 is about 2-3K too 
high, but it seems in line with others in BC. Are there any BC 
members who can confirm that BC prices are higher than say, Ontario? 
The dealer has stated that they gave 11,400 for it, and have spent 
1400 on it since. I'm thinking of offering 11 or 11,500 if it checks 
out, since the 1400 work done is a load of crap...

Thanks for your help.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
