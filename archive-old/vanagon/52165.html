Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

For the mechanically inclined, and without AC...  there has been
considerable discussion on the off-road list about Cadillac air pumps being
used as tire pumps.  The other choice is a AC pump converted.  The AC pump
needs the freon etc for lubrication, but apparently a good shot of
WD-40/Duralube etc. will make then last well enough.  The electric clutch
must be switched manually when air is needed.  I know nothing about these
ideas firsthand.
