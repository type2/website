&gt;I recently purchased a 1977 type II transporter for the paltry sum of
&gt;$375. The bus is in wonderful condition except for a chronic oil leak. Oil
&gt;only leaks when the engine is running and continues for a short period
&gt;after the engine is stopped. The leak consumes approximately one quart of
&gt;oil every 75 miles of highway driving, but the rate also appers to depend
&gt;on how warm the engine is and ambient air temp. The oil is leaking from
&gt;the rear of the engine between the block and the fan shrouding. I replaced
&gt;the oil cooler and associated gaskets (o-rings) in hopes that this
&gt;expensive repair would quell the flood of oil from my engine.
My ex-girlfriend's '78 blew one of those plugs they install in the ends of
the oil passages, what might be called a freeze plug.  It was behind the
flywheel and when she took it to the local repair shop they claimed all they
could do was seal it back in with JB Weld or similar.  It held okay until
several months later when the engine dropped a valve seat and I rebuilt it.
While I had the engine out and apart I had a local machine shop remove the
plug and thread the case for a pipe plug, which gave me a bit more piece of
mind than the JB Weld.  :-)
