Subject: Retrofitting AC to Westy

Hi all,

Thanks to all who responded to my post asking about retrofitting AC to my 84
Westy.  It sounds like it can be done but with some expense and/or the
installation may be dicey if old parts are used.  Was just at an auto AC shop
looking into getting the AC fixed on another vehicle and they were right in
the middle of installing an aftermarket AC kit to an 84 Westy.  Big job as
the hose and duct work under the dash was pretty involved.  They put the
?heat exchanger thing under the dash as opposed to up in the overhead
compartment.  Charging the guy over $2K for the install.  Guess I'll just put
up with the heat for now.  It's 96F today and not even Summer yet.
