Flash metallic silver 1990 syncro (4WD) Westfalia camper:

Fridge, stove, and sleeps 4. Vehicle has hi miles (132k) but you'd never
know if from the way it looks &amp; drives. A CT show winner this summer, it
has 'lived' most of it's life on west coast and in Germany -- mostly hiway
miles -- and has all papers. Rebuilt engine at 126k, and new tranny at 84k
so it drives smooth and strong. Full power pkg including: PS, PB, PW, PL,
Cruise Control, Viper alarm, Alpine remvbl cassette, immaculate in &amp; out.
Tires have about 34k, but comes with 2 add'l unused Michelin MXL's. Recent
new battery, starter, windshield, heater core, idler switch, as well.
Asking $19k, but minimally negotiable for a quicker sale.

email, or serious inquiries leave message at 800-380-8166.
thanks,
Jonah
