Subject: Re: PopTop Seals - NEW INFO &amp; prices!

&gt; Price would be $35.50 for a COMPLETE set, replacing both the poptop and
&gt; luggage rack sections.  (plus UPS.)  It's available in three sizes, for
&gt; '68-73 bus, '74-79 bus, or Vanagon.  I could also offer a smaller size for
&gt; splittie poptops, at a lower price, but I'm not too familiar with those
&gt; poptops.  Do they take the same seal?
&gt; 

Gee, I now take back any nasty things I might have ever implied about 
the illustrious Ron Salmon, or maybe not, I am an opinionated asshole 
afterall, and in a perpetual bad mood now days having recently lost 
my SO.  Still seems we have an excellent deal thanks to him, I 
might even up and order one myself if he gets any extras.
