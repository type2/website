&gt; Hi vanagon people,
&gt; Here's another question in my list.  Since it is kind-of snowy today,
&gt; it seems like a good day to ask questions.  (if you happen to live
&gt; south of Montana, forget that comment).
&gt; 

And you southern Americans think we've got it cold in Canada!
Hell Frank and I both live south of Montana...  Dave C. lives south of 
most of it.

Sorry Stuart you probably thought this was a reply for your starter 
bendix, but I have no experience with them.
If you Crazy Eskimos didn't subject them to such cold temps they wouldn't
have problems in the first place.   ;)
