Subject: Re: `66 electrical problems!

now my turn signals only work when the brake
&gt;lights are on! And my brake lights work not at all. 

Sounds like a bad ground(s) somewhere, the signals only get grounded via the 
brake wiring, my '72 had this problem, usually after a salty winter.  Maybe 
errr... they aren't rewired EXACTLY right err... no offense meant.  tim s.
