Subject: 40 Below and Temp

Hi all, as we are about to embark on our annual trip to the Maritimes I
have my usual dose of paranoia about cooling. It stems from my childhood,
er, our first trip when one of the small coolant hoses split and left us
very uncool. Anyway, I have seen references to a product called &quot;40 Below&quot;
made by Performance Resource, in NJ. Any ideas oh gurus of the gearshift?
        Second, I had the cooling system flushed this spring, I have 20 w -
50 Castrol in and the level in the tank is between Min and Max. As I was
driving around today the little temp needle would climb above the warning
light. It did not kick the fan on, and did not overheat. Am I being too
Paranoid and just drive or what? Words of encouragement needed. Finally, I
managed to install the old style louver windows in Seigfried. I promise to
write more and to correspond to those who wrote to me earlier. I want to do
this trip and see if any problems occur. So, more later.
        TIA,
        Mike - 86 Westy syncro, 67 Deluxe
