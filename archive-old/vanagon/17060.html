Subject: Re: Best Vanaogon Brake Pads?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can't quote using this mailer but someone said ALL brakes squeak.  I
&gt;&gt;beg to differ.  Mine NEVER did until they went bad about 2 months ago.
...

I always used OEM (audi) pads and my brakes NEVER squeak. Well, except once
when one of the pads had only metal left. It ate into the rotor a little in a
period of a few weeks. Had new OEM pads installed and then everything was back
to normal. New OEM rotors phuarsed waiting for the next occurance of squeaking
brakes again to completely rebuild the brake system. Beware dealers might 
install aftermarket pads in your vanagon. At least one dealer tried to sell
me Repco at OEM price. They said their mechanics recommanded them. I laughed
at their genuine VW parts slogan and went to another dealer to get OEM ones.
Repco pads did not work on vanagons. I still have a brand new set (actually
used a few miles) sitting in my garage. Should have returned them when the
receipt cound still be found.
