Hi Jim
Could you please post this ad on the web page and in the next transporter? Thanks!

For Sale/Trade: 1982 Diesel Westy. _at_ 8,000 on rebuilt motor and less than 2,000 on rebuilt transmission. Other repairs include: rebuilt starter, replaced hoses, rear main seal, brake master cylinder.  All receipts. Over $4500 spent.  All camping stuff intact, and canvas in great shape (screen is torn).  There is VERY minimal rust. However, there is body damage from previous owner, which is very fixable by someone with body experience. Would seriously consider trade for  70's camper (preferably standard), with little rust and in good running shape. Or $4300.
