Subject: Online maps/atlas plus more!

http://home.tig_dot_com  (specifically, http//www.mapquest_dot_com)

I was asked by the boss to check out a website for business reasons (I love
my job!) and found that it was pretty cool. The site includes links to
&quot;Mapquest,&quot; &quot;PPG,&quot; a thing called Parent Soup which I didnt delve into too
far as well as &quot;Market Manager,&quot; &quot;Business Site of the Day,&quot; and &quot;Domain
Database.&quot;

The Atlas and the PPG seemed to be of direct relevance to the Vanagon list.
Check it out  http://home.tig_dot_com 
or http://tig_dot_com

&quot;Mapquest&quot; = http//www.mapquest_dot_com
&quot;PPG&quot; = http//www.ppg_dot_com
 &quot;Market Manager&quot; = a web site development software (its a commercial offer btw)
&quot;Business Site of the Day&quot; = typical link stuff
&quot;Domain Database.&quot; = Java database for neat searches by zipcodes etc etc

*Check them out and have fun!*
