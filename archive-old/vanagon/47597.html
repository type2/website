Subject: Re: Fantastic New Discount Parts Source




&gt;This company is obviously the premier (lowest price) source for 
&gt;factory Vanagon parts in this country as it is a direct importer 
&gt;from Germany. Even if they won't sell to us (cause we are not 
&gt;wholesale accounts and don't buy enough individually) they ought 
&gt;to be willing to sell to the higher volume folks, like Bus Boys, 
&gt;Dennis Haynes, (or even a mythical single entity called the 
&gt;&quot;Vanagon Lenti Company&quot; which has a lot of locations around the
&gt;country?). 
&gt;

Perhaps I could help with this.  Because of my part-time VW bus 
parts &amp; campers business/aka hobby out of control, I do have 
accounts with a couple of wholesale parts distributors - mainly to 
get tune up parts, Bentleys, etc.  I imagine I could set up an 
account with this distributor as well.  My main interest is 
air-cooled busses, so I doubt that I would be ordering much from 
them myself, but if list members were to accumulate enough orders 
to make this company's minimum order requirement (apparantly $1000, 
at least initially), I could order from them and then re-ship to 
the appropriate list members.  The only negative is that you would 
have to pay shipping twice - once to me, then from me to you. (I'm 
sure that they would not drop-ship one order to multiple 
addresses.)  

Derek, do you have a phone number for this outfit?  I will get more 
info on setting up an account, and let you all know if we can do 
this.  It won't cost anything to look into it, but then we'll have 
to see if there is enough real interest on the part of various list 
members (read: laying down the cash) to make the minimum opening 
order.
