Subject: Westy Awning attachement 87' gl

Hello,

I am a Thule roof rack dealer and they have a new awning out which seems
pretty cool.  Since I can buy it cheap I'm thinking about it for my Westy.
 Here's the rub.  It's made to fit on Thule bars.  I need to attach it to the
rain gutters since I can't attach it to the bars with the pop top up.  My
question, how does the bracket attach to the Norseman and other awnings which
secure to the rain gutter.  I'm thinking I could use just the Norseman
bracket though I've never seen one.

By the way, Thules new &quot;Super High Feet&quot; clear the top of the Westy and
attach to the raingutters!

Any thoughts appreciated or sources appreciated
