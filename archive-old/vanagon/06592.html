&gt;BTW You would think with all the VW goings on (Buses at the Rock,
&gt;Buses by the Bay, Buses in the Bay) on the New England etc. region
&gt;that they'd have more buses on this list.  Well at least from what
&gt;I used to read in the LIMBO newsletter.  I guess they like VW buses
&gt;but aren't too keen on computers.  ;)

i think you have to remember that this bunch is the result of a strange
sequence of circumstances ... not the least of which is that we all have
access to computers AND the internet. i'm sure there are lots and lots of
other buses out there, but many of them do NOT have computer access, OR
simply don't know about the list. hell, there are lots of folks with vw's
who don't even know about the vw magazines!

Remember!  Information is like Fertilizer!
           (it works better if you spread it around). ;)
