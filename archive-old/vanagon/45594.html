&gt; &gt; I ordered some small parts from them last Monday.  Jim was helpful.  Said

&gt; &gt; want to BUY something the guys at Bus Boys are responsive and provide good
&gt; &gt; service.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;  BS, I have bought from them, only about $60 of stuff thus far and 
actually
 was slightly taken, Jim claimed his wonderful poly CV boots better than 
anybody.
 Charged me 9.99 as I did not want the grease, ended up the same parts I 
get
 local for 9.99 with grease and clamps or 7.99 with only boot, I mean 
EXACT same
 part, made by HWI or something like that.  I am about to order quite a 
bit
 of Bus related stuff for either the '78 or for an '81 Westy.  I'm 
rebuilding
 an engine and whatever I need along the way acessory wise, I mean about
 $500 or so.  I asked Bus Boys for a catalog 1+ years ago, again when I 
ordered the
 boots, months ago, again 2 months ago when he started following the 
list again.
 
 STIL NO CATALOG.  RMMW, had me a catalog within 2 weeks of when I 
emailed
 a request to them, I like that kind of service.
 
 Now Jim has been rather helpful on this list and keeps his &quot;plugging&quot; 
of
 his products to a reasonable level but shit, I mean they had better get
 their act together and send out some darn photocopied flier catalogs at
 least.
 
 My opinions as usual.
