Subject: '85 weekender...won't start warm..thanks all

Thank you to all who responding to my request last weekend for the
problem with my '85 not restarting when warm.

    It looks like the problem was a loose or dirty conection at the 
thermostat to the Digijet computer brain.

    We have had the van only 3 weeks now.  We were planning to but a 
new Ford windstar, but this van was soo much cheaper.  And now this fix 
was free, instead of getting towed to the VW dealer for diagnostics.
I'm in heaven.

thanks again,

dave
