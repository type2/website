Save your money ordering the SA engine. Take a local AUDI 5 Cyl.
It's same engine and fit all the SA mountings.

The tranny is built by Styr-Daimler-Puch in Austria. In Germany
the whole box will cost DM 2400.- but you will need the Syncro
CV boots on tranny side. It is possible to add this tranny to
the 2.1 waterboxer if you will swap the bellhousing. But the
gear ratios are different to meet the 100 kW engine and a top
speed of 162 km/h.

To those who've gone before. Is it feasible to add the
S.African 5 spd tranny and what the heck, the 2.6i motor as well. I
found the retail price of the(whole enchilada) 2.6i Caravelle is
130,666(s.african$)
 My question is mainly- has anyone ordered the tranny and engine
from S.Africa, how much was it? and any shipping particulars.
Any relevant leads appreciated,
Jay
