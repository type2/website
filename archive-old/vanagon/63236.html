&lt;&lt; I'm in the same boat with the missing back bumper, where can you get a new

lotta people sell aftermarket oem style chrome vanagon bumpers now.
they're brazillian made, but look like oem, and cost hundreds less.
check the regular vw parts suppliers...
i could list them, but it would take awhile, and they should be archived)
