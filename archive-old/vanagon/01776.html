&gt; On the subject of fuel filler nozzles, my local (and regular)
&gt; gas station hasjust changed thier pumps to fufill Virginias
&gt; new fuel vapor legislation. They replaces the hoses with some type
&gt; of big, clunky nozzle with some type of plastic barrier around the
&gt; pipe.This works fine on cars with unleaded-only filler holes. But
&gt; my '71 does not have said restriction, you could prob. get a tennis
&gt; ball down the tube with some shoving. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, to use these 'better' nozzles, I have to lean (hard) on the nozzle, 
&gt; just to get the tip of it to extend far enough to aim into my tank.
&gt; With a 16 gallon tank, and the anemic pumps, I have to lean on it for 4.5
&gt; minutes. This is tiring, and does me no good. Those new nozzles suck
&gt; (gas fumes), and blow (gas all over my car.)

Hah.  Consider yourself lucky.  We in California have had to suffer with
those for, oh, about the last 15 years.  I remember what it was like in the
old days everytime I drive out of state.  Come to think of it, paying for
gas *after* you pump it is a luxury I had almost forgotten about as well...
Sorry, but you will get no sympathy from us Californians...  :)
