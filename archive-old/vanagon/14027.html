Hi Rachel.  I have a '71 campmobile.  There are about 18 or so us on 
the list.  As far as tools go:  a compression tester is going to cost 
you about $30.  Get the one that has the release valve so you can do 
the test yourself.  A tach/dwell meter would be about the same price. 
I bought them both at Sears.  A torque wrench will cost anywhere from 
$30 to $90 at Sears.  It depends upon how fancy you want to get.  At 
the lower end you get the old bar type which will work fine.  Closer 
to the upper end you will get the release type that clicks when you 
hit the dialed in torque.  As to the wrenches, go to Sears and get the
Craftsman type.  They have a 100 piece all metric set that has sockets
and a few combination wrenches for $100.  That is a nice start and the
cheapest in the end.  The best advice about the school is to get the 
Muir book and read it.  Then get a Bentley manual.  Between the two of
them and this list you will be able to do just about anything.  On the
other hand, you could go to a VW dealership and see where they send 
their mechanics.  Good luck.  Jim
