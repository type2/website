&quot;Utilitarian and Ugly Vehicles&quot;

This is a page of links to vehicles that are utilitarian or ugly.=20

In this list, utilitarian means that the vehicle is ugly because function
was the primary design goal, with =E6sthetics falling by the
wayside. Military and farm vehicles are the main contenders for this=
 category.=20

Ugly applies to vehicles that imitate the form, but not the function, of
utilitarian vehicles. The VW Type 181 (also known as the
Thing) is the best example of this category. It is a clear descendant of a
German WWII military vehicle, the Type 82
Kubelwagen, but has none of the functions associated with off-road or
military use. Well, it does take over 20 seconds to get
from 0 to 60mph (40+ seconds for 0-70), and the interior noise level is 90dB
at 70mph, so it's in the Hummer league in at least
two categories.=20

Lima-bean shaped vehicles need not apply. For this list, the more angular
and the more flat panels of sheet metal used, the
better.=20
