Subject: Re: '84 Westy Pop-Top Tent Screen Replacement

Hi Tom.  Our friend's '88 had the same problem.  They cut out the 
original screen, and unpicked all the stitching that held it in 
place.  They bought some new &quot;no-see-em&quot; netting and stitched it back 
in place by hand.  It was tedious, painstaking work, but it looked 
great when they finished.  It cost just a few $$$ in materials.  The 
&quot;no-see-em&quot; netting is available through tent/outdoor outfitters, and 
is more flexible than the original VW plastic netting that cracks in 
the cold.

Hope this helps,
Harry.


&gt; Has anyone had any experience replacing the screen on the front of the
&gt; Westy tent? It is the horizontal white plastic piece which has a zipper
