]So far it seems like fty_at_vislab.epa_dot_gov and macklow_at_sybase_dot_com have expressed
]interest on collaborating on getting some shop to do the 2.5 litre
]conversions. Anybody else? Perhaps if we got 10 people together to contribute
]a $15 research fee, we could hire a top quality shop to research the thing
]down to the part numbers (OKRASA) and give us a bid.

I'm nowhere near doing this (I still have a 1.9), but would be willing to
contribute the $15 just to get the data available for the future.

]The reliability of the Oettinger 6s is probably the same as our current motor
]minus 15% or something. These motors are said to be identica l to our current
]2.1 litre motors except for the addition of the extra two cylinders.
]Oettinger told me they have no special data on their engines as the engines
]are identical with what we have already.
]
]I think the 6 has 3.2 litres.

I'm still amazed that VW never did this on a production basis.  I'd mort-
gage the wife and kids for a production Vanagon 6.

]I think it was about $8,000 complete to get a 2.5 litre motor.

Ouch!

]I think it was about $20,000 to get the 3.2 litre motor.

[faints]

]Now I think I will go get a fire truck to put out the flames as you 
]guys blast me for tempting you with this stuff.

Where's my flamethrower?  I know I left it around here somewhere....
