Subject: RE: Replace Clutch?


&gt;I will certainly replace the clutch if needed so what do I look for to tell 
if
&gt;it is needed or not.


There are two &quot;normal&quot; places to check for wear in a VW clutch. One is
visual and easy. The clutch disc is manufactured with small radial
grooves in the wear material, making it easy to spot wear there. I
don't know exactly how thick yours is, and how deep your grooves should
be. But if you go to a VFLAPS (*Very* friendly local etc.) and look
at a brand new one, you will see whatever differences there are to be
seen.

The other is a little more difficult to gauge. The Pressure plate has
strong springs inside, that press the pressure plate against the clutch
disc, holding it against the flywheel. When you step on the clutch pedal,
it presses on the small, shiny ring and retracts those springs, lifting
the pressure plate off the disc and letting the disc spin at different
speeds from the engine.

Put the pressure plate down on a piece of plywood on your garage floor,
and step on the small shiny disk in the center (the one that faced away
from the engine when it was installed). If you put a LOT of weight on it,
like 150 pounds or more, you should feel it go down as those springs flex.
If it's old and getting weak, it will be easier to press down.

Again, difficult to gauge exactly how much is &quot;enough&quot;. While at that
same VFLAPS, step on a brand-new one to compare. If, of course, the
proprietor doesn't mind your stomping on a brand-new, expensive item.

Even if you feel a difference in the amount of pressure it takes to
flex the springs, it's hard to say how much difference it takes to
make a decision. Personally, I say that if you feel ANY difference,
or see any noticable wear in the disc, then go ahead and replace the
entire clutch: Pressure plate, disc, throwout bearing, and pilot bearing.
And take off the flywheel and bring it to a machine shop for resurfacing--
your new clutch will be smooth as silk if you do this. If you don't, it
may chatter whenever you let up the clutch pedal, announcing to all the
world that you're a lazy cheapskate (resurfacing costs around $25 here).

When a shop replaces your clutch, most of their charges are for labor
in removing and replacing the engine. Since you already have your engine
out, do yourself a favor and replace the clutch-- one less thing to
worry about for the next 40,000+ miles IMHO.

I replaced the V6anagon's clutch twice here :-(  and was able to get
all four parts for $115 each time-- Sachs brand, good German parts.
Despite the oddball engine, it still takes a stock '80 Vanagon clutch.
Don't know if your clutch is identical to an '80 or not, but call around
a LOT before you buy-- prices vary incredibly. I found a range of $115
to over $300 for the exact same (German) parts.

I got my parts from World Parts Depot, (619) 275-4240.

Hope this helps.
