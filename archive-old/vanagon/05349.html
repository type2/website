Subject: Re: Originator Names

 
&gt;&gt; It is my understanding that it is a function of your OWN system's
&gt;&gt; particular mail (reading) program as to whether you receive your
&gt;&gt; vanagon mail showing the list or the original sender as sender.
&gt;&gt; I used to receive my vanagon mail at another address, where it
&gt;&gt; was always shown via original sender.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;On my little system, if the From: field contains only the person's
&gt;email address, and not their name, then I get the sender as 
&gt;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu. 
&gt;
&gt;Thus Derek Drew's comments are always from vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu,
&gt;and Joel's show up as from &quot;Joel Walker&quot;.

I use PC Eudora and it shows the sender (vanagon), The originator (vanagon 
again), the return path (vanagon), who the message is from (name and 
address), and who it is to (the list). All this info must be available, it 
just depends on your particular mail reader which of it is shown.
