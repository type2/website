&lt;&lt; I just can't wait until I get the '81 sunroof with a/c and gas heater
 running before I ask this question :-)
 
 Any opinions on the gas heater versus the stock heat on a wasserboxer?
 
 Any advice/suggestions on using the gas heater?
 
 I won't be able to keep both the '81 and the '83 wasserboxer (no room at
 the inn, and the stable is already too crowded with guys in robes and
 such), so I'm curious of any opinions. BTW, there will be a seperate post
 concerning the mechanical aspects of the '81 vs. the '83.5. &gt;&gt;

When working properly, the gas heaters are awsome.  The aircooled vanagon
will have less power, poorer fuel economy and worse reliability than the
waterboxer.  Do not plan on using the AC for any lenght of time on long trips
or at high speeds.  Heasd melt to easy and blocks like to warp.  Unless you
feel you really need the sunroof, keep the 83.  Maybe you should look for a
waterboxer with sunroof.  I had an 84 and I loved it.
