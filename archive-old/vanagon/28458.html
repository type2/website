Subject: More Hoover pics on the web!
Date: Wed, 8 Nov 1995 23:59:51 -0800 (PST)


Volks,
	Tonight I took some time and converted the line-art scans of Bob's
drawings into GIF format so they will be viewable on the web.  I also
lightened the picture of Bob that he &quot;blessed&quot; for publication (you can
see his face now).  The drawings are really good - I recommend that
everyone take a peek at them.  The stuff is at:

Enjoy!  (more, much more is on the way, too!)

-David
