&gt;Hi all:
&gt;
&gt;Last March I posted about Bud's Bugs, a VW-only wreaking yard in Concord,
&gt;CA, that was having a &quot;$20 Sale.&quot;  I offered to find and ship parts while
&gt;the sale was on, and several people got some parts they were needing.
&gt;
&gt;I wandered back into Bud's Bugs today, and they're having their &quot;$20
&gt;Sale&quot; again; their flyer for the sale says &quot;$20 For-Just-About-Anything
&gt;In-The-Yard SALE.  (excludes complete engines, cars and 1985 and newer
&gt;parts.)&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Unlike last time, I'm not going back out that way anytime soon (didn't
&gt;find anything I need) but I was told they have a web site
&gt;(www.budsbugs_dot_com) so you can email them with any requests.  (I was also
&gt;told they will ship smaller parts UPS.)
&gt;
&gt;They didn't seem to have a ton of Bus and Vanagon stuff, but they had
&gt;some, including what looked to be a complete '71 camper with pop-top, so
&gt;you might get lucky.
&gt;
&gt;Usual disclaimers: I have no association, affiliation, relationship,
&gt;kinship, or any other sort of tie-in to Bud's Bugs; I've bought stuff
&gt;there a few times and that's it.  Maybe if you mention my name in your
&gt;emails I can get a parts discount!!! :-)
&gt;
&gt;(I'm guessing that the $20 price is also limited to a &quot;you pull-it&quot;
&gt;situation, but who knows?)

I've been to Bud's Bugs a number of times, and they are pretty nice. I was
just there two weeks ago and they only had about 4 Vanagons, all
air-cooled. I've never seen a Wasserboxer in their yard.

Worth checking out IMHO.
