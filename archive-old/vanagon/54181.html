&gt; Hello from frozen Montana,
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased an Olympian 6100a catalytic heater yesterday.  I installed it in
&gt; my Westy, but I'm dissatisfied with it's performance.
&gt; 
&gt; To install the heater, I placed a flared t at junction where the gas was
&gt; coupled to my stove unit.  Part of the t included a swivel type extender.
&gt; B/c of the swivel the connection dropped from a 3/8 to 1/4 for that
&gt; particular fitting.  From the T, I ran 6ft. of 3/8 inch flexible hose that I
&gt; had the local propane co. fabricate.    Approximate length of the hose is 6
&gt; feet.  The install was extremely easy.
&gt; HOWEVER, I'm still cold.  .
&gt; 
&gt; The owner heater manual says &quot;the heater is designed to operate with a
&gt; manifold pressure(the gas pressure down stream from the appliance controls)
&gt; of 10.5&quot; w.c.(0.38 psig). A gas supply pressure of 11&quot; w.c. (0.40 psig)
&gt; minimum is required at the heater controls.  The supply line must be
&gt; equipped at the cylinder with a listed regulator set to deliver the
&gt; specified pressure.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Questions.
&gt; Is the regulator on my bus the proper size regulator?  1980 VW vanagon Westy
&gt; 
&gt;   Is the swivel fitting that reduces the t from 3/8 to 1/4 causing a loss in
&gt; pressure?

Not significantly at low flow rates. 

&gt; 
&gt; The heater has a maximum output of 5,800 BTU/hr.  Is this adequate for
&gt; heating the interior of the bus?

With about 3.4 B.T.U. per watt, your 5,800 BTU/hr is equivalent to 1700
watts. The propex heater 1600 produces 5,200 BTU/hr or about 1500 watts.
A base board heater is usually 1500 watts. All are good and warm so you
should be toasty.
&gt; 
&gt; Any and all info would be beneficial....thanks for the time...
