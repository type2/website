Subject: Re: Bus Boys Stole From me Saga...

If I read Ron's original post correctly, it sounds as though
BB ran a charge slip through the system, which, if I had to
guess, means Ron will be receiving his non-ordered parts any
day now (assuming the backordered parts came in and BB shipped
them...).  

Of course, the way this saga's going, BB probably shipped the
parts (that is, *if* they shipped the parts) via UPS...  :O

BTW, that 800 # probably only works for the state of CA.
