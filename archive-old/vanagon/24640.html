Subject: re:Being screwed by the parts place

If you paid by credit card you can write a letter explaining the situation

 &gt;&gt;you too, huh?  they still owe me $160, and they've had my parts back for

 &gt;Local newspapers, and local television news agencies love this sort of

 &gt;a particular company.  Just a thought to help pass the time.
