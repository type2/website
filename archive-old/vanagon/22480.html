&gt; What's a synchro vs. a non-synchro VW? Does this apply only to vans?

&gt; (Ahhh!  [...dodging bullets now...[)

a synchro has a drive shaft and some other stuff that power the front
wheels when the back ones slip (on a '86+VanagonSynchro)
This is not a van only option, as I have seen PasssatTouring synchros and
a guy _at_school has a synchro quantum.
