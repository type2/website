Subject: Re:  Skylight Bug Screen

I did find the glue I used.  It is produced by Velcro (tm) themselves.  I
would rate its adhesion to the metal around the skylight to be fair.
Removing the velcroed screen does not rip off the part attached to the roof,
but it does loosen it.  It's a 'push harder' ;) type of glue.  Jim McCarthy

&gt;&gt;Speaking of this... what *is* the glue-of-choice for getting the Velcro
&gt;&gt;(tm) strip to stick to the roof???
