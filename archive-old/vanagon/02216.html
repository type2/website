Joel!  Your gas study is incredible.  Now 'fess up... do you:

alphabetize your tool belt?
categorize your fish bait in the tackle box?
have everything neatly and perfectly folded in your dresser drawers?
saw knot-holes out of scrap wood, because you &quot;can't stand the
     idea of them 'staring' up at you?&quot;
refuse to use pushpins unless they are all the same color?
keep your dusbuster in a cozy when it's not being used to
     vacumn up crumbs while you eat?

;)
