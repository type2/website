Subject: Waterpump Brands?

Probably a well worn topic but...

what's the consensus on relative quality of waterpumps vs. manufacturer or
country of origin?

for example, i've got a spare &quot;just in case&quot; in my kit for road trips.
it's a GRAF brand made in Italy  and written all over auf Deutsch -- paid
US$46.  Worked the clerk pretty hard to find it :-) was in the database but
had been stocked in a bogus location.

other choice at the time was Beck Arnley (made in USA) for US$106.

thanks much,
dwight

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hello All,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I have a noise from my 1986 Vanagon engine compartment.  Upon further
&gt;&gt; investigation I find that the waterpump bearing has a lot of play and is
&gt;&gt; getting ready to let go.  Does anyone care to venture a guess at what this
&gt;&gt; job could cost. I wonder if I can do it myself.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Any ideas will be welcomed
&gt;&gt; &gt;

&gt;I recently had my water pump replaced for about $300 (parts + labor) here
&gt;in Portland, OR.  This pump lasted only 25K miles.  Also, the old pump was
&gt;leaking antifreeze.
