Subject: More on Engine Transplants

     OK, here is some  more data on the bigger
     diesels manufactured by VW/Audi, courtesy of
     our buddies on the Quattro List:


     The 2.0 liter 5cyl: 1986cc, 5 cylinders
     '79-'81 non-turbo - 67HP _at_ 4800, 86.4 ft.lbs _at_ 3000
     '82-'83 turbo - 84 HP _at_ 4500, 127 ft.lbs _at_ 2800

     The 2.4 liter 6cyl: Turns out this is what they sold to
     Volvo. Turbodiesel, 108HP. VWD24T, used in mid 80's. Those
     of you worrying about adequate clearance, (up) can now think about
     adequate clearance, (back)!


     I am having a hard time accessing the Gpher archives, but if
     someone got in a did a search on Audi or 5 cyl or the like, they
     would get (besides every message I've sent with Audi in the signature,
     so that was a bad idea) the messages on the 5 in SA, or maybe it
     was NZ or Australia - someplace very south. I am also having a
     hard time with message bounces, so if you see a bounce, send it again.
     Our number of incoming ports will grow from 258 to 2000 within 30
     days, meanwhile, I don't know what I am missing....
