Subject: Heat Riser Holes

Yet another question,

My neighbor just gave me a never used exhaust system! Two perfect heat
exchangers, extactor and duel muffler. My system is rusted to hell.

My question is: do I drill out the extractor where it connects to the
manifold heat riser tubes, or is it supposed to be blocked? I can't imagine
how it could work without drilling a hole for some hot exhaust gas to warm
the manifold.

Thanks,
Ken
