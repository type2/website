Subject: Re: oil level question

Hi all,

Jared's question on oil level and subsequent responses has made me
wonder about my experience with oil levels in my '74 1800 camper.
I have found that the oil level will be lower when the engine is 
cold. Before I was aware of this (and how I found out), I added some 
oil while the engine was cold, bringing the level from just below 
the bottom dipstick mark, up to the top mark.  I checked the oil
again after driving a while, with the engine up to temperature, and 
found the level had risen to about 5mm above the top mark. Fearing
that an oil seal will be blown, I now keep the oil level at the 
top mark, measured when the engine is warm.

I am curious as to whether this is normal or indicative of a problem 
with the oil system.  

Regards
