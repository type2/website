Subject:      Website Relocation

OK kids, thanks to a lot of help from Marc Edwards, our substitute Type 2
list Administrator, this past week, I have relocated our website to our
brand new domain on azaccess_dot_com's server in Flagstaff:

http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/

Please change or make a new bookmark to the site.  I am uploading a bunch
of catalog listings later in the week to debut the on-line catalog.  The
old site will still be up and running as well through the end of this
week.

I was very surprised that the oldvolkshome domain name had not been
spoken for.  It was my first choice of course.
