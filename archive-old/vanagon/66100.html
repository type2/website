Subject:      U.P. Michigan VW Shop/fall colors

     List members:

     Was in the upper peninsula of Michigan this weekend and stoped by the
     European Car Shop in Ironwood, MI.  This shop has a whole aray of
     VW's.  I saw a 63 bus in good condition to a 96 Passat wagon.  There
     are _at_ 100 VW's on the lot.  If you ever get in this neck of the woods
     stop in.  The phone number is (906)932-5720.

     Fall colors were fantastic.  Excellent colors from Hayward, WI north
     to Lake Superior.  List members in the mid-west should plan a trip
     this weekend (3Oct-6Oct 97).
