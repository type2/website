Subject: Weber Carb Power Valve

Dear list,

I have a 1974 Westy with a 1.7 liter engine that has been converted 
to a single Webber carb(Stock 32/36 DFAV).  The carb. is only about a year old, but I 
am begining to suspect it as the cause of my problem. When I 
accelerate there is a bad hesitation until the rpm's get around 2500. 
If I accelerate hard the hesitation is like a bog, but if I 
accelerate slowly the hesistation is more of a jumpy acceleration.  I 
went out and took the air cleaner off the carb and looked down the 
barrel with a flashlight.  The accelerator pump is working properly, 
but at around 2000rpm's gas begins to drip from the primary venturi.  
Should there be any drip at all? Could this be a problem with the 
power valve? Could the vacuum that holds the spring mechanism off the 
power valve possibly be too low? I just got the Westy back from the 
shop where it had a complete tune up, the mechanic said I needed to 
rebuild the carb. It is hard for me to believe that I would have to 
rebuild a one year old Webber.  Any other suggestions would be 
appreciated.

Thanks
