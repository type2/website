Mark,
I think this must be a fairly common problem.  Mine did the same thing about 3
years (80K miles) ago.  If your problem is in fact the same as mine- I used a
wide (3/4&quot;) wire harness zip strap (I'm sure there is a name for these) around
the speedo housing just over where the axle for the odometer gears, etc. comes
out of the assembly -where you said it slipped out. It has worked fine ever
since.
