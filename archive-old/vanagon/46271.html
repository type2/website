&gt;Subject: '72 Westie engine teardown
&gt;X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
&gt;X-Info: SISNA
&gt;
&gt;I bought a '72 Westie for restoration a week ago and the itch was too much to 
&gt;resist.  I had it towed (ran only 'kinda&quot;) into my garage and there it sits, 
&gt;calling my name. So I go out this morning saying to myself, &quot;just pull the 
&gt;engine&quot;.   Well I pulled the engine in about 30 minutes and there it sits at my 
&gt;feet.  From looking at the outside it is obvious something nasty has happened.  
&gt;The poor 1600 has been cooked.  The fried oil is all over the place.  The spark 
&gt;plug hole covers are  curled up and hard as a rock.  Well I'll just pull some of
&gt;the external stuff.  Carb comes out, distributor, intake manifold, generator and
&gt;fan, support stand, fan shrouding, exhaust manifolds (damn), muffler (damn). 
&gt;	Since I went though all this work I may as well pull the rest of the tin off.  
&gt;The worst of all was the top shroud over the cylinders where the slot screws are
&gt;set into the top of the head.  I broke two heads off and mucked the slot up so 
&gt;bad on the other two Mr. Hacksaw had to finish the job (damn).  Well since the 
&gt;tin is off I may as well pull the heads.  Right away I find some more nasty 
&gt;stuff.  Oil is cooked on to the lower third of the push rods so hard it looks 
&gt;like asphalt.  I think that might be bad.  I pull the heads and they actually 
&gt;don't look too bad, #3 looks a little pitted.
&gt;	Well since I'm this far, pull the cylinders.  I can still see the cross hatch 
&gt;honing pattern on the walls.  I can also see some light scoring on #4.  I see 
&gt;some more serious scoring on #1.  I look at the piston and the rings are seized 
&gt;in their grooves and how.  All three are flush with the side of the piston.  
&gt;That must be bad too.
&gt;	About this time the wife peeks over the fence in back and starts in on me.  &quot;I 
&gt;knew you couldn't leave that thing alone.  I knew you were going to tear it 
&gt;apart.&quot;  The problem is I can't tell if she's pissed or not (damn).  About then 
&gt;my neighbor shows up, shaking his head at my scene.  Makes a few references to 
&gt;&quot;pieces of junk&quot; and then informs me that I probably wouldn't get as dirty if I 
&gt;washed off the engine first.  Oh yeah?  This from a guy that rebuilds Triumphs.
&gt;	So now I have a torn down engine in the back of my Westie and I will probably 
&gt;get the head exchanged or rebuilt and then proceed as the bread allows (not to 
&gt;mention Mrs.).  I know there are a few readers in the Twin Cities area.  I would
&gt;like to know where they get their machining and the like done.  I checked out 
&gt;Dune Buggy Supply and they seemed reasonable if not a little busy.  They also 
&gt;had a cool collection of bones out back that got me thinking (that's bad).  
&gt;Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.
&gt;
