Sometimes looking for one of our beloved vehicles becomes kind of like a 
treasure hunt.  The stories of these searches are fun to read, like the 
recent finds of Martha and her Acupulco 181, and Dave and his &quot;two in a barn 
for two hundred&quot;.

My story isn't quite as exciting, but about a month ago I was kind of 
looking for a vehicle with better gas mileage, like a rabbit diesel or (even 
better) a rabbit diesel pickup.  I happened to ask a guy at church if he had 
seen any vw pickups around (this guy is really good at finding stuff - very 
excellent garage sale searcher), and he said yes, he knew of a '68 crew cab 
for sale.  Obviously, this is not what I'm looking for - they don't get much 
better gas mileage than a bus, but I'm intrigued.  Actually, I struggled 
with this, since I don't need another car, especially a project, and my wife 
thinks we need a house (she's right), and, and, and...but a crew cab pickup!
Long story short, last saturday I finally drove almost 3 hours to see it.  
The poor thing - it's sitting under an open barn, been there for three 
years, engine is dead, transmission jumps out of 4th, some rust in floors 
and rockers, front bumper mangled and the nose a little mushed from an 
encounter with a trailer - but the interior is really pretty decent.  The 
bed is in good shape, the sides all there, the pieces are all there, 
including a clock, radio and luggage rack - like the ones for the buses, but 
shorter for only the crew cab length (he said he really had trouble finding 
one years ago).

I bought it.

I must be crazy.
