Subject: Re: Camping heater for an '86 Westy?

My heater is installed in a shallow formica covered cabinet I built. Its 
about 4 inches deep, 16 inches wide and 34 inches tall. It's installed 
behind the right passenger seat, attached to the vertical panel below the 
seat. The heater faces backward. The seat can still recline fully, even 
when all the way back, and it can swivel, but leg room when swiveled is 
tight. The heater vents left (inside the cabinet) down, and out through 
the vertical panel, out the wheel well. No vent hose is visible.

With any radiant heater, it's important to place the heater where it will 
direct the long-wave infrared radiation towards the occupants. That way, 
it's not necessary to heat all the air to any given temerature to &quot;feel&quot; 
warm.

The propane comes from the already installed tank of the left side. A new 
tee attaches to a new 3/8 inch line which goes over the gas tank to the 
right side.
