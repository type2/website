Subject: Re: A winter VW question /f

&gt;Didn't Pink Floyd write a song about us EuroVan drivers called
&gt;&quot;Comfortably Warm&quot;?

        No, no, no. It was &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, and it was referring to the
state of your checkbook after purchase of said vehicle...   :-0  (got my
breadloaf from the impound yard for $150... true. 'course the PO was a
dipsh*t, but that's another story)

Peace,
