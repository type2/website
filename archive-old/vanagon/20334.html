Subject: Electric Window Switch


Hey, does anybody know how much an electric window switch costs? 
Something is wrong with the drivers side one in my Dad's '91 Carat. It got 
hit really hard and now doesn't &quot;rock&quot; anymore. I tried taking it apart, but 
nothing seemed to fix it.

Anybody got any spare ones laying around?
