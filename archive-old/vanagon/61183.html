Subject: camping in August

Its not $20 if go thru at nite when there are no rangers in the entrance
stations!  Jeez, i would expect all you 'campers' to have a golden eagle
pass...$50 bucks gets you in free to every NP for a year...ok, so they
almost trippled the price this year, but its still worth it if you use
it every weekend!

peace,

jg
