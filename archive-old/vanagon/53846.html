Subject: 83 Westy cross-over pipe

I have an air-cooled 83 Westy and it needed an exhaust pipe. It took several
weeks of telephone calls, e-mail, etc. to find out it was a cross-over pipe
and not a collector pipe. Then weeks of trying to locate one. I found one,
used, in Ca for $397.00! Then someone on the list gave me Ca Imports in Wa.
Sandra was very helpful in seeing I got the right pipe and it was $250 NEW.
Everyone told me it was no longer available at the dealer or anywhere. I
guess it goes to show that it pays to not give up. I was told that these
pipes were being made in Denmark. But later was informed that they were
actually made in the state of Washington. So, for those of you out there who
need a cross-over pipe for your Westy, call Sandra or Tim at 1-800-313-3811.
