&gt;Which of the extractor exhaust systems are the most sturdy?  I've been
&gt;told that there are two manufacturers: S&amp;S and Thunderbird.
&gt;If so, which of these is marketed by BugPack, Empi, Rocky Mtn Mtrwrks,
&gt;etc.?
Both S&amp;S and Thunderbird build good, quality exhaust systems and both of them
build right here in USA (So Cal).  BugPack &amp; RMMW have their systems mfr'd
overseas (Mexico &amp; Taiwan).  EMPI has all of their exhausts made in Taiwan as
well.  BugPack's and RMMW's quality is spotty depending on the product (some
of their stuff is made by Pacesetter - creator of the Monza Exhaust Systems
to compete with Italy's Ansa).  I have been using EMPI's systems for quite
some time now on various bugs &amp; buses I've owned (I've only had to return one
system because of a mismarked/misboxed mistake).  On my 67 21 Wdw Bus I have
an EMPI single quiet I've been running for over 4 years.  A little surface
rust, but that's expected and it's taken care of regularly.  Before that, I
was running a Thunderbird single quiet for over 7 years.  These guys build
their systems real tough, but their tailpipe(s) are positioned for a bug,
thus potentially causing the &quot;black bumper/rear corner syndrome&quot;.  So I
heated the tailpipe and repositioned it to prevent that.  Why don't BugPack,
RMMW and EMPI carry S&amp;S or T-Bird?  Well, they're not cheap to build in USA
and the mark-down/mark-up is poor when buying and reselling their product.
 So the big guys go outa the country to achieve a better mark-up, but
sometimes the quality suffers.  I thoroughly check each and every exhaust
from EMPI, BugPack and even S&amp;S for potential weld defects before they go out
the door because most of 'em are headed back east across the country to
replace a customer's rusted-out system.  I highly recommend having the
exhaust header system &quot;aluminized coated&quot; or some other high heat coating to
resist the inevitable rusting. EMPI Dual Quiet for early Type 2 1600 is
$89.95 + freight (Oversized).
