Subject: Re: Looking '72 Westy popup canvas

I once had a Pop-up tent for a 76 Westy made by an awning company.  This was
when I lived in El Paso.  They just looked at the old one, which was still
attached, and made me one.  It had the netting, zippers, and all.  The color
was even the same.  Got it for a decent price too.  You might try an awning
company.

&gt;Hey,
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know where I can find the canvas tent for my pop-up on my 
&gt;Westy? Im just kinda lookin' now, (due to the fact that im broke). I 
&gt;live in Utah and finding VW Transporter parts is like finding camels 
&gt;in the ocean.

&gt;Thanx.
