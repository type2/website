&gt; Ya know, as I lay snugly in my bed last night, two things just could not 
&gt; escape my mind:  My bus, and the fact that whatever great philosopher

It was Descartes...
Which brings up an interesting story.
As an elderly gentleman, Descartes was taking cruise down the Atlantic
coast south of France.
The stewardess on the ship asked him if he would care for a drink.
Descartes replied &quot; I think not&quot;  and promptly vanished.
