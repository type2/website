Subject:      Re: Window Trick Works!

For those of you who try this trick, I believe it only works on when the
brights are applied.   If when you turn off your headlights they are in
the low beam position and your turn on the lights with the ignition off
and pull the &quot;flasher&quot; switch and hold, the window switch will work.
However, if the headlights were in the bright position or if you have
&quot;flashed&quot; your lights once, then the flasher will be in the low beam
position and the window trick will not work until the flasher is in the
high beam position.

 Does this description make any sense to anyone but me????

Incidentally, as I found out, it won't work at all with hand crank
windows!!!
