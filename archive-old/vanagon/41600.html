Subject: re:Type IV timing mark part # &amp; $

I recently bought the plastic timing mark piece for an '81 Vanagon (2.0
liter air cooled) from Camelback VW, 1499 E. Camelback Rd. Phoenix, AZ.
(602) 265-6600.  VWOA Part #  021-119-249E
Regular  listed  price quoted at $4.06 (US). &lt;w/o asking about discounts.&gt;
It was confirmed that the same piece is used on all 2.0's.

&gt;called &quot;ignition timing scale&quot; or something really close to that.  Chances
&gt;are the dealer wont have them in stock, but can get them
