Subject: Re: Vans in europe?

&gt;&gt;With all this talk about used vans no longer being cheap in
&gt;&gt;Europe....I wonder if it would be worth while, if one were to
&gt;&gt;be in Europe on an extended trip (more than a month...) to ship
&gt;&gt;one's own camper/van from the US to Europe, and then ship it back
&gt;&gt;when the trip was over.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what it costs to ship cars back and forth?
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I know it's been done. I believe Tim Smith did it some time ago. I believe
&gt;he rented a container (and some very strong bungee cords).
&gt;
Yes did it, a non-poptop '75 Westy, from Halifax, Nova Scotia to LeHavre, 
France. Based on cubic meters of the vehicle, from the maximum dimensions. 
Cost me around $600 in 1983, gotta be way more now.  I wouldn't do it again. 
 I'd buy and resell, try in London UK or Amsterdam, NL. It was ro/ro, 
roll-on/roll-off, just leave your keys in the car and park it on the dock 
over there, yeah anywhere, don't worry, it'll be fine.......  It got there, 
after a 2 week visit to Gottenburg Sweden without me!  Dented, rusted, 
muffler flattened, gas heater flattened. 

        I came out ahead, as I sued the shipping co. and got back their 
costs, then sold the van 6 mos. later in London for more than I had paid for 
it, in English pounds!! A tidy sum to take home.

        Go prepared to hang out, shop slowly, etc. This wouldn't work with 
todays family/time limits etc. Shipping a van over gets you a known entity 
over there, with exhaust systems and fuel systems that are unknown in 
Europe, parts from factory only, minimal junkyarding, can you say 'starter 
motor please' in German/Dutch/Spanish/Arabic? Buying there cheaply, with a 
thorough DIY inspection, say in Holland and selling in London _used_ to be 
the way to keep your money up. Then have a major binge in London after 
buying the return ticket! Whee.  Tim Smith


HEY FOLKS:  We have enough list members to pull off a group purchase of a 
decent Westy and keep it garaged near London/Amsterdam for our use. C'mon, 
time share a Westy in Europe, say $100/week initial investment, ie. $5200 
ought to buy a damned nice vehicle, your second+ years cost would be towards 
maintenance, based on previous years mileage you used and extent of repairs 
as normally required. $300 for 3 weeks unlimited driving/camping in Europe, 
and less the next year(s).......
