Subject: Pro-Tech?  So-Cal Imports?  Transform?

From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


Here are yet more companies that might have what I need.  Does anyone
have any experiences with:

- Pro-Tech, in Riverside CA
- So-Cal Imports, in Bellflower CA

I also am noticing a distinct lack of ads from Transform, the people I
bought my current transmission from.  Have they folded?  Said
transmission has become quite vehement about jumping out of fourth, so
I'm considering replacing it pretty soon, also.  Both of the above
sell trannys also, so any comments along those lines would be useful
as well.

Thanks much!
