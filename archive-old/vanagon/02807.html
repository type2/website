&gt;&gt;Well, it finally happened. Pulling out of the parking
&gt;&gt;garage yesterday, going from first to second, the clutch
&gt;&gt;cable broke.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;This is NOT unusual for the '71.  I also have that model, and have a spare
&gt;cable on hand at all times.  I guess they twist around more than on the Bug
&gt;'cause I've had to change the cable on the bus 4 times and have NEVER had 
&gt;to change a bug cable in 8 years of VW adventures with 7 different beetles.

&gt;&gt;Where can I get a new clutch cable for a '71 Bus? Will the
&gt;&gt;UFLVWD (Unfriendly local VW dealer) have one? Will I have
&gt;&gt;any luck at the FLAPS? Should I call up Recycled Bugs?
&gt;&gt;Who else?
&gt;&gt;What will it cost me?
&gt;&gt;Are there any tricks or tips for a quick and painless installation
&gt;&gt;and anything I should do to make sure the next one lasts 23 years?

&gt;Haven't had any trouble finding cables, but the price varies a lot from
&gt;13-25 bucks.  It is easy to install.  Just be sure to put plenty of grease
&gt;on the cable and don't leave off the chatter clip at the front.  They can
&gt;be bought separately.  When you get ready to tighten up the wing nut, hold
&gt;the end of the cable so it won't twist around.  You might get 4-5 years out
&gt;of it then.  Enjoy.

Just my  $.02.  I only had to change the clutch cable on my Bug once in
the 8 yrs I owned it.  I have had to change the clutch cable on my'70 Bus
3 times in the 7 yrs I have owned it.  I average 14000 miles a year with a
good amount of stop and go traffic in the city/hwy mix.  This may attribute 
to
increased stress on the cable.  Mine always stretch then fray at the point
where the cable exits the Bowden tube.  The last time it broke was about a
month ago.  My local(and high volume) dealer did not have the part but I was
able to get one from an independent German only(VW/Porsche/BMW/Merc)
parts place.  The replacement I got from them was German made(exact same
part as the one I replaced which I had gotten from the dealer 2yrs earlier).
I paid $6 for the most recent one.  Looking back at my receipts I paid $16
for the one I got at the dealer 2 yrs earlier.

The new cables stretch out a bit after you use them.  I had to adjust the 
freeplay
about 2 weeks after installation to get it to shift smoothly.  No problems 
since.
