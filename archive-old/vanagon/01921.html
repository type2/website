Subject: Eurovan/Winnebago

If anyone is interested ....

I've been getting a LOT of mail from VW ... USA about past and present models.

The promotional material for the EV/Win.... is nearing mind altering level.

I also got a rather convincing video about the 1993 EV in which VW goes all
the way back to 1949 talking about their innovations in the &quot;bus&quot;.

Considering that I already have the '93 EV/MV/Camper, I'm not sure way I am
the recipient except, perhaps, to pass it on.

I'll be glad to share with anyone who'd like to see/have it.
