Subject: Re: Larados or Yokos?

Hello Charles.  I have been promoting the Yoko Y370 for the past 2 
years or so on this list.  They are  just excellent, and worth every 
cent.  These are beautifully made tires.  They require no more than 
an ounce of weight, handle very well, and grip tenaciously in all 
weather conditions.  They are relatively quiet for an LT tire, and 
can really make a Vanagon handle surprisingly well.  They are safe 
and predictable.  

In short, they are worth every penny.  Since tires are like rubber 
bands, and that is all there is between you and the road, I like to 
have a high quality rubber band supporting my Syncro with proper load 
ratings, recommended tire pressures, and size.  The Yoko has yet to 
let me down.  They are a full M &amp; S tire (mud and snow), and is 
suitable for year round use.

I have some snaps of these tires on my web page in my mudflap section 
at:

There are some pictures that show the tread of these tires.

Hope this helps.

Harry.
