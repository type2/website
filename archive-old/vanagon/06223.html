	I have found that, like a true land barge, once Da Boat gets rolling
in the snow, it is hard to stop it.  I have amazed friends in the past by
driving uphill on roads with 8 to 12 inches of fresh or plowed snow on them.
On the other hand, getting going in the first place can be a problem.  Those
same friends laughed at me when I couldn't get out of a glazed over
parking space on near-level ground.  But hey, at least I can live in that
spot comfortably until the Spring thaw!
