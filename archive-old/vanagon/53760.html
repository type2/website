Subject: Re: Rocker Mouldings

I have been looking for a replacement for my '91 Westy which died an early
death due to an engine fire. In that hunt I found a listing under www.highway-
one_dot_com with pictures of all Westies with what I believe you are looking for.
Specialty shop in Santa Rosa Calif redoes Westies and seems to put these on
all the vans I have seen on their page. Phone 707-584-1199. They can probably
give you their source.

&gt; HI there,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a navy blue 86 Vanagon and I'm looking for the &quot;Rocker Mouldings&quot; which
&gt; fit on the sides to protect the vehicle from parking lot nicks, etc.  If anyone
&gt; can help me locate a set of these, please contact me.  I think they would need
&gt; to be blue, although  maybe I could change the color if they did'nt match my
&gt; navy color.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Charles
&gt;
