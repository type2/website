&gt; &gt; the question is: where else to sleep? i've tried truck stops and they are
&gt; &gt; way too loud and busy all night long, and if you try to park out by the
&gt; &gt; trucks, you may wind up eating the fumes of some truckers refrigeration unit.

&gt; I agree with you Joel, except that usually there are some &quot;corners&quot; of truck-
&gt; stop lots that are not crowded, or too small to park an 18-wheeler, that
&gt; are decent places to park.  I have had the best luck by far parking on dirt
&gt; roads around/between fields.  Usually quiet, dark, and private.  Lots of them
&gt; in California, too...


Once I started using these little foam ear plugs I found that the noise 
in truck stops wasn't a problem at all. In fact, I have taken cross 
country trips, staying often in truck stops. I often pull in between two 
of them where the space is too small for other big trucks. With the foam 
plugs I don't even hear them. If I focus, I can feel the vibrations of a 
nearby truck when it revs up to go.

My best bet with truck stops has been to go to the rear of the lot..some 
are quite large....or to the far side.  I've never had a problem with 
finding a suitable spot.... once the noise problem was solved.

You get the foam plugs at most drug stores. The wax plugs and other types 
are uncomfortable. The foam plugs are comfy.  However, if they're too 
&quot;noticeable&quot; in your ears, you can cut them in half for resizing.

Good stuff!  Try it.

James
