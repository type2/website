Subject: LEFT HAND DRILL BITS
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 1995 06:30:30 -0500 (EST)

I saw somone looking for these the other day , I forget who but last
evening I was reading the new &quot;Eastwood&quot; catalog that came in the days mail
and I came across left handed drill bits.  Page 52, 1/8&quot; $4.25,  3/16&quot;
$5.95, 1/4&quot; $11.50, or set of three $18.95.  Sounds cheaper than
the $35.00 kit you were talking about.

Cheers

Frank
