&gt; And people on this list think 
thermite is bad?  LOX isn't the nicest stuff in the world, not only will 
it freeze limbs on your body (not trees), it'll then blow up.  :)

Oh come now -  I had a Dewer flask 3' high ahd about 16&quot; in dia. full of LOX
in my home for about 2 years.  Had a service truck come by about every 3 weeks
 to re-fill it.  When it was quiet in the house (rare) you could hear it
boiling away.  Course, we were kinda parinoid about open flames, no fireplace
usage, big sign on the front window, and we had to be kinda careful when
filling the portable &quot;bottle&quot; from the big tank, 'cause when you unhooked it,
the stainless steel spigot was kinda frosty cold, and if you didn't disconnect
the two tanks right away, they froze together (and so would your flesh if you
were foolish enough to touch it )!

Was a real &quot;treay&quot; to hoist the big tank into the Vanagon when we went away
for more than a half a day.  Used to get my teenage son to help me heft it
into the spot behind the walkthrough, and then used a nylon cargo strap to tie
it down.  Wonder why I never thought to pipe a little of that back to the
little 52 hp diesel that grunted and groaned to push all of us and our stuff
down the road and worse yet, up the hills ?

Seriously - as with anything else, it is a matter of knowledge, respect,
training and 
                              ^^^^^^^^^

proper  usage.  Remember during the 70's gas shortage (for those of you folks
old 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
enough) people were warned not to carry spare gas cans in the trunk of their
cars because 1 or 2 tablespoons of spilled gas in your trunk was the
equivalent of a couple of sticks of dynamite!!   We park our vehicles in
enclosed garages every night, with gas furnaces and waterheaters, and 20 gal.
of gasoline in the car!  (I'm not saying that this is the brightest concept -
well maybe for the first second or so of the flame propagation front), but we
all do it with hardly ever a thought.  (And yes, Bradly is correct, mistreat,
mishandle LOX and it can ruin more than just your day!)
