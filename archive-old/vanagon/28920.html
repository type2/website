&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am new to the list, I only discovered it last week and have been 
&gt; lurking since then.  I've got a '72 Bus with the Westy pop-top.  The 
&gt; question I have is will a '78 Westy top fit onto my '72 bus.  The top 
&gt; I have is in very ragged condition, the fiberglass is very rough and 
&gt; the canvas top is in shredds.  I was at a junk yard the other 
&gt; day and they had a receint arrival of a '78 camper.  The top was in 
&gt; great shape and I could get quite a deal on both the fiberglass hard 
&gt; top and the canvas.  I know they pop up in opposite directions,
&gt; but if I just flip it around will it bolt right on?

Hmmm...don't know about that. I'd like to find out, though. I know where 
there's a '76 with a good top too...and mine is kinda ruff.

&gt; 
&gt; Is this going to too much trouble?  Would it be simpler to just 
&gt; purchase a canvas top, install it myself and repaint the 
&gt; fiberglass?  

What do you mean repaint? I'm getting visions of latex paint peeling in 
about a year or two. There have been numberous discussions on this list 
about ways to clean tops, with the ultimate solution being somewhere 
between environmentally friendly and a lot of work to &quot;let's destroy the 
environment NOW and mix up some pretty toxic chemicals.&quot; You might want 
to search the list archives for info on this. To start, you can send a 
message back to the listserv: &lt;---NOT the discussion list
                    ^^^^^^^^

listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

with no title line and the four-letter word &quot;help&quot; (no quotes) in the body
of the message. No other text should be included. The listserv will then
very politely tell you how to use it...pointing you to info about all
sorts of features. 

Sorry I can't give you better instructions on searching the archives, but 
I always have to look back on that &quot;help&quot; message to figure it out. 
'Sides, I'd rather give you a fishing pole than just a fish. 8)

&gt; Does anyone know where I can buy the canvas top?

Lots of places, including JC Whipme (er, Whitney) sell fishing poles, er 
canvas tops. They range from around $200 up. Your note made me think, 
maybe you could just remove the canvas part and install it in your bus?
Some measuring is probably in order...unless someone here knows the 
answer. Mine was home-made by the PO (previous owner)...and though they 
did a good job on the canvas, I would have rather they fixed the heads...or 
brakes...or pilot bearing. They used a heavy jungle-patterned material, 
some nylon screen and velcro -- I LOVE velcro! They didn't quite get the 
front part of the canvas nailed/stapled in right, but I fixed it over the 
summer.

&gt; How much do they cost and how easy are they to install?  On both the 
&gt; tops the rubber seal is shot, where can I find one of these and how 
&gt; much do they cost?  

Whipme sells yours for around $75. I'm currently living without one, and 
will probably think of some other solution to keep the top from rubbing 
my paint off. I can't part with the $75 for a roof rubber. Too many other 
necessities.

I guess I need a really good catalogue of 
&gt; Volkswagen parts, any suggestions?

I don't have any of the numbers handy, but there should be a file somewhere.

Good luck! 8) Joe
