Subject: Basic VW camper info needed

Hi all,

I'm a new subscriber to the list (and to the type2 list).  I've gotten it
into my head that it would be fun thing for me and my wife and three young
kids if I bought a VW camper... but I have no idea what I want/need.  I have
looked at the vanagon_dot_com website and some of the other VW web resources,
but I'm still not sure...

For anyone with a little time and patience, maybe you could give me some
guidance, on or off list.  I'm interested in spending $5-$10,000 for a VW
camper with stove, fridge, sink, and other camping equipment (as much as
possible), and I would like to buy something with character and
personality... We owned three VW's when I was a kid (2 bugs and a thing),
and I have very fond memories...

Am I looking for a type2?  What year models are type2's?  Am I looking for a
Vanagon?  Either generally?

Any advice, including references to basic VW resources, would be much
appreciated.  TIA.
