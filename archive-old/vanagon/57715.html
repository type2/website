Subject: '81 power loss -- update

Well, I tested the compression today.  #1 had 88 lbs, # 2 &amp; #4 had 80 lbs,
and #3 had 0 lbs.  Yep, zero.  Added some oil to #3, and it didn't change.

The van uses little or no oil, so I am assuming the rings are OK.  So, do I
replace the head... both heads... the engine... ???

A company in CA called Mark Stephens High Performance remanufactures heads
that they guarantee not to drop a seat for 100,000 miles.  Has anybody used
their stuff?

They also make several different levels of high performance engines, called
stage I, II, and III.  The lowest, stage one, is ported and polished,
balanced,  and a bunch of other stuff, and they say it puts out 125 HP.
They guarantee it for 5 years or 100,000.  Again, has anybody had any
experience with this?

Thanks,

Bill
