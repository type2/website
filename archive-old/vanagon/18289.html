Subject: Re: Westy Pop-Tops in the wind

all this talk about pop top's popping inadvertantley got me thinking..

if people want aesthetics plus more pop top security, why don't people grab
a couple extra of these hold down brackets and clips off donor 73' and
older westies in the junkyard. install them towards the outsides of the
poptop (the one that come from the factory sits in the middle of the roof)
that way you could have two or three of those designer VW clips holding
down your roof as opposed to just one? whaddy'all think?
