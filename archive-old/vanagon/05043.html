hi there,
   in reply to where to fix fuel gauge...seems that this is not an uncommon
problem, tho my '70(Old Bess) never had this prob.  Anyway, someone will
probably answer this better, but i overheard some vw folks talking about just
this.  Seems that the gauge is somewhere on the &quot;top&quot; of the engine.  you've
got to open the back hatch, and take off the &quot;cushion&quot; (if you've the camper
variety) and take off the metal plate, so that you are looking down onto the
top of the engine.  After this i got lost, since i was not &quot;looking&quot; at the
time.  Tho you should be able to find out where the gauge is from one of the
various vw bibles (engine books--libraries are great for this).  Also heard
that this problem (taking off the metal plate) was only for certain years.
   sorry i can't help more than that.

                                  D.R.
