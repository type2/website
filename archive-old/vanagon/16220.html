&gt;    What should I check for first?? I have already gone back and
&gt;double-checked the connections on the regulator. Also, she seems to idle a
&gt;bit low when I first start her up....connection???


Maybe due to battery needing a recharge due to starter drain. When the 
regulator switches on the generator you do lose some power, ie RPM drops. 
Take it as a sign that the charging system is 'active' once again. Putting a 
voltmeter across the battery terminals and reading the volts when someone 
starts then revs up Ramona will show if all is well, engine off, 11.8 to 
12.6 volts, engine running, same, generator working 13.6+ volts. Generator 
should cut in when battery voltage hits 11.4 - 11.8 or so. About the hard 
start?? Heat sometimes affects the starters performance, and the engine is 
tight due to thermal expansion. Not enough details on start prob. for an 
uneducated guess.  tim s.
