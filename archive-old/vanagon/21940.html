Subject: Hanover Get-together anyone?

Anyone from MD. or PA. interested in meeting Sat night after dinner?
There is a great old-time drive up fast food place where all the old cars
hang out at on Sat. nights.  It's in Hanover, PA, we could meet and 
check out other classic machines from decades ago, or talk
amongst ourselves.
Paul
