Subject: 95 Winny Van Bra

Hey all,

My Dad has a new fangled 95 Winnebago EV.   He is looking for a Bra for the
front - and apprarently, he 
wants the one that is &quot;lower profile&quot;  - Doesn't cover the whole nose.

Does any one know a manufacturer/supplier of such a thing.

He would greatly appreciate it.

Please E-Mail Directly to :     Jimhager_at_aol_dot_com


Thanks 

MrJimmy3
