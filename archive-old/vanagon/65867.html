Subject:      FS: 1985 GL, 94k, $1500 obo in WV

Well looking outside and realizing I have 5 cars I have decided since
I can't get rid of any parts on the GTI and as it will be a better
mileage winter beater I'm selling the '85 van instead.  I've tried
this before but I feel this should be a damn appealing offering price
for somebody given the fairly good level of maintainence.
I am in Keyser WV, 2.5-3 hours from DC, Baltimore, Pittsburg.

particulars

blue metallic
GL &quot;weekender interior&quot;
no A/C
4 spd

good:
over $5000 in receits '91-present major things, two factory heads,
clutch, NEW factory P/S rack, radiator by PO, within last 30k miles.
by me, new Dansk exhaust 1 yr old, new steel coolant pipes, new P/S
pipes, new fuel lines, new front rotors, bearings, pads, new rear
shoes, nice used fuel tank, changed tranny oil, new water pump, new
O2 sensor TBI, CV's inspected greased, new clutch master, rebuilt
slave, new Bosch reman starter, one new upper ball joint TBI.

bad:
normal seam rust for this area, normal 12 yr old car questions,
carpet pretty crappy rest of interior good, 2nd gear synchros just a
tad bit rough, if you pause a second in neutral never a problem, I am
overly critical, tires unreinforced about 10k left on them, you can
make the choice (Conti's $200/set from Tire Rack), muffler not
replaced with exhaust about 10k/ 1 year left on it, rear heater core
leaked, fan dead, whole thing removed and lost.

This thing has been my everyday beater.  I jump in it and drive it
1000 miles without worry, it turns in 19-22 mpg, recent oil analysis
says engine strong, compression checked good when last I measured.
ABSOLUTELY no coolant leaks, getting the system back in shape after
the coolant pipes was a fair chore and I have been very critical to
inspect and acount for any coolant loss, currently has &quot;green stuff&quot;
in it as I did not want to use good stuff till I knew the system was
solid, I will swap for Prestone LongLife before sale if wanted. I
bought it somewhere in the 80k range nearly 2 years ago.  I need
better mileage, I don't need the room, and the van holds bad personal
memories (not about the van though) so I'm wanting rid of it.  I got
an outlandishly good deal on it cause it needed the exhaust and the
coolant pipes and the PO went to dealer for estimate.  I have $1200 in
it and countless hours on the exhaust and coolant and P/S pipes.  I'm
open to any fair offers, I think I'm pretty well below book on this.
This will make an excellent runner for somebody that needs the room,
or dare I say it, the heat for this winter.  Quite a few people on
the list have seen it, Steve Dolan has driven it, though back then it
had a teeny FI problem solved with grounding system repairs.  Good
van to somebody who needs it, worth the asking in parts alone if you
had say a camper you wanted to keep forever.
