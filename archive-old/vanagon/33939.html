Subject: Brake job (1962) - STILL!!!

Hi, 
thanks again to everyone for all the help &amp; suggestions - it's very well
appreciated.

I had a miserable day working in below freezing yesterday. Achieved nothing more
than getting those dust caps off (used a bar at an angle &amp; a mallet), and gazing
dejectedly at the brake shoes that I couldn't dis-assemble. Yes, that's right,
another question!!

Taking the rear brakes apart was no problem, but the springs are bigger &amp;
different in the front. Muir says glibly &quot;just pry the bottom of the shoe out of
the slot and twist to remove the springs&quot; (or something). Impossible. Will
draining the brake system help? I tried taking the cylinders off, undid the only
bolts I could see (getting desperate!) but that just made the backplate loose.
Anymore of those good ideas on how to do this bit? 

Also, any criteria on when a wheel cylinder needs replacing, or when an overhaul
will do?
Just let me know when you get bored of all my questions!
Thanks x 100
