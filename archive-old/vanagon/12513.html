 &gt; &gt;&gt;So David Kao says:
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; What I did was I bought a pair of 6 1/2 inch subwoofers. I flush mounted
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; them below the original Blaupunkt speakers and changed a little bit of the
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wiring. 
 &gt; &gt;&gt;
 &gt; &gt;&gt;You lost me on this mounting bit David.  Are you saying you mounted the
 &gt; &gt;&gt;subwoofers (I have a hard time calling 6 1/2 inch speakers woofers) below
 &gt; &gt;&gt;and perpendicular to the Blaupunkt's or what?
 &gt; &gt;&gt;
 &gt; &gt;&gt;Steven
 &gt; &gt;&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; Sorry I did not make it clear. I did not believe 6 1/2&quot; could qualify
 &gt; as (sub) woofer untill I tried them with my stereo in the house then I decided
 &gt; to put them on my 84 vanagon. The subwoofers were on my yuk BMW 2002, not exactly
 &gt; bought from a store but I paid to get the BMW...
 &gt; 
 &gt; Below the Blaupunkt there is a space enough for flush mounting a 6 1/2 speaker.
 &gt; Window glass does not go down that low so it won't get in the way of the glass.
 &gt; You don't need to cut any sheet metal either. Does it sound more interesting
 &gt; now?
 &gt; 
 &gt; If you take the door panel off you will see the sheet metal opening there. The
 &gt; opening is not round but you can mount a speaker with 4 screws neatly.
 &gt; Actually, the sheet metal opening is not exactly big enough for 6 1/2 speaker.
 &gt; Especially my subwoofer has a fairly big magnet, it did not fit in. I had to
 &gt; mount the speaker 1/2 inch above the mounting surface by adding a 1/2&quot; thick
 &gt; plywood cut to fit the back of the frame (rim) of the speaker. I wrapped the
 &gt; plywood rim with balck tape so it looks really nice. I cut a hole from the
 &gt; door panel and reinstalled the panel back. Then I flush mounted the subwoofer
 &gt; (sandwitched the plywood rim) to the door. The plastic pocket on driver's door
 &gt; needs to be moved. It can be moved without leaving any scar.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The subwoofer, mounted in such location, is about at my (and the passenger's)
 &gt; foot tip on the door. It won't get in my foot's way but I did kick it
 &gt; by accident from time to time. I got a dent on the speaker grille already.
 &gt; SO look for a stronger grille for the speakers.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The subwoofers I got have great bass indeed. The door provides enough room
 &gt; (functions as the speaker box) and the bass gets ereally low.
 &gt; Hope this helps.

Thanks for all the suggestions. I think I will try wiring in some other
speakers that have a better bass response and mount them on the door as
David suggests.

Thanks, I'll let you know how it goes.
