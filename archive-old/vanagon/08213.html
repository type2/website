Subject: RE- Hella H4 Headlights

I installed H4's on an '84 Rabid GTI I had with good results;

MUCH improved lighting-the fluting on the lens does an excellent job
of dispersing white light where you need it the most (immediately in
front of the car, and off to the passenger side of the road, where the
road signs typically are), and away from where you need it the least
(oncoming drivers' eyeballs).

A couple of caveats-check to be sure your light switch/relay can handle
the juice (if you opt for the 80/100W bulbs); my switch sort of, uhh,...
well,... let's just say I had to replace it...
I would probably recommend that you stay away from plastic lens covers
that you can get; I ended up getting cracks in both lenses (didn't
really affect performance, but still, it allows condensation w/i the 
housing.)

BTW, when I had 'em, they cut through the tule fog on Hwy 99 and I-5 like
a champ; I think you'll really like 'em, Thom.
