Well I'm back and as an experiment I left my subscriptions open for the
ten days away and .... wait for it...there were over 1500 messages
waiting; the bulk of them from this group! Two of my favorite issues were
discussed a) the usefulness of secondary oil coolers and b) gauges. WRT to a
secondary oil coolers here is what we have experienced. A GEX rebuilt in
an 82 Westy with high compression on all cylinders but shows no signs of
overheating with no secondary cooler. We attempt to drive back from CA to
Ottawa fully packed down - two bikes, computers, a tv etc etc (everything we
owned at the time) and decide to go through Yosemite. The long slow climb
and the 18% grades did us in. The oil light would come on if I did not
keep the revs up which was difficult going up steep grades and fully
loaded. This was in May so it was not that hot (there was still some snow
blocking the passes). After one night at the outskirts of the park a
decison was made to scoot back down to PaloAlto and pick up a second
cooler (better to make the decision when you have the option to turn
around then when you don't). I installed the cooler that day - bolted it
to the side and we headed out on our 4 day journey home. We made it and
the oil light did not come on once nor did the engine overheat plus we got a
decent 23 mpg average mpg. Since then I have moved the cooler under the
van and installed a fan and  this week will install the thermostat that Norm
Leong sent. For me there is no question that a second oil cooler
will help at the margins where it counts most. I have no idea if engine
life is
improved or reduced but I do know it helped get me and my pregnant wife
(at the time) back to Canada safely. 

While we  were away this time  in CA we  drove from San Diego (Dave S. we
seemed to have
missed each other?) up to Palo Alto along the PC Highway. It is astounding
that there are so many good vans of all years on the highway. It was great
to be back and dip our feet in the ocean.

I managed to
locate an oil temp sender which fits the VDO gauge. Kohlweiss had them for
12 dollars. It mounts into the oil sump plate and seem to be the only
option for Vanagon models. The dipstick sender is too short and Porsche no
longer makes their 914 sump plate sender..
  
I would agree with Dave S. that an oil pressure gauge is most useful; it
like an oil temp gauge allows you to monitor the effects of head winds and
grades on engine and oil temperature.

Someone asked about using a second oil cooler to heat the interior of
the van. This is paradoxical in that when you need the heat the most is
also when you least need the second oil cooler. Some have
even suggested that if the oil is too cool it may lead to premature engine
wear.
