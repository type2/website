Subject: shift rod

I've got a '72 westy. I've been trying to fix little odds and ends that 
seem to pop up before spring arrives. I replaced the shifter coupler and 
then repacked the gear shift rod. The pocket that the ball of the shifter 
sits in is very worn. Is it possible to replace the socket or do you have 
to replace the entire front shifter rod? Also as per the advice I got 
from a few of you, I'm replacing all the fuel lines. My gas heater line 
was all dry and the other main line had no grommet around it when it went 
thru the fire wall. It was an accident waiting to happen. Does anyone 
know if the rubber mats that are under the front seats are still 
available? possibly from WCM? Thanks in advance!
