Subject:      floor pan



I'm about to do the big grind, but need a floor pans for the cab of my 71 bus.
I have seen sources for them in the UK but not here in the US. (I'll be in the
UK this fall and have thought about trying to fit the two in my duffel but I
need them now). I have seen sources for the microbus but not for the later bay
window. I also need to replace the gas pedal (I'm tired of the oversized door
hinge I have been using, though it was a life saver). I also need the metal
ring that attaches to the floor at the base of the steering columns. I realize
that this is not directly related to der trip, but if I don't get resurrect
this bus its a no show.....
                       Thanks,


                               Tim
