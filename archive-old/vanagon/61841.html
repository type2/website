Just would like to share this you folks....

My fuel pump got quite noisy last week and since I'm heading into the 
backwoods for a couple of weeks of trout fishing I checked into prices for 
a spare.
Checked out 4 FLAPS and got prices ranging from $329 to $395 (Canadian) for 
the pump..._dot_decided to risk going without one.
Went to my local VW dealer to pick up some curtain hangers at noon today 
and asked about fuel pump prices as an afterthought.
Surprise!!!!.....$219.00....and I quickly ordered one.
After being on this list for about a month I had stopped checking prices at 
VW dealerships because I had thought they would always be more expensive.
Maybe the parts guy made a mistake! Hope not though.
