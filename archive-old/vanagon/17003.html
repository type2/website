Subject: Re: German Wants To Join!

&gt;you another $300 to repeat it! The two cars I currently own would never 
&gt;pass the german inspection of the TUV.
&gt;You're also not allowed to perform certain work by yourself for your car, 
&gt;like major welding and brake jobs etc etc. All that sort of stuff must be 
&gt;done by a certified mechanic who charges $$$$$/hour. It's in general 
&gt;less common to do major maintenance work on cars on your own.

A dutch friend seconded this point, most cars go for sale once the warranty 
is over, due to labour costs. And older ones go to the junkyard faster than 
we would ever allow. While it's difficult to bring a car into this country, 
Canada, bringing in used parts is trivial, just pay duty on the purchase 
price. Good way to get that Porsche motor we've all been dreaming of.  tim s.
