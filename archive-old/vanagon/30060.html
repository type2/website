Hey all,
	I'm very new to this list but I'm an avid Volkswagen fan and am
	glad to find a bus list.  My first car was a 1975 VW Beetle
	(this wasn't too long ago, as I'm 19 now) which was bright
	yellow.  The car had been converted from fuel injection to
	carburetion by a previous owner but never did run right (I think
	it would have been better off with the fuel injection).  The
	body was in good shape, there was a little rust on the floorpan,
	but nothing major.  Anyway, my folks bought a new car for
	themselves and offered me their old car (a 1989 Toyota 4Runner)
	which I, in my state of youth and inexperience, foolishly
	accepted, selling my precious VW.  While the 4Runner is a nice
	car, it has no personality and now I am looking to buy a bus.
	This purchase will probably have to wait until this summer.  I
	figure a bus is better than a bug for hauling all my stuff back
	and forth to college and they're just so darn cool anyway.  So,
	I'm interested in getting a late model bus, maybe 1977-1979 or
	so.  I therefore have a few questions:  Did buses ever come
	standard with a fresh air fan on the dashboard?  I've only seen
	one but it looked like an add-on, but it looked like a good
	(factory or dealer-quality) add-on.  Also, how's the reliability
	of the fuel injection systems on the '77-'79 buses?  I've heard
	that the '75's were bad but I figure it got better as the years
	went on.  I don't want one that's been converted because I've
	had bad experiences with that.  Since I've owned a VW before, I
	know generally what to look for as far as problem areas go
	(heater boxes, heater cables, rust, etc.) but are there any
	areas more specific to buses that I should know about?  I hope
	that someone on this list can give me good answers (and, knowing
	VW fans, that shouldn't be a problem) so thanks in advance for
	helping me out and I hope I'll be joining the ranks of the
	bus-owning soon.  

	Sean
