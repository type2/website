  NON-freindly VW dealer and these holes said it can't be done!

&gt; You have to punch in the security code.  If you do not know it find the
&gt; radio code number on the back or side of the radio.  Take it to your
&gt; friendly VW dealer and they can punch it into their computer and get the
&gt; original security code for you.
