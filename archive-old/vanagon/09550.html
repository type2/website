&gt; Good idea for me! (I'm in Tucson)  I'll bet we wouldn't get very many people
&gt; though.  I know some good, free, places to camp near Zion National Park,
&gt; specifically, in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park (UT).  This would still
&gt; be quite a drive for most of the Cal. people though (a good 100 miles
&gt; past Lost Wages NV).
&gt; 

While we're discussing that neck of the woods, how about Tuweap
(aka Toroweap) on the Arizona Strip. Do you know the place?
It's smack dab in the middle of the Grand Canyon.  The camping
area is basically one big rock. Only major drawback is that
it's about 65 miles of dirt road from Fredonia, AZ, and if
one is prone to sleepwalking, there's about a 3000 foot drop, 
but a cool photo op!

&gt; Well, we've got four people in AZ now, maybe we could have our own little
&gt; get together??

Sound good to me -- is Peppersauce (outside Oracle) still there?
I though it may have been gobbled up by the Biosphere. I still
like the Chiricahuas, like over Memorial day......
