Subject: Subscribing?

Hey all, sorry for the bandwidth use, but I'm switching computer services
from AOL to Netcom and was wondering how to resubscribe to the Vanagon List!
 I'd hate to miss out on a single day of helpful hints (and discussions of
engine case burning!).  Also, do I need to unsubscribe from my AOL screen
name?

Thanks for the help....
