Subject:      Re: Westi window screens

&gt;A message sent said -
&gt;I have found a set of Westi side windows with the screens but no
&gt;screen material in them, so:
&gt;1. How hard is it to remove the screens from the windows?
&gt;- - - - - - -
&gt;It's been awhile, but I think one pushes up
&gt;on them and then they pull out.  Anyway, they
&gt;do come out.
For Plastic screens: just push them out, start at one
corner. Easy work if rubber sealing and plastic are
not glued together.


&gt;2. Can they be rescreened once they are off?
&gt;- - - - - - - -
&gt;Yes, but (I knew you were waiting for that)
&gt;It's a real pain to figure out how to obtain just
&gt;the right tension to prevent sags while the paint
&gt;dries.  Hot melt won't work.  I eventually ended
&gt;up using plastic model cement.  Try a little out
&gt;in a hidden (installed) place.  Some cements
&gt;will melt certain plastics.  Try it out on the
&gt;screen fabric also.

Why don't change them? A new screen (non pop-out,
non sliding) will cost only DM 100.- +/- including
new rubber sealing. Shipping just inexpensive
during the 'fender lips group purchase'.
