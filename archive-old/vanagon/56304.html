&lt;&lt; 	I have never been happy with those guys. Twice I tried to order from
 them and the price quoted was at least double their catalog price. A
 mainshaft bearing was quoted over three times higher than their newest
 catalog. They even had the nerve to say the price in the catalog was
 three years old. Well then change it, don't keep me on the phone for 20
 min to try to scam more money. I don't even consider doing business with
 them anymore.
