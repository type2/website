&gt; I just got some info from a local dealer on some of the changes from the
&gt; '95 EV Camper to the '97.
&gt; 
&gt; new VR6 engine
&gt; new engine and transmission mounts (3)
&gt; 140 hp  (was 109)
&gt; 177lb-ft: torque  (was 140lb-ft)
&gt; Dual airbags added
&gt; ABS made standard
&gt; Traction control system added (low speed)
&gt; 4-wheel disc brakes (rear added)
&gt; Automatic transmission (4-speed) made standard
&gt; Any thoughts on any of these changes???

	If all of these were options, I wouldn't want any of them.  It'll
make the vehicle too expensive for a lot of folks.
