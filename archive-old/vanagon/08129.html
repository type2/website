&gt;except for the  connector.  I soldered the wires together, since they hang down 
&gt;where water and stuff splashes on them, and I'd rather not have corrosion 
&gt;causing bad signals a few years down the road.

&gt;On the receipt:  0258-003-913  3-wire Oxy sensor $65.19

I use a $35 dollar part from the local auto store (Hi-Lo Auto Supply in Austin).
Works fine but didn't have the anti-size.  Though I have been getting less miles 
per tank since using it.
