Subject: VANAGON FOR SALE? HELP!

Oh, no!  Are curcumstances forcing me to sell my beloved Camper?  I love
my '83, water tight camper.  It has 135k, on it's second engine (email
me for sad story about how the first met its end), has a top speed on
the level, no tail wind, no drafting of 83 mph.  But because of wierd
problem #2, I think I will have to sell it.  Please send comments and
suggestions!

Weird problem #1.  When the wheater is warm, turn the key...and no
starter.  Checked the  usual: starter and switch fine.  Can start it by
crawling under wit a screw driver on the terminals.  Mechanic puts a
booster on the starter and it works for a while.  I take it back and
tell him to fix it or put a aux starter button on it.  He does the later
and the problem is rendered moot.

Weird problem #2: Intermitantly hard to start.  I run 2 batteries. 
Rarely starts on main battery even tho engine cranks just fine.  No
firing at all.  Spark OK, therefore...  Put the battery on both, fires
up.  Usually.  Sometimes takes me 15 minutes to start it.  If that
happens the reason is that it is flooded.  When engine is warm, best to
open throtle all the way to disable cold start injecter before cranking.

All the mechanics I've talked to in the Ft. Worth, TX area say take it
to Tim's German Auto, he's the only one who really knows VWs.  (I had
been avoiding Tim because he is supper expensive) Tim says sounds like
an injector problem, and those problems are very expensive.  Suggests I
put a carburetor on it.  Anyone ever done this?

Call a guy who sells the kits.  He says don't because I'll never be able
to get an inspection sticker in the Metroplex.  (We are under strick EPA
rules).  Seems if you start with fuel injection you have to stay with
it.  I'm stumped.

Suggestions, offers?

TBill
