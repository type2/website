&gt; 73 Bus  22  
&gt; 74 Bus  17  
&gt; 75 Bus   5  
&gt; 76 Bus  12  

So the analyitical question of the day is: 

Why is there such a disproportionately low number of busses in 1975?  
Was everyone spending all their money on roller-skates and bell-
bottoms?

Hmmm.  That's too much thinking for Friday!
