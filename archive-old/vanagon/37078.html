Subject: Craftsman tools (was: Spring clip pliers)


&gt;I think Craftsman tools are still fairly good.  The only one I've
&gt;ever broken is the 3/8&quot; u-joint ratchet extension, and I expected it to
&gt;break.  I also like Craftsman sockets because they are thin-walled and
&gt;allow you to get a socket over bolts that are real close to something.
&gt;I've never broken one yet, but for the really stressful jobs I use
&gt;impact sockets.  Good luck breaking one of those!  Until someone comes
&gt;out with stronger, cheaper tools, I'll be buying Craftsman.

I've broken three Craftsman screwdrivers-- guess trying to lift an
entire bus with one, just isn't a good idea. Replaced free each time.

Also, when my open toolbox got rained on in Cape Cod, MA in 1987, all
the tools rusted... except the Craftsmans.

They're OK in my book.
