Subject: Tires and Rattling Noise

This is a two in one message:

1.  I have some 195 tires on my 85 7 passenger.  I was wondering as to 
advantages of getting bigger tires like 205.  I hear that certain tires 
save gas spcially bigger ones.  Can anyone shed some light on this issue?

2.  I have started to hear a rattling noise around the engine 
compartment.  It seems to start when I shift my automatic into drive and 
it diminishes or disappears when in N/P.  Just for your information, I 
had my tranny rebuilt last October and I am told that I have a slow head 
gasket leak on my 142,000 1.9L.


Thanx,
