Subject: What do these codes mean?

After a busy semester, I am beginning to think about working on our 74. In
attempting to figure out exactly what we have, I decided to look at the
codes.

I found the following on the engine block, at the left rear top:
AW013453

The following seems to be the chassis number (on dashboard, driver's side):
2242082408

On plate on bulkhead behind driver's seat:
42 082 408
568 671
E1R150 D52 148 227 508
50 1 7260 UH 2218 41

On plate on bulkhead behind passenger seat:
Typ. 28
Heizg. Typ 2/255 8 Pr=FClz~~~S111
=46ahrgest-Nm 2242082408

The reason I ask this is because these numbers appear to have nothing to do
with the numbers listed in Muir.

Also, I wish to send out holiday greetings to everyone on the list. I have
learned alot and been inspired through your postings.
