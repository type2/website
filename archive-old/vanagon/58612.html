&lt;&lt;  your info is correct   tranny goes every 100k or so   cv joints go all

 but i  LUV   mine anyway       good luck   !!!!  &gt;&gt;

I think that &quot;Syncronaut's&quot; experience is abberational.  I've had my 87
Syncro since 1991 and have added 105,000 miles to it's original 47,000 miles
- now 152,000 total miles and 11 years old.  I've replaced most CV joints
once, none more than once.  I have done NO work on any of the other Syncro
related components.  All original without problems are: transmission, rear
diff, diff lock, driveshaft, viscous coupling, and front diff.  The
transmission has been making sort of a low ggrrrrrrrr sound for many
thousands of miles now, but still operates fine.  Also, I don't treat my van
gently.  I go off-roading with it and load it up with BIG weith for long
trips.

I may have had some good luck here and perhaps the norm lies between my
experience and Syncronaut's.  I have heard of one Syncro with nearly 250,000
miles on the original engine &amp; drivetrain.

On the non-Syncro stuff, I;ve replaced the waterpump at 80,000 miles, clutch
(same as 2WD) at 90,000, and heads at 100,000 miles.  More lately I swapped
in a used engine when my original lost oil pressure &amp; began knocking at about
140,000 miles.
Heads typically last 70,000 to 140,000 miles before corrosion causes a leak.
