Subject: Re: /F How not to do restorations



&gt;now, supposedly there was this fellow from Anniston, AL who blew a fuse in
&gt;his pickup truck, and lost his headlights. well, sir, he didn't have no
&gt;fuses in the glove box, but he did have his .22 rifle in the rack behind 
the
&gt;seat. :)  so he gets a .22 Long Rifle cartridge from the rifle and puts it
&gt;into the fusebox. presto! he's got headlights again.
&gt;
&gt;only problem is ... see, fuses get kinda hot. so did the cartridge.
&gt;BANG! the fusebox shot him in his foot. :)
&gt;
&gt;if you knew anything about the folks who grew up in Anniston, you'd find 
that
&gt;story very very easy to believe. :)
