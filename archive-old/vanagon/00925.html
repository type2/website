&gt; What kind of tires does everyone run on their vans? I have a pair of 185R14 

We are on our fourth set of tires on the van.  So far:

1.  The original Continentals 185R14.
2.  Pirelli P77 205/70-14
3.  Pirelli P44 195/70-14
4.  Currently Dunlops (can't remember the model) 195/70-14

The Continentals are terrible in the snow.  The P77 have great traction but
wear out fast.  On our first trip with them one of them blew out after several
hundred miles but the others lasted over 30K miles.  The P44 lasted longest so
far.  The Dunlops are ok so far (I did not buy them.)
