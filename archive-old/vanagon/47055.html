 1) I've got a rattle in the Cat. converter.  Do I necessarily need to 
 replace the converter?  I know it won't pass emissions inspections 
 without it, but can I damage the engine by not fixing this?
 
 2) Also, I have a pin size hole in the muffler.  For those of you who've 
 done work on these parts, have you done it yourself?Any recommendations 
 on parts to get/avoid?
 
 Sort of 3rd questions - can those rusty bolts be dealt with?
 
 THanks,

If the Cat . rattles, it needs to be repalced.  It will eventually move
around and restrict the exhaust outlet.  This can cause you to get stuck with
no power and do some engine damage.  Replace it ASAP.
