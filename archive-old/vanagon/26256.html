Subject: Re: 1987 Double sliding door?

I noticed that on my '79 (and probably all breadloaves) that the body comes
from the factory ready to install a sliding door on either or both sides of
the van.

I'm guessing that that's mostly for right-wheel drive countries, where they
have the sliding door on the left(?).
