&gt; Bob, this is turning into an epic novel. There's a book called The Blue
&gt; Volkswagen

actually it is called &quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot; and is by Jacques Poulin (if memory serves) a french-candian 
author. kinda fun  to read nothing too heavy, btw the bus is red and white mid 60's deluxe. 

&gt;about someone who travels across Canada doing running repairs to
&gt; his clapped out bus. Sound familiar? You haven't met any sexy female
&gt; hitchhikers who just happen to be ace mechanics, have you??  You'd have a
&gt; best seller on your hands :)
