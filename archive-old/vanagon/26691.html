&gt;Doees anyone out there know of a source for vanagon spoiler kits and body
&gt;kits/grille? I saw one in an old vw/porsche mag i was thumbing through
&gt;yesterday(prior to inserting it in the round file) and saw an ad from
&gt;Änything Ltd.&quot;in LA for a cool grille for round headlite vanagons which had
&gt;two driving lites in the grille ala Kamei rabbit/scrirrocco. Unfortunately
&gt;they are out of bus.. Thanks Ed

I think that two compaines might have parts you're interested it.
 Unfortunately I don't know how to contact either one.  Oettinger is one and
Projektzwo is the other.  I appoligize for the awful spelling.  I think that
I've seen body add-ons from both of these in the magazines.

Good Luck!
