Although we are about to hit the road for 6 weeks, count us in, too. We are
in Northern, VA now, will return from the 6 week trip to our new homestead in
my Home State of North Carolina. Would offer all the tools a VW'er could
need, and a safe harbor.

BTW: Who has ownership of this &quot;Aid List&quot; project? Is someone actually taking
names, makin' a spreadsheet/map/phonelist? I can't right now, but if this aid
list hasn't materialized by 10 NOV, I wil pick up that task.  Remind me.
