Check the plastic coolant tank (the one with the sensor in it) for 
cracks.  It had craked on mine.  MUCH cheaper than heads.

&gt; I have an automatic 86 Vanagon w. air. Yesterday, I was driving along and
&gt; my coolant tempature gage light went off. I checked my coolant expansion
&gt; tank and it was empty. I refilled it and light went off and everything was
&gt; fine. Today , I checked the coolant and it seemed lower than when I filled
&gt; it, but not as low as yesterday.  There seems to be no puddles of coolant
&gt; forming under the car or visible leaking.  Could this be a fluke, bad water
&gt; pump or the dreaded head gasket. Thank you for any advice.
