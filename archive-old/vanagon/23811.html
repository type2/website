Subject: Re: 87 vanagon oil pressure problems

NY IDEAS????   I'm wondering about the oil pressure relief valve.  Does 
&gt;spring need replacing?   Did valve bore or cylinder get scored in rebuild 
&gt;or are metal chips (gasp) causing valve to stick?
&gt;
What kind of oil and filter. It sounds like you are putting sufficient heat 
into the oil to thin it out considerably. There appears to be a bit of delay 
between your high demand and the onset of the warning light. Revving the 
engine will obviously build pressure, but it has to be pretty low to set of 
the warning light anyhow, below 8psi I think. Maybe you have a partial 
blockage near the sender?  tim s. 

ps my '87 Syncro blew out its oilcooler O-ring last winter, you should get 
the new improved one if you haven't already.
