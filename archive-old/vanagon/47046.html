Subject: Here I come again!

Hi fellas!

After being disconnected for about a month because we had major changes 
here with the new server we got, I (Angel) feel very happy to join the 
list again. What a surprise to me to see that the list was divided in 
two. I already subscribed to both of them. During this month I had very 
pleasant moments with my Westy and Wasserboxer. First, thanks to Joe 
Chanin for his honesty and diligent supply of the bug screen. My wife did 
a fine job cleaning it and now looks as new. My 78 Westy won another 
trophy at the 6th Bug-In at Aguadilla (Northwest of Puerto Rico) and my 
85 Vanagon was finally fixed. Remember I called her nasty and spoiled 
brat? Well, with the big help of my friend Pucho (Vanagon guru of P.R.) 
we checked the whole engine, sensor by sensor, cable by cable, relay by 
relay, and all the switches and the problem was still there. Finally 
after a month we decided to take out the head cover (by the side of the 
3rd cylinder) and what we found!?! One of the springs was totally broken, 
we replaced it and now the engine purrs like a cat and has a lot of 
power. Still there is a little problem; there is a short-circuit 
somewhere because the micro switch of the trottle switch is being burned. 
Any ideas or suggestions? Ahhh!! how good is to be back in this family.
Keep in touch,

Angel
