&gt; Anyone have any idea what 15&quot; beauty rings for old bus
&gt; wheels are going for?  Last I heard a set of 4 NOS 14&quot; rings
&gt; were $75-100 and I assume the 15&quot; version pulls in a higher
&gt; price.
&gt; 
The last time I was in Dayton and at the Evil VW dealer, I visited the
parts department.  I do this so that I can look at the Bently Vanagon
manual that I am still too cheap to buy.  Anyway, the dealer has some VW
trim rings on a shelf with about 3 years worth of dust.  The dealer ship
is Dave Dennis VW/mazda. (Buy parts, DON'T buy used cars from here!!!!) 
Interested?  I could ask my step mother to investigate.
