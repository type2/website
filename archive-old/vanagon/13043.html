Subject: Re: Reinforced Sidewalls and Eu


I'd like to thank Norman for his BRILLIANT suggestion...the salesperson
was really confused when I told him that EuroVan with 10k miles on
it really had shitty tires....almost like the dealership rolled back
the mileage, 'cause the Contis on it looked like they had at least 35k
miles...

To which he said..&quot;Contis???...'coulda sworn the EV had Mitchelans
on it...Hmmmm...&quot;

;-)
