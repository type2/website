Subject: Everyone must read! Re: Valve Noise

&gt; Hey there Listees
&gt; 
&gt; The valves in my 83.5 waterboxer tend to be really loud on cold start-up.  I
&gt; realize that my hydrolic lifters need to be pressurized with oil for them to
&gt; correctly &quot;lift&quot; the rocker armes to the correct height, however the valves
&gt; are loud quite abit on start-up and sometimes needs to be driven at least
&gt; half an hour before they quiet down. ......&gt;

    Never run your engine for just a short distance. Always get the
    motor hot, ever time you run it. Change your oil, and you will
    never have this problem again.
             I have typed this message several
    times now, to maney people! That's why the &quot;must read&quot; in subject.
