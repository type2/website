Subject: Canadian tire van tent follow-up

I got one of these puppys, finally after searching all the stores in a 100
mile radius.  None in stock except in Alymer, Qc, they had three.  Well
when I left they had two !  So  the tent,  it is made by &quot;Spalding&quot;
not &quot;CampMate&quot; as I had written previously.  It is a very well made nylon
tent with rain fly and front porch awaning, two zippered windows with
screen as is  the front and rear openings.  Size is 8.5' x 8.5' x 88&quot; . 
Outside poles and goes up quickly.  Regular price is $249.95.  Fitting it
to the Vanagon either the rear hatch or side opening will take some
modification as the tunnel between the vehicle and tent is a tad too high
for the Vanagon side door and the rear hatch is too long and rises up too
high for it to fit at the back.  I have begun modifications to fit it to
the side entry and it is not too complicated, however it will to have a
new, longer zipper installed in the rear fly.  Not all that complicated if
you have some sewing skills and can find a long enough zipper ( I'm still
working on this part so I cnnot report success as yet).  We may use it
this weekend or next before the modifications are complete as it is not a
big problem with the tunnel opening.  That's it for now.

Cheers

Frank
