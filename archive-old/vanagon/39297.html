Subject: Re: Removing very old stickers from glass.How?

Hey Now,
 I use citrisolve, a natural citric acid solvent. It will remove anything from
anything. Check it out at your nearest grocery or health food store.

&gt; Help!
&gt; We have some really old crappy stickers on our pop out window (pre us ie over
&gt; 20 years old). We want to remove but are seeming impossible. They seem to be
&gt; some kind of plastic and only the  surface comes off mm by mm leaving
&gt; gunk/smear.
&gt; I am afraid of using a scraper in case of scratching the glass. Anyone got
any
&gt; ideas?
&gt; Of course if they were Grateful Dead stickers that'd be alright! BTW Anyone
&gt; got a line on one of these for me...? I'll swap sumfin?   Dave
