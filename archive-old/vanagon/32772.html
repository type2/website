Subject: O2 idiot light

I guess if I have to ask this question then I am one of those people who need
the light.  My O2 sensor idiot light in the dash of my 85 Vanagon came on.  I
replaced the O2 sensor in the exhaust but can't figure out how to reset the
idiot light.  Can anyone tell me how to reset this indicator?

BTW,  with a new O2 sensor and not resetting the idiot light, could this have
an affect on my problem of running too rich a fuel mixture?
