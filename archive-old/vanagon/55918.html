Subject: help!! diesel brake booster vacuum hose flange broken...


O.K., folks, here's a good one....

The flange that attaches the vacuum hose (that feeds the brake
booster) to the vacuum pump in my diesel westy came apart... 
Oil is everywhere, and it is a big mess.   Can I get this thingie  as
a part, or do I have to get a whole vacuum pump????

If you know this part, and  have any information on how to obtain it,
I'll appreciate your help.  Alternatively, if I need to buy the whole
enchilada (the vacuum pump), how do I but it???


Thanks in advance,
Cetin
