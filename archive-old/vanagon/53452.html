Subject: Passenger side mirror needed '87

Volks,

Night vandals needed a little anger release or something, so they smashed
my '87 GL's right-side mirror into the door, breaking all it was possible
to break, much beyond the capabilities of SuperGlue. God, I love living in
a college town!

Due to circumstances beyond my control (Damn! I miss her and the kids)
bankruptcy is imminent, so I can't afford much. Anybody have or know of one
of these for $25.00 or so - I think I could afford that, plus shipping. A
U-PullIt place in Florida had one when I was down there a few years ago - I
shoulda got it, it was only five bucks!

And if you want the story's gory details in return as well, I'll provide
them. And, yes, I still love her, but that's probably irrelevant. The one
who's been left always does, no?
