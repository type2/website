&gt;&gt; Wonder what that would be like if they did the same add for a Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;It would have to be a deer. &lt;KARUMPH!&gt; And then scenes of the Vanagon
&gt;driving away with the deer nicely packed into the fiberglass Westfalia
&gt;luggage rack...

1. is NOBODY doing any work out there today??? :)
2. bug is to Golf III/Corrado   as  ??? is to Vanagon/Eurovan

   deer? nah, too big (relatively speaking). have to be a Possum!! :)
   or maybe an Armadillo (Possum on the half-shell).  yeah, armadillo ...
   same hard shell as the bug. did you know why so many 'dillos lay dead
   on the roadside? it's cause of their reflex action to be frightened:
   they jump straight up!  not a good idea when a car/truck is passing
   overhead.

Another Nature Tip, from Ranger Joel. :)

serious note:
folks, SOME of us are really ready for a vacation. i think you all know who
you are.
