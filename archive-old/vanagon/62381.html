Subject: A/C cures for Westy's

Volks,
Having dealt with the dilemma of trying to cool the air in my 82 diesel
Westy for some years now in Baja Calif, I've come up with this:
I use a Toyotomi 4000btu portable air-conditioner inside the van. It's the
most efficient, small A/C unit I've found.
That coupled with a Honda EX 650 mounted outside on either the front or
rear bumper. It uses .5gal of gas every 4 hrs. Is so quiet no one notices
it's on. 

With this setup, my 1.6L diesel isn't over taxed ( more overtaxed, I should
say) and I've got air whenever I need it.

Works for me.
