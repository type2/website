David...have you read Road Fever by Tom Cahill? Its a story about a
similar journey done in less than 30 days from the tip of Southa
America to the northern tip of Alaska.

I only mention it in that it seems that there is a shitload of
paperwork, etc that they had to go thru to get through the
various countries, etc. and maybe this will give you an idea of
the things you may need to do to complete your trip.

The book is now in paperback for about $4.00 US....
