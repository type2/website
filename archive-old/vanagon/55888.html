&gt; Hello from a sad, off-the-list vanagoon.  During last Februarys deep freeze
&gt; (here in Minnapolis), my master clutch cylinder and slave cylinder leaked.
&gt;  I had the master rebuilt (according to the guy who did the work) and
&gt; replaced the slave (a $90 part).  This week I had my vanagon towed to the
&gt; dealer because I had no clutch.  Guess what? The dealer claims that master
&gt; and slave cylinders leaked all the fluid, and they both need to be replaced.
&gt;  My friendly VW dealer will gladly perform these services for about $650.
&gt;  That's just out of the question.  Sadly, I'm wondering what my options are
&gt; and why I'm in this same situation.  What's up with clutch cylinders in the
&gt; winter?  I understood that old hydraulic fluid could have absorbed moisture,
&gt; expanded in very cold weather, and caused last years problems.  But the
&gt; fluid should be only a year old...  Please advise, I can't carpool much
&gt; longer...  I'm off the list, so direct replies would be appreciated.  Thanks
&gt; very much in advance.  Tim C. (tcasey_at_hdrinc_dot_com)
