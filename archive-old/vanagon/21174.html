Subject: 61 Owner's Manual &amp; VW Fairy....


There must be a VW fairy....I went into the office tonight to check
my campus mail and in it was a large envelope. I opened it up...shook
out its contents and out popped a 1961 Instruction Manual for Transporter
in Very Good shape!

In the envelope was a note: &quot;I heard you like VWs...I don't know where
I got this from as I never had a VW Van...perhaps it was the VW fairy.&quot;

The note was unsigned....


HHmmmmmmmmm.......
