Subject: Re: air-cooled maintenance...

&gt;Pulling my engine over the weekend, I found a paper towel sucked into 
&gt;the inside of my fan.  It wasn't there very long (it was still very 
&gt;clean).  I'll be checking the fan (behind the fan housing) 
&gt;periodically now for any obstructions.....

Scarey to know that no matter how hard we try there's always some lurking
variable waiting to sting us.  Just thought I'd mention that if you have
your upright engined bus/bug parked outside for an extended period (who does
that?) you should be wary of rodents building nests in the fanshroud.  When
I removed the old engine that had been sitting in my 71 I decided to re-use
its fanshroud since it was in better condition than the one I had.  Though
the flaps worked well, out of paranoia I took them off and ran water from a
garden hose through the shroud.  Out popped all sortsa nest material.  

I think the trick is never stop the van long enough to pick up &quot;unwanted
passengers&quot;--just keep on movin'.  I suppose you'd still have problems with
bats and flying squirrels, though.
