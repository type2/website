Subject: Joel!!! Change the stats!!!

Joel and all,

Change the stats!  Now there are 2 buses in OR, NE.  I (We) own them both.
Tonight I finalized the purchase of what I thought was a Westy.  It's not,
but that's okay.  What it is is a 1977 Riviera Campwagen.  I've never heard
of it before, but I think I like it better than a Westfalia.  The 3/4
length roof raises straight up instead of tilting giving at least 6'5&quot; of
head room (I'm 6-2).  Has Norcold 12/125v reefer, Coleman 2 burner range
and FORCED AIR FURNACE!!  Bought it from the second owner for a fair price
and we'll get to keep the vanagon for comparison. (Now I've owned all three
types of Type II's)

Has anyone ever heard of a Riviera Campwagen before?  Made by Automotive
Services Inc., Vancouver, WA.  The warranty says that any claims will be
handled by VW so... (Yeah, it came with a bunch of the original
documentation.)
