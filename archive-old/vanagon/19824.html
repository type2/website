Subject: 79 Bus--re unplugging drains and fixing turn signal

I've got a 79 bus with a metal sliding roof that I just rebuilt so that it is
now functional.  I, however, have been trying in vain to clear out the four
drain pipes.  I've tried flexible cable (video coaxial), air pressure, coat
hangers, to no avail.  

Any advice or tips on how to clean out these pipes would be appreciated.

Also, just this evening, my turn signal started acting up.  It blinks a few
times, then stops.  The little green indicator on the dash stays lit, but the
lights outside do nothing (not lit).  

How should I troubleshoot this problem....better yet, does anyone know what
the problem is?

Thanks.
