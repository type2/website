Why don't we take this annoying urban diehard stuff and put it in our
vw-blender?
It would thus read:

vw revenge

Okay everyone. . . . a true story of gullibility in the good old U.S. A.
Thought y'all might enjoy this. My daughter and I had just been driving down
route 66 in our VW splittie, when we noticed a clanking sound coming from
the engine department. Because our family are such vw lovers, we decided to
try the &quot;VW of America maintenance engineers.&quot;  They were so excellent that
I asked if they would give me the CDrom with the blueprints and they said
with a small smirk, &quot;Like hell!.&quot;  Well, I said, would you let me buy the
CDrom?  With a evil smile, he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked how much, and he
responded, &quot;Two-fifty.&quot; I said with approval, just add it to my bill.
Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from First Digital and it
was $2259.95.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for
two gaskets and about $2000.00 for a tranny.
As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;CDrom - $250.00.&quot;
Boy, was I upset!!  I called VWoA's Accounting Dept. and told them the
mechanic said it was &quot;two-fifty,&quot; and I did not realize he meant $250.00 for a
CDrom.  I asked them to take back the CDrom and reduce my bill and they said
they were sorry, but because all the CDroms were this expensive so not just
everyone could start fixing their own engines . . . the bill would stand.  I
waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try to get any of my money
back.  I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to
have $250.00 worth of fun.&quot;  I told her that I was going to see to it that
every VW lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from VWoA for nothing.
She replied, &quot;I'll have to kill you.&quot;  I said, &quot;Sorry, but this is the only
way I feel I could get even,&quot; and I will.  So, here it is, and please pass
it to someone else or run a few copies . . .  I paid for it; now you can
have it for free.

Press play to start CDrom

Have fun!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story.  That's it.
Please, pass it along to everyone you know, single people, mailing lists,
etc. . . .

Sorry. Just couldn't resist. BTW, I would be quite interested if someone
could get hold of those computerized microfishers. Is it worth trying in
Germany? (seeing that I'm rather close, being in the north of Italy).
Wouldn't know where to look though.
