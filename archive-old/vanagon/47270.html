Bill,

do yopu have a brother that works at Rutgers??  Now back to the 
matter at hand.....there are only two mechanics that I would use in 
the central Jersey area...and I use them sparingly.  The first call 
goes to Bill Egenton at Foreign Car Werks on Rt. 28 in Bound Brook 
805-0907.  Bill is real honest....he was the service manager with VW 
in Princeton and I beleave that his dad {who now works with him}was 
also a service manager.  They are quite involved with the local vw 
community,  and best of all he will call and use other mechanics 
expertise to solve your special problem...****  a four star 
mechanic!!  ** two star costs!!

The other shop that I have used is Albert and Son  on Rt. 22 in White 
House...A four star GERMAN mechanic....with Five star service rates!
His problem is that everything is done strictly by the book which 
means every part that deviates from VW specs is taken out and 
replaced with the right part {$$$}.  Your Van will run perfect 
without a doubt,  he even makes house calls if there is a problem,  
but the cost is prime.  **** four star mechanic...****** six star 
costs!!!

If you are in the Lehigh Valley give L&amp;T Enterprizes a try....great 
for parts,  used that is,  and  they have never screwed up {replaced 
my motor at 100K and the Tranny at 135K}  and their rates are super.
610-264-9191.
*** three star mechanics, ** two star costs.
