Last year I tried (with the help of my Official VW Vanagon manual) to
remove the center two seats from my 86 Syncro Vanagon 7 passenger.  I
found that there was some type of heavy duty channel that the seats slid
on but could not see how they could be removed entirely without removing
the channel also.  There is a wood insert on top of the metal floor pan
inbetween the seats and the sliding door.  The wood piece appears to be
one piece covering the entire floor pan except where the middle seats
are.

Also, is there a source for finding the seat swivel mechanism? and is it
compatible with my van?

Finally, the stock low beams are very weak!  Is there an aftermarket fix
to get more light short of adding separate driving lights (which, I am
told, are not legal in conjunction with low beams).

I look forward to your help.
