Subject: Raising the front end for coolant bleeding
Date: Sun, 11 Dec 94 8:59:47 PST

How's that for a title. ;)

Well yesterday I tried lifting up the front end of the my camper
so I could bleed the system.  I was stumped though cause in the
book, they say to use a jack and a board to lift at the jack
points.  Well I have one jack and I couldn't see any way to 
jack up the car with a board.  I though about using the jack
stands and jacking up each side but they don't go high enough?
So I went to the other house because it has a slanted drive-
way.  I didn't take the time to measure the height difference
but it was pretty steep.  I went ahead and bled the system and
some air did come out.  Not much though.  I had some fun hunting
down a length of wood that would hold the accelerator at 2000
RPM when pressed against the seat just right.  I wasn't sure
how long to leave the bleeder screw open so I just opened it
till there were no more bubbles which wasn't long.  Then I 
realized I forgot to turn the heater lever all the way open.
So I opened it and bled the system again with no visible 
bubbles.

I still would like to be able to lift the front end on a flat
surface.  Any suggestions?  Do I need to get a larger set
of jack stands?   

Thanks for any info.

Steven
