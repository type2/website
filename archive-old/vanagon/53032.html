Pat,

Thanks for checking on me!  Yes I am currently running.  Didn't do a
dern thing to fix it.  Thus, my current situation is probably
temporary.  I did finish checking the wiring (for the 3rd time with my
very reliable multimeter) and no breaks.  I'm still suspicious of the
coolant system, however.  I've only taken the van on short trips in
town.  It seems to be getting warm very quickly (i.e. from here to the
post office, the needle gets to the light).  Does not get any higher and
fan doesn't come on, but seems to get there quicker than it used to. 
All you yankees, keep in mind that it's starting out at 65 or 70 down
here anyway.  I want to try to bleed the system again, but don't have
any antifreeze to put into it and think the coolant might be a little
weak as it is (when I swapped out the coolant temp sensor, more gushed
out than expected--used what antifreeze I had and had to use water to
finish filling it--probably a 30/70 a/w ratio.  Given the stuff already
in the system was 60/40, I should still be okay, probably around
50/50--but don't want to push it by adding more water.)  I have to go to
Baton Rouge to get the antifreeze I use.  

Now it may just be me and an overly sensitive ear, but I hear fluid
swishing about when I start the van moving (especially right after I
start it, backing up in the driveway).  It could be the fuel tank--only
about 1/3 tank of gas.  It sounds like right behind the driver's seat. 
I'm sure it probably is the fuel, but I don't recall ever hearing that
before.  Again, probably an over sensitive ear?  Anyway, that swishing
makes me leary of the coolant and the possibility of air.  Since I've
only driven it short distances, it may not be getting out of the closed
loop long enough to let the air pass to the expansion &amp; refill tanks.

Oh well, I go Christmas shopping next week and will probably put it to
the test then.

Thanks again for checking on me!

&gt; 
&gt;      Are you back up and running OK?  Haven't heard from you in awhile about the
&gt;      problems you were having.  Did you get them fixed?  If so, what was it?
&gt;
