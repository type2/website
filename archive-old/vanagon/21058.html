I would also have to agree with Al and that's exactly what I thought also.
But, yesterday, someone posted the results of a demo in their shop class.
Pouring water on a radiator raised the engine temperature till the water
was gone from the radiator.  I am unable to correlate the two ... but maybe
I haven't though about it enough.
