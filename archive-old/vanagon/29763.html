Subject:       It had to happen

Oh well:

Driving back on Sunday - heading up I-5. About 50 miles from SF
Cars start passing me-flashing their lights, waving etc.   SO i pull 
off to see what is what.

As it turns out, the muffler brackets had snapped (when??) so the 
stress on the exhaust pipes (rusted as they were) caused them to 
snap. Forutnately, the muffler, converter and O2 sensor were 
unharmed. However, I need to replace the pipe. ( My bus is not a 747 
although it sounds like it now!)  The piece that broke is the pipe 
that connects to the converter- This is an 84 Vanagon.  How much? 
Expensive (please no!)The bolts are rusted tight at both ends as well,
so if anyone can recommend a good liquid wrench that'd be cool too.

Thanks much!
