Subject: Vanagon parts for sale in P.R.

Hi fellows! There is a friend here in Puerto Rico that has a big stock of
parts of 70's Type II's and Vanagons (80-85). His name is PUCHO and you
can reach him by phone (809) 265-7901. I visited his shop today and saw
complete engines, trannies, a lot of hardware and three complete vanagons
for parts (or for sale). Make him a call in case you need something.

Peace!
