Subject: Re: EEEEK! Oil light flickering

The oil light and gauge is designed to come on at 5-7psi, a good rule of
thumb is 10 psi per 1000revs so 10 psi at idle is not bad. If the oil
light comes on at idle, don't be surprised if you are running 10w30 in the
summer; the crucial
thing is the minimum oil pressure at speed at temps of 80 C or less. this
should be about 28psi at 2000 rpm (or so says the manual)..... -- 

Virtually all the bug owners I know use 20w50 in temps above 50 F.....

I would have thought this problem would occur less frequently or not at
all in wasserboxers because of the additional cooling and regulation  of
temps.
