Subject: VW story and helpful hint.

Hi Volks,
   I had an interesting experience that I thought someone might enjoy.
Yesterday, on my way home for lunch I was getting ready to shift from 2nd
to 3rd when the motor made this horrible Bang the engine lost power. The
whole van started to vibrate.  I noticed the shifter got really loose and
the gas peddle went almost to the floor before engine would rev up.  The
dash lights started flashing and the seat belt buzzer went off.  I tried to
give it gas and it would bang again.  It was the weirdest thing I've ever
experienced.  At first I thought I blew up the engine.   Turns out the bolt
fell out of the front trans mount and the engine was rocking back and forth
banging against the body.   While lying in a slush puddle, replacing the
missing bolt, I noticed the ground strap from the trans to the body was
snapped off.   While driving around makeing sure everything was OK the dash
lights kept flashing and the buzzer was still going off.   So I replaced
the ground strap and everything is great.  The point of this story?   Well,
back over the summer once in a while the dashlights would flash and the
seat belt buzzer would go off.  I also noticed a couple of posts with Volks
having similar problems.  So I thought that perhaps if you have this
problem, you may want to check that ground strap to make sure its making
good contact.  While your down there, make sure that tran mount bolt is
tight.=) Take care.
