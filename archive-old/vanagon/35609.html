Subject: still Westy hunting in BC...

Hello all,

Finally sold off my '82 Scirocco to make space for a Westy... but 
nobody seems to have a nice one for sale around here...

I've been looking for 6 months now with no luck. If anyone sees one 
for sale in Greater Vancouver, or Victoria area, please let me know!

These are my choices, in order of preference:

'80-82 2.0L Westy with little or no rust, good running.
'80-82 2.0L Westy no rust, but needs other work.
'82-83 Diesel Westy with little or no rust
'78-79 Westy with little or no rust.

Price range I'm considering is $4000 - $7000
Must be deluxe model, ie: fridge, stove, sink, in working order. 
I'm willing to consider a bus needing work if the body/interior is 
good and the price is right.

TIA.

Shawn.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
