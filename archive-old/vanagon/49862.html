&lt;&lt; Believe it or not, covering a vehicle is not a good idea! &gt;&gt;

Eric, obviously you do not live in SUNNY SOUTHERN CALIF, where the sun eats
your vehicle sometimes worse than that Pa. salt! Ive had my 84 covered for 12
years by a cover made at No.Coast Tarpaulin Works in San Diego, and my orig.
paint still looks great.
