&gt; That said, with all the buses burning to the ground, engine and electrical
&gt; problems I've read about, I'd like for list members to tell us why they
&gt; stay with VWs -- some more positive messages, for balance.
&gt; 

I could make a stab at this.  First off, I think it is unfair for us 
to compare 20, 30 and 40 year old vehicles to anything made in the 
last 15 years.  I'm not saying you did, just that it seems to be the 
underlying concept in the 'should I get into this' question.

If you want something that will start every single time and always get
you where you want to go with a heat and cool on demand and a nice quiet 
ride to boot, then buy a new van or car and trade every few years.  
That will solve your tranportation problems, money issues aside.

I can't tell you if this is right for you.  I can tell you why I do it
and how it came to be, and you can do some similar thinking about 
yourself.  I was without a car for over six years.  Mostly I couldn't 
afford a car.  Later, it became an obsession.  Still is I guess.  My 
bus only moves on the weekends.  I bought my bus completely on a whim,
from a friend.  Six months later I found myself in need of an engine. 
I didn't really need a vehicle but I had grown accustomed to camping 
in those six months.  The long and the short of it is that I decided I
could only afford it if I did all the work myself.  Of course, this 
required that I purchase quite a few tools.  All of the tools I need 
to fix anything on my bus cost less than the taxes on most new cars.  
Anytime, anyplace, I can spend about $1,500 and have another 80,000 
miles in a new engine.  Three or four car payments.

The key to all this is for me is doing the work myself.  I do think, 
however, that you could still pay a mechanic and have a reliable 
vehicle for less than the price of new one.  If you were to keep a 
fresher engine in there and keep it tuned and learn to adjust your 
valves and brakes you could drive it anywhere.  Anywhere.  You might 
be a little slower and a little colder but you will have the knowledge
that you are living the experience.  You are the master of your own 
destiny.  When it stops you pull over and fix it.  Everything on the 
vehicle was designed so that it could be replaced.  It breaks, you fix
it, and move on.  Easier than you think.  What are you gonna do when 
the fuel injection on your '94 Lumina goes whacky?  You are going to 
call somebody.  Trust your destiny to them.  As for me.  Hand me that 
screwdriver, I have places to be...
