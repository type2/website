&gt; 
&gt;   I just got this from a friend ... enjoy!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   &gt;Stupid Human Trick ...
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;OUCH!  don't try this one at home, now, kiddies!
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;&quot;Darwin award&quot; Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards -- it's
&gt;   &gt;an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest
&gt;   &gt;service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.
&gt;   &gt;Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke (tm)
&gt;   &gt;machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip
&gt;   &gt;a free soda out of it.
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;And the nominee is:
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal
&gt;   &gt;imbedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, at the apex
&gt;   &gt;of a curve.
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a
&gt;   &gt;car.  The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene.  The boys in
&gt;   &gt;the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened.
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted
&gt;   &gt;Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy
&gt;   &gt;military transport planes an extra `push' for taking off from short
&gt;   &gt;airfields.  He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and
&gt;   &gt;found a long, straight stretch of road.  Then he attached the JATO
&gt;   &gt;unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the
&gt;   &gt;JATO!!  Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between
&gt;   &gt;250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve....  The
&gt;   &gt;brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the
&gt;   &gt;car.
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt;(NOTE: Solid-fuel rockets don't have an 'off'... once started, they
&gt;   &gt;burn at full thrust 'till the fuel is all gone.)
&gt;   &gt;
