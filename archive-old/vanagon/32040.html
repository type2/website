Um, perhaps my previous post concerning Rt.66 was slightly misconstrued.  
I'm OFFERING information on The Great Road, cuz I live here, just a 
couple blocks from it.  

SO, if your 1996 travel plans include Oh, Fair New Mexico (official state 
song), don't hesitate to drop me a line.  I'll tell all--where the best 
dive motels are, why that lady sauntering down Central keeps staring at 
you, where to find authentic cuisine, the parts NOT to be on too late on 
a Saturday night, and if the ass which bears you needs work, where to 
go.  

Yep, that's it.
