&gt;What about a late model Vanagon Wolf. Edition (1991?)
&gt;Are there other options that provide the features I like?


The following Vanagons have the layout and features your looking for with the
exception of not having a water sprayer.

1987 &amp; 88 Wolfsburg Limited Editions 
1989 Carat and Carat Wolfsburg Limited Edition
1990 &amp; 1991 Carat
1990 &amp; 1991 Multivan ads to Carat models the pop-top

All have the 2.1L wasserboxer engine.
                        
&gt;I don#t have lots of $ resources and I am not a mechanic.  So I
&gt;want a sound engine to begin with and now of any special needs
&gt;or problems.  For instance, I spoke with a lady this past weekend
&gt;who owns a 1987 Vanagon Wolf. Ed.  And loves it!!  But,
&gt;she told me of a situation about the water.  Something about the.....

Yes, there is a problem with corrosion along the head gaskets causing water
leaks.  It generally takes several years and 60,000 to 130,000 miles for the
problem to occur.  When the leak occurs the heads need to be replaced
(possibly repaired) at a cost of up to $2,300 complete at a dealer.  Doing it
yourself  is much cheaper, but not a real simple job.  I like my Vanagons so
much, that I've just resigned myself to the fact that I'll have to live with
it.  Even $2,300 is only 2.3 cents per mile if the heads last 100,000 miles.
 Some have gotten well over 150,000 miles from the original heads, but this
is not common.  Changing coolant every 2 years or sooner seems to help.

Good luck,
