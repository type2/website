Subject: the bizzare

I've got a problem with my '78 bus which is very interesting, but 
unappreciated.It goes like this: If the engine is running, and if I pull 
on my lights, and push down on the brake pedal, I can turn off the key 
and pull it out and put it in my pocket, etc., and the bus will still be 
running. Not dieseling, mind you, but running, as in I could drive to the 
store and back, provided I didn't turn off the lights or take my foot off 
the brake (I didn't say I could drive to the store quickly).We can go at 
this problem a different way: If I start the engine (maybe if I just turn 
on the ignition--I should check), then if I push on the brake, the dash 
light comes on just as if I'd pulled on the lights. Take the foot off the 
brake, and off go the lights. You see what I mean. So there is a short 
somewhere, and it involves three things: ignition, brake (lights?), 
headlights (switch?).I should mention that if I have the engine running 
and the lights off and put on the brakes, the dash light does come on but 
not the headlights. Anyway, the bus runs fine, but I'm afraid the short 
is a bad thing waiting to get worse. I have looked a bit, but without 
luck. Has anyone ever had this kind of problem? Does anyone know exactly 
where I should look? Does anyone (I'm starting to dream) know not just 
where to look, but which wires (color, please?), exactly, are likely at 
fault? I'm easily confused. Please help me.
Regards,
Paul Sogge
