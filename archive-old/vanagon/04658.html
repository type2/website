Martha gynoamericanly fires back:

&gt;Persons of gender do not sit idle; it's just that we think longer 
&gt;before we speak than persons of non-gender  ;)


NON-GENDER??? Sounds like a castration complex word if I ever hoid
one!!!   ;-)

Hey, its Wednesday....this past Friday was sooooo quiet...like the
inmates of the assylum went on a field trip or sumpin...got to get
things stirred up. 

Nothing personal, Martha...only for the sake of cheap entertainment!
