Subject: [1966] jump to the left, jump to the right...

The Gerbil's picked up this somewhat disturbing trick of jumping left
or right when the front wheels hit small bumps (say, a big rock, or a
particularly ill-applied road patch).  Effectively, it's like making
an immediate 15 or 20 degree course change.  The jump is not apparent
in the steering wheel -- it doesn't jerk when the jump happens,
although you have to move it quickly in the other direction if you
didn't plan on changing lanes just then.

To me, this just screams king pins.  The question is, is likely to be
something adjustable, or should I just be planning on replacing a
non-trivial fraction of the front suspension?  I'm hoping the former,
as I'd like to do a 500 mile camping trip at the end of the month, and
last I checked, the relevant parts weren't readily available on an
overnight basis.  The work would probably be done by a local shop, due
to lack of time and self-faith.

Comments?  The Gerbil is a 1966 Microbus.
