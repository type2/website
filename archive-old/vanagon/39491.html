This sounds great, i assume this would be almost the same as a locking
differential.  

I got stuck in the mud in December with one tire on concrete and the other
in the mud.  Could i just have crawled under the bus and disconnected the
side that was on the concrete, pulled the brake and gotten out easily?
Would i have had to release the brake peroidically so the bus didn't have to
drag a &quot;dead&quot; wheel?  

Curious,
