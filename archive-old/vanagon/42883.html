Hi,  I have a 93 Eurovan with an intermitent electrical problem.  It 
seems that occasionally the fuel level and temperature gauge stop 
responding and then start working again after a while.  This problem does 
not appear to be temperature related.  Also, when the gas tank is full, 
the fuel level show about half the correct amount (and the temp is 
completely at the 0 mark).  Anyway, I am searching for anyone with a 
similar problem that was able to fix it or a wiring diagram such that I 
can trace out the problem when it occurs next.  Anyone?????
