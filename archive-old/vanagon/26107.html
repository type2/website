Subject: VW FAQ Author?

I was reading rec.autos.vw the other day and came across the FAQ.  I 
tried posting to the author (sjohnson_at_ornews.intel_dot_com) and the server 
bounced the message back to me saying that the address was invalid.  
Anyone know the correct address and author?
Thanks for the help.
Jack
