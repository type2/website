Subject: Vanagon V6 info /L


Thanks, all for the tremendous outpouring of help, advice, etc!

Many have asked for more info on the '80 Vanagon with the Chey 2800 V6.
Hope this fills the bill for now, till I see it with my own eyes:

According to the PO:

1.) Engine is from a Chevy Citation, early 80s I would guess. Installed
with an adapter from KEP (Kennedy Engineered Products). KEP's adapters
don't include the rear engine mount. PO fabricated one, using the
original VW rear engine hanger beam.

2.) The KEP adapter is designed to use the original '80 Vanagon clutch.
It actually uses an original VW flywheel, where the center has been cut
out by Kennedy and a plug fabricated and welded in to match the Chevy
crankshaft. So, VW clutch fits.

    KEP says that, for the 2800 Chevy, the original VW clutch is acceptably
strong (they find that it is about a 1600# clutch). They do offer stronger
clutches, and for engines bigger than this 2800cc, they recommend the
beefier clutch (1700, 2000, up to 3300!).

3.) PO says he drove the bus from Springfield MO to Colorado and back,
and it had great power, tho the engine was kind of noisy. He attributes
this the the high RPMs due to the high gearing of the (unmodified) VW
transmission, still set up for te 2000cc VW engine. I would guess that
gas mileage probably suffered some due to these higher RPMs.

PO says he put 225/75R14 tires on the rear in an attempt to simulate
taller gearing. The difference was marginal at best.

I once owned a 1982 Nissan Stanza 5-speed. Made a long trip over mostly flat
ground, pulling a small trailer, filling up every 250 miles or so. For one
250-mile interval, I ran in 4th gear entirely to let the engine work a
little less hard, and got 24 mpg for that leg. For the next leg, ran in
5th gear entirely. Same speed, same terrain, same weather, whole nine yards.
That leg got 30.4 mpg. Astonishing what a difference lower engine RPMs made
to that car! I suspect the impact is similar to most cars.

4.) On the COlorado trip, the PO says he did some off-roading (?). Several
times he had to slip the clutch a lot to do whatever. The clutch was the
original that he unbolted from the old VW engine and bolted on to this
engine, had maybe 90K miles on it. By the time he did the CO trip, it had
20K more. It started slipping when he DIDN'T want it to, and he limped all
the way home to Missouri (ouch!) with it. Now, the clutch is completely
shot (duh!)-- when you put it in gear and let out the pedal, it's as if you
didn't let the pedal out at all-- bus just sits there. Anyone want to guess
what condition the flywheel is in right about now?

5.) Bus has a console heater from a Volvo in the back, which pumps out
a lot of heat, he says. No front heater presently-- yet! To get it home
thru the ice and snow and big bad wolves, I may tape some dryer ducting
or something to the heater in back, and run it up between the front seats
to warm my tootsies. Tacky as hell, I know, but it's just for this trip.
For long term, I may get an aux heater from another car, or maybe one of
those standalone black box radiator-water heaters from JC WhipMe. Had one
of those in a Datsun Wagon once-- it was a blast furnace! GREAT heat.

6.) For a radiator, the PO got the radiator from the same Chevy the engine
came out of, and fabricated some mounting brackets to mount it inside the
front sheet metal of the Vanagon. He installed the front grille from a later
Diesel Vanagon, and some REALLY long radiator hoses. Also put in a 
water-temp
gauge in the dash. He says it ran all the way to Colorado and back with no
overheating.

7.) There's a problem with the front steering rack on this '80 Vanagon. All
vanagons had rack &amp; pinion steering (a major change from '79 and earlier
breadloaves). The PO says that this rack is very worn, with a LOT of play
in the steering, and the front wheels actually shimmy at some speeds. 
Probably
exactly the speeds I want to use on the trip home. One of the front tires
is wearing pretty badly, he says. A new rack is $450, he added. (!)

I looked at an '82 vanagon here yesterday. The rack is right out in the 
open,
just ahead of the front axle. It attaches to the tie rods via 
ball-and-socket
joints. Talked to a VW guy here, and he said that it is very rare for the 
rack
itself on a Vanagon, to wear out. What's more common, is for those ball-and
socket joints to wear. They have boots over them but the boots often get 
torn,
and then the joints don't last long after that.

The good news is, those joints are part of the tie rod, not part of the 
rack.
Kragen/Checker claims to have them (&quot;inner tie rod end&quot;) for $23 each. Other
sources go up to $60 or so. Still beats the cost of the rack, if the PO's
info was correct! I hope that it's the joints that are toast, rather than 
the
rack. Of course, if those wheels have been shimmying long enough (as tire 
wear
seems to indicate), the rest of the front end might be pretty beat up. We'll 
see.

Misc.: A few small oil leaks around timing chain covers, valve covers. A 
list
member (Bob Hufford, OK if I cite your name here?  :^)   ) has looked at 
this
vehicle, and listened to the engine run, tho he couldn't drive it due to the
bad clutch. Had no way of knowing about the rack. He said (in a public post
on this list) that the installation was fairly clean-looking, and the engine
sounded good, tho this doesn't guarantee power or drivability. PO says the 
engine
was rebuilt when he installed it about 20K miles ago, and balanced, and runs
very well.

Bus is yellow and orange in color (my most unfavorite VW color combination,
but what the hey), and is generally pretty clean, with only a few minor rust
spots. Interior is said to be pretty nice, has all seats (7-seater 
walk-thru,
middle seat is currently in the PO's garage), no torn upholstery.

PO says he will install the new clutch for me (I've sent parts to him 
already),
and will resurface the flywheel, which I'll pay for. Hope no problems show 
up
there. I'll ask him to have a look at those tie rods next time I call.

Not a lot of difference in possible route, from what I've heard. One list
member says there's a fairly flat route from Austin TX to AZ. Beyond that I
don't know. Anyone have experience from, say, Phoenix to San Diego?

Well, that's all I have for now (and there was much rejoicing). Will post
more, hopefully not as long-winded, when I have it.

Thanks for all the list support. vanagon_at_lenti forever!
