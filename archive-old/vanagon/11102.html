I can think of many funny posts.  What about the midly stroked counter
weighted crankshaft thing?  Was that on this list?  I hope it was.  
There was that story about the guy and his buddy who ate their entire 
stash right before driving into Canada, only to have the clutch cable 
break at the check station.  Ahh, the memories.  While I am at it:  I 
fired up the bus last weekend and drove the cat to the vets.  For 
reasons I won't go into, this was nice because the bus is only good 
for short trips of less than a few miles.  I thought of the cat in the
coat thing but that is only good for a few blocks.  So, I was sitting 
in the bus reading my first NEATO newsletter (thanks Tom!) while the 
SO was in there with the cat.  It was freezing but it beat the hell 
out of a waiting room full of kids and their sit pets.  Besides, I had
Click and Clack on the radio lambasting a guy for thinking about 
buying a micro bus.  So, I was sitting there for a while and then 
somebody came and went and the front door the vets office was at a 
slightly different angle and I had a full view of the front end of the
bus.  It was almost like when you were a kid at the barber's and you 
could see yourself in that mirror and then the next, ad infinitum.  
Kinda like it might be like meeting a RHD bus on the road.  Ok, it 
wasn't funny, but it was a cool VW moment for me.  :)
