Subject: Re: EV Winnebago Defrosting - LACK OF

What did Winnebago do to ruin the EV?  I just drove my EV MV home in a 
near blizzard last night.  I was sweating up a storm.  Windsheild wipers 
and defrosting are not the best but heck it was a near-blizzard.  1 to 2 
inches of snow an hour.  Temperatures I think were fairly comparable 10s 
and 20s F. The kids (who ride in the back) are always telling me to turn 
down their heat.  Only the one vent that is behind the passenger front 
seat - but this matches all the old buses doesn't it?
   
Sure you had the controls set properly?  Seriously.

Sucker can roast a turkey in the cabin front or rear at any outside 
temperature.

&gt; Well, after 2000 km in my new EV Winnebago, I
&gt; am pained to tell the list that the heating
&gt; and defrosting is horrible.  We went skiing
&gt; yesterday (-20 C a.m., -14 C p.m.) and spent
&gt; the three hours of driving, scraper in hand,
&gt; just like the old beetles we had.
&gt; 
&gt; Funny the things you don't notice standing in
&gt; the showroom - there are NO heater ducts or
&gt; outlets in the rear!  All of the front vents,
&gt; even with the vaunted recirculating feature,
&gt; can barely keep the windshield and side windows
&gt; clear - and this with the fan on level 4!

What does the Winnie put behind the front passenger seat?  Thats where VW 
ran the heater vent.  Right on the 2&quot; step between the front and rear floor.

&gt; The (measured) temperature at floor level in the 
&gt; rear was 0 C!  Talk about frozen feet!  And I
&gt; traded in a 1988 Wasserboxer for this - that thing could 
&gt; cook eggs with the rear heater core.

Does the Winnie have the two place controls?  One heater and one A/C for 
front and another for the rear.

&gt; So this is a warning to anyone who might be
&gt; contemplating an EV Winnebago - if you live
&gt; in an area where the mercury dips, don't do it!
&gt; This thing is DANGEROUS!

Not mine....  Roasty toasty warm....
