I would be surprised if they didn't.  Do the dealers still stock masks
for Vanagons?

Wolf Masks do come with the antenna hole (mine does) - provided the
antenna was mounted in that spot.  You'd be surprised at the number of
Vanagons I've come across that have non-stock antennas mounted in any ole
place.
