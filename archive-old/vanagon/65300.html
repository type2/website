Troops,
The commute from hell to the new job, demanding schedule, and existence of
two other VW campers in the family strongly encouraged the purchase of a
&quot;real&quot; car for daily commuting. (A/C in the incessant 115F Arizona heat
etc). I called on a '88 Westy with a supposed 30K miles and A/C, priced at
lower than the going rate for several days with no answer. =((((
Looked at the Waterpumper VWs but couldn't afford the cost of anything with
less than a billion miles. General sticker shock with anything that had any
style.
I finally stumbled across a 3.8 V-6 A/C midsized &lt;Buick&gt; 4door Bluesmobile
from a Sun City citizen on Monday. The 27,000 original mile car looked
almost new. Power everything-albeit the blandness. It was a deal that I
couldn't pass up~ for our current needs. Now I will look like &quot;Grandma&quot; or
some misc. average middle-aged white guy on the road. I wonder if Buick
owners wave?
I have several pics that I can scan and hang on a simple URL this weekend.
Fly in for the Jerome event and drive it home!
