Subject: Engine compartment door hinge

Anyone know of a good way to effect repairs on a hinge whose mounting holes
have stripped out?  (the ones in the body, not the door)

I don't see any way to access what appears to be a threaded 'plate' in the
body above the door hinge, that the hinge screws thread into.  Someone said
I'll have to weld the hinge to the body, but would rather not get so drastic.
