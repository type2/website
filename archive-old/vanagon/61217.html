Subject: Jim's Vanagon repair in Hayward, CA

Does anyone have any experience with this shop? What are your impressions?
They have a White wasserboxer that the owner (a customer) plans to donate to
charity. I asked about buying it for parts and will update when &quot;Jim&quot; gets
back to me.
I had taken my van to Fred's Garage in Redwood City.
I was very impressed with them - honest, knowledgeable and thorough, but
couldnt work on my van till next week. Their labor rates are no longer $30 as
listed in the archive/directory, closer to $65.
