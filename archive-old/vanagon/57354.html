&gt; Has anyone had any experience with changing to synthetic oil.  I read
online
&gt;  that synthetic will usually leak more at first because it cleans out all
the
&gt;  wax around your seals, leaving behind shrunken dry seals.  It said in this
&gt;  article, not to worry because your dry seals will swell again and stop the
&gt;  leak.  I switched to a semi-synthetic around 800 miles ago and my engine
is
&gt;   really beginning to leak oil.  Does anyone know how long this should
last?
&gt;   Being that I have an air-cooled I am beginning to think I may have made a
&gt;  mistake, the smell is killing my girlfriend, she won't even ride in my
westy
&gt;  with me anymore.

I've used synthetic oil in 5 of my own personal vehicles and have never had
an oil leak.  Really, never.  
1. 1984 Rabbit GTi, switched at about 20,000 miles - no problems through sale
at 85,000 miles
2. 1986 Jetta GLI, switched at 5,000 miles (2nd oil change) - no problems
through totaling collision around 100,000 miles
3. 1982 VW Pickup-diesel (Rabbit style), switched at 60,000 miles - no
problems through sale at 120,000 miles.
4. 1988 Vanagon, switched at 5,000 miles (2nd oil change) - no problems
through today at around 120,000 miles
5. 1987 Vanagon Syncro, switched at 46,000 miles - no problrms through engine
replacement at 140,000 miles.  In used replacement engine - no problems
through today at around 9,000 miles since swap. Engine had around 30,000
miles when I installed it.

Good luck,
