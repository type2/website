i've stupidly deleted my info on how to unsubscribe from the type2 and
vanagon list. i'm going on vacation and probably won't have a job when i
return..gotta burn up those vacation days before they are gone! :-)

please unsubscribe me. thanks for your time.

if anyone sees a shiny orange '77 westy cruising I-40 West towards black
mountain in NC, honk and wave! it'll be me!
