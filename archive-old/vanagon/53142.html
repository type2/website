Yea! Finally!!!!!!

The '80 Vanagon finally went bye-bye yesterday! Although I had to act as the
First National Bank of VanBondo for awhile, the kid made all of the payments
right on time. He gave me the last payment and (against my recommendation)
drove it on down the street with no plates, no registration, no emissions
cert. and no insurance. &lt;eek&gt; That was *the* hardest vehicle sale that I
have ever had to make. It took a YEAR to sell! Meaning that it took forever
to sell. 
The second hardest was a nice '62 Pacific Blue &lt;light blue&gt; Ghia Coupe that
took several months after the first of the year.
