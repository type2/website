&gt; I am not exactly sure what your talking about becouse I only work on 
&gt; pre-79 buses, but if they are similar I have had great success using 
&gt; my 6&quot; needle-nose vise-grips just as eugene has.

I used needle-nose pliers to remove the thing which was no problem.  The 
only obstacle was getting them back onto the brakes.  I did learn that 
you should have absolutely EVERYTHING back before you try.  I was leaving 
a couple of spring for later, I hooked everything up and they went on 
much easier.  

I know have a question about self-adjusters.  It's been two days since I 
did the brake job.  I've done the backing up trick used for other 
vehicles and my brakes don't seem to be tightening up.  There was 
something of a lip around the drum, is it just going to take some more 
&quot;adjusting&quot; or do you think I put something back together wrong?
