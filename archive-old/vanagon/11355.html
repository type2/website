So Jeff Martin,              Software/Network Specialist says:
&gt; Up north (I'm talking Northern BC, Yukon, NWT and Alaska) the only
&gt; really reliable transportation is a Dog team :-). I read once and
&gt; I quote from the book, some elderly eskimo describing snowmobiles, &quot;Give
&gt; me a dog team or nothing, if I'm stuck in a blizzard with no food, have you
&gt; ever tried to eat a carburator?&quot;

Well no.  But I've them pee gas on me though.  ;)
