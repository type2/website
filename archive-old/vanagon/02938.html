Subject:      Parting out '64 Transporter

Pardon me if this is considered advertising on the net - I'll call it
information:  I've got a 1964 Type II for sale in whole or parts.  The
undercarriage is rusted and engine is shot (of course) - otherwise, it
is in good shape, especially the interior.  The vehicle is located in
Lexington, Kentucky.  Contact me if interested (or to tell me that this
sort of info is not welcome on this list).
