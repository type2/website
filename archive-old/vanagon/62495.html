Subject: RE: Eurovan reliability

My '93 EV MV (92K) has been the least reliable car I've ever had - but the 
problems have not generally been crippling. Still like the car, but it's no 
Vanagon. Problems include:

1.	Rear A/C quit cooling - solenoid valve in rear coolant line replaced under 
warranty. Dealer had 3 other cars with same problem. Intermittent problem 
since - but it is working now.

2.	Front &amp; Rear A/C independently lost 3 lowest speeds - both use an identical 
resistor pack to lower fan speed, and a thermal fuse on the pack tends to fail 
after time. Replaced 3 so far - $28 but easy to change.

3.	A/C compressor intermittent operation - poor contact at connector on 
compressor. (Always worked OK with shroud off underside, so hard to find.)

4.	Instrument circuit problems - gas and temp gauges must share a supply 
circuit - both drop 1/4 reading - rise again if you push in on the panel.

5.	Intermittent starter circuit problem - at times no starter - wiggle 
shifter, etc. try again and it works. Never able to pinpoint.

6.	Accessory relay intermittent. Sometimes after starting all accessories 
dead. Turn off &amp; restart - generally OK.

7.	Mirror mount partially failed, driver's side. Die casting cracked.

8.	Electric Window mechanism broke so window fell to open position. Fixed 
myself, then VW did a recall.

9.	Auto transmission (my first car with one in 30 years) replaced under 
warranty.

10.	Control unit replaced under warranty (the real problem with the 
transmission!)

11.	Engine mounts now bad. Local shop reports this is common. OK if you like a 
vibra-massage at stop lights.

12.	Head gasket now has small coolant leak! (and you thought only 
Vanagons.....)

13.	Poor cruise control tuning - surges a lot with light load - changed after 
control unit replaced, but still not up to US standards. (Vanagon much better 
too.)

14.	Many nuts &amp; bolts loosened or fell off.

15.	A/C compressor places unbelievable load on engine. Summer gas mileage 
drops to 15-16. Dealer said is normal. Commonly switch off A/C to merge onto 
highway. (Much worse than Vanagons.)

However the car is very comfortable, pretty well designed for repair access 
(haven't tried replacing engine mounts yet), and it will pull a 2500 lb boat 
trailer, if you turn off the A/C on hills.

Inept VW mechanics are a common problem now, as most dealers handle VWs as a 
hobby. Also, so few Eurovans came in to the US the mechanics don't know them. 
Wish Bentley would finish the manual.

If VW would offer an MV with VR6 I'd trade this in (and keep my Vanagons!)

&gt;I'm considering buying a '93 Eurovan MV with 5 speed and am wondering
&gt;about it's long term reliability. I used to have one which VW bought
&gt;back because of the many problems I was having (plus an inept VW
&gt;mechanic). Any comments and things to look out for?
