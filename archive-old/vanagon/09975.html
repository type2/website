Subject: Re: More on Westy Interior changes, '68-'72

&gt;Hm.  My '71 has one GIANT curtain that covers the windshield and both cab
&gt;doors and snaps in place.  You're saying it should have tracks?  Even for
&gt;the windshield portion?  I'm fairly certain mine didn't come with the track
&gt;curtains as I don't see any holes in the sheet metal where the track would
&gt;have been.  Mine DOES have a sliding track curtain over the sliding door,
&gt;though.  (And no, I'm not trying to start a flamewar.  ;-) )

Yup, I'll second the above description for '71 curtains. One big front one, 
sliding door one had a top track and elastic in the bottom with a small ring 
to fit onto a hook on the wardrobe. I do have a set of sliding front 
curtains, plastic tracks, ugly yellow curtains, (no plaid, dammit) which I 
pulled from a '69 Westy. It was a Euro version, no North Amer. 
certification.    tim s.
