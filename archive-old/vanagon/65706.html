Subject:      Re: Conversion Kits: Beware 1991 Clean Air Act!

&gt; &gt;I am looking for a conversion kit for a 1984 Westpahlia (water-cooled)
&gt; &gt;to convert it from fuel injection to standard carburetion.  this
&gt; &gt;obviously requires a new manifold, hardware linkages and, of course,
&gt; &gt;carburetors.
Thom et. al.,
Be careful, -very- careful in considering removing your EFI for carbs.
New EPA standards are being forced in from the Feds US wide (1991 Clean
Air Act) and are going to require that your van be smogged or at least
visually inspected. Carbs will not match the book on standard equipment
and therefore you will not be able to pass inspection and register you
vehicle.
Here in Texas, our state is already coming into compliance with the 1991
CAA and I have studied this -federal- program intently and one of the
main tenets is to get the old smoggers off the road. Period!
In fact the Chemical Plants, there are few around Houston, are allowed
to purchase smog credits from salvage yards that squeeze old smogger
cars. The title to your old vehicle now has smog-credit value to the
smog producing system (Chemical plants and industry in general) that are
being bought and sold.
Keep your Vanagon as close to stock as possible and maintain the system
or you could be in for a heartbreak later in getting everything back to
stock. Believe me, when this happens, the govt. (EPA) wants you
heartbroken such that you will throw up your hands and send your
'smogger' to the squeezer.
Keep it stock and Maintained!
