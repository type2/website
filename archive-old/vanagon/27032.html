Subject: Re: Best Dealer To Buy Parts From...

     I may be able to locate a couple of microfiche readers in the next 
     week or so.  If anyone would like the information, please e-mail me, 
     but don't expect an answer until after the 27th of Oct.

&gt;there is no excuse: all list members should get their own fiches.
     
I traded some computer room flooring for a 'fiche reader.
Now - where do I get the 'fiches? (aside from the one that Joel sent me a 
couple of years ago...)
