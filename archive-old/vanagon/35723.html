Subject: My new Westy - '82 diesel from Orlando (long)

     Well, I went to get the van this weekend. Just thought you guys might 
     want to hear about it...so, here goes!
     
     Sunday morning, I took the 8:30AM ValuJet from Dulles International to 
     Orlando International airport. Wa,lked out of the terminal at about 
     11:00AM. Went from 30 deg and six inches of snow to 60 deg and 
     wonderful weather in about 2 hours. Gotta love it!!!
     
     The soon-to-be PO was wating for me with the Van in the arrivals area, 
     and as I walked closer, I was pleased. I had negotiated over the 
     phone, based on his description. I took all cash with me in case I 
     needed to haggle, but all was as promised. The body and interior are 
     in great shape, and the stove has *never* been used. The original 
     plastic is still on the unit! Drove it aroung the airport for a few 
     minutes to try it out, and all felt well. Underpowerd beast, that 
     diesel!
     
     The deal was made. I handed over my pile of cash, and the now PO 
     handed me the title. He warned me to pick up some oil and antifreeze 
     ASAP. He also mentioned that it was overheating some. We shook hands, 
     and off I go. 1st stop was for oil and coolant. Next was McDonalds- 
     Valujet isn't much on feeding the passengers! Decided to eat there to 
     let the engine cool down. After lunch, at about 12:30, I headed north 
     for the 30 mile trip to the auto-train depot. 
     
     10 minutes in to the drive (city driving) the engine started 
     overheating badly. You see, the engine had a problem where it likes to 
     pump all the oil into the coolant, creating a milky paste for coolant. 
     Looks like that mix does not have the proper thermal properties to 
     cool the engine well. I pulled over to cool it off, and headed north 
     again after a bit. Made it about 2 miles before it overheated. I was 
     worried about not making the train, since it was past 1:00 and I was 
     to be there no later than 2:30PM. There was no doubt that I was not 
     going to make it at that rate.
     
     Found a local tow company in the yellow pages, and had them tow me the 
     remaining distance to the train depot. Driver made good time, and got 
     me there with plenty of time to spare. Tow cost was $85, and I tipped 
     the driver $15 for his efforts. (Add $100 more to the purchase price!)
     
     Train left right on time at 4:00PM. While the train has the capacity 
     to carry over 1000 passengers, it was almost empty. Less than 100 
     people, in all. In fact, there were only 5 other people in the same 
     coach as me! I spent most of the time in the glass-domed car, watching 
     the scenery, and studying for another of my MCSE (Microsoft Certified 
     Systems Engineer) tests I am taking next week.
     
     Arrived at Lorton, VA at 9:00AM, and the weather was cold. In the 
     low-30's, I would say. I decided to try to drive the Van home, 
     thinking that the marginal cooling system might fare better with lower 
     ambient teperatures. I thought wrong! :( Took me about 3.5 hours to go 
     the last 45 miles home, making three stops to cool off. During these 
     periods, I took the opportunity to inspect the Westy closer. Turns out 
     it has a factory-rebuilt engine, and runs great. Also has the aux. 
     diesel powered heater. The blower motor was not functioning due to a 
     missing switch. Rummaged around my tool kit I packed and used a wire 
     with alligator clips on each end to wire the motor in the high speed.
     Looks like I will need to re-cover the front seats. And the odometer 
     does not work-explains the low mileage,eh? Exterior has been repainted 
     the original color, prolly done by Maaco or Earl Schieb. 
     
     Got home at 1:30PM, really tired. Went to sleep. I have this habit of 
     not sleeping on things that move, so I was exhausted! Started working 
     on the van last night, and will detail that later....
     
     Until then!
