Subject: 78 (deluxe?) color scheme; dents vs. rust

Color Scheme:

I looked at a 78 bus yesterday that had a fairly solid body in an
unusual color scheme.  The exterior was 2-tone maroon (top) and brown
(bottom), with fancy stripes on the sides (orange, beige, and maroon).
Bumpers were chrome, and the window seals had the chrome trim.

The interior was totally mix-and-match, and I would like to know if
anyone can tell me the original color scheme.  What was there:
Interior panels were red with chrome trim (much of the chrome was
missing, but I bet it looked sharp once)--these were original.  Front
seats were brown, middle seat was grey, and rear seat was black.  All
floor mats and carpets are missing.  The front had a floor mat from a
68-72, and the kick panels are gone.  The dashboard, steering wheel,
plastic door vents, door handle guards etc. are all dark brown
plastic.

Has anyone out there ever seen a bus in this color scheme, and can you
tell me what the *original* seat color was?  I'm sure it was either
red or brown, but I'd like to know before I buy.  Does anyone know if
this was officially a &quot;deluxe&quot; offering of some sort?

Dents Vs. Rust:

This bus was fairly dinged up, all surfaces had dents/creases/
tears--nose, right front corner, sliding door, right rear fender, rear
bumper, rain gutter, pan under pedals, left front jack point.  Only
the left side was unscathed, but we discovered it had been in an
accident and had been fixed and repainted on the left side (good job,
too).  However, it has VERY LITTLE rust anywhere, just a tiny bit in
the wheel wells, not perforated yet, but getting there.

I've also been scoping out a 78 with a sunroof.  It is VERY
STRAIGHT--I didn't find *any* dings on it *anywhere*, but because the
sunroof has been leaking for who-knows-how-many years, it has a fair
amount of rust in the cargo floor and front wheel wells; you can see
the road wizzing by underneath.

If you had your choice--dents (not rusty) or rusty (not dented),
which would you choose?
