Subject: Need your advise responses

I would like to thank everyone who responded to my &quot;I need advice...&quot;
message. I received twelve responses which was much more than expected.
This just shows how worthwhile the list is!

Interestingly, many of you suggested that I just go ahead an forget
about repairing or replacing the powersteering rack and just go with a
manual steering rack. This is certainly worth considering. One
respondent suggested I check with Pep Boys if only because of their
'lifetime guarantee'.  I'll plan to call them early next week and see
what they have to say.

Right now, however, I'd like to find a reliable mechanic to work on my
Vanagon. I have neither the expertise nor the facilities to do the work
myself. So if any of you can recommend someone in Northern California
that'd be great. Ofcourse, the closer to Vacaville the better but I'd be
willing to drive 50 miles or so to get good service.

Again, thanks to all of you who responded......
