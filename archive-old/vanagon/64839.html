Subject:      More on Transporter, Caravelle, Multivan

 -Extended Version-

Michael asked me to forward this extended version. Forgive me, I
deleted a minor thing. But the chapter about SA Microbus has to be
modified. VW SA 15&quot; rims and 205 R 15 tires to fit the enlarged
front disk rotors. Body modification takes place at the rear side
windows (enlarged) and the missing trim line below them. More
details you will find in the vanagon archives testreports.

Thats it with german vanagon (or T3, transporter 3rd Generation) history in=

short form.

When Helmut forwarded the above stuff to the list this morning, he
asked me to include the South Africans too. Ok, as far as I could find
informations here it is:

South Africa:

They have a long tradition in building Volkswagens. They started about 1951=

with the beetle, delivered from Wolfsburg as CKD-Kits. CKD were &quot;Completely=

Knocked Down&quot; Kits in wooden boxes, they were assembled in the SA plant.
Later they started there own production, building at least beetles, busses
and Type 4s. Funny enough, there have been some years with a parallel
CKD-assembling of busses, parts produced in Brazil but right hand
drive (right hand drive? its wrong hand drive!!) for the
SA-market. The split-bus has been available down there up to 1976, parallel=

to the new model. But no hurry enthusiasts, those models shall have been
ultra-corrosive, even under the sun of SA they rotted away.

I have'nt got datas when they started with the vanagon-shape busses.
In 1995 they had three different models:

 -SA Volksiebus    The Basic Model. Passat (Dasher?) 1.8 l straight four
                engine, 72 kW (a little more power than a 2.1 digifant),
                manual 4 speed. Single round headlights, no a/c available.
                8 vinyl or cloth trim seats, fuel tank 85 l, 185 SR 14
                alloy 5.5 J wheels, 4 (bigger) sliding windows, SA styled
                dashboard.

 -SA Microbus      Medium priced model. Passat 2.6 l straight five engine,
                100 kW (compare it to the 2.1...). 5 speed manual. 205/65
                SR 14 alloy 6.5J wheels.
                Tinted windows, heated rear window, cloth trim and bolsters=
,
                power mirrors, rear wiper, central locking, power steering
                available, a/c available, twin halogen round
                headlights (RHD), alarm, digital clock, trip recorder,
                rev counter, front spoiler.

 -SA Caravelle     Top of the SA range. All the goodies of the Microbus
                plus power front windows, velour cloth trim and bolsters,
                foldable armrests throughout, rectangular headlights, power=

                steering, a/c, 6 speaker stereo r/c.



And what was coming from Mexico?

As far as I am informed up to 1995 the new transporter model (new since
the split) T2 (Transporter, 2nd generation) was made there.

In 1990 it was sold in three versions

 -Mex. Panel       Bay window model panel van with 1.8 l straight four
                engine 55 kW (a little more than a TD), 4 speed manual,
                electronic fuel injection, 185 SR 15 wheels, front radiator=
,
                mexican styled dashboard and plastic bumpers.
                Two/three cloth seats.

 -Mex. Combi       All windowed bus, basic version. Up to eight cloth seats=

                technical as the panel van. opening quarter windows
                all around.

 -Mex. Caravelle   The luxury version. 8 velour seats, digital clock,
                ashtrays, am/fm radio, make up mirror, automatic roll up
                seatbelts, two sliding windows, metallic paintwork,
                headrests for all seats.


&gt;From 1991 on all model had a new slightly higher roof (metal), four
sliding windows and 10 kW more of power (thats the range of a
2.1l digijet). The two, that I have seen in germany had a catalytic system
and were made in 95.


And what was on in Brazil?
They have done their own version of the VW-Bus since 1976, when the split
run out of production. But it has been a very special bus, mixture
of a split body with a bay window front compartment.

 - Braz. KOMBI     The basic bus again. 1.6 l upright engine, single or
                double carb. depending of the year. different rear axels.
                IRS rear axle system, but some years with reduction boxes
                (yes!!). some years with drum-brakes all around, but with
                power breaks, later years with disk breaks in the front,
                all front axles with king pins/link pins (22 mm diameter).
                Corner windows like a samba, small rear door, rear
                passenger doors split style, inner handles like pre 55
                barndoor splits. Little sliding windows available (fitting
                to splits), wheels depending of the year split/bay window
                styled. Front VW logo pressed in the body, rear bumper fits=

                down to 55-64 german model. spare wheel compartment like
                a split.

 -Braz. Microbus    Two toned paintwork, better interior.

 -Braz. Pick-up    Looks nearly as a bay pick up, but enlarged cargo-bed as=

                a standard item.

 -Braz. Pick-up    Looks nearly like the bay twin-cab.
 Dobel Cabina

 -Braz. Furgoneta  Panel van with split styled cargo-doors. Cargo-room
                vents like the late split panel van.

As far as I know production of these was up to 1995/1996, they are now
expecting the production lines from mexico to go on with the mexican model.=


Anybody out there with more or different informations? I would really like
to hear of you. We will be on tour with the westy for the next 2 or 3 weeks=
, =
hope
to meet you here again.

Best wishes
