Subject: '54 Deluxe Progress

I got a bunch more sandbalsting done, but tried a whole new technique:  open
air sandblasting!  I parked the bus on the apron in fron of the garage,
lifted it up, and went to town.  Plusses:  can get bus higher into the air,
so its easier to manuever underneath, and faster seup and teardown times;
Minusses: harder to clean the sand up afterwards, and can get a bit warm in
the sun.  I think the net productivity gain makes it worth the wasted sand.
Besides, now I'll get better drainange on the lawn...

Hopefully the new metal will be here in time to weld in this weekend.

I had a friend cut the sections out of the barndoor rear end I aquired.  I
decided to section it, since parts of the donor piece had modifications that
I wasn't happy to install on the host bus.  I have to finish cleaning up
these pieces and trimming them down, and i'll be able to weld them in after
I get the center longitudinals done.
