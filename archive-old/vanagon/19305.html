Subject: first drive with all the gauges(temps on 70 westie)

I drove to work this lunchtime,  The bus steady stated with an oil temp of
250 F and a head temp of 450, these seemed a little high. I was cruising at
3800 rpm
I think I may be pushing it a bit
when I idled the head temp dropped to 350F

The head temp seems to go up and down really quickly
tks for all the info
my owners manual syas that 65 is max and cruising speed I inferr from this
that max revs should be about 3600 and it could go to 4000 for a short while
