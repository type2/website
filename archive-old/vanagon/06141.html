&gt;I have seen similar plates from other states, but I don't know what
&gt;goes on there.

in alabama, the 'antique' plate costs about $30 ($25 tag, and $5 tax), but
you pay for it only ONCE. period. you never buy another tag for that car
ever again. if you sell it, the new owner simply pays another $30 to get it
transferred to their name.

the 'gotchas' are:
* you can't use it in a business (like Fred's Old Car Repair).
* you are not supposed to drive it more than about 100 miles per month. yeah,
  right. like they check. like ALLLLL antique cars have odometers. ;)

and that's it.

which is  really strange when you think about it. in a state where those cute
personalized tags cost an extra $50 (over and above whatever the normal tag
costs for your car are), and there are non-personalized specialty tags
(vietnam/wwii/korea veterans, helping-schools, save-the-whales, etc.) that
cost the same $50 more,  why would the state let someone get off so cheap?
beats me. maybe i got the DMV person on his valium break. :)
