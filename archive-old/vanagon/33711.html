&gt; Okay Joe,  lets look at this logically.  Obviously your bus is possessed by
&gt; evil spirits...see a priest.  Or else, you've been a bad boy and you're
&gt; being punished by God...again...see a priest.

The priest across the street occassionally has a visitor who drives a 
Syncro. One snowy day I walked out to check the depth on the bus and 
clean off the windows. He was doing the same. &quot;Nice bus!&quot; I told him.
He smiled, nodded, and replied &quot;nice bus,&quot; looking at mine. That would 
sort of be a blessing, right? 

&gt; 
&gt; But seriously,  Does the bus idle fine at all times?  Does this only occur
&gt; when you step down hard on the pedal in a hard acceleration or any time you
&gt; push on the pedal.

Yes, the bus idles fine at all times...and this only occurs when I push 
down hard on pedal. I can push slowly and get it to accelerate (raise 
rpms) fine, but when I'm at a stoplight, I can't get no satisfaction (and 
neither can the driver behind me)...that is, this slow acceleration and 
subsequent torture of my clutch doesn't get me out of the way fast 
enough. It appears to be more severe during the first 10 minutes of driving.

&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like the answer is not enough air or not enough gas.  I assume
&gt; that you've checked the carb by looking into the throat while someone steps
&gt; on the gas pedal to make sure gas is shot down from the accelerator pump.
&gt; To really eliminate the carb as a source of the problem, put the other carb
&gt; on and see if it still does the same thing.  If it does then we have to

Can't do it without a MAJOR rebuild to the other carb. It's so gummed up and 
stiff that it would brake my accelerator cable when I romped on it...and 
never return from the 4500 rpm rev.  Ahhhhhhh!!!! Hepme! Hepme! Kablam!!

Seeing as it's a Japanese clone deally, I'm thinking my money is better 
spent on other things than rebuilding this carb. 'Sides, I've already 
horked parts from it and I'd have to trade-back from the German 34PICT3.

&gt; look elsewhere for the problem.  Have you checked the air cleaner and tube
&gt; to make sure it's not blocked (like with a mouse nest).
&gt; 

Actually, no I haven't. I can, however, see the little counterweight 
dealy (how's that for a technical term) on the air cleaner raise up when 
I give her gas...presumably to increase the air supply. I think that's 
what Johnny89 referred to as going &quot;atmospheric.&quot;

&gt; WAIT!!!!! I just realized something.  Only after it's warmed up?  So when
&gt; it's cold and the choke is on and the mixture is fuel rich it runs fine?

right.

&gt; And when it's warm and the choke is open and the mix is right then we gots
&gt; problems?  Are you sure the choke is opening back up?  Lock the choke open
&gt; while the engine is cold and see what happens.  Drive it around and see

I'm sure it's opening back up. Thought about that and double checked. 
Details on this are a little fuzzy and many variables have changed, but I 
*think* she was running better with the choke out of adjustment (always 
closed) at one time. I tried this again recently, though, and the results 
were disappointing in the sense that I can't recreate the situation.

&gt; what it does when it's warm.  Also, maybe it's heat related.  Something may
&gt; be cuting off the fuel or air once it has expanded with heat.

That's a possibility, though the carb really doesn't get warm enough to 
experience what I'd think of as heat expansion. The other thing I'm 
thinking now is that once the bus is *really warm* (e.g., after driving 
10 miles), this problem gets minimal and I experience other problems...a 
sort of lugging or gas not firing on de-acceleration...almost like 
somebody with a small rope, tugging at the back of the bus. This happens, 
for example, when I let off the gas in third to approach a stop sight.

Hmmmmm......I wonder if the heat range on my plugs might have something to
do with all this. I've been looking at timing...and now at fuel/air. 
About the only thing left is spark. I haven't really considered the plugs
(though I have cleaned and gapped them), but they are from before I built
the top-end on this engine...and I am not possitive that they are the
proper plugs (one of those &quot;I need the plugs for a '71 bus. Thanks.&quot; buys). 

Thanks for the ideas!

Joe
