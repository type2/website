&gt; &gt;My question is how good are these for heat?  Are they reliable?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but they must be run every month or so year round to keep them 
&gt; in proper operating condition.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;fire hazards?
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, not really, if the safety devices are properly 
&gt; operating.  This heater has a number of safety mechanisms that are 
&gt; supposed to shut it down instantly in the event of a malfunction 
&gt; that can cause a hazard.  In my experience, the design is 
&gt; overcautious if anything; that is, it is more likely to shut down 
&gt; your heater when it DIDN'T have to, then fail to shut it down when 
&gt; it did have to. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Are they repairable?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.  Rudimentary repair info is in the Vanagon Bentley manual.  I 
&gt; have more detailed info if you need it.  There are several sources 
&gt; for parts, some of whom advertise in HotVW, VW Trends, etc.  
&gt; Junkyards are also an option.  (By the way, many parts are 
&gt; interchangeable with those from the BA4, which was stock in the 
&gt; type 4 and sometimes easier to find at a junkyard.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Should I disect mine to check it out?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. But be careful, as this is a gas furnace and could potentially 
&gt; be unsafe if incorrectly reassembled.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Do people use them for heat?  Is there hope for this one?  Any 
&gt; &gt;insight or other info you may have would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; I put one in my '77 Westfalia and was VERY happy with the heat 
&gt; output.  Better than the heat in my present water-cooled Westy, and 
&gt; no waiting for the van to warm up!
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;Are these the same as the &gt;BN4 or BN6s I see talked about on the 
&gt; &gt;type II list?
&gt; 
&gt; No, this is a BA6, which was optional on type II's from '76 on.  
&gt; The BN models were only used on earlier buses, and mounted in the 
&gt; engine compartment rather than under the vehicle.
