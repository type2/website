Hi my synro 87 gl is giveing me problems lately ......When you are going down
the road it makes this clicking noise and only when you accelerating and
deaccelating..not when your at a stop...but today if you push on the gas and
get almost to 3000 rpms it drops to 1000 and then jumps back to 3000 and
keeps doing this.....Wondering if anyone knows what might cauze this
problem...
Thanks
