Alright a wanna-EV!

(Cindy - Hang around and that will make some more sense as a joke....)

We're in VA and are darned happy with our EV MV.  I recommend trying to 
find an MV or MV Weekender.  More cost but worth it in my opinion.  There 
are some on the list who like the Camper versions - both Winnebago and 
Westfalia conversions.

Ric Golen the most vocal supporter of the EV is currently in France 
driving a European T4 (they don't call them Eurovans over there).

Hopefully you might hear from a more local person with a lead on an EV.

Too many folks around here seem to think the older backwards engines are 
better.  I disagree.  Cheaper I will grant them though.  They just envy 
our engine power, heat and A/C.

Got any particular questions?
