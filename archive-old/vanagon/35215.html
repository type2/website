Subject: hydraulic lifters

I have a '77 westy made in 6/77.  I once heard that VW switched to hydraulic
lifters 1/2 way through 1977.  I was wondering if there was a easy way to find
out if my bus has the hydraulic lifters.  Can they be seen by an inspection
of the engine?  Any help would be appriciated.
