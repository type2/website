 After siphoning the tank the fuel line was removed from the bottem of the
 tank untill no fuel came out.  After the tank was enpty (I banged on it, it
 was empty) my guage still said it had about 1/4 tank left and when it was
 refilled it took just under 12 gal to fill my 16 gal tank.  Where were the
 other 4 gal hiding? &gt;&gt;
  Is it possible that the tank was once upon a time damaged fron a floor
hoist or jack pushing in the bottom?  Some brain service people think the
tank straps are actually frame rails and they use those to lift the van.
 Belive it or not, my experience shows that 4 gallons is the amont of damage
and the gauge does not read empty due to the tank bottom now holding it in
the air.  Just a thought,

Dennis.
