I don't know if that's what the terminal is for, but whoever told you that
did know something about European cars.  Typically, when the ignition switch
is off in a European car, leaving the blinker stalk up or down will turn
on the front and rear parking lights on that side of the car.  When I was
living there I asked someone why this was, and they said that it was for
safety.  Europeans tend to park their cars on sidewalks alot (half on, half
off) and leaving the lights on helps to make up for the danger of leaving
their cars sticking out into traffic.  Supposedly, the running lights are
not bright enough to drain the battery if just left for a few hours.
