I've had KYBs on my '87 for some years with good luck. See the Bus Depot web
page for sale prices - about $28 last I checked.

For a real budget Rocky Mountain Motor Works now lists Brazilian shocks for
Vanagon at about $16-18. No idea how they work, but not much to invest and
easy to change.

I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific shocks.  I would
like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions and have a
frugal budget.
