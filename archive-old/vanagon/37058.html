&gt;&gt; Also, how difficult (time and tools) is it to replace a boot on the cv
&gt;&gt;joint?  Mine is cracked.
&gt;
&gt;I recently replaced the grease in two joints on one axle beacuse the outer
&gt;joint was clicking.  Removing, regreasing, and installing the axle took
about
&gt;2 hours.  This is lying on my back in the driveway - a shop with a pit or a
&gt;lift would be MUCH quicker.  I'd add about 1 hour to my time to remove one
&gt;joint, replace 1 boot, and re-install the joint.  You'll need an allen head
&gt;&quot;socket&quot; for a 1/2&quot; ratchet (I used a 3/8&quot; drive allen with a 3/8&quot; to 1/2&quot;
&gt;drive adapter) &amp; 6&quot; extension to remove/replace the axle.  I THINK you'll
&gt;need a vice, a hammer, and a c-clip tool to remove/install the CV joint
&gt;from/to the axle.                    ^^^^^^^^^^^

My circlip &quot;tool&quot; was a big screwdriver and a small needle nose pliers...
 works for me.  I'm sure the &quot;proper&quot; tool would work best, but sometimes you
work with what you have!  Vise is mandatory, especially when working solo.
