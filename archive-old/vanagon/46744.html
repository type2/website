!!! 10w30 is definetely the problem! I *never* run less than 20w50 
in the summer on my VWs - the gauge on my Jetta shows 10w30 causes a 
drop of up to 15psi oil pressure when hot. 
What's the ambient temperature there? Here it is 90-100F during the 
day, which calls for 20w50. I would go back to the shop &amp; insist 
they replace the oil with 20w50 at no charge, since they recommended 
the 10w30. If they don't, go elsewhere, since they don't know what 
they're talking about.
Since we seldom see below -5c (about 25F), I usually run 20w50 year 
round.
