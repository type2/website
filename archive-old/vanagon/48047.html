Subject: EV Ad in Seattle Times
Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 12:00:50 -0700

If anyone is interested, I called about the following ad in the Times:
 '93 EURO VAN - Papers, well maint'd, loads of extras, $14,500 obo, (206) 
316-0660
The owner said if he does'nt sell it in the next few days, he'll sell it to 
University VW. It is a EV GL with 73,000 miles, (mostly highway), Automatic 
Transmission, Cruise, AC, ABS, Ungo Alarm, Bra, and 6 CD changer. He's just 
put in new front brake pads, as well as a new windsheild in June. (Too many 
highway rock chips, he said.) And it has a blue exterior, which blue, I'm 
not sure. I'd go for it myself, but I couldn't unload the Golf III in time 
to meet his deadline.

Still Looking,
Matt Dekker
