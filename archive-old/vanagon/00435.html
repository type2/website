Subject: Alloy rim tires for sale!

-----------------------Tires For Sale!--------------------------------

Factory original Michelin MXL 205/70 14 (reinforced) tires
designated &quot;Radial X,&quot; type available as follows.  These
tires cost about $130 each at the dealer.  The first five are
from a 1990 Syncro Camper.  The second five are from a 1987
Syncro Camper. These are the 10 tires on which these two cars 
rolled out of the factory.

These are the tires for the alloy wheels.

The tread depth indicator line on these tires is about 0.2mm,
which is when they are used up and have to be changed.  A
new tire would have a tread depth of 0.75 to 0.80mm.

The last two tires are free to anyone buying the first 5 tires. The first 5 
tires go as a set unless I can match buyers. Add about $3 per tire 
(depending on destination) for shipping unless you arrange to pick these
up in person.
