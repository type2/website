Subject: RE:Vanagon Bake-Off~Nevada Race


&gt;It sounds like William Kennedy, Steve Maher, and Tom Forhan need to check
&gt;out today's Wall Street Journal.  There is a short article regarding a race
&gt;in Nevada where the average speed for the 1995 winning entry over the 90
&gt;mile course was something like 182 mph with a top speed of 205 mph in a
&gt;modified 1992 Corvette!  The article mentioned that the average speed 
topped
&gt;this year's Indy winners average speed.  Call me calloused from being over
&gt;gullible as a youngster but I find it hard to believe.

Is there anybody on this list besides the three mentioned above, who
hold to the (admittedly unpopular) notion that giving a VW van more power
than it originally came with, DOES NOT make it a race car?

It simply makes it a &quot;car&quot;, guys... able to do pretty much what other
ordinary cars do.

Well, I always knew this was a wild and crazy list. Finally we have come
full circle. Now the stock 4-cyl people keep bringing up the idea of
racing buses, and the 6-cyl guys are trying to cool *them* off! What a
country...   :^)


&gt;My Vanagon can only dream of half that speed.

So can mine, as long as I'm the one driving it. Older buses weren't made
for 100+ mph-- haven't got the suspension, brakes, tires, etc. to handle
it. A 30% larger engine doesn't change that... makes the bus more tailheavy
if anything, which certainly doesn't help the high-speed handling.

&gt;I am proud when the singlecab simply makes it over
&gt;a 90 mile course of any kind.

Gotcha there, Rusty... mine makes it over such courses with aplomb.
Of course, it occasionally finishes without a clutch...   =:-O
