&gt; More than likely, the mechanic didn't bleed your system of air
&gt; properly.  The light is a low-level indicator.  It has nothing to do
&gt; with temperature.  It is simple enough to do yourself, but I'd make the
&gt; mechanic do it on principal since he didn't do it properly to begin
&gt; with.  Also, the next time you get your coolant flushed, he might be a
&gt; little more likely to do it correctly if you point this out to him now.
Check your oil level too...if it looks like a milkshake creamy...then
you found out why you level of coolant is down.
Look for external leaks also.


&gt; Also, on the slim chance that his work was not done properly concerning
&gt; the heads, if you let him fix the air bubble problem, then he can't
&gt; blame you for fiddling around and causing a problem which was really his
&gt; fault.
