Subject: Re: Westy heating query

Richard, I have this great Hydroflame propane heater that fits in my 1986
ASI conversion.  The blower draws from the 2nd battery, and it seems to heat
the space with the pop top raised very quickly.  I think it is about 5K btu.  
It sits close to the floor below the sink, is quite compact, and seems to be
resistant to the terrible weather that our region can throw at it.

&gt;I'm wondering what (if anything) other Westy owners have done to provide
&gt;heat in the van while camping. I know the air cooled Westys had gasoline
&gt;heaters. But are there other options that can be used while camping 
&gt;i.e. propane, 12V DC, other??? Any suggesstions would be appreciated.
