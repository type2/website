Subject: Subject: Re: 1966 Split Bus - What Carb ?

This is probably a little out of date, but just had to respond to this one,
Douglas said last Wednesday that, &quot;The 1500 T2 split from VIN #216000001 (August
'65), used a 30 PICT-1. It had an automatic choke though!&quot;

Well my first VW, a 1966 Panel in Germany in 1973, had a factory stock 12V
electrical system, along with a factory manual choke.  This bus had a paint job
like a mail truck (Bundespost) with no interior finish in the back, but it did
have the divider with window between the front and back, so you could try to
keep the heat in a smaller area in an attempt to get warm.  Even though the bus
was only 7 or so years old, it already was cancerous in the rocker panels and
even the back floor.  Since I was an ignorant high schooler, I had no idea that
what I was driving was unique in any way, so when the tranny finally gave up as
a result of my speed shifting, I bought a '66 bug for $100 and the bus went to
the junk yard.

This just shows that VW was very flexible back in the 60's as to what kind of
equipment could be installed for a particular application, making generalities
just that.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunshine (my fifth bus &amp; seventh VW)
