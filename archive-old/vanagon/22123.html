Subject: refrigerator cooling


how low should i expect my refrig to go? so far the coldest ive gotten
is 44 degrees. that was after 24 hours with nothing in the box and at sun rise.
as the day wore on .. the temp then climbed to about 54 as the ambient air
climbed to 95.  

Should the refrigerator be doing better than this.  Im not sure it
would keep food from spoiling on a hot day, especially with a few
door open/close cycles.

comments?
