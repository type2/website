Here it fella.

you finished running your battery dead from a stereo left on?  Read on...

The original wiring harness was live to the radio (always on), so you're
&quot;repairing&quot; nothing.

If you want to really make your radio circuit cool and very operable, use the
circuit for your door buzzer relay.  This is very simple.  find and remove
the door buzzer relay.  Locate the socket in the relay/ fuse box that gets
power only with the key in the ignition.  run a wire from that socket to
power on your radio.  Use the stock red wire for the radio memory.  Your
radio only works when your key is in your ignition AND you get rid of that
Damned buzzer.  On all vaguely recent models of Volkswagens the red wire is
supposed to be live, black wires on with ignition,  solid brown wires are
ground.
