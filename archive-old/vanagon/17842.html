Subject: Re: 59 single cab question

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can I put my spare 1600 (70) engine into my 59 (If I make all the necessary
&gt;&gt; 6 volt conversion). The 36 hp sure looks tiny compared to the 1600. I havent
&gt;&gt; measured anything or actually thought about it a lot, but I saw a post were
&gt;&gt; someone said that this engine would more or less fit back to 55.
&gt;
&gt;You sure can.  I just put my 1776cc into my '57 Bus.  Now I know the 
&gt;purists out there are screaming &quot;blasphemy&quot; at me, but it sure is 
&gt;nice to have the exrta power!
&gt;
&gt;My only hangup was getting the proper starter which would mate with 
&gt;my flywheel on the clutch (since the 6v and 12v clutches have a
&gt;different amount of teeth where the starter hooks up.).


Not to mention the starter bushing in the trans case which is has different
ID's for 12v &amp; 6v, you can get adapters.

Eug,
