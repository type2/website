I regret to AGREE! I've been forced to do this in a beetle, an air-cooled
vanagon, and (sorry) an old toyota station wagon. Not recommended, but if
you have to, you have to :-(

&gt; &gt; A little while ago, my clutch slave cylinder failed and due to the 
&gt; &gt; location and the time (Washington DC at 1 am) I decided to take a 
&gt; &gt; carefully planned route to a safe haven, cranking over in second and 
&gt; &gt; actually making it there without having to stop (or shift).  I 
&gt; &gt; mentioned this to some people I work with and a few mentioned they 
&gt; &gt; &quot;knew people&quot; (don't they always?) who shifted their manual trannys 
&gt; &gt; without using the clutch just by cranking over in gear and just jamming

&gt; &gt; the lever in for the upshifts. 
&gt;    (snip)
&gt; 
&gt;     It's easier then you may think. I drove a car home across 3 state
&gt;     with no clutch. Start it in 1st gear. When ready to shift, apply
&gt;     a constant GENTILE presser to the shifter and let off the gas.
&gt;     It will come right out of gear, and jump right into the next gear
&gt;     as the RPM's of the motor fall thru the speed of the next gear. The
&gt;     only problem is stopping. As you approtch a stop, make sure you
&gt;     pull it out of gear before the RPM's drop. If you  don't there is
&gt;     no other way to stop other then turning off the motor!
&gt; 
&gt;                     Good luck Eric Zeno
