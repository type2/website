&gt;I haven't seen the stretch job,  but I have seen one of the shortest buses 
in
&gt;the world.   I think a 64,  no room for cargo doors.
&gt;
&gt;        The guy whose bus it was said the brakes were rigged so you could
&gt;pull one cable at a time and turn on a dime.  It could also do wheelies.

When I lived in Ft. Collins, Colorado (early 80's), there was an
independent repair shop called Small Wonder, on N. College Ave. near
the tracks. They mostly did work on VWs, and they had a shortened
splittie bus on display. As I recall, the area normally occupied by
the cargo dorr was gone, and the front and back halves welded together.
The front and rear wheels almost touched as I recall, although that
could be fading long-term memory on my part.

Don't know if it was drivable, or if anyone ever actually tried. Every
time I  saw it, a rear tire was flat, which made it lean backward at
about a 20 degree angle.

It's been a dozen or more years since I was last there. Anyone know if
they still have it?
