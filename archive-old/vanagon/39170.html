Subject: '66 Kombi for sale in SE Mich

Hi wanabusers:

This info was forward to me by a friend.  I've only seen this bus
once, and it was just after I ate a pretty nasty chile dog, so
my faculties were pretty impaired at the time :-) It's been sold once since
then, and another VW friend told me this guy only paid $2500 for it, so
unless he put in the new engine, the $3500 thing is a little high.

-----------
For sale:
1966 Kombi
1600dp (rebuilt)
No holes in pan or heater channels
light surface rust
not winter driven
no interior except front seats &amp; passenger bench seat
runs good.
3500 obo

Oh, my other connection with this bus is, see that line &quot;no interior&quot;?
well the PO sold it to me (it's pretty ratty).  But if you buy
this bus and really want the original interior panels, I'll sell them
to you for what I paid for them. . . . .

I've got the previous owner's phone number around somewhere, so if
you want the dirt on this bus from someone with no financial interest,
I'll dig it up.

That's all I know. . . . .. .
