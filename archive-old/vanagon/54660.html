&gt;Hi all.
&gt;
&gt;I'm waiting for the weather to warm up so I can do some work on my van
&gt;(install used engine).  It's been too cold to start working outside ( -41
&gt;before wind chill (yes minus 41 degrees)).  I live in Northern Ontario
&gt;Canada.  40 below is 40 below celcius, farenheit, same thing.  It was only
&gt;a couple of days, but we usually get about a week of that stuff near the
&gt;end of January.
&gt;
&gt;The first year I had my van (85 transporter), I was coming home from work
&gt;at about 5 am, 40 below and my oil light came on.  I pulled over to find my
&gt;oil all up my back door and in a puddle underneath.  Scared the heck out of
&gt;me but it ended up it was only the oil filter gasket had blown out.  Quick
&gt;change that afternoon and all was well.  I still had to walk home though (3
&gt;miles).
&gt;
&gt;
There's a dealer maintenance bulletin ref oil filter gaskets blowing at low
temps - check the archives or the NTSB page.


&gt;Anyone know what weight of oil is recommended when hell freezes over?
&gt;
My experience only extends to -10f, but w/Mobil 1 synthetic in 5w-30
starting was no problem (I go to 15-50 in the summer);  also, Redline MTL
synthetic in the gear box really improves shifting at low temps.
