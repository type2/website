Subject: clunking from driver's side wheel

Hello all-

When turning right I notice a clunking/cow bell type sound coming from the
driver's side tire.  Any ideas what it could be?  I notice more on slow
turns but that maybe due to less road noise. In gereral there is a fair
amount of creaking from both sides when going over bumps. She's an 81 and
was driven infrequently before I purchased her.

Also before I attempt to run the air conditioning do I need to get it
checked and &quot;recharged&quot;  (whatever that means).

Thanks for the help.

Maggie
