Subject: Re: Vanagon choking when feeding gas

&gt;.... My vanagon will simply refuse to take in gas. It shuts off the
&gt;pump every 3 - 5 seconds. I have to feed gas as slowly as possible to avoid 
&gt;spill. It always takes twice as much time to fill up. The problem started at
&gt;the very first time (when the car was new) to a gas station.


My problem is similar but I bet it's related.  Mine consistently throws up 
at the end of filling the tank.  This can be avoided if I estimate the 
amount of fuel needed and manually reduce to the minimum gas delivery rate 
for the last gallon or so.  I only have it shut off early maybe 5% of the 
time.  I think the diameter of the tube is the cause.
