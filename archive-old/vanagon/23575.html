Subject: Re: Incredible Regulations (long)



RE: Hair-trigger wimps who enact silly regulations:

Third and final installment in the Gummint Gripe trilogy.
In the crosshairs: The center-mounted third brake light!

I. The Idea.

Once upon a time, there was a Safety Researcher with time on his
hands. Quoth he, &quot;Gee, I wonder if we could make cars' brake lights
more visible, and thus reduce accidents&quot;.

So, he put a Third Brake Light in the rear window of a new car,
where all who came upon it could observe its brilliance, and goodness,
and inform their friends, and rejoice, and feast upon the lambs and
the wheat and the wine. And he cast his longing gaze upon the Third
Brake Light, and behold, it was good.

II. The Test.

And so he decreed a Grand Test. He would install his Third Brake Light
in 500 or so cars, and send them forth into the land of the unholy
Regular Driver, where it would be subject to praise and epithets,
impacts and near-misses, rain and fog and plagues of locusts. And
he would tally upon his Grand Ledger, a list of Impacts, NearMisses,
and Gestures of an Inconsiderate Nature visited upon the cars bearing
his Third Brake Light, especially from the Rear from whence it was
designed to prevent calumny. And lo, he would compare his Grand Ledger
to those compiled by the Lords of High Insurance, forsooth their cars
carried not the Third Brake Light.

And so the bold cars ventured forth upon the land, with little fanfare
and alarum, for this was to be and Unbiased Test. And the unwashed
Regular Driver followed, and looked, and saw the Light, and spake.

III. The Effect.

Quoth he: &quot;Lo, such a Light is new in my sight. I see'st not this, in
mine own car, nor in any car of my Neighbour, nor in that of the
Merchant, nor the Baker, nor the Goatherd.&quot;

Quoth he, &quot;I have seen this light only in the car of the Centurion--
he of the blue clothing, and the flashing spotlight, and the billyclub,
and the doors which remain Plain and Unmarked amidst his Shielded
and BlackAndWhite bretheren. This must be a new and cleverly provided
Muse to bring down upon us Tickets, and Fines, and all manner of plagues
and boils.&quot;

Quoth he, &quot;Lo, shall I take care to not Screw Around in his sight, nor
Pass, nor Bonk, nor make all manner of untimely Threat upon he who bears
this Light; lest I be brought up before the Powers That Be, who shall
then afflict me with Great Burdens, and cast me down into the realm
of Suspension, TrafficSchool, RideBumming, and thence into the darkest
depths of PublicTransportation.&quot;

IV. The Interpretation.

And so it came to pass, that the list of Impacts, Scrapes, NearMisses,
and Extended Fingers visited upon the car that bore the Third Brake
Light, was greatly diminished. And behold, the Third Brake Light
became the object of great wonderment and praise.

And so the Safety Researcher travelled across the land, and in time
came to the Capitol City, wherein resided the Halls of Gummint.
And he displayed his wares, and opened for them his Grand Ledger,
and plied them with Wine, Wimmen, and Song. And they looked upon
the Third Brake Light, and examined forthwith its Sterling Record
of accident-free operation; and they saw that it was good.

V. The Decree.

And so the minions of the Halls of Gummint decreed, that henceforth
All cars would take upon themselves the trappings of the Third Brake
Light, and that they would proudly carry it forth into the land, to
display to all that followed that they were Slowing Down and,
forsooth, Getting in the Way. And so in this way they would earn
shining Records of passage, glowingly free from Impact, Scrape,
NearMiss, and BirdFlip; and they would bring Great Glory upon
themselves and their Posterity.

VI. The Result.

But as the Third Brake Light was brought forth to the Masses, it came
to pass that a Great Darkness fell over the land. When the Regular
Driver spied the profusion of Third Brake Lights, he spake.

Quoth he: &quot;This is no emblem of the Centurion. I now see this Thing
in mine own car, and the car of my Neighbour, and the Merchant, and
the Baker, and the Goatherd; and even on the BuddyBar of the lowly
Biker. And it pleaseth me not.&quot;

And so did the Regular Driver fall back on evil ways. More Carefully
did he not drive, nor Courteously, nor with a modicum of extra Good
Sense. And he did proceed to resume his old habits, and drive beyond
the posted Limits of Decorum, and swerve, and burn large quantities
of Rubber in his quest to Arrive in Good Stead. And he did Bonk, and
Scrape, and visit Vitriolic Exclamations upon his Bretheren. And the
Purveyors of Replacement Parts did rejoice, and the Body Shops, and
the makers of Prosthetic Limbs, and growers of Flowers, and the
Doctors and Priests did experience continued unholy Commerce.

VII. Epilogue.

And so did the Quest of the Third Brake Light come to nought. Never
was the Accident Rate diminished, nor the Following Distance increased,
nor did the Regular Driver gain in Wisdom or Good Cheer. But soundly
did the Safety Researcher sleep at Night, secure in the belief that the
world was now a Safer Place. And loudly did the minions of the Halls
of Gummint proclaim, that they had done a Good Thing, and so did they
promise Many More to come.
