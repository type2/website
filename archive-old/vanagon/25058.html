Peter,

Most car salesmen (the good ones) keep lists of people looking certain types
of hard to find cars.  Occasionally some poor misguided sole will actually
trade their westy in for something else.  That's how my wife found ours and
it was a good one.

Check with the VW dealers in your area.  Good Luck and when they call act
fast if it's a cherry.

&gt;
&gt;I'm hoping one day to be able to inform the list that I am the proud owner 
&gt;of a Westy, but I've had zero luck finding one.  Does anyone have a listing 
&gt;of newspapers or classifieds that are on the net?  I'm specifically looking 
&gt;for something on the east coast of the US.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;PEJ
