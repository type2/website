&gt; I found this on rec.auto.vw. Someone maybe interested:
&gt; So, the '77 has been sitting around ever since '87. I did start it up every
&gt; now and then just so that the engine would not lock up or anything. It's been
&gt; setting outside for most of the time. It's been inside for a while now,
&gt; though. There is quite a bit of rust on the outside, but the floorboards are
&gt; solid. If I had the time and money I would restore it. The engine has the
&gt; exhaust studs broke off, but that is the only thing that I know is wrong with
&gt; the engine. A few week ago I drove it around in my grandfather's field and it
&gt; shifts beautifully and has plenty of power. The engine is a 2.0 fuel injected.
&gt;  
&gt; My question is (finally) should I just junk this thing, or is it worth
&gt; something to someone? It seems a shame to just scrap the engine and trans, and
&gt; the body could be fixed. Also the interior is in pretty good shape.
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks for any advice.

I think he ought to drive it over to my place and junk it in my 
driveway   :)
