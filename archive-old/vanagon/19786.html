&gt;Does anyone know if any nationally distributed antifreeze
&gt;is phosphate free?  I live in an area where I would have
&gt;to drive 250 miles to get VWs coolant and it _is_ that time.
&gt;Thanks for any suggestions.

My VW dealer carries a Quaker State special phosphate free antifreeze. I
don't think its the usual stuff (and it's green! But I've verified with
several dealers that it is phosphate free).

Your local auto store may be able to special order it for you.

Good Luck!
