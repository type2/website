Howard,
If it's like my '81 it just pulls away from the body.  There are no 
fasteners per se, but &quot;serrated&quot; plastic projections that fit into 
receivers on the body.  Grab the plastic firmly on both sides and yank 
back hard and it should come away with no damage.  If that doesn't work, 
since they tend to be seated in there very securely as you've already 
found out, then yank on one side first, just to get things moving.  The 
other side should then come out in the same fashion.  You might probe on 
the extreme edge with a small screwdriver and see if you can wedge the 
&quot;serrations&quot; back a little to ease the whole process.  The serrations are 
of the type you see on steel wedges that you drive into wooden hammer 
shafts, if you've ever seen one.  They look something like this:
  ________   
  \      /   from the side
  \      /
  \      /

Good luck.  Reply direct if that didn't work, I'll be online periodically 
on Sunday.
Jack

&gt; I know someone out there has already done this. I have an '87 camper
&gt; and I'm try to remove the plastic lower portion of the dash right
&gt; in front of the stick and below the radio. It's a vertical section
&gt; of plastic that I want to mount drink holders to and possibly
&gt; my CB. I have the radio out and I've looked from above, below
&gt; and the sides but I can't find where it's attached. If anyone has
&gt; (successfully) removed this piece please tell me how you did it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in digest mode so if you could write me directly and copy the list
&gt; I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance!!
