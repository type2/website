Subject: Ignition prob ?, '85

Here's something I could use a hand on from them wot know.

The current owner of my '85 (well, his now I guess) called to say it 
wouldn't start, but had been running fine etc. I cleaned all the ground 
wires for the FI system, cleaned all connectors on Hall unit, idle 
stabilizer, distributor, brain. And it started/ran fine. 

        Ten minutes later on a test drive it lost power and died. The 
previous and present problem was &quot;no spark&quot;, nada at the plugs. More 
plugging and unplugging of connectors and vroom we're off again. I go home 
happy, only to get a call 1 hr later, same prob. Go clean some more ground 
wires, vroom we're off, but the engine had cooled down while I was getting 
there. No repeat problems for 4 days city driving. Then he goes 120 miles 
highway, some city driving and boompf, dead again. The guy got it going 
himself, plug/unplug. Next day, another 10 miles highway and it dies. No go 
this time. I'm waiting to hear the outcome. 

        I checked the Hall circuits, idle stabilizer, wiring harness, coil 
resistance, wire resistances, every test possible under Bentley etc.. All 
passed A-OK twice! Did all checks with engine cold, some when hot. Spent 5 
hours last weekend on someone elses bus, grumble, should've sold it for 
more, grumpf.

        Has anyone had a slow/intermittent failure of an ignition component 
that occurs after the engine/component has warmed up? ie some thermal 
problem with the electronics. Could this be my coil simply giving out? None 
of the ignition bits have ever been replaced since 1988, 7 years use. When 
the van is running there are no problems at all, it just suddenly looses its 
spark! TIA.   tim s.
