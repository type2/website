&gt;What happened to the Canada/U.S. Free Trade Agreement?  The duties on
&gt;importing vehicles to Canada from the U.S. have been greatly reduced lately.
&gt;This must have something to do with the vans being German made, not U.S. or
&gt;Canada...

GOTCHA! :) Things aren't always what the governments say they are. until
THEY want them to be that way. 'free trade' ain't exactly that. what it
has to do with is some stupid u.s. law that taxes imported pickup trucks.
toyota and the other japanese get away without paying the tax because their
little trucks are shipped WITHOUT the truck bed in back. so the description
of what is shipped is 'truck parts', which are NOT taxed. in california, the
beds are put on the truck and shipped to the dealers.

since the vanagons are all welded together, vw can't get away with that.
what i heard was that gm, ford, and chrysler all got the u.s. congress to
put the tax on way back when (in retaliation for some german tax on u.s.
chickens), and it's never been taken off. protects all the ford/gm/dodge
dealers from that intense vw competition, don't you know. :)

and then Ric Golen, that sister-marrying yankified scumbag of a possum, said:
&gt;Lets not talk about tarriffs, etc...another major problem goes
&gt;back to the MexiBug stuff....certification by VW to the US Federal
&gt;Safety and Environmental Nazis that the pick-up meets US stds. I suppose
&gt;one could canabalize a 1988 Vanagon, and then put all the appropriate
&gt;parts on a 1988 Pickup.

actually, it's simply than that. SOME of the pickups/panels sold in canada
had BOTH the canadian and u.s. DOT and EPA stickers. mostly what i found
was that the trucks sold in british columbia had both sets of certifications.
the ones in toronto did not. go figure. i guess vancouver and seattle are
close enough and have enough cross-border traffic that vw just did it for
them. but toronto and ottawa dealers told me that their trucks did NOT have
the u.s. stickers.  so if you bring one in from the eastern side of canada,
you might well have a bit of a problem. :)

also: some trucks were sold in germany, and perhaps in canada, with
smaller engines and carburetors (instead of fuel injection). so you might
well have a problem with making those trucks meet u.s. standards.
