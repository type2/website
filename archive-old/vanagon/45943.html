&gt; While on my trip from DC to NYC, my exhaust system decided it 
didn't want to
&gt; go along.  About 1/3 the way, the pipe that goes from the collector to the
&gt; cat broke off the collector.  (This is the pipe with the O2 sensor in it).  
&gt; 
&gt; I managed to get a local shop to weld the rusty pipes together for 20 bucks.
&gt;  It should get last till I can get it replaced. 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is the only source I have been able to find for the exhaust pipes
&gt; have been the dealer.  Does anyone know of a source for these pipes with
&gt; reasonable prices?  My front pipe, cat &amp; exhaust are good.  I just need the
&gt; rear pipe and the pipe that the O2 sensor screws into.
&gt; 
As my '88 is getting near that point also, here's what I found from 
BowWow parts in Victoria, BC: (prices are CDN $, so less 35-40% for 
US $)

'85
Front pipe  178
Rear pipe   179
Conn pipe   178
Cat         190
Muffler     140
Tailpipe    41
Gaskets     45

Parts are made by Dansk in Denmark - anyone know about their quality??
