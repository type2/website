Several things on my mind but don't want to clutter up mailboxes w/
separate messages...

1. People have been talking about converting buses to campers.  How/where
do I get started??  I'd really like my '79 bus to have camper attributes
but have always been afraid to hurt my baby.  I'd love to get ahold of 
some plans/instructions for common installations.  Maybe after doing
a few standard improvements I'll be more confident in major work (although
that will probably have to wait a couple of years until I get a second
car and a good place to work on it!!).  Can anybody help??

2. Any ftp or www sites for VW stuff??  I'd really like to get ahold of
some good .gif/.bmp/.jpg/..etc. files to use for my windows wallpaper.
Other info (repairs, etc. is good too)        

I'll be taking my own solo &quot;Brick Across America&quot; tour from C'Ville, VA
to College Station, TX in mid-August.  Any bussers down that way???  I
know you're out there 'cause Joel says so!!!  :)
