While my tranny is apart, and I'm waiting for parts, I've decided to 
spiff up my speedo.

I have 3 differernt ones to take parts from, to end up with one complete
working unit.  I have 1 bug and 2 bus units.

The difference between the bug and bus is the angle the cable comes in.
Please don't make the same mistake I did and use a bug speedo in a bus -
I ended up breaking the (brand new) cable!

Another difference is the bus speedo has a gear setup that lets you 
adjust the tension betweent he input worm gear and the odometer gear, or
disconnect it altogether.  I think this is why a lot of bus odometers
don't work - the screw comes loose and thus doesn't turn the odometer!

I went to the local artsy-fartsy store and bought some green and red
acetate, which I will use for the oil and gen lights.  They were out of
blue (high beams) but I'll keep looking.  This stuff looks real close
to the original, as far as color goes!  It cost me 95 cents for an inch
of each - 1&quot; x 50&quot;!  I have enough for about 30 speedometers!
