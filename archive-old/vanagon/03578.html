Or, better yet, at least one motorcycle.  Insurance is $40.50 per year
and it gets 48 mpg, plus it only cost me $1000 seven years ago when it
had but 4000 miles on it.  No spare car can beat those numbers, and no
non-exotic spare car can stay with a Suzuki GS650.  I go for my spare
parts REAL QUICK!
