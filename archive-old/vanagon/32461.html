Subject: Jacobs ignition system


A while ago i queried the list about some ignition system I saw in VWTrends 
that boasted 10% increases in Hp and mpg.  I have since seen the add again. 
 It was a Jacobs system.  I asked an avionics engineer who has also done a 
beautiful job restoring a mustang about it and he gave Jacobs a high 
credibility rating but didn't have any experience (first or second hand) 
with the Jacobs ignition system.

Can any of the list members pass on any info, mainly experiences, about the 
Jacobs?

Thanks,
Fred Porter
