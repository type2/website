I didn't have any bolts per se but when I put the seat belts in my '69 
back seat I had a plastic plug that was threaded.  I took it down ot the 
local Pep Boys and threaded metric nuts on untill I found one that fit 
then bought the bolts the nuts fit on.  No problemo it was a standard 
metric size.  What I had a hard time finding was tranny pan bolts for my 
'89 Taurus.
