Subject: Re:  steering, swing lever

Christian,
   I just had this job done at the shop (see last post: Steering work: Resolved
and the mech said he has an adjustable reamer and does the final ream after 
the bushing has been installed. Personally, I dont see trying to cut and 
compensate for the compression. If your wrong by a few thou I could defeat
the purpose of doing the job in the first place. The Oct 94 issue of T&amp;A has
a good article on this job and Wolfsburg West will rent the reamer. I dont 
know where you are but the shop I used did a good job at a good price, I
would recommend them.

                                              Steve
