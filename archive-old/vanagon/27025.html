&gt;My own thots run more along the lines of these paint guns, the things that

&gt;such idiots, even with a blob of paint, would be a public service.  Being
&gt;able to identify incautious drivers by the smear of purple or yellow paint
&gt;might become a new trend.

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. :)

well, but i can think of some difficulties/problems with this.
- stern launchers would be ok,   but the idiot would see the paint gun fire
  at the same time he heard the &quot;thunk&quot; (&quot;thwack&quot;??) on the front of his/her
  car. and the splatter of the paint pellet could obscure his windshield
  (sticky legal situation there) ... and possibly render him/her enraged and
  even more likely to do stupid things to YOUR rear end. :(
- side launchers would be better; as they came alongside, giv'em a broadside!!
  like the old days of the pirate movies!! :)
  however ... the paint is sure to splatter onto your car as well.
- front lauchers would be worst: the paint would surely come back to hit your
  windshield/etc. :(

how about magnetic paintballs with delayed detonation?? :)
