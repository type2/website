Vanagoners:

	Following Joel Walker's and jgshepard's good advice, I dissected my
driver side door. The Bentley diagram is quite clear (after the fact.) 
	After extricating the motor/regulator from inside the door, I detached
the motor. It would not run when hooked up to power. I then turned the
shaft manually several revolutions and repowered. Success. After liberal
application of 3 in 1 oil around the shaft, I reassembled everything and
it's still working. My own surprise at this successful outcome is exceeded
only by that of my wife and kids :)
	Presumably moisture and corrosion (temporarily) incapacitated my motor.
Now to see if the passenger side nonfunctioning window can be similarly
cured.
