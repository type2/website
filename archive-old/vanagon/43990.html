Subject: Vacuum leaks...

The '89 has been having problems idling after starting cold (and sometimes
when warm). Five minutes of warm-up usually fixes most of the problem. When
the problem occurs, it runs fine *until* touching the accelerator, after
which the RPM drop to about 500.  Now the brakes (power-assist (aren't they
all?)) are getting weird.  Intermittently, naturally.  Sometimes the pedal
goes down the normal distance, holds for a second and then keeps going to
the stop.  Non-power brakes are a LOT easier to deal with in The Bozobus...

I got to spend about two hours trying to analyze it.
Did the vacuum-assist-drum-accumulator-thing test, per Bentley.
Stomp on brakes five times (to eliminate residual vacuum).
Start engine.
The brake pedal should go down, a little.
That's what it did.

Plenty of fluid.
Vacuum hoses look okay.
Bentley says test the vacuum check-valve in the engine compartment by
blowing through it both ways - it should only pass air in the direction
&quot;toward the engine&quot;.  Couldn't get it out.  Didn't have any replacement
hoses, and the originals proved impossible to remove undamaged.  Stopped
before I wrecked both hoses (big rubber one from 'air collector box' to
valve and the hard plastic one from valve to vacuum line that goes
forward).
The edges of the (2&quot; long) rubber hose between the airbox and the valve
were pretty chewed up, so I installed a small hose clamp there to make sure
I hadn't created a new vacuum leak.

Now the problems are happening much less frequently.

Could a vacuum leak cause these two symptoms?
I was ready to change out the temp sensor II and hope that that would cure
the idling-when-cold problem (and I probably still will, anyway).

Yet more &quot;special&quot; hoses to buy at the dealer's ridiculous price...

Are there any other common leak points in the vacuum system that I should
check for?
What is the 'best' clue that it is time to bite the bullet and replace
*all* of the vacuum lines?
