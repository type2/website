&gt;Help me out here, I am still green to this VW thing, what is BBTA and were
&gt;might one be found.  Depending on location Labor Day weekend sounds
&gt;interesting.

BBTA = Busses by the Arch, a biannual event where lots of busses from all
over the place meet and camp out together. It's near St. Louis.
