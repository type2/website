Subject: Textured Wallpaper help, was Re: OLE Blue!
Date: 26 Jul 96 09:43:09 PDT

Most of the textured wallpaper stuff on my '80 has peeled completely 
off. &lt;or was encouraged by my kids&gt;
The area over the driver has zillions of cracks, stretchmarks, &amp; tears.
This may be due to part of it's life having been spent in Arizona's 
deserts in the summertime.  &lt;A/C, we don't need no stinking A/C&gt;
I too, would like some recommendations on 
A) Removal techinques (hair dryer?)
B) Replacement materials, procedure, etc

It was recommended to me to strip it all off spray with aerosol type 
glue and press fabric in place.

&gt; glued it back up after removing the rubber mouldings and had it up 
&gt; pretty well but after a week it is peeling off again!
&gt; 
&gt;   I need to know what you want done with it.  It has 3 small cracks in 
&gt; it due to it's brittleness and I think it may be the best thing to 
&gt; remove it all the way and recover with something else.  Let me know what 
&gt; to do, It makes it hard to see out the rear window while driveing too.
