&gt; 
&gt; There is a possibility I will be moving to the magical land of earthquakes,
&gt; mudslides, floods and droughts.
&gt; 
&gt; How hard is it to bring a vehicle from Canada into California and how much
&gt; does it cost?  Does all the original emissions equipment have to be present
&gt; and functioning, or do I have to pass a smog check?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
  Emissions equipment originally on the vehicle will need to be in place. I
  think there is fee assessed on cars don't have California spec. &lt;more 
  stringent than the rest of the U.S.; Canada?&gt; emissions equipment. Most
  urban areas have a mandatory smog check whenever the title is transferred
  and every other year at registration time.

  Maybe it's easier to sell the one you've got and buy a similar one, rust-
  free, once arrived in California?
