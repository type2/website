He told me once used to work for the dealer, he had all the formal
training before he opened up his own shop, so it's like getting dealer
expertise for a lot less.  In any case, he does good work.

&gt; I haven't had him work on my van yet but he has quoted me 150.00 to
&gt; replace the fuel sender and replace all the rubber, the dealer wanted
&gt; 75.00 just for the sender.  This seems like the guy to deal with.
