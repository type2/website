We bought our '84 Vanagon from a VW dealer in Concord California whose name
I 
am embarassed to admit I cannot remember this evening.  It was a
second-hand 
bus, and already 4 or 5 years old.

A couple of weeks after we brought it home, the head gaskets blew.  The
dealer 
not only bludgeoned VWoA into agreeing to pay for a new engine, they agreed
to 
let us have OUR mechanic do the job.

I can't say enough good things about the VW dealer in Concord.  We wound up

buying three VW's from them over the years, and if we ever buy another new
one 
I'll probably trek across the bay over there to do it, even if we do now
live 
an hour-and-a-half away.

---------I believe the  dealer is Bowman Concord VW where we bought our
Eurovan.  It was their shuttle bus with only 7K miles on the odometer.  The
local south bay dealerships were on another planet compared to Bowman.  
        Bowman was incredible!  No credit hassle.  (You have credit?  O.K.)
 We want X dollars for the van, you're offering Y dollars, OK!  Its got
floor mats, we'll throw them in for free. Test drive?  sure take it
wherever you want and don't rush back. My wife and I really felt that we
were given a red carpet treatment there.  We will drive two hours to
Bowmans when we buy our next VW.
