Subject: Coolant Leak Fixed-'85 Westy

     
     Another note to the list outlining the latest fix.
     
     I noticed a puddle of coolant directly under the oil filter and began 
     tracing the origin.  It is pretty close quarters with all of the hoses, 
     connections, waterpump, thermostat housing, etc., but traced it to the 
     joint between the pipe that is attached to the head on the pass. side of 
     the engine and goes into the waterpump.  The leak was at the waterpump.
     
     Purchased a new o'ring and gasket for a couple of bucks from the dealer.
     
     Was anticipating having to drain the coolant so put off doing the work for 
     a few days.  Anyway began by loosening the alternator bracket and then 
     removing the steering pump and bracket from the engine(3 bolts) and moving 
     it out of the way(leaving the hoses attached). Pulled two of the belts out 
     of the way to give some working room.  Then removed the two allen head 
     bolts holding the pipe flange to the head.  Some coolant came out(about two 
     cups)but not as much as I thought might.  Then just pulled the pipe out of 
     the hole in the waterpump(after removing the clamp holding the dipstick 
     tube to the pipe).  Snaked the pipe all of the way out, cleaned it up, 
     replaced the hardened, deformed o'ring and reversed the operation.
     
     Took maybe 1/2 hour and stopped the leak.
