Subject: Re: improvised stove/oven?

&gt;For those of us with &quot;pared down&quot; Transporters, what are popular solutions to,
&gt;say, heat up the occasional baby bottle? Thanks.

&gt;John, et al - maybe there's plenty of room in YOUR bus for anything,
&gt;but I'm having trouble locating my dishwasher, shower, microwave, 
&gt;washer, dryer, etc....  :)

OK no hazing the less well equipped, I used to own an Austin Mini with a 
bidet, so there! Every deep puddle I went through sprayed water through the 
holes in the floor and into my lap. For easiest beverage heating get a 12V 
coffee pot from truck/RV places. Plugs into the lighter. Just mount it 
securely, they all say &quot;do not use while in motion&quot; for obvious reasons. tim s.
