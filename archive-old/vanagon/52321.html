Subject: Re: Syncro on the Dunes?

	Well, I haven't done dunes and don't have a syncro but my friend
Jeff and I discovered why dune-buggies have those wide tires and/or
the difference between wet sand and dry sand... We had his family's 1300 
and drove out the boat launching ramp on Hood's Canal at low tide, and 
having seen too much TV, drove the  Beetle out onto the sand and toward 
the 4 inch tall waves... as we got to the area where the sand was wet, 
the Beetle's rear wheels gently sank into the wet sand until it was resting 
on the oil-pan &amp; bottom of the chassis. Then the tide began to come in... 
We left the engine running as the tide came in. The car was 30 feet 'off 
shore', in 8&quot; of water or so, and showing no signs of floating, when
the tow truck guy arived. He pulled the car out in a minute or two.

	4wd would have just dug-in the front wheels too.

	One might have similar problems on a steeply sloped dune, and
not have a tow so readily available. Be careful!

	Bill
