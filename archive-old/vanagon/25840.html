Hey, I can attest to the power of those forced-air ceramic heaters: they 
kick!  Crank it up, and the whole bus (even with the pop-top up!) gets to 
normal room temperature or higher in just a few minutes.  Rockin'!

'Course, you need to be hooked up to 110V AC to run it, so it doesn't do 
you much good on drives longer than a few minutes in really cold weather.
