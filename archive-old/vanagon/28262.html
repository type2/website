I agree Linda! Some of my favorite car-oriented magazines are from
the UK. They are Thoroughbred and Classic Cars, and Classic and
Sports Car. They cost about $6/issue over here in the US, but they
are worth it.

The writing is fantastic, the photos are professionally done...in
fact there are cars in those magazines which we have never had imported
here to the US, but once I am done reading the article, I feel as if
I have owned/driven one of those cars for years.

I would rather plunk down $6/issue for a well written, adult market
magazine than to piss $2.50 over the fence on the drivel put out
by VWT&amp;A and Douche Bags and Horny Volks Wusses!

IMHO as always...

Ric
