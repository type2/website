Subject: A newcomer seeks advice...

Hi y'all! &lt;standard apologies for newbie screwing up...&gt;

I've been lurking for a little while, and now I'm ready to ask a question... 
My better and I are looking for transportation, mostly for road trips. RIght 
now in the running are:

a) a 1971 camper, some rust, rebuilt engine and clutch,

and

b) a 1986 Wasserboxer, scratches on body, 130K, new clutch...

I'm leery of the Wasserboxer because of parts cost, but it drives great. The 
guy selling it says the person who sold it to him said &lt;whew!&gt; that VW 
recalled it in '89 and put a new engine in. He doesn't believe him, I'm not 
sure I do. Any thoughts?

The '71 would be just fine, but &lt;gulp&gt; we're driving to Minnesota for 
Christmas! (Brrr.....) I am trying to wish an acceptable heat system into 
existence. 

Solicited advice? Comments? Help? I'm a bit confused...

Thanks a lot,

Anton in Brooklyn
