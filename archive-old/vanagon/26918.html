&gt;just to add a bit of balance to Joel's lamentations, i was traveling
&gt;through Brainerd, MN yesterday, a town of about 16,000 people.  not
&gt;big mind you but still a good flow of traffic as it is on a major
&gt;state highway.  the power was out for about a 3 mile stretch of the
&gt;main thorough-fare through town and all stop lights were dark.  i
&gt;was impressed with the way drivers behaved themselves, taking turns
&gt;at each stop-light as if it were a posted 4-way stop.  it was
&gt;refreshing 'cause there were no cops, no traffic control, just people
&gt;acting with a little consideration.


Hear, hear!!! Kudos and praises to the residents of Brainerd!
WHich, BTW, ain't such a bad place...

Ain't it remarkable what happens when you remove restrictions
and inject a little common sense?

***COURTESY***!!!!

Damn, I remember some of that... way back when...
