Subject: Re: Fridge fan times three

I hope your three fan idea works.

I've noticed that my Westy fridge seems to work differently than any 
other RV fridge I've had before.

In warm weather, performace is marginal, slightly worse than other RVs. I 
can usually hold 44 degrees in 90 degree weather. But that's not good 
enough for me.

But, in cooler weather , when other RV fridges can really get cold (usally 
28 degrees F with the thermostat all the was down) my fridge hardly ever 
gets below 40 degrees, even if it's 40 degrees outside! It must be related 
to the fact that the coils aren't really geeting enough of that outside air.

Maybe a vent to the outside (ugly!) would be the answer.
