Subject: RE: vanagon heat

&gt;#1 works well when driving and #2 works well to preheat the van before
&gt;driving.  I would like to wire in a third option.  That is, I would like
&gt;to install a thermostat in parallel with the timer so that the heater would
&gt;kick in every once in a while when camping overnight.

I like the idea, Kirk.  Apparently so did Eberspacher.  The manual I have 
for the later model BN4 descris optional accessories of a 19 hour timer (
(to &quot;program&quot; the heater to start at a prescribed time set up to 19 hours 
in advance) and a &quot;Room Thermostat&quot;.

I've never seen theseoptions installed in a bus, but it would seem 
feasible.  Once the startup time on the 19 hour timer is initiated, the 
heater is allowed to run for 2 hours straight.  If it is not turned off 
manually within this time there is an automatic shutoff feature built in 
the timer that will shut the heater off.

While I like the &quot;idea&quot; of the thermostat and the timer, I decided not to 
fit a setup like this in my bus, partially because I'm paranoid about the 
thermostat failing and using up the precious life left in my heater (and me 
if the heater fails).  Things that would add to my paranoia about the 
thermostat and sleeping over night/relying on it would be the hot exhaust 
pipe igniting some stray flammable substance not tmention the bapotential 
battery drain.

I really love my heater, but despite all the time I put into seeing that 
it's safety features are functioning properly and that it is securely 
installed, I only like to use it with my eyes wide open.

I'd bundle up in my sleeping bag and have a secondary switch wired in that 
is accessible from your cozy position in back.  When you wake up you can 
turn on the heater before facing the cold (I think Tobin suggested this in 
one of his sequels of Tobin and Christa's Great Adventure).

Good luck!
