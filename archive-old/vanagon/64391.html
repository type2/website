&gt; &gt; Jack,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why doncha all come over to my neck of the woods?  There's a small State
&gt; &gt; campground about 10 miles from here that would be absolutely perfect.
&gt; &gt; Catherine Creek State Park.  Located on Catherine Creek with ALL
&gt; &gt; campsites within about 50 feet of the water.  If you're interested, let
&gt; &gt; me know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jim Arnott
&gt; &gt; Union, OR
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (The one and only NE OR listmember.)
&gt; Jack:
&gt; Union is close to La Grande, in NE Oregon. Never been there, and that is
&gt; a good reason to choose it. I am all for it, and will propose it in the
&gt; Vanagon list. We are shooting for the 13/14 Sept. weekend.
&gt; I got responses from quite a lot of potential campers from the Vanagon
&gt; list. Let me know if there is anyone interested in the Type II list, and
&gt; if we can make this a VWofWO event. It would be a great oportunity to
&gt; let the VW aficionados of the NW know about our club.
&gt; Been driving my waterbuffalo &quot;Fafner&quot; a lot these days, mainly for
&gt; camping trips. My '66 kombi is ready to get her first coat of paint, and
&gt; I just can't decide betwwen blue and cream, or both!
&gt; Que vivan los VW's!
&gt; Cris.

Vanagon people:
What do you think about the above mentioned Union, OR.? Get that map,
and give me some feedback!
The place sounds good to me.
Cris.
