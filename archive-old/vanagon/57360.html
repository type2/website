Subject: Sliding Door, 86 Westy

I don't want to convert my slider to a hinged model BUT I have a problem
closing the darn thing, predominately in cold weather. It slides ok but will
not latch properly (normally when the temp. is below freezing, of course).
Just about lost the dog the other day going down the highway...
I've cleaned and lubed the tracks and lathes but it doesn't seem to help
that much. Does anyone have a solution to this problem?
