Subject: Re: discard? NEVER!

i can now sleep easier john. BTW, my local VW shop has a picture of Austin
VW Auto Wreckers, looks like lots of Type II's! Are there any pre' 68
Westfalia's in there?




&gt;&gt;&gt;Remove the mounts from the new seats.  If all goes well you will discard
&gt;&gt;&gt;these
&gt;&gt;&gt;along with your old seats.  Remove the rails and swivel from the old seats
&gt;&gt;(snip)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;what &quot;discard&quot; your old seats, never, put em' in storage (see note below)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;RULE NUMBER ONE
&gt;
&gt;&gt;NEVER, NEVER throw any old bus stuff out. You'll never know when
&gt;&gt;you/somebody else will need this stuff. I like to of all Westfalia think
&gt;&gt;stuff as invalueable.The minute you throw something out, the next day you
&gt;&gt;find a need for it. All you have to do is find places to store all these
&gt;&gt;possesions. I have managed to fill up the basement, the driveway, and a
&gt;&gt;storage garage BTW.
&gt;
&gt;OK.OK. I really didn't &quot;discard&quot; them.  That was just a figure of text.
&gt;Just talk to my wife about the garage full of undiscarded stuff...
&gt;
&gt;I actually gave the seats to a fellow grad student who had a bus almost
&gt;identical to mine, but truly ratty seats.  He was from Chermany, and was
&gt;delighted to see all the old VWs in the US.  Apparently most of them rusted
&gt;away long ago back in the old country.
&gt;
&gt;Don't worry - they went to good use.
