Subject: Re: Reclining the front passenger seat?


Lionel,

There are several seats for the Vanagon available on the after market.
Most of them a built by the Bavarian company Sportscraft. The seats are
very convenient and have arm rests, but they don't go back very deep.

One company is offering an air suspended seat for the T4 (EV) and I
like to try putting it into the Vanagon. But I have to investigate if
this will be possible.
