Subject: WTB: front bumper black plastic late style

I am going in to repair my front bumper again but sooner or later I'm going
to want to start over with a fresh one and reinforce it just so. 

So, anyone with a later model black plastic wraparound style Vangon bumper,
such as would be on a 90 or Wolfsburg or late models with the air dam
underneath, I want to buy such.
