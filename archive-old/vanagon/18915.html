Subject: By for now

I gotta go now, will be camping next week at Pismo Beach in my old '64 Camper
that is finally on the road (never got it painted).  Got the bench seats (1/3,
2/3) installed finally (only had them for ten years now), and though the engine
runs a little rough, I anticipate no problems during the trip (even though the
tranny rumbles in fourth, and the shifting is sloppy).  Since the old girl has
been semi-dormant for four years now, the rough shape of her rocker panels can
be overlooked, along with the moss stains on the roof and coming down from the
windows.

I'll be back,

terry ('64 Camper to be dropped from the weakly stats for a while)
