Subject: Re: Rear cargo door seal for '71 bus

So Steve Maher sez:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The seal around the rear cargo door (not the engine hatch) of my '71 bus
&gt;is pretty well shot. Replacements are around $70-$80 by mail order-- ouch!
&gt;Does anyone know of any workable substitutes? Need not be exact original,
&gt;as long as it keeps the door from rattling, keeps out rain, can be cut to
&gt;length, and stays in place, possibly with a little help from Silicone Sealer
&gt;or some such.

I would like to know too.  Someone had mentioned buying rubber with that
profile and cutting it themselves, which would work for me.  Since I'm
repainting my bus, and I literally had to _chisel_ the old dried rubber
out of my bus, I am faced with rubbering my entire bus.

I'd been planning on doing some research into this, I gues now is the time...
