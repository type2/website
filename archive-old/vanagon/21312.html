Subject: Re: Bus hammock

Two telescoping bars extend between the two side brackets: a sheet of 
canvas stretches between these poles. 

It is suitable for a child or storage for long term camping. The main 
disadvantage for '75(?)-'79 campers is that it takes away alot of sitting 
room...(and you have to remove the seat headrests).
