&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking about buying an '89 AdventureWagen Vanagon conversion, but
&gt;had a few questions and was hoping folks on this list could help.

&gt;What are the pluses and minues of the AdventureWagen compared to the
&gt;Westfalia?  I'm a little concerned about the permanently raised roof
&gt;(instability in the wind,... 
cross-winds cause it to lean more, but steer straighter because the center
of the 'sail' is moved aft;

&gt;lower gas mileage....
nope-we get 20+ _at_ 70 mph (although California's new-crappy-gas has dropped
it to 18.5

&gt;problems with overhangs...
yes-mine has a carport ding in the back

&gt;What about storage space between the two?
 no contest - the AW has a huge cavity over the forward cab;  I keep the
(4) sleeping bags up there, + the overhead bed has ~ 4'x5'x1' high storage
while on the road...

&gt;add-ons (such as a roof rack) are basically not an option
 this is true;

&gt;What about general convenience and comfort (are the amenities and access to
&gt;them better/worse in one versus the other)? can't speak for the Westy's,
but being able to walk around upright is a pleasure for the family while on
trips; one downside is that occupants of the top bed need to be small, &amp;
not claustrophobic (kids love it up there).. you can't sit up in bed like
you can in the Westys.

Driving-wise, is it better to have the weight more evenly distributed
side-to-side?  
I keep the heavy stuff as low as possible - the storage over the cab has
sleeping bags, and we keep jackets/blankets etc on the upper bed;
&gt;
&gt;Also, how popular are these vehicles? 
not very, fairly pricey when new, but you got what you paid for:  - the
fellow who made them did a first class job:  there are *two* shells, inner
&amp; outer, and the whole system is designed/built like a boat, esp. very nice
woodwork and hardware.

Do they retain their value as well as the Westfalias or, being more unknown
(and a little funny looking :)), do they depreciate faster?  Are they
difficult to sell?  What sort of price is fair for one of these in good
condition? 
 Don't have any info - all I can say is we've had two of them, &amp; been 100%
satisfied.  BTW, owner Ed Anderson still makes the tops - for F*RD vans!!!
They look quite nice - have one in our neighborhood. (AdventureWagen is in
Fort Bragg, California)

&gt;Thanks in advance!
