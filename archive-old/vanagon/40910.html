     &gt;Sounds like a '60 to me, which would correspond to 612483.
     &gt;I think '60 was the last year for the bullet front turn signals, and 
     &gt;the number 672483 would be later than '60 - according to
     &gt;the NEATO data at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/chassis.html
     
     Over here 63 was the last year for bullets, confused?
