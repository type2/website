     A few of my pictures from the Columbus show are up at 
http://www.infinet_dot_com/~oshaug/vw/ featuring, among others, The 
Mothership, and Mark Keller's &quot;Salvage&quot; 91 Vanagon Carat.

     I'll be going to the Cincinnati show on Saturday, and I'll post more 
pictures next week.

     Speeking of Cincinnati, is anyone interested in a caravan from the 
Columbus area?  We'll probabally be leaving from downtown Columbus around 
7am.

     Let me know.
