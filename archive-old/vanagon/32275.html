&gt; An improvement in the flame viewing ability can be made by 
&gt; cleaning the glass window in the combustion chamber and polishing the 
&gt; interior end of the sight tube.  just rub the end of the sight tube vigorously 
&gt; on your jeans to clean and buff it.  
&gt; 
&gt; of course all this necessitates removing the fridge but you were 
&gt; going to get around to doing that anyway.

The easiest way I've found for making sure I had a flame going, is to
start the fridge in the normal way and then turn the the flame dial
to the 'Max' position.   Then I go out and put my ear up close to
the flue vent and listen to see if I can hear the flame.  It's pretty
obvious.
