Subject: Re: 91 GL Lights

&gt;Last week my daughter drove about 750 miles, all in fairly heavy rain.
&gt;During the last couple of hours, the headlights went off. They would turn
&gt;on only by holding the high beam lever up.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone figured out what might have caused this problem. I would like to
&gt;fix it before it happens again.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Hello Herb,
     I have had a problem such as this.  Water had leaked down from the
winshield and corroded a grounding point for the headlights.  On an '86
there are two grounding clusters behind and above the fuse block.  The head
lights on my '86 used two wires on a single connector.  The heavy load and
bad connection burned up the connector.  I replaced the single connector
with two seperate connectors.  I hope this info helps.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
