I don't know anything about this particular company and their sound 
deadening stuff but I do have a question about using it.  Didn't some 
people here recently warn against using certain of these products 
because it can keep moisture in there and rust your bus from the 
inside out?  Was that just certain types?  Just wondering if there was
some way to do this without risking the rust thing.  I have enough as 
it is!  Thanks, Jim.
