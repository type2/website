Subject: Re: question about van shopping

Ahem ... Jill asked:

&gt;3) I heard there is no &quot;Idiots Guide&quot; for the Vanagon-is this true? I had 
&gt;one for a Rabbit and for a Toyota truck and I saved myself big bucks with 
&gt;the easy instructions.  

Idiots don't drive Vanagons.  They look under the front seats, see that the
engine's missing, smile that smile and say &quot;Yew cint fool me - they's a
engine missin'!&quot;

(Joel - please advice on correct use of grammar, syntax and colloquialisms)
