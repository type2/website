&gt;Sorry for creating the stir about the gas heaters.  I just was saying
&gt;that from personal experience, I will never use one again.  I did have
&gt;bad experiences with them not working at all.
    &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;that nasty gas heater that stole so many hours from me and left me cold
&gt;on many an occasion.


Hell, Gary, this is a common experience for most VW owners-- not just
with the heater, but with the entire car! It's never held us back, dude--
welcome to the club!
