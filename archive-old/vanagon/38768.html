VD&gt;My favorite is the Sumitomo HTR70 185/70 HR14 for the bus.  There are other
VD&gt;tires, but for the size that you need, this one fits the bill.  The sidewall

I've been running Sumitomo HTR4's on the Corrado and like them as well,
but on a bus I'd be a little leary.  Although H raters do indeed have
stiff
sidewalls, stiffer than most C load rangers if you subjectively feel
them,
typically they carry only a 36 psi max inflation and 1450 lb load rating
at best.  It is not until you step up to a V or Z in a performance tire
that you get a 44 psi inflation rating.  Still I know some on this list
indeed
swear by these on vans but I am skeptic to change when as I will
frequently
remind, Tire Rack sells the reinforced Conti 185R14 for $54 each, just
seems darn hard to beat to me.  BTW Sumitomo is indeed quite reputable
and is in fact the parent company of Dunlop now days.  I would rec their
performance tires to anyone, the HTR 4's have gone 25k on the Corrado
which is unheard of as it was eating Z raters every 13k or so.  I
noticed
no perceptible loss in adhesion dry and gains wet over the Toyo Proxes
Z1's I had been running before.  Plus they were supposed to have a 60k
treadlife warranty I never expected to see and am going to get some back
on a new front set because of it.  Good tires, good bargain, for a bus,
I
don't know.
