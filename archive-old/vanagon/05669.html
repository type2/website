Subject: What to buy-'71 PopTop, '66 PkUp?

Like a fool (I'm the owner of a '80 Westy, but it needs a rebuild so why
not get an older one) I also look in the paper at other VW ads.  Today I
saw- '71 PopTop needs minor work $1,000 OBO, and then two lines down- '66
Pick-up, 12volt $1300 OBO.  I do my own mech work except for trannys and
know the Muir bible by heart.  I have a couple of questions for list
wisdom.

What are current prices for buses of this vintage, in moderate shape?

Friends of mine say the '71 was the best year built, easy to work on, cheap
engine, dual port, front disks, do others agree?

Is there anything good or bad about the '66 year that stands out (It's the
one I like and my wife has always wanted a pickup).

How hard are parts to get for these, things like rubber door gaskets, etc.

Anything special I should look for with these that John Muir didn't take
into account.   Rick
