Here's a layman's question:

I need a pair of roof racks for my '93 Eurovan -- it has the &quot;groove&quot; type
things that the racks have to fit into, I guess -- I connot see
any other places where the rack can fit into.

Can anyone suggest a cheap and reliable source for a pair
of racks that can carry a 17' aluminum canoe?  Any good brands?

Thanks,
