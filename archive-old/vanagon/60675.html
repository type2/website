&gt;I am 5ft 10in and have no trouble adjusting the driver's seat to a
&gt;comfortable position.
&gt;
&gt;However, my wife, at 5ft 3in, has real problems.  The causes are the height
&gt;of the clutch and brake pedals and the long travel of the clutch pedal.   
&gt;She has to lift her feet to reach the clutch and, if she sits at a
&gt;comfortable distance from the steering wheel, she has difficulty in fully
&gt;depressing the clutch. 
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone met this problem and can anyone offer any hints on modifications
&gt;to help.   (I thought of looking for a taller wife but that has certain
&gt;difficulties :-)  )
