Subject: I will survive

I posted a little one liner yesterday about the '72 bus 4-sale.
***It was sold over the weekend to a relative of a list member.***

I'm going to replace all of my vacuum lines and and as many fuel
lines as I can over the weekend.  Just a little Preventive Maint.

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth folks. Have a nice weekend,
Jack  '73 Westy
