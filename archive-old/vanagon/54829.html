 To MD Stocker:

               Given your experience in the tire testing business, what
would you personally put non-reinforced tires on a Vanagon or EV? I ask
this because of Ric's new posting and because last year I looked into
buying a set of Nokian All -weather tires for the EV and decided against
it because they were NOT reinforced. The dealer's handbook actually listed
the EV 206/65/15 size but gave a non-reinforced tire for it that could
take about 1500 lbs for maximum load. But after discussions here and with
my local mechanic, I decided not to buy them and went back to the replacement
reinforced Conti's (an average all around tire with a great warranty). So
any advice you could offer would be interesting.

Thanks,
