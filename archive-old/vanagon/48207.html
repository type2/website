Subject: Re: Carpet or Something else?

carpet is bad for a practical driver.

i just modified the interior of my 72 westy a bit--i moved the 
sink/icebox unit to the right side.  the icebox now opens toward the 
door.  anyway, in the process i had to put in a new floor to fix the 
hole on the right.  i found the perfect solution in the local lowe's.

black and white floor tiles!  they are self sticking and look really 
cool.  if you dont like that look, there are lots of other designs 
available.  they are really tough and can be cut to fit.
