Subject: Re: Vanagon Pop-top Conversion Experiences

I have the Vanagon Factory Manual.  It is a pricey thing (2+ inches thick)
but has lots of  neat stuff in it.  I don't mean to insult anyones
inteligence, but does everyone know that if you start with a sunroof model
(just like Westfalia) the conversion experience will be more enjoyable? 

I have an 82 Westfalia and am about two months from installing a new
top-tent.  I will document the experience and post it.  However, in
anticipation of this experience, I have studied the drawings in the Body
section of the manual and have found that the experience will be quite
uneventful.  In fact, what you are proposing has crossed my mind as a
result...

With the cost of Synchro Westfalia Campers these days, I would think a
Synchro Sunroof would be a perfect candidate for a home conversion.  If I
happen to find one, I'll most likely throw all the gear on my Diesel onto the
Synchro (but then I'd have to worry about maintenance  }:/

Good luck.
