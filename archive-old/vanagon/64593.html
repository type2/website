Hey, Volkfolks, I still have a new alloy wheel and tire ( OEM, MXL
205/R14 ) I would like to sell. It came as spare on my 87 Syncro. All the
others were steel, this has never been on the ground. I know the price is
not as attractive as the $50 per that was offered a few weeks ago, but
bargains like that don't come very often. Still, $250 for both is a lot
less than the dealer ( and most junk yards ). I'm in the Denver area and
travel to Moab, Utah often.  Give me a call at 303-986-1237. Leave a
message if I'm not in.

Dennis Wacker
