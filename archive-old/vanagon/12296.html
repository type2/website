Subject:       VW Cold Weather Testing

this is from the mildly-interesting-department...

Bemidji is the site for Volkswagen cold weather testing.  Actually, 
Bemidji is the site for Chrysler's and Ford's too.  Get to see the 
latest VWs cruising around the countryside and before you get too 
excited, there are NEVER any vans, I don't know why.  While Chrysler 
goes to great pains to &quot;camoflage&quot; their cars/trucks/vans with trick 
body panels and wierd decals, VW has never opted to do any of this 
tom-foolery.

Had i not been so foul on VW after the purchase of my NEW '86 Jetta
GLI (nothing but problems despite fanatical maintenance and care, i
traded it for my '85 van :) i would be more excited about VW models
they're testing.  frankly now, i could care less... sorry.

even get to 'see' real German engineers here.  they'll sit in a group 
in the dealership garage, speaking German (SStone, you up for 
translating?) and probably talking about how bad the food is here, 
not VWs.  or maybe how to make reservoir tanks that self-destruct 
after 60,000 miles.
