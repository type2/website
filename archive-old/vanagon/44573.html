Greetings,all

Has anyone ever extricated a (stuck) tape from the above stereo?
It currently appears to be in a state of limbo, not fully loaded,
yet not unloaded enough to have the tape carriage release the tape.

I seem to recall a thread a couple years ago in which someone (was
it you, Unca joel?) described how to remove the fascia from the front
of the stereo; something about sticking a pointed object into the 4
holes at the corners of the plate and popping it off.  Is that still the
case?

adTHANKSvance,

Norman
