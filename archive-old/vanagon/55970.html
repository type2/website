Subject: Re: Question about 86 Synchro Weekender 

I don't believe that, in 1986, this is called a Westfalia Weekender.

I was just looking at one the other day and it was called simply a Wolfsberg Westfalia 
Camper.

This was supported by Wolfsberg crests on the sides.

Features are same as listed below.

Just wanted to add:

-Poor quality velour fabric interior, doesn't wear for sh#t.
