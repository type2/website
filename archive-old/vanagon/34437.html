I guess he thinks fax is kinda like e-mail?

Yeah, flashers, bells, and whistles are all going off at the same time. I 
saw an ad for this same guy (I believe) in Hemmings last night. It makes 
me think &quot;get rich quick scam....&quot; er, scheme...whatever. Anyone who 
knows a little about VW enthusiasts/addicts knows that so many of us will 
jump at the chance to buy a motherload of parts at deep discounts. If 
this guy's not legit, he's definitely found a good scam...and he'll get 
some takers eventually...we get the fever and...well, you know.

Of course, if he *is* legit, it could be a nice opportunity for some 
mail order company to start up. Then again, if he *is* legit, he could 
sell the whole stock to JCW or some other company in one feld swoop. The 
more I think about it, the more cautious I think I'd be with my 
pesos...thus the copy to the list.
