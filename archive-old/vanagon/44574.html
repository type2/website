Subject: Signing off...for now!

Well, I'm taking off Wednesday for the long trek from San Francisco to
Boston and back, and as much as I would like coming back to 5 or 6 thousand
messages, I'm sure my server would freak, so I must sign off for now. I
imagine I'll be gone about a month...

        I'll let everyone know how the trip goes...See you all in 4 or 5 weeks!

                                Tom

&quot;So you're going to take us for a ride eh?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, come on&quot;
&quot;Well I don't have a sister!&quot;
&quot;That's ok we no gotta car!&quot;
