&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You should call 800-225-3323, or write to Grtaful Dead Merchantile Co.,
&gt; &gt; P.O. Box X, Navado, CA 94948.  They should have what you want.
&gt; 


I get the Grateful Dead Merechantile Catalog in the mail.  They don't 
have this sticker.  I would guess that the best place to get one would be 
in the parking lot of a GD Concert.  This type of sticker is usually made 
by individuals following the Dead around and selling stickers for gas and 
food money.
