Subject: Re: Weakly Stats ... Eurovans?


Seriously though, consider that:
- the microbus was available in US for approx 10 years (57? - 67)
- the bus was available in US for 11 years (68 - 79)
- the van was available in US for 12 years (80 - 92)
- the eVan was available in US for 2 years (93, then the 95 Camper)

actually vw first imported buses earlier than that - I believe a whopping 2
 (two) were imported in 53.   my 54 kombi was imported into the us and sold
through a dealer in eastern Washington state, near the now defunct Hanford
nuclear resevation (where we protect endangered radiation) and bought by a
couple with a German name,   still has the original US laminated windshields,
not tempered windshields as Europe market buses were sold with.   

BTW, i wouldnt mind tempered windshields so i could drive my 61 with safaris
in the winter - remove safaris and put in windshields.  Spring- push out
windshields and reinstall safaris.  ( It rains too much to have them in the
winter.)   This way i wont have to use new seals each year.   That is, when
my 61 is drivable again...

   uh, anyway......    carry on.........
