So Tobin Copley says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Gang,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, so I'm quittin' my job* and taking three months in the new year to do 
&gt; some serious travelling in our new (well, to us, anyway) camper.  It's a 
&gt; 76, and aside from some rust in the wheel wells, etc, a coupla split 

Hot Diggety-Damn!  What is this?  A consiracy?  Your the second person
to just up and quit there jobs and go on long sojourn across the con-
tinent!  Damn! I wish I had balls to do this.  But, I like getting a
paycheck.  Oh well....I guess I a doomed consumer.  ;)

&gt; got most of the stuff from Steve's 'essentail tool list' in the trunk:  I'm 
&gt; also going to be bringing spare clutch and throttle cables.  

I didn't have these on the list?  That's it.  I've GOT to update 
that list for VWs only.   I used to have a VWs one but I misplaced
it somewhere in some black hole directory along with socks mates
and such.

&gt; Leave Jan 1st 1995:
&gt; Vancouver, BC to Longview WA, cross the Columbia R, head for the coast.
&gt; Hit coast around Tillamook, OR and bop on down 101 to somewhere near SF
&gt; Cruise the wine country

Let me know if you're going to be in the Sacramento, CA area and my wife
and I will house you for a night.  Of course my wife don't mind.  ;)

What a trip!  In three months?  Good Luck....


Cheers!

Steven
