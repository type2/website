Subject: RE: vanagon heat

No, the Army has wet canvas AND heaters.  Stinking diesel-fueled heaters
that warm a 20-man tent to about 57oF., thereby making your down-filled 
good-to-0oF. sleeping bag unusable but too cold to sleep in your clothes.
And you're not allowed to use a flashlight outside because the enemy would
see the light and find your encampment, but when you walk into a parked
jeep you can't hear yourself swear because the unbelieveably loud 200hp
trailer-mounted generators are going WE'RE OVER HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE.

Let's take a poll.  Any vanagon list people veterans of Army or Marines
and still interested in camping?
