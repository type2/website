&gt;i could be wrong but it sounds like a Fridolin? I know they were used by
&gt;the German Post Office in the early 70's. They king of look like a Type III
&gt;in the front end, and have a sliding door on the front, much as a Bubble
&gt;Window van would have
&gt;
Ok, ok, I stand corrected...all this talk about Fridolins and beautiful
graphical descriptions of the beasts have jogged my memory [re my
earlier mumble, er, post, about being from Germany and not remembering
such postal vehicles, blah blah].  For a while there my memory was
blinded by visions of thousands of Beetles in German Post Office 
Yellow (TM) rumbling about town.  Humble apologies and congrats to
anyone who's read this far.
Joachim
