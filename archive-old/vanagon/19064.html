Subject: Bus Seats??

A couple of questions about bus seats. First: Looking for seats for my 
1971 pop top. If I want to keep my wife happy (and believe me, I do!) I 
need to locate some seats with the head rests. Does anyone have any idea 
from what years I can use to bolt right up in a 1971? Know where any are?
Question two: The story has been told on this group of the free 1980 
Vanagon (all I need to do is tow it 800 miles!). When I get this bus 
home, I'm going to be greatly interested in putting in one of those fold 
down back seats that can double as a bed. Where can I find them and how 
hard are they to bolt in. Thanks in advance. I'll keep everyone posted on 
it's progress.
