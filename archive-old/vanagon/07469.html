Subject: EV brake problems


Guess What !!! As usual, my wife was right!!!
It turns out that the thread on the rear brake adjustment screw on one of the
wheels was shot....  Hence the 'funny' braking she noticed.  After a long
bout with the dealer, she actually managed to get them to look at it 
seriously, and they found the bad screw, ordered another one -- another
26 miles on the EV and we'd have to pay for the repair...

I'm seriously considering buying the 100,000 mile warranty now, although
I have always thought it was a waste of money... What do you folks
think???
