Subject: Long distance driving advice

Ok Volks.. some serious quick advice needed.

I am preparing my '72 Safare for a long distance trip in May.  Rountrip 
distance is almost 3000 miles.  This will be the longest drive ever for 
one of my busi.  

Bus is in excellent condition.  Engine is a '77 2000cc F.I. with less 
than 10,000 miles on it.  Already doing the following before I leave:

New Tires
Alignment
Bleed Brakes
Oil Change 2 days before leaving

What kind of things should I check out and do to the bus before heading 
out and also anything special I should do when on the road?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  This trip is also preoaring me 
for the Top of the World. ;-)

Regards,
John.
