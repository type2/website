&gt; Well.... I guess I'm in it for the adventure... :)  I definately don't
&gt; plan on doing a quick job like Matthew or Thom, but I know I can do
&gt;

quick job heh?????  try telling my dad that.  i spent 10 months on mine 
and he thought that was 9 months too long.  well, one thing with these 
projects, they never take the amount of time you originally though.  i 
had planned to spend 3 months doing the paint and body on my truck.  then 
about 1 month putting it back together.  well, 10 months later, i am 99% 
done.  but really, are they ever done???   NOT!!!!!!

take care and God Bless

 it in a fair amount of time.  There's not a big rush but if it takes
&gt; more than two years, I would think I wasn't trying hard enough.  I'm
&gt; sure that when I'm have certain 'house chores' done then I'll be able
&gt; to more concentrate on the single cab.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really glad I made the purchase and I know it will be tough but
&gt; I'll enjoy doing it once I get going on it.
