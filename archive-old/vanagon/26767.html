&gt; Speaking of Winnebagos, has anyone seen the Rialta model which is based on

Its not 'politically correct' on this list to like any thing from 
&quot;Winnebago&quot; but my wife wants to get one of these.  I'm a little 
concerned about the power from the 5 cylinder engine - not overly because 
it does fine with the EV as is even while towing.  Its a lot roomier than 
the 'mini-winnie' replacement for the Westy camper comversion but not as 
ungodly huge as most Winnebagos.  I think I'd agree to own one when my 
wife decides it time.  Preferably after the VR^ shows up though.  Not as 
much seating as I'd like but enough for my 3 kids and with my wife and 
I.  Sleeps only four (with two pairs but the baby won't mind too much 
getting a 'less' luxurious bed for a few years.

Compared though to the usual American VAN or truck conversion to a 
winnebago this looks much better.  The trucks are usually sky high and 
top heavy which doesn't seem the case with the Rialta. 

I'm going to have to drive one though to know better.
