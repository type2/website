Subject: Main bearing question

I've got all my parts ready to go back together, but My main bearings seen 
kind of tight.  Like # 1, 2, and 3 .  Should I be able to just press them 
into the case or what?  Right now, they seen real tight.  #4 fits just snug, 
but he's much smaller.
Anyone have some insight on this one?
