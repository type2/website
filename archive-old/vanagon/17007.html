Subject: 914 trans in a bus?
Date: Sun, 7 May 1995 10:21:47 -0700 (PDT)

Hi,
	I was wondering if it would be possible to swap a 914 5-speed
transmission into my 73 bus.  There is one for sale in the paper for $100.
It sure would be nice to have a 5th gear, and closer ratios (I'm assuming
with 5 gears the ratios would be closer).  Anyone have experience with
this?  I know the engine turns it in the wrong direction, but I heard once
that there was some shaft that could be reversed, or something.  Help?

-David
