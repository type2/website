&gt;My '90 (non-Carat) GL comes with the standard forward facing bench;
&gt;aside from the holes in the carpet being in a different place, does the
&gt;floor have additional bolt holes or just different bolt holes to
&gt;accommodate the different position of the bolts to hold the rear-facing

as i recall, there are some brackets that bolt into the floor/wheelwell
up at the very front (FIF) of the &quot;cargo floor&quot;, so it's not a question
of just getting the bolts. i think you'd have to drill some holes and get
the seat-holding-down brackets as well.

&gt;seat down.  IOW, how much of a pain would it be to mount my bench to
&gt;face to the rear without the people in the back knocking knees?

this can be done easily by sliding the middle seat out, and reversing it
and sliding it back in. the bolt holes don't match up so the seat is a little
out of whack, side to side. and there is almost NO leg room for either seat.
but it can be handy for carrying some forms of cargo. :)

i have also put the middle seat along the driver's side wall ... not bolted
down, but since i was loading the bus full of &quot;stuff&quot;, i didn't care. it
allows the carrying of much larger bulky &quot;stuff&quot; (like recliner chairs,
dish washer, clothes dryer) without having to leave the seat behind.
