Subject: Syncro Estasy

&gt;BTW, the Synchro is an amazing option. With studded snows it is an 
&gt;awesome winter-mobile.  Could use ABS, though, as my wife found out in a 
&gt;little spin out last winter.  

(Actually, the syncro doesn't need ABS since the viscous coupling tends to
distribute even braking force equally between the front and the rear of the
vehicle.) 

I usually drive my Syncro to its max. in Vermont.

Here is what the syncro will do for you: 

When the snow gets really deep (above 10 inches), I start to get stuck a
little and I put on the diff lock. After about 12-15 inches I begin to have
difficulty climbing hills so then I let the air out of my tires so I am
running only about 15 psi compared to the 36/40psi I normally run. This
allows me to drive in fresh snow that is 24&quot; deep or more without getting
stuck. The vehicle makes a furrow the full width of the van. Snow builds up
in the front of the van into geat piles as I drive. These piles grow half way
up to the windshield and then break off, falling to the side of the van as I
drive. The van leaves a huge car-width furrow behind me as I drive.

If there is ice I add snow chains. With the chains on and 15 psi in the tires
I can drive on snowmobile trails. Snowmobilers come flying around the corner
and they stop and cannot believe it. I open the sliding door and make them
hot chocolate on the stove while they admire my rig. 

Sometimes the snowmobile trail gets very very steep. Then I take the portable
4,000 lb winch out of my back seat and connect it to the frame in the front
of the vehicle and winch up the trail until it gets more flat so I can resume
normal driving. 

I usually try to reach a mountain top or mountain pass where I pop the roof
and make dinner on the stove with the heaters on. In the morning I resume
driving down the other side of the mountain or pass, hoping that there are no
weak bridges I have to cross to get back on pavement.  If the bridges are out
I remove huge boards from my roof which are 3.5 inches thick and which run
the length of the vehicle. With these I manufacture my own bridge before
moving on.

Here is what this will do *to* you:

The first syncro westy I had was an '87 and I had about $20,000 of warranty
bills on it before I crashed it into a deer and it was totalled. (all the
parts are now in the attick)

The second syncro westy I had was a '90 and I have had about $15,000 of
warranty bills on it so far, including a brand new syncro trans at $4,000.
Needless to say, I don't have to pay these warranty bills.

I have another three years left to go on the warranty and will attempt to
drive VW out of the US market paying to fix my van.

I love this car to death.
