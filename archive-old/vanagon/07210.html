Hello,
After tasting the worst taste in my life (brake fluid) and under Joel's
and William's prompting, I did call the Rocky Mtn. Poison Control center.
It turns out that brake fluid is only poisionous in the following
circumstances: You get a mouth-full and breath in quickly.  This takes
the brake fluid into your lungs and causes a sort-of chemical pneumonia.
This is most frequently seen in small children.  However, if the brake
fluid is swallowed (or motor oil for that matter) it will pass through
your digestive system.  Of course, it will taste bad for a while.
Thanks, Joel and William for your concern!
Still, it is the worst taste that I've ever tasted!
Also, I assume that all this applies to fairly small quantities.
Stuart
