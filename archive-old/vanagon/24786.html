Yuppie Eurovan response from Jeff &lt;snip!&gt; ;)

&gt;Jeff then said:
&gt;I've caught this feeling of &quot;cooler than thou 'cuz my veedub is (fill in
&gt;the blank-older, newer, air cooled, water cooled, super modified, stock,
&gt;etc.)&quot; from a number of posts in the past and let it go by. This time
&gt;(right phase of the moon, just enough caffeine, right time of day) I just
&gt;felt like responding. It kinda bugged me; I feel better now.

Rusty says:
Caffine! I knew it, un huh, un huh... Double Latte Mocha Fudge perhaps?
Beside you even knew who &quot;WAR&quot; was (and probably could recognize Neil Young
in an elevator). Un huh, un huh...
