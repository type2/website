Subject: Re: Hearses? fwd from usenet

The PO of my Vanagon was a Menonite farmer and (of course) painted it 
black.  I suppose it could qualify as a possible hearse, but I prefer to 
think of it as a former Secret Service vehicle. ;-)

&gt; &gt; I've never seen a hearse version. It seems strange that this is missing

&gt; I thought this was a good question and could probably be better answered
