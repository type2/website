Subject: 82 Vanagon Diesel FS  With Gas engine!

Listees,

  I STILL have this Vanagon For Sale.  I'm in Santa Cruz Cal (70 mile 
south of San Fran).

  I'm askiing $1200.00 for this Van.  It's two tone blue and was 
converted to gas a number of years ago.  The present engine is blown-up. 
 I have a number of used engines that would make Great canidates for 
this van; including the engine from a 92 Golf with 70K on the engine!

  There are also a set of 15&quot; MBZ rims on this van too!  I have recently 
found that there are a couple of very simple ways to convert the diesel 
trans to a Taller geared transmission for much better driveablity.

  I want to sell this van in one piece.  I don't want to part-out this 
van.  I hope that someone out there can see that this is a good deal and 
will benifit by this.

  Kyle
