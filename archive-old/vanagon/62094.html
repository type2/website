Hello again,

Thanks for the info on checking for my vacuum leak with WD 40 on my
newly-purchased 83 water-cooled Westy. I got no response between the air
distributor and the manifolds and was beginning to get depressed. THEN I hit
the spot where the throttle body meets the air distributor and VROOOOOM. So I
ordered a new throttle body gasket for that spot.

My question is once I install the new gasket how tight do I torque the screws
that hold the throttle body to the air distributor? The two screws are
currently tightened all the way home, that seems to compromise the gasket,
kind of jamming it till it buckles out a bit. Although it may just be because
the gasket is old and stiff.

The other question is, will this prove to be the whole problem? 

(Just for history, my engine, a VW of Canada rebuilt long block with about
1,000 miles idles rough and uneven. At higher revs it seems Ok. I just
cleaned up all the connections on all the ground wires I could find, and the
braided ground on the left side.)

Thanks also for the previous exhaust tips. I caught some thread on the #4
cylinder exhaust bolt that the DPO &quot;mechanic&quot; had cross-threaded on
installation which lead to a connection that was less than insulated. He also
chose not to install the second bolt at that cylinder, which I, since I'm
kind of old-fashioned, decided to install.

Thanks again for any tips and info.
Jeff
