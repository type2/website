I am interested in any seat that installs directly into an 84 Vanagon and
swivels without any mods. The camper swivel is welded in and is a real
pain to remove so it is a almost last resort. Any info on any seat that is
a direct replacement with no swivel is good as well as my seat are in good
condition but none too comfortable.  If anyone has the swivel from a
camper in a trashed camper available also please let me know.=20
    I think I covered all those bases.
