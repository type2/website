&gt;&gt; I've always found it humorous that with the thousands of things that can 
&gt;&gt; go wrong with a car that will put it out of commission, we carry spare 
&gt;&gt; tires.  I don't get it.  I've put on hundreds of thousands of miles in my 
&gt;&gt; life, and I've NEVER had a flat tire on the road.  It just makes me 
&gt;&gt; chuckle.

FUnny you should mention flat tires.

Last weekend, as I was working on my bus, I noticed a screw embedded straight
in on the right rear tire.  &quot;Oh well!&quot; sez I, since the beast isn't running 
anyway.

But then last night, I'm checking the tranny flud in my 911, and there is
a screw in the SAME tire in the exact same manner!  I pulled it out - the
sucker was 4 inches long!

Boy, what an omen!
