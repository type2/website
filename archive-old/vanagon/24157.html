Subject: Add another Syncro Westie to the Stats, Joel.

     We safely made it home to end the Silver Syncro Westie Mad Dash Across
     America: bought the beast in Pendleton OR , drove to Seqouia Nat'l
     Park to Death Valley to Las Vegas to Zion Nat'l Park to Monument
     Valley to Mesa Verde to Kansas to Busses by the Arch (but had to leave
     early - can someone post a synopsis?) and then finally home to
     Maryland.

     The Syncro Westie was great. Had a few minor glitches, one nervous
     phone call to Joel about the CVs, but his excellent diagnosis and
     a little grease solved that. Connected with a few list members, and
     missed a few. Once I get through my inbox and have a little time, I'll
     post the notes I took along the ride...and a few questions that have
     developed....
