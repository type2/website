David,

Maybe I don't understand something about propane.  I'm pretty sure the gauge
you're talking about measures tank pressure, right?  As I understand it, propane
is a liquid in the tank.  Where it meets the airspace in the tank the liquid gas
turns (actually it supposedly boils!) to the gas vapor we burn in our fridges/stoves.
 Therefore (I think?) a pressure gauge would almost always read full, until the
tank is almost completely empty.

Is your experience different? Does the gauge ever really show less than full or
almost completely empty? Is there any middle reading?

Anyone else on the list have any insights?
