&gt;My van also leaks oil :-( I hate to see the puddle on the ground, but I 
&gt;have been told that it is common to most VW's.  It is coming from the 
&gt;oil filter bracket where it connects to the engine. I tried to take 
&gt;this bracket off, but cannot get at the bolts which hold it in?  Any 
&gt;suggestions?  Also could it be coming from the oil cooler?  Could I fix 
&gt;that without pulling the engine? FYI it seems to be leaking about a 
&gt;1/2L (1 pint?) every 500km (380mi).  Does it need to  be fixed??

Adam,

Check the oil pressure sending unit, located on top of the engine, 
toward the rear (rear is rear), slightly to the left of center.  It may 
be ruptured and leaking oil.  If that's your problem, you're in luck, as 
a new one costs about $5.  One size fits all for air-cooled VWs.  You'll 
need a deep-well 15/16&quot; (or metric equivalent) socket to replace the 
sender.  Tighten 'til snug and then a little more.

Good Luck,
