List members:
I made a set of cup holder that have served me well.  I used the hook
type, window mount cup holders made of heavy plastic.  Look for the
larger sized holders.  I mounted them on the plastic panel that routes
the air for the floor vents.

1. First slide the panel out and remove it.
2. SLOWLY heat the cup holder hook, with a blow torch,to a straighten
the first bend.

3. Then SLOWLY heat and reshape a new bend to match the top of the Vent
panel.   A piece of double sided tape or small screw will secure it.

These holders work well and are protected from breakage by the shifter.
Based on usage this is the best modification I have made to my van.

If anyone what to try it drop me a note. I may be able to clarify the
steps or possibly make a few to sent out to my fellow coffee drinking,
vanagon drivers.

Keep the faith.
