Subject: Possibly stupid Syncro questions

Hi Syncro Heads---
     You guys are probably tired of answering lame questions, but here goes
anyway: 
     
     I've heard of people driving their cars with the front driveshaft
disconnected.  Is there any reason that this is a good/bad idea?

     Was the differential lock available on any 2wd cars?

     I've heard that &quot;with a few minor mods&quot; these cars can be more rugged
and reliable.  What kinda mods are we talking about?

     I got more, but I'll spare you.  Many thanks!

     Matt in Laguna Beach
