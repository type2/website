More correctly, it applies to a special fan shroud used on upright engines,
starting in '70 or '71.

The doghouse shroud has the oil cooler offset from the air stream, so 
#3 gets its fair share of air.  It also uses a bigger (24mm) fam instead
of the 19 or 20mm fan.

This is all a moot point for your '74...

BTW - having the doghouse setup has an additional advantage - more airflow
for the heater!
