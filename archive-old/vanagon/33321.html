Subject: Re: Mineral to Synthetic?

As was written:
_____________________________

Stick with conventional/mineral oil.  all that synthetic is is expensive.
and if you have even say a minor leak well its $4 a quart.   I have owned
vehicles before (VW and other) that have never had anything but regular old
motor oil in them.  and some of these vehicles have gone over 200,000 miles.
I also used to work in auto parts biz and most eveerybody that bought
synthetic oil had this misconception that they could go longer between oil
changes, like 3,000, 5,000 and some even said 10,000 miles.  i'm glad I'll
never be buying one of these peoples cars, but then again how would I know?
Change oil and filter every 2,000 miles and use regular old oil.  thats all
I have to say.

And my comments
___________________

Everyones experience with Synthetic vs. Mineral oil are going to be
anecdotal.  I started using Synthetic because I think doing an oil change
every 2,000 or 3,000 miles is a pain in the butt.  I started running Mobil
One in my 1985 VW Jetta after the first 7.500 miles with mineral and three
oil changes in that period, one at 1,000 miles, one at 3,750 miles and
changing to Mobil One at 7,500 miles with changes at 7,500 miles thereafter.
This was with old formula 5W30 Mobil One, not with the improved formula
(15W30 and 15W40--I think)--and this was before Castrol introduced their
version of Synthetic.

At 145,000 miles and some change, I sold the car.  I got a look at the
ovehead cam close to the point of selling to change a valve cover gasket and
it looked brand new.  I checked the compression at this point and it was
almost to factory specs for a new engine.

Comparing this to my experience running mineral oil, changed at 2,500--3,000
mile intervals in my cars previous to the Jetta, a 1980 FI Westmoreland
Rabbit and a 1981 Diesel Passat/Dasher; at the 100,000 mile intervals when I
sold these cars, the compression was nowhere as close to new as my
experience with the Jetta.

That's my anecdote--the SAE has better proof and the Society's testing shows
far superior performance coming from synthetics in the engine wear
department--don't know what they say about leaks.  I also like the idea of
not creating another 5 quarts of toxic waste every six weeks to 2 months.  I
hope someone's using all that waste oil for something.

As far as what my compression is in the Vanagon--well it was probably pretty
low when I bought the beast last year and changed it over to synthetic.
I've never checked it--I don't wanna know!
