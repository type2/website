Subject: Re: 1955 Barndoor Kombi for sale

The bus belongs to my daughter Clara, it is in Olympia Wa, She will be
leaving the San Francisco Bay Area at 9am on 1/2/95 to go to A and will get
there probably on Wed or Thur. Her number her is (415)XXX-XXXX, in Olympia it
is (206)XXX-XXXX, the price is somewhre between $4K and $5K
					        ^^^ Too much fo me! :'(

I just know someone on this list wants this bus REALLY BAD, almost
as much as I do... I think that I know Clara, and I'll have to ask
why she's selling her bus. BTW, I though barndoors ended in 1954...
I'll give the phone #'s to whoever is interested, as I think posting
private #'s over the list would be rude.
