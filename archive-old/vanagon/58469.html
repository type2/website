Subject: Gas heater (Vanagon 85)

Hi,

I know that the tail pipe of the gas heater of my Westfalia 85 is
broken. I never use this heater, it seems that the cost of this part
(heater tail pipe) is about 55$CDN. Does this heater is usable in
camping (I mean to heat the camper in the beginning of night). If I
decide to use this heater, should I buy a CO detector?

Thanks for your input.
