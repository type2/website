Greetings Volks --

I've been lurking on this interesting list for a couple of months or so, having
just bought an '82 Westfalia this fall.  I now find myself in a significant
bind, and need to tap the collective wisdom of the net.

Ok, here's the scoop:  Van runs well and is in generally good shape, but the
exhaust system is rusted to heck (our MN tax dollars at work -- they don't plow
up here, just dump lotsa chemicals on the roadway until it clears ;-) )  So,
last week, the muffler and catalytic converter fall off the vehicle (happened
right in my driveway, luckily); exhaust pipe broke right at the 180-degree
elbow on the driver's side.  Local shops can get the muffler and other parts
(catalytic still serviceable), but the J-shaped pipe that bolts to the flanges
on the heater boxes is too far gone to weld or otherwise attach to -- and no
one has the part!  I've had a couple of local shops run through their sources
and follow up leads and have come up empty handed; VWoA claims that the part is
obsolete and no longer available; everyone knows what the thing is but nobody
has one!

So now the $64,000 question:  Does anyone on the list have a suggestion for a
source for this part (new)?  It is VW part no. 071-251-497-B.  I'd rather not
resort to checking salvage yards, but that's looming as my only other option. 
There are a couple of aftermarket setups available, but they don't allow space
for the catalytic, and wouldn't be legal here :(.

Thanks in advance --
Jon

'82 Westy (roars like a lion!)
