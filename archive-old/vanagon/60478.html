Welcome to the club, brother!  My '83 had the same problem, intermitant,
of course.  Mechanic put a little booster box and that worked for a
while, then back to crawling under with a screwdriver.  Finally ran a
wire from solenoid to battery, with a starter button on top of the
battery case.  BTW, it still starts with the key in cool whether.  The
real problem is in the old wiring, in my case where the harness makes a
tight 180 around metal near the engine.

Good luck,

TBill
P.S. I'm off on a 1500 mi trip, better wish me luck!
