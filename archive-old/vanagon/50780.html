Subject: Re: Golf/Jetta engine in gas Vanagon


&gt;Has anyone heard of a Golf/Jetta engine in a Synchro?  Can you bolt a
&gt;diesel bellhousing onto a synchro tranny?

It should be possible: The AUDI bellhousing to Vangon tranny is same
for 2WD's and 4WD's. Do you like your 16v? I have a picture at home
with a 16v built into a Vanagon (2WD, diesel bellhousing and adaptor),
but the torque problem to the syncro tranny is another theme.
