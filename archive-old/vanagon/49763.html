Subject: Hd Gasket Leak '85

My 85 Westy has been diagnosed  with a leaky head gasket thru a pressure
check followed by a visual check. It looks like this will be an expensive
repair although the repair costs seem to vary quite a bit depending on wheter
or not the heads are pitted. I am praying that the block is not pitted. I am
told but don't know why the heads/block cannot be shaved to remove the
pitting. I have the following estimates:
Dealer #1 - $1800-2400 assuming pitted heads and depending on repair of parts
that
disintegrate durring disassembly
Dealer #2 - $500-700 heads not pitted, up to $1800 if heads pitted
Local VW Mechanic - $1100 using an special sealant which seals the pitted
heads from an aftermarket guy in New Jersey
My questions are:
1. Has anyone had experience with any kind of sealant that seals pitted heads
2. Which comes first, leaking gasket or pitted heads
3. If only one head gasket leaks, why replace both head gaskets at the same
time

If the heads aren't pitted it's $5-700 but I don't know if they are pitted.
The special sealant saves money if the heads are pitted but it is also a bit
of a risk.
Anyone's experience on this problem is welcome.

Thanks
