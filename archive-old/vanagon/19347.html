Subject: RE: baja trip - dates?

 Martha sez:

&gt; it.  Let me know which weekends in October you all prefer,
&gt; and I'll post the results soon, so that we can all start planning
&gt; datewise accordingly...

  If the Baja trip was to leave, say, San Diego &lt;don't we know someone there?&gt;
  on Friday AM and return there Sunday evening, would that be enough time
  &quot;south of the border&quot;? That would be a 3 day weekend for the So. Cal folks,
  vanagon types from the Bay Area/Arizona/Nuevo Mexico/Alabama and points East
  would likely need Thurs. and Monday to/from San Diego. Does anyone know
  if there are any of those public school type holidays &lt;Columbus Day, etc.&gt;
  during October? What about getting a group rate on Insurance??

     I'd be surprised if we could get a group rate on insurance, and I'd
     be ***WAY*** more inclined to take part/all of Monday off and cross
     the border Monday morning and not Sunday afternoon!!!!!
