Subject: Re: Stickers on VW as Probable Cause, Part 2



&gt;stickers that in any 
&gt;way refer to or depict illegal drugs may be considered probable 
&gt;cause for a search in some states.

To All:

I don't have any stickers on my bus but today a friend suggested a possible
reason for the attention I was shown on entering Canada:  That a load of dope
was coming through and the guards wanted all of the inspectors to be busy.

Cynical as it sounds, it makes more sense than some of the reasons I've been
offered.

-Bob
