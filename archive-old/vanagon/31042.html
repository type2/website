Steve,
The crew-cab has it's bed level about 4&quot;-5&quot; above the regular engine cover
level of a Vanagon.  Did it stick out above where the regular engine cover
would have been and just clear the raised level of the crew-cab bed?  Or (
 hoping here  ) was it low enough to even clear the regular Vanagon engine
cover height?
