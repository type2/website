&gt; All right, finally we break through to the Far East. Boston is 8-10hrs away, 
&gt; count us in for anything between there and Maine. White/ Green Mountains NH, 
&gt; are great, except for those diesel Westies. Get your &quot;This vehicle smogged 
&gt; Mt Washington&quot; stickers here.  tim s.
&gt; 
OK, either a northern or a southern eastern leg is good with me but
I think we need to decide one or the other already, clearly some
are going to be inconvenienced either way which is why I suggested
keeping it in the central eastern area ie Virginia, DC, N Carolina
(which addmittedly is excellent for me) but also because if we want to
meet the western leg at St Louis for our start but keep the entire thing
under a week and a half say, we don't want to have to travel two or
three days just to get to whereever we intend to spend most of our time, 
lets get everyone interested to give their geographic locations, email me
if you want, and your area of preference for the tour, also give how
long it would take you to get to St. Louis for the start as this will be
an inportant consideration, plus a lot of us could group together on the
way to St. Louis for the start.
