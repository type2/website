Subject: Help..............won't stop

Hi Volks!


My new lodger has a problem with his 1972 camper. Basically the brakes are awful.
It stops but not quick enough to feel safe in. He's fitted new drums, shoes, pads,
master cylinder, slave cylinders, etc...basically the lot, but it still slowly
grinds to a hault.

Apparently the brakes on a '72 are unique to that year and it is a '72 specific
problem with it's own individual cures......_dot_can anyone help????


Thanks In Advance


Neal
