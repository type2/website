Subject: national address server URL


Given a valid U.S. postal address, this server attempts to rewrite the address in the proper
                                                         format along with the ZIP+4 code. If it is successful, you can retrieve a Postscript or a GIF file
                                                         of the address for printing, with a barcode! You can also view a street map of the address, from 2
                                                         different Internet map sites (MapBlast and MapQuest).
