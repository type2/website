Subject: Tires &amp; Wheels for '89 Vanagon

Hi,
I know that we've been round and round about wheels and tires in this group
(no pun intended).  I've got an '89 Westy with an automatic.  I'd like to
decrease engine rpm/road speed and I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of the
van's blistering (not) accelleration.  So, I'd like to put some taller tires
on the van.  I've currently go standard 5.5&quot; x 14&quot; steel wheels.  I thought
of putting some 205s on them, but I think that they would be too tall and
I'd wind up with too much distance between the wheel and the tread making
the van's abysmal handling even worse.  So, I thought, why not put 6&quot; x 15&quot;
wheels on and then I would not have to worry so much about huge sidewalls.
Now the question is, where could I get 6 x 15s with the correct offset?
Don't Chevy (perish the thought) wheels have the same bolt pattern?  Any
suggestions???

Thanks,
Bo
