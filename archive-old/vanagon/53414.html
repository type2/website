   Start with the ignition system test:
   Pull a plug wire off of a spark plug and insert a screw drive into
   the end of the wire. Hold the screw dirve 1/4&quot; away from a good ground
   point. Have someone crank the motor. You should see a spark.
   If you see spark----   
   Check fuel system:
   With a can of starting fluid, spray in to the intake manifold, 1 quick
   shot. Crank engine. It should run for a split second if there is spark.

&gt; I checked it out looking for anythign obvious...nothing. I checked to see
&gt; if there was any spark, and there was.
&gt; 
&gt; Now where should I go? I would do somethign if I knew a good place to
&gt; start...fuel pump maybe? Suggestions???
&gt; 
&gt; I'd appreciate any replies. I want to take advatage of break and go
