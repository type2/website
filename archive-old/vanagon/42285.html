Subject: Vancouver BC VW meet Sunday May 19


Saw a poster for a VW meet when I was at the VW dealership getting parts.

Sunday, May 19, 10am - 4 pm
Waterfront Park, North Vancouver  (3 blocks W of Lonsdale off Esplanade)
Fee $5.00
All VWs welcome

Sponored by Bulli Boys Transporter Club and Capilano VW
Phone Capilano VW for details (985-0694)

Pre-registration suggested (for those entering the show, I guess)

*Loads* of disclaimers here, just thought it sounded like fun.  Christa 
and I will probably go, unless the rain is real bad.
