Subject: Re: [F] Saving the planet

In a message dated 96-03-15 23:37:29 EST, you write:

&gt;&gt;Don't reproduce.  Speaks for itself.
&gt;
&gt;It sure does. In this way we'll &quot;save the planet&quot; for those who actually
&gt;deserve it. Uh, who were they again?
&gt;
&gt;

This just falls into my theory that, eventually, red squirrels with rule the
Earth with cute little iron fists!   Squirrels!  There not just yard vermin
anymore.
