&gt;While I'm on this thread, does anyone know of aftermarket coil springs that
&gt;would fit a later-model vanagon, to give a stiffer ride and maybe even more
&gt;clearance? I've looked into this with local (San Diego) FLAPS and suspension
&gt;shops, sith no luck. While the factory lowering job VW did to vanagons
&gt;starting in '88 does give 'em better road manners, it also makes 'em more
&gt;vulnerable to damage from uneven surfaces. If I'm not mistaken, the later
&gt;models also have generally softer suspension. The '84 I had previously
&gt;seemed much more 'truck-like', not only higher off the ground but with
&gt;tougher suspension. Maybe I can get some coil springs made for an early
&gt;model and put them on the '90?? Could life possible be that simple?

from what i've been able to see and hear and figure out, that's about the
only alternative you have: get the springs from an earlier camper and put
them on. and then have the alignment done at the earlier model specs.
it seems that the 30mm lowering on the 85-&gt; Wolfsburgs and the 88-&gt; all
models was done by cutting a coil off the spring, and redoing the alignment.
at least, that what it seems to me. the alignment specs for the 88-&gt; is
the &quot;half-loaded&quot; specs for the 80-85 models, and there doesn't seem to be
any special suspension parts (except the spring) for the later models.
