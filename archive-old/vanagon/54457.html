   Yes,
     There is 3 very small nuts on the inside of the fender. Warning!
     New mud flaps are not avalable, even from the dealer. I broke 2
     of the 12 (total) nuts off. In this case most people are in a
     real jam. Before removing use alot of liquid Wrench. Also work
     the nuts in and out to prevent breaking.

                   Good luck ERic Zeno
