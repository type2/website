Matt and Everyone Else,

I found that the springs were strong enough until the peg starts to slip out 
(as you found out), and then the mirrors start to drift.  When this happened 
at in about '87 and '90 on my '84, I replaced the peg with a bolt.  In other 
words, I extended (drilled) the peg hole right through the top of the mirror 
mount.  I countersunk the top surface a bit for the bolt head, and replaced 
the original peg with a bolt.  It looks fine, and what's more important, no 
more slipping mirrors.

Mike
