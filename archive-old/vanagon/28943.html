Subject: Re: Filling the gap in the pop-top

&gt;
&gt;I don't know if this type of bed is common in campmobiles, but it is, for
&gt;me, very practical. It provides some degree of protection from the cool
&gt;air sneaking in through the top, and adds to the utility of this already
&gt;amazingly useful vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;I'll be happy to share more details to any interested volks.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe

 Just gotta brag here a little (feeling a bit verbose).  I'm not much of a
mechanic, but few appreciate their Vanagon more.  We bought the 81 Westy
with 15K miles on it, and have taken meticulous care of it.  The top canvas
is flawless, and the bunk barely slept in, since there are only 2 of us,
and it's cozy down there on cool nights.  The original carpets have never
been stepped on; they are covered with full carpet remnants.  The stove has
the original blue plastic sheet on the inside of the lid.  It has never
been used for cooking (always use a Coleman stove outside to keep the
interior clean).  Felix has 80K miles on the body, which is almost without
battle scars.  The Michelin XZXs keep it riding and handling superbly.
Yes, I am proud of this baby.  Last year I replaced the headliner and
various other mylar coverings which were peeling. As for rust, well this is
Calif.  A little has begun to emerge under the rear &amp; front window frames,
that's all.  With the new engine, Felix is a proud cat.
