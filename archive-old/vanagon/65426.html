Subject:      Re: EV chassis?

The EV is available as:

Bus, with windows, short and long wheelbase
Panel, without windows, short and long wheelbase
Crewcab, with high or low rear bed
Singlecab, with high or low rear bed
Crew- or Singlecab without any rear attachments (just chassis)
All version are available for regular purchase.

There are 'bimobil' and 'Tischer' who builds camping cabins
for the EV Crew- or Singlecab which can be removed and others
conversion companies like Karmann who builds campers like
the Rialta.

I'm still searching for someone who like to service a
Vanagon and EV camping conversion web site where to store
pics and descriptions. Anyone interested?
