Subject:      windshield replacement

I know this has been discussed before, but a friend of mine is replacing
the front windshield.  The rubber has been found to be torn a bit, and the
people putting the new one in have apparently used caulk to enhance the
seal.  Is this the appropriate thing to do??  What else should be done
when installing a new front windshield??  Thanks

david
