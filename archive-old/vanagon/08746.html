&gt; &gt; 2. A sticking thermostat.  Once in a while the engine actually is hot.  
&gt; &gt; Why doesn't the fan run?  Well, dummy (speaking to self) because the 
&gt; &gt; water isn't hot enough to run.  How do I know it will run?  Because I 
&gt; &gt; turned on the AC and the fan did indeed run.  Why isnt' the water hot?  
&gt; &gt; Because it's the engine that's hot, but water is not circulating by the fan.

I may have misread something earlier, so I'll post this addedum to my 
earlier post.

Did you not say that you got coolant to flow out of the bleeder screw on 
the top of the radiator?  If so, then you have coolant circulating,  was 
the coolant that came out of the bleeder screw hot?  Then perhaps your 
thermostat is OK, again, try the sender connection or replace the switch.
