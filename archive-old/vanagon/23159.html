Hello, one of the things I got to do this weekend was drain my gastank
to replace the filter in there.  I had figured I would reuse the old 
gaskets since my new filter didn't come with them.  This would be a 
'71 bus.  Well, the old one didn't have any gaskets!  It did look like
there was some kind of sealer in there, mostly gone.  This thing had 
never leaked.  So, I used tiny amounts of permatex 3 on all sealing 
surfaces and screwed the thing back together.  Will this hold or 
should I do something else?  I am closer than ever to finishing this 
project.  All of the wiring in the engine compartment is done and some
of the exhaust and tin is installed.  I got stopped on Sunday evening 
for want of some lock washers.  Doh!  Thanks, Jim
