I saw this one at a bike race recently.  I think the bus was a '78 but
it should work on all bay windows and probably most splits.  The guy 
took a Yakima that was for rain gutters and mounted it on the back 
door.  You can pivot the mounts 90 degrees on the top cross bar to 
keep the thing from sliding off.  The bikes point up.  He had put the 
bike mounts far enough toward the outside so that you could get to the
engine.  He also said he used a big wooden dowel to keep the thing up 
if he wanted to open the back hatch.  You could also use the &quot;C&quot; 
yakima rack with the rain gutter clips.  You might need to use some 
extra silcone or something as I think the clip messed with the rubber 
seal a little.  I looked at the arm that holds that door on there and 
it looks like it could take the extra weight of the rack and a couple 
of bikes.  I don't know if I would risk more than that.  Any 
experience with this?  Jim
