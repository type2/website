Subject: motors posted for sale?


  Sorry Volks,

  I lost the post from the person that had the 2 engines For Sale :(  1
complete bad headgaskets, other Longblock core.  I'd meant to e-mail him but
lost his post prior to doing so.

  If anybody knows who I'm talking about, or if the Owner of these 2 engines
sees this post, Please E-Mail ME!!!!!!
