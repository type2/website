&gt;  Does anyone out there have the phone number for &quot;The Parts Place&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  I also would like to know what experience you all have with them..

&gt; 
I have their old number handy, (313) 373-2300  but the area code changed
if you call this one they will probably give you the new area code but
your out $.40 or whatever for the call, you could call info but probably
the same price, they are in Opdyke or Auburn Hills, MI.

As to experience, I must say over the years it has been mixed for me.
They are usually very fair on price and only sell high quality
merchandise, their catalog can be a treasure trove of info for a 
VW newbie, I've given copies to people who went mad at the money
that had paid for some things on later H20 cars locally.  Sometimes
their prices are out of line though for air cooled stuff, for instance
front bay window rotors, OEM Cofab from VW &gt;$100, from parts place $80,
from Whitneys $50, of course I didn't know the Whitneys would be Cofab,
I simply took a chance, they can also screw up your order, even when you
have been most specific, got a center muffler for my Quantum Syncro from
them for $300, dealer price $500+ but it took one incorrect muffler sent
to me first, returns are no problem if they mess up except for the waste
of your time and return shipping, still the savings was worth it, over
the years I have done front wheel bearings for the Quantum, Rabbits,
Jetta, all at between 25 and 50% off dealer, and they rent the puller,
they sourced us a power steering pump for our '86 van used but low
mileage and at an incredible savings, got a lot of bits and pieces for
the '76 from them, etc.  Generally a good place but shop around they can
be beat, however make sure you are getting the same quality, and be
prepared to deal with a few misordered items now and again.  They can
save you alot of money on some parts like Wasserboxer exhaust components
and very little on others, some CV joint boots for instance, all depends
on the parts.
