Subject: Looking For Gas Heater Parts - 

I am still looking for parts for a BN4 Vanagon/Bus Gas Heater. If you have
the twelve volt squirrel cage fan and sundry connector part that fit
underneath, please let me know.


I spoke to Ark Mirvis of Hopatcong, NJ of ARK Heater's fame BTW. Nice Guy
and informative. He tried to steer me away from any of the original VW gas
heaters saying they were both unreliable and prone to early failure. He does
not carry parts for Eberspacher Heaters.

Thanks again
