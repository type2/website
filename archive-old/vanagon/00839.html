Subject:       Re: More rebuild/new engine questions

 
&gt; Also, there is an outfit in town that will recondition my existing heads
&gt; for $189.  I told him that there is a piece missing from the head around the
&gt; exhaust valve seat, and he said that that would not be a problem as they 
&gt; could arc weld a piece in.  This sounds *really* fishy to me.  Even if it
&gt; would hold, I would immagine it would have terrible thermal contact with the
&gt; rest of the head and get quite hot.  What say?

Does this &quot;outfit in town&quot; realize that your heads are not cast and 
may be a little difficult to arc weld.  If you are rebuilding your 
old heads or having them done be sure that you replace all of the 
valves with new ones.  If your head has a peice missing it would be 
better to get another used one to work with. Good luck.
