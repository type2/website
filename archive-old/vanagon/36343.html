Subject: I need Thermostat setup for T4

To all

I bought a 1974 1700cc Westy before I knew squat about VW's.  It was 
an impulse buy, what can I say I loved the thing already.  I am 
rebuilding the entire engine.  When I tore it down I noticed there 
was no thermostat, likage rod, flaps, etc. There is a pulley. :-).  
Well I need to get the thermostat assemble.  Anyone have a spare they 
want to sell?  If not, Where can I get one.  There are no junkyard 
aroung here with type 4's(Gainesville, Florida).

P.S. I still don't know much more than squat (-:

Thanks
