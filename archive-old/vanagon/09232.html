&gt; The belly pan you speak of is a stock part used only on the 
&gt; double sided door versions of the Typ2. Its primary purpose 
&gt; is to add additional strength to the body because of 
&gt; the sets of doors on both sides of the body. 
&gt; 
My '68 Westy had these, too.  I assumed it was because Westys start with 
a sunroof body (you can see the pocket for the roof section to slide into 
as well as the location for the crank handle); thus the need for extra 
stiffening.  [Now: all list members with double-doors, sunroofs, and 
westys go out right now and check for belly pans :-).  Note: mine ran on 
the sides only (not covering the heat channel section -- good note on 
that, Dworkin).

&gt;        and a bloodhound.

AMEN to that, bro.  And all the while maintaining that snotty &quot;you 
don't know the parts biz like I do, bud&quot; attitude. Some of you may recall 
my frustrating search for a new Master Cylinder for my '68 Westy last 
year.  Sheesh.  Caveat Emptor.
