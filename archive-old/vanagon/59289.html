Subject: Re: Cup holders

Hi Volks,
   I think this has been covered before but I'll put my 2 cents in
again.  Since Germans do not belive in eating or drinking while driving
the their cars they rarely put in cup holders.  Later Vanagons and
Eurovans did get a cheap cup holders. They are those little black or
sometimes painted square fold out holders that can be bought at the
Local department store.  I got 2 for my '82 at Wal -mart and they only
cost me about 3 bucks each. 
   I designed a wooden cup holder that mounts on top of the Dash board.
My buddys grandfather made up a few of them for me, but unfortunately
he's become ill and cannot make anymore. If someone is skilled at
woodcrafting I can send the plans and prototype and maybe we can get
some made up.  I'll have to make up a design for the later dash as the
one I have now is for an  early, non padded dash.  Take care.
