&gt; When I bought my 84 Vanagon in 1985 I also bought the Bentley manual which

I have the manual that covers the air cooled and diesel vanagon. A friend
has the mondo manual. The big one is fun to read, but strangely does not
have a picture and description of antenna replacement, the little manual does.
What does this mean? Why did they leave this out? Are there other
discrepencies?
