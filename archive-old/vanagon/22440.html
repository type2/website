Subject: 84 Vanagon Fuel Pump


A friend of mine with an 84 Vanagon just called me to ask
if he was getting hosed for a $375 fuel pump.  I said he
probably was.  I don't think a fuel pump should cost more 
than $150.  If the installation is similar to my former
77 Westy, then there is nothing to it.

Having never worked on a Vanagon before I need to know the 
part number, price, and any installation info that someone
who has only worked on splits &amp; bays would need to know.

Thanks in advance.
