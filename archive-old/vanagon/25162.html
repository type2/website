So Ron Lussier says:

&gt; Howdy!
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to get the fridge started yesterday for my trip to Yosemite, and it
&gt; wouldn't start!  I pumped and pumped, and then pressed the 'starter' button.
&gt; It would seem to start briefly, but then the 'pilot light' would start to
&gt; flash again.  There is propane in the tank... the stove works fine.
&gt; 

You probably have some kind of 'blockage' in your ventilation lines/hoses.
Some of the folks out there have had success by blowing out the system 
from the little drain tube at the bottom of the fridge with a compressor.
The usual complaint is spider webs.  You can prevent this by using the
handy-dandy flue vent cover that can be had from Euro-American (former
Delta-Six Ind.
