Subject: Re:  VW-'71 BUS-QUESTION ABOUT MOUNTING BOLTS

&gt;I bought a long block for my '71 Bus but during installation it became
&gt;clear that the case didn't have the nut pressed into the upper left (as
&gt;you face the engine from the rear of the Bus) mounting hole.  With the
&gt;extra ducting on the fan housing for this year, I can't figure out a way
&gt;to get the nut on the bolt coming in from the front (by the clutch
&gt;adjustment nut).  My questions are as follows:
&gt;
&gt;   1) Is there an easier way to get the nut on the bolt that the usual way
&gt;      of approaching it from the left side of the fan housing?
I just did this over the weekend in my '71 bus.  It didn't have a nut pressed
in.  I first put the nut on the bolt (outside of the engine compartment) and
ran it back and forth a few times to make sure it turned easy.  Then I put
the bolt through the trasmission from underneath.  I put a ratchet on it with
an extension and just let it hang.  Then from inside it GENTLY started the
nut (so as not to push the bolt) and tightened it up with a wrench.  I didn't
have the rear support on yet and the engine was tilted down enough that I could
stick my head around on the RIGHT side to see what I was doing.  The ratchet
kept the bolt from turning.  I didn't really have that much problem.  In fact,
the other upper one was harder because the bolt kept turning and I couldn't
hold it because of the starter.

&gt;
&gt;   2) Given that I have the three other 17mm nuts securely tightened, plus
&gt;      the rear mounting bar on, do I really need to get the upper left
&gt;      bolt on?
Probably not.  Mine didn't have one when I took the engine out.  But I figured
it just wouldn't be &quot;right&quot;.  :)
