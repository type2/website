What is this &quot;not good for the alternator&quot; stuff?  And who is the
mechanic that is willing to admit to saying it?  You cannot hurt your
alternator by connecting two batteries together, unless your alternator
is *between* them and you are &quot;connecting&quot; them physically with a vice.
Even then the alternator will probably be okay.  You cannot hurt your
alternator by hooking it to a dead battery.  You cannot hurt your
alternator by hooking it to a battery that is &quot;too large&quot;.  An
alternator is merely a bunch of wire spinning around (inside of a
magnetic field).  It is very hard to hurt it.  If you're going to worry
about something, worry about your cylinder heads.  :)
