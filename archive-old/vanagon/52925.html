Subject: Ignition timing adjustment.
Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 05:33:03 +0000

The ignition timing mark on my '84 vanagon GL 1.9L will only make it to 10
or 11 o'clock when I try to make adjustment with a timing light.  Any
further towards the crankcase halves and it wants to stall. I checked it at
850-900 rpm per Bentley and I can watch the timing advance if I speed up the
engine but it dies if I try to line up the mark. 
Would any other engine problem/failure cause this?

Also, after reconnecting the idle stabilizer, I tried to test it by putting
the automatic transmission in drive and reverse, but did not see any timing
advance.  
Does this indicate the idle stabilizer is bad? 
Bentley describes a load test by engaging 4th gear, but no procedure for
automatic transmissions.

Thanks,
