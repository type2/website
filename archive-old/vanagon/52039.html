&gt;there and it fit perfectly. It is a Sears Diehard international series. 
&gt;The best one they had. Paid $70. Lots of power. Model number available on 
&gt;request.

The problem with &quot;real&quot; batteries is that they're not deep cycle.  They'll
quickly die if you use them to power the van when camping.
