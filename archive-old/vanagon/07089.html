Subject: Fuel guage &amp; speedo problems

Instrumentation problems!  The speedo is quick -- it is slow getting up to
the mark, doing so in spurts, and then it hangs at 20mph when I am stopped.
Probably getting gummed up somehow -- I sprayed WD40 in it that last time
this happened, and it seemed to work.  same again, perhaps?  Other lubricant
ideas? Different problem likely?

Fuel guage is a new one.  Seems to not know whether it wants to work or
not.  Sometimes it is fine, then it will act as though I shut off the
ignition.  Bumps seem to affect it.  At one point, I thought that wiggling
the wires on the connector to the instrument cluster was affecting it,
but now I'm not so sure.  Could the sensor be going south?  If so, is this
an easy fix?  Has anyone troubleshot this behavior before?

Any assistance gratefully received.

Andy
