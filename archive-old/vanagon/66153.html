Subject:      CV Joint Questions

Listees,
we're about to replace two CV joints on the rear axles of our '86 Syncro
Westfalia with two new  Lobro joints. One new CV joint has dark or gray
balls and the other CV joint has shiny &quot;silver&quot; balls. Both Lobro joints
have the same  part number 301137 or C153120198008.  With no wise
cracks, what is the difference? Are both equally dependable?

Next question: For the new joints, I've used kerosene to clean off the
shipping grease. Is this enough preparation before packing with CV joint
grease?

And a similar question: Can I clean the two old joints that I'm re-using
with varsol then blow dry and then clean with kerosene or I should I do
something else?

I was not planning on disassembling either the new or re-used joints. Is
this a mistake?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Larry and Avery Johnson.
