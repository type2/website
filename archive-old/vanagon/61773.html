Subject: Re: pop top seal....  solution?

This compromise would not have worked for me.  My seal was so trashed after
the PO attempted to &quot;secure&quot; it with sheet metal screws into the fiberglass
every 18&quot; or so, so that it *really* sagged in between, that i had no choice
but to replace it.

I ordered one from Ron at the Bus Depot for $68, installed it with no great
difficulty, and it looks great and has added no wind noise.

YMMV,

Gail

&gt;so i think ive come up with a  relatively painless compromise to the

&gt; then push the seal back on.  the rubber alone holds its shape pretty
&gt;well...and when i get more ambitious...ill lay in a bead of silicon between
&gt;the top edge and the fiberglass top.  so after months of wondering what the
&gt;best way of dealing with it was...i was pretty pleased with the result.;)  no
&gt;cost..little fuss...and its still the original rubber seal...which ive heard
&gt;is better than aftermarket seals in reguards to wind noise.
