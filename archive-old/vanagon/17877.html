Subject: Going the other way...


If any of you folks from California on you way to BBTA see a brown and
tan Vanagon stuck on the other side of I70, please stop and help.  I'm
making the trek out to Silicon Valley starting Wednesday.  I.e. I will 
be driving the wrong way on GATT.  Oh, and if I'm not stuck, do wave
for good luck as we pass each other with a relative velocity that may
even exceed the speed limit!

It'll be great to finally meet all of you Bay Area folks soon.  See
ya in CA.

Albrecht (82 Vanagon, new rebuilt engine)
