Subject: Re: Dometic Camper fridges



&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any info on Dometic type fridges? Specifically 
details on how they operate, how to perform maintainence, 
schematics.etc...I'm having a problem with the gas operating mode 
on the fridge in my 85 Westy and I would like to know a little 
about the unit before I pull it out.

Dometic's toll free number (at least as of the last time I called 
them) is (800) 544-4881.  You can reach technical people at that 
number (who I have found to be very helpful), or they can refer you 
to a local service center.  I also have an '85 Westy.  If you have 
any particular questions about using the fridge, e-mail me 
directly.
