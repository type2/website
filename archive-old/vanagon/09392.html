Martha,

I gave Steve Johnson my confirmation #, and I will give it to you too, just
in case it might be useful in securing a nearby campsite.

Hope to see you by 6:30 or so.

John

FWIW here is my confirmation # C4481-5981301

&gt;I'm now bringing some Peet's coffee, too.  Anyone want to throw in
&gt;some Irish Whiskey?  I'll bring whipping cream.  
&gt;
&gt;Also, I'll make hot, mulled redwine, will bring spices, sweetening, etc.,
&gt;but I can't carry enough redwine for all you turkeys in only one vanagaon!
&gt;
&gt;/martha
&gt;
