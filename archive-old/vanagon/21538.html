Subject: Re: Reenforced Deluxe splitties

Two basic responses so far:

#1
&gt;Jim / BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;Being the original owner of a '67 Deluxe myself (over 307K miles), I have
&gt;this &quot;belly pan&quot;.  Seems only the Deluxes in '67 came with this...
...
&gt; Although I could never substantiate it, I'm sure it added to the structural
&gt;integrity. Strange thing is, they only did it for one year and all models
&gt;68-on have the underframes exposed again.  So much for consistency :)

#2
&gt;From: Bob Hufford &lt;bhufford_at_mail.orion_dot_org&gt;
&gt;The pans are additional reinforcement and are found on sun-roof and
&gt;double-door (both sides) models.

#2 is more correct, because the pans are not limited to '67. Bob and I seem
to have very similar panel vans, neither of which are '67s, and both of
which are reinforced with the belly pans.

The Bozobus was my first Type II and I thought that the pans were standard
equipment.  Imagine my surprise when I looked under a Kombi and saw the
bottom of the flooring and support ribs!
