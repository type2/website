&gt; You might check the vent for obstructions by unscrewing the exterior
&gt; outlet fitting. Ensure that your tank is not overfilled. The Dometic
&gt; repairman here said that will prevent starting. Remove the combustion
&gt; chamber drain cap at bottom left facing the refer and drain. Blowing into the
&gt; drain with compressed air, *may* work. Use an air line or tire pump.
&gt; Consult your horoscope for an opportune time to try the above.

Also, my manual says to run the stove for a while.  This will help prime
the system.  But I'd still clean out the ventilation first.  Especially
if you have had no plastic cover on the flue.
