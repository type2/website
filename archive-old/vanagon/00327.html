The producers of Wild About Wheels are launching a 24 hour all
automotive cable channel next year called ATN (automotive television
network) We would appreciate your ideas / input as to what you would
like to see on ATN and how we could make it perfect for you.  We'll
send you a free catalog of our home videos for your input.  Thanks in
advance.  Carl _at_ WAW
