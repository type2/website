Speaking of removing my bus steering wheel and putting it in the oven
at 300 degrees for thirty minutes, umm,

How the !_at_#%$ do you guys get yer steering wheels off of yer busses?

There seems to be no place to put a jaw-type puller, and the thread-in
kinds all use much too big o' bolts... Before I start jury-rigging, how
have y'all(s) done it in the past?  Someone before me put the wheel on
rotated by 180 degrees, which is fine except for the part about driving
thirty miles down the road with an uncancelled blinker going %-( ...

I tried &quot;pull and tap&quot; to no avail.  Any ideas?

thanks,
carl
