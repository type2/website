OOOPS:   WARNING !!!!!    I FORGOT TO SAY ..........................

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  REMOVE THE MAIN COIL WIRE BEFORE YOU DO ANY OF THIS !!!!!!!!  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

(don't forget to put it back for fire-up)



&gt;Pull the plugs, spray in WD-40, and turn the motor over a couple of times BY 
&gt;HAND, easiest way is to put it in 3rd. gear, jack up a rear wheel and turn 
&gt;that. Don't force anything. If all is smooth, (take it off the jack!) turn 
&gt;it over with the starter, until the oil light goes out. Still smooth? Put in 
&gt;the plugs and try it. There will be lots of spare gas kicking around, smoke 
&gt;etc, but it should clear. Treat it gently &lt;3000RPM for a short jaunt, then 
&gt;change the oil and filter when you get back. I can't see you having any 
&gt;problems after 5 months, aside from noisy hydraulic lifters, which should 
&gt;clear with patience.   tim s.
