Subject: my new angle grinder

Well my puny electric drill was just not doing the job so
I got myself an angle grinder ($60 at Sears) and WOW is 
it quick.  I put a wire cup in it and wailed on some
rust.  Yowser that thing is fast, I guess 10,000 rpm is
a lot.

There was some surface rust under my bus, so I ground it all
off (my head was covered with a tasty mixture of old undercoating,
paint, and rust) and put some &quot;Extend&quot; on it.  Torsion bars,
kingpins, everywhere.  It's beautiful.  I'll paint in 2 days, then
undercoat. (Girlfriend came out and said &quot;How's the Golenizing
going?&quot; (a vintagvw.list joke for those lenti only folks).).

I'm now agonizing (or is that vanagonizing) about how to 
rustproof _inside_ my lower front nose panel, plus other 
places where the sheetmetal makes a &quot;box.&quot;  Using spray
on rust sealer liberally, and one of those little red tubes
you get when you buy WD-40 is all I can think of.  Any ideas?
I don't want to seal up my outside and have my poor bus
disintegrate from the inside out.
