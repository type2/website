Subject: sand seals

looks like i am going to put one of these in to cure my oil mist 
problem.  turns out that the pully is rubbing against the case.  i am 
going to put in the type that does not need any disasembly of the case.  
has anybody used one of these.  any tips or hints.  i plan to have the 
stock pully machined down so the engine looks stock.
thanks and God BLess
matt
