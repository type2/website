Subject: 2.0 FI restoration 

I have to laugh. I have zero money. I have some savings that will be taxed when
I'm 55 or older... but can't touch 'em now -- you have to have a sense of humor
about it all, cause otherwise it's not funny!!!

oh well -- I would rather be broke and have a vehicle that will not burst into
flames than have $600 on hand and have a vehicle that bursts into flames and
burns to the ground. With me and Flynn (1 year old son) inside...

tune up                    204
fuel line                  350 (hoses and injector o rings)
vacuum lines                48 (plenty of 'em on this engine)
fuel evaporative system     88
                           ---
                           690 (Jesus!)

gimme that old Type I engine... special thanks to the local garage that put a
low pressure (5 lb PSI) fuel line on the FI system (30-45 lb PSI)...
