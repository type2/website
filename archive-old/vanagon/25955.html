&gt;Now I
&gt;have not talked to him and he's moving but I can get in touch with him
&gt;in about a week, the guy has all the paper work and all the information
&gt;he used in the fight and would love to share it, after I find out more,
&gt;I'll post, if anyone has specific questions they want me to ask him,
&gt;email me and I will.


DO IT!!!!
