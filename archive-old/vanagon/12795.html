        Reply to:   RE&gt;&gt;Fridge Question

Its probably easier to change over to a 12v system than to try to have a 12v
fridge running on a 6v system.   Seems like all you have to do is change the
alternator and voltage regulator.   The lights will also have to be changed
from 6v to 12v.    I'm surprised anyone sells 6v batteries and headlamps
anymore.    

But to answer the original question, what happens if you use 6 volts on a 12
volts fridge,  no damage will occur, but the fridge will not work very well
since with half the volts, the input power  is only one-fourth .     I have a
'78 Westfalia with a fridge that  draws about 10 amps at 12 volts, enough to
keep things cool for about 6-8 hours after the engine is shut off.   The
factory-installed fridge runs on a separate battery which can be charged by
the alternator or but an external 120 vac outlet.
