Subject: Westy Rental Seattle area

     Anyone know of a place to rent a Vanagon Westy  in the PS area
     for a few days to tryout on a short local trip.

     Seriously thinking of buying one, but must check-out
     eating, sleeping facilities before proceeding with a purchase.
  
     Please Email reply to:

          Thanks,
