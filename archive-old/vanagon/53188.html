Subject: LA Vanagon Westy's for rent?

My brother-in-law and his wife are planning a trip to the desert.  They
plan on flying into Los Angeles and are wondering if there are any places
that rent Westfalias or Eurovan campers the the L.A. area.  Can anybody
give me a heads up on this.

Thanks,

Fred
