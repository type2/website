Jim,

Allow me to direct your attention to the Thrust Flange on the #1 main bearing
of the Volkswagen engine.  Mounting a 'huge' propellor (most are less than
60&quot; in diameter) on the clutch-end of a Volkswagen engine imposes less of a
load than does actuating the clutch.

Light-aircraft engines based on Volkswagen components have been in use around
the world for more than 40 years and number several Atlantic crossings to
their credit.  

Properly assembled, light-plane engines using Volkswagen components have
proven dependable, reliable and low in cost.  Why don't we wait for the NTSB
report rather than condem the powerplant on the basis of a newspaper
clipping.
