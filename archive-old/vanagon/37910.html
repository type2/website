You don't.  Get some gauges.  Start with oil pressure.  Don't drive your
bus hard if the pressure drops below 25 psi under load.  It's probably
overheated at that point (or has some other problem like worn bearings).
Next get an oil temperature gauge.  Don't drive your bus hard if the
temperature goes over 230 degrees F.  Don't trust the reading if your
engine isn't turning over very fast (like under 3500 RPM).  It may be
artificially low depending on where you mount your sender.  Next get a
cylinder head temperature gauge.  Preferably two - one for each head.
Don't get the kind that mounts at the spark plug if you have a 72-83 air
cooled bus - it won't fit.  Be concerned if the temp reaches 350 degrees
F.  You will notice the temp stays down when the engine is turning fast
(like above 3500 rpm).  Rules of thumb:

DON'T LUG THE ENGINE UNDER LOAD - take hills in lower gears at high RPM
DON'T FLOOR IT - except for brief periods.  Use 3/4 throttle and downshift.
LISTEN FOR PINGING - if you hear ANY at all ease up NOW or your heads
	will eat themslves alive.  Take measures to correct the pinging 
	asap (like higher octane gas, retard timing, lower compression).
BUY AND INSTALL GAUGES - It's one of those things where you can spend a
	little now, or a lot later.

One more tip (I think this one is from the idiot book) - If you think your
engine may be overheating and you don't have any gauges, stop and feel
the dipstick.  If you can hold onto it for a few seconds without burning
your hand, you're probably okay.  If you burn your hand, your engine is
running way too hot.
