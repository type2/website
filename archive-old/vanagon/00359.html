Subject:  Non-interchangeable cigarette lighters
          Part Identifier:  9062

Two different cigarette lighters are used in Volkswagen vehicles and
they are NOT interchangeable.  If installed in the wrong vehicle, it
is possible that the lighter will not release properly, thus causing
a possible safety hazard.

Joel's note:
  so all this tells us is that we can get cigarette lighters from other
  cars, but be careful which ones you get. :)
  on the subject of getting the lighter OUT of the dash, i have been
  unsuccessful at doing this ... without destroying the plastic thingie
  around the lighter socket.
