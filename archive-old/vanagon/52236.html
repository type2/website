I recently bought some paint (semi-gloss black though) to repaint the 
trim stuff, handles etc.  I went to a GOOD paint store, one that 
caters to the pro's and asked.  They recommended a paint that is made 
specifically for the application I was gonna do.  It has a little 
extra acid in it to adhere to the aluminium better, so it won't peel.
Try a GOOD paint shop for advice on paint, not your local FLAPS or 
general purpose hardware place.
