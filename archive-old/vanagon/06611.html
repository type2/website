Subject: heater vs fan
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 94 15:44:55 PST

On my third-hand 81 Vanagon, there are four climate controls that
slide from L-&gt;R (and vice versa).  There is also a fan switch (numbered
0-3).  With the lower two &quot;sliders&quot; all the way to the right, fresh air
circulation is turned off.  With the second-from-the-top slider all the
way to the right, heat is &quot;on.&quot;  The top slider divides heat between
the dash vents and/or the foot vents.  My question is this: is there
any way to get warm air to come out of the fresh air vents that are on
the right and left side of the dash?  When I turn the fan on (with
the above slider settings), cold air simply blasts out of these vents.
Are they cold-air-only?  Is something broken?  Am I doomed to wear my
Patagonia fleece jacket 'til March?  Will Mulder start sleeping again?
