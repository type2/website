&gt; I have what I hope is a quick little question.  I have a 009 dist on 
&gt; my otherwise stock 71 bus.  I hope I am right here:  there are two 
&gt; tubes coming out of the carb that I assume were for the stock dist.  
&gt; The PO 'plugged' these by putting a small section of rubber hose over 
&gt; each and then plugging the end of that hose with a screw.  In my 
&gt; never ending search to my idleing problems I was going to replace 
&gt; these and hope that it fixes what acts like an air leak.  Any ideas on
&gt; the best way to do this?  Thanks, Jim

	James,
	A screw could be a source of air-leaks, as air passes along the
threads. If both tubes are coming out of the same place, you could just
put one tube on the pair of them, linking them and connecting them to
nothing. (!) If the two tubes come from unrelated areas of the carb,
then a single tube clamped-off with a tie-wrap or twist of wire would
also be a neat solution.
	I've always prefered golf-tees for hose plugs, since their
tapering shape assures a good fit in flexible tubing. I've used a
lot of screws, pencils, and once a oscilloscope nose-cone (on a fuel
hose).

	Good luck!
	Bill
