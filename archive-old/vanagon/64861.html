Subject:      Re: Fresh air vent motor [&amp; PS hose]

&gt;PS:  Does anyone know where I can locate used; a small flexible hose that
&gt;connects from the power steering pump to the metal tube running to the
&gt;front of
&gt;a '90 Westy?  It's my current project. The dealer wants $250 for the part
&gt;alone
&gt;and already charged me $35 to 'fix' the problem by putting 2 hose clamps
&gt;around
&gt;the outer protective rubber sheath to 'stop' the leaking.  I hate giving him
&gt;business more than ever.

     Clark your return address is a bit odd, so I'm posting this to the
list too.

     Is that the hose with the pressure fitting at the pipe end?  If so I
have one that I pulled from a junkyard van.

     Let me know.
