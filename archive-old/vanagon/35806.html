Subject: re: '82 Westy Diesel - at home

     82 Vanagon diesel Westy    $2700
     Airfare to Orlando           120
     Tow to Autotrain             100
     Autotrain to Lorton          350
     Oil/Antifreeze/misc           20
     Parts at dealer today         71
     Oil cooler and seal          205
                                 -----
                        Total   $3566

     Assuming I don't need anything else too major, looks like a
     pretty good deal so far!
--------------------
I'd say so! An '82 Westy Diesel was going for $9995 in my area last 
week - sold by the time I called... aarrghh.

This Westy hunting is starting to drive my nuts - I pass between 
10-15 *every* day going to work, but can't seem to find one for sale 
at a decent price or in decent shape. One guy was asking $7200 for an 
'81 which had serious rust, and looked like it'd been painted with a 
roller.

Sigh.

(Whine mode off.)

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
