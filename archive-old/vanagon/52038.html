RE:	Copy of: Re: Mexican buses

&gt; Most interesting was a model of VW I had heard about but never
&gt;seen.  It was a rear engined air-cooled VW with a nose that looked like a
&gt;411/412 as a rear that didn't look like anything VW.  Has louvers on the side
&gt;like a squareback.fastback.  Most examples were pretty ragged, so I would
&gt;guess these were the same vintage as the 411/412.

HI,  I think those neat little VW sportscars that you saw that looked like a
cross between a 411 and a early datsun 280Z were called VW SP2's and they were
made in Brazil. they have a type 3 engine configuration. Also, don't they call
the Golfs &quot;Caribe&quot; down there?  When I was in Cancun I seem to remember that. (
I also rented a beetle while down there - a white '88 bug)

I'd love to have one of those SP2's but Uncle Sam's (no, not Unca Joel's)
bureaucratic red tape won't allow it. :&lt;(
