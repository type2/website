Subject: Heat Exchanger

I am purchasing a '86 Westfalia Syncro.  The only way to heat the interior is
to run the engine or plug-in and use an electric model.

My brother has a '83 Westfalia with a heat exchanger.  He says it runs off of
the gasoline.  He can use it with or without the engine running.

Anybody install one of the exchangers or have any other ideas for staying
warm.

                                                          - Craig
