&gt;[74 type 1 in a 78 bus]
&gt;	When comparing other busses with a type III or IV think about
&gt;the dual carbs, fuel injection and such... If you want something very easy
&gt;to maintain, adjust and repair it doesn't get much simpler than a beetle
&gt;engine and parts are usually easy to find. 
&gt;	CHUCK

My '73 bus has a stock 1600 type1 motor. It seems these weren't sold in the 
States because they were considered too slow. I was offered a free 2000 cc 
typeIV engine by a neighbour (needed a rebuild) but the price of parts, 
about two or three times that for equivalent type1 parts, made me stick with 
the 1600. It is painfully slow, but it's tough and reliable and easy to fix, 
and I'm not in a hurry to get anywhere anyway. It's done 150,000 miles so 
far, been all over Europe, and even went pretty well with only 2 complete 
exhaust valves left. I did notice a slight drop in power :-) but it got me 
the 100 miles back home.
