&gt; Hi,Tim--
&gt; The highest mileage Vanagon in our fleet is an '85 (auto transmission, if 
&gt; that's relavant) with 107,ooo miles. It needs the head work done now, and 
&gt; actually needed in a few thousand miles ago. Sorry this isn't too specific.

	84 Westfalia - AT - 148,000 no/little oil consumption - no
	major engine work...runs well. don't know about compresison tho...
