&gt;    '63 Notchback

	Drool.  &lt;slobber&gt; &lt;slobber&gt;

&gt; It was white in color, and looked very clean and straight from where

	&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt;

&gt; it was a standard or automatic etc. (Did any of these even come with
&gt; automatics? It's probably a standard, I would guess).

	Yup, but not in '63.  The Type III offered VW's first genuine
automatic transmission in the '68 model year, along with the first
massed-produced electronic fuel injection (Bosch D-Jetronic).  Also,
for those who don't know, notches were never officially imported into
the U.S., so they're not so easy to come by in these parts.  In fact,
Type IIIs didn't get their official intro here until '66.
