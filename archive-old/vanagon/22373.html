Subject: ThrottleCbl Pricing Correction

UPDATE *8/9/95*

Yesterday I flamed on the VW dealer part pricing for a throttle cable for my
'83 Westy Vanagon 2.0 aircooled. Mfg date 9/82 WV2ZA0256DH014314.

FLAPS #4 Karl's Custom VW (Mesa, AZ) Clarified that there is a difference
between the 251-721-555 (plain) 251-721-555C (Charlie) and the 251-721-555Q
(Quebec/Queen) application. Specifying the correct part number for this item
depends on the manufacturing date! My bus was manufactured 9/82. I called
the dealerships to verify the correct part number and associated dealer
price. The price from Chapman Autoplex for the 251-721-555 (plain) was
$12.95. The attitude was the same (Bite me). The attitude at Berge was
professional.

Updated pricing range Phx,AZ 8/9/95:

251-721-555 (plain)         up to end of 2.0 Aircooled production $5.95 &gt; $12.92
251-721-555C (Charlie)      Diesel motor /DH $48.55 &gt; $52.43
251-721-555Q (Quebec/Queen) Waterboxer 3610mm length (1983 and up) $38.88

Lesson: Be certian that you have the correct date of manufacture for your
vehicle when &quot;specifying&quot; parts. As always shop around. Realize that not
everyone will be a candidate for the &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; contest but most
folks will attempt to be professional and helpful.
