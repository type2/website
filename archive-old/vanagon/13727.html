Subject: VW- ATK/VEGE Engine experiences

  &quot;Dan Houg&quot; &lt;fairwind_at_northernnet_dot_com&gt; asks:

  I've not seen this rebuilder talked about.....  I just called
  (800.421.3746) ATK/VEGE in Santa Ana, CA..... anybody have experiences
  with them?

I bought an ATK dual port 1600 air cooled long block for my '71 Bus in
April of 1990.  I got it through a parts shop (Jerry's VW-Heaven in West
L.A.; AKA The World's Most Rude and Ignorant Retail Outlet) but the ATK 12
month/12k miles warranty still applied.  Other than the fact that the
distributor rotor connector (the real name escapes me) was rotated 180
degrees wrong, I've gotten about 100k trouble-free miles out of it since
then.  The only problems that may be associated with the engine (and not
with auxillary items such as carbs, coils, fuel pumps, etc.) is a nagging
and fairly significant oil leak that has for years escaped diagnosis.  It
isn't the cooler, valve covers, strainer, or anything else obvious but
since it hasn't affected the running of the machine in any way I can
determine, I just load in another 1/3 quart at fill-up.  If it isn't due
to something I put on such as a oil filler tube, then it probably is a
cracked block but again, I can live with it.

The only disconcerting thing about the ATK warranty is that it clearly
states that you have to have the heads re-torqued after X miles.  When I
called ATK to ask about the details of the re-torque and after I spent the
hour or so on hold listening to some sort of irritating message, the tech
support person said not to bother tightening them down.  Good advice
perhaps but I always wondered what they would say if a serious problem did
indeed develop and I hadn't torqued them (I never did).

Bottom line is that for five years and 100k miles, it has worked out
pretty good and I would feel confident about going back to them again.  If
I had a machine that deserved it (I don't), I would now spend the extra
few dollars and get the upgrade to a 1700 or 1800cc engine.  Spread over
five years, the additional $300 doesn't sound so bad.
