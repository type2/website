Hey all,
Here in Fredericksburg VA, there is a 1985 Vanagon Westfalia for sale.
This thing is really really clean.  The owner is an old guy who just
road-tripped to Alaska and back.  He mentioned that the bus will only be
sold to a special kind of person (that's us!).

Here's what it's got.

All the camping goodies, stove, fridge, sink, cabinets galore.
The pop top has a skylight in it.  The canvas is in excellent condition
as are both beds.  The inside of the van looks like brand new.  The van
has 157K miles but the engine has been rebuilt locally and has only 20K
miles on it.  It has a new starter, new muffler, new battery, new
driveshaft on one side (I think), etc.

I asked him about leaky head gaskets and he said he never had any
problem with 'em and now he's got a rebuilt engine anyway.  

There is minor rust on the nose where rocks have hit the nose and
damaged the paint, allowing rust to form.  So lots of little spots up
front.  

There is a little rust on the right rear fender where it looks like
someone scraped up against the van but again, it's really minor.  

It has an automatic transmission.

Didn't get a chance to drive it or look at the engine, etc. because the
van is at the guy's work and he was on the clock.  

If anyone's interested let me know and I'll give you the phone number.

Oh, he's asking $5800, I think.

Usual disclaimers apply, I just want to see this NICE van go to a good
home.

Sean
