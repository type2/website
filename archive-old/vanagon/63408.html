re:  Programable Relay.

I went out and got the programable relay I bought a couple of years ago
(357-955-531), and actually installed it in the SyncroBeast.  Wow, it works.
Press down to activate, pull up immediately, press down again at the interval
you wish to have wiper operate.  I guess it's time to do more than: buy, place
in glove box, let time pass.

per my friendly local VW parts gnomes:
Part Number - 357-955-531
superceeded - 1HM-955-531C variable interval
Cost from VW - $35
Cost from somewhere else - $don't know, not had opertunity to ask.

fixed interval - 1HM-955-531  Don't want this one, it's fixed, original.

Don't forget to ask for you 15% VW club discount.

I haven't actually tried the iHM superceeded unit, but I do trust the gnomes
at West Side.  Is the original thread person who mentioned that he thought the
531C was fixed sure of that????  (Keep in mine the operating instructions
above.)

p.s.   Just saw the Pikes Peak race on ESPN2.  Is that awsome or what.  Dig
that Kenworth kickin ass up the hill.  If VW makes a 4wd, maybe they ought to
see if they can steal Rod Millen from Toyota??? huh, huh, hmmm????  Can't you
just see some kick butt powered Syncro truckin up the hill?  I've done some
dirt road rallying in mine, and with a little practice you can get the unit to
do a decent 4 wheel drift.  Of course, my navigator was a little nervous, but
he usually is when I get goin full tilt boogie.
