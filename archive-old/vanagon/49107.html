&gt; &lt;Scott asked where Elizabeth Furnace was&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Eliabeth Furnace is a National Forest Service Campground wihtin the
George
&gt; Washington National Forest.  It is basically at I-66 &amp; I-81 near Front
&gt; Royal.  It is roughly a 1-1.5hr drive from DC.
&gt; 
&gt; I am assembling a list of alternate suggestions and supporting
&gt; votes as they appear on the list.  If you want either to make and
&gt; alternate suggestion or support one of the previously mentioned alternate
&gt; sites (so far Pine Barrens, NJ; Assetegue, VA; and Seneca Rocks, WV),
&gt; please let me know.
