RE:	Copy of: Bench seats for the front

They're VERY hard to find, if you can find them used. Most U.S. import Vanagons
were 7 passenger models. 

The Vanagons or &quot;Transporters&quot; (kombi's) as they are called over there that you
saw were &quot;neunsitzer Transporters&quot; or nine passenger Vans. I don't think the
Caravelle was offered as a 9 pass. since they usually were more of the upscale
models, but then again I could be wrong (it can happen :&lt;) In addition to the
split front bench seat (the drivers seat is still seperate) they are
&quot;non-walkthru's&quot; meaning there is a metal bulkhead half wall divider between the
cab, and the cargo area. If you want to get into the back of the van and
reprimand the kids without getting out, you have to scramble over the wall.
(kids love it, saves 'em from whoopin's! )  This was more of a popular feature
in the '50's and '60's buses.  I have an '83.5 nine passenger sunroof model
myself. Kind of a rare model for a U.S. imported waterboxer vanagon. The middle
seat in the 9 passenger was a full length bench, with fold down edge closest to
the sliding door for access to the back seat. 

Believe it or not, there was also a 12 pass. model called the &quot;12 seat minibus&quot;
and bore the &quot;BUS&quot; logo on the rear hatch. So, yes, VW did oficially call the
Vanagon a &quot;BUS&quot; in some countries.(Britian &amp; South Africa and some others) The
12 pass. was exempt from the &quot;car tax&quot; in Britian, the country from which I have
the dealer brochure that shows this model. 

Anybody out there have a 12 pass. Vanagon?
