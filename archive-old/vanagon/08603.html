&gt;   I found some info in a Chilton's manual last night. Valve sizes in 1.7 and
&gt;   1.8 liter engines appear to match between bus and U.S. spec 914. The 2.0
&gt;   liter engine for the 914/4 and the 912E are different than the bus 2.0. It's
&gt;   not that simple though. Valve clearances for the 1.7 and 1.8 liter 914 are
&gt;   .006&quot; for both valves, implying solid valves (Sodium cooled valves are set
&gt;   at 008&quot; clearance, right?). The 2.0 liter 914 and 912E have clearance specs.
&gt;   of .006&quot; intake and .008&quot; exhaust, implying sodium cooled valves. The 2.0
&gt;   bus engine spec. is for .006&quot; for both intake and exhaust. So there you have
&gt;   it, more confusion than ever.

I think you may have it backwards.  I always thought that the solid exhaust
valves were gapped to .08 because they ran hotter, had greater thermal
expansion, and were therefore more likely to tighten up and harm the
engine.  Since the sodium filled valves run much cooler (probably not as
cool as the intakes, but cooler) they could safely be gapped at the optimal
.06 like the intakes.  I have always gapped all exhaust valves at .08
though, just to be safe.

&gt;   The Porsche parts catalog that I have (Performance something of other) has
&gt;   sodium cooled valve in the 1.8 liter diameter only for $49.50 each.

My friend has the two-liter.  :)
