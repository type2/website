Subject:       Re: Rolling Stone VWUS/Jerry Garcia Ad

&gt;While at the Lawrence, MA VW show Sunday, I overheard a conversation
&gt;regarding an ad in the next issue of the Rolling Stone from VW US.

&gt;Aparently its a line drawing of the front of a Splittie with a tear
&gt;rolling out of one side windshield and underneath &quot;Jerry Garcia 1942-1995&quot;.
&gt;I just went down to the bookstore on campus, and its not in the 9/7 issue
&gt;of RS....so it will probably be in the next issue.

&gt;Ric

Sounds like the same one on Shakedown Street at the VWUS web site.
