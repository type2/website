Subject: Re: Emissions again.

My 84 has the exact same problem  It is in the shop today so they can 
try to identify the problem.  I will let you know what they did and 
what the outcome was.

Here is the initial failure report;

AirCare Inspection Report
1984 VW Westfalia, 205,000 kms.

HC_at_load (ppm) :  Actual:  115  Permitted: 300
HC_at_idle (ppm) :  Actual:  367  Permitted: 350  FAIL

CO_at_load (%) Actual 0.91  Permitted 2.00
CO_at_idle (%) Actual 0.42  Permitted 4.00

NOx_at_load (ppm)  Actual 1450  Permitted 2667

&gt; The original purpose of starting this list was because I wanted some
&gt; information on how to get my '84 Vanagon to pass emissions testing in MN. 
&gt; I just got back from the testing station, and it failed again (after
&gt; having passed last year).   The measurement that fails is HC. CO is just 
&gt; fine and CO2 is passable. I think that I can probably get it to pass by 
&gt; setting the idle higher and adjusting the timing.  Any other quickies I 
&gt; should try ?  
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well.....
