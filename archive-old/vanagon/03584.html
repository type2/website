&gt;
&gt;Since we're on the subject of breaking into VWs and such, a few years back,
&gt;after my very *last* final (or so I thought, at the time), my brain was toast
&gt;and my mind was gone, but a couple of my housemates and I felt devious enough
&gt;to break into some woman jogger's Type III (same way as the busses, through the
&gt;wing window) that she wantonly parked in our parking spaces.  Seems she'd drive
&gt;up, park, go for a jog around the greenbelt, jump back in her car and drive
&gt;off.  
&gt;Well, some of us were getting a little steamed about the parking space thing,
&gt;so one day we break in, pin up a Playboy centerfold (I don't recall the
&gt;month/yr) smack dab in the center of her dash, and then lock the car back up
&gt;and wait.  Well, she gets back, unlocks the car, gets in and notices 
&gt;the fine calling card we left behind.  Long pause, takes it off the dash, looks
&gt;around nervously, then drives off, never to be seen again.

You couldn't just leave a note on the windshield? I know you'd just
finished exams and your mind was toast, but why terrorize this woman?
