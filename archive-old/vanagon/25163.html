&gt;&gt;different crankcase breather box (no big deal, except that it might tip
&gt;&gt;off the smog weenies that this was not a stock 1.7 engine) I decided at
&gt;&gt;that point that I was going to have to transfer the internals of this
&gt;&gt;engine to a 1.7 case that came with Jeff's engineless Westy.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm.  Are *all* the smoggers this alert?

No. not all are. I took my '71 bus with the stock '70 single port engine
to a place on Miramar Rd. here in north San Diego. The fellow there,
examined it, and had no objection, tho technically he should have--
CA smog laws require that you have the same year, or newer, smog equipment
on your engine, as the chassis year of your car. The single-port heads,
single-port manifold, and especially the Solex 30PICT-3 carb, were a
year older than what this bus required, so were technically illegal in CA.

However, I think he was just happy to see a single solex, the vacuum
diaphragm on the Bosch distributor, and the original air cleaner and stock
bus muffler instead of dual Dellortos and an F-15 engine or whatever. And
since its emissions were much lower than the 1971 requirements, he passed
it!

It's a crapshoot trying to find a smog checker who is a little more relaxed
than standard... Rumor has it, that there are some places south of here,
near the border, who will smog a hibachi grill for the right amount of
&quot;respect and deference&quot;. Haven't actually tried any of them, but the time
may come...

I wonder if thrust reversers are street legal in CA.
