Subject: VOLTAGE STABILIZER


DOES ANYONE KNOW if the voltage stabilizer is supposed to be insulated   
from the back of the instrument cluster.  Everytime I try to fix my gas   
gauge on my 74 westie it seems to die when I bolt the stabilizer to the   
back of the gauges.  Please help I hate to run out of gas.  Erick
