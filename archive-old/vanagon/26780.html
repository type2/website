&gt;well, everybody else is telling their lies about hauling around the
&gt;Statue of Liberty or the National Debt in their buses!!! so i just figure
&gt;i'll throw my lies out on the table. :)


No lie here! Maybe just a little exaggeration, tho: The Statue of Liberty
actually couldn't fit inside, entirely. I supported the torch with a
little trailer behind my '69 in Colorado.
