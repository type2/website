At the risk of shooting my mouth off before I have all the facts in
hand, I thought the recall was for the duct work that sits roughly over
the middle seats, not specifically for the evaporator bit in the rear.
I suppose, though, that one could make a case that if supports on one
side of a plastic assemblage break and are covered, then why not
supports at the other end?

The recall notice was posted by Joel eons ago and should be in the
archives.  Somewhere.
