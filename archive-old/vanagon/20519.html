Hi all!

Took a trip out to my sister's in Cedar Rapids, Iowa last week.  Came back
on Saturday (via I-80 across Illinois and Indiana), and did a lot of
rubbernecking to look at the large number of busses on the road, as there
were impending Dead shows in Chicago last weekend.  Nothing too critically
cool, just your usual selection of Deadhead busses, a few with, er, unique
paint jobs.

Now, I only saw one broken down Volks, a 68-71 bus, and it looked like the
guy had things under control, so I didn't stop.  BUT!  Number of broken
down Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth minipukes, you ask?  THREE!  I leave it to you
(or Ric) to form conclusions.

Discuss.

;-)

Bill
