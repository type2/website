&gt;&gt;The NEATO list had a lot, but not all.  Anyone know how they
&gt;&gt;got the ones they did and if there are more?  I'd be willing
&gt;&gt;to coordinate Mcode listing efforts and put them on a web
&gt;&gt;page.

&gt;I think someone looked through old dealer books.  I
&gt;misplaced my NEATO newsletter, but someone could write the
&gt;author and ask where the info came from.

Mark's offer to coordinate web page efforts is magnanimous.
clara can be forgiven misplacing her Old Bus Review, she
*has* had more to think about (glad you're not hurt
seriously).  One of the contributors to the NEATO
compilation is subscribed to the VANAGON list, maybe he'll
respond to the cry.  Before the NEATO list of M-Codes, my
source was the VW Parts List for the Type 2 and it, too,
only had some of the codes, not all of them.

I am aware of a few codes *not* listed in OBR.  If anyone
out there can fill in the blanks, feel free:

'66 Deluxe
M425?

'67 Double Cab
M429?

'67 Westfalia
MC42?
(I know that M108 is the SO 42 camper option)
