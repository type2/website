Subject: Grey Cabinet Edging--Westfalia Trim

I've studied that microfiche countless times and never before did I notice
this edging in there. 

But I looked where you said and indeed it was there. Wow. 

The part number is 255 070 925 A.

Why not try to order this mail order from PARR VW or Paul Walser VW in the
Southwest?

I see that as of a couple of years ago this edging cost the dealer $6.30 and
he was suggested to sell it for $10.50 so perhaps another dealer will quote
you a smaller price.

&gt;Derek,
&gt;
&gt;You wrote;
&gt;&gt;Do you have a *part number*?  Also, is this part number for the edging that
&gt;&gt;goes around the stove top wooden lid or edging next to the cabinet. I
&gt;&gt;believe some of this edging is for a corner while other edging is for the
&gt;&gt;flat, like around the tables.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, I didn't get a part number from the dealer.  This edging
&gt;is pictured on the microfiche where the rear vanity cabinet is
&gt;shown.  I remember an item number of 16 in the illustration if
&gt;this helps.  I also remember looking at the illustrations that show
&gt;the tables, but they didn't show or list a separate edging for
&gt;use on the table.  You can not obtain any of the cabinet door
&gt;edging from the dealer if that's what you mean by edging for a
&gt;corner.  --------------- Hope this helps.
&gt;
&gt;BTW - We're still working on the two person bench seats.  MediVan
&gt;needs to move some things to gain access to the storage area where
&gt;all the seats are but can't find the time to do it even we me offering
&gt;to help.  I'll keep you posted.
&gt;
&gt;Kevin
