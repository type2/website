So Kreyche, Tom says:
&gt; a low of about $2200 bad condition to $7000 with lowish miles. '90s are going 
&gt; for a lot more $$, $12k common to see.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's some example ads:
&gt; 
&gt; '86, synchro, 130k mi, $4.5k  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This one!

This is your best bet right here.  Check it out and if 
there is no rust, steal it!

Even with the high miles, I think this is the best of the
bunch.  The syncros will always have a higher resale value.
Best for the back-country.  I still wish I had gotten one.
