Subject: Have Westy Sink Pumps
Date: Wed, 28 May 1997 22:49:33 -0400

Someone had asked a question a week or two ago about where to get
submersable sink pumps for Vanagon Westfalia campers (for less than the
dealer's price).  I am now carrying German pumps for $24.95 each. Got my
first few the other day, put one in my '89 five minutes later (just in time
for our first camping trip in our &quot;new&quot; Westy!), and it works just great! 
Also have non-submersable pumps coming for '74-79 campers.
