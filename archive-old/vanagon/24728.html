Subject:       '66 Parts Fest., '57 Name!

Well, the venture into my '66 Kombi was short lived.

I got it towed and looked underneath (This is the one I got for 
$150).  Anyhow, the frame was too far gone to consider keeping it.  
So the last couple of days I've been stripping it, and cutting it up.

If anyone is interested in certain parts mail me.  I'm looking for 
some stuff for the '57 and would gladly arrange a trade, or whatnot.

BTW,  Happy birthday to me!

The '57 Update:

I have now christened the bus, &quot;The Pioneer.&quot;  The name seems to fit 
it as it resembles a covered wagon, is about as noisy, and goes 
almost as fast as one.  Also living in Utah seems to fit it as well.  
Maybe Joel will put together a list of bus names!

The tranny nose mount is split as I found out after being led to it 
by list members.  For now, a bolt will hold it together until this 
winter when I drop the engine, do the main rear seal, and replace all 
of the tranny mounts.

I fiddled with the timing.  Probably not too wise to do w/o strobe, 
but at least the bus starts now.  Will take it to buddy to have him 
time it properly.

_Another_ bolt fell out of the right swing-arm.  Can't keep the 
things in there.  Probably all that grease in there.  Must get some 
carb cleaner and loc-tite and get that unit to stay in!

That's all from this end!
