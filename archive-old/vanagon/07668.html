Subject: Re: Replacement Pop-top Canvas: Whose is best?

I called West Coast Metric, and asked what their tent material was.
They don't know what the material is, but said it had been &quot;treated&quot;
and should be waterproof.  For extra protection, they said I could
coat it with Scotchguard.

I don't think they really know too much about their own product.
