So thom fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt;         Diagnosis?  I think the rear return springs are too weak to push
&gt; the brake fluid back, letting them drag.  I'm gonna try and find new springs
&gt; tomorrow - wish me luck!

I certainly hope it works.  Changing the brake pads every 2K miles just
isn't practical. ;)  

BTW, maybe you should think about rigging that middle brake light as 
an emergency flasher (picturing Marty opening and closing his rain coat ;) ) 
so that when you need to make those emergency stops (like on those off/on
ramps) on-coming traffic can have some kind of warning.  You might also
want to get triangles or flares.

Cheers!
