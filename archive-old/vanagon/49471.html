Subject: EV Horsepower (was EV-Winnebago)


First off....VW vans have NEVER been overpowered....

The EV's 5 cyl engine (at least in our 5 speed/MV config) is plenty powerful 
enough...the engine is slightly altered from its Audi 5000 counterparts in 
that it has a high torque output and the torque band extends from about 2000 
rpm up to about 5000 rpm.

What other VW van do you know of that can pass other cars while going up 
hill at 70-80 mph with the AC on?
