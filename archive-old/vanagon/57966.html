&gt;  I'm upgrading my front seats to the newer armrest style and I've
&gt; noticed that when they are in the door doesn't close because of the
&gt; door's arm rest. On the vans that these seats were intended for, did VW
&gt; just leave off the door's arm rest, or was there a narrower/different
&gt; one that I'll have to track down?
Are they adjustable armrests, or fixed type? (not sure if this makes 
a difference). My '88 has adjustable armrests, and still has the door 
arm rests.
