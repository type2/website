Subject: Re: Fording Depth

Thom,

Maximum fording depth for all Volkswagens without shaft seals is the height
of the crankshaft.  Even with the belt removed to cut down on sprayed water
in the engine compartment, once the water level reaches the crankshft it will
be drawn in thorugh the crankcase inlet vent, which is the annular space
around the pulley hub.  It takes only a small amount of water in your oil to
destroy the engine.

But if you have a shaft seal ( okay, call it a 'sand seal' ), and if the fan
belt is disconnected, in theory you can motor thru water as deep as the
distributor, most of which have a vent on the bottom.  And if you have a
sealed distributor, as deep as the carb.  Of course, by this time you'll need
navigation lights and a hull registration number.

Your tranny is also vented to the atmosphere.  The vent is located on the
nose cone, just above the gear selector rod.  It doesn't pump the water in as
does the engine vent but if you submerge the nose cone you can expect to get
water in the tranny.

Outboard gearboxes on early buses are vented via the tranny.  You may splash
all you want.  Of course, tadpoles in your brake drums cause your braking
distance to increase by an amazing amount.

A good rule is to never try fording when the water is deeper than the bottom
of your bumper, and only then if you know what you're doing.  The major
problem with fording is that when people see things are going okay, they tend
to speed up.  Bad idea.  The tin around your pulley has a forward-facing
drain.  Speed up and it acts like a scoop, squirting water directly onto your
fan pulley... and into your engine's vent.  Walking pace or less, you'll
seldom have a problem.  Permanent fords, such you find in Baja, develop a
nice coating of moss during the raining season.  The moss is slicker than
ice.  If you get your wheels out of the tracks you'll find yourself going
sideways.

Down in Baja you can count the bridges on one hand and have a couple of
fingers left over.  On the highway, all of the fords are paved and even on
unpaved roads the fords are generally well engineered.  But American tourists
being what they are, each ford usually comes equipped with a local resident
who makes his living pulling people out.  Best bet?  Wait it out.  The water
will usually go down.  Or up.  Funny thing, water. (Up in Seattle the stuff
comes out of the sky!)
