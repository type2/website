&gt; &gt;During our talk, he mentioned someone stopping by with =
&gt; &gt;greenbacks in hand and offering $1k more than I did. So he said he'd =
&gt; &gt;keep our deal as long as I came up with cash in 48 hrs....
&gt; 
&gt; Boy, I'd stay in contact with this guy while I continued to try to 
&gt; move the EV- that sounds like a  typical &quot;hurry-up-the-sale&quot; line, not 
&gt; necessarily to be believed. If he really had an offer 10% higher, why 
&gt; wouldn't he take the best offer? Makes no sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, going through this exercise at least you know where your heart 
&gt; lies ;-)!  Syncro Westies forever!

It does not sound like a deal yet. Did he get a deposit from the new offer?
 If not, its still for sale.  I agree with Tom, STAY WITH IT!!

Good Luck,
