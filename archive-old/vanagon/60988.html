Here's a couple of things I've noticed.   If you want to start the critter
on gas you'll have to consider the thoughts going on with the flame sensor
that tells the propane valve not to shut off.  

If you pre-heat the system by running on DC for a little bit you may find
that the lighting goes a bit easier as the flame sensor gets a little 
advantage on his eternal question &quot;How hot is it?&quot;.  Try it, it might work
for you like it does for me.
