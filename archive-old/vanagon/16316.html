Subject: RE: Squeaking from front end (spare tire?) of Vanagon

I'll try driving without the spare tire, but I'm pretty sure MY front end
squeak is a suspension bushing.  I haven't gotten up the nerve (nor time)
to go in after it:  The last time I pulled the suspension apart at all,
I just barely got it back together with two jacks.  Give me an engine 
problem any time -- at least the car still rolls.

By the time I'm in third gear I can't hear the squeak anyway, so it's down
on the second or third page of Vanagon projects pending.
