Subject:      Thermo System Inc. Phone Number Update

Folks,

Just wanted to let you know that the area code for the number for Thermo
Systems Inc., that's posted in the VW FAQ, has been changed.  The new
number is:

360/352-0539

The company sells the only vented catalytic heaters which can be installed
in motor homes/Vans.   fyi -- current price is $339.95 if purchased
directly from the company.  It includes the heater, a thermostat, exhaust
and intake vents.
