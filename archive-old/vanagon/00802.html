Subject: my bus vs. the mountains
Date: Sun, 8 May 1994 13:17:56 -0500 (CDT)

I posted this message to the vw newsgroup, and I thought I'd try it 
here too, by suggestion of one of the subscribers....

I was planning a trip to the west (from lincoln, nebraska) for 
the beginning of june in my campervan, and was trying to decide the 
best route through the mountains.  What I've been told on here 
and elsewhere has scared me and Glenda (my bus) to death.  I was hoping
to go through south dakota, wyoming (yellowstone) to get out there.  
Any comments? 

Also, is there anything that I should do to prepare my bus for the 
trip other than oil, plugs, points, etc?  Does the thin air really 
affect my little engine?  

I've never taken a vw through the mountains, so any help would be 
appreciated.
