Subject: FS: 87 Vanagon GL

I really hate to do it but we almost have too many cars and something
has to go. Looking for a good home for Vanna:

87 Vanagon GL, 154K miles
Never wrecked, 2 Owner
Seven passenger, with bench seat in middle
Engine rebuilt at 127K miles
AT rebuilt at 143K miles
Body in good shape, few minor dings, no big dents, only minor seam rust
Medium Blue Metalic (original, except respray on nose)
Blue Interior in good shape
Good tires (Goodyear 205R70)
Allow Wheels (5)
Class 1 hitch (to tow VW chassis to sandblaster)
AM/FM Cassette
AC (Works good!)
Asking $4999.99 OBO

Would consider trade for a NICE Thing (but then I still have too 
many cars). She won't win any drag races but makes a great daily
driver. I did win a plaque with her at a car show.

Contact me at rich_at_indy_dot_net or 317.867.1703 in the evening or 
317.277.2752 during the day. The car is located in (near) Indianapolis,
Indiana

Peace,
Rich Smith
