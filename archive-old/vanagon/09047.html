I hereby appoint Derek to engage my brain and determine the weightiness of
my messages. All messages shall forthwith be forwarded to said individual 
to determine their conceptual and factual clarity, their net contribution
and parsimony and rank ordered accordingly.

Generally speaking, there has been more than the usual verbiage on the
list as of late, but dammit its the holidays; besides the list is new,
give it time. Speaking for myself, I can't go on like this, there are exams to
mark, essays to read and lectures to give, but for now its great! Since we
stopped subscribing to the morning Globe and Mail, this is the way I wake
in the morn with a cup o' Java and Madeleine on my knee. Please don't take it
away :(

PS there must be a mistake somewhere- there is no way I rank number 3. All
of my messages are short, precise and to the point and are posted only
once  a week ;)
