Subject: Re  Netscape Email (off-content go ahead flame me)

Well off content here but having just switched to Netscape for
everything including email I'm wondering (this with 3.01 Gold)
although you can have many storage folders, can you sort the
damn inbox messages by sender into different folders so I could say
send everything from Vanagon to one and Type2 to the other.  I've
been looking for an hour for a way and can't figure any better than
sorting the inbox by sender then copying en mass to another folder,
but there must be a better way.  I like the integration of Netscape
though, email, browser, newsreader, etc.  Oh and happy turkey day
all.  Anybody else handling multiple lists? better suggestions please
do tell.  Course I'm probably just missing something obvious and
intuitive that even a 10 year old would get but I can't.
