Subject: FOLLOWUP: Squeaky/Creaky Vanagon Suspension

Thanks to all who responded. I thought I might post a followup
to my creaking research:

I got several good suggestions about undercoating and wrapping
my spare tire in blankets, old rugs, westy manuals, mad magazines,
and the like... but....

as was suggested to me by several folks, I removed the spare tire and drove
around for a while - it still creaked loudly on the right side. I went
back to the mechanic and we determined that the sound was coming from the
control arm bushings and bolts. It will cost me $450 to have the mechanic
replace all of these items - so he suggested I decide if the squeaking
bothered me that much - or - try some silicon spray on the bushings.

Ive sprayed the hell out of the bushings with my van sitting normally,
is there any angle I can better acheive w/a jack or lift to get
silicon spray in deeper? The noise still persists.
