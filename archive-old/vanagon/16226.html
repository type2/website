    I'm in the habit of waving to all Splits, Busses, V'gons and EVs.
    
    Here in RI, there aren't many of any of these. I almost always get waves
    back from the busses and splits, 50% on the Vanagons and only once from an
    EV. 

I almost always wave.  Kids hate it.

As I recall, back in '63 when we had
a camper (&quot;Texas kit&quot;) that we always
waved then, too.  Wonder if the number
of busses on the road today approximates
1963?
