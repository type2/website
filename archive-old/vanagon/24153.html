&gt; &gt; 2. Small removable table in driver's cabin
&gt; 
&gt;     I volunteer to accept any tables you receive after the
&gt;     first one and before the third one...
&gt; 
Similarly I volunteer to accept any waste cans/stools for sale
or giveaway after you find one, particularly to go with a bright
yellow '77 or a cocoa brown '78.
