&gt; 
&gt; don't be too quick to condemn an AFM...  i've got several posts on
&gt; these in the archives but i'll relate a little to you now.
&gt; 
&gt; it is my experience that one *cannot* use an ohmmeter to check the
&gt; afm, despite what Bentley says.  there are surface mount capacitors
&gt; in there that charge and discharge as the wiper arm moves and the
&gt; resistance jumps all over the place.  even on a brand spanking new
&gt; one, which i did buy :(
&gt; 
&gt; use an oscilliscope or a fast acting DVM and measure the key-on
&gt; voltage on the wiped output.  look for voltage dropouts or non linear
&gt; response.  each afm that i have tested with resistance alone, has tested 'bad'!
&gt; 
&gt; also, it is very typical for the carbon track to be worn down so one
&gt; sees the fiberglass board.  one can squeeze down the wiper arm to
&gt; have it ride on a new area, but even this doesn't seem totally
&gt; essential.  what DOES make a difference, it cleaning the carbon track
&gt; with a clean pencil eraser and then running a heavy weight cotton bond
&gt; cardstock, eg a 'rough surfaced' business card, under the wiper and
&gt; burninshing the wiper contact.
&gt; 
&gt; let me know if you need clarification on anything.
&gt; 
&gt; -danAlso!
	you rub over the carbon track with the lead of a soft pencil (at 
least 2b) and this will restore the carbon on the track (for a while 
anyway)
