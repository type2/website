&gt; &gt;This event promises to be well-attended:  22 vehicles signed up
&gt; &gt;yesterday alone!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At any rate, the preferred date is definitely the weekend of March 21-24.
&gt; &gt;This is because of the various eclipse/comet viewing activities.  Please
&gt; &gt;note that this peaks on SUNDAY evening, so some of you may wish to
&gt; &gt;arrange now for taking Monday off if possible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We still don't have a specific location, but the marked trend is to
&gt; &gt;get away from electric lights and atmosphere conditions of any
&gt; &gt;nearby cities.  Several have suggested looking for some high
&gt; &gt;ridge in the dessert.  As we anyway want to be sort of midway
&gt; &gt;between LA and SF (maybe not in a straight line, but at least
&gt; &gt;equidistant from the two), many have suggested Panamint Springs
&gt; &gt;again.  I've asked Al Knoll to see if we might get space there
&gt; &gt;again this year.  This place is a an oasis in the middle
&gt; &gt;of nowhere, and hence has phenomenal view of the stars at
&gt; &gt;night, etc.  Death Valley is not too terriby far away.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Other suggestions have been for many good places like Anza Borrego,
&gt; &gt;or Joshua Tree, both of which I'm told will be vastly over-run at
&gt; &gt;this time, due to many planning to see the same celestial event
&gt; &gt;we are.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Comments?
&gt; 
&gt; I still suggest the Pinnacles.  It's a beautiful high desert ridge.  We'd
&gt; have to do some night hiking to get up to the ridge, but I expect that
&gt; would be the case anywhere.  The number for Pinnacles is 408.389.4485.
&gt; 
&gt; The campground is just outside the east side of the park and has showers
&gt; and group camping areas.  Their phone number is 408.389.4462.  They do take
&gt; reservations for groups.

I second that. Otherwise, it gets too far away for me. (I am in Eugene,
OR.)
