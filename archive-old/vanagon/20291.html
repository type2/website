Subject: Re: Help on Westy water level lights

So David Garth says:
&gt; Drat! The water tank level indicator lights stopped working today. None 
&gt; of the lights light, no matter what the water level.
&gt; 
&gt; The fridge &quot;pilot light lit&quot; light and battery voltage lights still work. 
&gt; 
&gt; The top sensor at the tank is getting about .6 volts, the two lower ones 
&gt; about .4 volts when the switch is on. 0 when switch is off.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know how this circuit works or have a wiring diagram for it?

Hi David,

Well, the 'big green' book has a diagram as well as a trouble shooting
guide.  If you'd like, I could fax it to ya.  

Let me know and I'll get it to you tomorrow.  Of course, knowing these
vanagon 'buzzards', one of em' probably has this stuff all typed out
and the diagram in ass-cii format.... ;)

Cheers!
