Ummm.. I wish that were true, but unfortunately Bishop (which I guess is near
Panamint Springs) is close to 500 miles from me.  The folks in the LA area
are well over 300 miles away.

&gt; 
&gt; I'll cast the first dissenting vote.  I'd like to traipse on over to Panamint Spgs,
&gt; I've seen both recently.  The travel options from Panamint Springs are better IMHO.

I still vote for Red Rock.  500 miles is a bit far for me.
