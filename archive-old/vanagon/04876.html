So J. Walker says:
&gt; &gt;	If I had kept mine, I had planned to port the right-most duct into the
&gt; &gt;	side vent nearby, seal off the fresh air intake in the grill and use
&gt; &gt;	the ventilation ducts to route cool air to the dash.

Yeah, I was thinkin' I could mooch a front vent system from a vanagon bus
and hook it up with a hose running somehow from the back and attaching
it to 2 or more vents.

&gt; 
&gt; the only problem i can see with this idea is the distinct possibility of
&gt; condensation on the metal ... rusting the roof out from the inside. if you
&gt; could manage to plastic-coat it somehow, or run some plastic tubing ...

Or maybe a really long condum?

&gt; 
&gt; in the pictures in the german books i've seen, there are buses with the
&gt; a/c vent running along the sides of the roof ... so they can have front face
&gt; air AND the sunroof (or camper). :(    why do they get all the good stuff? :(

Maybe it has something to do with that little spat we had with the Germans
back in the forties......   ;)
