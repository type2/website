Subject: Re: Replacing lock cylinders.


&gt;So how do you remove the darn thing? (Its a 70 bus, btw). I've accessed the
&gt;lock housing from underneath, removed a small set screw (as in Bentley), but
&gt;I'm afraid to start prying or pulling on the wrong thing. Anybody done this
&gt;one before? 

Yeah, I paid a locksmith $20 to show me how to do it.  Although it is
not mentioned in Bentley, the only thing the set screw is for is to
remove the electrical half of the ignition switch.  In order to take
the lock cylinder out you have to depress a retaining clip in a hole 
on the back top of the lock cylinder.  To do this you need a piece of 
wire small enough in diameter to go in the hole, yet stiff enough to
press the clip.

Here's a lame attempt at ASCI art:

      \         | RETAINING CLIP    /
       \     ___V__________________/
        \   |   o                 /
         \  |        CYLINDER    /
          \ |___________________/
           \                   /
            \                 /

Hope this helps.  Good luck.

Dave
