Related to the Dr. Death thing... Why VW Vans all the time?

In a private thread Micheal Heron and I have been mulling over the spousal
quote that is heard all too often, &quot;Over my dead body you will...&quot; I
wondered if any of these apparent suicides are actually the result of a
preterbed spouse after that one last junkyard run instead of the anniversary
dinner or the last minute dash out of the door to go look at another &quot;Once
in a lifetime deal ~ (of the week).&quot;  Our favorite is phone calls during
dinner trying locate and coordinate the elusive &quot;mud valve&quot; that is needed
to complete the '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell.&quot; 
Of course the '67 Westy SO-42 that was offered FS for $2500. was phoned in
at 8:30 PM on a Sunday night. I knew enough not to go look at it. Dr. Jack
would have been credited with my demise.
