Subject: Quarterly Tent Pole Request  :-)

Yes, folks, once again the time has come for me to make my 
semi-regular westy tent pole request.  this is getting ALMOST as 
predictable as Joel's Stats.

I am on a quest for the 4 corner 'Y' poles for the big orange, blue 
and white tent.  If anyone has a trashed tent they want to sell the 
poles from, i'm all ears.
