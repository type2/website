&gt; By looking at it, it appears to be in exellent condition execpt for the 
&gt; canvas top, rubber seal around the top, and needing the push rod tubes 
&gt; and that junk fixed.  I was told that that runs about 100.  I am new to 
&gt; the vw scene, but it is like the perfect vehicle for me as I am a diver 
&gt; and a camper.  Please give me your opinions about this vehicle.

I'm a diver and a camper too, and it *is* the perfect vehicle!  I think 
his asking price is a little high, though.  I see lots of campers of that
era for sale with similar qualifications for under $3k.  If the low miles
mean a lot to you (they don't to me, I think age is the primary factor)
then maybe it would be worth $2500, but replacing the top ain't gonna be
cheap.  Ditto the rubber seal.
