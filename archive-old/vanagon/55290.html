&gt; Hey all,
&gt; OK, I have a question.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been wondering this for a while, but how do I measure current with
&gt; my multimeter?  I've got your basic digital multimeter with two probes,
&gt; and a selection on the knob to measure DC amps up to 10 amps.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is where do I attach the test probes to determine current
&gt; draw?
&gt; 
&gt; I've never been really clear on this so if someone could answer this
&gt; admittedly silly question, I'd appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Sean
Sean,
You measure current by placing your meter in series with one of the ends
of what you want to measure.  Take one end of a wire off a device that
you want to measure attach the other end to the device where the wire
came off and read the meter, on the amp scale. If you don't get a
reading or the meter seems to deflect to the left, reverse the leeds and
try again. Think of it as measuring what goes through a single wire, cut
the wire in half and put your meter in between. Never ever  try to read
across a positive and negative while the meter is set for amperage, it
will blow your meter, ie + to - post of a battery.
