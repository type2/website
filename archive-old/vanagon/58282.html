Subject: Michelin MXL Tire Needed

I'm in need of one 205/70-14&quot; MXL reinforced tire to go with
the three new ones I've acquired.  Does anyone know of a
source where I can still buy a new one or an unused spare ?

We're getting ready to make a 4,000 mile trip with our '88
Westy and I'd like to replace the passenger car radials that
are on it with these reinforced Michelins.

Thanks,
Kevin Disse
'88 Westy GL
'83 Diesel GL
