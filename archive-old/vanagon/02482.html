&gt;... a couple of specifics for our tempoary mentor..
&gt;        1) I'm running Windoze/Winsock/PC-Eudora ver-1.4 for E-mail, and

uhhhhhhhhh... yeah. heheheheheheh. cool. &lt;beats the heck outa me&gt;

in answer to your questions,
1)  Gerry lied.
2)  Gerry lied.
3)  Gerry lied. and i don't know.

i am an 'appliance user' of these infernal machines. i have heard of FTP and
winsock and some of those other words/abbreviations, but i really don't know
anything technical about them ... just that some of the people around here
use those terms in their one-sided conversations. sorry. :(

&gt;        3) Any Digest option possible for us? Some E-mail readers won't
&gt;handle over 50Kb, I get a PorschePhiles list digest cut-up into pieces.

i suppose gerry could set the digest up to put out more smaller messages,
but that's something he'll have to do on return. it's not one of the 'keys
to the chastity belt' that he left with me (while HE is off on the crusades).
sorry again. :)

i think you have me confused with someone who knows something about computers.
i are an old cobol programmer. ;)

&lt;just filling in. now you kids settle down and play nicely!&gt;
