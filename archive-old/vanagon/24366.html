Wow, quite a response already!  

Anyway, I wanted to say a  couple of things:

a) First, I gave the wrong impression of my wife's attitude and
involvement.  Actually, she found it for me!  I have one of those
semi-rare vw-loving (and vw-fixing) wives, and I am glad we found each
other.  [Note: This is not a coerced apology :-).  It's the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but!]

b) The guy's not home, but I left a message on his machine.  As soon
as I find out anything, I'll share it.  That includes all you who
asked for the number too.  Is it unreasonable to &quot;keep it to myself&quot;
until I've checked it out?  I dunno; I'm debating that with myself....

-Mitch
