So Michael Heron says:
&gt; purchasing a headlamp from a company called &quot;Petzl&quot; (usually disclaimers
&gt; re; secret stock options i hold, my brother in law works for the company
&gt; etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; These lights are like the miner lights (you know they used to put them on
&gt; their helments when they went underground). They ahave an adjustable beam ,
&gt; and you can angle the direction of the light. Petzl headlamps are sold ,in
&gt; most outdoor stores or camping stores for around $30-40 Canadian (that is
&gt; about 10 bucks US at the current ewxchange rate :)  )
&gt; 

They are also good for using in crawl spaces and attics!  
Be sure to bring protective goggles with you when you climb under the
car so the little particles falling off the cars underside won't get
in your eyes.
