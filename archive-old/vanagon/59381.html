&gt; After a nice meal of peanut butter and crackers, then  visiting church,
&gt;Pizza Hut, and the grocery store, he headed back into the woods.   No
&gt;wonder the mice like our house!

My '87 Acura had a mouse (aftermarket not factory installed).  We
discovered it in June 1995 when we found a nest in the glove box.  We
destroyed that nest only to find a new one in the trunk.  We set several
traps but never caught it.  Then one day my wife was driving and received a
lovely back massage from our mouse who was living in the drivers seat.  I
didn't believe her until I felt it myself.  We have since sold the car but
never did get the mouse out.
