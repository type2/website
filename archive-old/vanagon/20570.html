Subject: People near Colorado

     Hi &quot;people near Colorado&quot;.
     
     I went to order some stuff from Bus-Stop and the parts came to
     $60. They were only small parts like, gas cap, pedal rubbers, carb 
     repair kits. and they wanted $87 for the postage to the UK!!!
     
     I reckon the postage would come to no more than $30, but they won't 
     post stuff normal mail, it has to go via a carrier so that it's 
     insured.
     
     here's the deal:
     
     Does anyone who live real close to The Bus-Stop feel like doing me a 
     big favour?
     
     This would be to pick the stuff up and send it via normal mail to me 
     in the UK.
     
     Anyone interested in helping out?
     
     cheers,
     
     Lee.
