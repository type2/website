Subject: Toyotomi A/C unit

To All those who asked for more info on the small a/c unit, Toyotomi TID-1200

I purchased mine at: Yaohan Best (a Japanese grocery store in San Diego)
The price in 1993 was $550 &amp; tax. I called them and they only carry the
larger TID-1800.

But I digress, The TID-1200 is a 4000 BTU, 400W (very efficient), small (W
10.5in. X D 14in X H 26in), weight 43lbs, Quiet, freestanding a/c unit.
This unit uses an exhaust hose which I stick out whichever window is
convenient at the time, depending on if I'm parked or driving.

I called the place that distributes them in L.A., Shilac Ent., Phone#
310-791-2855. They said no one carries the 1200 anymore but you can order
one direct from them by calling. She said the price is now $639. I assume
that would be plus shipping.

If anyone's interested, my girlfriend purchased the larger TID-1800 at the
same time. It's 7200btu, uses 840W but it's a bit much for what I had in
mind. Both have never given a lick of trouble.
