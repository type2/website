&gt;.................We then inflated the tires and the 2 front tires held air
but the rear tires
&gt;had major leaks around the seal.  Using a compressor and air tools borrowed

&gt;found that it would take more time and tools than what we had
available.......................

Mike I am going to Indianapolis to pick up a '69 Camper from a friend on the
list,, man I hope we don't have all of the problems that you did.  sounds
like a nightmare , but one that will one day be a dream?  I am using the '69
that I get from  Jim to put the powertrain from my '71 Cracked Frame  Westy
.  good luck on the restoration :)
