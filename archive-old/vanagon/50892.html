Subject: RE: Important?

Anyone ever heard of Tim McDermott? I havn't seen him on the list
before. Does he know it's Friday? hummm... I wonder. He seemed a little
too sorry about his message not being VW related. 

	If you ask me I wouldn't give this company any info. If Tim's a list
member than my apologies, but it sounds to me like a scam within a scam.

just keeping everyone safe,

Erik
