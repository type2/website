I have an 86 vanagon when the engine has been running for a while
the oil light has been comming on at low rpm.  I am suspecting the oil
pump????  Its too bad now that I changed the fluids tranny and engine
I cant seem to keep her running long enough to get the engine warm again
sounds  like the timming now  I'll try and keep you up to date if I find 
the prob :)
