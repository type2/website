Subject: '72 Westy for sale


Looks like the credit cards are maxed out and something has to go :(

Your basic 1972 Westfalia, engine in many many pieces, but it used
to run :) Body is in good shape, very minimal rust, good brakes and
transmission. And an aux. heater!!

It is sitting in my driveway in the Santa Cruz mountains (south Bay
Area), another vehicle and a tow rope ought to drag it out.

It's yours for a song and a dance, it's good for a rebuild or as
parts, give me a reasonable offer.
