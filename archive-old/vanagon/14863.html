Howdy,

	OK, got the driver's side cab floor pan, from Wolfsburg West, put in
last night.  The fit sucked, of course.  The hole for the pedal was so far 
off I just cut around it!  And the replacement piece has no accomodation for
the steering column, but I guess that makes it portable to RHD 
versions - SNOT!

	Oh well, thats the last of the aftermarket replacemnt pieces to weld 
in; the engine compartment piece I'm going to fab from a section from
the junkyard and a piece of sheet metal.

	BTW - The only real disapointment from WW has been the replacement
panels - the other bits (rubber pieces, lenses, springs, etc) have
been OK, and the service is OK except for one switch up.  I've placed
4 orders so far...

Thom
