Subject: 1800cc type 4 carb adjustment...

Dear list,
  Does anyone know which way to turn the idle speed adjustment screw in the
central idle unit of the 1800cc\twin carbs bus to REDUCE idle speed? This
screw is the LARGE one of the 2. Mine is screwed all the way IN, and if I
loosen the screw the rpm's will eventually go down, but only at the expense
of a nasty SUCKING SOUND...Doesn't sound right...
  Lost,
            G.


               Gravity is a myth...the earth sucks !
