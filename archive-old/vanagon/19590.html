To All:

I propose the creation of a suitable 'Baja Van Racing Team' bumper sticker,
mebbe some T-shirts &amp; funny hats to wear backwards.  Anyone who is a no-show
south of the line qualifies as a Pre-Runner, those who do the dreadful deed
are Pit Crew.  We print them up, pass them out and look very superior at the
next SOTO do, not say a word about it until someone asks.  Then we can peer
down our nose, in the way SOTO does so well and murmur &quot;Failed to qualify,
eh?&quot;

-Bob
