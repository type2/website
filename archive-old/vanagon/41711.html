  OFFICE MEMO          RE&gt;Eurovan Catalytic Converter         Date:5/9/96

you said
&lt;this individual states that as a 
     result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger 
     compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle

I say
Geez, some people are never happy, (said in sobbing tone) &quot;my volkswagon is
so cold in the winter, I wish they had better heaters&quot;
Now their complaining that they are too hot, sheesh. No wonder VW doesn't
want to import anything to the states anymore : ) 
But seriously, I haven't really noticed an increase in heat in the
compartment. I think the EV's are great, highly recommend 'em.
