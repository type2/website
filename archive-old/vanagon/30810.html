Charley, that was the set-up on the bugs, I don't think they ever did 
this on the '73 type II . To do something like that in the bus you would 
either have to store the spare on the passengers seat or cut a hole
 in the front of the van to run a line. Probably have a leak either in the 
valve stem or the reservoir itself. If the tank is holding fluid then it's
releasing the pressure through the valve stem. On one of my old type IIs I 
hooked up a bicycle pump and pump it when needed. Probably should just 
replace it though.
