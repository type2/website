My experience with those electronic Koolatron units is that  thet suck.  The
problem is that the maximum Temp difference is too low.  ( -40 F)  So when
its 103F outside and I would really like some ice cold water, I get bath temp
instead.
If anyone really wants to try this, I have a Koolatron B42 insert module for
$50.  Fits into existing cabinet.  Draws 6 amps.
What the concept really needs is a two stage thermoelectric module but such a
unit would pull 15 Amps.
Can you say BIG battery?
