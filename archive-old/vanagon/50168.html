Subject: RE: 78 aux battery

While looking to install an aux battery in my '71 I was reading through 
my West Marine Catalog and they have a unit called a &quot;Battery Combiner&quot; 
which their write up says is better than an isolator. Anybody have any
experience with these?

The technical write up about the battery combiner is also on their web page _at_:

&gt;Go with the switch.  I've tried both the isolator set-up and relay 
&gt;set-up.  The relay won't work when the battery driving the relay is 
&gt;dead, thus effectively eliminating the usefullness of the device (had 
&gt;to use jumpers between batteries to get relay to work).  
&gt;Isolators still have a drain problem and a charging problem.  After 
&gt;the primary battery is charged the system quits charging and won't 
&gt;fully charge the secondary.
&gt;
&gt;Geta a switch.  A or B battery or both.  I also bought an Amp meter, 
&gt;so I can check on the battery condition.  Only problem is that I never 
&gt;hooked this stuff up.  The Amp Meter needs to be REALLY close to the 
&gt;alternator to work.  Great for front engines but . . .  Haven't found 
&gt;a good location for the switch, that sucker is BIG.  Haven't found an 
&gt;acceptable location for the secondary battery(s).  '80 westi.  One of 
&gt;these days.

&gt;&gt; Forget the isolator/alternator setup and wire a high-power relay which
&gt;&gt; connects the + on your aux batteries to the + on your starting battery.
&gt;&gt; These relays are silver canisters that are available at RV stores for about
&gt;&gt; 10 bucks.  Cheaper than the &quot;isolators&quot; and work better too.

&gt;&gt; So what's the deal as you understand it Dave? Why is a relay better than an 

&gt;&gt; isolator? My dad, the old boat guy, says that the most efficient solution 
would 
&gt;&gt; be to have a big marine switch to toggle back and forth from A to B battery
&gt;&gt; combined with a memory good enough to switch it regularly. The diode
