Subject: Re: Igniton switch / Overheating / Tires

It is very easy to replace the electrical switch.  
1. remove the plastic covers.
2. Remove the plug to the ignition,
3. If I remenber correctly there is only one screw holding the switch in
place.
4. Slide the switch out of the metal housing. 
5. reinstall.

I have disassembled a switch and cleaned the contacts.  A new one only
costs $8.  The steering, lock bolt is more difficult to remove. I think
it requires drilling at a particular point to release a holding pin.
Good luck

&gt; &gt; At one point, when I attempted to turn the engine off, the key was stuck in

&gt; had
&gt; &gt;  unplug the wire harness from the switch and hot wire it to get home
&gt; &gt;  (praying the whole way that the steering lock wouldn't engage) because the
&gt; &gt;  lock was completely jammed. My question is this; can the electrical switch
&gt; &gt;  part be separated from the key cylender
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;or do they have to be replaced together?
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Is it possible that a short caused the electrical contacts to fuse together?
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't seen that before, but it seems possible to me.
