&gt; of that for this &quot;snow &amp; ice newbie&quot;?  I already have some
&gt; Z-chains (they go on fast &amp; fit great!), but I'm curious
&gt; about the tire pressure technique.

Having lived with snow and ice in Illinois for 25 years of driving
pleasure, I can state truthfully that lowering the pressure in your
tires will cause them to wear out the sidewalls faster, get you stuck in
the snow as much or more than properly inflated tires, AND give you more
surface to skid/slide on the ice.

In other words, it is not a good idea :(

Snow tires, studded tires (if allowed in your state), or chains are your
best choice.

Or you can do what I do... bundle up until April ;)

Keep warm,
