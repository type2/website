yes, redundant contacts for greater reliability.    :-)
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for the quesiton - when i carefully bent the arm on the wiper to
&gt; develope new contact - I did it ever so slightly.  I would like to bend it
&gt; even more to have a nice clean contact surface.

do not have too much tension on it so as to increase surface pressure 
friction and wear thru the thin film coating.  i would leave it stock 
pressure but clean the underside of the points and the carbon track.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, those of you who have done this fix - how long did it work 
for??

air flow meter on my Toyota has gone just about exactly 100,000 
additional miles after a cleaning at 166K miles.  '87 wasserboxer has 
about 300 miles after cleaning and it still is good.
