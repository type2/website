Subject: re: EuroVan rust

Regarding rust on EVs:

This rust on relatively new vehicles is troubling, especially when
I compare it to the other VW in my driveway ('87 VW Quantum, 150K miles).
The Quantum is rust free and the paint is still shining after 10 New England
winters.  The EV on the other hand has quickly fading paint, a 12 inch
section of seam rust on the left vertical seam, and three other spots*
that the paint peeled off.  I don't care if the paint is environmentally
friendly.  It should be environmentally AND owner friendly; they shouldn't 
have used it until they had the formulation figured out, and should
stand behind it, not just offer a perforation warranty. 

The VW dealer seems to be slowly agreeing to fix the seam rust, but I can't 
see how the rest of it will look good after many more winters.  

I support the idea of a rust registry.  It can't hurt.  In fact I think
my records of EV piston slap problems from this list helped them decide
to replace my engine (someday I'll write that long episode up).

* three other rust spots: 
	1)at rear edge of sliding door track, 
	2)hidden from sight at bottom left corner where sliding door rubber 
	  bumper hits body - a very bad place
   	3)left side of rear hatch where hatch door rubber bumper hits body
