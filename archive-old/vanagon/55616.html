Subject: Re: SA Quad light grille UPDATE

In terms of putting the quad light grille on an 86-91 vanagon, what lights
are actually usuable? Someone said something about raiding an early
vanagon for its round lights, but that will only give me the round light
and its mounting/adjusting hardware, no? What about the two high beams
or those included in the grille? Will the round lamp mounting frame bolt
right onto my 87 vanagon or do I have to rig it?

	If anyone knows the answers to this off the top of their head, it
would be much appreciated. Otherwise I hopefully will remember to check
the next time I head out to a junkyard and post to the list...
