Subject: Re: alternator vs. generator for 71 camper


&gt;Basically I'm looking for pros, cons, and considerations putting this
&gt;motor (alternator vs. generator) in the 71 camper.

I understand electrical things only dimly, so get other opinions:

My 68 runs an alternator on a 1971 Type II DP. I don't think there are any
differences between the Type II and Type I as far as the pedestal goes.
David Easterwood set this up before he sold me the bus and he could
probably tell you more. It works just fine.

NOTE: The alternator is big and will either touch the carb or be very, very
close. I can't tell whether it actually touches from glancing, you might be
able to get a strip of paper in between them. On the 34 PICT-3, you'll have
to bend the throttle linkage a little or else it will bind against the
alternator and the throttle will stick open.

Do this *before* starting the bus and make sure the linkage clears through
the entire range of travel, OK? It's pretty scary to have the throttle
stick open when you go to shift. My alternator has scratches on it. Can you
guess what happened? ;)

What do you need the voltage regulator for?
