Subject: Re: Ebersparker (SP?) heater for 1970 Westie

&gt;At the Palo Alto swapmeet Yesterday .I got myself a good working ebersparker.
&gt;But there is a problem.
&gt;
&gt;The westie has a spare wheel well just where the heater is meant to go.  Does
&gt;one just cut away at the bottom of the spare wheel well


No, you shouldn't have to since they fitted there for years. Short bracket 
holds the heater to the rear corner floor, front of the heater is supported 
by the piping that goes forward into the rear seat area. Did you get that 
piping also? It will guide you a bit for positioning. Skip the defroster 
attempt, just more headaches. Only reason to cut the wheel well is if you 
have the intake pipes that pull air from the interior/wheel well for 
reheating, 1972 on, instead of sucking 'fresh' air from the engine 
compartment. tim s.
