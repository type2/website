Subject: Forwarded: Suspicious Syncro Shifting Symptoms

As you were describing your trans shifting problems, I was all set to say
sounds like the syncronizers.  Until you mentioned that the clutch doesn't
completely free up the trans,  it still seems to be slightly engaged.

I had a similiar problem, and first tackled the slave cylinder.  What a bear
to get the old one off (hard to reach a nut) but I did and put a new on.  It
may have helped some, but maybe I wanted to believe that.  Anyway awhile later
the trans started losing fluid (watch it drip rapidly when hot).  When I took
the trans out to replace the input seal, I noticed the pilot bearing in the
flywheel/crankshaft was non-existant.  With the bearing gone the input shaft
wobbled around and destroyed the input seal.  I now attribute the poor clutch
action to be the input shaft binding up a little in the self destructing
needle bearing.

My tranny was getting hard to shift between 1 and 2 in cold weather.  Of
course that is minor since it is now seized with an apparent syncronizer
breakdown!!
