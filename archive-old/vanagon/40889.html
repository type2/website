My dearly de-&quot;parted&quot; '61 had bullet turns.  Got that serial number 
written down *somewhere* ...

&gt; There seems to be some question about whether bullets existed in the
&gt; 1961 model year.
&gt; 
&gt; Tom F mentioned that the number 672483 would be later than '60 - according
&gt; to the NEATO data at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/chassis.html
&gt; 
&gt; He also cited a source for the change over date from bullets as:
