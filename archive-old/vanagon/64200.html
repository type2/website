Subject:      Mould on water pipes

I use a submersible pump inside a 10-gallon tank, and I've
noticed that the plastic pipe inside the tank feels slimy.
Also, the wire leading to the pump develops small deposits
of green mould or algae. It's the correct type of pipe, and the
wire is that which came with the pump.

Is this doing me any harm?  I can't believe it is, but is
there a doctor in the house?
