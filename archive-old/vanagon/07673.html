&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I just wondered if anyone knew about thermostats.  I have a 72 Kombi There
&gt; is no thermostat an no way to circulate air (where the fan is housed).  I
&gt; think there is supposed to be one or both.  My other Kombi didn't have
&gt; either ine either.  Am I missing something or being perceptive????

There should be a thermostat on the passenger side of the crankcase near
the bottom.  It is a small, round, accordion (sp?) looking thing.  There
should be a wire leaving it going toward the rear of the vehicle, and
then around a pulley and up between the fan housing and the engine.  It
then attaches to a horizontal shaft which runs the width of the engine at
the top of the fan housing.  You can't see this shaft easily, but the 
small lever where the wire attaches should be visible about 2/3 of the way
to the right (passenger side) of the fan housing (at the top).  The shaft
controls two flaps inside of the fan housing which control airflow.
Hope that explanation wasn't too cryptic...
