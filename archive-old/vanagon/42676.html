Subject: Manassas Bug-Out

I will be vending at the Manassas Bug-Out in Virginia this Sunday.  
If any list members want to stop by and say hi (of if you need 
parts!), I will have my dark brown '85 Westy, probably with a small 
U Haul trailer, and a sign that says VW BUS/CAMPER PARTS. 

I plan to bring a bunch of parts from the '76 &amp; '78 busses I 
stripped last month, and from the 2 '63 Deluxe busses I am 
currently stripping. Also some parts from my '77 parts Westy and 
various other busses and campers I've had along the way. 

I'll be the one passed out on the ground next to the Vanagon. 
My wife and I are having a party all day Saturday. Then I plan 
to leave the party at about 2 am and drive straight through to 
Manassas, where I will immediately fall asleep and miss most of the 
show.  

This is supposed to be the East Coast's largest VW show.  I am 
determined not to miss it this time. Hope to see some of you there!

Ron Salmon
