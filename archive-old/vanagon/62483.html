Subject: Re: Tech tip #2/torque values

&gt;   I to use these things.... They (at best) get within 50 ft/lb.
&gt;   For the Vanagon that's not good enough! Also I have never
&gt;   seen a set of these with the proper torch for the Vanagon!
&gt;   My hands do a better job of setting the torch! 
&gt;
&gt;
Excuse my ignorance but what are the torque values for Vanagon lug nuts
(standard wheels) and why are they so crucial?  Thanks in advance for
educating a novice.
