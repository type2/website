 Ummmm, boys?  Are you aware that the Synchro Westy is only supposed to get
 16 highway and 16 city?  Okay, milage may vary, but how is it possible that
 you're getting between 25-50% better milage than you should?  Could you
 please share your magic with the rest of us?
 
 EPA esitmates are pretty accurate if a bit conservative, but these claims
 you're making are astounding.  Either your record keeping is inaccurate, or
 there is something special about your Vans.  Even non-Westy non-synchro
 Vans don't get 23mpg.

Well, according to the window sticker of my 85 Westy (yep, I still have it)
it was rated at 18 MPG city and 20 MPG highway.  It goes on to say &quot;Actual
Mileage will vary.  Results reported to EPA indicate that the majority of
vehicles with these estimates will achieve between 15 and 21 mpg in the city
and 17 and 23 mpg on the highway.&quot;

IMHO For the classification of van, I don't believe the fuel economy as
reported on the list is unreasonable for a  Westy.  Maybe you need to raise
your expectations.

In any event I expect more than 15 MPG in the city with an unloaded Westy and
I will continue to try to identify the Problem.  Tires are OK, fuel is not
reformulated in Vermont (yet), My next step is injector cleaner, the black
soot still concerns me.
