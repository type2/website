Subject: Front glass

 Volks,

 Hello to all and as customary, to the point. Larsen is in need of a front
windshield. Just noticed it had a tiny crack and due to the type of
restoration being performed, replacing it is the only way to deal with the
situation. It is a 1956 Microbus but I am of the belief that any front glass
up to 1967 will do and that both pieces are the same so any side will also
be accepted.

 If I'm wrong, someone let me know. Please send mail directly to me in order
to conserve band width. TIA.
