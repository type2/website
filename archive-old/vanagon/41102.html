Subject: WTB grille, hubcap for 86 Vanagon

A friend of mine is in search of the lower front grille for an 86 vanagon,
as well as a hubcap for a GL.  I don't know how many different styles of
hubcap came on an 86 GL, but it looks like many of the other ones I've seen.
If you have one or any leads, e-mail me we'll compare notes on what it looks
like.  

Thanks!
