Subject: RE: 71 no start

&gt;I just rebuilt my 71 1600dp and installed it into my bus and it will not
&gt;start.  in checking when the rotor is at the #1 position the plug for #1
&gt;sparks, the piston is at TDC and the valve clearance is at specs.  The firing
&gt;order is correct. The thing will not even make a noise.  It just turns over
&gt;and over.  nice and smooth but no fire.  I did just for kicks twist the
&gt;distributer half way around and got a puf of smoke.  I installed the
&gt;distributer gear correct with the # piston at TDC  Sometimes I think no gas
&gt;but the filter is full.  I get no real smell of gas from the plug.  should i
&gt;throw sone gas directly down the carb or just all over the bus and burn it to
&gt;the ground.

Something I encountered after installing a rebuilt in my 70:  the carb had
been sitting for so long that the float bowl dried out.  Check with a mirror
to see that gas is getting in the carb throat.  Before you pour gas down the
throat, take off the 5 screws that hold the top of the carb on and make sure
the bowl is full of gas.  If not, fill it up.  Are the points/condensor good?
