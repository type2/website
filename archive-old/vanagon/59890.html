&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houghton-Mifflin publishing company is giving books to children's
                &lt;snip&gt;

If they want to give 1 million books they will give 1 million books
regardless of their publicity gimmick.
Why is it always AOLers who fall for these things.  There are 1 or 2 smart
people with AOL, but the 20 million others give them a bad name.
Please!  That damn kid in the hospital doesn't really want any more cards
either, for when you hear about that one.  And The exploding whale with the
Jato Unit did not have the toothbrush pictures when he stapled himself back
up and cleaned off his peanut butter.
