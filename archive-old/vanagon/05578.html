Subject: Sticking Spedometer....

As the title says, the speedo on my '81 Vanagon is sticking...it's pretty
strange seeing it read 55mph while I'm stopped at a light... :-)  I'm wondering
if some WD-40 sprayed into the area where the cable comes in the back might fre
e it up, or should I also spray in the front on the needle axle.  Is WD40 the
best type of lubricant, or should I use graphite or something?

Any ideas appreciated,
Andy
