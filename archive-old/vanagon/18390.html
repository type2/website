Subject: Swivel-foot Adjusters

               Elephant's Feet, the Panda's Thumb
                     And Volkswagen's Valves

A standard maintenance item on Volkswagen engines was replacing
the valve adjuster screws every couple of years.  The slot would
get buggered from the screwdriver and the face, a nicely cambered
curve, would become faceted.  They were inexpensive and the parts
man at most VW dealerships kept them bagged in sets of eight and
near the counter.  &quot;Adjusters?&quot;  Toss, clink.  &quot;Thanks&quot; and out
the door you go.

The top of the valve stem is flat.  The adjuster screw is
cambered; you create a point-contact between them when you adjust
the valves.  The contact area is quite small and wears down
rapidly, hence the need for constant readjustment.  But once
you'd faceted the face of the adjuster screw -- once you no
longer had a neatly cambered curve -- the life of the adjuster is
over.  Any future adjustments will fall on the 'corners' between
the facets; you will have brought a dull knife-edge to bear
against the tip of the valve stem instead of a smooth curve. 
Such an edge will wear with remarkable speed, often in less than
a hundred miles.  And it doesn't do the valve any good, either. 
The point-of-contact between the adjuster and the valve stem is
off-set toward one edge of the valve.  Actuating the valve in
that fashion causes it to rotate, insuring a good seal against
the valve seat.  Since the wiping motion of the rocker is
distributed around the circumference of the top of the valve
stem, the wear is distributed; the valve stem stays fairly flat. 
But if the point of contact is an edge rather than a smooth
camber, it wears a groove; the top of the valve becomes dished,
causing the stem to mushroom, often to the point where chips will
break off.  Very complicated things, those valve adjusters.  So
we replaced them often, as VW intended.

(People often forget that regrinding the stem of a valve is the
first step in refacing the valve.  The regrinding returned the
stem to a flat surface.  The better mechanics then burnished the
ground surface with an India stone.)  [But on the intakes only,
please; VW exhaust valves should be replaced rather than
reground.]

The proper valve lash is zero.  We set the VW's valves at
something greater than that to insure proper lash at operating
temperature; there will always be some gap -- and some noise --
but you don't want too much or the impact of adjuster against
valve stem will hammer the stem into a mushroom, even if the face
of the adjuster is a cambered curve.  

Due to their self-adjusting nature, hydraulic cam followers
provide zero valve lash, in effect adjusting themselves each time
the valve is actuated. That's why hydraulic cam followers provide
maximum valve life, and why they run so quietly.

In the 1960's Ford of Germany introduced a new kind of adjuster,
one having a flat face.  It accommodated the wiping action of the
rocker because the flat face was in a ball-and-socket joint, a
tricky bit of mechanical engineering.  VW enthusiasts quickly
adopted the German Ford adjusters because we saw immediately that
without the cambered point-of-contact we could achieve a more
accurate adjustment, the flat foot wouldn't wear as fast, and we
wouldn't have to adjust the valves so often.  We called them
'Elephant Feet' and smiled, even though a set of them cost about
twenty dollars (big bucks in the mid-sixties, especially with VW
adjusting screws going for two bits).  We hustled back to the
shop, re-threaded our VW rockers (the Ford adjusters used a
different thread) and enjoyed the freedom of adjusting the valves
only once or twice a year instead of every week.  And you never
had to replace those things; they lasted just about forever.

Nowadays you can get swivel-foot type adjusters specifically for
the VW from a variety of sources.  Even J. C. Whitney has them
(p/n 37--8589A, $16).  If you aren't using them, you should be. 

Gene Berg sells a swivel-foot adjuster that adjusts with an Allen
wrench instead of a screwdriver.  They are a dream to adjust; the
Allen wrench is like the pointer on a micrometer's dial.  But if
you're running hydraulic valves, you'll only need to adjust the
adjusters ONCE, when the engine is assembled.  And in that case,
it doesn't really matter if the things use an Allen wrench, a
screwdriver or the handle off a screen door.  (The Whitney-type
of adjuster last longer than Gene's, apparently due to the larger
bearing surface.)

                           Sermonette

The first 'Volkswagen' engine belched fire sometime in 1932.  A
lot of things have changed since then.  In this, and more than
two dozen other sermons uploaded to the net, I've pointed out
some of those changes that can be applied to the Volkswagen
engine for the purpose of improving its performance and
longevity.  In each case, the improvement -- and my opinion of
them -- is the result of direct personal experience gained over
nearly forty years of tinkering with Volkswagens.  Alas, many of
these improvements run counter to the flow of Conventional Wisdom
espoused by the various VW-specific magazines and endorsed by the
'owners' of some of the VW-specific lists on the Internet.  

I urge you to think for yourself, reading all such opinions
(including this one) with the critical eye of a skeptic.  If you
have questions, ask; anyone expressing an opinion should be
willing to justify it with additional data.
