&gt; 
&gt; you dont know me but i got your name off dworkins vw list . I now own and
&gt; repair a 86 syncro since my wolfsburg weekender tumbled down the freeway
in
&gt; colorado.  i'd appreciate any tips on a the particularities of the syncro
&gt; and sources for parts (i'm in sandiego) . I'm heading for baja in a few
&gt; weeks and i'll befixing my front end soon there is an ever increasing
noise
&gt; out of the right front steering/suspension that gets really loud when i
turn
&gt; left. i suspecr a CV joint or wheel bearing since the sound is caused by
a
&gt; rotating part. also has anyone had problems with front brake calipers the
&gt; pads seem to crack into pieces . someone told me the caliper housing
flexes
&gt; when it heats up.
