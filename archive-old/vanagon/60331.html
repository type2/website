Subject: Propane Problem

All Knowing Vanamaniacs,

 Went to have my propane tank filled on &quot;Leslie&quot; 87 Syncro Westy in
preparation for the upcoming three day weekend, and Kim my friendly Madison
area propane expert coudn't get the gas to stay in the tank. Seems the
o-rings are shot or possibly the entire valve.... Hank (I mean Kim) says
&quot;you can't get these o-rings or valves anywhere&quot;.... Bill VW dealer parts
guru says &quot;I can get you the whole valve from VW for 6 pints of blood and
one of your vital organs ($320).&quot;  Me says NO!

 Any wisdom from the list? Part sources for these pups? This valve seems
pretty simple...

Much Thanx!   R.

87 Syncro Vanagon Westfalia
92 Syncro Passat(G60)
Both Titian Red!
