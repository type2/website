Subject: Re: Door Handle Repairs

Evidently my post on door handles and locks struck a nerve.
wsilva_at_capecod_dot_net was correctly informed that VW used a grease.
Ric Golden's suggestion to use penetrating oil instead of WD40
will work on locks not *terribly* gunked up.  Once crud develops
inside the core, a lot of cleaning is in order.

I now have two of the three offenders fixed.  As I stated in my
previous post, I discovered the core for the two front doors is
held in place by a dowel-pin (VW terminology for tension pin at
Ace Hardware).  I could not drive the pin out and resorted to
force.  Since I couldn't find a 2mm pin, I settled on a 1/16th
inch cotter pin (stainless) and drilled out the old pin very
carefully.

After the core is removed from the handle it's a matter of
removing all crud so things operate smoothly again.  I pulled all
seven tumbler wafers (keeping track of the order) out and used
Brasso to bring back the shine.  I pulled all seven tumbler
springs and cleaned them too.  These are tiny!  It helps to run a
straight pin or safety pin through them to keep track of them
while you clean out the gunk.  I used a tootbrush.  While
extracting one spring it shot across the room, so be careful!
Fortunately this is one part from a split-window bus which will
fit a Vanagon and I have extras from a '67 ignition switch.

While VW used a grease, I found that most of the crud I removed
was graphite/grease combo (from putting lockthaw in I'm sure).
After a while the springs get filled up and won't *spring*
anymore.  Then the tumbler wafers won't move and get stuck in the
&quot;open&quot; position.  I just read Tim Smith's post and agree totally
with his approach, though I used carb cleaner and compressed air
to clean the barrel.

One more thing...there's a nylon (I think) washer that slips over
the barrel when it goes back into the handle.  Old buses used
O-rings and/or a felt ring to keep water and other contaminants
out of the lock.  My opinion is that what we put in is probably
the worst offender, not nature, so be careful what you squirt in
the keyhole, you'll either have to live with it or eventually
clean it out!

This is one of those projects that doesn't fit well in the
&quot;automotive repair&quot; category.  The &quot;car guys&quot; generally don't
work on locks.  The &quot;lock guys&quot; aren't interested in the van much
either.  If you need lock repair, I suggest you remove the handle
yourself.  We're all handy aren't we?  If the lock repair is
beyond you, take the handle(s) to a locksmith and let him/her do
the &quot;fine&quot; work.
