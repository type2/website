While you're on the subject of EV's.  

When the temps drop into the 30's - 40's, and after sitting all night. 
First thing in the morning, for the first couple of miles, the thing
sounds like a jet. The way it whines, you would think it has a turbine in
it (wouldn't that be cool and hot). 

Has anybody else experienced this?  I assume it's the tranny whining.
It's not very loud.

&gt; Do you know the difference between a EuroVan driver and a BayWindow

&gt; 
&gt; A Bay Window driver has to keep the windows closed to keep the
&gt; heat in....A EuroVan driver has to open the windows to let the
