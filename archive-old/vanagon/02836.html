Subject: nightime visability


Another thing you can do to make you car stand out at night (although
please first check to make sure it is legal in your area) is:
neon under body lighting
neon lighting around your license plate frames
moving X-mas tree-type lights around your license plate frames,
    which can also be wired into your brake as a cue signal.....

or, if you want to get REALLY fancy (and if you plan to have a
TV in your van/westy) illuminate the external mobile antennae.  JC
(not Joel) Whitney carries something that will illuminate it like
X-mas tree lights, and can also be set out to blink left
and right while operating turn signals, and I would assume,
while braking.  To be sure, this stuff can rapidly all become
the epitome of tackiness, but should we care about these
things when visability/safety are involved?   ;)
