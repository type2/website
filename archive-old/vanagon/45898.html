Subject: Farewell...  

Greetings all,
  I just wanted to say thanks for all the pleasure this list has provided me,
but I must unsubscribe for a while.  Mostly because you guys are just too
prolific.  When I was unemployed, I looked forward to every message, even to
the point of checking the list every hour.  Now that I'm gainfully employed,
I'm lucky to get online 2 or 3 times a week.  Needless to say, my last email
download session lasted over 15 minutes at 28.8K.  I'll still check the
summaries on the web, and will probably resubscribe in due time...

Thanks again,
Ryan
