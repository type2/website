Subject: Syncro Handling/Sway Bars

The handling of the syncro is definitely worse on the highway.

The handling of the syncro is definitely better off the highway.

In order to improve handling on my syncro, I added anti sway bars from JC
Whtney. These double as extra skid plate type protection for the underside of
the vehicle.

I used the 2WD anti sway bars from JC Whtney and fabricated mounts so they
would fit.

The syncros, especially loaded campers, absolutely should not use the
Michelin MXLs. Instead, they should use the light truck tires with the extra
plys in the sidewalls. I run BF Goodrich All Terrain radials in 27 x 8..50
size. These provide an extra inch of valuable ground clearance in addition to
being good off-road.
