Subject: mpg on 87 syncro

I have an 87 syncro with 120K miles.  I am getting 15 mpg.  My question is
 -- is this normal???   Normal or not can I do something to improve it.  If
not, can I put an extra gas tank so that I don't have to stop for gas every
200 miles.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.
