Subject: Thanks Gerry

I realized after I posted my last responce that I failed to thank Gerry.
His dedication, skill and love of the VW has produced a list that serves
many people.  Thank you Gerry,  You will be missed.  The list has'nt lost
its friendly informal feel, as do so many newsgroups.  People get tied up in
formalizing how to relate to the list.  You have prevented over regulation
of the list.  People feel free to express themselves or to offer needed
services.  A great big Thank you to Gerry
