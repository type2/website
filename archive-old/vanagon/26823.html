The list is going to be unstable for a bit. I'm going to try to move it 
to YAM (Yet Another Machine).  I'm hoping to solve the compuserv problems 
this way.  The machine I'm moving it to has sendmail configured in such a 
way that it delivers to compuserv addresses correctly, and it appears 
that the machine it was on doesn't. (It's not my job to fix it and the 
person whose job it is hasn't done it {GRRRR}).

Unfortunately, it's crossing architectures, so I've been reluctant to do this
in the past.  Now I'm feeling forced..... It's a _good thing_ (tm).  It
should improve the service slightly and should give me fewer bounces to deal
with.  Please contact me if you see weirdness like duplicates or delays (not
related to AOL that is &lt;smile&gt;) or obviously missing posts. 

This message will serve as a first test for the server.
