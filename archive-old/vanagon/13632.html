&gt; David Schwarze would like to know:
&gt; 	I don't suppose you would know what size jets are in those carbs?
&gt; My bus is going to 2 liters at some point in the not-too-distant future,
&gt; and I was wondering what size jets to put in it...
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
  The Haynes for 72-79 buses says that the   uropean 2 liter engines with
  Solexes have a 132.5 main jet an a 155 air correction jet. I used 137.5
  mains in my '72 and they were too rich for decent mileage. I think I 
  have a pair of 135 mains if you need them. I could use some 155 air
  correction jets if you find a source for them, though that's the least
  of my problems right now.

  Dave
