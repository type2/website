To All,

  It's been a more common thing to find these cracks in the heads 
lately.

  We (Volks Cafe) have found more and more of the Vanagons that we 
service, or are in for Headgasket jobs have cracked heads!Also the studs 
in the cases are starting to look pretty bad too.It's more common to 
replace a good number of the studs due to corrosion these days too.

  I see that Justin had to wait 2 weeks for studs, I keep in stock 2 
full sets of these studs. That's one of the biggest reasons I have 
offrered the VW parts that I do.  I can't stand to see people wait 
longer than necessary and or pay too much for parts that I have sitting 
on a shelf.  

  I've never had a problem with the gasket sets being short gaskets 
either, and I hope to never send anybody a set that's short either.

  We do about 2-3 headgasket jobs a week.  We also do about 3-4 complete 
rebuilds a month.  I get the chance to see so many different situations 
with these engines.  I'm more fortunate than some that I get to learn 
alot more than most about the different things these engines are doing 
and problems that they're having. 

  Anyone that needs any info that I may have feel free to e-mail me on 
that subject.
