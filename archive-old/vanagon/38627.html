Call &quot;JK&quot; at 713-523-1033 (any time)

To get the this price you have to mention the &quot;Rusty VanBondo Special&quot; or
&quot;Internet Special&quot;
$800.00 FOB Houston, TX

Seller is planning advertising locally soon for $1200 OBO 

VanBondo wishes that he was closer to Houston. Parts on this bus clearly
exceed the asking price. Rear bumpers of this type (in great shape) have
recently commanded nearly $600 in AZ/CA/NM. The tail lights are worth around
$300 per pr. Semaphores speak for themselves...

~VanBondo has not seen this bus. Please call &quot;JK&quot; with all question.

Happy Hunting!
