Subject: Re: rust on a longblock oops shortblock and more/Reply

Hello Steven,

I have had excellent results using Hoppe's bore cleaner (available in
sporting goods dept., but not the 'gun oil') and a rough, clean rag. 
Use very sparingly.  Whatever method you use, don't remove any metal
from a machined surface.  And don't sweat the rust on the rough cast
sections of the block as it doesn't matter (unless its very deep).  The
heat of a running engine will take care of it.

&gt; I've gotten a complete engine; a short block, two heads, 2 f.i. systems,
&gt; 2 intake manifolds, 2 complete set of gaskets, and more.  I have yet to
&gt; put on the head. The problem is that some rust has started on the top
&gt; and has edged down into a cylinder, not much and not very far.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the best way to deal with this stuff?  I dont want to make it
&gt; any worse.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.
