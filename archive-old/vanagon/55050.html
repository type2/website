Subject: Re: Prices and German vs. U.S  Eurovan


German EV may have two different wheelbases. Regularly the
short one is sold as Camping conversion. Long wheelbase are
also available. Dehler sells extended short and long
wheelbase conversions where the kitchen fits into the
extension.

The fridges works in same way, but different propane
connections and main power supply will be 230V.

Howdy.....

What are the diffrences between a US and german camper eurovan.

The dealer told me that the german on is shorter but by how much?
Do the fridges work differently?  One propane.

Anyway what do you think of these prices?
1995 EV with 66,ooo km for $30,000 cdn.
1995 EV with 25,000 km for 38,000 cdn
both automatic

These prices seem very high to me.

Please give your opinion!!!!

Thanks

Cpt. Chris
