Troops!

I'm back!

Actually, I somehow get dumped off lists whenever my server burps or
something, and a couple of months ago that happened with the vanagon list.
I was so busy that I savored only getting about 5 or 10 messages a day from
the other lists, but now I'm getting LONELY!

Also, I want to do a couple of things:  Thank you to Trace for sending me
the EV electrical diagrams.  Trace, that is going to be a great help in
sorting out my 93 EV woes, because the problem appears to still be with me
and the warranty on all but the powertrain has expired.  I asked at VW
about the Bently Manual, and it doesn't look like it's going to be
available any time soon, so I may be interested in sending you an actual
check to cover copying the rest of the pre-publication manual you might
have, if you're interested.

Saw a couple of fire trucks wiz by today while dropping my son off at
school.  Was alarmed because the smoke was coming from the direction to my
house.  Turned out to be a breadloaf completely gutted about a block
from my house.  I hate to see that, particularly since the cause is so
often the fuel line fitting to the carb that most list members probably
know about.

Also, just got the EV back from the body shop on Friday.  I'd just about
gotten home from a long drive to give a talk to the GATE kids at Del Norte
High, in Crescent City, where my sister teaches, when some guy in a
full-size Chevy pickup rear-ended my van in rush hour traffic.  I saw his
truck first after the accident, with the mangled bumper and dented hood and
grille, and figured I was in for a caved in rear door.  Much to my
surprise, the bumper brackets on the EV caused the damage to his bumper
(the EV tupperware bumper was cracked pretty bad), and the plastic thingy
over the door latch dented his hood!  Except for a tiny ding in the door,
there was no real damage to the EV body at all!  The body shop repainted
the door and replaced the latch cover anyway, plus the bumper, which wound
up costing 850 bucks.  Geez, I used to buy my buses for that!

Oh yeah, by the way:  While driving down the 101 south of Eureka, I saw a
&quot;real&quot; EV Westfalia.  Not a Winnie Bagoo or Weekender, but an actual
camper.  Not long wheelbase either, but apparently based on a delivery van
(no left rear window cutout).  Elderly couple was driving it.
