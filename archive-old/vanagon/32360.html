Well, the EV promo tapes are gone.  Thanks for playing.  I guess the
storm we've had here in New England and below has a few folks desperate
for a video, *any* video, to pass the time. Personally, I'd rather
shovel snow than watch this thing but hey, it's collectible.

Oh, and in case anyone was offended by my initial post where I said 
that my gut reaction to the Vanagon when it made its debut was one of
revulsion due to its &quot;un-buslike&quot; nature: I hope you gleaned that I have
since seen the light.  When VW squared off those beautiful rounded contours
of the old breadloaf and then went and stuck a *gasp* water-cooled engine
in the blasted thing a few years later -- well, that was just too much.  I
guess I was still reeling from the Rabbit replacing the Beetle (although
the Rabbit did kindle a bit of a revolution of its own in this country, as
I recall; it has the dubious distinction of spawning the proliferation of
&quot;econoboxes&quot; that plagued us for the next decade or so - a good idea gone
bad) .  Uh Oh.  Now I've expressed an Opinion.  Please don't hurt me.
