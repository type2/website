Some Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill NC list readers got together a while back
for pizza.  Well, let's do it again.....

Wednesday 11/1/95  6:30 pm
Meet in the parking lot of the Brightleaf Square complex, between Duke and
Gregson Streets in Durham.
Look for the busses in the lot.  Last time we had 6 busses show.  We were
able to park together and hang out doing our
most loved thing - looking at and talking about our obsessions.

We can hang out there a while and then walk to one of the many close
restaurants.
Bring friends, family, all welcome.
Email me if you need better directions.
