Subject: Re: hot vw won't start

...happens to me all the time on the freeway. don't even think about it much
anymore. crawl under the bus with a hammer and bang the solenoid a few
times. works like charm for me. scares the hell outta gas station
attendants though, the way i'm reaching for that 5 pound hammer when i pull
up...

            &gt; Subject:    hot vw won't start

&gt; a friend with another '80 Vanagon asked me about the following problem and
&gt; I didn't know the answer:
&gt;
&gt; when he first bought the van a couple of years ago, he found that when it
&gt; got really hot it would not start. eventually a local vw garage told him
&gt; that this was common in older vans, that the starter was the culprit, that
&gt; once it was fixed it wouldn't happen again for years, and so they replaced
&gt; the starter for him.
&gt;
&gt; well, this year it's doing it again. symptom is that the lights dim when he
&gt; engages the starter but there is no audible solenoid function, nor is there
&gt; any starter motor spin. if he lets is set awhile and tries it again, it
&gt; works fine.
&gt;
&gt; any ideas? I'd be happy to relay them on to him!
&gt;
&gt; TIA
