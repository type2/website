&gt;&gt;Mine did that, among other things. I found a hole in the little one-

&gt;    Thanks for the reply. However I am not aware of such a vacuum 
&gt;line on my bus. Would I have found it when I removed the engine? Is is 
&gt;possible that my '71 does not have one? and should it? Also, what is 
&gt;the purpose of this vacuum line? Sorry for all the questions, but I 
&gt;am now worried I may be missing something important.

If you look right under the carb, there should be a thickesh, cloth(?)
covered hose attached to the intake.  This is the vacuum hose they are
referring to.  Also, if you go under the vehicle and look at the power brake
servo and see a hose attached to it, this is the other end of the hose that
is attached to the intake.  The purpose of this hose is to provide vacuum for
the power brake servo.  If you have this, which you should, braking is easy.
:-) If you don't, braking is not. :-(.

Hope this helps!
