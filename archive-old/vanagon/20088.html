Subject: joel's lists...

...i can tell you REALLY like lists, joel...maybe an occupational hazard ???
anyways, you didn't have my city last time, and my 73 bus isn't just a bus,
it's the most beautiful white full poptop camper with handcrafted bookshelves
(yeah, i actually did them myself...head swelling with pride...) and the
inevitable (for a marine biologist in oregon, anyways...)colorful &quot;save the
whales&quot; curtains (...stapled, not sowed...copyright nicole apelian...). it
looked even more beautiful before i hit that elk on my way to eugene, but
that's a different story, one that involves a lot of bondo...
for now, here's the info for your next list (i'm sure you won't keep us
waiting too long...):
        Gregor Durstewitz
        73 poptop westy
        Email: gdurstew_at_oimb.uoregon_dot_edu
        city: Coos Bay
        next big city (by our standards here): Eugene
