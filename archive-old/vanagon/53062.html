Subject: Help needed from European Bretheren....


I want to put in a set of gauges in my EuroVan....I have a set of VDO gauges 
(oil pressure, oil temp and voltmeter) that I used to have in a Rabbit a few 
years ago. What I need is a gauge panel to put them in, preferably one that 
is made for the EuroVan, I want the &quot;built-in look&quot; as opposed to the 
&quot;tacked-on look&quot;.

Have any of you folks over there in Europe seen anything like this in your 
travels? If so, could you let me know.._dot_can we arrange for one to be shipped 
here?

Thanks in advance!

Ric
