Subject: Desperately seeking mechanical Vac-Advance

 Has anyone changed their Vacuum Advance on the Distributor to a
mechanical one as St. Muir suggests? If so, where can I procure one?
Will this change make any/much difference to my gas mileage? Does the
Bosche 009 come with a mech. advance? Thanks in Advance.
