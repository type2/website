Subject: What coolants are ok?

Hi!

Someone a couple of days ago asked what brands of coolant are cool for
Vanagons (&quot;phosphate-free&quot;).  If anyone answered, I missed it.

Yesterday I went to K-Mart and looked at Prestone (that's all they
had!).  I remember reading a month or two ago that someone was going
strong with Prestone.  Prestone was kind enough to list their
ingredients:  ethelyne glycol, water, and &quot;proprietary&quot; additives. 
Period.  No &quot;phosphate-free&quot; marker on the jug. . . .  No hint at the
formulation of their &quot;proprietary&quot; stuff.

I have been running on h2o alone for a month or two, since I burst a
hose during a creeping commute to the nation's capital.  Replacing the
coolant will be my first serious task on my new '87 GL.  I have the
Bentley manual. . . .  

Advice?  Ideas?  Thanks!!!
