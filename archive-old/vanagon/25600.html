Subject: Opportunity lost - I could cry!

I was driving to work this morning and low and behold I saw the nicest bus 
pulled over by a cop.  I believe was a '69 because the reflectors were round 
&amp; behind the wheel well (am I learning?). It was blue &amp; white and absolutely 
gorgeous.  No dents, no scrapes, and a beautiful shine on the paint.  AND it 
had a for sale sign in the rear drivers side window.  I had to drive within 
5 feet to pass and the interior was perfect (could only see the inside 
ceiling).  Even the hubcaps were shiny and new.  My inspection sticker 
expired July1 (oops!) and cannot afford ANOTHER ticket, not to mention I was 
already late for work.  A new law in Virginia (I heard ??) is that two 
tickets for the same violation more than 30 days apart can result in the 
second being doubled (sounds strange, but didn't want to risk it).  My 
exhaust is pretty thick and it will cost big $$$ to fix, so I'm putting it 
off as long as possible.  Anyway, there was an old man driving who must have 
been 100 years old.  No rust and even the handles and chrome around the 
headlights were perfect.  You woulda thought it was 1969 and he was driving 
it off the lot.  The for sale sign only said &quot;Runs perfectly - must sell - 
make offer&quot;.  BUT NO PHONE NUMBER!  It was like a nightmare that I couldn't 
wake from.  I plan on driving around the area, but God knows where he lives. 
 I have all of the latest car books and it is not listed in any.  Say a 
prayer for me!!!!!!!!!

Tearfully yours,
Paul Smiley
