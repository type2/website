Subject:      Re: Battery and Battery compartment

I was basically speaking of Automotive-type batteries in general.
Gel-cells I guess are the latest technology and I have yet to see one
around in the Northern California area, but then I don't own a boat or a
Class A RV and haven't had a need to shop at a marine store in 15 years
either.

Seems like I should be spending more time keeping up with technology
rather than enjoying life, eh?

Cheers :-)

&gt;wouldnt the optima gel cell battery be a truly maintenance free

&gt;It has no water inlets or reservoirs.
