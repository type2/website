Martha: I'll take a shot. First 80-81 had the three lever system; 82-83.5
got four levers because the fan (extra cost on the 80-81 according to FAQ
review) became standard equipment necessitating a breakdown between fresh
air and heat controls.The silly thing of course is that the fan is
good only for fresh air anyway. Whether ac is present is irrelevant.
Second if you are getting hot air all the time (move to Canada) there are two
possibilities: simple one: cables are maladjusted (probably a broken
family) meaning you will to have fix
them at the point of adjustment at the lever arms on both boxes. Complex
one: the orange floppy discs that are in essence the gatekeepers of heat, have
become broken and brittle with age (don't we all). Solution? Remove said
floppies and replace with new ones. This is easier said than done, because
VW will probably not sell the discs separately. Inserting them is also
difficult. But it can be done. Just visit your local wrecker and R and  R.
This will also give you the opportunity to lie under your van at length and
contemplate the grander things in life. DC
