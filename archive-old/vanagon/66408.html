I feel certain that this is the VC going bad, which it does very slowly over
time, and eventually will be full on all the time.

I feel almost certain this is not the diff lock or the CV joints or the diff
itself--that it is the VC. I have this same problem.

&gt;I have recently encountered a problem like this.  It has only happened
&gt;on long highway trips, over an hour.  When I pull off the highway into
&gt;say a gas station and turn sharply on pavement, it takes a lot of
&gt;throttle to make the vanagon move.  It feels the same as if I was
&gt;driving with the diff lock on.  It has only happend a few times.  I
&gt;have  tried engaging the diff lock and then disengaging again and it
&gt;went away.  Once I didn't do anything and it went away.
&gt;
&gt;Can the diff lock engage by itself?  Heat? Vacuum leak?  If the diff
&gt;lock is engaged without using the vacuum actuator, would the light on
&gt;the dash come on?  Mine doesn't, only when I pull the knob.
&gt;
&gt;I can feel the one of the rear tires dragging, so I am fairly sure it
&gt;isn't the VC.
