Subject: Re:Sliding Door Screens for Vanagon

I bought the screens for the driver/passenger they sell in JC Whitney. They
attach with magnets and work well when warm. (ie., magnets stick better).
Inclosed was the address of the company that makes them, they showed a
screen for the sliding door(Vanagon) so I called them up and order it..
Cloyce the owner on this small business, said she started make these
screens for the old VW Buses in later 60's-70's. Said first customers would
buy new VW buses and send them to Africa. The bugs (the crawling kind not
vw rolling kind!) were a problem, so Cloyce begin sewing screens for the
windows/doors and selling these to the VW safari duds, she said they would
sell the buses on the return trips!(Yearly) Anyways, I did not like the
magnet door screen (not a good seal) so I had Cloyce to custom make one.
The PO of my westy had tan or white velcro(soft side) around the sliding
door. They must have had a similar screen?. So I just had Cloyce sew in the
other side of the velcro to the netting, also had her install a 2-way full
length zipper. Works Great! I am going to have her sew in magnets at the
bottom which could make it prefect.(Will stick to metal strips that hold
down carpet) You can tie open the screen and never have to remove
it.(Velcro tie backs) Left mine up the whole time diving out west still
room to get in and out.But after see there were no bugs, simple remove it
and store in under the pop-top along with the diver/passenger screens. And
Cloyce repaired my screen for the roof vent.(Excellent Job).Good woman,
give her a call.
Sliding door screen $51.86  front windows(2) $34.95
