Steve spoke of the Rootes Group/260/289CID Ford/ Tigers.

It was BRG, it was Minilites, it was hard top, it was 289 fire breathing cubes
of sheer street terror, sure, you had to change the back two plugs from the
cockpit through a door in the transmission tunnel but this was no pussycat.

1967 Sunbeam Tiger/  certified vette killer/ Hallibrand QC /Hurst /2-4BBl /289CI
AC-Ford Cobra motor/ overheats in traffic, no airconditioning, walnut dash, 
nardi, traction masters, goodyear bluestreaks ... $4000/bo ...

of course that was 1974.  I'd easily swap the sinkro for the same car today.

The hallibrand qc was because the standard sunbeam beefed up r&amp;p would't hold
up to the 289 torque.

Shoulda never sold it.
