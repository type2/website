Subject: Christmas break

Hey all,
On Sunday, 12/15, I officially begin Christmas break, so I'll be
unsubbing from v_at_l and type2.  I don't know if I'll subscribe from my
Mom's account (staying with the folks) but I will if I can.  If anyone
needs to reach me, mail me at lbart_at_preferred_dot_com .  That's my mom's
e-mail account, so put &quot;for Sean&quot; or something in the subject so she
knows it's for me.  I move back into my dorm on January 14th, so I have
about a month off.  I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at Tom
Forhan's party Sunday afternoon.  

Take care everybody,
Sean
