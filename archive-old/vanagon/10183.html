&gt;&gt;  this true.  if so would customs inspect a brazilian bus as a 1995 or a a 1975
&gt;&gt;  (if those are the specs they are made to).

&gt;To import an automobile into the US, it must meet the US standards 
&gt;as of the date the automobile was manufactured, not designed. Alas, the 
&gt;Brazilian busses are not importable, without *major* mods.  Some will be 
&gt;impossible.  Finding &quot;DOT&quot; lenses for the lights might be possible if 
&gt;they really did reuse the mid-70's fixtures, but installing 1995 site 
&gt;impact protection (and certifying it by crashing a couple of vans) and 
&gt;getting an airbag system installed would drive the cost *way* beyond 
&gt;reality.  I looked into this back a bit when I lusted after an East 
&gt;German &quot;Carboard Car&quot;.  Even getting a cerifiable manufacture date proved 
&gt;impossible.  If you want a car that was manufactured outside the US and 
&gt;it was not on the road by Jan 1, 1968, and the owner does not have good 
&gt;records, you are setting yourself up for major heartbreak.  Even with 
&gt;all the record, it will still cost a minimum of ~$1500 for certification 
&gt;through one of the few DOT licensed importers.

It must be possible somehow.  MOFOCO here in Milwaukee has three (at least,
that's how many I saw, they may have more for all I know) white double cab
brazilian made late eighties pickups.  They don't have license plates, nor
do they have VIN's as far as I could tell.  They are parked out in the lot
during the day, and driven inside the garage overnight.  I was there when
they were moving them and they sound great!!!
