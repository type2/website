&gt; Here's a little mystery.  Otto, the 79 Bus (50,000 on a rebuilt 2000,
&gt; 161,000 mi. total, completely stock) has, for reasons known only unto
&gt; himself, started getting getting 19-20 MPG in combined driving, and 21-23 on
&gt; the highway.  This has been consistent now for over a month.  I've not done
&gt; anything, mechanical or otherwise, except putting in a new battery 2 weeks
&gt; ago.  Ever since I bought this Bus, the gas mileage has been 16-17 combined
&gt; and 18 or 19 on trips.  These figures are based on reality, as I keep track
&gt; of the mpg's with each fill-up.  I'm not complaining, but this seems a
&gt; little weird.  

Could be carbon buildup on the pistons.  When this happens, your compression
ratio goes up, and mileage should go up too since the engine is more
efficient.  Drawbacks are the possibility of pinging and &quot;dieseling&quot; when
you shut off the motor.  Have you noticed those symptoms?  Come to think
of it, is dieseling even possible with fuel injection?
