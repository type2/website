I gave my old vinyl sunroof cover (which was in good shape except for a
couple of small tears) to this guy I know with a '63 23-window.  He
paid $200 for it, but that was prolly too much...  This thing has
midwest-style rust on it - floors are just about completely gone, parts
of the skylight window frames are gone...  He was very grateful; he has
a shower curtain over the sunroof now...

geez, I wouldnt mind finding a $200 23 window....
   but I hope that guy isnt DRIVING the thing.  You know those sub floors on
buses with sunroofs and on vans with cargo doors on both sides?  They are
there to provide structural support to make up for the lack of strength
because of the d*** big hole in the roof (or side).   If the floor, and
probably frame too, from the sound of it,are seriously rusted ,  the bus will
sway and sag and warp and flex.  (This i've seen)   In a crash, it'll just
mush.  It could break in two.   It could collapse into a pile of dust and
leave someone sitting on their butt in the road.
  It could make a good greenhouse, though.

Ive seen buses with sunroof tops put on cus someone wants a 21 window or
dormobile.  (Id like a dormobile, too. ) Not a good idea without also adding
sub floor pans, available from Das Bulli Haus.   I am not associated with.
