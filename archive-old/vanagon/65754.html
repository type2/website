Listees,

  I have a NEW White, still in the box Power Mirror!

  I was hoping when I saw the post for one it would be a Drivers side,
It's not.

  Maybe the fact that the passenger side mirror is so far away from the
driver we forget it and hit things with it?

  Either way, I have this mirror and would like to sell it for $175.00
to someone that needs it.  A new one from the Dealer is in the $250.00
range.

  Interested parties p-mail me.

  Kyle
