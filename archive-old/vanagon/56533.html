&gt; 
&gt; I've never heard of an Eberspacher control panel mounted there. Are you sure
&gt; it's an Eberspacher??
&gt; 
&gt; Gas heaters on wasserboxer vanagons are extremely rare to begin with.
&gt; Especially on one as new as a '89.
&gt; 
 Hi all:  Are Eberspacher gas heaters the only ones found on Vanagons
from the factory? I have come into possession of a complete Gas heater
from a aircooled Vanagon. It is flat and apears to be made of stainless.
I have never seen one before and am not sure what kind it is.
