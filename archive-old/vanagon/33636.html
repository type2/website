Subject: Allen Screws, Cleaner &amp; '62 Crew Cab FS

Following the thread about stolen parts, I noticed the mention of ground down
cap screws to look like phillips, round head screws.  Just thought I'd mention
that allen, round head screws are available (we use the American threaded
version at work) and they are quite pleasing aesthetically.

As for pouring anything down the drain that has had greasy parts dipped in it
(per the drain cleaner parts dip thread), I would think twice about it,
particularly if your house has a septic system, and especially if your septic is
near a mountain stream (yeah, I know not many folks out there live in the
redwoods with a creek in their backyard).  Just my $.02 worth, and an attempt at
karmic repair for the old oil I poured into the ground in my misguided youth.

Finally, seen in &quot;The Great Exchange&quot;, Santa Cruz, January 23 issue date, 1962
VW Crew Cab
excellent running condition, power disk brakes
$2,500 (408) 338-9597
Don't have any association with this guy or the paper, and have no knowledge of
this particular truck, unless it is the one I saw at the Vallejo show last
spring.  I talked to this guy in Boulder Creek some time ago, and if this is the
same truck, it has a strong (1776, I believe) engine, is used daily as a work
truck, and though a little ragged, is in fairly decent shape.  All disclaimers
apply.

Also in same paper:
'71 VW Van, strong eng., new brakes, head liner, upholstery, valves, clutch,
front bench seat, $2,000. (408)429-0180.

'71 VW Camper, 10K on rebuilt engine, excellent condition, new brakes, clutch,
sunroof, Blaupunkt CD w/detachable face, and more.  $3,700 (408) 438-3262
(6-9PM)

'76 VW Van, excellent condition, new engine, clutch, shocks.  Ready to travel.
$2,800 (408) 429-8343

'80 VW Vanagon, 30K miles on rebuilt engine, all receipts, must sell, needs
work. $1,500 (408) 423-1810

Eat your hearts out in the Rust Belt, these are all in the Santa Cruz, CA area,
and as such are probably metallically intact.  Once again, all disclaimers
apply.

peace,
