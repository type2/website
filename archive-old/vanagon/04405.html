&gt; 	l
&gt; 	But, Frankly, Wolfsburg designed some real pieces-o-shit starting around
&gt; 	'72. The designs that were once conducive to fix-it-yourself, were  
&gt; 	getting pretty unfriendly. I wouldn't own a bus from 72 &gt; 78. And that
&gt; 	Type IV. Gawd! 

      Let me ask you this and keep in mind the same time frame.  What would
      have been a substitute for the VW camper or bus for that matter for 
      the same amount of money paid?  It's easy to kick around the design
      until you try to find something else that will fit the same bill.

&gt; 
&gt; 	As I wrote a couple days ago, they've both praised the V6 Passat and 
&gt; 	the new Jetta.

         These are cars not RV's or buses by any stretch.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I also feel that they give mis-information on other cars too.  Esplecially
&gt; 
&gt; 	Misinformation? Or just an opinion different than yours?


   By misinformation, I mean that they really don't like to get to the
   real problem alot unless it falls within a common area they feel
   comfortable with (and they do humorously admit this from time to
   time).  I do like the show but I hate when they tell someone to get
   rid of a car for a new one instead of explaining that for much less
   than a new car they can have have their car repaired for much less 
   and still get alot of mile out of it.  They do this all of the time.
   It seems to me that they give up to easily on a used car. 

&gt; &gt; definately under-rated.  IMO, they just don't know how to work on
&gt; &gt; VWs and so they bad-mouth it instead.
&gt; 
&gt; 	My sense is that one reason they groan about VWs is that they DO know
&gt; 	how to work on them and they know lots of them stunk. My attitude
&gt; 	about VW is: The bug was neat for its' time and great for poor folk
&gt; 	or folk that like to fix-it, but it was a major polluter. Some of
&gt; 	the busses were good for there time, and some stunk. The camper is
&gt; 	unique and is responsible for lots of the romance attached to VWs.
&gt; 	Apart from the camper, I wouldn't have purchased a VW until the
&gt; 	intro of the Passat.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'd love a Passat or the new Cabrio!
&gt;

        Gee, no bias here???   
	Sounds like you don't like to get your hands greasy either.  I
	freely admit that VW has some design problems, but I really think
	you have to look at what else is available before you close the
	door on the VW.  I'm a little confused, you say the some campers
	stunk and yet the camper is one that you would choose?  Make up
	my mind.  How can you say some stunk and others didn't when the
	design has been basically the same throughout till the front
	engines came along.  Dasher! Yuck!  And show me a comparable 
	vehicle that I can go camping in for the same amount of comfort
	and utility as my '91 GL.
