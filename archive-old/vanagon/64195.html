Subject: Brushbars for vanagons

Any suggestions for suppliers of brushbars for vanagons? I totalled my
last Vanagon after hitting a deer. (Not to mention my teeth and fingers)
A brushbar may offer some marginal level of protection. Ive seen photos
on the net of some bars on Tri Stars. Any ideas? Thanks, Steve
