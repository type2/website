Subject: Need help NOW, R&amp;R Water Pump

Can anyone help? Does the triple pully on the crank, center of the 
engin, have to be removed to replace the water pump?

My engin is in pieces on the garage floor, have been up almost all last 
night tearing down to replace the water pump (am in a time crunch, need 
to be on the road today for work), and cannot get the pully off. If any 
one has done this please respond. Is there another way to remove pump? 
Or, what is the trick getting the pully off?

TIA
