My creative writing and tech writing classes taught me that you should
always write for a 6th grade level.  If you require people to think about
how, rather than what, you are saying they will lose interest. A failed
work neither informs nor entertains.  Please separate the poor writing
from the reading level required.  Now I haven't bothered to spell or
grammar check this piece but you'll find that it only requires about a 6th
grade education to understand. 

Reminds me of an argument between my mom and dad:

Dad - I only read the articles, honest!

Mom's response is unprintable and should be obvious anyway!
