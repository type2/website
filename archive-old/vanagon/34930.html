Subject:       Car Quest.  the worst

I hope some of you out there have good luck with car quest but the 
one around here was the worst parts place i ever went to.  they 
consistently gave me the wrong information and their parts were 
always inferior.  i bought a set of shocks from them and they only 
lasted 8months.  i can't tell you how many times i ended up returning 
the part that they SWORE was the right one.  one time i ended up 
dumping all my trans fluid on the ground in their parking lot cause 
they told me i could remove the modulator with out any problems.  the 
only reason i had to remove the thing in the first place was cause 
they couldn't figure out which one it was.  Those people were so 
DUMB!  i eventually got fed up and never went back.  calling them up 
and asking for a part that didn't exist was always a lot of fun.  
they would spend so much time searching and some times even give me a 
part number and a price.  I know it's rude but with some people you 
just can't help it.   the local one is finally out of buisness (real 
surprising) and i havn't had the guts to go to another Car Quest but 
i suggest being carefull if buying from that chain.
Ed.
