Subject: Re: Brochures from Westfalia and Dometic Fridge question

&gt; Also, some one was having problems with their fridge. 

&gt;  i have always had problemn  the vehicle is moving.  

&gt; Someone said that this might be due to a leak?

&gt; The rubber on the outside fluvent also smells like it is

&gt;  burning after a couple hours. 

&gt;  Any assistance would be great.



If you're running the fridge on propane when the vehicle is moving you 
may very well be having combustion problems.  This can be caused by 
excessive drafting at the exhaust flue due to wind pressure effects of 
the moving vehicle or due so slugging the regulator with liguid propane 
from the vehicle motion.  My advice is put it on battery power, 
particularly if you're going very far or fast.  I ignored this for the 
first couple of years I had my '91 Westy and the resultant combustion 
problems finally ended up fouling up my burner, requiring a fairly 
expensive repair (covered by warranty, fortunately).
