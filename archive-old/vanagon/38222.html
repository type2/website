Ok, to establish a value, we gotta know a few things, primarily condition,
secondarily options:

Rusty ? How bad; : good
(in a C mood today)

Collision damage?

All the pieces? Windows, (orginal?) lights, baubles, clock, etc. 

Interior?  Door panels, headliner, carpet, seats.

Paint?  Original or primer or somewhere in-between?

Any cool gizmos like gas heater, safaris, steering column lock,
