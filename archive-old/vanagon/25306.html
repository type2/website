Subject: re:Bus as primary residence...

I lived on the streets of Cambridge for three weeks in 1975 when my 
primaryresidence was my 66 camper.  This was in february and the day after I 
parked and found a temp job in a furniture store just off the Boston 
Common it snowed.  The plows heaped up snow around the bus and my 
footsteps were patently obvious.  It got down into single digits a couple 
times, and was routinely in the teens.  I put my dried beans in water in 
the pot and put them in the icebox to keep them from freezing.  I used a 
Bluet stove to cook/heat at night.  Ballantine Ale also kept me warm.  

After saving enough money to make it back to California I lost my 
generator and had to stop in Allicance,OH to wire a friend for more 
money.  I spent two nights in a used VW car lot there.  I didn't make it 
to California by the way, and spent nine months in Kansas City.  Three 
months of living in the bus was enough.  It was the wrong time of year.  
What we don't do for love, another level of the story...
