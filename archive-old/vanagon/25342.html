Subject:      Changing From One Van to Another

After driving a '63 VW Kombi for the last 23 years, this June I bought
a '77 VW Westy. I've noticed a few differences.

1. Bigger: One piece windshield is big. I can't reach comfortably
over to the passenger's window and slide it open. More headroom for
driver. There's more room in back but the cabinetry gets in the way
of sticking my bikes in there easily. Now need 80&quot; clearance in
parking garages, rather than 75&quot;.

2. Faster: I'm something like the guy who wanted his speedo tested,
cuz everybody was passing him. I get up to a 'comfortable' speed
like in the '63, people still pass and tailgate like in the '63, but
the speedo shows 5 mph faster.

3. More Power: I don't have to hold the pedal to the metal as much.
I can cruise on the highway at speeds that seemed near the limit in
the '63, but I can still bog down on a hill. I want to install a tach
so I can manage the revs a bit better. (Trying to figure how to mount
a VDO 3 1/8 inch tach under dash where clock would go.)

4. Economy: Gas mileage may be better in the '77. I averaged 19.7 mpg
in the '63 with a '69 1600 (30 PICT-1), and 20.2 mpg so far in '77
with 2L T4 FI. (1 Imperial Gallon = 1.201 U.S. Gallons) (Last fill up
was $.595 CDN/Liter or $1.70 US/American Gallon if my conversion is
correct.)

5. More 'Features': Backup Lights! Open the front doors and a light
comes on! Two speed windshield wipers! Disk brakes on front!  Fuel
injection! It's nice to have all these 'new' features, but it isn't
going to be as easy to work on as the '63.

6. Handling Different: At first it seemed there was more sway in the
'77, cuz I'd get out of shape going around corners. However, I'm
learning to judge my speed better so I don't provoke strange behaviour.
(Tires are new Michelin XLTs, so they aren't the problem.)

7. Better Visibility All Round: The PO installed truck side view
mirrors both sides with wide angle mirrors as well. They must cut into
the gas mileage, but I like them anyway, except for not being able to
open the quarter panel windows more than a crack. I use these on the
'63 as cheap air conditioners. Bigger side and rear windows let me see
cars sneaking up behind.

8. New Problems: I've got the 'gas fumes when turning left with full
tank' syndrome. I don't mind the barn doors on the '63 at all. They
aren't as heavy, as noisy, or as complicated as the sliding door, and
I haven't figured how to lube the sliding door yet. Fridge doesn't work
and sink tap leaks at base.
