Subject: Gas mileage

Here we go with my THIRD (and last) post of the day, and hopefully of
the week:

My '87 Westy, 2.1 L wasserboxer engine, is getting only 17 mpg
highway.  That seems low to me.  Is it typical for the rest of you
guys with vans of similar age and equipment?

One contributing factor might be that it has the wrong tires --
205/70R14 car tires, max load 1400 pounds.  It should have light-truck
tires, like the ones it was shipped with.  And having the wrong tires
often means lousy gas mileage.
