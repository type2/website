Subject: bodega update


Here's the updated personnel list for Bodega Dunes, June 2-4th.  We 
desparately still need more sign ups for the potluck items (see below).  Also, 
it will be VERY helpful if we know when you plan to arrive, and with whom 
you'll be sharing a campsite (pertains to people in the second section).  The 
two evening meals (Friday and Saturday) are potluck, as well as the two 
breakfasts (Saturday and Sunday).  Utensils, serving things, pots, lunch, and 
booze is all bring-yer-own.  

Still needed:  a BBQ volunteer, and maybe an ice-cream maker?

--&gt;IMPORTANT NOTICE:  I STRONGLY urge that one person in the paired groups 
(either already formed, or yet to be formed) get a reservation thru mistix.  
This will insure positive space, and without it, you may be camping in the next 
county at this time of year, and on a weekend  :(
