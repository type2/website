&gt; Onward into the heat.  Ponderously, across the desert until we arrived
&gt; in Phoenix during rush hour.  By now I am having alternating mood
&gt; swings about the Vanagon.  I have driven it more at 100+ temperatures
&gt; in this one day than ever before in its 150000 mile lifetime.  It 
&gt; appeared to be holding up, except the second stage fan was coming on 
&gt; more and more.  What about the rebuilt heads?  Will the head gasket
&gt; hold up?  Am I burning more oil than usual?  Is the coolant level
&gt; still OK?
	
	Ah yes, the romantic part of driving a hi-mileage VW...

	Ya know, if you were rolling down the freeway in a hi-mileage
	Detroit van, you'd probably not fret as much because you know
	the engines are oversized and not as suseptible to heat/oil
	trouble.

	We VW folks suffer from VW owners anxiety because we fear
	failure away from home will be a major interrupt in our lives
	as noone within 500 miles knows shit about those weird opposed
	piston things.

	You're a good writer.
