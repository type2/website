Subject: Parts stripping - mystery parts

Well, the '79 is history.  The stripping went swimmingly with a passel of
vanatics in attendance.  I hope some of the other (more literary)
participants will review it when they get home.  In the mean time, someone
asked for the panels.  I stripped all of them, but cannot find the message
requesting them.  Would someone like to step forward and claim them?  (The
previous claimant would be preferred, but if I see no hand soon, any
claimant will do).
