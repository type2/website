&gt; Count me in.  I too have been envious of the west-coasters and their trip
&gt; planning.  If my 67 Samba has sold by the spring I definately will have a
&gt; bus to camp in as a replacement.

Hey, I don't remember seeing the 'Samba' name for a T2 VW.  Can you educate
me on what it is and why it's called a Samba?
