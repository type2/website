Hi,
	I got a couple of requests for information about the motion sensor
security system so I am posting the info here.  The system is called
&quot;Wireless Driveway/Entrance alert system&quot; and costs $149 with 10% off if
you are a member of Damark's president club which I am.  That makes the
price $134.99.  Here's what the blurb says:

&quot;You'll know instantly when someone's coming in your driveway, without
risking your safety or interrupting your activities.  Installation is
easy.  Just put a battery (not included) in the transmitter and mount it
to overlook the area you want monitored.  Then plug the receiver into a
wall outlet in an area you frequent like your kitchen or living room.
When the transmitter's motion sensor [my mistake, I thought it was an
invisible beam] detects movement from a person or vehicle, it sends a
beeping signal to the receiver.  And in case you didn't hear the beep,
LED lights let you know something has activated it.  You can also use it
for additional security around swimming pools, garages, walkways, and
many other areas.  Transmits up to 200 feet away.  Made in the USA.&quot;

Item # B-5553-394455 Shipping/Handling $6.99

There is also a solar powered motion-activated security light for $69.
Those seems to be quite popular here in San Diego.

My only concern about both of these systems is that cats and such may
set them off.  With the light, that's not a big deal.
