&gt; Short of that, do any of you have some bonafide insight in obtaining
&gt; a Vanagon Crew?

VW STREET ART!

Last summer at the Bug Fest in Scarborough in Toronto there was a double
door TriStar transporter with under 50 kms on it. Yes, I said under 50
kms! It was flat bedded to the show. The contest required that all
vehicles be driven in to the judgement area. I swear that the owner
backed out afterward so that no kms would show on his odo. 

WHATS THE POINT? WHAT A WASTE!
