Subject: FS: 1.9L Wasserboxer engine

I sent in a message on this a month or two ago, this is an expansion 
in order to answer as many potential questions as possible...

I have a 1.9L wasserboxer engine that I replaced in my '85 camper.  I 
replaced the engine, clutch and gas tank as a last ditch effort 
(still ongoing and yet to be recounted in a mailing list novelette) 
to get my car running and save face in front of my wife.  Before I 
replaced the engine I had bought new heads for it and drove it for 
less than 500 miles.  After replacing the engine, clutch and tank, I 
suspect that the main source of all my troubles was the gas tank 
(rusted).  Anyway, I think the engine is in decent shape, certainly a 
great rebuild candidate.  

Asking  $1100 (obo),  Details follow:

1.9L Water-cooled engine (longblock)  out of '85 Vanagon GL camper
Located in Emerald Isle, NC (Zip 28594)
New heads
No accessories are attached (water pump, alternator, etc.)
There were approx 70,000 miles on the engine
It didn't leak oil or water that I could see.
