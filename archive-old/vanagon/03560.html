&gt;Is there a simple way to remove those 'theft-proof' VW radios without
&gt;damaging the dash or radio (and without the 'secret' factory too&gt;?  I've
&gt;got a '91 Westphalia and I want to tap into the antenna line to allow
&gt;attachment of a marine band scanner to allow monitoring fishing vessels
&gt;during a west coast trip next week.  I've meant to due this for a while
&gt;now - it worked great with my 82 (easy to pull radio).

the 'trick' is those four little holes, one at each corner. get some coat
hanger wire and clip off about 4-6 inches. then stick one piece in each
hole. then squeeze the two holes on each side toward each other, and pull
easy on the wires ... that should let the radio slide out toward you.

but, as i recall, you'll still have to disconnect the wiring (i went through
the ashtray hole) to take it out. and that means you need to know the theft
code (if you ever changed it ... i didn't, so i don't have to do all that
crap. who wants a vanagon radio?)
