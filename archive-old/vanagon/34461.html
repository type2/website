       &gt;This thing has A/C which the owner claims works.  I will test

       &gt;both A/C and heat hooked up at same time.  I'm not real clear on
       &gt;what he means, but I'll ask him next time I'm there.  Any air
       &gt;condition bus owners out there know what I'm talking about?  If
       &gt;this tube exists, how hard is it to get a replacement (he says
       &gt;the one he has is trashed).
My '79 had airconditioning, the AC unit ran from the compressor to a
condensor under the bus to 2 blowers in front of each front seat.
Everything was separate from the heating system.  There is a sticker on
the rear of the bus that says DPD Airconditioning.  If yours is the
same, you should have 2 separate systems (heat/AC) if it different sorry
for the wasted bandwidth.  BTW, I have disconnected the AC, and will be
removing all of the components except the blowers.  The PO had a line
break, and all the freon exited the system, and thus the compressor
died, as well as other pieces that rely on the freon.  Too much cost for
me to refurbish the system, for too little reward. IMHO of course.

       &gt;Big chrome VW for front.  Also needs one.  How hard are these to
       &gt;get and how much?  Probably can find these at VW shows.

Austin VeeDub has them for late model busses(baywindows), and I believe
early busses(splits). I paid $15 for mine, I don't have their number
handy, but they do have an 800 # if you are outside of the Austin, Tx
area.  These are used of course. You can call 800-555-1212 to get their
number.

Now I have a question:

I am going to get a spare tire mount for the front of my bus.  What I
would like to do is get one of those plastic(fiberglass?) covers to
mount my VW logo on.  The only thing is I have never looked at one of
these covers in any detail.  Would these work, or do they have a special
mounting bracket that would not work on VW busses? Enquiring minds want
to know

With all of the VW's here in Austin, I expected to see at least one that
did not like the sudden change in weather, but as is the norm, no VWs
were abandonded on the side of the road.  Mine turned over only 3 times
before it caught.

Cheers (from frigid Texas - today's high was a tropical 25*f)
