For the Yo trip...

There's a group camp available.  

The Weekend before Memorial Day is mucho better or maybe two weeks.

Snow in the valley in late April is damn rare.

Brunch at the Ahwanee is not so damn rare and can be well done.

The earlier the better as the crowding factor sets in earlier and earlier
each year.

SR120 Tioga Pass WILL MORE THAN LIKELY be closed until mid June.

The valley is ~3500ASL

The falls should be OUTSTANDING!

The roof is repaired.
