&gt;Your comment about Cofap going out of the VW piston/liner bussiness just about 
&gt; gave me a heart attack since I was going to rebuild a 1800cc this winter 
&gt; sometime.  I checked with my part supplier (Bow-wow parts in Surrey BC Canada 
&gt; 1-800-663-6822) and they have lots of Cofap piston/liners sets.  His supplier 
&gt; gets them directly out of Brazil. 

Lucky you.  ;)  My parts guy said they are no longer importing them to
the US the way they were, whatever that was.  Apparently they can still
be had here in some roundabout way, but they are expensive.  Every place
I called had raised their price at least $100, or no longer carried
them.  Keep in mind that this might only apply to 2-liter pistons/liners.  
I didn't ask about the 1.8 or 1.7 sets.  Hmmm... I guess I didn't make
that clear in my initial post - sorry about that.  Don't want any fellow
listmembers winding up in the emergency room!
