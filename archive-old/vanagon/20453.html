Subject: John Muir.  Again.



                          More On Muir

I got this one second hand but confirmed it (see page 85 of the
February 1979 edition of the Idiot book)... sez: &quot;...be sure to
get a 6v sensor if your car is 6 volt and a twelve volt sensor
for a 12 volt system.&quot;

John's talking about the oil pressure sensor.  John is full of hot air.

Folks, the oil pressure sensor is a Normally Closed, pressure
actuated SWITCH.  Voltage got nothing to do with it.  Pump about
seven pounds of pressure in the orifice, the switch opens,
anything less, it's closed.  When it's closed it completes the
oil pressure warning light circuit by connecting the signal lamp
to ground.  When the switch is open, the light is off.  It's the
second simplist part on a veedub (The old-style horn button is
first.)

Here's the story:  I'm working on a bug, need a part, go to the
local parts-place.  Chatting with the clerk, who I've known for a
few years, he mentions that some Volkswagen owners are more than
a little strange... and he wishes he'd never heard of John Muir. 
Why?  Glad you asked.

It seems that earlier that day a fellow comes in with a failed
pressure sensor; the diaphragm was leaking.  Insists on a six
volt model.  The counter guy isn't sure if he's serious or not;
parts-manual sez &quot;49 thru 82&quot; or some such; one size fits all. 
But the customer isn't about to fall for that trick.  He's got
St. Muir's bible and it sez exactly what I posted above; 6 volt
sensor for six volt system.  It also implies that parts-guys will
sell you a bad one now and then (see the preceding paragraph on
page 85).  The parts-guy shows him the book but the guy with the
leaky sensor sez a few unkind and unjustified things about the
parts-guy and goes off in a huff.

I got my parts, headed back for the shop.  Outside the parts-
place a Mexican kid was selling flowers, nice ones.  Bought a
bunch in a little pink plastic vase, took them back in and gave
them to the parts-guy.  Told him he was right.  All Volkswagen
owners are a little strange.  But we couldn't get along without
somebody to sell us parts now and then.
