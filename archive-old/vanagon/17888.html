Subject: Re: Oh no! Another one!

On Thursday I did not have the time to reply but,

I just wanted to mention that future problems might be created by just
replacing the front skin without inspecting for and repairing any damage
that might have been done to the substucture behind the skin. My wife and I
have had our '67 Westy Rresto from h**l in the body shop since OJ was just
an old ex-football legend (really). The bus that we bought was &quot;rust free
Dude, I swear&quot; and had a great front skin on it. As we have SLOWLY
progressed through body shop hell we discovered that the bus had been hit in
the front and apparently skinned without having the front frame pulled out.
The resulting problems were smashed vertical heater tube, slightly buckled
center front floor, smashed horizontal heater tube just below the front
center floor, and sprung front doors. As you can imagine, it$ taken u$
$eriou$ effort and other factor$ to correct the problem without taking the
$kin off and pulling the front clip the way that it $hould have been done
the fir$t time. If you are going to replace the skin on your bus, it is
HIGHLY recommended that you take the time to put it on a rack (if
necessary)and not &quot;cheap out.&quot; I'm not calling you cheap- point is that you
could potentailly save money in the long run by doing the repair right.
Granted, if the bus is just gonna be an OK looking but not perfect resto
then do what seems reasonable. Check the alignment and operation of the
doors, pedals,heater tubes,floor,front end suspension unit and angle of the
steering wheel before making the decision.

***IMPORTANT-SAFTEY ISSUE***
BTW: The frame was cracked all the way around the steering box and was only
discovered because we tore the bus down to the nitty-gritty. The crack was
not visible untill we removed the steering box. Even though the skin looked
perfect we could have gotten into a potentially serious situation if we had
just bought the bus as a thrasher and drove it as it was!! If your skin just
has a little damage (1-4 mph vs 5-25 mph+ wreck)it would be a word to the
wise to double check this area. 
GOOD LUCK! :)

&gt;&gt;The only other bad thing is a nasty spare-tire sized dent in the nose,
where &gt;&gt;someone left it in gear, and it smacked a wall with the mounted
spare tire.
&gt;&gt;  Soooooooooo, I guess my first question is, what's the best way to pull
&gt;&gt;such a dent? Although the bus came with an extra nose, welding that on
&gt;&gt;seems to be a tremendous project, for which I don't think I'm ready.
