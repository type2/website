Hello all,
Has any one ever run into any kind of table made to fit between the
front seats of a Vanagon.  In my travels to and from work (about 45
min.) it'd be nice to have a notebook there or even a 'puter.  (Flame
prevention:  no, not for going 70 MPH, but for those lovely L.A. freeway
drives, more on the brake than the gas.)

Thanks

Scott
