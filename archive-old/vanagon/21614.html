Subject: Bay Area Space needed to pull engine

Greetings all,

I have a problem. I need to pull my engine to get at my gas tank which is
leaking and full of crud/clogging up. I was wondering if anyone on the list
had a spot I could use for a weekend to do the work. I live in San
Francisco and park on the street, so I'm in a bit of a bind.

I don't think it would take more than a weekend, and I could probably use
some help/encouragment.

I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm hoping someone will be willing to help me
out.
Thanks in advance.
Ken
