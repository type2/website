Subject: Help me please, oil pressure

Any knowledge of oil pressure sensor problems?  When the engine warms up
to operating temperature, the oil presure light goes on when i slow down
from above 2000 rpm.  as soon as it goes to 2000 rpm the oil light goes
on and won't shut off till i go above the 2000 rpm.  could i not be
getting correct oil pressure at the lower rpm, or do you think the
switch is bad (high one or low one)  any help would be appreciated.
