Rudy-

Since the last mechanic mentioned that it appeared that the puter was
getting a signal that something was hot, have you switched the coolant
temp. sensor to the puter?  I really don't know how the 80's are set up,
but mine experienced similar problems and the LAST thing I swapped was
this sensor.  It has worked fine since then.  Although, a number of
various parts improved things (such as air intake boot, vacuum lines,
spark wires, etc), this sensor was the final cure.  On my 87, it cost
$12 and I could easily replace it myself (with instructions from the
list!).  I've been told that on earlier models (i.e. 84-85) this sensor
costs around $40.

Mine would lose power after travelling about an hour.  It would cut in
and out, coughing and sputtering, as it proceeded to die.  Although it
usually would idle (roughly) on the shoulder, it just didn't want to
go.  I never had the engine actually kill (except when I had the vacuum
leaks) during these episodes.  But it sure wasn't going anywhere until I
let it stop and cool off.

&gt;From my experience, I really don't think it's the computer (good
thing--they ARE expensive).  It think it's like the mechanic said--the
computer is getting faulty signals.  You can't blame the puter on that,
a brand spanking new one would react to faulty signals the same way!
