Subject: Rear view mirror disintegrating

I have an '85 Vanagon GL. The plastic on the back of the rear view
mirror is just crumbling away. I have two questions:

1. Does  anyone know how to replace the mirror?  I see no screws for
removal.

2. Does anyone know where I can find a replacement?  The color is brown.

Thanks in advance.
