Subject: Re: spark plug orientation affects performance?

&gt; I read somewhere that it may be advantageous to install spark plugs
&gt; so that their open end faces the intake valve.  This can be achieved
&gt; with the help of washers. This is to prevent the spark from occuring
&gt; in the shadow created by the electrode. Comments?

    Isn't that referred as &quot;degreeing the spark plug&quot;?  I have heard
    of this being done in racing engines.

Some marine engines use a plug with no electrode 'arm' - simply a 
centre anode (or is it electrode?) surrounded by a gap, then a 
circular electrode. Like shaving the arm off a regular plug, then 
grinding the centre post flush. I imagine the combustion chamber has 
to be designed for this, though. I'm not sure of the main reason for 
this, altough I expect longevity is one of them.
