I just went through this myself.  I went to a local Hub Cap Annie store and 
the guy gave my $30 off the $60 purchase price of a full set of generic wheel 
covers when I turned over my three remaining VW wheel covers.  I think the 
generic replacement covers look better than the original equipment.  If you
want to go original, West Coast Metric has the best price I could find.  
VW wants $71 each and I think the WCM catalog listed them for $56 each.
If you want just the chrome hub cap, WCM had them as well for around $8 each.
