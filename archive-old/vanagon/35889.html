&gt;I thought about my problem a bit more.  Let me explain.  When going at
&gt;slow speeds or in reverse (really noticable) the steering wheel goes back
&gt;and forth about 3/8 of an inch.  I was thinking of something more
&gt;expensive?!!!  What if my tires are good?  Thanks

Then you just drove over the neighbor's dog.


OK, OK, I'll stop...
