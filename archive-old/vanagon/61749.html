Subject: Re: no start problem

I had a similar problem on an old Dodge Van.  It turned out that the battery
cable was corroded.

&gt;&gt;Volks- my Diehard battery fluid is above the plates, the terminals look clean
&gt;&gt;&amp; well connected.  No battery or other warning lights have come on, but I
&gt;&gt;guess they can't be counterd on.  Radio &amp; CB work but turning key produces no
&gt;&gt;starting sound whatsoever.  I've been drifting down my hilly driveway to
&gt;&gt;jumpstart.  Am I right that my Tugboat ('90 syncro westy) doesn't have a
&gt;&gt;catalytic converter this would harm?   I'll plug in the trickle charger

&gt;I had a situation very similar to yours, albeit in a Toyota.
&gt;Started it up, drove to destination, took care of business,
&gt;jumped in, turned the key and...nothing.  Totally dead.
&gt;Had the electrical system checked; no problems found.  Battery
&gt;appeared to be OK also, but since it was one of those sealed,
&gt;no-maintenance deals there wasn't much to do with it.
&gt;I ended up getting an Interstate battery and getting some cash
&gt;back on the DieHard, and the problem never returned.
&gt;
&gt;I'd check the voltage on your battery first; I think a &quot;normal&quot;
&gt;charged battery is somewhere around the 12.4V+ range.  Since
&gt;yours is dead and you're trickle charging it, I'd measure after
&gt;it's sat around for a little while.
&gt;Personally, I'd ditch the DieHard &amp; get an Interstate, but
&gt;that's just my opinion, and I'd only do it if I knew there
&gt;was nothing wrong with the rest of the electrical charging
&gt;system.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck
