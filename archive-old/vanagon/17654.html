&gt;Any idea how I can get the fuel injectors to fire? Appreciate it.

Look near the centre of your engine block, under the intake pipes and try to 
find a rats nest of 5 or 6 brown wires attached to lugs on the block. These 
are the ground wires for the FI system. Make sure they are all 
there/clean/firmly attached. The area gets crudded up, with lots of greenish 
fur growing on the connectors. Check EACH one thoroughly. I've had a VW 
mechanic say to me &quot;does your van ever just stop running?&quot; when it happened 
following head rebuild. I did all the tests, air box, throttle switches, 
double relays etc. No luck. The brain likes a good strong ground I guess. tim s.
