Rust: How to use it to your advantage:
 
A few years I moved from Montana to Madison, Wisconsin.  In
Montana, the state Department of Transportation has officially
adopted a &quot;laissez faire&quot; attitude toward snow.  Motorists are
left to their own devices.  Many people buy &quot;snow tires&quot;, chains,
or simply drive carefully when it snows.  In Wisconsin, to my
surprise, the state wages an annual war against winter, dumping
huge quantities of salt on the snow in an (as yet totally
unsuccessful) effort to hasten the coming of spring.  This salt,
in combination with the disgustingly moist air caused by the
enormous numbers of people breathing in and out, in and out, all
day long, has the unintended consequence of hastening corrosion.
 
Controlled experiments show that, under typical rust belt
conditions, the average vintage VW, in an average winter, loses
50 pounds of sheet steel to the oxidation process commonly known
as &quot;rust&quot;.  (This number is for a 1967 type II.  Slightly less
for bugs, far more for Karmann Ghias.)  Oxidation, of course, is
the process by which oxygen atoms bond to the iron in the steel,
releasing free electrons and substantial amounts of energy.  It
also eats large holes in everything it touches.
 
One snowing winter evening, while shivering behind the wheel of
my pathetically underheated microbus, as I followed slowly behind
a large truck pouring salt onto the road, a rare thought came to
me.  &quot;Isn't there some way to use this to my advantage?&quot; I asked.
Having asked the question, the answer was obvious.  The next day
I decided to take a little time off from my dissertation research
on cold fusion and work out a solution.
 
A quick trip to a unguarded construction site provided me with
the raw material for my invention:  200 feet of zinc galvanized
chain link fencing.  I strapped this to the underbody of my bus,
using approximately 40 pink plastic coated coat hangers from Wal-Mart.
Then for the crucial link.  Using jumper cables (Although I never
need a jump, I always keep these cables in the bus so that I can
help those unfortunate others with less reliable vehicles.) I
completed the electrical connection between the fencing and my
left rocker panel.  Instantly, sparks flew, as the formerly
wasted electrons from the rusting rocker panel passed thru the
cables.  I then completed the final step, connecting the jumper
cables to an old toaster oven which I had mounted under the dash.
 
Now, the more salt the state puts down, the warmer I get.  On
especially good days I can even have toasted bagels by the time I
get to school.  Corrosion has become my friend.  It can be your
friend too.  As an aid to other midwestern VW owners, I am
willing to sell the complete plans for my &quot;CorrosoHeater&quot; for
only $49.95.
