 The transmission ratio data I have &lt;got it from Joel&gt; shows the same
 ring and pinion ration for both the 4 spd. and 5 spd. used with the 
 diesel. However, the  ratio for fifth is 0.77:1 compared to .85:1 for top
 gear in the 4 spd. This will result in an overall final drive about 
 10% higher with the 5 speed transaxle. Incidentally, first gear is the 
 same &lt;3.78:1&gt; in both gearboxes. I believe it's only the Syncro that has
 the &quot;stump-puller&quot; low gear.

&gt;  &gt;I'm planing to convert my 82 diesel to a TDI. Anybody out there done
&gt; anything
&gt;  &gt;similar? I've got a source for the new engine. I'm thinking I'll have to
&gt; swap
&gt;  &gt;the tranny also to take advantage of the new power. I've got a line on a 5
&gt;  &gt;speed, from an '84, but i understand that,  that trans has about the same
&gt;  &gt;final drive as the 4 speed. You just get a granny first gear ( plus
&gt;  &gt;lockup???). Any experienced tranny folks out there? I seem to be on a
&gt; mission
&gt;  &gt;to do this. 
&gt; Thanks,
