&gt;	Aha!
&gt;	RMMW advises us to buy a complete kit for $29/30 rather than
&gt;just the clutch cable for $6.25... well guess what? My '70's 'broken 
&gt;clutch  cable', when I finally got down into it to fix it, turned out 
&gt;to have been  a broken clevis pin ($2.25 separately) and grotesquely 
&gt;worn lever arm ($ 15.75)- can you say Total Lubrication Failure? 
&gt;The hole that the clevis pin goes through was elongated to a length
&gt;of over twice its original diameter- it was near to worn through
&gt;when the pin itself failed.
&gt;
&gt;

The kit is the best way to go.  Also check the clevis at the master cylinder.
 It is subject to the same wear and almost same failure, except with much
more spectacular results.
