Subject: clutch cable tube woes

Well i went out yesterday to install a new clutch bacle on the '73 camper.
 The old one had been on there for years and i was getting a little
paranoid about it.

Got it out w/o much trouble although i had to tug on it a little.  But i
didn't see where i had a problem.  

THEN i started sliding the new one in the tube.  About a foot from the end
of the metal tube it STOPPED.  Mind you it didn't even make it to the
curved flexible section - which is where i thought i would have trouble. 
I spent 3 hours trying to get that cable to go.  Even got the vise grips
on it and tried to hammer it in the hole.  No luck.  The old cable won't
go either.  The tube is not mashed, and is quite full of grease.\


So anyone have ideas of what i may do to finish the job.

I was so pissed yesterday that i had it TOWED to the local VW guru.  but
he won't be able to get to it to monday.  So if y'all can give me any help
i'll go get my baby and finish the job and go for a ride which is what i
wanted to do yesterday.

Thanks, Randy

I fought the bus and the bus won.  (so far)
