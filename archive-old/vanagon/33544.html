somebody on another car list reminded me of this ...

one sunday recently, a tv show about classic cars mentioned a way of cleaning
really grimy, oily, dirty parts (like oil pans, etc.): household drain cleaner

yup. he put about three cups of something like Draino crystals into ten
gallons of HOT water, and then dunked the part into the toxic mess, using
a coat hanger to hold the part.

precautions: he wore eye protection, big thick rubber gloves; and his wife
is gonna kill him cause he was doing it in the kitchen!!!
