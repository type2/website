Reference Joe Wagner's &amp; Todd Francis' comments on a cooler Thermostat -

To Todd Francis, The List, et al

There is a cooler thermostat available for the Wasserboxers, 80C instead
of the 87C.  After returning from the Boise Bus Pilots Show this morning
(11:20 PDT), I can report that I have had no problems with it on my 84
Westy 2.1.  Needle stayed to the left of the LED 85% of the time.  The
other 15%, the needle would &quot;hug&quot; the right side of the LED on some of
the long grades, even on some of the 6 1/2 percent grades on CA 299
between Redding/Alturas, CA and on US 20 between Burns/Ontario, OR. 
Highly recommended.

Comes in a pretty German box, finest kind.  I sell them for $21.50
(prepay with check/MO) (includes UPS Ground Freight).  COD's (CASH/MO) -
add $4.75.  Sorry no VISA/MC's yet - prolly in a couplea weeks I'll be
able to take them.

Order PN 025-121-113F/80
