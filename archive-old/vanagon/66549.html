&gt; Better not forget to add your phosphate free anti-freeze to that
&gt; water!!!!
&gt;
&gt; By the way, has anyone figured out if VW's Autobahn brand has any
&gt; &quot;magic&quot;
&gt; component or not???

 From seomewhere I read that the phosphates combine with hard components
in the water to form blockages.  If you use distilled water or that pure
stuff from K-mart, then you can use any type of aluminum engine coolant.
