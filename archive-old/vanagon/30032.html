 Joel,

 100,000 miles? A mere 100.000 miles? Just a child, I say. Congratulations
 anyway - it's a long way.

 I have a couple questions/observations. 

 You changed your rear wheel bearings - was this a pre-emptive move or
 was it triggered by a failure?

 You HAVEN'T changed your cylinder heads? How &lt;seriously&gt; have you
 managed this? Do you have a rigorous coolant change schedule? From
 what I have gathered from the list traffic, not having a corrosion
 induced head failure over such a long period is the exception rather
 than the rule.

 Can you tell me more about the transmission failure? Do you know which
 part of the 3rd/4th gear synchronizer assembly cracked?


 Happy &quot;Anniversary&quot; to you and your bus!


 Dave &lt;who hasn't had a bus with ONLY 100,000 miles on it since the '70s&gt;
