Subject: ABS on your 1991 Vanagon??

Hi Everyone.  I was catching up on my reading over the weekend, and 
came across this little piece in the July 22/96 editon of AutoWeek.
----------------------------------------------------------
Let's go the the scoreboard:
Percent of consumers who &quot;believe&quot; they have ABS on their 1991 
model-year vehicles -- but do NOT

TRUCKS:
Volkswagen Vanagon 92%
Jeep Wrangler               89%
Toyota Land Cruiser   82%

source: 1996 JD Power Brake Quality Report.
---------------------------------------------------------------

So, anyone on this list filled out a survey lately??


Harry.
