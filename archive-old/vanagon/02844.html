Subject:      showers

I have been cleaning out my account (2 MONTHS!!!!) and this is a little late.

We use a sun shower II (5 gallon) and it has been enough for my wife and I
both to shower and there was still water left over. It heats really well. We
also use it on cloudy days but boil water, bring to comfort level with cold
water and funnel into the sunshower bag. We use an EXTREMELY long tarp (those
blue ones in all the stores) and overlap at each side near the rear of the
vehicle and use a pole or tree to hold the middle to make a triangular shower
&quot;stall&quot;. Actually it's more like a big room (I think the tarp is 20 feet
long). I toss the bag up on top of the pop top. We sometimes use a cooler as a
washstand and use one of the REALLY large stainless steel bowls (WAL MART) for
washing hair, washing up for the night, etc.

                      ll             ll I usually tie the tarp ends
                      ll             ll to the poptop struts here.
                       l             l  I overlap the ends about 2-3
                       l Vanagon     l  feet.  If you carry a portable
                       l             l  toilet, the space can also be used
                       l             l  for that.
