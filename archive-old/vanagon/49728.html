Subject: EV hits 50k miles today!


Yep, got the 50K mile &quot;cherry&quot; this morning while cruising the interstate at 
80+ mph!

The EV has been one GREAT van...one of the best cars I've owned. So far 
we've had the following repairs/problems:

Replace fan resistors - warranty
Replace Battery - Sears Die Hard
Replaced the original Crappynental Tires with a set of Michelin MXLs ($400)
A/C Relief valve (free from A/C shop)
1 set of spark plugs 
2 air filters
1 set of front brake pads (VW dealer $115 including labor)


Only remaining &quot;problem&quot; I have to deal with is the black trim between the 
windows, its been bubbling and cracking for the past two years.

The EV was rewarded for its great service with a complete interior and 
exterior cleaning this morning, and a set of new Massachusetts licence 
plates with the &quot;Cape Cod&quot; motif...

And yes I've been tempted from time to time to trade the EV in for the odd 
Synchro Westie...but given its ability to haul 7 people, act like a pick up 
truck, and still be used as a camper...I think I've learned my lesson and 
keep our faithful van. Our new long term mission is to break the mileage 
record that is currently held by our 86 GTI.....210K miles (and still going 
with my oldest son as its new owner).....
