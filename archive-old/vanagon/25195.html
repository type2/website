&gt; How much do you pay for gas? 
&gt; 
&gt; In San Diego, California we buy self serve unleaded regular gas for
&gt; US $1.179 per gallon  or  $0.311 per litre
&gt; 
&gt; There is a station that I never use (but I pass by and laugh on the
&gt; way to work) that charges full serve  $1.849 per gallon ($0.489 per
&gt; litre).

    I'm in San Diego and pay about $1.49 for the highest 
    octane stuff Union 76 sells...
