&gt;Hi there,
&gt;
&gt;        According to my VW owners manual it says to never push start the
&gt;van, even if it is a standerd trany.  I always thought this was a useful
&gt;option in an emergancy but they claim it will damage the CAT.  Would it be
&gt;so bad once in a while if needed?

Our Vanagon has an auto tranny, so I can't comment directly on Vanagons,
but we used to have an '83 Tercel that I bump started dozens of times, it
always passed CA emissions with plenty of room to spare, even after 16
years, so I think once in a while is OK.  I think the warning is more for
those who might be inclined (no pun intended) to just park on a hill for
months at a time after their battery dies.
