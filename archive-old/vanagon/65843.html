Fremont, Michigan -- Gerber Products Company is not involved in any
                     settlement involving reimbursements to customers.
Rumors that have been circulating for several months involving Gerber and
an alleged settlement are completely false.

A settlement was announced in 1996 involving
infant formula and pricing issues, but Gerber was not connected with the
litigation. The deadline for filing claims under the infant formula
settlement expired 1/31/97. It appears that the Gerber name has mistakenly been connected to the Minneapolis
P.O. box used to process claims for the infant formula settlement.
 Consumers are cautioned not to send birth records or
other information in connection with this rumor. Gerber does not know the
source of the misinformation, nor does it have additional information on how it is
being communicated.

&gt; I found out today that Gerber lost a lawsuit because they advertised that
&gt; their food was all natural and when taken to court it came out that they
&gt; had used preservatives.
&gt;
&gt; In the settlement Gerber Food is now responsible for giving every child
&gt; born between 1985 and 1997 (under the age of 12) a $500 Savings Bond.
&gt;
&gt; All you have to do to receive it is to send a copy of your child's birth
&gt; certificate and social security card to:
&gt;
&gt; GERBER FOOD
&gt; Settlement Administration
&gt; Infant Litigation
&gt; P.O. Box 1602
&gt; Minneapolis, MN 55480
&gt;
&gt; Naturally, all of you will allow your child, when they reach the age of 16,
&gt; to use this Bond to purchase a VW and not waste it on something unimportant
&gt; like college.  :-)
