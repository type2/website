Very nice job, Joel, but where are the pre '67 buses? How long were they?

&gt;anyway, most folks do NOT believe that the bus is only 1 foot longer than
&gt;the beetle. unless you put both cars up against a wall, side by side. and
&gt;even the vanagon is just 1.5 feet longer. it's really wierd that the rabbit
&gt;is so short.

Hmmm. I always figured the 2-door and 4-door Rabbits were the same length.
Where did the length go? It certainly wasn't in the back seat legroom!
