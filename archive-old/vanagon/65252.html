&gt;
&gt; OK, here's the latest weirdnesses with my 81 Westfalia...
&gt;
&gt; Weirdness #1: the cold-start engine noise. It sounds like baseball cards in
&gt; the spokes of your bicycle wheels, for those of us old enough to remember
&gt; before baseball cards were &quot;collector's items&quot; and there was no reason not
&gt; to casually destroy them. The noise diminishes but does not disappear
&gt; completely when the bus is in gear and rolling, louder in neutral. Also
&gt; louder when braking or facing downhill (center of gravity shifted forward).
&gt; After 5 minutes or so the noise stops and will not recur until I park it
&gt; and let the engine get _completely_ cold, like all day or overnight. Even
&gt; after sitting for an hour or so -- no noise on restart. It sounds more like
&gt; plastic than metal, I've tried sticking my head into the engine compartment
&gt; but I can't seem to localize it.

Sounds like stuck lifter.  Try my favorite fix:  All quart of ATF fluid,
run till good and hot or until fixed.  Then drain and refill with oil.

&gt;
&gt; Weirdness #2: the not-hot-start. When the engine is *really* hot, like
&gt; after a couple of hours of highway driving in 95-degree weather with the
&gt; a/c running, if I stop briefly (like for gas) when I try to start her up
&gt; the engine turns over veeeerrrrry slowly and reluctantly, and won't catch.
&gt; I have to sit for about 10 more minutes, and then she starts right up. I've
&gt; also gotten it push-started by getting it rolling only as fast as I could
&gt; push it by myself on a level surface, probably 5 mph max.

Could be a couple of things.  As a diagnostic, retard the timing and see
if that doesn't cure it.  If it does, it's a distributor sticking.  If
it doesn't, starter could be binding when hot.
