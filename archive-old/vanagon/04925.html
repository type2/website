Subject: Re: Five Year Dream Car Pick

New utility type vehicle: Range Rover or a Hummer
New Car: Mercedes Benz S-class (500 SEC specifically)
New sports car: Porsche Carrera RS America
Preowned picks: preowned versions of above
If I really could have only one: the Benz

classic sports cars: '59 Ferrari 250GT SWB California, '55 Porsche RS550 
Spyder, '55 Mercedes 300SLR, Shelby 427 Cobra, Shelby GT350, '63 Vette 
coupe, 

Comments: let's face it, the automotive landscape is much to complex to 
pick &quot;just one vehicle&quot;. Ask yourself this: if you can afford more than 
one vehicle for yourself, would you own only one? You would probably have 
different vehicles for different purposes...

&gt; Okay, everyone, I think we should have our own &quot;Five Year Dream Car Pick.&quot;
&gt; Same rules, which for your convenience I reproduce here:
&gt; 
&gt; ..each was asked to pick the car, any car,
&gt; he wished. BUT! there's some gotchas!  (I think joel meant &quot;catches&quot;, but
&gt; I think maybe &quot;gotchas&quot; and &quot;catches&quot; are pronounced identically in
&gt; Alabamese.)
&gt; 
&gt; 1. they had to live with the car they chose for five years.
&gt; 2. it was to be their only automobile in those five years.
&gt; 3. they had to drive it daily to work, to the 7-11, across the country, and
&gt;       through michigan winters.
&gt; 4. after five years, they would give the car back, without depreciation
&gt;       affecting him in any way.
&gt; 5. they would, however, have to foot the bill for maintenance, fuel, tires;
&gt;       all non-warranty upkeep would be dollars dragged from their personal
&gt;       savings.
&gt; 
&gt; So quit bothering with that work you're supposed to be doing and send in
&gt; your choice.  Now we'll find out if this really ought to be called the
&gt; Vanagon list!
