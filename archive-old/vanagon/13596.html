Subject: Anybody know about....


	1.	Repair/replacement of canvas in Westy pop-tops?  I got a 
price list and some great pics from VW Canvas in Texas.  While they offer 
a good looking product and make available custom colours, they seem a bit 
steeply priced.  Any other options or suggestions?

	2.	Westy/aftermarket tents for use on campers.  Yeah, I 
know...I've got a better chance winning the 649 draw.  Seriously though, 
does anyone posses one of these beauties, who would be willing to measure 
it and send me an appropriate diagram of the construction of the 
thing...incl. the rain gutter clips?  I may be nuts, but I'd like to try 
and fabricate my own sometime.  Some wholesale canvas and many hours of 
labour later...maybe I can start a cottage industry.

	3.	Replacing the louvered (sic) windows in a 79(or earlier) 
Westy with solid or sliding glass windows from an early 80's Vanagon 
based Westy?  I'm interested in this exchange to reduce heat loss in my 
camper in winter, and reduce rattle/road noise in summer months.  I may 
have already located the Vanagon windows...hopefully they will fit (any 
opinions on that itself?) but I'm a little leery of the actual procedure.

	4. Restarting a stored VW aircooled fuel injected engine that has
sat dormant for 5 months through a Canadian (albiet mildish)winter.  I
took out the battery, and added a fuel line anti freeze with the last fill
up, but I did not remove either the oil or the sparkplugs.  Should I take
'em out (the plugs) and give the cylinders a small dose of WD-40 before
attempting ignition?  Please advise.... 

	Jeez, that was extensive.  Sorry for the massive posting, but 
this inquiring mind really, really wants to know.
	Feel free to respond via personal e-mail if you wanna or have a 
long posting.

	Thanks in advance many times over list members....
