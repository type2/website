Volks:
I subscribe to a magazine called the 356 Registry. Their mission is&quot; the
perpetuation of the vintage (1948-1965) 356 series Porsche.They are
non-profit,provide a forum for the exchange of ideas,experiences and
information&quot;.  They have a limited circulation and membership dues are
$25/yr for six years.
My question to you is: would a magazine like this, dedicated solely to
Vanagons , be of any interest? What made me think of this was two weeks
ago I  purchase Hot VWs' special &quot;All About Performance VW Engines&quot;
edition. They're story &quot;The Ultimate VW Dyno Test&quot; was about baselining a
new engine then dyno testing forty variations of bolt goodies. I would
love to see what helpful mods could be made to a wasserboxer. Comments?
What would you like to see?

&gt;The October 1997 issue of Hot VW's has an editorial about if they should
&gt;include more about the water cooled vw's in future issues.  They talk
about
&gt;alternating issues every other month with a section devoted exclusively
to
&gt;the water cooled VW market with Vanagons and Eurovans noted!   But
before
&gt;they jump in and do it they want more input.  So lets give it to them!
&gt;They want to know our feelings and a simple yes or no,
