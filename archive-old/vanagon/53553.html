Subject: Bumpers needed

Heys Guys,

Did the road trip to Chicago from Philly and wiped out on the ice in
Indiana on X-Mas Eve. I slowly spun into the guard rail around South
Bend and whacked both my LF and LR sections of my bumpers.  I hit it
hard enough to rip off the front bumper and twist it into a pretzel, the
rear might bend back but it has a rip in it from the guard rail bolt.

All I can say is the van is tough as nails and slid to the lesser of two
evils, the guard rail not the median ditch.  NOBODY GOT HURT!!! not even
the dog, we did get minor muscle pulls in our necks but for as hard as
we hit I was amazed at what little damage was done.  As I had mentioned
both bumpers need replacing, the LF corner behind the bumper got crushed
but only up to the seam that's hidden by the bumper when on, lost a turn
signal lens, dented around the turn signal, the LR tow hook got bent
into the skirt that got bent into the CAT flange (made an awful noise
till I pulled it about a cm away) no damage to the exhaust.  Already
replaced the turn signal bulb with a yellow one to get home on and had
to replace the the RF headlamp cause the filiment broke during impact.

I was one of over 30 cars and trucks that lost it on the ice. Indiana
did not salt the road and there were fatalities.

I'm already getting a price from volks sport on new bumpers, but if
anyone has a parts van I could pick at it would sure help, email me
prices.
