&gt;          The a/c hasnt worked in a 3 years....and was diagnosed as 
&gt;needing a
&gt;new receiver drier.   

If the receiver is a gone then the expansion valve (downstream) may
become clogged with its remains.
&gt;          The other thing that's a bummer is that the fresh air fan 
&gt;doesn't work.

Our 85 GL eats fan speed switches. Something is drawing to much current
and melting mine. It still works on high so I gave this problem the
appropriate priority and shifted it into the &quot;que&quot;.

For what it's worth
