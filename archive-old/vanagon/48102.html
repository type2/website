Subject: Re: NC Busses This Weekend!!!!!!

Richard,

	Greetings from Gaston County, N.C. I have recently purchased a 
'78 Westy (bee-utiful Green color!), and am greatly looking forward to 
camping with other VW volks.  I am thinking seriously about driving down 
to Jordan Lake this weekend, but have developed a problem in that I have 
recently detected a slight odor of gasoline in the bus, and consequently 
may have to stay home to try to locate its source.  One reason I would 
really like to come down is that some of you may be able to help me in 
locating it.  I have looked at the back side of the gas tank (by removing 
the firewall) and can find no leak.  I can likewise find no gasoline or 
gasoline odor in the engine compartment.  I am told that my problem may 
be in or around the fuel pump which can be accessed from underneath.  As 
you can tell, I have the mechanical ability of a pine knot!

	At any rate, I am very interested in camping and caravaning with 
other VW campers, and will stay in touch. May see you at Jordan Lake.
