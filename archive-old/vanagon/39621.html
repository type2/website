        Not the same ones. The $70-90 one is for vanagons, '80 and above.
The '68-79 can usually be found for around $29 or so, if you shop around.

Ellis butts in with:
I have obtained the Bentley for the 68-79 for relatively cheap but have
found that the splittie manual is pretty spendy. I found a used Bentley
Vanagon manual either on this list or at a used bookstore for accecptable
cost. Sorry I can not provide an accurate new price on the Vanagon book.
According to the prices as quoted in a Barretts Enterprises advert. (HotVWs,
May, 1996,  page 109) the newly released reprints of the &quot;VW1200&quot; 1961-1956
&lt;item # V165&gt; and the &quot;VW Transporter&quot; 1063-1967 &lt;item #VW267&gt; are listed at
$69.95 (US) plus shipping *each*. 
Order desk phone number is (818) 967-5171. Azuusa, California, USA.
