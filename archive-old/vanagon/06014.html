Subject:       I'm sorry, not enough coffee...

&quot;The power of a man's brain is in direct proportion to the amount of 
coffee he has consumed.&quot;  -author... can't remember...yet

I forgot to ask for Important Stats:
transmission type (auto/manual)
accessories ie PS, AC, Jacuzzi etc.

so... '85 1.9l weekender with AT PS AC  = 16.5-17.5
