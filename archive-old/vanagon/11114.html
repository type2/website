Subject: [Re]the bizarre

Paul Sogge has a poltergeist in his bus that may be from the same lineage
as that which possessed my Campmobile. Although the manifestation was
not as dramatic I am willing to suggest the culprit may take residence
in your fuse box, located next to the steering column. 

My problem dealt with either a malfunctioning radio, inconsistant dash
light operation, and failure to turn the engine inspite of full battery
power.

I removed the two screws on the fuse box and gently pulled it away from the 
mount. It was apparent that the door buzzer wire was disconnected. This
was jumping around (probably when I closed the front door hard) and shorting
out the other connectors. I hate the sickly moan of the door buzzer so I
just removed the wire and have since had no problems with the electrical
system.

So Paul, I would have a look behind your fuse box. It's a little hard
to bend the upper torso to get a good look but easy removal of the driver's
seat helps. Make sure all the connectors are fastened, then follow the wires
from the light switch and brake switch (which is under the bus, situated
on the master cylinder- directly below the driver's seat). Maybe someone
knows the color of the wires so you won't have to crawl under to find out.

Don't worry, have a homebrew!
