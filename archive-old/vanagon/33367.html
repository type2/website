        From Robert Fuhlghm's &quot;All I ever really needed to know I learned
in Kindergarten&quot;. I highly reccomend this and all of Fuhlghm's books to
everyone.

RF&gt;     &quot;Jumper cables? You got jumper cables, buddy?&quot;
RF&gt;     &quot;Yeah, sure, I got jumper cables.&quot;
RF&gt;     English teacher and his nice sweet wife, from Nampa, Idaho (as it
RF&gt; turned out). In their funny little foreign car. Drove around town
RF&gt; with their lights on in the morning fog and left the lights on, and
RF&gt; so forth and so on. Dead meat now. Need jumper cables. Need
RF&gt; battery. Need Good Samaritan. Need a friendly hand from someone who
RF&gt; looks like he knows what to do with jumper cables. And the Good
RF&gt; Fairy of Fate placed them in my hands.
RF&gt;     Men are supposed to know about jumper cables. It's supposed to be
RF&gt; in the genetic code, right? But some of us men are mental mutants,
RF&gt; and if it's under the hood of a car, well it's voodoo, Jack, and
RF&gt; that's the end of it.
RF&gt;     Besides, this guy only asked me if I HAD jumper cables. He didn't
RF&gt; ask me if I knew how to USE them. I thought by the way he asked
RF&gt; that he knew what he was doing. After all, he had an Idaho license
RF&gt; plate and was wearing a baseball cap and cowboy boots. All THOSE
RF&gt; kind of people know about jumper cables when they're born, don't
RF&gt; they? Guess he thought a white-bearded old man wearing hiking boots
RF&gt; and driving a 20 year old VW van was bound to use jumper cables a
RF&gt; lot. So I get out my cables, and we swagger around being all macho
RF&gt; and cool and talking automobile talk. We look under the hood of his
RF&gt; rig, and there's no battery.
RF&gt;     &quot;Hell,&quot; I said, &quot;There's your problem right there. Somebody stole
RF&gt; your battery.&quot;
RF&gt;     &quot;Dang,&quot; he said.
RF&gt;     &quot;The battery is under the backseat,&quot; said his nice sweet wife.
RF&gt;     &quot;Oh.&quot;
RF&gt;     So we took the luggage out of the backseat and hauled the seat out
RF&gt; into the parking lot and, sure enough, there it was. A battery.
RF&gt; Right there. Just asking for jumper cables to be laid on it. I
RF&gt; began to get worried when the guy smirked at his wife and said
RF&gt; under his breath that he took auto mechanics and sex education at
RF&gt; the same time in high school and they had been confused in his mind
RF&gt; ever since, when it came to where things were and what you did to
RF&gt; get any action out of them. We laughed. His wife didn't laugh at
RF&gt; all. She just pulled out a manual and started thumbing through it.
RF&gt;     Anyway, the sum of our knowledge was that positive poles and
RF&gt; negative poles were involved, and either one or both cars ought to
RF&gt; be running, and 6-volt and 12-volt batteries and other-volt
RF&gt; batteries did or did not work out. I thought he knew what he was
RF&gt; doing and kind of went along with it. Guess he did the same. And we
RF&gt; hooked it all up real tight and turned the ignition key in both
RF&gt; cars at the same time. And there was this electrical arc between
RF&gt; the cars that not only fried his ignition system, it welded the
RF&gt; jumper cables to my battery and knocked the baseball cap off his
RF&gt; head. The sound was like that of the world's largest fly hitting
RF&gt; one of those electric killer screens. ZISH. Accompanied by an
RF&gt; AWESOME blue flash and some smoke. Power is an amazing thing.
RF&gt;     We just sat down right there in the backseat of his car, which was
RF&gt; still sitting out there in the parking lot. Awed by what we had
RF&gt; accomplished. And his wife went off with the manual to find some
RF&gt; semi-intelligent help. We talked as coolly and wisely as we could
RF&gt; in the face of circumstances. He said, &quot;Ignorance and power and
RF&gt; pride are a deadly mixture, you know.&quot;
RF&gt;     &quot;Sure are,&quot; I said. &quot;like matches in the hands of a
RF&gt; three-year-old. Or automobiles in the hands of a sixteen-year-old.
RF&gt; Or faith in God in the mind of a saint or a maniac. Or a nuclear
RF&gt; arsenal in the hands of a movie character. Or even jumper cables
RF&gt; and batteries in the hands of fools.&quot; (We were trying to get
RF&gt; something cosmic and serious out of our own invocation of power,
RF&gt; you see. Humbled as we were.)
RF&gt;     Sometime later I got present in the mail from Nampa, Idaho. From
RF&gt; the guy's nice sweet wife. As a gesture of grace-forgiveness
RF&gt; combined with instruction and admonition to go and sin no more.
RF&gt; What she sent was a set of electronic true-start, foolproof,
RF&gt; tangle-free jumper cables. Complete with instructions that tell you
RF&gt; everything and more than you ever wanted to know about jumper
RF&gt; cables, in English and Spanish. The set is designed so that when
RF&gt; you get everything all hooked up, a little solid state switch
RF&gt; control box tells you if you've done it right or not, before any
RF&gt; juice flows. We could all use a device like that between us and
RF&gt; power, I guess. It's nice to know that progress in such things is
RF&gt; possible-in the face of ignorance and pride. Progress is possible.
RF&gt;     Jumper cables? You want jumper cables? Sure I got jumper cables. I
RF&gt; can hook you up to Grand Coulee Dam, buddy. Or wire you into
RF&gt; Almighty God. Or whatever powers there be. AMEN!

Peace,
