Subject: re: Help! Head Question.

&gt;I have a 2.0 Lt Type 4 engine that I am doing a top end rebuild on.  This
&gt;is the first time I have ever attempted anything like this... The heads I
&gt;pulled off of my engine do not say VW on them anywhere,  the only marking
&gt;on them is a large &quot;AMC.&quot;  I hear that this means that these are Spanish
&gt;heads.  Are these worth rebuilding? Are they &quot;good&quot; cores?  Are Spanish
&gt;heads an inferior to VW made heads?  Is it worth paying a couple of
&gt;hundred more for VW heads?

Hah, you have the same heads I have! Must be some local source of these things.
&gt;From what I've found out, they are softer material than standard heads.
They were specifically constructed so as to NOT require a head gasket (aka
sealing ring).
Are they worth rebuilding? I don't know for sure. Mine were in good shape
other than having the damaged surface - I was able to get them fly cut,
then properly installed with gaskets. I was told by the mechanic that new
ones which he trusted were about $370 each. I don't know who made those
though.
&gt;From what research I've done, if they're not cracked, they're probably okay.

Lots of people seem to think highly of heads built by Mark Stephens down in Ca.
(You can find an address in a VW mag).

hope this helps,
