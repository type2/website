Subject: Re: Syncro CV Madness..

I sort of remember that it is cheaper to put in rebuilt axels the way tim
says than to install your own new CV joints at the dealer. 

The news I have to give though is that the new blue &quot;poly&quot; boots for the
Vanagon are improved and said to be superior. Someone posted about them a
couple of months ago but I didn't realize these were factory items. I would
insist that you get the blue boots if you have any work done at the dealer.

Harry, for these kinds of prices I would definitely just shoot grease in
there with the hypodermic  trick that Tim mentioned and wait for your axels
to fail. They give a lot of notice. I assume your boots are still good. 

I just had my front outer CV joint boot replaced under extended warranty
(Masterguard). (I couldn't believe they covered this under warranty).

Now TIM. Where do we go to buy these hypodermic things?

90 syncro westy 





&gt;Hi Everyone.  I made a few enquiries regarding CV boots and joints 
&gt;for a 1990 Syncro, and this is what I have to report;
&gt;
&gt;First off, all $$ are in CDN.
&gt;
&gt;CV-JOINTS
&gt;front axle inner $167.88 each
&gt;front axle outer $101.67 each    
&gt;rear axle            $208.90 each   all four joints same price.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;CV-BOOTS
&gt;
&gt;front axle inner $167.88 each
&gt;front axle outer $86.39  each
&gt;
&gt;rear axle             $39.85 each  all four boots same price
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;CV-JOINT REPACKING
&gt;
&gt;I also enquired how much it costs to get the CV-Joints repacked.  
&gt;They (VW) say 2.8 hours labour per axle.  A syncro has 4 axles.  The 
&gt;labour rate is $75/hr, and then there are steel bands, and extra bits 
&gt;&amp; pieces to do the job along with grease, etc.  Total bill for all 
&gt;four axles is $820 labour, plus bits.... so $900 would be the bill.
&gt;
&gt;Would this be worth to do or let the pieces fail and replace as you 
&gt;go?  Any advice would be appreciated.  So far with 114000 km (around 
&gt;70000 miles) there have been no problems with the joints on my van, 
&gt;and they have never been opened.
&gt;
&gt;TIA
&gt;
&gt;Harry.
