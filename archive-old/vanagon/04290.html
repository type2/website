Subject:  Hi, I'm considering to buy a VW Transporter (Vanagon, Bus,

Hi, I'm considering to buy a VW Transporter (Vanagon, Bus, Caravelle, ...), that is a type II
brick-shaped car with the engine in the rear. My money could buy me a model '87 up to '90. The
prices for gasoline, diesel and turbo diesel are not much different here in Denmark.

So, I'm seeking advice from you, what kind of typical errors or repairs should I beware of ?

Is the turbo diesel much more fragile than the one without turbo ? Any corrosion problems worth
mentioning ? The water-cooling has very long tubes, is this a problem ?

The Allrounder version with glass in the rear seems for me to be the right choise, if city traffic
should be possible. Do that propose any leakage ?

Best regards, Niels Kristian Jensen.

(The same questions are valid for Ford Transit, Toyota HiAce, Nissan King Van and Mazda B2200
Van, but I haven't found the right groups for these yet)

And finaly, I took the INDEX of VANAGON, but no FAQ file showed up. Does it exist ?
