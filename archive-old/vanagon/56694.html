I have a 82 Vanagon with a NEW motor.  mechanically perfect, 2 new &amp; 2 good 
tires, NO rust, paint original (cream over brown), needs seat covers.  
Invested $2000 in motor 5000 miles ago.  Video &amp; mechanics name available.  
Delivery negotiable.  Family has shrunk &amp; I don't need a van any more.  
Asking $3000.  If interested, email or call 913-628-6462.  Thanks, Mike.
