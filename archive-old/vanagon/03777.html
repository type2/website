Subject:      Gas heater help, 69 camper



While trying to get my new 69 ready for the road I pulled the engine and trany
and a wire that runs across the front (&quot;front means front&quot;) of the engine
compartment that connects the gas heater to the voltage regulator. Suddenly I
knew, that sinking feeling, I don't know where it attaches. Can anyone help me
out. The end of the wire has a partial circle , half washer, piece that looks
like it goes under a screw. I know nothing about a gas heater, and have no
idea how to find out about how to maintain it. I do hope to use it though, if
I can ever figure out where that wire attaches.

                                       Tim (and his 69. Hey, got a 68 bus for
sale!)
