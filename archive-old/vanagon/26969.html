&gt;Personally i'd like to mount 50 cal machine guns on the front and rear of
&gt;my car.

The way I see it, a B17 or B25 top turret should fit just about right in a
bus.  Put a couple of servo controls on your dash and you can rotate and
lower the guns at anyone.  Quilla would love it under the plexiglas...
