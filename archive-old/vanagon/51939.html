An obvious misprint. The thermostat housing tightening toque reads
10Nm(61 ft-lbs).If you will reference the item above that entry reads&quot;
coolant pump pulley 20 Nm(15 ft-lbs). Twice the Nm, 1/4th the ft-lbs. 
Does not compute. It should equal around 7.5 ft.lbs!  Now reference page
19.8. Ah-Ha! What they meant to say is              61 in-lbs!  Thanks
for pointing that out. I personally rely on the tried and true German
method of gooduntite on non-critical parts.
Good Luck

&gt;I recently replaced the thermostat in my Vanagon (87 Waterboxer), the
&gt;Bentley manual (Back cover under &quot;Coolant system, section 19) says I 
&gt;should
&gt;tighten the bolts on the housing to 61 pound/feet, is this correct?  
&gt;It
&gt;seems excessive when the housing is plastic, does anybody know if 61
&gt;pound/feet is correct, or what it should be tightend to?
