 &gt;&gt; Just put 'em in the dishwasher, full hot cycle, bulb hole side down.  Works
great with &quot;Cascade liqui-gel&quot;.  As soon as the cycle completely stops, open
the dishwasher door asap so the hot headlights dry quickly.  You'll find
 your light output seems almost doubled on a 10 year old vehicle!!! &lt;&lt;

 How well do you think this will work on headlamps that are cracked?  Were
yours cracked?

 BTW, the diswasher has many uses.  I've put headlight covers from my '67 in
there, windshield rubbers before installation, not to mention various small
parts that took the plunge without my wife's knowledge...
