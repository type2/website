    I probably belong in the idiot files, after having a cold bucket of water 
    poured down the back of my neck more than once... from clogged sunroof 
    drains. My sunroof recesses fill with water (at $120, the new seal didn't 
    help) and I get the shower when I stop or head down hill.
    
    Anyone know where these drains are, and can I blow compressed air through 
    them (or use a wire), and which direction to blow the air as not to compact
    
    the problem??

my solution:  go to the carwash and take the
high pressure hose to 'em.

for the front drains, weep hole at bottom of
post but blow the drains out from above (corners
of the sunroof frame)

for the rear drains, weep hole is a tube just
visible through the engine air louvers high
on the side of the bus.  these you will have to
blow out in reverse, which means that this will
probably be temporary.

for me, twice a year does it.
