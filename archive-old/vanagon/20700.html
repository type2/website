Subject:       propane fill-valve repair kit review

today i received and installed the propane fill valve rebuild kit.  
thanks go to Derek for the tip on this one.

the kit consists of 4 O-rings, a small inlet screen and a *very* 
small amount of lubricant.  for those of us that have had problems 
with propane leaking back out after a fill, this _may_ be the ticket, 
time will tell.

the fill valve itself is a simple affair (well, as simple as affairs 
go) basically held together by 4 screws in the cover.  i rebuilt mine 
with the valve removed from the tank but it would be possible to do 
it with the valve still attached, just harder to get everything clean.  
rebuild consists essentially of cleaning the old grease out and 
installing and lubricating the new o-rings.  pretty cake stuff and a 
nice set of instructions are included with the kit.  oh, when you get 
that special enclosed grease on your finger ready to greeze (as we 
say in the woods) everything up-- don't wipe yer nose and lose the 
grease... there's enough to do the job, period.

here's the scoop:
PN V20128  PISTON O-RING KIT W/LUBE
avail from Manchester Tank 800/877-9923
cost $4.01 per kit (a veritable bargain)
COD's done over the phone but it cost me over $9 for shipping/COD

note:  the invoice says &quot;THIS IS A ONE TIME ONLY SALE PLEASE CONTACT 
YOUR LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR (yeah, right.  in northern MN?) FOR FURTHER 
ORDERS.&quot;  so do it once and do it big!
