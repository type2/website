Subject: Re:useless subject headings

The discussion of subject headings on this list is inappropriate.  Any
comments about this should go to me directly and NOT to the vanagon list
which is solely for the purpose of discussing VW vans and for VW related
camaraderie and NOT for the discussion of list administration. 

Please leave that to me. 

Thanks.
