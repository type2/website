Subject: re: camping in maine

&gt;My wife and I stayed at a beautiful campground in Southwest Harbor ME (about
&gt;5mi from the park) over the Forth of July weekend(make reservations early),
&gt;I'll try to dig up a name(around 12/nite...for tent/VW site(no hookups)).  I
&gt;even managed to get the 76 Westy I was driving up to the top of Cadillac Mt.
&gt; I had to open the door and push a few times to keep going up! :)
&gt;
&gt; I've given up on the idea of camping in ME. until next Spring.  I think
&gt;I'll hit North Carolina instead this coming weekend.

hmmm, where in nc? it's mighty cold down here right now. the mountains are
getting snow from what i hear. western NC gets damn cold this time of year.
specially the boone area. if ya need any ideas of where to go...drop me an
email.
