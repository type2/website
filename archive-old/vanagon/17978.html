&gt; I know have a question about self-adjusters.  It's been two days since I

&gt; something of a lip around the drum, is it just going to take some more 
&gt; &quot;adjusting&quot; or do you think I put something back together wrong?

Ummmm,
You did tighten them by manually after you did the brake job didn't you?
The self-adjusters are just there to take up the slack as the shoes wear
down.  It would take a long time to tighten up your brakes one tooth at
a time with the backing up brake method.  Besides, you shouldn't even
be driving it if the brakes aren't adjusted.  (Yikes)
