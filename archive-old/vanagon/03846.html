Subject: Re: To those '83-'85 Vanagon folks

   My '85 vanagon, with about 61k, (shows 55k, but I had the cheap
model with out a tach, and I replaced the ENTIRE guage cluster with
one from a junk yard that did have the tach and the neat little
digital clock in the middle and so the incorrect mileage)  that 
does not leak.   KNOCK, KNOCK on wood.
