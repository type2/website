Subject:       '67 Deluxe Saga continues

Friends,

I feel compelled to tell you all about my continuing saga of the '67 
Deluxe of mine which is still stranded on the edge of the freeway.

As I explained the other day, it myseriously died on me on my way to 
school.  I deduced (not being a mechanic) that the engine was not 
getting gas.  (Golf Clap for Mike!)

On my way home, I stopped, took the line to the carb off, and turned 
it over a few times.  No gas squirted out.

I had a friend rip the fuel pump off my 1800, and we went back up to 
Salt Lake to replace it.  I took off the old one without too much 
trouble.  (Just a fight with the bolt by the distributor.)  

I then attempted to put on my new pump.  Well, it wouldn't fit 
because it was too tall and caught up on the intake manifold, right 
under the carb.  I was rather perturbed, at the idea of having to 
go 20 miles back down to my house to go get another one that fit 
properly.

Out of curiosity, I pumped the &quot;broken&quot; fuel pump, and bingo, gas 
squirted as it normally would!

I was baffled for a moment, then noticed the little piston which 
acutally pumps the fuel pump (Keep in mind this is the first time 
I've ever messed with a fuel pump in my life.)

Well I had my friend crank the engine, and NOPE, the little piston 
did not move up or down.  Just sort of bounced.

I called up a mechanic friend, wondering what could be wrong.  I 
pulled the piston, and it was only about 2&quot; long, and sheared.  I 
called a mechanically minded friend, and he said it should be rounded 
on the end.  

I took this to mean like 1/8&quot; had broken off.  Well the plastic 
holder was all cracked too.

Later that night, I went to where my 1800 is, and pulled the piston 
out of it.  

ACK!  It is 4&quot; long.  Looks like 2&quot; is down in the engine somewhere.

I plan to go tomorrow to drain the oil, and run a magnet around in 
there to get it out.  A friend said I could drive it, but with care.  
(Huh?)  If that thing get up in the workings, won't something be 
seriously damaged.

Questions:

What in the world would cause the piston to get busted in half.  I 
assume it was because the plastic holder cracked, and it got 
skeewampus in there and got busted off somehow?

This thing rests on a lobe on the camshaft, correct?

Will the other part of the piston be down in the oil pan area of the 
engine?

Thanks guys!

- Mike

P.S.  Off to pick up the '57 tonight!  EXCITED!!!



At this time 
I was tooling around with it, I decided to just pump it on my own.
