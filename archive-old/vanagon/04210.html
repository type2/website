&gt; Food for thought (fuel for VW's):  does anyone have an opinion

&gt; a VW run hotter?
&gt; 

run the super in your rig.

the higher octane will allow your engine to run more eficiantly, and 
therefore cooler.

and for further information that may or may not concern you, try
compareing the miles (or kilometers) per monitary unit (this IS an
international mailing list) instead of distance per gallon (or liter) and
you may find that it is cheaper to run the more expensive gas because of
how much farther you travel on a given amount of fuel. 

i tried it for about 6 months. 10 tanks of regular, and then 10 tanks of 
premium. i was getting about 10 mpg with regular and 13 mpg with 
premium. that's average for each 10 tanks of fuel.

because of the difference in price, the diference in cost was about %5, 
or less. but the BIG differance was in starting and pedel-to-the-metal 
power. 

so i fill with premium. it's cheaper, it runs beter, and it means that 
each tankfull carries me more miles before i need to tend to it again.

and just for the hell of it, be sure to check your oil with EACH fuel 
stop. maybe you'll notice a differance in how hot the dipstick is each 
time.

and do the 10 tanks of regular first. you'll notice the other benifits 
of useing premium easier that way.
