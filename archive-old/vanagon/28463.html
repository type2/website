Subject: RE: Why VWs &amp; T/A (with ObVW :)

David L Finet sez:
*snip*
&gt;Also, if you think that women are not treated as second class citizens, 
&gt;ask why there are no &quot;wonderbriefs&quot; designed to make men's packets bulge 
&gt;out for the admiration of the adoring masses.  I feel cetain that some of 

Here I _have_ to jump in. These things _are_ available. (My wife showed me
the ad, we got quite a laugh out of it.) The way _I_ see it (Oh boy, flamesuit
on :-) is that women are more concerned about their looks than men. NOT for
impressing men either. Go look on a beach, women who are obviously concerned
about their appearance and men with gross beerbellies. (IMHO, I know this is
a vast generalisation, offer void where prohibited by law, etc.)

Anyhow, I don't think women find men with &quot;bulging packets&quot; as attractive
as men _are perceived to_ find women with bulging assets. Myself, I pity women
that have to carry all that extra stuff around. Whoo, this is beginning to
sound like alt.support.fetish.small.eyes :-)

ObVW: I want to pull the heads on a Type IV 1700 soon. As soon as I've clocked
10000 km (6000 mi for the metrically challenged :-). Just to have a look-see.
So - do I need to replace those little aluminum or whatever seals between the
top of the cylinder and the head? Or can I use Injun head on it? Or something
else? This (or the above stuff) should keep you guys &amp; gals busy till Friday...
(And change the thread name please...)
