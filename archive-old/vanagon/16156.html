V&gt; Well, you don't say what year were dealing with, but here's a stab in the
 &gt; dark.  Are you turning up the dial that controls how cold the fridge temp
 &gt; gets?  I know this sounds dumb, but I think I'm even capable of this one. ;)
 &gt; When you're tired from driving and getting things set up, sometimes, you
 &gt; not thinking is not as clear, so you overlook little things like that.
 &gt; Other than that, if you got the pilot light going, I can't imagine why
 &gt; it would not cool down.

Well... Impossible to say for sure, as you read, there was a lot going on.
I'm going to make this my weekend project.

&gt; Don't you just love these Vanagons?

V&gt; Cause they give us lots to talk (and laugh) about.

Hah - I laugh now....

Thanks for the reply
