Martha,

I'm surprised you get this newsgroup: it's not as exciting as it sounds, 
though!  The 'van' in van.forsale is VANCOUVER (as in Vancouver, BC, 
specifically), not van as in Vanagon, Bus, or Econoline.  Sorry!

If anyone is interested in finding a bus in the Vancouver, BC, area, 
though, I've seen them posted occasionally in the newsgroup, though...
