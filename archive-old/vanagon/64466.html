&lt;&lt; Hey, I have that same airflow problem.  Where is the air flow meter
 located?
  &gt;&gt;
The air flow meter is under the drivers seat, next to the Fetzer Reticulation
Valve.  (Just kidding!)

To find your airflow meter, first locate your air cleaner (the box with your
air filter in it). ATTACHED to that box, acctually part of it, you will find
a strange-looking metal and plastic contraption, with a connection to your
Fuel Injection wiring harness (notice rubber boot covering connection). THAT
contraption is the airflow meter. Coming out the other side of the air flow
meter will be the big rubber tube that leads clean air into your throttle,
into your intake manifold, and into your engine to be turned into the fuel
air mix that makes for fun on the highway.

Back to the contraption. The 2.5&quot; x 2.5&quot; black plastic cover is the one in
question.

Pry that cover off with a pick ax, and pour in two quarts of Prestone, better
yet, make it 80w90 Quaker State. Better yet, don't pour anything in, refer
back to the postings of folks who have pryed of the cover and seen the Genie
who lives inside.
