Subject: FS:  Bentley Bus &amp; Vanagon Manuals

As some of you know, I sell Bus/Vanagon/Westy parts at the local VW 
shows. (I also periodically sell rust-free West Coast Westfalias 
here on the East Coast.  In fact, several listmembers are currently 
driving my busses.)

Anyway, I do stock Bentley manuals to sell at the shows and with my 
busses. Based on the recent thread about Bentley manual pricing, I 
think I can offer list members pricing that is competitive with the 
lowest prices I've seen mentioned - but, without the inflated 
&quot;shipping &amp; handling&quot; charges tacked on by JC Whitney, et al.  
Also, no sales tax if shipped outside of Pa. 

Prices are:
$66 for the Vanagon Factory Service manual, and 
$33 for the '68-79 Bus Factory Service manual.
Shipping would be $2.75 to the east coast and $4.50 to the west.
Usually shipped within 48-72 hours.

I don't take credit cards, but would accept personal checks from 
listmembers only.  COD is also an option, but it costs $4 more.
Make checks payable to either myself or Express Marketing, 619 
Layfield Rd., Perkiomenville, Pa. 18074.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
