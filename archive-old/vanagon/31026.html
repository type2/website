Subject: Re: best address for Drews?

OK Pat.

On the subject of car waxes for Maroon 90 Camper: I have tested many, many
formulations over a period of about five years and the best, longest
lasting, best looking wax I settled on is: 

Meguiar's Mirror Glaze #26 Hi-Tech Yellow Wax

This is easy to use and last about a year.

When your car has some light scratches or at least every year or two, before
applying the above, you should apply Mother's Pre-Wax Cleaner.

Some other formulations say &quot;Safe For Clearcoat&quot; but they contain fine
abrasives that show as tiny scratch-like streaks.
