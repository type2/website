I was just reading the latest VW Trends, and a couple things of interest came
up:

	They have a &quot;tech article&quot; (read &quot;ad&quot;) for a 5 speed type I trans for
under $1,000, which sounded interesting.  Anyone who's ever been in an early 
bus on the freeway will know what I mean.

	The writing style has degenerated even further.  Some articles (like the
one on the 23 window bus) appear to be targeted to people who have no idea
what a VW is!

	There is a article about racing Type I's, which was kinda interesting, if
poorly written.

	Dan Bedwetter threatens to give the entire world the addresses of these
lists in the next issue.
