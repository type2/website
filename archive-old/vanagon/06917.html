&gt; &gt; Finally when the vehicle was in for emmissons tests, was told by reputable
&gt; &gt; VW mechanic that the full throttle setup is marginal at best. He said you
&gt; &gt; could remove the device and would not notice the difference. I tend to
&gt; &gt; agree with him, at full throttle the difference is negligible; and yes the
&gt; &gt; switch is properly adjusted to the cam.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Conclusion - still unclear what the full throttle switch is intended to do
&gt; &gt; : advance the curve, richen the mixture or a combination; believe that is
&gt; &gt; not crucial but nevertheless a problem.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One solution - glancing through Bentley's at the bookstore; they have
&gt; &gt;  a detailed description of adjusting and testing the full throttle switch
&gt; &gt; and black box - this would be my next step....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps some one out there can throw some light on the issue (PhD's not
&gt; &gt; required).....DC
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   I am always a little specualtive when mechanics start on the &quot;those engineers
&gt;   at the factory don't know what they're doing&quot; - I doubt VW would have gone to
&gt;   the expense of including the full throttle switch if it wasn't necessary. My
&gt;   recollection of it's function (I'm at work and can't look it up) is that it
&gt;   tells the computer to richen up the mixture at full throttle. This may not
&gt;   result in more power but it may help keep peak temperatures and detonation
&gt;   under control. I'd try and keep it working, if possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Einspritzerly yours,

OK but can you tell us how to test it? The Hayne's is unclear and even
though i have replaced the &quot;black box&quot; it still seems to make little
noticeable difference. Your idea of peak temps is interesting though.
Earlier I had asked if removing the EGR would be detrimental, after all it
also reduces peak temps by inserting inert gas into the combustion chamber
no consensus on that one either ------DC
