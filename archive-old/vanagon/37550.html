Maybe, but I bet I know why they designed it that way.  When your right
foot is on the gas pedal and you need to step on the brake FAST, the distance
your foot has to travel to get to the brake pedal becomes reeeeal important.
In Europe, where driving is a skill rather than a mental background
process, this is great.  Even here, it might have saved a few lives -
who knows.
