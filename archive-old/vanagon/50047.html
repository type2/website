Subject: Re: gas heater transplant from '78 bus to '81 vanagon?



&gt;Hi folks -- I have access to a gas heater in a '78 (or so) bus
&gt;for a reasonable price, and have thought about putting it in my
&gt;'81 Vanagon.  How similar are the two installations?  Anyone
&gt;know?

The late bus and early Vanagon use the same gas heater (the BA6), and it 
installs in both VW's pretty much the same way. Some instructions/info are 
in the Vanagon Bentley manual.
