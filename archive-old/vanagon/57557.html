Subject: Idea for inexpensive exhaust with cat.

here is my idea.

i am NOT going to pay 500 some odd dollars for an exhaust system, but i
would like to have the ability to install a cat if need be (emissions
inspection.) and i have come up with a way to do this for under $200.00 i
think, unless someone can think of a reason this wont work.

i have an extractor that goes to one collector where the 3 hole standard
&quot;header&quot; bolt pattern flange is paralell to the passenger side of the
vehicle.  I could buy a universal cat, with these header flanges or weld
some on and basically bolt a cat in between the collector and the &quot;quiet&quot;
muffler that is sold with this setup.  if someone had a california car,
they could weld an o2 sensor into the collector just short of the cat,
where the header collects the exhaust all into one point.

the exhaust wouldnt stick out past the side of the car since these are
designed for bugs which are narrower bodied cars, so the 8-10 inches for a
cat wouldnt mess things up clearance wise, though i would need to fab a
bracket to hold the muffler up, since moving it 10 inches would impart a
lot of extra leverage on the connection flanges.

(and when you were &quot;off roading&quot; you could easily remove the cat in about
10 minutes for more power)

let me know if this sounds like a feasable plan for conforming with
emissions without breaking the bank.

take care,

steve
