Dan,

I wondered about this as well, until I broke into one and saw how they 
were put together.  There are a bunch of surface mount capacitors, 
staggered along the carbon path.  I'm assuming that what you see when you 
apply a DC voltage is these caps charging up and discharging and throwing 
the resistance readings all over the place.  

&gt; i've been TOLD this is the case.  measured and found this IS the 
&gt; case.  does having a voltage present align the carbon granules with 
&gt; forces of the universe causing obediance?  if so, could the same 
&gt; principle be used on recalcitrant co-workers?

No.

2x4s are the only known force shy of very large handguns to accomplish 
such cosmic happenings.
