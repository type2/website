Subject: 89 Syncro for sale


Saw this in today's paper.  I don't know the owner, so deal direct.  I'll 
be glad to go look it over for anyone that's interested.  It's located in 
Fort Collins, Colorado, about an hour north of Denver.


VW Syncro Vanagon 1989.  115k miles.  Excellent condition.  A/C, tape 
deck, PS, PL, PW.  Asking $10k.  (970)221-9124.
