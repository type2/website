&gt;Yeah!!! Thats a GREAT Idea for MN.  Maybe I'll just take a length of the
&gt;heater hose and wrap it around the wiper fluid tank?

you know ... that might not be such a crazy idea at all. if you just moved
the wiper fluid tank over behind the radiator, in that area above the spare
tire ... wouldn't it get warm enough to do some good?  but down here in the
Hot Humid South, it might start boiling in the summer! :)

wonder if the plastic of the wiper fluid tank would stand up to being
directly next to/on to of  a coolant hose. maybe the return hose from the
radiator (after the coolant has dropped a few degrees). or you could make
up your own copper tank! :)

hmmmmmmmm.
