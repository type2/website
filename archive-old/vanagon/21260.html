Subject:  Seeking '72 Westy hammock 

I'm looking for the hammock (don't know what else you'd call it) that 
fits over the front seats in a '72 Westphalia.

Currently there are two holes in each A pillar, and two others in each B 
pillar.  I'm told that this thing fits in these holes, but beyond that, 
I'm at a loss.

Suggestions, anyone?
