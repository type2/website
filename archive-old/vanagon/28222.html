&gt;  &gt; While rotating the tires on the '85, I found this metal thing in the bag
&gt;  &gt; with the jack.  It is marked &quot;10&quot; at one end &quot;13&quot; at the other.  Is this a 
&gt;  &gt; wrench?  Or is it some kind of magic de-tighten und unloosen device from
&gt;  &gt; VW-GMbH?
&gt; 
     
It's actually a special tool you need to use to activate the round 
silver metal thing that's located on the dashboard of the Vanagons.
