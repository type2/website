Subject: Re(2): Re(2): Towing a Syncro

Jim,

The best method, I would think, would be to tow the Sycnro  using a Flatbed,
where none of the wheels are moving.  But in a pinch, if I had to use a tow bar,
with all wheels on the ground, would it be O.K to just put it in neutral, with
the VC still connecting the front and rear wheels?  If I were to prepare for a
trip to pull a Syncro using a tow bar (say 1000 miles), would it be worthwhile
to disconnect the driveshaft or other normally connected drive parts, like
universal joints?  What would be the best method to disconnect the driveshafts?

Thanks,

Charles
