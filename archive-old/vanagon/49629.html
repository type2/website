Subject: CCC's Livermore/Altamont meeting place


Ron Coyote Lussier tells me that this place should be evident to find.
He think it MAY be somehow related to a place to test brakes.  It's
probably a rest area of sorts, and I&quot;m guessing at or near the summit
of Altamont Pass.  Plan is to meet there at 7 p.m. Thursday evening.
We'll have a small grace period for stragglers.  Turn your CB's
to channel 2 for us to find each other.  See you there.
