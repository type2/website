Subject: My weekend

All,

As you may recall, I purchased my Westy with a bad clutch. Well this
past weekend, Martin G (don't know your last name though) pulled the
engine to change the clutch, and to check out the oil cooler which is
leaking.  Since it was the first time for me to pull an engine, and the
first time for Martin to pull this type of engine, it took a little
longer than planned, but not as long as it would have taken 2
unexperienced people to do it :-).  We got the engine out, and on the
ground, and removed the pressure plate. When it came off, a pile of
asbestos dust was all that was left. When we went to replace the Throw
out bearing the sleeve that it rides on was bent out of shape.  Since it
is made out of plastic, it was melted, probably when the clutch finally
let go, it got hot enough to melt it.  This was around 5 pm saturday.
Martin went to the FLAPS, and quickly found that it was not listed in
any of the books. He then call around and found that none of the Parts
stores carry this part (we even had the part number, as it is stamped on
the part).  This morning I called Austin VeeDub, and as soon as I began
to decribe the part he knew what it was. I went and got one.  It is made
out of metal.  Tomorrow I start to break down the engine so I can get to
the oil cooler. We ran out of time on Saturday, and it rained sunday,
and this morning, and I do not have a garage to work out of :-(.
Hopefully I will be dry tomorrow and I can get some work done.

Martin, I have your flywheel lock, let me know when you want it back.

Cheers,

David
