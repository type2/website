&gt;By the way, the best price I could find for a replacement mirror (glass only)
&gt;was $20.  Anyone else bought one for a better price? (go ahead...break my
&gt;heart).

i think i still have an old right side non-power mirror. $10? i already sold
the drivers side to a guy in oregon.  lemme know if you want it. i'll check
and make sure, but i'm pretty certain the only one remaining is the right
side. :)
