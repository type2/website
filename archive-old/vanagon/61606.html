Hey folks....

For those interested, i can possibly arrange to get a trial version 
(complete, good for 30 days, all legal...) (for testing purposes, law 
allows for you to try a copy of any software before you purchase it, (US 
law, anyhow..) for up to 30 days...) of Need for Speed II, for IBM-clone 
platforms...(maybe others, not sure..)

If anyone is interested, email me OFF LIST, at xi8940_at_freenet.tlh.fl_dot_us
