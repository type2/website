Subject: Fuel Filter

Hey guys,

Went to change the fuel filter and noticed the replacement was half the
diameter of the original.  The filter I bought is a Purolator F60146, it
cross references withm the AC GF538, Fram G3829, Wix 33161.

Could someone let me know if this is the right filter, Pep Boys says it
should work, but then again thats Pep Boys we're talkin about here.

Thanks
