Subject: Re: (Fuel filter) What a Long Strange Trip It's Been 

Charles-

Sounds like a good trip (breakingdown but making it through with the
road-side repair always makes for more excitement, increases the hero
feeling)

I've got the same wierd two filter set up on my 83.5 westie.  If you look at
the Bently this matches the set up for the Digifant fuel set-up, but I am
pretty sure I have a Digijet (aren't all 83-85 H20 boxers Digijet) which says
to have either one or the other.  I've had it suggested to me that somebody
was having trouble with the silver tube gettin' clogged so tried to extend
the life of it with the little plastic filter.  I've had the same results
looking at NAPA for parts, but what's wierd if you go to Grand or Kragen and
look it up in the Fram guide it only show the plastic one for 83.5 and the
metal one for 86 and up.  It has confounded me as well.  I would like to get
it straighted out, I don't want to be putting undo strain on my fuel pump or
be messing with the injection by having to much resistance in the lines.  

Your the second person I've known of who tows a motorbike, my friend Thomas
had a green late 70's breadloaf westie (Country Home) on which he towed a
pretty good sized dirt bike, I think he got as much as 20 mpg on his after he
rebuilt the breadloaf's engine!  

Good luck, let me know if you solve the fuel filter wierdness,
