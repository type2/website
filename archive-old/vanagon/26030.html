&gt; face.  It seems the person who gave me permission to use the space did not
&gt; have that right and in some strange way the outcome of the Simpsom trial and
&gt; the hippie nature of Grendel's paint job and my being from California
&gt; combined to trigger a strange rage that could only be satisfied by a petty

Bob-
i am so sorry to hear this... it angers me that people do such acts 
when someone is obviously in need.  one develops an almost false 
sense of mankind when we expect others to treat us as we would treat 
them.  i know you're getting a outpouring of support from the list at 
this moment but that doesn't replace the shop facilities.  do what 
you have to do to get home but i know we'd all like to see you beat 
this thing.  if you can, get Grendel home and burn her in effigy at 
the next vanagon get-together.

maybe it's time to play your trump card.  you mentioned strained host 
relations...  i think an outpouring of gifts from around the country 
to your host's home, maple syrup or wild rice from Minnesota, possum 
steaks from Alabama, etc. may be in order.  just an idea.  you know 
what's best.
