&gt;What the !_at_#$%^! is a bay window?

1. A 1968-1979 bus.  2. The windshield of a 1968-1979 bus.

&gt;Regarding the who owns the Earth comments, I saw a good sign up at a
&gt;Sugarbush I visited last weekend. &quot;We didn't inherit the forest from

Seen on a logger's T-shirt:

	Back:  We'll log the other planets later!

Peace,
Rodney
