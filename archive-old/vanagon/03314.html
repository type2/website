Split Fires???? If you are going to piss your money over the fence...
send it to me!!!! There IS no difference between regular plugs and
Split Fire plugs...what the commercials don't tell you is the comparisons
made are between an engine that needs a tune up and then the same engine
AFTER a tune up.

Multi electrode plugs are nothing new. Aircraft plugs are multi electrode
as are the plugs used since '85 by VW in GTIs, etc.


As to Thrush mufflers, all they are are a low restriction muffler or
glass pack that you put in place of your 'mericun muffler....they
don't work on the Vanagon. All they are is basically a tin can wth
the appropriate lenght of pipe attached to fit an exhaust system.

If you wan't performance, then you will have to look for an 
extractor system designed for your PARTICULAR application. A
muffler/glasspack alone is not going to do it.
