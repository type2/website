Subject: Gas Prices.......

Here in Houston the prices are just as bad as anywhere else. I'm paying from
$1.30 to $1.49 a gallon depending on the station which is pretty ironic
considering the fact that most of the gas produced in the part of the country
is made only 15-20 miles away from where I live. Maybe shipping doesn't
factor into the cost as much as you would think.
