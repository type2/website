Subject: CS diesel block with turbo-charger

Brent:

        Do I understand you correctly, that you have added  Quantum
intake and exhaust manifolds together with the turbocharger, to your
48 horsepower, CS diesel long block? ? ?

        If so, I hate to rain on your parade, but you will be in for bigtime
problems, if you have not already experienced them.

        The main problem is the heat dissapation problems associated 
with the much hotter running pistons.  The CY and MD turbo-diesel 
blocks that were used in the Quantum had cooling jets installed that
spray oil up onto the underside of the pistons cooling them enough to
draw off the severe heat.

        The Bentley manual also states that the head of the turbo-diesel
is made of stouter stuff, with changes to the valve material, too.

        Have you had your Vanagon out for a prolonged drive at say
60 mph (100 kph) ?  Any compression or ring problems to date?
Maybe if you're using synthetic oil, you can get away with murder,
(for a while longer anyway).

        My Vanagon is turbo-charged, but I used the whole CY block
and TD head.  I haven't had problems.  I knew of a fellow with a Jetta 
TD who needed an engine job.  He just put in a non-turbo block (without 
the essential cooling jets) and bolted everything back up. Three months
later, the pistons were toast; compression fell, due to fouled rings.

        I hate to be pessimistic.  I hope your engine is still working fine.

        I'd be interested in your experiences.
