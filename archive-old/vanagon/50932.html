Subject: FS '81 Deluxe Westy $2800

I'm considering selling the '81 I will list its pro's and con's

The good:

-Brand New (&lt;5000 mile) AVP rebuilt 2.0 liter.
-Tranny Replaced by PO from a &quot;low mile&quot; van (I only know that it is
indeed replaced as it is marked by a junyard as an '82) oil looked
clean when I changed it, does not leak.
-Clutch Hydraulic System rebuilt (wonderful pedal feel now)
-New brakes shoes and pads all round
-All camping stuff present, deluxe trim level, ie propane stove,
12/110/LPG fridge
-Canvas very nice (1-2 teeny holes by latch), poptop seal good
-All fuel lines replaced when I installed motor
-New engine seal, coil, cap, rotor
-Heater boxes fair, solid but flanges in bad shape
-flapper boxes solid
-Front end rebuilt by PO (some true at least)
-4 good tires but not reinforced, seem OK though

The bad:

-Propane seems to leak? to where? or the idiot I had fill it
just didn't know how to fill.
-Have not been able to start the fridge on LPG perhaps for
above reason, PO claimed it was overhauled this summer.
-Monza exhaust interfered with heater so he removed heater
parts I have restored with custom fabbed and functional
replacements, exhaust solid though, but cat long gone.
-Interior good/fair really cut up for speaker installation, now
removed, not really bad looking just annoying.
-cargo carpet fair
-Rear bed reupholstered in odd, but OK looking manner (professional)

The ugly:

This van has been hit on every single panel except the drivers door.
Some are minor some not so, both rear fender areas pretty trashed,
rear left panel caved a bit, left side seam rust, sliding door
swiped, minor dings in passenger and rear hatch, nose swiped a bit

BUT the only true through rust is behind the front bumper the rest
is actually solid and from a distance not noticeable.  In fact the
paint is holding up beautifully and no rust around windows.

I paid $600, engine was $1600 as core was damaged, I have about
$400 more in incidentals likely and a lot of labor, so make me an
offer.  This is a real solid runing vehicle just not incredibly
beautiful, and if you do your own bodywork, really not that bad,
or one could just leave it.  I will likely sandblast and epoxy prime
the problem areas to stop their progression.  I am severly interested
in Erik O's Syncro and this is prompting my sale.
