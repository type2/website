It's not Massachusetts, but it does fall into the &quot;far and wide&quot; category: 
 
I saw a 1993 Eurovan MV at Central VW in Richardson, Texas ('burb of Dallas) 
+/- 35,000 miles, blue, VW 12 month/12,000 warranty.  AC, ABS, curtains, small 
table, bed, etc.  +/- $15,900.00 
 
Haven't checked it out or driven it.  We bought an EV GL from them last week 
and liked the dealership and our salesman was good (Kermit Thompson).  Liked 
the warranty (good at any VW dealership). 
 
Phone (214) 231-4691 
 
Happy hunting, 
Chris L. Miller
