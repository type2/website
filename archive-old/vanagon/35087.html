Subject: 72 camper mystery parts

Hello,

        I have just opened up the back (very rusty latch) of my 72 camper
and found a canvas roll with 2 brackets.  I found where they go - above the
front seats, but What Are They For???  Looks too light weight to be a child
bed, and too much good engineering for just a storage shelf.  It appears I
am the first person to even unwrap these puppies.
        Also, the engine (1700 Type IV) had been rebuilt and when I went to
time it, there was no mark on either the block or the pulley/crankshaft.
Any clues?  The only anamoly I found on the pulley was a small area with 2
flat spots about 1/2 inch apart.  I &quot;timed&quot; it to that and a bolt that I can
see in the Haynes manual.  I would rather not find TDC by poking something
in number 1.  Was TDC aligned in any way with one of the 3 allen head bolts
on the fan?  And if so, where on the block would the mark be?  
        I took the bus out for a &quot;spin&quot; yesterday, and the steering is
pretty awful - will need to replace all the tierod ends, I think.  Did
replace the drag link (one was kindly left in the bus!), but now I can't get
it to run long enough to play with the timing.  I think the choke is a
little light on the Holley (Weber) progressive, so will play with that.
It's lots of fun, what with all the controls for that carb pointing to the
front!
        Thanks for listening.  I look forward to being able to post some
help for following new members.
