Subject: RE: Inquiry: Las Vegas VW Stuff??

Here is an exerpt from my trip report last fall, when we had suspiscious
CV noise in the desert (the rest is in the archives):


August 28: Top off the water, fuel and propane, and head over to the 
Beetle Barn.  This is a GREAT place, a combo junkyard/shop/used car sales, 
all VW. About 2 acres of dry country cars...they knew exactly what I was 
asking for, did all the CVs and had us out of the super clean shop in 1/2 
an hour, and the total bill was about $21.00.  Did not hear the slightest 
bump for the rest of the trip.


The are in the phone book, located on the north east edge of town.
Tell'em the guy in the silver syncro westie with oregon plates
told you to stop by, and that he made it safely to Washington DC...
