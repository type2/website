&gt; vaccum.  the other goes to the carb?  There are 2 hose connections on the

&gt; Thanks

On both my VW's, this thing is still hooked up.  I have never run the cars
without it, so I don't know what the effect would be.  The connection is
from a fitting at the bottom of the carb to one side of the operating
mechanism (with the adjustable rod going to the carb linkage).  The other
side of this mechanism goes to the control unit (also called the altitude
corrector) mounted on the left side of the engine compartment.  This thing
controls how fast the throttle closes.  The other side of the control unit
goes to a port on the intake manifold.

Hope this helps!
