Subject: VW Alloy Wheels

One more question for those of us moving to the Alloys-

	If you upgrade to Alloy wheels for the 4 on the ground, what does that
mean for the spare? Can I simply continue to use the steel wheel that is the
standard spare, but with different bolts that spin on further?

&gt; With all this talk about Alloy wheels, I would like to ask one question -
&gt;
&gt; Is there any problem with or adjustment needed when putting standard VW
&gt; Westfalia Alloy wheels on a VW that came with steel wheels?
&gt;
&gt; I am purchasing a '91 Westfalia with standard steel wheels and am planning to
&gt; upgrade to VW Alloys that were an option for that year. I was assuming that
&gt; this would be 'easy' but discussion on this list has me nervous now!
