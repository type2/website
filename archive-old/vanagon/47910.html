&gt; So a 'loafer, a splitty owner and a vana-goner walk into a bar. The 'loafer

&quot;Beer&quot;. The bartender serves them three beers. The barstools make
a funny scrunchy sound as the three sit. They exchange looks. 
&quot;Oh that&quot;, says the bartender, &quot;Activated charcoal seat cushions.
They're the latest thing.&quot;  The splittie owner stands up and
says &quot;I don't need any emissions equipment!&quot;

&quot;Beer&quot;. The bartender asks. &quot;Which one of you drives that beautiful
split-window?&quot; &quot;Me&quot;, says the splittie owner. The bartender serves
her a beer with a big foamy head. &quot;And which one of you drives the 
late model Vanagon?&quot; &quot;Me&quot; says the vana-goner. The bartender carefully
fills a glass, making amost no foam, then gently inserts four straws
and serves it to the vana-goner. &quot;75!&quot; says the 'loafer. &quot;Gotcha!&quot;
says the bartender, smiling, and serves the 'loafer two beers!

&quot;Three beers, but put a little ice in once of them- the vana-goner
is water cooled!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Three beers, and two glasses&quot;. The bartender serves three bottles of
beer and places two glasses between them. The 'loafer and vana-goner
pour their beer into glasses and drink. The splitie owner is vibrating
slightly but manages to get the bottle up to his lips and drinks deeply.
&quot;Good call&quot;, says the bartender, &quot;What happened to your friend?&quot;
&quot;He's been like that ever since we converted him to 12 volts&quot;, says the 
'loafer!
