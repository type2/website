Subject: VWs and we're off to Bolivia

Earlier last week, I found myself in a strange situation. I was being
interviewed for a three year research position, including one year of field
work in a village in Bolivia. By all accounts it is a perfect job: good
benefits, security, great research topic, and so one. The frightening part
of this experience was that while I was being interviewed for a position
which is to change my and my family's lives, a calm creeped over me as two
thoughts entered my head. The first was what would the altitude correction
be on a solex carb at 3,000 meters, and the second, could we continue
Torbin's epic and drive to the southern tip of America.
 I'll  be in Bolivia for one month fall, and then one whole year beginning
in Easter. What do you think, are the logistics possible? Do others want to
join this crazy idea? If  reliable shipping can be found from the USA to
either Columbia or Venezuela, how long might it take to drive down the back
bone of South America?
 Unlike my earlier blitz to Costa Rica last month, this Bolivian project is
to be set at a calmer pace, so as events unfold, I'll try to post more info
on routes, access and so on.
My first goal, after orientating myself with the project and its related
components in Ecuador and Peru is to try and find a sound westy. Anyone had
South American hunting experiences they might like to share with me. As I
stand now, I have no idea of the availability of VWs in Bolivia, costs etc.
