&gt;Crusing rec.autos.vw, there was a message about how the oil galley plugs would
&gt;-- pop out of someone's 82 vanagon during a cold start. Someone mentioned
&gt;this might be due to hot/cold cycles and/or overheating. So fill me in, I
&gt;have never heard of these plugs. Where are they? What do they look like?
&gt;and what happens if they pop out? Any experiences/information would be
&gt;helpful...TIA - DC

i think what he is talking about are the plugs used to seal off the ends of
the oil channels ... since they can't drill a curved oil channel, two
intersecting holes are drilled and one hole in the case is sealed off with
a force-fit plug. on water-cooled cars, a &quot;Freeze-plug&quot; in the water jacket
passages is somewhat similar.

now, on the 82 vanagon, look onthe engine where the oil filter holder bolts
on. on the back side of that little 'bump', there are two 'plug' looking
thingies.  i think those are what he's talking about.

if they pop out (due to extremely high oil pressure), then you lose all of
your oil very quickly. :(  but i've NEVER heard of one popping out. and i
would think that the pressure required to blow that plug out would have
already split the filter and damaged a few other things ... before the plug
let go.

unless someone has drilled out the original plug and tried to 'fix' it.
i supposed it's possible that someone drilled it out, tried to put a gauge
sender or oil cooler outlet, then changed their minds and tried to make it
back to 'normal'. in that case, all bets are off.
