Subject: Re: westfalia top retro

gary:

you neglected to mention if the 79' bus already has the hole in the roof.
Putting a pop top on isn't the smallest undertaking. There was a post a few
days a go about a fellow wanting to do a roof swap from a 69 to his 70 (no
hole cut in roof of van). Maybe you should try and find that posting.

&gt;Hi I'm new here.I own a 1979 bus. I was considering retro fiting a
&gt;westfalia top from a 1971 bus. The guy wants $100 canadian for the
&gt;top. Has anybody done this before? Is it a pain? Is it worth it.
&gt;thank you for your help
