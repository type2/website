Subject: CREW CAB DROP GATES

For the past couple months I've been cruising the net and running up a phone
bill calling VW salvage yards that advertise in various pubs looking for a
driver's side drop gate for my '71 crew cab resto project.  Mostly the
response I get is &quot;yeah right, good luck finding those things.&quot;   Then I
look at pictures from shows (especially out there in sunny California) and I
KNOW that I see at least several very fine double cabs (with very nice drop
gates I might add) and I'm wondering &quot;where in the $%&amp;_at__at_! do these folks get
those gates?&quot;  So I'm asking, PALEEEEZ, can someone give me a lead on a drop
gate that?  

Also, what year crew cabs are candidates as a gate donor ('68 thru ??)?


Thanks!

Bob ('68 Beetle vert and '71 Crew Cab resto project)
