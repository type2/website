Subject: RE: Is this your Synchro?

YUP... 'at's my beast...  The awning was from the Westfalia store in Frankfurt, 
so you'd have to commute a bit to find another one.  It does have its drawbacks 
but in the larger scheme of life, it is a real nice commodity....   &lt;grin&gt;.  
Where, pray tell, did you see that other (Red) Syncro Westie?  There's at least 
one Grey, one Red, one Blue, and one other White Syncro in our immediate area 
that I have seen before....

 The white Synchro with the snazzy grill was spotted in the parking lot in
 front of the San Antonio Hobby Shop - a favorite store of my kids and 
 recipients of much of the family's discretionary spending- This Vanagon also
 had a very nice awning. If it's yours, I'm envious &lt;Thou shalt not covet thy
 neighbors Vanagon.....Ferdinand II:IV&gt;. 

 The red one definitly did not have the stock grill. It was way narrower. Has
 anyone else in BABA seen this Synchro?
