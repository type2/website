Subject: Old messages being sent out

Some of you will receive messages from September 11th and 12th that were 
never sent out.  They ended up in a strange place being held, so I'm 
going to send them.

List news: We will now be seeing few (if any) messages reposted by me to 
the list. I've rebuilt listproc with a more robust checksum routine 
(md5) and it should solve the problem of listserv thinking that messages 
are dupes when they're not.
