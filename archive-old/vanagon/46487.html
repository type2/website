Subject: Re: Riviera Campwagen (was Change the Stats)


&gt; What it is is a 1977 Riviera Campwagen.  I've never heard
&gt;of it before, but I think I like it better than a Westfalia. 
&gt;Has anyone ever heard of a Riviera Campwagen before?  Made by 
&gt;Automotive Services Inc., Vancouver, WA.  The warranty says that 
&gt;any claims will be handled by VW so... (Yeah, it came with a bunch 

&gt;of the original documentation.)

I recently purchased 2 Riviera Campwagens. One was a '77 from 
California, the other a '78 from Alabama that was built on a 
Champaigne Edition bus (brown dash, clock, chrome bumpers, etc.).  
They are outfitted slightly differently (if you read the manual, 
there are many different options available).  For example, the '77 
has only an icebox, while the '78 has a fridge. Neither has the 
optional forced air furnace.  Both are missing the original toilet. 

One feature that I really like on the Rivieras is the front 
curtains, which when opened are found behind each front door.  When 
you close them, each curtain goes across one front door and halfway 
across the windshield, where they snap together.  This is easier 
that the snap-on Westfalia curtain, because you don't have to 
remove them entirely when driving and they simply slide on a rail 
rather than attaching with a dozen different snaps.  Also, the 
cutting board that fits over the sink is a nice touch.
