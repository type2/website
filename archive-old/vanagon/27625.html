Subject: Vanagon with Chevy V6


Well, I've done the deed-- purchased another VW. This one is an '80 Vanagon,
with a 2800cc Chevrolet V6 from a Citation, installed with a Kennedy
adapter, flywheel, etc. Reputed to run well, tho the clutch is dead,
so I';ve taken a lot on faith here. The seller promises a refund if
anything turns out seriously wrong with the engine or tranny. He's
putting in a new clutch even as we speak (uses the original VW clutch),
so then we'll see.

The bad news is, it's in Missouri, and I'm in San Diego. So we're looking
at a mini-Grendel adventure here. Hopefully VERY mini-- I frankly
cannot do what Bob Hoover did, even if I had the time, which I don't.
A nice, easy two- or three-day cruise home, is what I'm praying for,
after flying there on a Friday. I'll bring a good assortment of tools
and blocks, just in case, and pick up a good supply of oil and antifreeze
(that's that green stuff that is alien to pre-84 VW bricks).

Anyone have any advice on routes to follow? I'd like to take it as easy
as possible, meaning no cloud-brushing mountain passes with long, steep
uphill grades. Yeah, I know, this thing should rip right up them, but it
is still a very unknown vehicle to me. I want to treat it with kid gloves
at least until I get it home.

Route choices seem to be mostly I-40, I-20, I-10-- and later I-8 in
Arizona if/when I get that far. Anybody have experience with these roads
between Mizzou and California? Suggestions on routes to take or avoid?
Advice on any chronic ailments to watch out for in '80 Vanagons (aside
from engine, of course)?

Thanks in advance! California or Bust!
