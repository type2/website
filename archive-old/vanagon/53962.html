Subject: Hello again, Brakes, No-Start, Coolant bleeder, 1985 GL

Hello Vanagoons,

        Yes, I have been straying from the fold the last year, but my heart
has been with you all, i still wear my VW sticker on my bus proudly.

        Recently, i had all my brake pads and shoes replaced, also replaced
was my right front caliper, because it was dragging.  My system and master
cylinder was supposedly bled but my brakes are not performing to my liking.  
        When pressing the pedal initially it goes to the floor with almost
no resistance and then i hit a hard part and the van will begin to slow down.
        If i pump the pedal 1 or 2 times before pressing it is perfectly
stiff and stopping time is small, an ideal braking situation.  

By the way my van is automatic no brake fluid in the clutch to worry about.  

is there anything i can do to fix this?

Another problem i have been experiencing since purchase about 1.5 years ago
is the No-start symptoms.  This happens at any temperature, but more
frequently when it is cold outside.  I turn the key and all i hear is a
slight hum, which i think is the fuel pump.  Sometimes if i hold the key on
for awhile it will finally turn over and start.  If this doesn't work,
usually waiting 20 min or so will work.  The battery is fine, brand new.  Is
the solution the Ford solenoid?  where can i find the details on this?

As far as helping bleed the coolant system, i was thinking of consulting a
machine shop to have a metric elbow made which i could attach a small brass
plumbing valve to which would make bleeding the system easier.  Any comments?

My 1985 Vanagon is approaching 100k miles with me at the wheel with my
fingers crossed.
