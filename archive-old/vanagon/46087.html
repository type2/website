Concerning oil-
Check out the most recent Consumers Reports (USA).
Big report on oil. Conclusions: Any oil that meets the AST or 
whatever the acronym is standard US, works the same.  No noticable 
differences.  Tested taxi's in New York City for zillions of miles.  
The most important thing is to change it.  They recommend at 
max of 7500 miles or whatever the owners manual states.  
Don't know if Kendal was tested thorugh.
