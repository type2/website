&gt; All,

&gt; Made some calls this morning.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Maybe VW is pullin' my leg again...

&gt; Brian.

Thanks for the research.  Maybe there is some hope that some
machine-readable information could be forthcoming in one
format or another.

It never ceases to amaze me that VW holds so tightly to
information which could keep their vehicles on the road.
Not only is it good advertising, but testament to their
product quality that the old ones are still going, yet they
seem to want to do anything possible to discourage anything
but buying new product from them.

A few years ago VW produced and distributed a list of the
LAST air-cooled inventory they had available.  I have to
assume that there is very little VW-produced material still
available to us as owners of vintage VWs (directly from VW,
that is), yet they remain steadfastly against the
information falling into the &quot;wrong hands.&quot;

Wouldn't it be nice to log on to a web site, browse through
the diagrams and parts cross-references to find out what
part you actually need, and ORDER it from VW!  Instead we
are at the mercy of the parts man from ABC Motors who
doesn't know a Type II from a typewriter and is repeating
&quot;Vanawhat?&quot; while we describe the part we need.

VW made it in the U.S. because they had a parts and service
network along with the sales department.  Now, I think,
they're too busy pulling something, but I don't think it's
your leg.
