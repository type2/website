Subject: RE: Window tinting

Larry MacPhee has seen bad tinting jobs on van windows and would rather wear
shades.  Depending on what you're doing in your untinted van, people outside
may be much more interested than they would if the windows were dark.  
Especially if you wear shades all the while.

Window tinting rewards experience and prep time like anything else, but I
think it looks great and it doesn't take special tools.  It's always among
the first things I do to a newly acquired van.  Keeps it a little cooler in
summer as well.
