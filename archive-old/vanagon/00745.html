Subject: BJ front end on '67

Hello,
I'm considering putting a ball-joint front suspension from a '68 or later
bus on my '67.  Several people have told me they're 99% sure it's a bolt-on.

My questions are:

1. Does anybody have reason to believe it ISN'T a bolt-on (I'd like to hear
   other people's horror stories before having more of my own)

2. Where can I get such a front suspension in the Northeast?

I'm unemployed so I'm poor (and thus can't afford the $300 that a new king
pin set cost back when they were available, which they aren't), but I have
lots of free time so if it actually takes a little cutting/welding I have
nothing better to do...  Most of my local junkyards crush buses on sight,
since they're all rust buckets (not that mine isn't...).

Thanks,   John
