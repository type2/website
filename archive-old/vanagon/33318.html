Subject: Custom graphics? (was CA license plate)

Dear Friends:

The recent thread on the CA license plate got my rusty wheels a turnin'...

In a former life, I worked for a advertising promotional materials company
doing custom vinyl graphics. We did *all kinds* of stuff -- not the least
of which was the signage for the grand opening of the Victoria's Secret in
Mall of America.

I left the place on good terms, so, if there was enough interest from the
group, I could look into what it would cost to produce stuff like &quot;VW&quot; or
&quot;Fahrvergnugen&quot; graphics or replacement &quot;Westfalia&quot; lettering, the name of
your company on the side -- whatever.

One material we worked with is designed to be applied to the inside surface
of glass. Once applied, the design looked like it was acid-etched into the
glass! Just think, the name of your beloved bus 'etched' into the back
window...

We were able to scan in practically any line art to do this, so if you had
something really special in mind, it might just work.

If you're interested, send me some e-mail -- probably shouldn't clog up
this wonderful list with it. I'm not sure what it would cost, because it's
been a few years since I did any of this stuff...

Hope I'm not stepping on any toes by posting this...

Jim.

I speak for myself and nobody else; they like it better that way.
