Thank you Rusty, Joel, and Scott for replying! Now here's the story and 
you won't be proud of me.. :-(

First of all, you should know that the friend I was trying to help has
been in Missouri for about a week now, with a pregnant wife and a young
kid, stranded without a car and completely worn down by the exceptionally
nasty weather (heat index at 105 F today and HUMID!). He wanted a car and
he wanted it fast! Not good. 

So we drove out to the dealer and once there, were told to wait because a
prospective buyer was test driving it. An hour later, he finally returns,
debates with the salesman for 10 minutes, then leaves. We politely waited
at a distance so as not to influence the outcome too much.  Salesshark
then meets us and says it's still available. 

Visual inspection reveals no rust whatsoever: a surprise in this salt
infested state. Inside is fine and clean.  86,000 miles. We test drive and
there's some major shimming. Right tire worn out on the outer edge. Van
pulls to the right when braking. A/C is blowing out hot air and the brakes
are mushy. 

When we return to the dealership, three more people are waiting in line
for a test-drive. Not good. (Is this a set-up?) I suggested to my friend
that if the dealer accepted to fix all the problems and throws in a 30-day
warranty, that he should offer $5,000. This *after* having an independent 
mechanic look it over. But the dealer, who is no longer talking to me, 
pressures my friend, telling him that, sure, he can have it checked 
somewhere else, but only if it's still available by tomorrow, because 
those people there waiting blablabla. 

So the friend starts the bid at $5,400 (telling me in German that he
doesn't want to look like a cheapskate--seriously :-O ). Anyway, the
haggling ends at $6,400. :-( But I made them add a provision that the
compression on all cylinders be at least 110 psi, or else the contract is
nul (dealer goes &quot;ps-what?&quot;). And they will fix the shimmies, brakes,
replace the front tires (I interjected: &quot;Michelin XZX reinforced!&quot; :-) but
they didn't seem to notice), replace the hatch struts, and recharge the
A/C. Voila. 

The friend is happy, I'm not. And I just hope there will be no
&quot;surprises.&quot; Somehow I feel responsible. 

Screwed in Missouri
