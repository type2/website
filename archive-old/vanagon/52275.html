&gt;	Hello...I'm a 15 year old who is interested in VWs.  What I am
&gt;planning on doing is buying a car in bad shape and then fix it up.  Of

&gt;will recieve my full license (write now I have my Restricted License).=20
First off, not to rain on your parade.. what are your mechanical and =
body work skills like? I really doubt that you will be able to restore a =
van that is in bad shape (as you describe it) and get it done within one =
year. There are people on this list who have been restoring their vans =
now for YEARS and are no where finished...



&gt;I've been doing a LOT of research into VW busses and bugs, but I prefer
&gt;the bus.  I do have one problem....I am assuming from what I have read
&gt;that there are different kinds of VW busses.  Which would you suggest =
to
&gt;be the best for me?  I heard that there was one (I believe it was =
called the &gt;camper) that came with a refrigerator, but I'm not sure.  =
So, if
&gt;anyone could fill me in on the different kinds that I might be
&gt;interested in, PLEASE DO...8)


If you have been doing the research that you claim to have done, you =
should have some idea what van is right for you. Unfortunately, we =
cannot give you advice on which van is right for you because your letter =
does not indicate anythign about YOU..other than you are 15 years old. =
What do you want the VW for? Transportation? Camping? Picking up girls? =
What?

&gt;	One last question, how much money should I expect to plunk into
&gt;this car?

Well, if you have about $15,000 or more you can pick up a Vanagon =
camper...if you have $100, you will probably be able to pick up what can =
be best described as a &quot;parts car&quot; which will take tons of time and =
money to rebuild. Quite frankly ANY restoration usually costs twice as =
much as you originally figure. I would say, based upon my experience, =
expect to spend about $5,000 or more by the time you buy your van, fix =
it up, etc...

Again, sorry for sounding less than &quot;positive&quot;, but this is the way it =
goes...
