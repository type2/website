&quot;I have one of
those small portable grills.  Do you want me to bring that?  I'm
NOT volunteering to do ALL the BBQing on it.  I think since everyone
is bringing their own meat (so to speak ;) ) that they can easily
cook their own so they can have it done to their own taste.  I
hope this is agreeable to everyone?...&quot;

Yes, Steve, if you don't mind, please bring it if it doesn't take
up a lot of space/weight.  There may in fact be BBQs there, but I
can't recall.  Certainly there were some fire rings, and we could
always just roast our pigeons/gulls on a stick over open flame  ;)

Definitely - BRING your own meat.

:)

Now, will anyone volunteer to man Steve's BBQ?
