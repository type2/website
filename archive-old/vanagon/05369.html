&gt;As for gelcoating, I wonder how this differs from paint. Is it harder or less
&gt;resistant to fading or more waterproof or something. What is the deal with
&gt;gelcoat. Why don't we paint our cars with it if it is so good?

Gelcoat is a special coating put on the fiberglass that must be anaerobically
cured.  It can then be painted like any other fiberglass part.  Most of
the fiberglass parts you buy aftermarkety are gel coated.
