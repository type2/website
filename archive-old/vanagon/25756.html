Subject:Oddities....my van is odd...


hey now,

took my van to a good vw mechanic who work outta his house. needed help with
timing...got it to about 8....way better than it was...she runs better now.
had him look at the carb...guess what? the PPO put the damn thing in wrong!
backwards i think..it's a weber and he put it so that the adjustment screws and
choke and all face the front of the van. the mechanic, Sean, just kinda looked
at it and shook his head. can't figure out how the ppo got the linkages in
and all that. so i'm gonna have him put it in right.

i found the vaccum hose...Richard had actually had shown it to me a while ago
but it didn't click. get this...the hose actually was in half...Sean couldn't
get the timing set perfectly cuz of the intake of air..so i go get some vacuum
hose and put it on....no problem there. then i can't get the van to idle. the
barkes are easier to push down...better than automatic! but the van won't idle.
runs perfectly on the road. it was dark by then so i just took one end of and
it idles now. any suggestions? i figure a) haveta adjust the carb since it was
prolly adjusted for the leak b) idle screw?

gonna hit the road today...me my van and a case of homebrew!

laters,
