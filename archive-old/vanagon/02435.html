&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	While I'm babbling on...
&gt; 
&gt; 	Anybody have any opinions as to the effectiveness
&gt; 	of the vanagon chin spoiler?
&gt; 

	Our Carat has one and it would be probably be a good snowcatcher
	if we lived where it snowed (Haven't used wife's Carat in winter at 
	Tahoe...). It also catches on steep driveways. Ouch!!

	BTW:  I can't tell if it improves handling or fuel-economy compared
	to the same vehicle without one, having only the sample-of-one.
