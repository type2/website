&gt; Out here in California, the label is required, as well as a stamping on the
&gt; tank every so often (I think 5 years) that the tank has been checked and
&gt; re-certified for use or they won't touch 'em, fill 'em, etc.  I know this
&gt; because we regularly have 20 gallon bottles filled for hot tank and other
&gt; uses in our shop (We don't have the luxury of natural gas out here in the
&gt; sticks in Northern Cal.).

Much as I hate to disagree with Jim, I have never had my tank checked
when getting it filled in California.  And it hasn't been inspected
ever, that I can see.  But, maybe I've just been getting lucky?  They
are religious about checking scuba tanks, though...
