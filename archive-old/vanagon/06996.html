&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Has anyone considered an anti-theft device for the diesel vanagons?
&gt; &gt;I mean, not an alarm, etc?  What options are there for these things?
&gt; 
&gt; I've found the best ant-theft device for busses is extensive rust, especially
&gt; in the rocker panels and roof.
&gt; 

Or convert it to diesel. :)
