Subject: Re: Speaking of Bosch Platinums...

Speaking of spark plugs, I just read an article in VW Motoring magazine 
about their long-term test Corrado G60. A set of plugs for this thing cost 
99.97 pounds. :-0 Ouch!!!! I only pay 3.50 for a set for my bus. A 
replacement for a cracked fog light lens cost another 100 quid. Not the 
whole thing, just the lens. It makes NOS parts for a barndoor bus look cheap.
