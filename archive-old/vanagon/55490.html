Subject: My Sliding door does not open?

Hi folks, I'm havingt trouble opening my sliding door! It seem that the
little wheel on the outside of the van is not running along the track like
it should. When I try to open the door the wheel falls of the track on the
inside side? Kinda a weird to explain. It seems to be very lose. I tryed to
take the panel off but it seems that u have to do more than take the two
screews off??? Can anyone help me with this.

Ps I hope I don't have to take the door off to replace that slider wheel?:(
