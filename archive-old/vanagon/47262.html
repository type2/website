Subject: Re: 79-84 Westy Wanted

Scott,

  I
live in Santa Cruz and work for the Volks Cafe.  I also sell VW parts 
through thr Internet.

  We (Volks Cafe) have an 81 or 82 Vanagon for sale.  It is a Country 
Homes camper instead of a Westfailia.  It has a brand new engine in it 
and we will be going over the rest of it prior to selling it to insure 
that we don't see it back in the near future.

  If this sounds like something you're interested in you can e-mail me 
at my Web site address or you can call me at the shop between 
9-1,(408)426-1432.

  Hope this is good news for you.
