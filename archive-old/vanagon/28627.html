Hah, way way wrong on the LandRovers.  The steel frame is immediately 
against the rear floor, which is aluminium. The body rocking, grit and 
salt/slush make an extermely corrosive environment (dissimilar metals react) 
 and the rear floors over the frame turn to white mush and pucker upwards.  
But the exterior panels don't perforate!   So.....  can we get the Mexican 
VW plant to stamp us some ALL aluminium loafs?? &lt;g&gt;   Tim Smith
