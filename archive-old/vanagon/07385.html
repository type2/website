&gt;&gt;&gt;I drove about 4 miles from work to that same darned bank machine, turned 
&gt;&gt;&gt;the van off briefly, and it refused to start again.  It sits there now as 
&gt;&gt;&gt;I wait for both of us to cool off.  Can anyone help?

&gt;I decided to switch gas!!! I switched from Arco to Shell. The problem hasn't
&gt;bothered me since then (for about 2 months now). Shell costs a lot more.
&gt;Ouch!!! It is about $.10 more per gallon here in San Jose.

My brother who had a '91 Camper said that once he didn't fill up with 
Supreme gas.  A little while later going down the highway the thing started 
running worse and worse.  He finally had to pull into another gas station 
and add some STP and Supreme.  Again  a little further down the highway he 
topped it off with more Supreme.  It sounds like at least that the '91 bus 
is very finicky about its food.
