Subject: Re: mech in northen VA

I have used Auto Motor und Sport in ALexandria several times. Lately I've
been a little displeased because they changed mechanics a little more than I
would like.  I really like getting to know a specific mechanic.  Their prices
were fair.

One place to stay away from.....the VW dealor.  In Norther VA, they change
mechanics like underware.  The only dealor I would consider in Northern VA is
Ray Burnette's in Arlington.  They have some reliable mechanics that have
some experience. 

I had a bad experience with my 85 westy and the Springfield VW.  I took the
van in for an electrical problem and found out the mechanic they assigned had
only been working on VWs for about a month (came from another dealorship
other than VW) and that he didn't know how to use a multi-meter for
diagnostics.  But, I digress....

I have done the fill &amp; flush many times on Vanagons.  If you (&amp; there was
someone else on the list interested) wanted, I would be willing to do it for
you.  I am involved in EMT school for the county which takes a lot of time,
but I'm sure we could work a schedule out.  I would be willing to teach as I
go.

BTW, anyone in the Norther VA area have a leak-down tester I can borrow?
