Subject: more Burn baby burn!

I guess I'm not out of the woods with my fridge...  Yes I can start it 
now but I've discovered that I only have one chance, at mose two.  I pump 
A four or five times then press the gas release valve &quot;b&quot; while hittingt 
the lighter &lt; also &quot;a&quot;&gt; once.  The fridge lights.  I was tryinmg to 
demonstrate this to my better half las night... I pumped 4 or 5 times, 
saw the pilot light was about to burst into proper operation, was 
distracted by better half's beauty, let the flame die... and do you think 
I could get that damn fridge to light... no way.  

Went to bed, got up, went out to try the lighting procedure and with no 
beauty to distract me it lit like a charm.   

So... after blowing the light the first time round... how in the hell do 
I light that thing.  I've tried everything!   I guess the secret is to do 
it right the first time!

Barry.
