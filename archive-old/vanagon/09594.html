Ric,

&gt; Hey, I'd be willing to get something together up here in New England...
&gt; maybe in Bahstin...or maybe out on Cape Cod? Remember its the off
&gt; season on the cape....the camping may suck because its cold...
&gt; there's lots of cheap rooms at the resorts...

I live in RI so I'd be interested in New England or specfically the
Cape. Even if my wife and 3 month old son don't want to make the trip,
I'd still be interested.
