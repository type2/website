Subject: H20 and power steering pipe replacement.

I figure a story on all this is warranted while fresh in my
mind as this was a trial of over 1 month of weekends to
get the $450 '85 back together and on the road.  The Van
as some may recall has $5000+ of reciepts '90 to now, new
heads, new PS rack, the main parts, and 75k miles.  It also
had  severly rusted coolant pipes and evil looking PS pipes,
and bad exhaust, with estimates of $2000 to fix motivating PO.
Well I lucked into a like new set of coolant pipes for $100
and the PS thrown in for $20.

Now a few initial words, the coolant pipes were much worse
than expected, back when the origional heads blew, they took
the expansion tank with them, and it was never noticed hence
the system had not been pressurized for 1+ years I guess.
There was no way in fact it would have held pressure.  At the
bend where the pipes go up toward the engine, they were
perforated on inspection from their insides and the rust holding
them together could be removed by prodding with a screwdriver
all the way through.

Now there is a bit of trick to these even though it appears a
straightforward operation.

1. remove fuel tank, this is a bit of an SOB with all the vent
lines filler tube, etc but is basically a drain, unbolt, lower sort
of operation.  When replacing a good time for new lines all
round of course.

2. Remove right driveshaft, remove all tin around engine, this
will improve acess and as I was also doing exhaust seemed
prudent.

3. remove big hoses at ends and drain system.  Drain PS
system in an appropriate place as well.

4. remove all the clamping straps across the tubes and the
unbend ones holding the PS tube bushings.  Remove all hoses
from each end.

5. Here it gets tricky, you can fight trying to get the tubes out
forever if you don't get the correct angle, with the correct angle
they will slide in/out side by side in about a second.  The
problem is due to the fact they go through the one hole in the
frame, then curve up above the fuel tank and up at the back
end.  BUT if you remove the right rear parking brake cable and
have the beast up on ramps,  you can angle the end at the back
down and toward the center of the car and VOILA, in/out easy.
You must remove that brake cable or you will curse for hours.

6. Remove the PS tubes, this is common sense, watch how they
fold over each other in the front.  Now install the new ones, the
trick here if you got a used set is to make them match the ones
you take off in bends exactly.  When the guy ripped mine from
the parts Vanagon pell mell they got a little unbent, a small
change in a bend here or there really affects the fit up on the
front pipes of how they hit the rack, go over the front suspension
and thru the frame to where they join, particualrly how well they
sit along the frame away from the gas tank.

7.  Replace coolant tubes the same angle you removed them side
by side something over the frame where they slide through to
keep them from scratching.

8.  Hook up all the tubes, replace fuel tank, good time to look it
over likely rusted on the ole top, do something now.  Start her up
fill coolant and PS, bleed coolant.

I'd imagine this is a good solid 2+ day job, all day in perfect
weather doing it the first time.  It took me 4 weekends of crappy
weather while doing the exhaust as well, which was admittedly
a major curse.

However everything now back together leak free, Prestone Long
Life enhanced, and even finally got the beast inspected.  All in
all pretty good for the $1000 or so I got in it now.  I had a friend
wanting one willing to give $2500 for it but am likely going to give
it to dad, he has finally admitted the need to sell the er Caravan
with 160k+ on it and really loves being in a Vanagon again size
wise, shame the 1.9 is such a dog compared to our ole '86.

I've left a lot out, anybody contemplating this with particular
question email me and ask.  BTW nice rust free steel tubes
are still out there in junkyards, inside and out the set I got
for my $100 looks brand new.  The guy has one more set in
fact if anyone is interested, shipping likely a bit weird though.
