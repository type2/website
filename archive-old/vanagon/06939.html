&gt;I'm sure that this is what has been done to this VW.  It is actually the
&gt;trip odometer that is (proximally, at least) getting stuck - it gets stuck
&gt;on 9/10 readings.  Do you think we can fix this if the little white gear
&gt;has been broken this way?  Or should we resign ourselves to getting a new
&gt;(or used/salvaged) odometer?  We have lots of super glue - what breaks?

yup. that sounds like it. it might be possible to fix ... at least worth
a try, or maybe a used one from the junkyard (and try to fix it first!).
but i can tell you: a new one from vw will be expensive. see if you can
find that United Speedometer or United Instruments in the l.a. yellow pages.

i had to replace a speedo head in my 80 bus (cause nothing i did would calm
down the needle ... it just bounced around all over the place) ... so they
did it under warranty. and i decided i would hook up a drill to the thing
and run it back up to the 'correct' mileage for the car. oh sure! then i
figured out how long it was going to take to go 15,000 miles at 70mph, even
at 70 mph!!! :)  &lt;for those of you mathematically or calculatorly deprived,
it's over a week of solid running ... i didn't think my little sears drill
would hold up!&gt;
