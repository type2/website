&gt; As a Syncro owner, I must agree. Anytime I tell someone that I own 
&gt; a 4x4 camper capable of sleeping 4 adults that gets 20 mpg on the 
&gt; highway (with the ac running!!), they are usually pretty shocked.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, saw a maroon Syncro (non-Westy) the other day (86-87) that 
&gt; had big stickers running down the sides and across the front &amp; 
&gt; back that said 4x4 in this sort of high-tech looking font. Has 
&gt; anyone seen anything like this, or was it a home job?

My '91 Syncro Westy came with a &quot;4WD&quot; sticker in a sort of high-tech 
looking font just below the side mirrors.  I think VW was trying (very 
little) to differentiate model years with decals in the later model 
years.  :-)
