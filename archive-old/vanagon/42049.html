Subject: FI worries-followup

thanks to all who replied about weirdness in my FI system.
I got conflicting reports about when the fuel pump should turn on.
Half of you said it turns on when in the accessory position, the other
half said when in the start position.  I'm not too worried about that.

The other area of concern was in the decel valve and fuel pressure regulator.
You all said the vacuum hose between them should be connected(mine wasn't).
So, I connected it.  With it connected, I have TONS more power.
I'm going to keep an eye on it though, because when I take m yfoot off the
gas , i'm used to the engine decellerating.  At the moment, it won't
decel til I apply the brake pedal.

thanks everyone,
