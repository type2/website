&gt; &gt;I have found that an external cooler won't help overheating, just delay
&gt; &gt;reaching overheated, by virtue of there being more oil to heat.
&gt; &gt;I have also found that an oilcooler on a new strong well running engine is a
&gt; &gt;waist, takes motor longer to warm up, leaks. hoses in the way.
&gt; &gt;Most of the stuff in the mags are there because they sell, they don't give a
&gt; &gt;ship about your engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't agree more.  I especially like what the author of the &quot;high 
&gt; performance&quot; section of Muirs book says on the subject.  He says something 
&gt; like: &quot; build it right the first time, and you will not have to cover up 
&gt; your mistakes with coolers and .....&quot;.      

Well that all sounds good, but how come my engine overheats all the time?
I rebuilt it with all new parts, took my time, put in a Melling oil pump,
and it will overheat if I go up a steep grade, or just try to maintain 65
on a long strech of highway in warm weather.  I don't know what else to do,
except assume that the engine cooling system was &quot;underengineered&quot;.  Also,
my camper is several hundred pounds heavier (and 24&quot; taller) than those VW
engineers designed the motor to handle.  For now, I have to keep a close
watch on the pressure and temp and back off when it starts to run hot, but
I am determined to put in an external cooler eventually in hopes of solving
the problem.  I hear there's a puke-eggnog parts van up in the Bay area
somewhere, anyone know where to find it?  =)
