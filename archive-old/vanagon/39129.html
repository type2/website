'Sorry to get off the subject here (again), but, to answer your question,
yes the smaller 26&quot; wheel allows for quicker acceleration in a sprint,
primarily due to its smaller size and less rotational weight.
This is negated, however, if you're coming down to a pack sprint and
you have no lead out, AND find that you're in the gutter w/ nowhere to
go...   ;-)

Seriously though, a smaller diameter tire coupled w/ a lighter (alloy) wheel
should allow a bus to accelerate a bit quicker, but the speedo reading will
be a little bit off.
