&gt;   I need a cheep source for VW oil and air filters, The dealer here wants
&gt;$10 for the oil filters and $20 bucks for each fan belt. Does anyone have
&gt;a favorite mail order company that sells the original parts. It seem like
&gt;the price here is marked up, or is this the going price?

i get all my vw stuff from these guys:

Jim Ellis VW                 vw parts, ask for Joe Baisle or Marvis
Atlanta, GA
(800) 653-5547

last time i got v-belts (for my 88), they cost $14.56, 16.32, and
13.20 (i have three). that was 05/21/93.

last time i got oil filters (i order 10 at a time), they cost $7.48 each.
Ellis ships COD via UPS and i don't have to pay tax (8 percent local).
but then the shipping is usually $4 or $5, so it helps to order several
things (which is why i don't order 1 or 2 oil filters). that was in
04/08/93.

the air filters are ridiculous. it was $16.00 each. :(

also check around with your local auto parts places and see if they
will order Mann filters for you (air and oil) ... these are the same
as the vw filters (they are supposedly one of the suppliers to vw).
back with my 80 bus, i used them, and had no problems ... the filters
are identical to the vw.

why did i stop using them? cause for the 88 bus, the Mann stuff is
not but about a dollar cheaper than the vw ... and the local guy has
to order and it takes longer. so i just use vw from atlanta. if vw
keeps going up (they used to be $5.60 for oil filters), i may go back
to Mann and the local guy.

for fan belts, as long as you can get the length and cross-section
shape right, you shouldn't have any trouble. but i don't know any
american manufacturers of belts to recommend.

hope it helps.
