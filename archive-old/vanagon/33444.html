&gt;
&gt;&gt;I wouldn't dare post another timing question if I wasn't convinced that
&gt;&gt;I've tried about everything. Obviously not *everything,* but at least
&gt;&gt;everything practical for my budget.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My problem: the dreaded flat spot...but it's bad enough to interfere with
&gt;&gt;my driving. I do have the 009/34PICT3 combination and I'm on the lookout
&gt;&gt;for the proper vacuum advance carb. In the meantime, PLEASE, please, help
&gt;&gt;me if you can. I'm getting worn out by this problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I did close off the hole in the lower plate in the carb (I think the
&gt;&gt;lower one is the &quot;throttle plate?&quot;). This seemed to help with idle, but
&gt;&gt;also may have exacerbated the flat spot??? I'm unsure...it's all blurring
&gt;&gt;together.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My basic approach to date goes something like this:
&gt;&gt;1. Find TDC on #1. Verify rotor position.
&gt;&gt;2. Check dwell and set timing on 009 to 28 ATDC _at_ 3500 RPM
&gt;&gt;3. Adjust idle per Bentley. I corked off the vacuum line to the brake
&gt;&gt;booster to assure no vacuum leak problems. I make sure the engine's nice
&gt;&gt;and toasty.
&gt;&gt;4. Check timing again and adjust as necessary.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;With this procedure, the flat spot is noticeable. I can fiddle around with
&gt;&gt;carb adjustment and lessen the flat spot, but I haven't even come close to
&gt;&gt;getting it to go away. The only time I didn't have &quot;flat spot&quot; problems
&gt;&gt;was with the carb adjusted to the point where the exhaust was smokey and
&gt;&gt;then I was probably getting 5 miles/gal and the bus wouldn't idle at a
&gt;&gt;stop sign...obviously not good. I thought I had the problem solved the
&gt;&gt;other day after blocking that hole in the lower throttle plate, but I
&gt;&gt;really only solved my poor idle problems. Once the bus warmed up, the flat
&gt;&gt;spot was worse than ever.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm now contemplating taking the bus into a local shop and paying big
&gt;&gt;bucks to have them do the adjustment. I really don't want to do this, but
&gt;&gt;I'm feeling a little defeated by this problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks! Joe

If the '71 is a single carb then I might have a possible answer to the flat
spot problem.  The heat riser tubes that channel heat from the exhaust up
along the intake manifold (to preheat the gas/o2 mix) may be plugged up.
They can get filled with carbon from the exhaust and once that happens you
will get that awful, annoying flat spot.  You can try to unplug it but
you'll probably have to replace the whole manifold.  And...by the way...
this can happen over night, without warning.  You can test it by removing
the manifold and blowing into it. If air dosen't flow freely, it's plugged.

Another possibilty is the way you're trying to time the engine.  Try timing
it statically via Lord John Muir's book.

Good Luck,
James
