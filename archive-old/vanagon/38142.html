&gt;Hello Everyone,
&gt;	I am going to replace the torn boots on my rack and pinion
&gt;steering box.  This is not power steering.  I read in Haynes that I should
&gt;grease the steering box when I replace the boots but it doesn't specify
&gt;the type of grease.  Bently doesn't mention the grease at all. What grease
&gt;have you used for this application? 

Any Litium Moly grease will do the job fine.  Make extra suer there is no
dirt or grit on the rack.  Also, while the rack is open, chesk the bushings
for any play.  If the rack itself can be moved up/down at all, it is worn out
and needs rebuilding.  This wear will cause the same tire wear effects as an
american car with a worn &quot;idler&quot; arm.
Dennis.
