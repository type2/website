Subject: Re: muffler price and oil questions??

I have been quoted $120 for a new muffler for a 82 vanagon, is this the 
going rate? Also what type of oil filters and oil should I be using. I have 
been currently running Castrol 5w 50 synthetic up here in the high 
country of colorado. I need something light weight for the cold days and 
something heavier for the occasional road trip to the flat lands. 
thanks
Jared
