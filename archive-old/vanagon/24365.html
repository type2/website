Subject: Prune Nut Loaf recipe

Personally, I think that's a bad name for what this thing is.  It's more 
like a non-animal-meat meat loaf, it does have something from the meat 
group... nuts.  I used honey crunch wheat germ because it was sold in a 
smalleer jar, so it was a little sweet.  But I think that added to it.  I 
also substituted Pecans for the Walnuts (I don't like Walnuts).
This is from the book 'The Prune Gourmet' that was given to me by various 
members of the list at the Bodega camping trip.


			Prune Nut Loaf
Ingredients:
	1/2 cup walnuts, finely ground
	1/4 cup _each_ almonds and cashews, finely ground
	3/4 cup wheat germ
	1/4 cup oat bran
	1 cup grated mild cheddar cheese
	3/4 cup prune juice
	3 eggs, well beaten
	1 large onion, finely chopped
	1 tsp thyme
	1/2 tsp _each_ marjoram and salt

Preheat Oven to 350F

Mix it all together, put in a greased 9x5 loaf pan.  Bake for 45 min., or 
until firm.
