&gt; &gt;If you see any car driving without their lights on (at night) DO NOT blink
&gt; &gt;your lights at them. Even though you might be thinking that you are doing a
&gt; &gt;good deed in desire for saftey, you are, in fact, placing yourself in danger.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself the
&gt; &gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt; &gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally left
&gt; &gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks their
&gt; &gt;lights at them intending to add to the saftey factor. The good samaritian
&gt; &gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I tend to think that I have a fairly decent &quot;sidewalk diploma&quot; in street
&gt; &gt;smarts but this was a new one on me. If I can help keep you and your family
&gt; &gt;NOS then all the better.
&gt; 
&gt; Ellis,
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to shoot you down, but this is a fairly old urban legend.  It has
&gt; the U.L. signature of playing on fairly valid fears people have (drive-by
&gt; shootings.)

Gotta ditto Ron on this.  This is at least 5 years old and is tired.
