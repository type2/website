Subject:      aligning distributor

Hmm. When you don't do this stuff for a few years, it gets away
from you.


As part of an attempted tune-up on my '78 Bus, I removed the
distributor to have a look-see.  (Subpoint:  need to replace
bushings:  where get?)


On reinstalling, forgot to seat it properly.  Isn't the contact
on the rotor supposed to line up with the notch on the edge of
the distributor housing, when you're around top-dead center?
Mine is now 180 degrees off.


Am I confused on the theory here?  If not, how do I get the
distributor properly realigned?

Thanks,

RM
