Subject: spark plugs

I checked the FAQ's and other related info on the gopher and could not
come up with a corresponding number to the plugs that I just installed.
They are Bosch Super W7CC (no 0 241 235  574). The FAQ does not list a
W7CC for air cooled Vanagons but does list a W6CC for them and a W7CC0
for water cooled. Since I asked for a cooler plug I'm wondering if the
guy sold me the wrong kind. They look identical to the previously
installed NGK B5E S. Anybody know of the Bosch W7CC plugs and wether a
cooler plug helps?  Thanks in advance  -- DC
