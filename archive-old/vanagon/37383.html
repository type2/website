Subject: Gas Milage problem(?)

All, this is regarding my 79 Westy,

Last week it got relatively cold(low-mid 20's), and I noticed, along with the
usual crappy performance(carb conversion), my gas milage dropped thru the
floor.  The week before(65 deg and up) I was doing about 18mpg, normal. I
haven't checked this weeks milage, but looking at the gas gauge, it is at
1/4 tank, and I have just broken 100 miles.  Also when the temps were cold
it ran like it had a bad spark plug, but when warm it did not.  Is this normal
or would I be correct in thinking that one or more spark plugs did not survive
the cold snap? Or maybe time for new dist. cap, and rotor?  Wires, plugs,points
were replace before Thanksgiving trip to Disney(for those who remember), don't
know when the dist cap and rotor were last replaced.
Although it was warmer there was a large improvement in performance, but not
to the standards of 2 weeks ago and before.

Waiting with breath baited,

David
