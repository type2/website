Good.

&gt; Besides the fact that it runs slow it seems to run and idle fine.  It even
&gt; starts right up and gives off no unusual noises.  

You'd be suprised how good an engine can sound when running on two
cylinders.  Until you try to drive it.

&gt; 													I am prepared to buy new
&gt; piston rings and cylinders if needed but my question has to do with cracking
&gt; the crank case to do &quot;rod&quot; work.  How do I know if this is needed (there are
&gt; no unusual noises).  Where do you recommend buying the replacement parts I
&gt; would need for my 77 fuel injected california westy 2 liter? 

Depends on where you are.  Check the VW magazines.  I don't think it
matters too much where you buy the parts, as long as you get decent
quality.  German (usually Mahle I think) is purported to be best, and
Cofap (Brazil) seems to be okay too, from my experience thus far.  I put
NPR pistons and liners in my 1800 and they seem to be lasting fine also.

&gt; Is it possible to tell from the info I gave you what kind of rebuild it
&gt; needs (pistons, rings, cylinders, valve work).  It has about 107K miles on it.

Not really.  With that many miles, your bearings might be getting a
little loose, depending on how the engine was maintained, but if you
don't hear any knocking noises, I wouldn't get into the bottom end of
the motor.  It is pretty strong.  If your oil pressure is adequate, I
say leave the bottom end alone and fix the heads, which are most likely
the source of your loss of compression.
