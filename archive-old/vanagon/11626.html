&gt; I just checked around for prices of drums and shoes. This is what I got:
&gt; 
&gt;     VW dealer:       drum : $178.95 each
&gt;                      shoes: $77.25 set
&gt; 
&gt;     FLAPS:           drum : $75 each (Brazilan)
&gt;                             $84 each (German)
&gt;                      shoes: $18.00 set
&gt; 
&gt; Can't resist the off brand prices. But I doubt that the shoes are any good.
&gt; Any suggestions?

I've seen some awfully good looking drums in the junkyard that could be
had for a few bucks and turned, if not used outright.  Have you considered
getting used instead of spending over $150 for new ones?
