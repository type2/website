Subject: My 'new' engine &amp; camper stuff.


	I just hit 2000 miles on my rebuild.  I am very happy that It's
used perhaps a quart or so of oil, and hasnt blown up.
	Sometimes when I am driving under a load, it will sorta miss or
buck.  Is this a problem with the coil perhaps??? Its did it before I 
rebuilt the engine, and its very sporadic.  I don't think its the fuel infection
system....

	I still haven't been able to break 17 mpg.  I only get good mileage when
I drive about 70 mph.  Perhaps I should have had the valves done??

	And my starter died.  Its in the electrical shop, and I can tell this is
going to be real money(tm).

	
	On to the interesting stuff.
	I have a camper interior and a gas heater from an '82 Vanagon
that I think I may need to get rid of, mostly cause I need cash.  

	The heater is very clean, and not rusted at all other than surface rust.
I don't have any of the ducting or blower motors, etc for it.  I could
make someone a very wonderful deal on this.

	The interior includes the water tank, closet, folddown bed, and the
cool little sink, stove, fridge combo.  Again, this is pretty mint, with some
minor contact paper delamination.  I also have most of the wiring, and the
propane tank for the stove/fridge.

	My willingness to sell is directly poportional to the amount of
money it shall bring....

	Have a happy VW summer....

Matt
