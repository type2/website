Subject: '66 bus engine, procress report



Hi all,

The continuing saga of my work building an engine for &quot;Red&quot;, my 1966
standard microbus.  When I left it I was disassembling the long-block
of the junk-yard engine I bought.

Yesterday we had a nice big afternoon monsoon storm in Tucson, lotsa
lightning and rain.  Cooled the place down quite nicely, a good time to
head out to the shed and work on the engine when I got home from work.

There were still a few parts to be cleaned, rocker covers, etc. so I
finished that job first.  Then I cleaned out my solvent tank (big blue
plastic tub with thick black sludge at the bottom) and started
back to work on the long block.

I pulled off the second head (the first one was good) and found the
beginnings of a crack between the valves on the #3 cylinder.  The crack
goes about 1/4 of the way across.  Now I have 4 used cylinder heads,
2 off the original bus engine and 2 off this bug engine I'm taking
apart.  Two have visible cracks, one looks good, and one has a broken
cooling fin.  I don't suppose the broken cooling fin is really much
to worry about but I may buy new heads anyway, I'll have to do the
cost comparison.  When I had the heads from my '72 type IV engine
&quot;reconditioned&quot; (new guides, new exhaust valves, fly-cut, glass bead
blasted, etc.) it cost me $250, more than the price of 2 brand new
type I heads.  I'll ask my machinist how much to recondition these
two heads, it might be more cost effective to just buy new ones
(about $80-$90 each complete).  Any recommendations about where to
get good (stock) heads?

I pulled the jugs and pistons and threw them in the scrap heap along
with the push-rod tubes.  Yep, each piston said 85.47 on top, this is/was
a 1600cc engine.

Next I found out how this engine got to the junk-yard.  Two of the
connecting rod big-end bearings had &quot;spun&quot; and then disintegrated.
One of them was really munched, looks like it ran that way for a while,
wore down the metal under where bearing should have been.  This
connecting rod had about 1/16 inch of play up-and-down.  I imagine
that engine was a bit noisy before the end.  Another thing I noticed
was that one of the bearings on the big end of one of the other not-spun
rods was loose in the rod-end.  Amazingly, it looks like the bearings
in there were the wrong size.  No wonder the engine ate the bearings!

Got the rods out, more for the scrap heap.  Spent some time taking
head studs out of the case.  There are case-savers installed in this case
and I was surprised how tight the studs were.  I had thought they would
just unscrew by hand but no, I had to use a wrench on the bottom nut
of a two nut stack most of the way out.  Pain in the butt.

With all this apart the crankshaft/flywheel combo spins nicely in the
case, feels quite good.  Fortunately, it looks like the main bearings
haven't spun or anything nasty.  Next I have to undo the gland-nut
so, next, I'll tell you how it goes making an &quot;Anti-torque tool&quot; and buying
or borrowing a 3/4&quot; drive breaker-bar with 36mm socket.

To be continued...
