Subject: Spark Plugs-EV

Hello Folks,

Bout' that time to change the plugs in my EV for the first time,  pulled them
out to find &quot;CHAMPION&quot; VW\Audi plugs in Van!  They were double prong
(electrode) type.  Searched local and some mail order and cannot find these
plugs, so I installed a set of Bosch Platimums,  the old van doesn't seem to
run the same.  Anybody have any clues as to where I might find Champion
VW\Audi Dual prong (electrode) plugs that were originally in my van??

Thanks for your Help,

Scott Martel
