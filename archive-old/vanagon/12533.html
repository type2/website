Subject: re: 914/6 motor


&gt;
&gt;I know that they came in both 4 and 6 cylinder variants.  Does anybody know if 
&gt;the 914 6 cylinder was that same as the 911 6 cylinder engine?

The 914/6 had a variation of the '72 911T 2.4L engine--without
MFI, I belive.  If you are interested, I could look up the
specs and email you.  (I have a '72 911T.)
