&gt;Those little rubber rings on the injectors are held down by a little metal
&gt;clamp piece and screw that holds each pair of injecotrs.  It doesn't seem

&gt;sure, but I would guess that the rubber rings would be available at a
dealer.

Available aftermarket also.  Typical bosch part easily available through Beck
Arnley
