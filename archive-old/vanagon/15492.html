Thom there is a similar thread on vintage and  a couple of people there
say that MOFOCO paints their engines gold also. Our GEX (now MY bias shows
through) is not gold....it is odd though that so many engines could be in
one place all with cracked heads. Since GEX does not use new heads for
their 2.0 l that could be part of the problem...that plus the possibility
that they use valve seat inserts....DC
