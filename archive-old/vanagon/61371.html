Subject: Heat won't shut off all the way

Now that summer's finally arrived, this problem is more noticeable.  Even with
the heater contols all the way on cool (blue), warm/hot air comes in.  Is this
relatively easy to fix?  Will I need to do major dissassembly of the heater
unit?  Again, any tips or hints are wlecome.  Thanks.
