&gt; Small on Safety I think), and it told of how in rear-end collisions,
&gt; seats would snap backwards, and passengers could fly out the back
&gt; window. This was documented for Beetles. Of course, the short chapter on
&gt; buses said almost exactly &quot;Get 'em off the road - they're totally
&gt; unsafe&quot;

This was Ralph Nader.  My favorite statistic in the bus chapter
is how buses had a very high percentage of single-vehicle accidents,
implying (to Ralph) they get blown off the road.  Since those
statistics were from 1971 (or so) I have also wondered whether
some of those people driving VW vans in 1971 just might
have been STONED OUT OF THEIR MINDS.  Nah . . . .
