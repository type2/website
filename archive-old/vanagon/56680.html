Vanagon siting:

On &quot;The Scariest Police Car Chases&quot; on NBC, I think, last Tuesday.  In =
the story about the stolen tank about half way through, they show the =
tank driving down the street and over a silver Vanagon! (I own a silver =
Vanagon)  Unfortunately the Vanagon did lose to the 50,000 ton tank, but =
so did the motor home that the Vanagon was pushed through.  If anyone =
cares, the guy driving the tank was shot and killed by a cop when he =
tried to cross a median on the highway.
