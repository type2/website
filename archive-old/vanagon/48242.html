&lt;&lt;I replaced the Contis with the MXVs on my 93 last year...WHAT A 
DIFFERENCE...
the Contis were noisy, wore like crap and sucked in the wet and the snow. 
The MXVs were exactly the opposite! They are 1000% better than the Contis&gt;&gt;

I also prefer Michelin above most other brands (except for off roading) but didya
know that Continental is owned by Volkswagen AG...?
