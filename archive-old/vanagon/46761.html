&gt; mph. However, with sustained climbing in a lower gear, especially 2nd, temp

Interesting.. I guess the aircooled case of the w/b contributes 
to faster oil cooling than the inline4. One thing I've often 
wondered: what is the preffered method of 'pulling over' to cool down 
when temps are high? I don't imagine stopping the engine is best, but 
should one let it idle, or keep the revs at 2000-3000 rpm to cool 
things off quicker?
