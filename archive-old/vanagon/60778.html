Subject: Oil on the Rear Window, Drive Way, Parking Space at Work, etc

O.K.  Here's the situation fellow Vanamaniacs and Syncronaughts.  Oil seeming
to be leaking from the right of the engine.  I say this because oil is on the
starter, air filter, and just about everything else in the area.  This is a
good sized leak, too.  I bought a case of Castrol 20W-50 on 30 April for the
oil change and had to buy another on 30 May because I ran out of that plus 2
more quarts.  This is starting to get pretty expensive not to mention messy
in the drive way.  Any ideas?  Main seal?  Push rod tubes?  Breather?
 Help!!!!!!
