&gt;Does anyone know if there is a concave (magnifying) mirror replacement for
&gt;the right side mirror on '80 Vanagons?  I'm getting really tired of looking
&gt;into that mirror and seeing only the hood ornament of the vehicle in the
&gt;other lane.  At night or in rainy weather, the mirror is nearly useless for
&gt;lane changes, and there's a humoungous blind spot.  I've tried a small
&gt;circular mirror glued onto the existing mirror, but it's too small to see
&gt;anything at a glance.

get the larger circular mirror ... i use the 2-inch size from NAPA. it has
better quality relection (?) ... that is, the image isn't nearly as much
distorted as the ones i got from k-mart. anyway, it's big enough for me
without taking up too much of the regular mirror. they have a bigger one,
but it was too big for me.  i think stuart liked the bigger ones, though.
i tried those little 1-inch things but they were really useless.

another choice would be to spend lotsa-bucks and install the electric power
mirrors from a later model bus. about $800. :)
