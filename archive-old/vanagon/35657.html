The infamous Resto from Hell has continued to live up to the reputation as
time marches on.  The paint is finally completed after 18 months and we are
planning on yanking it home this coming weekend.
Sorry Martha but I'll have to pass on this CCC outing.  We are even passing
on the exciting and picturesque Desert camping at the VFW lodge parking lot
in Tucson with the bus club. We are duly bummed about missing that one! ;)

Progress has been slowed lately while I wrestle to get the rubber order out
of the &quot;buddy&quot; that swore he could get the stuff at wholesale and have it
delivered by LAST friday at the latest.  Since last August, when we put the
order together, each inquiry to the &quot;Wholesale source&quot; has been met with a
reassuring response of &quot;Don't worry! My source can have the stuff delivered
within a week, guaranteed, NO PROBLEM!&quot;  I hadn't been pushing real hard
until about two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago I finally pressed hard and forked
over the bucks in exchange for an appropriate receipt and working agreement.
The rubber was to arrive by Friday, 2/16/96, &quot;at the latest.&quot;  The body and
paint guy was finally ready to set loose of the bus.
 A recon mission took place during the middle of last week. A friend and I
loaded all of the boxes of &quot;Stuff&quot;, the frontend, floor jacks, powdercoated
brake drums, backing plates and the tool boxes into the Vanagon Westy and
zipped (slugged?) across town to the paint shop. We soon found that we had
everything that we needed except the cliche' missing box of bolts. DOH!!!
Twirling and banging of one's head with one's own hand could not over come
the embarrassment and frustration. OK back to the house where searching
ensued and the wait for th eweekend began.  Rusty's middle name became
&quot;Wirewheel&quot; for a few days while I waited for the weekend to arrive.
Friday comes and guess what, No rubber order!
Saturday I slipped over to the brother-in-laws house where I (with
permission) stole the steering box bolts and several others from a mangled
parts donor.  The unseasonal 85 degree weather reminded me that I didn't
want to be doin' the reverse combat crawl with the black widows in June,
July or August.  I wanted to be camping with listmembers! Back to the
wirewheel for  more fun! Still No rubber order!
Arraingements were made to meet with the Bodyman from Hell on Sunday at the
across town bodyshop of great repute.  I was to install the pearly white
rebuilt steering box/column in it's place, punt the fresh suspension under
the bus and start tweeking the brake system. The placeholder front end was
dropped and the steering box was ready to go into its new home. Bolts
wouldn't lineup due to some welding slag. A quick grind with a hand file was
completed. No air or electricity was available.  At first, I thought  that
the replacement floor piece was welded into an incorrect spot. It turned out
to be OK.  Installation of the steering box didn't make sense until the
rubber grommet chingus for the steering column hole was in attendance. 
Still no rubber order!! The shift rod couldn't be installed until the new
nylon clip things arrived.  This delay prevented the install of the tranny.
Adjustment/setting of the spring plates didn't make sense until the new
donuts were slipped into place. The bus wasn't to be left with out
suspension. So the placeholder frontend was reinstalled. I quickly drove
home for a shower and command performance at Good Ol' Moms house for &quot;meet
the out of town relatives&quot; on the *Other* side of town.
Good dinner and a conversation with a young gas station attendant who owned
a rat '66 Westy on the way home made the day. It was cool to talk to someone
stoked about buses.
Sunday night I was told by the rubber order &quot;buddy&quot; that he had received a
phone message from the supplier. The order was not shipped &quot;Because they
overlooked an entire page of the order when the price was quoted. Expect the
price to increase.&quot; shipment &quot;Sometime this week, FOR, SURE!&quot; Rusty said,
Un-huh, OK, yeah right, Un-huh, groovy... &lt;Actually, I went a tad ballistic
on the guy and described my level of patience and position on the rope.&gt; 
Calls to the &quot;Western Shores Rubber Place&quot; from work were for naught due to
the supposed holiday. The Adventure Continues!...
