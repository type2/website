Subject: Rebuild or Sell??
Date: Tue, 13 Aug 1996 10:21:31 -0400 (EDT)

After a rash of mis-diagnoses I am happy to report that i have
found the problem with my 86' GL.  I should say that i am very
unhappy.  The problem seems to be the valve lifters.  The shop
that i took it to wants to do the work including putting in new
rings and putting in new head gaskets.  He wants $2000 for the
work.  
Questions
1.  What is typically done in a reuild??
2.  How much do rebuilt engines usually go for (installed)
3.  What kind of faith should i place in a 10 year old car with
a rebuilt engine?
4.  Should i try to sell it now (it is in great shape otherwise
with lots of new parts) or should i fix it and try to sell it?

Any suggestions or tales of past experience would be much
appreciated.

Seamus
