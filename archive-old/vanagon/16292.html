&gt; so. are synthetics good oils? yeah. i guess. but all my brother and the other
&gt; fellows could figure was that synthetics are very very very small-moleculed
&gt; and WILL find any and all tiny cracks and holes to leak. whereas the dino-oils
&gt; are bigger molecules (or whatever the correct term is) and kinda &quot;clog&quot; them-
&gt; selves against those tiny cracks and holes.

The seals need to absorb a little bit of oil to seal properly,
they seem to do this better with dino-oil.

&gt; 
&gt; also: i think the tendency to want to run the synthetics is mostly the desire
&gt; to go longer mileage between oil changes. i personally think this is a very
&gt; BAD idea. i've read a bunch of stuff in books and articles and had my own
&gt; oil analyzed by a chem lab several times ... and my conclusion is that you
&gt; should change the oil frequently to get out the combustion by-products that
&gt; the filter does NOT get out: stuff like acids and small metal particles and
&gt; carbon particles. the &quot;crud&quot; that is still in your oil is amazing. and the
&gt; filter only gets the big stuff.

100% good advice.
Never try to skimp your way out of having to change the oil.

&gt; 
&gt; so the idea of leaving all that in the engine for 7500 miles really bothers
&gt; me. i've gone to changing oil at 2500 miles (instead of the old 3000) and
&gt; wonder if i ought not to change it every 1500. but 2500 seems to me to be
&gt; a good compromise of money, time, and engine care.
&gt; 

I'd say 2500 is plenty good.

&gt; &gt;     2) How about fuel?  I've always fed my Golf the highest octane available,
&gt; &gt;        but I've been told that this is essentially a waste.  Opinions?
&gt; 
&gt; so far, i cannot detect any difference in mileage or performance between the
&gt; six brands and three octanes that i use. i'm still running my &quot;test&quot; to see
&gt; if there is any long term difference, but so far i can't see any. the higher
&gt; octane is less economic, in terms of miles per dollar. if anybody would like
&gt; to see my results (or the whole data file), i'll be glad to send it to you.
&gt; but right now, there isn't even 0.5 mpg difference in 86,000 miles between
&gt; the 87, 89, or 92/93 octane. nor between the amoco, bp, chevron, exxon, shell,
&gt; or unocal gasolines.

Your golf does not need anything higher than what the gas station sells
as &quot;regular&quot;
If your van is new enough to be made for unleaded, it can use reg. too.
I'm not going to comment on what to run in older busses, I don't want to 
be responsible.
