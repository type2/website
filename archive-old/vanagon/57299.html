Subject: New EV Crewcabs in the Raw

Hi All,

Being a Co-Editor of the VVWCA Newsletter has some advantages.  I got to
see some pics of the VW Hannover Plant recently of bare metal Eurovan
Crewcab going down an assembly line.  **Very** Cool!  I'll see if the
owner of the pic would okay having it scanned for someone's webpage.  Any
volunteers?  email me.  Thanks,
