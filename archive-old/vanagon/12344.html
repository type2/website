&gt;So, has anybody thought of coming up with some kind of identification

&gt;&quot;THE list&quot;?
&gt;Actually, I prefer the &quot;window&quot; stickers (with clear backing, applied
&gt;to the inside of a window) to conventional bumper stickers to avoid the
&gt;eventual erosion of the regular stickers until only some strange gummy
&gt;residue remains. I could cost out both types of stickers.
&gt;The layout might look like:

a couple of comments:
- since we have all FOUR generations represented, the image should be maybe
  generic vw bus and NOT any specific generation.
- or all four represented.
- how bout a turtle/tortoise with wheels and a camper top? :)
- phrases:
     Byte my Asphalt?         :)
     Type II for YOU?
     Internet? You Bet!
     Busses by the Byte

or some such nonsense.
