Hi folks,

I called Espar again today to check on parts availability for older heaters.
The 1-800-387-4800 number I posted directs your calls to the main
headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.  Apparently, you cannot order
parts from the headquarters directly, but only through service
representatives (located conveniently across the U.S. and Canada).  You can
get a sales and service directory sent to you by calling the 1-800 number.

I called my local rep here in Wallingford, Connecticut to inquire about a
blower motor for my BN4 heater.  He called the headquarters to check on
parts availablity.  Apparently no motors are available in the U.S./Canada,
however he is going to get back to me to see if any are available through
Eberspacher in Germany.  If it's still in a warehouse in Germany, it takes
4-8 weeks for shipping.  If anyone wants the number for a service rep in
their area, let me know and I'll post the info.

Out of curiousity I asked what bottom of the line (lowest output) new
heaters cost these days.  A diesel powered heater goes for about $1200 and a
gasoline heater $1700 (plus a $275 installation kit for a vehicle).  Both
heaters put out around 10,000 BTUs.  Those were estimates--I'll post the
exact figures when he gets back to me on the blower motor if anyone's
interested.

I believe Espar is where folks like Ark Mirvis and Joe Boerio must get the
new parts to rebuild our old heaters.  It would be nice to cut out the
middle man and get these parts direct.  

I get so excited about these things [gas heaters] (living up north and all).
I suppose firing up a gas heater for me is like the feeling some of you get
when burning magnesium or thermite or exhaust valves (for the masochists).
