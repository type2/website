Subject: 70 bus for sale

Hey all,

For the second time this year I've been off the list for a while so please 
email me directly in response to this message.

Here's the story....

My 70 bus which has given me two good years of service and has taken me all 
over the east coast has arrived at the point at which I can no longer care 
for the poor beast.  On my last trip back to DC from Ohio, somewhere near the 
PA-MD line, the transmission took a dump.  I was able to nurse the bus back 
to DC and had intentions of installing another transmission.  I located a 
transmission to use in replacement and preceded to remove the required parts 
in preparation for the replacement transmission.  I could not remove any of 
the inner CV-joint bolts on the transmission and the mechanic could not 
remove all of them without chopping them off.  ----I do not want to spend the 
cash for the mechanic to do the transmission because in addition I need to 
replace the steering gear for which I have a replacement sitting in my room 
in a box.

SO I am selling the bus to someone who is willing to take the time and has 
the inclination to do the work.  If no offers I will be parting out the bus.
I know the actions are not in line with the thought of preservation I 
originally had but hey... 

Here are the particulars..

70 bus

somewhere over 500k miles on the beast
creamy white with rust in all the usual places...
california fiberglass high-top
back brakes rebuilt last summer
front brakes are fine
halogen headlights
I'm taking the radio...it has a 10 disc cd changer connected to it
6 good tires
camping interior w/ no appliances
front door handles have locks missing
I've replaced the original generator with a 55amp alternator- nice
drivers side of the engine was rebuilt last summer
The engine runs strong
carb needs replacement but has been ok for the time I've owned it
clutch and clutch bearing replaced last spring
heat ---wa ha ha gltch
interior is fair - no one has ever complained about it
never had a problem with the starter
receipts for everything since I bought it.
passed inspection last year - haven't tried this year
parts awaiting installation - transmision and gear box

If I was in I Ohio and had plenty of space and time I would keep the bus and 
cut the bolts myself but DC just does not lend itself to such work.

If you live in the DC metro area you should not have to much trouble nursing 
it home but I would not go too far. 

Let me have your offers for the bus or for the parts.  I will ship parts if 
you are not in the DC area.

Again, please reply to me directly.

thanks

john 70 bus
