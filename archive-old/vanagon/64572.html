Subject:      Re: HEAVY  Duty Shocks

&gt; I've had KYBs on my '87 for some years with good luck. See the Bus Depot
web
&gt; page for sale prices - about $28 last I checked.


Yes, the KYB's are $26.95 each.  They are excellent shocks for the Vanagon,
I use them myself.
The rears are from their top-of-the-line Gas Adjust series, while the
fronts are their mid-end GR2 shocks (the only KYB's made for the front of a
Vanagon).

Also, I was going to post this later today, along with a few other deals I
just got, but since we're on the subject now...
I just made a deal for five pair of N.O.S. original-equipment Volkswagen
Boge front shocks, for 50% off the original WHOLESALE price.  The dealer
sells them for $130 each, and pays $80 each for them.  They will be $39.95
each.  Once the five pair that are coming are spoken for I cannot get more
at anywhere near this price.  These fit all Vanagons except Syncro.
