&gt; If I understand right, this is Joel &quot;Ice Pick&quot; Walker...  Okay, gang, time

&gt; with an Alabama accent is seen sneaking around your tires....
&gt; 

All funnin' aside, I wonder if anyone has had a properly-inflated tire
have a sidewall blowout?  I've only had one, and that's when I went 
through a _huge_ pothole at about 70 (in a Jetta).  I've had lots of tires
wear out due to bad alignments, and recently had tread separation kill off
my two rear tires, but I've never heard of anyone ever having a sidewall
blowout.

What is gained by spending $80-$100 a tire with the 6ply or load range C
rating?  I've looked at some passenger tires (aquatred, and some el cheapos)
and am wondering since they all hold 2000+ pounds each, and the vans only
weigh around 6000 loaded, what do the high-priced tires have to offer? 
Stiffer sidewalls and better handling?  Would I be (economically) better 
off buying the no-name tires on sale for $30 a pop?

My enquiring mind wants to know.
