Subject: Report on Free DC Splittie
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

I went and looked, and posted some facts and opinions to the list. The post
hasn't appeared on the web archives six hours later, and I am wondering if
it is lost in cyberspace. 
 
Sometimes things go out on the list, but are missed by the html archives.
If someone received the earlier post via list e-mail, please drop me a line
at tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com. If I hear nothing, I'll repost a summary
tomorrow.  
 
Tom F.
