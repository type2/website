Subject: Vanagon brakes and belts

Hi y'all,
I'm into brakes and belts now (you know, the bondage thing).  Actually I want to 
replace the brake pads and the belts.  I've done this many a time on other cars
(especially VW's), but is there any thing I should look out for on The Beast (a 
90 GL)?  Particularly for the belts, are there idler pulleys to take up/relieve 
the slack?  I know, I know, I should get the Bentley, but I've been lazy...

Inquisitively yours,
Joachim
