Subject: timing belt?
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 22:37:11 -0500 (CDT)

I...ah, uhm..., well, I don't know what a timing belt is. There, I said it!
The one on my wife's Accord had to be changed to prevent major trouble if
it breaks. The only engine I'm more or less familiar with is in my bus and
never did I read anything in Muir, Bentley, The List about such a device on
our beloved air-cooled ones.

So what is it and why don't we have one, too?!

Sami, with timing belt envy.
