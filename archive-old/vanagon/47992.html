&lt;raised hand&gt;

next to the aircooleds, i'd have to say my next favorite is thte diesel.

though i dont own any myself, my mom has a 80 rabbit p/u, diesel, bought 
new, and a 81 rabbit 2dr hatch, bought about 3-4 years ago. Both get 
EXCELENT gas milage...never put a drop in 'em!!:) but, they run forever 
on a tank of diesel too.  and, of course, i think my favorite feature is 
the &quot;antitailgater&quot; feature. When they get to close, you just put your 
foot on the floor. And they generally back up quite quickly.....


Black smoke works wonders..

oh, and how many of oyu out there also LIKE the smell of a diesel just 
staring up? better than coffee!!

&gt; How many other &quot;certifiable diesel nuts&quot; are there on this list ?  I'm
&gt; one myself and I'm wanting to convert my 88 Westfalia into a 1.9 TDI.
