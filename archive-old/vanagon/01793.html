Subject:      Vanagon Chokes When Feeding Gas! (film at eleven)

the 'vent tube' that i was talking about is a big thingie, about the size
of your little finger, that runs along side the big filler tube ... you
might have to feel around and see if it is behind the big tube. anyway,
all the diagrams show it running from just behind the body side metal in
the wheelwell ... down to the top front of the tank. i think it's purpose
is just to prevent this choking and back-puking of gas when filling up.

well, it's on the diagrams, anyway.

those little white plastic tanks with all the little plastic tubes that run
all over the top of the tank (according to bentley pictures) are for
expansion and tilt ... so you can fill the tank up, and it will still have
someplace to go when it gets hot, sitting in the sun. and also so it can
run off into one little tank (or the other) when you park on the side of a
hill.

i don't think the little white plastic tanks and their plumbing are gonna
do any good with the fill-up process. (but i've been wrong before! :)
