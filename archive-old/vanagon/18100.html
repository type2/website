A few of you have asked me via private e-mail for a recital report
from this past weekend.  

First of all, Ric, we really missed you!  I turned on those lites,
everyone wore tie-dye t-shirts, and I passed out all the hallucinogenic
substances I could find, but you never showed up!  :(

Bradley Prunehead managed to show in the middle of the event - at
least in time to consume vast quantities of a certain beverage which
shall remain nameless.

Bill and Jean showed up as I suggested about an hour ahead of showtime
to rehearse with my student.  In answer to at least one of the questions
I received via e-mail, yes he DID manage to hit all the falsetto notes -
flawlessly.  It was really inspirational.  Next year, I plan to recruit
Bill to sing another classic rock piece, and play acoustic bass at
the same time.  All suggestions welcome.  

The whole event was filmed by a video geek student of mine, and there's
some talk about making a webpage.  Stay tuned....  :)

Bravo Bill and thanks again! - It was a real &quot;VW-type&quot; weekend....
