&gt;I would like to be counted as someone else who suspects that
&gt;there is a racial element to the story. The description of
&gt;feeling righteous while vandalizing someone's car made me
&gt;very uncomfortable.

     Well put -  Although I suspect the narrator meant no &quot;harm&quot;...

&gt;The subtext of the story seemed to me to be one of &quot;getting
&gt;even with a black person with a bad attitude&quot;. That, to me,
&gt;is a racial issue.
