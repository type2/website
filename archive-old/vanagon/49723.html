&gt;Subject: Vanagon Fresh Air System (A survey)
&gt;
&gt;I too have to shut off my fresh air system manually, stuffing several
pounds of foam rubber down the throat of the intake behind the radiator
grill.  Here in North Georgia, I do this in the summer--it's impossible to
air condition the van without doing this--Metropolitan Atlanta is full of
hot air, ambient and otherwise.
&gt;
&gt;I have thought many times that I might remove the dash, take apart the air
plenum and see if this is &quot;fixable.&quot;  At the same time, I could either fix,
oil, clean, or replace the fresh air fan (it squeaks), and I could also find
the leads for the rear speakers, the leads for the left rear being
hopelessly lost in the quagmire of the underdash world.
&gt;
&gt;But mostly I would like to find out if it really IS possible to shut off
the air flow completely.  I've never received a satisfactory answer over
this list to this question.
&gt;
&gt;Do ALL Vanagons have this problem.  I'm taking a little survey, with the
results to be published next week.  E-mail me directly, responding to this
query.
&gt;
&gt;YES if you cannot shut off air flow
&gt;
&gt;NO if you can shut off air flow
&gt;
&gt;If the yesses, outnumber the nos, I'll assume it's not fixable and save
myself the trouble of splitting this chamber.
