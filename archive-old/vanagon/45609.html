 Has anybody ever drilled out the orifice in the burner valves of a Westy
 stove ? I've been thinking about trying to increase the output of the 2
 burners.  I firgure that I can go up 1 or 2 sizes and dramatically increase
 the usefulness of the stove. Any thoughts or suggestions are always
welcomed.

DON'T DO IT!!!

The stoves are designed for a particular heat release.  The orifice size is
set up to deliver as much gas as it takes to produce that much energy
assuming the propane regulator is delivering proper pressure.  Also, the air
registers on the burners are set up to allow the right amount of air into
the burner to burn this amount of propane completely and reasonably
efficiently.  (The burner uses the venturi effect from the expansion of the
propane thru the orifice to suck air in.)  The same is also true for other
gas appliances like refrigerator, lanterns, water heater, furnace, etc.  

If you increase the orifice size, the gas delivered goes up exponentially as
the size of the hole increases.  So a little orifice increase can get you a
lot more gas.  This results in overheating and, unless proper adjustments
are made, in incomplete combustion, i.e. carbon monoxide. In a small space
like a Westie, a little CO goes a long way toward killing you. 

If you have a need to boil a lot of water or to do something else that
requires substantial heat, buy one of those large one or two burner stoves
that will sit outside and use it.  You can get them - and the 25#  propane
bottles for them - at Sam's Club or most any other place that deals in
outdoor stuff.  If you need &quot;a bigger hammer&quot; - - - get one.  

I used to work for a natural gas utility.  I've seen the results of quite a
few cases where somebody tried to tamper with a gas appliance to get it to
do more than it was designed for.  Fires, crispy critter, CO poisoning, etc.
So PLEASE - don't do it.  Let me know if you have any questions.
