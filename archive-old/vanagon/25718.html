Subject: RE: Temperature Related Performance Problems


&gt;Your first problem may be the well known, but perhaps poorly understood
&gt;problem that many water cooled Vanagons have.  The way to know for sure is
&gt;to stop when the problem starts to occur, turn off the engine, immediately
&gt;re-start the engine and continue driving.  If the problem has cleared up,
&gt;you have the well known problem.
&gt;
&gt;I just told you what the work around is.  There is a wiring harness fix
&gt;available from VW for $200(?).  Also, other folks have found a fix by
&gt;adding a few parts to the computer or wiring harness.  Perhaps someone else 

&gt;on this list can point you to server that holds the extensive discussion on 

&gt;this subject.
&gt;
&gt;I use the work around.



Volkswagen does it... again!     :^)
