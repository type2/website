Don't worry for that, Jim, you know that all the French are very rude, don't
you? It's written in Newsweek...:&lt;)
&gt;
&gt;I'm real dissappointed in the windshield wipers in both my 87 and 88
&gt;Vanagons.  They seem to smear, or chatter or both and just do a poor job in
&gt;general. 
&gt;I've swithced wipers by replacing the assembly sometimes and replacing just
&gt;the rubber insert at other times.  I've tried Anco, Trico (sp?) and right now
&gt;I've got fancy &quot;Tripledge&quot; wipers installed that have multiple ridges on each
&gt;wiper - supposed to be made of silicon for ultimate wiping.  They're just as
&gt;bad as the rest.  They do have a lifetime replacement warranty though.  Just
&gt;send in the wiper and about $8 for S+H and they'll send you a new $10 wiper!!
&gt;Some warranty!
&gt;
I've problems with mine too, the rear don't work anymore and I don't have
any pressure from the *stuff* (I don't remember the english correct word)
that is supposed to clean the winshield. I've already checked the fuses and
they are OK. The pump might be the cause I guess, I'll check on that next
summer :&lt;), Philippe
