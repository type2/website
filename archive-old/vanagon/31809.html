Hi,

	I wanna create a new web page, with all of the resources that
would be handy for bus people, ie repro metal panels, repro safaris,
taillight lenses and the like, as well as sources for used bits as well.

	My primary focus is split window busses, as thats what I'm always
trying to find parts for.

	I'm not particulary concerned about engine parts; they seem to be 
plentiful, except perhaps parts for early 25/36hp motors.

	I'll compile all these bits of info onto a web page which I'll 
maintain with my other pages.

	Thanks, and lets get those contibutions rolling in!

Thom
