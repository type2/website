&gt;Eberspacher BN-4 Good condition all ductwork, mounting brackets and 
&gt;electrical and Gas pump etc. 275.00

Hey!!   If some fool offers me $200US or less I'll dig my BN-4 out and set
it up for a test burn.  Definately good condition. All complete, including
plastic air ducts into spare wheel carrier in back deck, bracket,
timer-switch, pump, yadayada.  Working fine when I pulled it,... 'bout 7
years ago.:) Those things used to go for nada, $25 max, that's why I still
have mine, wasn't worth selling. Any suckers? Er takers?  Tim Smith
