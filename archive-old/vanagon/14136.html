Subject: Re: 1990 Truck Dependability Survey

&gt;i saw a report about 1990 minivans, Mazda MPV and Volkswagen Vanagon tied 
&gt;for most dependable and trouble free.
&gt;
I won't argue, but right now I own two cars, my bus and a 1976 mercades benz 
300D.  Parts for the Benz are very expensive if I can even find them.  From 
what I have heard, the V-gon engine is very expensive to fix.  Same goes for 
the 72' and later busses.  Rebuilding these engines costs big bucks. like 2-3K.
I bought a 71 because the motor is cheap to fix, and parts are very easily 
found.
There is some great FAQ at lenti I think, look in joel walker's .sig for the 
address.

See Ya.
