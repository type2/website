Subject:       Chemical hand warmers

I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble but I don't think the chemical 
handwarmer/battery warmer will work..   I use them quite a bit and 
they work great when stuffed in a pocket but they have a couple 
characteristics that would make them impractical.
 1.  they are a mixture of charcoal, iron filings and salt.  
Essentially it's a thermophillic oxidation/reduction reaction.  They 
seem to need a warm intial temperature to reach &quot;critical mass&quot; for 
the ReDox rx to start.  If left in the cold (say below 0 F) and not 
scrunched up in a pocket they don't get very warm.
2.  While they can get hot, I don't think they have enough specific 
heat to significantly warm a 50 pound battery.  
3.  Re-using them doesn't seem to work.  Yeah, they get a little warm 
when you bring them out of the bag but most of the active ingrediants 
have been oxidized to the point when the chem reaction is pretty 
feeble.  

Now, they do make great handwarmers.  Put several in your emergency 
kit.  They just plain feel good to be chilled and have that warm 
location ie pocket, small of the back, etc. to chase the cold.  I've 
tried making them with the aformentioned ingredients but to no avail. 
 Someone is making a killing on a little salt, charcoal, and iron 
dust.
