I just bought my '87 Wf and there was no key, so there's no way I can fill
it.  I called Euro-american RV Products, 818.760.4214 [from Ron's vanagon
web page].  You need to call betw 9-11am PST m-f, or leave a message.  Pete,
there, told me that the keys are no longer available, but he sells a
better-than-original &quot;tank water filler assembly&quot;, part #255070810, for
$37.50.  It is supposedly easier to fill.

If anyone else has a source for the keys, I'd sure rather save the money, if
possible.

Good luck,

Gail
