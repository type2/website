Subject: Gear Oil?

	I want to change the gearbox oil in my '91 Transporter - the 
manual suggests API - GL4 SAE 80 or G50 75W90.
	Could anyone tell me how the different grades of gear oil are 
measured or what 75W90 means?
	I have tried various outlets they have 80W90 and the closest I 
can get is API-GL4 75W85. Which should I use?
