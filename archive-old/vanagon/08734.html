So wanek_at_whscdp.whs_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; Bad part - they did NOT make an effort to integrate all the stray notes and
&gt; &quot;Changes to the 19xx Edition&quot; stuff - you are still led on wild-goose
&gt; often circular references with little payoff  (maybe this is a semi-adult
&gt; version of &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;) and most of the newest changes have little to
&gt; do with Vanagons or earlier Type II's.

You have to remember that that book is for air-cooled vehicles only.  So
you won't see any reference to water-cooled versions of anything in there.
The air-cooled Vanagons are similar enough to the '79 buses that it probably
takes care of those too.  But your right about the hunting around bit.
Does anyone out there know if the Idiot Guide covers the fuel injection
system for those early air-cooled vanagons?
