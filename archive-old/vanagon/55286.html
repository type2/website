&gt;I made an appointment to take my 93 EV to the dealer next week for a
&gt;possible piston slap problem.  Symptom is the van sounds like a diesel for
&gt;about ten minutes after starting.  My questions are:

Piston slap DOES exist. You've described the symptoms perfectly. My dealer
replaced my pistons because of it. I'm not the only one. The VW regional
service rep had the same problem with his VW, or so I was told.

&gt;Can someone confirm that the head needs to be pulled to confirm or deny
&gt;that piston slap exists?  What are the other symptoms of piston slap?  Is
&gt;bad compression one of them?  What about the head and pistons indicates
&gt;that piston slap is occurring?   What is the typical compression for an EV?

Compression has nothing to do with piston slap. The heads do not need to be
pulled to confirm it exists. My dealer confirmed it with a stethoscope.

&gt;Finally the dealer told me that the 5 year/50K powertrain warranty only
&gt;applies to the original owner.  I bought mine used from a dealer so I may
&gt;have to hope that the gods look kindly upon me.  I want to have all of my
&gt;ducks lined up before I meet with the dealer.

This is bull****. I am not the original owner of my EV and my dealer (Carter
VW in Seattle) did the entire job under the powertrain warranty. The was
billed at roughly $2,000 and I paid not one red cent. Your dealer sounds
like a loser. Sadly, most VW dealers in the Seattle area are losers also. At
least Carter's (in my experience) does a good job.

Hope this helps.

&gt;Thanks in advance
