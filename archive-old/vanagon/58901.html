Subject: Removing Shelves in 90 Westy

Is this an intelligence test or what?  Cabinet behind the driver's seat.
 Shelf and lower step shelf thing are supported and held in place by peg-like
things , chewy plastic on the outside and a hard metal center -- how do you
get the pegs out -- and then get the shelves out?

Thanks for any help!!!!
