Subject:      two batteries in one for aux?



I noticed that Campers World has a battery that is two in one. Not cheap, but
its suppose to be a deep cell and a high amp battery in wone, with four
terminals. This seems like it would be ideal, esp. since the best place to
locate a batery in my 69 is the engine compartment but the left side is in
reserve for a gas heater, when I find another. So, anyone else looked into
these? A friend with a 91 westi is interested just so he won't have to give
the aux. battery compartment up as storage.

p.s., about that gas heater, I have a nice one I picke up that fits in the
middle of the bus. Ideally I would like to trade it for one for the back of my
bus, but I might sell it so I could buy one for the back. . . .
