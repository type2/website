I can't believe you want to invest anything in this bus before you
own it.

IMO if the car doesn't run, you should assume the worst and make
your offer accordingly.   You can't even do a decent compression
test because you can't warm up the car.  If it has been sitting for
a while then the entire engine compartment is in question.  Don't
waste your money to the sellers benefit.  It's better to make a
low offer and start from there or walk away from it.
