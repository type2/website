Subject: Head Gasket help?

I advised all of a coolant problem I was having (dripping anti-fireeze) which
was properly diagonsed as a leaky plastic coolant tank.

While having this replaced my mechanic advised me  that my head gaskets were
leaking slightly.  He suggests a complete repair...(.maybe $1500)!  Should I
wait untill the problem is major?  Are there any economical fixes?  I'll
probably get another quote but I'm bummed.  I've got 90,000 miles on the 87'
Vanagon Westy...

Any thoughts appreciated,

Ajax.
