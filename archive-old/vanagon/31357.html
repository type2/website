Subject: Engine-stand search, northern Utah

Howdy folks, if anyone in this part of the country could loan
(or rent!) me an engine stand while I'm reassembling my bus engine,
I'd be most grateful.  Ph # 801 487 8589

I just got my crank and engine case back from the machine shop
(more on _that_ later... grrr).
