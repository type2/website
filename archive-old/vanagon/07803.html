&gt; Does any one know the minimum

&gt; there is an argument here for not using synthetics since they absorb less

The book, &quot;How to Hotrod your Air-Cooled VW&quot; States that oil temp should
be a minimum of 180 degrees F for maximum lubrication.  Despite the title,
this book is an excellent source of general information on air-cooled
engines, and includes a very interesting history of the Beetle engine.
