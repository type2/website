There are two VERY DIFFERENT campers coming from the VW/Winnebago consortium.
Prototypes were displayed at the Chicago Auto Show this February, and
production models are now (allegedly) on sale.

The &quot;Volkswagen Eurovan Camper&quot; is sold by 'select' VW dealers.  It's a
slightly (about 15&quot;) stretched Eurovan, with a pop-top, and looks a
lot like the Vanagon Westfalia campers.  Costs about $30K.

The &quot;Winnebago Rialta&quot; is sold by 'select' Winnebago motor home dealers.
It has the cab of a Eurovan, but then has a small motor home body.  
The wheelbase has been stretched further than the Eurovan camper.
This unit has a bathroom w/shower and lots of plushness in the Winnebago
style.  Looks like a good modernizing of the Renault-based Winnebago
LeSharo mini-motorhomes.  Costs about $45K.  It has the stock Eurovan
5-cyl engine, and the Winnebago rep at the show said it would probably
come only with the automatic, so I've gotta worry A LOT about what kind
of performance this thing is going to have  (hmmm, something that a 
split could dust off in a drag race???)

Both of the prototypes were nicely finished off, and were drawing big
crowds at the show.

Here in Wisconsin, only two VW dealers made the 'select' list for peddling
Eurovan campers.  The local Winnebago dealer is not stocking Rialtas, but
a dealer in Madison, WI has started advertising them.
