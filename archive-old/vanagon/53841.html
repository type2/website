Subject: Towing a Syncro
Date: Mon, 06 Jan 97 18:26:00 CDT


Last night a friend and I went to local tavern to have a beer before last 
call.  As we left the bar I noticed a flat bed tow truck parked in front of 
my Syncro, I ran toward it telling the guys to stop (turned out I was in 
violation of a snow emergency - what an idiot I was not to remember).

They were just hooking up the van and hadn't moved it yet.  I paid the $15 
drop charge and was on my way.

The above brings up a question, What would that do to the differential, VC 
and transmission since I left it in gear?

I made sure they hadn't moved it one millimeter and told the guy (after I 
paid the drop charge)  that if he had his employer may be responsible for 
HUGE repair bill.  Would it in fact damage anything???
