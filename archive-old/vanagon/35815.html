Have you seen the &quot;Jerque du Jour&quot; Web page? It's at:

     http://www.got_dot_net/~egallant/the_road.html

Somebody on this list mentioned it months ago, when a VW bus in the left
lane was featured.

Some guy who is silly enough to live an Santa Cruz (on the CA coast) and
commute to the San Jose area (over one narrow 4-lane road that winds
thru the hills), complains endlessly about the shitty drivers he finds
there. Many of his complaints are legit-- there are as many pinheads there
as anywhere else, and he carries a digital camera with him as his buddy
drives I think. Some of his descriptions of the shots are humorous,
although at one point he says &quot;If you're being passed by a VW camper,
you're going too slow&quot;.

Actually, I feel that way myself, especially when I was driving my '71 (non-
camper). I blocked a lot of traffic in the right lane in that car in my 
time,
foot flat on the floor, going up a hill at 30mph in second. Shift into 
third,
and it wouldn't accelerate. Sound familiar? One of the reasons I got the
V6anagon...
