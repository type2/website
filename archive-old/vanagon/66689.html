&lt;&lt; I have a set of 4 audi turbo alloys w/ tires for sale
 these will fit on any vanagon, and are the multispoked style (there were a
 couple of different styles)
 come w/ elongated front lug bolts.
 $50 each. $200 for all 4.

PS, people, I'm in Allentown, Pa.
you need to think about shipping prices w/ 4 wheels and tires.
