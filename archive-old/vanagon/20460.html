Subject: Rear hatch ... inside openers?
Date: Sun, 9 Jul 1995 09:38:25 -0600 (MDT)

Hello vanagon gang,
I am in the process of removing the interior panels from my vanagon in order
to redo the wallpaper which was peeling.  Now that I have the back door hatch
completely bare, I think I should ask:  has anyone installed a device there
which makes it possible to open the rear hatch from the inside?
