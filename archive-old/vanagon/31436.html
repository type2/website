Subject: Checking up on mechanic's bleeding radiator method

As you are probably aware--I just got a new radiator in my '85 GL.  The new
radiator is stamped 3/95--kind of nice to know that someone, somewhere is
still cranking out parts for these things.  I was referring in an earlier
post as to the installer's method of bleeding the cooling system being to
stand the front of the van &quot;on it's head&quot; to actually bleed the coolant of
air from the rear.

I checked up on this--and the cooling system did indeed still have air in
it--the trouble is, I have just been out trying to bleed the system per the
instructions in Bentley, and after an hour, I'm still getting coolant with
bubbles in it.  I think I have gone through at least two quarts of coolant
and still can't get the air out!

Am I taking on air into the system this quickly?  I'd think I would be
blowing steam out the tail pipe if my head leak was that bad!

Happy Solstice (belated),
