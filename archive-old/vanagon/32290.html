&gt;&gt;Also, is a 'marine' battery the same as a 'deep-cycle' battery?
&gt;
&gt;

That depends.  There are Marine engine starting batteries and there are
marine deep cycle batteries.  There are also a number of batteries that are
sold claiming to do both.  The major difference betwee a marine starting
battery and an automotive battery is the cranking amps current rating.  The
auto battery is rated at 0 degrees F.  the marine battery is rated at 70
degrees F.
