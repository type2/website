More questions from the back porch...

I am at the point in reassembling my 1600DP where I need to attach the 
intake manifolds to the heads.  I have been told that it is a good idea 
to put some sort of sealant between the heads and the thin metal gaskets.
It appears that there was some there before, so I am inclined to believe 
this nugget 'o wisdom.
What type of sealant can handle the temperatures?  I, in my ignorance, 
would assume it gets pretty hot right there.   Once again, thanks!
