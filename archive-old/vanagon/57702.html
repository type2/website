Subject: Re: won't start

I also have a &quot;won't start after running hot for hours&quot; problem.
The temporary fix is to whump the starter solenoid with a tap or two
from a hammer and screwdriver.

The cause is not enough voltage reaching the starter solenoid terminal.
Or the solenoid itself needing cleaned and lubed (NOT an easy chore)

Many thanks,
