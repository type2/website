Subject: RE: Anyone used PartsPlace Inc?

        Jonathan:
        
        4 orders, 3 were correct, 1 was for the wrong model Beetle 
        (needed a gasket for a Super Beetle, not the standard.)  One 
        phone call and 3 days later I had the correct part.  All of my 
        orders involved a 72 Super Beetle.
        
        Based on those experiences, and their prices, I am a satisified 
        customer.
        
        Skip Correll
