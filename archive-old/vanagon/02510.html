Subject: missing grill blockoffs

Jerry Huff wanted clarification as to whether the blockoffs behind the air-
cooled Vanagon grill increase or decrease fresh air flow in the van.  The
presence of the blockoffs increases fresh air flow, apparently by increasing
the air pressure in front of the only remaining opening, which is the duct
into the fresh air system.  So if yours are missing, you want to replace them,
except if it is a cold winter, in which case you want to cover the fresh air
duct with black duct tape cause the seal around the fresh air on-off door isn't
worth a damn.

I tried to get my new blockoffs (which are cardboard sprayed with undercoat) to
stay on longer by wiring an x behind each with wire from peg to peg.

Jerry: ask again if I'm still not clear.
B.
