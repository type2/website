&gt; &gt;Marvel Mystery Oil - It's a mystery why anyone buys it, the oil
&gt; &gt;which does everything, but nothing very well, and no one really
&gt; &gt;knows what's supposed to do, or what it was invented for, besides
&gt; &gt;our grandparents, who use it for lubing hte sewing machine...
&gt; &gt;IMHO...
&gt; 
&gt; Salade Marvellieux
&gt; 
&gt; Twenty scallions, sauteed
&gt; Finest romaine, a peck
&gt; Vin Beaujolais, one quart
&gt; Vinegar au fines herbes
&gt; Marvel Mystery Oil
&gt; 
&gt; Toss together all ingredients except the Beaujolais.  Drink the
&gt; Beaujolais right down as if it were Thunderbird and spread the
&gt; salad over any holes that have rusted through the bottom of your VW,
&gt; where it will harden into a nice, servicable floor.
&gt; 
Seriously now, we should explore the benefits of MMOil if there are
any...
Actually, about the above mentioned usage of MMOil, USED engine oil,
preferably diesel, works mush better at coating potential rust areas.
Used diesel oil just won't go away...I don't know why.


Whatever lights your candle...
