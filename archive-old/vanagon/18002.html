Subject:       Re: two-bulb rear taillights on splitties?

&gt; I was just wondering what year(s) VW put the two-bulb taillights in 
&gt; splitties. The only ones I've ever seen have ben one-bulb (`59-66, mostly.)
&gt; and was wondering if they did this for the `67's or something.

Good question.  After talking to a local VW guru around here, he said 
that there were only single-bulb taillights.  I still question this 
though, because of the euro yellow/red lenses.  It would be odd to 
have the dual color lens with a one-bulb reflector.

Anyone?
