&gt; What do you call a lawyer with an IQ of 40? Your Honor.
&gt; Why don't lawyers lie on the beach? Cats would bury them.
&gt; Why don't sharks attack lawyers? Professional courtesy.
&gt; Why experiment on animals with so many lawyers out there?
&gt; And the Devil said to God, But where will *you* find a lawyer?

Politically Correct Stuff:  (True Story!)

Went to a funeral Friday, and as we're caravanning to the grave site,
I remark &quot;This must be the Jewish section.&quot;  Since the area was kinda
plain looking, my sister and her hubby IMMEDIATELY railed into me for 
being an anti-semite, to which I replied &quot;So, then how do you explain 
that huge stone Star of David and the Hebrew inscriptions?&quot;  Boy, talk 
about a coupla red faces!
