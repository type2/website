Subject: Columbus Day Mid-Atlantic Camp-out?

Anyone interested in having an east coast event over the Columbus Day?  I
am anxious to try out my soon-to-be-functional '76 Westy and the Columbus
Day weekend looks like a good time (and far enough off for me to get the
bus up and running :-)

As a preliminary proposal, I would suggest a reprise of the Elizabeth
Furnace location, with a caravan on Skyline drive.  OTOH, though I loved
the site, I am new to Westy-dom and camping, so if you have a different
favorite site, by all means propose it.  I would prefer to stay in the
VA/MD/WV/southern PA/northern NC area, though.

BTW, anyone replying from vanagon, please cc me as I am only on the Type2
list.
