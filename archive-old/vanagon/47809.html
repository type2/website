&gt;GEX's replacing

Oh jeez, I can't believe I'm speaking up in defense of GEX, but I couldn't
let this one go.

So first, we all start yelling about how GEX had better kiss Dave C's hiney
because there are hundreds watching, and now we knock them because they
do??
Looks like a no-win situation for them.  Come on, give them a little credit
for doing the right thing, even if for the wrong reason.

&gt;Honestly Larry,
&gt;would you have? If they only make the occasional mistake and acknowledge it
&gt;when they do,

They just DID acknowledge it.

&gt;the &quot;Information Age&quot; will not be a threat to their business,
&gt;rather, it will be an asset.  However, I've found that with GEX, mistakes
&gt;seem to be the norm.  Of the three GEX engines I've installed here is the
&gt;score:

I see why you're upset with them, I am too, but why did you buy three
engines from them?  I'm hoping you didn't, and acquired them by other
means.  I personally had one bad experience with them and I wouldn't give
them my business again if they gave me a 100% money back refund tomorrow on
the heads I bought from them.  Why go back when there are more reputable
establishments out there?  I don't think mistakes are the norm, more like
plain shoddy workmanship and lack of attention to detail.  I wouldn't trust
their heads to my lawnmower much less my bus!
