Subject: Splash Pans for a '56



Hello Transporteers:

The rainy season is almost upon us here in the Bay Area.  I will begin
shake down runs of my '56 panel van soon.  The front floor boards are 
currently vented to the open road (via missing rubber around the pedals
and brake fluid cannister).  Hence I need a set of splash pans to cover
the under-side of the front end.  I use the term &quot;splash pans&quot; as I know
it.  This was the veracular used on me so realize it could be misleading.
I, the neophyte, understand that the &quot;splash pan&quot; is a broad somewhat
dished piece of metal that bolts up the the underside of the front-end
area to guard against splashes from the front wheels.

More information about the splash pan phenomena is needed and welcome.
Thanks in advance
