Subject:      German Listees -- HELP!

Sorry for off-topic, but I'm desperate!

I have a 27 page document in Word95 format (can change easily if need
be).  I need a hard-copy delivered in Kronberg, Germany ASAP (no later
than first thing Friday morning).  21 pages plain text, 6 pages color
screen shots (very little color actually, took maybe 15 minutes to print
all 27 pages out on my Hewlett Packard 550C -- will settle for black &amp;
white print outs -- I'm desperate!)

If any of you live there and could print it &amp; deliver it (or have it
delivered), I'd pay well!  Couriers in the states want over $400US
(won't pay THAT much!).  Just as good would be any commercial outfit
over there that would do it for me.  With the graphics, it's close to 4
megs, but could be trimmed to around 2 megs fairly easily.  I can upload
it to a website for easy downloading, or attach it to an email,
whichever was preferred.

Again, sorry to bother everyone else, Thanks!
