It helps if you refer exactly to what you are commenting on.       

what guy?

and I'm sick of hearing bad talk about Earl and Eric,   if you buy a  cheap
bus mail order w/o asking detailed questions &amp; getting pictures you can't
expect a dreamboat.   I'd seen that bus (Grendel) around before Bob got it,
 and thought it was a beater hippy bus,  but it had been driven from Colorado
last summer.    Why shouldn't E think someone could put a motor in and drive
it?
