Add another to the list. I just had a '70 Westy Campmobile Yardbus 
delivered. I got it from a guy who was headed for Colorado and his 
Mom said the Lawn Ornament had to go.
 Don't know if it's a resto or parts doner yet, but its 
fairly straight. I'll decide when I drop the motor and get a close 
look underneath.
