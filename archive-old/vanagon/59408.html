Subject: 80 westy parts for sale
Date: Mon, 5 May 1997 21:51:45 -0500

Well, I picked up the 80 camper tonight, and there is just too much wiring
to do to make it worth fixing.  It is scruffy, with a bunch of little dents
and rust, so I've decided to part it out.  The car is complete, except for
the burned up stuff.  The PO bought some of the FI parts to repair as well.
 So far, almost everything's for sale on this car.  Mail with requests, and
I'll get back to you as soon as possible. 

Thanks
