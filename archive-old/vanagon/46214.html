&gt;A while back, Jim Davis neatly pointed out about changing trans fluid 
&gt;in automatics:
&gt;  &quot;I did this a while back and it's just as you describe.  I did replaced 
&gt;the screen also.  My ATF had not been changed in a long while and I 
&gt;wanted to change as much of it as possible.  Since a significant amount 
&gt;of ATF remains in the trans during this procedure, I elected to change 
&gt;much of the ATF before the procedure.  What I did was use a plastic lube 
&gt;oil pump and snaked plastic tubing down the dipstick tube and pump out 1 
&gt;quart.  Then add 1 quart.  We'd drive it for another week or three and 
&gt;replace another quart.  I think I replaced about 6 quarts this way.  I 
&gt;recall calculating that I was able to replace about 95% of the old ATF 
&gt;after the screen &amp; gasket change with new ATF.  If I recall correctly, a 
&gt;typical change only replaces about 60% of the ATF.&quot;
&gt;  Just going through old mail from a recent week's break and I nominate 
&gt;this as a candidate for everyone's &quot;Best of Vanagon&quot; folder as a keeper. 
&gt; Excellent thinking.
