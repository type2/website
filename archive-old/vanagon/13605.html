Subject: Lowering your mileage (Was: Bus front air-dam ideas?)

On Sat,18 Mar 95 20:34:45 CST Mark Sabourin said:

&gt; &gt; Has anyone put an air-dam on their Bus? I'm taking a long trip this
&gt; &gt;summer and I'm trying to lower my gas mileage. There must be some type
&gt; &gt;of car with an air-dam that would bolt to the front bumper... Any 
&gt; suggestions?
 
Thom Fitzpatrick replies:

&gt; Wanna lower your gas mileage?  Load the bus up with cement!
 
I think I see the root of the problem here.  In Canada, mileage is measured in 
litres per 100 kilometers (volume/distance) whereas in the US, mileage is 
measured in miles per gallon (distance/volume).  In the interest of 
international detente, I thought I should clear up the fact that lowering your 
mileage is not as bizarre as it might sound if you live north of the border.

Other mileage lowering tips (I can't resist):

1) disconnect your odometer.
2) parachute (popped top will do in a pinch)
3) ...?
