Subject: RE:Driver's Side Barndoor


Joe Fournier say's he's spotted a van with a Barndoor on the driver's side
and asks how rare it is...


First off &quot;barndoor&quot; is a specialized term which refers to pre-56(?)
Type2s which had a large engine lid cover which essentially was about
double the size of the later engine lids. In that engine compartment
was the spare tire as well as the fuel tank.

As to the doors on the driver's side...what you saw were the &quot;cargo
doors&quot; which all early Typ2 vans had (both passenger and cargo versions..
with the exception of a handful of 66 &amp; 67 vans which had sliding doors
by special order). Chances are what you did see was a double-door
delivery van which had the cargo doors on BOTH sides of the van. Those
are rare...and were available from VW by special order.

If it did have only one set of cargo doors on the driver's side, either
it was a RHD van (RHD vans had the cargo doors on the left side of
the van) or in fact LHD van. If it was LHD, then it is probably as
rare as the double-door vans...this too was only available by special
order.
