Subject: Silicon Sealant for engine tin ?

     

     g'day everyone -
     
     I procured a replacement engine for my tired 82 westie and am slowy 
     removing and cleaning parts from my old engine.  There seems to have 
     been some sealant which looks alot like RTV around some of the places 
     where the tin meets the engine towards the back where the fan and oil 
     filler pipe is.
     
     What's the purpose and does anyone know what I should use there on the 
     new engine ?
     
     Thanks much
     
     john clark
