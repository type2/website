Subject: Re: factory syncro shock absorbers

This should clarify it for you Jim: 

SHOCKS HOLD THE WEIGHT: In the case of the Vanagon Syncro, the front shocks
actually carry the weight of the vehicle. You can see that this is true by
considering that the front springs sit on a flange welded half way up the
front shocks. The weight of the vehicle sits on the springs--the springs sit
on the shock, the shock sits on the lower control arm. 

SPRINGS DON't RAISE 16&quot; VAN. The front springs for the 16&quot; version of
vanagon and for the 14&quot; version of Vanagon are the sam part number.
Therefore, the only way the factory could have gained the additional
clearance is to have altered the *mounting* for the springs, probably by
welded the spring flange slightly higher up on the shock for 16&quot; Vanagon.

&gt;&gt;Hopefully, the front shocks for the 16&quot; version of the Vanagon would have
&gt;&gt;the effect of raising the vehicle further off the ground but we cannot tell
&gt;&gt;without actually ordering them to see. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I can't see how the absorber could raise the height of the vehicle without
&gt;also changing the springs.  With the standard springs a longer shock would
&gt;just squish down more since it doesn't actually carry the load of the
&gt;vehicle, but just &quot;absorbs&quot; bouncing motions.

Not for the Syncro, Jim.

&gt; A longer shock might even
&gt;bottom out when squished to the shorter ride height.
