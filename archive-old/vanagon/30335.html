&gt; I suppose this will fall into the Wacky Idea File.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's say a Wannabus-type person finds a bus.  And old bus.  He/they/it
&gt; probably doesn't have a lot of experience with buses, isn't sure if it's
&gt; fairly priced or may not understand the significance of opening the passenger
&gt; door and having it come off in their hand.  Of course, they'll buy the thing
&gt; anyway.  Then comes the problem of getting it home so they can spend a
&gt; zillion dollars on it, weeping salt tears onto their keyboard every night as
&gt; they belabor the list with their woes.
&gt; 
&gt; I say its time we got orgamized.  Or organized.  One of those.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we need a kind of Old Bus Recovery Squad, a group of us foolish
&gt; enough to respond to requests for on-site assistance with regard to
&gt; evaluating the mechanical condition of old buses, providing our skill and
&gt; expertese extracting said from bogs for the purpose of trailering, towing or
&gt; driving (shrill laughter) the wreck to where ever the new owner wishes to
&gt; commit mechanical seppuku.
&gt; 
&gt; Would anyone care to flesh out this idea?  
&gt;

I have to agree with Bob. I've seen too many people getting ripped off 
with extremely crappy buses just to drive one. I'd volunteer up here in  
Alberta if anyone needed the help.
