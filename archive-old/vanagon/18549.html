Subject: bodega update 6/1


This will probably be the last Bodega post, unless anything important changes. 
 
The 2 evening meals, and the 2 breakfasts are potluck.  Lunches are 
do-your-own as are utensils/serving things/pots/lunch/ booze/whatever.  Bring 
whatever you want to BBQ for Friday nite.  Also, don't forget your 
reservation/confirmation/number info or tix, plus:  firewood (lots!), folding 
chairs, ice, (see below).  

Again, it is recommended that one person in the paired groups (either already 
formed, or yet to be formed) get a reservation thru MISTIX to insure positive 
space.  If you want to get adjoining sites, you will do well to arrive early on 
Friday.  Check-in time is 2 p.m., but the ranger says he lets people in a noon 
to help the cause.  

I&quot;m bringing stuff for smores, and charcoal for BBQ.  We could probably still 
use some non-official snack-type (like to eat while drinking) foods.  
Otherwise, can still use signups in catogories with a &quot;?.&quot;  If you do decided 
to bring any of these, please let me know, so I don't duplicate your efforts.  
If anyone needs to reach me by phone, it's:  510.376.4321.
