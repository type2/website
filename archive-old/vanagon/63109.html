Subject:      87' Vanagon Motor

Hi,

I have a 87' Vanagon with 64Kmiles on its little 2.1l motor.  I like to
sell the motor away in like to 3-5 months so I can rake up some cash to
start my SUBARU 2.5l motor conversion.

What is a fair price I can get for my motor?  It's runs great, excellent
compression, never had coolant leaking problems and really clean.  I took
care of this baby with good gas, synthetic motor oil and lot's of TLC!

Anyone with some ideas, pls share with me.

Thanks,
Jack Ck.
