Subject: 	Q: one vs. two Carbs

I have the opportunity to put a weber progressive carb on my 73 bus.
This carb would replace the two original solexes.  I have owned the
bus for approximately 1 year and the carbs have proven to be the weak
link.  Last June, Bob (Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com) of this list wrote an
excellent posting on this issue.  Unfortunately, he is out to
win races down in the Baha, I'm only out to beat the bus next to
me to the next redlight.  A local VW guru thinks I should stick
to the dual carbs.  He says if they are running good, they will out-
perform the weber due to the shorter intake distances.  I like the
idea of one carb instead of two headaches.  Is the difference in
performance significant?
