Just for you diesel people out there,
My engine made a strange sound this morning after it started.  It went 
away after the engine warmed up, but it sounded a whole lot like the
knocking one gets when the fuel pump is advanced.  Does anyone out there
have any idea (I know, this is asking a lot) what this might me?  Could
it be a rod bearing that somehow does not get enough oil until the engine
warms up?
Stuart
