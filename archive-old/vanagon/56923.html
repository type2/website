Subject: Frond end Knocking on 83

        The roads in my area are absolutely attrocious this winter due to no
snow clearance and another winter of record snow falls. This has forced me
to do some of the harshest off roading Ive ever done right in my back alley. 
        About 3 weeks ago I noticed that as I went over the crappy roads,
there was a knocking coming from the front end, mostly on the left side I
think, but Im biased as I was driving on the left side....go figure eh!
        So....do I finally have to do my CV joints or what?
