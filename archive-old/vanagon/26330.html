&gt;&gt; &gt;Don't respond to the SPAMs.  Let Joel handle it, please.  Save our
&gt;&gt; &gt;bandwidth for something more important-Like FFFFriday Follies!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; uhhhhhh ... well, you see ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a reminder to all that this list is a product of Gerry's time, effort, 
and
&gt;&gt; generousity ... NOT mine. i'm just one of the largest set of fingers on 
the
&gt;&gt; list. ;)  i just do the Weakly Stats because it's a minor curiosity that
&gt;&gt; grew into a full-fledged obsession.

&gt;if not YOU, then who?


Well, how about nobody?

Ignore the spammers with the disinterest they deserve.
They'll lose interest and go away.
