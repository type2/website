Subject: '86 Vanagon Master Cylinder bust?


The brakes on my van have been rather squishy as of late so I took it in to
the local mechanic to give it the once over.  Now, I already have plans to
replace one rear wheel cylinder and the rear shoes (we drove for a 1/2 hour
w/ the emergency brake on.  dunce!) and basically wanted a 'professional'
opinion to make sure I wasn't overlooking anything.  Well, he said that in
addition to the parts I was going to replace, that the master brake cylinder
would need replacing as well, however he could not give me a reason *why*
it should be replaced.  He simply said that it's &quot;going bad and needs to be
replaced&quot;.  That just wasn't good enough for me.
I did adjust the rear brakes this morning and they they are now solid.  Any
reasons why the mechanic would suggest the master cylinder is bust?  Am I
being juked?  Thanks for your time....

Rik
