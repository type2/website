Subject: oil pressure/temp sensor location

I am trying to install oil pressure and oil temp gauges on my 1984 1.9L
Vanagon engine.  I have a couple of questions that I hope someone can
help me out with:

1.  I cannot find any location to install the screw in temp
    sensor that I bought.  Has anyone installed an oil temp sensor?
    If so, where did you install the sensor.

2.  The pressure sensor that I bought is quite large.  It doesn't seem
    like it will fit in the small space between the push rod tubes on the
    left head.  Is there an alternate location, or do I need to get
    another sensor?  Is the resistance of these sensors universal, so I
    can use any sensor?

3.  I would like to preserve the idiot light function in addition to my
    new gauge.  Can I just use a brass t-fitting and screw both sensors
    into the t and screw the t into the crankcase?

I hope somebody can help solve the frustrating problems!

Thanks,

John Brown
