Subject: '71 Bus is no longer PO'd! and Home Page updated


Mr. Bob Hoover's suggestions have proved to be right on the mark!
He pointed out the missing plug in the carb and the gaping hole in the
tin where the preheater hose once was.

I found the plug and replaced it with a sealer, and installed three new
hoses (two fresh-air heat, I used to have the fan shroud ports covered;
and one preheater hose to the air cleaner inlet). Checked the air seal
around the engine tin, found it to be in good shape. Now the engine can
draw air ONLY through the elephant-ear inlets in the upper rear corners
of the bus, as Dr. Porsche intended.

Result: It starts and runs like the bus of old. Took it on a shirt drive,
and it ran well, idled smoothly, though it still conked out once while
cold, restarted easily. VASTLY different from when the prospective buyers
came to see it, natch. It didn't overheat on this short trip (5 miles),
but its previous tendency was to overheat on LONG trips, so this part
of the solution remains untested. But I can just *feel* the good Karma
starting to flow from this bus. I hope.


BTW, I've updated my Home Page-- couple more pictures, some more text
descriptions. I'll put pix of the V6anagon there as soon as I get them
developed and scanned.
