Subject: Aftermarket O2 Sensor for 89 Van??


I was recently at the dealer and inquired about a new O2 sensor for my 89 
Westy.  I just about fell over when I was told $180.00.  I decided to check 
for aftermarket parts knowing I spent $38 for my wife's Chevy S-10 pickup. 
 The aftermarket sensor made by NTK (Japan) cost $80 and required a splice 
into the original connector.  I'll let everybody know if the camper passes 
New Jersey emissions.  Has anybody had bad experiences with aftermarket O2 
sensors?  How long do the original Bosch sensors last?

Pete
