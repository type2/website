Subject:      FFriday Follies ... well, it's Friday for me. ;)

ok, so i ain't gonna be here tomorrow, then today must be Friday. right?
so here it is, folks:


Buses

Oh, there are no Microbuses down in Hell,
Oh, there are no Microbuses down in Hell,
Oh, the place is full of Vettes,
Lots of people with regrets!
But! There are no Microbuses down in Hell.

Oh, there are no Buses left in I-o-wa,
Oh, there are no Buses left in I-o-wa,
When the GNATT tour rolled on through,
They all left and went with you.
Oh, there are no Buses left in I-o-wa.

Oh, there are no Vanagons in Ala-bam,
Oh, there are no Vanagons in Ala-bam,
Bubba drives a Ford instead,
Or a Chevy that is red,
But! there are no Vanagons in Ala-bam.

Oh, there are no Eurovans here in the States,
Oh, there are no Eurovans here in the States,
They are off on foreign shores,
Driven round by high-priced whores,
But! There are no Eurovans here in the States.

Oh, there are no Microbuses way up North,
Oh, there are no Microbuses way up North,
Cause the Eskimos decided
They don't like the snow insided!
Oh, there are no Microbuses way up North.

Oh, the California Buses are the best,
Oh, the California Buses are the best,
Cause they shimmy and they shake,
And it feels just like a Quake!
Oh, the California Buses are the best.

Oh, the Vanagons have engines in the rear,
Oh, the Vanagons have engines in the rear,
And the deck is low and flat,
Now, what do you make of that!
Oh, the Vanagons have engines in the rear.

Oh, the Eurovans have engines in the front,
Oh, the Eurovans have engines in the front,
And the pistons now are five,
In a line! Ain't that some jive!
Oh, the Eurovans have engines in the front.
