Subject: FOR SALE: 1971 VW Bus 


FOR SALE: 1971 Volkswagon Bus 

Perfect fixer-upper.  The body and original green paint are in
excellent condition, and the transmission, tires and brakes are in
good shape.  The engine runs, but needs work.  The vehicle has not
been driven for three years (and not regularly for about five) and has
very low mileage for its age (about 125K miles).

Asking $550 or b/o.  If interested, reply to jhwang_at_isl.stanford_dot_edu 
or by phone: Jim (415) 321-8141.
