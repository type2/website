I found terminals mislabeled  while working on the radiator fan's relay.
Double check (trace) the wiring to be sure.
Good Luck

&gt; My first thought to test the rear wiper relay was to get a piece of
wire with blade connectors at each end and connect terminals 53 and 15
on the relay - figuring that this should send power to the rear wiper.
(I verified that there was 12V at one 
&gt;terminal)
