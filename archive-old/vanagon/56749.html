Hello Vanagoneers:

First I'd like to compliment Ron 'Coyote' Lussier's great new web site.  
I'd highly recommend it to everybody on the list.  It's not yet 
complete, but there's plenty there to enjoy.  I liked the link to the 
Volkswagen of Germany website that shows pictures of the new Eurovans.  
I hated the way they looked at first, but now I'm slowly coming around 
(especially if they offer them here with six cylinders).  There's also a 
link to the MSDS Panzerwagen Page.  I remember reading about this 
vehicle a few years ago in a VW magazine, but I don't think my van is 
eligible because it's an automatic.  Does anyone know for sure?

Secondly, there was a thread about the Peter Russek Manual a few weeks 
ago.  Well, I asked Drew at Auto-Bound Books (510) 521-8755 to order one 
from England for me, and he called me back a couple of weeks later to 
tell me that his distributor had just started stocking this very book. I 
just received mine today. It is a joint publication of Brooklands and 
Peter Russek Publications, and is titled &quot;Volkswagen Transporter 
Workshop Manual (from 1982 on).&quot;  It is devoted to water cooled Vanagons 
and might be thought of as a follow-up to the Hayes Transporter Manual 
for air-cooled models.  There are no photographs, just diagrams, but 
most of the diagrams are amazingly detailed, with especially nice 
drawings of the cooling system lay-out and fuel injection components.  
BUT . . . It costs $29.95 for a 176 page book.
However, it is nice to have something to supplement the Bentley manual 
for those of us with waterboxers.
