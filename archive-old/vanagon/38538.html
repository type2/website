Subject: Engine purchase opportunity?

Hi All,
	I have been on the list for a little over a week.  I have really 
enjoyed reading all the mail.  I have a '67 camper that I am hoping to 
restore. I bought it with no engine, but I now have the opportunity to 
purchase an engine.  The engine is in a '68 bus near Philidelphia and 
costs $100. The owner says that it runs, or at least that is what the old 
man who sold it to him said. He is moving and needs to get rid of the 
van.  I have no idea how much an engine would cost.  I would greatly 
appreciate any advice.  Also, are there any other parts on that van that 
could be of use to help me with my van.  Thank you all for your advice in 
advance!
