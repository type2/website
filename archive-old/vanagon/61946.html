I sort of want to find these too so appreciate if you let us know results of
your search.

For just a canoe, I suggest you consider doing what we do and just mount the
canoe right on the Westy roof. We added a little rubber at the ends of the
roof to keep it from scuffing the paint off and attach the canoe to the van
to D-Rings I put in the roof for this purpose.

No roof rack needed.

If you put the d-rings in the roof only on the part of the roof that goes
up, then you can still put the roof up at camping time and have the canoe up
there.

&gt;I have seen many posts about the Yakima and Thule &quot;gutter&quot; adapters for the
&gt;Westy Roof. Is there a best location for them? Will be caring canoe. Also
&gt;in Augusta last summer, I saw a late Westy with tall towers attached to the
&gt;rain gutters that were made of small dia tube steel, bent in form of &quot;A&quot;,
&gt;black finish, not cast or milled. Anyone else seen these?
