Subject: Tent pages finally updated

I finally got around to updating the tent pages, to include:

updated info and photos on the early-splittie &quot;foyer&quot; tent
at last, a photo of a westy rear-end tent
far-out photos of Eurovan tents

More to come.  Please have a look and point out any broken links, 
misinfo, etc.

Thanks again to dworkin_at_village_dot_org for hosting some of this stuff.
