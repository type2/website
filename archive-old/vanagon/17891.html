Well, it is official!  The good folks at GEX are right now setting 
their wrenches in action on my new 1600DP.  Now is not the time for 
GEX horror stories.  I promise the next motor will be built by me.  My
old bus needs so much work on the brakes and suspension I didn't 
figure I needed the headache of a first rebuild on top of it.  If 
anybody is curious, the cost was $926.65 without a core.  New case, 
heads, etc.  This includes shipping to my dad's door.  I sure am glad 
he finally retired so he can sit at home and sign for boxes of VW 
parts.
