Subject:       Near (computer) death experience

This is a Toyota (aack, urp yeah I know) story but very relevant.  2 
weeks ago my car died on me and wouldn't restart.  I checked the ECU 
trouble code and it showed either the temp sensor (NOT! wouldn't make 
the car completely dead) or ECU failure (oh, God).  Recalling many 
sermons from my father on connectors and their propensity for 
corrosion and failure, I unplugged the ECU wiring harnesses and 
plugged them in several times.  Hit the key and everything ran 
WONDERFULLY!  This all happened about 120 miles from home.  Hasn't 
had a problem since (fingers crossed).
