I read an article in a US VW magazine from a few years ago
(can't remember which one) on rebuilding type IV motors.  They,
too, stressed not to over tighten the oil strainer retaining
nut.  The article explained that the bolt on which the oil 
strainer is tightened attaches to the section of case which houses 
one of the camshaft bearings.  Over tightening the oil strainer nut 
will distort this housing, causing bad things to happen to the
camshaft and bearing.
