Subject: Fill propane yourself


I occaisonally fill my tank from another (portable) tank. In an 
emergency, I dump a disposable canister of propane into the tank. I 
picked up this habit in Mexico where they often require that the tank be 
weighed or where the hose was too short...

Does anybody else do this? What catastrophes am I inviting? 

And while I'm on the subject, I would love to buy a Westy (Manchester) 
propane tank. If anyone has any leads.....
