Subject: Cooling System Capacity and Front Heater Valve Assembly and Cable

I replaced the leaking &quot;T&quot; Piece on my '85 Vanagon today, I figured since
lots of coolant would be lost that I would go ahead and drain the system
entirely, flush and refill.  I know the cooling system is supposed to hold
18--19 quarts but I could only get three gallons in.  I probably only got
three gallons in last year and have had no overheating problems.  I did the
bleeding and after much time the stream ran bubble free, but not at 2500
RPM, where I got no stream at all, but at normal idle where the stream ran
steady and bubble free.  By the way, I only put 1 gallon of Sierra in,
decided to stick with the P.G. despite what seems like evidence to the
contrary that it is beneficial.  I figure that I'll be making additional
bleeding efforts and put more P.G. in when I do that.

Is there 1 gallon worth of crud in my radiator?  I noticed when I shut the
engine off, I heard lots of gurgling in the engine compartment from hoses as
coolant headed back toward the expansion tank.  Does this indicate that I
still have air in my system?  I have also given up trying to fill the system
with the vehicle level, I fill it pointing the van downhill so that the
radiator will fill.  After that, I turn the van around (uphill) so I can
raise the front end on wheel ramps (my driveway has a short, steep incline
so the front is at least 15&quot; above the back).  Has anyone here managed to
refill their cooling systems with the van level?

I was hoping that the van came to me last November with a new radiator--I
noticed this time the date stamped just below the bleeder screw,
unfortunately it is just as old as the van--an '85.

Regarding the clip I purchased to reattach my heater control cable to the
valve...  I can't have possibly been given the right part.  I have a cable,
I have a post with a small hole in it that I assume the cable passes through
that attaches to the control lever on the valve.  What Ellis ordered for me
is a shaped piece of flat metal (part number 823-819-679) that cannot
possibly attach to either the cable or the post.  I didn't see how the
arrangement worked originally since it was missing when I noticed I had no
heater control action.  Dan told me it would be a pain in the ass to get in,
I can accept that, I just don't think I could have the right part.

Anyone have a Polaroid who would be willing to photograph this since it
doesn't show up on my dealer's microfiche?  Or better, anyone in the Atlanta
area willing to let me come look above their spare tire?  I realize that you
hardly know me and that's a terribly personal area but I promise to respect
you in the morning.

Thanks for the barrage of suggestions I know I will get in advance.
