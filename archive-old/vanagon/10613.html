So Dean Paul Karpowicz says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;the yards to protect the environment.  I always recycle it if it is
&gt; &gt;anything more than what gets spilled on the floor in the garage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;-David
&gt; Recycle it where???  around here in the Midwest there are no places of that
&gt; I know that recycle the sh*t.  The community recycling center only does Oil,
&gt; and states in large letters NO ANTIFREEZE.  The only thing I have heard
&gt; around here is &quot;just dump it down the drain, the sewage treatment plant can
&gt; handle it in small amounts.&quot;.
&gt; 

If you have a radiator shop, I'm sure they'd be happy to take it.
