Subject: Re: Parts suppliers ID'd in this list: CAUTION

Still waiting for a part ordered from good ol' David Heard. Sent check three
weeeks ago. Called last week and confirmed receiving shipment &quot;in three
days.&quot; One week later I call the phone number to find it disconnected. If
anyone sees our buddy let him know that ol' Rusty is wishing to discuss the
situation as gentleman.  Please have him call.

On a completely separtate note I was watching a movie last night about a guy
at a carshow. Someone that he didnt even recognise stepped out of the crowd
and and popped him right in his NOS mouth! It had a happy ending.  Hmmm...
