Subject: Party at Ron Salmon's house Sat.
Date: Thu, 12 Jun 1997 23:13:35 -0400

My wife and I are having a big outdoor party at our house this Saturday. 
Dogs &amp; burgers on the grill, a couple of kegs, and at least one or two
Westies staying over Saturday night (along with their owners).  Not
exclusively a VW event (although there will be a rather large
representation of VW owners), but I thought I'd issue the invite to any
list members who happen to be nearby.  We're in Perkiomenville, Pa.
(between Pottstown and Quakertown, Pa., about an hour from Philly or 1/2
hour from Allentown or Reading).  All welcome.  Starts around 3 pm
Saturday, and goes on late into the night (and maybe starts again the next
morning depending on how many stay over :)  Anyone who needs directions can
e-mail me, or call (610) 754-8989 or 754-8901.
