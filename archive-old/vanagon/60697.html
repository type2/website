Subject: Problem with '89 Westy - Automatic
Date: Fri, 30 May 1997 10:54:01 -0500

Hi,
I've got an '89 West with an automatic transmission.  It's got about 66k 
miles on it and it has had an engine oil leak between the transmission and 
the engine (front oil seal?).

Is this a common problem?

Has anyone replaced one?  I guess you have to drop the transmission.  Any 
help?

Can it be done without the nifty round tool (VW191) shown in Bentley?
