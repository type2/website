Subject: '67 bus brake line

Tim McKane emailed me a question about the brake line between the front
wheel cylinders on his '67 bus.  I replied, but it bounced.  I imagine the
poor guy is in a world of hurt, since his line broke, so here's my reply to
him, and maybe he'll get the info from the list here:

&gt; I have a 67 westy and while replacing the front wheel cylinders the line
&gt;that connects to both of the cylinders cracked.. noone(so far) seems to 
&gt;have a replacement.. I went to Pep Boys, one was to long and the other
&gt;length to short.. someone told me to buy a pipe flarer and cut it down,,
&gt;Do you know if you can buy the correct piece still?

I just looked:  Wolfsburg West has it, part # 211 611 505B $4.00

WW: (714) 630-9653

How's that?
