 &gt; You don't need to remove the axle nut to remove the half-shaft when doing 
 &gt; CVJs.  Just remove the six allen bolts at either end of the shaft, and 
 &gt; drop the shaft out.  

This is good to know but I don't think they are Allen bolts.  I haven't looked 
under my Vanagon to be sure, but if it's like my Jetta, they are 8mm 
&quot;triple-square&quot;, with 12-pointed star-shaped holes in the heads. These are NOT 
Torx either, so don't get Torx drivers for them.  I believe they are called 
&quot;triple-square&quot; because the shape of the hole is like three small squares 
superimposed to make a star shape.

I ruined two K-D 8mm triple-square tools on the drive flanges of the Jetta 
before breaking down and getting one from the Snap-On man.  It was worth every 
penny -- it just worked, unlike the K-D's, which just broke.  I don't normally 
buy tools from Snap-On because they are a bit pricey, but this time I made an 
exception.  (If I were to be a pro mechanic the first thing I'd do would be 
sell my soul for a complete set of Snap-On tools -- if you use 'em every day, 
all day, you can't get anything better.)

And technically, these bolts aren't even bolts at all, but screws.  Bolts take 
nuts on the end... (yes, yes, the same gizmo can be a bolt AND a screw 
depending on how you use it.  Floor wax AND dessert topping, too.)
