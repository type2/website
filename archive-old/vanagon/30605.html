Subject: /f Top speed

I don't know why anyone's concerned about speed. Since the rebuild, I can
get up to about 102 FPS with no problem. And even though I'd only make it
to about 66 FPS going up hill with a stiff wind in my nose, I can't do that
on my bicycle...or in cheap tennis shoes.

When you measure in feet-per-second, these buses really fly!

Then there are the Steve Mahers of the world who can replace the FPS with
MPH and still have some pedal left.

        8) Joe (happy enough when the '71 campmobile isn't parked for
repairs,
                like it is now.)
