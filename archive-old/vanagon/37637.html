Subject: 1600 DP Valve Installation...

Volks, 

Is it necessary to install valve stem seals on a 1600 DP?  When I ordered
my valves, keepers, valve springs, etc. from MOFOCO, they informed me that 
it is not necessary to install the rubber seals on the valve stems.  Won't
I be burning oil if I don't?  Are these suckers included in the engine
gasket set?  Help!

TIA,
