Subject: Good rubber

What kind of tires does everyone run on their vans? I have a pair of 185R14 
Marshals on the front (non-reinforced I believe) and Continentals on the back. 
In the winter I have a pair of Michelin reinforced winters for the back. I just
had to replace one of the Marshals due to a broken steel belt. I found out that they are no longer made and had some difficulty matching the remaining Marshal.
I found a used Marshal that was identical with similar wear, so I will replace 
them both probably next spring. What are your suggestions for a summer or 
all-season replacement? The Michelin XZX and LT195 have been suggested locally.
Anyone heard of these or use them?
