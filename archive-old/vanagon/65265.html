&gt; My previous post about &quot;cold start stalling&quot; has turned out to be a bad
&gt; mass air flow sensor.  VW has one in stock but I can't mortgage my house
&gt; for that much money!  Does anyone have an aftermarket source for a new
&gt; (reliable) one that I could get &quot;overnighted&quot; to me?   Appreciate
&gt; responses, leaving on trip Friday.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
