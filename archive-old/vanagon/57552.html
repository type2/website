Subject: pinnacles lost/found


A great time was had by all this past weekend at Pinnacles.  Anyone
want to write up a trip report?  :)

Anyway, I have in my bus some assorted things which were lost/found:

nice down jacket or liner
speckle-ware coffee pot
mess kit pieces (I think, not sure)
2 folding chairs
maybe other stuff you might be missing


Lemme know to whom they belong.  Can mail them or save them for
the next campout.

Was great to see so many new faces on this last trip.  Special
thanks to Bill Just (Just Bill  :), from my internet type 181 thing
list, who joined us, and patiently drove everyone around in his
cool thing, and/or let them drive themselves.  Yay, Bill.  Hope
more thing people come camping next time. :)
