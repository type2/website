Subject: Found a 21-window sunroof deluxe!  Too bad it's cheese.

Evening all!

A few weeks ago a friend of mine told me about a bus behind his barn.  I'd
been meaning to go and look at it but never got around to it until last
Tues.  Turns out it was a grun/weiss 21 Window sunroof deluxe that someone
had abandoned about 20 years ago.  I was excited for about 30 seconds when I
realized it has a terminal case of body rot.  Bummer.  If you opened the
front door and pushed a little farther the entire front end moved out.

I pulled off everything that looked useful: tail-lights, VW emblem, 4
skylights and managed to dig out the back and pull the motor.  I pulled
useful stuff I needed off of the motor but don't really have much use for
the rest of it.  The number on the motor points to a '64 Beetle which seems
reasonable.  So, what is this thing, a 1300?  Anybody in the MD/DC/VA area
want it?  The motor looks ok but doesn't turn.

Oh, I don't need the skylights so if anybody needs/wants 'em, let me know.
They all seem to be fine &amp; crack-free but I'll have to double check.  I'm
planning on attending the next Bug Out in Manassas, VA and will try and
bring this stuff with me if nobody speaks up.

Bob J.

p.s. The next day I was going to go back and yank the tranny but someone
came and hauled the carcass away!
