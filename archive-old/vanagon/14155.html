Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome



&gt;&gt;&gt;I am sure you folks with the later VW buses don't have this problem, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;recently I've taken on the chore of restoring the interior chrome in my bus.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I've tried several methods and have had varying success, can anyone offer
&gt;&gt;&gt;the best solution? snipo
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond' suggest
&gt;&gt;using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly toxic (it is for
&gt;&gt;this reason that you don't compost them)
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Now that's an interesting potion.  If I were to experiment with rhubarb
&gt;leaves, where does one get these?

for rhubarb leaves i would suggest looking in your closest vegetable
garden. BTW rhubarb pies are quite delicious too. Rhubarb leaves are of no
use to anybody (other than polishing chrome??), so if you know somebody you
know grows rhubarb, ask them for the leaves.

I haven't actually *tried* the rhubarb leaves for polishing, but i do
remeber seeing some mention of them a while back, however it might have
been in the context of polishing alloy wheels. why not give it a try though
and see what happens. Obviously you would want to try it on some
unimportant piece of chrome first, lest there be disasterous effects!
