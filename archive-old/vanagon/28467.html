Subject: Sorry...


I'll take some of the responsibility for the fallout of the
fanning of the flames for litterary quality which went on
the past couple of days. Yes, I do have strong feelings on
the subjects.

As to &quot;martino&quot;, well, as WC Fields once put it: &quot;Never give
a sucker an even break!&quot;

On to more challenging vanagon subjects! 

Ric
