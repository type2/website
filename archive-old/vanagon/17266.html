Subject: Re: Directional Signals

&gt;Has anyone had a problem with the front turn signal(amber) housings 
&gt;filling with water after a heavy rain?  Ours has filled on several 
&gt;occasions causing corrosion of the wires and damage to the bulb socket.  
&gt;Does anyone know if a good after market gasket is made to fill in the 
&gt;small space between the body and the lamp housing?  Thanks!

Lewis,
Please let me know if someone posts a solution to this directly to you.  I 
have the same problem on my '73.
