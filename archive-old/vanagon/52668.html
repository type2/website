Subject: Re: Engine blown...

&gt; miles. I don't think I saw a newly rebuilt engine for less than $1,300. And
&gt; the range of prices I found, went up steeply to $4,000.
&gt;    I decided to rebuild from 2 blown engines (with different areas &quot;blown&quot;),
&gt; and many new parts.  So far, 300 miles on rebuildt, so good.

AVP (800)548-5766 and one might get away just under $1300 but without
a salvageable core, and with the destruction spoken of sounds like 
rod through block, may run you more.
