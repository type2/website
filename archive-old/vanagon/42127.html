&gt;Does anyone here know about an Isuszu Trooper relabeled as a Volkswagen?
&gt;I passed one of these today on I495 (DC Beltway) and suspect it was
&gt;someone with a weird sense of humor.  Looked like the various logos off
&gt;of a vanagon.  Had a VW vinyl cover for the spare tire as well.

are you SURE it was a Trooper?? and not maybe an imported VW Ilitis??
VW makes a trooper-looking sort of vehicle for the german army.

if not, then someone does indeed have a very strange sense of humor. :)
