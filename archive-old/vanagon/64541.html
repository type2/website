Subject:      crash damage, Van front end

&gt;would cost us at least our feet, at most....

not to mention having coolant sprayed all over ya and the dashboard
in your lap maybe.

I  read  the  89 Vanagon was the safest minivan for that year, going
by  how many  people died in crashes. eewww
ive been driving type 2s since  I was 17, I hardly ever think about a
bad  front end crash....all ya can do is defensive driving  and have
good brakes! (and seat belts)
