&gt;&gt; Please, please don't turn that blabbermouth Steve with his V6anagon loose
&gt;&gt; on us again! All he does is talk about how great the engine in it is,
&gt;&gt; how macho he is as a result, etc. etc.!
&gt;
&gt;Steve, do I sence irritation concerning our ceaseless teasing and
&gt;prodding about your V6anagon?  :)

Naah, just happy for a chance to dish it out at last.   :^)


&gt;I just want you to know that if I had a Vanagon and a Citation and IF
&gt;IT WERE POSSIBLE I would fuse them together into one fabulous
&gt;creation of iron and plastic, and I'd call it &quot;Vanatation&quot;  And it
&gt;would have 8 wheels, two engines, and it would have &quot;Hoverability&quot;
&gt;and I would drive it on land and by sea.

Hear that, folks? Go get 'im!

P.S. Let me know when you start production-- I'll spring for one.


&gt;And the great VW god would
&gt;smite vengence on me and I would sink to a wasser(boxer)y grave.

...by putting the original engine back in, I assume?   ;-)
