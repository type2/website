Subject:      Injector Wiring Order?

Hi All,

Is there any specific order that the injectors must be wired
on an '84 digijet model?  I would have thought that they
needed to be wired in an orderly fashion like spark plugs.
However, they all have the same color wires and, other than
two being on each side, I don't know which wire goes to
which injector. Could they all be firing simultaneously, and
thus can the wires go any which way?
