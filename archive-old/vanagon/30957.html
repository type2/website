Subject: Found: used Kadrons for sale

I hope I don't get flamed for this but 

I found a pair of Kadrons with manifolds and linkage while
traveling last week.  The manifolds are Berg.


They have only been used for about 2500 miles, look brand new
and come with the chrome air cleaners.

$300 get them. (It's what I gave for em).

If anyone is interested, call me.
