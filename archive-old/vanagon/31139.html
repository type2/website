Subject: RE: Vanagon Verified


&gt;I took my 84 Vanagon to go get verified for California EPA (and avoid
&gt;the $500 non-Cali charge. Mind you, I wasn't sure if it was a Cali
&gt;car or not, I couldn't find the sticker)
&gt;
&gt;I went in, lifted, the engine door and the inspector went to work
&gt;with a flashlight, rag and pen. It felt just like taking a driver's
&gt;test for the first time. When he fianlly handed my the piece of
&gt;paper, I asked if it was a California EPA car. He mumbled and walked
&gt;off.
&gt;
&gt;It was! I'm going to frame that verification reciept. This is a
&gt;Christmas gift indeed..


Congrats, Matt!

I'm envious. When I bring the V6anagon in, they'll probably take one look
at it, and shoot me on sight. And then impound the car.
