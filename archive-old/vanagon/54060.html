&gt; Happy Friday!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at an '86 Weekender GL that has these symptoms. After the van
&gt; has been sitting for a long period of time (&gt; 10 hours), the van will idle
&gt; rough and spew white smoke from the tail pipe. After letting it idle a
&gt; couple minutes, it smooths out, the white smoke disappears, and the van
&gt; runs fine. The PO says it doesn't overheat and has been doing this for
&gt; about six months. She took it to VW dealer and they diagnosed it as leaky
&gt; head gaskets and quoted her $3000 (Yikes!). Anyway, now she's selling it
&gt; for a song. She's been driving it like this for 6 months and she says the
&gt; condition hasn't gotten worse and she keeps checking the coolant and has
&gt; only has to add very small amounts on 2-3 occasions, &quot;a splash or so&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't heard of this symptom for a head gasket leak before? Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I'll need to drive the van about 300 flat miles to get it home. Is
&gt; this ok as long as I keep checking the temp and coolant in both tanks?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, this may lead to the sale of my trusty '83.5 wasserboxer weekender gl,
&gt; but that's another post...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

  BY running a motor with coolant I the combustion chamber you
      run the risk of cracking the head(s). 300 miles will easily
      do that.                       Eric Zeno
