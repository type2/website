Subject: Conversion vans


Does anybody have any information on a conversion company called 
Adventure Campers?  I have a '71 which has a fiberglass shell on top and 
has been converted into a very comfortable camper. The window sticker 
says that this company is located in Sylmar CA and Burlingame CA.  I got 
this vehicle ~1.5 years ago from a guy who had driven it back to Illinois 
from San Francisco.  It had been his uncle's and had been used to camp in 
the desert at a missle test site.  He said his uncle had been involved in 
the development of the trident missle (no bad gum jokes please... like 4 
out of 5 VW owners prefer trident for their busses which have missles)  
Anyway, this guy said that he thought that the company was still in 
business and I would like to see if I can get some background info on 
&quot;blue boy&quot;  so any information would be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
dave.
