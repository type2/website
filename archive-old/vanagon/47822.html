Welcome to the Vanagon community.  I don't think that you'll find many (if
any) on the Vanagon list that will suggest that you've made a mistake.  That
said, any 11 year old vehicle is going to need a little care from time to
time.

Regarding the thermostat:  While changing the thermostat is a quick and
simple procedure, that's not the whole story.  Water cooled Vanagons such as
ours require a special procedure to remove air from the cooling system after
it's been opened, like when replacing a thermostat.  While the procedure
isn't rocket science, don't replace the thermostat until you know the
procedure.  Also, don't let a shop do the work unless they know about this
required procedure.  I don't have the procedure available to me right know or
I'd include it.  Basically it involves jacking the front of the van up 16&quot;
higher than the rear, opening a bleeding bolt, running the engine, etc, etc,
etc.  I'd buy a Bentley repair manual ($70 to $90) if I were you.

Regarding the A/C compressor:  Replacing the compressor is no big deal
either, but finding a replacement may be a little bit of work.  If your 85 is
like my 87 &amp; 88, it uses a Sanden 510 compressor, which is in ample supply,
but with a head that's not very common.  You might need to use your old head
on a new compressor to be able to attach it directly to your hoses.  Be
prepared to pay $28 to $40 per LB for the 2.5(??) Lbs of Freon (R12) you'll
need to charge the system after replacement of the compressor.  Also, unless
your certain that all the Freon has already leaked out, don't open the system
up yourself - take it to a shop that can properly remove the Freon and have
it recycled.  Make sure you get any leaks fixed befor recharging or you'll be
buying a second batch (another $90) of Freon real soon.

Good luck,
