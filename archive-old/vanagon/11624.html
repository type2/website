.(in hot water-it IS flammable) or dilute it.  Looks yellowish with pale wax in

If possible, get the black stuff. The yellow stuff is used on normal car 
bodywork, buffed off like a  normal polish. The black stuff is ultra-gloopy 
adn is designed for chassis. It's also bloody hard to find, so I usually use 
teh yellow stuff :(

.remained well coated.  This waxoyl is on like glue, everywhere, with nothing
.under it, and it ain't goin' nowhere.  As time goes on and the remaining 
.solventin it evaporates, it seems to slowly spread, and not spread thin but 
.kindathicken.  Hunkerin' down for winter.  My axle housings and springs, 
.previously

You think THAT is sticky, wait till you see teh black.......
