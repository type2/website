Subject: A little trip (with roadside repairs!!)

Hey now,
        The SO &amp; I went for a fun little drive through the Texas Hill
Country on Saturday, got to help out a biker, and even got to break down
and crawl under!! Great fun was had by all...

        Started with a quick valve clearance and oil check at 10 am, then
North on I-35 out of Austin, to Georgetown. Cut in on state road 29 to
Burnet. Power seemed sqeamish, and a little slow, so I started wondering
about that damned distributor drive gear (for those new and those who
forgot, my DP 1600 had a distributor drive spacer left out at rebulid-eats
distibutors at the rate of 1 per every 1.5 yrs or so). As we rolled down
the hill coming into Burnet, she backfired, coughed, and went to bed for
some rest. We coasted on into a general store parking lot, and I began
inspection. Sure enough, the bottom of the distributor had been eaten. And
this time I had no spare (when it went out in Vega$ at the Dead shows last
year, I just dropped in a new one). After 1.5 hrs of hack engineering
(stretching &amp; filing the dist. clamp so the dist. would drop farther into
the hole), and a bolt from the equipment rental place next door (KUDOS to
the Equip. rental place in Burnet on 29!!!) we were again on the road,
contemplating a proper fix. Maybe this month I can do it, although my hack
should buy me another 1.5 yrs!!! Long live VW!!!

        Rolled on down south to Longhorn caverns, then on to Inks Lake
State Park. This was the place folks. Real cool lake, few powerboats (on a
4 day weekend at that!!); lots of camping-with and without electric and
water. I go without myself, but each to his own. Both the Hill Country and
the campground reminded me of the high desert areas of California, some the
most scenic places around (IMHO) and one of my most favorite places to
camp. We're figuring on returning over New Years Weekend for some camping
and fishing, any Austin/Central Texas types like to join? (Do I see the
beginings of the Texas Camping Crazies???)

        Took off from Inks, headed south to 71, and east back to Austin. A
little ways past Lake Travis we saw a real scruffy looking biker hangin' on
the side of the road, just watching traffic. Looked like he was waiting for
someone. A few miles farther down we decided to make sure he was OK,
flipped a U, headed back. Good move, turns out he was outta gas. Name was
JB, was flying &quot;Bandidos&quot; colors, Texas. Nice hog. Shot back up to the gas
station, filled my 2 gallon can, took it back, filled him up. Said no when
he tried to give me cash, what's 2 bucks for a little Karma? And you know
Karma's working for you when you break down right next to a place that will
*give* you the hardware you need to get back on the road. The rest of the
trip was uneventful, just takin' it easy and stopping at the antique
shops-the SO loves those places. I like all the goodies, but the price tags
scare me...   :-(

        Got home about 6, all in all a great day in our bus. Looking
forward to more of them on the way to Inuvik...   ;-)

Peace,
