Subject: Help! My Bus is Braindead!

After much futzing around, and giving up, my local (good) mechanic tells 
me the FI computer on my '77 westy is on the fritz.  The symptoms are 
intermittant bucking and occasional stalls, rendering it almost 
un-drivable.  The mechanic swapped the brain for another and says the 
problem went away.  I understand a new brain from VW costs almost $600 
U.S.!  Any suggestions?  How reliable are junkyard brains, and how much 
should I expect to pay for a used one?  What kind of warrenty should I 
expect?  Are there any aftermarket sources that are cheaper and/or 
better?  I would appreciate any advice.  Thanks for listening.
