Subject: 66' Westy pop top in toronto




juat to update vanagon.lenti on the status of that 66' pop 
top that s.stones posted as few days ago. i went to see it 
last night with a fellow enthusuist friend of mine.......and 
 *he* bought it! Yep to alleviate all fears that i am 
secretley hoarding all of the busses north of the border, we 
decided it was best that he purchase it! ;)

Thanks s.stones for posting that &quot;for sale&quot; note, you can 
add (indirectly of course) one more split to the ever 
bulging vanagon.lenti northern contingent.

i'll keep you posted on the progress on the split. it has 
rocker rust on both side as well as the steering box is 
leaking, but it isn't so bad as to call the rust too far 
gone
