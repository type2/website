Hello,
I considered a similar unit. Upon reading the specs I found the same(it
stated that it would only cool 25deg low that outside air temp). Pretty
useless I found.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I received one of these as a gift a few years back.  Here in Phoenix the
&gt; summer temperatures are 100+ every day.  At 100 degrees in the shade, no
&gt; wind but in free air, the unit managed to cool 25 degrees steady state.
&gt;  So, at 75 degrees internal temperature, it was pretty useless around here.
&gt;  If the ambient temperature was 75 degrees, I infer that the device would
&gt; cool to 50 degrees, which would be a lot more useful.
&gt; 
&gt; I gave the unit away.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
