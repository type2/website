Subject: Re: Clicking in Wheels - Ideas of why?

&gt;OK, so now I got another wierd thing going on with my '86 Westy.
&gt;It is a heavy clicking that seems to be comming from the wheel(s) that is 
&gt;rotational (it speeds up when I do) and then goes away when there appears 
&gt;to be enough rotational speed to keep whatever it is in place. This is 
&gt;not a heavy metal sound, but neither does it sound &quot;tinny&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;An enterprising allignment shop wants me to believe that it is wheel 
&gt;bearings that need packing, and it may be, but it sure sounds more lke 
&gt;something that is loose at one end and swings when I slow down.
&gt;
&gt;Who has run into this before and knows what I am hearing - more 
&gt;importantly, how to cure it and is it  important to track down and fix 
&gt;right now?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks - Jack

It has to be the bearings. AS a horror story, I heard that sound in my 84 GTI.
(Rear driver side) I Ignored it and drove 1,200 miles. Just as I was getting 
off the highway at my exit (In a New Hampshire winter Nor' Easter no less) 
The whole car started to swing back and forth. As I pulled over to check the 
problem, I noticed in my rearview mirror that I could actually see the wheel 
wobble (more than 4&quot;). I limped to a station and was diagnosed as bearing 
failure.
