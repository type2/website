Al Knoll reminded me of a few things I could add to the packing list
I posted a few days ago.  Here goes:

Not only water, but CONTAINERS.  He says there's water there, we
    all just need something to put it in!   :)

Each person should brng a 16.4 oz. propane bottle.  That's PER person.

Batteries for whatever device you're bringing that uses them

Wood - fire/presto logs, scrap, kindling, regular wood, stuff you
    find at the next door construction site, etc.  Bring as much as
    you can! - if Big Sur is an indication, we'll be needing LOTS.

Pet proof:  sorry, I for got to edit this one.  What I meant was, if
    you are bringing pets, you may need to show proof of current
    vaccinations, etc.

Flannel:  despite my reputation here, the only flannel thing I own
    is a scraggly pillow, case, which I'll try to remember to bring.
    At Big Sur and Pizza, people tended to wear these things, but who
    I am I to tell you how to dress?   :)

I STILL NEED FOOD/POTLUCK SIGNUPS!  If you sign up, I'll turn off
the caps, how's that?!?!  :)
