Quite a few interesting stories of horror and such
about muffler systems.

Here are some of my observations, keeping in mind that
my dad owns 5 muffler and brake shops, and I have spent
far too much of my short life working in them.

1) One person noted that they were able to find someone to weld
in a short piece of pipe, whereas another repair place wanted to do
the whole job.   Welding in just where the rust is is called a 'pipe
repair'.  We do not like to do them for several reasons.  IF the pipe has
already rusted through in one spot, then its likely to in another
spot very soon.  While the repair may hold, if you end up repairing a different
spot, or the weld breaks becuase you welded to rust, then what was the point
in only fixing it half-assed?  We do not want people running around
saying that we fix cars half assed and that something else broke
because we didn't fix it right the first time.  Its about
pride and doing the job the right way.  This is what people should
expect from a professional repair service.

2) Vanagon parts are hard to get and expensive.  This is true for us,
perhaps because we are independents, or becuase the midwest is not teaming
with vanagon/buses.  I have looked at building my own custom exhaust
and the muffler I would use would cost me $80.  This is our actual dealer
cost.  This doesn't include any of the fittings, or tailpipes. 
The JC Whitney muffler thing looks like an excellent deal.

3) Someone else remarked that repair places always seem to be trying to
sell you another job.  Two reasons.  The first is that this is
the only way to make money, and the secon has to do with liability.
 
I recently patched a tire for some folks, and while I was reinstalling
it, I noticed that the rear disc brakes were totally non functional.
Should I have not said anything and hoped to god they didn't get killed?
What about when you notice abnormal tire wear, or bubbles?
Every single thing in a car can be a potential killer, why risk
it?  Most people do not recognize potential problems, so its important
that someone can point them out to them.

As far as plugging tires goes, we rarely do this either.  Patches work
much better and don't require that you ream out the hole to prime it
with glue and to put the plug in.  I have never heard that it will 
delaminate the belts, but when you are putting one in you can defineately
hear and feel the belts as you buff it for the plug.

Make sure the repair place uses a torque wrench on at least wheels
with disc brakes to prevent warping the rotors.  It takes very little
time to do all four wheels with a torque wrench, though, and it lessens
the chance of damaging alloy rims.


There are a ton of places out there that will screw ya.
There are also a ton that probably wont.
