Subject: Our new camper

We just bought the $300 camper that Joel forwarded to the list(thank you).
It is going to take a lot of work, but it is definately worth it.  We have
a couple of questions though:

What size screws fit the luggage rack?

What is the best way to clean the top?

The driver's side door was bent back past its limit and is now unaligned.  
It wants to close about 1cm too low.  How can we get this aligned again?

We would really appreciate any help.  Thanks in advance!
