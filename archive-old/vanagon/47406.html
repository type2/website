Subject: Re: upgrading 86-up headlights

In a message dated 96-07-24 19:39:21 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; &gt;Really?  I had been thinking of replacing the headlights on my '85 
 &gt;with the headlights from the '87 parts bus I just bought, &gt;&gt;

If you have an extra cup holder or two in your '87 parts bus...I could use
two of them.  Please E-mail direct.

Thanks,
