Don't run it to the front.  All the power in your whole bus will be
running through that wire (except the starter).  You need to use cable
that is able to withstand 30+ amps, and if you run it to the front of the
bus you need to use the next size up or better. In my Chevy I use 10
gauge, but it only runs about 4 feet, and I've never seen it go higher
than about 15 amps.  So for your purpose I owuld say I would say to use 
at least 8 gauge, and 4 gauge would be best.  David S. has his mounted in 
the back of his bus to monitor his deep cycle batteries, and he has some 
really major cable for the 1-2 foot connections.  But then he was also 
pegging his 60 amp meter.  :)
