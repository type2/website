Subject: pre 68' type II engine access hinges

For all of you that have busted engine access hinges, take heart, the
engine access hinges are the exact same (i even checked part numbers) from
64 (maybe even further back?) to 74' (i think they changed design in 75).
What this means is that you don't have to use exclusively &quot;splitty&quot; engine
hinges if yours are broken, because VW didn't change hinge design until
1975 ( ithink this is the yaer when the hinges changed design)

Thus i scavenged some hinges from a 73' and the look exactly the same as
the hinges on my 65'. FYI the part number is 261-829-551.

Now can anybody tell me if the back door from a 71' Westfalia will fit in a
65' Panel Van?
