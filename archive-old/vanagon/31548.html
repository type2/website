Nope. Technical Bulletin 24-92-02 lists it as 
Model(s): All Water Cooled Engine Vanagons

It deserves a lot of air time.  It's a known problem and newbies to the 
list should feel free to ask the question.
Has anyone put this harness on a 1983 1/2 to 1985 Vanagon?
Did it solve the problem?

Keywords: harness miss 
PN of harness: 025 906 302
Described as providing &quot;improved signal voltage stabilization&quot;.
