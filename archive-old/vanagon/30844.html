&gt;&gt;Hello,
&gt;&gt;	I have a '73 camper van with a window wash resivoir that won't 
&gt;&gt;hold any pressure for longer than one day.  I have heard of one solution 
&gt;&gt;that involved connecting the spare tire air valve to the resivoir.  I 
&gt;&gt;assumed the spare tire was on the front of the van as it is on mine.  Has 
&gt;&gt;anyone ever done this and if so, how was it done?

Well my solution was to install a electric washer.  The kit with the
resevoir, tubing, tee fitting, and motor is only around $10 to $12.  I see
the original air pressure unit as potentially unreliable, and when the snow
season comes here I need the windshield washer to get the dirt/road salt
off.  Now I'm also the type of VW fanatic who likes the &quot;stock look&quot;  so I
left the old resevoir in place and hung my electric resevior discreetly
behind the passenger seat (I have a 71 westy).  The resevoir is lashed
securely to the hook that holds the top of the seat in.  When I need to
refill I just pop the seat forward and snap it back in place.  The tubing is
routed under the rubber mat.

My apologies to those who just love the pressurized resevoirs.  

On a side note, I was on the highway two days ago casually looking for
comrades cruising their buses in the Connecticut cold, and I spotted a 68-71
pop top westy going in the opposite direction.  I was over in the slow lane
and so were they.  To my horror, half of their top was raised and straining
the passenger side hinge, waiting to pop up like a sail.  There was no way
to warn them and certainly no chance of turning around and catching up with
them.  Hope they discover that before it's too late.
