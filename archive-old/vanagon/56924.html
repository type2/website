Thanks for the info.
I have tried to test the ballast resister. When testing for continuity
with a ohm meter I got no current flow across it.  The only problem is I
don't know the proper way and what to look for when testing the
resister.

&gt; my 87 westy has suffered the same A/C symptoms of popping the releif valve on

&gt; circuit in the ballast resistor behind the driver side headlight.  When i
&gt; resoldered the obvious break in the ballast resistor,,,i now had a lower fan
&gt; speed to cool the engine.  i believe this lower fan setting goes on when the
&gt; ac goes on...and without it.,.the system overheats and pops the relief valve
&gt; on the receiver /dryer.  in addition...the lower fanfan speed is a first
&gt; degree of engine cooling,,,so the second fan speed(hhowling) dosnt ever have
&gt; to kick in.
