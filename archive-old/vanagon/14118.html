Subject: Re: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

&gt;&gt;&gt;About 7 years ago I attended the first SOTO meet down at Deer Park in San
&gt;&gt;&gt;Diego.  There were these 3 guys from Sacramento, everyone knew who they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;and knew that they were involved in stealing off of other's cars.  Soon
&gt;&gt;&gt;enough, parts that were being sold in their swap spot turned out to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;stolen parts. They were literally dragged and kicked out of the park.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sacramento still has that reputation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, I know _exactly_ who it is you are talking about!  I think
&gt;&gt;its the same guy that tried to take my bus, and took the one down the street.
&gt;&gt;Its actually a group of about 8 guys, with 2 guys as the &quot;ringleaders&quot;
&gt;&gt;and a bunch of others that grip parts for them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;......................................................................
&gt;This is the reason that I paid the extra $ to &quot;enter&quot; my nasty-looking '57
&gt;single cab in the VW Classic last summer. We were told to park right next to
&gt;the Charlie-mobile that took best TypeII (what a hoot). We felt like Uncle
&gt;Jed and Granny visits Models Inc.! VW T&amp;A reviewed the show and mentioned
&gt;that the vintage side of the show was nice except for occasional &quot;piles of
&gt;puke&quot;. Although the single is light years away from one of Charlie's
&gt;concourse projects, the single was also light years away from the parking
&gt;lot thieves.

Well Rusty,
I am glad you didn't have a bad experience visiting California.  So what, if
your Type II is a &quot;pile 'o puke&quot; I am sure we've all had our share of
&quot;beaters&quot;.  It stokes you to drive it right?  So who cares....if I see you
on the road I'll still give you a thumbs up!!
