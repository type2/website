Subject: Cool Stuff - Respondants

Thanks to all of you who responded to &quot;COOL STUFF&quot;.  For those of you who 
know how the government works, this week is the end of the fiscal year.  
This has caused the &quot;trinket&quot; company to be extremely busy trying to get 
orders out to the respective customers they have (mainly government 
contractors).  I will be updating a list of stuff and will forward it as 
soon as I can.  Thanks again for helping me decide if it's worthwhile 
bargin.  Later...

Paul Smiley
