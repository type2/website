So John Gladu says:
&gt; What are we supposed to do with drained coolant these days?  I imagine that
&gt; down-the-gutter is somehow harmful to the environment (or maybe just my
&gt; cat).
&gt; 

Well, the for the ecologically minded, you should call you local hazardous
waste branch of your county government and find out the best method.  You
can probably take it to a radiator shop.  Some car garages accept them
also.
