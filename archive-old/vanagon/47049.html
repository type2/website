In a message dated 96-07-19 04:22:32 EDT, you write:

&gt;Does anybody out there know if there were any Single-cab Syncros ever
&gt;produced for Canada?  Any of you Canadians ever see any single-cabs
&gt;for sale, or in wrecking yards?  Still toying with the idea of
&gt;converting a single-cab to syncro...

I have a canadian brochure (1990 I think) at home.  I recall the Syncro
option was available in all the body styles I think.  Converting a non-Syncro
to a Syncro would be an enormous task, I'd forget that route if I were you.

Good luck,
