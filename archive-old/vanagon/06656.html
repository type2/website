Subject: Midwest/Midlands Busathon

OK.  Three responses do not a groundswell make, but let's take
this a little further.  Y'all remember Da Trip?  The big loop 
around the US in your VW Bus/Vanagon/EV?  Might we work out the
east-meets-west loop somewhere in the Upper Midwest?  Incorporate
Da Trip's convergence with a midwest bus boo-haa?  

There are some fine parks available--how many people might we be
talking, and what is the proposed map of Da Trip?  I've asked for
information but not received anything yet.
