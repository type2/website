Subject: Need your opinion about this VW Westfaila '66

I found this nifty VW camper bus 1966 for measly 500 bucks but I am not 
sure if this price is reasonable for this condition. The body of the bus 
is great but the floor pan needs to restored a lot also the camper 
materials are not included such as bed, ref, sink, and more. So whata do 
you think? Oh yeah it include pop up tent...
