Subject: 36hp fan shroud w/doghouse?

Hi all,

Anyone out there know the cooling flow characteristics of the 36 hp fan
shroud vs. the newer squatter styles?  I am wondering if the shrouds
basically flow the same amount of air, or did VW improve the flow when they
changed the design?  Also, some of the aftermarket shrouds I have seen look
very cheaply made.  Any recommendations on aftermarket suppliers who make a
quality shroud? Do some of these suppliers have doghouse styles with the
36hp shape?

Bob
