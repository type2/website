Chris,

  I had this problem with Sorins Syncro when he was on his way through
town.

  The Yellow and Black wire from your ignition switch is the power feed
to the Headlight switch.  If there's a problem in the switch NO Power
will get to the headlights.  Do you have running but NO Headlights?
That was the case with Sorins.

  Let me know if I can help out in any other way?

  Kyle
