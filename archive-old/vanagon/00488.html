Subject: Vanagon purchase Advice

I'm not sure if I should feel thankful or cursed, but as a direct result of
this list, I'm seriously considering purchasing a late-model Vanagon.

I'd like to get a Westie, and I was thinking that the best plan was to get as
new of one as possible - in part due to my impression that the last few years
came with a 5-year 50K power train warranty.

I was wondering what to look for in:

1.) Finding a dealer or shop that will work on these animals.
2.) Common things to avoid in a used '90-91 Westie
3.) Will all my free time be taken up replacing water pumps and temperature
    sensors? (Will I be forced to take a second job to afford the dealer parts
    prices &lt;g&gt;)

Thanks for any advice you can pass on.
