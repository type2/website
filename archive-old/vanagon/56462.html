Subject: Re: Go with the door sticker..... 

There have been only two name brand tire companies that I have ever had 
consistent trouble with:

      * Continental
      * Uniroyal

Every set of Continental tires I have ever owned (come as original equipment 
VW/Audi) I have discarded with &lt;5K miles.

Hopefully Uniroyals are now better, with Michelin ownership.

By the way, if you ever come across Uniroyals built in Europe, they are 
actually Continentals.

&gt;The 48 PSI sticker on your Westy is for the original equipment
&gt;Continental Transporter tires with reinforced sidewalls.  Thank your
&gt;luck stars you no longer have them on your van.  They were by far the
&gt;worst handling tires I ever had, especially in the rain.
