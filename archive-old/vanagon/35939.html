Subject: Trouble with Type II rod bearings...


I'd be grateful for some help with this. I know there's some math to
follow, but I think I'm in trouble here. I suspicion I'm in over my head.

I'm ready to put the bottom end of the 1600 together with the rebuilt
crank and the new bearings. I really want to do this right, and I had
been going to plastiguage the new rod bearings for reassurance, but then
Bob Hoover said:

&gt;Plasitgage is like doing surgery with a butter knife.

&gt;...the old-fashioned 'drop test' provides all you need to know about the
&gt;fit of the big-end bearing.  (Torqued to spec, hold the rod level and
&gt;release it.  It should s-l-o-w-l-y drop to the vertical, taking
&gt;somewhere between two and three seconds.  No drop?  The bearing is too
&gt;tight.  Drops too fast?  It's too loose.  Find out why and fix it.

And he knows what he's talking about, so that's what I did--a
pre-assembly of the crank.

I measured everything with a micrometer to make sure everything was
consistent. New crank throws are all within .001 of each other, rods are
all within ~.001 (they're a little harder to measure). Everything's
great, so I assemble and torque, using the bearings FLAPS said to use.

And the &quot;drop test&quot; goes like this: &lt;flup&gt;

Looser than a five-dollar...So then I go to find out why. First I ask
FLAPS, who shrugs a lot and insists those are the right bearings because
the crank is .20 under, and those are the bearings for that, and they
never heard of no drop test anyway. The opinion of FLAPS is that if they
aren't bound up, they're right, so stop fussing.

Then I started measuring for size, rather than for comparison. This thing
is supposed to be .20 under. The measurements go like this:

Crank throws:        2.146
Rods (crankpin):     2.279
Bearings (.50 mm):    .065

Stock crank (per Haynes) was 2.164, so to begin with I have an extra
.018 of slop; the crank is over-ground. Stock crankpin was ~2.165, so
there's another .114, for total slop of .132. Subtracting from said
slop an oil film of .025, we come up with the Grand Total of Slop I
have to make up for somehow: .107

This is where I start to go nuts, because while they're loose, they fall
too fast--they don't have over a tenth of an inch play in them. No way.
They don't clunk back and forth, they just aren't tight enough.

The measurement problem looks to be in the crankpin diameter,  right?
Does anybody know what they *should* be? Until I can figure this out I
can't make them give me the right bearings because I don't know what to
ask for.

(This selfsame retailer sold me the shortblock I'm rebuilding. The one
that went maybe 5,000 miles before it banged a rod? Discovered a few days
ago that there was nothing where the oil pressure control valve was
supposed to be; it was simply hollow. Lovely.)

TIA,
