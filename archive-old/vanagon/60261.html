I contacted them in Florida &amp; they do not market the racks here in the
US.  They say to contact their Italian office at fiamma1_at_galactica.it

&gt;Hi everyone, just thought that I would mention there is a company here in
&gt;the UK that does some excellent bike racks especially designed for the VW,
&gt;the one for the Vanagon is great! The company is called Fiamma and they
&gt;have a good reputation over here in the UK, although I haven't yet bought
&gt;their bike rack.
&gt;
&gt;They also have an address in the the USA in Orlando, Florida where they
&gt;manufacture awnings. I don't know if they sell the bike racks over there
&gt;but it might be worth a call. If you go to
&gt;&lt;http://www.rvamerica_dot_com/fiamma/index.html&gt; you can find all the relevant
&gt;contact details.
&gt;
&gt;Usual disclosures apply.
&gt;
&gt;Regards, Ralph

&gt;&gt; &gt;I just have to mention that Paulchen racks are still available, and fit
&gt;&gt; &gt;beautifully onto the rear hatch.

&gt;&gt;      Wow.  Okay, I think that Ron wins the best bike rack award.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;      Now, where in the States can I get one?
