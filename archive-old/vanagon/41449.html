For those of you single men/women who are masochists, and those who are
partnered and are sado-masochists, I have jogged past a splittie in
someone's backyard that used to be hidden by a fence, blown down by winds
this winter, that looks like it would make a good lifelong project,
cancerous rust in intimate places...

It looks like a case of VW vagabonds getting housebound and responsible,
but loathe to let go of the past.  Well, not too responsible.  The fence
is still down...
