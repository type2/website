&gt; The instrument lights are funny, in a tragic sort of way.  The old style
&gt; lights had replacable bulbs in a flanged holder.  The bulbs are standard,
&gt; but not common.  The later style was an integral unit.   My '80 has the
&gt; old version.  These fit into the same spots as the later ones, and you can
&gt; get bulbs.  I don't know when they changed, and many early Vanagons have
&gt; had their old-style lights replaced with the $$$$$ new version, because
&gt; that's what the dealers carry.  Sadly, most of the holders were thrown out
&gt; with the bulbs.
&gt; 
&gt; I too have fashioned my own -- now I pull spares from any junkyard copy I see.
&gt; I have one full set of the old style.  Much nicer.  Thank you again VW for
&gt; your continuing goal of screwing up basically good designs.

Even the new &quot;holders&quot; (without the exchangable bulb) can be reused.
Buy some sylvania or equivalent #74 instrument light bulbs. Take
out the broken VDO bulb + holder. Snip off leads to bulb at bottom
of holder. Pull out old bulb. Take new bulb and bend the leads 90
degrees around the axis of the bulb so they are on the outside
of the lower part, and will make contact with the brass strip
in the now empry holder. Push in bulb. Check that it works.
(if not reiterate the lead bending step). If works secure bulb
with a bit of glue into holder. (I have dropped more than one bulb ;-)
