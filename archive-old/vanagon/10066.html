&gt;&gt;On Sat, 14 Jan 95, Pat (&quot;Got any 12V stickers, man?&quot;) Walsh

&gt;&gt; Wow!  What a score on that parts manual!  If you're taking requests, I'd
&gt;&gt; certainly appreciate a copy too.  It sounds chock full of the minutiae
&gt;&gt; detail-obsesive owner/restorers such as myself covet.  (&quot;Hi, my name is Pat
&gt;&gt; and I admit to laboriously peeling the interior stickers from Westys in
&gt;&gt; junkyards and to picking up used trim screws from junkers instead of using
&gt;&gt; &quot;newfangled&quot; unoriginal ones from the hardware store.&quot;)  I could give you a
&gt;&gt; copy of my '70 Westy manual (covers '71 too, I'm told), or volunteer to type
&gt;&gt; up a summary of the changes shown through the years as indicated in your
&gt;&gt; manual (for inclusion in the gopher).
&gt; Joe Clark respondeth:
&gt;I feel your pain, Pat.  Have you ever found yourself up to your neck in 
&gt;fire-ants, trying to remove a siezed do-dad from a rusting hulk in a 
&gt;tick-ridden junkyard, and said to yourself, &quot;God I LOVE these cars!!&quot;?
Nope, can't say I've encountered fire-ants but last year I was in the nether
reaches of a junkyard and the weeds and grass were so high I had to climb
onto the tops of cars a couple of times to get my bearings as I searched for
the front of the lot.  The most amusing yard, though, was one some friends
and I went to as teenagers.  The owner was apparently a farmer, as there were
(BIG) pigs roaming the place.  No sign to that effect, we were just startled
to round a corner and come face-to-snout with one.
