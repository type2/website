&gt;Can anyone tell me why my van idles so rough?  I've had the thing tuned several
&gt;times.  Each time it comes back fro the dealer, it seems to idle worse.  The
&gt;dealer say it's the way they run. I find that hard to believe. I've adjusted

yeah, right. that's what the dealers kept telling me on my 86. it never would
idle right. so when i got my 88 and it started doing the same thing, i tried
to fix it myself. i figured i could replace the damn parts as well as they
could (and without the labor charges).

so when i replaced the coolant temp sensor (the one for the computer), all of
the sudden, my idle got lots better. surprise! apparently, the sensor tells
the computer how cold/hot the coolant is and the computer 'chokes' the car
accordingly.

since you say you've had the O2 sensor replaced, i would guess that maybe
try the coolant temp sensor (about a $10-20 part, depending on which dealer
you buy from).  it's not a difficult replacement, but you WILL lose some
antifreeze, so have some of that lying around. and do NOT try to do it from
underneath the car: you'll get coolant in your hair and face. :)  it can be
done from atop, through the engine compartment.

now, there are TWO coolant temp sensors on the 2.1 liter Digifant engine.
the one on the left side is the one you want (the one on the front of the
thermostat is the one for the coolant temp guage ... this one also went
flakey on me one day and had to be replaced).

the part number for the coolant temp sensor for the computer is
025-906-041A. it has a BLUE plastic top. the older ones have a brass colored
bottom, but i just got a couple of new ones (marked 11-94) and they have a
silver colored bottom.

the point being that the other sensor has a BLACK top and silver bottom.
if your gauge messes up, get the black one. for the computer, get the blue
one.

you'll also need a new rubber o-ring. this makes it much much easier to pop
the old one out and pop the new one in. unless the o-ring stays in the hole
(about half the time). then you have to dig it out with your finger.

which brings up a point: do NOT do this until the car has sat cold overnight.
even after four hours, the coolant was still hot enough to be very
uncomfortable to me. :(

well, anyway. i'll quit now since nobody but the 86-91 want to hear this. :)
