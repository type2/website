Subject: Availablility of leaves for '68 beam


Is anyone aware of replacement leaves for a '68 beam?

Mine are fine right now but the grease in there was rust colored.
For all I know they used rust colored grease but it got me thinking.
'68 beams are mighty rare these days.  Are the leaves the same as those
required for '7X beams?  Can new ones be purchased?  

Thanks,
...Markus

ps: I've got a solid '66 beam thats taking up space
