I have a post-73 breadloaf (it has the large tail lites). It is
light blue with a white roof, and has an operating sliding door.

On the bottom it says &quot;Zylmex 362....Volkswagen Van&quot;. I seem
to recall buying it at Woolworth back in the late 70s...

As to the Lindberg Van, These were sold in the late 60s and
70s. Fairly decent detail for such a small plastic model.
