Subject: Re: starter problems

Hi Rick,

  I had a similar starter problem with my 85 Westy, but my problem 
was when it was cold. Sometimes when I worked late and was going 
home the engine would not start. Sometimes turning the key ON and 
OFF several times would start it, other times I push started the van.
  I finally had enough of that and took the starter apart to see what 
the problem was. I found that the lubrication on the starter solenoid 
was sticking. So when I turned the key, the solenoid did not pull all 
the way in and close the starter motor contacts. I wiped off the 
factory grease and gave it a new light coating of Moly grease and put 
it back together. I have not had the problem since. You might try 
this before replacing the starter and solenoid. It has been awhile 
now, but I think I removed the starter before I pulled the solenoid.
