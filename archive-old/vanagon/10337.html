Subject: Re: I Want a Westy Tent !

courtney:

my advice would be to buy a tent from a non-VW entusiast, you'll get it
cheaper :). It seems that once the enthusiasts get their hands on it the
price skyrockets!!! why not try an add in the local buy and sell, or those
papers that let you advertise for free. i've put in free ads and got lotsa
responses


&gt;I suppose this subject comes up all the time in this group, but here it is
&gt;again! I want a Westy tent!!!!! Needs to fit a 78 Westy. If anyone is
&gt;the owner of one of these and wants to sell it, PLEASE e-mail me. I
&gt;want to head out to the Alberta badlands this summer to check out the
&gt;dinosaurs etc.
&gt;Regards,
&gt;C.
