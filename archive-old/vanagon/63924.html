Subject: How to remove cabinet to do A/C repair

In a few days I will be replacing three A/C hoses on my 90 Multivan.

-long hose from compressor to condensor
-evaporator to A/C dryer
-evaporator to compressor

To get at the second two hoses it looks like I probably should remove first
remove the ceiling panel that houses the evaporator and second remove the
side cabinet.  My question is this: does any one know how many screws are
holding the ceiling in place?  Looks like there are four brass (or coated
to look like brass) screws that I think may be holding the assembly to the
ceiling.  Two screws are on the bottom and two are in the front of the
upper cabinet.  If I remove this ceiling does the evaporator drop with it
or is it some how attached to the ceiling?

After I remove the ceiling, I plan to remove the side cabinet.  This looks
much more straight forward and Bentley does a pretty good job of describing
removal of this cabinet.

I just would like some idea what I'm in for before I start pulling things
apart.

Any comments would be appreciated.
