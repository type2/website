&gt; 				WANTED
&gt; One German Engineer.  Name, unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; Crime:  Torture of young, VW owner.  This treacherous &quot;engineer&quot; is 
&gt; resonsible for constructing a spring-loaded clip to hold brakes in 
&gt; place.  This clip (a.k.a. the thumb smasher) is known to cause serious 
&gt; harm to those who try and change it without some damn specific tools.

Ummm... are you talking about the one on the front disc brakes?  That
one comes out real easy once you pull the two pins out... or is it some
other clip?
