Subject: Re: Rain Water Leaks in My 85

Yes, the water leak in your car is probably because the sheet metal on the
door doesn't press hard enough against the window and there is a little space
there. Any water that hits the window goes inside the door and drains into
your van. 

I am trying to fix this on my van but I haven't determined the best method of
doing so. The best option seems to be to remove the rubber seal around the
bottom of the window and then press the metal in towards the inside of the
van so it will be tighter against the window. I tried this but the metal is
like a big spring and just springs back into shape. 

Hummm....
