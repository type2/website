Subject: Starter Hookup Question

Well, I've got my engine in the bus...finally...but I'm nervous about 
firing it up until I'm sure of the starter connection. I looked at the 
wiring diagram in Bentley's but something doesn't look right.

I know I have a short in my system somewhere, but I suspect the ignition. 
I don't want to risk having wires crossed on the starter, though, before 
I fire it up (first fire after rebuild).

At any rate, the vehicle is a '71 bus. There's a hot wire running from 
the battery that hooks up on the outermost terminal. My question is does 
the red/white-striped wire go on the terminal with that wire or does it 
go on the other post? 

Thanks! Joe
