I checked out the 82 Diesel today. The tranny was stuck in 4th gear. The
shift linkage was totally worn out. Is this the trans problem? The
nosecone has been of at least once (lots of oozing sealant).Several
missing CV joint bolts. Almost all of the body panels dented. Rot around
one of the windows. Dryrotted tires. Enlarged hole for stereo. Lots of
custom wiring. Oh, I almost forgot, it wouldn't start. Fuel supply
non-existent (yes, I checked the fuses and other stuff). Fuel pump
wouldn't come on even though seller said it ran yesterday. What do you
expect for $800? If any one wants the number of this gem, I'll send it to
you. The van is located in Newport News, Va and it is very brown (light
brown/dark brown two tone). BTW I'm still looking for a Diesel Vanagon of
any type preferably located near Virginia.
