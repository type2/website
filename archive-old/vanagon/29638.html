What's the symptom when your ICVSU is &quot;stuck&quot;?  My '89 Syncro has
&quot;hunting&quot; idle and uneven acceleration overall and I'm trying to get a
handle on what might be causing it.  The ICVSU vibrates like no
tomorrow, but is this a guarantee it's working? (I don't have all the
tools or the wherewithall that Bentley requires to diagnose this the
*real* way.)

&gt; BAD
