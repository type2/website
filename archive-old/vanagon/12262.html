Subject: Re: What about Custom Handbook by Meredith?

&gt;I have heard all kinds of great stuff about Muir's manual and I've been
&gt;searching high and low for a copy.  I was resigned to special order, when
&gt;I managed to stumble on a 25th anniversary edition copy in the only
&gt;bookstore in town that carries Volksworld magazine from the UK.  I have
&gt;ordered the VW Bus Custom Handbook by Lawrence Meredith as well.  Any
&gt;negative comments?  I can cancel my order up until Friday...  Please
&gt;advise fellow 'Brick' drivers. 

Most of content is about split screen vans (as usual), and only a small 
amount on Bay windows and Vanagons. There is a fairly comprehensive history 
and an interesting chapter all about camper conversions. It is interesting 
to read a book devoted to buses for a change but some of the info is wrong 
and most of the other stuff (engine tuning, etc) is nothing new.

&gt;
&gt;P.S. I've heard a lot about the Nov. 1994 Volksworld Vanagon special 
&gt;issue.  Is it worth the money to order a back issue?  We're talkin better 
&gt;part of $10...at least. Ulp!

I'll check at home, but I don't remember any Vanagon special. Volksworld are 
strictly air-cooled only, and even then features about Bays and Vanagons are 
few and far between.
