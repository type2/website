Subject: Porsche 5speed into breadloaf

So I said to myself, &quot;People are conducting threads about enemas, and I'm
shy about sending this article?&quot;
NOVEMBER 1975
 
The VW Bus, with all its many virtues, has one major fault. 
It's always in the wrong gear, whether it's the &quot;stump puller&quot;
low, &quot;roaring&quot; down the freeway at &quot;slightly&quot; over 55 or having
to use third gear and 50 mph to get up a &quot;normal&quot; freeway grade.
The solution is simple: a five-speed gearbox - but how?
 
A few issues ago one of our readers was complaining about the
inadequacies of his Bus as a trailer tower. We weren't able to
offer him much help, but a few days later Jack Zandergen, owner
of Los Alamitos Motors (3570 E. Cerritos, Dept. HVW, Los
Alamitos, Calif.) called and said that his resident VW expert
Lyle Althouse (if that name sounds familiar, it should - he was
the &quot;wrench&quot; on the Treuhaft Trans-Am Beetle) used his Bus with
its Porsche five-speed to tow a ski boat on their periodic
weekend trips to &quot;the river.&quot; For all you Easterners, &quot;the
river&quot; is the Colorado and it's a 250-mile jaunt from L.A. that
involves going from sea level, up through the mountain pass and
out across the desert.
 
Unlike many of the &quot;great, new&quot; (but unproven) ideas that appear
in magazines, this installation has been operating for two years
and 50,000 miles and we left most of the dirt on for the photos,
just wiping off the special pieces for clarity.
 
If you live in, San Francisco, Pittsburgh or some other
&quot;Hillsburg&quot; where you &quot;need&quot; the VW low gear, forget the whole
program, because as you can see from the chart the new low will
be between the existing first and second. It's not as drastic as
the chart makes it look and if you can make level ground starts
in second gear with a little concentration you should have no
trouble. Lyle has no problems - even on the boat launch ramps.
If you're still interested, the whole program is unbelievably
easy (except paying for the Porsche gearbox) and this is how
it's done.
 
Remove the engine, transaxle, halfshafts, and the entire shift
linkage. Remove the inner CV joints and replace with sedan units
(113 501331). They have the same bolt pattern as the Porsche
stub axles. Porsche CV joints have a different spline and will
not fit the shafts. The 113 joints are not as thick as the Type
II units. This difference is made up by installing two more
concave washers (113 501 327) &quot;facing&quot; each other, then
installing the CV joint and snap ring, using normal assembly
procedures. Reinstall halfshafts into Bus.
 
Mating the VW engine and Porsche gearbox is the next step.
First, make sure your engine is fitted with a diaphragm type
clutch cover and that your disc is in good condition. Make sure
the Porsche release bearing is in good condition. A Porsche or
VW Automatic starter must be used. Neither will engage fully so
the bendix and ring gear must be in good condition. If you have
access to a mill, machine approximately 1/8-in. off the starter
to transaxle mounting surface. Lyle's installation has been
&quot;partially engaging&quot; since it was first installed and has never
given a problem.
 
The lower engine studs should be replaced with longer ones from
an automatic case or be &quot;backed out&quot; and Loc-Tited to allow for
the thicker Porsche housing (or machine the bosses on the
Porsche transaxle). Attach the original VW clutch cable bracket
to the transaxle with the top bolt. as shown and file a notch in
the bottom part so it pushes against the lower nut (see photo).
The stock clutch cable and flex tube are used without
modification.
 
The 902/ (number is stamped on case) transaxle has the same
flange-to-flange width as the VW, and must be used. The unit can
come from either a 911 or 912 but the stiff (round biscuit) 911
front mount must be used. The soft (square biscuit) 912 mount
will not work. Fabricate the pair of brackets per the
illustration, put the bolts, 12mm (or 7/16) by 3 in., into the
brackets first, then install the brackets to the existing
control arm bolts. Remove control arm bolt with no tension on
the suspension.
 
At this point you are ready to reinstall the engine and
transaxle assembly. Due to the fact that the Porsche transaxle
mounts slightly higher, make sure there is no interference
between the throttle cable and the front body cut out. If there
is a problem, it can be remedied with a &quot;ball peen adjuster.&quot;
Make sure there is clearance between the nose of the transaxle
and the torsion bar housing.
 
With the big stuff in place, all that remains is the shift
linkage. Round up a couple of old hockey sticks (shift rods) and
cut off so you have a straight rod with genuine set screw hole.
The front shift shaft has an &quot;S&quot; bend in it. Straighten out the
&quot;rear&quot; curve with a torch. Cut the rear shift shaft at the front
end so that with 1/2 in. of one of the cut-off shift rods
inserted into it, the dimension from set screw hole to pivot
hole is 60 in. Align holes at approximately 90 degrees.
Reinstall &quot;'cut off&quot; piece of the rear shift shaft back into the
front shift shaft in its original. manner. Insert the other
shift rod into its open end. DO NOT weld - this will be your
final adjustment. Install the rear (now front) shift universal
onto the shift rod.
 
Because the Porsche shift rod exits so much lower than the VW a
new shift shaft housing is fabricated from 1-in. electrical
conduit, which should be cut to 55 1/4 in. The bushings are part
of the shift shaft and fit the conduit without modification. The
original dust boot will also fit, but must be fastened into
position. The housing is attached to the VW frame at each end
with conduit clamps and sheet metal screws. An &quot;old style&quot; (111
711 175B) coupling is used to connect the rear of the new rear
shift shaft to the Porsche shift rod.
 
Alignment of the shift rod and the shift shaft (which should be
as straight as possible) can be done by shimming the trans
mounts or shift housing with washers as required. The shift
shaft should rest on the bottom of the housing to allow for the
natural rising under acceleration. After everything seems to be
aligned properly, clamp the front slip joint with vise grips and
see if all gears are attainable and located to your
satisfaction. If so, weld thejoint.
 
Lyle has found his gas mileage is now 23-25 instead of the 19-20
he originally got with the four-speed. His Bus (camper), which
has a stock engine, will pull 4500 rpm in both fourth and fifth
gears, and that figures out to 85 in fifth. The reduced engine
noise is a real blessing and being able to shift down twice and
still be above the legal speed limit is a feeling that must be
experienced to be appreciated.
 
Top, &quot;stiff,&quot; 911 porsche mount with round biscuits must be
used.  912 Porsche type is too flexible. Bottom, conduit is
clamped to frame and original dust cover is &quot;tie-wrapped&quot; into
place. 
 
Top and center, mounts can be fabricated from steel angle
according to diagram and must be clearanced for torsion bar
housing. Bottom, a stock VW clutch bracket is used and a notch
is filed in it to support the bracket against the lower nut.
