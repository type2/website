Subject: VW-1600 DUAL PORT-MANIFOLD BOOT LEAKS
Date: Tue, 23 May 95 15:03:03 PDT
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

I've got a problem that may be totally my fault (wouldn't be the first
time...).  My '71 Bus' 1600 dual port developed a leak in the right
manifold boot about a year ago and I decided to replace it.  I went and
bought a standard manifold gasket and boot set and by yanking the
generator out and performing all sorts of intricate contortions, I was
able to replace both the manifold-head seals and the boots themselves
without pulling the engine.  About five months later, one of the boots
broke again and I assumed that it was due to my having torqued the clamp
down so tight it ripped into the thin material.  I went to the parts store
and the PFTKIABTC (pimply faced teenaged know-it-all behind the counter)
told me that I shouldn't have been so cheap and instead have invested in a
set of those wildly colored silicone boots since they last a lot longer.
Why anyone would want to put canary yellow, flaming red, or international
distress orange parts into an area as filthy, greasy, and disgusting as my
engine compartment is totally beyond me.  As I was not about to go through
the hassle of removing the manifold in vitro again, I opted instead for
the split type of boot.  I was a bit suspicious of getting a tight seal
with the split type but they seemed to work OK.  However, after a couple
of weeks of driving I began to get vaccum leak symptoms (hesitation in
acceleration, gurgling backfire-like sounds, rpm increase when starting
fluid is sprayed on the boot, etc.).  These symptoms ceased when I
tightened down the clamps; however, after a while the same cycle would
repeat as the clamps would loosen over time.  Eventually, I again wound up
chewing through these split boots, an interesting occurence since they are
about 1/2 inch thick (the underside of the clamp digs into the rubber).
It finally happened again this morning and again I dutifully replaced the
split boot.

So what do I do?  Must I put on the silicone boots?  Can I instead wrap
the whole joint with some of that 200mph duct tape?  Seal it up with some
sort of high-temp goop?  While I plan not to crank the clamps down too
much, I still need to keep them tight or they won't seal correctly.  This
whole thing is getting real old, real quick.

Thanks for any suggestions (other than switching to a single port 1600),

Nick
