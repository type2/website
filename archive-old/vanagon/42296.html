Subject: manassas bugout &amp; thanks

Hey all,
First, thanks to everyone who has answered my questions.  Very helpful!  I'll
try to do those valve cover gaskets before the bugout.

Speaking of the bugout,
I need info!  I would like to know who's going, what camping plans are, how to
get where we're going, etc....  I'm in Tennessee but I'm thinking seriously
about attending so I need to know this stuff before I take off.

Anyone who's got information, please give it to me :)

Thanks,
Sean
