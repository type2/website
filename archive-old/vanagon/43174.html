Subject: Re: Rust remover/preventative recommendations?

Hi Jack,

Of all the rust &quot;preventaive&quot; gizmo's i have used i have found the POR 15
to be the best stuff out there

it's original pupose was to be used as an anti-fouling paint for the bottom
of boats that sat in salt water all day. if it can stand up to salt water i
figger it will do a good job on my bus

POR (paint over rust) is NASTY!!!! It contains incocynates (sp?) which by
their name implies that they have carcenogenic properties. As such you
should get some PROPER breathing apparatus and paint in a WELL
ventilllated area. Once it dries the paint STICKS i.e. if it dries on your
skin it will be there for a few days until your skin rubs off so make sure
to wear rubber kitchen gloves or something like that

now that i have cautioned you re: its toxicity and strenght i will list its
attributes

right on the paint can it tells you to paint POR 15 right onto the rusty
surface. there should be nothng between the rust and the POR 15. POR 15 is
very good at sticking to the rust so it should be painted right on. Aside
from scapring off the loose surface rust and ensuring that there is no
gease oil or whatever else might prevent the pain ftom adhering the POR 15
will STICK!!!

basically all i do before painting is

1. scrape off loose surface rust with so that there is no loose surface rust
2. degrease area to be painted with either mineral spirits, varsol or
lacquer thinner (lacquer thinner is not generally available commercially i
get it through my &quot;contacts&quot;)
3. upon the lacquer thinner or whatever dries i begin to paint the POR 15
tight to the paint. it is best applied in _thin_ coats rather than one
thick coat.

Once the paint dries it will have a almost cermaic appearance to it. You
can then top coat the POR 15 with your choice of paint, or you can put a
layer of filler to smooth out the surface and then paint overthe POR 15
witht he paint of your choice

the most important thing is to paint the POR 15 _right on the rust_ (after
descaling and removing greasy oily stuff)

A few other notes, POR 15 doesn't stand up well to UV light so if you are
gonna be painting on an area that is exposed to the light make sure to top
coat it w/ a paint that has uv resistance.

POR 15 is also not the cheapest pain on the market and you will prolly pay
$15.00 for a _very_ small can of it (dunno if prices are better i the usa).
POR 15 doesn't seem to have a large distribution network up here, I buy
mine froma marine products company.

I highly recommend the product as long as you follow the precautions that I
alluded d to above (especially the points about proper breathing gear and
ventialltion and not letting the pain dry on your skin) i think you will be
happy with the results.

the paint should be allowed to dry for 24 hours before applying again.

lemme know if you need any further input, good luck

michael
