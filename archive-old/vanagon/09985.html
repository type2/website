My sink pump has been showing the following symptons:
It will delay starting, it often needed a push on the bottom to get
running and it sounded pretty rough and labored after running a short
while.  Instead of buying a new pump from JC Whitney, I decided to
try to fix the thing.  
After I got the thing out, I was able to dismantel it by sliding a
knife along the cracks on the top and the bottom.  After I got the top
off, I saw the problem:  water had gotten into the pump.  It looked
pretty nasty, but I disasembled the pump and soaked it in isopropyl
alcohol for a while which seemed to clean it pretty well.  I then put
the thing back together and put silicon sealant in the top (but not near
the motor).  I resealed the plastic body parts with testors plastic
cement and finally I took a soldering iron and melted the plastic along
the top to be sure of getting a seal.
Anyway, the thing seems to work pretty well not but if it goes out again,
I'll get it from JC Whitney.

On an unrelated thread, earlier someone mentioned that clay flower pots
were used to heat with over top of the stove.  I have tried this.  I can
say: do not plan on removing the grill from your stove and inverting them
on the stove top with proper amounts of ventilation, etc.  Do not plan on
using an electric fan to try to get enough air in so that it will burn
properly.  These pots can present a hazard when used in this manner.
Propane can collect under the pots after the flame goes out.  The stove,
however, will continue to produce propane.  The result:  something might 
explode.  On the face of it, using pots seems like progress towards a
heat solution, but in reality, it is extremely dangerous I believe.  I
would hate to hear about clay pot bits being imbedded in someone's face
when (I will use when, not if here) they explode.

The only way I think clay pots can be used is by leaving the stove grill
on and inverting the pots.  I also think the stove should only be run long
enough to get the pots hot.
I know this sounds strange, but I was thinking venting the exhaust and 
supplying outside air to a modified clay pot system.  It's not as simple
as it sounds.
