The Craven
by Edgar Allen Whatzisface

Once upon a midnight frozen,
As I drove the route I'd chosen,
Sitting at the wheel until my butt was sore,
Suddenly, there came a tapping,
Tapping, as if someone rapping,
Rapping gently at my sliding door.

&quot;'Tis the wind,&quot; said I to me,
&quot;'Tis the wind, and nothing more.&quot;

Onward through the night I traveled
As my confidence unraveled,
Thinking of the noise, the ill it bode.
Was it just a Sstone in hubcap?
Perhaps an unrefastened gas cap?
Or something worse to break and leave me stranded on the road?

&quot;'Tis the wind,&quot; said I to me,
&quot;'Tis the wind, and nothing more.&quot;

In the headlights, snow was falling,
Still that tapping noise was calling,
Calling all my senses back from whence it came.
Perhaps a cv-joint needs greasing,
And newer boots would make it pleasing.
Yes, that's the ticket! Now that's the one to blame.

&quot;'Tis the joints,&quot; I sagely muttered,
&quot;'Tis the joints, and nothing more.&quot;

And then, as if it heard my speaking,
The noise was silent ... my ears still seeking
Could find no trace of what I'd heard before.
On I drove, in silent waiting,
Waiting for the noise, restating
In my mind the causes I had thought ... and more.

&quot;'Tis my mind,&quot; said I to me,
&quot;'Tis my mind, and nothing more.&quot;

Throughout the trip, no noise resounded.
But always now my thoughts are grounded
In the causes of that noise I heard before.
Like a shadow cast by sunlight,
My wraith-like fears will follow; and might
I, from out that shadow, e'er be lifted?
    ... Nevermore.
