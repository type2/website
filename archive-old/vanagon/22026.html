Subject: Re:  T-Shirt

&gt;
&gt;Howdy,
&gt;If I had a scanner, I would happily send you the shirt design.
&gt;Anyway, you could probably make a picture yourself, just using
&gt;front-view shots, as that's all that will be on the shirt. It would be
&gt;cool if everyone got a picture of their own bus on a shirt or something
&gt;like that....
&gt;Richard
&gt;
&gt;
These same shops offer scanning services dirt cheap.
I like the 'their own bus' idea...   Hmm...
