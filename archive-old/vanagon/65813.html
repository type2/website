Todd,&amp; Ed:

My 86 westy does not have a cat converter on it, it was removed by DPO.
when they did the change over they did not allow for an O2 sensor. of
course I found out all this after I bought the van 1.5 years ago, I had to
add an O2 to get the van to run right, was using too much gas with out!

I don't know where the exhaust system was from but the front and rear pipes
go to a &quot;Y&quot; pipe which joins up with a curved extension pipe that goes into
the muffler(non stock), tail pipe comes out at proper place. We don't have
to have vehicles smogged her in Alberta so it has not been a compelling
factor to change back.

The O2 sensor that I added, well I just picked a spot where I thought the
cat converter would have been and drilled a hole, screwed the O2 sensor in
and has been ok for months.

I have noticed that the top of the O2 sensor will allow water to get in and
then the van stops running, no power, but will start up right away, run
till the sensor finds out it's wet and die again.

so right now I have the top of the sensor covered with special
stuff(Taped), am in the process of getting a new O2 sensor.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Questions, anyone, would my 86 westy operate ok without the cat
&gt; &gt;converter?  No emmissons test here. The exhust tips would come closer to
&gt; &gt;the center for me if that were the case. Would the tips clear the tow
&gt; &gt;hook bumper hitch?

&gt;
&gt; I thought that the Fuel Injection system uses the O2 sensor attached to
the
&gt; CAT to make mixture adjustments. Removing the cat may be a problem?
&gt;
&gt; Probably the best solution would be to simply knock the insides out of
the
&gt; cat and keep it in the system. (See the John Muir manual for the rabbit
&gt; under &quot;gutting the cat&quot;) Be careful as there may be dangerous (i.e.
&gt; carsenergenous) stuff in cat guts. If you took the cat out you would have
&gt; to make a custom bracket to support the muffler.
