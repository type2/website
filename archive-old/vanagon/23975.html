&gt; So 'fess up, Larry &amp; Alice, you folks were illicitly transporting PORK

&gt; 
&gt; So much for our Friday (ghost) storytelling....now, back to our regular
&gt; mayhem.
&gt; 
&gt; (*) It is said that one must NOT have pork in one's possession while on
&gt; Saddle Rd.
&gt; Man, what IS it about pork??....

Ok, I've got to confess. Alice and I _usually_ avoid red meat but we were 
staying with friends and they served barbecued pork ribs no less, and Forgive me
Father for I have sinned. Alice remained steadfast, so maybe that's why we lived
to tell the tale but since I was driving, perhaps the illicit PORK in my 
gastrointestinal tract was detected by Madam Pele. We committed the further 
offence of taking lava rock back on the plane, and when going through the 
agricultural check, the woman at the counter says &quot;My God, you takin' lava rock!
Are you crazy man?&quot; Apparently people often experience bad luck after taking 
Pele's children, the lava rocks. The local post offices, I'm told, receive 
hundreds of packages each year with lava rocks sent back by people whose luck 
turns bad. Now lets see, has anything bad happened lately? (1) Our catsitter 
told us that a stray cat broke into our house while we were in Hawaii and gave 
our cats fleas and also shit in our bathtub before being evicted. (2) A 
eucalyptus tree branch fell and destroyed the front windshield of our car 
shortly after we returned. (3) My kids both failed eye exams and need glasses. 
(4) Alice's dad fell ill with a mysterious ailment. (4) My son has decided to 
start playing the violin (No, anything but that!) (5) The van fails to start 
only when we are camping. (6) The summer is ending. (7) I got called a dork! 
Man, this is powerful stuff. I laughed when I watched the Brady Bunch, but now 
I'm getting nervous. Good thing I'm not superstitious.
