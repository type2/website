Subject: Re: What kind of bus do I have? or Joel, change the stats!


&gt;Hmmmm.  My air vent tag says Typ 23-42 and my behind-the-seat-plate has a
&gt;model of 2312.  Does this mean that my bus was built as a Wanna-be-Westy???

sounds like it


&gt;The PO says it was a camper but the sink and other goodies were yanked out
&gt;along the way.

as far as i know split window westfalia's never came with a sink only a
water tank and a water cooler

  It does have jalousie windows, cabinets, table,
&gt;fold-down-into-a-bed rear seat---hey, wait a minute! I thought all Westy
&gt;campers had pop-tops.

nope, pop tops were an option way back then!

 Apparently not!  Joel, change the stats!
&gt;
&gt;Ok, anybody have a sink/stove/fridge

actually you are looking for a coldbox not a fridge!
