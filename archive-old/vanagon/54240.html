&gt;That is where my new thermostat sits as well... Scared the hell out of me
that
&gt;I had put it in upside down or something on my test drive because my temp
&gt;gauge used to sit right above the white block marker and if I turned on
&gt;the heater when it was cold out, I could make the needle plumet down into
that
&gt;white block. It was nice to have heat in the mountains with the new
thermostat.

That's where mine stays also. I have, on a long trip in the summer, after a
long highway run, while stopping to pee, got the radiator fan to turn on.
But I had to sit in the van and rev it up a bit because if I didn't it
wasn't gonna go up on the gauge.
