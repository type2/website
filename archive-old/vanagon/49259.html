Subject: unusual EV sighting

A friend tells me he saw an EV Westfalia Synchro in downtown Seattle
yesterday, loaded up with people and camping gear so he couldn't see
inside.
Before you get all excited, note that it also had European plates on it.
Perhaps some German tourists brought their own vehicle instead of renting a
camper.
But it does mean they make them, and there must be *some* way to get them
into this country...
