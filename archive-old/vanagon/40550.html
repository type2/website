&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;A flit-gun is the thing you put bug spray in, sort of like a tire pump laying
&gt;on its side with a tomato can attached sideways on one end to hold the bug
&gt;spray, the brand-name of which was 'Flit'.  You pump the handle, the spray
&gt;comes out the nozzle.  Being wedded to spray-cans and destroying the ozone
&gt;layer, Ami-Ricans are probably not familiar with them any more but they are
&gt;still used around the world.  And available at hardware and garden supply
&gt;stores.

  The one I have now is also charged with the air compressor after
 you fill it and has adjustable spray nozzle from fine mist to solid
 stream. Got it at my local machinist supply house.
