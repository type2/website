 Hi,
 
 Does anyone know how much a used air flow meter for an 83 wasserwesty goes
 for? I just took my camper in to get it ajusted and inspected and they told
 me that they tried everything but it wouldn't pass (NJ). They said they
 narrowed the problem down to the air flow meter. The price they gave me for
 a new one is $320. Does this sound right? I would prefer to get used one
 because I can't afford a new one. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

What are the readings?  I doubt it is the air flow meter.  If the CO is high,
then the O2 sensor is not working or the engine is not set up properly.  If
the timing is advanced at all beyond spec, it will cause high CO and HC
readings.  If the O2 sensor is working properly, it will overide the airflow
meter.  If the CO is good and the HC is high, then you have an ignition miss,
bad Cat, Vacuum leak, engine problem,  etc.  Follow the Bentley manual set up
procedures exactly and see what happens before buying any parts.  The O2
sensor circuit can be checked with a voltmeter.  It should flucuate between
.2 and .8 volts.    I hope this helps.  

Dennis.
