&gt;I don't really want to drive my bus 370 miles each way.  And I'm not sure 
&gt;if I'll really be free that weekend, but I mostly am.  But is there any 
&gt;one that would want to give me, my beer, and a load of firewood a ride?  
&gt;I don't even have to bring food... just beer, and I can scrape a prune 
&gt;out of my pocket, I'm sure.
&gt;
&gt;Logistically, a pickup would be best for the wood, and Thom is planning 
&gt;on going....  :)

I am still vacillating.  My chief concern is mechanical - the 475+/- miles
each way would be one helluva shakedown cruise!

Thats a long way from home to find out you need to replace ________ on
your 40 year old bus!

Ideally, I'd have to take oil and tools, so I could do a VA before I came 
back!

I'll see how it goes with my local jaunts, and maybe I'll take it to the 
beach once or twice to see how it goes.  I also do not yet have the mattress
for the back part of the bed...
