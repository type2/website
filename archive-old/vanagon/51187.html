Subject: Re: Joel's Friday Stats...

&gt; :How do you get that info?  I have never seen anyone sending it
&gt; :to you?  When people subscribe to the list, does their
&gt; :geographic location somehow get stored as well?
&gt; :
&gt; :Don't tell me you just make it up??
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a trick question?
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would be great if you just made it all up Joel. Sort of
&gt; like the way the government operates.
&gt; 
Except the government sends a bill afterwards...
