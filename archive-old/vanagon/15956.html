&gt; While we are at the topic of gauges, has anyone installed a oil pressure 
&gt; gauge with the 1/8&quot; plastic hose type sender?  I was wondering if it is 
&gt; worth doing, with the long run.  

I haven't tried it, but my book says don't do it, unless you mount the
gauge very close to the engine.  The book said that with an installation
at the front of the car the gauge was still showing 40 psi while the oil
warning light had already come on at a stoplight.  I guess they had a
dual system installed on the car (?).  Anyway, I wouldn't try it.
