  This is a common occurance since the blinker interval is dependant on 
the resistance of the bulb and a capacitor it makes it go a lot faster when 
the resistance goes to infinity (actualy I believe there is a paralleling 
resistor) and beyond.  This is a design feature.  It let's you know quite 
handily that there is no blinking going on.  I have another problem that 
has vexed me for a while now though.  My blinkers inside cease blinking 
after a short period.  The exterior blinker continues to blink.  If i 
pull out the emergency blinker switch then turn it off again the interior 
lights blink for a short period then quit again.
