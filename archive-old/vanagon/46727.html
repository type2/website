Subject: Re: Help: '89 Vanagon Stutters and Dies after Starting when Cold
Date: Mon, 15 Jul 1996 11:26:12 -0400 (EDT)

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; My '89 Vanagon cannot seem to find the right idle speed when the engine is
&gt; cold.  This is especially true when the A/C is on.  The idle speed varies
&gt; from 500 - 1200 while the brain is trying to find the proper settings and
&gt; the engine tends to stutter or stall on acceleration.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem disappears as soon as the engine warms up.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues?

You may have a defective cold-start valve. 
Check your vw manual. There is a procedure on testing this component.
This is a Bosch component and may be obtained from your local autoparts
outlet.
