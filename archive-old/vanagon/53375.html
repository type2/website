&quot;I hate to bring this up yet again, but I have yet to find ANY
coolant around here (Victoria, BC) which states that it IS phosphate
free, aside from the VW stuff, which is made by BASF in Canada. I
can't find the long life Prestone stuff, and Canadian Tire long life
doesn't say anything about phosphates. Same story with Zerex. So, is
the VW stuff the best choice? I don't mind paying $17 /gal. for VW
if it is the best, but at the moment, it appears to be the ONLY
choice for phosphate free AF. (My thinking is that a &quot;long life&quot; AND 
phosphate free AF would be better, but I can't find one!) Should I 
just stick with VW?&quot;


I've seen two phosphorus free coolants at a local Walmart in Southlake, TX. One 
was a Prestone brand and the other I can't remember, seemed like it was a 
generic Walmart brand.  I was quite surprised.  Cost was $7-8 USD.
