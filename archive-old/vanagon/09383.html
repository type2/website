Subject: Re: West Pretour Breakfast

I'm now bringing some Peet's coffee, too.  Anyone want to throw in
some Irish Whiskey?  I'll bring whipping cream.  

Also, I'll make hot, mulled redwine, will bring spices, sweetening, etc.,
but I can't carry enough redwine for all you turkeys in only one vanagaon!
