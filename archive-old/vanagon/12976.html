&gt;&gt; I have a 1973 Campmobile.  Did they have a special supplement for the 
&gt;&gt; camping equipment?  There are little brackets that I can't figure out what 
&gt;&gt; to do with!!!
&gt;
&gt;Why don't you describe where the brackets are and what they look like. Maybe
&gt;we can figure it out on the list.  Hey!  Make it a contest.  Winner gets to
&gt;use Martha's shower for 2 hours!  ;)

With Martha!!!
