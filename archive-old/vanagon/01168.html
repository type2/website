Subject: camper stuff.

&gt;	The interior includes the water tank, closet, folddown bed, and the
&gt;cool little sink, stove, fridge combo.  Again, this is pretty mint, with some
&gt;minor contact paper delamination.  I also have most of the wiring, and the
&gt;propane tank for the stove/fridge.

My main question is - Do you deliver?  My stark naked panel could use some 
creature comforts. Do you have all those bits that protrude through the 
sidewall of the van? vents, filler caps H2O etc. How many holes would I have 
to cut. What about floor drain? etc.etc Just how far is it from Iowa to 
Maine anyhow? Whens the last time you had a long vacation, hmmm? or UPS 
maybe?? Email me your rough price whatever, so I can puzzle it over. What 
about the pop-top?   tjs
