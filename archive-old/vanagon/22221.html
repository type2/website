Subject: 6-cylinder Vanagon kit

Recent shopping expedition leaves me with most of the pieces you need to
put a six in your Vanagon.  Available as a package for $2000:
2.2liter 911T engine, 1971, 4000 mi. on new valves
oil tank
adapter flywheel to put engine in Vanagon
CD ignition
plans for rear engine brace

Price is FOB North Jersey, but if you are within 200 miles or so let's
talk.  Engine needs heater boxes, but comes with headers and muffler so
you can install and run it as is.  30-day guarantee at the $2000 price.
Email me direct for more detail.
B.
