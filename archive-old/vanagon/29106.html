Subject:       83 Waterboxer for sale

Dear All,

I have an 83 4 sp. waterboxer for sale.  $3,800.00.  New paint job - 
original VW colors.  Brown and Tan Color.  Van was completely 
stripped, sanded, primed, and repainted.  We  removed everything but 
door handles and windows for the painting.  Van has matching brown 
pinstripes along the tan paint lines.

Immaculate interior - all original.  Has new brakes, muffler.
Clutch, pressure plate, throwout bearing and seals replaced about 20k 
ago.

I've owned van since new and have kept up the maintenance on it.  
Only work done on van was by VW dealers or by self.  
Van never wrecked.

Van is in Starkville, Mississippi.  Work telephone number is (601) 
325-1908.  Home (601) 324-1739.

Butch Stokes
