Subject: How do you FEEL about tires?

Now that there's an inch or two of ice on the local(Montana) roads I'm
shopping for tires. Yokohamas or Radial T/A. I drive an 87 Synchro. i
Have read so much data about the Yokos, etc, What I really want to know
is why people like the tires they've got. Thanks...... Rob
