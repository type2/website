Subject: &lt;gasp!&gt; '75 bus shift selector cable needed


wait, now.  

before i get kicked off the list, i posted to the OTHER 
list last week and received no responses.  and i KNOW some of you 
have parts busses behind the garage and aren't on that list so i'm 
using this as a last resort.

i owe a friend a favor and am looking for the shift selector cable 
from a '75 Bus with the automatic tranny.  it would make a great 
'thank you' for him.
