Subject: Soldered connections in cars (was: Engine pulling nightmare)


&gt;&gt; I piddled around Sunday, replacing broken studs and soldering hokey 
wiring.

&gt;Am I the only one who thinks soldering wires in a vehicle is a bad idea?


Could be. I have been soldering wires in cars for 20 years; I've
never had one fail yet. OTOH, I've cleaned up countless messes
that were horribly failure-prone-- soldering VASTLY improved the
situation.

In my experience, mechanical-only connections (crimped, twisted,
fast-on, etc.) are vulnerable to loosening, oxidation, corrosion,
especially in the harsh environment of an automobile. I have
always believed that the only reason mor connections aren't
soldered by the factory, is that it takes a little skill and
a little more time-- both in scarce supply on some turnover-prone
assembly lines.

Clean the rosin off your connection after you solder it, and
secure it to something solid to prevent vibrtion, and you'll
live happily ever after.
