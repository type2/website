&gt; 2) My fridge.  Me and fridges don't get along.  I had it serviced by an RV
&gt; outfit.  They got it going on 110V and propane, and said everything was okay.
&gt; You bet, on Thursday I got it going on 110V and things were nice and cold in
&gt; the morning.  Before we left I got it going on propane.  Took a some doing
&gt; which was a little disconcerting.  I had been told not to run it on 12V while
&gt; riding because it still draws a lot of current.  &quot;Turn on the propane and
&gt; forget about it until you get home&quot; was the advise I got from more than one
&gt; person.  When I got set up at camp fridge wasn't on.  I wasn't out of propane
&gt; because I got the stove going.  I then went through the whole procedure of 
&gt; getting the fridge going again and sure enough it lit and stayed on all night. 
&gt; I discovered that the fridge would turn off when I was *driving* because when we
&gt; got to the trail head of our hike it was off again!  Obviously the pilot light 
&gt; was being snuffed out.  Again, can anyone identify with this?  Is
&gt; there a solution?

	My manual recommends:

	- 110V to chill down before leaving

	- 12V whilst in route (The alternater is supposed to balance the
draw on the coach battery; and, in fact, does on mine. In fact, I can run
around town on 12V, make parking stops, and not notice any significant
drop in coach voltage.)

	- Propane after setup.  Must be within 3^ of level.
