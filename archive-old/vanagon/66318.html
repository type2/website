Almost certainly a leak of some sort.  Crawl under the van and look at
and feel the clutch slave cylinder for signs of wetness.  Search down
around the footwell for signs of a leak also.  You'll probably find that
one or the other (master or slave) has a leak.

These tend to go at about the same time in my experience, so you might as
well replace or repair both.

&gt; Over two days my clutch pedal has gotten very loose, to the point where
&gt; it's almost all &quot;play&quot;. The clutch still engages fully, I have no trouble
&gt; shifting, but to engage it I have to depress the pedal all the way to the
&gt; floor and only the last couple inches actually activate the clutch. Letting
&gt; off the clutch gradually takes some very subtle footwork.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't know the clutch was hydraulic, and even the guy at the Parts Place
&gt; was surprised when he checked the Bentley manual and found that the clutch
&gt; and brakes share the master cylinder. Anyway, the brake fluid was a hair
&gt; low, I topped it up and this helped the clutch slightly for a day. Now it's
&gt; all loose again but the fluid level is still good and there are no apparent
&gt; leaks. Has anyone else experienced this problem or have any suggestions?
