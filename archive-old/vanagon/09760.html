Subject: Re: Vintage wiper blade source (east)

you're going to think this is crazy, but when my wiper motor bit the dust
in the middle on nowhere, I went to my FLAPS, got a bottle of that stuff.
Wiped it all over the windshield, and kept driving through some pretty
fierce rainstorms!!! Great stuff, if you drive fast enough :):), the rain
just beads off your windshield
