Those with dirt, gravel, or other nasty driveway or vehicular work 
area pay attention.

Those with a garage, paved driveway, or other high tech fancy 
driveway surface my ignore this message.

Went to a yard sale Saturday.  Not necessarily looking for anything, 
execpt for the odd old bus hidden in the bushes (haven't found any 
yet) or maybe some bus parts, still none.  No T3 parts either!

The area I live in is in the boonies of the California foothills, 
usually homes on a couple of acres or more, ranches, etc.

Hidden under the light coating of pine needles was an entire circular 
driveway covered in used carpet!  They managed to get loads of light 
beige carpet and just layed it out and drove on it, parked on it, 
etc.  The stuff will last for years, cost is right, you can toss it when 
you hit the lottery and build a garage!

What a great idea!  Carpet installers throw out the old stuff, would 
usually LOVE to have someone take it off their hands.  Call around to 
installers and ask them to call when they have a removal of a color 
to your liking! or just do the old dumpster dive and get what's 
available.  (it is preferable to ask permission first however)

work area however.  '67 Sqbk hanging in the back, awaiting.
