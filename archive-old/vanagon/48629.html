Subject: Re: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS and greed and so forth...

&gt;The &quot;plans&quot; I have for the type2 list name are to print stickers and
&gt;T-shirts, in order to sell them for more than they cost me.

Uh, yeah we got the idea thanks ;) tim

Sorry to rib you on a small thing, and yes, no 'gold mine' there either. But 
if someone else wants to make stickers, why the hell not? Richard got the 
ball rolling nicely for the first run, he's ready to do it again..... 

PS: you can't use vanagon_at_lenti on your sticker unless we can use  type2_at_.. 
on ours, so nyah! :)
