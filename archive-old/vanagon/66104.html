Subject:      alloy wheels FS or trade

still have 16&quot; borbet alloy wheels w/ pirelli p-7's for sale or trade
for 15&quot; alloys w/o tires.  these came w/ the 93 EV that i just bought
and are mint (should fit vanagon as well given the 5x112 bolt circle.
the et is 30).
also would trade in part for a set of jump seats in grey for the same
ev.

cheers
