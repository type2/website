Subject: some big trouble with a locking gas cap

hey now,

i've got a friend with '74? bug that has an aftermarket gas cap that locks..and
he has lost the keys to the cap...and is outta gas...what's the best way to get
the cap off without majorly damaging anything......i think i'll get rid of my
locking gas cap and find an original..what the heck can you do if the keys are
gone?
