Subject: FS 1989 Vanagon GL Westfalia

Stopped at my local VW dealer today to get transmission seals and they have a silver/grey camper 
with 30,000 miles on the odometer in excellent condition. Has an Auto trans, air and an awning but 
no alloy wheels. Asking price is $15,900. VIN #WV2ZB0257KH033173

Call Keith Harris at Royal VW _at_(407) 644-2222 and please let him know who you heard about this 
Vanagon from.
