&gt; 1.  Is it possible to install a 1700 with the cooling tin in place?

Don't know.  I installed mine with the tin off, and just put it on after
the engine was bolted up.  No big deal.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Is it REALLY possible to do Number 1(no bathroom jokes) with the seal on?

The seal?  Which seal?  The foam one that goes around the engine
compartment?  It's so simple to put that thing on after the engine is
installed, I don't know why anyone would want to do otherwise.

&gt; 3.  Is Haynes pulling my leg by saying Numbers 1 and 2 are can be done?

&gt; If can be done, any hints?, words of wisdom?

I don't trust manuals.  They all say that you can't replace the fuel
pump on a '73 without dropping the engine, which we all know is false.
I wouldn't be suprised to find other inaccuracies.  Looking at the 72-74
engine and engine compartment, I don't see how anyone can install the
engine with the fan housing on, much less the tin.  Like you say, you
have to move the engine back to clear the input shaft, and things hit
the rear of the engine compartment.  Why oh why couldn't they have made
it removable like the earlier busses?!?!?  :)

&gt; P.S.  What is FLAPS?
