&gt;The horn wasn't working on my 86 Syncro so I went to the FLAPS and bought 
&gt;a replacement horn. This is a generic blister pack, off the shelf
&gt;type of horn. It actually looks very similar to the original I'm replacing.

&gt;Here's the problem: when the horn is hooked up, the horn doesn't 
&gt;make any noise other than a single click when the horn button is pressed.

&gt;I tested the horn by hooking it directly to the battery. It &quot;beeped&quot; as 
&gt;expected.

Therefore:  the hore is good, it must the the wiring to the horn from the
battery

&gt;I took some voltage measurements and found only 9 volts across the 
&gt;terminals when the horn button is pressed. Without the horn connected, 
&gt;I get 12.5 volts.

Going backwards from the horn, somewhere you probably have a bad connection. 
It is probably a high resistance connection (as opposed to an open connection)
because when you try to draw power through it you get a voltage drop across
the connection which leaves less voltage available at the horn which is why
the horn doesn't sound.

&gt;Since I'm a computer geek and not a EE, I don't know how to interpret 
&gt;these results.

Sombody in the education system has GOT to teach computer/software folks the
fundamentals of Ohm's
law and basic circuit theory, after all computers need wiring, power,  etc.

&gt;Any ideas from the list cognescenti would be appreciated. I'm not adverse 
&gt;to buying a replacement horn from VW if that is what it takes to get
&gt;a working horn.

A very good guess is that your original horn is fine, it's the wiring to it 
or the ground connection that's got a problem.

Check all the  connections in your horn circuit.  This includes every
connection from the battery through the horn switch through the horn itself to
the ground point.  One way to do this is to plug your ears (in case the horn
suddenly works) , and then have a helper try and blow the horn while you
measure the voltage drop across each connection in the horn circuit.  When you
find one that has a measurable voltage (except across the horn terminals
themselves) take that connection appart, clean the contacting surfaces well
and then re assemble.  I don't know if VW uses a horn relay or not.  If they
do, the relay contacts may be bad and you'll need to replace the relay.

By the way - an '86 syncro - about 9 years old- probably has a Bosch based
fuel injection/engine management system.  Start &quot;Standard Soapbox lecture -
&quot;0n&quot; -- It has been my experience that the relays used in such systems become
intermittant as they age. (If you don't carry spares for the main and fuel
pump relays, you may save yourself some major inconvenience down the road and
replace them now if they are more than 5 or 6 years old and carry spares new 
as well).  These relays are generally inexpensive, perhaps $5 to 10 each
depending on the type.  You can pull them from their socket, apply 12 volts to
the coil and they will snap closed and the contacts test fine with a meter,
but will still fail intermittantly in actual usage.  If the main or fuel pump
relays get intermittant, you will be plagued by either  random occurances  of
&quot;no start&quot; or &quot;stall and won't start/run&quot;  I've been there and it took 6-9
months to figure this one out and cost me a lot of inconvenience,
embarrasement, tows to the mechanic, and of course, bill's for the mechanic's
efforts - that all come down to a coupla $10 relays that once replaced have
cured the problem for about 3 years now.  End of&quot;Standard Soapbox lecture -
&quot;Off&quot;.   :-) .
