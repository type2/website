reminds me- a friends friends' wife is From Brasil, and as she was going back
to visit, we sent with her a list of parts with part numbers to see if some
things, like corner window glass and seals, were available there. WEll, they
were, and i hope to get some,  but the funny thing is they had changed all
the part numbers to a new system - and they had to cross reference them.  I
guess they changed years ago.
