Subject: Sagging Rear...p00r RUmBa...fix?

hey now,

okay...getting ready to replace both tierods and an upper and lower ball joint.
noticed recently that Rumba's rear is sagging a bit. i know, it's a typical
problem with vw vans....i thought it was maybe the shocks..but my friendly
shadetree mechanic said it was something else.._dot_can't remember the name of
it but if you look in front...meaning towards the driver's side..in the front
of the rear tire, there is a piece of metal that is supposed to be slid forward
but is slid back. said it was expensive to fix....maybe $300. said it was a
pain on a beetle and prolly worse on a bus. suggested as an option air shocks
but said that they would be $150 to get...any ideas? how serious is this?
