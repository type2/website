&gt; When you install a new drum or a new set of brakes, you'll need to tighten

&gt; adjusted, the automatic system (backing up and braking) will cause the
&gt; racheting device to &quot;automatically&quot; adjust the brakes.  However, if the
&gt; cable or other necessary components are bound up (with brake dust or rust)
&gt; or if the rachet wheel is damaged (by an over zealous screw driver) the
&gt; auto adjust won't work.  Check the adjustment every six months, or if your
&gt; pedal starts going further towards the floor.  Since you're fronts are disc
&gt; brakes, when you gain pedal travel (brakes working less effectively) it's a
&gt; sign of one of two things, the rears are out of adjustment or you have
&gt; water or air in the brake system.

&gt; &gt; I replaced the rear brake shoes on my '84 Vanagon GL.  The Bently manual
&gt; &gt; says they will self adjust and not to adjust the emergency brake linkage
&gt; &gt; until they do (I think).
&gt; &gt; A mechanic with VW said they won't self adjust, that you have to manually
&gt; &gt; adjust them through the backing plate adjusting hole. He said not to
&gt; adjust
&gt; &gt; the emergency brake linkage, the brake shoe adjustment will take up the
&gt; &gt; slack.  I attempted this but seem to have had each turn returned by the
&gt; self
&gt; &gt; adjusting spring and lever.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I searched the archives and found discussion of self adjusting by driving
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; reverse and braking hard? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm concerned about driving without an emergency brake.  When replacing
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; brake shoes, I shifted the wheel cylinder piston and some fluid leaked
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; one side. I hope this was because I pushed the piston out too far and not
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; failing wheel cylinder?
&gt; &gt;
