Jeff, I recently aquired the rod from the left side of a westy at a 
junkyard.  The bus was a '73 and this piece was the same as in my '71.
I cut the piece in half so I could carry it home on my bike.  Now I 
have the top and bottom pieces that will hold the curtain to the 
sliding door.  My crude measurements show that this will work even 
with the curtains bunched up and straped together.  Of course, I will 
have to drill four holes in my bus to attach them.  Also, the rod will
need to be bent and drilled on one end, top and bottom.  Supply your 
own ascii...  Jim
