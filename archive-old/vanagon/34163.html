Subject: RE: Vanagon Muffler &amp; Cat

I'd recommend that you buy a muffler from NAPA.  They cost about 
$120.00 (here in Fairbanks, Alaska) and are guaranteed for the 
life of the vehicle.  I bought my first one (for an '84 Vanagon) 
around 1990.  Had to replace it this fall, it was nice not to 
have to pay for the replacement.

NAPA also sells lifetime brake shoes.  If they ever wear out the 
replacement is free.  For someone like me who plans on keeping 
my vans (I have 2 '84 Vanagons) it works out great.  An aside on 
the Catalytic Converter (I replaced one several years ago for 
about $150.00).  If you want, I'll check current prices tomorrow
for you.  For my last emission test on one vanagon, the cat was
hollow, so I swapped the good cat form the other van - six bolts
and about 10 minutes.  You might inquire if there is a listserve 
member in the near vicinity that would lend you a cat for the 
test.  According to my collegue, if the car is properly tuned up,
the cat shouldn't make a difference, but if things are marginal -
it will.  In my case, the van was on the edge, and the cat made
passing emissions a breeze.
