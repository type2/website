Cheryl L. Summers wants to know:
&gt; 
&gt; Would someone tell a newbie to vw busses what the differances are
&gt; with the Westfalia, Vanagon, Camper, Bus, and all the diff. 
&gt; models ?
&gt; TIA

&gt; Whatever pushes your buttons...

In brief (and I'm sure Ric et. al. will slam me for any mis-info. ;) ):

Some nomincalture is required for Westfalia.  Westfalia is the company
that takes various VWs and adds on such things as the camping paraphenalia
like the pop-top, sink/stove/bed/cabinets etc.  I don't know the details 
and history of the company, but that's basically what it does.

Ah-hem the Basic Vanagon was imported to the U.S. starting in ~ 1980 and
ended in 1991.  It comes with the standard 7 passenger seating of which 2
are the passenger and driver.  All other versions like the Multivan and the
Camper GL have additional goodies by Westfalia as mentioned above.

The Bus refers to the above without the Camping goodies as well as older and
newer versions that are are 7 seaters.  I'm not sure but pre-67 buses may have
had less seats, I really don't know.

The Camper is any VW bus with all of the camping goodies added maybe excluding 
the pop-top.

That's it.
