Subject: Intermittent Problems (Lancaster's Tips)

&gt;From Electronics now, Feb 1995, reproduced without permission

Don Lancaster's approach to finding intermittent electrical problems in his
1987 Synchro:

My comments are in parentheses.  Hit emphases are marked with **

1. Make sure the problem is real.
2. Have **all** service manuals on hand. **Read them!**
        (He likes Bentley)
3. Make the problem show up.  Collect data during the fault.
        (easier said than done I think)
4. Divide and conquer.  Find out where the problem is **not.**
        He hooked up an oscilloscope to the output of the Hall
sensor **while driving**, and found that it did NOT change         during
the intermittents.  Therefore he ruled out ignition         problems)
5. Assign probable causes.  Look, smell, touch, and listen.
6. Associate mechanical problems with connectors; time ones with      solder
joints; temperature ones with memory chips.
7. Cause the patent no harm.  **Never** hot plug.
        (By this I guess he means don't connect or disconnect
components with engine running?)
8. Isolate temperature problems with fans, cold, or hot boxes.
        (I can vouch for this.  I had an intermittent problem once
in an early CVCC Honda.  In hot weather it would just die,         blowing a
fuse in the process. I hated it when that                happened in the
wrong neighborhood in Philadelphia one         August!  The only cure was to
wait for it to cool.  I              eventually tracked the problem to a
carburator solenoid            valve that is supposed to prevent fuel
leakage and                 evaporation when the car is not running.  I was
able to find the intermittent short by heating the isolated         solenoid
valve with a portable hair dryer.)
9. Pay attention to **all** symptoms.  Be willing to change       tactics.
        (I definitely agree with this and the last point, #15.)
10. Hit it with your fist or otherise apply **controlled** shock.
        (He found that the problem was in his computer, because he
smacked it with his fist and the engine died!) 
11. Attack the disease, not the symptom.  Things &quot;burn out&quot; for a
reason.  Find and fix that underlying reason.  
        (e.g, see my notes for point #8).
12. Reduce the system to the simplest possible.
13. If all else fails, try to make the problem **worse**.
14. When possible, compare against an identical working unit.
        (When I had problems with my 81 Westy, I suspected the
computer.  A local garage loaned me another and the problem         was
still there. Being stubborn, I just assumed it was a           **common**
problem with the AFC computers.  I later                discover the real
problem in a shorted OXY sensor cable.)
15. Back off and give it a rest; let your subconscious do the work.
        (This is how I finally realized what was wrong.  After
days and months and several mechanics opinions and my              own
thinking about the problem, it suddently occurred to me         at work one
day. I couldn't wait to get home and test the         cable; and what a
relief to finally fix it!)
