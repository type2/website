Subject: Re: Figured out what was wrong


Well, yes, my van does have a &quot;real&quot; automatic transmission.
And the torque converter plate I referred to, is what Peter,
and all junk yards I talked to call a &quot;flex plate&quot;. The 
configuration on mine is slightly different than the 
auto-stik version. It has 5 6-star bolts in the center onto 
the crank, and three on the outside to the torque converter.
Never had any problem keeping them at the right torque. In 
fact when we first heard the noise, we pulled over, grabbed 
the Bently and the torque wrench, and checked them out. They
were at the correct torque. So what we theorized happend is 
this: this plate was from the old engine. And it was going 
at a fairly high rev when it seized up with a mighty CLUNK. 
The stress from this probably introduced invisible stress 
fractures where it bolted onto the torque converter, and 
after 1,500 miles of driving, the plate failed. One corner 
of the plate was bent 180 degrees, and was what we heard, 
and thought was a lifter failing. The vibration from the 
plate failing vibrated all of the fan bolts loose also. One 
came out completly, and the other 2 broke off. Have to be 
drilled out. Does anyone know if a stress like this can 
unbalance the fan? We have some concern about this.
