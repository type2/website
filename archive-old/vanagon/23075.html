Subject: errant fuel gauge

Perhaps you good volksfolks can give me a clue...

Last week I installed a type 1 speedo head in my 66 bus in place of the
nonfunctional speedo.  In the swap I gained a few idiot lights and a
VDO fuel gauge inboard and above the odometer.  The fuel gauge is the
electrical type which senses resistance and was originally connected to
a pullman lever type sender unit (the pivoting arm/float bowl type).
I tested the gauge with this sender (which was mounted in a 69beetle
gas tank) and with the soda can type sender which is stock in the early
model buses.  In both tests I added and reduced the effective quantity
of liquid in the tanks so as to cause the gauge to show different levels
and in both tests the sender units performed as intended.

My problem is this:  I fill the tank up and the gauge registers full, then
after a few miles I notice the level has dropped to 3/4 and a few more
miles (10-20) the gauge will show only a 1/2 tank.  This will continue over
the next few days until it will register close to reserve. At this point I
have filled the tank back up and found I've only burned 3-4 gallons.
My first thought was I had a saturated float bowl, but then I wondered why
it would go back up to full upon refilling if the bowl had absorbed some
of the fuel?  I suppose it still would register full if the tank was filled
as the lack of air in the tank would cause even a soggy float to rise to the
top, but I'm hoping the cause is something other than this. My wiring to the
sender and to ground is good (and new!) and I've bypassed the intank sender
and tested the gauge with another sender (overnite) and it doesn't waiver..
Any suggestions?
