&gt;and...  has anyone with a vanagon PS system replaced the filter in the

&gt;for the 'zecret fluid'.  This is getting too costly.  Bentley says ATF 
&gt;Dextron fluid, may rinse with it first. My fluid looks like rusty bath 
&gt;water, anyone flushed theirs out? Tips?  TIA

Tim, 

Just curious, did you ever get your system flushed?  How did you do it and
what where your expenses?  Did you end up going with the dealor filter?
