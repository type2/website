Subject: Re: Thule roof racks for Westie-Help?

Listees,

Does anybody have any feedback on whether I should get Thule or Yakima
rook racks for my Westfalia poptop?  Prices are similar, and REI sells
both.  

The people at Yakima recommend getting the shortest feet available and
using the artificial rain gutters.  Any experiences?  Thanks.
