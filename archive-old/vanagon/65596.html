 I too must thank a member of the list for his efforts.  Mr. Sam Moore
volunteered to check-out a vehicle that was near his location. The
camper was simply to far away for me to travel to, to inspect.  Sam
provide valuable information about the vehicle for me,  AND it wasn't
even a VW.  It is generous actions like these that make me feel honored
to belong to this group. Thank you to all.

Also, Thanks to the person who suggested the uses of a note to place on
discovered  Vw vanagons / future list members.  I modified a copy of the
note to fit on the back of my business card.  Now I just print the note
on a large self adhesive label and stick it to a business card. I
already keep up with my cards so I don't have another piece of paper to
shuffle.  Thanks to the creator of the Idea.

                        I think I may paint a Westy on the side of the camper.
