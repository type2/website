Subject: Re: Hole in Vanagon muffler

&gt;Wow, my '84 Vanagon has a hole in the muffler - appears to be the cause of 
&gt;
&gt;some backfire problems.  Anyway, are there any alternatives to the 
&gt;$800-$900
&gt;exhaust system?  I don't want to invest more in the pipes than the van is
&gt;worth.  (DREAMER????????)
&gt;&gt;

Try your local welding shop.  They may be able to patch the hole with gas
welding for maybe $20-$30 or so.
