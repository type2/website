&gt;So, what is really needed is  a way to insulate the van properly (as was
&gt;discussed this summer) and improving on the existing system to increase
&gt;air flow. Ideally VW should have had a third tube running up to the rear
&gt;seat and a way of recirculating all the hot air inside, plus a lot of top
&gt;quality insulation in the doors, roof and panels.
&gt;
&gt;

I've just had first hand experience on the benefits of insulation. My panel 
is fully insulated, 2&quot; to 3&quot; everywhere except front doors and front wall. 
The panel is very warm with both fans operating on '1', even at -20C. My 
Syncro, with full glass around and factory insul. still requires a jacket on 
when driving at these temps.

How to insulate?, strip the interior, everything goes out on the lawn/garage.
Check for rust, apply paint/protective sprays etc. Then fit fiberglass pink 
insulation cut carefully to fit. Peel the stuff down to get the right 
thickness. You want 'loft' or trapped airspace, _not_ densely packed 
insulation. It shouldn't bulge out much as this is difficult to push in. 
Seal the insulation over with polyethylene sheet, held with 2&quot; wide tape, 
duct or otherwise. This is the key to keeping from rusting yourself out from 
the inside. Not allowing the warm moist air to migrate to the body tin 
prevents condensation and keeps that heat trapped inside. Put your panels 
back on and refit everything else.
        Doing the roof requires ripping out the head liner, pop-riveting in 
U channels along the edge of the ceiling, and making panelling pieces fit. 
Use refrigerator cardboard for templates. The roof is hardest to do, but 
pays the biggest benefits. My panel was already bare tin so it was a bit 
easier. There is no way to insulate a Westy roof well, beyond about 4&quot; 
nearest the rain gutters and glueing styro to the roof. Make a styro panel 
to fit the roof cutout as a compromise.
        Don't use high density fiberglass noise deadening insulation, it's 
too heavy, my roof panels popped in with this stuff. The vanagon hatch 
shocks may not be up to the increased weight BTW. Mine died shortly after, 
coincidence...?
        Email me for more, since this topic must bore hell out of the warm 
climate people.     tim s.
