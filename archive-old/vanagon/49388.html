&gt;We a starting to have starting problems with our '87.  Usually happens only
&gt;in the morning.  You hop in and turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.
&gt; No click, no buzz, no RRrrRRRrrrr, nothing.  Turn the key again, same thing.
&gt; But if you turn the key and leave it there for 4-5 seconds it magically
&gt;kicks in ans starts up with no other problems.  Starts fine the rest of the
&gt;day and does not hapeen every morning.  Any ideas?
Maybe the solenoid is sticking/binding, and it takes 4-5 seconds of continuous
current before it &quot;breaks free&quot; and kicks in?  I would first check the
condition of the wires and connections at the starter.  High resistance due
to corrosion would reduce the voltage to the solenoid.
