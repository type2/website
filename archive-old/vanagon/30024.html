Subject: Oil Cooler?

Hi All~
        Here's a newbie question. I'll start with usual stuff: Just
purchased an '81 with 118,000 miles. The engine was replaced with a dealer
rebuilt at 110,000. By the time it got to 118,000 one of the heads had
given out, the old owner decided to sell and I came into the picture. In
the interest of trying to prolong the life of the engine, I've heard an oil
cooler is a good idea. I'm interested in (1) if this is a good idea and (2)
what the recommend cooler is.

Thanks / Cheers~
Aaron.

P.S. My other thought for something that might be handy is a tachometer.
Suggestions here would also be appreciated.
