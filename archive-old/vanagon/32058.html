Subject: Balky starter

Any thoughts on why my starter won't in this current -25C (-13F) weather.  
Battery fine, toasty with electric blanket around.  Solenoid fine, wiring 
fine, dual batteries BTW, spare is cold though. Yesterday it worked 
perfectly after I tapped it a couple of times, happened twice, 6hrs apart.  
This AM no go, nada.  Until I took a propane torch and warmed up the starter 
casing and the solenoid. Then instant start, no slow spinning, just like 
summertime, so I know the wiring is fine.  Is there a grease problem, 
sticking brushes, baked commutator?  It will spin fine 6+ times in a row 
once its been running too. Thoughts?  TIA, Tim
