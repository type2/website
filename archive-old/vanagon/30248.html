Subject: '73 Bad Tyre Wear

My engine is now back in, with the oil gushers cured, but as always
just a one problem is sorted another one appears.
I have had an eye on my front tyres for a while now, they are wearing
away on the outside. I have had the tracking done twice now to no avail.
Is there something else that would cause this wear?
Also when the tyres were new they made a squealing noise when going around
a corner, even at low speed.
Is the place where I get my tracking done missing something out?
At this rate I will be spending more money on rubber than fuel :(

Thanks for any help
