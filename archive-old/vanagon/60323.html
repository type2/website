Subject: shakedown trip with infant

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Clearly this technique isn't going to work once she's more mobile - I
&gt;don't
&gt;want to find her sleeping in the foot well by the sliding door! Has anyone
&gt;come up with any interesting tricks to keep a sleeping infant confined safely?
&gt;&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Do you still have the box she came in?
&gt;

&gt; Seriously, we used the cardboard box provided by Ballard Hospital to take our
&gt;first infant camping.  It had a thin pad on the bottom, high sides so the kid
&gt;could not escape, and handy handles on the ends for easy transport.  We'd tuck
&gt;young Teddy in for the night and set the box on the fold up table.  First time
&gt;Mom could reach him quickly for those frequent feedings and first time Dad
&gt;could get a full nights sleep, important in those early months of child
&gt;rearing.

This one reminds me of when we first got our cat - put him in a washing
machine box each night. That lasted about 2 nights I think, with the cat
wailing up a storm!

Seriously though, they don't hand out cardboard boxes at the hospital anymore.
(something about that state law requiring child seats I suspect!)

The best idea I like so far is keeping her in the back behind the rear seat.
Of course, we've grown accustomed to using the top bunk for storage while
we're deployed, but it may be time to rethink that.
I'll have to see if I can seal off the various places where she could get
wedged back there.
