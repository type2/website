&gt; When you get the bars off, the rear of the tank lowers and the front

If you have an older tank like my '82, the wire that connects to the sender
doesn't do so in the vertical plane; it does it in the horizontal plane, so if
you drop the tank down, you'll break the connection on the sender.  Just lower
the tank a little and reach up there and carefully pull the wire loose.

&gt; What a pain, though. If you do it, try to clean things off first,
&gt; and do get all new seals -- and a number of hose clamps. Some of the
&gt; connections I had to break had those factory-installed clamps that you
&gt; can't get off without side-cutters and can never, ever be reused.

BTW Nail pullers work better than side cutters for removing those crimped on
clamps.
