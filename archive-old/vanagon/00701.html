Subject: how do clean it?


For this '83 beast, its battery leaks and white power is forming wherever
the metal is touching the fluid. What is the easiest way to clean it up
without a surgery? Because the batery is right on top of the fuel tank's
pipe, I can see the &quot;white stuff&quot; build-up on the pipe too. It bothers
me....
