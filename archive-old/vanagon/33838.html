Subject: Re: bulletproof....

&gt; During the gulf war we shot an Iraqi Vanagon with a TOW 
&gt; anti-tank missile--it wasn't bulletproof....

&gt; Gives new definition/meaning to the term &quot;Overkill&quot; -- did the warhead
&gt; detonate or couldn't it find anything solid enough to set it off?   (Seriously
&gt; folk there are examples in WWII of destroyers being hit by 14&quot; battleship
&gt; shells, only reason the ship didn't immediately cease to exist was that they
&gt; were armor piercing shells and fuses.  The destroyer was too flimsy to set off
&gt; the fuse and/or slow down the shell so that the shell went right through the
&gt; ship and went into and or detonated in the water on the far side of the ship)

Yeah, it went off.  The initial impact was enough to trigger the warhead 
but not enough to stop it.  it punched through the van leaving a 4&quot; hole and 
exploded on the inside.  The force of the blast was directed entirely at 
the passenger side of the van which didn't hold up to well.  Didn't hold 
up at all actually.

BTW, the driver/passengers were some lucky SOB's.  they had been
transferring boxes of what-not from a cinderblock shed to the van then driving
off and then returning for more boxes. we had been watching them through our
nightsights for a while before we decided to deal with them.  Shortly
after the Fire! command was given the occupants left the Vanagon for more
boxes.  When the missile struck, they were in the shed which protected
them from the blast.  The blast got their attention and they stepped out
see what the fuss was.  Just in time as missile two was headed for the
shed. It punched through the wall and exploded inside which contained much of
the force of the blast.  They walked away.
