&gt;
&gt;FWIW I got the rebuild kits for the clutch master and slave
&gt;cylinders the other day from my local import parts guy.  VW
&gt;had only the slave kit available for $31, well import guy
&gt;wants $20 for master kit (2 seals, 1 belows, 1 clip) and
&gt;$20 for slave kit for FAG cylinder (1 seal, 1 belows, 2 clips)
&gt;and $15 for slave kit for ATE cylinder (as above, 1 clip) I bought
&gt;all these as both Vans '81 and '85 needed rebuilt, and they have
&gt;each type of slave.  They also have 1 ATE and 1 FAG master but
&gt;the rebuild kit is interchangeable for masters.  
&gt;
&gt;Further FWIW the master cylinder kit is Beck/Arnley World Parts
&gt;part no 071-7491 is made in germany with a FAG bellows but
&gt;&quot;generic&quot; seals.
&gt;
&gt;The FAG slave kit is a FahrzeugTechnik part contains all FAG
&gt;rubber components and carries their number 656-111 or VW 251 798 041
&gt;Bellows is FAG K2559, seal is FAG H25305
&gt;
&gt;The ATE slave kit is a Wagner kit again with all FAG parts their
&gt;part F103522.  Bellows is FAG K2351 6, seal is FAG H25302, seals
&gt;are near enough interchangeable, bellows are drastically different
&gt;diameters, we'll see if everything fits tomorrow weather allowing.
&gt;
&gt;I also had to pick up a smaller 2 stone cylinder hone for the
&gt;master cylinders which set me back $14 for a nice Lisle tool
&gt;but annoyingly the stones are fairly coarse and finer were
&gt;not to be had, as I'm not about to make a final finish hone
&gt;and can't get sandpaper far enough down the small bores, I'll
&gt;live with the finish, better than I had anyway.
&gt;
&gt;So for a total investment of about $90 I'm rebuilding all
&gt;4 cylinders, where 1 rebuilt master was going to run me the
&gt;same amount.  I'm pretty satisfied but have only thus rebuilt
&gt;the masters, will do the slaves tomorrow.  Seals were not
&gt;quite like OEM for the masters but should not affect function.
&gt;
&gt;I STRONGLY URGE people to bleed these things out now while you
&gt;can, standard brake procedure works fine regardless of Bentleys
&gt;warnings to use a pressure bleeder, Haynes says do it the old
&gt;fashioned way.  The master cylinders in these systems have some
&gt;rather intricate and in both of my cases rather clogged valving
&gt;in the piston and resevoir feed.  I'm not even sure what the valves
&gt;do entirely but expect both my systems to be much improved.  Bleeding
&gt;these would have prevented the profound amounts of sediment from
&gt;forming in each, let alone the rust.
