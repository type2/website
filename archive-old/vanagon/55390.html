&gt; 	AVI seems to be priced a little better than GEX. Gex wants $1799. for
&gt; the 1.9 and $1999. for the 2.1. Plus there is a $600. core deposit. Im
&gt; sure there is some room for bargining
&gt; 	Well that decides it. My 2.1L is still running great after 112k, but
&gt; when the inevidible occurs, I'm putting in a GTI. GEX has 1800cc 110hp,
&gt; GTI engines for $929. plus a $300. core. With that added power I hope to
&gt; get better mileage too. Now to track down the needed parts...

I agree this seems a much better choice. My local VW wrecker has 
quoted me $800 for all the pieces needed from a Diesel Vanagon to do 
the swap. Pretty steep, but still cheaper than a new 2.1. I hope to 
get a few more years out of mine though.
