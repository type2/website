&gt;:(  i'm in my bus and waved at a vanagon camper yesterday; flashed my lights
&gt;and waved like crazy:
&gt;
&gt;i got a slight movement of the wrist in return.  :(

I'm in the habit of waving to all Splits, Busses, V'gons and EVs.

Here in RI, there aren't many of any of these. I almost always get waves
back from the busses and splits, 50% on the Vanagons and only once from an
EV. 

My wife initially thought that waving to other drivers was something &quot;You
shouldn't do&quot;. (Who knows, New England Puritan ethics I guess :-). But
now she enjoys it as much as I do. When we are together in the Vanagon, 
we try to make it a game to see how many in the other vehicle will wave.

Friday she told me she waved to an EV and got a response. Its the first 
that has waved back to her. Granted, she has only seen probably less than 
10 but for her it was a moral victory.

So, long story short... it was interesting the EV wave thread just started.
Now I'm getting a little veclempt... Talk among yourself...  I'll give you 
yet another topic.. &quot;Microsoft is neither micro nor soft. Discuss&quot; :-)

&gt; Was it anything like the full extension of the third finger?
&gt; 
&gt; When our street got completely flooded last winter, I set up a sign
&gt; at my house and stood out there trying to keep people from enterin (cause
&gt; the make a big traffic jam where the road dips and creates a river) and
&gt; one guy flying by in a 4x4 flipped my off and kept going.  A few hours later
&gt; he was able to get a buddy to come pull him out, and his truck sat in front
&gt; of my house for a day or so until he got a tow truck to come get it...
