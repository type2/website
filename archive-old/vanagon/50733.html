Try the Volks-Motorsports page at  http://www.volks-motorsports_dot_com for any 
new parts you need.  Also, send them Email about machining the heads, I'm not 
sure if they do that.

Subject:  1986 Vangon Cylinder head leaks - repair / Vanagon parts

Hi all.
Today while driving my 1986, I noticed the temp. warning light flashing (!)
so I pulled over &amp; stopped - noticed a stream of coolant coming from the
passenger side head :-(  
The engine had not overheated - the light just came on because the coolant
level became low in the reservoir.
Anyway, after having the Vanagon towed home, I removed the engine (quite
easy) and now have it to the point of having both cylinder heads off.  There
is a LOT of really bad pitting on the passenger side head sealing surface,
and less on the drivers side head - though there still is some pitting.  
So I need to have the heads repaired - can someone recommend a place that
will rebuild heads?  Do the rebuilt heads include new valves/guides?
Also, where is a good (cheap) place to buy VW parts (say a mail order
business)?  I am thinking of replacing the water pump now as it has a little
play in the bearing - and of course will need a gasket set.
Last question - when I removed the heads, the barrels were stuck to the
head, so came out of the case somewhat when I removed the head.  Should I
now remove all the barrels completely to replace the gaskets/sealing rings
for the coolant jacket?  Is it difficult to compress the piston rings to
replace the barrels?

Thanks for ANY help!
regards
MIKE
