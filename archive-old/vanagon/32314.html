Subject: RE: Wet Feet - Windshield Gasket Repair


&gt;First off, I would like to thank everyone on this list, I learned
&gt;so much over the past year.  The list has changed me from a VW
&gt;driver to a VW enthusiast (I now constantly scan the papers for
&gt;busses I don't need).                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That's not an &quot;enthusiast&quot;... it's an &quot;addict&quot;. As the rest of us know
quite well-- you're in good company! Welcome!
