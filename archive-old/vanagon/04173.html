I realize I'm posting to the wrong group but does anyone know about a user
group dealing with VW Vanagons? ;-p 8-o :-)

Gerry, is there a possibility of a USENET entry onto the list? Also, for
matters of national security (and sanity) please forget how to access who
posts what and post it publicly. Maybe it could be stored in a nuclear waste
facility in some Arizona/New Mexico salt cave.


Also, does anyone know ho I may obtain an official Westy accessories catalog?
I'm intrigued by the &quot;space blanket&quot; liner for the canvas. BTW, did my post
asking about canvas replacement get to the net? My eyes still can't focus from
going through 18 screens of msgs on oldies music, and &quot;oh yeah&quot; &quot;right on&quot;,
etc. , so I don't remember if'n it got to the list.
