ah, hehehe i'm just an 'inventory control specialist'. but i do have the 
fame of driving the only vw van in my parking lot. alot of the younger 
crowd (18-23) call it the pickle. of course they like lexus's, bmw's, etc.
i get a good teasing about it but i tell them at least i'm not making 
monthly payements for the next 200 years.
