Subject: RE: Bay Area drive-in night!


&gt;&gt;But seriously, me and a bunch of friends loaded up in the Pioneer and
&gt;&gt;went to the last remaining drive-in theater in town to see the double
&gt;&gt;feature James and the Giant Peach and Mr. Holland's Opus.
&gt;
&gt;This reminds me... When are we going to have a Bay Area drive-in movie
&gt;night?  I have this great idea for a poster, as well as a large-format
&gt;camera....


Sounds fun!

...but wouldn't a magnesium fire make the movie screen kinda hard to see?
