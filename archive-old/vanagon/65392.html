A SPECIAL PLEA from your VANAGON LIST admins ...

DO NOT post virus warnings (such as the one just posted) to this list, or
any other list for that matter. In most cases (99%), you are doing nothing
more than propagating a meaningless message that puts the fear in many who
are unknowing.

THIS is a very important request. Our host institution, SDSC, is a leader
in computer security. We have some of the world's top security people
in-house, and if they feel we (I) ought to know about a particular virus,
worm, etc. they'll usually tell me (in which case I'll post to the list if
I feel it's germaine). It does not bode well when a 'hoax' virus posting
originates from an SDSC server (gerry_at_sdsc_dot_edu), our VANAGON list server.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE heed my request ...

Your friendly (or at least trying to stay that way) VANAGON List Co-Admin,
Chris
