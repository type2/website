Subject: '54 Update - Strategy

Yo,

	I talked with Charlie Hamill last night about the strategy
to use for replacing the underbelly of my bus.  As you prolly know
I have to replace almost all of the frame, but I have do it with 
the bus still connected, as you can't &quot;pan off&quot; a bus :(

	Those of you who do not know Charlie Hamill, well, he's 
basically the Bus Restoration God.  A Bob Hoover of bus aquisition
and restoration.  I'm trying to weasle a set of pix he took doing
another guy's '54 Deluxe, which was in worse shape than mine (if you
canbelive that)

	Anyway, to the meat of the story. I was gonna replace the
longitudinal rails, and then the cross members.  Charlie sez to do
it the other way; replace the inner and outer rockers, then do the
longitudinals.  His rationale was interesting and seemed sound.  The
idea is to use the rockers to stabilize the I-beams, (I-beams being
the crosswise suports under the floor) and then use 
supports under the i-beams to support the bus when I remove the 
frame rails.  The man has done this a few times, so I tend to 
believe him...

	My next step in working on the bus is to sandblast and primer
the underbelly.

	So, now I've gotta shop for a new compressor and a sandblaster.
Everyone's telling me to get the pressure fed kind of blaster and not the
siphon type.  Sound logic there, too.  I'm going tonight to look
at a used 5hp 60 gallon, 220v compressor that the guy wants $300/bo for.

	Any input on blasting experiences is welcome.

Thom
