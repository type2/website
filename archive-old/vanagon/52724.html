Subject: Busses for sale, SF Bay Area, CA

 Just for grins, I'm sending along all the VW bus-related ads in the
 &quot;Classified Flea Market&quot;, our local free classified ad flyer.  These
 vehicles would all be located in the S.F. east bay area of California
 - Oakland, Fremont, places like that.  I've sent them along just like
 they read in the ad, so if you can't understand what the seller is
 saying, blame him, not me.  Telephone numbers are probably all in the
 510 area code
