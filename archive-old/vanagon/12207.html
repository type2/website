You should know that there are two kinds of seals for the front doors:
German and Brazilian. There is a difference in quality: the German seals
fit better and do a better job of sealing out air and water. There may
also be a difference in longevity. David Schwarze told me that his
Brazilian ones were starting to tear at the corners after only 2 years.
The upper back and lower front corners of the doors are left empty with
the Brazilian rubber. However, German seals are about 4 times more
expensive ($81 vs. $19 at most places). 

The final decision rests with you. It depends on how rich you are and how
long you plan to keep your bus. I got the Brazilian ones because I didn't
believe the sales guy. The price difference is huge. I figured I could
always buy the German ones, once I'm rich and famous.:)
