&gt; I refueled at Tehachapi and worked out the fuel consumption
&gt;
&gt; figures.  This too is part of proper engine management.  If you
&gt;
&gt; see your mileage beginning to dwindle it's pretty good evidence
&gt;
&gt; your engine needs attention.  But I didn't believe the numbers.
&gt;
&gt; They said I'd gotten near forty miles to the gallon out of the
&gt;
&gt; last batch of fuel. --
&gt;
&gt; i absolutely agree with this.  When i had Gus, a 59 panel converted to
&gt; riviera camper converted to 70's naugahyde custom, i had no gas gauge and
&gt; kept detailed records of fueling up so i wouldnt run out.  My average MPG was
&gt; ~31, which i think largely reflected the gearing and type of driving i did.
&gt;   I once got 40 mpg,  while driving UP the Sierras.  i never could figure
&gt; that one out.    Then one day i suddenly got a measely 16mpg,  striking a
&gt; chord of terror through my heart.  When i got home i did a compression check
&gt; and found 65 in #3 (surprise! well, it had always been weak), the rest
&gt; 110-120.
&gt;
&gt; Funny thing was that performance had not changed, and neither had the sound
&gt; of the motor.  All he needed was rebuilt heads, new rings, and i threw in rod
&gt; bearings for good luck.  :)
&gt;
&gt; ps, it has already rained 17inches this year here in Oly, WA.  but not all at
&gt; once!     Sounds like a looney trip!


That's pretty amazing, if you ask me, though I'm not saying it couldn't
happen.  I once got about 40mpg in my old 66 Dodge van, but it was when I
was in the middle of Navajoland and had to coast down hills in the
backcountry with the engine off to make it to a gas station on a SUNDAY.
Made it, but it took about 4 hours to go 80 miles.

My 67 used to always get 21mpg +-, depending on head/tailwinds etc.  This
with a stockish 1687 and stock carburetion.  I kept rebuilding (not really,
using the kits) the german 30-pict carb, till things were just falling off
(including that damned brass fitting we all know and love).  Decided to try
one of the Mexican carbs (Bocar on the box).  Linkages were sloppy,
(producing a BAD hesitation on acceleration because the acc. pump didn't
engage till the throttle was almost to the floor), so I did some welding
(with the thing OFF the engine and dry!) and filing, and some reusing of
parts from the german carb.  I always got 23mpg or better, plus my back
bumper no longer had that telltale black area above the tailpipe that I
always had before.  Don't know if it was the jetting or what.  Sweet runner
from then on, too.
