&gt;Hello all,
&gt;Ah, the infamous auxiliary battery.  I am seriously considering mountin
&gt;one in my newly acquired '81 Westy.  I think I know the basics of wiring
&gt;it all up, but I need to know what size battery will fit under the
&gt;driver's seat.  I seem to remember Group 41 deep cycle batteries work
&gt;well.  I suppose I will also want a relay to switch between the aux.
&gt;battery powering my accessories when camping and allowing both to charge
&gt;when driving.  I intend to have the aux. battery power the over-sink
&gt;light, the dome light, the aftermarket reading lamps, the stereo, and
&gt;perhaps also the silver socket and cigarette lighter in anticipation of
&gt;future accessories.  I imagine that the sink light and the dome light
&gt;are both on the same fuse?  Looks like a lot of wiring coming my way.  
&gt;
&gt;So, who's done it and how easy is it?

If you can find a Group 41 deep cycle battery that fits under the drivers'
seat, I want to hear about it.  Since I bought one of these furnaces, I
suspect I'll need a larger battery than the wheelchair model I have under
my seat now.

&gt;From everything I've heard, group 41 deep-cycle batteries aren't available
in the states.
