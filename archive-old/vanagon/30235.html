Subject: need, new 1.9L engine,where do I get one?

My head gasgets are bad again.  They were just replaced 10 Mos. ago and new
heads 2 years ago.  I,ve been informed that my 165,00 mi engine is to worn
and that even redoing the gasgets, more air will get through.
A new engine was recomended.  At $2445.00 for a factory rebuilt and about
$800 for someone to put it in.  I won't put the money out.
Is there any cheaper way to get a rebuilt engine besides the factory ones?
Like 1/2 that price.  Of course doing it myself is not an option for me.  
thanks for any info.
Fred
