Hey all,
I was just reading Bob's sermon on capacitive discharge ignition modules
and I think I'm going to get one for my '81 Vanagon.  Mine is a
non-California model and as such still has the old points and condenser
setup.  Bob notes that the CDI module made by Universal Corp. can
increase gas mileage by as much as 25%.  For me, that sounds like a
godsend as I've been getting crappy mileage anyway, a 25% increase could
get me up near 20 mpg on the highway.  Bob also notes that the spark
plugs can be gapped much wider, does anyone know how much wider?

I'll post this to v_at_l and type2 as I think I might be able to get more
of a response from the type2ers, as most of their buses came with points
and condenser engines unlike you Vanagon types :)

Oh yeah, does anyone know how much this thing costs?  Is it in the J.C.
Whitney catalog?

Thanks,
Sean
