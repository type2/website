&gt; I can second this.  On a very rare occasion, as in maybe 4-6 times since
&gt; '85, my Golf has displayed this interesting characteristic.  I've always
&gt; written it off as an increase in sun spot activity or possibly getting
&gt; caught in a magnetic flux capacitance wave.

Well, I wiggled the wires connected to the expansion tank and opened
the tank a crack -- coolant immediately started spilling 
out on the ground.  Then I read the procedure in Bentley for 
bleeding the system(&lt;--I think this scared it) and decided I didn't 
want to do that today.  The blinking went away and hasn't come back.

I expect it probably needs to be bled, but I also suspect that won't 
get done before we head to Utah.  Too much to do....
