Subject: The Tao of VW busses



Martha Rubin's Red Rock Trip Report reminded me of some reading I've
been doing about Taoism (specifically, Benjamin Hoff's books).  Driving a
VW bus is sort of an *attitude*.  (Gee, Bill Persig would be proud!)


To paraphrase something I read a while ago:


    The great teacher asked three of his students why they drive VW busses.

    The first replied &quot;I drive a VW bus because it uses little gasoline.&quot;

    &quot;Good&quot;, replied the teacher, &quot;you have learned the virtue of economy.&quot;

    The second student said &quot;I drive a VW bus because it carries everything
  I need.&quot;

    &quot;Excellent&quot; praised the teacher, &quot;you have learned the lesson of form
  following function.&quot;

     The third student said simply, &quot;I drive a VW bus to drive a VW bus.&quot;

     &quot;Master, I am your student!&quot; said the teacher.
