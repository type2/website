Subject: Re: Bus vs. Bug generators

&gt;I am looking for a rebuilt generator for my '71 bus.  The books say I
&gt;need the ....17x version which is 3/8&quot; longer than the ....15x.  The
&gt;15x is widely available for about $55 rebuilt.  The cheapest I can

        Uhh, I thought the T1 &amp; T2 &lt;'71 engines were virtually identical,
the only difference being compression, tin, and the rear-mount threads for
the T2. And that therefore the gen. would also be identical. Is your engine
*really* a T2? Mine was originally sold in a '70 T1, I've always used the
standard gen., never even knew there was another.

Peace,
