A really quick and easy way to hang a privacy curtain in my `74 has been to
fashion a curtain that is angled correctly that slides back and forth on a
clothesline-type cord (two piece curtain, splits in the middle).  In the
middle of the cord I've wrapped a piece of electrical tape forming a tab that
sticks out.  I then just unclip the dome light, stick the tab into the hole
and clip the dome light back in which securely pinches the tape, holding the
cord up.  I tie the ends of the curtain cord on the two knobs on either side
of the bus.

This is a solution that is easy to put up and take down.  If I were going to
make it more permanant I would probably make some kind of metal tab or hook in
the middle to hang the cord on, and maybe something other than the knobs on
the side to tie it to.  Also, some other kind of tape might be better than
electrical since it stretches fairly easily (strapping tape comes to mind).
