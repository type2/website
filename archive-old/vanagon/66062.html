Denys--

I'm behind on picking up my e-mail (and just about everything else) so please
excuse the late response. But I close all the windows on my Westy before
dropping the roof to close the top. This creates a vacuum, and the canvas
billows out while the roof very slowly drops. This gives me time to grab the
canvas and roll and pull it in under the roof as it closes. And the roof
never has to rest on my head messing up my hair-- Afterall it's who you look
like, not who you are.

For me it works like a charm.

Good Luck
Jeff
83.5 Westy
