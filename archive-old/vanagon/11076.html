&gt;I thought you were supposed to have a big tank for spraying, like 20-30 gallons 
&gt;minimum. But if it works...what the hey!
&gt;
&gt;My VW's all have good paint, but I've got a shell of a 2002 that's stripped and 
&gt;ready to paint. Well, maybe the paint needs to be roughed up and feathered a 
&gt;bit, but that's about it. It's got &quot;come spray me&quot; written all over it.
&gt;
&gt;I'm willing to guinea-pig away! Want an all expense paid trip to 
&gt;beautiful.....San Jose?

Do you have a garage to do this in?  Maybe we should take this off line?
