Subject: fuel gauge sender unit.

...i replaced my fuel  gauge sender unit when i had the engine out anyways.
looks like it would be a hell of a job to do with the engine in. friend of
mine drilled a huge hole through the firewall from the inside of the car
rite above the sender unit, but you'd have to know EXACTLY what you do
'cause otherwise you'd puncture the tank and get blown to Mars...
  hope this helps...

&gt; Anyone know how to repair the odometer, mine doesn't work and the gas gauge
&gt; doesn't either.  Makes for an interesting trip.  If I need to replace the
&gt; speedometer how much is a new, used, overhauled one going to cost.  Does the
&gt; vanagon have a peculiar speedo or can it be replaced with one from another
&gt; type VW?  How difficult a job to drop the tank and replace fuel sending unit?
&gt;
&gt; Oil sending unit can leak oil.  Replaced mine and no more oil drips under the
&gt; van.
