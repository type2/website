Subject: Help w/ Front Signal Assembly

I need a front passenger signal light assembly for my 85 Vanagon GL.  
I think that they are the same for all 80 -91 Vanagons.  I also need 
a grill to fit the same but I think that the grills are only 
compatible from 80 to 85.  I need to get my hands on this signal 
assembly asap for my body shop to get started on repairing some front 
end work.

If you can help me out, contact me via email until 12:00 noon sunday. 
 Afterwards, please leave a message for me at my business line at:
800-896-4959.  I have to leave town for the week but I will retrieve 
my messages twice a day from my voice mail.

Many thanks,

Greg
