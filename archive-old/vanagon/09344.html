&gt; Has anyone had any experience using synthetic oil

&gt; Westfalia and I'm thinking about using Redline MTL.

I don't think MTL is what you want.  I use that in my Mustang's
transmission.  From what I understand, MTL is a special formula
that is similar to ATF and the only manual gearbox I know of that
uses it is the Borg Warner T-5 in the Mustang.   There are synthetic
70-90 weight lubes that should work for you though.

&gt; Redline also makes a product called Water Wetter that
&gt; is supposed to reduce friction in your cooling system
&gt; so that the engine cools more efficiently. Anyone
&gt; tried this?

No, but the gearheads on the Fordnatics list swear by the stuff.
I don't think it's main claim to fame is reduced friction.  It is
supposed to reduce cavitation and increase heat transfer.

&gt; I use Redline in the transmission of my everyday car
&gt; and it has improved the shifting, especially on very cold 
&gt; mornings.

I didn't notice much of a difference in the Mustang...  I was kind
of disappointed.
