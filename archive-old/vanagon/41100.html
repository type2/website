We don't do polls here.  This isn't a democracy.  For those who prefer a
newsgroup format, there are already groups in existance that they can read:

rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled (I think, I don't subscribe to this one)

There are other options available, such as mail filters, which you can
configure to sort your incoming mail, depending on which software you are
using to read your mail.  To me, the Vanagon list mail is interesting
enough that I am willing to manually sort through all of the messages each
day.  I delete the threads that aren't of interest to me, skim the messages
with subjects that I think might be interesting, and read the ones that
definately *are* of interest to me.  Takes me about half an hour, usually.
Not unreasonable, if you consider it a hobby as I do.  :)
