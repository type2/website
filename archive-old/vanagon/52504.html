Subject: 85 spedo repair

make that speedo repair...

The previous posts were good reading! My odo has been on holiday for about a
year. When it broke I called the local speedo/tach repair place and inquired
about the possible purchase of replacement gear or the source of their
supplier for them. &lt; ;-)  &gt; I was met with a eliteist &quot;let them eat cake&quot;
(or something similar) attitude and as she was marking her territoy, I was
told that THEY had the exclusive rights to the gears in Arizona. She went on
to mention that yes the gear only costs about a dollar or two but they only
installed them with a complete R&amp;R of the speedo. Over $100.00 US with no
guarantee. I literally laughed at the lady and have ignored the problem. I
am a firm believer in searching for the root source for things. People who
try to feed me horse apples like that make me laugh.
I will have to try the epoxy routine...
