Subject: Introduction and Re: Second batteries..

Hello, fellow VW bus-folks:

I was reading the newsgroup when I read the info on this group,
immediately stopped reading news, and subscribed to the list.
The first posting I got was:
 
&gt; I saw a note about someone asking if anyone had put a second battery into
&gt; their bus.. I've got a 73 and would be interested in the info too... I was
&gt; thinking about possibly running a deep-cycle as a a second, mostly for
&gt; camping (leaving the lights and radio on, etc)..
&gt; 
&gt; Jamie
&gt; 

Strangely enough I have (among others) this same exact question.

See:
I just bought a '73 camper (my first VW) from a garage that had just
rebuilt the engine and put in a new clutch. (The guy didn't want to
pay the bill)  I will undoubtedly have other questions, including
the one above, but my most urgent is:
 
How should I treat my new engine?  I want it to last as
long as possible and hope to avoid any break-in mistakes that
would shorted its life.

Any tips appreciated.

-Patrick
