So Michael A. White says:
&gt; 
&gt; Ack!  I ran Semi-synthetic in my 1776 and it went from a mildly warm 
&gt; running engine to a cooker.  I quickly went back to dino and solved 
&gt; my problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently synthetic sheds the heat into the case, and in our little 
&gt; air (really oil) cooled engines, you need the heat to stay in the oil 
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; until it goes through the air-cooler. 

I'm really having trouble with this last statement.  I realize that the
oil passes through the engine and thereby absorbs some of the heat, but
I still believe that the air/fan does most of the essential cooling.
Anyone care to comment on this?  Maybe the synthetic doesn't absorb
as well as the dino-oil?
