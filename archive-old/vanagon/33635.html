Subject: Proper Starting Procedure (was RE: Cold Starting Question)

So Bill Ernest says:
&gt; 
&gt; Greetings all,
&gt; 
&gt; This thread seems to be developing into a discussion of the proper starting 
&gt; procedure for VWs.  I of course, am no expert and in the course of looking 
&gt; for some information on this collected these responses.
&gt; 
&gt; As for my concern around this, I have an 83 Westfalia (Fuel Injected) and 
&gt; find that pumping the gas pedal once before starting allows for an easier 
&gt; start.  When I don't do it my idle is very weak and the bus stalls during 
&gt; warm up.

I suspect that when you push on your accelorator, you are partially opening
your thottle plate and making the opening slightly larger than when it was
before.  This is allowing it to idle better.  This tells me that your throttle
plate is not adjusted correctly and/or needs to be cleaned of the dirt deposits
around the plate and opening.  I would also check that the idle bypass is
working correctly (assuming your model has one, I'm not sure if it does).
&gt; 
&gt; Now, in my limited Muir knowledge it seems as though he mentions the good of 
&gt; pumping the accelerator before starting (in his choke-less busses) but also 
&gt; admonishes doing it in later passages.  All I know is that it works for me, 
&gt; and thanks to others input I have a clue as to why:

This pumping is only good for vehicles with carbs because they have accelorator
pumps that will squit a small amount of gas into the throat of the carb and
will help a fuel starved engine start.  It can also cause it to flood too.
So more pumping is not better.
