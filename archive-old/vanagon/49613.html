I recently got a quote from the VW dealer for an axle for my '80.
For a new axle (complete with 2 CV's) they quoted me $740.  Four 
bearings for $145 is suchadeal!, comparatively.  They can TRY to sell 
things at that price, but WILL they is another matter.  Anyone with 
half a brain won't pay it, but then there are Insurance Jobs . . . .

&gt; assembly which bolts on at both ends? Even VWOA can't sell four
&gt; bearings for $145, can they?
