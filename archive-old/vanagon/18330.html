Steve's last words and testament:
&gt; 
&gt; The new AFM did not help my running rich problem. Next step is
&gt; replacing the ECU. I have found one used for $250. Depending on where I
&gt; shop I could have gotten a new/rebuilt one for between $300-$600. But
&gt; this way I have one to take apart and study.

Before biting the big one (ECU) did you check, and my most humble 
apologies if this was previously mentioned:
-engine grounds (left side on block, lotsa brown wires on an eyelet)
-exhaust system leaks (a break in the exhaust system may allow air to 
be sucked in during a pulse and fool the O2 sensor into thinking the 
engine is lean and needs more fuel)
-a bleeding injector (dirt deposits keeping one open, several ways to 
clean if needed)

Best luck!  Oh, just try (with the key off) unplugging and plugging 
in the ECU harness.  Sometimes this cleans corrosion enough to fix 
wierd things.
