Subject: diesel regulations?

Hi
I have a question.  I am planning on driving west this fall in my Diesel 
Westy.  I read in the back of Bentley that some states require a permit 
in order to purchase diesel fuel.  Does anyone now which states, if any, 
require a permit?  If so, how does one go about acquiring one? I 
appreciate any leads...
