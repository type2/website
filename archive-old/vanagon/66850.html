 Wow, that's dedication.  I wish I had the guts to sell my wife when she
 complains about the repair bills ;^)

 On the serious side, I'm sorry you have to make such a decision; I think
 I may have to do the same with my 914 sometime soon.

I had to make a decision like this one time.  It was about a 1969 Chevrolet
Impala Custom Coupe.  One day the wife said, &quot;It's me or the car!&quot;.  So the
car went.......about 7 years later!  So far she hasn't said the same bout the
Westy!
