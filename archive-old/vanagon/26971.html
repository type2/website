Subject: Value of '87 Syncro Westfalia

I looked at an '87 Westfalia today, Syncro, very nice, 67K miles. It's a GL 
with locking rear differential and no other options as far as I could tell. 
The owner is asking $17,500. Is this a reasonable price? I know these are 
pretty rare, but do they really go for this much?
