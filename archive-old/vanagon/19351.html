&gt; Duly noted.  Thanks.  Wouldn't your wife like to go to Mexico for
&gt; her birthday?  :)
&gt; 
&gt; /m
&gt; 
&gt;   I think I'll forward this to her since you might not believe how
&gt;   dead set she is against camping (she was scared by a tent when she
&gt;   was small)
&gt; 
oh, i'd love to tramp around lost in the wilderness, dirty, tired, cold,
hungry, thirsty, and generally uncomfortable, being bitten by bugs, chasing
snakes out of my sleeping bag, and hundreds of miles from civilization.

   dragging my SO along to Baja does not seem likely...
