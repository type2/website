Subject: RE: FS 97 (?) vanagon Campers



I live in San Jose and once had an 82 Country Homes camper.  I've never had
a Westy so can't compare them but the Country Homes did the job.  In 93 I
looked at their EV conversions and wasn't impressed.  I'd also just been to
Europe and seen all of the cool westy conversions.  At the time I visited
Country Homes they would do a conversion on just about any van you wanted. 
I've seen the little Japanese vans done too!  Yea I'm a VW nut, I've no
clue as to the manufacturer of the little van.  If it's not VW, who cares.
Anyway, back on track.  I don't know how they could be selling 97 EV
conversions.  It's my understanding tht VW is only selling the Winnebago
conversions for 97 and nothing else.  As usual I could be wrong.

&gt;I was going through some old bookmarks today and found an ad for a 1997
&gt;Vanagon Camper. They are conversions by Country Homes out of San Jose,
&gt;California. I don't know how they could be 1997 but they are very nice
&gt;setups anyway. Does anybody know anything else about these? Check them
