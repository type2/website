Subject: RE: the all euro engine swap/  80*f by friday

&gt;Unusually warm weather in Phoenix. 80*f  and golfing is expected for the
weekend.
&gt;Just thought you oughta know. A false spring has the plants blooming.
Fears are that if it turns cold and freezes that the plants will be hosed
for the season.  Any vaction time available?  Now would be the time as long
as you don't need a hotel. Superbowl has everything booked.

&gt;&gt;My poor 6cyl Vgon hasn't seen the latest snow yet.  About 26in. fell
&gt;&gt;in the driveway, which drifted to 4 feet, which I then increased to
&gt;&gt;5 feet when I shovelled the roof to keep the gutters from backing up.
&gt;&gt;To clear the driveway I'll need to wait for the thaw, or else do a
&gt;&gt;shovelling fitness video.
