&gt;&gt;What are the differences between the 2.1 and the 1.9 liter Wasserboxer
&gt;&gt;crankcases?  I know the there is not much difference in the heads.
&gt;
&gt;I've recently been told that the 1.9L and 2.1L heads are identical.  Can
&gt;anyone confirm or rebut this?

When i bought a head for my '85(1.9L), I also asked about the price of
heads for my '87(2.1L). I was quoted a much higher price for the 2.1L
heads. I didn't follow up and ask why. Could be he made a mistake looking
at the book, or it could be they are different.
