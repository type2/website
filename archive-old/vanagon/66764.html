Subject:      Propex installation question

I'm installing my Propex heater (finally) under the rear seat and have some
questions about where to route the combustion inlet pipe. I'm routing the
outlet pipe to the edge of the passenger-side rear jack flange. The
instructions that came with the heater say to keep the inlet and outlet
openings 0.5 meters apart and that the openings should face the same direction.

Why do the openings need to face the same direction?

Where is a good place to put the inlet pipe opening?

Thanks,
Mark McCulley
