Volks,
        (Gee, I like that sort of greeting) While getting my '72 ready for
inspection and cleaning up a few wiring problems - the bus is new to me - I
have noticed that the GEN light lights and stays on, unless I have the
headlights on and the high beams on...  I dismantled the dash and found that
the high beam line was attached to a light in the GEN section - OK, I can
deal with that.  I replaced it into the hight beam spot, found the GEN wire
dangling below the dash and since I seem to be one light short of a load,
&quot;stole&quot; the parking light indicator to be used as the GEN light.  Voila, I
can get a proper indication that the alternator is charging, but the high
beam light doesn't seem to work.  After closer examination, it IS working,
the blue bezel is VERY dark.  I noticed while rummaging through all this
wiring that the ground for the GEN pod is separate from the ground in the
rest of the dash...huum.  I guess that this partially explains why the high
beam light worked oppositely from expected, and the dark bezel might explain
why the PO made the change - so the indicator could be seen in daylight.
Thought I would pass this on.
