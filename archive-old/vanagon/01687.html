&gt; 
&gt; If Joel gets tired of tracking the colors of our vans, how about
&gt; the type of hubcaps we all have?!?   :)

Let's see, my '91 GL is white, my hubcaps are nonexistent (alloys)
I have a plain key ring.  Tires/tyres are Michelins.  I have a 
grey dash cover and a black bra.  Anything else?  ;)

Steven
