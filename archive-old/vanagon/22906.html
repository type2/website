Hi,

I am Jim Ferree, I have been on the list for a couple of
months now with only a few postings.  I live in Eastern
PA  and bought an 84 Vanagon 6 months or so ago.  My
friend has one and recommended it.  I like the size and how
it rides, especially the way you ride high up.  I am  thinking
I would like my next car to be a VW rabbit, I would like to get
a GTi, but the diesels sound very practical.

I have been slowly fixing it up, it needed more work than I thought
when I bought it.

Recently, I started looking into the engine, the previous owner
said he rebuilt the engine so I assumed everything was in
good shape.  Well, I found the engine needed a basic tune
up.  New wires, plugs, distributer and rotor.  

I started having poor performance a couple of weeks ago so
I started to look at things.  Anyhow, after replacing the spark
plugs, wire, rotor and distributer cap it was much worse, could
hardly make it up my steep driveway and the engine warmed up
very quickly.  

I also I repaired the intake boot which had a crack in it.
I just used some rubber cement.

Question is what do you think is causing the poor performance.

I need to replace all the cooling system hoses sonn, how
much should I plan on spending.
