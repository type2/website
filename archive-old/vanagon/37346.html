Subject: Pop Top Seal in Vancouver/Victoria

Just calling around - so far I've only found two sources (other than 
dealer $600 ouch!):

BowWow $180 Rear, $ 60 Front

California Imports, $ 99 Rear, $ 36 Front.

Has anyone tried the ones from Calif. Imports? Are they any good, ie: 
do they have steel clips which will rust away &amp; fall apart? I'd like 
to do this before going south, but don't want to put on a seal with 
metal clips if I can avoid it. I've heard there are some with plastic 
clips (?)

Thanks.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
