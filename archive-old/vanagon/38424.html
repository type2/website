&gt;I sent you a message but I'm not sure if it went through so I will reply
&gt;again. I have a 78 TII and I was looking for a camper to fix up. I thought
&gt;I would keep the 78 until the camper was fixed and then sell the 78. I
&gt;think that $700.00 is more than I can spend. Thanks anyway and I hope you
&gt;find a good home for it. :-)

Melissa,
or Dave or anyone
I might be interested in a '71 camper.  Where and what's the story?
I just joined the list a couple days ago.

Thanks
Mike
