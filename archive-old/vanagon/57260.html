Listees,

I am in San Francisco, broken down, before noon, at the beginning of a 500-
mile return trip to home in Southern California.

The vehicle sputtered to a halt after a difficult start which preceded a
trip of about 10 city blocks. It had been parked, on a hill, in light rain,
for two days after a trip of 2,000 miles  The muffler glowed red. After the
exhaust system cooled down, the vehicle started with the same unusual
difficulty of the first start and ran erratically until I shut it down to
avoid a repeat of the glowing muffler condition.

I expect that the difficulty is with a blocked catalytic converter or
blocked muffler.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of situation, and can you
give any suggestions of an approach to solution of the condition?

I intend to call AAA to have the van towed  to Fred's Garage in Redwood
City if a quick fix is not the replacement of either or both of the CC and
muffler. That decision is based on the opinions of members of the list
giving high grades to Fred's Garage.

However, first, I am contacting Kyle for parts availability.

Thanks, 

Tom Hanlon
