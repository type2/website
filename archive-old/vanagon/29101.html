&gt;&gt;80-83 Vanagon (liftgate)   12NG0858X    $19.99
&gt;&gt;84-93 Vanagon (liftgate)   12NG0859N    $19.99
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Shipping for two is $8 to $11 depending on where you are.
&gt;&gt;Witney's number is 312-431-6102.
&gt;
&gt;This is odd, I've always had to specify &quot;with or without rear window wiper&quot;
&gt;when buying these.  It seem that the added weight makes a difference.  I
&gt;wonder which these are for?

I've no idea, Jim-- there was no such indication in Whitney.

A trend I've often seen with &quot;generic&quot; items, is to make one that will
cover several situations. In this case, that might take the form of a
strong strut that will handle the with-wiper hatch, and let it also lift
the no-wiper one more quickly (within the bounds of the struts' internal
damping) more quickly than the OEM ones would.

I'm purely guessing here-- again, WHitney gives no clue, and maybe has
none. If you like, perhaps a call to their &quot;Applications&quot; help line
1-312-431-6129, would turn up someone who knows? (Don't hold your breath)
