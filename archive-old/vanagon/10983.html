Subject: vanagon westy faucet wanted



I dinna have the plastic knob thingy for my 82 westy faucet. The one that
if turned one way, turns on the electric water pump, and if turned the
other way allows &quot;piped in&quot; water to flow. 
Anybody have a spare? Any trades?

Alistair

p.s. I know I should make one myself, but I forget about the damn thing
until camping, and have to ground the little green wire to get any water :(
