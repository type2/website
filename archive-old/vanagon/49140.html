Ark is right about the price of the small motors.  VW wants $575 for the 
blower that mounts on the heater proper.  He's wrong about lasting one 
year, tho'.  My BA6 lasted 15 years before the bearing in the blower 
went south (... maybe I should follow).  I suppose I'd better go pull 
the blower motor and find a bearing replacement soon.  Winter's just 
around the corner. :(
