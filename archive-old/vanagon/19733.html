&gt;Now I don't really remember but don't the 2.1's have the oil
&gt;to water heat exchanger?  I swear on our '86 it was the first
&gt;place I saw such a thing but I easily could be dreaming, was
&gt;probably on the '89 Jetta.

all the waterboxers, 83-91, have such an oil cooler. and i believe it came
on the rabbit engined cars (rabbit, golf, jetta, and scirocco), but i don't
know what years it was on them. the Vanagon oil cooler has a slight problem
in the early years: the cooler-to-engine gasket can crack in extreme cold
and your oil will start leaking. so those of you who live in the snow belt
should check this as your car gets older. there is a replacement gasket that
doesn't have this problem (available at your friendly neighborhood VW dealer).
