&gt; 86 VW 3 door PU, 4WD, syncro 2.1L, excellent in/out,
&gt; 125kms,original paint, very rare $10,900obo
&gt; phone (604) 753-0991
&gt; 
&gt; (That's 10,900 Canadian, so translates to, what, $7,850 US?)
&gt; 
Can you bring this thing into the US, now I know people were
importing them in the late 80's but can you do so now?
