Subject: Re: Rear heater core - solved

&gt;| I was offered a Polo heater by a breakers yard for 20 UK pounds, too small
&gt;| a saving to forego the new part. BTW is the Polo as popular in the USA as
&gt;| it is here?

	Can you describe the Polo? I know a few cars have different names
between here and the UK...
