Subject: Awning info..

Hi Everyone.  I've forgotten who requested the awning information I 
promised, but I also figured that maybe others might be interested as 
well.

Norseman Mfg.,
14545 - 115 Ave.,
Edmonton, Alberta
Canada  T5M 3B6
ph : 403-451-6939


I have a 10' Norseman Apollo awning with VW adapter bracket kit in 
which I paid $455 CDN for the awning, and $39 CDN for the kit in 
1990.

The 10' length is a bonus as you can have the sliding door opened all 
the way, and rain doesn't enter from the front as about 1/3 of the 
front door is covered as well.  The mounting kit is just two brackets 
that go against the raingutter.  No holes are drilled into the body.  
I use small pieces of inner tube to go against the paint, and no 
damage is done to the van with this system.  The original bottom 
brackets are aluminum and will eventually bend.  I've replaced these 
brackets with some 3/16 thick angle iron in the same dimension as the 
original brackets, and they are fine.

The awning itself is great, but you can't regulate how much awning 
you want.  ie.  it's either folded out or fulled extended (about 6' 
from the van).  

Hope this information helps those that may be curious.  BTW, Norseman 
also make a mounting kit for the Eurovan, but holes have to be 
drilled into the body to support the awning :(

Harry.
