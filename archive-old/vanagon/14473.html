Subject:       Re: silly (vw) observation

&gt; Am I the only one that has noticed david BLACK and mike WHITE on 
the VW
&gt; list? Do we have any Grey, Brown, Green, or textures like Tweed? Sorry to
&gt; take the band width with a post like this but hey, my productivity 
stats
&gt; were just too good and I my mind was all tired out from thinking of
&gt; important posts like camping toys and showers.

Wow!  Interesting.  My old girlfriends name was Gray.  We were teased 
insesantly.

I can just imagine what the bandwidth police are going to do when 
they see this thread...
