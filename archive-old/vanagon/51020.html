Subject:       RE: 87 Vanagon - Antifreeze smell


    Replaced mine about 6 mo. ago using a VW oil
    cooler from JC Whitney catalog with approx.
    same dimensions - cost about $45+S&amp;H.
    Required a little modifying of heater cover,
    hose clamps, etc. left out the plug valve ...
    as long as fan isn't running doesn't put out
    much warmth. A nice inexpensive 4-pass
    heat exchanger, the old one was too damn
    efficient anyway. We'll see how it heats
    the cabin this winter.
    
    &quot;If something is to be gained some rules
        must be broken!&quot; - REPTOMAN - 87'S: Wolfwkndr
