Subject: 78 Bus Overheating

I found this cry for help on rec.autos.vw.  Maybe some of you can help him.
I sent him info on how to subscribe to the list. 

Please respond to the address below:

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;        Hopefully someone out there can give me some advice on this.  I 
&gt;have a 78 vw bus which I just put a new engine in.  I thought it was 
&gt;overheating, using a quart of oil per tank of gas, and the compression in
&gt;one 
&gt;of the cylinders had dropped to 90 psi, so I took that as a sign that the 
&gt;engine was going.  I put the new engine in and it seems to be 
&gt;overheating even worse than before.
&gt;
&gt;        I got the engine from GEX international.  I guess it is actually a 
&gt;rebuilt engine, not a new engine.  I replaced the oil cooler at the same
&gt;time, 
&gt;and I have all the shrouding, gaskets, etc. in place.  The engine sounds
&gt;ok 
&gt;when it is running, although not really any better than the old one did 
&gt;(sigh).  There seems to be some missing at the higher RPM's but this goes 
&gt;away once it has warmed up.
&gt;
&gt;        How do I know it is overheating?  I guess I'm not totally sure.  I 
&gt;have a temperature sensor that slides into where the dipstick goes.  The 
&gt;temperature seems to be getting up to 280! F or so before it finally 
&gt;stabilizes.  The supposed temperature range for the oil is 122!F - 158
&gt;!F.  I 
&gt;checked the temperature sensor with boiling water and it seems to be
&gt;correct 
&gt;+/- 10 !F.  I took it into VW and they said that the temperature spec was
&gt;for 
&gt;the oil right after the oil cooler, while my dipstick is in the sump so
&gt;their 
&gt;opinion is that nothing is wrong.  Although they have been very nice I
&gt;get 
&gt;the impression they would much rather be doing routine maintenance on 
&gt;Jetta's than working on my bus.  The oil light also sometimes flashes at
&gt;idle 
&gt;when it has gotten hot.  It has been kind of warm recently  (90! F). 
&gt;Anyway, 
&gt;does anyone know if my engine is overheating?
&gt;
&gt;        I've checked the timing, the plugs, made sure it was getting a spark, 
&gt;replaced the oil filter, checked the injectors are firing, done some
&gt;continuity 
&gt;checking of the fuel injection, looked around for loose hoses, ....  VW
&gt;also 
&gt;took a look at things and told me I hadn't screwed in my cylinder head 
&gt;temperature sensor far enough and said they had to do something to the 
&gt;intake manifold (it wasn't really clear what).
&gt;
&gt;        There are two things I'm a little worried about.  After I had put the 
&gt;engine in and run it a while I found a little piece of paper that said
&gt;with 
&gt;hydrolic lifters you should use 20-50W oil and run it at 2000 rpm for the 
&gt;first five minutes instead of idling it.  I had been using 10-30W oil and 
&gt;idling it.  I'm not sure what bad things this might do.  I've got 20-50W 
&gt;synthetic oil in there now and it still has this overheating problem.
&gt;
&gt;        The second was setting the flywheel end play.  It was kind of a 
&gt;mushy measurement when I was trying to make it.  It seemed to depend an 
&gt;awful lot on how much I pulled on the flywheel what sort of endplay I
&gt;got.  
&gt;When I pulled on it as hard as I could I got a flywheel endplay of about
&gt;7 
&gt;thousanths.  If I pulled on it less I would get 4.
&gt;
&gt;        So I'm not sure what to do.  GEX supposedly has a gaurantee but it 
&gt;doesn't cover damage due to overheating.  So I'm not sure they'll honor
&gt;it if 
&gt;I just drive until something breaks.  Does anyone know if my bus is 
&gt;overheating?  Anyone have any other experiences with GEX?  Any 
&gt;suggestions?  Thanks alot for any help.
&gt;
&gt;                                                Ed Vail
