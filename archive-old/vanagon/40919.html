Subject: Re: Cool Notify found 10 vehicles.

I'm guessing the the default in the web page table is &quot;Automatic 
Transmission&quot;.  As these folks fill out their ad they don't change the 
default.  That, or this is where all the orphans from Autostick to manual 
tranny conversions in Beetles go.

&gt; Alright, I'm just a little curious as to where these classic Volkwagens 
&gt; are getting their automatic transmissions from...
&gt; Unless I'm opening my mouth up more than my brain again trying to figure 
&gt; out what AT stands for in an automobile add.
&gt; I bet these are the same people who are selling their vans because they 
&gt; don't go fast enough. Hint: try second gear. It's not an automatic....
