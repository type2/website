Subject: Re(2): To those '83-'85 Vanagon folks

After reading the other responses I recalled my own exhaust system hassles 
as well as my short list below.

10.     Welds broke on exhaust system brackets (great German metallurgy).  I 
rebuilt the brackets myself (twice) from angle iron.

11.     Broken brackets (10. above) resulted in exhaust pipe break on a 
trip.  Welded on the road at Midas then replaced from the VW junk yard.

12.     Replaced muffler.

Total under $100, no change to my overall conclusion.  CEV


&gt;1984 GL
&gt;127,800 miles
&gt;1.      2 replaced to repacked CV joints at about 60,000 mi.
&gt;2.      2 replaced batteries, bought an alternator but didn't need it
&gt;3.      1 water pump
&gt;4.      blown head gasket at 115,000 mi., dealer rebuild
&gt;5.      dealer rebuilt master and wheel cylinders on brakes at 115,000 mi.
&gt;6.      occassional valve lifter rattling throughout life of vehicle
&gt;7.      repaired ventilation blower switch and heater control cables
&gt;8.      1 plugged fuel filter at 120,000 mi.
&gt;9.      normal hassle with gas overfilling
&gt;
&gt;Overall this has been a very trouble free vehicle with about $2000 of 
repairs in 10 years.
