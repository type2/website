Subject: Trip Report, Colorado

Just got back from a week in the Rockies. I think I have found the US 
town with the most VW bus/ vans per capita. It is Crested Butte, 
Colorado. There are about 1000 year round residents and I saw in one 
day:
1 split
2 Westy Syncros
1 reg Synchro
8 Baywindow Westies
3 Vanagons
5 Vanagon Westies
6 Baywindows
1 Baywindow with a Bug body top welded in the roof.
Some were in various states of dis-repair but overall most looked 
real road worthy. The most noticable feature on most were the custom 
bike and ski racks. I noticed some real interesting installations 
including a Thule roof rack mounted on the rear hatch.
I traveled many other towns in the area and didn't see near as many.
This town was a VW owners heaven!
