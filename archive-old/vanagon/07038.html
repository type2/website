Subject: Re: Berg short-shift for Vgon

... and now I'll also reply to the real reason for Eric Dahlstrom's post:
Berg short-shift isn't magic, just a percentage (25%? 30%?) reduction in the
distance the shift knob moves, whatever it is moving for.  Means a reduction
in perceived slop (movement that doesn't do anything), as well as reduced reach
from gear to gear.  Synchro-beating quick shifts to get my autocross times 
down were not really my agenda with a crochety 13-year-old transmission.
