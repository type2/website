&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 86 Vanagon and the front speakers are blown. The trick is the
&gt;speaker plate has to be flush on the interior door so the window crank can
&gt;work (all other speakers I can find have a raised speaker plate about 1/4
&gt;to 1/2 inches). Any thoughts on replacements?
&gt;

I don't know if they're still available, but on my '84 I had a set of
spacers on the window cranks that extended them out by about 3/4&quot;.
Unfortuanately, I can't remember where I got them.  Perhaps some of the
others have seen these things lately...
