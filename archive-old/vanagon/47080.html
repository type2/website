Subject: Re: Westie Audio Woe

&gt; I thought I was prepared to install a nice CD changer/usual inputs 
&gt; audio system in my Vanagon Westie, when I discovered I was missing a 
&gt; couple pieces, so I visited a high-end auto audio business.  Without 
&gt; going into the diatribe to which I was subjected, I can say there's a 
&gt; well developed body of information/folklore surrounding audio system 
&gt; component selection and installation.  I'd be very interested to hear 
&gt; descriptions of speaker placements that others have found which image 
&gt; well and create a satisfactory &quot;sound stage.&quot;  Apparently the distance 
&gt; from each speaker used in a given channel to the driver's ears must be 
&gt; nearly identical to avoid screwing up that channel's phase 
&gt; relationshiops, unless you install a compensating phase shifter.  That's 
&gt; where my speaker placement ideas failed to measure up to high-end 
&gt; standards and I'm not ready to spend the money required to buy an 
&gt; adjustable &quot;phase shifter&quot; to time-align unequally displaced speakers.  
&gt;   Anyone who's solved this tough dog problem in a Westie or knows anyone 
&gt; I could call who has, please let me know.

I've installed 3 different decent quality CD changer setups in 
various Jettas, which also have similar problems with front/rear 
speaker - listener distances. I've also listened to several very high 
end ($15k+) car audio installs (designed for quality, not thumping 
bass), and always been surprised at how poor a $15k car audio system 
sounds compared to a well chosen $5k home system. 
Getting back to the speaker problem - my conclusion with the 
different Jetta setups was that the most important difference in 
overall sound was the *quality* of the speakers, not their placement. 
The Boston Acoustics stock size speakers my Dad got last year sound 
*far* better than the 'high end' Pioneer models in his old Jetta.
And the Bostons actually cost less than the Pioneer!
Personally, I don't expect a car system to come close to my home 
setup, so I will likely opt for some Bostons in the Westy someday. 
Spending much more money on car audio a waste in my opinion - you're talking 
about a space with lousy acoustics, and 65-75dB ambient noise 
afterall...
