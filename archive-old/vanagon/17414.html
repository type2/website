How about replacing the padding on the seats?  I did this on my '76 
westy, and it made a world of difference.  Very comfy!  Just pulled the 
old covering off (after removing the seats from the bus), trashed the old 
padding, duct-taped new thick fairly stiff foam onto the frames, et 
voila!  new seats!  

BTW, the orig prob was that the seat springs stuck up thru the padding 
(ouch!).  If your springs are really busted up, re-padding will probably 
not do the trick.  JMHO, of course.
