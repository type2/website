Subject: brake adjustment &amp; new pad problem
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 1995 09:27:04 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;A Brandon Smith&quot; &lt;brandys_at_ichips.intel_dot_com&gt;

hello all,
	this weekend i adjusted my brakes and planned to put in new
pads (there was a little squeek from the front right).  when i took
out the pads it was pretty dirty/dusty in there.  i wanted to pull the
'pistons' that push on the pads and give them a thorough cleaning, but
couldn't figure out how.  any advice.  also when i put the new pads in
it was too tight (i did have the bleeder valves open while putting
them in).  they were only slightly thicker than the old ones but they
pressed againts the disk.  are they just the wrong size or did i miss
a step.  i pulled the new pads, cleaned real well again and placed the
old ones back.  i need to bleed them, but the squeek is no longer
there when i break.  any ideas about my new pads?

also when adjusing my rear brakes there was a spot on each tire where
the pad would rub a bit.  is there a way to center them a little
better, the pads are plenty thick enough.

thanks again for any help or advice anyone wants to pass along!!!

take care all,
	brandy
