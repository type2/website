&gt; And I definitely see alot more of
&gt;the competition on the road than I do see of the EV.  

It is because they have a better product on the road.

&gt; VW definately has some marketing problems in the US, thats a given,
&gt; however, it does not have problems in other markets. The T4 van
&gt; which is the EuroVan designation, is already out selling T3s or
&gt; Vanagons, back in the home markets (if you compare units per
&gt; year). So obviously VW is doing something right.

Europeans also buy a lot of Fiats, and you don't see them in our market
anymore.

&gt; So lets get to the meat of the arguement. I have been the proud owner
&gt; of a EuroVan for 15 months now, and have 20k miles on it. We bought
&gt; it because it had more room inside than a Dodge Caravan. Just park 
&gt; them side by side and it doesn't take an Einstein to see which is
&gt; bigger....the EuroVan...by at least 40%. Hell I can even see the 
&gt; top of a Caravan from the driver's seat in the EuroVan.

The size of the van does not make it a better product. Chrysler has 50% if
not more of the market, because of one thing,,,,, a better product.


&gt; Ever try sitting 7 grown adults in a Caravan in anything resembling
&gt; comfort? Face it the caravan is nothing than a shrunk down body
&gt; on a compact car floor pan. You have no real shoulder or leg
&gt; room. Forget about luggage room. If you take 7 people in a 
&gt; caravan, you won't have much room for luggage.

How many times are the vehicles used to carry seven adults, (we know that
they are grown) Caravans have roof racks for luggage.
