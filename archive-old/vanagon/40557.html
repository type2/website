&gt;          Greetings. My names, Mike and I'm up here in Edmonton, Alberta.
&gt; I've wanted a VW van for about 7 years now and I finally have the money to
&gt; buy one (no I havent been saving for that long but I finally graduated ,
&gt; and got a job so I can now afford one).
&gt;         Anyhow, I'd like to get something between a 75 - 85, and fully
&gt; camperized as I plan on making alot of looong trips. Most of the ads in the
&gt; local papers here have people selling a 1979 for about $8500, a '86 for
&gt; $12500, and theres a 83 for $8000.
&gt;         I'm willing to spend around $8000, but I'd like to get something
&gt; quality for that amount. I'm not sure if this is entirely possible but I'm
&gt; hoping....
&gt; 
&gt;         So anyone with a tip on buying a van or any info about vans that
&gt; are for sale please contact me at mike_at_arnold_dot_ca, or if your in Alberta you
&gt; can call me after 6:00 at (403)458-7468. Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt;         As an aside: I'm in the multimedia bus. so if anyone has questions
&gt; or works in the industry as well I'd like to hear from you.
&gt; 
&gt; Some things stink and some things just don't.
&gt;
