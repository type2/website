Jake, Tim, et al...

Gosh, Tim, you seem to be having really rotten luck
w/ your EV.  The symptoms sound like the same thing
that happened w/ a '84 GTI I once had; it'd cut out,
you'd tow it to wherever, and, unbelievably, it'd
start right up like nothing had happened.  One of 
those freaky heat related things I guess.  Anyway,
like you, the dealer started replacing the entire
electronic ignition system and I think the problem
got fixed when they replaced the Hall sender.

Anywho, I too, have little excitement to report on 
the EV transmission front; and this after a couple
years' worth of occaisional spastic clutch-gas-
brake footwork by a couple of owner/drivers.

I finally had to replace my original windshield wiper
inserts last week...does that count?   ;-)
