&gt;I doubt anyone can prove or dispute the Techroline theory, but I have one
&gt;question:
&gt;How do the deposits end up in your oil?

as i understand it, the techron stuff dissolves the carbon deposits ... which
are then carried along in solution by the techron. since the techron was
mixed with your gasoline, it either gets burned up  or blown past the rings
into your oil.

if you run mostly highway miles, less of it goes into the oil.

if you run stop and go city miles (or even worse, idling), more of it gets
into the oil.

now, i can't prove any of this. but i do know and can prove the following:
* the techron bottle label says NO MORE than two bottles of the stuff into
  your gas tank without changing the engine oil.
  (so THEY think it is getting into the oil).
* idling your car WILL put higher amounts of unburned gasoline into your
  engine oil (i've had my engine oil analyzed several times, and the one
  time i 'warmed up' the oil by letting the car idle for 30 minutes, the
  percentage fuel dilution (unburned gas in the oil) was like four times
  higher than the other times (when i had driven 20 miles to heat up the oil).

so my rule of thumb is: anytime you add something to your gas, plan on doing
an oil change before you add it again.
