Subject:       Bus wheel colors

This is primarily for Thom and Clara I'd imagine, but in case anyone 
else has something to say...

I finally found a good set of 15&quot; wheels for my bus and did a swap 
for them.  I'm going to sandblast them and then paint them, but alas:

What color were they originally?  It's a '57 Samba.  My guess would 
be that all wheels came either the color of the top half of the bus, 
or all where white of some nature.

I checked on Thom's pages quickly but got conflicting answers when 
one photo showed a panel with white wheels, and another showed a 
samba with blue wheels (one with rack w/surfboards).

Ideas?
