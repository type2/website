Subject: Lansing, MI 3/3 Buggy Show


Howdy everyone,

        I know a couple of you won't be able to join us (Dave, Judy) but
I'm including you in this mailing so that you can keep in touch with
what's going on.  I'm also posting to the lists so that lurkers and new 
folks can join the fun.

        So!  The Michigan Buggy Builder's show is this coming Sunday, March
3rd at The Lansing Center from 10:30-5:30.  The blurb says:  &quot;over 250
booths of manufacturers' displays, new part dealers, VW toys &amp; literature,
swap meet booths... all indoors... 5 show classes (rail-tub-offroad-
VWstock-VWmodified)... $6 adults, kids under 12 free...  etc.&quot;  I haven't
attended this show myself; last year my daughter &amp; I got about 1/2 way
there when a distributor bearing failure forced us to turn tail &amp; make a
run for home. :( I understand that the swap meet is quite huge and that
there are plenty of the usual stock VW parts for sale along w/ the offraod
stuff. 

        Here's the plan for the caravan.  For those of us in the Ann
Arbor/Plymouth area, we'll meet at the westbound Plymouth Rd. exit (number
41) of highway 23.  Right there is a Big Boy restaurant &amp; a hotel, both of
which are across the street from a gas station (Amoco, I think).  You
can't miss it.  Meet in the parking lot of the Big Boy restaurant at 9am
sharp.  Expect to hit the road by 9:15.  We're meeting here instead of at
Arborland because it'll be the same net driving distance for the A2 folks 
but save about 8 miles for the Plymouth people.  Come &amp; join whether 
you're driving a radiator or not. :)

        We'll make a pit stop at Webberville (a few minutes outside of
Lansing) to pick up Dan Zink, Dan Binks, Jon Adams &amp; his dad.  They'll all
be at Dan Z.'s place which is right off of the highway.  We can take a
peek at about a gazillion Notchback pieces strewn all over Dan Z.'s
garage, then we'll hop right back on the highway &amp; be at Lansing before
you can say &quot;Volkswagenwerk Aetiengesellschaft&quot; 10 times fast.  Well,
at least before *I* can say &quot;Volkswagenwerk Aetiengesellschaft&quot; 10 times 
fast.

        I'll summarize these plans on the not.a.vw.club web page later
today, and I'll update that page if there are any changes.  Any
significant changes will call for another email barrage so that those
folks w/o web access can keep tabs.  The address is: 

        http://www-personal.umich_dot_edu/~gregm/not.a.vw.club

        For folks coming from other parts of Michigan or elsewhere, drop
me a line &amp; we can figure out when/how to meet up.  (Doug, maybe we'll
*finally* be able to catch each other this time!!!) My address is
gregm_at_umich_dot_edu. 

        Let the VW show season begin!  Wooo-hoo!
