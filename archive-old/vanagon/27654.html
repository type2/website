Subject: 1980 Vanagon Gas Tank Remove

I finally got the gas tank out of the bus. It was quite a job. Looks to 
me like it's gonna be a bigger job putting it back! I've made arrangments 
with a local radiator repair shop to acid dip it and coat the inside with 
some sort of gas tank stuff. Several of the rubber gaskets will need to 
be replaced. I need to replace the tank sending unit. You would not 
believe the amount of crap that came out of this tank. It's a wonder the 
damn thing started at all! Questions:
1. The expansion tanks. Anyone know how the hoses that go to the gas tank 
connect/dissconnect from the expansion tanks?
2. The black plastic piece that is on the bus body where the filler neck 
and cap all come together. Anyone know how to remove this thing? It would 
make putting the tank back on much simpler.
3. Are the rubber gaskets that got damaged in removing the tank a dealer 
only part, or does someone make after market pieces?
4. Is anyone living in or around (or passing through) the Indianapolis 
area with knowlege of how to put this thing back together willing to 
trade some hands on experience for some pizza and home brewed beer?
