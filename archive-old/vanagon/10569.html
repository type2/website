&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;You mentioned you've
&gt; &gt; &gt;already replaced the fuel pump so you've got some money in the FI system so
&gt; &gt; &gt;that would be a point in favor of keeping it.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sunk costs are irrelevant. &lt;Sorry, Pat, the econ-geek in me just HAD to say
&gt; &gt; that :) &gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; HOWEVER: FI is definitely a superior feeding mechanism. More power, better
&gt; &gt; response, cooler engine, better mileage, less pollution. Generally fewer
&gt; &gt; problems. Parts are cheap IF you shop at the junk yard.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I remember when in the 70's that most of the back yard mechanics
&gt; condemning FI cause they didn't understand how to work on it.  &quot;Yeah, it's
&gt; really junk&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with you Sami, it's an excellent system, you just have to change 
&gt; your repair tactics.
&gt; 

	In some cases this still seems to be true. VW mechanics we talked
to told us :&quot;FI systems are prone to running lean&quot;; &quot;Parts are
outrageously expensive&quot;; &quot;they are difficult fix without the proper
equipment&quot; and so on. As a  consequence in fixing a problem they tend to
replace parts rather than diagnose and fix the problem.....DC
