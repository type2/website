Subject: Re: Failing Fuel Pump?

I looked at the schematic of my bently manual. If the ECU wants to turn on
the fuel pump it grounds the terminal #3, which is connected to 85 of the relay,
and therefore the relay is activated. The pump should be buzzing.

Also, this terminal #3 also grounds all 4 injectors together with the pump
relay. If the ECU can not ground the #3 terminal, not only the pump won't
buzz, all injectors won't feed engin gas either.

Check the big ECU connector for dirty/oxidized contacts, especially the #3
pin. In case the ECU is indeed not activating the pump relay and all 4 injectors
then you have a real problem now. You may want to open up the ECU box and trace
the #3 pin wire into the box. If the wire is driven by a transistor, instead of
an IC, then it's likely the transistor has been over loaded/heated and 
determined to quit. If true then replacing the transistor is likely to fix all. 

There should be a 1 - 2 second buzz from the fuel pump after turning on the
ignition switch (to the 1st stop, not cranking engine yet). This is a quick
check of the fuel pump operation.

- check terminal 86 of fuel pump relay for battery voltage; check terminal
  30 for battery voltage.
- remove fuel pump relay and check terminal 85 (in socket) for ground from
  3 of ECU while cranking.
  if not: check continuity of wire from terminal 85 of fuel pump relay holder
  to terminal 3 of ECU. if continuity is ok, replace ECU.

hope it helps.
