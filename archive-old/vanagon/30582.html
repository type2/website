I saw that Bill had no working dash lights so I thought I would pass 
along my experience with fixing mine.  I spent too much time thinking 
about it and not enough time fixing it.  It really was easy.  Except 
for rounded and rusted bolts I have found most repairs on my bus to be
quite easy.  It was built to last longer than the payments so 
maintenance things are even easier to fix.  This is for a '71 bus.

First off, suspect the headlight switch.  Mine was fried.  At least 
the 69b connection was.  I think this is the number.  Anyway, look in 
your Bentley.  It is the one that controls those lights and allows you
to turn them up or down.  I installed a junkyard replacement only to 
find that it too had that connection fried.  I then t'ed off of the 
park lights connection. :)  So, my dashlights are full bright when the 
lights are on.  Better than none until I can afford a new switch.

Next, to the bulbs.  On mine there were two.  They are at about 10 
o'clock and 4 o'clock on the speedo dial.  Both can be reached without
tools.  Even my big hands fit into there.  Just come up from the left 
for one and up from the right for the other.  If you are patient you 
can reach across from the left and get them both.  The bulbs are in a 
socket that comes out with a quarter turn.  One wire runs from the 
switch to the first bulb and then on to the second one.  Simple.  The 
bulb then pulls straight out of the socket.  These are 1.2 watt bulbs.
My FLAPS had one that fit, but was a little too tight.  I tried the VW
dealer and they had them.  Strange.  I bought four.  Part of that fix 
anything anywhere thing I have going on.  Also, the socket grounds to 
something in there when you are putting it back together.  I cleaned 
up the connection with a blade but they still required some jiggling 
and futzing to get them to ground and light.  Now, my dash is bright 
and easy to read.  I hope this helps someone with the same problem.
