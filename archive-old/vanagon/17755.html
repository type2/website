Subject: bodega update


Bodega Bay Dunes        June 2-4th weekend

Here's who's arriving when and with what.  Groupings in the first section 
indicate 2 vehicles sharing a campsite.  If there is a &quot;?&quot; somewhere in the 
list associated with your name, I'd like to know please your estimated time of 
arrival, and/or which dish you wish to bring to the potluck.  To make things 
simpler, I suggest bringing something in the same category to both nights.  So 
if you are for example signed up for salad, you might want to bring macaroni 
salad the first nite and potato salad the second (this seemed to work out well 
at the last gathering).  We have two brave, early-rising souls who have 
volunteered to take care of Sat. and Sun. morning breakfasts (Jeff Schneiter 
and Al Knoll respectively and respectfully.  Note:  please all of you bring 
your own eating/cooking utensils (like forks, plates, cups, pots, serving 
things, etc.) plus your own drinks (like I need to mention that to this group; 
ha!)
