Hi Dan,

Matters of the VW Van are sacred -- you should do whatever makes you
feel more comfortable.  The bottomline is how good you'll feel when
you drive it...

In my case, there's too much of an engineer in me, and I feel most
comfortable when I ahdere to that most basic principle of engineering
:-)

     KISS  (Keep It Simple and Stupid)

Good luck,
Cetin

 &gt; Hi Cetin-
 &gt; 
 &gt; Ken Lewis came up with a suggestion i think i'll use... installing a 
 &gt; 110v relay, activated by the line cord and controlling the charge 
 &gt; output.  simple and 100% effective.

I have to object:  This is _not_ simple, it is more
complicated. However, it will work.

 &gt; 
 &gt; i agree that 3mA isn't much draw but i WANT zero, just for the 
 &gt; principal of the matter.  and if the van ever *didn't* start, i would 
 &gt; be wondering if that 1% i lost over the last 4 days could've made the 
 &gt; difference.  :)
