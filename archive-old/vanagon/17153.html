Subject: dashboard fan?

Not worth it.  I had one on the '82 diesel Westy, I got rid of it.
Shakes, rattles, and does not put out any breeze that's worthwhile.

I'd like to find out how good those electrically powered top-mounted
A/C units in the J.C. Whitney Catalog are.  They cost less than $400.00
and look like they can be made to fit on the top front where they left the
space to tie down stuff, etc..
