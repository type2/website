S &gt;&gt;How would I spot a pancake motor vs. an upright motor if i was looking
S &gt;&gt;at the crank case broken down and the cylinders lying on
S &gt;&gt;a table next to it?
S &gt; 
S &gt; 
S &gt;I believe the fuel pump mount is different, and possibly generator
S &gt;mount too. Both mount on top for the upright-fan bug and pre-72 bus

Oh, god yes. The fuel pump is mounted underneith and to the front of the 
engine. It is supposed to be an engine-out job to change it. I managed
to change it by prying the hell out of the nearby tinwork....
