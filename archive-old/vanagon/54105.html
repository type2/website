Subject: Syncro seal

When getting a price from the dealer for a rear seal (crankshaft pulley) I
was told that the Sycro uses a different seal. Evidently they use a two part
seal that cost about $180 for the set, compared to a regular Vanagon seal
that runs about $15. He had no explaination for the difference. Has anyone
had experience with this and could a regular seal be used.
This is a VW reman. engine, what are the odds that the PO (probably
unknowingly) installed a regular engine, can I tell from the engine number?
