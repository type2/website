Subject: VW paint chips

This one is too cool, if anyone has posted it before I'm sorry but
way too cool.  Has scanned pictures of the pages of a late 50's
VW paint mixing manual, with 60's and some 70's updates including
color chip and full mixing instructions, way, way, neat.

Takes forever to load the scanned pages of course.

John
