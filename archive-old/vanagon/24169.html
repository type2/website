Subject: DC-MD-VA COOKOUT DIRECTIONS


OK, here they are!

Directions to Chris Chubb's house:

&gt;From I-495 between I-395 and the Wodrow Wilson Bridge:

Route 1 South to a right turn onto Huntington Ave (West).

At the first light, turn left onto Biscayne. 
First left onto Glendale Terr. 
About halfway down on the right.
2321 Glendale Terr.

Park anywhere but in the apartment lot across the street.

You can e-mail either of us with questions about the cookout, but send
questions about the directions to Chris (cchubb_at_ida_dot_org), because I've never
been to his place.
