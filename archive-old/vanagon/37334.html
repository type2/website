Subject: proposed posting title formats


List Members,

Here's a suggestion that may make keyword searching of the archives more 
productive in the future.  What I'm proposing is that for common message 
types, that there be a standard subject line format.  for example, for 
reports on repair procedures, have a standard subject line heading of, 
'repair procedure:  &lt;description&gt;', or for a list member's report about 
service recieved at a dealer or other shop, 'shop report:  &lt;description&gt;'. 
 Something along these lines may not only make archive searches more 
productive, but also help people screen their e-mail.

Other standard messages could include:
'problem diagnosis, help: &lt;whatever your problem is&gt;'
'discussion:  &lt;blah, blah, blah&gt;'
etc., etc., etc.

if this is a waste of time, just flame me.....

later,

relax and spin
