I recall that there was a recent posting from someone who had
purchased some electric seat heaters across the pond for a
reasonable price.  While looking through one of the many catalogs
I get this time of year I came across this:

================================================================
	Lifestyle Fascination -- 800-669-0987

    Winter driving bliss is a warm seat!

It's a raw, cold morning, you jump in the car, you head for
work and, wonder of wonders -- instead of getting icy-seat
chilblains -- you are basking in a delightfully gentle warmth
that starts at the chilly bottom and works itself clear up to
a smile of utter satisfaction!

This automatic heated cushion adds a driving luxury to your
car that even the $100,000 limos don't have.  Just plug it into
your lighter socket.  When you get in the driver's seat, a
pressure switch turns on the cushion, reaches comfortable heat
in 60 seconds -- long before your car's heating system reacts!

For early morning commutes, moms delivering children to school,
long distance drivers, this is the greatest gift of pure comfort
you could give.  There are no hot spots, heat is evenly distributed
over the entire surface.  A thumb wheel switch lets you disconnect
the seat completely.  Current draw is a low 2.5 amps, protected
by a fuse.  Your battery is protected because, when you leave the
seat, the pressure switch automatically turns the cushion off.

Cushion is made of good-looking, automotive quality fabric.  A
special stabilizer tuck holds the cushion in place.  Made in USA.

#EAH147 - Automatic Heated Comfort Cushion  $29.95

Typos are probably mine.  No web page listed.
