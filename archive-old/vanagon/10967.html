Subject: ANOTHER coolant bleeder scheme
Date: Wed, 1 Feb 1995 08:23:22 -0800 (PST)

So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 
&gt; Take a generic windshield washer pump from Kmart, one with hose
&gt; barbs for the in/out.  Hook a section of tubing from the 'out'
&gt; nipple and put it on the barb on the pressure cap.  There is a
&gt; one-way valve on the cap that allows flow of coolant INTO the
&gt; reservoir but not OUT until 16 psi is reached.  Hook another section
&gt; of tubing on the 'in' side of the pump and stick that in a jug of anti-freeze. 
&gt; 12V is readily available at the big wire on the alternator.  Follow
&gt; the coolant bleeding procedure pretty much by the book except now
&gt; you can leave the engine off (after running the engine to collect
&gt; air at the normal high spots) and pressurize the cooling system with
&gt; a continual supply of antifreeze!  Bleeding works like magic!!

Great tip Dan.  Are you posi-lutely sure you're getting it all bled
though?  I wonder if there are any gotcha's in this procedure like
somewhere in the system the pressure isn't quite getting the all of
the trapped air in the coolant moving.  I'd think running the engine
first would take care of that, but I'm not sure.

&gt; One caution.  Those pumps, I believe, can develop high pressure (tho 
&gt; low volume so one has quite a bit of time to work with) so don't 
&gt; leave it running while you go for a smoke.  Use your noodle.

Good point.  I was thinkin' of using my 12V portable tire pump but it's
probably too much pressure?

&gt; On a sadder note:
&gt; Due to the high volume of (albiet wonderful) mail, I am switching to 

Too bad Dan.  You put in alot of useful info.  My problem is similar
to yours, but I try to work around it by catching up on mail when I
first come in (before 8:00AM which is the real time work is suppose
to start at Intel).  Then, I can read the mail as it trickles in
occasionally and respond later if no one else has.  Usually it
gets responded to well enough that I don't bother with a post.
I also get a chance to read some when I get back from lunch.
After dinner, I sometimes catch-up then too.  (Linda fixes dinner
and then I do the dishes.)  I guess you can say I'm addicted too. ;)
But is there anything else in life besides this mailing list? :) 
Well, I do have to go out and get my hands dirty working on the 
car too. ;p
