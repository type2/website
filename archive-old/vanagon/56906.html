&gt;Whilst under my truck last week changing a coolant sensor I noticed an
&gt;ominous &quot;rust bubble&quot; on the elbow of the coolant pipe coming from the
&gt;water pump to the Thermostat/coolant distribution housing....  I decided 
&gt;that it was caused by  its location, leading surface in direction of 
&gt;travel. Repeated exposure to road debris had worn away any protection and
&gt;facilitated the formation of iron oxide. Solution; flick off those
&gt;flakes with screw driver in yonder hand! (Insert nasty wrong answer
&gt;buzzer sound from Jeopardy). The green liquid flowed like beer on
&gt;St.Patty's Day...
&gt;Check It Out!

Your experience is not isolated.  On the '89 Westy I have for sale, I 
noticed precisely the same thing.  Fearing exactly what has happened to 
you, I resisted the temptation to poke at it, and coughed up the bucks for 
that new &quot;dealer only&quot; pipe. (I had visions of somebody buying the camper 
and getting a mile down the road only to lose all their coolant and blow up 
the motor.)  Haven't replaced it yet, but I'm willing to bet that a 
screwdriver would go right through it.  Certainly a tow waiting to happen.
