&gt;  &gt; The reasoning is simple: Remember
&gt;  &gt; the old adage: if you locked a 100 monkeys in a room with typewriters
&gt;  &gt; that eventually they would type out the entire range of Shakespearean
&gt;  &gt; sonnets?  Well by the same logic 400 of us (or whatever the heck the
&gt;  &gt; numbers are) are bound to collectively produce something intelligent
&gt;  &gt; eventually. 
&gt; 
&gt; Um, no, sorry.  Look at Usenet: going strong for almost 15 years with hundreds 
&gt; of thousands of monkeys and hasn't produced anything intelligent yet!
