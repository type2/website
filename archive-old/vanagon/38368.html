&gt; When did a bus have a sunroof (except a deluxe).  In the latest issue of =
&gt; HotVWs on page 74, there is a 64 Standard(Kombi?) w/ a sunroof w/ no =
&gt; smaller windows like a Deluxe.  Is this factory?

yup :)

  What models had this =
&gt; as an option.  

as thom says this was available optionally on all models cept' pickups and 
prolly ambulances

I thought that the sunroof was an option only on the =
&gt; Deluxe version.

nope

sounds like th bus you describe is model 235, which is the same as the model bus 
that ia m hoping to score :)

anybody wanna buy my 65' panel??
