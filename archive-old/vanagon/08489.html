&gt; 
&gt; &gt; hours of running? Has anyone got experience CA smogging a dual-port big-bore
&gt; &gt; when a single-port 1600 was stock? Can anyone recomend a shop for
&gt; &gt; air-cooled machine work in the South Bay?
&gt; 
   Ellsworth Brothers in Mountain View used to have a good reputation for 
   machine work on VW air-cooleds. They have expanded to become Ellsworth
   Automotive - whether or not their machine shop is as good as it used to
   be, I don't know. Their phone number is 415 968 7884.
