Ditto! for California, only you can add NOX testing too! for SMOG2

The Catalytic Converter ONLY works when it's HOT!

A No-No in Cal. Although this change in the physical structure of your
emission system produces less emissions, you'll fail the mehanical portion
of the inspection. All original smog abatement equipment MUST be present,
in it's original place.
