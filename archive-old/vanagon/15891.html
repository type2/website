	I've taken a trip with 6 other adults in a Dodge Caravan and I
can tell you that there is no comparison to a Bus or Vanagon. Yes,
the Chry-co object has more power, but it wallows and rolls, and more
important, it just isn't very comfortable. Its not as big or as tall
and you sure know it in the back seat. It IS more powerful, and more
'car-like' when lightly loaded. It hasn't got the interior space
or that nice VW feel (subjective I know). 
	The minivan sells really well, but so do all kinds of
things I wouldn't buy anyway.

	Bill
