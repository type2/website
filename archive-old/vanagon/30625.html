&gt; Also, there's voltage present at the tip of the soldering iron (if I
&gt; remember correctly), so there's always the possibility of damaging
&gt; sensitive components that are normally static sensitive.  I haven't
&gt; tested the tip of my soldering iron personally, so don't know if
&gt; this is true or not.

When I resoldered my idle ECU, I used a grounded tip soldering iron. 
The cord has a 3 wire plug that includes a ground wire to the tip. I 
bought it at radio shack for around $10 I think.
