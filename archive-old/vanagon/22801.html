&gt;Does anyone know what the early-60's dormobile
&gt;conversion is supposed to be like? i.e. where
&gt;cooker &amp; sink go, how many seats in back etc.

there is a &quot;book&quot; published by Brooklands which has articles from old
magazines about the 1949-1967 buses, and in it are pictures of early
Dormobile and Devon campers. it might provide the info you need.
the book is a thin softcover one, more like a magazine, really. costs
about $17 US. it should be available in the UK as well (since it is
published there!) :)
