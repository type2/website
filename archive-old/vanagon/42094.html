Subject: Re: Austin Vee Dub bad motor

&gt;the motor is still under warranty, but he had called them, and is dubious
&gt;about getting any help from that part !
&gt;
&gt;Any comments on Austin Vee Dub from listmembers in Texas?

        Uhh, yeah. They're pretty much the only game in town and they know
it. They are *very* proud of thier parts-I've paid more for used parts from
them than I paid for new ones in CA. I do my own work, so can't say much
for the quality of thiers. The 2 times I've gotten bad parts from the used
section they were cool about the exchange though. Also, thier prices for
rebuilds and whatnot seem a bit high to my CA tastes. Competition really
helps drive down those prices. Just my $.02...

Peace,
