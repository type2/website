Hmmm.  All this talk of making fiberglass splash pans is giving me 
ideas.

I have a good pan, I haven't put it on the bus yet because I'm not
done detailing the underbelly.

If I get a changce, I'll try to knock one off from mine, and let y'all
know how it goes.

First I'll have to clean my pan up a bit and paint it, so maybe by next
weekend I'll be ready to try.  I already have the fiberglass materials
laying around, but I think I'll wanna use industrial resin instead of
the clear surboard resin.  And 8oz instead of 4oz.
