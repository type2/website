Subject: I shift; bus don't go...

Coming home for lunch today, I turned off the major street onto my own, 
downshifted and released the clutch petal, only to hear a little clicking 
and feel a little coasting. Rev, Rev, Coast, Coast.

My bus has an uncanny knack for not leaving me stranded. I coasted to my
neighbor's house, where he was out in the yard listening to the
boom-a-boom-a-boom-boom-boom of his 8000 giga-amp stereo and I motioned in
Hillbilly sign language that maybe he could help me push, which he gladly 
did. I think we both have experience in pushing. He seemed to be very 
skilled; if there were an Olympic event, we might be contenders.

Other than installing a stereo like my neighbor's and turning the speakers
backwards, any ideas on what to check out first to get the bus going?

Note: I have had some pretty stiff shifting lately and in the absense of
any better advice, I'll probably start by examining the linkage near the
tranny--I've noticed this is very sloppy and replacement parts are very
near the top of my &quot;things to buy for the bus&quot; list. This may not be
fruitful, though, as the bus feels as though she's moving into gear, even
though she's not moving when I release the clutch.  She's never popped out
of gear before (in any gear), so I'm hoping this is something simple and 
inexpensive.

Any ideas greatly appreciated! Joe
