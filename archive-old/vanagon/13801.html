Well, I'm bring my bus, AND camping in a tent, so that's ok!

&gt;   Will we be teased incessantly for the entire weekend if we show up in a
&gt;   &lt;gag, retch&gt; Oldsmobile station wagon?

Well, it IS a lot like a bus. Carries a lot, gets bad gas mileage, etc.

&gt;   Is anyone thinking of bringing mountain bikes?

Yes! I'm coming with my buddy Al and we'll certainly bring ours.

&gt;   How stupid would I be if I was to pretend I never saw those bits of metal,
&gt;   put fresh oil and filter on my bus and take it Red Rock anyway &lt;round trip
&gt;   750 miles&gt;?

Depends on how big the chunks are. If they're smaller than say, a piston, 
then it's probably ok. 'Spose one of us could bring a spare engine. I 
only have a spare transmission. I could bring it, but I figured a 1/4 
cord of firewood would be more useful.

And it looks like Otto (the '59 pickup, for those of you keeping score at
home) WILL be going. The refurbished gas tank is in, and after a few minor
tweeks, he should be ready to roll!
