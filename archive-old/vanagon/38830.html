Don't sound good.  Its probably the rings and a rebuild is the answer.  See
John Muir's book.

&gt;My '66 has an engine in it of questionable lineage.
&gt;
&gt;At any rate, compression in #3 is very low, like 50, where all the others
&gt;are pretty reasonable, around 95 - 105.
&gt;
&gt;I ran compressed air into the cylinder, and checked to see where it cam out.
&gt;(Cylinder was in firing position)
&gt;
&gt;There appeared to be a draft coming out the exhaust pipe (uhoh), and perhaps
&gt;a hint (I could be wrong about this one) coming out the carb.
&gt;
&gt;I also took the valve cover off and there appeared to be a hint of air coming
&gt;out of the exhaust pushrod tube.
&gt;
&gt;I have a feeling none of the above is good:-}
&gt;
&gt;What I was wondering, is given the symptoms, would a replacement head go a
&gt;good distance to solving some of these problems?  Are heads usually replaced in
&gt;pairs?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;..Markus
