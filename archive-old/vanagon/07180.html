Subject: Re: Clutch problems: 1st, 2nd, ...

No Stuart, the brakes are on a completely different system, although they also
use brake fluid/hydraulic fluid to operate. The clutch system uses a master
cylinder that is connected to the clutch pedal. I'm not sure on the vanagon
just what the setup is, but most automotive systems are similar. This master
cylinder compresses the fluid down the line to the slave cylinder which pushes
itself on the clutch operating arm which disengages the clutch. If there's
fluid dripping out of the side of the slave cylinder then I suspect the seal
inside is shot, and needs to be redone. At this point you can either get a
remanufactered slave cylinder or rebuild the one you have with a rebuild kit.
Either way, it's time a money. Just how much I'm not sure. The last rebuild I
did was for a Nissan, and the kit was 37 dollars. This was for a rebuild kit
which included the seal etc. Let me know how it works out. :)
