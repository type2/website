Subject: Re: Drain Plug? What's a Drain Plug?

Many of you drain-plugless vanagonites may already know this, but Bob
Hoover wisely suggested that I attach a powerful magnet or a series of
magnets to the bottom of the drain plate to catch any metal shavings that
might be wandering around in my oil. A definite good idea. Bob noted that
you can attach them with a drop of superglue if you need to.

BTW, I'm assuming the outside of the plate would be the better location
than the inside, for relatively obvious reasons. 8) Joe

'71 drain-plugless campmobile (in search of supermagnet).
