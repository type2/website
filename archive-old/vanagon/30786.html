Subject: So looong, Farewelllll

The semester's over, my grades are in, and I'm about to embark on one of
those fine perqs of academic life: a sabbatical.  While I'll be in and out,
I figured that I'd better unsubscribe until I'm more in than out.

Thanks, y'all, 'specially Unca Joel, for all yer help.  Back in the spring!
If you're in the upper-midwest &amp; see a blue Westy w/Iowa plates &amp; Simpson
College decal in the back window, wave!
