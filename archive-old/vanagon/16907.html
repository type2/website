&gt;&gt; PS for people interested in exotica, I am now using a high speed exhaust
&gt;&gt; analyser and it is _way_ cool.  I get an instant readout of rich or lean
&gt;&gt; mixture, if I had this six or seven engines ago (not all mine) I would have
&gt;&gt; saved at least a couple of those engines.  It is really helpful, and I think
&gt;&gt; will enable me to get the most life out of this engine.

&gt;Eugene,
&gt;	How much would something like this cost?  Can you tell us who
&gt;makes such a beast for the common consumer?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

&gt;From Gene Berg, around $250 for the bung you braze to the collector and the
readout.

Eug,
