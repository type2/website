&gt; I have one Vanagon with power steering and two without.  I don't really

  Yes check out Parts Place and Bus boys. They  can get you the parts.

&gt; it too.  How do you feel?  Any other Syncros without, or is mine unique? 
&gt; 
      Where are you located? are you in the USA? I have a bad sterring 
      rack on my Syncro, and have a manual rack that I can put in, but
      was conserned that the extra weight and 4 wheel drive would make it 
      a problem to steer.

&gt; it only needed to sell these in America where you haveta have automatic/power
&gt; steering/power brakes/blah, blah, blah?  Should we just convert them when 
&gt; there's any trouble?  Is it even possible to convert to plain steering?
&gt; 
  I have just keep the fluid filled. I found it leaks more with PS fluid
  instead of ATF. Also the more you drive the less it leaks.
