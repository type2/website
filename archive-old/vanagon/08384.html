Ah yes, the Kombi:  From what I've read (&amp; own) the Kombi was a general 
utility vehicle, with either station wagon seats or no seats at all (not 
to be confused with the Panel Van).  Someone put a camper interior in 
mine.

&gt; 
&gt; I second this idea.  I still don't know what a Kombi is (yes, you may all
&gt; gasp at my ignorance).  How about it?  Can someone type up a dictionary for
&gt; us VW novices?  What are the different engine types?  body types?  What is
&gt; that pesky EGR box anyway? etc....
