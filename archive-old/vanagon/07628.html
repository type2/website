&gt;Whitney's doesn't have a 3 window unit for a '75, how about
&gt;others?
You might try &quot;Pop Top Campers&quot;.  They advertise in LiMBO's newsletter and
also HVW.  AND they have a BBS dedicated to poptop campers.  They claim
lowest prices anywhere and from what I remember they weren't too bad.  But
I've never ordered anything from them so I can't really give much of an
opinion.  Anyway, their number is (800)248-2719 or via modem at (310)457-3033.
They're in Malibu, CA.
