Subject: Re: 87 water pump

It most likely will not occur instantaneously.  My water pump just went out on
my 87, and symptoms were.  Gradual grinding noise from the rotor pump as the
bearings go to hell.  I think this can be accelerated by over tightening the
v-belts.  You will also notice small (then gradually increasing) amounts of
water leaking out of the shaft of the pump.  Mine went all to hell and coolant
was leaking out of the shaft and spraying all over the inside of the engine
compartment due to spinning of the rotor.

When it goes it will be real obvious, and if you are observant and astute, will
see it coming, miles before it totally goes.  Just watch your coolant levels,
listen for grinding at the pump, and watch for coolant leaks when parked.

Procedure for replacing is in the archives if you wanna do it yourself.  I
think a new german pump will be around $70 if you shop around.  I think the job
isn't supposed to be too bad ~ 4-6 hours if you've never done it before, and I
haven't, so I can't really say.

I didn't do my own because I was four thousand miles away from home at the
time.  I got an Italian pump ($110) installed by a reputable mechanic in
Portland, OR (I live in Raleigh, NC) for about $230.  If you have AC it will
cost a lot more because of the labor.

Hope that helps.

&gt; Just wondering---
&gt;
&gt; My 87 GL has 131K miles on it now.  Seems like a water pump should go
&gt; out soon.  The 84 deisel Rabbit I used to have blew its around 135K.  It
&gt; was very obvious too, steam blew up and water leaked everywhere under
&gt; it.  Will it be as obvious on the Vanagon?  What will it's symptoms be
&gt; so that I don't damage my engine accidently?
&gt;
