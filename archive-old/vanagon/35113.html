Hmmm, good question...

I was driving home from Bodega Bay last night- about 65 mph (84 
vanagon GL). All the sudden -- hesitation, bucking and so on. Stick in 
nuetral, rev. engine a couple of times, back to normal. 5 miles 
later, same thing. Happened all the way until I got back to SF. In 
the city driving, no problem at all (Even up Gough! &gt;HUGE grade&lt;)

Happened last year when I drove across US. and again when I moved 
from Chicago last september. 

So I tested my injector Ohms.(Disconntected cable from the &quot;Brain&quot; 
and tested the corresponding connectors) Injector 3 and 4 were at 15.8 and 15.9 
respectively. Injectors 1 and 2 were 16.2 and 16.4 respectively.  
Bentley says that they all should be around 16.2 to 16.4. Could it be 
injectos 3 and 4 causing the problem?
