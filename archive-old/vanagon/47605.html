Subject: Electrical Problems in 80 Westfalia

I have an 80 Westfalia that is having some electrical problems in the
camper portion of the van...

The fuse that controls the water pump for the sink keeps blowing. I have
replaced the water pump and now my electronic water level gauge / battery
condition meter is not working and the pump won't pump.  (I know this is vague)
but has anybody had this problem???

If I need to replace the electronic gauge (the dancing lights on the face 
plate of the cooker / sink, does anybody have a source who can rebuild
these (VW in Canada has no more)?

Thanks for the help
