Subject: WD 40 as starter fluid

Someone inquired about WD 40 as a starter fluid. I don't know about that per
se, but I can vouche for it as a superlative propellant in a potato cannon.
As a matter of fact, I found that out by accident after trying starter fluid
first. It wouldn't ignite but it did seem to gum up the plastic threads in
the pipe so I used WD40 to clean and lubricate the threads before they
&quot;melted&quot;. Absent mindedly,I flicked the sparker and...goodbye eyebrows! 

I conclude that it is surprisingly volatile and that if there were a VW
involved this could have been a candidate for the idiot thread.
