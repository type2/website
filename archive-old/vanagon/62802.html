Subject: Where to put VDO gauges
Date: Mon, 14 Jul 97 19:31:02 -0500
From: &quot;Bob O'Shaughnessy&quot; &lt;oshaug_at_infinet_dot_com&gt;



     I'm going to install at least two VDO gauges in my project van (oil 
press and tach, maybe oil temp) and am a bit perplexed about where to 
install them. 
     The only place on the dash that seems suitable would be on top of 
the present instrument cluster.  Unfortunately, wiring three gauges there 
would make removing the cover a minor nightmare.

     Any suggestions?
