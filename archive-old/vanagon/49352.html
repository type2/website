&gt;Here's the translated price list for the Audi 5 installation kit
&gt;from Axel Winkler, provided mostly so that you can see what's

Although Kennedy Engineered Products doesn't list the Audi engine as a 
conversion kit, when I asked they said sure, can do.  Their kits are 
typically $520 for adapter plate and flywheel.  Lots more parts needed. Nice 
thing about the Audi engine is that the starter is on the engine, not trans, 
so you don't need a beefed up VW unit.  Audi engine is about 21.5&quot; long from 
face to pulleys, will just fit.  VW-SouthAfrica do this as a standard 
installation, why not also check what you need from them, Winkler was not 
cheap, maybe the $2000US would get you a used 5spd/Audi trans straight from 
SA, and the exhaust too?  The SA vanagon rear deck is 10 or 15cm. higher. 
Used factory stuff maybe cheaper than aftermarket, and more reliable.  some 
thoughts, tim
