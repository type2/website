Rodney,


&gt;One person recommended &quot;the hydraulic jack from Sears&quot;, but then, can
&gt;I use the original jack points?  If not, where would I place the jack?

_IMHO_I would concur with that suggstion for a nice floor jack from Sears.
Place the jack up near the lateral frame member (as opposed to the jacking
point on the outside of the car, if you jack there w/ a hydraulkic jack you
will crush the jacking point tres quickly) with a good chunk (say 2 feet
long) of 2' x 6&quot; wood sanwiched between the jack and the frame member. Once
you start jacking the wood keeps the frame from getting scratched up and
also helps disipate the weight over the of the car over a greater area
thereby reducing the possible of damaging the frame.

I would also recommend the use of jack stands as a backup as I wouldn't
trust my life to the hydraulic jack
