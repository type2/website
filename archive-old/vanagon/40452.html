Rolling into town this morning, already at the light, Two vans in
a row. Minus the cute, it was a real nice double cab pulling a 
trailer which is a same era Westfalia pop-top. Cut right behind the door,and
a super job of closing the front. I almost died.
That was because I'm in the intersection gawking at buses instead
of driving. I wish now I had run him down for a look. The situation
tho, required I make a fast getaway.                    west
