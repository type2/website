&gt; Stroke me a little and I'll be there in Grendel, even if I have to push the

	As you have probably already heard, &quot;Sure, it rains in the Northwest, but
it's a Dry rain!&quot;  I don't know what that means but I've heard it for
years.  Thought I'd pass it along.  Sound like you need a tarp?
	Did you ever get the info you needed about that packard bell? 
Shelton(home of state prison) is the booneys, I'm sure it is hard to find
anything.  Are you having to make trips to Olyimpia(state capital) for parts? 
I am a neophite to VW's so I'm pretty sure you don't want me to look for
parts for you at Seattle junk yards, but...Wait a minute isn't that how 
you ended up in this mess? 

        Good luck.
