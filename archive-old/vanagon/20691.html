So harmon seaver says:
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a source for locking gas caps for a '73 bus?
&gt; 

While on a road trip a few years ago in my '74 hardtop camper, I 
neglected to put the gas cap back on at one of the gas stations.  I
found a locking replacement at a auto parts store.  So I think you
shouldn't have too much trouble finding one that fits.
