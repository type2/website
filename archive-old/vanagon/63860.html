Subject: Free diesel oil pump pickup tube.
Date: Thu, 14 Aug 97 21:29:56 EDT


I changed my diesel oil pump some time ago, and was just
about to pitch the old one when it occured to me that
someone doing an engine swap might want it to get
the special diesel pickup tube (saves buying a
$120 oil pump when swapping in a golf or jetta engine)

So how to get? Email me. Then I will reply to the first
respondent, who gets to mail me a stamped and self addressed
box (US mail please). The weight of the pump is 3lbs.
box needs to be 5x5x10 inches (mail it to me flattened in
a letter)
