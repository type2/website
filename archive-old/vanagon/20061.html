Well,  I've got Matt Goike and David Mancuso interested...
Maybe the problem is just that I havn't come up with a good name like
they did out by the Pacific with GNATT...

How about Campout At Turkey Point Of Ontario?   CATPOO

C'mon Frank C... You're already halfway there. Are ya interested?

With Joel's list of who's where... I can hound you all.   :)
Good work Joel.
