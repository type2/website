Hi all,
I've been wondering about something, and I figure that this group can =
help if anyone can. I've got a '76 Campmobile (&quot;The Loaf&quot;) and =
I'm wondering if there are such things as Diesel 4x4 Campmobiles.=20

I'd consider joining the ranks of the water-cooled if I could find such =
a beast. Having had 3 diesel Rabbits, I love the engines, and if there's =
a comparable van engine, I'd be interested in finding one, especially if =
it's a 4x4.=20

Since the main motivation (other than having a place to install the =
ham radio gear) for buying a Campmobile was to camp at the beach when =
I surf, the prospect of a 4x4 is also really appealing. I understand =
the potential problems with the high center-of-gravity, but I've heard =
that there are 4x4 Vanagons, which leads me to think that there are =
4x4 Campmobiles/Westfalias/whatevers.

Any clues?
