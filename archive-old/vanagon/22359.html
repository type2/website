Subject: Re: Center Console

&gt;Has anyone thought of or designed an above the head console for storage,
&gt;tapes, lights, tools, etc? This would fit above the driver and front
&gt;passenger.

I have an old AC unit up in front.  It doesn't work any more, so I was thinking
that maybe I could gut it and transform it into an overhead storage console.
Is it
possible to remove the &quot;guts&quot; of the AC without screwing up the plastic shell?

&gt;JC WHitney has one that that fits most vans and looks a lot like something
&gt;you see in aircraft with the airflow vents and directed lights.....too
&gt;expensive though!

Sounds cool...sort of what I'd like to do with the AC unit.
