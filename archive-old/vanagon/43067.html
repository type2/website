Subject: Re: 91 Vanagon, oil pressure anomaly

In a message dated 96-05-28 10:26:38 EDT, you write:

&gt;Right to the problem: Every time I exit the freeway, the oil pressure 
&gt;light and buzzer (you know, the one that triples your heart rate in a 
&gt;split second) come on. In every instance, I have immediately pulled over, 
&gt;stopped the engine, and checked the oil (always fine). I turn the engine 
&gt;on again after a minute or two and everything is fine (no light, no 
&gt;buzzer). Is this my vans way of telling me it doesn't want to leave the 
&gt;freeway? 8-) Any advise of information is appreciated.

What's happening is that while driving on the freeway, the oil heats up to
operating temperature ant thins out.  But driving at relatively high RPMs on
the freeway keeps the oil pressure sufficiently high.  When coming down the
off-ramp the RPMs drop and so does the oil pressure.  Normally it doesn't
drop low enough to trip the pressure switch, but in your case it does.

Why is this happening?  Many have pointed to certain brands (Fram
specifically) of oil filters causing these problems and have reported a
return to normal when using the VW brand filter.  This is an inexpensive and
easy first check.  After that, it could be a defective oil pressure switch,
alarm circuit, or even bearings worn so much that the hot oil just can't be
kept at sufficient pressure at low engine speeds.

Good luck,
