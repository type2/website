Don,

Thanks for writing up your experince changing the EV front wheel bearing.

I'm curious though about the special tool you used to hold up the upper
control arm.....did you make it yourself (always my favorite solution!)?
Can you describe it?  I'm sure there's EV front end work in my future.

Thanks,
