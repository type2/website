I had the same type of problem with a sliding door hinge.  You probably had
rust and corrosion in there.  When you heat something, be careful.  It will
dry out the metal and make it extremely susceptible to more corrosion and
more of the same problems.  You should take the pedal out and run sandpaper
or emery cloth around the corroded part, then curl it into a tube and run it
thru the hole.  Re-lube the parts and this should cure your problem for a
much longer time than just heating it.  You're asking for more of the same if
you dont....-------

I dont like to torch thing with paint on it.  I have  allergies to paint,
 wet or burnt, and my nose closes up.  :(  Besides, it messes up the paint,
which ccan be a hassle if im keeping the bus, as opposed to a junkyard rig.
 I fully agree with the lube concept.  Grease is good.  Oil is good too.
 Lube is lovely.   But torch can save a lot of time and effort.   :)

Pyromaniacally yours,  Clara
