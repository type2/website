Subject: Re: Euro headlight.


&gt;
&gt;The light I refer to fits the full vertical size of the upper grille. There
&gt;are no bigger lights which fit into this place, not on my knowledge. All
&gt;police and ambulance vans have same headlights I have on my own. No special
&gt;options for government purposes.

Well, look again ;).  I saw these headlights in Berlin, and I am absolutely
positive that they were much bigger than any standard lights.  And
remember, I also saw standard lights on vans while I was there so I could
make immeadiate comparisons.  These were like none I have seen before on
either continent!

Now I could be wrong about it being police, it might've been  military vans
or maybe federal police (if you have such a thing, the Italians do).  There
is a small chance that I had the presence of mind to snap a few photos, but
all my photos are in New York, and I'm in Colorado right now.  (if you're
not familiar with the US, thats about 2300 miles [3680 km] away).

So, all I can say is to keep your eyes open, and try and spot these
vehicles.  If you do, please see what you can find out.

I should be in Europe this summer, and will definately go to Germany.  I'll
take pictures if I spot anything and post them 'net.

By the way, I usually start my travels in Amsterdam.  Are there any good
junk yards in your area?  ;-).

And finally, have you been to the Vanagon factory in Hannover?  The same
year I was in Berlin, I took the tour in Wolfsburg.

Thanks,

James
