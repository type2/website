Subject: RE: Battery for Vanagon


&gt; When
&gt;camping, I use the battery for running the stereo, and some
&gt;lights, usually taking the battery to it's limit. So it does get
&gt;drained regularly.

Sorry, Steve, for coming up with another question instead of an answer.
Most car batteries are lead-acid, of course. But weren't there once some
nickel-cadmium car batteries? The advantage here, of course, is that
it doesn't hurt a NiCd battery when you run it all the way down flat,
while it does hurt a lead-acid type to do that.

Anyone know of such a battery, in the size for a car battery?
