Not true: leaded is available in many states, including (at least)
Washington. It sells for much less than regular unleaded. An anachronism,
and presumably based on investments on oil companies in refineries that are
expensive to convert. But you certainly don't want to fill your tank with
what they call 'Regular' in Washington when they mean regular unleaded. So
the restrictor still makes sense (unless you never leave your home state).
