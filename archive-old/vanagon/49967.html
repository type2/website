Subject: F.S. Alloy wheels for Van/bus PICTURES!!

Hey all, Listmember Sami Dakhlia was kind enough ( thanks Sami ! ) to scan these
pics I sent him of the wheels I'm selling.  Once again, they are 15&quot; and fit all
Vanagons and buses down to '71.
Pics are at:

hit auto images download if they don't show up right away.
