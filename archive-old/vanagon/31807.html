&gt;Volks,
&gt;	I've been wanting to install a vented propane heater in my bus for
&gt;some time.  One thing I am wondering about though.  Those of you that
&gt;have installed them, are you using the stock propane tank?  The little
&gt;dinky one?  My '73 Safare has a slightly larger tank than the Westy (3
&gt;gallons) but I don't think I could get more than two nights worth of

stock tank is around 10 lbs., 3 gallons, I believe

I have found that a 10 lb, 3 gallon tank lasts for 3 nights, running a 5,000
btu heater all night, plus all the dinner/coffee cooking for those 3 nights.

Accordingly, I installed a 2nd tank on the other side of the vehicle in the
same location (there's room for it) so now I have enough capacity for about
a week, running the heater each night.

&gt;heat out of it.  If I'm camping in the snow in the boonies for a week,
&gt;how the heck am I gonna get propane?  Has anyone installed a larger tank
&gt;in their bus?  I was thinking about installing another small tank on the
&gt;other side of the bus, opposite the existing one, for maybe 4 nights
&gt;worth of heat, but even this is not ideal.  I'd like to have 1-2 weeks
&gt;worth of heat.  What to do?

I feel I have adequate propane supply. However, note that: 

1. You can make up plumbing so on an emergency basis, after the two big
tanks are dry, you can use those small 1 lb throw away propane cylendars
they sell. Adapters are available for this.

2. Adventurewagon when they sold Vanagon Campers of their own making fitted
oversize horizontal tanks. Perhaps this is what you already have, or you
could call the dude (Fort Bragg, Ca) and ask him what size fits.
