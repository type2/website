Hi Dan et al

Dan Herbert said:
&gt; 
&gt; I want to share with the list my correspondence with VWOA 
&gt; about the deficient heating/defrosting systems in my new 
&gt; Eurovan Winnebago camper.
&gt; 
&gt; You can judge for yourself the quality of the response.

I hate to include so much original posting in my replies, but I wanted
to leave as much of the kind weasel words of VW intact.

All I see is a big &quot;thank you for sharing.&quot;  No commitment to *fix*
anything.  No commitment at all; just &quot;effort to provide reliable
products and services.&quot;

Much like the response I got when my '86 Jetta GLI lost 5th gear, due
to a circlip retainer not installed at the factory, causing a hole to
be machined in the top of my transmission.  An obvious design flaw that
cost me a transmission.

Most owners never saw that, as it takes about 100K miles to get a hole
in your tranny, but then, I guess most of VWoA's Eurovan customers
don't live in such cold climates.

Good luck to you!
