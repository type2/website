Subject:      ADMIN Test Messages Admonishment

Please don't send test messages to large lists.  It's a very rude thing to do
to over 700 people.  If you think there's something wrong with your mailer or
your subscription, use a
QUERY VANAGON

message sent to listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu to test your mailer and your
subscription instead of mailing to 700+ people.

Thank You.
