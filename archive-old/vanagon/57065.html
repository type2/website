Subject: 87 Syncro Blown CV Joint

Hello-

Well my worst fears were realized when I tried to remove my from left axle
shaft.  The cage for the outer driver side CV joint is cracked.  I called at
least 30 parts places this morning and found only 2 that had the joint.  One
price $450.00 and the other $250.00 and in stock.  Local VW dealer $275.00
and $85.00 core charge.  I've been told that it is cheaper to buy a rebuilt
half shaft complete with both CV's, but no one around here has one.  I did
find several people that were willing to rebuild mine, but i got a little
concerned when they indicated that they had never heard of a syncro.  One
parts place said they could get the entire assembly for $100.00.  Come to
find out it was a rebuilt unit for the rear not front.

My question is - does anyone know of a place where I can purchase the entire
rebuilt shaft.  A new shaft from VW is $1,100.00.  The second is - I am
having some trouble removing the joint from the shaft even though the circlip
has been removed.  Is the shaft toasted?? or does the joint need to be
pressed off??

Thanks for the help

Mike
