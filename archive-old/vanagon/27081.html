Subject: FS: 79 Westfalia


There is a westfalia for sale around the corner, asking price, &quot;firm&quot; 
$2500.  It has a rebuild with 100 miles on it.  It has formica wood 
grain cabinetry, and lime/olive green plaid upholstery.  The body is 
straight.  It has rust underneath almost every window.  I didn't 
check wheel wells or rocker panels.  While my search 
for the &quot;perfect&quot; camper doesn't include the westfalia set up, I'm 
wondering what this kind of rust, and the amount of it, should do to the 
price, assuming everything else in the drive train, electrics, body, and 
suspension is in decent working order.  

(I sold my 66 camper in 1983 for $75.  Blown engine, spring seats, broken 
frame on bed.  Of all decisions I've ever made, that one ranks pretty close 
to &quot;stupid&quot;)
