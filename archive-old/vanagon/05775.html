Subject: Re: '72 Bus Starter Problems


&gt;Howdy Volks,
&gt;
&gt;My '72 Westy, Stimpy, is having problems starting.  When I get in and crank
&gt;the starter, it sounds like it or somepart of it is spinning, without
&gt;engaging the flywheel.  If I put Stimpy in gear, and rock it forward and
&gt;back (just a inch or two), it will then start.  I tested the battery at 
&gt;the local FLAPS, but the result only said &quot;charge and re-test.&quot;  I went 
&gt;ahead and bought a new battery (the old one was over 5 years old), put it
&gt;in when I got home, and the exact same thing happens.  The generator light
&gt;doesn't come on when I'm driving, and I don't notice any other electrical
&gt;problems.  Any ideas?  I did a cursory examination of the starter/solenoid,
&gt;and didn't notice anything out-of-the-ordinary.  The solenoid was replaced
&gt;16 months ago, but I suspect a different problem, since the symptoms are
&gt;different (Bad solenoid, nothing happens.  This time _something_ is 
&gt;happening)

	Make sure your starter bolts are tight.. if they come loose it
doesn't engage the flywheel (but it spins real good).  Worn teeth also
inhibit flywheel enagement.  i decided to replace mine when i put the new
engine in because the worn teeth and crummy solenoid made starting a
somewhat chancy venture.

CHUCK
