So Ron Lussier says:
&gt; Listen to Christa and Tobin being interviewed this morning on Canadian
&gt; Broadcasting Corp., 9:00am-9:15 local time.  Then write or fax the station
&gt; to tell them that you enjoyed the interview, so that they interview us
&gt; again when we return!

I don't think I can put my antenna up that high....  :)
