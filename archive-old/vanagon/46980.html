Subject: Radiator/Coolant Switch

  Recently there has been some talk of installing a manually operated switch
to bring on the coolant fan before the limit closes. I'd be interested in
hearing from anyone who may of done this . I'd like to know how and where you
mounted the switch , the routing of the wiring, switch type, etc.. I guess
basically the whole kit n kaboddle, if you like you can respond to me
directly or just post it on the list.
        
           Thanks, Kris
