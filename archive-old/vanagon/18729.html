Them heat boxes are mysterious things.  They _do_ help the bus run cooler 
(on a stock motor and with all the hoses hooked up--with all those rust 
holes, the cooling power of the fan will be reduced).  Plus, you may 
actually need heat, even in a Grand Junction summer (!) though mostly for 
defrosting purposes.  I encountered snow at a mere 9000 ft. (La Veta 
pass, near Alamosa/Walsenburg) in Southern Colo. just last week (!).

&gt; &gt;     Ramona's heater boxes are all rotted out. I could replace them when I
&gt; &gt; overhaul the engine, but do I really HAVE to?? Does it affect her cooling
&gt; &gt; system at all to be sans-heat? Will I really need it when I'm driving
&gt; &gt; cross-country in August?? Yes? No? Hmm.
&gt; 
&gt; As I recall you're coming out to Colorado, Grand Junction wasn't it?  Not 
&gt; that it's going to make a _whole_lot_ of difference but you'll need those 
&gt; heater boxes when December rolls around.  Maybe sooner.
