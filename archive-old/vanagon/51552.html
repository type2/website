&gt; 'Happy upgrade' forces sale of the following:
&gt;           Flash Metallic Silver 1990 Syncro Westfalia
&gt;           in Asheville, NC (a great place to visit upon purchase!):

I've been up to Asheville to check out this Syncro, and it's in fine
shape.  Runs strong, drives well, and looks good.  Interior is almost
like new.  I can't scrape together the bread for it, but if you can
and you're looking for a Syncro Westie, this is well worth a look.

(And Jonah is a very nice fellow, too. :-)
