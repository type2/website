I decided to put AMC heads on my Westy at 138,000. I am now at 173,000
with no problems. I did hand lap the seats as you point out because I
heard about this problem elsewhere. These are the heads I coated with
ceramic coating to try to beat the corrosion. The test goes on.
    

&gt;    Leonard was very thorough in pointing out the
&gt; deficiencies on AMC verses a proper rebuild.
   
 What problems did he think the AMC hesds have? One thing I like about
AMC heads is they are thicker in the sparkplug area. It seems to me that
that would make the head more rigid so that when you torque it down the
pressure will be more evenly distributed on the metal head gasket than
with the stock heads that are thinner and less rigid. I guess this
thickness would also fix the cracking problem on the outside that you
described.
