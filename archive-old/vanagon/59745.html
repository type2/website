If you want a brand new factory Vanagon/Transporter owner's manual, you can
order one from your local VW dealer.  This is a general coverage manual
which covers all models for a specific year, and there are supplements
available for the campers, etc. but not for the Single or Double Cab.  I
ordered one for my Double Cab this way, and put it in my glove box in a
plastic zip-lock bag.  I don't remember the price, it was in Cdn$ a couple
of years age anyway.  Here are the Part #'s:

1985-	WSA 562 25521
1986-	WSA 562 25721
1987-	WSA 871 56225 821
