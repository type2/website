Subject:  parts place inc

well, i said i'd give an update on my luck with a refund from these people,
and here's the status at the end of week one.  sent the package monday,
they should have received it wednesday.  called today (friday) just to
make sure they got it.  they did, along with the (polite) note i included
which expressed my lack of appreciation of receiving brazilian parts
when i was assured they were sending german, and of getting the
wrong parts sent to me.  seems like they haven't given it much attention. 
the person on the phone is nice enough, but can't seem to tell me if the
owner will for sure approve a cash refund (even though i paid cash),
and if so, when it will arrive.  frustating, since they have all the money i
currently own.  i will be cautious in future dealings with these folks due
to their apparent lack of organization.  just thought i'd share.  am i being
unreasonable?  i figure it's their screw-up, and i should have my $
immediately.  thanks for listening.
