&gt;I called Norcold(800-543-1219) today to get the ignitor part. Norcold gave
&gt;me a
&gt;number 800-333-1682 for thier parts warehouse. The part is $47.50 and not in
&gt;stock. It will take at least 2 weeks to get the part. I have next week
&gt;off and was planning to replace the part then. So much for that idea. Has
&gt;anyone
&gt;actually tried to further insulate the existing wire. How did you do it? Heat
&gt;shrink tubing or something like that?
&gt;

Shouldnt' it be under warranty?

&gt;I haven't seen anyone putting thier fride model numbers up for inspection.
&gt;My fridge model is Norcold 3163G (serial #001662cmgyg4). Is that what you
&gt;guys have?
&gt;
My fridge is Norcold Model #3136G Serial #007144CMGYF5
my furnace is Suburban Model #125 Serial #950303223

I've never had occasion to run the furnace at any significant altitude,
or at any extreme of temperature - typically PNW winter weather is 40F and
wet. It sure keeps us toasty in that weather!
The furnace is kind of weird - if it doesn't ignite you have to shut if off
and wait for the fan to cycle off - then restart it. This is some sort of
safety feature to prevent gas buildup inside the combustion chamber. (I
recall this happening one in my Vanagon - it was kinda scary to hear a
'boom' coming out the exhaust vent!)

As I mentioned previously, I've had the fridge at altitudes between 6000ft
and 7000ft and it worked fine on propane. I run it on electric when driving.

let us know if you find out anything specific - especially if there is
something related to serial number.
