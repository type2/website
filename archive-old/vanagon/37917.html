So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; DON'T LUG THE ENGINE UNDER LOAD - take hills in lower gears at high RPM
&gt; DON'T FLOOR IT - except for brief periods.  Use 3/4 throttle and downshift.
&gt; LISTEN FOR PINGING - if you hear ANY at all ease up NOW or your heads
&gt; 	will eat themslves alive.  Take measures to correct the pinging 
&gt; 	asap (like higher octane gas, retard timing, lower compression).
&gt; BUY AND INSTALL GAUGES - It's one of those things where you can spend a
&gt; 	little now, or a lot later.

One more tip:

Don't follow the Schwarzemiester down any questionable dirt roads(?).  ;)
