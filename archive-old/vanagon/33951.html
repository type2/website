Subject: party for schwarze!


Honorable listvolk-brother Dave Schwarze will be coming to the SF bay area
this coming weekend, and I've told him he's welcome to crash here.  Then, of
course, I got to thinking that this is a perfect opportunity for yet another
vanagon party/gathering, so am slating one for this coming Saturday evening,
Feb. 3rd, at my house, let's say at 7 p.m.  

Affirmatives please RSVP, and when you do, I'll e-mail you directions to
my house.  Guess we can do potluck as usual - lemme know.....
