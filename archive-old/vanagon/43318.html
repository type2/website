Subject: Slide-out &quot;rooms&quot; and other tricks

Joel Walker wrote &quot;then, in the back of the book, he shows pictures of 
getting ready to travel again ... in what looks like a high-roof diesel 
Vanagon with slide-out &quot;room&quot; on the drivers side. :)&quot;
  I think it woud be fun and interesting to hear and possibly see GIFs of 
Vanagons, especially Westys &amp; Syncros, that have some really radical or 
inovative modifications.  Just proposed possible pipe dreams would be 
nice mind candy.
  Let me get it started.  I hadn't considered the slide-out room 
approach, which I'd guess would use rails just behind the front seat drop 
and just forward of the rear wheel housing, but I've discussed another 
approach with someone who's built some wonderful curiosities.  What gave 
me the idea, was having seen photos of how he extended a long bed Datsun 
pick-up truck box and later a Dodge Maxi Van.
  The entire rear end is artfully cut from the forward section, but very 
close to the start of the rear curvature.  Then, a &quot;bone yard&quot; donor is 
similarly cut, but much further forward.  Finally, the longer donor rear 
section is attached to the original.  I understand this kind of 
attachment technique is well perfected common stuff in the auto rebuilder 
trade.  Support structure lenghening is comparitively simple.  The result 
is a vehicle that can drag the ground more easily and which swings its 
extended tail wider than a stocker when it turns, but has a lot more 
space without &quot;punching a bigger hole in the air.&quot;  Steady state highway 
power requirement differences are genuinely trivial, and since stock 
Vanagons don't have much power to spare, this is especially appropriate. 
 We've all seen the proportion of energy used overcoming wind drag 
losses.
  In the case of the Dodge Maxi Van, the cuts were arranged so that it 
looked like the factory had simply made it longer, including an extra 
window with the same spacing as forward windows.  That was my impression. 
It was vehicle about which people might say &quot;I didn't know they made one 
like that.&quot;  It was clealy different, but didn't jump out at you as 
obviously not a manufacturer's special edition.  Let's see, a permenant 
accordian wall porta-potti room just aft of the closet where natural air 
flows would tend to pull it into to rear air dump if a dryer vent type 
check valve looverd opening were created there.  Could you live with 
that?  
  Another change I'm considering, is minor: installing a 48&quot; by 48&quot; 
square roof lite.  This one has double wall construction, trapping some 
dead air space, and a large upward protruding round bubble.  The lite is 
white rather than clear, so privacy would be unaffected, but the light 
admitted by these is wonderful.  I'm looking at integrated structural 
rigidity, about 30 pounds topside, and very slight additional drag.  The 
curves are truely gentle and setting it there appears very pleasing from 
the outside.  This may happen.  But then I couldn't have a mural of a 
blue white sky with clouds painted on the inside roof.  &quot;If you come to a 
fork in the road, take it.&quot;
  Share some pipe dreams.  Life isn't a dress rehersal. (no quotes needed 
there, that one's original with me, though I've seen it in print after 
years of propogating this great truth)
