Subject: larger tires under the front

&lt;snip&gt;
 I found that the new 27x8.5 Dunlop Radial Rover RVs I had on the spare was
rubbing on the lower hose to the raditor.  It seems that this was causing a
small leak from (I am guessing) the union of that lower hose to the radiator.
Has anyone with oversized tires run into this problem?
