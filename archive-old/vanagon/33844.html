Subject: Neat web site... well kind of!


Hi folks,

Those of you with Web access should check out this web site called 
&quot;Jerque du Jour&quot;. It's at http://www.got_dot_net/~egallant/the_road.html. 
It shows snap shots of offending cars that frustrate the authors daily 
commute to no end.

It's a cool site. However, there is a section called repeat offenders 
that slanders our beloved auto.

P.S. I'm sure he has no gripe against the Vanagon
