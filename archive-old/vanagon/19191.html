&gt; Hi John. I received the camper as part of a motorcycle purchase. Yes, I still
&gt; have it. The body is in GREAT shape, the interior has some minor rips in the
&gt; back seat but overall is in good shape. The top which pops up and the bed
&gt; underneath it is in GREAT shape along with the sink, closet, floor etc. The
&gt; engine has been pulled already because the owner was going to work on it or buy
&gt; a rebuilt one...I don't know. I live in Cupertino. Let me know, Steve
&gt; 

Oops, I wrote the guy asking questions before I noticed the CA
area code, SOMEBODY PLEASE BUY THIS THING, It's got to be to
good to pass.
