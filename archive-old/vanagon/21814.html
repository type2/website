Subject: Re: location for august campout?

the time off i'll go anyway, no matter where we'll do it...
                ciao,
                        Gregor \ FESTUS
                         &gt;
&gt; Voting time!  Here's the suggestions which tricked in as to camp locations for
&gt; our August 25-27 campout (in quotes are listmembers comments about the places).
&gt;  Please let me know of your preferences, or I will assume any of the options
&gt; are fine with you:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Richardson Grove State Park (3 possible campsites: Huckelberry, Madrone,
&gt; and Oak Flat).  These are described in &quot; The Complete Guide to California
&gt; Camping&quot; by Tom Stienstra, pp 75-76 as follows:  &quot;Set in a giant grove of
&gt; costal redwoods, the tallest trees in the world.  Good hiking, sight-seeing,
&gt; but often crowded by tourists in summer months.  Good base camp in wintermonths
&gt; for steelhead fishing in the South Fork of Eel River. Reservations a must in
&gt; summer months through MISTIX by phoning (800) 446-7275.  $10 per night fee.
&gt; Number for Richardson Grove State Park at (707) 946-2311.&quot;
&gt; One of our member reported that the campground he saw there looked &quot;really
&gt; nice - with access to the river for sun bathing or swimming.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 2.  Makericher (sp?) campground, north of Ft. Bragg.
&gt;
&gt; 3.  Standish Hickey campground in the redwoods.
&gt;
&gt; 4.  Trinity Alps (near Weaverville):  &quot;looks a lot like the german alps
&gt; actually, and is not touristy at all - not that we care either way as long as
&gt; we have buses and booze...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 5.  Big Lagoon, about 30 minutes north of Eureka.  This is near Patrick's
&gt; Point State Park, near Agate Beach.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; NOW:  =====&gt;  OK, volks - which one calls to you?
