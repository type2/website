&gt; &quot;I found the VW Bus Custom Handbood&quot; at Classis Motorbooks (~$16+$4 for
&gt; shipping) thanks to Joel's lead.  The number is 800/826-6600.  I'll post
&gt; my impression of this book when I get it, which should be in two to four
&gt; weeks they say.

I found this book at a local bookstore here in town and bought it a few
months ago.  I quite enjoyed it.  A lot of lowriders with neon paintjobs,
but also a lot of good technical and helpful stuff.

for the price it was a fun purchase, not too many vanagons though...

peace,

Steve
