 The driver (20ish male) told me that everything was fine, and

&gt;when they stall, it's necessary to pull over and wait awhile before
&gt;restarting.  Aha...

&gt;He was very confident about this VW knowledge (maybe he read it in his
&gt;owner's manual??!) and I really didn't wish to engage in a roadside
&gt;discussion of maintainence/repair since he seemed to have accepted the fact
&gt;that his car was behaving normally.

Worldly Rusty suggests that maybe he / they weren't really broken down but
were up to other things... I will spare the list the possibilities that
immediately pop into the  mindset that I had during my early to mid twenties.
