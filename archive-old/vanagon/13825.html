&gt;   The question is now &quot;what to do&quot;? I was looking through the Rocky Mountain
&gt;   Motorworks catalog and it looks to me like it is cheaper to buy a GEX
&gt;   rebuilt than it is to buy all the parts to do it yourself &lt;?!&gt; Why is this?
&gt;

Dave, I had this question too.  I figured that it must be their volume
that gets them those prices.  They certainly pay less than we do for 
parts and I am sure they long ago paid for their machining equipment. 
Sounds good to me.  I am in the middle of saving my pennies for same. 
I can live with myself for this one as long as I am saving money.  Jim
