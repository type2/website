Subject:      plastic model Vanagon Camper :)

ok, folks. i got my shipment of Revell/Monogram Volkswagen Van Camper
today. :)  $9.95. yup, that's NINE dollars and ninety-five cents. plus
shipping. i don't see how they are selling them that cheap, but they are. :)

who's &quot;they&quot;?? (i thought you'd never ask!)

Hobby Heaven               (616) 453-1094      10-6 M-F, 10-5 Sat, Eastern
P.O. Box 3229              (616) 791-9295 FAX                      Time Zone
Grand Rapids, MI 49501

it is a 1/24th scale model, of a Vanagon Camper. the kit itself shows an
air-cooled, 1980-1983 model, but the decals included have a fakey grill
decal you can put on to make it into a later model water-cooled. except that
the air intake grills in the rear are definitely the early stamped metal
(not the screwed on plastic grills). and it has round headlights (not the
squared ones of 86-91).

it has a full camper interior, and a top that can be modeled popped up or
locked down for driving. you can even make the sliding door where it will
work.

it's molded in white plastic, so it'll be easy to paint it any color you
choose. 7-1/4 inches long,

released by Revell-Montogram, Inc. distributed by Revell AG, Germany. tires
molded in Japan. :)  cement and paint NOT included. Skill Level 2 (Moderate).

having built several of these from the old days (back when they were released
in conjunction with Magnum P.I. television show), i can tell you that it
appears to be identical with those old kits. this kit, however, does NOT have
any extra pieces that would allow you to make it into a non-camper van (i.e.,
the only roof available is the camper pop-top.

but anyway, it is DEFINITELY worth $10. :)  i got three of them. now i can
build a Syncro Camper and a high-roof Adventurewagen-type camper. i'm sure
i'll figure out something to do with the other one. :)  maybe make it into
a single-cab pickup or something. :)

anyway, i'm happy with it and the service of the Hobby Heaven. go gettum,
folks.
