Subject: another cool URL!


Since so many of you like my &quot;switch&quot; site find for looking up
number (and addresses) of listed people in any city in the 
US (btw, the yellow pages are there, too, I discovered), I decided
to post future cool URL's as I learn about them.  Can you tell
I've only recently been able to use Netscape at home?  :)

Anyway, for those of you who like to act as your own travel agent,
here's a URL for flight information and reservations:
