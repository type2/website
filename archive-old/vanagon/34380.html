&gt;     Details.._dot_deatils.._dot_details! :) I considered driving it, but after

&gt;     &gt;&gt;Glad the Autotrain idea sounds good, though you ought to ask
&gt;     &gt;&gt;about the maximum allowable vehicle height...I think those
&gt;     &gt;&gt;railcars are enclosed.

Your diesel is equipped with an oil to water oil cooler.  These often fail
internally and allow the oil into the cooling system  This is usual cause of
this condition.  Check this thouroughly before condeming engine or head or
head gasket.  2.1L vanagons have same stupid set-up.
