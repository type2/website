Hello Derek,

Nice to hear from you, I've already been on your Web page and that's
actually with your help that I'm on the list now. But don't kill anybody for
a 16&quot; wheeler, you'll be able to convert yours I'm sure :) I got mine not
long ago (last may) and I don't know yet about the final gear ratio. First
time somebody ask me for this. I'll try to do my best and give you the info.
