Hey there Listees

The valves in my 83.5 waterboxer tend to be really loud on cold start-up.  I
realize that my hydrolic lifters need to be pressurized with oil for them to
correctly &quot;lift&quot; the rocker armes to the correct height, however the valves
are loud quite abit on start-up and sometimes needs to be driven at least
half an hour before they quiet down.  One thing that might be contributing
(although I am kind of skeptical that it would be) is that I noticed a slow
oil leak from one of the pushrod tubes.  I am not quite sure how the
pressurized oil is conveyed through the tubes and don't know if a leak in the
middle of the tube could drain the lifters abnormally fast (like overnight!).
 I was running 15W-40 weight during the summer but now have 10W-40 for the
colder days.  I would appriciate any advice, things I could do or if it is
just the way it is!   Thanks ahead of time.
