Subject: 1979 'Falia goes on the block (Atlanta, GA area)



I'm here in Auburn with a '79 Westfalia, which with the arrival of our 
fourth child we don't use as much as I'd like. After only a half a 
dozen camping trips this summer, I want it to find a good home. 
Some details, in case you're interested. 

The good: 

* It's my daily driver, and is therefore quite reliable
* Car is native to west Texas and is almost rust free (see below)
* I've had it four years, and it had sat for a year or so before then.
  I replaced all the hoses, new points/plugs, and put in a new clutch
  disk and plate before driving it here from Lubbock Texas two years ago. No
  real engine work since then (other than change oil/filter every 3k, and 
  check/adjust timing and new plugs about 6 months ago).  Compression was
  level and around 115 when I bought the bus. 
* The odometer says 120K and I'm inclined to believe it. 
* The FI is in fine shape, with no unusual symptoms and good power.
* I just put in a new clutch cable.
* The four tires are new radials 
* There is no under-body rust, the car having lived out its life in 
  West Texas and now here.  The only rust I know about is some starting
  under the front windshield seal, and this _does_ need to be paid attention
  to soon.
* The bus came with the fridge, but didn't have the sink/stove unit.
  I found one in reasonably good cosmetic shape (the veneer is cracked
  in several places) and installed it, and now all systems (water, stove,
  fridge) work well.
* I replaced the seal for the pop-top about two years ago. 
* The canvas top is in excellent condition.
* I even have the original kids' &quot;hammock&quot; to sling over the front seats.
* There was some damage in the sliding door, and I had this repaired and 
  the van repainted (a nice navy blue--no original &quot;Mexican beige&quot; for me)
  a year ago.  They did a pretty good job.
* The interior is good, although the original scotch plaid seats are a bit
  worn. 
* New front disk pads about two months ago.
* The van was a/c'd originally, but the PO removed it.  I have the compressor
  and the hoses and under-car evaporators are there, but no under-dash
  blower.

If I keep it, I'll pay attention to:

* replacing the push rod tube seals on the passenger side.  There's a small
  leak (again, after replacing them two years ago)
* Doing the rear brake shoes (they probably need it)
* Rebuild the starter or install a piggy-back solenoid.  Occasionally after
  long trips in hot weather I have to roll under there with a screwdriver to
  free the thing up.  
* Fix the rust under the windshield and install a new seal.

If I were to sell it, I'd need around $2750.  This seems pretty 
reasonable and well below other prices I've seen on the list, but could 
also be negotiated I guess.  

If you're interested, give me a call (334 844-2892 work, 334 826-7375 
home) or an e-mail reply.  This is my third Volks and second bus, and I 
really like the '79--the last year of the old loaf style body, and no 
valve adjustment every three months--a real advantage on the maintenance 
front from my standpoint.

What will I do for a car?  Well, I'm busy restoring a '58 Morris Minor
(_there's_ a practical family car for you!) and also want to get back
into 914s (anybody for a swap?).
