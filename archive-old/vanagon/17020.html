&gt; If you already have an accuraty volt meter this is fine.
&gt; Otherwise add another $250 or so for a quality DVM

$250??, now not to sound crazy but dad just bought a nice
4 digit handheld Fluke for $80 with capacitance meter as
well, a nice little feature, come on we're tuning a bus
here I figure just about any old DVM would be sufficient
precision isn't really that necessary in a 1 volt range,
hell you can get a data aq. board for $250 with 12 bit
precision if you really wanted.  Admittedly I haven't
tried it but I bet a cheapo $30 Radio Snack meter would
do as well as the $300 bench model HP I happened to use
when fooling around with mine.
