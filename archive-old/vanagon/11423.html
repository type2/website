Subject: Leaking Fluid = $$$

My worst fears have imagined.  Last week I posted about
leaking fluid above where the steering column goes through
the floor.  Well here's the deal :

Turns out the clutch master is nearly gone.  I have to have
this replaced.  My mechanic who I've always trused (but now
I have this group filled with many more knowledgable people)
also found the slave cylinder 'wet'.  He said the slave could
wait but it's just a matter of time.  Does all of this sound
about right?  Oh yeah, the killer stuff - parts &amp; labor $450.00.
Is this about right also for those of you that have had the
same done?  Thanks.

-Scott.
