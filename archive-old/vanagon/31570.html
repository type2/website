&gt; I.e. we are looking at issues of reliability and availablility of parts

Here's my CDN$0.002 worth:

&gt;From a pure parts availability/ ease of maintenance stand point, I'd go 
for a bus with a 1600cc motor, as the breadloaf design is ubiquitous down 
there and the 1600cc motor is still being sold in bugs in Mexico.  A '71 
bus would be good because it runs the 1600, has disc brakes up front, and 
the rear beam can be removed for simpler engine removal.

For engine _reliability_ I'd go for a type IV motor.  Even though I dread 
the day I'll have to do any serious diagnostics with the FI system in my 
'76, I'd have no fear taking a FI breadloaf down into deepest, most 
southern Mexico and beyond.  This is partly because we had no problems 
with our FI system in 15,000 miles of touring earlier this year 
(including over 5,000 miles of tough driving in Mexico), but also because 
fuel injection mechanics are actually fairly common throughout Mexico.  My 
understanding is this is a fairly new thing and that a few years ago 
diagnosing and repairing a FI system in Mexico was a major problem.  No 
more.  Even the bugs they sell these days in Mexico run a FI 1600 motor, 
so FI isn't the mystery to shade tree machanics it used to be. 

Vanagons of any vintage are extremely rare in Mexico, and are almost 
always driven by gringo tourists.  I don't know about parts availability 
for vanagons in Mexico and beyond.  I wouldn't want to have a breakdown 
in Mexico in a Vanagon.  Baja might be ok since in many ways it is a very 
'American' region of Mexico.  Do vanagons require high octane fuel?  If 
so, you're not going to find it in many places: we had difficulty finding 
unleaded--hell, gas _period_ a lot of times--especially the further off 
the beaten path you care to venture. 

Another issue to consider is the higher ground clearance afforded by 
breadloaves.

Take a Eurovan and you're on your own.

Hope you find this useful.  (Comments, refutations, or whatever are 
invited from other list folks.)
