Subject: Mid-Life Crises and the lack of TV! (Was Something Positive...)
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

So Mark &amp; Kath says:
&gt; 
&gt; Mid-life crisis? How rude! Why is it... that... just when you figure 
&gt; out that it's OK to do something that pleases you, and you just so 
&gt; happen to be 46... that some people think you're going through some 
&gt; sort of crisis? I believe that creating &quot;Her Majesty&quot; was a 
&gt; celebration... not a crisis!

You got that right Kath.  What else are we suppose to do?  Sit around
and watch everyone else find their dreams while we watch it on TV?

CORRECT!

Actually, TV and radio waves have not been a part of our lives for 
almost 10 years!  We live at 8,600 feet and there is no cable, and due 
to our proximity to HUGE iron mountains, we're told that dishes would 
only work if they were stuck on top of Mammoth Mountain... at 11,035 
feet... then we'd have to run a cable down here. So, since TV is no big 
deal any way, we've spent our time designing and patenting a piece of 
climbing gear, writing books, Mark builds guitars - and now we have 
THIS FRICK FRACKING INTERNET! Which... BTW, was costing us $10.oo and 
hour on AOL, until about 2 weeks ago when we signed up with a brand new 
server here in Mammoth... we're down to 33 cents an hour now... it's 
fascinating!
