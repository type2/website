Subject: Concept one - At Victoria dealership/f


Last Monday my son and I went down to the local VW dealship (Speedway) to 
buy a rubber thingy for the van. Whilst I was paying for the item my son 
spotted a Concept One in the showroom. As we were looking at it a 
salesman says &quot;why not take it for a test drive?&quot;, so my son hoped on and 
scooted away. It was a nice shade of blue with silver mags and conti 
tires. It was a lot smaller than I expected. Weh it came time to go my 
son wouldn't leave the car behind so I had to buy it - my first new VW!

Its very well made, nice steering action, chrome VW logos, &quot;holographic&quot; 
lights and a squeeky horn. It wasn't too expensive - Can$77

Made in Germany by &quot;Big Spielwarenfabrik&quot;, VW # 000 019 500
