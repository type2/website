Hmmm... I musta not been listening closely.  These are standard hex head
bolts, or are they 10mm allen-head?  While I was talking to you I was
thinking allen head, and that's the socket I was talking about.  I bet I
got that wrong and they are standard bolts.  DOH.  If so, I'm sure you can
find a 1/2&quot; drive 10mm impact (black usually) socket.  I would use that
along with a 1/2&quot; drive Craftsman breaker bar.  With that setup, I don't
see how anything other than the bolt could break.  :/

Have you called a VW shop to see if the bolts should be that tight?  Have
you seen torque specs for them in any manuals?  Just some more thoughts...

Good luck,
