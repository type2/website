I took a look before starting off this morning, and I don't see how
any sort of tail pipe could be attached to the damper pipe.  There's
maybe an inch between the end of the damper pipe and the bar that gets
bolted to the frame.

Does anyone have pictures of a correct 1966 rear bumper?  With a URL
so I can look at it?
