Subject:       Interstate Batteries

Hi everyone.  The time has come to change the battery in my van 
before it leaves me stranded.  It failed a load test, and it couldn't 
get more than 50% charged... even on a battery charger overnight.

The VW Varta (Autobahn) battery is 500 cca, and has a one year free 
replacement with 3 year prorated warranty for $109 CDN.  I bought an 
Interstate battery (they make one especially for the Vanagon with 
side vents) for $116 CDN.  This Interstate battery is 700 cca with 5 
years warranty with the first 18 months free replacement.

It sounds like a better deal for the Insterstate.  The Autobahn 
battery is now sealed.. can't open vents to add water now.  So, 
typically, these sealed batteries only last 3 or 4 years.  The 
Interstate battery can be serviced (add water), and has a much longer 
potential life (in my experience).

Anyone have any good/bad things to say about Interstate batteries, 
now that I've bought one?

Thanks,

Harry.
