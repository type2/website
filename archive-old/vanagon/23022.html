Subject: Midwest Gathering

Seeing as how the BBTA is the Great Midwest Gathering for this year, 
here's a thought for next year:

Busses on &quot;66&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Route 66&quot; by Bobby Troup (sp?))

If you plan to gather in the Midwest
Take my way, the highway that's the best
Let's get our kicks 
Busses on &quot;66&quot;

It winds from Chicago to L.A.
Not quite a GNATT, but close, what the hey
Let's get our kicks
Busses on &quot;66&quot;

There's Sami in Saint Louie
Bob's in Missouri
SOTO, LiMBO, vanagon_at_lenti
We'll eat armadillo
Why's NEATO in New Mexico?
Bondo in Arizona
Don't forget the tuna
Magnesium, flannel, and bad peanut butter

Won't you get hip to this bus-man's tip
When you make that California trip
Get your kicks
Busses on &quot;66&quot; 

(end)

1996 is the 70th anniversary of Route 66 (The Mother Road).  If you play 
this song backwards, this might work out for major coming together in the 
Chicago area.  Any thoughts?  :-)
