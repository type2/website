I was 34 once!!!

I was 3 once!!

I was 4 once!

I was 43 once!!!!

Somewhere along the time-line (I forgot when ...),

my mom told me &quot;you're over 34 now .....

you can get up and make your own oatmeal.

You can even get a job while you're up!!&quot;

I remember that I would NEVER tell anyone I was 34 EVER again!!!
