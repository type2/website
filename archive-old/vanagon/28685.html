Subject: Re: EV mats 

Hmmmm..... I guess the extended length on my 95 EV-Camper has no problems with
the god awfuly expensive VW provided carpet. Strangly enough I am a pro-carpet
freak. Currently I have 3 layers of carpet in the cabin area. On the first
layer I have the $60 VW carpet, which is terribly hard to clean with the
grooved texture of the carpet. Does anyone else think that $60 for a 4ftx3ft is
a bit steep. On the second layer I have a $10 burber remnant that I bought at a
carpet store. It's easy to clean, no hard feelings or grief if I spill grape
juice on it or what ever and I can trim it at will to fit wrinkle free, then
finish the edges off with a blow torch or lighter. On top of it all I have a
nice round imitation oriental carpet, which I only payed $22 for. So far I have
spilled beer, juice and other party liquids that can reek the place out. Only
once has vile liquid hit the marine carpet, layer 0, which is impervious to
most everything anyway.

I have found that the VW carpet that you can get for the front under the driver
and passenger is always doing the wrinkle thing around my gear shift. I too
want to fuse it to the regular carpet. Again I have 1ftx1ft floor
mats on top of the carpets. They seem to help keep the other carpet from moving
around and wrinkling. Which is one of the great things of the multi layer
carpeting strategy. Also when you make a grevious spill you can just pickup the
offending carpet and get it out of the van ASAP and still have a protective
layer underfoot.

Call me nuts or carpet freak...When I hand over the EV to my children I hope
the carpets are still intact.

&gt; &gt;While I'm at it I have another question for the EV faction on the list:
&gt; &gt;has any of you purchased a set of floor mats from VW? I did and have had
&gt; &gt;a constant problem with the rear mat (in the &quot;cabin&quot; under the table) not
&gt; &gt;staying in place. We flatten it out, even pin it under the fiberboard panel
&gt; &gt;under the third row (bench)seat, and it always comes up in a hump in the
&gt; &gt;middle that all of us are constantly tripping over. Any experience with this
&gt; &gt;problem and solutions??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; yes.
&gt;
&gt; our's does the same thing; 'bunches up in a hump between the two rear-
&gt; facing jump seats.
&gt;
&gt; solution(s)?
&gt;
&gt; well, i haven't found one yet...short of applying heat and fusing the damn
&gt; thing to the OEM carpet underneath, about the only other thing I can think
&gt; of is to apply velcro strips to the bottom and stomp on that sucker!
&gt;
&gt; eagerly awaiting fixes to this incredibly technical problem w/ EVs   ;-)
