&gt; I just bought a piano tuning toolkit, dated 1906 (stamped on various

Hi Thom!  I'll bet the recipient of this present will really like
it.  Piano tuners cherish their tools (kind of like VW owners, though
the five foot cheater pipes are used less frequently in the piano
world :-)  ) and a lovely old hammer with a nice wood handle
is a joy.  I don't know what the wood block with hole in it
could be for (wire bending helper?), but I'll bet there are some
rubber thingies (could have a handle on them) for damping 
strings (so you can tune the other ones), and maybe a kind of
rasp for &quot;fluffing&quot; the felt hammers, and maybe some little
files for shaping them.  Baldwin is an old piano company, still
in business (some people like them better than Steinway).

Cool find!  Probably a good price, too.

P.S.  A good instrument buider's shop is almost as much fun to
be in as a machine shop.  Ah, the smell of varnish and sawdust,
it's up there with machine oil, cutting fluid, and the inside
of a VW engine compartment  :-)
