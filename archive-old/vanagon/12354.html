Subject:       Sticker non-consensus solution

Let me be boring for a minute (times up, houg).

I doubt we will come to a consensus re: sticker-ology.  And as The
Ontario-an (new show coming out this fall?) said, many of us will
likely never see another list member.  How about this--

Many groups of things with breakdown potential (Norton owners for
example) publish a 'guide' of members who are willing to have their
name, address, and phone number listed.  This can serve a couple
functions: 

A.  if you breakdown in Flamefart County, AL and need help
desperately, one could look in their 'guide' to find a list members
in the area that have already acknowledged they would be willing to
help in some way (comforting voice, lodging, a tow and a beer, etc.) 

B.  it seems we (well, at least I) are often losing those post-it 
notes surrounding our desk with the names/numbers of list members 
we're in communication with.  a 'guide' could list an internet and 
snail mail address.

Sooo... a possible guide format could include:
-name
-internet address
-snail mail address
-and possibly an 'assistance' category that would designate if that 
individual would be willing to provide some sort of assisstance to 
list members in transit.  i realize this has some potential problems 
associated with it but it's an idea....
