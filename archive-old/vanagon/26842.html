Subject: Re: cargo hauls- harvey chao's list

          ok, harvey you got my attention.  i understood &amp; nodded my
          weary head while reading each item on your list, &quot;yep, that
          makes sense...&quot; and then i come across the IV pole.  you
          must tell the story.  i have visions of hunter thompson
          dragging his pole around the hospital room sipping on the
          bottle of &quot;jack&quot; taped to it.  we wanna know what the IV
          pole is for!!!    ray
