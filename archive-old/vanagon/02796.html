Subject: RE: Eurobago

&gt;But $31k?  I'd buy a used monster motor home for that much, with far more
&gt;comfort and far less gas mileage (16/18 EPA on the sticker). Let's hope,
&gt;for VWoA's sake that lots of people see more utility in it than I do...

We took one out for a spin while on the Syncro hunt. Steering, shifting is
definitely much more car like (good or bad, matter of taste). Significantly
broader torque curve than a Vanagon, much more like a &quot;regular&quot; car or
truck (nice, but not without a price at the pump). Felt like a much larger
&amp; heaver vehicle than a Vanagon. Definitely felt like you were bringing
some serious weight to a stop and the back window is a long way back.

As for the camping gear, the two items that caught my attention were the
rear seat and pop-up top. The foldout rear seat is much more mechanically
complicated than one on a Westy, as the whole seat can be slid forward or
backwards as well as folded out. I gives a bit more room but is a bit too
much like a hide-a-bed for me. The top pops up with struts. Much less
effort to get up but does not seem to lock into place. What happens if a
strong gust hits the top straight on from the rear, do the people in the
top bunk get squished? And blinds are definitely not as nice as curtains.

I am curious as to how many they will sell at this price, but on the other
hand, if you've been to an RV show lately, you know that everything else is
designed and marketed towards grandma &amp; grandpa (oak cabinets, overstuffed
couches, brass fixtures). By contrast, the Eurobago looks like a vehicle
you might actually camp in with kids &amp; dogs &amp; fishin' buddies. And for a
brand new camper &amp; extra cab pickup, you're definitely in the same price
range with less utility. If you've ever tried to sleep 4 adults in a
camper, you'll appreciate the beauty of the pop top design (what good is a
toilet when no one can get to it because the second bed blocks all access).
