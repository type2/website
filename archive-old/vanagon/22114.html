a '56, thankyouverymuch!

&gt;           ask you this question. I have an opportunity to buy a '60
&gt;           bus with a 1600 engine, in good exterior shape, and with a
&gt;           new interior.  I'll be talking to the guy today to find out

How much? 

&gt;           any obvious problems (actually, I think its supposed to have
&gt;           a slight tranny leak, maybe from the front seal, which is

Its actually a bushing that wears and nobody replaces 'cause they are hard
to find.

&gt;           pretty common I hear)...what I wanted to know is how
&gt;           difficult will it be to transfer my beetle knowledge to this
&gt;           bus? I understand that the drivetrain is significantly
&gt;           different, among other things. I'll send more details later,

The only thing different in the drivetrain is the reduction boxes, which
you really don't have to do much with - keep fluid in the tranny and you're
OK.

I don't know what you know about reduction boxes, so this may seem a bit
pedestrian...

RB's were used from '49 to '67. They are used to get a lower final drive 
ratio, to get better oomph out of the (at the time) little motor, at the 
cost of top speed and acceleration.  The bus tranny is the same as the bug, 
except the ring and pinion is &quot;flipped&quot; to the other side, so that the drive 
direction is backwards from a bug.  This is because the reduction gears 
consist of 2 gears, which reverses the direction.

The RB's are usually trouble free.  They get their fluid from the
tranny, thru the axle tube, so make sure thats up to snuff.  

When you change your tranny fluid, (which you should do when you get this bus)
you can change the RB fluid by opening up the 17MM hex plugs with the
same tool ya used for the tranny.  You can make filling quicker by putting
about a pint or so of fluid in thru the top plug.

BTW - its a lot easier if you remove the rear wheels to get at these plugs.

Your bug knowledge will do ya just fine.

One last note - if you're gonna send me a personal message, put something
like &quot;hey thom&quot; in the subject.  Sometimes I just blaze thru and miss stuff.
Apologies to anyone else who has asked me a question and I didn't reply.
I'm not blowing you off.  I like to think I have a rep for fast,
accurate replies, and sometimes I &quot;tune out&quot; certain threads.
