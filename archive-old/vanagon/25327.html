&gt;I guess I was typing too fast this morning.  In pretending to be
&gt;miffed by the shower teasing, some of you (many, actually) took me
&gt;seriously.  I was just teasing! (it's Friday, remember?  :).  Nobody
&gt;loves this group more than I do.  
&gt;
&gt;Besides, as one person suggested, if I REALLY wanted to get back at
&gt;you all, I'd charge you for showers at Baja.

&gt;fondly,
