&gt;Ok, smart guy.....explain &quot;Variant&quot;...

Variant is my mother's sister. :)   actually, the way it was used in the
german book, it was a bit ambiguous ... they wrote of 2-door and 4-door
'Limosines' (sedans?), but the Variant was always 2-door, and a 'notchback'
style of body (i.e., no hatchbacks). perhaps it is just the crazy german
stylists ... somewhat like the brits calling their cars Saloons  (always
wondered about that. :)

&gt;we already have an explanation for &quot;Deviant&quot;.... he who maintains
&gt;lists and writes songs!   8-)

Deviant is Variant's sister. they are both my aunts. :)  (although, Aunt Devi
is a lot more fun!) ;)
