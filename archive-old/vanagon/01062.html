Subject: please repost remedy for sagging doors


I neglected to save the post which describes various remedies for fixing 
sagging bus doors.  The driver's side door of my '66 is a bitch to get 
open (I can see where it is rubbing), and I've got some time this weekend 
to fix it.  Could some kind soul repost this valuable info?  Thanks.
