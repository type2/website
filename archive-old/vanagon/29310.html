Hi all.  I'm considering buying a '79 bus.  I was looking through
Parts Place catalog last night, and noticed something peculiar.  They
sell exhaust systems for '74-'78 1/2 bus, which had no catalytic
converter.  They also sell exhaust systems for '79 1/2-'83 Vanagons,
which did have a catalytic converter.  What happened to the exhaust
for the '79 bus, which had CC?  Are these the rarest things on earth?
Anyone know whether the same exhaust w/ CC from the early Vgons can be
used?  What about '77 1/2-'79 California buses--what do they do?

Also, I've looked at a couple '79s, and they have all had the CCs
removed.  What is the legality of this?  As long as it passes
emissions, who cares?  Or is it legally required?

Thanks for any info,
Rodney
