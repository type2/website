Subject: ATF?  Dexron-III ? Mercon  ??

OK, one last question and I'll go away.  Castrol Syntec only seems to be
avail. labeled as Dexron-III/Mercon. I want cold weather startups made easy,
hence the Syntec.   Label says fully compatible with older Dex_II etc. etc.
What's this Mercon deal, anyone know if this stuff will work OK, if it will
damage stuff, and if I should really spend $9/qt. instead of $3 for regular
ATF. Thanks, tim
