&gt;&gt;Name for Bus/Van fans?
&gt;&gt;&quot;Loafers&quot;

&gt;This one's pretty hard to beat; it works on so many levels  8^)
&gt;Still, how 'bout:
&gt;Busochists      Vanochists

or, if we were all martial-arts-beat-em-up-movie-buffs ...
Van-Dammed.

or, if we were all art collectors, we could be
Van Go        &lt;Van Goners????&gt;

didn't VW used to sell/give-away old style hats with &quot;Bus Driver&quot; on them??
like the hats that Greyhound drivers used to wear?? that sorta says it all,
don't you think? Bus Driver. :)  &lt;i always wanted to get a breadloaf and
paint it exactly like a greyhound bus, except instead of a dog on the side
and back, i'd put a turtle!!!&gt; :)
