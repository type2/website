&gt; 1. While inspecting the head, found a crack along one of the openings for 
&gt; the push rod tube.  Since this is not an area under too much stress, will 
&gt; I be safe to put some JB Weld along the crack and then hone out the hole 
&gt; so that the washer on the end of the push rod tube will seal tightly?  

Er, what washer?  I assume you mean &quot;seal&quot;.  I suppose your JB weld
solution would be okay, but I would expect an oil leak.  Those joints
don't seal well to begin with, and a cracked/possibly-expanded one...
&gt; 
&gt; 2.Will I be safe to put a piston into this spare cylinder? 

Safe?  Well, you probably won't die, but the chances of the piston
weighing the same as the others in your engine is close to nada.  That's
going to throw the motor out of balance, and shorten its life.  By how
much is anybody's guess.

&gt; 															 Volkswagen 
&gt; will sell me one piston/cylinder set for $250, 

ROFL

&gt; 											Whitney (don't want to use 
&gt; them if I can avoid it) has a set of four for $250, and RMMW has a set for 
&gt; ~$300+ with 20% off (I think)...

I'd feel safe buying the Whitney ones if they are a known brand,
otherwise I'd spring for the RMMW set.

&gt; 3. Does anyone out there have any ideas on how I might get either a 
&gt; single piston, or a piston/cylinder for somewhat less than the above 
&gt; alternatives?  I would gladly purchase one from any list member who might 
&gt; have one they could spare.  I have tried the local used parts places and 
&gt; the two local VW garages with no sucess.

I have a set I'll give you for the cost of shipping, but in addition to
the weight problem, it's also a fraction of a mm larger than stock.
It's a *really* bad idea to mix displacements on individual cylinders,
but I've heard of people doing it in emergencies.  I'd only do this if
you are *absolutely* unable to afford the new cylinders and *must* ave
your bus running immediately.  I'd use my last $300 of credit to buy the
new p/c set before I'd put a non-matching p/c on my engine, though.
