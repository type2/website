Subject: Re: aux oil cooler as heater core?

There is such a beast found within the ads of Hot VW's this month.  
It is designed to go inside your vehicle in the winter to warm it and 
to go outside the vehicle in summer to cool your oil.  Works on it's 
own or in conjunction with a seperate oil cooler.  No experience with 
the product, just saw it in the magazine.

&gt; Here's a silly idea I just had, knowing nothing about these issues: If
&gt; a watercooled engine pumps coolant through a heater core, could the
&gt; same be done to provide heat from an auxilliary oil cooler on an
&gt; aircooled engine?  Why or why not?  Is it simply because no-one ever
&gt; engineered such a beast, so they don't exist?  Or is there some
&gt; fundamental problem, like this setup would cool the oil too much, or
&gt; you could never run a pump strong enough to force the oil through the
&gt; heater core?  Or would it be such a high-pressure hydraulic system
&gt; that a small pinhole leak would turn into a Sawsall and destroy
&gt; anything in its path?
