&gt; Bentley and Haynes each have pretty good pictures of the tinware.  The
&gt; Bentley manual is the &quot;official&quot; one and you can order it through
&gt; numerous VW places, maybe even your local dealer.  The Haynes you can
&gt; find in your local FLAPS.  If they don't have the one for your bus,
&gt; they will order it.  Still, you might also want to take a trip to a
&gt; junkyard to see one put together.

I think Tom Wilson's book (How to rebuild your aircooled VW...) does too. 
NOt sure, though, since I haven't bought it yet. Joe
