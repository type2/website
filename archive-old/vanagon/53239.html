Subject: Re: 97 EV's

....he did some digging and discovered that in the
&gt;States only the automatic transmission will be available on them. It's
&gt;in Canada, where the '97's will have a 5-cyliner turbo diesel option, that
&gt;a manual transmission will be sold.


Does anyone know if the vw's imported and sold in Canada are US (DOT)
approved. Could someone go up to Canada and buy a vw and bring it back, legally?
I'm curious.

Rob
