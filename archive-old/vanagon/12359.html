&gt; Many groups of things with breakdown potential (Norton owners for
&gt; example) publish a 'guide' of members who are willing to have their
&gt; name, address, and phone number listed.  This can serve a couple
&gt; functions: 
&gt; 
This sounds like a great idea, and certainly plausible...Although I do
think a sticker would be great...
perhaps-
 Follow us, we love our bus
 Ain't no fuss, just drive a bus

or maybe just a big VW logo, with TYPE II beside it
and the list address
 or 
&quot;I'm on the Bus List&quot;
with the address

or
&quot;my bus made the honor roll at vanagon.lenti...&quot;
actually, I kinda like that one...
I really like it, anyone else?
it could look like those honor roll stockers, with a VW logo instead of
a school logo...
anyway
let's do it!
