Subject: '79 squeeky brakes in wet weather

Hey folks, 
My brakes squeek/scrape/and pull when it is raining or snowing.
Once the poor weather lets up, so does the problem with the brakes.
Back in May of '94, many parts were replaced, including:
2 calipers, 2 rotors, 2 rear drums, a set of rear shoes, and rear brake
cables.  When the weather is fine, so are the brakes, but when the weather
turns ugly, so does the noise from the brakes.
Any ideas?
Thanks!
Paul
