Subject: Re: Side Mirrors

Karen in London, OH asked how to tighten up the side mirrors.  Because
others may wist to know as well I am making this a general post.

You need to remove the mirror from the vehicle.  There are two large
Phillips head screws that anchor the mirror base to the door.  Once removed,
turn the mirror so that the mounting base is bottom side up and locate the
10mm (?) nut.  By judiciously tightening this nut, you add more tension on
the spring that holds the ball and socket joint together.  Don't over do it,
the stud that the nut is threaded on is just a press fit up into the body of
the mirror.

Re-assembly is the reverse . . .
