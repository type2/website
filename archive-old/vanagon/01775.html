&gt;&gt; I wouldn't recommend either the roof mounting sort or the front

&gt;&gt; can attach it to the back?

Unfortunately, at least with roads in Texas, Oregon, and Idaho, things are
always getting kicked up (as the dozens of knicks on the front of my
otherwise quite sexy van attests)...and then there are the bugs.

Excellent point on the exhaust, though.  However, most of the cheap racks
can be mounted quite high on the back--as opposed to the more expensive
trailer hitch variety.  I haven't heard of any problems with mounting on
the back--save yours--and think it's the way to go... Then again, if your
bikes cost more than your van (quite possible) I'd place them inside, if
such is possible, in order to reduce both exposure to the elements and the
possiblity of theft (I wouldn't leave strap mounted racks with bikes
unattended on the van even if the bikes are locked to the rack...would-be
thieves may just slice the straps, stealing both bikes and the rack.)
