&gt; Subject: typing 2 ink (obr)

&gt; just been reading my obr and can solve the mystery of the
&gt; panel van cargo door handle!  hi jim!   couldnt resist
&gt; saying my bit, as I like fiddling with locks and sorting out
&gt; the system 50-67 in my head and on buses.

For those without Old Bus Review, in it I asked why panel
vans have different side door handles than all other Splits.

&gt; As they were expected to carry cargo, not people, there was
&gt; no reason to have an inside handle on the cargo door.   It
&gt; would just catch up on stuff.  So the panel van handle have
&gt; a shorter square shaft.

Thank you, Clara.  I don't have a panel van at my disposal
for reference, but I figured it was something like your
explanation.

&gt; 67 cargo door handles are a one year only.   They are made
&gt; for the L series key which was used in 67 - 70 in buses.

Cargo door handles, rear latch handles, fuel gauges,
wiper motors, master cylinders....tell me about it!

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

You just wrote much of my next article...and added much
helpful information.  I have some specific information on
the series of cylinders VW used, but mostly a lot of pieces
of information without time-frame and model.

&gt; The square lock pins moved by the lock came in dealer
&gt;  replacement handles.  Ones sold w/ the car have round pins.

That is new information to me.  The two '67s I have with
square locking pins led me to believe they were a &quot;late&quot; '67
item (like the dual master cylinder).

&gt; Im not sure when they put the lock on the door mechanism
&gt; with the lever on the inside.  I think around 63.  earlier
&gt; ones  didnt have it.

Does that mean that just the pin in the handle (and
escutcheon) was the only locking mechanism before
that?

&gt; I never had a problem with the crew coming out and the
&gt;   handle shaking loose.  I have had a problem with  the
&gt;   screw breaking off in the handle.   Either way the
&gt;   handle's uselessor gone. yurk

You must have had a well-behaved *crew* then! :) My crew
usually got out and shook the handle till the screw came
loose.  Or, they ran along side me and threw the handle in a
ditch somewhere so I couldn't find it.  Never had a broken
screw (just a few loose ones in my head).

&gt; btw, all handles somewhere one them have the key code.  It
&gt; is possible to have a new key cut for your handle, if you
&gt; can find a locksmith witth the blanks and the codes.  I just
&gt; had a pair of new T keys cut for a 66 camper, cost me $15
&gt; plus tax.  Keys worked in all the handles except the cargo
&gt; door handle, in which to my surprise the end of the cylinder
&gt; was broken off, so i transferred the pins over into a
&gt; cylinder off a spare handle and installed it.  Happy locks.

You got hosed!  My locksmith special-ordered a bag of ten
blanks (which he'll probably never need) and cut a copy for
me for $3.  (Matt Henricks, I know where you can get more
copies....cheap).

&gt; my  2 cents.

Am I the only one who feels that we are keeping our buses
alive 2 cents at a time?

&gt; :)

Thanks for more information.  And thanks for reading Typing
2 Ink.  I'm no expert (as you can tell) in this field, just
someone who has been through much of the grunt work and
writes about it.  Some times it's a pain to sit and write
1,000 words on a subject and have it make sense to any bus
nut (from novice to expert).  Other times I see that I'm at
2,000 words and still haven't made any point.

And I really didn't mean to monopolize OBR, seems my name
came up even in John Lago's article.  What he says about
Karl is true, a master of the simple statement.
