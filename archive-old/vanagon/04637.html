&gt; &gt;They are indeed stamped &quot;reinforced&quot;, but I'll try to verify that they

&gt; &gt;way up to 40#, the maximum rating of the tire.

&gt; Reinforced can imply thicker rubber/filler materials in the side walls, and 
&gt; nothing more. For a good example of this try to flex a Pirelli Winter 190 in 
&gt; a size appropriate to vans. These are stiff tires, I highly recommend them 
&gt; for all out winter driving, I use four! BUT they are not C6 or LT rated, and 
&gt; they will squirm a bit in hard dry spring time driving. The fact that you 
&gt; mention that the Michelins max pres. is 40psi means that they are NOT what 
&gt; you want, the tires should max out at 55 psi, and run them at 36-44 psi, 
&gt; pref 36. You want real truck tires, not beefed up car tires. My panel used 
&gt; to be as light a vanagon as possible, and when I put 1500 lbs of concrete 
&gt; block in it, the front 4 ply tire pancaked out, while the rear C6's looked 
&gt; normal. I now have C6 all round.
&gt; 
That makes sense.  The Continentals (non-squirmy/'82 vanagon) were rated 
50# and I ran them about 40-45#.
