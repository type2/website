Hello,

I am interested in this as well.

Why do you want an electric?  Do you have a diesel?  I have used vacuum 
based cruises in busses for 15 years without a problem.

Of the several that I've tried, I prefer one made by Zemco.  My current 
one, since 1984 in my '84 ruptured the diaphragm in the servo this Spring 
... My first Zemco failure.  However, when I tried to get a new part, I 
only found disconnected and wrong phone numbers.  The Zemco that made my 
cruise is out of business.

I fixed the diaphragm by fabricating a new one from one of those heavy 
rubber balloons that kids bounce around.  However, I have low confidence 
that it will last.  My local FLAPS don't seem to carry cruise controls any 
more.  JCWhitney still has them, but I am a little uncomfortable buying 
before looking the installation instructions over.

Besides the ease of installation, the thing that sold me on the Zemco was 
its fail-safe design.  The unit uses an ignition signal to detect a rapid 
change in engine speed rather than a clutch switch.  The Zemco would not 
operate if the detector wire fell off.  Clutch switch units have no way of 
knowing if the switch becomes inoperative.

Mike

Hello,
Isspro in Portland sells an electric servo cruise control kit for
Vanagons complete with stalk etc. for about $200. Has anybody completed
this installation. If so, please comment on degree of difficulty of
installation (0-10) and the degree of funtionality of this non-factory
installed item, again-(0-10).  '87 Vanagon-Westy.
Thanks to all
Paul Albert
