Subject: Re: &quot;Tundra Toaster&quot; heater II

I always thought that perfect combustion resulted in CO2 and H20...

Less than perfect combustion produces nasties....

There are lots of unvented propane heaters. The question is would you 
sleep with one in a closed bus ? Why does this thing need so much juice?
