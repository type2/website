Mark Pinkstone  asked:  &quot;2.  Brake fluid reservoir (here's the Bonehead part).
 Where is it?&quot;

Grab the back edge of the cover to the instrument panel (on top of the dash)
and pull up and rotate it twoards you to remove.  You should find the cap to
the brake fluid reservoir in about the center of the instrument cluster under
this cover.  If the PO hasn't lost it, there will be a plastic shield around
it to prevent spills from getting into the instrument cluster.  By the way,
this same reservoir also feeds the clutch master cylinder.
