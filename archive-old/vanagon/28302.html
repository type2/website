&gt; Well Jim,
&gt; You may not be a pinhead about determing the worth of your auto parts,

&gt; to believe differently about how you determine the worth of other human 
&gt; beings.  If you MUST partake in the degradation of women, buy magazines 
&gt; devoted to that, but there is no reason why a VW (or any other car) 
&gt; magizine HAS to have anybody objectified.  
&gt; I didn't want to go on a rant about this, but how we act as VW owners, 
&gt; and whatever else we all are, has a tremendous bearing on many other 
&gt; people. It seems that you have the advantages that allow you to be 
&gt; &quot;politically incorrect and proud of it&quot; but the majority of people 
&gt; don't.  Try being considerate of other people, it really doesn't hurt... 
&gt; anyone.

Well Dave...for not wanting to go on a rant, you seem to have done a 
mighty fine job. I commend you!

Let's see, where do I start. I'm not sure how buying a VW mag and pausing 
to look at the bikini babes is degrading to women. These women get paid 
big bucks to pose in these mags. No one forces them. Why do they do this? 
The magazines ask them to. Why is that, you may ask? It sells magazines. 
Period. If it didn't, they wouldn't waste their money on it. I like to 
think I'm a pretty responsible VW driver. I rarely speed. (Like my bus 
could go over the speed limit) I always obey traffic signs. Whenever I 
see another VW owner broken down at the side of the road, I stop to help 
them. If they happen to be women, I don't start drooling. I'm very 
polite. I'm the same way with males. I don't think I'm a detriment to 
society simply because I happen to like to look at the female form. 

You're blowing this whole thing out of proportion. Get a life Dave.
