&gt; At this point I'm not sure why I'm posting this stuff, it's rather
&gt; embarrassing actually.  I've gotten a bit of feedback from excerpts so I
&gt; guess people are reading it.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I stop?
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody find it helpful or anything?

  Keep going. I personally like hearing about peoples experiences with
  their busses. All this stuff provides information thats useful
  and interesting. I try and read all the posts, even if they
  aren't directly relevant (like the H20 and GNATT stuff). They give the
  list it's `flavour'.

  I mean where else could I go on and on about type 2s and still find 
  people willing to keep listening/writing about them without their eyes 
  glazing over, yawning and generally finding this stuff not as interesting
  as it is?

  cheers
