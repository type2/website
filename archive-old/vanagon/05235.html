Subject: a newbie pulls an engine!


Yes folks, a simple tug, crash, and bang dropped that sucker right on
the ground - &quot;that&quot; being a pancake in my '72 Westy - and thanks to
Robert, Bill, and Joel for their email assistance.

I am pulling the engine in the first place to get some head work done
so that I can pass CA smog, and while it is out I will check over the
whole engine to see if it will last another 50,000 miles while I would
like to build another engine it for. The bus itself only cost $500, so
I spent a few extra hundred on tools and manuals, and am grateful that
I don't have my VW hating girlfriend anymore - meaning I have all the
time in the world to work every weekend on it if I so desire :)

I also got the chance to play the newbie manual game...trying to find
all VW manuals I could - like the usual mistake, I actually paid for a
Chilton book, then found a Haynes, which wasn't too bad, except the
pictures were too dark - I couldn't really make anything out, and some
of the descriptions were like &quot;pull of the wires to the starter,
battery, [etc..], and any other wires that might be there&quot;. &quot;Oh great&quot;
I thought. But then I found the Bentley book from VW, and there was
much rejoicing - great pictures and exploded diagrams! I ordered the
John Muir book, but have to wait about 2 months, it was on
backorder. But the book on rebuilding a pancake was not available, the
publisher did not have any!

It actually wasn't too bad pulling it out, in retrospect that is. The
first day stressed me a little because there were all these wires that
I had to label, and so many screws holding in those tins. They all
didn't need to be removed for a simple removal, but I will be taking
apart the engine soon.

Once I get this guy running I will be able to get around to replacing
the timing belt and adjusting the valves on my '93 Civic. Now *that*
will be a challenge for a weekend wanna-be-mechanic.

Enough rambling for now...except for my quick attempt with haiku, I
know it ain't Friday, but oh well...

remove the pancake
spend all my money on it
now I call it home
