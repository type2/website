&gt;I have an 83 Vanagan Waterboxer that runs cold and refuses to warm up in
&gt;cold weather.  I have changed the thermostat but no change.  When the
&gt;problem first occurred I assumed a thermostat stuck open.  I went to the
&gt;local parts house and found the right thermostat though it cost $20.  After
&gt;changing it went to operating temperature while idling in the driveway so I
&gt;thought the problem was solved.  The next day or so I decided to drive into
&gt;town (12 mile round trip).  Temperature never got above the marks that mark
&gt;the low range (half-way between the low end and the low fluid warning
&gt;light.  One other symptom is a loss of coolant at about the rate of a pint
&gt;every 2 weeks.  There is no sign of fluid loss anywhere and when this
&gt;problem first occurred about a year ago I had a leak down test (overnight)
&gt;performed but the results were negative.  Has anybody got any ideas?  I
&gt;would really appreciate adivce/help on this.

Larry,
How is the heat output from your heater?  If the heater puts out a reasonable
amount of heat, then the problem is likely with the temperature sensor or
temperature gage.
