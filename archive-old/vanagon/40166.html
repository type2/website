&gt;My mechanic had installed (as a patch) a spark plug as oil drain plug. He
&gt;said to me that the oil pan treads are stripped, so the next size is a spark
&gt;plug. Is there a better solution, or maybe a real drain plug with the size
&gt;of a spark plug ?

You should be able to get a drain plug with a 14mm thread.  I would suggest a
heli-coil.  If the 144mm thread wears out, you are in trouble.
