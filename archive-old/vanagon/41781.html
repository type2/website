Subject: Mystery Splittie Single Cab revisited


I just spotted the no-longer-mysterious Mystery Single Cab Splittie again 
where I work here, and picked up a few more details people asked me about.

The only things electrical on the back end of the bus, are the two little 
round flat taillights with chrome rims. No backup lights, no reflectors, no 
openings where other things should go. The rear hatch has a hole in the 
bottom center, which I at first took to be where the 
lock/pushbutton/whatever went to latch the hatch. But one listmember said 
that this '61 bus didn't come with a rear engine hatch lock or pushbutton 
(what *did* it come with there?); and another asked me if it had a crank 
handle aperture, to which I answered No. Now, however, I couldn't help but 
notice that this little hole in the hatch, was directly in line with the 
engine crankshaft. You don't suppose...???

The &quot;table&quot; inside the hatch, which is the first thing you take off when 
replacing the engine or muffler, has no corresponding hole. Maybe that piece 
isn't original? The 1600 DP engine, has no crank receptor, of course, but 
that means nothing.

The louvers on the rear quarters, on either side of the engine compartment, 
point out, not in. Also, the three louvers just behind the front cab doors, 
also point out.

The rear bumper is complete. The two vertical overriders, point straight up, 
just outside the hatch as it opens. There is one upper horizontal tube 
leading outward from the top of each overrider. They curve around the round 
corners of the bus and slope down, to meet the bumper ends at a 45 degree 
angle off vertical. The bumper is five pieces total-- the main beam that 
curves around both rear corners of the bus, the two vertical overriders, and 
the two tubes. Plus bolts&amp;nuts of course.

Cool car.
