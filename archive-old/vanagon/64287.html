As I recall from actually reading one of those stickers on the tread of a
tire, you want low letters and high numbers.  C or D tires are probably not
that great, especially when combined with the fact they are $40 or $50.  A
more realistic price for an 8-ply light truck tire would be around $80-100
I would think.

&gt; &gt;        - tread pattern
&gt; &gt;        - the Y370 is a non-reinforced sidewall 8-ply
&gt; &gt;        - the Y356 is a reinforced sidewall, comes in 6- or 8-ply
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        Anyone out there using a Y356? Please respond with your
&gt; &gt;        comments and I will add those to the Y370 and Michelin rants
&gt; &gt;        and raves.
&gt;
&gt; The Y356 is/was available in both 6 and 8 ply C and D raters, for
&gt; quite some time it was the budget leader tire in 185R14 for the vans,
&gt; I think about $40 and $50 respectively from Tire Rack for years,
&gt; but it is a TERRIBLE tire.  It is a highway rib tread design, ie
&gt; looks like a Mack truck tire, it has no sipes running perpendicular
&gt; to the tread to channel out water, sort of like a 70's bias ply tread
&gt; design.  Unless you live in the desert, largely to be avoided, but it
&gt; is an exceptionaly smooth running long lasting tire for the reasons
&gt; that make it horrendous in the wet.
