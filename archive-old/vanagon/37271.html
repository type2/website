Subject: Re: Pomona swap meet?

&gt;
&gt;did anybody out there go to the auto swap meet this weekend?  boy was it 
&gt;crouded.  they had so many people out there, that they could no longer 
&gt;let folks in to show there cars off.  i was one of those unluck ones.  i 
&gt;am still trying to sell my 75 westy.  if anybody wants one in the So Cal 
&gt;area.  i am very negotiable and need to sell it.
&gt;
&gt;take care and God Bless
&gt;matt
&gt;
&gt;Ya...I went...looking for parts for the bus but after 3hrs of walking
up and down it was very apparent that this was NOT VW COUNTRY.
