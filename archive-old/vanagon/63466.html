Subject: Vanagon Parts Closeouts - HURRY!

THE LIST IS BACK!!!!    :-)  :-)  :-)

Forgive me for rushing to post this so soon after the List came back up,
but I've been waiting to post it for a week and hoping that it wouldn't be
too late.

One of my suppliers came to me with a couple of Vanagon parts close-outs
about a week ago.  I thought I'd scored a major coup when I got him to
agree to hold them for me until I could let the Vanagon list know about
them, thereby giving the List first shot at the limited quantities that
were available.  Of course, no sooner did he agree to do this than the
Vanagon list shut down, so I couldn't let you all know.  So quantities are
now even more limited.  A couple of the items, like the manual steering
racks, aren't exactly high-demand items, but if you need one you pay $$$
for it.  Others, like the water pumps, are worth buying a spare of at this
price. Anyway, if you need these parts, please let me know quickly, and
I'll see how many are left.


Brake Calipers  '86-up Vanagon  (New, original ATE/Germany)  $149 ea. (Last
*wholesale* cost was $180)

Boge Rear Shocks, Vanagon Syncro  $62.50 each   (4 available) 

1.9L Water Pump (made by Laso Arthur Langenhan Gmbh, best German pump and
usually pricier than the others; original wholesale cost was $68,
manufacturer's retail $140)   $44.50

Windshield Wiper Arms (original German)   $10.75 each  ($30 each in the
RMMW catalog)
 
Steering Rack, manual  (brand new German rack, not rebuilt)  $239.50 


As an aside, I'd like to add my thanks Chris and Coyote for all their
efforts (and expense) in working to get the list up again, and Gerry for
bringing V_at_L back in the meantime.  As busy as I've been with work, I
didn't realize how much I enjoyed the Vanagon list (on a purely personal
level) until it went away.  It's great to be back!
