Subject: [Need Info] Replacing Heads on `80 Westy

Alright.  

I'm contemplating yet another endeavor . . . .

I'm looking at a Westy with blown heads.  The degree of the damage is
not known.  

What is the worst-case scenario wrt replacing heads on an air-cooled
flat four??  

Do it yourself and shop?

Thanks in advance.

W.
