Latest on the Blue-Paz VANAGON saga!

VWoA via the BBB autoline program has agreed to reimburse me for $394.00. They are only covering a Crank-Shaft-Seal replacement. Since the program is limited to
internal engine parts, BBB wont let me go to arbitration! I explained a million times that I want my van fixed (that FI problem) even if no money (close to 5K) is reimbursed. But they made it clear that it's basically a matter of take it or leave it. I haven't heard from the attorney yey, I guess I will take the $400, and then hit them again for the rest in court.

More later!
