Subject: FS: Bentley Manual for Rabbit/Scirocco

Hi all,

Since I no longer have either a Rabbit or Scirocco, I won't be 
needing this...

I paid $35 or so, it's like new, and covers '75-79 models.
It's currently used to raise my monitor a little, which seems a 
waste, so if anyone needs it, $10 &amp; it's yours.

ps: I'm in Victoria, BC, but will split postage, as long as it's not 
more than $10!

Thx.
