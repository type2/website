Thanks to all that respond, support, and give me leads for my case....
Here is the latest:

A quick recap... Ever since my fuel injectors were changed as part of a recall,
My van started stalling/hesitating, bad performance, not starting, etc. I took it in 4 times to have it checked with no answer. It broke 2 times with exactly
the same problem, smoke, stalling to a halt and then never started again. THe
first time they dealer said it was the air-flow sensor ($500 part) and I drove
the van home...but still same symptoms were still there. Last week the van broke
again under exaclty the same conditions and now it does not start, it turns, but
it never starts.

I am sueing. No matter how much it costs in legal fees. I need some supporting
comments from anyone that had similar problems or FI recalls... IN other words,
I am going to have to prove that this was indeed a FI recall problem that 
initiated the whole problem. It would take an idiot not to figure it out, but we all know about the judicial system, so I want to have all the supporting documentation I can.

Thanks.
Sergio
