Subject: &quot;wobble&quot; pump



Hi bus/vanagon people,

Well, I took Georgie, my recently aquired 1973 campmobile, camping this
last weekend in New Mexico.  This camper has all the camping equipment
inside the way it came from the Westfalia factory.  We had a great time.

I have a question about the sink water pump that is described as a
&quot;wobble&quot; pump in the camper part of the owner's manual.  The pump I
have has difficulty &quot;priming&quot;, that is, getting started delivering water.
I find that when the 7.5 gallon water tank is full it will start pumping
fairly easily but after a gallon or two is gone I have to blow into the
top of the water tank, pressurizing it, before I can get it to start
pumping.  I assume that the pump diaphragm or seal needs to be replaced.
Anyone have any ideas about this?  Can I fix it myself?

Another thing, it was warm this weekend and we were driving mostly on
country roads at about 55-60 mph with with windows open.  With all that
wind noise it was difficult to hear the stereo.  What solutions have 
you all found for this?  Travel at night when the windows can stay shut?
headphones wired into the stereo somehow?  Get a louder stereo?

Thanks for any advice!
