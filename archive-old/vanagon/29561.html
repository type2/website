Only a minor quibble and some comments ...

&gt; I didn't get any word re: the soon to be VR6 EuroVan replacement, be
&gt; it the EuroVan or Sharan.  Perhaps someone who went to the show
&gt; can pass along some encouraging words.

The Sharan and the Eurovan (Transporter generation 4) are different class 
products.  Dodge sells both Caravans and Ram Vans in the same way.  In 
leafing through a magazine at the grocery store I read the the most 
likely way for the Saharan to come into the US is as Mazda's replacement 
for their MPV.  Wouldn't that be bizarre?

&gt; Speaking of which, at the
&gt; prices some of the auto mfrs. are asking for cars, those of us looking
&gt; for 6 cylinder power in our vans best be hanging around your favorite
&gt; Porsche recycler.

&gt; Also seen outside the show (Moscone Ctr), was a white EV MV (non poptop)
&gt; with all sorts of nastiness to spread about VW, for example:
&gt; On the back window:  &quot;My VW Mistake&quot;
&gt; then in smaller print something about plastic bumpers, hidden repairs not
&gt; disclosed, side mounted gas tanks, blah, blah, blah....
&gt; Did you know that VW stood for &quot;be Very Wary of (Volkswagen)&quot;?
&gt; Wow!  I learn something new every day!

I would have thought anybody buying a car would have noticed the 
bumpers.  Yes they are the 'modern' plastic coated type.  So?  I've had 
more trouble with the metal bumper on my '93 S10 Chevy pickup than the 
plastic covered one on my '93 EV MV.  Hidden repairs?  Thats sounds like 
a dealer thing more than a VW thing if it is a repair really worth 
whining about its another thing.  Sounds like the Southern (forget which 
state) whiner who sued BMW on behalf of everybody (but wasn't planning on 
sharing the booty).  Haven't heard that the EV is a flaming death trap.  
Has anybody else?

&gt; I was just wondering why, if this guy/gal had such a bone to pick, didn't
&gt; s/he just ditch the thing and get something else (like the dreaded Chrysler
&gt; products)?

Cause the Chrysler is worse?
