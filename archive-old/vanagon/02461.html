Subject: Need Cheep Sorce for VW Filters
Date: Fri, 29 Jul 94 21:35:02 18000

   I need a cheep source for VW oil and air filters, The dealer here wants 
$10 for the oil filters and $20 bucks for each fan belt. Does anyone have 
a favorite mail order company that sells the original parts. It seem like 
the price here is marked up, or is this the going price?
