This message from Cetin Seren may be of interest to those who expressed
interest in the controller. Apparently, alternators on newer cars are
equipped with the low-consumption smart voltage comparator chip.

&gt;All European cars 75 and up have these solid state regulators -- a lot
&gt;cheaper to manufacture and they last much longer, and they are much
&gt;moer sensitive...  It took the U.S. automotive industry a little
&gt;longer to catch up, as usual...
&gt;
&gt;In terms of pulling them from junkyards, they are usually  these
&gt;little inch-sized (or smaller) little cubes piggy-backed on the
&gt;alternators -- rectifier and voltage regulator all in one.
