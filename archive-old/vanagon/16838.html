So Vahid Lajevardi says:
&gt; 
&gt; Dear VWers,
&gt; 
&gt; I am doing a mini rebuild on my 80 vanagon. By mini rebuild I mean I am
&gt; changing the cylinders and pistions but do not spliting the cranckcase open.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything has proceeded well except I can't get the piston pin out.
&gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Vahid

I presume you mean the circlips that hold the wrist pins in.  You need a 
special set of pliers that have various pins to use on the tips.  I forgot
what they're called but most parts houses have them.  Ask the guy at the
counter.  They SHOULD know what you're looking for.  I don't know of any
home made tool that can remove them.  They're worth the purchase IMO.
