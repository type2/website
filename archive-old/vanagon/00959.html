Looked at some Michelin 'X' P205-70-14 and some &quot;metric radials&quot; also by them.
The 'P' tires had an 88,000 mile treadwear guarantee and the metrics had a
lower treadlife. Question what are the differences between 'P' tires and
metric radials? $20 each, yeah I know that. COSTCO price for the 'P's was
about $72 US. The tire specialist (ha!) at COSTCO explained the differences by
saying there weren't really any.
