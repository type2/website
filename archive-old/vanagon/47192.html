Subject: help with changing coolant?

Here I am again asking for help, but I'd rather learn how to do this once 
than pay someone else to do it each time.  Actually, I can't even find 
someone to pay to do it without one week's notice.

I've talked to a local VW mechanic, and he says that it's pretty easy to 
change the coolant.  He also said that the Bentley manual makes it sound 
more complicated than it is, and he explained the procedure to me.

So, is there anyone who'd be willing to help me do this (somewhere on the 
east coast)?  

Thanks,
david
