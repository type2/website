Jim (i think)
you might want to check out the Muir Pub. Rabbit book for testing the 
O2 sensor with a battery and a dwell meter. If you cant find it email me back

Btw, the normal mode of failure for O2 sensors is  that they get sluggish,
rather than dying completely - I dont know what happens electrically
when they go.
