Subject: Spreadin' like cancer!

Hello everyone in VWworld-
I'm seeking strong advice on what to do with my '78 beloved, pride and joy=
 transporter.  She's running beautiful and the interior clean, however, we=
 have a bit of rust running along the lower edge, practically around the=
 entire body.  I am at point now that I need to invest some $$$$$ for long=
 term purpose, and I want to keep her running forever!  But, do I buy a body=
 in good shape and transfer my engine, or fix the body I have?  What are=
 some good points to keep in mind?  I'm in St. Louis, Missouri -land of=
 salty winter streets and horrid humid summers.  The rust is spreading fast!=
       HELP!!!!         Thanx, Dori    =20
                                                    My VW doesn't drip oil
                                                     It just marks it spot!
