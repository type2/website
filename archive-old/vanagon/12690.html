I can bring chili fixin's and a 4-gallon stainless pot.  If we
want to do a communal chili mess.  I'll bring bread too.  My neighbor
said I could use their breadmaker machine (looks like R2D2).

I brewed another batch of beer this weekend. It's a porter.
If it's ready in time for RedRock I'll bring some of that too.
I'll name it &quot;Jack's Transporter Porter.&quot;
