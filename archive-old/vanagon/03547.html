I'm new to this list and not a mechanic so please bear with me.

TIRES   I bought a 77 Camper about two years ago. I figured when one of 
the worn out tires blew it was time to replace the set. I called a dozen 
different places and received a dozen different reccommedations including 
three different Michelins (XZX, LTX, ?). Rather than risk retreads or 
wait for some order to come in or buy something I didn't know about I 
went to Sears to check out what they had available. I settled on their LT 
Trailhandler ATs. My manual says my vehicle takes 185/75/14 reinforced or 
load C. The LT Trailhandler ATs are 195/75/14, 6-ply and load C rated. 
I've only had them a month but I can tell you they're quiet on the 
highway and great on forest service roads. Whether I made the right 
choice or not I don't know, but so far so good.

GAS CAP   Every time I filled the tank I'd get gas fumes in the bus for 
about the next hundred miles, especially when I turned a corner. I was 
also concerned that someone might try either taking gas or putting 
something else in so I looked around for a locking cap. I found one 
reasonably priced at K-Mart. Didn't solve the fume problem but did secure 
the tank.

FUME PROBLEM   My mechanic replaced a short section of fuel line where it 
bends in the rear air intake. That seemed to help somewhat but not 
completely. He says the next thing to check is the filler neck. Anyone 
have this problem and know a solution?

HEATER   OK, I've had my share of ice-box winter driving here around the 
foothills of the Rockies. Anyone know of an effective non-smelly, 
heat-producing solution? I've gotten suggestions ranging from auxillary 
gas to plug-in electrical heaters. My camper has two batteries, I'm not 
sure how they work in tandem with each other, so I should have enough
juice to handle a plug-in heater of some kind. But what kind? Regular 
outlet plug or cigarette lighter plug? My bus doesn't have a lighter.

FAQ   Does this list have an FAQ I can access?

FORD/VW   Reading about the Quest/Villager on this list reminded me of a 
brief article in Popular Mechanics about two months back. Something about 
those vehicles needing an update in the near future and about a joint 
Ford/VW van which is marketed in Europe.

VW/Winnebego   I thought this joint venture was basically the VW Eurovan 
with the camping component manufactured and installed by Winnebago. Am I 
mistaken? Is there a completely different vehicle out there somewhere?

MUFFLER   Where can I find a decent muffler system? I did my calling 
around routine and got an earfull of answers, mostly that the muffler 
system for the bus is pretty complex and scare. I admit to being somewhat 
taken aback when I was quoted $275. For a muffler? Anyway, so I went to 
Midas. (I know, I know.) They ended up having to special order one from 
Dallas. Just takes a few days. Right. Four weeks later no muffler. My 
mechanic recommends a shop, I drive over and get a muffler, $95. One year 
later and now a pipe (Y-pipe?) leading to the muffler has a hole in it 
and now I'm told this is the weak link in the VW muffler and it costs 
about $100 itself. Is this for real?

Many thanks,
John
