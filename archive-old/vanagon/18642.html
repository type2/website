Subject: me and my bus

About a year ago I bougth a 72 camper.  Well its 1.7 engine needs work, lots
of work.  I removed it and took it apart.  It needs new a new camshaft, and
cylinders and pistons.   I also need to replace some little things and
rebuild the heads.

My questions are... 
1)  Is this a good thing to do myself(rebuild engine). 
2)  If #1 is yes, were is a good place to get quality parts at resonable
price.  
3)  Is is possible to rebuild the heads myself(except for the machine part).

I have only replace pistions on a 74 yamaha 650 and replace an engine on a 85
lebaron.   Any hit and stuff would also be helpful.

I already have muir's(real cool), bentley's(not as helpful), and the less
than helpful chiltons books.

Thanks much
