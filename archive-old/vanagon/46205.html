Subject:       '88 Rear Engine mount *bent*!

While checking things out after our last backroads trip, I noticed my 
rear engine mount is not quite right. It's the bar which hangs under 
the rear of the engine suspended from the frame rails. It appears the 
bar itself is straight, but the mounting points on the frame rails 
are actually bent, as if the bar had hit ground a few times (which is 
has, incidentally...)

So... my questions are: 

Should I worry about this &amp; get it straightened out?

Should I avoid hitting the ground with this bar in future (*don't* 
laugh, please...). When driving rough roads, this bar and the plastic 
front air dam are the *only* parts so far to have hit anything. I can 
now anticipate when the airdam will hit &amp; slow down, but I have 
missed a few good bumps and had the rear engine mount hit pretty hard 
once or twice. 

If I should *really* avoid this, is there a way to increase clearance 
without too much expense?
