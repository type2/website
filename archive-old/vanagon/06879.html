&gt;I went looking for a &quot;generic&quot; O2 sensor for my '86 (3 wire) without much
&gt;luck, the cheapest I could find was $140 (NAPA).
&gt;Could anyone who has bought one recently (for a reasonable price)
&gt;send along the brand and part #?

well ... it's been a while since i replaced mine, and the prices have just
about gone through the roof. i called the vw dealer in atlanta and his LIST
price is $149.95 (for the vw part). normally, he lets me have 15 percent off
so that's $128.

the FLAPS here says they can get a 'universal 3-wire' for $60 or an 'original
bosch' for $120. both of these do NOT have the correct connectors on the
wires and you have to splice them in to what is on the bus (or put your old
connectors on the sensor wires).

one story i heard was that you could take the old one to a ford dealer and
get a new one there pretty cheap ... but the $*%&amp;# ford dealer here wants
to know which year/model/color/dealer-you-bought-it-from about the car it
came from. it might be worth a try in your area.
