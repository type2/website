Subject: Gas Cap


	I am sorta in the market for a gas cap for a '77 if
someone has one laying around that they would like to part
with in trade for $$.  Wally Mart sells locking ones that
supposedly will fit, but I really dislike llaves.

	Also, I finally got my oil temp gauge hooked up
and working.  ITs pretty nifty to watch the needle go up when
you are going uphill, and down when you are going downhill.

	Unfortunately, my gas gauge needle always seems to move down,
unless I am turning right :)
