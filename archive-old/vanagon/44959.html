Subject: Re: more oil temp

If you take the reading from the bottom of the sump you'll get the oil at
it's coolest reading.  The dipstick gets the reading from higher up in the
sump, which makes it more representative.  Remember, heat rises.  Bill
Fischer (and/or Berg) say that the best place is after the oil leaves the
cooler.  But that isa problem in aircooled VWs.

&gt;one question:  where is the best place to put a temp sensor that doesnt
&gt;require case drilling or engine removal?  why would a dipstick sender be
&gt;better than a sump sender (as mentioned earlier to be the advice of gene
&gt;berg)?  this placement is just below the dipstick, anyway.
