Subject: Re: Border crossings

I'm hopefully taking a trip in my '62 bus (um, yeah) to France driving
thro' Belgium to Holland, sailing back to UK from Holland. I have
some doubts as to the smoothness of my re-entry into the country
coming from the Land of Sin, in a Split, accompanied by a Long-
Haired Young(ish) Man.
Advice? I guess the law is different here than in the States - anyone
know? Any UKers on the list actually done this?

More questions to come about this trip..

Sarah
