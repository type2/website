Subject: Greetings, '66 Kombi for sale


Greetings, bus lovers!  I'm glad to see the list off and running.  Sadly, 
however, I will not have a bus for very long.. Sigh.

I am being forced to sell my '67 Kombi.  I have been offered (a nice) car 
as a graduation present, one one condition: sell the bus.  Since I need 
the car, the bus must go.

It's not a gem.  It has the standard rust on the front floor panels, 
rocker under the cargo doors, ect..  Needs 'ding' work on the body, but 
most of it is in decent shape (except the dog legs).  Engine is tired.  
Interior has been removed from the front seats back (it is a walkthrough).

It does have a almost new ( &lt; 2k) set of Goodyear Aquatred tires on it.

It is also cheap.  I'm asking $800, but I am willing to haggle.  It is 
located in Bothell, WA (a suburb of Seattle), and pictures are available 
to be sent to you.

I'd also be willing to trade the aquatreds and wheels for a cheapy set 
and cash.  Also up for grabs is the radio (which is original, a one year 
only size if I'm not mistaken).  Email me for more info!

Thanks (for listening to my blather),

- Erston
