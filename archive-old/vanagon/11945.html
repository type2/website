Subject: Anyone have a Eurovan Diesel?

&gt;    I'm considering the diesel over the gas version, mainly because of its fuel 
&gt;   economy (I realize air isn't available in the diesels).  How reliable is the 


Interesting.   I'd say, for the Vanagon westy, (My cousin has an '87 gas and
I have the '81 diesel), You're definitely better off with the gas.  The 
gas one gets about the same miles/gallon if you drive it gently.  The Diesel
Westy is said to get 28 mpg, but I never got better than 23-24 --  with the
diesel, your foot tends to floor the accelerator at all times.
