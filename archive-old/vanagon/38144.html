Subject: Re: Spotted EV Camper in Key West


Jeff, what you described was either a Winnebago Ev, or could have been a 
Westy EV. However, if it was a Westy EV, it was probably a Canadian vehicle, 
as the only Westy version of the EV to be sold in the States was the MV 
Weekender, which was the MV with a poptop, louvered window on the driver's 
side and a small electric cooler under the rear jumpseat.

However, the Westphalia versions are ALIVE AND WELL in Europe. There are 
three major types of Westy T4s build and sold overthere. There's the 
&quot;Weekender MV&quot; like the one we got here in 93...there's the traditional 
pop-top camper, and there's one with a raised roof which has a bunk for two, 
sliding glass windows and a couple of large storage cabinets in the forward 
part of the roof.
