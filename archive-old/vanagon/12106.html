So Richard says:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. How big (capacity) are late model tanks?

16 gallons.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. How big are vanagon tanks?

16 gallons.

&gt; 3. What's the biggest tank you can fit in a '67 bus?

Depends on where you want it.  In the same place, I doubt if there
is room for a larger unit.  In the bus?  I think that would be unsafe.
On top?  Unsafe too.  

&gt; 
&gt; 4. when changing gas tanks, you must also put in the new sending unit
&gt; along with the new tank, correct? 

Are you talking about for the fuel gauge?  I don't think a new one
is necessary since the accuracy of these gauges are vague at best.

Just my $.02.
