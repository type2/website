Subject:       Eurovan Double Cab Pickup

Hi All.  I saw a 1992 Eurovan Double Cab Pickup truck today in the 
Vancouver, BC area.  It had the fold down sides like the Vanagon and 
previous types as well.  It sure looked strange.  The roof line had 
deep V grooves on either end of the roof to act as rain channels (I 
guess), and 4 doors with external hinges.  It was a chalky blue 
colour.  It wasn't in the best shape (or clean) but the owner seemed 
quite content.  The rear wheels even had it's own round fenders.  

I must admit that it looked weird.  Anybody else seen one of these in 
North America??

Harry.
