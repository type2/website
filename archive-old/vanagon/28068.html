Subject:      Re: Winnebago EV

To answer Dan's questions about the 5-cylinder engine, as I understand it,
its been around for some time in the Audi 5000 and their decendants. I
haven't had the piston slap problem and have been satisfied with the per-
formance and mileage (21 Hiway 16-17 City).THe only time I've found the engine
to be not strong enough is accelerating into an interstate hiway from a comp
lete stop. Otherwise it's find. However I would expect that with the longer
Winnebago EV the engine would be somewhat weaker. One of the popular auto
mags did an article on the camper (but not in its Winnebago version). For
the reference go to Autosite_dot_com under 93 EV. We like the engine in the front
and the front-wheel drive.

Hope that helps.
