You need to check the following:

* Pressure cap, make sure the valve is not blown out and that it can maintain
set pressure.  Just replace it, cheap insurance.  Also make sure the cooling
system is properly filled and bleed.  Must also have proper mixture.  Straight
water or antifreeze is no good.
* Internal cylinder head leaks.  Combustion gasses getting into the cooling
system will vapor lock the pump keeping water from flowing.  Have a leak down
test performed.  Also check that the heat always works.  Intermittent heat is
the first sign of this problem.
* Blocked radiator.  Keeps water from flowing when t-stat fully opens.  I
doubt this but check any way.
* Cracked radiator baffle.  This is a good one.  Radiator has to be removed so
you can look inside. If the separator cracks, water can enter and leave the
radiator with out actually flowing through.  This will cause all sorts of
weirdness.  Overheating after highway run is most obvious.  At  high engine
speed, the pump moves enough water so that the radiator can still provide some
cooling.  Back at idle, most of the water that flows bypasses the radiator and
the switch to turn on the cooling fan.  This will result in an overheated
engine if left unchecked.

Hope this helps,
Dennis
