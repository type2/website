Subject:      Timing Notch? on 2.1 Digifant

I have some confusion regarding the timing notches on the flywheel:
-------------^---------F
-----u-----------------R
When setting the timing (Temp Sender II disconnected, revs at 2000 rpm)
which notch gives the required 5 degree ahead of TDC? In other words
which notch is which if either?
