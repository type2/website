Subject: Questions

        Hmmm, nobody responded to my questions that I posted a couple days
ago (sigh). I feel
unloved. :(
        But anyhow, Ill just ask em again.

1) while I was fixing my rear windsheild wiper problem, I removed the fluid
container from inside the rear passenger side wall and noticed that some
fluid must have leaked out, resulting in a bit of
rust inside the walls over the rear wheels. Should I just scrape this away
and throw some promer on it or what?

2) Im having a heck of a time finding paint that matches my westfalia. I
just want a small amount so that I can do touch-ups on scratches etc to
prevent rust from starting. All my FLAPS have VW paint, but none for vans
or westies. Do I have to go to a dealership for this or what?

3) Does anyone know of any Canadian west coast VW meetings, or get
togethers? I'd like to fit one into my summer vacation if possible.

Unmotivated at work.
