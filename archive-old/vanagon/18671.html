I have a diesel '82 Westfalia in great shape, except for a scratch/
dent that runs along the passenger side, low, where I encountered
the bumper of another vehicle.  Estimates to fix this run around
$500.  So, before getting it fixed and then advertising it in the
Seattle Times for $5500 and being negotiable down to $5000, I am
offering to sell it for $4500 firm.  A fabulous camper van, with
stoves, swiveling seats, fold-up sleeper top, etc.
