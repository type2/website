Subject:  2nd nonstarting clarification

Hey all,
Forget everything I said about the relay in my past two posts.  Found out
by tracing the wire that it is part of the dealer-installed air conditioning
system.  Duh!  Anyway, I guess that leaves the solenoid as the culprit. 
This weekend I will take out the old and put in a new in hopes that it will
cure my problem.  I'll let everyone know if that does the trick.  If that's not
the problem, then I don't know what's up, but I'll cross that bridge if I
come to it.

Thanks for the help everybody,
Sean
