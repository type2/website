Aww, Eugene, what a TERRIBLE story!  Christa is right beside me, and when 
I read your story out loud to her, we were both very saddened.  Our 
hearts go out to you.  I suppose your bus sacrifed itself for you, since 
it looks like you walked away from what could have been an absolutely 
horrific accident.  I hope your insurance company doesn't jerk you 
around, and that you can find a new '71 westy to fill the hole left in 
your life from the demise of your last one.

I'm just glad as hell you're o.k.  I dread the day we hear about one of 
us actually getting hurt (or worse) by DWI bozos.  I figure that getting 
behind the whell of a car, even once, with too much to drink should 
disqualify the driver from ever holding a liscence again. The stakes are 
too high, and I've lost a couple friends to DWI drivers.  I'm so glad 
you could walk away from this one.

I wish I had a nice '71 to sell you.  Cheap.

Tobin (&amp; Christa)
