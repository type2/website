Sami noted:

&gt;We often get those &quot;courtesy&quot; calls from other insurance or credit card
&gt;companies with &quot;fabulous&quot; introductory rates &quot;until 1997!&quot;. They give
&gt;up when we mention USAA.

I have to add:

The other day I got a call from MCI saying they had a special deal for
me.  I told them I had a special rate thru Sprint with my insurance
company.  The woman thought for a moment and turned some pages, and then
said &quot;Through USAA right?&quot;, I said yes and she hung up the phone.

For once I like my insurance company.

David
