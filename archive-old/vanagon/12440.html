&gt; It rained last night and when I hopped into the '74 this morning I noticed
&gt; a puddle of water on the floor in front on the passengers side. Window open?
&gt; Nope. Went looking around on the outside and found - Yikes! - RUST UNDER THE
&gt; WINDSHIELD!! This must be the result of bad karma from having given Sami so
&gt; much grief about driving in the salt of Missouri. But seriously, what has to
&gt; be done to fix this? Does new metal need to be welded in? Has anybody on the
&gt; list made this repair?

Hahahahahah!!! Sweet Revenge! No, actually, it's quite sad. Had the same
problem on mine when I bought it. Seems to be common place for rust when
the windshield rubber gets old and brittle and water from condensation
gets trapped underneath.

You will have to remove the windshield and then do some bodywork. A
St.Louis VW garage gave me a quote of $700 for the job, so I did it
myself, even though I hate body work. 

Of course, don't get your new seal from VW. They charge you an arm &amp; a
leg. And let a professional put the windshield back in. (I cracked mine.)

Good luck, Dave!
