Subject: Getting Drums back on '71?

Is there some trick I don't know? Am I forgetting something? After putting
on my new brake shoes and adjusting down my adjusters, I can't get my drums
back on. I've tried centering the shoes, but still, no luck. Should I
remove the drums from the hubs and try it in two steps (I know now that I
didn't have to remove the hubs, but I didn't realize that when I started).

Thanks for all your advice and patience with me. 8-)

And HAAAAAAAAAPPY Friday! Yippee, two days to work on the van (between
watching kids and cartoons)!

Thanks! Joe Fournier
