Subject: Re: expectations from 67 sitting for 14 years

hi

i dont know what climate the bus was sitting in for 14 years, but if the
engine still runs, its not too wet.

I'd check the metal lines visually for any obvious rust, probably its ok.
  You might need to replace the ones in the back.   I'd just rebuild the
brakes and flush out the system.

why rebuild the motor if you dont need to?  this i dont understand.   Check
for end play by grabbing the crank pulley with both hands and push pull- it
should be tight.  if it goes clunk clunk its getting worn.   Pull up and down
too.   Do a compression test.   I'd pull the motor, replace the main seal,
oil cooler seals, and all fuel line.   Check the engine compartment seal
around the motor.  

While youre at it,  take out the tank and knock any rust loose and dump it
out.  look inside and see if the gas turned to black tar, or if pine cones
were inserted by friendly squirrels.    take out the sender and see if it
works.   hows the rear trans seal and throw out bearing?  Are there mouse
nests in the heat ducts?   Do change oil in the trans, and check in in a few
hundred miles for guck.   Does the starter work properly?  its easier to get
to with the motor out.

id take out the wiper motor and grease it up too. and grease the front end.
 Dont forget the kingpins.

and enjoy your bus.  you'll drive happier knowing that its been gone over
thoughroughly, or it will let you know when it needs attention.

 :)  clara
