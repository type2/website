RON,

  The good news is I've been driving your Wonderful Vanagon the last 
week, (60) total and the stove works, I've yet to fire up the Fridge but 
the Propane tank had propane in it !!  I didn't need to fill it, to me 
thats a great sign in it self.

  This week end it will get full attention fridge faucet and switch! 
AC/DC ECT.

  When you open the rear hatch on the roof there is the textured 
wallpaper type stuff gluded and stapled to the underside of the cabinet. 
 When I went and got the van it had peeled off almost all the way.  I 
glued it back up after removing the rubber mouldings and had it up 
pretty well but after a week it is peeling off again!

  I need to know what you want done with it.  It has 3 small cracks in 
it due to it's brittleness and I think it may be the best thing to 
remove it all the way and recover with something else.  Let me know what 
to do, It makes it hard to see out the rear window while driveing too.

  Waiting for your e-mail and instructions Captain.
