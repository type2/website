Subject: Busses &amp; Baby Grand Pianos

FYI: you _can_ move a baby grand piano in a Bus.  However,
I don't advise it, for a number of reasons.  

The piano, carefully disassembled, made it fine.  My lower
back is ruined, (there's nowhere to stand if you're inside,
on the receiving end!  Nowhere!) there's a big rip in the
once-pristine headliner, and a nasty gash in the back of the
passenger-seat headrest, which I suppose is better than a
nasty gash in the back of the passenger's head.

The Bus accelerated fine, but handled with a noticeable
squirm at 65 mph, and took a looong time to stop.  But, we
made it in good order, getting home just ahead of a bit of
freezing rain.  

All's well that ends well. This was a stupid idea and I'll
never do it again.  Merry Monday!
