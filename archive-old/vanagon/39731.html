Yes, the fuel hoses with the woven fabric were called &quot;self locking&quot; and no
clamp was needed.  However, I don't know what the expected life was nor how
long they were expected to stat &quot;locked&quot;

&gt;In some cases these fuel lines don't even have
&gt;clamps! Was this a policy with brand-new VW bugs and buses? If so, it may
&gt;be fine when they're new. But when they get old, they loosen up, eventually
&gt;pop off, and spray fuel all over your nice, sparky generator and/or
&gt;distributor.
