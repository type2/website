Ari and other muse about Nissan sentras with WIIIIIIIDE wheels...

in my neck of the woods the &quot;hot&quot; car is the mid 80's Toyota
Corolla 1.8L Fastbacks....with the WIIIIDDE wheels, the 
boom-boxes, but with, of all things...the 4 ring emblem
from Audi 5000's attached to the front grille with bailing
wire....

Of course the Toyota HAS to be painted in grey primer until
the &quot;underachieving-automotive-designer&quot; steals enough mone
to get a paint job after the rear-seat has been torn out for
the kicker boxes...
