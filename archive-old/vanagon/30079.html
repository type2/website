Subject: Rust free inN.E?


Hello all,

	I've finally decided to retire my '71 bus. Too much rust.
I am of course keeping the engine, brakes, etc, which all work well.
So now I'm looking for a '71 or earlier bus , but is it possible to find rust free (or nearly rust free) bus in the NorthEast?

If anyone has any info, I'd appreciate it...
thanx
