&lt;&lt; What we need more than anything right now are Deluxe bus parts (outside
trim sets or pieces, bumper trim sets or pieces, inside grab handles in good
cond, vent wing windows w/latches,rear inside corner removable headliner
pieces[oilboard], and a lot of other stuff that we use on a daily basis. &gt;&gt;

I may have some of the Deluxe pieces you are looking for.  I have at least
one full set of corner window belt line trim...maybe two. Also have Corner
window, glass and other misc. parts.  Drop me line and let me know what you
need.
