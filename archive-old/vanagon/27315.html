Subject: Rusty Windshield?

Ken,

Regarding your windscreen seals, your short-term options are the use of
composites -- fiberglas.  But since proper execution of either composite or
welded metal repair depends on preparation, you're looking at about the same
number of man-hours, the only savings will be not having to hire a weldor a
weldor.

Preparation involves removal of the package tray, which involves
disconnecting and removing our speedometer cable.  Start with that; insure
the cable is free and CAN be removed.  There is a rubber sleeve on the inner
end of the spindle that sometimes becomes so clogged with oily dirty that it
makes it impossible to easily remove the cable.  Key word: Easily.  You can
get it out but you may have to work at it.

Once the speedo cable is free, disconnect it from the speedo head, pull it
out, coil it up and store it in a bag.  It takes only a small amount of grit
on the cable to ruin it.

With the speedo cable out of the way the package tray is a no-brainer...
except you'll have to loosen the steering wheel shaft from the bottom of the
speedo head housing, and.  Just do what is necessary to have the package tray
on the bench.  Then go around and unbolt your wipers.  Be sure not to lose
any of the hardware because it is rare stuff.  The object of removing the
package tray was the removal of the wipers, which must be removed so we deal
with any rust we find in the windscreen area.

Back inside the car, remove your wiper switch from the dash but leave all of
the wires attached.  Find the hot wire from the fuse block to the wiper motor
and remove it.  Then tag it.  Masking tape and a magic marker is the handiest
tool for marking your wiring.

Unbolt the single 10mm bolt securing the wiper motor to the frame of the
vehicle and work the wiper arms out of their grommets and the wiper
motor/arms out of the car.

Now is the time to protect everything.  Use heavy gauge plastic sheeting.
 Not drop-cloth stuff but the 3- or 5-mil vapor barrier used in construction.
 You may also use meat paper, heavy brown paper or multiple layers of
newspaper but the plastic is the best choice since it will withstand
sandblasting.  (SANDBLASTING?  [Calm down, I'll get to that in a minute.] )

Did I mention removal of the carpet/floor mat?  Ummmm... I probably should of
mentioned that.

The object of doing all this is to insure the repair of your leaky windshield
doesn't leave the bus in worse condition than before.  The only way to be
sure you've removed all of the rust is to go after it with abrasives, and
sandblasting is the most cost effective method of abrasive rust removal.
 Don't even think about chemicals at this point, we are dealing with a purely
mechanical problem.

You will want to insert a couple of small sheet metal screws in the door
pillars on the latching-side of your front doors, right up near the lower
edge of the headliner.  Run a strand of bailing wire from the screw to the
overhead vent and down to the other screw.  Rig a plastic curtain from the
wire; use duct tape and ingeniuity; the object is to seal off the rear of the
vehicle from the cockpit.

Remove your sun-visors.  If you leave them in, bag them and tape them to the
overhead, but it's best to remove them.  After the sand-blasting you will
probably drive the vehicle home.  If you fail to remember all the places
where the sand-blasting residue has settled you'll go blind about a block
from the house.  If you do the sand-blasting at home and forget about the
visors, you'll usually remember when you are doing the painting, about a
millisecond after you bump the sand-laden visor.

Away from the vehicle, you should have positioned your metal-prepping
supplies, your paint and your composite materials.  If you are not familiar
with the use of composites on steel structures, this is not the place to
learn.

You should also have your replacement windshield seals on-hand preferrably in
a pan of warm water containing some glycerine.

Go ahead and cut out the glass.  Since you aren't making a business of
auto-glass removal, don't bother with the special knife, although it does
make things easier.  Use the sharpest knife you have or a single-edged razor
if you like to bleed.  You can sharpen a knife as sharp as a razor if you put
your mind to it; just keep graduating up the scale of abrasives and do the
final stropping on leather.  Keeping the blade wet with glycerine during the
cutting makes an amazing difference in how easily the knife slips, often
right off the window and into your hand.  Be cool.

The object is to cut the seal away from both the glass and the metal.  Slide
your knife/razor/what-ever along the glass with the blade virtually parallel
to the pane, penetrate the rubber and commence drawing the blade downward.
 You're going to be surprised at how tough that old, cracked rubber will be.
 Start in one of the upper corners and cut down, then do the other corner,
then do the top.  That's usually enough to allow the glass to be pressed out
of the seal.  Treat it gently and stow it carefully.  

With the glass removed the seal will peel away from the bus, often taking
some of the bus with it.  I've described preparations for a worse-case
scenario but with a bit of luck your windows won't be that bad.

If your bus is more than ten years old and still has the factory seals, the
metal is going to be rusty underneath.  Seals are inexpensive and aren't too
difficult to replace but for some reason it's a chore no one bothers to
tackle until the rain fills up their shoes, ruins the wiper motor and rots
out the cockpit floor.  Go figure.

The big question is: 'How much rust do I have?' and the only answer is to
pull the seals and find out.  The worse-case is to discover the flange rusted
away and holes in the body-work.

Whatever amount of rust you have, get rid of it.  Totally.  Back to bare
metal and an inch or two to either side.  Sandblasting is the best way but
I'll leave you to make your own mistakes.  Immediately after sandblasting,
prep the metal with a phosphoric acid solution.  An auto-paint supplier will
put you on the right track.  Follow the instructions.  Use repeated
applications.  Keep the surface saturated until ready to neutralize; paper
towels and strips of clean rags will help when dealing with the overhead
panels; use plastic and duct tape to keep things in position.  

The phosphoric acid solution will alter the compostion of the infinite
surface left by the sandblasting, a surface that would otherwise rust faster
than a politician can lie and which if left untreated could make the
situation even worse than it was.

Once the surface is treated it must be neutralized.  Once neutralized it must
be dried.  If working in damp or cold weather, provide some means of drying
the surface quickly.  A hair dryer will work, a heat-shrink gun will work
better.  A lot of guys use propane powered radiant heaters, very handy things
for warming rubber seals... if you're careful.

Cleaned, prepped and neutralized, you may then prime the surface for painting
if it does not need major repair.  Or prime it anyway, planning to do a
fiberglas repair -- you want the surface either in-work or protected.

The rust is usually found only on the lower flange, more toward the outboard
corner than the centerline.  The usual repair is to weld in a new flange
locally fabricated from metal of suitable thickness.  The welding will of
course entrail some grinding and the work may be extensive if the wiper
cut-outs are involved, but if you tackle it a bit at a time a welded repair
is not all that difficult and is always the best choice; Volkswagens are made
of steel, not fiberglas.

If you wish to use fiberglas for the repair you should have some experience
with composities and with the unique problems of bonding composites to steel
structures.  In most cases the fiberglas repair will result in a new,
rust-proof flange only to produce rust under some other portion of the repair
a few years later.  Repair of an improperly  done composite repair is more
difficult than doing a welded repair.

The best composite repair is to build a mold of the shape you wish to produce
using rigid urethane foam.  You can glue the foam to the dashboard then sand
it to shape.  This will put gravity on your side as you do the lay-ups and
fills.  Covering the urethane with heat-smoothed plastic sandwich wrap will
impart a glass-smooth surface to the finished lay-up.

The lay-up should progress in two steps, first laying up two or three layers
of fine twill-woven six-ounce fabric saturated with a suitable epoxy resin.
 Surface with peel-ply and allow to cure.  Strip off the peel-ply. trim for
height, lay in a build-up of saturated chopped cotton fiber to form the
fillet then do the finish lay-up with two or three layers, the first layer
being the widest, the other(s) narrower.  The stepped layers will be easier
to blend in to the contour.  If properly done, the repaired flange will have
exactly the same contour as the metal flange it replaced but will be stronger
and impervious to rust.

Once the lay-up has cured, grind to finished size and blend the layers into
the contours of the nose.  Prime and paint.

Installation of the windows is covered in the various manuals.  The basic
idea is to lay the window on something that leaves the edges free so as to
allow the seal to be fitted to the glass.  Once satisfied with the fit, embed
a piece of strong twine into the channel that will fit over the flange,
crossing the ends of the twine at the bottom-middle-inner surface of the
seal.  The glass and seal are then set into the opening with the flange
fitted into the channel of the seal.  The twine and lots of lubricant is then
used to force the seal over the flange by someone inside of the vehicle while
a second person presses on the pane from the outside.  And if you think this
sounds tough, a pro would have the glass installed in five minutes or less
working entirely on his own.

The real problem with doing your windshield is that you are doing two
different jobs, body work and glass installation.  And you'll probably be
under the gun to do it as quickly as possible so you can get the bus back on
the road.  And cheaply, too.  This combination usually results in a crappy
job.

Here are some tricks you may wish to consider:  You can drive the bus without
the package tray and steering column re-enforcing plate.  You may also drive
without the speedometer being connected.  That means you could do those tasks
well ahead of the windscreen replacement.

There are other forms of windscreen seals including a type that pops in from
the outside and is locked into place by inserting a rubber tube into an
easily accessible groove on the outer face of the shield.  Peel the tube out
of the groove and the glass comes away in your hands.  Using something like
this would allow you to do a flange repair on a piece-meal basis,
re-inserting the window between sessions.  This also applies to the final
paint; a temporary seal allowing you to drive the vehicle while still wearing
its primer coats, removing the glass for sanding and additional painting as
time allows.

Operating without windshield wipers is not legal in most states, but most
state laws do not specifically say the wiper must be OPERATING, only that the
vehicle must be 'equipped' with them.  Treating your windscreen with Glass-X
or other dispersant will allow you to drive in the rain without the use of
your wipers; you can leave them out until all of the body-work repair
associated with the windscreen is completed.

As with most things, prevention is less expensive than repairing.  Windshield
seals are about twelve bucks each from J.C.Whitney (Oct 1995).  If kept clean
and treated with a protectant, your rubber seals will remain tight for up to
ten years, longer if the the vehicle is garaged.  At the first sign of aging
the seals should be replaced, dealing with any rust found in the process.  In
this way things never get too bad and the cost is spread out in manageable
ten-year bites.
