Well, I guess I'm the only one who's ever had any problems with the power
steering ?  I got just one response so far from someone who told me his
pump failed, ate up the rotor inside the pump.  This is not my problem. 
The pump is still turning and is not leaking.  Yesterday, however the
power steering started to work sporatically.  Some amount of pressure is
now being exerted to the wheels but it is not even nor constant ??  Maybe
there is some kinf of blockage in the fluid path ?  I hope it's not the
pump 'cause after checking around for a pump the other day the best deal I
can find is $569. CND of course.  Lot of bucks for a pump ?  There is a
kit to rebuild consisting of seals, bearings and gaskets that I was
quoated from $140. to $63.  That's a whole 'nother story !   Well,
back to the work bench for more investigative measures.

Cheers

Frank
