Subject: Any experience with VWofCanada

Sorry for the lack of bus content, but I'm just brimming with VW content ;-)

In the next week we will be leasing a car for Caron.  One (or two) of the cars 
we're considering are the Golf CL or one of the base-model-type Jettas.  Now I 
know that VWoA has a really bad reputation and in user satisfaction surveys 
they usually rate very close to the bottom of the pickle barrel.

So I would like to hear any good and bad experiences people have had with VW of 
Canada (especially leases).  The fact that they gave Ron a Eurovan for the 
Inuvik trip is definitely a notch on their steering wheel.  But if anyone has 
had any troubles getting results out of VW for the warranty or if you have been 
shocked by the amazing service, please let me know.

If you are on the vanagon list, please respond directly to me since I am only 
subscribed to the TYPE2 list.

Thanx.
