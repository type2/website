Subject: Re:  Westy Propane Tank

Last week, someone on one of the lists was trying to find a used Westfalia 
propane tank. Not having one, I deleted the message, but if you're still 
out there, I just stumbled on the following ad.  It's a west coast number, 
I think. Haven't called it; this is all I know.

&gt;PROPANE for underneath VW camper, 5&quot; diameter X 24&quot; long, incl
&gt;regulator, etc, cost $250, sell $100  (714) 544-2634
