&gt;snow-covered highways on a red landscape, and 13 starry magnesium fires

Bill,

Yeah, that was some of us.  There's another showing Martha getting ready to
take a bath, stoking a cannon-shaped water heater she's been testing.  But
did you see the one of us crossing the river?  Hell of a winter, eh?
