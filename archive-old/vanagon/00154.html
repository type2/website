Actually, the entire foil was $107, so I doubt the volgate regulator would
be $150 &lt;smile&gt;

Here's what's on the regulator:
ITT      G
89 39
---------------
TCA
700 Y

I haven't checked it out yet.  One of the diodes does look bad. With it 
out of the circuit, there's no continuity in either direction.  I'm going to 
try to replace the lights today and if I can get some diodes, those too.  
If that solves it, I'll post and let youall know.

Thanks!
