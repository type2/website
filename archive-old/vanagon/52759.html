More obviously, it's one that you don't have to crawl underneath
your vehicle to adjust.  However, NEAL hydraulics units work quite well
when converted into the cable style clutch systems.  I've converted many an
old type II with great success.  I wind up using another Early Type II
Master Cylinder and poly tubing.  But once installed, you never have to
turn the wing nut.

&gt; &gt;        I live in Wooster and work right down the road from LuK. LuK 
&gt; &gt;is a
&gt; &gt;German based clutch manufacturer so the chances of a self adjusting vw
&gt; &gt;clutch are not too remote. If you want, I can check with some friends 
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;work there and let ya know.
