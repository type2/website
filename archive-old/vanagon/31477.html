Hi, all

I was driving around today after filling the tank w/
Chevron Supreme (I usually put in Shell reg. unl.) and
I noticed an interesting phenomena; the temp gauge
read just a hair above the 1/4 mark.  It normally
hangs around the 1/2 mark.

Has anyone else noticed such a big difference between
regular and supreme?  I mean, we're talking two (2)
hashmarks here, that's a lot of real estate...

I realize that higher octane runs the engine cooler,
but I didn't think it was THAT much.

BTW, ambient temp. was about 60 F. and driving
was at a steady 60-65 mph.
