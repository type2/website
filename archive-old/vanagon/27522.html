Subject:  van doesn't seem to like damp weather

hello from bright and sunny lansing, michigan, home of the chevrolet
cavalier and the mentality that goes with it.

my last posts of over a month ago were regarding an 81 vanagon
exhibiting an intermittent (but present most days) chirping noise on
acceleration at the lower end of the rev scale, most prevalent in 1st and
2nd, occasionally in 3rd, never in 4th.  i have also been experiencing a
high idle (~1500 rpm) occasionally.  the shop says the chirping is an
exhaust leak, which is too small to locate and repair, after trying the
stethoscope and oil drop in cylinder methods of diagnosis.  i'm not
convinced, because the noise is intermittent, and only occurs after the
engine is warm, but currently lack the knowledge and skill to further
diagnose.  additionally the problem is intermittent, undermining its
perceived seriousness (possibly falsely), and i have put on over 1,000
miles since its start, at the recommendation of the mechanic 'you just
have to wait for it to get worse' (which it has, a lilttle).  yesterday it
clicked in my mind that the noise is more likely to be present in
damp/rainy weather, as evidenced over the past month.

my questions for the more experienced are:  1) is the moisture in the air a
clue or critical to anything which could produce the chirping noise/high
idle, and 2) is the intermittent high idle possibly related to the chirping, and
what might this indicate to look for/at?

aside from this, i could use a crash course on what to look for in an
electrical tester before i buy one so i can do the bentley fi diagnosis (i
would like this to be the only one i buy in my lifetime, but don't have much
$$$).

please respond directly, i'm on digest mode.  as much detail as you have
time for would be appreciated.  thanks very much for any help on any of
this.

p.s. - for the comparison shoppers i have a new addition to the family,
my brother just got a very clean 88 westfalia w/50,000 miles for $13,500
in southern california.
