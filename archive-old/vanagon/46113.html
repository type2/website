&gt; The immersible water pump was used on US market Westys from the middle of 82
&gt; (Westy SN C00859 on) thru 91.  Canadian market Westy's used the
&gt; &quot;Outside-of-the-Tank&quot; water pump 80-91. US Models 80-Early 82 (Westy SN
&gt; C00858 and back) used the outside-of-the-tank pump as well.  Trivia - this
&gt; outside pump is the same as used on 74-79 Westy's as well, although VW until
&gt; recently, used two different part numbers.
Ummm, my '88 is a CDN model (as indicated by the lower location of 
the 110V plugin) and it had the immersible also. But, an '83 CDN 
model Westy I looked at did have a factory outside the tank pump, so 
both types were used on CDN models, but I don't know which year they 
changed.

&gt; Immersible pump was made by a company called &quot;Komet&quot; in Germany and was
&gt; recently bought and taken over by VDO in the last year or so.  We buy 'em
&gt; direct from Europe and sell 'em for $49.95US (V_at_L members' price is
&gt; $44.96)(VAG's price is $71.65US at your &quot;friendly&quot; dealer).  Order BBI P/N
&gt; 230-10102
My original pump was a VDO, and the dealer in Newport, Or wanted 
$125US!... If the cheapo pumps dies, I may go back to the immersible, 
since $45 is a bit more reasonable, and the install is tidier.


&gt; Outside-the tank pump is made in USA and we get $39.95US (V_at_L members' price
&gt; is $35.96US)(VAG  is a whopping $105.25US!) and is the identical until sold
&gt; by the so-called &quot;friendly&quot; dealers.  Order BBI P/N 230-10101.  Comes with
&gt; Fuse too.
&gt; 
&gt; The immersible pump on my 84 Westy works fine.  The PO must have had some
&gt; problems, because I found a brand new spare wrapped in plastic in one of the
&gt; closets when I got it a month and a half ago.
