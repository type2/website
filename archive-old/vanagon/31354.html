Subject: Emissions shuffle

After failing emissions by a wide margin, with a newly installed Weber carb,
I returned Scarecrow (my '79 bus) to the mech who had to replace the large
jets with some rather small ones, as well as do some other minor
adjustments.  He advised me to _quickly_ take it back to the emissions
station and come back as soon as possible so he could replace the jets
again.  I can understand why -- the critter runs like a dog with the small
jets in place, jumping and hesitating and barely able to get out of its own
way.  Anyone else have similar problems?  It doesn't seem reasonable to have
to play &quot;musical carbs&quot; in order to pass emissions.  I live in AZ, by the way.

P.S. The oil leak turned out to be a minor problem -- just the oil pressure
valve.  Phew!
