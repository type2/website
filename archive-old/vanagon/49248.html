Subject: Re: 1984 Dennis' opinion of emmision mods/Ed&quot;s Soapboxing(long)

In a message dated 96-09-07 01:18:30 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; The O2 sensor system uses a three way cat to control Hydrocarbons, Carbon
monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen.  The NOX is the real culprit in smog
formation and is the most damageing of the exhaust emissions.  This can only
be tested under load and is why the EPA tried to get states to go to
centralized emissions and dyno testing. Increasing the ignition timing also
increases the production of NOX as it increases the peak flame temparatures
of combustion. By setting the engines the way VW did, they were able to
eliminate a lot of emmission parts such as Air pumps(allows richer mixtures)
and EGR valves(that NOX thing).  &gt;&gt;

Dennis, Thank you for the information but I once was a certified Ca. smog
license holder.I am well schooled in the intracacies of emission control....I
am also a believer in freedom and less gov. restriction. All the crap spewed
by the gov re: auto smog is a pittance compared to the damage done by
industry world wide. For instance, while Calif. kept a hangman's noose on
auto enthusiats in the state and wouldnt allow engine swaps or accessories as
innate as a spare gas tank to be sold w/o CARB certification, we routinely
dealt with junker ....if you prefer GROSS POLLUTER
Mexican junkers coming across the border daily running on 2 cylinders, Ahh
NAFTA....
Figures or not, Im not convinced that the controls need to be as stringent as
they are.1.5 to 2.0 % CO is not a gross polluter by any standards, and 75ppm
HC is efficient...Ok I agree NOX will increase with a cooler burn, but
....will Uncle sam compensate me for my premature engine wear?????I can just
see that government
tow truck stopping by the side of the freeway on the grapevine as I sit with
my GROSSLY OVERHEATED 1.9 vanagon complete with environmentally correct
melted heads._dot_delivering me a free long block to replace mine(oh yes, and a
free mechanic as well).

&lt;&lt;By removing this stuff, you contribute to alot more polution than you think
and you justify the governments desire to regulate your ability to work on
your own car. &gt;&gt; 

The Government will have to pry the wrench from my cold dead hand first(This
is a joke for you serious types out there)

&lt;&lt;This is actualy tampering with the Emission control systems and believe it
or not is actually a Federal offense(who's looking anyway).&gt;&gt; 

Dennis, just remember the Boston Tea Party.Dissent is all american. I prefer
to call it enhancing, rather than tampering.


&lt;&lt; I also have to ask how you pass emissions testing with 2.0%CO.  In New
York, anything 81 and later has to be at 1.2 % or lower,(and idle at 100 rpm
or lower).  As much as California is known for strict emissions requirements,
this limit seems very liberal.  If you consider that your van should run at
under .5%CO, your settings produce 4 times the pollution per mile than it
should. &gt;&gt; 
 
First Dennis, My vehicle does indeed pass Ca. stringent standards at every
test for the last 12 years. Who can say what happens later?Im industrious.
Secondly, Dennis, CO% is not directly proportional to Gr per mi. in
pollutants. Lets take, for instance, that at idle you are _at_ 2.0% but at 2500
rpm(avg. cruising) you are _at_ .7% due to the greater efficiency(check your
infrared if you dont believe me, this is not 4 times , nor is it a per mi.
measure.It merely is a figure which indicates the exhaust gas content,out of
100%, of CO.


&lt;&lt;Although this is a 70's era standard, newer cars should be cleaner and that
difference is one reason we are facing the clunker laws.  The government
wants the old cars off the road.  Believe it or not, 80% of automotive air
pollution is caused by only 20% of the cars on the road.  These cars are
referred to as gross polluters.  The gross polluters are the targets of
emission control programs, junker programs etc.  
  &gt;&gt;
Dennis, the gov. wants the cars off the road because it is some starry eyed
idiot in Washington who has sat in the Ca. sun too long and thinks this will
cure smog....B.S. .... senator... get a life.This is the same stupid rhetoric
spinning out there which is causing the overregulation of:
lawnmowers,weedwackers,blowers,boats and jet skis. Come on...25 years ago
they said the 1968 smog laws would cure air pollution.Now we are going after
old cars and putting cat converters on your favorite lawnboy...EEEEK.Im all
for clean air but at what cost.If this is the case lets outlaw all cars as we
now have them and go electric....Then I can put those super high power ACME
capacitors on my vanagon electric motor and blow those other battery cars off
the road.........Just a thought.

&quot;Will the mojo with the computer mouse in his hand please get down from that
soapbox...............&quot;

Ed
