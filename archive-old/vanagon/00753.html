Subject:      Torsion Bars

Friends, I have been watching with great interest at the river of tips
that flow from this list.  I have a nice '70 camper named Otto who is
starting to sag a bit under the weight of the usual vacation gear.  I
am fully qualified in roadside engine R&amp;R, but have not worked on the
torsion bars because I'm afraid they'll unwind or soemthing.  Could one
of you crack mechanics give me some tips about how to adjust them without
messing them up or getting thrown across the yard?  Thanx,  A VW Van Fan
