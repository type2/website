Aw, come ON!  That just isn't a fair comparison.  Really, to BOTH vehicles,
AND the owners of the VWs that are crazy enough about their vehicles to
actually do their own work and spend LARGE CHUNKS OF TIME (hopefully work
time, right?) subscribing to this great list and keeping their buses
runing!

Tell me true:  Is (read CAN) the THAIYOTER come anywhere near being as much
fun to work on/drive as the old VW?  And, hey, when was the last time you
had somebody on the freeway ask you to open your window to ask you if your
ride might be FOR SALE, while driving 60m's per H?  (I've actually had this
happen twice with my 60 Singlecab, and you should SEE the thing!)

-just my paradigm's worth (That's 20 cents, in case you're wondering).
