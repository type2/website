Subject:       Re: Bob Hoovers &quot;...Hot Rod your VW&quot;

For a minute there I thought you guys had lost it and were referring 
to Clymer's (hack-ptui!) &quot;VW Performance Tuning&quot; (1973) by Eric 
Jorgensen.  Actually an interesting if dated tome, but then again 
they're the ones who can't seem to keep splitties and bay-windows 
separate in their minds in their van manual.  But the section on 
turbochargers makes it worth a few bucks if you ever see it used.

Another odd Clymer offering is &quot;VW Body Work&quot; (1978) by Dave Tabler.  
Other than the drawings of the various panels and sheet metal pieces 
(getta Tabco catalog, dude) the book tells you nothing that a generic 
book might tell you -- but at least one sucker of a VW freak bought 
one after his '62 splittie was rear-ended by a drunk back in '78.

PS David, Sami, Dworkin and Rusty -- THANK YOU for your helpful 
responses re the Tent pages.  Working on a solution now, and will let 
the list know.  Bus doodz (and dudettes) rool!  And they're quite 
nice, too.
