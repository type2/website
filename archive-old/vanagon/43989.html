Subject: Re: Heat handling design error help



&gt;  I would also like to point out some numbers called coeffcient of 
&gt; heat transfer for various materials from Kents M E Handbook:
&gt;  Water transfers heat 7 times better than oil, Air tranfers heat
&gt; 8 times better than water. 

I think you need to read the book again.  Water is the best coolent of the
three.  Oil is better that air.
Specific heat is the ability of a substance to absorb heat, as relative to
water..

Air = 0.241 BTU/lb/deg

Lubricating oil = 0.46 BTU/lb/deg

Water = 1.00 BTU/lb/deg

It is well know that you will loose heat faster in 50deg water than in 50deg
air.
