Subject: re: 82 westy rebuild - compression data 

&gt; &gt;     I had a leak down test done today, and here's the numbers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Since I can't recall which cylinder is which number (where's that
&gt; &gt;     manual?) here's a visual, looking down:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     front
&gt; &gt;     -------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     18%  42%
&gt; &gt;     12%  43%
&gt; &gt;     -------
&gt; &gt;     rear
&gt; &gt;
I had a leak down test done on my '81 westy with similar results.  I am 
in the middle of doing the rebuild right now.  As I was disassembling the 
engine I found that the none of the head bolts were torqued above 
10 ft/lbs.(units?)   Is this enough to cause these results like these?  
 
        Thank You.
