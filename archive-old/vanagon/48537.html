Subject: How can the radio be removed?

I've removed and installed many car radios, but I'm not sure how to 
remove the VW radio from my '87.  It has the 4 little holes, one at each 
corner, on the face plate.  I don't have a manual for the radio, and the 
Bentley doesn't describe the procedure.  I'd like to replace the radio.

Thanks for the help.
