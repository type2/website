Subject: Stranded in Michigan!  Help!


My father is currently stranded in Traverse City, Michigan with 
an '89 Westy.

Drove the 14 hours to get there without problem, drove around for a while,
registered at a campground, got in the bus, turned the key, hears a clunk,
then nothing...just a relay under the dash going click.

Dealer says (before looking at it) that it might be:

a) starter motor
b) electrical problem
c) siezed engine (ouch)

Any idea where an inexpensive starter motor can be had?  

Any advice appreciated.

...Markus
