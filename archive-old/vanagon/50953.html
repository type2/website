Subject: diesel engine replacement 

        HI Volks

I need info. about a replacement for my 82 vanagon diesel ...I found a good
deal          on a low mileage engine from an 86 jetta .

_it looks like it will fit?? the junkyard guy says no problem!!

-does the 86 jetta engine have more HP than my old 82.

-do i need to swap over anything other than the oilpan , oil pump pickup tube, 
 fly wheel and clutch assembly.

                                                keep on surf&quot;in the vw net

                                                            Brian
