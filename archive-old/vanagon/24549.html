&gt; worth it IMHO. Better than spending $$$$$$$$$ for all of the VDO guages

I like the VDO gauges.  One of the best &quot;investments&quot; I have made on
my bus.  Every time I look at my dash and see my oil pressure, oil temp,
and CHT, I am somewhat confident that my engine is not about to blow up.
It also gives me something to look at during long drives.  :)  But then,
I'm kind of fanatical about gauges.  I just replaced my fuel tank sender
(a very, very dirty job, even with the engine out) and am looking
forward to leaving that 3 gallon gas can at home that I have been
carrying around inside the bus for 7 years.  WOO WOO!
