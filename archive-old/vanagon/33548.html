I've had good luck with rubber from West Coast Metrics.  I've had mine installed for about a year and half and no complaints what so ever.
Note: I replaced EVERY piece of rubber on my bus and still happy.
Also, not associated with West Coast Metrics, blah, blah, blah,
just happy consumer of large quanties of rubber seals.
