You may have heard that they are having a sale next week, 10% on all in stock
since they are moving. I called last Friday and said I needed things for my
bus and they rushed off there new catalog to me. Rick, the sales person I
talked to said if I would fax in the order over the week end he would respond
to it quickly. If &quot;wong_les&quot; is reading this they apparently guarantee their
seals for a lifetime. Anyway, they have an impressive of hard to find and
basic kinds of stuff. I concur with previous mentions, they seemed like good
folks. We shall see.
