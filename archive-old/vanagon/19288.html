Subject:  long journey - new van

hello-
i've posted one or two questions over the past couple of months, and
enjoyed the most helpful responses, as well as assimilating the collective
expertise of so many volks.  i never really introduced myself, so here
goes: i've been the owner of an 81 adventurewagen for a couple of
months (after being in the wannabus category for as long as i can
remember), but i haven't actually seen it yet (well-i've seen pictures).  my
brother lives in pasadena ca, and bought it for me there in april- it's in
excellent shape, runs smooth, and i only plan on putting it through one
winter here (i don't do much city driving anyway). i'm in michigan (not too
many good air-cooled bricks around here, winters are harsh and they
put salt on the roads), and my brother left saturday to deliver the van to
me, but he's traveling via bellingham, wa and taking his time (a total trip of
over 3,600 miles/ 3 weeks).   a moment of positive thinking to help bring
my trusty new steed (and my brother) safely and healthfully along the
way would be appreciated. thanks :-) 

matthew.
81 Adventurewagen (Mobius).
