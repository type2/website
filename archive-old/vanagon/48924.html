Subject: Re: &quot;-ellis\&quot; must unsub on friday... &lt;no vw content&gt;

&gt;jim_at_atcweb.atc.1dc_dot_com &gt; will no longer work after Saturday. I will
&gt;officially unsub from this the vanagon and type2 mail lists as of 17:00
&gt;Friday 8/30/96. I will still participate in the two lists/digest mode via
&gt;the home account at the &lt; vanbondo_at_primenet_dot_com &gt; email address. I'll see 

Just couldn't go cold turkey could you?  :)

Quick, where's the support group number!? Ah ha.. 1-800-van-agon, whew,
saved. &quot;I am an addict and my name is Rusty, help me&quot;  :) 

bye, tim
(like I should be making fun of anyone!)
