Subject: Re[2]: Dealer service ripoff?

.....Bruce Anderson, the Technical Director of the Porsche Club
of America recommends against braided stainless steel-over-teflon
brake hoses. They work good, and are universal on racing cars, but
the stainless steel braid work-hardens and fails catestrophicly, 
quite a bit different from the stock rubber hose.
	Anderson said, at a 914 maintenance seminar that I
atteneded, that he knew of one automobile accident that would
be traced to failed stainless-braid brake lines and no accidents
that could be laid to failed rubber line.
	This seems like good advice and sound reasonaing...

I thought the other reason not to go with braided hose was,... that when the 
rubber/teflon material fails you can't tell because its covered up with 
stainless steel braid.
Sure looks cool though...
