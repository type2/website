Subject:       '91 Mexi-Bug

Rich Smith asked:

.....BTW what's the story on the '91 Mexibug/ I want one too....

Well from what I can gather it was imported into the UK in '91, there 
was no import tax paid and I bought it from a car dealer.  This car 
dealer has now disappeared as I've tried quite a few avenues to find 
him.  So the Bug is illegal - but it is registered in the UK so 
really no worries!!!!!!!!!!!
Cheers

P.S.  It's great fun driving a new bug!!
