Subject: One step forward...

Hi gang,

With all the talk over the last few weeks of burning buses, I 
*finally* buckled down and replaced all the fuel lines in our trusty 
westy last weekend, so we don't reduce our bus to a pile of cinders 
somewhere on the arctic tundra on our way to Inuvik this summer.
 
Even though our bus has all the extra plumbing and hard-to-get-to spots 
that come with fuel injection, it wasn't really all that hard, and 
I can post a step-by-step procedure and parts/tools list for the job if 
there is interest expressed (email me direct if you're interested; if 
people want it, I'll post the procedure to the list).

So after spending the quality time replacing fuel lines and fuel injector 
seals ($8.10 CDN for a complete set, easy to do), I was feeling pretty 
good about things and even treated our camper to a thorough scrubbing and 
polish.  Bonding time, y'know...

Last night, drove the 40 miles to vanagon list member Neil Wigley's new 
place in Bellingham, WA (used to live in Windsor, Ontario) for dinner and 
Inuvik trip talk.  Camper ran like a champ, and real smooth, since I'd 
also cleaned the contacts inside the air intake sensor.
 
Unfortunately, when Christa was driving the camper out of our underground 
parking lot to pick me up from work, she cut too close to a concrete wall 
and scraped up the driver's side of the camper rather well.  

Damage?  Not too bad, really, I guess.  She cleaned the shore power cover 
and socket right off, elongating the screw holes on the sheet metal and 
tearing back the metal a bit.  Smallish dent at the leading edge of the 
rear wheel well, and paint scrapes/gouges along the height of the side 
body panel from 2 feet forward of the rear wheel well to the rear 
bumper. 

It's OK.  I love her, we both love the camper, and we'll get over it.

I'm going to the library to get a book on body work so she can read up on 
the subject before she starts the repairs.  I'll hold the flashlight.
 
Tobin
