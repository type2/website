Oh, for Pete's sake. Stop that. I hope I don't live long enough to see a 
world where a person has to convince himself that he's *worthy* of a VW 
Bus. If you want it and you have the money then go buy the damn thing. 
Drive it, live it, love it.

A dear friend of mine who is very wise says this:

Be who you are. Have what you love. I like people who live their dreams 
in the daytime...

--Ken
  68 Westy (most assuredly not in showroom condition), 71 Bus
