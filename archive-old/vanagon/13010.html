Subject: Re: Mildew on pop-top

&gt;&gt;Hi gang, this is probably a belaboured question:  How the heck do you get
&gt;&gt;mildew out of the felt-type lining inside the Westy's pop-top?  We just had
&gt;&gt;the van detailed today.  This guy does a great job but this stumped him
&gt;&gt;too?  TIA Bruce

Mildew is a very flimsy beast - a 5% solution of calcium hypochlorite does
it in, and the nice thing is the calcium hypochlorite isn't as destructive
to surfaces as sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as Clorox, or the mildew
itself..

5% calcium hypochlorite comes in spray bottles from the grocery store with
names like Tilex or X-14 or other X-y sounding names.  Follow manufacturer's
instructions.  Satisfaction guaranteed. &lt;s&gt;
