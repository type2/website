Subject: FS 64 split winfow w/double door
Date: Tue, 2 Jan 1996 09:46:43 -0800 (PST)

hello,
	I found a neighbors garage and a 64 split window inside.  I 
was looking at it and talked to the guy.  He says the engine is
suppossed to be in pretty good shape (if you put the last few parts
on) and the interior pretty ok,  but there is rust on the floor
pannels.  I didn't look but he said it was bad enough to have some
holes through it.  He's looking to sell it as a parts bus $300.
Anyone have any ideas or thoughts on it?  

just figured i'd lit you all know.  take care.
