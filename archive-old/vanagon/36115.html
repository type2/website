Subject: Syncro Mudflaps Trivia
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

Ok, can someone clear up this difference 
between my two Syncros: 
 
The 87 Syncro GL has the small  mudflaps 
(really more of black plastic extension attached 
to the back of the wheel-well) at each of the four 
wheelwells. 
 
The 90  Syncro Westie only has them at the  
front wheelwells. Is this normal? 
 
Wondering about the mystery of it all....
