&gt;I have another question on the valve adjustment.  The Bentley says 
&gt;turn the lash screw 2 turns after  it contacts the stem.  Some the 
&gt;the valves mush down and don't lift off the seat (unless you screw in 
&gt;way past 2 turns) but others start lifting the valve immediately.  
&gt;
&gt;How are the turns be counted?  During the mushy part if it is mushy 
&gt;or should it be run down to the hard part where the valve is forced 
&gt;open?

Just take up the slack in the lifters, then turn adjuster two full turns.  If
a lifter feels mushy, there is no oil in it or the check valve is bad or hung
up.  Note these lifters, as if you have a continuing problem, these are the
bad ones.  After adjusting, allow time for them to bleed down.  Then let
engine run for a while to have them self adjust.  This sometimes takes a
while. Like 20 minutes or so.
