Stephen,
The responses I've been getting which range from simple to very complicated
technical explanations all indicate this is just another Vanagon idiosyncracy
to be lived with by many. The only solutions offered were:

                &gt;Smaller diameter pulley on alt (there are drawbacks to this)
                &gt;raise idle speed
                &gt;try cleaning cold start bypass valve.

Thanks all for the input. It appears to be a common &quot;thing&quot;. I wont worry about
it anymore but it will still be an irritant in my car life. I am an uncontrolled
compulsive about things working right -I probably shouldn't own a Vanagon. :)
If anyone does come up with a solution let us all know.
