Betreff: 	Marco Polo US Availability

Can I order one of these in the States from a Mercedes dealer?  What is
the cost?  Thanks!


Hi. 
price in Germany for the Morco Polo is about 65,000 DEM. I am afraid they do 
not deliver it to the States yet. 

I dont know either if you could get the Van registered if you imported it on 
your own. Probably you know better than we in Europe that vehicle-registration 
US laws are very restrictive, as one can read on

On the Westfalia owner site (bro. &amp; siyters chapter) there is a direct link to 
Mercedes Benz, maybe you can check something out through them.

I guess if there would be enough demand from the US why shouldn't the deliver.

Is the V-class Van available in the US ? - this would probably make it easier 
to register a Marco Polo.

Feel free to mail again if there is any information you need from Europe.

Good luck !

Tom N.

PS. Why don't you have a note to the Vanagon list who else in USA/Canada would 
be interested in a Marco Polo or James Cook and forward it to Mercedes Benz of 
America ?
