&gt; 
&gt; Now, the REALLY EXCITING part of the show (at least for deadheads) was that 
&gt; the encore was Unbroken Chain, NEVER performed live until the '95 spring tour.
&gt; The first playing of Unbroken Chain was 19 March 1995 -- exactly one
&gt; year ago today.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   --berry
&gt; &quot;Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls, Unbroken chain of sky and sea.
&gt; Unbroken chain of the western wind, Unbroken chain of you and me.&quot;
&gt; 
My first Unbroken Chain was spring in Tampa. Bertha, my 78 camper, ended 
up on the video screen over the stage at that show!
