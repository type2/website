oh yes they do.  While neither my '87 GTI 16V or the SO's '86 Scirocco have
come loose, the nut on SyncroBeast came loose last winter.  Pumped out 4
quarts in the time it took to travel up over the curb/2 foot snowbank and
travel 1 block back to parking.

Cold weather's when you really need to check em.

Cold Weather = stiff seals.
