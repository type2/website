&gt;Ok, so you're not using a turbo inj. pump. How does the power compare 
&gt;with the old engine after adding just the turbo? 

I had to increase fuel adjustment screw before I noticied much improvement.
According to the Bentley manual the normal Jetta turbo diesel had 68 hp,
and the &quot;Eco&quot; turbo diesel had 59 hp and did not have boost enrich.
I suspect that the jetta or qntm injection pump would interfere with the 
engine cover, and a picture that I saw of the European TD van engine appeared
to
have boost enrich. and was rated at about 68 hp.

&gt; EGT?   - I had to order a vdo EGT gauge and an extra long wire extention to
&gt;Do you have a source for these, and how much? 

 I purchased the gauge and thermocouple wire extension from New Dimensions
in San Jose, Ca.  About $100.  But any fap supply could order it, this one
was 
shipped from VDO inst. in L.A.    I would check the ads in &quot;Hot VW&quot; magazine
and call around for best price.  I forgot to mention that the exhaust
manifold has a 
boss that looks like it was made for putting the thermocouple.  This where I 
drilled and tapped a 3/8&quot; pipe fitting for the thermocouple.

&gt;What's the correct temp ranges for this engine?
A guy at a injection pump repair shop told me 1200 or 1300 F as max temp.
I would like to find a reference to confirm this.  I have found that if I put
more fuel in, the EGT will rise along with mpg decrease down to the low 20's.
