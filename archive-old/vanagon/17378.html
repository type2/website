Subject: Re: SOTO big meet?

At the risk of being bombarded with rude messages I posted teh location for
this year's SOTO meet as beinf at the Garden Grove Boys Club. The meet will
be held on June 10,1995. admission for (recognized) dues paid members is
free. Free admittance will be acknowledged via the mailing label from the
SOTO newsletter. This information was given to me from Dave Heard lasty
week. Suggestion as always is to arrive early as half of the grounds is
grass and the other half is dirt. (groovy). The Escondido location was not
secured due to the desire to hold the event closer to the other five billion
activities near Irvine and a scheduling mix up through new managment of the
Deer Creek Winery. (It takes two to tango). If anyone has a beef with SOTO
call Dave Heard and be persistant. (510) 937-7686. He will call you back if
you call several times or kinda late 20:30 (Pacific time). I guess I've been
lucky. Paid the dues, got the newsletters and used the good old telephone,
actually made a connection, and had a pleasant conversation. Don't spam me
I'm just the messenger!!!!!
Rusty and &quot;Cherry&quot; VanBondo plan on attending. Look for a good looking gal
hanging out with a fossil in a '83 Westy or a ratty '57 Single cab ;)

The nose cones came in both. Clear for U.S. models and amber for the Euro.
call and ask Mr. Hamill, he'll tell you the real poop.

&gt;Howdy all.
&gt;
&gt;As usual, in my spot out in the dark, I heard from a friend that 
&gt;there is a big SOTO meet in June in the LA area.  Does this sound 
&gt;right?  I think I'll go down to get some parts for the '57.
&gt;
&gt;Quick question for the old bus guru's.  Are the bullet turn signals 
&gt;supposed to be clear plastic, or the yello plastic?  I've see both 
&gt;types, just not sure what kind I should have.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, if anyone comes across some old (50's) bumpers give me a yell!  
&gt;I'll pay the proverbial big bucks! &lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
