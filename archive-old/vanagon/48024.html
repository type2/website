Hi all

Patrick asks:

&gt; i am interested in seeing if you know if there is a south african version
&gt; of parts micro fiche and or an official repair manual for the SA version
&gt; of this vehicle. i would like to try to figure the differences an 

I'm sure there's a fiche, but they're unobtainable, except if you're a
dealer. No manual, I actually saw the thick green USA version (sez 'Vanagon'
on the cover) for sale the other day.

&gt; possibility of creating a list of parts necessary to do a conversion.....

Somebody on your side of the sea would stand a better chance of getting this
right. Small things like what side of the road you drive on... :-)

&gt; i own a 86' crewcab transporter (vanagon truck), which has a 2.1
&gt; wasserboxer....however the audi 5 would be an excellent conversion,
&gt; plus my truck has several inches of extra clearence in the engine
&gt; coompartment....

I would say you need the bellhousing, a custom exhaust system, some wiring
and fuel pipe &amp; pump stuff to sort out, no problem.

&gt; are these VW's still being produced in your country?

Yup.

&gt; do you know of availability of microfiche or repair books which
&gt; show the engine/trans/etc... setup for the SA version vans?

Not outside of dealer workshops, no.

&gt; are you interested in helping create a list of parts necessary
&gt; to do a conversion...

I can help if required, but I don't have the time or inclination to drive
any of it. Remember - I drive a VW conversion with a Type IV engine - I only
read vanagon_at_lenti to further my education :-)
