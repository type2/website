Subject: FS Vanagon curtains 

Hello All,

I had a lot of questions about the curtains also.  The curtains do not have 
rods ... they snap in. There are 4 curtains.. 2 long ones for the sides and
one that fits the front and one that fits the rear..  These are from a 1984
Vanagon and I am not sure what other years they will fit.  I have no curtain
rods. I also have the net for the back.  I also have a set of the screens
for the side windows.  

Thank you 
PaulC
