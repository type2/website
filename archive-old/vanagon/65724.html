&gt; was there anything of any real use in the supplemental Syncro manual you
&gt; mentioned?  My manual '87, has a short section on Syncro driving, not
&gt; much after that.  Bye, tim

      HI Tim,
   Well .... Not anything that the list hasn't talked about. It does
   mention a valve that was to be located back by the license plate.
   It was to control preheating of the intake air. It was to be changed
   when crossing water. I guess they found that there wasn't a need for
   preheating the intake air therefore, made the entire intake as we
   have it today. (Even my 2 wheel drive GL had the snorkel tube)
   This in turn obsoleted any valve of this nature!
   A.....your in Canada aren't you?  You my have shutch a valve?
   It may be needed for vary cold climates only!

                           Eric
      Lawyers: the number 1 problem we have today!
               Problem number 2 is the EGO!
