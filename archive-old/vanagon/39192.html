&gt;
&gt;What is the diameter of a 185/75 r 14 tire?     24.9&quot;

205/70-14 24.9&quot;
Sizes are approximate and vary among different manufactures
&gt;
&gt;I have two 185 R 14's and 2 185/75 r 14's on my van on opposite sides, in 
&gt;opposite corners!  Might this tend to make my van handle funny?
Yes it would!!
&gt;A local dealer called and has the following tres in 185 R 14... which one 
&gt;doyoyu think is best? (this is the size printed in my van)
&gt;
&gt;michelin mx $96.00
&gt;
&gt;Bridgestone d rated 8 ply $88.00
&gt;
&gt;Merit 8 ply $57.95
&gt;
&gt;

For close to $100.00, I would look for reinforced 205/70,s or got to a 215/70
high performance tire.  The 215/70 in standard load will hold 1554 lbs per
tire minus the 10% wieght derating for use on a light truck.  Plenty of
capacity for a Vanagon.
