So on saturday I go to Kragen to get a bulb for the turn signal
on the 59 bus.  I don't have the bad bulb so I take off the good
one in the parking lot, go in, match up and get the bulb, and 
go install it in their lot.

Jump in, test it, yup it works.

Put it in first and drive over the housing, lens, and bulb for
the &quot;good side&quot;.  Smashed _flat_.  Made a neat noise.

SO, if anyone can help me find the left (drivers) turn signal 
housing for a 59 bus, I sure would buy it from you.  I think a
1960 will work too.

Thanks.
