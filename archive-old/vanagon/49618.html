Subject: Re: need advice on water pump

Not real sur of the price of the pump but without AC you could expect about
2 to 2.5 hours labor. They are not difficult, I did one for a friend in his
garage, His had AC. And I did another in the shop, where I used to work, on
the floor because all the hoists were full.

&gt;Here's the next repair on the agenda.  I hear my water pump going. 
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have any idea how much a water pump should cost and how
&gt;manyu hours of labor (for a paid mechanic) are involved in replacing
&gt;the pump?
&gt;
&gt;Also, I've been hearing it for a couple hundred miles.  Can I likely go 
&gt;another 100 miles or so with a fairly low probability of complete failure?
&gt;You are not required to anwser this question.

&gt;Thanks for the help as always.
