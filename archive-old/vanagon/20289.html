Greetings,

I am the proud owner of a 1969 Camper. Good running condition although...

I installed a brand spankin' new 34 pict 3 carb. Bus runs pretty good but
stumbles just off idle. I've adjusted the volume screw two ways to no
avail-per Muir, half turn out from where it runs the fastest-and per
Bentley, turned in from fastest idle until RPM drops 20-50. Timing is spot
on, statically and at full advance. (I use a bosch 009).

Bus ran better with the old carb (34 pict 3, but made in Japan rather than
Mexico) but it had to be replace to stop a severe leak out of the throttle
rod. Problem only began with new carb so I suspect the problem is there.
Maybey a manifold leak? But the rubber looks good.

Any suggestions most welcome.

Nice to find a Bus specific forum.
Later,
Ken
