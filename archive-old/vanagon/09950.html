Subject: Digifant/Electronics Now Article

Yo Dudes. 

If you will remember, about a month ago someone posted a note about an
article in Electronics Now magazine by a technically oriented editor who
owned a Vanagon and who, working in isolation from us, felt that he traced
the hesitation/stalling problem back to a resistor in the Digifant system
which has pins which are particularly hard to solder and which in many vans
are inadequately soldered.

Well, I bought the February issue of Electronics Now to see his article and
it happend to include his e-mail address. I fired off some technical
information about the shuddering problem, including the tech bullitens from
the factory recomending the auxiliary wiring harness for the air meter box. 

Don Lancaster is the name of the writer/editor. He is probably the only guy I
know to have tried to study the Digifant brain seriously and technically and
to have gone in to it. If his theories are correct, we should all take our
brains apart and study the offending resistor to see if they are correctly
soldered. Anyway, he responded to my e-mail today and his response is
reproduced below. His note indicates that he would like to join our Vanagon
list. He has an '87 Syncro. Apparently he tried to subscribe to the vanagon
list by sending e-mail to the list directly rather than the listserve. 

Does anybody have a good all-purpose invitation to subscribe/instructions how
to subscribe they could send him? And me, for that matter, so I can keep it
on my hard drive.

I hope we stop getting bombarded with RETURN MAIL messages before he signs
on. I wouldn't want him to get the wrong impression about our list. 

Gerry where are you! :) 

Anyway, here is what he wrote to me:
