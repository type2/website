Mechanic just called back. - No new transmissions available anywhere!
Options are to get a used trans w/ 90 day warranty or a rebuild w/ all
new bearings w/ 12 month 12K miles warranty.  The prices are $700
and $1K respectively.  I think I'll spend the extra $300.

&gt; :(   you might want to check with this guy, to see if you can swap your
&gt; core (old) transmission for one of his rebuilt ones. he helped me out
&gt; with my rebuild (cause the idiot dealer bent my internal shift rod by
&gt; trying to disassemble the tranny without the special tools!!! and there
&gt; were NO shift rods in stock ANYWHERE in the u.s.!!! i got a used one from
&gt; Weddle shipped overnight and got my tranny back together and got the hell
&gt; away from that dealer).
