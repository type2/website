Subject: help for my 83's pop top

        Just curious as to wether or not anyone has ever taken the rubber
trim off their pop top and re-glued or adhered it? I dont want to have to
buy a new rubber strip, and its in great condition, but the glue is drying
and crack and making the rubber peel in places.
        If anyone could suggest a glue to use or has any tips Id love to
hear em. As usual. :)

BTW my van is running ok now...seems fine, although I would really like
some gauges to help me out. As soon as I get that Bentley Im going to work!

mental floss for the world.
