Subject: Re: Tires for 91 westy - options?
From: s_j_wacker_at_juno_dot_com (STEVEN G WACKER)

Sean,
 I don't know if you have a westy or a PV, but 205s were standard on many
of the newer Vanagons. My 90 Carat came equiped with Michelin MXL
205/70R14 on alloy wheels. I get 50k on these and am on my third set.
They are very difficult to find and run around $100 each. I just re-shoed
my 87 Syncro with Firestone M + S 215/70R14 on Mercedes wheels, $340 for
4, mounted and balanced w/ new stems (chromed, no less--Ohooo)(that would
be the stems, not the tires). Both vans DO have power steering.
BTW, the Michelin tires handle great, except in the wet, the Firestones
are good so far, haven't had them in the wet yet. And it never snows in
southern California. (except in the mountains)
