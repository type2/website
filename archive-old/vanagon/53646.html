Subject: Re: Rear hatch strut question



&gt;i have in my hands 2 new hatch struts.  but they are different PNs and i
&gt;don't know which is the 'correct' one for an '87 with the rear wiper.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Hydro-lift 251 829 332  somewhat easy to compress. mebbe 70 lbs.
&gt;2.  Suspander 251 829 331 B  nearly impossible to compress.  over 200 lbs.
&gt;
&gt;i've seen the bad comment on Suspander in the archives.  anyone have the
&gt;lowdown on the two PNs??  which is correct?  or is a mix of these two 
&gt;good?

Here is what my parts book says, but it is not a VW book and I can't 
guarantee its accuracy. (Actually your dealer probably has the most 
accurate info.)  332 is a right strut, with or without wiper.  331B is 
listed as a &quot;left for '83-85 no wiper,&quot; and 331A is a left for '86-up. 
(This latter part confuses me, though; shouldn't the newer style be B and 
the older one A?)
