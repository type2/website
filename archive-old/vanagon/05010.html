Subject: Engine size in a '64 Type 2??


	Hello everyone.  I just recently got my hands on a '64  
MicroBus.  I need an ignition coil and a starter.  I know it still  
has the stock 6V system, but I'm not sure of the engine size.  As far  
as I can remember, 1200 is stock.  It is possible, I guess, that it  
could be a 1600.  I don't know my VW's enough to tell by sight.   
Anyway..the block is #H0476361.  Can anyone tell me my engines size.   
I think that the Idiot guide has the codes, but mine's in the mail,  
don't have it here now.  Any help would really help me speed up the  
process of getting this thing to run.  Thanks in advance....later..
