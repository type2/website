No, You're the first one to respond!   Now I know somebody believes me!  I have
seen quite a few late Vanagons with these spots on the alloy wheels. They are
easy to clean off, I just used paint thinner or mineral spirits ( or tar remover
) and a small soft bristle brush and a rag, and with some good 'ol elbow grease,
they came off. (paint thinner won't hurt the clearcoat, just do it in the shade)
Then I washed the wheels thouroughly with soap and water, dried them, and gave
them a good coat of  polish or car wax. 

But the BIG QUESTION I still have is..........................How, and why were
they there????

It's a mystery to me................

Anybody else know what I'm talking about?
