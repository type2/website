Subject: Flue Vent Covers _at_ $5 +ship

So I moseyed over to the local Dometic Wizard to get the spiders out of the
propane widgets and he mentioned I should keep the little $$$plastic$$$ cover
on the flue during spider season.

My little $$$plastic$$$ cover has gone to uv heaven so I hesitatingly inquired
about the price of another.  $5 measly bucks compared to some previously 
mentioned price vrom ze friendly local folkxvagen folkx.

Naturally I bought $10 bucks worth and dutifully covered the flue and 
squirreled away the spare.

If you have such needs he said he'd mail order.

The dometic P/N is 2929489009-13
The outfit is AAA RV in Sacramento 916.292.9777
