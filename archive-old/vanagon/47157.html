OOPS!  John, you must have forgotten to change the recipient on your reply
to Tim.  It came through addressed to the vanagon list.  Maybe Mr. Davis
won't notice the posting.

BTW, the problem with coolant flow at idle can sometimes be from air in the
front heater core.  I also had a Renault that behaved similarly until I got
the cooling system bled out.  Evacuating the air from the Renault's cooling
system made the job on the Vanagon look like child's play.  But then,
anything that wasn't designed wrong on the Renault was assembled wrong :)
