FROM: H YATES

Hi Tim.  I have a '90 Syncro Westy, and it's been good to us... just blew a
waterpump in September though.  Anyway, have the brakes checked out.  The
Syncro has it's own brakes, and the front rotors are around $300 EACH!!
in Canadian $$.. With the Syncro, your maintenance costs are going to
skyrocket.. air filters are $134, exhaust (all vanagon's is over $2000
at the dealer, the rear diff lock (who knows?).  Front diffs are over
$10,000 to buy new (over $2000 to rebuild).

If you can get over the maintenance repairs that will be required over and
above a regular vanagon, then go for it.  The Syncro is an exceptional
vehicle, and the 4WD system is really well implemented.  Oh yes, the shocks
are also specific to the Syncro.. they are gas filled.  Basically, all the
suspension is unique to this model.  The steering feel is a little heavier
than a regular van as well, due to the added weight of the Syncro system.

Hope this helps.

Thx.
Harry
