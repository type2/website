Subject: RE: vanagon rear wheel brg. ????

I would not accept much slack in the bearing.  Mine became a liitle bit
loose and I was able to tighten it up by re-torquing (is that a word?) the
big 46 mm (1 13/16 in).  1000 mi later it was loose again!  I could hear
the bad bearing whine especially in a turn that shifts the weight to the bad
side.  When I took it apart the inner bearing cage was half gone!!!!!  Better
to find this out in the driveway than at 1:00 am who knows where.

Parts, inner and outer and grease seals (2), were $70-80 I think (at my
flaps).  One of the replacement bearing s was a FAG.

The Bentley book (mine is 1986 edition) doesn't clearly indicate that there is
a large C clip that needs removed before pressing out the inner bearing.

I have never replaced a rear CV joint (135K mi), but have taken to regreasing
them based on Joel's recommendations.
