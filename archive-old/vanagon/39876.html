&gt;I'm ordering a new engine this week, but one little wrench in the
&gt;works.
&gt;
&gt;Upon pulling my engine last night (my first solo engine-pull) and counting
&gt;flywheel teeth (110) I am now pretty sure that I have a 6v starter.
&gt;
&gt;The conversion books I read stated that I need a 12v starter, and I must
&gt;enlarge the bell housing 1/10&quot;.  What the books don't say is WHERE the bell 
&gt;housing must be enlarged. Anyone done this before?
&gt;
&gt;A local mechanic suggested taking a scrap shortblock, attaching the air drill 
&gt;to the crank, and using that to grind the bell housing, finishing with a hand 
&gt;file or drill with appropriate attachment.  Dunno 'bout that.
&gt;
&gt;The bus is a '66.

&gt;Thanks for any help,

The way I do it is that you install your new flywheel and then start
to install the engine until you can't go any further.  Then take a
socket wrench or cresent wrench and turn the engine over using the
crank pulley on the front of the engine.  Then remove the engine,
the flywheel has now scratched an area on the bellhousing of the
tranny and you can see where you need to clearance.  I use a dremel
moto tool but you can use a air grinder or electric grinder.  just
take it slow and don't grind through the bellhousing.  If I remember
right, there will be two areas on each side at the bottom and one
area up near the top on the starter side. Every tranny will be a
little different. Hope this helps.
See ya
