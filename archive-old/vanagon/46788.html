Subject: re: My bus parts Stolen!!

Sorry to hear of your loss. Your absolutely right though there are scum bags out there and wouldn't you just like to catch them ;)

I've just come back from a week on holiday to see my type 2 winking at me... someone stole one of the front lights!! Must have been a very hard up guy?!

Compared to your loss its not much but like you say easy come easy go.
Keep smiling something good is just around the corner... I hope :)

Ian
