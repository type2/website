     &gt;&gt;      Ok Kombi lovers,
     &gt;&gt;      the way I understand it is this, &gt;
     &gt;&gt;      Model         Features
     &gt;&gt;
     &gt;[snip]
     &gt;&gt;
     &gt;&gt;      Deluxe Micro  Microbus with deluxe extras, (extra side window, 
     &gt;&gt;                    clock etc.) and options of skylight, corner      
     &gt;                     windows and sunroof.
     &gt;
     &gt;I think the corner windows were not an option on the DeLuxe -- that 
     &gt;is, you were &quot;stuck&quot; with 'em (sigh).  You could delete the sunroof 
     &gt;and portholes/skylights, but not the corners.
     &gt;
     &gt;Ja?
     
     What was I writing??  Yes, of course the Deluxe always had corner 
     windows.
     
     Sorry,
     
     Lee.
