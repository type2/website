&gt;&quot;The time has come, the Walrus said, to talk of many things:

&quot;The time has come,&quot; the Walrus said,
&quot;To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.&quot; 


&gt;Puff didn't show up till later.   :^)

According to Lewis Carroll, the puffing was the Red King snoring.
