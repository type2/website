Dan &quot;let's carp on California&quot; Houg inquires:

&gt;but there remains one California mystery unsolved...
&gt;How do keep all those plastic reflectors imbedded in the roads from 
&gt;being scraped off by the snowplows?

Happy new year, Dan, I trust you had a pleasant stay in (somewhat) sunny
Cal....

Seems to me those plastic road refelctors get scraped off just like anywhere
else,
(didn't you go to Lake Tahoe?) but I've noticed some of the newer reflectors
sit
below the level of the road surface, thereby escaping the long blade of the
plow.
