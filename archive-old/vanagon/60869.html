Subject: Re: importing vw stuff from lebanon?

&gt;       so does it do us any good to know there are parts of the world where
&gt;vanagons are both plentiful...and cheap to buy and maintain?  this is my
&gt;question.....
&gt;      i have heard that in lebanon for instance...the above is true.  has
&gt;anyone pursued the viability...legality...of bringing parts in from places
&gt;where their cheap?   how about used parts?   used vanagons...?  seems like
&gt;theres a business opportunity here...just dont know the pitfalls.  if
&gt; anybody  has thought about these possabilities,,id love to hear what uve
&gt;learned or concluded.   does the reference ive read on the list to south
&gt;africa ,ive read on the list, fall under this interest?
&gt;
Not a bad idea.  For a while, a friend of mine was in the business of
buying old VWs, Porsches, BMWs in the more car friendly climates of the US.
 When he got a container full he would send them to Germany for resale.  He
made several thousand dollars per car.

If someone knows where there are lots of old Vanagons for cheap then it
just takes one person on either end.  It is worth exploring.  The big
question is, where is this bargain junkyard located?
