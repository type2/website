Subject: Re: More cylinder numbering


I was a little bit confused about that what was written
on the list, but now I remember:

My manual said that cylinder counting starts at the
left front cylinder, that the second column.
Where as in-line engines counting starts in the front.

The firing order, which is stamped on a sheet thin
in the engines compartment, is 3-2-1-4.

Do I check the manual and send you the references?

Ok, so I now know the correct cylinder #s:
3   1
4   2

Aside from checking the distributor rotor, how does one check for TDC
on #1, instead of #3, since both would give TDC on the crank, right?
Do you have to remove a spark plug &amp; peer in, or is there a notch on
one of the pulleys, or what?

The reason for this question is the following: If one sets TDC on the
crank, then looks at the rotor, it is possible to assume that #3 is
#1. Then by following the firing order 1-4-3-2 (which would actually
be 3-2-1-4 since the starting point was off), one could derive the
following cylinder numbering:
1   3
2   4

On an OHC engine, one can simply look at the cam to confirm TDC on
#1, and one can derive #1 from the firing order. But such is not the
case with a boxer engine. Am I totally confused and off base?

The above scenario has just occurred (not to me), but I can see how I
could have done the same, especially since I could not find any
explicit mention of it in the Bentley.

So what's the secret?
