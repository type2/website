Humm... You guys switched the subject quick. 

Well, I used to drive beetles and just like you guys I constantly worried about 
engine overheating. I built an oil dip stick temperature sensor and replaced
the original stick with it.

I monitored the engine oil temp constantly since then. I found out that the oil
temp is actually lower when cruising at high speed on freeways than normal
city street driving. In stop and go heavy traffic situation the temp tends to 
be even worse. I was constantly told that driving long uphill is the most
deadly enemy. However, with my homemade oil temp gauge I found out the oil
temp did not go too high to be worried. But turning on AC (yes, my 73 beetle
has AC) is a killer, very deadly in very short period of time.

If you own aircooled vanagon with AC I suggest you baby it carefully.
Now how about switching back to the original subject?
