Subject: Re: 85 Vanagon performance enhancements

Item Subject: Text_1
     The PO on my '85 had the catalytic converter hollowed out so it was 
     essentially a straight pipe.  When I replaced the rusting exhaust 
     system I returned the system to original complete with a new catalytic 
     converter.  I HAVE SEEN NO DIFFERENCE IN POWER OR GAS MILEAGE.  As Ron 
     says, &quot;don't do it&quot;

     This would cause an increase in pollution.  Don't do it!
