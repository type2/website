Subject: REPOST: DC-MD-VA COOKOUT

All right, one more time:

WHAT:  Cookout at Chris Chubb's
       Evening Cruise through Old Town Alexandria

WHEN:  Saturday, September 9th, 2pm - ??

WHO'S INVITED: ANYBODY who likes and/or has air-cooled VWs
(If your VW isn't currently running, then bring pictures!)
Invite your non-Internet friends with VWs too--if we run out of room
in Chris' backyard, we'll move to the local park!

WHAT TO BRING:  Yourself, your family (if they can stand it), your VW or
pictures of it, drinks, snacks (chips, etc) to share, LAWN CHAIRS.

Chris will provide grills and hamburgers; if you don't eat hamburgers then
please bring whatever you like.

Please come!  We're all looking forward to seeing you!

Directions to Chris Chubb's house:

&gt;From I-495 between I-395 and the Wodrow Wilson Bridge:

Route 1 South to a right turn onto Huntington Ave (West).

At the first light, turn left onto Biscayne. 
First left onto Glendale Terr. 
About halfway down on the right.
2321 Glendale Terr.

Park anywhere but in the apartment lot across the street.

You can e-mail either of us with questions about the cookout, but send
questions about the directions to Chris (cchubb_at_ida_dot_org), because I've never
been to his place.
