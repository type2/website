Subject: 59 single cab update

Thanks to all for the wonderful advice concerning putting a 1600 into the
truck. I was wondering how to acces the FAQ?

Anyway Troy and I got the 36 hp to run on sunday and it sounds great!! We
are going to check out the brakes today and possibly test run it tomorrow. 

Looks like Troy is going to drive it to CA with the 36 (after extensive
testing of course) more on this road trip later

We are going to Manasses this weekend (Not in the truck unfortunatly but in
my westfalia)

see ya
jason
