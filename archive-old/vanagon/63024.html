          for that price, you should throw in the 5th one (the spare)....
          don't you think?



      Hey, Chris!

      Lighten up! %)

      At $13 per for lug nuts and $11 per for the caps, that's only $346 for
      the four wheels.

      (Sorry, couldn't resist!  Been traumatized by dealer prices for too
      long!) &gt;&gt;

I just think that dealers who sell their merchandise on this list should at
least pop in from time to time to give their advice on a mechanical problem,
say hi, or at least SOMETHING.
Afterall, the other parts dealers on this list do offer technical help and
such, and at least let people know they're participating listmembers (bus
depot/sherwood automotive , etc.) and I commend them for that, despite their
busy schedules.
But (and this is MY personal opinion) when a &quot;listmember&quot; who only pops in to
sell overpriced merchandise, and inquire about cheap westys for sale, BUT
never adds anything to the list otherwise, I think that is Very unfortunate,
and is obviously just using the list to their monetary advantage.
THIS IS MY PERSONAL  OPINION.
i dont want to start a flame war, It feel it was my perogative to voice my
opinion on this matter.
if you dont like anything i said, or disagree, delete it!
'nuff said...

(who has sold a set of Carat alloys on the list before, for MUCH less, and
doesnt go unto &quot;unknown lurker&quot; status until I have something else to
sell...)
