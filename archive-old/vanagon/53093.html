Subject: Re: Rear Brake Drum Puller

&gt;     shows a special tool that looks like a gear puller to remove the rear 
&gt;     drums.  Is there an easy &amp; safe way to remove the rear drums without 

easiest is to get the van up and well supported with wheel off, then take
your favourite large hammer and belt the face (near outer rim) of the drum
hard.  It will likely bounce off/loose on the first hit.  Work your way
around crisscrossing a bit and it will pop of the studs/axle stub, with
showers of rust and dust, so don't breathe.  Trust me, nail the sucker hard.
I've used the back of a 10lb splitting maul on drums that sat 10 years on a
junker I was towing away, rolled fine after that. :) Pullers are to
fiddly/slow and you may rip the shoes out of the cyls. without noticing,
damaging stuff.  bye, tim
