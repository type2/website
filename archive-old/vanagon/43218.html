&gt;Mendeola is now selling a VW based tranny that uses a 9&quot; Ford ring and
&gt;pinion. Its killer. It won't fit into a stock VW without modification but it
&gt;is a really cool piece. I build the differentials for Mike and they are
&gt;huge. They utilize Ford spyder gears.

Oh my.

Think of it with a low transfer case and, like, 38&quot; tires. No pumpkins,
just CVs. Talk about clearance!
