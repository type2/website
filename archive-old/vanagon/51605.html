&gt; 
&gt;    I own a 91 Vanagon and in Florida, its tough to go camping without AC
for a
&gt;    good part of the year. I'm hoping you can help me find a suitable
solution.
&gt;    Some kind of small unit which can be easily transported and installed
in a
&gt;    window when you arrive at your camp site. I have thought about ways to
&gt;    modify the Van, but would rather not. 
&gt;    I would appreciate any help you can be relative to my search of a
solution.
&gt; 
&gt; Ed,
&gt; 
&gt; I have no suggestions.  Your best sources of advice will almost certainly
be
&gt; the Vanagon and Type2 mailing lists (vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu and
&gt; type2_at_primenet_dot_com, respectively).
