I said:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;         No, the third is not for the brake lights.  Remember, this is a '56,
&gt;&gt; so the brake light is in the engine lid, (Sob, oh how I want one of those
&gt;&gt; so bad :( If one the A-hole I bought it from hadn't swiped it)  Does
&gt;&gt; anyone know what that wire would go to?

And he said:

&gt;I don't think so... VW stopped the &quot;pope's nose&quot; on the 1952 models.
&gt;When the &quot;heart taillights&quot; were introduced in 1953, the heart acted
&gt;as the stop light, and the pope's nose was no longer needed. In 1955
&gt;early the &quot;ruby&quot; lenses were used, and by late 55 the slightly larger,
&gt;but still smaller than the 60's style taillights were used.
&gt;
&gt;In 54, VW began the &quot;model year&quot; concept. THerefore, there are very
&gt;few 54s out there, as half of the run became '55s (the ones with
&gt;the rubies...) then the larger taillights from jan to july when
&gt;'56 production began in August...

So I says:

I know 4 people here in Sacramento with 50's busses.  (one is a '59, so
I guess that doesn't count) 

The others, 2 of them are '56's and 1 is a '55.  They all have the flat
rear-engine lid (no license plate bump) and have the brake light in
the engine lid.  The brake light is similar in shape and size to the 
reverse lights in '67 buses, but slightly larger, I believe.

My bus does not have wiring in the taillights for the brake lights.   There
are two wires right in the middle of the engine compartment opening, one
is live with the brake pedal pressed, and the other is live with the
headlights on.

BTW - we are talking about busses, right?  I have never seen heart taillights
on a bus...  The &quot;proper&quot; lights for mine are the domed glass ones, with the
wide bezel.  I have '58 lights on it now, which are slightly larger, flat,
with a hexagonal lens inside.  There is no reflector on these or the
earlier ones; these busses had a small round reflector mounted in a little 
hole about 3&quot; or so below the taillight.  Another dream item for me!

(singing, to the tune of &quot;White Christmas&quot;) &quot;I'm dreaming of some old... 
tail.. lights, just like the ones it used to have....&quot;

This is not a flame, but maybe I should have my Nomex handy?
