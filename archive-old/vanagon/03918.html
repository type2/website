Subject: Awnings and such

All this talk about awnings is timely. I just bought a 9x12 tent that
attaches to the side of the Van - from an Austrian grad student that was
leaving for Ecuador the next morning. Boy, do I feel decadent now! It's a
standalone tent/frame, with a large door that's sized to fit the van.
There is a large flap that encloses a pole that rests in the rain gutter -
held in place by 2 clamps. You can unclamp and drive away - leaving the
tent standing too keeping your campsite reserved should you so desire.

It has no floor, but it has big plastic windows, and rubberized fabric on
the bottom 12 inches which I guess serve to keep out rain. We'll see.
Plus I have another tarp and set of poles so that I can extend it even
further - build my own freaking tent city! I'm not sure if I'm going to use
it much, it really does seem decadent to me - but then I'm just getting
used to having the camper. Best use I see for it is a place to hide the
bikes at night - now I'll just have to figure out how to chain them up
inside there.

He bought the tent in Austria - don't know where - and I didn't see any
markings on it. So someone out there makes them - sorry I can't be of more
help in locating one.

Rick
