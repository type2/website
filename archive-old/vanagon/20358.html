Subject: Re: peanut butter storage in Campers

I keep mine as emergency axle and hinge lube/ and sandwich fixin's for the
in-laws when we go camping with them. The stuff works well and the smell
makes me think of the circus as I zip down the hiways and biways. Speaking
of circus, I was totally offended when I was accused of being a &quot;freak&quot; by
one of the list members! Jeesh, I think I've been found out! (Beagles, my
butt) ;)


&gt;Many list members like me have campers and keep food in there for the odd
&gt;rainy day. I found some peanut butter in mine that had been in there since
&gt;1992 (I labeled it), through -20 degree winters and 115 degree-in-the sun
&gt;summers. 
&gt;
&gt;Does peanut butter go bad?
&gt;
&gt;Does it go bad faster once you open the container?
&gt;
&gt;Should I eat the peanut butter or throw it out?
