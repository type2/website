&quot; The more, the merrier.&quot; Let's not get elitist but embrace the differences.
I own both early and late models and don't consider myself in the &quot;higher
income&quot; bracket. After watching a relative of mine trade in a Ford truck for
a Villager minivan (eek) and commit to car payments near my rent/mtg payment
(double eek) I tend to think that the folks with newer models might be
paying out the &quot;tailpipe&quot; and have less dinero in which to spend on fun
projects, necessary projects, and camping/cruising. I suggest that we reread
the post earlier in the week regarding the lifecycle of a listgroup and cut
back on the caffine. Don't fret folks things will work out just fine on
their own. Be Happy.  Shalom/Happy Easter
