Subject:      re EV door lock problem

&gt;
&gt;My door locks have been malfunctioning.  It has happened twice.  Push down the
&gt;lock and all the locks would go down and then go up.  Then the opposite
&gt;happened today.  Pull up the lock and momentarily all the lock would unlock
&gt;and then immediately lock again.  Seems that opening and closing the sliding
&gt;door made it work properly.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else have this happen?
&gt;I am going to clean the contacts.  Anyother suggestions?
&gt;

I had something weird with my door locks - required 2 cycles to lock the
sliding door iff I had just been driving it. Once it had locked
successfully then it worked fine. I figure something was vibrating loose.
I showed it to the dealer and they &quot;replaced the motor&quot; (or so they told me
at least) under warranty.

There have been 1 or 2 other reports of people having shorts in the wiring
of the locks, but I don't recall any other details offhand.
