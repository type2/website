&lt;&lt; Wanabus? Adventurewagen? Sambabus? Huh?

 I know about type2s, 3s, Westys, Syncros and Carats (although I don't
 EXACTLY know *everything* that makes the latter 2 different).
  &gt;&gt;


Wannabus- &quot;you want a bus&quot;...(kinda obvious...)

Adventurewagen- American company who did aftermarket full camper conversions
to the bus/van...known for it's fiberglass fixed non-poptop Highroof... (a
PITA to drive on windy days..)

Samba- '67 down 21/23 window deluxe.

Syncro- 4 wheel drive.

Carat- fancy 7 pass model w/ weekender int, alloys, fiberglass rocker trim,
fold down table from drivers side, and 2 rear facing removeable theatre style
jump seats...

got it? :&lt;)

good..  :&lt;)
