&gt;server we use now will soon be unavailable.  As a response to this, listees

A little off.  I'm not currently running the list, Gerry is.  And he's
still at the University, but he's tired after several years of 'unsubscribe
me.'

The collection will buy ListServ software and (possibly) a server for the
list and the archive web pages.  Chris and I will run the list jointly,
hopefully prolonging burn-out for both of us :-)
