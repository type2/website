Subject: Dead Tach on '88

The tach just died on my '88 :(

Last thing I did was change the PS oil. I noticed the alt. dash light 
glowing a bit, and found I had bent the connector on the alternator 
when messing with PS hoses. I replaced this connector, then removed &amp; 
cleaned all connectors on the coil. Still no tach.

I removed coil lead to dist. cap when cranking engine to flush the 
PS system - could this have fried the tach somehow? I'm pretty sure 
it's been working since I did the PS on Saturday, but last night it 
was just dead.
Help!
