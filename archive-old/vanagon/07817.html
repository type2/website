Subject: Re: Thermostat and other things???

I know I am entering one of those semi-theological arguements here, and as
an agnostic that can be dangerous.  I have had VW bugs with and without
thermostats installed, and cannot say I found any real difference, but
most of the bugs were near the end of their wear cycles when I got them.  
If the engine went, I either replaced it or sold the car as body 
condition warranted. If I replaced the engine and I had the flaps, I 
reinstalled them, if not, I left them out.

My bus is the first type II I have owned, the thermostat is in and I left
it in.  So far as I know, it works.  If it ever fails I will pull it
without hesitation. 

On &quot;warm up&quot; wear, my understanding has always been that the first 30
seconds to a minute were the most wearing because the oil had drained to
the pan overnight.  Engine temp should not matter (within reason) if this
is really the cause.  I.E. for the first 30 sec everything is dry and
wears, after that the pump has squirted oil everywhere, and the wear
stops.  This should not be temperature dependent, or the wear will
continue until the engine is fully warm (5-6 minutes), yes/no???  Now if
it's -30, the pump could fail to grab oil, or pump it at such ridiculously
high pressures as to blow out the seals, and likewise if your oil ever
reaches &gt;400, it will fail to establish that magic film, but in temperate
climates or if you're not racing this does not seem to happen. 

A proposed, low tech, rule of thumb:
If after a reasonable drive, your dipstick is warm, you're OK.
If it's room temperature or you need a cloth to hold it, you got problems.
