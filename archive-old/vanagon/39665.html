Hi Vanagon Folks,

Well, we've finally made it to California and managed to get back on the list.
 I have favours to ask and would appreciate any info people could pass....

My family and I are looking for a cheap VW camper (to sleep 4) and don't mind
if it needs some work (would probably prefer a cheap buy needing work). 
Arrived here about 3 weeks ago and I came across a 78 adventure wagon in a
lien lot for $500 - it was just running but that sort of price leaves a bit
for parts!  Unfortunately we hadn't found a house at that stage and it
obviously wasn't going to meet our needs for immediate running transport so I
passed (wish I hadn't now)..... we bought a Mercury wagon for transport
(should I say the M word here?).  Talk about a car with no soul.... gotta get
a VW and get rid of that  thing!

Also looking for that 21 or 23 window deluxe microbus.  Any leads or info
appreciated...

Rob K.
