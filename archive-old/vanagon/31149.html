Subject: Mermen, Sound Isulation/Absorbtion

	Oh man, those who missed The Mermen missed a great show! They
played for 3 hours, hit all the high points, and even played some
Christmas tunes :) 

	It ain't cheap, BUT it works: 

	I&quot;ve found the distributor and catalog for self-adhesive
foam we use here at work to deaden big sheet-metal enclosures. The
stuff is called Soundcoat and the Bay Area distributor is

	Dan Codella
	CMG Premier (Mfg Rep)
	960 Saratoga Avenue
	San Jose, CA 95129

	Phone 408 248 3890
	FAX   408 985 0832

	One of the mechanical engineers here had this info and
also found the Soundcoat bulletin on vehicles, &quot;Noise Control For
Off Road Vehicles&quot;. 

	I made 17 copies of the brochure and will be happy to send one
to YOU if you'll send my your address. 


Soundcoat's 
Eastern Facility  1 Burt Drive, Deer Park, LI, NY 11729 5701; 516 242 2200
Western Facility 3002 Croddy Way, Santa Ana, CA 92799 5990;   714 979 0834

	They'll probably be able to point you to the local rep.

	Cost for a standard 2-foot X 4 1/2 foot sheet, 3/4 inch thick,
is around $25-$30. The special two-layer stuff for vehicle applications,
with an emphasis on road-noise damping, is up to $50 a sheet, so you're
talking about $3-5 per square foot, - .1 square Meter - youch!

	The basic product is dense grey foam rubber, with adhesive
and a protective paper on the adhesive. Cut to shape, peel and stick.
Textured foams, additional barriers and non-foam stuff are options. 

	This is what a car manufacturer will use to
deaden their top-of-the-line models, for example, under the hood
of my Corrado is about 30mm (1 1/4&quot;) of this kind of thing...

	Frank, the engineer, says to wipe down the surface with alcohol
and get it squeeky clean before applying the foam. No rust, no dust
or grease or oil, or the sticky stuff on foam just doesn't work.

	Frank also says he's seen people spray something like
rust-preventive spray onto the metal being damped and the just
press the foam into that- makes me wonder about using good foam
rubber and, for example, brushable seam sealer... or spray undercoating.
Might be cheaper than $50 / 9 square feet! for starters....

	Hope this helps someone :)

	Bill
