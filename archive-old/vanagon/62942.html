          For those of you interested in tents for you vans, I bought a 
          Eureka tent last year for my Eurovan.  It is a Eureka A.V.T (All 
          vehicle tent).  
     
     Okay, folks - the web site is at: 
     
        http://www.jwa_dot_com/camping/eureka/eureka.html
     
     and it's a slow one.
     
     I've been navigating around the site and have not found the AVT yet.
     
     Kevin-
     
     How much did you pay?
