Subject: Sadistic truck drivers


Hi all:

	Something I just read over in r.a.vw.a-c reminded I of the day
I drove Ras Bulli Split ['67 Westy] last year.  

I was about 50 miles from home and stopped to tank-up when a double
trailer rig hauled in and shuddered to a stop.  A fellow in his late
50's/early 60's climbed down and walked over to I with an absolutely
huge grin on his face.  He looked Ras Bulli over, asked me what year
it was, commented on my locks and proceeded to tell about how back in
the '60s when he first started driving long haul to/from Texas, they
[he and fellow driver's] use to relieve boredom by passing close to
Microbuses and watching the expression on the faces of the occupants
as the driver attempted to rudder his &quot;mailbox on wheels&quot; through the
wake of the rig.  I told him that I didn't find the story all that
funny.  He shrugged his shoulders and went into the restaurant.  I paid
the pimply faced gas attendant [who informed I that my Bus was a
decade older than he was] and resumed my journey.

I was about twenty minutes down the road when I looked in the mirror
to see eight feet of grill and that same absolutely huge grin for
about three seconds before 100 feet of rig blew by at 90 mph...and I
turned my attention, for the next five seconds or so, to negotiating
with Ras Bulli over precisely in which lane we should be travelling.  I
am glad I could assist someone in reliving their past...:-|

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
