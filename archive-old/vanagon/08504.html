Subject: Re: pizza on the 22nd

Thursday's great for me. I'd prefer a South Bay or Peninsula location if at
all possible, but I'm open to suggestions. I though Bill Abbott's Moutain
View suggestions were very good.

&gt;Allright everybody,
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From your responses, it would seem that a pizza dinner on Thursday the
&gt;22nd would be a good choice. The 2 alternatives would have been Wednesday
&gt;the 21st, which I find too short on notice, and Monday the 26th, which
&gt;seemed feasible but not easy because of relatives, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Now we should decide WHERE to go. Zack's on College in Oakland has yummy
&gt;Chicago style (deep dish) pizza, but they usually also have a *really*
&gt;long line. I'm open to any suggestion and, as far as I am concerned, it
&gt;can be anywhere in the Bay Area. So send in your suggestions and then we
&gt;can vote.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and Maria, my wife, will probably come too. Don't hesitate to bring
&gt;your SOs and kids, too. And, if you don't come in your VW, bring some
&gt;pictures!
&gt;
&gt;If we need to make reservations, it would be good to have an estimate of
&gt;the number of people, too.
&gt;
&gt;So far, the potential participants are:
