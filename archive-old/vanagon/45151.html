Subject: Tire recommendation needed for -85 Vanagon

(I looked in the FAQ but it was surprisingly terse on this subject
 which probably has been beaten to death by now...)

I need new tires for my -85 Vanagon. Right now I have Kelly 195R14C
which I'm not really pleased with. I could use a little better 
traction in dirt, but they are very worn out so that could be the reason.

I drive mostly on black-top but also on quite a few gravel roads, 
sometimes very washboarded, and also in snow (I do have studded 
winter tires though).

I've seen a few of you mention &quot;BFG&quot; but not in what dimensions.
Any other recommendations and help you can give me on this 
decision. It's a jungle of tires out there...

Please reply by mail if this is a subject that has been discussed
to much already...
