Subject: Re: oil pressure vs. oil temp gauge?

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;in the process of rebuilding rumba's powerplant, need to decide on some gauges.
&gt;i'm going for the head temp, tachometer, and either an oil pressure or oil temp
&gt;gauge. question is...hmm, which one? wouldn't an oil pressure gauge be better?
&gt;if the pressure is going down, then wouldn't that mean the temp is going up?
&gt;but if the oil temp goes up, this doesn't necessarily mean the pressure is
&gt;going down. do i have this right? so a pressure guage would be better?
&gt;hehehe does anyone understand what i just typed? i'm not sure i do...:-)

Hey Jonathan
     Put all four guages in.  The more information you have the better off
you are.  Each guage tells only a part of the story.
