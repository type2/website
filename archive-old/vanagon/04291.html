 I have a line on a 1978 bus with a 1974 SUPER BEETLE engine (???!!!). Does
 this raise any hackles? Also the bus is possibly in need of some carb work. He
 said that the bus floods and stalls at stops and that he had it fixed before
 but it's starting to happen again. Anyone hear of this before?

No but I've imagined putting a Type I engine in a 72-79 bus.  If you get a 
look at this unit, please see how they handled the engine tin to body seal?

(If the person I shamelessly stole the start for my bus drawing will email
 me I will give them proper credit.  I have lost track of the original
 posting that contained it but will be able to verify from my archives if
 you send me your original ascii bus.)
