&gt;	Hey Joel, I've wanted to do the same thing! Little tags stuck
&gt;	on all over the van or someone in front with a smoke generator
&gt;	and some sort of manifold to deliver smoke lines in order
&gt;	to see the streamlines around the van. Heck I've even gone
&gt;	as far as to try and locate a plastic model (kit), to place
&gt;	in a flume tank, (no luck, the only one I know of was a
&gt;	Revell model of the vanagon from &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;! and it
&gt;	is unavailable now).
&gt;	Jeez, what a couple of geeks we are!

well ... ha! i have ONE (1) unbuilt revell model (from mexico, no less) of
the vanagon left! there are four  completed versions on my mantle (a camper,
a panel van, a regular bus, and a double cab pickup) and one incomplete
version (a shorty ... well, i just never got around to finishing it). if
anyone finds these things, i'd like to get some more.

now, as to the 'only one', there is a company called Schabak that makes a
1/43 scale series of vanagons. they are all syncros (just means that the
gas cap is in the rear) and cost about $10-15. the vw dealer might be able
to still get the vanagon one. i've found them at a hobby store in atlanta.

and there are other companies (Herpa, Rocco, and Wiking) that make tiny
HO scale (1/87) vanagons of various types ... pickups, high roofs, panel vans,
but no campers!! at least, i've not found any. :(

&gt;	On a different subject, what would be the vanagon equivalent
&gt;	of a &quot;full Chicago&quot; - compass, running boards and an awning?

a company named Dehler makes these things ... high roof, running boards,
bed, stove, shower, toilet, air dam &amp; aero effects siding, just tons of
stuff. looks REALLY expensive. dream on, fellows, dream on.
