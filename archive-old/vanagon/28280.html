Hey Martha. I agree whole heartedly. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing a 
Brad Pitt type posing with a car, or with a product in an advertisement. 
I wouldn't be so pinheaded to decide a product's worth by the person 
standing next to it in the ad. That is to be decided by reputation, and 
by asking you guys at Lenti their opinions. I wouldn't spend as much 
time on a page with Brad standing in his g-string, but I certainly would 
have no problem with that. I like to think I'm completely politically 
incorrect, and proud of it!
