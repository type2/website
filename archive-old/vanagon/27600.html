Subject: Junkyard Dogs (Transplant)

     With over 500 listmembers, maybe a few of you will be haunting
     a junkyard this weekend.

     If you can, take a tape measure and ask if they have any
     diesel Volvos.  Tell them you are considering an engine swap, and
     would like to make a few measurements.

     The Transplant Task Force needs the length of the engine, from the
     front pulley to the bellhousing flange. (Just the engine, not the
     bellhousing.) Any other details appreciated, but the length is likely
     the critical element to the transplant.

     Thanks,

     Tom F.
