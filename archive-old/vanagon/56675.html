Subject: AC forsale 80 vgon

well, i am considering selling off my 1980 vanangon's AC to pay for its
valve job.
my guess is that it works.  the belts are broken and to replace em you
have to pull off the fan housing (its what it looks like to me, if
someone knows of an easier way i can test the ac before i remove it!)
this van had NEVER had anything pulled off of it, so i am guessing that
the belt broke and the ppo never wanted to bother with replacing it.

itll be easy for me to pull while i already have the engine out for the
valve job...

accepting offers,

Steve
