Subject: Re: aux oil cooler as heater core?

&gt;Here's a silly idea I just had, knowing nothing about these issues: If
&gt;a watercooled engine pumps coolant through a heater core, could the
&gt;same be done to provide heat from an auxilliary oil cooler on an
&gt;aircooled engine?  Why or why not?  Is it simply because no-one ever


The diesel vanagon and 2.1l wasserboxers all have a very small water to oil 
heat exchanger neatly fitted between the oil filter and block, the filter 
now screws into the xchanger instaed of the block. Add a circulation pump 
and a vanagon or any heater unit and you are in business, will drop the oil 
temps, and shouldn't boil the coolant.  Might want to also put in the little 
vanagon coolant tank with pressure relief cap and overflow tank.  One trip 
to the junkyard would net you all the bits if you found a 2.1 vanagon, plus 
a small coolant pump.  The oil filters on all busses look similar, bet the 
exchanger would fit with minor mods. Try it!   Tim Smith
