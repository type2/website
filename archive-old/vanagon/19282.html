Hi there everyone

I get the digest, and I'm catching up 'cause I fell behind, which is a 
terrible thing to do with the kind of volume of email I get (VintagVW, 
Vanagon, Porsche)

SO: 
Martha, great borscht recipe &lt;chuckle&gt;
    
Eric, yes I can use a Type IV FI engine, but if you thought 
California was far away...

Somebody wanted to know about 5 cylinder syncros in South Africa. Yes 
that's what we have, the Audi engine gets a modified bell housing to the 
engine (aftermarket guys either get this bell housing or use an adaptor 
plate) This setup can adapt either the older 2.2l carb engines or the 
newer 2.5i engines to the transmission, syncros too. So right now there 
are two different engines available, the 1800 Golf/Jetta/Rabbit engine 
(entry level) and the 2.5. Panel vans get (I think) only the 1800 and 
Syncros/Caravelles only the 2.5

My speedo on the Puma was reading wrong too. So I matched speed with my 
wife (In her car :-) and checked my indicated speed when she was doing 
100 km/h. Now here comes the kludge. Disassemble the speedo, hold the 
little cup thing still with the needle pointing at whatever your 
incorrectly indicated speed was, then move (bend?) the needle to indicate 
the correct speed. (make sense?) Well now my speedo is correct at two 
points, 0 and 100 :-)

And I sorted out the strange vibrations I had at 2000 rpm, by dropping 
the engine &amp; transmission, and fitting the transmission the right way 
(Fingers &amp; eyes crossed, full moon at 12 noon, sacrificed a black goat 
the previous evening ... :)

THOM! I just remembered, _this_ is actually what I wanted to say (hope 
you're still with me.... My alpha test 6V-&gt;12V converter is charging a 
3.6ah gell cell right now. Seems to deliver around 1A max, and hasn't 
blown up yet :) (This is for an alarm for a friends 6V Karmann Ghia, the 
alarm also gets some surgery, but it'll work...)
