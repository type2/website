Subject: Ahhhhh Water Pump

Any suggestions or uplifting words would be appreciated.!
I was trying to check the thermostat on my 84 westy, when the retaining
bolt snapped off.  NOW WHAT do I do.  I can't figure out how to get the
rest of the water pump off and I can't reach it with a drill to drill it
out.   I do NOT like VW vanagon's right now.
