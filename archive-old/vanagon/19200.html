Subject: `74 (???) VIN troubles!!!

Well, you all probably remember the two busses I picked up a couple
of weeks ago for real cheap? Well, on the `74 (?) the front and rear
VIN's don't match!!! D'oh! Well, here's the scoop:

Front VIN: 2252130437

Rear VIN:  2242097947 (This matches the title I have.)

Now, do I now have a parts bus, or a driver...that's the question. I
can get tabs and get her licensed, but will I have a hassle over this?
Should I call the police? (After a quick engine/tranny removal...:)
Or should I cut it up into itsy pieces and scrap it? What it looks
like is that someone cut the rear 1/5 off a titled bus, and attached
it to one that probably doesn't have a title....hmm. They did a really
good job. I didn't notice it until I started scraping some paint off.
I hate learning through experience. &lt;g&gt;

How's about a `74-`75 transmission?
