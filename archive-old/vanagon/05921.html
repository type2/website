Portable Power
  by Jack Innis

A portable generator becomes a valuable asset while camping beyond
electrical hookups.  You can snuggle up with a good book on a rainy
day and listen to the stereo, watch a game on television, or pop a
tape in the VCR and watch a movie without worrying about draining your
coach batteries.

Microwave ovens, coffee makers, mixers, curling irons, etc. that often
mark the distinction between &quot;roughing it&quot; and &quot;living in the lap of
luxury&quot; await your beck and call when you have a generator.

Generators offer versatility not available from solar panels and
inverters.  For example, in addition to camping trips, they can be used
on job sites to run power tools and equipment and at home during power
failures.

Although portable generators are mechanically simple (a gasoline engine
powers a small electric power plant), determining the correct-size
generator can be downright bewildering to the uninitiated.  There are
two basic methods used to calculate your power-consumption needs.

First, you can figure the demands you'll be making on the generator by
adding up all the power requirements of equipment you're using.  For
example: Two 50-watt lights, a hair dryer, a color television and a
coffee maker might call for 1900 watts (see chart below).  Using this
method, you will often end up with a larger and more expensive generator
that has a capacity substantially greater than you normally use, in
order to meet peak demand.

-------  Typical Power Consumption  -----
Light bulb                   25-100 watts
VCR                              75 watts
Stereo                      100-200 watts
Color TV                        300 watts
Microwave                   400-700 watts
Coffee Maker               500-1500 watts

A second method is to select a generator based on price and portability,
then tailor your RV power usage around the generator's output.  For
example: Utilizing a 1000-watt generator, you could run a coffee maker
with the lights on, but leave the television and the hair dryer off
until the coffee has brewed.

&quot;For those willing to compromise, generators in the 1000-watt range are
ideal,&quot; says Guy Shidner, a Honda/Kawaski dealer in Poway, California.
&quot;You get adequate power at a small price in a lightweight, highly
portable, quiet package,&quot; Shidner points out.

In order to try out the second method of genset sizing, we recently
field-tested four portable generators:  the Generac G-1000, the Honda
EX-1000, the Kawasaki GD-700AS and the Yamaha EF-1000.  All four
machines are light enough to be carried by one person, are reasonably
quiet and cost less than $850.  All models tested have a maximum output
of 1000 watts except the Kawasaki GD-700AS.  Kawasaki's 700-watt unit
was included because it has a push-button start, a unique feature that
makes it ideal for people unable or unwilling to tug on a pull-cord to
start the engine.

Standard features common to all the generators we tested were oversize
mufflers with spark arrestors, electronic ignition, circuit breakers,
a pair of 120-volt plug-ins for alternating current (AC) and one 12-volt
DC output, which is handy for charging batteries and running 12-volt
accessories directly.

Modern gensets are designed to run on unleaded regular gasoline.  Fuel-
tank sizes range from 0.66 to 1.0 gallon.  Running times, depending
mostly on load, range from 3.8 to 8.0 hours.

Be safe and considerate when operating generators.  Observe quiet hours
in campgrounds, and avoid dry brush and other fire-hazard areas.  When
boondocking, remember that noise will disturb animals and birds,
especially near water sources that are crucial to their habitat.

One way to reduce the sound level is to place the genset 50 or 100 feet
from camp or neighbors and run an extension cord to your RV.  Use good
quality 12-gauge or 14-gauge three-wire cables with ground connectors
for safety.  Cover connections with plastic to protect them from rain
or damp soil.

Store fuel in a sturdy container designed for gasoline and keep it a
safe distance away from children and the generator.  Always shut off
the engine and allow it to cool before refueling.  Fuel spilled on a
hot engine or muffler could instantly become an inferno.

It's important to understand that portable generators generally produce
more electrical surges than power from &quot;the mains,&quot; and delicate
electronic equipment such as computers may not thrive on generator
power.  Follow manufacturer's instructions and be sure to use surge
protectors.

A word to the wise:  Never operate a generator inside a closed area.
Generators consume oxygen and produce deadly carbon-monoxide fuems.
Follow manufacturer's guidelines for proper usage.

WATT'S WATTAGE
o  Generators are usually classifed by their peak wattage output and
   their continuous rating.  This peak figure can be 10 to 20 percent
   greater than the generator's continuous rating.
o  When appliances with motors are first turned on, they briefly draw
   considerably more current than is required when they are already
   running.  The peak wattage allows for extra start-up power.  The
   rated wattage is for continuous power.
o  To measure the power consumption of your appliances, check the
   specification plates on the back.  If a 120-volt appliance is rated
   only in amps, multiply that figure by 120 to convert amps to watts
   (amps x volts = watts).  Then add the wattages of the appliances
   together for total consumption.
