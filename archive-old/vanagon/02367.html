&gt; 
&gt; well its almost friday so ill start
&gt; 
&gt; on james' thread -
&gt; 
&gt; how many people do you need on average before two will have the same
&gt; birthday (not birthyear) ?
&gt; 
&gt; try it at your next bugfest/party (the nerds will be the ones who whip out
&gt; their HPs(not me, ive got a laptop instead:-))
&gt; 

You know, I started typing something about this and then I backed it 
up.  I don't know what the exact odds are but if you get something 
like any 30 people together it is pretty hard to not find two people 
in the group with the same birthday.  Who woulda thunk?  All those 
math classes and I end up a librarian.  :(
