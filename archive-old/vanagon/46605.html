&gt; Hi Jonathan,
&gt; 
&gt;   You suggested that I &quot;stated you drove 2600 miles and got there the 
&gt; next morning?&quot;

well you wrote: 

&gt;&gt;steel channel with a hitch welded in place, I picked up the tow dolly
&gt;&gt;from the now closed rental business.  The next morning I was rested and
&gt;&gt; drove I-80 west for a 2600 mile hot summer adventure.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;   The next morning, we backed the dolly to the Reliant's front and I used
&gt;&gt; a &quot;come-a-long&quot; to pull the front wheels into the dolly's securing wheel
&gt;&gt; wells and played with chains, wires and spun my prayer wheel.

that's what confused me and all i wanted to know is if you made that 
kinda time what i could do to my engine so i could too!

&gt;   Your e-mail address appears very like my &quot;beemer&quot; friends in Stamford 
&gt; Ct.  Interesting.
