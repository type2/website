&gt; I would like some advice regarding a gas/exhaust smell that seems to enter 
&gt; the interior of my '71 Westy via the heat channel.  My muffler, muffler 
&gt; gaskets and fresh air hose are leak free as far as I can see.  Also I have 
&gt; new &quot;rubber doughnut seals&quot; clamped firmly within the plastic 
&gt; accordian-like tubes to the heat exchangers.  So where's the leak?--Well, I 
&gt; have 2 possible suspects: 1) While my rear engine seal is perfectly mated 
&gt; to the engine tin, the front seal does not make contact, possibly providing 
&gt; a source for contaminated air to get sucked into the fan shroud (and of 
&gt; course this is bad for engine cooling).  But I don't think this is as 
&gt; likely a source of my problem (especially when the bus is cruising) as 2) 
&gt; The probability of a cracked or well-rusted pipe *within* my heat 
&gt; exchangers.  The heat exchanger sheet metal has no rust or perforations, 
&gt; although my control valves have rusted permanently open.  
&gt; 	Has anyone out there ever dissected a heat exchanger and found such 
&gt; otherwise good heat exchanger? Any similar exhaust smell experiences or 
&gt; troubleshooting tips?  Your suggestions are much appreciated.  Thanks.
&gt; 
  An exhaust smell would likely be from the heat exchangers, either the 
  ones under the engine or those bulbous things that are part of the 
  muffler. A gas smell, on the other hand, could be caused by a leak of the
  fuel system in the engine compartment (fuel pump/line, carburetor, etc.).
  The source of air to be heated is the engine compartment air, and the 
  engine cooling fan moves it on its way.
