Wasn't there a post a while back that VWoA will accept a core even if demo'd
by a thrown rod as long as the case hadn't been split?  Or have I been
drinking again.

I reply:
VWoA gets their rebuilds from a company in Ontario, CA whom will take back
ANY core as long as the damage was from within. Blown rod? They'll take it!
Fire? I don't think so..... I tried to get this info from VWoA very early
in my blown Westy fiasco and was snubbed. Bought a used core which was
dropped on its head and broken in transit (still trying to get my money
back on that one!) and finally agreed to pay the additional $1500 the
dealer wanted since my core was &quot;shot&quot;. Had the sparkling rebuild installed
(1500 miles now) and received a lovely orange slip from VWoC w/ serial
number and other wonderful factoids ie: compression,etc on my new engine.
Also printed on this slip was this phone number 416-288-3001. For the hell
of it, I spoke w/ Dennis at that number and found that my blown core was
acceptable and to ship it on in. Three months later I sent a blown core to
VWoC and a &quot;feisty&quot; letter to VWoA for jacking me around on this. Still w/
me? You should know that I got a check from VWoA $1500 for my troubles and
needless to say I am thrilled! My contact at VWoA was Robert Schoof and he
seemed like a genuinely nice fellow... There is justice in America!
