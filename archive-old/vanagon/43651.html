Subject: Re: 78 Timing Marks?

&gt;I have a question concerning the timing marks on my 78 Engine.

I had the wrong pulley on my '68 and it ran hot until I replaced it with a
degree wheel. I static timed it to the mark on the pulley, and checked it
again after I had replaced it with the degree wheel. It was around 12 =B0
BTDC!
