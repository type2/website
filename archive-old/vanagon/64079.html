The starter on my '81 has a seperate solenoid.  I know, because when I 
replaced it many years ago I went to VWofA to purchase it.  Naturally, 
the counter guy had to order it.  And even though I repeatedly told him 
my starter was different than the &quot;standard&quot; manual transmission starter 
I saw in my manual (I found out later VW changed the starter in mid-year) 
he growled at me &quot;all I need to know is whether it's manual or 
automatic.&quot;  So, naturally, when it arrived, it was the wrong part and, 
naturally, this was the start of the 4th of July weekend, so I had to 
wait another 7 days or so to get the right part.

Last time I ever went to VWofA for parts........
