This may sound crazy but try WILIAMS LECTRA SHAVE, a lotion used for
shaving w/electric shavers.
No joke I've used it to clean a lot of stubborn stains and grimes and
most times it works.

&gt; Hey all,  Need some advice on removing STUBBORN brake dust from alloy wheels.
&gt; Don't even bother suggesting stuff like &quot;Armor All wheel cleaner&quot; and the like.
&gt; Lemme just say I have even tried mineral spirits and a stiff bristle brush to no
&gt; avail. The damn stuff is on there like paint!
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got any solutions of a solution that'll take this crap off without
&gt; eating up the clearcoat?
