Subject: /f life of mailing lists

Subject: FW: Life cycle of Lists (fwd)
 
This came from another list I am on but seemed appropriate to this list.
 
&gt;This seemed like a good time to post this item from the Humor List.
&gt;Michael Forster
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;THE NATURAL LIFE CYCLE OF MAILING LISTS
&gt;
&gt;Every list seems to go through the same cycle:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Initial enthusiasm (people introduce themselves, and gush
&gt;     alot about how wonderful it is to find kindred souls).
&gt;
&gt;2.  Evangelism (people moan about how few folks are posting to
&gt;     the list, and brainstorm recruitment strategies).
&gt;
&gt;3.  Growth (more and more people join, more and more lengthy
&gt;     threads develop, occasional off-topic threads pop up)
&gt;
&gt;4.  Community (lots of threads, some more relevant than others;
&gt;     lots of information and advice is exchanged; experts help other
&gt;     experts as well as less experienced colleagues; friendships
&gt;     develop; people tease each other; newcomers are welcomed with
&gt;     generosity and patience; everyone---newbie and expert alike---
&gt;     feels comfortable asking questions, suggesting answers, and
&gt;     sharing opinions)
&gt;
&gt;5.  Discomfort with diversity (the number of messages increases
&gt;     dramatically; not every thread is fascinating to every
&gt;     reader; people start complaining about the signal-to-noise
&gt;     ratio; person 1 threatens to quit if *other* people don't
&gt;     limit discussion to person 1's pet topic; person 2 agrees
&gt;     with person 1; person 3 tells 1 &amp; 2 to lighten up; more
&gt;     bandwidth is wasted complaining about off-topic threads
&gt;     than is used for the threads themselves; everyone gets
&gt;     annoyed)
&gt;
&gt;6a.  Smug complacency and stagnation (the purists flame everyone
&gt;      who asks an 'old' question or responds with humor to a serious
&gt;      post; newbies are rebuffed; traffic drops to a doze-producing
&gt;      level of a few minor issues; all interesting discussions happen
&gt;      by private email and are limited to a few participants; the
&gt;      purists spend lots of time self-righteously congratulating
&gt;      each other on keeping off-topic threads off the list)
&gt;
&gt; OR
&gt;
&gt;6b.  Maturity (a few people quit in a huff; the rest of the
&gt;     participants stay near stage 4, with stage 5 popping up briefly
&gt;     every few weeks; many people wear out their second or third
&gt;     'delete' key, but the list lives contentedly ever after)
