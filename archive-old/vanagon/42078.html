&gt; I still think the whole thing is nuts. All I need is more surface area to
&gt; slow me down. Driving my Vanagon is like pushing a 4'x8' sheet of plywood
&gt; down the freeway~! =) 
&gt; I need a flippin sail or something.  I would attach a 4'x8' sheet of clear
&gt; plex set on a 30 degree angled and attached to the front if it weren't for
&gt; all of the skateboarders in my neighborhood.


Sounds like you want a Eurovan.  We have that sloped nose.  Not 30 
degrees but much more than the flat nosed buses.

Of course I have to bring up the EV but what else 
would you expect out of me......
