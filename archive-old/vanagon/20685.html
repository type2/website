&gt;OH-oh.  Dean!:  I'm not sure I would recommend posting info like this

Here goes nothing...  fun with nails.. find a small metal tin, pint size, 
with a screwtop lid. Punch a nice fine finishing nail through the lid, from 
the inside, just enough to make a good nozzle. Fill tin partly with your 
favorite flammable fluid, gasoline being just fine. Then simply place in the 
middle of a hot campfire and wait for the rocket blast of flames skyward. 
The top or a seam will let go if you get enough pressure built up, and you 
will! If the tin tips over you lose bigtime BTW! Almost as much fun as 
pitching in a handful of .22 shells
