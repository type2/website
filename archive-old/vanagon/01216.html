Subject: vanagon st. wheel angle


I'm about to acquire the '81 camper I've been having some
refurbishing work done on.  Am looking forward to it in every
way EXCEPT one:  the damned arcane angle of the steering wheel.
People tell me I'll get used to it, but I'm curious to hear from
other vanagon owners on this matter.  

Further, has anyone out there figured out a way to retrofit
another wheel, or alter the angle of the existing one?  If
so, would be curious how...

Thanks,

Martha Rubin
