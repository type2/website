Hi Volks,

	I just got my Feb. '96 dune buggies &amp; hot VWs.  I was gonna
throw the whole thing away &amp; just save their rad, sano calendar
centerfold (I usually only read it for the pictres), but then I
noticed the big &quot;dyno test&quot; article.  They took a GEX longblock &amp;
measured its power output as a functin of rpm, then started doin'
all the [ahem] mild-to wild mods you might be considering for your
resto-custom (or something to that effect).

	But seriously, I thought it was kind of interesting &amp; plotted
out the results.  (The article only had data in a table.)  You can
see the plots at:

There were a couple of screwy things about the test imho, so I put those
points on the page as well.  Curious to hear your thoughts, etc.  They'll
continue the test next month... their big question:  &quot;can we beat 200hp?&quot;
Notice that the cover blurb says &quot;50-203hp.&quot;  Gosh, ruins the suspense...;)
