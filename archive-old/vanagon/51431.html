&gt; &gt; Well, for those who haven't yet seen this weeks Star Trek Voyager, there's
&gt; &gt; a bay window bus used as the &quot;getaway&quot; vehicle in one scene. It's got a

Hey guys,

I've always said, &quot;there's a Bettle in every movie&quot;.  To add to that,
There's a bus in every foreign flick&quot;.

Just something to look for when the flick gets boring.

Oh yeah, don't jump up  and down in the movie theater when you see one
cause I'll be the guy behind telling you to sit down and shuddup.
