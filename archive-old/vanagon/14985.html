&gt;&gt; No Air Conditioning/inadequate ventilation in 122 degree Arizona &gt;&gt;
summers (Single Cabs especially).
Florida heat isn't as temperate, but the humidity will kill you. Safari's
are the only thing to have in Florida with a SingleCab....

&gt;&gt; Conversely, lack of heat in Winter, (Every where)

&gt;&gt; Dealing with theiving, lazy, slow as heck bodymen from Hell.

&gt;&gt; Locating German cases that aren't 60 over.


How `bout the design of the exhaust gaskets on the type 4's, or even
just the prospect of remounting the exhaust after you've pulled it ....

OR

Have you ever lost a sparkplug to the cavernous depths of your engine
tin?

OR

You mistake a nick on the fan pulley for your timing mark ? 

OR

Why did VW decide to make the rear pan section on later (68- ??) busses a
permanant fixture instead of the older detachable design?

hmmmmmm!
