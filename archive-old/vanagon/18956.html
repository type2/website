I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE ....  I just purchased an 87 syncro and was made aware
of the problem by an 86 vanagon owner.  He had to shell out 2.5K for a new
engine.  Ironically two days after I purchased my syncro it was devoid of
coolant.  I am keeping close track of this problem but I wonder if we
shouldn't band together on this one.  Hmmm.... sounds like we might have a
class action lawsuit here.
