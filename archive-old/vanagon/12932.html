Subject: Re: VANAGON digest 371

	Tim McDermott is looking for Vanagon repair pannels-
	I just talked to The Bus Boys and they say they have Vanagon
stuff as well as T1/T2. I can't remember whether The Bus Stop have
Vanagon also, but anyway, call 800 information (1-800-555-1212) and
ask for the toll-free numbers of these outfits...
	This kind of info is why Dune Buggies and Hot VWs magazine exists!
