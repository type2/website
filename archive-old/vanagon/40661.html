&gt;OK, while reassembling and installing my engine (2.0 L, '83 Westy), I 
&gt;notices only one mistake (knock on wood).  I put the Temperature Sensor II 
&gt;in the wrong place (by cyl #4 instead of #3).  Now I know that # 3 is the 
&gt;hottest one so not having the RTD on that particular cylinder is probably 
&gt;not a good idea, but can i wire it across the engine to its electrical 
&gt;recepitical?  Or should I bite the bullet, spend some more clams and get 
&gt;another sensor and install it in the right place? (I think I just answered 
&gt;my own question).

Only one hole on the head should be large enogh to fit the sensor.  Will not
make much difference anyway.  Sensor only controls warm up enrichment and
turns on the O2 sensor at about 120F.  You will not be able to tell
difference on this one.
