Subject: WTB: 1988 or later Vanagon Westfalia

hey now,

a friend of mine wants to buy a 1988 or later Vanagon Westy in the price
range of $6,000-$10,000 for his wife as a present i think. what a present.
anyways....he would prefer it not be a synchro. location is not as much as a
factor as it condition. cherry would be nice. manual transmission only.

thanks!
