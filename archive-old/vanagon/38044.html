&gt;&gt;Know what I want? Package shelf. It's really the only thing I envy in
&gt;&gt;Splits except the swinging doors. The package shelf is useful, the space is
&gt;&gt;otherwise wasted, and no way could you do it in a front-engine. I will
&gt;&gt;never understand why they dropped it.

Forgive my split ignorance, is the parcel shelf the one under dash? I 
 saw something in the WCM catalog , part # 211-110 $125 for 68-79 that 
 was described as such. If they are that handy I may whip something up.

I don't know about any catalog, but i did scrounge a pair of under dash trays
for a 68-79 bus, which are now holding stuff in my dad's 69 camper.    They
screw in easily, are a fitted metal frame, ibelieve, covered with black
rubber that holds a mesh webbing.   This way all the crumbs fall through,
instead of building up on the package tray, and are more accessible for the
mice.    I believe i heard they were for sale currently for ~$75 a pair, but
im not sure.  Thats the trays, not the mice, which come in bulk.
