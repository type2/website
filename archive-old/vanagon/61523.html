Well, being from the Bronx, we tend to put &quot;protected by 357 Magnum&quot;   
sticker on the window.  However, it usually doesn't work. So, a friend in   
Brooklyn with VW who uses the cigarette lighter as the cut-off switch.   
 He simply takes the lighter when he parks the car.  Another friend had a   
removable steering wheel.  It is supposedly designed so that even if the   
wheel is not present, the thief can't put a wrench around the column and   
drive off.

After reading a few stories of car and van theft on the VW USENET
groups, I'm wondering what people on the list are doing to minimize
the risk of theft.  I realize that a determined thief will get your
vehicle, no matter what.  But how to best deter the small time
hotwire and smash 'n grab variety?

Alarms, hidden cutoff switches, steering wheel locks, or just
&quot;fuggedaboudit?&quot;  I know we're not driving Testarossas here, but I'd
like to hang on to the vehicles I have.

Ideas?  Experiences?  I've been fortunate not to have been a victim
of any vehicle related crime, so statistics would say I'm due.  :-(
