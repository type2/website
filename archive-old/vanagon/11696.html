Subject: f. Red Rock Convouy

For A. Gibb &amp; D. Swartze (and anyone else in O.C. - S.D.
area),

I've asked for and recieved Friday, March 24th off.  Would
either/both/anyone want to plan to meet somewhere and
convouy up to Red Rock?  As  a starter, Alice lives somewhere
in/near Irvine and David is coming from S.D., I live in Mission
Viejo so could suggest perhaps the Laguna Hills Mall off of the
5 frwy?  How about it?

-Scott.
