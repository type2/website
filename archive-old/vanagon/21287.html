I'm glad I don't live in Canada.  Couldn't afford it.  We have both items in
stock all da time, original from the MFR (We go around VW heh heh) :)

Water Faucet  Dealer List $85.80  Bus Boys Price $64.95  US $

Water Tank Pump  Dealer List $67.10  Bus Boys Price $49.95  US $

Drive on down on your next vacation and stop by.  Put 'em in yourself and
drive back.  No Duty :)
Ain't life great?  :)
