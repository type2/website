  Dear list members,
  I hate to bring this thread up again, but I have a problem.  I want
  some
  touch up paint and can't find my code.  I looked under the dash,
  under
  the drivers seat in the battery compartment, in all of the door
  jams, all
  to no avail.  I even found someone else in town with the same color
  westy, but they do not have the official name of their color or the
  plate
  or code either.  We have 86 westies, mine is a full camper GL, the
  other
  is a weekender.  I think it is the Bronze Beige Metalic color, but
  the
  'beige' in the name throws me for a loop; is there any beige in this

  color? or is it mostly bronze? Does anyone know what Savanah Beige
  is? Is
  the Merian Brown a flat brown?  (I got these names off of Joels list
  in
  the archives for the 86 Synchros).  I looked around for pictures on
  the
  web to see if I could identify the color, but found not many
  pictures of
  vanagons.  Anyway, if anyone knows these answers or knows where I
  can see
  some pictures of these colors, that would help alot. Thanks
  Gretchen

 Savannah Biege is a lite brown kind of diarrhea looking color found on
the Bugs starting in 1968 or at least mine was .  NAPA  auto parts used
to carry the paint in spray cans and in quarts.
