Newbie here... but a couple of questions.
First, 85 westie camper 130k miles, extra third seat (I feel lucky)..
The nose of this one seems high. I've compared to newer campers. They seem 
to have about a fist worth of height between the front tire and the exterior 
wheel well. I seem to have about two fist heights. (sorry for the imprecision).
Shocks seem fine..
Are the shocks longer for this year model and newer models have shorter ones??
Any difference for gas mileage (Which is I guess what the resulting lower nose
would create).

Tires: I've noted that newer Vanagons are running 205 x 75 x 14. While 
the older units are running 185 x14. ALso, alloy rims are 6&quot; and steel are 
5 1/2&quot;. I'd feel safer running on wider tires (very doable I believe) and 
don't have an idea if the wider rims will do anything. 
Any recommendations on wider tires? Comments on Rims??

Finally, is it vanity or would that little black spoiler under the chin
of newer Vanagons do anything but look better?? It actually seems to be
independant of the integrated plastic bumpers.

Thanks all
Kerry
