Subject: Re: Transporter Badges?

&gt;Anyone on the list know how to go about getting Transporter or 
&gt;Transporter GL badges from Europe (or Mexico)?

Well I'd go down to the scrapyard and pick up a handfull off the ground :-) 
Seriously, there is a place near my parents house that has dozens of 
transporters, I'll have a look next time I'm up there and get as many as I 
can stuff in my pockets.
