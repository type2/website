Subject: 20 years ago today....

Sung to the tune of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
[With appologies to Lennon/McCartney]

It was twenty years ago today,
My 56 beetle came to stay
I put in storage for a while
But now I drive it with a smile

So may I introduce to you
The bug I've had for all these years
My Black 56 Deluxe Volkswagen Bug....


On July 11, 1975, after rolling a 62 Sunroof Bug four days
before, I purchased my '56 bug for the paltry sum of $75. It
was sitting sad and forelorn behind an old gas station. Engine
seized, paint oxidized, bumpers rusted, etc.

Who would have thought that 20 years later I would still have it.
It outlasted my first wife! Who says bugs aren't loyal!!  8-)
