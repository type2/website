While channel surfin' this afternoon...hey its boring 'round here..
especially since &quot;vanagon&quot; has been so quiet!! Where is everyone?...

There was a short blirb on CNN's World Report from Polish TV about
the locals in Warsaw being pissed at the local mafia...I digress...
In the background shots were a handful of T4 (EuroVan to the 
uninitiated in things Typ 2) Police Vans. They had the dual
back doors, appeared to be 9 passenger vans with the
rear seat facing out the back door.
