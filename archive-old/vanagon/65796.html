&gt; Here in California the smog checking started earlier than elsewhere and

&gt; before I got it.  Two years after buying it I needed to get it smogged
&gt; and found out that they wouldn't touch it because the fuel delivery
&gt; system had been modified, it has to be stock or you'll never get it
&gt; smogged.

&gt; It's a worthwhile price to pay for clean air, these laws have really
&gt; made a terrific difference here in California--we all remember how bad
&gt; the air used to be here.  But the sad truth is that in the end only the
&gt; really well-taken-care-of machines can survive the smog laws, and a lot
&gt; of beautiful old bugs and busses will probably have to be scrapped.  So
&gt; love your machine and keep it stock, and she'll always bring you home...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am looking for a conversion kit for a 1984 Westpahlia
&gt; &gt; (water-cooled)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to convert it from fuel injection to standard carburetion.  this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;obviously requires a new manifold, hardware linkages and, of
&gt; &gt; course,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;carburetors.
&gt; &gt; Thom et. al.,
&gt; &gt; Be careful, -very- careful in considering removing your EFI for carbs.
&gt; &gt; New EPA standards are being forced in from the Feds US wide (1991
&gt; &gt; Clean
&gt; &gt; Air Act) and are going to require that your van be smogged or at least
&gt; &gt; visually inspected. Carbs will not match the book on standard
&gt; &gt; equipment
&gt; &gt; and therefore you will not be able to pass inspection and register you
&gt; &gt; vehicle.
&gt; &gt; Here in Texas, our state is already coming into compliance with the
&gt; &gt; 1991
&gt; &gt; CAA and I have studied this -federal- program intently and one of the
&gt; &gt; main tenets is to get the old smoggers off the road. Period!
&gt; &gt; In fact the Chemical Plants, there are few around Houston, are allowed
&gt; &gt; to purchase smog credits from salvage yards that squeeze old smogger
&gt; &gt; cars. The title to your old vehicle now has smog-credit value to the
&gt; &gt; smog producing system (Chemical plants and industry in general) that
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; being bought and sold.
&gt; &gt; Keep your Vanagon as close to stock as possible and maintain the
&gt; &gt; system
&gt; &gt; or you could be in for a heartbreak later in getting everything back
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; stock. Believe me, when this happens, the govt. (EPA) wants you
&gt; &gt; heartbroken such that you will throw up your hands and send your
&gt; &gt; 'smogger' to the squeezer.
&gt; &gt; Keep it stock and Maintained!
