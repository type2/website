MT-90 (75W/90W) was recommended for Vanagons. I was going to use MTL 
(75W/80W) because I thought Bentley recommended 80W. Does anyone have any 
suggestions between 80W &amp; 90W ? 

They gave me a dealer in Easton and Waynsboro,PA if that is closer for 
you Karl. Thanks to you and to all on the list that offered info on the 
tow eye hitches. Am making up my feeble mind now.
