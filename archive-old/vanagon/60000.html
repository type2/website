Subject: Vanagon window rubber trim

The plastic &quot;chrome&quot; insert for the window rubber trim is strictly cosmetic.
There is no problem with removing it. I double checked this with West Coast 
Metric which makes and supplies Vanagon window rubber. Personally I like my
Vanagon with the rubber trim removed.

PS: West Coast Metric supplies an updated version of window rubber seals for
    Vanagons that does not have the plastic trim piece at all.
