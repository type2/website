Subject: 71 Crew Cab questions

I'm new to this list.  Joel Walker saw my posting concerning a 71 crew cab on
the vintage vw list and invited me over here for a visit (thanks Joel!).  

I'm in N. Virginia and I've been attempting to work a deal on a 71 crew cab
that seems to be in pretty fair condition.  It's pretty solid underneath
(owner had VW Restorations in Manassas replace the inner rocker panels, front
and rear outriggers and  jack points).  The body is pretty rusted (outer
rocker panels?) along the full length bottom part of the body on both sides.
 The bed is not bad (surface rust) and two out of three drop gates are good
(the left side gate is rusted through).  The interior is fair (but needs some
good cleaning).  The owner has the canvas cover for the bed, too.
 Mechanically:  it runs okay.  Engine and tranny are in good shape.  Steering
is tight (good) and brakes are solid.

My questions concern getting it in decent enough shape (appearance wise) so I
don't get complaints from the homeowners association about having an eyesore
parked in the drive (my wife won't give up her side of the garage and my 68
vert occupies the other side).  Are there body replacement parts available?
 My Wolfsburg West catalogue has parts for earlier busses but not a 71?  Do
other non-cab bus parts fit on crew cabs?  What mail order parts houses do
you folks go to for body parts?  I'll need a side drop gate -- anyone have a
decent one for sale?

The owner has been asking 3,000.  Recently he has said 2,500 is as low as he
will go.  Does this sound reasonable given the description?  

I've enjoyed the list over the past week and look forward to any advice you
have for me.

Thanks,  Bob Busick    (OrioleBob_at_AOL_dot_com)  '68 Beetle (vert)
