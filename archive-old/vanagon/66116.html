Subject:      Leaking Heads - aargghh! - What to do?

Am I living the Vanagon owners nightmare?

I've got some coolant dripping from my right side head. (An '87, 120k mi.)
What should I do initially? And then what should I do after that?

I can try Bars Leak, right? How long should I give it a try? A week or
couple of months? After that can I have the heads retightened?

Is there any hope in going to a dealer and asking about work done under
a recall?. Is there info on the 'net about this?

Any other advice?

Sorry for all the questions but I really didn't think this would happen to
me (I've used the dealer supplied coolant, etc.)

Thanks in advance....

Gordon
