Subject: Parting out '88 Vanagon

I am parting out an 88 vanagon.  parts available include auto trans, fuel
injection parts, interior, glass, and A/C parts.  Also full suspension
pieces,  Steering rack and engine spoken for.

E-mail for needs. No reasonable offers refused.  Whatever does not get sold
will have to be scrapped as I have no room to store the parts.

Dennis
