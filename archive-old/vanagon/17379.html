Subject: '81 Westy - $1500

There has been an ad in the Dallas Morning News this week as follows:
Nice '81 Westfalia, bad comp $1500, 289-4969 day  (area code is 214)

I couldn't resist calling, so....

The number is a small repair shop - he is selling it for the owner.  The 
engine appears to have a dropped valve seat, so 1 cyl has 0 compression.  
The others are around 100.  Is white (or is it ivory), body and Westy 
equipment in really clean shape.  Only damage is slight bumper, rear apron 
damage - backed into pole.

Thought it might be of interest.
