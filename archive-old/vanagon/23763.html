Subject: RE: '72 weird starting problem


&gt;Except over the past few days it
&gt;has been doing the strangest thing, it won't start sometimes. It has
&gt;been very damp and humid and rainy here, turn the key and nothing or
&gt;maybe a minor click, throw a starter 60amp on it and she fires right
&gt;up, next time starts great, no ryhme or reason to when it starts or
&gt;doesn't. The battery seems to be holding a full charge and the
&gt;alternator seems to be doing it's job. I advised him to clean his
&gt;terminals (having had a bus for 2 1/2 weeks myself I am now qualified
&gt;to give free unrequested advise). So he is doing that this morning,
&gt;could the high humidity have something to do with this problem?
&gt;Anyone else ever have this occur?


Me! Me! And probably everyone else who has ever played
with VWs for any length of time.

On mine, it was the long wire from the ignition switch to the
starter solenoid. It was loose at the solenoid end-- just a
push-on connection. Clean it up a little, tighten a little (careful,
it breaks easily), push it back on, and give it a try.
