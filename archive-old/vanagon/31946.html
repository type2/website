Split Screen Van club of UK here....sounds like an excellent resource; if you
want to have sources of bits for Split Buses in UK let me know and I'll get
you some names of retailers who do good quality repro and NOS stuff - for
example apparently you guys in America have problems in getting the salt and
pepper vinyl which you can get from Karmann Konnection in Essex (not
contactable on the internet yet) You can also get hold of s/hand,
reconditioned and NOS stuff from our club spares, but some spares are now
restricted to members only as they are really hard to get hold of....talk to
Tom at NEATO .. he might be able to help out .. in fact I wouldn't be
surprised to see NEATO on the net soon .. (hello Tom .. are you there.. :-) )
If you ever want anything about the split bus scene this side of the pond then
let me know. How do I access your web site? I am toying with trying to set up
the SSVC's own web site...any advice to a total newbie....fortunately I think
I might have some people to help in actually inputting and designing the
pages....
meanwhile SSVC is now back on line after a temporary system breakdown; I'm off
to spend the next few hours reading all this accumulated mail and especially
stuff on Split Buses..!  Dave.
