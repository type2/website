Subject: 5 speed tranny

Hi folks,

I'm looking for a 5 speed tranny for an '82 diesel vanagon.  I know there
were just a few ever produced but I figured &quot;what the hey&quot; maybe you folks
know where to look.  Any for sale out there?  Anybody know of a good place
to look?
thanks,
John

'84 Westy (Betty)
