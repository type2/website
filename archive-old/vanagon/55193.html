&gt; Five days prior to a month long pilgrimage to snow country my 85 westy's
&gt; head gasket let go. I Have the replacement kit but am lacking in knowledge
&gt; and even more deficient in the wallet. Can anyone recommend a mechanic
&gt; within 70 miles of where I live (AAA+) in Central NH right near the Maine
&gt; border, a small town callled wolfeboro, NH about 1 hour north of
&gt; Portsmouth, NH. Very bummed about this situation any help would greatly be
&gt; appreciated.

    Mark at J&amp;M Imports in Plymouth can do it for you. I recommend you 
have the heads machined while they are off as well, IF the pitting is 
signifigant.  I had my heads machined at Manchester Engine...they did 
a beautiful job.  Machining these heads is alot more complicated than 
your average 'head' as the inside of the bore (in the head) must be machined as 
well........   while you are at it, have them glass bead the outside 
too.  than you will smile when the engine cover is off........  AND 
make sure you use VW gaskets....see the list
