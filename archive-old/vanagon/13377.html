&gt; 
&gt; I know that different countries use different names, but can someone 
&gt; tell me the differences between the different names that people are 
&gt; using on the list? I've got a '69 bay window bus, sometimes I call it 
&gt; a bus, sometimes a camper (it's got windows and a devon eurovette 
&gt; interior) and sometimes a combi. So what are Vanagons, Eurovans, 
&gt; Buses, Kombis, Syncros and Campers?

Ok, brief, probably error filled rundown of titles, names, and nicknames:

Bus types:

Microbus - 50ish to '67 Transporters, the ones with split windshields.  
Buses    - '68 to '79 Transporters, which looked like typical VW busses.
Vanagons - '80 to '93 (?).  Squared, modern looking busses.  Water cooled
	    from '84 on.
Eurovan  - Newest &quot;Bus&quot; from VW.  Front mounted engine, water cooled.

Model names:

Panel - A bus without windows, and usually rear interior.. usually for 
	delivery or work vehicles.
Kombi - A bus with a camper interior, featuring bed, storage space, etc.
Westfalia - Buses fitted with a true &quot;Camper&quot; interior, usually featuring
            a sink, bed, cooktop, etc.
Single Cab - A VW Pickup truck, with a cargo bed behind it.
Double Cab - Similar to a Single Cab, but had a 'extended cab' w/ bench seat.
Syncro - Vanagons with 4 wheel drive (or is it AWD?), all were water cooled.

Hmm.. got all of the ones you asked about.  Anyone want to add any more?
