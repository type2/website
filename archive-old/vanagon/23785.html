Subject: 1st day Junking!!!

Well what a great day,
My best friend and I travelled around going to junk yards and found a 
few things. Best of all I found a bunch of the little things that I had 
wanted to repair or replace, handles, knobs, pulls etc. It was such fun 
going into the places and having them say yeah we gotta couple busses 
out back help yourself. If anyone needs a '74 ish pop top in perfect 
condition (at least that is how it looked, let me know and I can direct 
you to it). Now if I can just find the black rubber things that fit 
around the base of the captains seats (new or used) I will be set.
Peace,
Scoob
