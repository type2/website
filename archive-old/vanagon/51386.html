Subject: Dallas Tx area residents, here I come

All,

I am going to be in Plano for a class from 11/17 - 11/22.  If any of you
Dallas/Ft Worth area list members are interested in getting together and
having a beer, dinner, whatever during that week, I'm game.  I'll be in
my 79 Westy. Let me know, and we can plan for it.  

If any of you are driving on IH-35 Sunday evening between Austin, and
Plano, and see a slightly used Mexican Beige Westy, with the Vanagon
list sticker on the lower left corner of the rear window, don't hesitate
to wave, honk, flip me the bird, whatever it takes to let me know your
out there.

Cheers,

David
