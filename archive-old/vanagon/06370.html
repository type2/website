&gt; 
&gt; Here's the deal:
&gt; 1972 VW Bus, now has single carb.
&gt; Recent piston seal replacement.
&gt; Recent expensive brake overhaul I didn't understand.
&gt; Runs fine when I jump start it, probably needs new battery.
&gt; Yours for $400, includes 20 gallon fish tank.
&gt; It's painted a pretty green.
&gt; All the original interior stuff intact, except roof liner.
&gt; The catch?
&gt; No heat.
&gt; I've got to get rid of it because I'm moving.
&gt; Please respond quickly, via e-mail.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Robert M. Bryan
