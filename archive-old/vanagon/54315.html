Subject: 88 Vanagon with &quot;thing&quot; on steering column??

Hi all,

I saw an 88 Vanagon GL Camper in a parking lot the other day and looked
inside.
On top of the steering column, between the steering wheel and gages,  the
usual plastic cover piece was replaced by something I hadn't seen before.  
The cover piece on this van had a large &quot;display&quot; like thing on it.  It wa
molded into the piece and must have come from the factory.  It protruded up
from the usual slope toward the gages and presented the driver with a 1.25&quot;
tall x 2&quot; wide rectangle that looked like it was dark red plastic.  Sort of
like a warning indicator or display of some sort.

Many cars now place their emergency flasher switch &amp; light in this position,
but this van had those in the usual position on the right side of the
instrument binnacle with the defroster switch.

Any one have any idea what this is?  I'm not too familiar with the Camper
models, but have looked them over in the past &amp; haven't noticed anything like
this.

By the way, the van has a manual tranmission and was not a Syncro.

Wondering,
Jim Davis
