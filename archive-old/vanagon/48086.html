Subject: EV Parts Hauler...


To date the EV has hauled passengers, kids, furniture, a dining room set, 
etc., but today was its first mission as parts hauler. I finally got around 
to getting down to my local VW dealer where the parts manager volunteered to 
pull the frozen brake drums off of my spare tranny for the '56 beetle.

So out went the two jump seats (5 minutes - remove and bring into the 
house), in went a tarp on the floor, and off my son and I went.

The three of us (me, my son and the parts mgr) loaded the tranny (complete 
with swing axles) into the EV...and off we went. 

Nothing like having a passenger hauler/furniture mover/pickup/camper all in 
one vehicle!
