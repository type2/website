Subject: Re: Timing lights

&gt;I was looking at timing lights last night and didn't know which one I
&gt;wanted.  There are inductive type and advance type.  The former is
&gt;about $20 cheaper.  Will it work for my bus?  I was at Sears.  Does
&gt;anybody want to recommend a particular Sears model?  That said, I
&gt;probably will not be able to afford one right now unless something big
&gt;happens.  More of a chance in a couple of more weeks.  So, any
&gt;suggestions on where to static time my stock 1600dp with 009, Weber
&gt;progressive, single QP.  I am at about 1,200 feet.  Finally, where do

        Here's the deal: I've got a '70 Transporter W/1600 dual port, 009 &amp;
stock carb. I use a test light to time it, procedure illustrated in Muir.
Many scoff at this method of timing. Twice I have taken it to a local shop
after timing by test light. They pull out the
super-expensive-digital-advancing-snap- on-strobe, and say I got it within
1-2 deg. of right on. I can live with those numbers. My test light cost me
$.99 at the local &quot;under a dollar&quot; store. Your experinces may differ.

Peace,
