Didn't mean to turn this into an attack on General Motors. I grew up with 
GM in my life (and within a GM family) .... now that I re-read that, it 
comes across like &quot;I know people who work at GM. Some of my best friends 
have the product&quot; ;).

GM could be cited for many instances of &quot;caring for the consumer&quot;:

	The Side-mounted gas tank
	The Corvair
	etc., etc.

Could just as easily cite Ford:

	The Pinto
	The faulty wiring on pickups

Could cite the tobacco industry

	Cigarettes don't contain nicotine
	Cigarettes only contain a minimal/measured amount of nicotine
	Nicotine is not addictive
	etc., etc.

Could cite other industries, etc. etc.

	Anyone remember Scrontium-90, the Swine Flu or when ice cream
	really was ice cream?

In each instance, the producer &quot;sold a product buyers wanted at a price 
they wanted to pay, meeting all applicable regulations, in force.&quot;

Is it a pity or something else that the consumer was too stupid to know how 
something was constructed or the conditions for which that product may not 
be &quot;good for them&quot; or &quot;unsafe&quot;?

Those stupid consumers faithfully and in good faith created and sustained a 
demand for the product based, to some degree on the orchestrated demand for 
the product.

When an entity who is not in the &quot;club&quot; began to compete, slogans such as 
&quot;Buy American&quot; and &quot;We can make it better here at home&quot; were created and 
orchestrated by the &quot;Club&quot; members. Unaware consumers were 'forced' or 
'duped' into cooperation by scare tactics such as, &quot;your jobs are being 
wiped out by the off-shore competition. You MUST do something to prevent 
this&quot;.

In most instances, the &quot;Club&quot; members failed to tell the public that major 
investments in the off-shore entity (ies) had already been made by members 
of the &quot;Club&quot;.
