That's right, folks! Had to go on a business trip to Canada last week,
including a weekend in Toronto. So I hooked up with the &quot;local
Vanagon_at_lenti chapter,&quot; Michael Heron and Sstones for the now traditional
pizza and beer. What can I say, it was simply great to be able to meet
unknown friends!

Thanks guys!
