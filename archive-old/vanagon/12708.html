Well... I'm rather hoping to go.  But I don't have a spiked collar, and 
last time I loaned out my hand-cuffs they didn't get returned.  Oh, and 
what's a feather boa, and am I missing out?  Why do I have a feeling that 
there's a Rocky Horror Picture Show reference in there?

I really feel obliged to have some VW content... 

For the campout at Red Rock Lobster I'd like to bring some bread, 
home-made, fat-free, refried beans, salsa, and rice.  Oh, and lot's of 
wine... and I'm in the red wine mood.  I hope Martha will be willing to 
make some more of that mulled wine stuff.
