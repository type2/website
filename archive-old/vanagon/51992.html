Subject: Re: Where can I rent a CO meter in East Bay (CA)

When I was a kid in So.Cal. there *were* some shops around that catered
to the do-it-yourselfer in somewhat this fashion.

They would rent bay space and tools to folks wanting to fix their own
cars.

As far as I know, these shops are no longer in existence; I think insurance
costs did them in.  And that could also put the kabosh on this idea.

&gt; Here's a idea for some CALIFORNIA VW clubs or the business inclined.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The Get A Sniff Smog Shop&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Set up a garage with a few bays, with gas analyzers. The do-it-yourselfer
&gt; then either pays a fee to get a &quot;quick&quot; sniff (to asses where his/her car
&gt; is with respect to exhuast emission, or rents the bay (by the hour, day)
&gt; to &quot;get a sniff&quot; and make real-time adjustments to his/her vehicle. If you
&gt; really want to get elaborate, you can also have a certified SMOG
&gt; technician on hand to do the &quot;real&quot; inspection when the do-it-yourselfer
&gt; has finished fine-tuning his vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; As for &quot;operating&quot; the gas analyzers, if you are competent enough to make
&gt; your own car repairs then surely you can operate a gas analyzer ...
&gt; &quot;idiot&quot; keys and all.
&gt; 
&gt; Any takers ?
