Subject: Re: fun [f]

&gt;Hi,
&gt;   I just had a thought:  Since there has been some discussion of
&gt;the types of things that are posted to this list, maybe we could insert
&gt;a small token into the header for posts that are non-VW related so those
&gt;people that are getting overwhelmed by mail could sort through it a little
&gt;easier.  I was thinking we could put [f] at the end of the topic to
&gt;identify the post as for &quot;fun&quot;.  What do you all think?  I for one read
&gt;all posts to this list - I wouldn't miss them!  I just thought that this
&gt;might be something that would make a few more people happy.  Or maybe it's
&gt;just these painkillers going to my head...

I second the [f], especially when one is making a non-serious comment to an 
initially serious thread!
