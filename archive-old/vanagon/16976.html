&gt;Subject: 1971 original windshield wiper length 
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know what length these are?  Mine have been replaced with some 
&gt;which are too long.  They measure 16&quot;.


I just replaced the wipers on my '71 Transporter this morning. The old
ones (they weren't original) were 16&quot; long, and the new ones are the same.
Both fit perfectly!

Maybe someone once replaced your wiper *arms* with too-long ones? maybe
from a later year bus??

Actually, I guess I don't know how long the original blades were in 1971.
But 16&quot; ones seem fine now, on mine. They don't hit the rubber trim at the 
top, etc.

Now if I just had about 10 degrees more rotation of the arms when running...
