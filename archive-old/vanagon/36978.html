Subject: Re: Restoration references

The need for restoration references (books, manuals, etc.) prompted me to
ask the kind people of the list. The project will involve a 1956 Bus. Are
there books that are Bus specific? Help and comments are appreciated. TIA

there are a number of books that will help you with the mechanicals.   There
are places that sells vintage vw parts, and the people there can be helpful.
 Are you doing it stock with a splitcase trans and a 36hp motor?  That is
harder to find,  If the trans isnt good, it can be hard to find someone to
rebuild a splitcase.  (but that feeling, that sound!  Just gotta love it)

Are you doing a stock restoration?  Three seats in the bus type of deal?
 Cloth headliner.   Correct voltage regulator and bumpers? That is much
harder to find info on.  There are no books being published that i know
about.     I have seen one for bugs, detailing colours, style of ashtray,
mirrors, etc for model and year from the earlist bugs, but zilch for buses.
   :(
