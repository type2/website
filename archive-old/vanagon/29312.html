Subject: JC Whitney weather stripping and gaskets?

HI,

I finally broke down and bought my first JC Whitney catalog in 10 
 years, hasn't changed much. I wonder what sort of buying staff they 
 employ to source all this stuff, I question how strict the criteria is 
 to make into the catalog. My question is- how is the quality of there 
 body gaskets and rubber stuff? Is it on the same level as WCM or RMMW? 
 I am doing a complete strip down and repaint on my 78 and would like 
 to replace all of the rubber when I reassemble the little guy.

Thanks 
Clay
