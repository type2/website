Subject: Snow Traction Devices?

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,
     
       Any suggestions for snow traction devices for an '85 Westy.  How 
     about chains vs. cables.  Are there some brands/types that are easier 
     to put on than others?  
       I have a set of cables for my other car that I dread to put on 
     because you have to reach behind the wheel and thread a nylon web 
     through a buckle to secure them.  This is not easy when your hands are 
     cold &amp; numb and you can't see what your doing because the wheel is 
     blocking your sight.
     
     Thanks In Advance,
     
     Vince.
