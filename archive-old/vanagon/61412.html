Subject: Re: Dometic Fridge woes

Well I have the same problem, and unfortunately do also have the rumble of
happy gas at work.   Maybe it's not enought rumble, so I'm going to  pull
out the orifice and clean it.

&gt;Saw your letter on the list... I'm having the same problem, i.e.; good AC, DC
&gt;operaton, and it does light on gas, but doesn't cool.  After numerous
&gt;discussions with the Dometic service techs in Indiana, and having cleaned
&gt;every orifice, and spot on the unit,  I'm sure it's the 2 stage thermostat.
&gt; It operates on low flame only, and doesn't kick up to high flame on max
&gt;cool.  This is symptomatic of a bad thermo..  On high flame operation, you
&gt;should hear a pretty good rumble in the vent plate if you get ;your ear
&gt;somewhat close.  My other units all have this type of operation.  I've
&gt;ordered a thermostat $126.00 from a local RV repair and parts service that
&gt;Dometic recommended, so I should be operating by next week.   If it's not the
&gt;thermostat, I'll post it to list, but I'm pretty certain (126.00 worth) on
&gt;this one... Hope you find it's the same type problem, because this is cheap
&gt;fix versus RV repair shop bill, or new fridge!..
