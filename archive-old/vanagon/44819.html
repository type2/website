&gt;&gt;  But there's still hope. A gentleman named Tommy Sandham has
&gt;&gt;  written a book titled 'Panel Craft', by Willow Publishing,
&gt;&gt;  Barecroft Common, Magor, Newport, Gwent, NP6 3EB. (Apparently,
&gt;&gt;  that is what passes for a street address in England. Good luck.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The British Library Cataloguing in Publication Data spif reads:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Sandham, Tommy Panel Craft; Featuring Ford Cortina MK.1 bodyshell
&gt;&gt;  restoration. 1. Automobiles -- Conservation and restoration --
&gt;&gt;  Amateur manuals
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I Title 629.28'722 TL152.2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  ISBN 0-9512523-0-5
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;If anyone has been looking for this book, I found it through Classic
&gt;Motorbooks 800/826-6600. It's $31.95.

Okay, I jumped the gun a bit. I was actually looking in Classic's Spring
1996 Catalog assuming that since it was there, that they would have it.

When I *actually* called to order it turns out it was out of print. They
did, however, turn me on to &quot;Esquire Auto Books&quot; 612/433-5744 which also
did not have the book. Esquire referred me to another out of print book
reseller by the name of Draggage(sp?) also in MN 800/328-8484 which *did*
have two copies in stock.

Call quick!
