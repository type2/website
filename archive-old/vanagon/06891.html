Joachim writes (in Joel's defense):

&gt;I always thought Ph.D. stands for Doctor of Philosophy (in latin, of
&gt;course) and J.D. stands for Juris Doctor ...

Yes that is true, and it is implied that there are degrees behind those
doctorates...however in certain places, Alahbamah for instance I am
told that certain grouping of letters have more than one meaning and
perhaps down there in Alahbamah one may have to add the word &quot;degree&quot;
after those letter designations. I'm talking about the following:

Term			Alahbamah Definition
PhD			Post Hole Digger
BS			Bull Shit
MBA			Master Baiter Association (a fishing club)
JD			Jewish Doctor
BA			Big Ass (as in Big Ass truck...)

Yours truly in Yankee Corectness and Educashun...
