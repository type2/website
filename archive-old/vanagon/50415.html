Subject: Re: Looking at 87 Vanagon: Feedback Please

&gt; the engine, if it is the Canadian VW rebuild, I have heard numerous 
&gt; probs concerning these rebuilds from VW Canada. The shop wants $5400 and 
I can't comment on the tranny, but my '88 Westy had a full Cdn 
factory rebuild, engine and transmission, at 166K due to leaking 
heads and blown gears in the tranny (previous owner, but I have all 
receipts). It is now at 336K kms with no signs of coolant leaks 
whatsoever, and engine runs well. Compression is a bit low but even 
at around 130, but I attribute this to the PO leaving it a bit long 
between oil changes (12,000km), and often using cheap 10w30 oil. It 
burns little oil - about 3/4 of litre every 6000km when I now change 
the oil, using Mobil 1 15w50. (which helped noisy lifters a lot, 
btw).

In case you don't have papers proving the new engine, mine has 
stickers on the heads and case stating VW Canada rebuild.
