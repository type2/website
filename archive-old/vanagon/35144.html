Subject: Responses to supplier's/Visa caution note

To all who responded to my plaintive cry re: apparently unscrupulous
behavior of certain parts suppliers: thanks. I appreciate your support, and
some of you also told horror stories about John's Car Corner, RTE 5,
Westminster, VT. 05158.  (802) 722-3180. To those who asked that I name
names: there you are. Perhaps the power of the 'Net will encourage fair
business practices and reduce rampant greed. Hope springs eternal, and all
that...
