&gt;&gt;idea of one carb instead of two headaches.  Is the difference in

&gt; But, man, when they're right, you would laugh at fuel injection.  These
&gt;things are the smoothest things out there.  And suprisingly good fuel mileage
&gt;as well.  They have power that fuel injection can't touch.

&gt;I say keep 'em and treat 'em right.  Well, you asked me.

I agree.  Many people have reported problems with carb icing (with the
single Weber carb) on this list.  My dual carbs work great - I'm satisfied
with them.  They are simple and efficient.  I doubt I will ever trade them
for a single carb, but I may swap them for fuel injection someday.
