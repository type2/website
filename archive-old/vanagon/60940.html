Subject: Re: alternator brushes

&gt;So, where's the best/cheapest place to find the brushes? 

You can get replacement brushes at the dealer and they are pretty cheap,
only a few bucks as I recall. You'll need a soldering iron to install
them. By the way, I was able to replace the brushes on my 87's
alternator without removing it (I don't have A/C).
