Subject: Death by Prune ?

Well, I haven't really been involved in the whole prune deal, but I couldn't 
help but noticing that yesterday the guy who invented the prune pitter died. 
Like most prune eaters, he must have known that it was his time to go.... :b

(Please observe a moment of silence now)

Unconfirmed reports state that he was dressed in flannel 'jamas and laid to rest
in an original, unrestored '57 Westy.

-Erik.
