Subject: battery isolators


Reading up on the issue over the weekend (FAQs and backfiles), I wonder 
whether anybody has given the J.C. Whitney battery isolators a try? Do 
they work o.k. on newer vanagons?

Does anybody know whether isolators actually connect both batteries when 
starting (this seems to be one of the problems of relays and may not be 
good for your alternator)?

TIA
