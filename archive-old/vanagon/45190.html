So Joel sez:

&gt;now, down in South Africa (so how come places &quot;below&quot; the equator are always
&gt;&quot;down&quot;??? what if the world is upside-down to begin with??), they sell the

Yes. I object. Why do everybody always look _down_ on South Africa? We want
people to look _up_ at us for a change. We're people too. We've also got
hearts, we've also got emotions. :-)))))))))))

&gt;buses as 10-seaters!! cause they put some &quot;seats&quot; over the engine. these
&gt;little &quot;jump seats&quot; face backwards, and the occupants can't get out by them-
&gt;selves (someone has to open the rear hatch from the outside) ... unless they
&gt;scamper over the 3rd seat. :)

Lessee, (BTW I _hate_ doing ascii art :-)

                               /   arch

That's a 10 seater, if I recall right.
The seat for #3 is a fold up arrangement. #6,7,8 sit on top of the engine
with their legs following the engine compartment contour, if you can
understand what I'm trying to say. Being tall, I prefer seat #8 :-)

And there's some funny arrangement (I havn't been in one of these for a
while) where the rear seats fold forward to make a full bed, but _then_
you have to get in at the back.

If anyone would like more info, or disagrees, I'll run outside &amp; go find one,
look through the window, will report back if I don't get arrested :-)
