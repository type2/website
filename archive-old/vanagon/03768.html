Subject: RE: Brazilian buses



Clipped from Lee:
     Has anyone ever seen/owned a Brazilian Bus. The Delux Microsbus
     split-screen body with the bubble front window and doors.

     Lee.

I've seen photos, and man do they look weird!  I'm not too sure where they fit
the radiator in the nose, but the thing has a big grille extending off of it's
nose.

Last I heard the engine was an 1800cc carburated Golf engine (That's right,
H20-pumping beastie!)

Technically, the body is a late-model, because of its overall dimensions.
It does use louvers in the rear sides, and split-style square rearside windows.
It uses late model taillights, with a twist- no amber turn sugnal.  They
went back to the 3-wire system.  As far as I know, it's available only with
the 091 4speed tranny.  This information is all rather dated,
so if anyone knows different, lemme know.

Harris
