&gt;Oregon is also the state that gave us the Oregon Citizen's Alliance, that
&gt;neo-nazi group that is (like a virus) attempting to infect neighboring
&gt;states.  But at least it gives Lon Mabon's family a job and keeps the whole

I drove to portland and back (from San Diego) a few months ago.
Was surprised by the can't-pump-your-own-gas thing (??? ...we can
in EPA-blighted California), but ran into no obnoxious or rude persons
with or without third brake lights below their hairlines. The people I
encountered, seemed pretty nice. Maybe you got unlucky, Bob?

P.S. I have heard of bumper stickers saying &quot;Don't Californicate our State&quot;.
But didn't see any when I went there. I didn't litter, BTW.
