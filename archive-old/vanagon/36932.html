&gt; A couple days ago I took my new vanagon ('87 Syncro) for it's emissions
&gt;test.  I felt kinda sketchy, because (for the first time since I bought it
&gt;a few months ago) I had some greyish smoke comming outta the exhaust and it
&gt;didn't smell too good.
&gt; Four minutes and twenty dollars later, I was told thatI failed, having too
&gt;high an HC level.  Being a relatively new car and in very good condition, I
&gt;was wondering if there was any minor adjustment I could do (or tricks...my
&gt;frined tells me he puts water in his truck's carb before the test, so that
&gt;&quot;steam&quot; comes out of the exhaust for awhile).  I don't have the time, or
&gt;especially the money, so any help would be greatly appreciated. BTW, I'm in
&gt;CT.
&gt; Also, how difficult (time and tools) is it to replace a boot on the cv
&gt;joint?  Mine is cracked.
&gt;Thanks!

Was the CO in range?  If yes, you have what is called alean misfire.  Replace
the plugs, make sure cap, rotor, and wires are good.  After failuer, did they
perform a precondition warm-up and retry?  In NY, that is proceduere.
Basically, the engine is run at 2500 rpm for 3 minutes.  This &quot;lights up the
Catalytic converter.  This usually resolves the HC problem on Vanagons.  Try
driving a few miles and havein emissions checked with engine hot from
driving.  Makes a big difference versus warming engine by idling.
