&gt;While driving home from Santa Clara to Sacramento last weekend (Saturday
&gt;afternoon) I passed a '80 or '81 eggnog/primered Vanagon that had a sticker
&gt;in the window that said &quot;Eat More Possum&quot;.
&gt;Thought it might be one of Joel's remote ken folk.  :)

lemme see now ... 81 light beige ... hmmm. thass probly cousin Zeke. he
lives out in that area.  some of the younger cousins refer to him as &quot;Zeke
the Freak&quot; cause he looks like one of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.
personally, i think he looks more like their cat.

anyway, Zeke was always the adverturous one ... always trying new things ...
girls, drugs, frogs, sky-diving, going to Californy. he always said that
California was a wonderful place to write home about ... iffen he ever learned
how to write.

but he's in the Big Time now ... runs an automated Sheep &amp; Cattle Dip, out
back of the 7-11, up near Placerville.  and he recycles the used dip as
furniture stain.
