&gt;Hi Everyone.  Well, like someone else on the list, I received my VW
&gt;World newsletter (first time I received such a thing after owning new
&gt;VW's since 1988).  The package included Free Internet Access with a
&gt;disk that is setup to use Spry Mosaic/Compuserve.  Interesting
&gt;marketing.  It is setup to automatically link to the VW homepage
&gt;(www.vw_dot_com).  I'm not going to use this product as I have my own
&gt;provider, but sounds like VW is finally getting into some good (?)
&gt;marketing.

The packet containing the disk says &quot;Free Internet access!&quot;.  This was too good
to be true so I installed it.  Turned out that you had to have your credit card
ready for a charge of some $10 a month for seven hours of time.  

So, what's with the &quot;Free&quot; bit?
