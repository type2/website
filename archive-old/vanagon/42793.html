Subject: Sainthood for Ben Pon (f)

Michael Heron, Clara and myself have been kidding about the concept of
&quot;praying to St. Pon.&quot;  I first mentioned the notion in my post about the
dropped seat in the '83 Westy.  Mr. Heron replied in a tongue-in-cheek
private post about saying the prayer to St. Pon for ten days and then
publishing &quot;thanks to St. Pon for prayers answered.&quot; in the local newspaper.
&quot;Guarranteed not to fail!!&quot; It cracked me up.
Not to make fun of anyone's religious beliefs, by any means,  but it
reminded me of  how alot of our (my) vehicles are held together on faith,
duct tape and bondo. We all have our &quot;Muirisms&quot;, mantras, Zen,  Kharma
vibes, 10mm meditations, and  &quot;VW saints.&quot; More often than not removing the
rear axle nut turns into a religious experience.
When it all shakes out and the kidding is over we know the &quot;real deal&quot;
within our own beliefs.
Keep the faith what ever it is for you.
