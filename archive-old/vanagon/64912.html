Subject:      EV timing belt

Has anyone on the list ever changed a timing belt on an EV?  I have a '93 MV
that is up to 85,000 miles, and after the latest info regarding timing belts
and mileage...I'm feeling preventative.  I looked through the old paperwork
from the previous owner - we bought the van last November - and he never
changed the belt tho he did the waterpump at about 40,000.  Having just gone
through a disasterous experience with replacing the clutch.  WARNING!  Don't
keep driving if the clutch is going!  The bearings were all jammed up into
the transmission and it was hell trying to separate the transmission from the
engine shaft.  It took 3 weeks and lots of breaks to smash rocks in
frustration, for our mechanic to get the job done.

That said - I'm hoping it's infinitely easier to change the timing belt.  Not
having a manual, is it something my husband could figure out just be going in
there?  Nothing hidden?  No secret tricks?  I'd appreciate hearing form
anyone out there who's attempted this before and had success (or failure
too).  Thanks again.
