Subject: Re: Driving: Right vs. Privilege

Hello Chris,
	First I'd like to thank you for posting my p-mail to you to not one but
two lists! I wrote to you PRIVATELY as my post had nothing to do with a vw
bus. This post I'm replying to has even less vw content. But it does have
some towards the end!
	I would be more than willing to talk about the Constitution of our great
nation and the ability of the govt to allow you to travel, as long as you
don't walk, drive, fly or sail, without govt issued documents. I'm more
than willing to talk about &quot;Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, of
course I wouldn't credit that quote to the Constitution. I'd be willing to
do this all off the list. I would love to talk about responsibilities
rather than rights and heck while we are at it we can talk about how the
Constitution was meant to limit the govt power over you and I! Let's do it
off this list.
	Say Chris, do you want to buy an '86 Syncro GL? Only 128k, silver and
blue...it does have a little seam rust but I have changed the exhaust
system and the dealer did the head &amp; gas tank recall. Both front &amp; back
heaters &amp; the locking diff work, as a plus nothing leaks. It runs really
nice and only $4000/Offer! You could come out to Michigan and check it out. 
	Now this post does have some VW content!!!

	'86 Syncro GL (for sale)

ps: I didn't quote your post as I'm sure that folks on both vw lists had a
chance to see it.
