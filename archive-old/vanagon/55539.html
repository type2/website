&gt;&gt;One is West Marine (actually I was referred to it by someone on the list)
&gt;&gt;&gt;free cat. at 1-800-538-0775, which has tons of marine stuff that can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;applicable to campers and busses with furnishings (they have sink stuff,
&gt;&gt;&gt;aux. batt. hookups, 12v fans, fridges, etc.-house/cabinboat stuff).  It is
&gt;&gt;a &gt;nice big catalog with long discriptions and COLOR pics. 
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

West Marine has a nice web site at ---
