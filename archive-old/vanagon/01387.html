Biggest Vanagon conversion I know of has a 3.6 liter Buick V8.  This was a
nightmare for a VERY well-equipped shop.  For example, they had to fabricate
a new distributor, since the stock distributor ends up right where the rear
door latch is.  But now that the nightmare is over and the thing runs, the
owner/driver says &quot;Bill,&quot; he pauses, &quot;there are no hills.&quot;

Wish we could all afford to find, and solve, such problems.
