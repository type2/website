Well, the &quot;'54 Deluxe Progress Report Series&quot; starts!

Last night, I hooked up a charger to the battery terminals (no battery)
and turned the ignition switch on.  I got idiot lights!  Yahoo!  
Whats kinda cool is they are on the side of the speedo.  THere's 2 sets of
lights, the engine idiot lights are on the right, and I don't know whats
on the left.  The right switch is the headlight switch.  I'd disconnected
the dimmer, so all I have are parking lights.

Tonight and tomorrow, I'm going to be putting some shelving and a workbench
in the garage, which will help when it comes time to disassemble the
beast.
