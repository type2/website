Subject: Re: '66 bus mirrors

     ray,
     
     hmm, sounds like you've got big mirror problems.
     
     Well my '64 came with two small rounded rectangular mirrors which are 
     the same size at the top and bottom - they are the original ones. My 
     mates (Danny) came with two little round ones. Since I got mine I 
     fitted West-Coast-Metric 'Elephant ears', now I wasn't very happy with 
     them coz the arms were painted black, and the screws which hold the 
     mirror to the swivel clamp went rusty in a week! There's a place over 
     here called KDF Enterprises that do a either genuine EE's or very goos 
     fakes. I'll dig out there number - oops I think I was supposed to do 
     this for someone else as well (Michael.Heron?).
     
     Anyway because my door hinges were worn out I made new arms for my EE 
     mirrors out of stainless steel - I also made them 1inch longer and 
     bent them further out so I could see more, I then replaced the clamp 
     screws with SS ones as well.
     
     Lee.
     
     ps, my SO parents are on holiday in Florida at this moment.
