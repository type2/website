Subject: Re: Westy tent - setting up

&gt;
&gt;The only problem I had was attaching the tent to the raingutter.  This was 
&gt;QUITE a chore.  Was I doing it wrong?  I attached after setting up tent - 
&gt;should I have attached this first?  Is there a trick to this or is it always 
&gt;a bear?  Maybe the rubber strip was just stiff from not using it.  Anyway, 
&gt;any advise appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;
You will get strong wrists doing this, just force the vinyl strip on really 
tightly, lots of twisting and pushing and pounding. The tent is really for a 
pre-vanagon, so the vanagon is an inch or two higher and makes for a tighter 
fit. Also, do you have the plasric trim over the edge of your raingutters? 
Taking it off will help, but isn't really neccessary. Put the vinyl strip  
on before you peg/tighten down the rest of the tent back.
         One important note... the tent poles are colour coded with strips 
of red and green tape. The cross pieces must match, ie. two green taped 
cornerd plus green centre T piece. I can't remember whether red or green 
goes against the van. It makes a BIG difference since the tent/frame is 
taller on the van side. If the upright poles want fight you for where they 
touch the ground, then the frame is likely backwards. Don't bend the poles 
lots, this will crack the corner pieces.  Great tent, good way to make sure 
your campsite isn't stolen when you motor off for the day.   tim s.
