So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I am now looking for an engine.  Anyone got a long block 1600 DP? for 
&gt; sale?
&gt; It turns out that my motor with brand new heads ate a valve on #2.  I have 
&gt; no idea why this happened with 1042 miles on it.  I am however, bummed.  The 
&gt; only reason I can think this would happen at so few miles is that I got a 
&gt; defective head.  There is absolutely no way the valve was tight on #2 
&gt; exaust, I kept a log of what the clearance was at every adjustment.  
&gt; miles  old clearance
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt; 93      .006
&gt; 172     .010
&gt; 284     .009
&gt; 548     found out that adjustment screws were getting worn
&gt; 600     replaced screws and set all to .007
&gt; 907     loose again- screws are wearing out _again_

Well Chris after getting the timing right and futzing with the valves, this
must have been a really frustrating blow to say the least.  I wonder if
the heads needed to be retorqued.  You were pretty diligent about checking
the valves so I would suspect that something was causing the engine to
shake the valves out in a very short time.  I would suggest going to a
reputable machine shop and buying a complete engine there.

I'm sorry about the outcome of this engine Chris.  Hope the next one
turns out better.
