When I bought my '84 Vanagon three years ago it was in precisely the same
condition that you now find yours in.  I was told by two shops that the
only solution was new heads, and the price was in about the range both of
you have described, or a bit more.  I asked if the heads could be milled,
and was told that no one ever did that.  I had one of the shops pull the
heads and send them off to a machine shop here in Austin that had never
done Vanagon heads, and haven't had a lick of trouble since (crosses
fingers).  It also seems to have a bit more power, while wanting higher
octane fuel than it's supposed to need - I suppose because of the
slightly higher compression.  It still wasn't cheap, but I saved
something like $500 in total, if I remember correctly.
