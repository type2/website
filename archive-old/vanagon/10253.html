So Jerry Huff says:
&gt; 
&gt; Due to the absorbant characteristics of the fiber floorboard used in the 
&gt; Vanagon I still smell coolant from the rear heater and I did everything
&gt; I could to clean up the mess, i.e. removed carpet and floorboard, rinsed,
&gt; shampooed and dried in the sun for several days.
&gt; 

Funny, after I fixed mine, the smell went away rather quickly.  I put down
a couple of towels under my usual junk after I wiped it up a bit.  Haven't
smelled it at all after about a week after the fix.
