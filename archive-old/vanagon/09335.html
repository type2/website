Subject: Re: ADVICE NEEDED.

i'd just quickly add my 2 cents wortj- I think Todd was offering you good
advice re: the possible purchase of the 71'it is best to know what you are
getting into. one thing with the price- often times previous owners will
set the price of the vehicle based on how much money they have invested in
it (i.e. how much the local gagrage butthead just ripped them off for) Just
because someone got hosed on putting a lot of $$ into a car, doesn't mean
that the car is worth that.
