Subject: Anyone need '53? parts
Date: Fri, 2 Jun 95 11:46:52 EDT

The local bug guy just took in an ancient bus, I'm guessing
a '53, it is/was a panel (now has a big round window in the
side) nothing inside it, barndoor hatch gone, engine long
gone, GAS TANK AND CAP still hanging there in the engine
compartment and look quite OK for their age, nothing inside
the rear of the bus, front seat frames present, 3-spoke banjo
style steering wheel present (black) and in OK condition,
gauge panel gone, most knobs gone from that funny early style
dash, steering box and column still attached to that old
wheel, front axle present, all 4 16&quot; wheels present, there
is a tranny hanging in it, as to it's origionality who knows?
Whole thing is mucho rough and probably not near rebuildable
at any cost, I didn't check to see if any lights/signals were
present, didn't think about it, if anyone has any needs, mail
me with specifics and I'll go check it out.
