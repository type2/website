&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Well the tent I Bought from a guy who advertised in Limbo Newsletter arrived
&gt;today and looks to be in really good shape.  I probably paid a bit to
&gt;much($325 plus shipping) but they are so hard to find and I really wanted
&gt;one.  It appears to be complete, but has no instructions.  I can tell that
&gt;after the first time it will probably be fairly easy to put together, but I
&gt;want to make sure that I set it up correctly.
&gt;
&gt;It is the orange &amp; Blue one with the Blue and Red stiping on the door
&gt;awning.  Just like the one in the picture David Put up on his web page a
&gt;week ago.  
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have instructions, a manual or something that comes with the
&gt;tent?  Is iT small, can it be faxed?  I will be happy to pay for postage and
&gt;copying if necessary.  
&gt;
&gt;My fax number is 310-478-1327
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help!
&gt;
&gt;I hope someone out there has this!!

Oh you don't really want that tent do you?!  Look at all the aggravation
it's causing you already.  I'd be happy to make your life easier by taking
it off your hands for $326+shipping.

Ya, I know...I'm such a saint.

Of course I have to talk ICBC out of writing off Fritz first.
