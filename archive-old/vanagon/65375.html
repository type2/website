Volks,
Along these lines, some smart PO of my 82 Diesel Westy got it titled
here in Texas as a motorhome. My title reads MH and I pay considerably
less registration and insurance as well. May want to consider seeing
what is required to title your Westy's as motorhomes. Apparently the
infrequent usage of MH's give a tremendous break in insurance and
registration, at least here in Texas.
