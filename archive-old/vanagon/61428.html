If replacing all 4, consider 215/70's.  I just installed Goodyear Wrangler 
Aqua-Treads on my camper and they work very well.  They can also be inflated 
to 44psi which makes them ideal for this application.  You may also consider 
the Dunlop Rover Sport GTX.  HR speed rating and an aqua channel center tread 
to resist hydro planing.

Regular load 205/70R14 might be OK for your bus.  Check to see how the load 
capacity of your 
tires compare to 185R14 load range C tires (you find the maximum load rating 
in lbs. stamped 
on the sidewall of your tires).  You might find that they are comparable since 
a 205/70R14 
is larger than a 185R14.

Given comparable tire designs ...
  * 205 tires will give you better dry handling and traction, a better ride
    and will have better tread wear.
  * 185 tires will typically provide better snow traction, will resist
    hydroplaning better, and give you slightly better gas mileage
    (probably not measurable).

&gt;Hey all-
&gt;With all the tire talk recently, I decided to check the tires more closely on
&gt;my 86 Syncro GL, that I've had for about 6 months. When I bought the Syncro I
&gt;was pleased that it had 4 of the same tires, in great condition, all with
&gt;even wear. When I checked the tires again after learning a bit more recently,
&gt;I was sorely dissapointed. Seems I have the wrong tires-I have Yokohama GS4's
&gt;(205/70R14), which I think are regular passenger tires. They are specified at
&gt;93S load rating which I guess is high for passenger tires, but not a C rating
&gt;and not reinforced.
&gt;So, I'm going to buy 5 new tires-probably the Yokoham Y356's at my local
&gt;Sears Auto Center. (maybe I can get them for free?!) I have some questions
&gt;for those who have been through this:
&gt;1) The specs on the door jam call for 185's or 205's-the original tires I
&gt;think were 185's. Does going skinnier have any disadvatages? Less grip,
&gt;stability or handling? Are they better in snow, being thin? What do you all
&gt;prefer?
&gt;2) I may be able to get the Yoko Y370g's, but some people tell me they are
&gt;being discontinued or that the 356's are replacing them. Any clues? I'd like
&gt;to get something I will be able to purchase again in the future, if need be.
&gt;Which do people prefer-the 370's at a C rating or the 356's at a D rating
&gt;which would be a rougher ride, I think?
&gt;3) Most of my driving is paved roads, so Im going for the Highway tread-any
&gt;other suggested tires that are in the Yokohama price range-about $69-$79 per
&gt;at Sears?
&gt;Thanks all.
