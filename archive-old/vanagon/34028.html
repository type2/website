Subject: re:'74 Westy - strange sound, rear wheel?

3 words:

Constant Velocity Joint

It is a simple repair, yesterday I did 2 in 90 Minutes.  Muir has a good
explanation, Haynes, and Bentley as well.  Get a boot kit as well, for each
joint.  It is easy to determine from which side it is coming from if you or
someone you trust rides in the back, and listens to the clunking.  Sometimes
it you or the other person is really good you can even tell if it is inner
or outer(I'm assuming IRS rearend, transaxle would only be 2 CV's)  If you
decide to do it yourself, then you will need both a 6mm allen wrench, and
the 12 point wrench(can't remember size, but Flaps can help), circlip pliers
(I still haven't figured out the 2 screwdriver method for removing the
circlips) a torque wrench (24 ft/lbs), and lots of rags as this is a messy
job.  With the CV joints, and CV Boot Kits everything should be included.
Grease, boot, 6 new bolts, new circlip, washer for between the CV and the
lip on the axle. Also do not forget a pair of vise grips, after 100,000 miles
average life span on CV's) those bolts do not want to let go all of the time.
Chances are if one is going, the others are nearing the end of their life span
as well. Just be thankful this is not on a Honda ($600+ parts and labor) 8-0.
Parts should run about $100 max for each one(boot kit and joint).
Cheers,

David

I'm throwing this out to the list 'cause I don't know where to go with it,
and Muir doesn't appear to address this particular situation.

Last night jumped into the van to head home - there is a loud, consistent
&quot;clunk&quot; from the left rear of the van.  Seems to be related to the speed of
rotation of the wheel, ie: I speed up, the click/clunk speeds up. On quick
inspection nothing seems amiss, but as it's storming out there (and I have no
dry work space), I didn't really get under there for an up-close.  Before I
put on the rain gear and go wallowing, can anyone suggest where to start?
 What can I provide to aid diagnosis? I really don't want to drive it 'till I
have a clue what this noise may be!
