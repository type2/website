Subject: 84 and earlier Westy Panel Clips

I need 6 of the little round white or ivory clips that hold on the sliding
door or rear hatch door vinyl covered wood panels on that were used in the
early 80's plain Westy campers. Wally is an 84, but this interior goes back
to the first Vanagon campers. Have ordered twice from dealer and got wrong
clip. Now says not available. Thanks.
