I must confess, that I was at one time, in the position of the recalcitrant 
son.  My parents owned a '64 bus, that had rusting paint, and an engine that 
was generating a lot of smoke.  My brother and I would hide on the floor of 
the van anytime we went by school.  At age thirteen it was difficult for me to 
appreciate the usefulness of the bus.  All I knew at that time was that the 
paint was bad, it was slow, it was loud, and it smelled bad.  Many boys of 
thirteen can't appreciate the many advantages of a vanagon, or microbus, 
unless they have been brought up with VW's around them.  
I only saw the light when I had friends with bugs, and then eventually my own 
superbeetle, that the van was the perfect utility vehicle.
My advice would be to keep the van, and buy him a bycicle.
Of course, now my parents never let me forget how difficult I was at the time.
