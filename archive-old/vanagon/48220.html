Hi joel/all,

New toy time, it's a big white box with half of the back missing. Just had
to buy it finally, first time I've bought an autobox vehicle without cursing
too. Better get some decent snow tires I guess.

Any crew/single cab owners with the factory tarp or info on it, like the
vital dimensions/colour? Factory brochure/xerox? I'd like whatever details
possible. Bentley is poor for photos.

(wonder if I can breed them?)
