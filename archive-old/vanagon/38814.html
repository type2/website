&gt;	So I heard someone talking on the VW list about one type of
&gt;spark plug giving &quot;better fuel economy&quot; (better MPG) than another type
&gt;of spark plug.  I don't understand how this possible?  Is it?  And if
&gt;it is, would someone please explain to me how that works?

well, i don't KNOW that it's possible or true, but here's what i have
experienced:
- since i put Bosch triple-prong plugs (into my 88 vanagon), my anal-retentive
  recordkeeping :) has shown my AVERAGE fuel economy (over 108,000 miles)
  rise from 19.4 mpg to 19.8 mpg (over 38,000 miles). and i have done NOTHING
  else that could possible have affected the mpg. i'm using the same brands
  of gasoline, oil, filters, etc. and that's over all seasons of the year.

- my brother, the ex-mechanic, swears by the Platinum plugs. says he gets
  better mileage with them. eh? but that's what he says.

so WHY? well, &quot;they&quot; tell me that the Platinum plugs don't &quot;round off&quot; as
quickly as the old metal/material plugs. that is, the square little tip stays
square longer. ok, well, i do remember something in physics or electricity
101 (or some other class that i slept through) about sharp edges generating
electric arcing. so that sounds like it might be true. and if they stay
sharp/square longer, then the arc/spark is like new for a longer time.

and the triple-prong plugs supposedly have 1/3 the opportunity to round off
(cause there is three times the prongs to arc/spark from). so they stay
square/sharp longer.

now ... i don't KNOW that this has anything to do with anything. but i DO
know that old worn plugs or fouled plugs WILL cause your car to run badly
AND will DEcrease your fuel economy. and the more they get worn/fouled, the
worse your fuel economy will become.

and the thing is that it is harder to &quot;prove&quot; that something made a positive
change than it is to prove that something makes a negative change. or so it
seems to me, anyway. especially if any change that is produced is very small
and noticeable only over a long time. i mean, gee whiz, i get a WHOLE 0.4 mpg
better mileage!!! :)  and those plugs cost twice as much (but it looks like
i can leave them in three times longer). well, big deal. maybe it's just the
better quality of modern plugs altogether. i mean, things HAVE changed a
little bit in 26 years of buses. ;)

so i think it might be more the case of the snake oil: that regular changes
make a lot bigger difference than any one brand. like changing the engine
oil (and filter if you have one) every 2500-3000 miles and using a good
quality name brand ... versus Slick 50.

them's my experiences and opinions, which have no guaranteed relationship to
anything in real life. :)
