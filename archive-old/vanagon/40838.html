Subject: removeing 79 van engine.

I am trying to remove the engine from a 79 van.  The right rear piece
of tin will just not clear the motor.  I have removed the alternator
pulley, I have removed the blower cage.  The problem appears to be the
heat shield that is under the main part of the tin.  Any ideas,
anybody.  What am I missing?  Thanks for any help.
