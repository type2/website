Regarding Vanagon (or newer) seats, Joel wrote:

&gt;at the very worst, you could get some later bread-loaf seats ... like from a

I politely and humbly differ :)

The front seats in my 79 are a hell of a lot more
comfortable than the stock seats in my 68--much better
support and different contour.  I really like them.
