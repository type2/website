Subject: Re: Being Cut Off

I've experienced all the gripes your mentioning about being cut off, passed,
etc, but even more exciting is when the same stuff happens when I'm on my
bike.  I was doing 30 mph down a city street today and a bus pulled into my
lane.  He must have thought I was going a lot slower.  Defensive driving
class was one of the most important classes I took in High School.  Typing
was the other!
