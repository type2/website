&gt; Maybe David's talking about 6 hours if you leave the engine in. I'm no

&gt; different animal, perhaps), retorque the heads, and reinstall the engine 
&gt; inside of four hours..and I'm kinda slow at all this cause I'm kinda 
&gt; green too. I have dropped and reinstalled the engine by myself...and I've 
&gt; retorqued the heads too, so I'm not just blowin' smoke.

Joseph,
	The original poster had an '81.  A little more difficult to drop the
engine than in your '71.  Not only does the rear cross piece not come
out, but there is no rear engine hatch either!  I agree that it would be
next to trivial in a '71 bus :)
