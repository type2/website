&gt;This morning, i was outside working on my wife's Renault5 windshield
&gt;(popped out) and thought that the vanagon needed to be started up just to
&gt;keep the battery up and to keep it lubed (it is in storage for the
&gt;winter). As per usual I put the clutch in even when the van is parked in
&gt;neutral. The clutch pedal went straight to the floor! No clutch!. The
&gt;fluid is just at the minimum line (doh!). But there is a braided line
&gt;coming off just above the min line. Normally having fluid at the min line
&gt;would be &quot;ok&quot;, but I am wondering if the braided line runs to the clutch
&gt;cylinder and if this is a lack of fluid problem. Or does cold weather
&gt;effect a clutch (ie something is &quot;stuck&quot; along the way). Any ideas,
&gt;solutions, similar experiences? TIA - DC

the cold weather can cause this ... if you have old, dirty fluid in the
clutch line. the dirt and crud gets around the seals in the master cylinder
and keeps the seals open, especially since the cold weather makes the
rubber shrink a bit.

before you get toooo bent out of shape about the cost of replacing cylinders
and such, try bleeding the clutch slave cylinder  really well. if you can
come up with a pressure bleeder, so much the better.
