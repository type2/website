Subject: Intermittant starting prob.s

Hi-
	I just returned from a *very* fun month-long, 8,400 mile trip 
around the western 1/2 of the U.S.  I'd like to post some high (and Low) 
lights of the journey soon, but first- my immediate concern.
	About 3 weeks into the trip I began to experience troubles 
starting the bus (78 Westfalia).  Usually after running awhile.  I'd turn 
the key and hear nothing.  The battery is good, so I quickly discounted 
that possibility.  The key would turn, the dummy lights would dim a bit, 
but no -vroooom-.  Between my wife and myself, compression starting was a 
quick fix (and the only fix, since Muir and others warn against jumping a 
fuel-injected vw).
	We just parked on hills when possible.  (The bus started fine 
when we remembered to do this... if we forgot, Kermit wouldn't go- when 
we did, he fired right up :-/   )
	Cold starts were fine all week- problem was present when engine 
was hot.
	Until this morning.  I went out to fire it up, and nada!  I've 
done the wire jiggles, cleaned connections, etc.
	Any ideas?  All are welcome!

	Jeff, who along with wife and Kermit met the kindest people on 
the road!
