Subject: I need opinions on '87 westy

A guy down south has an '87 westy (poptop, but no sink, fridge, or stove) 
for sale for about $4500.  It has about 100,000 miles on the original 
engine.  I don't know much about the water cooled VWs.  This one has an 
excellent body and interior and has AC.  

First, is this a reasonable price?  Second, how many more miles can I 
reasonably expect from the engine that's in there?  He says that the 
compression is good all around.

 Apparently, he 
replaced the &quot;computer&quot; in the last few months ($1000), but no major work 
has been done.  He's the second owner (for 1 year).  The first owner 
worked at a VW place and he special ordered the vanagon from Germany.  I 
know it's a wolfsburg edition, but does it sound like a weekender from 
the description?  

Any suggestions y'all might have would be appreciated.  

Thanks,
david (missing my bus)
