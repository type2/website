  So what are the collectible / desireable years? I've heard &lt;and agree with&gt;
  1971 because it was the only year that combined the simplicity and economy
  of the upright fan engine with disk brakes. Are there other years that have
  special attributes, are there years with a difficulty so problematic 
  that buyers should/would avoid them?

  BTW, I've been looking at some early '80s Vanagon Westies with a friend. 
  Some of the ones we've looked at have an air intake grill that is part of
  the metal pressing that makes up the side of the vehicle. Other ones have
  a black plastic affair with vanes that appear to divert the air down into
  the duct to the engine. Is this just cosmetic or was a change made to correct
  a problem with airflow?
