Subject: Power Window Switch

The '91 Westy I just bought has power windows, though they don't work. I
don't think that both of the motors are gone, so it's probally in the
switch. Is there a cheap alternate switch or a substitute switch available?
I fear the price from VOA.   Thanks   Kris Weber

P.S. the overpriced Syncro Westy is getting cheaper!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
