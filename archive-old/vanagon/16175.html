Subject: SW BC, PNW trip anyone?

OK, I think Martha's been the sole social co-ordinator on this list for 
too long, and the California people can't have all the fun, so here goes...

Pizza?  Camping?

I was thinking a camping trip up near Pemberton (for those of us with 
ground clearance.... Harry?), along the Duffey Lake Rd btw Pemberton and 
Lillooet, or (bringing the WA people into the game here) at,say, 
Deception Pass park on Whidbey I.?

Pizza anytime, but I was thinking of a short (2 night? 1 night even, for 
the first time?) camping trip in late may or anytime this summer.  Can't 
be too soon, as I've got to get rid of my harmonic (demonic?) noise and 
do my rear brakes before cruising off anywhere.

Ok!  Who's in?  Ideas?  Events?  Places?  Dates?  Stuff to burn?*
