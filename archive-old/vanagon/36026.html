So Martha says:
&gt; MattJ, and where was he, and where was Waldo, and so forth...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And then, Joel Walker pondered:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;has anybody heard anything from William Warburton?...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; No, that wasn't Williams Warburton.  You're thinking of the
&gt; tennis magistrate, William Wimbleton...

Naw, he's taking about Billy Warburton, bastard son of Richard
burton!  ;p

(Little did I know that I was starting a crazy thread)  ;)
