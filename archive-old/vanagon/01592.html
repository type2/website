&gt;flip the axles end for end so that the &quot;other faces&quot; of the cv joints
&gt;are taking the wear (when driving forward!).

aha! i've wondered about that for a long time!  if the outer joints (wheels)
are re-positioned at the transmission ends, it would seem to me that the
much smaller angle and up-and-down motion (of the transmission end) would
mean less wear and tear on the joint.  that is, the inner (transmission)
joints shouldn't be as worn as the outer (wheels) ones.  so swapping them
end for end (axle-wise) SOUNDS like a really good idea.  &lt;but i've been
chicken to try it on my own car. :)  &gt;

&gt;If you are just replacing one cv per axle, I think there is some merit in
&gt;placing the new joint at the end which doesn't make the sharpest (most
&gt;acute?) angle... inboard?

i would tend to disagree, simply based on the end-to-end swap theory. i
would think that the NEW joint should go where the MOST wear/angle/up-and-
down motion is: the outer (wheels) joints.  based on pure conjecture that
the new joint could withstand that much motion better than an old joint.

any theories on this?  i'm coming up on 75,000 miles on my joints (had a
knee go bad about 50,000 ago :)  and i think i'll try the end-to-end this
time and see how long this set (started out new at zero miles) will last.
