&gt;Hi

&gt;   I was wondering if anyone knew of a product that neutralizes rust that
&gt;you can use before you would, say put on a new body panel. My 78 T II has
&gt;rust behind the panels that I am replacing and I can't grind it off. I need
&gt;something that can be brushed or sprayed on.

&gt;Regards,

OSPHO is, I believe, phosphoric acid which changes ferric and ferrous
oxides to phosphates, which can then be primed and painted. Complete
neutralization, and thin enough to penetrate sandwiched panels, creases,
seams, etc. I've used it on lotsa stuff, Bimmers, Bugs, Buses and MGBees,
only problem: It WILL do serious doo-doo to finished paint if not wiped off
completely and/or neutralized with water. But it does a GREAT job on rust
of all kinds, and you can spray it on/in with yer Windex sprayer. See yer
autobody supply store.
