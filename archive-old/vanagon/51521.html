 I have a 1971 VW Bus with a brand new 1641 engine (1000 miles) and I am
 having problems getting the HC level low enough to pass Arizona's emissions.
 
 I took the bus to my mechanic (who specializes in VW's) and he told me that
 the Pertronix Ignitor that I have installed is possibly causing the problem.
 I am inclined to agree with him since as I stated above, this is a new
 engine and I have no reason to believe that anything else is causing the
 problem.  
  &gt;&gt;
The pertronix is not the problem unless it is defective or installed
incorrectly.  Check the ignition timing and make sure it is not too far
advanced.  If you are using a 009 distributer and have the timing advanced at
idle, that is probably the problem.  Set near TDC and turn up idle speed with
carb.  More air will decrease the HC. Also make sure that the engine does is
not leaking through the heads.  Compression and leak down tests.  New engine
means new, not always good.  Hate to sound pesimistic, but been there too
often.  Also make sure there are no vacuum leaks.  Especially at the manifold
to head gaskets.  A small leak ther will cuase one cylinder to runn lean.
 This lean mis-fire will make a lot of HC problems.

Hope this helps,
Dennis
