Subject: Syncro Gearbox Replacements, Prices


I was offered an '89 Syncro, pretty bad shape, but nice
undercarriage, for a price of 3,200.00 USD. But the
gearbox is blown.

Is it possible to rebuild it? A stock exchange will
cost 2,700.00 USD. The total amount will be too high
for this vehicle I guess. Is a used one available?

Lot of questions....
