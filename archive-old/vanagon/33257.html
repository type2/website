Subject: Re: VW issue Vanagon floor mats $10.00

After Jim Davis confirmed that the dealer doesn't mind shipping such an
inexpensive set, I ordered a pair of the Vanagon mats as well.  The place
would also love to get rid of a bunch of rear mats, rubber in various
colors, for Siroccos, Jettas, Rabbits, etc.

I bought the third to last set of Vanagon mats, so call 610-253-6244 quick
if you are interested.  The guy I talked to couldn't believe all the calls
he's been getting, from GA, CA, etc.
