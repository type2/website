&gt; 
&gt; Well, the so-called &quot;final&quot; diagnosis on my intermittent engine failure is
&gt; that the computer is faulty (after replacing most everything else but,
&gt; fortunately, the engine failed to start in the garage and they sound
&gt; confident that this is it). New ones cost $700 and parts place quotes
&gt; $600. Anyone know of a cheaper source or a used one?
&gt; 

I suggest you make 'Dr. Frankenstein' proud and open up the &quot;brain&quot; itself
and see if there is anything obvious amiss.  Like a cold solder joint or
obvious bad component (burned or melted).  What have you got to lose?  
Maybe it will be a, ahem, no-brainer. :]  

Those guys at the shop aren't going to look inside.  They've already
proven that, so why don't you while you still can.  Could be the difference
of $600 and $10.  

It's your money....
