&gt; I have an '87 GL Wolfs. I have not had it very long. It seems to run rough

&gt; 1200 RPM it seems to drift and surge. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is this characteristic of anything in particular?

          Yes, Throttle switch bad, or out of adjustment. There is
          a updated switch you need from the dealer. I have not
          found any of the original switchs working!
