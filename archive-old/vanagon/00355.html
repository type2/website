Subject:  Oil leak from rear - oil pump gaskets

Supercedes 87-01, July 15, 1987.

Oil seepage from the oil pump on 1.9L water-cooled engines is caused
by gaskets which are not fully compressed.

* Replace the oil pump gasket with Part Number 025 115 111 (quantity
of 2).  These gaskets are interchangeable.
