Subject: Joel - change the stats! (in 16 years or so...:)

A new wannabusser was born 12:11am on May 9!

Our new baby girl, Josephine Caitlin Wright, 8lbs 8.5oz, was born by 
cesarian after a long and courageous 25 hours of labour. (And yes, I 
was there the whole time! I would not miss this experience for 
anything).

Anyways, my guess is she will be looking for a clean rust free 
baywindow westy sometime around 2013...

ps: I'm still off list for a while.
