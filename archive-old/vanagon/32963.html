So far it sounds just like the '95 version.  The fact that it's still white
makes me think so as well. They're probably still trying to clear back
stock to make way for the '97 model which they intend to introduce later
this year.

The bed is exactly the same size top and bottom: 43 x 73 I believe. I think
it may be a couple of inches narrower than the Vanagon.

The struts don't lock, but they certainly work nicely now.

Someone at the dealer mentioned seeing one with rear doors instead of a
top-hinged hatch, but didn't have more details other than they thought it
was
a Canadian model. I wonder if that wasn't a Sharan though.
