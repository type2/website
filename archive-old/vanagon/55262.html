If you're old filter was really clogged, I'd be very suspicious of the
fuel supply.  Additionally, clogging could occur upstream of the filter,
i.e. between it and the tank itself, so you may not see it at the filter
yet.  If I were you, I'd drive it for about 35 minutes and go to
somewhere (mechanic or otherwise) where the fuel pressure could be
checked--before it dies (reason for 35 minutes!).  Get a guage on it and
let it idle until it kills, or if necessary, have someone ride in the
back seat with the engine cover off so they can see the guage until it
kills.  If it's clogging, you'll see a dramatic drop in pressure.  If
the pressure remains constant--eliminate fuel supply as the problem
area.  At  least you'll know what it's NOT!

Question for the list--if the vapor return lines are clogged or blocked,
will a 'vapor lock' situation arise that would produce similar behavior?
