Ooop!  This is kind of embarrassing for a red-blooded cork-boot-wearing 
cut-down-trees-for-the-woodstove hockey fan Canadian, but I bought those 
small Canadian flag stickers I gave folks at Pfeiffer '95 at a store in SAN 
FRANCISCO!  Oh, gawds, I have seen the hand of American cultural 
imperialism, and it is mine!  ;-)

You can get all sorts of cool national flag stickers, shirts, flags, etc. 
at a store out on the end of a pier in the Fisherman's Wharf area of SF.  
It's the pier next to the floating docks with all the burping, farting 
sea lions on them.  The store is in the SF yellow pages.

I think it would also be a good place for anyone looking for one of those 
white oval nationality stickers, like the ones that say &quot;D&quot; for Germany.
