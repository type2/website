&gt; Hell, Gary, this is a common experience for most VW owners-- not just
&gt; with the heater, but with the entire car! It's never held us back, dude--
&gt; welcome to the club!

I first bought a '80 diesel rabbit for it's reliability.  I should have 
learned the lesson then before I got hooked.  Now, nine years and eleven 
volkswagens later, I can only confess to one letdown --the dreaded gas 
heater.  I'll bring this up with my therapist, maybe I can get over it and 
continue with my life.
