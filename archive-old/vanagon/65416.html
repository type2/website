Danny, you said:

&lt;&lt; OK, how many of you out there know how to roll up (or down) the power
windows with the key off?  Turn on the headlights, hold the dimmer switch
back on high beam (keep holding), the push the window buttons...Presto!
&gt;&gt;

   Works for my '89, but requires double-pumping the dimmer switch.  Nice
trick!
