Subject: Captain's Chair Arm, '87 camper

First of all, thanks to all of you who helped me figure out how to remove 
the battery.  Y'all were right, the chair *does* turn all the way 
around.... d'oh.  But hey, even the PO hadn't figured this out, as 
evidenced by the plier marks on the metal rim, so I don't feel too bad.

New problem:  After turning the seat around &amp; back, the arm on the door 
side has come semi-detached.  It hasn't come off, but it just flops 
there &amp; provides no support.  Also, a little flat ended (i.e. not 
pointed) screw has worked its way out.  Is there any way, short of 
cutting into the vinyl on the side of the seat, to fix this?  Or do I 
just need to sacrifice the vinyl....?

If it ain't one thing, its another (&amp; I won't even mention the passenger 
side door that now won't latch....).   I think we ignored Olivia too much 
this winter &amp; now she's playing the hypochondriac  ;b

Thanks!
Kathy
