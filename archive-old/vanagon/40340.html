What Is It Doing Stuck In A Little Hole In A Piece Of Sheet Metal That   
Covers The Right Hand Side Of My Lower Exaust Manifold.

Is It Just S'posed To Drip Excess Gas And Stuff On The Inside Of That   
Piece Of Sheet Metal?

Ps. Oh Yeah, Is There Really A &quot;Good&quot; Electric Fuel Pump? Does Rotary   
Make A Difference?  Does $80 - $90 Bucks (Installed) Sound About Right?   
(Ouch, Babe!)

(I'm Guessing That If Anyone Has Had A Late Night Like I Did Last Night   
Trying To Persuede Their Fuel Pump To Stop Leaking That They Might Know   
What I'm Talking About Without Much Explanation)

Thanks Fer Listening.
