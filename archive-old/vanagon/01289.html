Subject: Icebox startup time

 So, I've got this '87 Camper, &quot;weekender&quot; type, with a big black fridge
bolted in behind the passenger seat.  Following the manual, I plugged 'er
into AC current, but after 45 minutes, it still wasn't very cool.  

How long do you all find it takes for the box to really cool down?

Thanks,
        Bart
