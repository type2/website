Subject: Das Bulli Haus Pieces Arrived

        Well, I got the first shipment of DBH pieces for the '54 - the 2
inner rockers and 4 longitudinal frame member pieces.  Quite heavy.  The
frame sections are at least the same guage as the originals would have been,
and are stamped very cleanly.  I know the inner rockers will be a good gig
because I've used them before.

        Last night I got a spool of wire for the new welder, along with a
new tip, and played with it a bit.  Works a lot better now - the old wire
had gotten a bit corroded and did not feed well.

        So my work schedule will now determine whether I go to Vallejo for
the show, or stay at home and weld...
