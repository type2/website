Subject: EV piston slap questions

Piston slap occurs in some EVs. If the engine sounds like a diesel when
first started in the AM, then it is a likely candidate. It will sound loud
and &quot;diesel-like&quot; for about 20-30 seconds when started from a stone-cold
condition. You'll know if it's there. If it is, VW ought to repair this
condition for free under the 50,000 mile power train warranty. My dealer
replaced the pistons at no cost. After replacing the pistons, the loud,
metallic, &quot;diesel&quot; like sounds went away. I am not the original owner of
this EV either. It had _at_ 25k miles and was about 2 years old.

  Oh ****!!,
        
        My EV also sounds like a diesel when it starts in the morning.  Can
any one elaborate on symptoms?  Anybody been there, done that, with the
dealer?  I  worry that if I go to the dealer they will say its the valves
pumping up.  Thats what I thought it was anyway.

Thanks

Ken
