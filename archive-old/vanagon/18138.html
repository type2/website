&gt;&gt; some stuff deleted -- does it have a door?
There is no Cabinet with the unit.  It goes into your cabinet. 
A 2X3 inch hole is needed.
A 6.5X9X2 inch heat sink (bank of alluminum cooling fins) goes inside.
On th outside goes a 2 in. thick  11X13 ( approx its not square ) plastic fan
box with another heat sink inside.
The module itself fits int that 2X3 hole.
 I'll give you a ring this evening.
