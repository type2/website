Subject: Re: Audi Turbo Rims - My Story

Keep in mind everyone, that the German TUV is MUCH stricter than any
USDMV.Obviously in the US you can run any wheels you want on your car (just
look at some of those &quot;low riders&quot; out there) as long as they don't pose a
threat to other mororists, and inhibit the driveability of the vehicle that
they are mounted on....
I have run these wheels with no problem, and know others who are currently
running the Audi Turbo wheels on their Vanagons with no problem either.  I am
about to give a detailed description of the whole process as another
listmember and I will be putting a set of these on his van (off an '83 5000
turbo). The Audi 5000/200 TURBO is a much faster vehicle than the Vanagon (no
duh..) and therefore the wheels have to put up with stresses such as high
speed cornering etc. and hold up. 
I have a '84 Audi 5000 TURBO with these wheels (that's how I first found
they'd fit on a Vanagon) and haven't bent a rim yet, and I've owned the car
for almost 9 years now. 
No offense Helmut, but I've been there, done that, and it done, and looks,
pretty darn good. :&lt;)
