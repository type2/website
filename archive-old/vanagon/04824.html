Subject: O.K., I admit it... I deleted the mail on coolants...


Interesting phenomena...

The &quot;low coolant level&quot; blinking light comes on and goes off in my
'87 Vanagon..  It seems to be in sync with the potholes on the road :-)
Of course, I deleted all the e-mail that went on about coolants, maybe there
was something about the coolant level sensor...  I'd like to check to
see if it is a badly connected wire or something.

Could anybody enlighten me as to the whereabouts of the sensor, and the
whereabouts of the (undoubtedly) many connectors the signal has to
travel through until it gets to the dashboard?

The cooling system is also losing some coolant, at about the rate
of .75 Quarts every 1,000 miles.  Would this have anything to do
with the coolant level light?  I am keeping the coolant level 
correct at the overflow tank, by adding coolant every week, and I
have not noticed any change in the operating position of the engine
temp indicator.

Thanks,
Cetin
