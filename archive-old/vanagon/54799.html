Subject: RE: Stickers?? 

As luck would have it, I just ordered some stickers myself yesterday.

Just send a self addressed stamped envelope to:

	Richard Palmer
	121-C Park Ave
	Raleigh, NC  27605-1832

Enclose $5.00 for 3 stickers or $10.00 for 7.  Prefers cash, will take checks.

A $0.32 stamp on the SAS envelope should cover postage.

The stickers are 5&quot;x3&quot;, so a standard business envelope should be OK.
