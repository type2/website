Subject: Oil press. sw. specs ?

I have installed a new Mexico made oil pressure switch in the sender by 
the water pump.  the PN on the box is 056-919-081 C 

can anyone tell me specs of this switch (not marked on the body like 
German ones) meaning if it is N/O or N/C and the bar rating?

or can anyone verify if this is the right/wrong switch?  it is a 
black body one, as was the one that it replaced.

those of with deductive reasoning powers can guess that i am having 
problems after the installation of this new switch.
