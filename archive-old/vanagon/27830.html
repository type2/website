Subject: ATF the wonder drug
Date: Tue, 31 Oct 95 22:41:15 EST

I'm sure this was gone over but I've just checked the archives
which only netted me 20 ATF articles and none dealing with what
I wanted.  I know ATF is great for de-carboning engine intake
tracks and heads.  I've seen mechanics feed it into the intake
system with much billowing out of carbon, but which ATF Dexron?
or that other Type F stuff or whatever and is it appropriate for
air cooled engines.  The '78 is still reading way high compression
(better than new spec 155 psi) on 2, and 4 which have been at the
receiving ends of leaky injectors I recently found out searching for
problems.  I really would like to even things out if this roto-rooter
treatment wont have adverse effects.  Procedure basically appeared
to me, connect funnel to some vacuum line, pour in ATF, let it stuble
on for a while then dose it heavy to stall it, let it sit.  Go on
your way, my question, which ATF, what quantities.
   On a related subject for the person experiencing lifter noise,
Stephens Machining told me ATF in the oil is excellent lifter cleaner.
Unfortunately I don't recall the suggested mix there either.  Of course
on dissasemble my noisy lifters were not dirty whatsoever, just
apparently too worn.  Will hold pressure on the bench with cold oil,
bleed down when oil hot.
