Spring's here and I decided to attack last winter's promises
to &quot;Buster&quot; with all the vim and vigor of the kid that called on
my 16 year old daughter last night.

Buster (an ailing 72 Bus )  has been plenty gracious about not
leaving me stranded in the dreaded Hinterlands of North Florida although he
constantly reminds me he is only holding on till I could scrape up the bucks
for a replacement tranny.  Over the winter months
I have learned to drive Midtown Manhattan during morning rush hour sipping
coffee and steering with one hand while I kept the other hand on the shifter
(to keep it from selecting neutral), Bungie jumped
(what my daughter calls my mad scramble for the bungie cord I lash
around the shifter when I scrunch into fourth) off-N-on every day as
I drive her to and from school, and last, but not least , initiated the
courting dance of the commuter as I brake, countersteer against the bad
front passenger caliper, clutch my coffee cup and smile all at the same
time as I careen down the hill on my way to my shop....

So many projects, so little time....

A friend I met recently told me of a late model &quot;bus&quot; he saw in a local
U-Pull-It in an adjoining county so's I packed a finger nosh and a sixer
and tootled up over the weekend to see &quot;the body&quot;.

It turned out to be a 77/8 bus, seemingly low miles and under closer
inspection a particularly well cared for one until it met something
considerably less resilient on its front passenger side.  Bad for bus,
good for me...

By midafternoon I was spotted by a cloister of  youngish nuns field stripping
a `72 El Camino as I dragged by the inert form of the soon to be resurected
091 transaxle. I waved to them as I passed &amp; proceeded to lurch foot by foot
to the Gates of Admonishment where I was told by
the Rhode (sic....Road) Scholar behind the ornamental bars that in lieu of my
first male born, $XXX.xx would suffice,  &quot;Did I want a warranty?&quot;  &quot;Sure&quot; I
said, &quot;How considerate of you to ask&quot;  Within seconds my new warranty was
procured for just barely twice what the tranny had
originally been quoted me.  Boy, drag me kicking and screaming into
the 21st century.....

The drive back home was uneventful as the tranny sat quietly in the
rear cargo area all the way home and uttered not a peep until I pulled
into the garage ( I use the term garage loosely, as the truth of the matter
is it is more an arrangement of like minded buildings cohabitating as
long it remains mutually beneficial to all) where it decided to jump off
the engine compartment area onto the last three unopened Pilsners.
Easier to explain than to clean up....   However, as the thread on polishing
your case progresses, might I add a good stout tends to shine
aluminum like no rubbing compound can....!

I spent the rest of the weekend doing meaningless things to Buster in
preparation for the &quot;Big Transmorfagration&quot; I planned to do later.
A bit of rewiring here, a rerouted gas line ( I converted from FI to the
Weberman early on) there, a serious check list of metal bits that needed
to be replaced as soon as I could procur them AFTER I won the Lotto.

Yesterday morning, stiff from the previous days exertion I climbed up\under
Buster and bolted up the new 091 (invert the bottom engine
-bellhousing studs, or replace with 22mm longer for case clearance.
Change out the older starter for the newer style and add the front mount
bushings to the existing hanger and..... viola

No more bobo shifter dances, course...The brakes ARE getting worse!

As Roseanne Roseanna Danna used to say. &quot;It's -always- something!&quot;

Ooot!
