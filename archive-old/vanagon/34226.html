OK! If you want to program your wipers, here we go!

Jim is describing, below, exactly what I was talking about. They are
available at your local VW dealer for about $35.  According the the
Quattro list, the VW part# is: 1HM 955 531A

&gt; I recently had this to say on this subject:
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of wiper relays, I have one in my 87 Syncro that allows for
&gt; variable intermittant timing. I originally bought this for my Jetta,
&gt; but after I totaled it I pulled the relay and stuck it in my van. I
&gt; think I  remember paing about $25-$30 for it in about 1987. It works &gt; with no  additional external controls. You just put the wip=
er stalk into &gt; &amp; back out of intermittant position, causing the wiper to wipe once.  &gt; Then, when the windshield gets to the point =
where you want it to wipe &gt; again, just put the stalk into intermittant and leave it. It will keep  &gt; wiping at the interval between=
 the first wipe and when you pushed it &gt; back into intermittant mode.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, I don't know where I got this little thing. I recall
&gt; phone  ordering it from an advertiser in a VW magazine. Does anyone know &gt; if these are still available &amp; from who?
