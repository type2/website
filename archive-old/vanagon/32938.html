That's me. That's my 009. In the words of Elvis: &quot;thank you. thank you 
very much.&quot;

I just didn't think that the 009 might be messed up, but I have noticed 
&quot;jumpy&quot; timing...and I think I even saw the timing change on me once I 
got it adjusted. That is...she was idling at about 10 degrees atdc, but 
when I started back up she was at about 15 atdc. &quot;Naw.....I must be 
seeing things,&quot; I thought to myself.

Thanks! I'll accelerate the quest for a new distributor. My FLAPS may 
be able to order one for gold pieces.

&gt; 	Your 009 may not be working properly.  Using a strobe timing 
&gt; light, watch the timing mark move when increasing engine speed.  If the 
&gt; lit mark sticks and then jumps to full advance the 009 is probably junk.  
&gt; A working single vacuum advance canister distributor would be a good 
&gt; investment for you right now.  Good luck.  Gary Gibson
