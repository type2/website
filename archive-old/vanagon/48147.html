Subject: stats update

     Thanks to all who replied to my water pump questions.  I ended up 
     having my mechanic replace the pump.  
     
     I paid too much money, but I needed it done yesterday because I leave 
     Sunday to travel from Portland, OR to Raleigh, NC.  I plan on two days 
     to Rifle, CO.  I will spend 5 days rockclimbing in Rifle (just outside 
     Glenwood Springs).  Then I'll spend the weekend in Boulder, CO.  The 
     following Monday morning I will take two days from Boulder to Raleigh. 
     This will be my fourth (one-way) traverse of the US in the past year. 
     
     I've had my van for 12 months, and I've put 30,000 miles on it.  Is 
     that some kind of record?
     
     Joel, please transfer one 1987 Vanagon GL Westfalia from Portland, OR 
     (Northwest) to Raleigh, NC.  I'm being optimistic, I hope I don't have 
     any trouble which would negate this stat.
     
     If any of you guys see me on the road, wave.  My van is Titian (sp?) 
     red and I have photo-voltaic cell mounted on the roof and a Yakima 
     rack with my mountain bike and snowboard.  There is also a giant dent 
     in the rear hatch and bumper and I have Colorado tags.  You can't miss 
     me!
     
     I'll be unsubscribing later today until I get back to NC.
     
     Wish me luck and I'll talk to you later........
