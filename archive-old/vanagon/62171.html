Subject: engine compartment sealing

Hi all,
I have been working on replacing fuel lines and gas tank seals on my 82
westy this past month.  I realized that the foam seal on the license plat=
e
was a major source of engine compartment leakage.  Apparently the old foa=
m
had decomposed and was almost gone.  Dust had gotten all over my engine
compartment during a recent short trip on dirt roads.  =


I fixed this by scraping off the remaining deteriorated foam.  I then too=
k
an old insulate pad (the thin foam pad you sleep on when camping and
backpacking)I cut a section to fit in the license plate cover and glued
that is place.  I think this will make a very nice seal as it is closed
cell foam.  Very inexpensive.   I just wanted to mention this and that
folks should not overlook the license plate as a leak source.

Hoping to be sealed and dust free.
