The thermostat should be 46mm in length at 85-90 C. The best way to test is
in boiling water with a thermometer. If it doesn't fall
within this range then junk it. The consensus seems to be that when a
thermostat fails it expands to almost its full length. That in combination
with the flaps being spring loaded to  be open mean that having the
thermostat installed is a good thing. If it does fail the engine will not
overheat and if it works your engine will warm up more quickly. Mind you I
have a failed thermostat currently installed in our engine (gave up after
7 months) and the engine seems to warm up pretty quickly anyway  (325F at
idle in sub-zero temps). Replacement cost is around 18 dollars US......

&gt; 
&gt; 180F (80C), I believe.
