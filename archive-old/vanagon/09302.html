&gt; I shall volunteer to make a 24 egg scramble, almost like a Denver
&gt; omlette but messier and with more stuff. Feeds about 10 to 12 people.

I volunteer to supply moral support...

&gt; Things that would go with it - toast, bagels, home fries, hash browns,
&gt; salsa, fruit, ?? Could someone please volunteer to bring some such stuff.

I'll bring bread, salsa, and fresh fruit, plus anything else I can fit in.
How are we gonna make toast?  Hold the bread in the flame with a fork, I
guess...

&gt; ps. there are 40mph winds hitting the coast, and some 20+ft waves, and
&gt; a whole lot of rain today.

Yep, I was just out in it.  Got soaked in a matter of seconds.  Supposed
to go away by Thursday night, with another one supposed to be right
behind it.  :(
