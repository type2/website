Subject: The Epic Trip/Matty J


Thanks to everyone for your replies regarding our West Coast trip. We hope 
to meet as many of you as possible along the way, and hope you can keep the 
list updated on our adventures! (I have yet to find a Westy with a built-in 
modem!) 

I fly to Tahoe on the 21st and will proceed to search for the VW Camper for 
our trip. If anyone comes upon a decent, road ready camper for sale in the 
Northern California area, please drop me a line at TWNFRMHELL_at_aol_dot_com which 
is my big sister's address. 

You can respond to me directly at mjeschelnik_at_gph_dot_com today only, as it is 
my last day of work. (also, if you have not responded yet and would like to 
meet us along our journey's path). 

We plan on taking lots of photos, so maybe someone with access to a scanner 
and creating homepages could create one for our adventure, along with 
pictures we take of listmembers along the way. (sort of a Vanagon_at_lenti 
yearbook!) 

Till then, I've studied Muir, learned about compression tests, the 
adventure begins! 

See ya soon!

Matty J &amp; Suz
