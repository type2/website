Subject: Re: Can I field-tune a 34 PICT-3?

Ken,


There's nothing special about tweaking a PICT-3.  It does have a couple of
differences but the basics are the same.

The small brass screw determines the amount of fuel fed to the engine when
the throttle plate is properly set.  Start with that.  Once you have the
throttle plate properly set the other adjustments fall into place.

On the 34-PICT-3 you want the throttle plate NOT completely closed.  The spec
is a gap of about four thou.  To achieve that with the carb on the vehicle,
use the throttle screw.  Turn it out until it is clear of the fast-idle cam,
the stepped quadrant on the choke shaft. Then turn the screw in until it
barely touches the quadrant.  The throttle plate should now be closed.  To
open it four thousands of an inch, turn the throttle screw a precise quarter
turn.  Based on the threads-per-inch of the throttle screw and the lever
 length of the throttle arm &amp; throttle plate, a quarter turn gives about four
thou clearance in the throat, which is what you want.

The volume of gasoline fed to the bleed-air at idle is set in the same way as
on other carbs.  Turn the small brass screw all the way in -- gently -- until
it bottoms.  That establishes the base-line.  Now back it out two-and-a-half
to three turns.  Somewhere in that range the engine will receive enough fuel
to start and run.

Make sure all the hoses are connected and the studs are tight.  Go ahead and
fire it up. Let it warm up.  You can't adjust the carb until the choke is
standing vertically.  Be sure air cleaner is on.  The carb expects it to be
there.

What you need to do now is set the idle speed and this adjustment is the big
difference between the 34PICT-3 and earlier carbs.

See that big aluminum screw? It's called the BYPASS screw.  (They're talking
air here.) It's a bit above the mixture adjustment screw.  Use the BYPASS
screw to set your idle speed.  Leave the throttle adjustments strictly alone.

Set your idle on the high side, up around 900 rpm.  If you don't have a tach
you'll have to do it by ear.  A little too fast is better than a lot too slow
-- the VW NEEDs to idle fast, otherwise it can't keep itself cool.

Now go back to the mixture -- the volume control screw (they're talking
gasoline here) -- and see if you can make it run any faster.  Tweak the
volume control screw to get the FASTEST idle at that particular setting of
the Bypass screw.  Found the fast spot?  Now back it off a tad.  A 'tad' is
25rpm.  I'll leave you to figure out how to measure it.  And a 'tweak' means
no more than three-quarters of a turn or so.  If you go beyond that there's
really no adjustment being made.  The volume control screw is a needle valve.
 Turn it too far out, you've just got a hole.  The adjustment range is about
half a turn plus or minus starting with a baseline somewhere in the vicinity
of 3 turns off the seat.  Yeah, I know that sounds kinda iffy but that's the
nature of needle valves.  If someone has turned the thing in too far they
will have broached the hole so large that barely backing the needle out
results in a huge flow of gas.  The specs I've just cited are really for a
brand new carb.  For a carb that has been in service for a while, the mixture
adjustment is liable to be almost anything.  Just do the best you can.

Tweaking the mixture will have elevated your idle speed, so go back to the
Bypass screw and slow things down.  Bring the idle back within the normal
range.  I run mine at about 850.

As to driveability, check your choke, make sure it's working properly.  And
your flat spots may be due to an improperly adjusted accelerator pump.  It
has a range of adjustments.  If it's on the low end of the range, adjust it
to give a bit more gas when you put your foot down.  

Your timing and valves should be dead-on before you go messing with the carb.

If you're running a centrifugal distributor, all bets are off.  They respond
only to changes in speed rather than changes in throttle position (ie, load).
 Vacuum advance senses the change in throttle position, starts advancing the
curve immediately, allows for the smooth response you need for normal
driving.
