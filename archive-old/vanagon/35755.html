&gt;G'day all
&gt;
&gt;Looks like I'm hooked, so I am going to do it all, and make sure it is 
&gt;done right! (had a bad experience long ago with a mechanic who knew less 
&gt;than me and I was only 17! Many motor/auto/panel/paints since then)
&gt;
&gt;1. I'm told that the coolant is extremely toxic. What do I do with the 
&gt;old stuff?(I dont want to polute waterways but I want the job done 
&gt;properly)
&gt;
&gt;2. I would really like to get a copy of the Bently manual that isn't 
&gt;gold plated ($240 US here). Could someone please help me?

Scott, 

When I was 17 I knew more than everyone!

An alternative to the Bentley manual is the CD-Rom from Alldata.  Thom
recommended it and I ordered one for my 85 Westy for $25 US.  The guy on the
phone told me it contained all info that was in Bentley's and then they added
more.  I'll tell you how good it is when I get it.
