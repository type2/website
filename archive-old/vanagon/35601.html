Hi Vanagon Listers!

My VW sensories are currently overloaded as my wife and 
I returned from the desert climes of Las Vegas, NV where I beheld one of 
my greatest pleasures (vices?):  Rustfree aircooled VW gawking!  8-)
I love it!  Gambling?? what's that?  haha  For what it's worth, we spent 
about $4 on slots, won about $15 and bought a t-shirt for our 3 yr old.
We did take in Hoover Dam and Death Valley--neat places.  A few bubble 
window buses and Vanagons were seen along the excursions.

VW wise, I didn't see any 64 &amp; earlier bugs, saw about 3 splittie buses, 
2 66 &amp; 67 bugs, 2 Karmann Ghias, and about a dozen newer bugs on the road.  
The 'Beetle Barn' shop in the NE part of Las Vegas had a *big* supply of 
salvage VWs, but it was Sunday when we were up there and I only saw the 
collection from the fence.  There were rows of Bubble Windows and more 
Vanagons then I expected.
