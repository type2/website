Subject: another place to look for parts

Just got back from a quick, wet trip down the Oregon coast. These EV's seem
'big' inside compared to the Vanagon. Dry and warm, with room to stretch
out. I love it. It rained and blew all night, the coast was mostly socked
in, but I didn't mind much. I almost finished Theroux's &quot;The Pillars of
Hercules&quot; while I was down there. So far, my main complaint about the EV is
that noisy fresh water pump - I much preferred the electrical one in my
Vanagon, or even better that hand pump that was in there.

Anyway, down along 101, somewhere between Cannon Beach and Newport, I
passed a place called 'Beaver Creek Bobs' which had a few buses, at least
one Vanagon, a Ghia, a few Beetle's, and many 411's sitting alongside. I
know these aren't the best directions, but hey, you can't get everything
for free.

Is it just me, or does Oregon seem like a lot more sensible state than
Washington lately? No Pat Robertson fanatics lurking in every small town,
much less the church/capita ratio that rural Washington seems to support
these days. Also a public radio network that reaches across the state. Also
one of the most progressive and sensible land use laws around, unlike in
Washington where its 'every property owner for themselves and damn the
neighbors downstream!'
(By this I mean the definite urban/rural boundaries in Oregon - unlike the
Washington Growth Mgmt Act which many counties are trying to work around.)

okay, my opinions are showing. not very vw-related. sorry. Good tip about
the shop I hope though.
