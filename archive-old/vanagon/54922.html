Subject: my '81 westy FS near San Francisco


After much deliberation, I've decided to sell my '81 westy.  Don't
think I'm stopping camping:  au contraire, this group has gotten
to me so much, I'd now like to get into a high-top (rather
than a pop-top) and especially to custom-design my own interior.  
Not sure yet on which platform, but anyway, here's the particulars:

1981 westfalia, air-cooled of course
4 speed transmission
current/valid registration
factory air-conditioning
mileage:  138K
185R/14 Michelin tires, newish
deluxe camper package; everything present and working

add-ons:  
guages - oil temp, oil press, cyl head temp, volt meter
also, I had an external oil cooler added.  This is set
to go on automatically if oil temps exceed 185F, but also
has an over-ride switch in case one wants to turn it on
in other circumstances

upgrades/improvements since I acquired the car at 106K:  
new upholstery everywhere, including padding
new engine, Mark Stevens heads
new clutch, starter
recent new paint - home job, but looks pretty good.  body is very good
3 extra auxilliary batteries, including 2 golf-carts under rear seat
front floor mats, 2 sets
 
I have all records since I've owned the car, but none from before.
I've serviced the car regularly since I've owned it.

Everything is present and works on the car with the exception of the
following:

faucet knob top is cracked - works on tank water fine, though
missing front bumper end cap
front brakes should probably be bled; they have about 40% life left
  (just did rear brakes a few months ago)
fuel guage - works fine when full, but disappears to below E after 1/3 tank

And yes, the sliding door works perfectly. J:)

---

I polled several friends from the group; the collective consciousness
suggests that $3,999 is a fair price.  If interested, contact me e-mail 
(address below).

Thanks,

Martha
