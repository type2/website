&gt;the '80 Rabbit that I had a few years ago but not this and the Bentley that I

Dear Brad,

You have two wonderful choices, actually your choices are unlimited, but
that's another story. One is to reset the counter, it's located about 3/4 of
the way down the speedo cable under the left side, sorta a small black box
with a couple of wires and the speedo cable attached on both ends. Just push
the small button. Or simply unplugs it! You might want to tape off the
connections out of a sense of tidiness, It's a German vehicle remember&lt;g&gt;.
