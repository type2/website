My '84 Vanagon has a rebuilt engine.  I've had it for a month, or so, and 
it's been backfiring lately.  It happened a few times on a 500 mile weekend 
trip.  Lately it happens when it's been running a short time.  Any ideas why 
it's backfiring, and what can a weekend handyman do to try and fix it?
