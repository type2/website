The title of this topic has gotten weird !  No ?   Anyway, to answer
David's question about the holes.  Not neccessary, as the seam is quite
accessable from inside and through the electrical hook-up cover  outside.
Needless to say this all applies to camper Vanagons.  If you have an
&quot;ordinary&quot; ?? Vanagon, access is from inside only, by removing wall
panels, if a paneled van obviously,  UG !   (:-(

 I like Steves approach and may take up his method.  I had my '87 &quot;CROWM&quot;
coated this fall for $110 cnd.  But powerwashing and a couple of cans of
RustCheck sound like a better deal to me.

Cheers 

Frank
