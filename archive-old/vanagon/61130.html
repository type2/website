     Raul asked in part:
     
          . . . any other suggested tires that are in the Yokohama price 
          range-about $69-$79 per at Sears?
     
     My recently-purchased '91 Westfalia sports a set of Sears-Michelin 
     &quot;Roadhandler Sport&quot; 205/70 R14 95T M+S tires rated at 1521 Lbs load at 
     a maximum pressure of 44 PSI.  I don't know what they cost, because 
     the PO had them installed.  They seem to run okay, and look good on 
     the alloys.
     
     My only beef is that even though the tires are almost new, Sears will 
     not officially transfer the warranty (or the road hazard the PO paid 
     for), my consolation is &quot;. . . we'll work with you on it if there are 
     any problems.&quot;
     
     BTW, I think they said that the tire carries a 60K pro-rated tread 
     wear warranty, FOR THE ORIGINAL OWNER!
