So then, Thom queries:

&gt;Where do you live?  I drive thru the _exact_same fog!

Once upon a(nother) lifetime, I lived in northwest Sackatomato, over by the
CHP Acad.  Anyway, I *know* what it's like to drive between Redding and 
Visalia in the dead of winter.  As a testament to my stupidity in my younger
days, I was bombing along 99 once in pea soup and I caught and almost passed
a CHP cruiser going about 40-45 mph (the cruiser, not me).
Not that it's the most fun thing to do in the world, but occaisionally it`s
sort of ironic to pace a cruiser...

VW content:
Regarding those Hella rear fog lamps, I second your opinion; they really can
be a lifesaver and everyone driving in the CA Central Valley ought to have
'em.  (and not hooked up as a stop light, either!)

On a related note, the T4 has those two cutouts on the back bumper that are
meant to house the rear fog lamp.  Ric, have you looked into these?  I 
think they'd *really* look way-rad back there!
