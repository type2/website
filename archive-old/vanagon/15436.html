Subject: A Story

&gt;From the bushrat &lt;gremlin_at_iol.ie&gt; --- Eeeefin mail programs :-(

Part the First.

The mechanic said the blue thing needs another CV boot.  The CV joint on the
repaired side feels really rough.

Part the Second.

On Monday night, the gears were tricky to select.  On Tuesday, I lost first,
second and reverse.  The VW garage guy said it's just a linkage.  Yeah,
right.  And I feel like I'm stirring soup...

Part the Third.

An ad in the local newspaper tomorrow reads - FOR SALE : '91 VW Transporter
(new shape) 107K miles, good condition, 'phone 065-29691.

Epilogue.

I'm gonna put the cash into the credit union, buy a brick (albeit
temporarily) and then get a '93 when a nice clean one becomes available.

The Bushrat is destined to become a wannabus, at least for a while...

The End
