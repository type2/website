Subject: tips on assembling wing windows for a splittie

has anyone out there done this latly?  i am trying to use new WCM glass 
to frame rubber, but am having a heck of a time getting it to seat the 
last 1/4 inch.  it will not budge.  also, how do you go about trimming 
the excess rubber of behind the water catch.  any ideas would be greatly 
apreciated.
thanks and God Bless
matt
