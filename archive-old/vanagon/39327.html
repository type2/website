Subject: '81 Westy Pilot Bearing

Pulled the motor today anticipating a clutch pboblem and found the 
needle bearings on the pilot shaft smeared all over and welded to the 
shaft and inside the crank. Evedently no lubrication. I am going to 
replace the bearing and rear seal and o-ring in the flywheel but what 
else need to be done while I'm in there? And what is the felt they 
describe in the Bently?
Also I have a problem with oil dripping out between the crankcase and 
the transmission but the rear oil seal looks fine. At the bottom of 
the crankcase there is a small hole. What is it and can Oil be coming 
out of it?  The oil comes out when I stop, drips considerable and 
eventually stops. Any Ideas?
Thanks
