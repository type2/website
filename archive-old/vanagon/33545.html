&gt; hi..Jimbo here..spotted a 70 westy out this way (near NYC) for sale. It is
&gt; on a lot about 45 minutes out of the city. The guy is asking $2995. Now this
&gt; is a lot considering the brakes are shot (there is no fluid in the res!), the motor has an awful clanking sound (with a rhytym one can dance to) and the the white
&gt; paint job doesn't match the original cream color under the fiberglass. I offered him 1500, he said no. I told him the word is out on this bus ( a lot of people have contacted me) and that only an uninformed being is gonna pay this
&gt; canvas...body is straight and solid, but has been hit in left nose. No progressive
&gt;  rust, a little bondo on nose only..email me for more info and exact location
&gt; /phone...jimbo.

Ha!  This guy needs to get a clue.  I just bought a '72 with original 
interior, new brakes, 2000cc F.I. (fairly new, built in '93) engine for 
$2500.00.  No bondo at all, interior is mint and includes the Safare 
Conversions camping package which was professional installed back in '72 
and still looks and operates very well (especially the sink).
