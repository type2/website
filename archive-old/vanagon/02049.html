 Hi,
	Since we're talking tyres again I'll pipe up with my info:

 I'm using 195R14s on my '71 westy in an 8 ply rating. These are, quite
possibly, total overkill but they are what came on the van when I bought it.

 The ride quality is excellent and the handling is fine.
 They last and last and last...
 The steering is quite heavy when parking- this may be due to the tyres but
	I don't really know as I havn't driven anyone elses van to compare.
 They are three different brands: Riken, Uniroyal &amp; something else-
	replacements started at about 50 UK pounds and ran up to 90 or so
	when I had to replace one with a blistered sidewall.
 I run 29 psi front &amp; rear.

 This combination seems to work well for me, though any suggestions will be
gratefully received. My folks buy the toughest (most heavy duty) tyres they
can find for their vans (now two front engined &amp; one waterboxer) because
they use them for hauling books- very heavy- so their experience probably
isn't relevant to most of the list volks.

Cheers,
        W.
