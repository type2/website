&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have a make/model/year of a Ford product that takes 
&gt; the 3 wire sensor?  All the FLAPS folks want to do is look it up
&gt; on the computer and are generally unwilling to play around trying
&gt; to match a part. 
&gt; 

I'll look at the box later on today.  But, I would suggest calling
the local German auto parts places, or a local independent VW repair
shop.  They should be able to hand over the correct O2 sensor to you.

If the place you're going to hires boneheads who just punch your 
answers into the parts inventory computer, you're probably at the
wrong place.  I prefer to shop at stores where I can get useful advice
with my purchases.
