Subject: 6v guages/wipers in 12v car

Hi folks.

My '62 Kombi has had a 12v conversion, but has a 6v fuel guage
(new to the car, it's from a '66) and 6v wipers.  The prev.
owner said the wipers &quot;worked fine&quot; but he used to have a
&quot;weak&quot; battery in the car (there's a new one now). 

I think they pivot way too fast, so I&quot;m looking for opinions
on what to do.  

Options:

1.  Run them and hope they last awhile.
2.  Get some kind of voltage drop, RMMW sells one for ~$10 which
    has a 50 watt capacity--this seems too low, am I right?  I've
    also seen the wiper controller which includes a rheostat to
    vary the speed--anybody like these?  They're a little pricey.
3.  Someone told me you could get the motor rewound for 12v.  I'm
    going to call around to some electrical shops on this.
4.  Rain-X
5.  swap in a 12v mechanism.  Anyone know which years are compatible?

Opinions/ideas?  

Fuel guage:  I don't really know how these things work, please advise.
If I get a voltage drop, does it power the sender, the guage, or both?

Thanks all,

Mark
