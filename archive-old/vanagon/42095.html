Subject: Rear Bumpers

I checked out the Volks-Motor Sports page that was listed here the other day
to check and see if they had bumpers.  Nothing listed, so I E-mailed the guy
and he wrote back:


&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the good words!
&gt;
&gt;  We do have rear Vanagon Bumpers, they don't have the holes in them for 
&gt;the rubber strip, but it is very easy to drill them and mark them if you 
&gt;buy one.
&gt;  
&gt;  Take a piece of masking tape and lay it on the old one over the holes 
&gt;and punch out the holes.  Then remove the tape and lay it on the new one 
&gt;and you have a template to use, very simple.
&gt;
&gt;  We sell the bumper only for $125.00, caps and hardware are extra and 
&gt;prices are on the list.
&gt;
&gt;  Hope this helps!

$125, versus $350 at the dealer--not half bad!
