Subject: Re: Retorque heads?

Back in the dark ages, my '68 gobbled a valve and spewed chewed pieces into
the adjacent cylinders. I pulled the engine, swapped out the head, and
reinstalled inside of three hours - by myself, but with the help of a good
floor jack.

Later, with a more modern engine (74?) removal and reinstallation took a
bit more time (another hour maybe?) and I used up a good friend and
could've used another. But it got done.   :-)  I probably shoulda left the
engine attached to the transaxle or something.
