Subject: wasserbus clutch info

Hello,

Thanks to all who answered my inquiry about the fridge. Something else has
come up that I need some help with. I seem to have a leak in either my
master or the slave cylinder on my 83 wasserwesty clutch. The pedal is
getting closer to the floor and there is a little oil on the steering boot
below the pedal. The brake however feels fine. Does anyone know if I can
add more oil to buy some more time until I have the cash to take it to the
mechanic? Any idea about price to fix either part? I do not have bentley
yet so it would be a bit hard to figure it out (and since this is my first
hydraulic clutch I really have no clue as to where I begin). Any info would
be greatly appreciated.

Dave
