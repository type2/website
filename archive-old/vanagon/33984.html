Not to be callous, but won't the van now get empounded?

Also, I wonder if Kevorkian realizes that he could modify his heat 
exchangers (or just install them improperly) and get the same effect.
Heck, here we are working hard to make sure our buses AREN'T death 
machines and he goes and gives them all a bad name. I hope they sell his 
bus at public auction...and somebody fixes the heat exchangers.
