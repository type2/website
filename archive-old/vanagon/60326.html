&gt;&gt;High Idle on 87 2.1 l Digifant
&gt;&gt;I did some more trouble shooting today.  I checked the throttle return =
&gt;&gt;spring, it works fine.  I checked the vacuum lines, When I disconnected =
&gt;&gt;the white or purple vacuum lines, the ones that come from the big =
&gt;&gt;canister in the passenger side rear wheel well, nothing happened.  Yes I =
&gt;&gt;mean absolutely NOTHING.  This would cause me to think that either the =
&gt;&gt;lines were cracked or there is a problem with this canister.  The lines =
&gt;&gt;were not cracked and the connections are good.  So what is this canister =
&gt;&gt;what does it do, and how can I check it?
&gt;
&gt;The canister is a charcole purge canister that recyclies gas vapors from
&gt;the gas tank. This no vaccum source attachet to it. True they are vaccum
&gt;hoses, but they vent only.
&gt;
&gt;With the engine running, and all safety precautions taken, you could
&gt;attach of vaccuum gage to the motor right at the main vacuum source
&gt;nipple, use a plastic tee connector if you only have one place and it of
&gt;course has a hose on it.  With the guage attached use a pair of needle
&gt;nose pliers to one by one momentarily crimp the major branchs of the
&gt;vacuum system near the source nipple. Watch the guage for &quot;rise&quot;, a better
&gt;vacuum.  If this occurs,follow that branch crimping after each split in
&gt;it's distrubution, watching each time for the &quot;rise in vacuum pressure.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If you have a vacuum leak in a hose,this method will quickly locate it. If
&gt;no improvement in vacuum pressure occurs, and your vacuum pressure is low,
&gt;at idle, 15 inches or less I believe, healthy is at 17-22 inches, then a
&gt;engine vacuum leak is a good possibilty.  People spray a squirt of soapy
&gt;solution, or starting fluid at the intake manifold connetions, to either
&gt;see bubbles or a rise in the engine RPM.
