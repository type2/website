Subject:       Vanagon Engine Problems

To Whom It May Concern,

I request your either your advice on a problem I have with my 
1986 Vanagon or can you recommend someone I can ask?

For the second time since 1990 (first at 37,000 mi. and 
now at 91,000 mi) my head gaskets leaked coolant.  
This time the leak is very severe.

I'm first trying to decide to fix the engine or replace it with a 
rebuilt one.  Should I fix or replace?

Do you know of a reputable independent VW repair facility 
in the Northeast Mississppi or Northwest Alabama area?

The closest VW dealer/repair facility is over 90 miles away in 
Meridian, MS.

My choices are to buy a VW rebuild or one from an
independent rebuilder.

VW wants $2,500.00 for a rebuild.

I've contacted three rebuilders listed in VW Trends:


So. Cal Imports in Beliflower, CA  $1,400.00

East German Auto in Hawthorne, CA $1,400.00

RTR in CA $1,800.00

Can you recommend any of these or someone else?

I appreciate your help.

Butch Stokes
