Subject: Re: Awning/tent for Eurovan

&gt;John,
&gt; I just bought a 95 Eurovan camper and the awning from the dealer. It is
&gt;pretty neat little contraption. I cost $377. It is a very generic awning
&gt;for any eurovan and probably vanagan. It took drilling 6 holes about the
&gt;size of my index finger into the top of the body(ouch!) for the anchors
&gt;but the rest was just slipping  the awning into the anchors. It doesn't
&gt;have the tent like feature but I have had ideas to attach misquito netting
&gt;around the outside edges to make it tentlike. sofar I haven't found any good
&gt;netting but I figure it should only cost about another 80-100 dollars to buy
&gt;the netting and some zippers.

&gt;&gt; I'm looking for an awning with a side tent/room for a Eurovan.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I figure it may come in handy on those rainy days.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone know of any suppliers?

Hi Robert!

Where is this dealer located?

When the top is down is the awning completely out of sight?

John
