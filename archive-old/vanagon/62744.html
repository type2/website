Ron,

Well, since you know you're supposed to have chrome lugs
and you have a mixed set, you should contact Mr. Service
Manager and state (firmly, I might add) that his dealership
owes you, what, 10 chrome lugs?  And upon receipt you should
send the wrong ones back.

I had a dealership throw some minor interior trim pieces 
away once, but they acknowleged the error and replaced
them.  However, they also scratched the tint on the windows,
which kind of pissed me off, but, anyway, you should get
the right lugs and then start looking for another place or
person to do your more involved Vanagon work.

BTW, is your closest dealer really 100+ miles away?

Norman
