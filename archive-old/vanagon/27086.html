Subject:       Re: Tailgators, &quot;burn them.&quot;

I have seen a few vechiles (Hot Rods) that have the capibility to 
shoot 5 to 15 foot flames out the tail pipes.  This is acomplished 
with a sparkplug in the pipe and doing something to the fuel mixture. 
Or for the wealthy folk you can sometimes find a kit with a 
presurized fuel squirter.  I always thought that would be pretty 
effective in getting rid of tailgaters.  Might get a little 
interesting with the &quot;unique&quot; V.W. exhaust system.
