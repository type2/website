&gt;The &quot;old geezer&quot; had a wood stove in his bus?  Could this be the answer to
&gt;all of my heating problems?  Of course it is probably pretty hard to stoke
&gt;it up at 60 mph unless you mount it on the passenger seat.
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives a whole new meaning to the term &quot;gas heater&quot;...    :^)

Oops, not Friday yet.   ...*never mind*...
