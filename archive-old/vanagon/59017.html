Subject: Preparing for an 8,000 Mile Trip

I will be taking my recently purchased '84 Westy on an 8,000 mile trip 
this summer.  Any suggestions on problem areas to check out before I go?

I have just replaced the heads, water pump, thermostat, belts, clutch, 
pressure plate, release bearing, and pilot bearing, flushed the cooling 
system, and taken a good look at anything that I have touched in the 
process.  I have also inspected the brakes for wear and leaks, and will 
buy new tires before the trip.  The PO repacked the wheel bearings and 
replaced the fuel pump within the last two years, or so.

Bill
