Subject: Needed: CO2 setup for NC gathering (HOMEBREW!!!)


hey now,

i was talking with poor richard today about the upcoming NC VW gathering next
weekend. i've got a problem...i've got a keg of Armenian Stout that's been
aging for about 8 months now. i'd love to take it to the gathering. BUT i
can't afford the CO2 setup required to get the beer outta the keg. anyone
in NC got one? would you join us for a VW gathering and some FREE homebrew?
let's see...Transporter Stout? Loafer Stout? VolksStout? what to name it?
if you can help, please let me know ASAP!
