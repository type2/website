In your case I would suspect a faulty automatic shut-off safety valve.
They are designed to shut-off if a flame is not ignited in a certain
span of time.  Also, if there is not enough oxygen present, then the
igniter will continue to try to keep the pilot lit.  I would imagine
after several attempts, It would close the same safety valve.
