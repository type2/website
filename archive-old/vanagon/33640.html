Subject: RE: Splitty brakes &amp; tyres


&gt;I got the rear hub/axle nuts undone, but the hubs won't come off because 
the
&gt;brake adjusters are seized up, I can't slacken the brakes off enough...
&gt;
&gt;The adjusters are soaking in WD-40 overnight &amp; I'll try with a bigger
&gt;screwdriver tomorrow (my cheapo one bent like toffee on them). In the
&gt;meantime,
&gt;any suggestions?


Several suggestions:

1. Just before you go to bed, hit them again with WD-40. It's great stuff,
but it goes away fairly quickly.

2. Tomorrow, put your screwdriver tip where the tooth on the adjuster
meets the adjuster body. Angle the screwdriver so it's not pointing
straight at the center of the adjuster, and whack it fairly hard with
a hammer, like a center punch. Don't hit it REAL hard, since you can break
a tooth off the adjuster doing this. The shock will usually get it going.

3. If this doesn't work, soak it again and try that evening. The whacks
you gave it, might put a little fracture in the rust between the adjuster
and its threaded plungers, enough to let the WD-40 to seep in and do a
job on the rust.

4. If all else fails, maybe try aiming a propane torch in through the
adjusting holes, directly at the star wheel? I've never had to go this
far-- anybody out there tried it? The theory is, the star wheel will
expand at a different rate than the threaded plunger, and may crack loose
fromthe rust holding them frozen.



&gt;Also, what's the correct pressure for the tyres?

In the rear, I like to put the maximum listed on the tire.
In the front, about 5 psi less (sorry, don't know what that is in kg
per square meter).

If you have reinforced or light-truck tires with humongous max-pressure
like 50 psi, then try about 40 psi rear, and 35 psi front. If it blows
around a lot on the road, or generally feels sloppy, increase both of these
pressures by around 5 psi. Obviously, don't exceed the max pressure listed
on the tire.

As you know, pressures should be measured cold, like if you haven't driven
it for several hours, or if you have driven it less than a mile since it
was stone cold.

P.S. Several times, as an experiment, I have measured my tire pressure
cold, in the morning after the bus has sat all night. Then I've driven it
a lot, to make sure the tires were well wrmed up, and then measured again.
I have NEVER found a difference in pressure, between cold and hot! Am I
jinxed???
