Subject: Re: Lousy idle....brake boost....CR

&gt; Howdy,
&gt;
&gt; I've been following your narrative adventure with your aftermarket F.I. and
&gt; my attention was caught by a remark you made the other day concerning brake
&gt; booster problems. On a '72 bus I used to own, I fought problems with poor 
&gt; idling for years &lt;literally!&gt;. One afternoon, I was engaged in the 19th Ave
&gt; Grand Prix making a run for the Golden Gate bridge in traffic and was forced
&gt; to go from full throttle in second gear to a full application of the brakes
&gt; VERY quickly. YIKES! NO BOOST! Although I was able to get slowed down in
&gt; time, it hurt bad enough that I resolved to look into this further. There is 
&gt; a check valve in the system so that boost is maintained even when there is
&gt; no manifold vacuum so I determined that I must have a leak somewhere upstream
&gt; of that valve and indeed, it turned out to be the booster that leaked. A
&gt; trip to the junkyard yielded a newer booster and, lo and behold, good brakes
&gt; AND A SMOOTH IDLE.
&gt;
&gt; The leaking booster had created enough of a vacuum leak that there was no way 
&gt; to tune it to idle well. With the leak fixed, factory settings had purring. 
&gt; From what you described, that you are acutally loosing boost at idle, I would
&gt; suspect that your leak is far worse than the one I had. It may be bad enough
&gt; that it will cause your part throttle running to be way, way lean. It sounds
&gt; like this Haltech system gives you a lot of flexibility in mixture tuning
&gt; but it may still be wise to make sure that all the induction leaks are 
&gt; closed before investing a lot of time and effort in programming it. 
&gt;
&gt; An easy way to check whether the booster leak is affecting the idle is to 
&gt; plug the line at the intake manifold and see if you can tune it to a clean
&gt; idle that way. Also, it may not be the booster - There are several hoses and
&gt; connections that  may have rotted away and started leaking - fixing this may
&gt; not even cost you any $$.
&gt;
&gt; One other remark you made also concerned me. It sounded like you were running
&gt; an awful lot of ignition advance. I don't know what sort of distributor you
&gt; are running so the static or idle numbers may be misleading me. But if your
&gt; total advance, at about 3500 rpm, is exceeding 32 degrees or so it is an
&gt; indication that you are not getting good combustion. If you have to light the
&gt; fire that early to get good power it implies that the flame fronts are not 
&gt; spreading well. This can be caused by many things, including mixture that is
&gt; too rich, lack of turbulence in the combustion chamber, etc.. What kind of 
&gt; work was done on your heads for this engine build? Where did your compression
&gt; ratio end up? Is your distributor advance working correctly?
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I wish you good luck with this project and I, too, have enjoyed your
&gt; postings regarding it. BTW, I sent this to you privately so as not to air
&gt; your laundry publicly, if you want to post this to the list for other 
&gt; opinions, I don't mind.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hope it's still fun,
&gt;

Thanks Dave, it still is, and I don't mind either, anybody who wants to
smell my laundry can go right ahead, and since all the information you've
given is entirely relevant to the group I'm including it.

I agree that the booster is real suspect at this point, I've already been
through all other checks in the system, new hoses, new vacuum valve etc.  I
think the thing that clinches it is that as it's running now, if I am at a
stop light and just lightly touch the brakes, the boost holds and the engine
holds idle speed, but if I get heavier with the pedal, the boost breaks and
the idle climbs.  Strong indication the booster is gone, I have a spare from
my stripped bus and will get it in sometime real soon.  I have plugged the
lines and my idle problems are unrelated.

The heads are Berg 856 ported &amp; polished stock size heads with his
'semi-hemi' cut.  They are 58 cc's per cylinder.  I have a final CR ratio
of, as far as I can calculate, 7.19:1 and promise to use premium fuel only.
The dizzy is a stinger S4 auto-retard, the advance works fine.  If you are
unfamiliar with  Bergs recommendations on CR and timing you can get and read
his catalog.  I am within his guidelines for advance on a low-CR engine and
don't agree that 32 BTDC is the limit for advance for such an engine set-up.
My coolest engine is at 13 degrees BTDC with 6.8 CR and dual FRD Dellorto
carbs, 009 dizzy, it has great power, mileage and engine temps.  With my own
engine, I have to admit to being a bit surprised by how it runs with this
advance, but hey, power, pinging and engine temps are my guidelines and I've
not heard even a trace of ping so far, even when I had it up at 20.  I'm
holding at 15 degrees BTDC and am actually having difficulty supressing the
urge to advance to 18, mostly because when I was on the open road I think
the engine temps were slightly lower at 20.  Don't try this at home, this
engine is certainly way different than even a stock engine with low CR.  The
exhaust velocity is very strong, and with over 500 cc's moving through a
stock size valve, I'm sure I have incredible turbulence in the chamber,
something I had in mind from the beginning.

Engine temps have been different than other engines, this engine, with
properly working thermostat and flaps, comes up to 180 and has stayed there
on the freeway at 65-70 mph during midday.  Other engines without
thermostats have stayed around 150-160, and hit 200-210 on hard climbs into
the mountains.  I haven't had this one up into the mountains, or really
pushed it hard yet, it's not ready.  We'll see.........
