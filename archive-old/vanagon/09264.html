&gt; Ok, so now I am definitely in the lead for the geek of the week award!
&gt; 
&gt; I went barreling into the shop today, bitchin about how the tranny didn't
&gt; work and how I though I needed a new one, blah blah blah.  The owner and
&gt; I discussed the problem, which he said was 'cause I mis-installed the
&gt; nosecone and probly the real axles, too.  Taking it person, I sez I
&gt; didn't.  He even got the gut who owns the shop that did the tranny on the
&gt; phone and I talked to him.  He came to the same conclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; Turns out they were right.  One of the shift forks was down on the tranny.
&gt; And the right axle was not inside the fulcrum plates, but on top, which
&gt; might also explain why it leaked so bad.  
&gt; 
&gt; I started working on it at 6:00 tonight, and by 9:30 I had the engine and
&gt; tranny out, the nose cone fixed, and the axle fixed, awaiting cleanup and
&gt; reassembly.   I took the opportunity while everything was out of the car
&gt; to spray some more paint above where the tranny goes, and do some cleanup
&gt; and painting of the frame rails.  Its starting to look spiffy under there!
&gt; 
&gt; So tomorrow I go, hat in hand, foot in mouth, to buy this shop-dude a beer
&gt; or whatever.  Hopefully I'll have the whole mess put back together by tomorrow
&gt; night!
