Subject: Installing 1990 Folding Jump seat in '82

I just received a jump seat from Sorin Bejenaru from a 1990 Carat. Scary net
purchasing, eh?  I've had good luck so far....
Anyway, he usually checks his mail once a day, and since I'm home today and
hoping to do something with it, I thought I'd see if someone on the list could
help me.

The seat is the kind that folds up. It clips in the back of the seat to a
latch mechanism mounted on square tubing.  This square tubing is bolted to
something.  I assume that it's bolted to the box under the front seat.  Can
anyone describe how this all goes together?  It's not in Bentley.

Anyway, there are two pegs that presumably go in holes in the floor.  Do they
go in brackets on the top of the carpet, or are there holes in the carpet so
these pegs can go all the way down to the metal floor of the camper?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
