Hello there,

I recently got my hands on an engine from a 73 bus and was 
considering putting it in my 76 Westy.  I think the 73 engine is a 
1700 cc and is fitted with a single carb.  The engine looks and sounds 
great and I'm hoping it will replace my tired 2000cc in the 76 right 
now.  My questions to any one who would know are:

1.  First of all, will this engine fit okay in my 76?

2.  Is there any problem switching an engine setup from fuel injection 
to a carburetor?  If not then what all needs to be changed? ie. fuel 
pump

3.  Will there be any noticable difference in performance with the 
smaller engine.  And assuming that there might be, what about 
switching from single to dual carbs?

Any info/suggestions would be appreciated as I live waayyy up in 
Northern Alberta, Canada and resources are quite scarce.  You all are 
my life line up here !!  Thanks.
