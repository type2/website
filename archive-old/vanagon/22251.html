Subject: Free Bus?

                 If it looks too good to be true, it is!

I had hoped this would be the last in this series. Unfortunately, that
is not the case. It's the story of the free 1980 Vanagon to be towed
from Charleston SC to Indianapolis, IN with no engine.

We were supposed to go back to Charleston again to pick up the bus.
A friend of mine let me borrow a trailer that was supposed to be able to
handle the bus. He told me it was plenty big and heavy enough. So, we
headed out to Charleston on Thursday afternoon. We drove straight
through, 16.5 hrs. When one of us wasn't driving, he was sleeping.

We arrived at the site on Friday mid-afternoon. Let me tell you, it's
hotter than hell in Charleston in the summertime (not to mention
humid!). It started to rain big time as we drove into the parking lot
where the bus was waiting. It rained about 10 minutes, just long enough
to make it hot and steamy! We chained up the transmission to it wouldn't
bounce around on the way back. Pulled the Vanagon up onto the trailer, butt
first. It went on, with no problems, except there was no tongue weight, so
it had to come off, turn it around and put it back on. This time, there was
plenty of tongue weight. So it was on, and finally strapped down.

Everything was fine. We sat down to cool off, and upon looking at it, I
noticed there was almost no space between the tires and the fender. The
tires looked like they were ready to explode. We drove it across town to
the motel we were staying at, and anything over 35 mph made it fishtail
fiercly. We determined that it was seriously overweight. It was not
coming home on that trailer. So, after a call to Ryder, I found I could
rent just the trailer I needed for $250, but, then I had two
trailers,and only one vehicle. I tried to rent a car to pull the empty
trailer back, but no one rents cars with trailer hitches. I tried to
rent a bumper hitch to put on the back of the rental car, but no one
will rent a bumper hitch with out renting you a trailer first. The only
way I was going to pull this one off was to rent a truck and a trailer
to pull back one vehicle. It was going to cost $600 minimum.

After cooling off, and taking a shower, I found the piece of paper with all
the info I got from the Internet (you guys!), when my wife and I
went out there in June with the 2 brand new kitties to visit our
daughter. That's when I met Roger, (Roger Bellow and the Drifting
Troubadours, painted on the side of the Vanagon). He gave me the bus when
I bought a mandolin from him. The Internet information mentions a man named
Ken who was a VW guru that lived in North Charleston. I only had the first
name and a phone number. Don't remember who gave me this info, but I want to
thank you a bunch!! I called him. A woman answered. She didn't know anyone
named Ken and I had dialed the right phone number. So I looked in the phone
book under VW repair shops. Great Scott, there is Kenney's Import Repair
Service, right there in the book. Happily, I call Ken. Ken isn't there right
now. The lady tells me that Kenny doesn't work on VW's. I probably want Ken
Irwin. He owns the shop right across the street. She gives me the number. I
call this shop. Ken is there. I asked him about the phone number, he
says it's his, or was, a couple of years ago.

After explaining my situation to him, he tells me that the day before, a
guy brought in a 1979 bus for repairs. It's rusted out in the suspension
and steering areas. It's gonna cost $$500-600  to fix. This price was
too high for this guy, so Ken was going to purchase it from him and part
it out. This bus has a 2 liter motor with hydraulic lifters. It's
exactly the motor I need for the 1980 bus, hereafter referred to as
Roger. He says he can put the engine in Roger and redo the brakes for
under $1000. Considering it was going to cost me $600 to get it home and
then I'd still have to put a motor in it, I figured it was a $400 motor
and brake job. I told him to get with it. We brought Roger over to his
place the next morning and dropped it off. As we pulled into the
driveway to unload Roger, it started raining big time, for about 10
MINUTES, just enough to make it hot and steamy.  It occurred to me that
the only 2 times it rained on this whole trip was when we loaded and
unloaded the bus. Coincidence?

Ken is a devout follower of Brother Gene Berg. He will not half-ass
anything. He says if it's worth doing, do it right. I looked at his
shop, you could eat off his floors. Everything he had sitting around
after being repaired was clean and shiny. If a man takes enough pride in
his work to clean it spotless, he's good enough for me. I wrote him a
check for $500 to start things. When he's finished, he will take it to a
place called Jerolds tires, and outfit it for the drive back to Indy.
Rich Smith, my fellow CIVF member will be sharing the driving with me
back to Charleston to drive Roger home. Sometime around or after Labor
Day.

I've learned more about Charleston than I ever wanted to know. I know
where the brewpubs are, where the blues bars are, I know lots of tourist
areas, I know where those bars where women take off their clothes off
and dance (not that I've ever been in one!). I know where Ken's shop is.
If you are ever in Charleston and need repairs, here's the poop:
                   Carolina Bug Shop, Too
                   Kenn Erwin
                   1633 H. Remount Rd.
                   N. Charleston, SC
                   803-747-6001

If you want to know about any of the other places, just e-mail me!

I guess there will be another couple of parts to this story, at least.
One will be the return trip to drive Roger home, and if that goes well,
there will be the trip to Iowa City to pick up the interior. I'll keep
you informed of the progress.
