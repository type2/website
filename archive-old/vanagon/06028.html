&gt; To be considerate, I take lightly traveled trails.  Sometimes I pass

&gt; the bell shoots straight up into the ceiling.

Ah, therein lies the virtue of the roof hatch of the Westfalia!  I
crank mine wide open (or as wide open as it goes), point my
euphonium (which is a tenor tuba) in that direction, and it
works great, except when it's raining.

Hmmm... that makes at least three brass players (Harold, Grungy,
and myself) on the Vanagon list...
