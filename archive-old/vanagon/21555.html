Subject: Re: New Carb


&gt;	I have another carb I'm gonna rebuild, that I got at the junkyard, but
&gt;I noticed that it has a lot of play in the throttle shaft, so I may 
&gt;finish it and pawn it off on someone else....

Thom,

Flipping through my Schley tools catalog last night I noticed they sell a
kit to replace the bushing on the throttle shaft for Solex carbs.  I think
it comes with a drill bit and an assortment of bushings.  If you or anyone
is interested let me know and I'll give some more details.  The Schley kit
is probably overkill (and overpriced)--probably only saves you the time of
looking for the right drill bit and bushings.
