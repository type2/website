&gt; Have you tried the time-honoured  50 watt bulb in the engine compartment
&gt; trick ?- this works well with any engine but is especially good for
Hi David,
Feeding the baby!  That's warm!
Actually, the light bulb idea is ok, but I don't have the problem close to
electricity.  Where I am concerned about not being able to start my vanagon
is in say the following situation:  I have just driven it to Bear Tooth
Pass (high, remote, and closed lots of the year).  The next morning, I wake
up and it is say 20 below outside the camper and the Coors is almost finished.
It is under this type of circumstance that I'd really want to have an external
propane heater.  I will probably go for an old propane torch, I think.
Stuart
