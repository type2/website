Subject: EV raving: first time towing a trailer


Well,

since our movers conveniently forgot to take some of our stuff
from our old home in Bethlehem, PA to our new place in Pittsburgh,
I got to convince my wife that the EV needed a trailer hitch.

After $240.00 and one trip to the local shop, the EV had a
10,000 pound hitch on it (the local VW dealer said they could not
even get the part, so I used another place right across from them,
who had no problem getting a non-VW hitch, but still made for the
EV).

We rented a 5x8 U-Haul trailer -- the kind they have that is one
size smaller than the biggest: the double-axle, 6x12 kind.  I was
trying to be conservative about size, just in case.  On the way
to Bethlehem, It was even hard to notice any difference in handling
(maybe some in braking).  On the way back, the trailer and the van
were completely full (two kids, a 115-lb yellow Lab, my wife and
myself, as well as items such as shelves, books, and an extra
middle seat for a vanagon that I had in the shed went into the
van.  othe items such as a wood chipper, lawn mover, 6 steel office
chairs, dressers, more heavy stuff went into the trailer, packing
it up to its gills).  The 320-mile journey was uneventful.  The EV
handled just fine, no fishtailing, no swaying.  Braking was
noticeably weaker, so I had to compensate for that.  I did shift into
4th uphills, mostly as a precaution, the EV was doing fine and keeping
up 65 mph even in the fifth gear.  The fuel comsumption went way up:
16 mpg on the return leg of the trip.

....Next time I'm inventing a reason to rent a 6x12 trailer :-)
