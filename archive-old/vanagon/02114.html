re DC's ideas

didnt take it as a flame at  all DC :-)

i guess i was reacting to my mbox this am - 50 posts mostly about
'da trip' which (being one of the 20 or so interested) made me feel like
we were overusing the bandwidth of the 170 others on the list. 
Maybe they want to hear about it - i dont know, so i was raising the possibilty
that we should give them bandwidth back. If no objections then we can 
carry on  :-)

Agree that if you set off on such a trip without a fan belt then you
deserve what happens to you - but if one of us brings a master cylinder,
and one a clutch master cylinder, one a slave cylinder and the like we
could accumulate these and make a breakdown almost as pleasurable as it 
can get!  You pay for what you use.  Being in the business world i was
envisioning getting a decent parts store to &quot;loan&quot; us some parts to take
around the country - if you get a mail order business my bet is you can
(one with golden tongue) talk them into this as advertising. Again whatever
you use you pay for. 

sorry you didnt get any help on your tech requests from others if you want to
try me i'll tell you the little i know about whatever

sps
