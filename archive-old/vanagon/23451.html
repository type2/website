I have to admit to mixed feelings about this.  I absolutely agree with Steve
about this, but I do hate to see a new ding on my beautiful van, but I don't
want to be like those 4x4 owners who hate getting their car muddy (Hi
Brian!).  Yet I *do* wash and wax Beethoven religiously.  (I even took off
the luggage rack and cleaned out a ton of crap.  How do those things get IN
there?)

So I'm going on the Inuvik trip, though it will probably put several years
on my van... I bought this dream car of mine to get OUT, not to look at and
sigh.  Inuvik might add several hundred chips to the paint, but my van will
be doing what it was born to do... fly through the wilderness and provide me
with a warm bed at night.
