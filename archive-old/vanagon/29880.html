Subject: battery/EGR lights (77 camper)

What does it mean when the battery and EGR light come on together when my 
camper is in motion? The manual said to check the fuses and the fan belt, 
which look ok. The generator was replaced about two years ago, so I don't 
suspect that. (Maybe I should?) The manual also mentions something about 
the EGR light coming on every 15K as a reminder to bring it in for 
periodic maintanence, something I haven't heard about before (the light,  
not the maintenance).
