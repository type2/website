Subject: True Story Time?

Funny how stories change in transit. I heard that one in Florida in 1991, 
but it was a $50 Corvette...He was in the bahamas with his new girlfriend 
too. Urban legends...go figure.

&gt; well ... True Story Time: :)
&gt; one day at work, back in about 1979, the manager of the Customer Engineers
&gt; comes in, all pissed off at the world. seems that he had seen an ad in the
&gt; paper the previous day, and thought it was a joke:
&gt; &quot;Mercedes-Benz, 4-door, like new, $100.&quot; yeah, right. well, that's what he
&gt; thought, too. so he ignored it.
&gt; 
&gt; he gets home the previous evening and sees the teenage kid next door washing
&gt; and waxing a big Mercedes. so he walks over, and asks if the kid's dad got a
&gt; new car. &quot;nope. this is mine!&quot;, says the kid. big smile. BIG smile. seems the
&gt; kid was too stupid to know a joke when he saw one, so he called the phone
&gt; number in the ad, went to see the car, and bought a 500E for $100. that's
&gt; ONE HUNDRED dollars, folks. actually, he had to get his dad to sign the
&gt; papers, cause the kid was not old enough (under alabama law).
&gt; 
&gt; it seems that the lady selling it gave this story: her husband had sent her
&gt; a telegram, from Bermuda, where he and his secretary were frolicing. the
&gt; telegram said he wanted a divorce, and she (wife; seller of Mercedes) should
&gt; keep the house, and sell the car and send him half. so she did.
&gt; 
&gt; there are TWO morals in this story, if you look hard enough.    :)
