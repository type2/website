Subject: gotta blow my own horn

 Hi all: I just recieved My December issue of Hot VWs in the mail. On page
78  there is a article about the new transaxle I have been building parts
for. There are a few shots of the differential,bearing carriers, and drive
flanges that I turn out. The tranny is a very good piece. Mike Mendeola did
a great job designing it. There is a good picture of the finished tranny, it
looks great! If you want to put some big horsepower into your bus this
tranny will handle it. The only thing is it will take a mighty big shoehorn
to make it fit. If you have a few minutes check it out.
