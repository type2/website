Subject: Re: Buses on the Blue Ridge II

&gt; Just a reminder to everyone that Friday May 31 thru Sunday June 2 the
&gt; Appalachian Split Screens, a NC NEATO chapter, will be hosting Buses
&gt; on the Blue Ridge II.  It is held at Mt. Pisgah campground on the
&gt; Blue Ridge Parkway just outside Asheville, NC.  It was a really nice
&gt; gathering last year and I highly recommend it.  Call Neil Pickett at
&gt; (704) 665-1650 for more details.
&gt;
&gt; There is a link to a site with the map in the Coming Events area of
&gt; the NEATO web page at:  http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html

I will also be there, in my red, white, and blue '67 pop-top. We are leaving
from there to go out west, to points unknown. I hope to meet a lot of folks
there, so stop by if you make it!
