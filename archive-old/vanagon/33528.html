Subject: Re: Value of 66 Kombi as scrap

I got a couple of Busses that will face this fate soon.  I might use the 
cab of the '67 as a phone booth in the basement (not sure I can get it 
throught the door tho'.   BTW, what is the going price for Deluxe sunroof 
Bus tops?  The 23-window is so rusty down low that it will probably go to 
pieces (or I could hold on to it long enough to sell it to Thom for a few 
grand). ;-)
