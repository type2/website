Hi,

	Maybe you guys can talk me out of this.
	
	I've had a lead on a '54 Deluxe for about 6 months now.  I'm still
debating it, tho...

	It has a good percentage of the glass still there, some rust, is beat 
up a bit, had one of the engine vents cut out up to the window, has a front
bumper but its tweeked a bit.  It also has the wrong nose on it - the nose has
nipple lights.

	This is all I know from pix.  I have only seen pix of the passenger
side - its in a garage, so they can't get to the other side.

	Its $3500 delivered to my door.  Should I? Or should I not?

Thom
