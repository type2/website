&gt; Shawn,
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with your diagnosis of bad electical connections, especially since the
&gt; van has been sitting for over a year.  Corrosion on the connectors might cause
&gt; behavior like this, I would  think, but I wondering if this would depend on
&gt; engine temperature, since it only misfires when hot. Does that make sense?
&gt; 
Charles,

Elecrtical connections can be very temp sensitive - for example I 
have had ethernet cables which work fine when cool, but fail after 4-
6 hrs of use &amp; subsequent ambient temperature change. Cutting open 
the cables uncovered very small cracks in the solid core wire which 
had become brittle with age.

After just fixing the speaker &amp; power mirror wires in my driver's 
door, I was amazed how the VW wires fall apart inside, but look 
fine on the outside. I'd check all connectors in the engine area, 
then move on to those wires subject flexing with engine vibrations. 
It is quite likely that some of them may be cracked inside, causing 
an error condition in the ECU, which is then reset by cutting the 
power.
