Subject: WTB  Amazonas VW powered motorcycle

does anybody know of an unfinished/ finished imported-from-Brazil VW type 1
powered kit motorcycle called the Amazonas?  I am looking to buy one.
 Perhaps one that was imported, assembled, run to death, and parked awaiting
resurrection?  Perhaps one that was imported and never assembled?  Perhaps
blue-prints for such a beast?  Or one that I can &quot;look over&quot; so that I can
build my own.  I know that it used a Beetle engine, Beetle tranny with the
spider gears welded, a sprocket on one of the tranny drive flanges, and all
kinds of bizarre hardware to adapt the shifter &amp; clutch to motorcycle
controls.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanking all in advance...
