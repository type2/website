1961 vw pickup (single bench seat not the crew cab).  This is  a classic.
It=B9s not running  and has some rust.  I rebuilt the engine about 18 years
ago and drove it less than 100 miles. It has sat outside side since then.
This puppy needs the right person to restore it but realize that it is a
project.  Or it could be parted out. I=B9m asking $400.00.=20
email me or call 916-477-7121.
