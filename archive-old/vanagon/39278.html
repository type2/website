Subject:      eastern PA westy FS

Community at large,

Instead of finding the coveted mud falps for my { wifes } vanagon I
instead found an  '82 air cooled westy in fine shape for $2500.00.
My contact at L&amp;T Enterprizes in Allentown, PA has indicated that it
does have a little dent on the front passenger side,  but other than
that it is ready to be jettisoned into the great camping unknown!
This outfit also has an early aircooled vanagon that had been sitting
at a dealer since '89 lacking an ECU.  New ECU, and off she flew!  It
will be ready for sale shortly.

So just call L&amp;T Enterprizes at (610) 264 9191 and ask for Gary,
tell him you got the info from the net.

BTW,  is anyone interested in a caravan this summer to the legendary
Beckys' Drive In outside of Allentown?  Its all grass and nestled in
the woods and real cheap...the flick should be family orientated
though,  my five year old is bored easily,  a bad family trait.
