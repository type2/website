     Yes, yes, yes, always buy used stuff that never wears out.  Just make 
     sure you buy from a junkyard that will exchange stuff if its bad.

During this weekend's snow storm, my wife was going around a 
corner and the rear end slid out and the wheel banged against 
a curb. It bent the rim so the wheel needs to be replaced. 
     
I found one at a local junkyard for $35. 
     
Two questions: Is this a reasonable price? Are used wheels generally 
&quot;safe&quot; to purchase?
     
Thanks in advance.
     
Oh, if anyone has an extra wheel they want to get rid of, let 
me know.
