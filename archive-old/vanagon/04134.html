Subject:      for all the New People: bosch fuel injection info

sometime back in this summer, i put out a bunch of data from a bosch fuel
injection catalog (gasoline AND diesel). most everybody has it, but there
have been quite a few new folks added on, so if you guys did NOT get it,
and want it, there are two ways to get it:

- i can send it to you (if you let me now you want it, AND which year bus
you have).
- you can 'gopher' in to halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu and look in Miscellaneous/Vanagon
(where all the other stuff about/from the list is).

the categories are:
diesel (1981-1983)
gasoline (1993 eurovan,
          1991-1986 vanagon (digifant),
          1985-1983 vanagon (digijet),
          1983-1980 vanagon (air-cooled),
          1979-1974 buses)

other folks: sorry, bosch didn't make any carburetors. :(  and i don't have
a current/newer copy of their fuel/etc. filter catalog.
