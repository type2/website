&gt; How to Replace the Fuel Valve Cable
&gt; 
&gt; by Thom Fitzpatrick
&gt; 
&gt; On busses to about 63 or so, there was a pull cable located in front
&gt; of the seat to operate the reserve fuel valve.  This valve is a work
&gt; around for not having a gas tank.

Wow!  If I get one of these, could I get rid of my gas tank too?  I
could use the extra storage, and think of the money it would save!  :P
