&gt;Mail*Link=AE SMTP               FWD&gt;reindeers (fwd) - As science sees=
 them...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help=
 from
&gt;that renown scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - I am pleased=
 to
&gt;present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;1)  No known species of reindeer can fly.  BUT there are 300,000 species of
&gt;living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects
&gt;and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only=
 Santa
&gt;has ever seen.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;2)  There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.
&gt;BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and
&gt;Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378
&gt;million according to Population Reference Bureau.  At an average (census)
&gt;rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.  One=
 presumes
&gt;there's at least one good child in each.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;3)  Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different
&gt;time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west
&gt;(which seems logical).  This works out to 822.6 visits per second.
&gt;This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa
&gt;has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the
&gt;chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the
&gt;tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back
&gt;into the sleigh and move on to the next house.  Assuming that each of these
&gt;91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of=
 course,
&gt;we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will=
 accept),
&gt;we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2
&gt;million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least=
 once
&gt;every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000
&gt;times the speed of sound.  For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-=
 made
&gt;vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per
&gt;second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;4)  The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.  Assuming
&gt;that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds),
&gt;the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably
&gt;described as overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more
&gt;than 300 pounds.  Even granting that &quot;flying reindeer&quot; (see point #1) could
&gt;pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even
&gt;
&gt;nine.  We need 214,200 reindeer.  This increases the payload - not even
&gt;counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons.
&gt;Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen=
 Elizabeth.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;5)  353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air
&gt;resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as
&gt;spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  The lead pair of reindeer
&gt;will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  In=
 short,
&gt;they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer
&gt;behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.
&gt;The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a
&gt;second.  Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces=
 17,500.06
&gt;times greater than gravity.  A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously=
 slim)
&gt;would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.
&gt;=20
&gt;
&gt;In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's
&gt;dead now.
