Subject: Re: Collapsing Westy Tents

David,

My advice to you is not to open the bag. Sometimes deadly bacteria can grow in 
there, which, if left untreated, can force you to hate VWs, cause you to give 
away all your worldly posessions, and cause you to run *nekkid* through the 
streets. Send the bag directly to me - I'll take care of it for you. ;&gt;

Seriously...want to sell it?

&gt; What is a westy tent? What? You don't know what a westy tent is? No, I got
&gt; an 83 westy but don't know what you guys are talking about the tent. Did it
&gt; come with your westy or did you pay extra to get it?
&gt; 
&gt; I got my 83 westy from a buddy who got a job as a VP overseas so had to quit
&gt; all his cars and move out. He gave me a large cloth bag and said it's a 
&gt; camping
&gt; tent inside. I have never had a chance to open it up and see what it is yet.
&gt; Now all the messages on this net wanting a westy tent has gotten me curious.
&gt; So what is a westy tent? I am going to go home to find out if I got one too.
&gt; Thanks.
