Subject: halfmoons and stars- fixing windshield cracks
Date: Thu, 29 Jun 95 13:14:45 EDT

Yikes! On our way back through Buffalo I picked up a couple of Loctite
&quot;Bullseye&quot; windshield repair kits. I tried them out on a couple of
&quot;halfmoon&quot; looking cracks in the windshield. The syringe-looking device
affixes to
the windshield and fluid is injected into the cracks. Applying pressure
created more cracks and they now appear to be lengthening over time. One
is &quot;star-like&quot; while the other is a straight line. What can I do short of
replacing the windshield?

I have heard the following and seek advice on this strategy: drill two
small holes at each end of the cracks and inject with crazy glue. Has
anyone tried this? Are there alternatives that work?

I am less concerned about the view out the windshield (because they are
not line of sight) and more concerned about the windshield cracking under
pressure while driving. Its an 82 Westfalia and the cracks were there when I
bought the van. It passed the MOT roadworthiness test because 
line of sight was not an issue.


PS Our insurance policy will cover the cost of replacement save 50
deductible. I would rather not have this done because of the way the
windshield is affixed to the frame. A less than competent job could result
in leaks.


Thanks in advance - David C.
