Subject: anyone in albany ny area?


Are there any van-list people in the Albany NY area who can
give me the short form line on mechanics and dealers in this
area? Wife (the real $-winner in the familial unit) is making me drag
my business there, told her &quot;No good VW scene, no move :-)&quot;

(Like Ithaca has VW-fests every day ......)

Of course her reply was &quot;No $, get that d*** 64 KG out of my driveway&quot;)

tia!
