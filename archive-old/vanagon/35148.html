Subject: Applies to other things as well!

	As Jean and I were finishing up the side marker light, 
Ken Miller came over with his son Patrick (14 months) and observed.
Ken owned a late bay-window and his family now has an EV, Fox wagon and
'74 Super Beetle. I mentioned that working on the side marker was just 
like what Jean wanted to do in re-wiring the lamp in the living room, 
and Ken observed  that it was similar, but to really be correct, we 
should put a big cardboard box on the floor and put the lamp inside the 
box and then kneel on the  floor with our upper bodies inside the box 
to do the work! :)

	Bill
