&lt;&lt; What do you'all think my Westfalia is worth?

 '82 diesel Westy
 Ivory with green/brown interior
 2nd owner, mom was the 1st
 35k miles, even has original tires
 practically flawless condition, 1-2 door dings
 sink, fridge, etc
 everything works perfectly, even the fridge
 all maintenance records, including bill of sale
 starts easy, no smoke

 What do you think? &gt;&gt;

I'd say (east coast) around 3 grand because of the low mileage and good cond.
negatives, cuz it's a DIEsel.
