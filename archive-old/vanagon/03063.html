I don't know if wasserboxers have oil coolers or not.  They may not need 
them because they use water for cooling just as most american cars do.  Most 
water
cooled cars do not use oil coolers.  I read a book by Anderson on 911 
performance
modifications.  He describes the 911 as an air cooled engine that, as HP and 

emission controls increased, became more of an air/oil cooled engine.  From
about '74 the Porsches had two oil coolers; one close to the engine and one 
mounted in either the fender well or in the front of the car.  Flow to the 
coolers is
thermostatically controlled.  Allows flow thru the coolers at about 180 F. 
 Porsche
also added oil squirters aimed at the under side of the pistons to improve 
piston
cooling.

Anyway, I  reread Gene Bergs comment on Synthetic oil and his claim is that 
the
oil flow helps remove heat from the cyl. heads.  When he used synthetic oil 
his
measurements showed that the oil temp was lower and the head temp higher 
than
when he used regular dino oil.
