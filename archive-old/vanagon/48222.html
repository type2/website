Hi There,

I am finally getting around to announcing a new addition to our family.  Our 
daughter (first) was born on July 30, 1996 at 12:30 pm.  Her name is Kyla 
Isobel and she loves to ride in the van.  We look forward to many enjoyable 
camping trips.  Gotta start getting her accustomed to long trips.

I have applied for a sleep deprevation study at the Univeristy of Alberta.  
Might as well get paid while I am awake!!!   :-)

Beaming with happiness,

Tony and Odette and Kyla
