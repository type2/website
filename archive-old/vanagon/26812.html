Subject: Re: Anyone have...(71 Bus frt emblem fasteners)

I still have the fasteners (the little plastic clips) on the front of my 
72 (upright engine) bus but I didn't have an emblem. I got an emblem from 
an earlier bus which had little metal posts. I drilled holes in the plastic clips and inserted the posts. 

Works fine for me but I don't know if it will help you.
