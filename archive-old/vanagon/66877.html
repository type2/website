&gt; Subject: O2 mixture questions
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I have several questions when it comes to adjusting my mixture using the
&gt; oxygen sensor.
&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt;     1. Do I have to disconnect the sensor with the engine off?  The
&gt;            computer will have a memory if I don't.  Does it matter?  Can I
&gt;            leave the sensor connected to the computer to read the voltage?
&gt;            [snip]

&gt; You should be able to set your mixture just fine while
&gt; connecting/disconnecting 02 sensor while engine is running.

&gt; Questions/comments?
&gt; Rick Sherrod

The Bentley (and others) are very definite about having the ignition OFF
when connecting/disconnecting the O2 sensor, not that that means they're
necessarily right.  How are you so positive that it's OK to
connect/disconnect the O2 sensor with the engine on?
