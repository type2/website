&gt; I have been contemplating switching my '71 to a 20-50W synthetic
&gt; engine oil. The engine (1835) has about 25,000 miles on it. I have
&gt; a full flow filter and cooler system. Any thoughts would be appreciated...

Scott,
Go for it!  I used synthetic oil in my 71 Super Bug when the ex drove it
for 15 miles on no oil at all (blew a cooler hose).  I swear by the
stuff.  BTW she did trash the engine but 15 mile is a long way to go
before it's toast.
