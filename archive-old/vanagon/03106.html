&gt;Is anyone familiar with the ASI camper conversion?  I'm in the market for
&gt;air-cooled Vanagon Westfalia and happened upon an '80 Vanagon with the ASI
&gt;conversion.  Anyone care to compare and contrast the two?  Thanx!
&gt;

I've seen a couple of these in my quest for a Van. (I ended up buying a VSI
conversion btw. These are extremely similar.)
Now that I've had to do some work on it, I must admit that
it would be nice to have a manual for all the stuff they did, as I would have
if it were a Westfalia. Instead, I have to string wires from the engine
compartment to the dash while attempting to determine what's connected to
what.

There are different configurations of ASI conversions, one I was
looking at did not have propane - hence no stove and a &quot;cooler&quot; instead of a
fridge. But a friend at work has an 80 w ASI conversion that does have
propane, and he likes his a lot.

In general, the ASI and VSI has a bigger cabinet behind the drivers seat,
so you can have a much larger fridge, and a little bit more of counter
space.  There seems to be more storage space in the back in the ASI/VSI
also. And the Westfalia
has a foldout table rather than one that mounts in the floor.

I was told by the owner of the ASI that the company was no longer in
business, but I didn't actually confirm this. It's probably worth a call to
Vancouver WA directory assistance just to see.

Hope this helps.
Rick
