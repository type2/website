Subject: starter help needed

Hey all,
Paul Wies ('79 bus) is having a bit of trouble.  He bought a rebuilt
Bosch starter to cure his non-starting blues (turn key, lights dim but
nothing happens out back).  He put in his new starter and now when he
turns the key to start he hears a click but still nothing happens.  I
told him to do the usual checks but something he said struck me as
weird.

He said that the fuel injection connections on his new starter are
different than on the old one.  Is it possible that someone sold him the
wrong starter for his vehicle and this is causing problems?

His ignition switch is also somewhat suspect.  We'll know more about
that tomorrow.

I'm writing on behalf of Paul as he's on Easter break and doesn't have
vanagon_at_lenti access.

Any thoughts?

Sean
