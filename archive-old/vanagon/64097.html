Subject: rear bumper with receiver

I put a picture on my website of the rear bumper we had made for our '81.
It incorporates a 2&quot; receiver.  A local welder made it for $140.  I painted
it silver, but could have had it chromed for an additional $100.

When you get to my home page (address below) just scroll down a bit and you
will see the link to the Volks page.
