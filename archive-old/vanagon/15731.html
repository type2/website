Subject: Re: Westfalia rental

&gt;&gt;This is a message for anyone living in the San Diego or Bay Area. Do you
&gt;&gt;have a phone number to contact a Westfalia rental place? We would be
&gt;&gt;needing one for about a week. Thanks in advance - David Carment
&gt;
&gt;I'm also interested in a Westfalia rental in the Bay Area.  Dan and I are
&gt;going up to Crater Lake for a romantic weekend, and I'd love to take a
&gt;Camper.  (Which I hope to own someday.)
