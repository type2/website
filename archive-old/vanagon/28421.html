&gt; &gt; So, can anyone tell me when European busses ceased to have 
&gt; &gt; semaphores.  I saw a green kombi with the same taillights as my '57, 
&gt; &gt; but not turn signals, and I couldn't see any semaphores by the doors.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Odd!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I'll guess that they stopped the same year as the bugs--1960

  Semaphores were used on Euro buses to 1960.   From march55 till then they
came with single filament glass taillight with crome bezel.   Hm, actually
i'm not sure about the taillights - from mid 57 they must have been dual
filament for brake and running lights.   Through 63 they had the cone turn
signals ( or nipples for those who want to eroticise the sexy breadloaf )(or
bullets for those fascinated with guns and violence, aren't old buses scary?)
( there's too much sax and violins on TV today) and the round glass taillight
with separate chrome ring, as per US 58-61 buses.  By the way, the 62
Frickinger hearse has cone turn signals.
