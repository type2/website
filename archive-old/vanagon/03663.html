&gt; Just tried to remove the old exhaust system from my 75 bus, but --as
&gt; usual-- got stuck on trivial and not very exciting problems, such as
&gt; unscrewing rusted bolts. I'm talking about the six bolts that hold the
&gt; exhaust system to the heater boxes, so 3 bolts on each side. I can't get a
&gt; grip on them: the 12mm wrench is too large and the 11mm wrench is too
&gt; small. Tried using a vice-grip but it slips off. 

First, run-don't-walk to your nearest Chrysler/Dodge dealer and buy a can
of Mopar Heat Valve Penetrant.  It is absolutely undeniably the *best*
solvent anywhere for loosening rusted parts.

As for getting a grip on the bolts, try either a) a non-metric wrench set,
or  b) one of those wrenches that tightens as you put pressure on it.

Good luck,
