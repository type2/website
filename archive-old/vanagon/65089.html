Subject:      HELP! Windshield needed

Hey all,
OK, today I broke the windshield (rather dramatically) while finishing
installation of my oil temperature gauge (don't ask).

The van is an '81 Vanagon Westy, and I imagine all Vanagon windshields
are fair game, I don't think they changed sizes through the years.

So, if anyone (very preferably in the D.C./northern VA metro area) has a
Vanagon windshield lying around that they might want to part with,
please let me know who, where, and how much.  Mine is now quite bad and
it's definitely not going to get any better.

Thanks to all,
Sean
