Subject: '90 Syncro Align. Woes/Springs

HI Everyone.  I put on some new tires on Friday (Yokohama Y370 
LT195/75R14), and had the wheels aligned on the van yesterday.  My
dealer has a new Hunter alignment machine (purchased new at the 
beginning of this year).

The front end is well within specs (camber, caster, and toe).  The 
rear is out, and can no longer be adjusted as the eccentric bolt that 
adjusts camber is at maximum adjustment.

The readings are as follows:

left rear   right rear
-0 30'         -1 00'

the figures are:  negative 30 minutes, and negative 1 degree for the 
right rear.

the specs should be:

-0 25' to +0 15'      

Now this will wear one side of the tire more than the other.  I took 
the van in mostly loaded (representing how we always drive it).  It 
was just missing water and us.  

My dealer said this isn't too bad, and the cure would be to replace 
the rear springs.  The springs are just under $1100 CDN... parts 
only!!

Can anyone confirm in Vanagon land that the rear springs 
would effect camber like this?  Does the Syncro have it's own rear 
springs or do they share with the 2WD vans?

Any advice would be appreciated.
Harry.
