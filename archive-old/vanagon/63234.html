Subject:      84 Westy

Greetings all!

I'm looking at an 84 Westy with 70,000 miles (service records verify this).
It appears to be in pretty good shape -- minor dings here and there -- needs
a windshield, spigot for sink (owner says $30) -- there is a very slight
amount of rust along a seam at RR.  Front table is absent, but otherwise
everything looks preety good.  Oh yes -- he claims refrig. works on AC and
DC, but hasn't tried propane.  Hasn't tried stove either...
Owner asks $8995, but will negotiate...
Anybody have a feel for the value of this vehicle??
Any help would really be appreciated.
