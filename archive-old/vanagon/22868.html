Subject: Fuel Stabilizer problems

        I am new to the list as well as a new Westfalia (Westy) owner, so I
am not certain if the problem I have had is a simple one, a rare one or a
settled one, but I would appreciate any comments.  It goes like this:

I have a 1980 Westy, all electronic fuel everything--my first, so I am not
too familiar with the technology. I recently went on a 4000 mile trip from
LA to Olga, Washington (5 bucks to anyone who can tell me where it
is--washington residents disqualified).  Prior to the trip I had the bottom
end of the engine rebuilt--all the rings, rods, pistons, seals, etc.  My
heads, at the time, looked good.  So I had no problems until I reached
Portland two weeks later and felt I should get a check up--that I just
didn't have quite the power I used to have, and it didn't start right
up--usually it took three tries--so I had it looked at.  Sure enough, I had
low compression in two cylinders.  I replaced one head, had the other
valves re-torqued or something and had a large piece of the floorpan that
was missing replaced and off I went.  Just south of Mt. Shasta, coming down
a grade and without any warning, I began losing power--it was as if
suddenly the engine was starving from fuel.  I would try to give it gas and
it would choke terribly but if I took my foot off the gas it would idle
just fine.  Long story short I put in a new fuel pump (not the problem) and
a new fuel filter (not the problem either).  I had little help from the
local AAA, Dwights in Dunsmuir.  If you are ever in the area and find
yourself in his crazy, vast automobile graveyard, leave as soon as
possible--even if you need to tow to  Redding.  I checked all my electronic
connections again and in a reflexive move began spraying WD40 on every one
of them.  Something worked and that something was not mentioned in my
manual.  It was a part that had two electronic inputs and mounts near on
the left side wall as you look at the engine.  Later I was told it was
called a Fuel stabilizer and this lumpy piece of plastic did nothing but
ruin the last 7 days of my trip.  No one had one for sale and there were no
VW dealers in any of the cities we ran through.  So every 100 miles or so I
rested the van--not a bad idea anyway in 105 degree heat--since the longer
I ran it the more it seemed to act up.  I would take it off, spray the
bejeezus out of it and put it back together.  Don't laugh.  It worked.
About 200 miles outside of LA it ceased to be a problem any longer.  Not a
peep.  I am very suspicious about it though.  I got a smog check today and
asked the guy if he knew anything about that jobber.  It's a Fuel
Stabilizer, he said.  I told him about my problems and he said that's the
problem and it happens often, and gave me a new one he happened to have in
his toolbox.  Why didn't any of the other mechanics, including VW, offer
that as a solution along the way?  Are they morons or do I distrust this
smog check mechanics sage advice?  Anyone else know about this damn things
or do you have any advice on other things to look for?  TIA, one and all
and remember--Dwight is a bad person.
