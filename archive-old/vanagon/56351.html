Subject: Westy Tire Pressures?
From: Joseph Doniach &lt;jdoniach_at_pacbell_dot_net&gt;


I just bought a set of reinforced Michelin X tires for my 86 Westfalia. The
max tire pressure is 40 psi, yet the sticker on the door calls for 48 psi in
the rear tires. The dealer (Wheelworks, a large chain in the SF Bay Area)
insists that they are the correct tires. What's going on here?
