&gt; First entry - my first van (previous experiance w/ a super beetle)
&gt;  
&gt; First trip - mid-may out of Boulder (very high van per capita).
&gt; temp guage past 230 goin' up hwy 285 into the rockies - first stop.
&gt; turned around and tried the pueblo entrance into the arkansas valley
&gt; and on to the sand dunes.
&gt;  
&gt; Toas's only real vw mechanic (no sign, just lots o vans) said 250 is
&gt; fine - it has to be w/ most vanagons at high temps and altitude -
&gt; and max 270 if top of pass is in sight.  We stuck to the 250 rule and
&gt; pulled over again after our 2nd hot springs dip.
&gt; Made it across the desert in mid day (114 degrees in the van w/ windows up-
&gt; cuts the drag) while other VWs were left on the side of the road.
&gt;  
&gt; 

Are these temps oil temperature or head temperature? They seem high for
oil and low for head.... -- DC
