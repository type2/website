Subject: First oil change

Hi, everybody!

For those of you out there who bought your vehicles new, when did you do
your first oil change?  After 1K miles, 3K, 5K,...or the VW recommended
7.5K?

I ask because the dealer salesperson backed up VW's recommendation of 7.5K,
citing the need for various engine seals to seat and absorb whatever oil
necessary to prevent leakage later on (this guy was an enthusiast, too).

Conventional wisdom says to change the oil every 3K or so (or 50-60 engine
hours), except a lot of folks do their first change at 1K because of 
various metallic bits floating around...

So what do you all think?

TIA
Norman
