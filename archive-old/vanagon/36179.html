Subject: Re: Syncro Mudflaps Trivia


to install mudflaps to protect the side of my syncro (no worries about a 
propane tank on my vehicle) I went to trak auto and bought the cheapest 
flaps available that looked configured properly:  good width and long 
length.  They were just sheets of black plastic.  The screws that came with 
the set looked like drywall screws.  I mounted the flaps almost as low as 
they would go and drove the screws thru the flap and into the little black 
plastic fender well thingies on my van.   Then I filed down the pointy end 
length of screw sticking out of the black plastic fender thingies.  With 
this setup there is only about a 3-4 inch high bow of spray starting well 
back from the wheel well on the sides of my van.  This means the flaps could 
actually be a bit lower, but it does much, much better than no flaps.  It 
also helps to greatly reduce the buildup of ice boulders behind the wheel 
well.
No flaps on the rear cause I haven't noticed all that much spray/grunge 
accumulation.

|The Westies I've seen have a (fairly) big mudflap just behind the drivers 
side
|front wheel well. This is to protect the propane tanks which is
|just behind. The one big mudflap easily falls off (at least mine seem
|to). Maybe the PO added the two front mudflaps on your Westy, but
|didn't bother with the back.
|
|I've added small mudflaps to all 4 wheel wells, but they are not
|nearly sufficient. Harry Yates has some info on how he made better
|ones on his web page. Ideally the wheel wells should be a little
|wider, so the tire is completely *inside* of it. Even with my narrow
|tires (195/75R14) and mudflaps, the sides of the bus get sprayed. Is there
|some kind of after market modification kit to widen the wheel wells?
|
|/Martin (and '82 Westy, which got all the mud washed off today and
|a shiny coat of wax, while the neighbours Lumina was jelously watching.)
|
|PS What do you use to wax your pop top? I have been using regular car wax.
