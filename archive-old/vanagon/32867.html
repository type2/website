&gt; &gt; This morning while donning a freshly laundered pair of levis I noticed that
&gt; &gt; they fit -- no belt required.  During the Grendel Episode I lost so much
&gt; &gt; weight I had to move my belt over four holes.  Since then my levis have had
&gt; &gt; plenty of room around the waist.  
&gt; 
&gt; Where can _I_ get a Grendel?

Umm... Thom... I think you have your work cut out for you... ;)

As you-all know, I was over at Thom's last Saturday getting a real
eye-full of his recently acquired '54 Deluxe Barndoor.  From 3 feet
up it looks rather well.  Thom is one of the few on this list that
I feel can come through on a project of this magnitude.  And yes,
it was rather enjoyable to catch Thom off guard with a question
referring to the passenger side of his 'right-hand-drive' vehicle.
Especially in front of his SO (Amy).  ;)  I think this one is going
to be gorgious when it's done and his '56 will be jealous.  So jealous
that he'll have to give it to me! :)
