Hi Steve, welcome back, and thanks for touching base.  The dates the
group democratically established are October 25-30.  Hope that works
out for you.  I'm more working on organizing the roster, food, etc.  I
know NOTHING about Mexico, and am hoping to leave the specific travel
plans to you and Steve Garth, which I hope will be ok.

If past experiences are an indication, then 24 people signing up now
tends to mean that half that will actually make it to the trip.  We'll
see as time goes on.

Times of day and so forth I'll leave entirely to your expertese, as it
has been 17 long years since my one tiny trip to Ensenada, which I now
barely remember.  If you can talk the others into eating at restaurants,
fine with me, although I must warn you that many will be travelling
significant numbers of miles that the gasoline will already be
considerable expense.  Too, in the past, we've fared very well with
potlucks.  But see what you can get going, and I'll be happy to help
track it.

We'll go with the flow on the campsites - if it's hot, I'll bet many
will prefer staying close to the cooler ocean if possible.  Safety will
be of concern, as well.  This can either be decided ahead of time, or
we can all even meet in one place in southern California, and go with
the flow where we feel as the wind takes us.  :)

As far as I'm concerned, anything is ok geographically, although considering
the number of days involved, and the fact that not everyone will be able
to make the first days and the last days (some only able to get away
for the weekend proper), maybe tending toward not going to deep into
Mexico is a good idea.

See what you think and give us your feedback! Thanks...
