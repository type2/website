Subject: Hornet car alarm?

Hey volks,

Anyone had experience with the Hornet car alarm?  It is made by the same
company (DEI) that makes the Viper alarm.  It has fewer of the silly features
that the Viper has (which is one of the reasons I like it).

The guy at the alarm/audio shop wants $200 installed for it.  It seems a fair
price to me.  He will have to put in two pin switches (one for the sliding
door and one for the rear hatch, included).  It has a starter kill, remotes,
warning siren, shock sensor, frequency code hopping, blah, blah, blah...  

The best quote I've had before this was $150 for about half the features.  I
don't want to take the time to buy one and install it myself since I don't
consider it &quot;real&quot; mechanical work (nose in the air grin).  Anyway, my van
has been broken into 3 times and I'm getting tired of loosing all the stuff
inside (radio, tool box, rescue bag, etc...) plus replacing the glass.

Anyone had any experience with this system?  How about others?
