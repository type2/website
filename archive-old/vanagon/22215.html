&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; 	An addition to the Thread That Won't Die (tm)
&gt; 
&gt; 	In &quot;The Net&quot; the everysofoxy S Bullock drives a cabriolet,
&gt; and parks it next to a 6X deluxe bus with surfing stickers all over it
&gt; at the airport.
&gt; 
&gt; 	That was the high point of the movie for me.  The rest of it
&gt; kinda sucked, bad.  Pulled 13&quot; hg IMHO :)
&gt; 
I was watching &quot;I Dream of Genie (Jeanie?)&quot; the other night, and he
drove his big, American convertible into a parking lot with several
really old VW's. He parked beside a pristine Oval Bug...
Probably the show was from the mid-late fifties, as a bus had the old
stamped bumpers.
