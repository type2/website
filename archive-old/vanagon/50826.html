Subject: Fwd: 87 Vanagon- Antifreeze smell

A Rabbit heater core can be used in a pinch.  Requires some clearancing of
the shrouding around the heat exchanger to make it fit.  You lose the ability
to turn it off in the summer, unless you add in a Rabbit heater valve in one
of the water lines.  On the plus side, you get to keep most of the $140 that
the dealer wants for a new one and the $70 that most junkyards are asking for
used ones.

Hello to all-

Every time I use the rear auxiliary heater (under the rear bench seat) in my 
van, I smell antifreeze!  I recently removed the rear seat to gain access 
the heater core and let the van idle for an hour or so and couldn't see any 
leaks or indication of leaks...   The antifreeze level has slightly dropped 
over the last couple of months (approx 0.25 inch in the overflow tank).

Has anybody else experienced this?  Have any ideas?

Thanks
