Subject: Re: old bus and beetle parts for sale

&gt;In hopes of financing the purchase of another old bus I have decided to
&gt;part w/ a few of my old &quot;treasures&quot; (to me at least :)  Here thet are, open
&gt;to offers.... I am located in Toronto, Ontario CANADA
&gt;
&gt;***************************************************************************
&gt;Grundig Emden III AM/FM/SW radio (has chrome face plate w/ &quot;VW&quot;'s on the
&gt;tuning and volume knobs) 12 volt - fits 67 and later busses (and beetles?)
&gt;(look familiar ron vn??;)

Michael sold me one of these and it's great.  It's nice to get worldband
reception on the way to work in the morning.   It would be a worthwhile
addition to anyone's bus, IMO.
