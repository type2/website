Subject: VW World Update..

Hi Everyone.  Well, like someone else on the list, I received my VW 
World newsletter (first time I received such a thing after owning new
VW's since 1988).  The package included Free Internet Access with a 
disk that is setup to use Spry Mosaic/Compuserve.  Interesting 
marketing.  It is setup to automatically link to the VW homepage 
(www.vw_dot_com).  I'm not going to use this product as I have my own 
provider, but sounds like VW is finally getting into some good (?) 
marketing.  

I'm going to reformat the disk, and use it for my own stuff.  My 
mother-in-law received the same package earlier this week (1992 
Golf).  She doesn't have a computer.

Harry.
