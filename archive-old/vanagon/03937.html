&gt;I thought that rust-looking stuff is whats holding my Happy Bus
&gt;together.  Seriously, I just got my POR-15 starter's kit.
&gt;Now to find a weekend that's not sunny (I'm in SoCal).
&gt;
I'm curious about that product. Where did you find it? Was it expensive?
Let me (us) know how it worked. (I guess it will be a while before you get
some overcast. :) )

Thanks, Sami
