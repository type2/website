&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe you are wrong, the 86 wolsburg had black fiberglass bumpers,
mags
&gt;&gt;&gt;and black non-power/non-heated mirrors
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've never heard of a model like this. Anybody else??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Look on page100 of the Brooklands Books &quot;Volkswagen Bus-Camper-Van
1979-1989&quot;
&gt;There is a silver one on the upper half of the page.

I don't have a clue as to why you think this is a &quot;86 Wolfsburg&quot;.
It's a regular '89 Vanagon GL.

Do you see the wolfsburg medallions on the front clip?  NO

and look closely, the mirrors ARE power mirrors.

look on the index in the back cover of the book. See where it says '89? 

Point made.
