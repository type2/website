Subject: Joel: Stat Change, Splittie PU Hoarding!

Hi,

I have a stat update for the KS/MO List Members.  Richard Kurtz, former 
Missouri resident, is now a Florida resident, but he isn't taking all his 
vehicles!  His 70 Passenger bus sold locally today and his 65 Single Cab 
(mine previously) and his 60 Double Cab is now in my possesion and 
technically back on the Kansas side of the stateline. 

Here are our extended vehicluar family:

Richard Kurtz:    81 Westy
                  71 Westy (might sell soon)

Jon Christensen:  59 Panel
                  60 Double Door Panel
                  60 Double Cab--Corvair powered
                  60 Double Cab--essentially stock
                  61 Double Cab--ambitious project
                  63 Westy--Long Term Project
                  65 Single Cab
                  84 Vanagon Standard 
                  84 Vanagon GL Driver

Do I win the 'Most Toys' quantitative category?
