&gt;Simple question: where is the switch for the rear defroster on an '86 Westy?
&gt;I have the wires in the glass, but, for the life of me I can't figure out
&gt;how to turn it on.

there SHOULD be a rocker-switch, just above/below the emergency/hazard switch.
it should have some sort of little logo on it that somewhat resembles the
wires on the rear window (if you stretch your imagination a bit). :)

it's on the right side of the 'instrument pod' ... quite neatly hidden from
view by the steering wheel. which also makes it hard to see the little yellow
LED to remind you that you left it on.  :)

and if you have those huge super-neato power mirrors, it also turns on the
defroster inside those.
