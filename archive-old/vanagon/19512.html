&gt; 
&gt; Scratched my head for a while and came up with the rough conversion factor
&gt; of 0.72 to convert Nm to ft-lbs.
&gt; 
&gt; This correct?
&gt; 
&gt; Alistair, trying to keep his units straight
&gt; 
Well, finally one of my many useless solid mechanics engineering
texts to the rescue, Alistair, close enough for gov work officially

0.7376 lb-ft in one N-m

or 

1.0 lb-ft = 1.3558 N-m

but that only matters to an engineer.
