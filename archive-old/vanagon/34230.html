Subject: '84 Wasser-head gaskets
Date: Wed, 31 Jan 96 13:18:00 PST


Before I bought my '84 GL, I had talked about the problems of the 
Wasserboxer and heard the woes of head gaskets. Had 'em checked for leakage 
back then and I'm keepin' an eye on 'em for any signs.

Question: at 150,000+ miles (and I don't know of any rebuild history), 
should I do preventative maintenance and replace the gaskets, or do it when 
they go bad (ie, is there a warning before the whole engine is toast)?
