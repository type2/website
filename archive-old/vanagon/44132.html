Subject: looking for engine/tools

Anyone have a good used type I longblock (or complete) 1600 to fit a 
'70 bus?  My brother i law is looking for somthing to get his bus 
back on the road with.  He's hoping for somthing with the mounting bosses for the 
rear engine bracket; not a big fan of the oil pump cover plate trick. 

Myself, I'm looking for a Tach/dwell meter, a timing light,  and a CDI 
ignition.  If anyone has any good leads, they would be greatly 
appreciated.  We could trade a stove &amp; refrigerator from a '74 westy, 
the propane tank, misc parts + cash, or whatever.  Thanks!
