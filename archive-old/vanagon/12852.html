Subject: Re: VDO gauge color?

&gt;I have decided that the first two gauges that are going onto my new 
&gt;motor will be tachometer and oil pressure.  My question concerns the 
&gt;color.  Which is the most visible overall?  Just looking at the 
&gt;pictures in the catalog the white seems to jump out a little more.  
&gt;Opinions/experiences requested please.  Thanks, Jim

If I remember my ergononics lectures from all those years ago, pale grey 
with black markings was reckoned to be the most visible. I painted the 
gauges in my bus off white (matches the dash and steering wheel). They look 
great, especially at night when they glow an eery pale green. You can use 
Letteraset to re-do the numbers on the speedo, but I left mine blank with 
little dots to mark 30, 50 and 70 mph.
