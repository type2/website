Subject: Newbie goes camping Was: Help! Fridge won't start on propane...
Date: Thu, 09 May 96 11:17:00 EDT


Thanks to all who responded to my plea for help with the fridge.  I think 
I'll be able to get it to work if it's already cold.  It worked before after 
running on 110v for a couple of hours, so I expect after a long day's drive, 
it will start up on propane.

In 5 hours (and counting), we leave Waterloo, Ontario for Vancouver island, 
our first camping trip in a VW Westie.  If, in the next couple of weeks, you 
see a metalic blue '89 on the Trans Canada or on Interstate 90, remember to 
wave.  The van has a &quot;Live music is best.  American Federation of Musicians&quot; 
sticker in the back window.  I'll have a newbie's report when I return.

Signing off for a three weeks...
