Hi Folks,

Martha wanted me to relay another message to you that
it looks like her regular service will be off line longer
than expected and she doesn't know how long it will be
before it is back up.  However, she does have aol access
and would like you direct any mail regarding Pfeiffer or
anything pertinent to her to: andrea2_at_aol_dot_com.  She says
the service is slower, so her response time will slower
also.

Her Pfeiffer reminders are:

  * Be sure to bring lots of quarters for shower use.

  * Bring you musical instruments for the (ahem) hootinanny.

You can always call her at: (510)
Steven
