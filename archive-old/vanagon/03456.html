Subject: Nissan

Just saw a Nissan van driving my girlfriend to the airport. I never
saw one before. I thought it looked alot like a Eurovan! Identical
from the back. I didn't get a real good view, because I couldn't
pass and Angie probably wouldn't have seen the logic in missing
her plane to check out a van. :-&gt;

I saw it somewhat from the side and it sat up as high as me in my
Vanagon. Looked as wide too. Front seemed very Eurovan like, but
my angle was bad.

Anyone else seen them? Looked pretty new.
