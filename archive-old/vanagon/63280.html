Subject:      Fuel Injection

Hi,

I have an '82 Westy Diesel that has been converted and is now the proud
placeholder of a '90 Fox engine, 1.8L I believe (any opinions here?).

I just had my emissions test, and I passed :-)

The results, according to the 'test monitor', showed the bus was running
lean.  He said to get a bottle of fuel injection cleaner and run through
with a tank of gas.  Is this a good idea?
