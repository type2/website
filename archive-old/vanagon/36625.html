Subject: A Visit to the Emissions Station

Hi folks,

Well, I paid my annual visit to my FLETS (Friendly Local Emissions Testing 
Station) today.  The 71 passed with flying colors again, but there were a 
few moments of confusion that lengthened my visit.  It seems my bus was 
registered as a camper, but the computer has it listed as a transporter.  
This caused some delay as the testers tried to figure out if there was an 
error.  &quot;Is this titled as a transporter?&quot; the tester queried.  &quot;Probably,&quot; 
I said, &quot;VW vans have a lot of names.&quot;  &quot;Yeah, that's a hippy bus&quot; he 
smiled and said.  So I was given the green flag to pull up to the test 
location.

After a minute passed the tester comes to the window and tells me that one 
of my tailpipes looks like it's not working.  &quot;That's the exhaust for my 
gasoline burning heater.&quot;  So he says &quot;You mean this is a diesel?&quot;  &quot;No, 
it's a heater that runs on gasoline, the engine burns gasoline too.&quot;  &quot;Oh.&quot;

After another delay he returns to ask if the tailpipes are a dual exhaust 
system or if they come off the same muffler (I'm using a bug muffler). I 
tell him it's just one muffler.  He asks me if I'm sure cause the test 
procedure would be a little different.  Yep, I'm sure.

So I pass and as I'm paying up he tells me that the bus looks good for a 
thirty five year old vehicle.  35? hmmm.  Yes, thanks...  And out of the 
bay I rolled, feeling like an alien who just brought his flying saucer in 
for an emissions test.  We come in peace!...
