&gt; I have a 71 VW Bus which I NEED to sell, soon! I am moving and it has
&gt; to go.

Do us all a favor and junk that under-powered piece.  It has no place trying
to merge onto the heavily traveled roads around here.

0-60 in 20 sec is a danger to us all.

Also about this trip.  I am definatly interested but I have heard nothing
about the plans over here on the east coast, near DC, NYC, Philly, and points
south.

        Also unfortunatly I just retired my bus, (kicking and fighting )
for restoration, what are the possibilities of me hoppin in someones elses bus
for some of the trip.

        However since my bus it out of service for a while
I kept the next car in the family, I bought a VW jetta, not quite the same but
better that some of my other choices.

        Brent
