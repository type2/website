VW has made them and still continues with the Eurovan to this day.  A
recent Hot VW's mag shows a 90 Synchro version.  Unfortunately they
don't appear in the U.S. Dealerships.  Rumor has it that they are
available in Canada.

On a trip to the U.K. Last year I saw a VW van slightly smaller than a
Eurovan that had panel sides.
I don't know what it was called...

Is it looking like a small EV and same as a present F*rd vehicle?
Maybe it's the Sharan, but I know it only as a passenger car.
