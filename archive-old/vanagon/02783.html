&gt;Is it possible to retrofit the power windows and/or doors in an '89
&gt;Westy GL? We have power mirrors (handy), but no power windows/locks.
&gt;If it is possible, are the costs of the job too high to make it
&gt;practical?

ok. having put the mirrors on my 88 bus ($750!!!! gack!!!), i know a little
bit about this:
- IF you have the power mirrors, then you have the wiring harnesses for the
   power windows and door locks. there are three harnesses (left, middle, and
   right) and EACH one is about $100!! ouch!. (for those considering the
   super nice big old electrically defrosted power mirrors, the mirrors are
   about $250 each. you have to drill one hole in each door (for a third
   mounting screw)).
- the power window lifts and motors and switches and such run about another
   $700. i haven't installed them and haven't priced the door locks. :(
*NOTE* NONE of these prices include any labor charges.
i did the mirrors myself, and while it is not difficult, it is a bit tedious.
the little connectors on the mirrors will not fit through the hole in the
door (for the wires), so you'll have to put the mirror on the door, feeding
the wires through, then put the connector on the three wires. by 'connector',
i mean the little white plastic plug-box-thingie. all of this means you have
to take the door panels off ... another somewhat-involved tedious doing. not
hard, but just takes a while.

also: there is already (on 86-91 models) a place for the switch, you just
have to cut the fabric and glue it back so the switch will fit.

if you want, i can give you a list of the parts that i think are necessary,
but, like i said, i have NOT done the windows yet. :(  bentley manual shows
a little bit about putting the power lifts for the windows in. but if you
want someone else to do it, it'll likely run over $1000 for the whole job.
ouch ouch ouch ouch. :(
