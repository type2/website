Hi Peter,
ther is no problem for you to order it direct from Gene Berg Ent. in LA
- US. I visit the Store last Summer and i have a nice talk to the Guys
there. They said to me, with an VISA-MasterCard creditcard No problem
they will send it to you via UPS. The only problem is when you order
some tuning or performence products, then they said its better to do
this over some lokal stores because of the trouble shouting and
guarantee fixing, then you will save some money for expensive call to
oversee.
