re: cv joint grease.

i use Valvoline Moly EP wheel bearing grease, specified for disc brakes.
this can handle higher heat than just regular wheel bearing grease. it's
black and slick and literally leaps off the cv joint to get on your arms,
face, and clothes. but it works goooood in the joint. :)  it comes in a
paper tube, about one foot in length, and costs about $1.50 per tube.
i put 1/2 of a tube into each joint. not ALL of that 1/2 tube will fit
into the joint, so the rest going into the boot (well ... at least what
didn't get on me and my clothes).
