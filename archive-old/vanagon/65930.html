Subject:      84 for sale

HI guys, posted this last week and thought I'd give it one last try before
I give it up to a junkyard.  I have an 84 Vanagon GL suspect of a blown head
gasket that needs a good home before I move to the mountains.  I'm in
Raleigh, NC and I'll let it go for $200 dollars to whomever can come get it.
Interior is nice and the body is in pretty good shape(needs a bath though).
Please reply to me directly as I'm off the list now.peace!

mike
