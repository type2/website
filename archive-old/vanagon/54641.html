Subject: weird mouse story [F]
Date: Mon, 20 Jan 97 16:51:39 EST

Hey all,
OK, I've got one for the books.  This will top all &quot;weird places to find
a mouse&quot; stories.

My girlfriend had a flat tire on her '87 Plymouth Sundance.  So, we go
out there to change the tire to her spare, one of those little
cost-cutting donuts (damn I hate those things).  I also hate those
little scissors jacks used on American cars!  Rant rant rant.  

Anyway, I get the flat tire off and observe the disc brake caliper.  I
see what appears to be something furry lodged in there between the
caliper and the disc.  &quot;What the hell is that????&quot; I say.  

On the Sundance, the caliper extends out past the brake pad so that
there is a little ledge and consequently a very small space between the
disc and the caliper ledge.  

I get the lug wrench and use the sharp end to pry this furry thing out
of this space.  I began to realize what it was as I was prying it out
and then its crispy body broke in half!  Yuck.  So, I pry the rest out
getting a good look at nice dried mouse internal organs.  

This thing falls on the ground (in two pieces) and I am able to view the
remains of one very fried, very brake-dust covered, very crispy, very
dead mouse.  

The only thing I can think of is that this mouse was out exploring the
strut tower (which is right above this wheel) and then Christy (my
girlfriend) went out driving, the mouse fell onto the disc and the
rotating motion of the disc whipped him right along into his final
resting place.  I hope he died quickly.  None of his body parts made it
under the pad so he didn't have any adverse effect on braking, so we
never suspected he might be there.  

Anyway, this beats anything I've ever seen.  I can honestly say that
this is a first for me :) .

I just had to tell you guys :)

Sean
