     bald thursday (this'd be wed any other year) - and another side effect 
      - I'm dropping even further into the past ! Yikes.   
     
     so you know there isn't a time warp - the demo copy of my network 
     client expired, and my boss keeps telling me the order for an 
     additional license will go in any day.
     
     
     
     yeah, sure.

Oh yeah, add me to that list.  Bald by choice, not by genes.  That's my story 
and I'm sticking to it.  I assume we're talking heads and not tires?
