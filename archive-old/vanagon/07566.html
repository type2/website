Subject: Re: Timing Belts

My Volvo 264 and 262C all have timing chains, not belts. My BMW 2002 has dual
timing chains. They should last as long as cynlinder heads do. I have seen 
these chains from my Volvo and BMW when I worked on them. They seemed long 
lasting to me.

Gasoline buses/vanagons/bugs all have &quot;underhead&quot; camshafts with push rods and 
use gears to drive them. They do not have timing belts. The gears can last
forever.

Well, timing belt is not the issue. The credibility of Consumer Reports is.
I am wondering if it ever bash the weakness of timing belts of Accords. Why
every Accord needs to replace its timing belt at 65kmile and yet was number 1 
in quality?  How many Accord engine was destroyed because of the issue?
 
The Consumer Report bashed vanagon's cooling system within 1 year after I
bought my 84 vanagon.
