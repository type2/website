well, if you'd buy it, i'd have to recommend taking a look in the JC 
Whitney catalog...the general one, its not listed in teh VW one..
its in there..around the area of tools, rustproofing, and such i think..

&gt; Actually, I've heard of this approach being used also to stop body rust

&gt; &gt;  Back in my past, we used to put this solar panel and a battery
&gt; &gt; out in the wilds on pipe lines to prevent corrosion. A few milli-
&gt; &gt; amps at a couple volts into the pipe would stop the material migration.
&gt; &gt;  I don't own a water pumper but I've heard about them from some of 
&gt; &gt; the other members. And the price of heads. 
&gt; &gt;  What seems to be happening is a galvanic action caused by heat and 
&gt; &gt; dissimilar metals. I don't think this would be happening if the heads
&gt; &gt; were not isolated electricly from the block. 
&gt; &gt;  I propose a ground strap at least, from head to cylinder body, 
&gt; &gt; neutralizing any electrical imbalance. If nothing else it seems to me
&gt; &gt; it would cause pitting around elect. connection. 
&gt; &gt;  This is just a thought guys, maybe some of you electron hounds can
&gt; &gt; make something of it.     west
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  of course if it works, you'll never know!
