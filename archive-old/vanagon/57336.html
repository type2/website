Get a plastic bottle that coke or water come in. Any size from the 1/2
liter up to the big 2 liter will do, but the smaller ones are better. After
drinking the contents(and rinsing if it wasn't water), cut the bottom off.
Use it as a funnel  for the oil filler. Get another one and use it for the
coolant. You'll never spill any more oil or coolant. Well, ok, not as
easily, at least. You are recycling, and the things are available almost
any place.
