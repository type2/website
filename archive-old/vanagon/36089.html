Subject: Heater unit for 1956 Kombi

 Volksguys and guyettes,

 Hello again! As usual, to the point. The restoration process for the 1956
Kombi is going to require a heater unit. Would someone guide me to a source? TIA

P.S. If there is one available but not complete, I believe that the part
that is missing is the one bladder like unit containing the heat sensor,
overheat switch, etc. I'll know more tomorrow (I hope).
