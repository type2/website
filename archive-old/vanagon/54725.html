Subject: 1,6-l. '79-'82 type 2  'pancake' engine in Bug

Not a real 'Vanagon' posting, but:

I am trying to find out  if the 1,6-l. '79-'82 type 2 'pancake' engine can
be fitted in my '71 Bug. The reason for this is that I want to build a
dependable engine for my daily driver using as many stock VW components as
possible.
Regarding the fact that this pancake engine was developed from the 1.6-l.
upright fan engine in the pre-'79 type 2, I guess it must not be too
difficult to rebuild it in the upright fan configuration. Thus I can fit my
Bug with a stock engine with hydraulic lifters, real oil filter and
electronic ignition, ensuring smoother, quieter running and longlivety.

Who can you help me with engine codes, tips, etc.?

Thanks in advance,
