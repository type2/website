So YVONNER_at_ccit.arizona_dot_edu says:
&gt; aid of the steering wheel.  I got to thinking, how do I get into my van?  
&gt; Just went out and tried.  I open the door with the keys in my right hand 
&gt; and pull myself in with my left hand on the steering wheel.  I do not 
&gt; think that I have to worry though.  It's a '67 with half a million miles 
&gt; on it.  I could probably pull stumps with it.  GARY Gibson.

This kind of speaks sadly of the direction VW has taken on quality when you
take the above into consideration.
