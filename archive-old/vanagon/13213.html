Subject: 68-71 Bus Wanted

Hello, all...

I'm new to the list, and I'm looking to buy a VW bus in the years
'68-'71. Either a running one in the Southern California area, or
any condition (well, straight body) with or without engine, in the
San Diego area. Anybody know of one?

Thanks in advance...
