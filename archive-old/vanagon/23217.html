Subject: Hardcore John Cage Fans Only

	Hey, on that subject, Tori Amos had a sorta-hit with Bells For Her,
the third track on &quot;Under the Pink&quot;, which is vocal and prepared piano.
I saw her play it in person twice- pretty cool! Cage would have liked it.

	Sorry, no VW content other than a recomended listening list:

Tori Amos, The Mermen, Jai Uttal, Shonen Knife, The Hellicasters, David Grisman,
Danny Gatton, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Dada, Brave Combo, The Allman Bros.

	Good for listening in your VW, working on your VW or just thinking 
about it. Write me to trade a tape of your favorite bus music for one
of mine.?

	Bill
