&gt; Ok Folks,
&gt; 
&gt;   My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
&gt; These were some of his quotes:
&gt; &quot;I Hate that freaking car&quot;
&gt;  &quot;It's so ugly&quot;
&gt;  &quot;It's so loud&quot;  &quot;It's so stupid&quot;  &quot;I'd rather walk&quot;
&gt; He is embarrassed when he is seen in the bus; not
&gt; because of its condition, but because it is a VW.
&gt; 
Hormones, my friend, hormones.  If you got rid of the bus, you'd be 
in deep **** also.  My 15 year old still gives me trouble about going 
to town in my rust bucket chevy.  He does like the 73 Super Beetle we 
got him for a school car.  Its the only one at his school.  Mom said 
no on a bus.  Something about teen age boys, hormones, teen age 
girls... :-)

&gt; He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the 
&gt; school dance tonight in the bus...
&gt; 
You might give him a paper sack to put over his head...or wear one 
yourself like a friend of ours did to their daughter.
