Subject: Vanagon Watertemp gauge weirdness

Took the crew down to Pacific Beach last night to see the Olympic Torch
pass through.  Hit Taco Surf for supper.  Must have been good food -- the
kids were too busy eating to get out of line.  Swung thru Law Street
loop/overlook for last surf check.  Looks promising for today. Headhigh and
Santa Ana winds are forecast.  Pulled onto the freeway heading home and the
water temp light started to flicker, _but_ the needle was at it's usual
point about 1/4 - 3/8 up the scale.

sequence:
Pulled off under lights and it came on almost steady but still flickering
at an idle.
Shutdown engine.
Removed and reinstalled spade clip on H2O sensor.
Overflow bottle was empty (haven't looked since end of January), topped it off.
Expansion tank was full.
Restarted.
No warning light.
Ran fine going home (~20 minutes on freeway) w/ no fault light.

Any theories/experience to share?

?Maybe just a dirty/resistive spade terminal acting intermittent, cleaned
up by reseating?

muchas gracias,
dwight
