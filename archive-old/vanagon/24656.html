I hope someone will know something about this.  I have a '71 bus that 
is blowing fuses.  It blows fuses number 1 &amp; 2.  These are the parking
lights, front and rear.  I still have brakes lights, turn signals and 
headlights.  I thought at first that it was a faulty headlight switch.
I replaced it and still get the same thing.  As soon as I pull on the 
switch those two fuses blow.  The strange thing is that this didn't 
happen before I installed the new motor.  I did check the wires in the
back to make sure I hadn't messed them up.  I guess that next I will 
start pulling apart all the bulb assemblies and checking things out.  
Could it be something else up there under the dash?  Thanks, Jim

ps  The new motor is up to about 170 miles.  I am on the 
fourth oil change and the valves and swivel feet adjusters seem to be 
settling down.  Last night only one or two of them needed tiny 
adjustments.  The Weber progressive gets a big thumbs up so far.  I 
have really been keeping my foot out of things and it still feels like
it could pull tree stumps.  This weekend I will begin a serious attack
on the rust.
