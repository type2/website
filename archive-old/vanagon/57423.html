Subject: Re: Vanagon needs new tires 

I hope that it's not too late for Harvey to take back his new Laredos,
because I was wrong, they are not sufficient for heavily loaded
Vanagons. I neglected to mention that since I've been using them I have
regretfully run over 10 children, 15 nuns, 30 deer and a runaway
meatball. Luckily no one was hurt except for the meatball.
 For safety's sake, not only am I trading in my Laredos for the top of
the line, load range XX, unobtainium-reinforced, super heavy-duty radial
truck tires, but I am also investing in: four-wheel anti-lock disk
brakes, air bags for the OUTSIDE of my van, pedestrian detecting
radar(1500 ft rad.), a dragster parachute, and a cow catcher for my
bumper. I recommend that you and every other Vanagon driver out there
(especially those that have been using passenger tires on V-gons for
years without any problems, I won't name names, you know who you are)
should do the same. 
 You also might be interested in joining the major class-action suit
against Uniroyal for their willful and irresponsible disregard for
puplic safety. If so visit this website:

 Actually, on second thought...I think I'll just keep the Laredos. I
really need that extra $150 dollars for that set of Franklin Mint
Liberace Commemorative rhinestone hubcaps that I've been lusting after
for my 'defective' '71 Ford Pinto. 
  
 Seriously volks, the Yoko's sound like an excellent alternative to
being a 'menace to the roads'. I just wish that I could have afforded
them. Like many people, I had to save up for a long time before I could
afford my dream Westy, and it still needed a lot of work. Some people
(myself included) have no choice but to make 'price' a major factor in
the buying decision. At least I didn't install more passenger tires like
the PO had done (I have to *assume* that they didn't hit any kids and I
know the van wasn't rolled). I thought that I was doing the responsible
thing by using the more expensive light truck tires even if they weren't
the best ones out there. I guess that there will always be someone
around to remind you that you aren't being safe *enough*. 

 I might also add (before the flaming begins) that at no time did I ever
say that the Laredos themselves cause the van to handle badly or cause
unusually bad stopping distances, and I have tested that on ocassion.
Sure, I said that the Vanagon itself handles, I believe that my exact
words were, &quot;like and aircraft carrier&quot;, but that is only when compared
to the average passenger cars. As vans go it fares quite well. Please
don't suggest that your Vanagon handles like a formula 1 racecar because
of your expensive tires, as this would be a far stretch of the
imagination. However, I dare say that *my* Westy, equipped with the
Laredos handles just fine for what it is, and has never inspired any
fear that I am destined to have an accident as a result of bad handling
or cheaper tires. On the tires themselves, I'll reiterate, &quot;I like
them.&quot; Soon I will take them x-country and I will be sure to give anyone
who is interested an honest long-term assessment of their quality. If in
my experience they fail to live up to the standards of decent tires, I
will be the first to say it.

Just my $2/100 so flame away...but remember, it's Friday! Most of this
was written with a high H-rating, as in 'humor'. :)
