I'm having problems getting my '84 GL to start.  The symptom is that it cranks 
and cranks right prettily, but never fires.

I've checked that fuel is in the tank, fuel is getting to the engine, and 
there is a good spark.  The Hall control unit checks out OK.  Sparkplug wires 
are OK.

The odd thing is, if I put the battery charger on it for a while it will start 
to fire and then quit.  I suspect something electronic is not working right 
with a slightly sub-standard voltage, but I don't want to go replacing 
expen$sive black boxes at random.  

Anyone have any ideas?  Or suggestions for trouble shooting?  As far as I can 
tell everything's fine, it just doesn't work :-(
