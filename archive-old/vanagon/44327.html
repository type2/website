&gt;thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)

&gt;From what I've read on this list, an '81 VW bus motor has heads very 
similar to a '70s T4 motor,  the main difference being the exhaust outlets 
which are square instead of rounded (please correct me if I'm wrong).  
I bought a VDO CHT guage kit for my '74 1800 camper, and found that the 
sensor, which is designed to fit under a sparkplug, would not fit because 
the sparkplug hole is recessed into the head.

There has been some discussion on the list from time to time about this 
and it seems that if your T4 motor has or had fuel injection then there 
is a threaded hole on which to bolt the sensor and if not then one can be 
drilled.  I haven't checked this out but I intend looking into it next 
time I have the heads off.  In the past, David Schwarze has described to 
the list how he has fitted a CHT guage to a T4 motor, so perhaps he would 
be a good person to ask for advice. 
 
Cheers
