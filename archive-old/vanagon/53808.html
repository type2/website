Hi again,

Bob's right too.  I forgot about grounds.  Check all of them.  My
negative at the battery was pretty corroded up where it screwed into the
frame.  Adding a ground like Bob suggested is easy and cheap.  I vote
for all the easy and cheaps before spending money!

Check connections and wiring too on everything that goes to the 'puter.
