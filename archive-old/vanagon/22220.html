Subject: RE:  Battery Isolator

I installed one of the Battery Isolator's on my 84 Vanagon.  Initially I 
had problems unrelated to the Isolator - just related to my failure to 
check the system voltage after installation.  It turns out that the 
system voltage is dropped about .75 volts when using a battery isolator.  
Unfortunatelly, the stock voltage regulator installed in the altenator is 
not adjustable.  The solution is to purchase an adjustable voltage 
regulator from a reputable alternator supplier (auto electric repair 
facility), install the unit, and set your system voltage for 14.5 volts 
(or there about).  By the way the unit I purchased from JC Whitney allows 
me to link both batteries together for starting if I desire.  If you need 
anything further, don't hesitate to ask. 

I'd be happy to dig up part numbers and send a picture of the mounting.  
P.S. - how much will you be asking for the diesel?
