Subject: Tobin and Krista's progress


After our camping trip Tobin and Krista (sp?) gave me a ride up to my
house in Felton and I treated them to pizza and beer for dinner - man
that was good after camping. At 7pm we were watching &quot;Earth 2&quot; when
the power went out with about 10 minutes left in the show and stayed
off all nite, so then we just sat around the fireplace and talked and
drank beer by candle lite - just like camping again, but with a more
major storm than we experienced while camping.

About 9 am they followed me down the hill (under felled trees and
around downed power lines) and said our goodbyes. I went to work while
they went to Santa Cruz to have their aux. gas heater worked on - they
keep blowing their 8amp fuse, luckily SC has an abundance of VW shops.

Hopefully tonite they will make it to Dave's house in San Luis Obispo
and tell us how it went (and whether they could afford it). Since I
forgot to give them my work number I can only hope that they make it
okay.

Since I am in digest mode I haven't read Martha's trip report yet, I
hope she gave us a good review :)
