Subject: Re: ? WHO BUYS SALVAGE VANS?

Greetings,

I posted that my van was purschased from a salvage yard called  &quot;The Buggy
Doctor&quot;, Miami, FL.  Ph 305- 636-2717. Owner's name is Guiermo, aka
William. The yard specializes in VW only.  They buy VW's and dismantel and
or ship parts and vehicles. A very nice guy, but firm.

Sincerely,
Mark Keller

&gt;     I saw some traffic about some places that buy used vans to part-out or
&gt;     restore.  Does anyone know off-hand the names and locations of these
&gt;     places?  One I believe was in So Florida.
