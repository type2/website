&gt;      I am looking for a 93 Eurovan, light metallic blue, low miles, with

&gt;      MV's without weekender (pop top) package.  

Sounds like you want my van.  Though its more of a medium blue.
      
&gt;      I know this is a pretty picky request.  I guess I'm just picky.
&gt;      
&gt;      Also, any advice on owning one of these beasts?

I grew up on the rear engine vans but this Eurovan was one of the best 
automotive investments I've ever made.  I've had dealer problems but I 
LOVE the van.  Extremely comfortable for long distance driving - I've 
done a ten hour drive with no tush fatigue.

One niggly complaint - I don't really like the large diameter cigarette 
lighter.  When I plug the phone cord (with a sleeve adaptor) it keeps 
losing contact.  But with a various electric toys I want for the car I'm 
thinking of adding extra lighter sockets - there is a space with room for 
at least two sockets if I remove one cover plate on the dash.
