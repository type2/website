&gt;My 86 westy needed the rack replaced badly all through out the winter(in
&gt;Canada) last year, finally had it done so my wife could take a big trip
&gt;with the van. Cost me $650.00 (Canadian) with exchange and I even got a 
&gt;1 year warranty (in writing!), 

&gt; Your rack can be rebuilt, by MOOG, mine cost me $350Cdn sent in via a
&gt; friendly freelance VW mechie. One year warranty.  


I have been selling U.S.-rebuilt racks rebuilt from an Ohio-based firm for
some time now.  They run $249.95 (exchange) and carry a LIFETIME factory
warranty.  So far I've sold a number of them and not had any problems.  
The price and warranty are both appealing.
