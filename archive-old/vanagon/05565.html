I agree with you Joel, except that usually there are some &quot;corners&quot; of truck-
stop lots that are not crowded, or too small to park an 18-wheeler, that
are decent places to park.  I have had the best luck by far parking on dirt
roads around/between fields.  Usually quiet, dark, and private.  Lots of them
in California, too...
