Sounds to me like you know what you are doing.  :)  All I can say is 
to get out your Muir and go through it step by step.  If you are 
getting nothing I would say battery connections would be a first step.
Also, you must run out to the garage and get those manuals!  You are 
the guy for whom we have been searching.  You must make multiple 
copies of all your manuals and stand by for further instructions.  You
will be notified where to send them.    Jim         '71 Campmobile
