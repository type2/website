Subject: &lt;all&gt;  PS line rust-out

Another rust gremlin for y'all with power steering.

Steady leakage of the low pressure return line turned out to be nice rust
through where the pipes are held onto the undersides at/by rubber mounts
with bent over clips. The rust through was within the region under the
rubber, just seeped along and dripped.  Next time under check the mounts
out, they trap moisture and grit, and help rust out faster.  The section was
noticeably thinner than rest of the line.  Temporary solution is 7.5' of
1/2&quot; ID reinforced gasoline hose, BUT I can't get a yes/no on it being OK
for PS fluid.  Don't try this on the high pressure side!!!  Going to try and
get a fresh steel line bent up/flared next week. bye, tim
