&gt; is competing with him for bargin priced used VWs &amp; parts. And he's probably
&gt; right. Ok, now I sorta understand this particular bee in this particular
&gt; bonnet.
&gt; 
&gt;         I guess there's no answer to these issues, its the human thing.
&gt; I just hope we can all keep it civil.

On the contrary Bill, I actually like what Ron is doing now that he 
is in business as a provider of primarily new parts, which he does 
quite exceptionally by my estimation.  I am not in business as I only
occasionally buy used parts/vans and am by no means competition with him, 
but I do feel that the list should always remember the bottom line of 
where the money goes.  So is the American way.  I have so far had 
exceptional dealings with Ron on parts, new and used since he started 
into business a couple months back, I would reccomend him to anyone, 
this is in stark contrast to what I would have estimated about 6 
months back, which was the point of my message.  His business has 
been prompt and courteous something getting rare in this world.
