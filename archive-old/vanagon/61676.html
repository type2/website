That IS bad! Our 85 only got 50% out of the last set of tires. Tire
America basically told me tough luck since I did the tire rotation, it
was out of alignment blah,blah,blah... I took the van to my buddies at
Merchant Tire and got a second opinion. They told me to take it back and
suggest the inner wear could possibly be due to them selling me improper
tires i.e. not reinforced sidewalls. That was all it took, they honored
the warranty. These new tires seem to be doing fine.

&gt;My bus suffers from the wear-out-80K-tires-in-30K-or-less syndrome 
&gt;due to the camber setting severely wearing the inside edges prior to 
&gt;the outside edges.  Time has worn the suspension components and the 
&gt;camber has never been adjusted (well not the last 125K miles I've 
&gt;owned it).

&gt;&gt; Why do you want to do this?
&gt;&gt; Just curious
