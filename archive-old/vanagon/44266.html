Subject: Wasserboxer Engine Rebuild
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Hey Vanagoners,

I pulled the engine out of the 88 Wolfsburg last saturday. Everything
went very smoothly.  A nice mixture of coolant and oil came out of the
coolant hoses to the radiator as well as from the coolant passages
around the head and cylinders.  The guy I bought the Vanagon from said
he drove a couple of blocks after the smoke started rolling out of the
exhaust.  After disassembling the engine, I saw the cause of this large
display of smoke :blown head gasket.  Further inspection revealed
corroded heads + 4 broken head studs +  and one cracked head + 130k mi. 
=  engine rebuild.   Does anyone know of any decent parts suppliers that
stock Wasserboxer engine parts?  I've talked to a few places in
California that &quot;specialize&quot; in Wasserboxer engines but I would like to
here if anyone has experience with any particular company.  Any
responses will be appreciated.



Thanks
Justin (excited to get first Vanagon on the road)
