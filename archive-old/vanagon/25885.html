Subject: Five Cylinder Vanagon

Does a five cylinder Vanagon actually exist ?

If so, does anybody have parts illustrations in
hard copy or micro fiche ? 

Or better yet, can anyone tell me where one can
get the engine mounts, oil pump pickup, oil pan
and any other modified parts needed to convert
a U.S. model to a five cylinder ?  I've been told
the diesel bell housing will bolt to the Audi five
cylinder engine but that is the only part from the
four cylinder diesel that is usefull.

Thanks in advance
