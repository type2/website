Subject: RE: starting problems

I happened across a car-fix'em-up column in the local rag yesterday that I
thought would sound familiar to those with the infamous solenoid problem...
A guy had an '87 mustang with (you guessed it) a starting problem when the
engine was hot...would start OK when cold but after a short run, no go..
whats up? The response was that Ford solenoids had an idiotsynchracy that
sometimes required a tap with an object of suitable hardness (hammer) to get
going...so it isn't just the VW crowd crawling under their vans to get mobile,
or maybe all solenoids are made to the same specs (lousy) or in the same
garage...
