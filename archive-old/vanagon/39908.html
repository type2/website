Subject: weber carburetor

I hate to sound like a newbie or anything, but I was wonderin if anyone 
could help me.  I have a Weber progressive (32/36) carb attached to my 
1600 d/p in my bus.  Now, I've owned this type of carb before and found 
that they have done very well for me, so I would like to stick with this 
one.  The problem I am having with it is this:  It seems that regardless 
of how much I adjust the thing, the exhaust smells something terrible.  
Burnt gas smell..  Just like exhaust, but a WHOLE lot stronger.  The 
thing does not smoke at all, never has, so I am assuming that it is not 
running toooo rich.  It has the stock jets still in it, made for a 1600 
or so.  I'd have to take it back apart to see what the jets are.  I also 
have a monza 4 tip exhaust hooked up to it. (if that makes any difference)
What am I missing?  And am I adjusting the thing the way it should be 
adjusted?  the screw in the front (between the carb and the fan shroud) 
(front=back, right? :)  Should it spin out to make the gas leaner or in 
to make it leaner?  I could really use some help on this one.  If anyone 
has a clue I would really appreciate it tons..

Thanks a bunch,
