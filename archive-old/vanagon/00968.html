&gt; Report on First Solo &quot;Cross Country&quot; in Vanagon:
&gt;  
 (bunch of stuff deleted)

&gt; 8) I enjoyed looking down on the &quot;little people&quot; in their Caravans and 
&gt;   Villagers!! Such tiny Lilluputians they are.
&gt;  
&gt; 9) I began to wonder how I ever lived without it.

  Thanks for the post Matthew.  It's nice to have a good chuckle first
thing in the morning.  

  I to am a recent first time owner of a Vanagon.  It's the visuals that
make driving my Vanagon the most pleasant thing for me.  It's always
enjoyable to be able to look down on the little people, but the windshield
is where it's at.  With the absence of the hood and that huge surface area
of glass, it's like having a big-ass HD-TV monitor stuck right in your face.
The road is just more fun to look at when I'm toolin' down it in my Vanagon.
