Wow...Rememeber when there where &lt; 200 people on the list...
Cheeze and Crackers, I remember having a file of all the
addresses....

Anyway, as I drove NuBus ('82 Diesel) to work this a.m...

(note to newer members...in '94, NuBus blew up her diesel engine a little 
while after I got her, I considered putting her out of my misery. She  was 
70 miles from home. Joel and crew were way sympathetic..Then her &quot;new&quot; 
Dasher engine needed a head rebuild due to a timing belt breakage..)

...at 70 mph, I started thinking about being cold. IN '82, the gas
Transporter was aircooled, and the diesel watercooled. So, NuBus is
watercooled, but the heat really is weak.

 Some suggestions I have read in the past are

 1) Put cardboard over the radiator

 2) Cover the air-intakes for the vents with plastic, and the plastic will
   disintegrate by springtime. 

Any thoughts on these ideas?  Any other ideas?  Do wasserboxers have a
meager heat problem?  Are other bunker-burners warm?
