Subject: starter / solenoid
Date: Sun, 15 Oct 1995 16:51:39 -0400 (EDT)

Last night my van refused to start when I turned the key.
No click, no grind, no nothing! Lights and other accesories worked fine and battery was fine. I checked for voltage at solenoid using test light and it was fine as was high current wire to starter. Pulled starter out of van and noticed braid (ground strap?) between starter and solenoid was corrrode away to nothing and brass (?) connector spade was missing center rivet (?) connection. 
My questions :
1. Will lack of gound braid stop function of solenoid / starter ?
2. What was missing from between  the two brass spades on solenoid 
                  I____I
                    ^here.
3.Can the solenoid be easily rebuilt or should I spring for $140 rebuilt stater/solenoid at local parts store?
