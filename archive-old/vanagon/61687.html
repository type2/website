If it's just contact cleaner, you can get some from Radio Schreck for $2.95.

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;This came up on the VW usenet group and I thought that I would pass the
&gt;info along for anyone(everyone?) else who may have problems with the
&gt;electrical connections on their FI.  The stuff is called Stabilant 22A and
&gt;has a VW part # of ZVW-186-001.  There was a TSB that calls for it's use
&gt;in solving a variety of Digifart problems.  It is really expensive, and
&gt;I've not tried it out myself.  VW wants $40 for 2oz.  Below I've attached
&gt;the manufacturer's phone number, address, and prices.  If anyone has used
&gt;this stuff I would like to hear about your experiences.  Supposedly it 
&gt;works wonders.  TIA.
