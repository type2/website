Hello
    I haven't kept up with the list in the past months.  And I 
just finally got on the list here at work, .  I recently graduated 
and now am in the &quot;real world&quot; and can't access the list from my 
school address anymore.

    Someone had mentioned that they were copying manuals.  Can I 
still get a copy of the 70 bus manual?  I only got the last call a 
few days late.  So I counldn't get in on the original order.  

    Also does anyone have any recomendations for carbs for a 2L bus. I 
got a 2L fool injected motor and rebuilt it and can't get 
the fool injection working so I would like to put a set of good carbs 
on.  Good as in more concerned with relyability and not really great 
power.  It is about to be registered as historic and will be a second 
vehicle for when you just gota have the bus and no little 4 door is 
acceptable.  Since I did just graduate and I am ozzing with bills 
from school and not money, price is also a concern.


Thanks 
Brent
