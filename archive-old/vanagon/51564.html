Subject: Alex and the List Shirt


Our (mine, my wife's and Alex's) list shirts arrived Friday. We held off 
giving Alex his shirt until Saturday morning. Alex just turned 4 last 
week...the shirt, the smallest Richard could make, seems to fit a 6 or 7 year 
old, but that did not bother Alex...nope...on went the shirt. His only 
complaint....when the shirt is tucked into his pants, the EuroVan is covered 
up!!  Of course, after wearing it Saturday all day saturday, he wants it 
washed so he can wear it to Child Care on Tuesday!
