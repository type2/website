Subject: ? Splittie rust-repairable?

Hey now,
        Looked at a '59 today here in Austin (I believe it was posted to
the list a few days back) and it has some hardcore cancer. Down by the
jackpoints (or where the jackpoints are on a baywindow, I'm assuming they
remain constant) there are holes about 2-3&quot; wide. This is on the
crossmembers that the floorpan rests on. Hardcore. Seems to me this is real
difficult to repair, any thoughts? The fellow has done a decent job on the
interior, it's in pretty fair shape, just a few spots with water damage.
Cute paint job too, real hippied out. The wife loves it, but I'm afraid
it's beyond me since I can't weld.

Peace,
