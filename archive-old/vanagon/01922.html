Subject: Brakes, Synchro's and EV/Winn


First things first: the brake light problem seems to be the switch on the
master cylinder, although the rear wheel cylinders were in bad shape too.
Weird thing is that the 2 brake switches are wired in parallel, yet when
one is disconnected the brake lights no longer work! Very scary. I'm ordering
switches Monday to replace. Any idea what the life of a master cylinder is -
since I'm going to have to drain this one I'm wondering if I should just
replace it now and save myself the trouble later.

The one thing I've heard about the synchro's is that those 10 CV joints are
very expensive to replace. Also I think the original price on them was pretty
high - so they're like old Mac's - people don't want to sell them for the going
price today!

I got a look at the new EV/Winn. Very nice vehicle. Very tech inside. Very
pricey too - $30K. For some reason the dealer chose to install another
(remoavle) couch-seat facing backwards right in front of th fridge (+$500)
plus an auxiliary furnace (+$500). Still very nice. Had a hatch in the roof
too.
Maybe those late model Westfalia owners will be trading theirs in for the
new model soon? It might pay to wait a few months before buying a late
model just to see.
