&gt;1.  ennybody running these shoes?  How do you like em and on what bus are
&gt;they?

No

&gt;2.  What would the rolling diameter difference be between 205/70 MXL$$$ and 
&gt;    195x75.  

The &quot;nominal&quot; diameters are very close.  25.5&quot; for the 195/75 and 25.3&quot; for
the 205/70.  
I emphasize the word &quot;nominal&quot; beause every model of tire is different.  I've
measured two models of 27&quot; light truck tires (27&quot; is the dia, so they should
be the same, right?) and there was .75&quot; difference in diameter.  One was
about 25.75 and the other 26.5&quot;.

&gt;The intended use is a mostly on road syncro westie.

For on road use I recently put 205/70 Goodyear Aquatread tires on my wife's
2WD van.  I have less than 10K miles on them so it's too early for me to give
an opinion on them, but if it were me, I would stick to the 205/70 size (for
on road use) whatever model you pick.  It should give you better traction
(wider, thus more contact patch) and better cornering (lower sidewall height,
thus less sidewall flex) than the 195/75 tires.

&gt;Derek?, Harry?, Syncrohead? whats the poop?
&gt;It is my understanding that the 205/70 MXL reinforced is NLA, BTW.

I've heard this about the MXL-reinforced also.
