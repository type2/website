Subject: 1986 Vanagon For Sale

Hi.
In preparation for immigrating to Australia, my parents are putting their
1986 Vanagon up for sale.  It is in excellent condition.  I had both
cylinder heads re-manufactured by RimCo last December, and there are no
problems at all with the Vanagon now.  It has also had a full set of new
hydraulic lifters installed, and the oil &amp; filter has always been
fastidiously changed.  I changed the AC compressor &amp; receiver/dryer about
10 months ago and had the system recharged with freon.  Coolant has been
changed annually.  The Vanagon is Silver and has blue upholstery - both in
excellent condition (no dents or rust at all).  We are asking $4800, but
this is negotiable.  Located in Riverside, California.
Please reply directly via e-mail if you are interested in purchasing the
Vanagon.
Regards
MIKE
