Hi all!

	A new subscriber to the list, River Psmythe!!!  Last saturday
evening Amelia pushed a beautiful baby boy out into my waiting hands.
He's already had a ride in the bus (slept the whole way, feeling safe
and secure in there of course), and I went over the procedure for
changing the rear brake shoes with him yesterday, just before I did
it.  He seemed pretty excited to be hanging out in the garage with
poppa:)  Amelia and I couldn't be happier!

take care all,
	    brandy
