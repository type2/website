Subject: 1.9L &amp; 2.1L Water pump interchange

     I am rebuilding a 1984 1.9L Vanagon engine to 2.1L specs (2,1L cyls,
pistons, etc.).  When finished, I plan to put the engine in a 1985 GL.
     Does anyone know if a 2.1L water pump will bolt up to the 84 engine
block?  Is the only difference a larger water capacity or is the size of the
water pump different.  I am buying a pump from Ron Salmon and I specified to
him that I needed a pump to fit the 84 engine, but if I make a 2.1L engine
out of it, can I (or should I) use a 2.1L pump on it?

Thanks,
