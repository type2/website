Subject: vw ev conversion manual!


&gt;From my very most favorite catalog, thought some of you might be interested:

VW EV Conversion Manual - use an old VW chassis to make your own electric car...

Full schematics, blueprints, and many photos.  Information on series and
parallel hybrids, batteries, motors, adaptor plates, controllers, relays,
wiring and optional fiberglass bodies.  If you're in California, with the
tax credits, you can convert a VW for less than $700.  100 pages.  $25.
Author is Ron Kaylor.

This of course shows a picture of a beetle, but probably much is applicable
to the bus/van anyway, so thought I'd mention it.  Available from:

P.O. Box 4616
Boulder, CO  80306-4616
1.800.442.1972, 1.303.449.6601
