I was sorting some pulleys today, looking for one dinged-up enough to
sacrifice for an assembly crank -- you weld a handle on an old pulley, use it
to turn the crank during engine assembly.  A couple of the pulleys had serial
numbers stamped on the hubs, meaning they are part of a balanced assembly for
that particular engine.  (There's still a few engines-in-progress around the
shop.)

The sight of the serial numbers reminded me that I'd failed to mention that
critical detail in my sermons about engine balancing ('Free Horsepower').
 When you get your parts back from the balancer it's wise to mark them with
the serial number of the engine they are destined for.  Use cut-steel stamps
to stamp the numbers onto the hub of the fan pulley, the rim of the flywheel
and the flange of the pressure plate.  A vibrating carbide scribe is best for
marking the crankshaft.

A set of steel stamps is about five bucks from Harbor Freight.  They come in
all sizes, from 1/16&quot; characters for gun work to 3/8&quot; European-style numbers
for stamping the serial number on engines rebuilt on a replacement crankcase.
 In some states such crankcase re-numbering is a legal requirement, and is
always done on aircraft engines.  You'll also want to stamp the #1 main
bearing flange and the crankcase parting line with the over-size if the
crankcase has been align-bored.  The good shops do this as a matter of course
but some of us can't afford the good shops.  The bearing flange is marked at
the 3 o'clock position looking into the bearing from the flywheel.  The
parting-line marks are put on the upper surface just opposite the generator
tower but enough toward the flywheel so they can be easily seen.  Half a
millimeter over-size is .020, a full mil .040.

If you overhaul an engine it's polite to add a dash-number to the serial
number: -1 for the first overhaul, -X2 for the second, and so forth.  In some
places it's not only polite, it's a legal necessity.  (I've seen aircraft
engines with six dash numbers after the serial.)  Another method I've seen is
to punch an asterick after the serial number: -* meaning the first overhaul,
-** for the second and so forth.  In some circles this is considered less
positive than dash-number markings since it's harder to disguise -xxx4 (four
overhauls) than -****   (Aircraft engines use aluminum crankcases that are
easily welded; it's fairly easy for a weldor to 'vanish' a couple of
astericks.) Various engine modifications are marked in the same way, with
special codes or characters for each.

If you manufacture an engine using all new parts you are legally entitled
(and required, in some cases) to use a unique serial number.  The last four
digits of the serial number will be found somewhere on every major part of
the engine.  If you ever encounter a 2180 with a prop instead of a clutch and
a serial number that starts 'HVX', it's one of mine.  (Hoover, Volkswagen,
Experimental.  The 'Experimental' reflects the catagory in which home-built
aircraft are licensed.)  Although most of the aircraft engines I've built are
still flying, one turned up in a Manx in Oklahoma.  (Yes, I overhauled it.
 It's my policy to maintain what I've built.)
