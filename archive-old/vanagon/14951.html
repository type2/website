Subject: Re: My Cool Sway Bars

&gt;
&gt;Well, I got those sway bars on my '77.  I ended up just using 

I missed if you mentioned how much you paid.  And could I 
put them on my '74?  Also, can someone remind me what it means
if the rear end starts sinking a bit.  When I look through the 
rear view mirror, it looks like the back end is down by about 
an inch and a half.  Tire pressure accounts for a bit of it as
I don't think I have properly rated tires.  But it's slightly
lower than that.  &lt;wrinkled forehead&gt;  --Ralf
