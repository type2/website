Subject: '84 Westy air-cooled


&gt;1st mechanic sez &quot;enough&quot; tin is there. The rest is a dust barrier.
&gt;Folks, there was a good 4 or 5 inches of opening all around the engine. I
&gt;have installed aluminum sheeting the best I could to block this opening.

Dust barrier.

We have immense vents in both sides of the bus designed specifically to
push huge volumes of unfiltered air straight into the engine compartment.
What, pray, could a dust barrier hope to keep out?

Engine tin in an aircooled is binary. It's required; it's either there or
it isn't. If it's there, it's there for a reason--it channels the air as it
needs to be channeled. If it isn't there, it's negligence.

(All that's just to give you some more rhetorical ammunition with Slacker
Mechanic #1. ;) Actually there's no way to avoid this sort of crap unless
you do your own work. But I do hope you jack this guy up.)
