&gt;   Although my bus is out of commission, a contingent of Kautzini are still 
&gt;   interested in attending the Red Rock bash, despite having to camp in a tent.
&gt; 
&gt;   What I want to know is: 
&gt; 
&gt;   Are we still welcome?

DOH.  What kind of question is that?  OF COURSE!

&gt;   Will we be teased incessantly for the entire weekend if we show up in a
&gt;   &lt;gag, retch&gt; Oldsmobile station wagon?

Yes.  No getting around that one.

&gt;   If not, what foodstuffs on the potluck list are still needed?

I think Martha will have to answer that one...

&gt;   Is anyone thinking of bringing mountain bikes?

Hadn't thought about it, but it is a good idea.  I'll bring mine, if you
promise not to tease me about it (it's a Huffy &lt;gag retch&gt;). 
&gt; 
&gt;   How stupid would I be if I was to pretend I never saw those bits of metal,
&gt;   put fresh oil and filter on my bus and take it Red Rock anyway &lt;round trip
&gt;   750 miles&gt;?

No more stupid than me, that's for sure.  Just bring a towbar in case one of 
us needs to tow you home.  :)
