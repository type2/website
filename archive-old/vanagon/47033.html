Subject: Re: transmission leaking. WHAT TO DO??

John,

  Is the oil motor oil or 90 wt?

  If it's motor oil the main seal in the engine may be leaking.  If it's 
90wt, there is a seal around the input shaft that might be leaking.

  Feel free to e-mail me back personally if you need more advice.  I 
work in a VW repair shop and know a good amount about VW's.  I also sell 
VW parts through the internet.  Check out my Web site for a list of 
Vanagon parts at reasonable prices!
