&gt; I guess not.  At least with Bus Boys Safaris you can close them at least 10
&gt; times before you break the latches. (only kidding :) ) and at least the color
&gt; is the correct white the factory used.  O well, what do you expect with hand
&gt; welded latch tabs instead of die spot welded tabs.  All kidding aside, Steve
&gt; and Joe try to do a flattering imitation of our Safaris.  I guess next time
&gt; spend a little extra and get 'em right.

Word on the street is the Wolfgang safaris are _nicer_ than the Bus Boys.  I
also hear the same thing about other gadgets, like the spindles and 
lowering kits.  But thats hearsay...

Its not the latch _tabs_ that are the problem; its the taiwanese _latch_!

Fo everyone else's benefit, the latches are a modified vent wing latch, which
essentially has the &quot;back&quot; cut off (so it doesn't form a U to go under the
glass) and is drilled and tapped for 2 screws to hold it to the frame.  The
part of the latch that actually rotates is a godawful sloppy fit in the latch
body.  I don't see how they would hold a wing-window closed, much less a
safari window.

To Wolfgang's credit, they didn't make the latch; they get them from
a 3rd party, who doesn't seem to care.  Make crappy latches, sure, but
you sell more of them.

So, Jim, are you saying that your repro-safari latches are &quot;The Bomb,&quot; fit
tight in their bores, and won't snap off like peanut brittle?  If thats
the case, then I'll sign on for a set.

Wish I had a grand or so laying around, so I could step up to a set of
NOS originals...

Its raining today, of course, which adds an extra dimension to this 
comedy.  I was annoyed when my windsheilds _seeped_ before...  Seeping
would be pure luxury now...
