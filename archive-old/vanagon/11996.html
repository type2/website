Christa and Tobin Copley Survive Alabama! &lt;film at eleven&gt;

well, they're gone. :) now i have my little house all back to myself.
The Copleys arrived monday night (later than they predicted) from
new orleans, louisiana. out to the bar-b-que place for supper, where
they feasted on possum ribs and such (we told them it was pork; they
never knew the difference!) :)

Tuesday was start-to-work-on-the-camper day. tobin changed the oil and
filters and we made some plans to fabricate a better exhaust for his
eberspacher gasoline heater. that night was eating at a all-you-can-
swallow-for-one-price place.

Wednesday was fix-the-heater day and clean-the-bottom-of-the-engine day.
all this time, christa was re-transcribing her journal from the old
tequila-soaked notebook to a new, dry one. (the bottle broke, somewhere
in mexico). and calling folks, checking in with family, making
connections for the next phase of the trip.

they are going from alabama up to north carolina, and from there, on up
into the atlantic provinces of canada, then eventually will head back
across canada to home in vancouver by april.

entertainment was watching tv (they hadn't seen any for a while) and
showing pictures (they'd had some developed at a wal-mart down in
new orleans) and suffering through a rendition of joel's-trip-to-most-
everywhere on slides. :)

and that's about it. christa said she'd put out a loooong trip report
when they get back (and regain access to the internet).
