Subject:  electrical goofiness FIXED!!! :) :) :)

Hey all!

Well I'm definitely having a good day.  OK, here's the deal.  You all know
by now the details of my '78 bus's electrical goofiness.  Well, I checked
the fuses the other day and they all looked OK.  Joel said clean stuff up. 
Someone else (I forgot who) wrote and told me to make sure the fuses
were OK.  So I go to the parking lot with the intent of cleaning up fuses
and fuse contacts.  I look in Bentley for the fuse chart 'cause I want to
see what does what.  I look:  parking lights -- fuse #2.  front side marker
lights, fuse #2.  License plate light -- fuse #2.  Right rear taillight -- fuse
#2.  Hmmm, I say to myself, I think I see a pattern here.  Everything on my
car that does not work is connected to fuse #2.  Get under fuse box and
pull #2 fuse (which still looks fine by the way) and lo and behold it is
broken!  I couldn't tell by looking at it but when I pulled it the bottom part
came off.  This fuse had blown, from the look of it.  Now, I know it's not a
good idea to just pop in a new fuse without knowing why the old one
blew, but I put in a new 8-amp fuse and everything worked.  I left it on
for a while and no red-hot glowing.  Here's my theory on what
happened:

Originally I thought I had disconnected something inadvertantly when I
was bumping around under the dash to fix the speedometer.  However,
everything seemed to be OK.  

Here's why I think the fuse blew:  A couple days ago we had about 4&quot; of
snow here.  The wind was blowing (in relation to how my bus was
parked) from right side of bus to left side.  So, the next day, when I went
down to work on the bus, there was lots of snow in the driver's side of
the engine compartment.  And I mean lots.  The only thing I can think of is
that all this snow somehow caused a short circuit which blew out the
fuse.  This snow was also right before I messed around with the
speedometer but I hadn't checked all the lights between the snow and
the speedometer.  So it seems that they didn't work even before I
messed with the speedo.  Does this explanation sound plausible?  If the
fuse blows again then I guess my theory is poop but otherwise it seems
to be working so far.

Thanks to everyone for their help and all that.  It's greatly appreciated.

Sean
