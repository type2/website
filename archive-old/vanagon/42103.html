Subject: Should I Buy Syncro? '89?

Never had a vanagon -- wanna drive an occasional beach, logging road, and
more frequent snow and ice on Northwest mountain passes.

How good is 2wd?  What is difference in MPG?  Why not go syncro?

How's a 1989, GL, 63k sound?  Did they make a syncro with the jumpseat /
table arrangement?  Thanks for any help.
