Subject: 87 for sale

Hey there,
I have an 87 GL for sale in the Los Angeles area. It's got 180,000 miles
but I had the piston and heads replaced at 130,000. You know...dual
AC/heat, AM/FM cassette, 4 speed, 7 passenger. Just replaced the PS rack
and did the brakes. Always changed oil and packed the CV's.  Everything
works and I'd like to get maybe $2,500.00
 Anyone?
Thanks. John
