My 85 westy and I are enroute to Utah from NH. I am now in Philiadelphia
and all systems are going well except for the propane system. The fill
valve has an inline 10% valve that snapped off! I cannot fill the tank
because I cannot open the valve. My next stop from here is Knoxville,
about 13 hours tomorrow and then Texas. I had no luck finding a
replacement valve around here. If anyone has any suggestions I would be
very greatful. Tanks a lot!
