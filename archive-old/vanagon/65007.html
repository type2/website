Subject:      Re: Python Reman. Parts- the Source

I have the direct connection with Python too, My turnaround time has
been about 1 week from Python.

  Anyone that needs any of their parts rebuilt let me know.

  On the Fuel Pumps though, A Rebuilt one for, $99.00 verses $160.00 For
a NEW Bosch one?  I'd go with the new more than likely.
