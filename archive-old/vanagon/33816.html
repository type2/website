Syncronauts (or Wannasyncros),

I saw the following ad in the paper:

'91 Westfalia F-Cmpr SYNCRO
4x4, Priced To Sell (Vin007227)
Volks Pre-Owned 310-828-4007

I don't know what &quot;F-Cmpr&quot; means, maybe Full Camper?
I called and they answered the phone as a Lexus dealership.
I was told that the vehicle was loaded with &quot;all the options&quot;.
When I asked about PW, the answer was &quot;I'll have to check on that&quot;.
When I asked about PM, the answer was &quot;I'll have to check on that&quot;.
When I asked about AC, the answer was &quot;I'll have to check on that&quot;.
I guess having &quot;all the options&quot; doesn't mean anything.

He did say that the vehicle was Very, Very, rare and the only one he's seen.
I implied that he might think that it's a little more rare than it really is.

He did know that it has 90,000 miles and that they're asking $25,000 for it!!
I laughed out loud and said WOW!  He didn't seem moved.
So much for &quot;Priced To Sell&quot;!!......More like &quot;Priced To Steal&quot;!!

If you're interested, call them, not me.  I have no vested interest..blah,
blah, blah...
