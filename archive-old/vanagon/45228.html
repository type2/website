Subject: Re: 71 Westy Correct Exterior Color/Tent



&gt;I have heard that the 1971 Westy came in only one color,red. Is 
&gt;this true

No.  I had a white one.


&gt;Also does anyone have a factory diagram picture with any 
&gt;instructions to set up a factory tent? I have a tent, and all the 
&gt;parts seem to be there, but I have never seen one, erect, in 
&gt;person or in a picture.

I have several mid-70's ('75, 76) Campmobile owners manuals with  
diagram/instructions for the tent.  Could fax the page to you.
