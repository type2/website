Subject: Where's the gas heater go?

Having recently gotten an Eberspacher BN-4 gas heater (thanks Jeff
Schneiter), I am now trying to find out the original installation location
and details for Opie, my '68 Crew Cab pickup.  I think they went under the
rear seat on the drivers side.  Has anyone ever seen one installed?  Any
ideas on where I might find documents or manuals showing this installation?

Thanks,
Dean
