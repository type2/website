&lt;&lt; I saw an ad for this in the local paper.  Has anyone heard of this
particular type of conversion?  If so, what type is it?  Sink, stove, fridge,
pop top, etc.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, I'm new to
the list and the Vanagon.  I took one on a test drive about two weeks ago and
I'm hooked.

Can you say WIND SHEAR????  and...
I hope  your local parking garage has at least a 15 foot clearance...  :&lt;)

Yes, the Adventurewagen is the domestically converted camper with the &quot;very
tall&quot; fixed fiberglass highroof....
other than the maneuverability problems the roof creates, its not a bad
conversion.
