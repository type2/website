Subject: Re: Fix for Mass Airflow Meter '91GL

The VW mechanic at the dealer tried to 'fix' mine and it seemed to help
a little (but it never really was the real problem).  If push comes to
shove, I purchased a unit (complete metal with sensor doohickie) from a
salvage yard for $115, with 30 day warranty.  Mine is an 87, but I doubt
they changed that much.
