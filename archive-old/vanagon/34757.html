&gt;Great idea!

&gt;Pretty soon everyone will be carrying flags to identify them as part of 
&gt;this group or that...some will be carrying so many flags that they'll 
&gt;need a moveable flagstand...

Membership in different groups within a given catagory will be identified by
different colored streamers attached to the flagstaff below the flag.  The
longer your membership, the longer the streamer.
