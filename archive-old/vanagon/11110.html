Subject: Re: Window tinting



I know that this sounds horrible, but...
The garage I used to work for would suggest to people who asked how
to fix the rear defogger...
&quot;Smash the rear window, Tell insurance that it was vandalism, let insurance
replace the window.&quot;

Better yet, Remove the window yourself, tell insurance it was smashed,
etc...  Then you've got a spare when it does get vandalized.



Cheers
