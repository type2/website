A VW bus covered in &quot;hemp&quot; graphics? Why not have MTV raffle off 50 &quot;Drug
Bugs?&quot;  Sounds like a bust just waiting to happen!!! In Arizona it's five
years in the &quot;joint&quot; (Class 5 Felony) for just thinking about possesion at
any level -no kidding.  No thanks!~ (even though I understand that there is
a difference in illegal whatever and hemp products)...  I would be there
with Krylon in hand and do a thorough &quot;roach check&quot; before I left the lot.

BTW: Summer travelers passing through Arizona beware!!!
