Subject: Re: Heater motor gone?

&gt;Aunt Augusta, our 1987 Syncros, is making a horrible screeching
&gt;noise when the heat is turned on.  

&gt;a) is it possible it is NOT the heater motor itself and b) do you 
&gt;REALLY have to remove the dashboard to get at the heater motor?
&gt;

No,(well maybe) and Yes, just what you didn't want to hear.  Try running the
fan all the time, on 3 if needed to keep it spinning. Quit if it starts
popping fuses. My theory is that it is the plastic fan and housing
screeching, not the bearings, and if you can outlast the noise it will go
away.  Working so far on my '87 Syncro.  On the '85 I let the fan stay off,
and ended up pulling the dash to fix it.  Now since I let the bugger grind,
it's silent all levels now, whereas it was stalling/squawking on 1 or 2 last
year, only 3 worked, under labour.  Very cold weather may kill it however
due to plastic warping more. We'll see.  Tim Smith.
