I have replaced my diesel muffler with the original equipment part.  In
light of the fact that the muffler was not expensive (by VW standards)
and lasted over ten years, I am not sure why you would want to consider
another muffler.  Remember that the diesel muffler has to withstand a
lot of vibration, and muffle that famous (infamous?) diesel roar.  I am
not sure a generic muffler is up to that.
