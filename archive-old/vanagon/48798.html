&gt; Mine has done the same thing when I pull of the highway.  I can hit the
&gt; dash and it goes off.  joel said there was a loose connection between
&gt; some circuit.  I will put up with it.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; The oil pressure light on my '89 Vanagon is worrying me a little.  After I
&gt; &gt; have been driving on the freeway ~65-70 mph for a few miles and then slow
&gt; &gt; down to an idle (~800 RPM) the oil pressure light comes on intermittently.
&gt; &gt; If I increase the RPMs to ~1,000 the light goes off.  I've checked the oil
&gt; &gt; ..  What's the problem?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in Advance,

What brand of oil filter are you using. ? Change the brand and put in new
oil, 20/50. Let us know if the problem goes away. Tim and Joel, let's see
which filter Bo was using :)
