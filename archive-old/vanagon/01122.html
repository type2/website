Subject:      those damned hatch shocks

Last year I replaced my trunk shocks at a cost of about $60.00 (the dealer
wanted around $100.00 (?)) if I remember correctly. At Busses by the Arch, I
saw something called the LIFT LOCK on the HARVEY's van. I went to WAL MART and
got one for $6 or $7. They fit most vehicles and THEY WORK! Installation takes
all of about 2 minutes. You only need one. When you open the hatch, they lock
into place. The HARVEY's vanagon had bad hatch shocks and it kept their hatch
up. To close the hatch, you move the little arm, and close it. It takes nearly
NO EFFORT. Before you spend a wad of cash like I blindly did, check these out!
  My shocks are good but I put one on anyway. Now, even if they go bad, I
won't know it. Now... what do I do with all these little plastic parts that
came to fit other size shocks?
