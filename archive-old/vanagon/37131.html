Subject: Re: Pop top bolts

&gt;The dozen or so bolt heads on the 81's pop top have rusted and stained the
&gt;pop top. I pulled one off and spent the evening at Home Depot where I found
&gt;nothing comparable to be used as a replacement. I could sand and repaint the
&gt;existing ones, but I'm hoping that someone knows where I can find
&gt;replacements instead

I replaced the original carriage bolts with eye bolts that I bought at home
depot.  To add a finishing touch, I found a rubber seal and matching
stainless steel disk with a hole for the eye bolt to pass through so that it
looks tidy. The eye bolts can come in handy when you're camping and you want
to clip a tarp to them to make an awning.  You can also use them to secure
light cargo on your roof.
