Subject: 1.9 to 2.1?

In commenting on my 1.9 problems, several of you have mentioned the 
possibility of upgrading to a 2.1.

Does that require a different block?  Different motor accessories?  Or 
does one simply rework the 1.9?

I am still waiting for the diagnosis so I'm not too sure how bad off I am 
yet.  Hopefully, it's only a head problem.
