Subject: 84 Head Bolt/Nut leak
From: thunkler_at_juno_dot_com

After a successful 1900 mile trip.  I smelled hot antifreeze!  Yuk.  Upon
investigation, I have found a wet trail sourced at the top front and rear
head bolts on the passenger side(no apparent leak from top middle bolt). 
Guess it was that increased heat load on those steep Virginia hills. 

So if anyone's been there and done that on this,  how do I fix it??

I would also like to know the following dimensions, hopefully before I
take the headnuts off..  

1.)  Hole diameter in head for headbolts.

2.)  Diameter across threads,  and shank of head bolts.

My plan of attack is as follows:

a) Scribe a line on headnut to head for reference.
b) Take torque wrench and see what  present torque is by,
        first recording tightening&quot;breakaway&quot; torque,  then loosen 1/8
turn and tighten back           to scribed line and record that torque
c) Remove nut and stuff an o-ring of appropriate size ? into space to
stop coolant from     leaking.
d) Dry and clean the area and headnuts.

e) Use yellow &quot;dealer&quot; sealant and apply liberally to joint area and
headnut surface.

f) Torque to measured value in b above.

g) Due the same to the other leak.



I can see all kinds of potential for problems either causing more leaks
or perhaps setting the head up for cracking latter.  

Thanks,
