Subject: Corrections to Web Page
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

I revised the page at http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/  
to clearly state that the derelict is a '64, not withstanding  
some minority opinions :-).   
  
I am getting numerous parts requests from this thing, so  
if you want something, get some e-mail to me soon.  
  
 I made some other corrections and put in some additional links  
to test my ISP's &quot;only four links&quot;policy,  but the &quot;derelict&quot; link still 
seems to be broken. Just page down to see the '64.
