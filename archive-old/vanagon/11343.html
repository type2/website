Subject: Re: red rock canyon - no beauty contest

&gt;I would like to go on march 24-26 but feel that I may be out of place with my
&gt;70 westphalia that is terrible on the outside &amp; ok on the inside.
&gt; Are all the people there in immaculate restored Kombis? or are there a few
&gt;buses that need external work like mine?

We are certainly in the process of restoring our van, which wasn't treated
very nicely by DFO.
