&gt;My better and I are looking for transportation, mostly for road trips. RIght 
&gt;now in the running are:
&gt;
&gt;a) a 1971 camper, some rust, rebuilt engine and clutch,

The only two cents I can put in here is on the 71 camper.  I just made a round trip from Memphis to Syracuse NY in mine.  I will admit that I did get a bit chilly, enough for a blanket around my legs at times, but other than that, I had no problems.  At night I used a 120v electric heater, and it kept it quite toasty in there.  I might also suggest that if you do get a Westy, that you install some kind of insulation in the camper top.  It helps immensely (sp?) when driving.  I used rigid foam insulation, with the silver coating on both sides.  I cut through one side, and the insulation, and can fold it up to get it out of the way.

Good luck!!!
