&gt; &gt; He also gave me a discount on a new VW bra and tossed in that pesky
&gt; &gt;  overpriced plastic gas exhaust cover for free.
&gt; 
&gt; What's a &quot;pesky overpriced plastic gas exhaust cover&quot;  ??

If you have access to the VW Camper Owner's Manual, you will find a picture of
this round plastic cover for the refrig gas exhaust. The purpose is to keep
water, dirt and bugs out of that mechanism. Thus no spider webs, no water in
the pilot to hamper lighting it, etc. It really works nicely as a protection
device.

These should have always been included with the camper. The manual acts as tho
they always were-but I have NEVER bought one with the cover on it. I have been
told that many dealers either didn't receive them on the Westy when they were
delivered or removed them because most people &quot;simply take it off and toss it
away&quot; People didn't realize what a blessing they could be for protecting the
gas exhaust area.

I keep mine on all of the time when not using the refrig. It is especially
useful in rainy conditions, when washing you Westy in one of those &quot;do it
yourself&quot; carwashes while out on a long trip (if you expect to get the pilot
going well again), and in very dusty conditions. They usually cost $16-$17
if you have to replace them - but I personnaly think they are worth the cost.
I have had difficulty getting the gas to run smoothly whenever water gets
into the exhaust pipes. I, personally, would not like to be without one on
a long or rainy trip.
