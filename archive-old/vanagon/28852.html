My name is Peter, and I now live in New Jersey.  As for campers, this is 
probably the best time of year to look.  Newsday usually has a good 
selection but as is the case anywhere, the nice ones move fast.  For a good 
rot free camper look south to the Carolina's.  I looked for about nine 
months up and down the East Coast before I found the right one for my budget 
and condition requirements.

Good Luck Hunting
PEJ
