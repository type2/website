Subject: Type IV / FI questions

Hi everybody

FRANK : please send me that postscript file, I'll see what I can 
decipher. But I'm not familiar with the rest of the Vanagon, so you'll 
have to tell me where the wires connect.

OK, so here's the scene. I've just recently stuck a Type IV, 1700, 411 
engine in my fibreglass beetle based car. I'm using the later swing axle 
gearbox (With the guide around the input shaft) with a spacer under the 
throw-out bearing. No smog equipment, we still use leaded.

1. The engine idles terribly. Hunts from just fast enough not to stall 
up to 1200 rpm. I had the car to the &quot;experts&quot;, and I am totally 
dischuffed with their total lack of professionalism and/or knowledge. The 
way I see it, the engineers put that little pot on the FI box there for a 
reason. These guys turned it fully clockwise. I _think_ this is 
&quot;richest&quot;. They also dyno'd the engine, and got 40kW at the wheels. This 
engine is 'sposed to do closer to 80kW. When I turn the pot closed to the 
0, the hunting gets worse, but I have a lot more power. I can almost get 
rid of the hunting by turning the pot fully clockwise and raising the 
idle a bit. But then I have no power. Oh yes, it's better when the engine 
is hot.

2. I have a strange vibration at 2500 rpm, especially gearing down. I've 
recently rebuilt the engine, completely. I didn't replace the guide 
bearing in the crankshaft. Could this be it, could it be the box (from a 
scrap yard), any other ideas?

So if anyone has an idea, please let me know.
