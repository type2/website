Subject: 5-cyls in a Vanagon?  Which ones?
Date: Wed, 6 Apr 94 9:57:57 CDT

Hi-

A recent post mentioned something about a 5-cylinder engine in a later
vanagon.  Is this a stock engine for the later models?  I always felt 
that my 77 bus with the 2.0l 4 was pretty underpowered, and am hesitant
to get a wasserboxer, but I would like to buy a newer vanagon this fall,
after I get back to the US.  I currently have an Audi Coupe, which has the
NA 5-cyl engine which I like very much.  I think a vanagon with the Audi
5, especially the turbo version with ~165 bhp would be pretty reasonable.
What can you all tell me about this?  Thanks.
