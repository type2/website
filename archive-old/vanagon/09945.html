Subject:      for your entertainment ... a short story

ok, kiddies: a true story ...

my brother worked as a mechanic at a vw/porsche repair shop. one day, a fellow
brings his jetta into the shop, complaining that the speedometer is broken.

like any good mechanic, my brother begins his diagnosis of the problem:
take it for a test drive and see what is wrong. unable to see that the gauge
is doing anything wrong ... the odometer turns, the trip odometer turns, and
the needle indicates the mph ... he decides the fellow must have meant that
it was mis-registering. the test drive now continues up on the interstate,
where the speed is clocked by a stop watch. the results show the speedo to
be only 1 mph off at 60 mph, well within specifications.

back to the shop, call the customer: what exactly is supposed to be wrong
with this thing?  well, says the customer, it must be broken; when i'm doing
60 mph, everybody else is passing me like i'm standing still!!

:)

ok, if you still didn't get it, everybody in birmingham drives 70-75 mph on
the highways. ;)

anyway, my brother says that was the LAST time he started working on a car
BEFORE getting the specifics about exactly what was supposed to be wrong. ;)
