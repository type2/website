ia m a semiphore idiot

but gee, aren't they fun?   not that anyone actually SEES them, or if they do
knows what they are.....  but

if they do see you use them they sure have a funny look on their face

almost as good as when this guy saw me crank start the 54

&quot;you didn't do what i thought you did&quot;  he said, with mouth hanging open.
          :)


I'll check the winkers on the 54 and let you all know the stats on what s
original for that.   i do remember that they are much easier to find that the
obscure 'grooved' semiphores.  the 54 ones have a flat black cover to them,
and an orange lens.  SWF,  i think.

my semaphore guru was in a bad accident and is still recovering   :(    send
your best wishes to Jeff Slater, who is a real neat guy.
