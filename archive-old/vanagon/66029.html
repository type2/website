Subject:      Re: Dometic fan cycle question

&gt; Our Dometic fridge fan in our '85 Westy, when running
on A/C, seems to
&gt; cycle alot.  It goes on for about 5 seconds then off for about 10 seconds
&gt; and repeats this for what seems like an eternity, especially when your
&gt; trying to sleep.  Is this normal or should it run longer in the cycles?
&gt; It doesn't seem to make any difference how warm or cold it is outside.
&gt; It may do this also when running on propane, I just haven't noticed.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for &quot;V-Wisdom&quot;

I've had the same experience with my '91 - though more commonly on
propane.  It seems unusual - I would expect the on/off cycle to be longer
- but it happens.  And yes, the noise can be annoying!  However, with my
'91 the cycling usually quits when the outside air temp drops down to
about 50F.

For those ambitious, or particularly bothered by the fan noise, the fridge
can be removed and the fan replaced.  Those small fans produced for
cooling electronic equipment tend to be much quieter than the standard
Dometic fan included with the fridge.  To maximize the benefit, the fan
should be mounted with some sort of vibration isolation device - rubber
grommets, etc. to prevent the fan vibrations from resonating through the
fridge walls.
