Hi, all

Just got a couple of windshield cracks repaired the
other day; I guess my karma took a turn for the
worse and 'got two rock chips within a span of 10
days.

Anyway, as I was pondering life about the first crack
(and watching it spread across the windshield in the
process), I got another one on the way home.

So, I had called around and the concensus is that if the
length of the crack is greater than the diameter of a 
quarter, windshield repairers don't want to fix them.
&quot;Replace the windshield...&quot;   =  $$$  ($400+ for an
EV, installed).

OK, so I realize that all I need to pay is the deductible,
blah,blah,blah, BUT, I wanted to hang onto the original
windshield as long as possible on the outside chance that
the MGs (as Tim P. likes to call them) mess up and I end
up with a leaky seal.

Long story short, this one fellow agrees to look at the
cracks (a 7 incher, and a small little 0.5 incher) and
manages to stop further progress of the cracks by drilling
a couple of small holes through the glass and then forcing
a resin bonding agent into the gap in the glass and fusing
the glass back together.  The end result is that the outline
of the original crack is still there, but you REALLY have to
look to notice it, and the total cost was $75, which I'm 
checking to see if insurance will cover (waive the deductible).

If you're pondering life w/ a small crack, don't think about
it too long, as it really is better to try and fix them when
they're small because they're less likely to split on you
later on.
