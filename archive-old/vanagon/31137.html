Subject:       Vanagon Verified

Hey all:

I have to share my elation with the list.

I took my 84 Vanagon to go get verified for California EPA (and avoid 
the $500 non-Cali charge. Mind you, I wasn't sure if it was a Cali 
car or not, I couldn't find the sticker)

I went in, lifted, the engine door and the inspector went to work 
with a flashlight, rag and pen. It felt just like taking a driver's 
test for the first time. When he fianlly handed my the piece of 
paper, I asked if it was a California EPA car. He mumbled and walked 
off. 

It was! I'm going to frame that verification reciept. This is a 
Christmas gift indeed..
