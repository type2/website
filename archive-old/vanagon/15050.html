&gt; G'day, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; Just found that the right inboard brake piston is leaking
&gt; around the boot. I just rebuilt these a couple of months
&gt; ago. Grr. Anyway, I'd like a show of hands from those of
&gt; you who think a new set of seals will do the trick, and from
&gt; those pessimists who think a new caliper is in order.

I priced the rebuild kits recently, they were about $20/side.  Kind of
expensive, but I don't think the seals are available separately.  If
they are, I'd like to know about it.

Oh, I think new seals would do the trick, as long as the pistons are not
loose in the bores.
