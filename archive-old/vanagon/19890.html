Subject:       Debate: Freeze Plugs in Fan Shroud!

Well, it's summer here in Utah, and the old VW's are running hotter 
that I'd like.

A friend put Freeze Plugs (1 5/8&quot;) in the holes in the fan shroud 
where the hose to the heat exchangers usually go.  The theory: 

&quot;it keeps the air up in the shroud where it is needed--by the oil 
cooler.&quot;

I take the bus to 20 year VW mechanic friend.

&quot;Get those freeze plugs out of there, and put the heater hose back 
on.  That will solve some of your over-heating problem.&quot;


I tend to agree with theory number one.  It seems to make more sense 
to me.

What do all you experts think?
