Greetings all
	thanks again to those who responded to my last postings
regarding looking for a used/reman. engine.
	I am still looking for a reman. engine and I think that
i found a decent place to get one.  The shop is called Action
Volkswagon or AVP.  I have called numerous places looking for
reman. longblocks and they seem to be the most trustworthy.AVP
has
longblocks with the same warranty as VW ,12mo. 12k mi., for
$1600 with a core charge of $600.  I inquired about their core
charge and they said if i haven't thrown a rod or anything and
the heads aren't useless (my mech. says they can be
re-machined) that i will most certainly get the core back. The
core charge is what makes me a little skeptical about the other
engine sources, especially those with a $1600 engine and a
$1200 core charge. 
	Has anyone dealt with AVP in this regard or any other
companies.  I know about GEX and some others.
Advice, experience and tips are much appreciated.
thanks
seamus
