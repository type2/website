&gt;I am in the process of trying to fit a new front cable for the hand brake
&gt;on an '82
&gt;Vanagon and have come up against something smack in the middle above the
&gt;gas tank that will not allow the cable to slide freely forwards or

the microfiche shows a 'guide bracket' in there. you might have better luck
if you removed that rubber grommet (in the floor of the bus, behind the
handle, where the cable disappears into the underfloor), and then tried to
feed the cable in backwards from underneath the car ... i.e., feed the
handle end up toward the drivers seat. at least that way, you might be able
to see the guide bracket and feed the cable through it. just a thought.

however ... one of the things i've noticed about german cars is that the
designers seem to plan on you 'peeling' the car like an onion to fix things,
then putting it all back together again. i wouldn't doubt but what you wind
up having to remove or at least lower the gas tank. good luck.
