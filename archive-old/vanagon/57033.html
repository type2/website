How many of us here are the original owners of our Vanagons? Post me
directly -- include the year -- I'll count 'em up and post in a few days.

&gt;VW no
&gt;longer actively sells busses in the US, and the survey was for the 
&gt;long-discontinued Vanagon.  I think VW never really understood the market
&gt;or marketing in the US -- the vehicles more often sold in spite of their
&gt;marketing than because of it.

I was SO pissed when I went into a VW dealer to purchase a shiny brand new
Vanagon, only to learn they'd been discontinued the year before. So I'm
still driving my '82 ...
