Subject: Re: new heads


&gt;I'm gonna be doing new (rebuilt) heads here in a couple of days,
&gt;any suggestions for other things to check/replace? Thanks.


Eddie,

Check the height of the valve stems.  They should be all the same.  Small
difference lead to big changes in the rate of wear on that valve's powertrain
(cam lobe, lifter, rocker, etc)  For equal wear you want equal height.  This
is achieved by having that valve stem ground.  Don't overdo it.  If one valve
is really low, like .125&quot; or more, send the heads back -- it needs a new
valve seat.

Dismantle the heads after checking stem height.  Inspect the valves, guides
and seats.  If all okay, lap-in the valves, clean up the abrasive,
re-assemble and check.  Install stem seals when reassembling.  All real FLAPS
carry stem seals, chain-store FLAPS will just give you a silly look.

Get a 50cc syringe from a vet or pharmacy, level the head and do a rough
check of the chamber volume.  The object is to get a reasonably accurate idea
of their volume.  Do all four.  Take their average.  Use it when computing
your compression ratio.  (If the chamber is larger than 50cc, put a  marble
in it.  Use the same marble in all four chambers.)

Measure your deck height and compute your compression ratio.  Make sure your
compression ratio isn't too high.  Anything over 7.3:1 is liable to have
trouble with today's fuels.  If too high, add a spacer under the cylinder.
 If you don't have the formulas handy, ask me.

If either deck height or chamber volume varies radically, you'll have to do
something about it.  If that is beyond your skills, use the largest chamber
volume and the smallest deck height when computing your compression ratio.

Check all of the studs.  (There are eight of them on a Type I head.)  Check
the spark plugs threads.  Check for cracks where the guides are installed,
both in the valve gallery and in the intake &amp; exhaust ports.  Any crack is
grounds for rejection.  Ditto for any bad stud.  If you have a bad spark plug
thread, reject the head.  Helicoils or sleeves are not an acceptable repair
when it comes to spark plug since they upset the heat flow.

Check the valve cover sealing surface for nicks &amp; gouges.  Using a mill-cut
fill pressed lightly against the sealing surface, make the surface truly
flat.  Champer the edges.  Spend a little time here and you'll seldom be
bothered by leaky valve covers.

Check for casting flash in the fins around the exhaust stacks.  Use long
drills to open up the passages.  This is the hottest part of your engine, you
want to make damn sure it cools as it was meant to.

Check to insure the metal deflector plate is installed in the lower part of
the fins between the combustion chambers.  If it is missing, the heads will
overheat wildly, it is a very critical little piece of tin.  You can make one
or pick one up from a junkyard.

If the heads pass the above inspections they are good enough to use or to do
further work upon.  You can polish the chambers if you wish.  It will improve
the efficiency by some small factor.  If you have the tools you may wish to
do a bit of porting, although it's a good idea to practice on junkers.  Check
Bill Fisher's &quot;How to Hotrod Volkswagen Engines&quot; for basic porting
instructions.  The photos are invaluable.
