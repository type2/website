Subject: EV 95 vs. EV 97


We were on our way south to Los Angeles in our 95 EV Camper
before Christmas, when lo and behold an 97 Camper passed us
as we are about to climb the Tejon Pass grade. Not wanting
to miss an opportunity to post to the list, I tried to
keep up with the 97 up the 6% grade to see if the VR6 had any
performance advantage versus the inline 5.

Our top speed on that hill was 60 mph in 3rd gear (automatic.)
They didn't seem to slow down from their approximated 75 mph
and lost us with no effort...
