Subject: Re: HEATERS [and asbestos]

Bob, I don't think there is asbestos in the insulating cover of the
heater tube on a '69.  I was disconcerted, however, to discover a
couple of weeks ago that the insert that protects the plastic 
joining sleeve from the heater box IS asbestos.  And that is on the
*inside* of the pipe along with that nice lukewarm air we breathe.

Be careful when removing and installing the engine not to munge these
insulators and make asbestos dust.
