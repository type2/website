Subject: Bentley Manuals 1980 Vanagon Camper

What is the group's opinion on the Bentley manual set for the 1980 Vanagon Camper.  I have the Muir and the Haynes manuals and they are both good.  However 
sometimes I  feel like something is missing in some of the procedures.  Please assist before I lay out the &quot;bread&quot; as Muir said in his book.

Thanks all...
