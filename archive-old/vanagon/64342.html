&gt; Whatever you replace your stock 4&quot; speakers with be certain to check for
&gt; window crank clearance and that the speaker cover doesn't smash into the

Hi It is possible to bend the crank handles out a little. I had to do
that after installing some 4&quot; Clarion speakers (the thinist I could
find) The Clarions made a world of difference from the stockers. Could
use a little more bass in the rear though.
