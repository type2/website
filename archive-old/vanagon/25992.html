&gt;In my '73 T2 ownersmanual i see this padded dashboard.
&gt;In the Dutch '75 salesbrochure VW calls it the &quot;safety dashboard&quot;.
&gt;I'd like to know more about these.
&gt;I have seen only one in person in a '68 or'69
&gt;Is this part considered to be rare in the US? or maybe
&gt;even stock on certain year(s) US models?

I think that all buses in the US had only the padded dashboard from '69 on.
&gt;From what I've heard, the European models offered this as an option with
the painted steel dashboard as stock.  My '73 has the padded dashboard.

&gt;If a car was so equipped would that show on the M-codes Tag?

I guess, as other options were so identified.

&gt;Was it only available in combination with (or without) something
&gt;else or was it part of a package?

If you bought a bus in the US after '68, you got the padded dashboard
whether you wanted it or not.  No choice was available (to my knowledge).


On another topic...seats.
You mentioned that your front seats are a single seat for the driver and
a bench the rest of the way across the front cab.  I had never seen
this configuration until this weekend.  I saw a nice looking '72 9-seater
bus on a used car dealer's lot.  The spare tire fits under the front seat
to leave room for packages in the rear.


Take care,
