Subject: Re: Gas heater


&gt;&gt; &gt;The gas heater in my '75 Westy is not performing well.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Can anyone furnish me with a schematic and some instructions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Try JB Heater Service, 303-660-9032. He has been fixing gas heaters
&gt;&gt; for years, and may be able to get or recommend sources for literature.
&gt;
&gt;       How hostile is he to people who call up and
&gt;       ask if he has a gas heater available for sale?


Not the least bit. I talked to him a few years ago, if it's the same guy.
He's knowledgeable, friendly, and more than happy to take your money.
He had heaters for sale then, and probably still does.
