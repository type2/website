Subject: RE: 83 Vanagon Water Cooled Camper-HELP

I'd be inclined to put in a post '85 wasserboxer motor as the reliability seems 
to have been historically better in the '86&amp;&gt; models and it would probably be 
the simplest upgrade....  You'll need to make sure that you have compatible 
electronics to run this new motor, but we've had pretty good luck (KNOCK ON 
WOOD) with our '90 Syncro Westie with 56K miles of primarily city driving (Mtn 
View, CA area).

PS:I may be sorry I said this by Monday...  If murphy's law and all of the 
associated corrollaries hold true, I may be eating my words by then....



My Camper is sick. Joel was kind enough to answer my plea for information
resources and told me about this list. Thanks in advance for all the
wonderful support and interesting stuff I anticipate here. 
 
I am a single woman, some science training, but no mechanical experience.
My father was an auto mechanic who would never answer my questions about
what &amp; why and sent me to the kitchen to do the dishes whenever I asked too
many questions (which was always). I have rebelled ever since. This is my
Final rebellion and I need HELP! 
 
Pep boys in Santa Maria said we had a blown engine when my daughter got
stranded there. I live in the Bay area north of San Francisco, so we towed
it home. Upon inspection, with the help of my technical advisor  Alex
Ramsay, I am getting educated. Obeying his every command (suggestions
really) I took out the push rods of 2 cylinders. I saw what they were
supposed to look like on one, and on the other (offending member) there was
a portal with ragged metal around where the lifter should be. Alex suggests
that we do not have the raw material to rebuild this engine. I have been
getting VW magazines to find what options are available. I have come up
with the following and would like comments, suggestions, tales of
experience and/or advice. 
1.) Put in another 83 waterboxer engine    
    pros-it will fit easily 
    cons-this engine has problems  
               they are expensive ($1800-1500 price range I've found with
core return) 
2.) Put in a different engine 
         pros-better engine 
                   cons-conversion kit needed, possible heating
modifications,  no manual to                       follow-new territory etc
etc etc 
                            Pinto-1971 
                           Jetta     
                           Porsch 911 are possibles that have been
suggested. 
 Where to get conversion kits &amp; instructions???? 
 
I don't want a suped up vehicle but I plan on keeping it a long time. I
really like its versatility.  I want to learn and I want a good result
without too much frustration. We do not have a great workshop to work in
either, I live in a condo with a carport. We have the Bently manual and
Alex has done this sort of thing before, so my advisor is trusted once we
decide what to do (I hope). 
 
Please tell me everything I need to know. Recommend a place to buy the
engine if you can that is reliable and low cost. I will be grateful and may
even send cookies (I know how to do that!) Thanks.
