Subject: Idling Problems 87 GL

Volks,
'87 GL auto exhibits:
1) idles fine when cold at say 880 rpm
2) idles at 2,200 or so rpm when warmed up
It just started doing this within the last two weeks. The weather has
been hot and cold (Texas Gulf Coast). Is the electric idle stablizer the
place to begin, or where? I read some other volks having similiar
probs-any feedback is appreciated if having similar probs and have
corrected. 
Regards
