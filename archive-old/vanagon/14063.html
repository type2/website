Subject: pop-top convert???

okay everyone, I'm sure this has been asked before, but, here goes:

	how difficult, expensive, general-pain-in-the-ass, is it to convert
a standard microbus (mine is a '77) to a westy?  Specifically, if I can
find a late '70's top (I'd get new seals of course) can it be done?
I'm not to thrilled at the idea of chain-sawing my roof if it won't be
right, ya' know? 

thanks,
nick
