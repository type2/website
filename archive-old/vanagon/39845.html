Subject: very loosely related to VW's and the net-but funny

Hey now,
        This is very loosely related to the list, but it was so funny I
couldn't resist posting it. We aircooleds somewhat resemble the 2.5
lawnmower motors-assembled at home... Have fun.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Think of the Internet as a highway.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There it is again.  Some clueless fool talking about the &quot;Information
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Superhighway.&quot;  They don't know didley about the net.  It's nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like a superhighway.  That's a rotten metaphor.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose the metaphor ran in the other direction.  Suppose the highways
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were like the net. . .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A highway hundreds of lanes wide.  Most with pitfalls for potholes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Privately operated bridges and overpasses.  No highway patrol.  A
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couple of rent-a-cops on bicycles with broken whistles.  500 member
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vigilante posses with nuclear weapons.  A minimum of 237 on ramps at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;every intersection.  No signs.  Wanna get to Ensenada?  Holler out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the window at a passing truck to ask directions.  Ad hoc traffic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;laws.  Some lanes would vote to make use by a single-occupant-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle a capital offense on Monday through Friday between 7:00 and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;9:00.  Other lanes would just shoot you without a trial for talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on a car phone.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AOL would be a giant diesel-smoking bus with hundreds of ebola
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;victims on board throwing dead wombats and rotten cabbage at the other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cars, most of which have been assembled at home from kits.  Some are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;built around 2.5 horsepower lawnmower engines with a top speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of nine miles an hour.  Others burn nitrogylcerin and idle at 120.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No license plates.  World War II bomber nose art instead.  Terrifying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paintings of huge teeth or vampire eagles.  Bumper mounted machine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;guns.  Flip somebody the finger on this highway and get a white
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;phosphorus grenade up your tailpipe.  Flatbed trucks cruise around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with anti-aircraft missile batteries to shoot down the traffic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;helicopter.  Little kids on tricycles with squirtguns filled with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hydrochloric acid switch lanes without warning.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NO OFFRAMPS.  None.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now that's the way to run an Interstate Highway system.

Peace,
