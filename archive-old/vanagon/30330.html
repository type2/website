Subject: Re: exhaust gaskets + permatex?


&gt; &gt; easier. Permatex (you guys are talking about the brown colored I hope) is 
&gt; &gt; also perfect for the sealing of the two halves of an aircooled engine 
&gt; &gt; because as we all know there's no gasket for this. It should also be fine 
&gt; 
&gt; You are not talking about silicon I hope.  Silicon on the case halves is 
&gt; bad news.  It does a fine job of sealing but it squirts out and get pinched 
&gt; off when you put the case together.  These beads get loose and can wreak 
&gt; all sorts of havoc.  Leads to plugged oil passages/coolers etc.

No I'm not talking about silicon. Permatex is a glue and I don't believe 
they have the same properties. You can buy silicons, etc. in  many 
different colors. What I was saying is that the BROWN permatex glue is 
close to the actual stuff used in the factory.
