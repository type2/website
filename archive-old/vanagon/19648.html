Yo,
	I went back and looked at that bug again.

	It has a steel sliding sunroof.  I couple of dents in places.
All of the interior is there, except the piece underneath the back
window is quite ratty.  The headliner and panels looked good, and the seats
looked good, too.  The interior is red and white, and the car is grey
(those Oakleys distorted my color vision!)

	It has some bondo on the passenger side 1/4, above the fender
(classic bondo area)

	It also looks like it took a mild bump on the front left side of the apron
where the bumper support goes in.

	All in all, this would be an excellent project bug - all the pieces are
there 'cept for the emblem!

Thom
