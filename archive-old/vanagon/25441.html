Subject:       Re: Brakework problem/hypothesis

&gt; my master cylinder then proceeded to empty itself over a preriod of
&gt; merely a few hours, and all 4 tires were covered with the tell-tale
&gt; drips.
&gt; Needless to say, I had a rather thrilling trip home, and back, where my
&gt; new parts are waiting.
&gt; Anyway, I was just curious as to whether anyone else had had such a
&gt; gross reaction to a &quot;fix&quot;. 

Wild!

I replaced the front hoses on my '57 a month or so ago.  Prior to 
doing so I was getting rather eratic braking on various wheels.  
After replacing them it worked great.  Like that helped you or 
anything.

Do you know if any of the wheel cylinders have been replaced before.  
If not, it was probably time anyhow.

The only way you would have all blow would be for your old hoses to 
have been almost totally constricted, and the new ones to allow a 
lot of pressure.  In that case, your braking power before would have 
had to be almost nothing. 

Odd.
