Subject:      Watertank cap

A while ago someone posted a query trying to find the water tank cap (the one
under the chasis) for a Westfalia.

I just got one at the local VW dealer - (got a luggage rack cleat too, but
that is a different story.)

For $18 you get a cap, rubber washer, and a nice plastic bag with a &quot;Genuine
Westfalia&quot; logo on it.

If anyone is curious, the cap PN is: 255 070 802B
                                    cleat PN is: 231 067 949
