       Auxiliary Fuel Tanks -- How They Performed


Part of my preparation for the Inuvik run was to design,
fabricate and install a pair of 15 gallon saddle tanks for my 1965
Microbus.  I also replaced my stock 10.7 gallon fuel tank
with one from a 1972 breadloaf, upping my total fuel capacity
to about 45 gallons.

One of the objectives of the Kansas City trip was to see how well
the tanks performed.  Generally, they did very well.  They did
not leak, which was the first consideration, and they allowed me
to drive all day without refueling.

The only problems I encountered with the new tanks were due to
poor design on my part.  Initially, I laid out a rectangular tank
and had the material bent to that pattern.  But when I began
assembling the tanks I realized the space into which the tanks
were meant to fit is not a perfect rectangle due to the kink in
the frame of the bus back near the rear jacking point.  This
forced me to modify the shape of the tanks, cutting a wedge-
shaped gore in each tank about 1-1/2&quot; wide by 14&quot; long, and to
modify the end panel and one internal baffle accordingly.  This
modification must take into account the left/right nature of the
tanks.  Other than that error, fabrication was straight-forward
and relatively easy, thanks to the use of a plasma-arc torch that
sliced the sixteen gauge steel with remarkable ease and accuracy.

A lesser problem was encountered when using the tanks.  With the
tanks full, in some attitudes I could get a burp of gasoline out
of the fuel tank vents.  Apparently I did not provide sufficient
head in the anti-siphon loop of vent-line tubing.  This should be
easy to rectify since the 3/8&quot; aluminum vent lines, two per tank,
are secured with push-on rubber tubing.

An annoyance was the amount of time I had to spend with my
thumb against the fuel transfer button.  Transfer takes place at
the rate of half a gallon a minute meaning I had to keep my thumb
on the button a total of an hour each day.  I'll replace the push
button with a toggle switch, plus add a blinking light to remind
me the thing is on.

Getting the last gallon of fuel out of the saddle tanks called
for the nose of the bus to be higher than the rear of the tanks
and, ideally, for the passenger side to be lower than the
driver's side.  These conditions could usually be found simply by
running nearer the shoulder while ascending a slope but in Kansas
I had to use the kerbing at a rest stop to achieve the proper
attitude.  The pump makes a different sound running dry.

In most cases I never completely emptied the fuel tanks since my
longest day's run on the Kansas City trip -- 810 miles -- did not 
consume all of the fuel on board.  I ended that
day with the main tank three-quarters full -- about two hundred
miles of driving -- and an estimated seven gallons in the saddle
tanks, of which at least five was transferrable.  When 'empty'
each saddle tank actually contains about a gallon of fuel trapped
below the level of the transfer port due to the geometry of the
tank and fitting.

Two vents per tank are needed because the tops of the tanks are
perfectly flat and the tanks contain three internal baffles.  The
vents go to opposite upper corners of the tanks insuring there
will be no air trapped during filling.

The fuel tanks were fabricated from 16 gauge hot-rolled steel. 
Each tank is fastened to the chassis of the vehicle at eight
points using 1/4&quot; bolts through welded fittings.  Each tank is
provided with an inlet 1-1/2&quot; in diameter.  The inlets of the
tanks are common with a welded T-pipe leading to the filler neck,
which is a modified aircraft fuel tank fitting.  The common
plumbing is connected with Neoprene hose with two clamps at each
joint.

The fuel transfer pump is a commonly available Facet electric
fuel pump.  A fuel filter having a replaceable element is
installed between the pump and the saddle tanks.  Both the pump
and the filter are installed within the cage of the vehicle's
frame and are protected with shields.  The outlet of the transfer
pump is plumbed to one of the two vents on the late-model fuel
tank.  The second vent serves its normal purpose, vented via an
anti-siphon loop installed above the level of the tank in the
left louver-well of the engine compartment, exiting below the
vehicle through a grommeted hole in the left rear fender well.

After welding, the tanks were pressure-tested to 15psi using
special seals and fittings fabricated for that purpose.  Fifteen
pounds per square inch is far more than any rectangular fuel tank
will ever be subjected to in normal service.  The purpose of such
an extreme test was to verify the structural integrity of the
internal baffles, the upper flanges of which are secured to the
tops of the tanks by rosette welds through the tank top.  At that
pressure a number of minor leaks were revealed.  In each case the
bead was ground down and the leak rewelded although the leaks
were so small they would of been sealed when the tanks were
sloshed.  

After pressure testing the interior of the tanks was etched with
acid, the etchant neutralized and the interiors sealed with
sloshing compound.  

The tanks are inset between the body sill and frame with their
tops against the three traverse frame members between the jacking
points.  The traverse frame members are approximately two inches
wide by fourteen inches long giving a contact area of 87 square
inches.  Because of their robust construction and interior
baffles, the tanks are strong enough to support the weight of the
vehicle.

The raw material for the fuel tanks cost about $60, the shearing
and bending, done at a shop experienced with fuel tank
fabrication, cost $140.  I did all of the welding, fabrication
and assembly using exhaust pipe tubing for the inlet fittings,
welding the necessary T- and L- fittings.  Vent lines in the tank
are 7/16&quot; diameter mild steel tubing.  Outlets are 1/4&quot; NPT on
welding flanges fabricated here in the shop.  Total weight of
tanks and fittings is about 83 pounds.

While the real purpose of the tanks is yet to be tested I found
the ability to fill up in the morning and drive all day to be a
convenience.  With the stock tank I could seldom go more than 200
miles before the needle would nudge the big 'E'.  Even with the
larger 15 gallon tank from the '72 breadloaf my unrefueled range
would have been no more than 400 carefully driven miles.  Now, I
wait until the gauge sez half-full then lean on the button for
eight or nine minutes, bringing the gauge back to three-quarters. 
To keep track of the transfers, I move a nail from one slot in
the dash to another.  When I've moved the nail four times I've
transfered between twenty and twenty-five gallons of fuel -- and
have been driving all day.  If I keep the speed under 50 mph I
have an unrefueled range of about 1,200 miles.
