Actually, I think I've decided that what I was thinking actually might be 
crazy, but I'm going to do some measurements first.  The heat pump idea 
doesn't appeal to me, nor will it work here.  At temperatures of 40-45 
here, we usually open our windows and enjoy the warm summer air &lt;grin&gt;.  
We usually like the heat when it gets below freezing and the windows 
start frosting up (some people still like their windows open to enjoy the 
air &lt;big smile&gt;).
The reason it doesn't appeal to me is that I've got a very large, 
inefficient heat engine in the back of this box, and to use THAT 
inefficiency to produce heat that already exists doesn't seem reasonable 
to me.  All I want to do is circulate water (already pumped too) so that 
the back seats get a little warmth.  I like the idea of buying any heat 
exchanger with a fan and installing it under the back seat.  I don't 
really need the VW one, I wouldn't think.  I might still pull the A/C and 
use the fan in it.  Who knows, I may just leave it and suffer ... ok, I 
guess it'll be the kids who do the suffering.
