Subject: CIS fuel injection

My 1985 Vanagon crew cab has had the normal digijet injection replaced 
by CIS injection from a pre 80 rabbit.  This was done by a previous
owner after (I believe) an engine fire.  The truck starts well and runs
very smoothly but does have a lot of non original parts.  There is no
brain, no oxygen sensor: the system is very simple.  Mileage on the
highway is around 19mpg. 
Has anyone else tried this on a vanagon?
