Subject: The 59 single cab is mine!! add it to the list!!

Hello all

Last week I picked up the 59 single cab!!  Very little rust!! But there is
one dent that will require attention. I have spare side gates and rear gates
and I am curious what they are worth (they are in pretty good shape, a
couple of small rust holes) Also a bunch of glass. I am looking for
windscreen glass, if I cant get some soon I am getting saftey glass cut.

Anyway I am really exited about this project and I am looking forward to
valuable advice from others on the list.

Take care

p.s. My brother has moved down here (raleigh nc) to help me with this
project, he may be emailing question from my address, his name is troy.
