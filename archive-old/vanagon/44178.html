Well... he could get some used rotors off of a bus in the junk yard, but
they'd probably be fairly worn down.  I have some from the '80 Vanagon I
cut apart that only have about 18k miles on them, but I wouldn't want to
mail them.  And when dealing with brakes... it's alway nice to have new
parts.
 
&gt; &gt;what my mechanic informed me he said new brake pads will be $40/pair,
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds a little high.

Yeah, the repair shops like charging ful retail for parts.  The best deal
for someone is to do thier own brakes.  Just go to your local parts
place...  buy the parts, and do it yourself.
