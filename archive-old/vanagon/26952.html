Personally i'd like to mount 50 cal machine guns on the front and rear of 
my car.  then instead of instantly vaporizing the idiots around you, you 
can fire short burts that will slowly pick away the car around them.  I 
imagine it would be very satisfying to see little pieces of car flying 
away from those idiots, esp those who don't believe a bus can go fast (or 
at least think they can stop fast) and pull out in front of you from a 
side street.
