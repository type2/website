Ok here's one for ya!

I was at Bugformance today, the one on El Camino in Sacramento.  A
friend of mine ('61 double cab, BTW) were getting parts during lunch.

I'm wandering aroudn while he's discussing the finer points of fuel lines
with the due when I spot these dual port manifolds that didn't seem
wuite right.

Upon close inspection, they were USED and painted over, and with a 
laser-printed, home-made, factory looking sticker.

$50!!!!  Thats right, fifty freakin dollars!  

How can I tell they are used?  Carbon buildup in the pre-heater tube!
Some bozo spray painted them a sorta-factory gray, and not even a good job
at that!

Makes me wonder what other rip-offs are out there!
