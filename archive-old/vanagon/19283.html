Rev. counter = tachometer, no?  I'd like one for my '70 Kombi--which one 
fits in that (unused) clock-hole??  Does VDO ($$) have one that fits?

&gt; There have been a series of discussions re max revs, and temperatures.
&gt; What is a sensible max rpm for cruising

Muir sez:  keep yer revs between 2000 and 3500

&gt; what is the danger point on cylinder head temp for #3?

I run about 350-400F on the freeways, in the city 250-300F, depending on 
climbing (lotsa climbing here, what about in your locale?)  

&gt; What should the oil temp be?
&gt; What is a reasonable gas mileage, I seem to be averaging about 18mpg?

18 seems low, but your Westie is heavier than my Kombi.  I get about 
19-24mpg, depending on the type of driving.  

&gt; If anyone has a reasonable viewpoint please let me know.

Hope this helps.  I'm running a 1600DP.  And yours?
