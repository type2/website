hmm...about making you rown..

i really need to call my brother and get the infro from the artical..:)

but, the artical gave a recommened min. gause rating, and spcil ANGEL it 
must be at to provide the right &quot;thing&quot;

but, if you are gonna do it, i'd recommend doing it say...right on the 
end of that fuel filter...just prefilter side, right on the nipple...so, 
when you chang ehte filter, you get rid of the &quot;stuff&quot; to..:)

i think ill phone home and get me bro workin on it...david
