Subject: F.S. more alloy wheels for vanagon

Help me - I've been deluged with Vanagon alloy wheels!!,  I am also selling , in
addition to the complete set of &quot;carat&quot; alloy wheels, my set of 4 Audi turbo
alloy wheels which have had the centers machined to fit the Vanagon/bus hubs and
have the same 5 lug bolt pattern. These also come with center caps and elongated
bolts for the front and elongated studs for the rear. For those who are unaware
of what these look like, they look just like the &quot;carat&quot; wheel, but instead of
having 5 spokes, they have six.  Other than that they're hard to tell apart.
I'm asking 300 for the complete set.

I will also be bringing these to the Englishtown NJ  &quot; VW show and Go&quot; at
Raceway Park On Sun Oct. 6 at 8 am if I don't sell them before then.
