Subject: Sliding door handle - outside

Well since I am fixing my inside door handle, here's a stumper for 
you folks.

The outside handle is loose and it wiggles quite a bit.  There is
some serious paint removal along a circular pattern in the door
handle recess - obviously from the handle scraping the body when it
is twisted to open the door.  Is there a rubber grommet or something
that rots out over time?  Or maybe am I missing a crucial part which
the PO was too cheap to replace?  I've always wondered, but haven't
lost much sleep over it....

Anyone?

Brian.
