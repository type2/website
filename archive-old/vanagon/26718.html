Subject: list change &amp; n_dot_carolina bound

          hey there joel,  please change my listing from a '66 kombi
          to a '66 kombi/camper.  we now have all the donor '67 westy
          parts that we wanted installed.  it's bare bones inside
          because we'd rather have room to dress and move around than
          a fridge for cryingoutloud but has the fold down bed (full
          width) and jallousy windows.  and we actually camp in it.
          don't you hate to see em parked in a motel lot??

          one complaint.  how'd Hal Wigoda get in between me and the
          lovely lisa demmy (ex-mazak)???  i demand he be moved
          immediately so's that lisa and The Frau &amp; myself and Horst
          can be in closer proximity once again.  ;^)   leaving for
          n_dot_carolina this thursday (oct 19th) night.  plan to be in
          asheville/boone/hickory and wherever else the wind blows us.
          anyone want to get together up there?  send message to
          ray.hale_at_santafe.cc.fl_dot_us or call 904-395-5429 days.  we'd
          like to meet any bus people and look at vehicles, etc.
          this is our first trip out of florida with the new motor and
          it's running great.  more power for the climbs!
          ray &amp; lea hale   gainesville, fl
