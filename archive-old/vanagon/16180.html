So far I've seen/heard of three types of head probs on the wasser boxers

1) head gasket gone, coolant drips to ground, overflow tank is unaffected
2) ditto, gases get into coolant while running, overflow tank fills
3) ditto, coolant gets into cyls while cooling, overflow tank empties

In all cases overheating/air buubles eventually occur. #3 happens as the 
engine cools, leads to short period of rough idle on start-up. This was sent 
a while back by another poster. As it gets really cold it sucks in from the 
overflow?

Are there any more modes/combos for head/coolant failures, are the ones 
above really true? My '87 has already drunk a jug of Autobahn (in 2 months), 
without leaving a trace so I'm assuming #3 is at play.  tim s.
