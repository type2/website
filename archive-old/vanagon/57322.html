Great timing! I just read in the Bentley about a week ago that there is an
extension on the oil filler tube.  I'm sure that this is news, good news,
for most of us.  In fact, I wonder what percentage of us even knew about
this.

Just remove the oil cap and pull on the neck of the tube. If at first you
don't succeed, keep pulling on it, and voila, the oil filler tube sticks
out of the access door behind the license plate.

Here's to less oil spilled all over the back of the van and the ground!

Howdy -

I've been wondering what other people do to hold down their rear
license plate door to check the oil?

Did VW get better in later years and actually provide some way to
hold the door down?

I use my foot to hold open the door when checking the oil.

When adding oil, adjusting timing, etc. I use a piece of wire shaped
for the purpose to hook from the underside of the bumber to the top of
the door.  I store it on top of the hinge, bent slightly to keep it from
sliding off.

I tried wedging the oil cap between the door bottom and bus back, but
this is not an option when checking timing, and it didn't hold the
door open far enough for my tastes.
