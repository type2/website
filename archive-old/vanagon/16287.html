Subject: Fuel and Oil for a Vanagon?

These questions have probably come up before, but I missed the answers.  I'm
asking now because it looks like I might be buying a van today.  (1990 white
Vanagon Camper, 32k miles.)

     1) Is synthetic oil good to use in a 1990 Vanagon?  (Mobil 1 or equiv.)
        I've always used it in my 1987 golf, and I think it's one reason the
        engine is in fantastic shape.

     2) How about fuel?  I've always fed my Golf the highest octane available,
        but I've been told that this is essentially a waste.  Opinions?
