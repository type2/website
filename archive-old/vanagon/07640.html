Subject: early 80's Westys for sale

Pete's Auto Sales in Costa Mesa, CA is selling two Westys - an 80 or 81
cream colored one and a white 82 with about 75,000 on the odometer.  They
both are about $6,000 in asking price and the bodies are beautiful on both
of them.  I don't know about the engines, but the outside and the interior
both look excellent on these two.

Anybody in the market?  I almost wish we'd waited a bit for ours.  But
we'll see what the Mechanic says (she's getting the once over tomorrow)...
