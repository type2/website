&gt; Well, another `con' to add to my list: SOME BASTARD BROKE OUT ALL
&gt; MY WINDOWS ON THE PASS&gt; SIDE OF MY 63!! AND STOLE MY CARGO DOOR
&gt; HANDLES AND MECHANISMS!!!THE F$%%$^^$%% BASTARDS!!! GRRR!!!!!

Sorry to hear it.  :(  While we are talking about old busses, I ran across
one in the junkyard yesterday.  I don't know what year it was, but it had
the 1500 engine, and was a camper.  The tags on the side said &quot;CAMPER VAN&quot;
&quot;Custom made by Bowman &amp; Sons, San Diego, Ca.&quot;  I looked for a tag inside
the drivers door but there was none.  How do you tell what year those older
busses are anyway??

Anyway, the amazing thing is that this van was complete in every way, down
to the battery and air cleaner.  All original 6V stuff.  It had a vent in
the roof and 3 small louvered windows on each side.  I guess it had started
life as a panel van.  This bus is rusted to pieces!!! Seems odd for a bus
that was born and died in San Diego.  Maybe it lived it's life on the East
coast and came back to San Diego to die??  :)  Inside, it was not a walk
through, and had two opposing bench seats with a table in between, a closet,
and an icebox with faucet above (but I don't remember a sink...) and a little
flip up table next to the door.  All reasonably intact.  What a bitter end
for this beautiful little camper!!!

Let's all pause for a moment of silence...
