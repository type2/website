I feel for you.  The first split that got me excited ['65 Kombi] was
one of those &quot;Farmer's field&quot; finds.  When we went to pull that one
out of the bluff, the rear swing caught on a rock or stump and stayed
behind :-(.  I was extremely heartbroken...  Just hang in , you'll find
one [of course it doesn't stop there].

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!
