&gt; Bug-Out 34 is being held on april 21, 1996 in Dinwiddie VA at the
&gt; virginia motorsports park.  I'm organizing a group to head down from
&gt; Fredericksburg VA in the morning.  All VW's are welcome.  If your
&gt; interested in the caravan or are attending the show but can't make the
&gt; caravan and would like to meet up with us at the show let me know and
&gt; I'll send the details.
