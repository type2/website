Subject: fs 86 GL westy

A local Volks I met one time asked me to post this.

Its a 1986 GL Westy, brown &amp; tan, with new water pump, clutch, tie rods, main
engine seal, brakes, heavy-duty battery, 4 matching 185R14 tires (balanced &amp;
aligned) &amp; VA inspection.  The original engine's just turned 100,000 mi. &amp;
has no fluid leaks.  Stereo &amp; CB.  It's been cross-country twice, &amp; has dents
(air conditioner needs feon, too), but says it's basically healthy.  Says
blue book is $6,000 but will trade for late 60's beetle, etc. (Mom says
small, simple car...) plus some cash.

If you have any interest let me know or call Myla Fordyce at 703/777-9390.
