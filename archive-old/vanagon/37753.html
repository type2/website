Subject: EV Winnebago manual

I picked up the Winnebago manual for the EV today.
Actual title is &quot;EuroVan Camper Service Training Manual&quot; #701674-18-000.
For $20+ its definitely worth getting, more so than the VW manuals I'd say!
Lots of maintenance tips, operational notes, wiring diagrams, plumbing
diagrams and troubleshooting charts for various things such as converter,
furnace, refrigerator.

Some of these maintenance notes *should* have been in the owners manual.
for instance, cleaning of the furnace every year, waxing of the top
occasionally, not using detergents on the canvas (so you don't accidentally
remove waterproofing), cleaning of the vent hole on the LPG regulator, etc.

Trivia: on Canadian models the GFI test panel is up by the 12V/110V
outlets, while on the USA models its down on the breaker panel.

Interesting section on the furnace - I thought that the instructions were a
bit weird in the owners manual, they explain more about in here.
It is a Forced Draft Furnace - which requires a separate combustion air
blower to blow air into the combustion chamber before ignition occurs.It
has a flame sensing circuit which, if it fails to sense a flame or the
burner fails to light,  triggers a lockout mechanism which prevents it from
lighting until the thermostat circuit is opened. (they say that some models
will attempt it 3 times before locking out.) They do mention that if a
problem occurs in this loop, and you don't open the thermostat circuit, you
could run down the battery!

Anyway, this explains why the instructions have you trigger the thermostat
a couple of times if it doesn't seem to light up.

so, I'd give it an 8. check it out.
