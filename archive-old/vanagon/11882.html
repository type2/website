Subject: Heater removal

I'm home removing my heater today.  This is a big job (at least for me) It
means removing the dash and all of its wirin g and plumbing.  It's a big
mess and now I'm scared I won't be able to get it all back together.  Is
there a way to remove the blower fan without breaking the case on the
heater stuff?  I see a suspicious looking screw near where the blower is. 

I've already lost a part -- one of those clips that hold the control 
cables to the flap rod.  It zinged by me when I pried it off with a 
screwdriver and I have *no* idea where it went.

Gerry (shaking head and wondering....)
