Subject: Re: Timing on 1600DP

&gt;I was wondering about the timing on my '71 bus.  This is a stock 
&gt;1600DP with an 009, single QP and Weber progressive.  I am running 87 
&gt;octane fuel in it.  I have it set at 28 degrees total advance at 3,000
&gt;rpm.  I am at 1,100 feet or so.  In all those posts I saved about 
&gt;timing the only one I found pertaining exactly to this is that I can 
&gt;run this advance with 89 octane and that I sacrifice power for engine 
&gt;life going with less.  Should I do that?  Run less advance that is?  
&gt;BTW, it runs very nicely like this.  It seems on the edge of not 
&gt;passing the dipstick test but I expect that right now since it still 
&gt;has less than 200 miles.  Thanks, Jim

&gt;When I bought my '71 bus I ripped out the old stock dist. and put in a
 009 which I drove for almost a year, playing with it, adjusting the timing
 from 32-25 degrees at 3,000rpm (recommended 7 1/2 degrees BTDC at idle). I
could never get low end power out of it...always had to rev it up to get any
power.  Out of despiration, and a bit of advice from my old VW mechanic
friend  I bought a NEW stock dist and installed it...Wow, what a difference
in smooth  low to high power.  And it idles much smoother too!  When I put
in my new dual  carb engine I will in all likelyhood use a stock dist.  The
weight of the bus  requires good low end power.  The 009 gets it's power in
the revs, so you have  to rev up the engine  to get that power.  Now, I know
there are alot of guys  who  swear by the 009  and yes if you are running
over 5,000rpm it's a must,  but for  everyday street driving I'll go stock.
