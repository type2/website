Subject: Re: VANAGON digest 1372

My sincere thanks to all of you who answered my plea for help a few 
weeks ago by personal e-mail about my fuel problem.  From 
the information I gave you and from the symptoms, it looked like my 
fuel filter might have been clogged or maybe something else wrong 
with the fuel pump, line, injectors, etc. 

However, it turns out that the rotor (which I had just replaced less 
than 3000 miles ago) was bad and after replacement and a tune-up, the 
old van is running great again.

Just wanted to give my thanks to all of you!  Some of the simpliest 
things can be BIG problems.
