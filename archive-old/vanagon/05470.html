Subject: Steering Linkage

Well,

I am finally gotten sick of my 80-90 degrees of freeplay in the steering
wheel. While under Matilda yesterday, I watched the linkages in operation
as my SO worked the wheel. It seems that the joints on the transfer rod
are shot to hell. The rest seem tight, but the two couplings on the
'front to back' rod that goes from the steeering box to the transfer
lever on the tortion tubes are shot. Too much wear.

What is the official title for these pieces? 
About how much should I be expecting to pay for them? From where?
How can I get them out? (Using borrowable tools from the FLAPS, or
	common tools. Short on bread right now.) Same way to
	put them in?

On a related note: What kind of lubrication for the steering box?
I want to pry that little plastic cap off and peek inside and/or
top it off with fluid, but Bently does not mention what kind to use.

Thanx.
