Subject: 83 Westy immersion pump

After replacing the sink faucet with a new one from- (was it Delta in Ca. ?),
the water flowed fine. A few weeks later the water wouldn't come out again.
Finally, when I was brave enough to open the water holding tank and look down
into it, I saw this little light blue thing with a hole blown out of the
middle of it. It read Immersion pump and I could barely make out, (the paper
was coming off), something like 1.2 gpm? It was made in Germany. Where can I
get this part? The local dealer says it can't be gotten anymore. He said that
about the $160 sink faucet, but months later when I looked under the faucet I
saw something about Delta in Ca. The operator gave me the number and for
about $45 I had the new part. I wonder if this pump will be like that &quot;can't
be gotten&quot; part, or will I not be so lucky this time? 
Keep talking about these neat cool van things. I went out to the 83 and
looked behind the driver's seat- and laughed all the way back to the house.
There, unnoticed and unbeknownst to me these eight years, was a neat 'tool'
storage compartment with a hinged lid! And I can't wait to try out the
'lounge chairs'. Won't that be just the thing for watching parades, etc.? Bob
