It is for this same basic reason why it is so very difficult to locate used
fuel tanks in the boneyard for these.  So-called Auto Recyclers love to use
fork lifts to move their vehicles around and in doing so collapse or puncture
the fuel tank and also destroy the baffling inside of them, rendering them
useless.  We've educated a few yards around here by telling them to remove
the tank before moving the Vanagon to its semi-permanent resting spot.  BTW,
tanks cannot be UPS'd - too large - must go by truck freight and that's $$$$.
