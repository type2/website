They may be Zener diodes, which allow current to pass once you exceed a 
certain threshold. ie. green LED on at &gt;12.5v.  They can be blown if you 
reverse polarity and push with enough current/voltage. Pull' em out, read 
the numbers on the diodes and get a (cross-ref'd) replacement, RadioShlock 
or similar. First try a bench test with a variable power supply, maybe using 
a light dimmer switch and your battery. Might just be a burnt out green LED
