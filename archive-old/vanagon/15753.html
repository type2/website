&gt; Does it have a hard time holding an idle?  Have you checked the idle cutoff
&gt; solenoid when this happens - that it is both tight w/o an air leak and will
&gt; 'click' if you take the wire off and on?  Also, I'd check that the idle jet
&gt; on the right side is clear and tight, although this would just be an idle
&gt; problem.

It idles just great.  Really a weird problem.  The carb was just 
rebuilt about a week ago.  The carb is working just great.

&gt; Heat wave in Utah, already?

No.  That's what scares me!  Anyhow!  I had a guy look at it the 
other day, and here are the new updates:

The oil pressure is 20 psi _at_ 2000 RPM.   He says this is about 1/2 
what it should be.  I have no knowledge of oil pressure/RPM.

Would this be low enough that the oil would not be circulating 
through the oil cooler properly?

The mechanic guy suggests that we replace the oil pump, sighting that 
the pump might not be working fully.  Does an oil pump work 
half/way or is it a work/no work part?
