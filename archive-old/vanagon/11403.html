&gt;was due to a loose front nut holding the carb to the intake.  But i decided to
&gt;do the rebuild anyway.  Reinstalled, started up but ran Awful.  Like on three
&gt;cylinders.  Carb severely icing up (ambient temps 5oC).  Removed carb and 
&gt;noticed something missing.  What was it?  Ans. later

One of the little circuit plugs?

Vacuum line?

Float valve?
