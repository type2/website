Subject: 86 Vanagon 4 sale  (Syncro?)

Hi all,

Just saw this in the four-wheel drive section of the classifieds

1986 VW Vanagon GL, excelent condition.  Moving, must sell. $3850.  Call
(907)455-7277

This may be quite a deal if it truly is a syncro.  Perhaps cheap enough to
make its Alaska location feasible?  If someone is interested, I could look
it over but watercooled's are not my speciality.    

-Tom
