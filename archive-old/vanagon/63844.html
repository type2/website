Tom, you didn't mention weather you checked the oil level in your
transmission. I have had this problem a couple of times and found that
all I needed was to top off. I did run a '77 Rabbit for a long time
without lube, but found an additive (can't remember the name) that
quieted the whine and I had no problems. Drove the car another 40k (163k
total) and sold it. Met the new owner two years later and he didn't
mention any problems.
