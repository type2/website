Subject: engine compartment seals

Where can one buy engine compartment seals for the Bus?  I would like to
seal my engine compartment in order to keep the cold half of my engine cold,
and the hot half isolated from the cold half.  Right now, it is only
half 'n half sealed  :-).

I have engine compartment seals for te Bug, perhaps it is possible to fit
these into my Bus?  How about using rubber from a tire inner tube to make
my own seals?   Someone suggested to me to use pieces of rubber made from
the heavy-duty rubber used for roofing.  Who has messed around with custom
engine compartment sealing?
