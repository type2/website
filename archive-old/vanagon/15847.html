Subject: Idea instead of renting
Date: Tue, 18 Apr 95 11:31:03 EDT

Here is an idea along the lines of house swapping etc. You know, you can stay
at our villa on the Riveria for a week if we can stay at your Swiss Chalet
and so forth.
We would be willing to swap our Vanagon Westy for one week during the summer
for anyone with  a Westy in California (San Diego or SF). Since
renting is expensive this may be a preferred alternative for people.


Has anyone tried this before? Any problems (legal or otherwise) that we
should be aware of?
Thanks in advance - DC
