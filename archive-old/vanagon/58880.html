Subject: How much for a TriStar Syncro?

There is a man who want to sell his 1990 Vanagon Doublecab TriStar 
14&quot; Syncro to me.
He says to me, to give a bid. How much would you consider to be a fair 
price? Its a gas engine, and the car is in almost mint condition. It has 
6500km on the odo, Fondmetal alloys, aluminum sides on the bed. My 
dealer says about 15000$, is it to much, car is almost seven years?
