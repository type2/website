Subject: 67 Split for Sale

Hey, noticed this one on the street today and called; the roommate said 
he wants $2100 for it. Looks pretty clean (some rust; a little rusting 
through near the engine compartment). new seat covers, the note on the 
window said new headliner, but I did see a small tear (maybe he's got a 
new one in a box some where. It's not a westy, but the middle seat was 
sitting in the bus, off to the side.

Looks like mostly original paint, fading. Rust underneath as you'd 
expect.

Ask for Chip 501.443.0820. It's in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
