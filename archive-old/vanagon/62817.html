Subject: Ithaca NY area, help?

Hi folks, 
        I'm looking for assistance, in person from a person who knows the
vanagon.  I can do very basic maintance and want to learn to do more.  The
catch is taht I am legally blind so hands on instruction is much better then
books.  Any takers?  Volunteers or paid depending on what we try to take on.
Also thanks to all of you that have been giving me email advice it has
helped a great deal.
