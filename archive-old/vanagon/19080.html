Subject: [w] AMC head questions, leaky head diagnostics

Anyone have experience with AMC heads for water-cooled vanagons?
AMC makes these heads in Spain.  My mechanics quotes US$ 850/pair
for brand new heads w/valves, camshaft, etc.  He says that VW
made heads are extremely expensive.  Total bill for new heads,
gaskets, and labor is around $1600.

The reason I need new heads is that combustion gas is forcing
itself passed the head gasket into the cooling system, which
eventually leads to an overflowing coolant reservoir tank.  The
mechanic used a neat test to confirm my worst fears -- he tested
for the presence of carbon monoxide in the cooling system.  Used
a sensor similar to the one you would find at an emissions test.
He also said that abnormally clean spark plugs indicate steam in
the cylinders.  I had 3 of 4 clean spark plugs :-(.

In the mean time, I still drive my van, but I must replace coolant
about every 200 miles with the following procedure:

 1. Park the van on an incline, front end higher.  My driveway
    works well.
 2. Wait for things to cool off -- at least 2 hours.
 3. Carefully open the expansion tank cap.  Allow the coolant
    level to rise to the top.  Close cap tightly.
 4. Drain the reservoir tank down the the &quot;min&quot; level.  Capture
    coolant into a bottle.
 5. Transfer coolant to a squeeze bottle (used in chem labs to 
    dispense DI water, alcohol, etc).  
 6. Remove the bleed screw on the radiator.  Insert hose from
    the squeeze bottle and fill up the radiator.

BTW, the BBB Autoline refused my claim.  The reasoned that my 
vanagon was too old and had too many miles ('84 with 102,000
miles).  It was worth a try.

Thanks for your input.
