&gt; I'm also looking for the chrome stips that go on these things.  Local 
&gt; guy says I'll be hard-pressed to get them for anything less than $10 
&gt; a strip!  Ack.  That's like $160 for a set!

Thats about right, but they are being repro'ed now.

Try getting them for a barndoor!
(note: my '54 had several, which were &quot;appropriated&quot; sometime before
delivery, slong with the taillights and center brake light)

&gt; Is the passanger door supposed to lock?  Pusing the handle down 
&gt; doesn't do anything, and there's no key lock like the rest of the 
&gt; doors.  (which I had all re-keyed by a fabulous local locksmith!)
&gt; So?

Yes, it is.
 
&gt; Who can I call to order a new canvas/vinyl sunroof cover?  I'll 
&gt; probably call today on it since mine self-destructed on the freeway
