&gt; I just dropped my van off at the dealer this a.m. for its annual crankshaft oil 
&gt; seal change (another story).  I asked the service manager what the pretty red '92 
&gt; vanagon was in for (I parked next to it, felt kinda like an older man 
&gt; with a younger, beautiful woman).  He said it came in with a 
&gt; complaint of a flickering oil light at idle, 52,000 miles on van.  
&gt; They put a guage on and indeed it was low.  They were just about to 
&gt; start by putting an oil pump in it when they noticed the Fram filter. 
&gt;  They changed to a Volkswagen one and immediately gained 5 psi at hot 
&gt; idle and 10 psi at highway rpm.  Now this could be due to just an old 
&gt; vs new filter or is this a typical experience with Frams?  My oil 
&gt; light flickers at idle and I will be changing to a VW filter to try 
&gt; this out!

I don't know what to say about your experience, but here's mine...

I always use Fram filters now.  A long time ago I bought another kind of
filter.  It was black, expensive ($6), and had German writing on the box.
It was supposed to be &quot;original specification&quot; or something like that.
Well, with this filter installed, my pressure was a LOT lower at all
rpm's.  It scared me, so I bought a Fram filter and installed it and the
pressure was back up to &quot;normal&quot;.  Maybe this means I could get even
more pressure with a VW filter.  Hmmm... but is there really any more
pressure where it's needed?  Gonna have to look at the oil journal
schematics to be sure.
