Subject:      Re: [f] Friday poem, Help me!!!

On Thu, 9 Feb 95 Really Late, Will &quot;Stir-it-up-again&quot; Self said:
&gt;Please PITCH IN and help me with this!  Contribute your own couplet (for
&gt;those of you who slept through English class, two lines that rhyme) and
&gt;maybe we can get Joel to be sweet and collect them all into one big
&gt;beautiful paean.  Joel?
&gt;
&gt;   I think that I shall never scan
&gt;   A poem lovely as a van--
&gt;   A Volksy van that gets me there,
&gt;   And home again without a care.

WELL!!!! Faaarrrrrrr be it from me to let someone else get in the last word:


I think that I shall never see
An auto that appeals to me
As much as a Volkswagen Bus.
A car designed, without much fuss,
To go Where One Has Not Before
And do it with just speeds of four;
To go, and with you take it all
For creature comforts, big and small;
To carry all, and not complain
In winter's snow and summer's rain;
To last for families, passing down
&gt;From Old to Young, who've newly found
The sheer delight and sect's appeals
Of driving in a box on wheels.
