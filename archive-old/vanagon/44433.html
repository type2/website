&gt;Hi Josh, I am a restorer in the SF Bay area and I am always
&gt;looking for parts. We are currently restoring a number of
&gt;pre 68 VWs for our overseas market. What we need more than 
&gt;anything right now are Deluxe bus parts (outside trim sets
&gt;or pieces, bumper trim sets or pieces, inside grab handles
&gt;in good cond, vent wing windows w/latches,rear inside
&gt;corner removable headliner pieces[oilboard], and a lot of 
&gt;other stuff that we use on a daily basis.
&gt;  Please get back to me as soon as you can. Thanks.

Gary-
I am only parting out some single cabs, kombis and campers right now, no
deluxes. But, I do have transaxles, reduction gears, front ends, doors,
bumpers, windows, popouts, switches, relays, guages, and more. I do travel to
SF a couple times a year, at least. I am thinking of coming up soon. Maybe I
could deliver a few items, if needed?
Thanks,
Josh
