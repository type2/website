Subject: Got back from Baja

I took my first trip to Baja in my '71 campmobile.  We didn't go too far 
-- 80 miles from San Diego to Ensenada.  Camped at a nice campground 
called San miguel.  Cost $8.00 a night.  This is expensive for mexico i 
am told.  We were right on the beach, lots of VW's there.  Mine was the 
best of course, being a '71!  you can get killer sky-rockets which must 
have a 1/2 stick of dynamite on the end.  One note:  weekends are when 
the locals go to the beach to party...and they PARTY!  If you wish to 
sleep, camp on the week days or go to a more remote location.  There was 
one pretty good grade going down there but my 1641 did pretty good.  Had 
to down shift to 3rd a couple of times.  it seemed to run at right around 
210 according to my oil temp gauge, climbed up to about 230 on that 
hill.  Next time we will go deeper into Baja.  If anyone is interested, a 
VW camp trip might be fun.

Peace!
