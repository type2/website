Subject: Re:  CV joints

about older bus and vanagon CV joints -
I'm pretty sure the joints are the same (although the driveshafts
arent) - but someone who knows part numbers should confirm.

ABout price of these - dont be afraid to haul them off, clean them out
and pack them full of grease before you decide to get new
ones - i did this to the 83 about 20K miles ago - they finally were knocking
like hell - and bits of metal fell out when i did lcean them - loaded up
with my holy lubricant - &quot;Mr. Molly&quot; MoS2 laden grease and havent heard
a peep from them since. I had some pretty nasty pits on the race too, but 
they dont seem to mind too much.

just a thought.

btw - i still havent gotten around to defending the honour of my
diesel vanagon against the libelous 'VW Bus History' post

&quot;if you bought one of these (diesel vanagons) you deserve what you
got&quot;  indeed !!!!!!!
