&gt;&gt;&gt;I have noticed a problem with the sliding door on my '87 Vanagon Camper. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;opens while I am driving sometimes (even when locked) and is hard to shut
&gt;
&gt;My '87 used to do this a lot, especially during the winter. Used to think the
&gt;latch or something had been damaged from people slamming the door closed hard
&gt;like you have to do with full-size US vans. Finally, I discovered last winter
&gt;that the latch, which is at the back of the door, was gunked up a little and
&gt;not free enough to catch properly. Some wd-40 freed it up and it quit popping
&gt;open. It started popping open a few weeks ago and the lube job fixed it
&gt;again.
&gt;
&gt;The popping open sure does get the attention of those riding in the back two
&gt;seats, doesn't it? Try checking and lubing the latch...hope it works.
&gt;
&gt;
I would be concerned if my door popped open &quot;whenever&quot;. Perhaps the latch is
worn out. More likely it has a broken spring, or most likely it is dirty/and
or/dry. Consider taking it out and cleaning it thoroughly, inspect it for
worn/broken/missing parts. Look in the bottom of the door for mystery pieces
&lt;g&gt;. If it all looks perfect then relube with a GOOD light weight oil. NEVER
EVER use &quot;3in1 household oil&quot; 10 weight motor oil works fine for most of
these things but there are wonder oils available for thoes with a few extra
bucks, or free trade samples &lt;g&gt;.

You may want to file a complaint with VW and NHTSA, latches that open by
themselves are a no-no.
