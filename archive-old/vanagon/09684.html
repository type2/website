If you REALLY do need a full blown break job, you should check out the &quot;Bullet 
Train&quot; break system upgrade kit from Martin Schnider Design Systems (MSDS).

The kit includes drilled front rotors, steel break lines, and better than OEM 
quality pads for both front and rear. The system got a favorable review in 
January's issue of European Car. They noted significantly improved pedal feel 
and much reduced fade after extended breaking.

The kit sells for around $500, supposedly not much more than what VW would 
charge for the parts (haven't verified this myself).

You can reach MSDS at:

2643 Rosmead Blvd.
South El Monte, CA 91733
(818) 448-8726

BTW, I have no affiliation with them, nor have I purchased any of their products 
(but I probably will when it comes time to replace my rotors).
