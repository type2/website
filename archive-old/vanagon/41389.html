Subject: Free '76 &amp; '78 Bus Rolling Chassis!!?!!

Every month or two someone calls me looking for a Bus axle beam 
because theirs rotted out.  Now I have 2 parts buses with good ones 
and I can't even GIVE them away.  I know I'm going to send this bus 
to the crusher and in a week someone's going to call me asking for 
an axle beam. But I'm out of time, and they must go.
If you live on the east coast, please go outside and look at your 
axle beam.  If it is rusting in the center or at the supports, 
please take this parts bus near Philly before I call the local 
junkyard Monday and have it hauled away and crushed. (Also if you 
can use any suspension or brake stuff, doors, etc.)  I don't even 
care what you give me for it, if anything.  I just hate to see 
useful parts go to waste.  The '76 has less rust than most busses I 
see on the road around here!
Those of you on the West Coast, you will never know what it is to 
have a mechanically sound bus grounded because road salt has 
reduced the axle beam or other under-car components to flaking 
chips.  Lucky you!
