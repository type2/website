&gt;I've actually thought about this.  How difficult is it to get them back in
&gt;and how much did it set you back?

getting back in is not hard ONCE YOU LEARN THE TRICK. :) which is a good
strong stout piece of small rope/cord and a six-inch piece of broom handle
(with a hole in it, and the rope/cord tied through that hole). this rope has
to be long enough to fit into the body-groove of the rubber gasket (already
fitted around the glass/window-frame). as your buddy presses the combo
against the outside of the window-hole, you (on the inside) pull the cord,
which pulls the lip of the gasket groove over the metal lip of the body.
it takes practice. but once down, is easy. armorall helps to grease everything
to make it nice and slippery.

you CANNOT do it alone. windshield takes two on outside, one on inside. and
a lot of praying and swearing ... and removal of ALL inside mirrors, sun
visors, grab handles, a/c housing, etc. easiest are the rear hatch and the
rear sides. sliding windows are a bitch to get out cause is you are not
careful, you can bend that aluminum frame EASY! (putting them back in is
fairly easy). ALL of the glass is much heavier than you think. pick strong
buddies! :)

windshield rubber is about $60. the rest of the windows are about $25 each.
or were. i haven't gotten around to doing the front door windows ... yet.
can't quite figure how they work. i have the three pieces (i think) for each,
but it don't look like it works the same. and i've have problems getting a
glue that works right. maybe this summer ... when i paint my roof white. ;)
