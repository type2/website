Subject: For Sale: '85 Vanagon


	I have a painted up '85 Vanagon for sale.  The rings in #3
are shot and the motor and body have ~196k mi. on them.  The car is pretty
solid, otherwise.  No major rust, some minor scratches and dings in the
body, no rips in the interior.  All FI parts fully functional.

$600 in Portland, Oregon.

e-mail if interested.

-Ben
