Subject: '56 kombi update - healing wounds
Date: Sat, 4 Feb 1995 11:16:28 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

Last night I finally healed one of my busses larges wounds.  Someone
prior to me had cut a huge hole in the back deck ala type III engine cover
I welded it up (luckily they'd left the original piece) sealed it with
some auto-body caulk and undercoated it.  It sounds completely different
in the bus now!  I estimate I got rid of 80% of the rattles this way!

Today I'll tackle some more bodywork.
