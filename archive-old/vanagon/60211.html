&gt;how to reset this light?
&gt;some past list discussion said to look for switch behind speedo, but i'm
&gt;not finding it.

there's a little black box, in the speedo cable ...it's about bumper
level, just to the left of the spare tire. follow the speedo cable up
from the left front wheel. you should be able to get to it without
lowering the spare tire.

anyway, on this box, there is a button, hidden down inside a &quot;tube&quot; or
shield. push that button (with a screwdriver or pen or something) until
it &quot;clicks&quot;. you should hear/feel it click, but it might not be a very
loud noise/feel. that should reset the gizmo and the light will turn off.
you MIGHT have to click it two or three times to get it reset.

good luck.
joel
