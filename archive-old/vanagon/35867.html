ked and slithered in the background for long enough, at long last,
I write.  My girlfriend Whitney and I have just purchased our first VW, an
‘88 Westy with 98,000 miles (great condition) with the intention of driving
it from San Francisco through Mexico at least as far as Guatemala.  We’re
heading south in about a week and plan on traveling for about six months or
so.  What we’d really like to do is drive it to Panama, then put it on a boat
to Alaska and drive it back from there, or to Florida and drive home
cross-country.

I’ve traveled a bit, but not with a vehicle, and I’ve never owned or worked
on a VW.  As a result, I’m quite confident when I say that I have no idea
what we’re getting into.  We’ve had the van thoroughly
inspected/tuned/prepped at Gandalf’s Garage in South San Francisco (and
they’ve been really great) and it seems to be pretty road worthy, but I’ve
got some questions about a long road trip like this in Mexico.

1.  What kind of tools should I bring?  I’m mechanically inclined, but pretty
much clueless about working on the van.  I’m thinking about getting a good
harness and length of rope so I can strap myself like a sled dog to the front
bumper and tow it to a garage when I need to.  Don’t tell me to bring a
super-twisto-double-spanner-wizzlethorp because I wouldn’t know what to do
with it.

2.  What kind of spare parts should I bring?  Someone said the tires are hard
to get in that size if they need replacing.  Should I have both a good spare
and an extra (6th) tire, or is that overkill?

3.  I’ve been told that the catalytic converter can plug up and cause
problems with Mexican gas.  I’ve gotten a converter that is just a tube with
no insides that I could put on after we’re over the border, then switch it
back before we come back to California.  Is that either necessary or a bad
idea for any reason?

4.  I’ve read various comments about over-heating brakes.  This weekend on
the way back from Yosemite, going down Old Priest Grade (Old Mill Grade??) on
Highway 120 (it’s a VERY steep section) the brakes faded and the front brakes
got so hot there was smoke pouring from them before I realized what was
happening.  Is that normal for this car or do I have a problem?

5.  What have I forgotten to ask??  I know about sulfate-free coolant; I can
only assume that’s available in Mexico.  Anything special about oil?
 Anything else?

Thanks in advance for anyone’s helpful comments.  I’m on digest, so if you
could also mail comments to me directly I’d really appreciate it. 

An additional note:  when the list gets split as it inevitably will (quit
fighting it, you whiners, it's just a matter of time), please sign me up for
the white-’88-Westy/Northern-California/not-really-a-mechanic version.
 That’s not too much to ask, is it?  (Did anyone get apoplectic before they
got it?  Passions do tend to run high in this group.)

And another note:  we’re taking an old ‘386 portable computer with us and
using AOL’s Mexico service to send and receive e-mail on the road.  We’re
planning to have a web site that our friend will be posting our e-mailed
newsletters to.  I’ll let you know the address of it when I know it.
