Subject: Just to rub it in....

To all whom were werking Wed. and Thurs.... Played hookie and went to  
Hampton Beach, N.H. Wednesday morning (in my microbus - so this is
VW related).  The surf was pumping.  Surfed for about four hours.  Feeling 
guilty and slightly worried about the ramifications of my not showing up for
werk, I sped (~60 mph) back and got to werk at about 3.  Logged on to read
my lenti mail.  Phone rings.  Its my Boss.  Says since he was unable to 
make it in today (and won't be tomorrow) he's wondering if I could fax 
him some material.  I told him I was very busy at the moment but would get
on it shortly (Can u believe it?)....Yesterday (Thurs) surf session was
just as much fun...
