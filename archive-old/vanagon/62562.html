&gt; To All those who asked for more info on the small a/c unit, Toyotomi TID-1200
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased mine at: Yaohan Best (a Japanese grocery store in San Diego)
&gt; The price in 1993 was $550 &amp; tax. I called them and they only carry the
&gt; larger TID-1800.
&gt; 
&gt; But I digress, The TID-1200 is a 4000 BTU, 400W (very efficient), small (W
&gt; 10.5in. X D 14in X H 26in), weight 43lbs, Quiet, freestanding a/c unit.
&gt; This unit uses an exhaust hose which I stick out whichever window is
&gt; convenient at the time, depending on if I'm parked or driving.
&gt; 
&gt; I called the place that distributes them in L.A., Shilac Ent., Phone#
&gt; 310-791-2855. They said no one carries the 1200 anymore but you can order
&gt; one direct from them by calling. She said the price is now $639. I assume
&gt; that would be plus shipping.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone's interested, my girlfriend purchased the larger TID-1800 at the
&gt; same time. It's 7200btu, uses 840W but it's a bit much for what I had in
&gt; mind. Both have never given a lick of trouble.

&gt; hey bob 
one more question about your airconditioner..you mention weather you are 
parked or driving&quot;  does this mean it runs off 12v dc?
thanks for info so far
