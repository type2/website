Subject: Front brakes

I did a site survey on the front brakes of my wife's '91 GL last night.

Are the bolts that hold the Girling calipers 22mm?
Is there some secondary lock on them, a cotter pin or something?
I couldn't make them budge.

Are there any other tools I should get before I tear it all down? (I don't
have a 22mm socket (yet), but a 7/8 fit pretty well...)

I wound up putting the new pads on the old rotors, just so we could survive
until I figure it out.  Given the condition of the rotors, I'll likely have
to buy another set of pads when I complete the job.

I must say that the Bentley manual has precious little in it about the
mundane aspects of working on the brakes...

I get the digest form of the list, so please email me directly if you have
any life-saving pearls of wisdom for me.

Thanks.
