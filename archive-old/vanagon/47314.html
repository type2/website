Subject: Re: Bubble in cooling system? '87 Vanagon

Don't forget to bleed the rear seat heater core.  And I think putting the
water in first and THEN adding the coolant is a really *bad* idea.  Mix
first and then add, otherwise you'll never be sure that it mixed well, or
the proportions were right!
