Yep, sure is a 221.  According to all the lists I have read from gopher 
and in magazines, I cannot find a 226 or a 236 listed.  Are you sure your 
not looking at the chassis instead of the serial number?  The type is in 
the serial number and the date assembled is in the chassis number.

My Serial No.: UT 2212 434483 6163526

Entry Point is Texas, USA and the Model is a 221.. the rest is unique to 
my Bus.

[The above info was learned from whatever feedback I got from list members 
when I asked a few weeks ago.  I can not be held liable for any 
inaccuraces. :-) ]
