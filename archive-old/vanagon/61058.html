&gt;a few words of wisdom from ol' Ben Thar-don-That: ;)
&gt;- the WORST trucks to follow are:
&gt;   - portable parking lots: the ones that haul cars. terrible turbulence!
&gt;   - flat beds. again lots of buffeting behind them.
&gt;   - the small-diameter tanker trucks.
&gt;  Schneider trucks (the bright orange ones): they never go the speed limit.
&gt;
&gt;- the BEST ones are the really low furniture movers. only trouble is, they
&gt;  hardly ever go fast.
&gt;- the MORE trucks that are following each other, the more benefit they get
&gt;  and the more benefit you get. that is, if following one truck is good,
&gt;  then following three trucks (who are following the first one) is better.
&gt;  aerodynamically speaking.
&gt;
&gt;(snip)

I think the best deal would be a clear plexiglas furniture mover, including
the cab section.  ;)

There was some some discussion in another forum as to whether or not the lead
vehicle derived some benefit from a following vehicle in a draft, a &quot;push&quot; if
you will.  Perhaps someone on this list who's had the &quot;benefit&quot; of an 18+
wheeler sitting inches off the back bumper would care to comment which way
their mileage went...  

Yeah, I never much cared for looking at the back of trailer _at_ 15ft. going
70+ mph; a bit too tense...  Only time I ever did it for a prolonged period of
time was to make it to the next gas stop on the interstate.
