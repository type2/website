Subject: Weber Jets?
Date: Sun, 24 Sep 1995 09:42:21 -0600 (MDT)

I think I've asked this before, but if I did, I never got a response. 
Does anyone know where to get jets for Webers? Or, a good text file on 
drilling them out? I've done that before with other carbs, but it helps 
to have some idea of what size drill to use corresponding to jet sizes.
