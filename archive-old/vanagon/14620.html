&gt;I bought the '57 Deluxe 23-Window (Sunroof) last night!  I am so 
&gt;excited!  Picking it up this afternoon!!!
&gt;
&gt;Is it true that the only paint combo in the early years was 
&gt;Chocolate/Salmon?  (what are the official names anyhow?)

I believe this is true for deluxes, but I think standard microbuses
came in Sand Green/Palm Green.  Chestnut Brown/Sealing Wax Red

&gt;Also true that '57 did not come with a gas guage?

Gas gauges were standard equipment on all ambulances but were only
available as options on regular transporters until 1962, when they
became std. eq.
