&gt;I've removed the list of Mcodes that has previously been on my webpage. 
&gt;Tom Brouillette, the editor of the NEATO newsletter in which many of the
&gt;Mcodes appeared, objected to them being there. 

If anyone out there has raw source material on M codes, free from NEATO's 
copyright, I would be happy to edit, translate, HTMLize and place them on 
the web, expressly into the public domain.
