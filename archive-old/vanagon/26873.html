Subject: Re: searched gripe

This is in RE: teh police allegedly(?!?!?) searching your bus.  I
mentioned that you had cabinents.  I am concluding that you have a
camper/Westphaila type vechicle.  ergo (or something) if you have a VW
camper then that means you have a motor home.  I mean a motor HOME. A home
is a home.  I believe that the Constitution of the United States protects
one's HOME against the type of search that you described.  If my
assumptions are correct then YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS have been VIOLATED and some
police types are eligibel for up to 10 years at the Federal Bed and Breakfast.
Just my 2 phennings worth
