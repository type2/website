Subject: My 71's engine update

Today, I put another 75 miles on my new engine.  I have still using the 009 
and the 34 pict-3.  I actually got the thing to idle well!!  I don't have 
any vaccum leaks, and I have it timed at 7.5 BTDC static.  I was mostly 
crusing at 40~60 mph, on some back roads and a short jaunt on the highway.  
She's running like a top.  I also did a compression check today, and had 140 
psi on 1 and 3 and 145 psi on 2 and 4.  Don't ask me why these numbers came 
out, I don't know.  I'll keep all of you posted.  Thanks to all for the help.
