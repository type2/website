&gt;        I have this question though: Although the brakes were making
&gt;        some remarkable noise before the pad change, it seems not to have
&gt;        gone away after the change.  Is this normal? - Is there a spray I
&gt;        can use safely and effectively?

there is some stuff that can be put on the backside of the pads, that will
help them stick to those little brass backing plates. by stiking more, it
keeps the pads from rattling.

but it might also be that you got the wrong kind of pads. i tried some
after-market metallic pads on my vanagon, and they squealed badly from
day one. i wound up getting rid of them and going back to the vw brand
(just because i couldn't stand that squealing!).
