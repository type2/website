Hi,

What would cause 'low brake pedal'?

I just got new rear drums &amp; brake shoes.  I've checked the brake fluid
resevoir &amp; it's at max.  I don't see anything leaking from under.  It
seems I have to pump the brake pedal to get the 'normal feel' of
braking.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.
