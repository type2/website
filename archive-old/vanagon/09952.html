Pete:
Please send me your email address.  Our &quot;Mom-Mobile&quot; is a 93 EuroVan 
(non-Weekender) but I would like some information about yours.  There is only 
one of the Weekenders in Chattanooga that I have spotted.  Sorry to use the list 
for this but I do not have your address.
Thanks,
Skip Correll
