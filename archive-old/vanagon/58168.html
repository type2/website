Subject: Gas cap

        So should the gas cap be fine if I were to remove the tumblers, and
just make it a pseudo-locking cap? That way I get to keep the cap I have,
and only have to sacrifice the locking ability, as opposed to buying a new
after market one that may not fit and look all that great.
        Theres two places in town here that claim they have a box of used
caps, some VW's. Ill drop by as soon as I get this other one off, and get
her filled up with some elixir of life...(aka gas)
        And thanks for the speedy replies folks. You guys rock.
