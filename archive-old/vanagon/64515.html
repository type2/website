        As well as MICE! I had a mouse in my '73 westy that I keep in Baja that
kept me awake and damn near insane for 3 nights last spring. I was so
frustrated after watching him eat poison then re-appear the next night,
I would have probably blown a hole through my floorboard with a shotgun
to rid myself of &quot;my little resentment&quot; as I began to call him.
Off topic but sealing the bus is a good all around idea.

PS: Now I set a mousetrap at night before I go to sleep.
PPS: Having a mouse loose in your bus is probably THE best form of birth
control I've ever seen.
