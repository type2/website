Subject: adjusting valves? top dead center

hey now,

i'm going to adjust my valves by myself for the first time tommorrow...there
is a mark that has been on there....i'm assuming i line this up with the 0
degree mark on the plastic thing...but it's warped. so how do i find tdc?
stupid question i know...but i need to know how to do this...and i'm assuming
that the idiot's guide is corret on the .006 gap?
