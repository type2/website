Subject: Re: FRAM specualtion re pressure

&gt; ersoanlly do not trust CR but the Fram filter is a good product.  I also
&gt; belive that one should never need to use the bypass valve in the filter.
&gt;  This is only a safety in case the filter gets clogged.  If th filter is
&gt; clogged, save your money for an engine.  You will need it soon.

Dennis,

I thought the bypass valve also served to prevent overly high oil 
presure when cold? Is this not the case? Just wondering - in cold 
weather (30-40f) using 20w50 I will get 100-120 psi of oil pressure 
during the first few minutes of driving. This is with a VW filter - I 
have not used anything else since adding the gauge, so I don't know 
if the bypass valve has any effect.
