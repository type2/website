Subject: 95 EV-Winnebago fridge problems
Date: Wed, 11 Jun 1997 22:41:23 -0700

Wondering if any other EV-C owners have had problems with the Norcold 
fridge in high elevation, 4-6,000 ft ?  It doesn't seem to get enough air 
to light or stay lit.  I called Norcold today and they told me that I need 
to have a &quot;Vent Kit&quot; installed, which means another hole in the side of the 
van, yuck!

Has any one else heard of this or had this surgery performed? Are there any 
tricks that I should know about?

Also, I read that others have had problems with the door locks going nuts, 
ever any resolution?
