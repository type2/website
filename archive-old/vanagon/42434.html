So DHaynes57_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I do! See previous post.  My only real question, why use cheap stuff at
&gt; all?  Different Oil companies use different additive packages.  When a
&gt; decision is made as to what brand of oil you will use, you should stay with
&gt; it.   Although all SAE rated oils must be compatible(?), the different
&gt; additives on a regular basis can cause deposit build ups (sludge, varnish,
&gt; Ash etc) that can shorten the life of an engine. 20-50 is my choice for VW
&gt; engines also.  

Well, the only reason I used the cheaper stuff was that I felt that I didn't
need the added protection during the cooler months.  I'm running Castrol
dinosaur oil now.  And that is they type I meant when I mentioned it in my 
previous quote.  I know you're concerned about the way the oil is heated
in a H2O Vanagon but I'm not sure it's going to make a difference with
the interval rate they I do my changes which is about every 2K - 2.5K
miles.  I just don't like the oil to stay in there that long and I don't
want to pay $$$$ for the synthetics.  Maybe in about 5 years we can
look back at this discussion with more clarity.  :)

Worst case: The heads leak coolant at 150K and I have to make a decision
	    whether to rebuild the engine along with the valves.


Best case: A miracle happens and the van makes it to 200K+ miles and
	   never needs the head coolant gaskets replaced.

The head gasket problem really can make the oil change thing a moot 
point.  :[
