Subject: '54 RHD Deluxe Progress

Well I finally got off my butt and did something on the '54.  I got the
passenger side rockers cut off and the new inner rocker welded on.  This
side had been repaired before with a big piece of I-beam steel, so it was a
MAJOR PITA to get this thing cut off and preserve the lateral I-beams.

Next I'll cut the longitudinal frame pieces off and replace them, and then
fabricate the front section of the longitudinal.

Funny Bus Story:

Taking a break, I was looking at the lawn, and wondering why it was dying.
So I turned the sprinklers on.  Turns out I had a broken sprinkler - which
proceeded to shoot water at umpteen GPM straight thru the open safari
windows on the '56.  I stood there in shock for a couple seconds when I
realized what was happening, then shut the sprinklers down...
