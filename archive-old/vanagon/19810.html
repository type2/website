Subject:      How much liquid wrench is enough?



Well I was real proud of myself for finally getten a pair of KYB shocks for
the rear. The arrived today at 3 via UPS. Man have the last few hours been
hot, and all because of one bolt, the bottom left. So after a 1/2 can liquid
wrench I can't take it any more. Its going to hurt, but guess I'll put it all
back together in the morn and see what K-Mart will rip me for putting the back
two on. Still plan to try and put on the front ones before going. Not KYB, but
if I can get them on I'll love them just the same. If I had known I was going
to have to give up and pay to have the back ones put on, never would have
invested in the KYB. Oh well, the 4th is almost here, got to here for that
Thurs. deadline when we spit this hot berg.
