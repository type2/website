&gt;   hi all,
&gt;         me and my 87 westy were wondering if anyone out there had
&gt; successfully delt with ther squeaky clutch pedal?  i think theres a nylon
&gt; bearing sleave thats worn out (122k), but access looks bleak.  i can barely
&gt; see what im trying to get at much less get my hands near it..;(
&gt;         i had the dash apart last week (to free a seized blower fan),,,now im
&gt; thinking i have to do that again to get at the clutch/brake pedal assembly!
&gt; ;(((   i'll try spraying the area with heavy duty lube, but im gonna need to
&gt; fix it right real soon.  any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt;                                     peace
  
        I had to play around a bit, with a spray lub, in just the right 
        area, but I finally got mine to stop squeaking, with out removing
        a thing. Although, I might be to late, last night as I would 
        push the pedal in, it was felling funny. Like a notchy feel. 

                                 I think I'll see what happens on this one
