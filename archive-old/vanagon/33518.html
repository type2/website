Subject: Contact Enhancers (long)

The following is gleened from a SCI.ELECTRONICS FAQ  

I am curious if this would have some use on automotive connectors or 
if it would cause problems.  Seems like it would be particularly good 
on individual sensor connectors but i'm leary of using it on the ECU 
main connector due to the close proximity of other input connectors.

1) Contact Enhancers

(From the Editor)

One of the more famous and common Contact Enhancers is a product 
called &quot;Stabiliant-22A&quot;. From what I have read, it was developed to improve
contact integrity in military applications such as rockets and 
planes. The following is a good description:

(From Dave Platt)

Stabiliant-22 is an organic block polymer. It is normally a 
relatively good insulator, but under a sufficiently strong electrical field it 
switches state and becomes a reasonably good conductor. The critical voltage 
is somewhere in the thousands of volts per millimeter, I believe. It can
&quot;bridge over&quot; the space between contacts which are not in good 
condition, and the electrical field between the contact surfaces will cause it 
to switch into its conductive phase and keeps the circuit &quot;closed&quot;. It 
will not (in normal use) allow current to leak between adjacent contacts 
in a connector, because the voltage difference between adjacent contacts 
is not enough to reach the critical &quot;volts per distance&quot; level.

Stabiliant-22 is pretty expensive. I bought a 15 ml bottle of a 
1-in-4 dilution (in isopropyl alcohol) from Soft Solutions in Eugene, OR 
(voice phone +1 503 461 1136). It cost somewhere around $35.

A more dilute solution of Stabiliant-22 is marketed by Sumiko under 
the brand name &quot;Tweek&quot;. It's available at many high-end audio stores.

In either case, very little of the actual Stabiliant-22 is needed on 
the contact surface... it is used in very thin layers.

(From Scott Dorsey)

It's a conductive linear chain polymer... Scientific American did an
article on the family back in '78 or so, I think, when research in 
that field was big news.

It's conductive for a short distance, but the conductivity falls off 
very abruptly for film distances of more than a few mils. As a result, it 
fills in gaps and improves conductivity. It does not break down oxides, so 
you will have to clean things properly before using it.

And it really is amazing stuff when it's needed.

(From Kent Ashton)

Stabiliant is made by:

D.W. Electrochemicals Ltd
9005 Leslie Street, Unit 106
Richmond Hill, Ontario
L4B 1G6
Tel: (416) 889-1522

They should be able to give you the name of a dealer in your area.

I've used Stabiliant for about 5 years and have found it to be good 
for edge connectors, switches, pots, turntable stylus connectors, and ic
socket. Stabiliant calls itself an enhancer but it also coats the 
surface, and thereby prevents oxidation as well. The folks at DW 
Electrochemical can send you some paperwork on how and why the stuff works, as well as 
some fairly impressive results of testing that they and others have done.

(From Scott Dorsey)

I have several 11/780 machines and dozens of uVax machines where the
contacts are so badly worn that Stabiliant 22 is essential to normal
operation. I use it on flight-ready systems and have seen a dramatic
reduction in vibration-induced contact failures.

If your intermittent problems are due to a bad connection on a 
connector, it will fix it. If they are due to a cold solder joint or a flaky 
chip, Stabiliant isn't going to help, though.

Incidentally, Sumiko Tweek is a 5% solution of the same stuff. It
comes in a 5 ml bottle for $15, and 5 ml will last forever... I
haven't used 50 ml in the ten years I have been applying it to
everything...
