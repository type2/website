Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

&gt; Yes, actually, for the VAST bulk of you, the answer is to buy 2 or even 4 of
&gt; the $19 12 volt jobbies at K-Mart or similar and hook them up *at the same
&gt; time.* It takes about 7 mins for my Ames Dept. Store $19 special to bring
&gt; one tire up from 15 psi to 40, so I bought a little pile of these. With
&gt; four, you can bring all four tires up in 7 mins. This is the answer folks,
&gt; goofy as it sounds. 
&gt; 
SEVEN minutes!! Are you serious! I had a flat on my Jetta two weeks 
ago (DEAD flat), when I went to go home. I borrowed a hand pump &amp; had 
it up to ~ 30 psi in 2-3 minutes tops. It was a decent hand pump and 
185r13 tires are smaller than a bus tire, but why bother with cheap 
12v pumps if it takes THAT long??
