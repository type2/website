I've made several efforts to come up with such a check-list only to find I'd
made too many assumptions.  For example, checking for chipped/cracked glass
assumes the thing HAS glass.  Ditto for tires, axles and so forth.

I finally decided I had become over-sensitized by Grendel's supposed 'good
condition', ie, a vehicle that could be registered and driven.

To keep the decision tree to a manageable size perhaps it would be best to
have more than one check-off list, starting with Licensed/Operating vehicles
and working our way down...  Out of License,  Mechanically Complete, and
finally 'Grendelesque' -- the 'G-code' buses.

Whatever the number of check-off lists, all would have pretty much the same
structure, starting with a Gross Visual Inspection that involves a slow walk
around the vehicle, then a Mechanical Inspection, calling for a look inside
the engine compartment, jacking up the front wheels the test steering and
suspension, and a creeper-trip under the machine to inspect linkages, rust,
leaks and so forth.  Interior inspection and a test drive should give you
enough data to do a proper evaluation.  

Even so, the different styles of Type II should stress the features unique to
that style, which would call for additional branches on the decision tree.

In addition to a standardized check-off kept in all of the Type II related
archives, I think a video would be a good idea.  A list tells you what to
look for but if you've no experience with the sound of a bad differential
bearing you might confuse it for a wheel bearing.  Hearing/seeing the thing
on TV would be a big help in learning what to SENSE when getting to know a
bus... and would be very handy for the novice doing his first tune-up,
brake-job and so forth.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Attached TEXT file named &quot;Used-car Checklist (text)&quot; follows &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

This is the 11/18/91 version of a five-part used-car buyer's checklist.  The
purpose of this list is to systematically highlight some potential  problem
areas to check out in a car that you are looking at to buy from a private
individual.  It also tries raise some pointed questions that you might not
remember to ask in the limited time you have to examine the car.  These can be
of particular value when you have fallen under the seductive spell of your
dream car and your normally razor-sharp intellect has been reduced to the
mushy consistency of a slightly over-ripe melon.

Very little technical knowledge is actually needed for 90% of the items on the
checklist.  However, you will get the most out of it if you (or the friend you
bring along) know your way around the inside of an engine compartment.  Once
you've found the one you like, it can be very helpful to spend the $40 to have
a qualified mechanic who regularly works on that type of car spend an hour
testing and checking it out.  If there's anything wrong with the car, you will
make your $40 back by bargaining down the price.  If there's nothing wrong
with the car, you've bought some peace of mind.

There are five-parts to the checklist package.

o	Page 1:  Checklist part 1: General procedures, initial questions.
o	Page 2:  Checklist part 2: Exterior/interior examination checklist.
o	Page 3:  Checklist part 3: Engine running and test drive checklist.
o	Page 4:            part 4: A sample buyer-friendly Bill of Sale. 
o	Page 5:            part 5: A sample Federal odometer statement.

You can read and fill out the first part in the comfort of your home before
you go to see the car, then fill out second and third when you are there
checking the car out.  If things go satisfactory, go on to fill out the fourth
and fifth.  The idea for this checklist goes back to a small motorcycle list
once seen on rec.motorcycles.  Our checklist was developed by members of the
British cars e-mailing list (british-cars-request_at_autox.team_dot_net) for use when
looking at used and sometimes abused British sports cars. Thus, you'll notice
that some of the questions will be slanted in that direction and towards that
level of technology.  The checklist applies equally well to later model cars
and is picky to the point where only a relatively pristine car will come
through unscathed.  And of course, any flaws that you uncover can be used to
justify that insanely low offer that you are about to make for the car.  By
the time you are done running through the checklist, you'll probably know more
about condition of the car than the owner does.

Name:  		  		 	Phone: 	(h)
Address:					(w)
        				Date:

1.  Can you describe the car and its condition?	
2.  Does it run well?				
3.  How is the 
o	Body?
o	Paint?
o	Interior?
o	Tires?
o	Engine?
o	Brakes? 
o	Shocks?
o	Any Rust?:					         		
4.  Does it have Overdrive or Turbo? Does it work?
5.  What special features or options does it have? 		
6.  Why are you selling it? 
7.  How long have you owned it? ...had it for sale?
8.  Is it currently registered and licensed?
9.  Where is the car located? 
10.  How many miles does it have on it? (15K/yr)
11.  What problems have you had with the car?
12.  Has it ever been hit or in an accident?
13   What work does it need done on it now?
14.  How much are you asking for it? 
	      or What's the least you'll willing to take for it?

------ Some Questions to Ask Yourself ---------------------------------------

Why am I buying this car?			
o	Do I want to work on the car more than driving it?
o	Am I willing to pay a premium because someone else has already done most of
the serious work on the car?
What do I intend to do with it?         	
Will it be my commute vehicle?			
What service and support is locally available?
What is the most that I'm willing to pay for this car?   
Will I be driving it year-round or summer only?
What is the least that I think that the car can be had for?

------ Suggestions:
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Read some of the &quot;How to buy Used Cars&quot; books available at your library. 
They provide useful strategies     and cautions that go far beyond the scope
of this list.  Also, review this list carefully before using it.
2. Always inspect/take delivery of the vehicle in the broad daylight, never in
the evening/night or in the rain.
3. A clean piece of cardboard placed under the engine/trans after the
test-drive will help show fluid leaks.
4. In some states, older non-titled vehicles may be titled with just a bill of
sale.  Other states may     require an additional security bond to be posted. 
Use extreme caution in either of these cases!
5. Require seller have the vehicle pass all state inspections (safety,
emissions) at a mutually agreeable shop   (NOT one of his choosing) before you
pay for it. Old (&gt;30days) inspections are of absolutely no use to you.
6. A general guide to reading exhaust smoke:
oBlack smoke	=   unburned fuel
	Valves bad or out of adjustment?
	Carbs out of adjustment?
oBlue  smoke	=   burning oil
	Accelerating: Piston rings bad?
	Decelerating: Valve seats/guides bad?
oWhite smoke	=   burning coolant!
	Bad head gasket? 
	Warped or cracked Head or Block?$$

o	the 2 different spark plug sockets,

o	Clipboard, 
o	pen and hi-liter to use with a photocopy of this list, 
o	some cash, 
o	drivers license and copy of your insurance showing you are covered driving
the sellers car.
