&gt;
&gt;Howabout a trip thru NH, VT or even Cape Cod for part of the Eastern
&gt;Leg....Cape Cod is great in the late spring/early summer....the touristes
&gt;don't really start arriving and become annoying until &gt;7/4.
&gt;
&gt;I'd be glad to coordinate something on the Cape.


All right, finally we break through to the Far East. Boston is 8-10hrs away, 
count us in for anything between there and Maine. White/ Green Mountains NH, 
are great, except for those diesel Westies. Get your &quot;This vehicle smogged 
Mt Washington&quot; stickers here.  tim s.
