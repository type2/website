Subject: I got a bus! (so do the stats!)

After reading this list for about a year, and gazing longingly at
busses for much longer, I'm finally the proud owner of one of my own.

It's a pretty basic '65..  runs very well, and feels solid. basically
no rust.  Problems:

- windshield wipers don't work. will have to fix them soon, since I'm
  in rainy, rainy Oregon. Dunno what the problem is yet.

- the tranny seems to leak fluid very slowly - again, I haven't had
  time to investigate yet. I suppose I should be worried about this,
  but I think I got a decent price, even if this costs some
  money. Like I said, this thing is pretty nice, I think.

- It tends to stall out occasionally as I stop at a light or
  wherever. it always starts right up again, though. Any ideas on
  this? Can I just figure it's the chilly weather and maybe not
  warming it up enough? Are there some tricks on how to drive it to
  avoid this?  It seems to stall as I push in the clutch and brake,
  not while it's actually stopped.

- the interior isn't exactly plush yet - but we're working on it.

Anyway, I'm pretty happy...  I'm hoping to use it for some somewhat
lengthy camping trips this summer, and maybe drive it back east in the
fall if all goes well.  I remain rather technically clueless, but I'm
trying.

In sum, for the stats: '65.  Portland, OR.
(Oh, I'm not subscribed directly to the list - I read it through cmu's
bulletin board...)
