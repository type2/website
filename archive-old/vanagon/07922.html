&gt;&gt;Looks like I really riled you :).

Hi John:

You must be kidding! How could they be so cheap? Are you sure they are
in good shape? Do you feel anything wrong when sitting on them? Where did you
get them? Is the owner of the junkyard a friend to you? Are they real vanagon
seats? They are probably after maket used seats, you know?

OK OK.. the truth is.. Wait, promise me you won't tell anybody else first..

Ever since I had my first beetle I dreamed to sit on a bus someday. Ever since
I had my 2nd beetle I dreamed to own a bus. I was given a ride on a 77 camper
in 81. I saw a professor driving a Vanagon on campus in 82. I got my new 84
vanagon at the end of 83. The truth is the bus seats are terrible. The vanagon
seats are terrific. I think you have just got a real good deal. Still I just
can't believe it, $80 for a pair? You have got to understand how long it took
me and how much I paid to get to sit on my own Vanagon seats. I managed to get 
a 2nd one (a camper) 2 years ago. Can't be any happier when sitting on those
seats.

Now the real truth .. I think Vanagon seats are more comfortable than Volvo
seats. I can't be worng kaus I also have 2 volvos. One of them is a proud
Coup`e made in Itly by Bertoni (sp?).
