&gt; and it seems to be a hit-or-miss thing with new batteries, even. i once went
&gt; through three Sears Diehards in six months ... but that last one was still on
&gt; the car when i sold it five years later.
&gt; 
&gt; by the way, Wal-Mart has Champion batteries with better warranties and cheaper
&gt; prices (than Sears). just a thought.

I bought one of those Champion batteries.  Lasted less than a month.  Cost
me $100 to have my charging system diagnosed because I couldn't believe it
was the brand new battery that was the problem.  I have had excellent
experiences with the Die Hard batteries, *except* for the Die-Hard Gold.
This one will never recover if it ever gets completely drained, unlike the
standard Die-Hard, which lives up to its name.  YMMV on all of this, of
course...
