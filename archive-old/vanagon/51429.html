Subject: Pertronix causing problems with emissions

I have a 1971 VW Bus with a brand new 1641 engine (1000 miles) and I am
having problems getting the HC level low enough to pass Arizona's emissions.

I took the bus to my mechanic (who specializes in VW's) and he told me that
the Pertronix Ignitor that I have installed is possibly causing the problem.
I am inclined to agree with him since as I stated above, this is a new
engine and I have no reason to believe that anything else is causing the
problem.  

Has anyone else had a problem with their Pertronix Ignitor and passing
emissions?  If so, what did you have to do to pass?

Also, I am having a problem with the adjuster on my #3 cylinder exhaust
valve.  Every time that I adjust the valve, within 5 minutes of running the
engine, the rocker arm starts to tap again.  I have adjusted this valve
several times and keep getting the same result.  It does not appear to go
any farther than .010.  The engine does have push rods that were the cut to
size type.  Does anyone have any ideas on this?

Thanks for you help.
