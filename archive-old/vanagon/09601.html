I guess the next step for those of us interested
is to determine if it is possible for everyone to meet
or if it would be better for a separate north and south 
gathering. I know I personally, being in a '67 bus,
would definately prefer not to drive more than a couple hundred miles.
Perhaps it would be easier to save the LOOOOOOOONG trips for the big
summer thing.
However, I am certainly willing to see what will happen...
Richard, the interested
