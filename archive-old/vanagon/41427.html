Subject: Re: My Kombi is now official!

&gt;I'm proud to say that my '62 Kombi has now fulfilled its destiny of being
&gt;both a passenger and commercial vehicle.  I had a gig last night and I
&gt;transported my harpsichord to it in the bus.  The Westy bed makes a great
&gt;cushioned platform for transporting fragile stuff.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, VW A.G. might not have envisioned typical deliveries being made
&gt;in black tie.  :-)

        Bah! That's nothing... I transport *my* instrument *everywhere I
go* in my bus, come rain or shine, tux or t-shirt...
        Of course, my instrument does have a _slightly_ more durable
carrying case than your harpsichord...   ;-)

Peace,
