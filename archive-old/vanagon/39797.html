Subject: Stroking a type 4

I just acquired this nice looking '72 bus and somewhere inside in
boxes are remains of a type 4 . If nothing else I'm an optimist.
The engine was in the process of throwing the #3 rod when they shut
her down. The rod is in one piece but twisted . The bearing surface
on the crank is a dark blue. The journals in case look good just eye-
balled. One of the flanges has been broken off around one bolt hole,
as tho they removed it with the bolt still in there. Piece is gone so
I'll have to fab and weld back in.
 My plan is to get as much low end torque as I possibly can, so we're
talking stroke here right?  How much can you do one of these lovelies?
  I towed it home with a Corvair Van on a 3 foot tow bar. 
 The 140 hp in the van was nice, the three ft tow bar was the worst
mistake I've made and not paid for in a long time.
   Your comments of wisdom are all welcome  :     TIA    west
