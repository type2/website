Subject: Re: anyone going to Burning Man?

Mark McCulley asked:

&gt;Anyone planning to go to Burning Man in Nevada next week?

I'm not, but I read a rather extensive article in the Reno newpaper
about it.

Seems that the BLM has gotten on the organizer's case and they are
moving the event to a privately-owned ranch.  They are also charging
something like $65 or $75 a head to get in!  I'm not quite sure how they
are going to do the grand finale, as the ranch is in a brushy area, not
on a dry lake and the fire danger thereabouts is pretty high!

Of course, this doesn't mean that you can't go to the original location
in the Black Rock Desert!

Take lots of water and be safe!
