&gt;Seriously, how would you tell if the engine had been rebuilt?  If it was

you can't. anymore than you can tell whether it was driven by some little
old lady who only went to church on sundays. the single most common facet of
the sale of used cars is: Lies, Lies, Lies. period. and if it isn't a lie,
it's an exaggeration! :) same thing in real estate.

it seems that the higher the price, the bigger the lies. look at politics! ;)

so what can you do? well ... nothing, really. you pays your money and you
takes your chances. the only protection is information: the more you know,
the &quot;better&quot; your decision. only problem is, emotion gets in the way ...
you WANT this bus!

remember, kiddies:  if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
