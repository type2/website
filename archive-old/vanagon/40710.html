Subject: '76, FI Bus:  problems with smoke


To all:

Some of you may have gotten that the message earlier that my '76 was for
sale.  Well it still is.... $500 firm.  I haven't had a lot of responses.
That's o.k..... I guess I really am not in hurry.  To those that I haven't
replied to:	-Bus runs strong (with a slight problem... I will talk
		 about that in a moment, its the real reason why I 
		 posted this)
	
		-I does have surface rust-- but very minor and no holes
	         through the floors (in fact they are cleaner than the
	         exterior)

		-The engine is a rebuild... it has a fair amount of miles
 		 I think the compression loss is up to about 15% max. No
		 documented history (whaddya expect for $500?)

	     	-Body is straight with very minor dings... interior is 
		 pretty clean... could use new floor lining.  The middle
		 bench seat is pretty beat up though.


The problem that I just begun to experience is the reason why I posted
this note now.... and it is something some of you who interested in the
bus should know about.  In essence the problem is this:  with the muffler
attached to the cat. converter, the engine will begin to smoke heavily 
about 5 minutes after start up and last until about 10 minutes after
start up (about the time it takes the cat. converter to heat up).  With
the muffler off the problem doesn't exist.  Furthermore, as one increases
the rpm the smoke will dwindle.  I would like to fix the problem, cause
I enjoy tinkering.  I would guess it would have to do with the PCV valve
incorrectly passing blow by into the intake.  There are a couple of 
reasons I think it is this:

	1)  The problem began suddenly... bad rings or valve guides
	    would happen more slowly?  right?

	2)  The fact that the smoke happens when the muffler is attached
	    tells me that the back pressure is forcing the blow-by
	    build up (I know this doesn't make much sense ... maybe I 
	    shouldn'
t say &quot;force&quot;.... but I am still foggy about the problem)

	3)  e
xcessive crankcase pressure is causing some oil to bubble out the oil 
	   fill an dipstick area.

Anyone with ideas on tracking down the PCV valve and/or tracing the 
problem?
