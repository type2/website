Subject:      Re: '86 GL tuning advise

Eric,
I recently discovered that there are in fact two timing marks on the
pulley wheel:
----------^----&gt;F
---u-----------&gt;R
The &quot;u&quot; mark is TDC for cylinder #1. The &quot;^&quot; mark is 5% ahead of TDC.
This is the mark that should be aligned with the block split line.
Is it possible that you accidentally set your timing 10% ahead of TDC?

I have done a complete tune up on my '86 GL. I found it difficult though
to
determine the degree of timing advance using the methods described in my
VW
mech's manual and here by list members. Using a timing light and
adjusting the
pulley notch to what appears to 5degrees advanced of the block seem (2k
RPM,
temp sensor disconnected) the van runs terrible. No power. with it
advanced to
what appears to be 40-45 degrees advanced the van runs incredibly strong
and
cool with no audible knock. In fact at this setting it is well short of
where I
begin to hear knock under load.&gt;&gt; snip
