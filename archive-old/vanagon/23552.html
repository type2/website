Subject: re: piston slapped

You can bet I'll be listening hard upon start-up for the dreaded EV
&quot;diesel&quot; sound.  Unless there's some difference between the motors, I
would think all gas engines have, or will develop, this problem.  Did they 
have to take the head off to diagnose it?  Did they say how they're going to
fix it? 

I wish you luck!
