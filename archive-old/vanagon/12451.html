As if we didn't get enough traffic on this list already!  Putting that on 
the back of *my* van could double list activity, imagine what the volks 
with the Porsche engines and V-6's would get!

IMVHO, I suggest we all just go out and buy doll-sized flannel Dr. 
Dentons (button flap optional for the Westy volk) as antenna pennants.  You 
want to put some prunes in them, you go right ahead ;-)

BTW, I will be switching ISP's real soon now, I am very tired of putting 
up with Netcom. I will be switching to ari_dot_net as soon as they hook me 
up.  so
