Subject: Electrical Cover

Hi Volks,

 To the point..the 1982 Westfalia is in need of an electrical cover, that
is, the cover that goes on the outside of the van where the water hookups
are located. VW wants $25 for the thing with the hinge pin. The color is
black with the graphics in white.

 Does anyone know of a source that has them cheaper? Or, does anyone has one
that wouldn't mind selling? I was told that Bus Boys would have parts for
the Vanagons. I requested a catalog three months ago. I don't think they'll
be sending one. Either way, help in this matter is appreciated.

 Thanks!
