Subject: Diesel swap

Does anyone have an inkling of how well a diesel to gas motor swap
works out in an 84 vanagon? Ive got a line on an 84 westi with a
diesel/stick that doesn't work that I want to change to an 1800
rabbit/auto. I am curious how easy or difficult the swap is and does it
make for a better vehicle?
