Pulled the handle off the sliding door, took it down to the local locksmith.
 Having gone through this with Grendel, I was nervous as a nun at short-arm
inspection.  Up in Washington, it took forty-two bucks and three tries for
the 'best automotive locksmith in town' to make me one key.

The local shop makes no claim to being good with cars but the fellow took the
handle, punched the numbers into his computer (!) and made me a key.  Fifteen
bucks.  Took him mebbe five minutes.  In Washington it took days, several
conferences and nearly three times the gilt.  Like I said, competence isn't a
hot issue in the PNW.

Back home, I unlocked the Rocket's steering column, re-attached the steering
gear, dismantled my hay-wired tow-bar and prepared to play mechanic.  

In my earlier post I said the Rocket didn't have an engine, which isn't
exactly correct.  Her Type IV engine vanished with the ex-husband but someone
tried to install an upright engine in its place.  No air-cleaner.  Big hole
in the muffler.  No engine compartment seals.  No oil in the thing, although
it did turn over when coaxed with a wrench.

Knowing it would be easier to park if it was moving under its own power,  I
removed the battery, distributor and carb.  The battery because it was dead
and corroded all to hell, the carb because it was just about blocked shut
with black, greasy stuff, and the distributor because the vacuum can was
busted.

With the carb out of the way I discovered the vacuum line to the brake
booster was broken and the throttle cable frozen, or nearly so.  Wires all
clotted with oily residue.  Coil attached to the blower housing with sheet
metal screws and not even a VW coil, to boot.  But since it fell off when I
touched it I don't suppose it really matters.

Plugged in a spare distributor, bolted on a spare carb, took the gas can off
the engine stand and plumbed it directly to the carb.  Got the spare battery
out of the '65 bus, plopped it in place.  Cleaned up the cables and connected
them.  Got the idiot lights to work but not much else.

The new key turned and the starter cranked the engine.  Gave it some more gas
and there was this hellatious explosion.  Blew the oil filler cap right off
the engine.  Put a dent in the top of the engine compartment and gave the cap
a nice mushroom shape.  Apparently one of the pistons has a hole in it.  I
guess I shoulda checked the compression.

Got too dark to make any more mistakes so I left it until tomorrow.  Things
usually go better on Fridays.  I'll get Roland Wilhelmy to come over and give
me a hand.  If he gets his head right in the engine compartment while I'm up
front twisting the key mebbe he can spot something I've missed.  Besides, one
explosion a week is my limit :-)

PS -  My thanks to the list for the many suggestions on how to unlock the
steering column without using a key.  Unfortunately, I was not able to try
some of the more adventurous methods, being fresh out of hand grenades, and
not having two pounds of Vaseline, a rubber sheet and a goat...  oops, wrong
list.
