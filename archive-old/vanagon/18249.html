 &gt; &gt;&gt;ANY two power sources connected in PARALLEL have the potential for circulating
 &gt; &gt;&gt;current between that is wasted (i.e. not dissipated in the load).

 &gt; Well, aren't the batteries recharging each other that way? 
 &gt; 
Not necessarily.  One charges the other only if the one being charged
has not reached maximum charge capacity.  If it has, the marginal difference
between the voltages of the units (even though they are spec'ed at 12V,
they are not *exactly* 12.0000000V volts, they vary).  the differential
of voltage will cause a current to flow, causing a waste of energy.  

As batteries get used, the differences become more prevalent, hence
causing the drain of energy to become more significant.
