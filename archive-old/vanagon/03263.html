About a filler cap, well when i purge the air from mine
i follow the bently procedure but ,at each step, add coolant to the small hole
at the radiators upper passenger side with a turkey baster. i suppose you
could do this anytime, but even filling it this way, there's always air in the lines that still must be purged.
