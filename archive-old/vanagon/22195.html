Subject: 82 Westy

Looked at a *beautiful* 82 Westy this weekend.  It's been exceptionally
well-cared for.  But (isn't there always a but?).  But, it has 138,000 on
the original engine.  Despite the owner's insistance that it's going to run
forever, I can't imagine this engine's got too much longer.  Otto's engine
(an identical 2000) made 108,000 with regular oil changes &amp; a fairly
meticulous owner.  Anybody heard of a 2000 going &quot;forever&quot;?  I've got my
doubts and I don't want an immediate rebuild on my hands.
