  You lucky guy, my '74 won't pull past 80 mph on level ground.

&gt; please don't kill me...
&gt; 
&gt; as a healthy, red blooded, hormonally laden twenty year-old i had to try
&gt; and max out my bus the other day.  got to an indicated speed of
&gt; ninety-five {yeah- 95} mph before i decided that i really didn't want to
&gt; pay for _another_ rebuild [and those trees didn't look too inviting
&gt; anyway].  i know, i know, why drive any car that fast, let alone a
&gt; bredloaf...sometimes one has to be stupid (i normally drive 60-64). so
&gt; here's the question...why is everybody else to pleased to be going seventy??
&gt; i had a bunch of pedal left....
&gt; (100mph?  not for me thanks!)
