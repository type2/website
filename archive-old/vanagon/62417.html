Michael,

Those round &quot;speed&quot; stickers on the back of the trucks and certain cars are 
the maximum speed those vehicles can travel....you exceed the speedlimit on 
your truck....and get caught you pay a hefty fine.

I seem to recall France having a similar system....in fact if you are a 
&quot;novice&quot; driver you need a sticker on the back of your car warning the rest 
of the world of your &quot;noviceness&quot;...
