Subject: 87 Synchro-buy it?

Dub-sters,

 I have found a one owner 87 Synchro Vanagon w/ 87k. Asking about $3k. New
exhaust, don't know many other details... formerly used by handicapped so,
the van is bare behind the front seats. Any thoughts on conversions? Is
this a dog? Or should I jump?

 Thanks in advance for your help.                                       R.
