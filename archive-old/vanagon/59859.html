Hi Ron,
Had a similar problem with my '87...  Can't remember the specifics, but seems
I remember something about a burned out &quot;Idle speed motor&quot;.  This bad motor
also caused some sort of little black box to short out etc. causing similar
problems after the engine warmed up.

A tune up had to be done to help isolate the problem, and the resulting bill
using a mix of new and used parts came to $700!   I still have the slow
acceleration problem mentioned by several people:  Sluggish acceleration
after idling at a stop for more than 10 seconds......  If I keep the revs up
a little just before taking off,  all seems well.

Because of these types of problems with the VW engine setup,  I am
considering a Subaru engine,  which has caused me to be added to a list of
&quot;Subversives&quot; mentioned earlier in the list.

Good luck...  I'm still waiting to see if anyone has the answer to the
sluggish start from idle.   My old '71 Bus leaves my Syncro in the dust (but
not in the snow).

Curt Long
