Subject:      shifted to death: back to the living

Thanks to all who passed on their wealth of knowledge, muchly appreciated.

The results and in and the problem was...........

The clutch plate was blown apart, the dampner springs on the clutch plate
were not doing their job because the rivets that hold the clutch plate
together were not there doing their job.

Ever since we got the van I have always had a tough time to master the
clutch, (remember rattling granny's teeth out), when the repair shop had
the tranny off I went in and looked at the van, rear main seal was leaking
slightly, cheap part to replace so it was done.

The van now drives like a dream(except for the power steering saga
problems)

clutch feels great to release and hey, granny won't have to switch to a
better denture cream!

Even though I didn't &quot;get in touch with my van&quot;, by getting a good look
around and seeing the parts out was a big benefit to me, maybe next time
I'll do more.

Thanks to all again who spoke words of wisdom.
