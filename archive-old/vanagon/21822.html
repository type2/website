Subject: Not that I'm complaining...(non-bus posts.)

I really like the vanagon list. It's extremely informative, and has
a lot of knowledgable people who give good advice. (I used to be 
subbed to that OTHER VW list, but fascism tends to turn me off, so
I unsubscribed. I even like the noise, and the non-bus posts, but it
can get overwhelming at times.
  To get to the point, I would like for everyone on the vanagon list 
to vote for the rec.autos.vw split, to give us an unmoderated forum
for these discussions. If you're opposed to the split, then vote no.
If you're indifferent, please vote yes, and grant us people who really
want the split a chance. Now I'll quit wasting bandwidth on off-topic
stuff. &lt;g&gt;
