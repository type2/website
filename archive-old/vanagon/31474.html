&gt;I spent half an hour this morning peeling it off, since I'm sure the bus
&gt;will look a lot better without them -- less fancy and more straightforward.
&gt;Some sections peeled right off easy but others are requiring a razor blade
&gt;and a lot of effort, since the tape has fused to the paint in places and
&gt;I've pulled little pieces of paint off in the process of removal.  Anyone
&gt;else have experience with this sort of detailing tape and how best to remove
&gt;it?
&gt;
3M makes a product (I'm sure other mfrs do too) for just such applications.
 I think the 3M name is General Purpose Adhesive Remover.  It's available at
automative paint supply stores.  Remember to test it on your paint in an out
of the way location before attacking the visible areas.

Good luck!
