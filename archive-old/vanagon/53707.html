While checking out a web site (www.steelerubber_dot_com) of a place that
supplies reproduction molded and extruded rubber parts for American cars, I
found they are marketing a device for emissions control that performs a
similar function as a catalytic converter. I thought it might be a useful
bit of info for someone of the folk trying to get vehicles (older/restored?)
to pass local smog where the rules do not mandate the exact original
configuration but only achieving specified emissions levels (smarter than
how it is here in CA!).   The following is copied and pasted directly from
their web page for this device:

====================
What is the ECD(tm)? 

The Emissions Control Device offers a cleaner, more
efficient method of removing harmful chemicals that are
produced by automobiles than a catalytic converter. The
ECD(tm) operates independently of the engine and requires
no special components, making it easy to install and
maintain. 

How does it work? 

The electronic control attaches to any switched 6-12 volt
power source. Then the ignitor creates a plasma field in
which the remaining unburned hydrocarbons are exploded.
The exhaust stream flows through an oxidizing chamber,
completing the cleansing process. The unit comes with
standard 2 inch exhaust pipe ends, adapters for various pipe
sizes are readily available. Though the standard model adds
very little back-pressure, an EDC(tm) PRO model with a
three inch opening for serious street/strip racing applications
will be available by late spring 1996. The ECD(tm) can be
installed in less than 30 minutes by a mechanic. 

Is there a warranty/guarantee? 

The ECD(tm) will last 100,000 miles or five years,
guaranteed. The stainless steel housing can be used again by
simply replacing the inner components. A catalytic
converter sometimes lasts as few as 50,000 miles and is
complicated and costly to replace. 

What are the differences between ECD(tm) and
computer/catalytic converter solutions? 

    The ECD(tm) is fully operational in 30 seconds, a
    catalytic converter takes 20 minutes. 
    The ECD(tm) operates at normal engine temperature
    (150&lt;-200&lt;F) and requires little shielding. A typical
    catalytic converter will not operate efficiently until it
    reaches 600&lt;F, requiring extensive shielding and
    computerized fuel control systems. 
    The ECD(tm) operates efficiently with leaded,
    unleaded fuels, propane and natural gas while a
    catalytic converter operates with unleaded fuels only. 
    The ECD(tm) operates independently and externally
    from the engine. A catalytic converter requires internal
    engine feedback systems and computer fuel control
    systems to operate. 
    The ECD(tm) has a guaranteed performance for 5
    years or 100,000 miles. Most catalytic converter
    systems guaranteed only 50,000 miles, then may
    require extensive system replacements. 
    The ECD(tm) delivers lower levels of carbon
    monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), and oxides
    of nitrogen (NOx). A catalytic converter delivers
    higher levels of pollutants than the ECD(tm). 

What are the future Environmental Protection
Agency guidelines and how will ECD(tm) meet or
exceed them? 

Tests performed on the ECD(tm) proved that emissions of
harmful chemicals are at levels much lower than the
standards set by the EPA. These figures are based on a
standard high mileage vehicle tested by the Environmental
Research &amp; Development Corporation (the only EPA
approved test lab on the east coast). The test figures are in
grams per mile weighted mass.

*The ECD(tm) qualifies through the year 2010 for
emissions. No standards exist beyond that. 

What are the advantages of the ECD(tm)? 

    Low warm-up time (30 seconds) 
    Low heat output (200&lt; F) 
    Fuel versatility (leaded, unleaded, propane and natural
    gas) 
    Retrofit ability 
    System independence (no vehicle controls) 
    Long lasting (guaranteed 100,000 miles or 5 years) 
    Improved performance (lower levels of CO, THC,
    NOx) 
    Environmentally safe exhaust by-products (steam,
    oxygen, carbon dioxide) 
    Easier and safer disposal method (recyclable and land
    fill friendly) 

The advantages of the ECD(tm) are both environmental and
economic. The ECD(tm) will reduce the amount of harmful
chemicals that enter the atmosphere. In addition, the
Emissions Control Device will reduce the total cost of
emissions control. 

What is Steele Rubber Products role in all of this? 

Steele Rubber Products is broadening its interest in the
antique car hobby by including the ECD(tm). Steele Rubber
Products is partnered with the inventor of the ECD(tm),
Unlimited Technologies International, Inc. Steele Rubber
Products has exclusive world- wide rights to sell and
distribute the ECD(tm) via phone, fax, mail, and the
Internet to end users. To expand availability of the ECD(tm)
to the antique car market, Steele Rubber Products will be
making the ECD(tm) available to qualified automobile
restoration retailers. 

For more information, please contact Steele Rubber
Products.
