Subject: $5 Bus Parts?! Discount Madness Sale!! (Revisited)

Here's what's left in the final hours of our sale:

&gt;-Instrument panel (includes Speedo &amp; gas guage with blockoff plate for clock
&gt; for 68-75 Bus -- Grey  face)    $5

I thought someone would want this instrument panel--no instrumentalists out
there?

&gt;-12volt electric &quot;Back Seat Heat&quot; &quot;Heater&quot;. Sold through JC Whitney for $90!
&gt; Crazy Ron won't lie:  this thing makes a nice red glow but don't count on it
&gt; heating your VW.  Use it to prove to your  friends that, amazingly, a 12v
&gt; heater will not heat a VW bus--or come up with your own creative uses
&gt; (external 12v aquarium heater for your bus's tropical fish tank??).  Comes
&gt; with a wiring  harness, switch, and a manual if I can find it.  Guaranteed
&gt; to work, but not to heat  $5

Wow, can't believe the heater hasn't sold yet--did I mention it was safety
tested and approved by Ralph Nader as heat-hazard-free? ;-)

Act fast, these things won't be around forever (in this form).   And
remember all proceeds get converted into liquid, fermented, bottled, and
shipped to Gerry.
