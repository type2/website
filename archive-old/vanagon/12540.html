Subject: RE: weakly stats: how many possums crossed the road?

would it be possible to put this in tab delimited format so I could paste it 
into excel 5.0, or is it already in tab delimited format??

PS:  could you specify things like westie campers vs 7 passenger vanagons, 
syncro doublecab vs 2wd doublecab, etc so that there is a more definitive 
listing?    THx   :-)
