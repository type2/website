Subject: Re: VDO Trip/odometer repairs- Phoenix

&gt;I just called Dick's Speed-o-tach in Phoenix to see if I could buy the gear
for my '83 Westy/Vanagon with the dead tripmeter and odometer. I was told
that they could not sell just the gear. Oh, I see. Is this Due to the State
of Arizona regulations? No, It's because we are the only supplier for the
gears. (Honest ver batum quote-sorry about the Latin) We can only repair the
guage for $65. over the counter or $125.00 in the car with a two hour turn
around either way. It's a very common problem she said. Yeah, it sounds like
it says I.
Hmmm...

Shouldn't I really think they wanted to say: &quot;We won't sell just the gear
because we bloody don't want to sell just a $2.00 gear when we can bend you
over for an additional $63.- $123.&quot;  DOH! I think I heard someone saying,
&quot;Lack of competition~ go find a junk yard or take Joel's advice Rusty!&quot;
