Subject: electric mirrors

Hello again.
Another thing attempted-unsuccesfully-this weekend was the electric
mirrors. The one on the driver's side only moves from right to left, the
passenger one doesn't move at all. I can hear a &quot;click&quot; each time I move
the switch, though. 
Dissasembled the whole driver's side unit today. Cleaned connections,
checked everything and did the procedure mentioned in Bentley to
increase adjustment range (66.3), but this didn't fix the problem. 
Checked the archives, with no luck. Can anybody help? I am sure I am not
the first one with this problem... 
Thank you.
Cris.
