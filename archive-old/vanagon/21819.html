Subject: An experience at Averrie's....

A couple months ago, I agreed to put new floor pan halves in this
guy's notch..[long story deleted]..since I don't believe they make
floor pans for type3's new, he had to get some cut out of some
other T3 or another. $200.00 PER SIDE (ouch!) is what I think he paid.
They were very nicely wrapped in cardboard, wrapped with plastic, and I 
didn't think too much about them, so I broke my cardinal rule about
buying parts: ALWAYS inspect EVERY part you get BEFORE you drive 200
miles away! (It's tattooed on my forehead now. Looks kinda strange.:)
Anyway, cut the old (nonexistant) pans out, and proceeded with the 
unwrapping. Uh...there's a rust hole. there's another one. There's a
big `un. Well, I had the guy call them up, and explain to them that the
pans they sold him were garbage. They basically said: `tough' at first,
but eventually said we can go exchange them. Now, as unimpressed as I was
with the quality of the first set, I didn't see much of a reason to
drive 200+ miles to exchange them for another (possibly) rusty set.
Anyways, the pans I got were repairable, so I patched them up, installed
them, and off the notch went.
I still want to go check out the yard though. When I was there, they were
closed, and I only got to look through the fence. :(
