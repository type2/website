Subject: Vacuum leak question

I have had some trouble starting my '84 Westy.  While poking around the
engine compartment I found a cracked vacuum hose.  I checked the Bentley
manual and I can't find any info on vacuum.  I was wondering what vacuum
(in mm of mercury) I should expect at various RPMs.  Also, is there an
easy way to check for vacuum leaks.  Are there any specific components
in the vacuum system that I should specifically check.  Also,  I have air
conditioning and do not have power steering if either of those make a
difference.  

thanks,

John Brown
