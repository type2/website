TWIMC;
A nifty trick I use is to cut the bottom off, at an angle, on  an old
empty plastic oil container to make a funnel. The neck on a Castrol
bottle fits snuggly in the tube and if I get the angle cut correctly the
opening on the funnel will be parallel to the ground.
Good Luck

&gt;flap...just pure talent.
