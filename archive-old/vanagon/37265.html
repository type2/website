Subject: Re: Interior roof mold

&gt;
&gt;At the risk of asking another YAFAQ, my brother has requested I try to find
&gt;a remedy for the increasing presence of moisture and mold on the inside of
&gt;the roof to his '81 Westy.  We live in Vancouver, Canada, a very damp
&gt;climate, especially in winter.  Is there any way to control this problem?
&gt;Any recommended methods for removing existing mold?
&gt;

Dri-Z-Air capsules (some salt suspended over a plastic dish) help. Another
trick is a small 2-3 watt electric heater. Both of these solutions are used
by people with boats out there and seem to work fairly well. The heaters
have no spark and are safe enough to use on boats. You can usually find the
Dri-Z-Air things in hardware stores, but you may have to visit a marine
shop for the little electric heaters.

Fresh air and bleach/water solution are the best way to get rid of the
ubiquitious PNW mold/mildew. (My truck is growing algae on it this year!)
I use the bleach/water followed by a pressure wash on my house &amp; decks
every year - takes it right off.
