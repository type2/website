&lt;&lt; What are the pro's and con's of rust proofing? &gt;&gt;

I think Dealer and after market &quot;rust-proofing&quot; is BOGUS. Anyone who has
served time at sea will tell you, there is no such thing as rustproofing
ferrous metal.

If you truely want to rust proof your vehicle:

1) wash thouroughly after any salt experience, ESPECIALLY the underbody.

2) don't let rust get started. In the same way you eat lots of veggies and
avoid asbestos to keep cancer out of your body, keep a close eye on the
places and situations where rust starts. Like cancer, it is tough to get rid
of once it is started, but simpler to prevent.

3) In this light, grab two gallons of the wonderful &quot;Kool Patch&quot; stuff I
recomended in a posting a couple of weeks ago. This is (virtually/exactly?)
the same thick goooey asphalt and rubber under coating that VW applied at the
factory. Use a 3&quot; brush and spend an afternoon with your van on jackstands,
brushing this thick (like chocolate pudding) gunk into all of the cracks and
crevices. This will keep water and salt off your metal, and keep your
original undercoating from drying out and flaking off. Further, you will
notice the sound-deadening qualities from your first drive after application.

4) Don't be dumb. Pontiac loves to show its cars flying down the shoreline,
splashing in the waves like a teenager. Unfortunately, zipping through
puddles, streams and (in particular) salty water forces these corrosives deep
into places (like the top of your fuel tank) where it normally wouldn't go,
and it tough to remove. Be cool, and drive SLOWLY through water.

I believe these measure to be far more lasting than any &quot;rustproofing&quot; you
can spend your hard-earned dollar on.

blessings, as always,
