Subject: engine rebuild in FL

IF you are just rebuilding the top end (valves/head gaskets), that can be 
done witout pulling the engine according to the bently manual. Now it 
will probably be easier to work on all that stuff with the motor out.

Pulling the motor in the vanagon is about the same as pulling a bug 
motor. Back it up on some ramps or put it on GOOD jack stands. Disconnect 
and mark electric, fuel, emission, coolant lines (optional in your bug). 
Put a hydralic jack under the motor. Unbolt the rear motor mount Unbolt 
the motor from the trans. wiggle it loose and lower the jack. piece of 
cake, and i didn't even get greasy this time.

Peace,
