Subject:      Emergency - Need ECU

My attempts to locate an ECU have been met with stone walls everywhere
I've called.  I've got everything else being FEDEXed overnight to my
house to go back to Klamath to fix my Westfalia, but I really need this
ECU if it really turns out to be the problem.  If a listmember, Ron
Salmon, etc., can help with either a good used or rebuilt ECU, please
contact me immediately at the phone number below.  I need this by
tomorrow by UPS Red or FEDEX Overnight so I can get up there to get the
Westy out of the AAA Contract building to avoid paying more per day
storage fees.

Thanks to anyone for this help - it's appreciated.
