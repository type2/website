Subject: Re: Should I buy this bus?

David, if you're buying a project, don't spend $3500 on it up front. By 
the time you get $3500 into it, you should have a *nice* bus. I bought 
mine a couple months ago for $700; I've put another couple hundred into 
it and by the time I'm done (that is, by the time it's repainted, motor 
rebuilt, etc.), I won't have more than $2500 into it...and I'll have the 
joy of knowing I transformed a dog into a nice bus. BTW, this one is 
already a campmobile with good top and interior. I too had some rust and 
even some rust-through near the wheel wells...but I'm not paying nearly 
as much...and the bus is mechanically sound (though it did drop my clutch 
cable this morning).

Look at yesterday's posting of two t2's in Austin for $800. For another 
$$2700, you could probably have 2 nice buses. (a splitty and a campmobile).

IMHO...Joe Fournier '71 Campmobile

&gt; I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
&gt; advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of 
&gt; rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  The 
&gt; engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression 
&gt; on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic 
&gt; transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.
&gt; I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a 
&gt; Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is 
&gt; too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into 
&gt; a camper.
