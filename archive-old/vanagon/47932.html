Subject: FS: 88 Doublecab synchro???

Saw in the Buy &amp; Sell today:

88 VW Doublecab, all wheel drive, 1of a kind, $18,995, Westminster VW

Is this a synchro?

Note that these are Canadian dollars.  Also these are the guys that were asking 
$7000 for a beat up piece of crap 77 Westy that I saw when I was checking out the 
market value of my 78 that got totalled.  So I think their list prices are in the 
neightbourhood of twice what they actually get.
