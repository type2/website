&lt;&lt;OK so, I just bought this vanagon and if I let it set for a couple
of days the tappets knock...&gt;&gt;

We have an '83 that sounds like woodpeckers are mating in it.  The taps 
die out after it warms up, in a couple of minutes.  No smoke, 
though...had a Honda with 200,000 miles -- been there, done that with the 
smoke.
