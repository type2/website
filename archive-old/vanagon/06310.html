&gt; Hi Harold, 
&gt; I realize this comes awhile after your posting, but I just got around to
&gt; reading it.  I posted about this topic awhile ago, but apparently you missed
&gt; it.  Strip the old screen out and get some fiberglass netting from a hardwar
&gt; e store.  Cut the screen to fit and glue it in with a hot glue gun.  You can
&gt; get a cheapy one for ~$10.  Get crafts glue that will allow you to move the
&gt; screen while the glue sets up.  Glue one side, let it setup, tack the other 
&gt; side at 4 or 5 spots.  Then do the same to the other two sides.  If it's not
&gt; taut enough pull up the tack spots and redo them.  Once you're happy with it,
&gt; lay down a nice bead all the way around, trim left over screening and reinstall.

I guess my post was too vague.  Everyone who responded seems to think that
I already have screens in the side sliding windows.  I don't, just the
sliding windows.  I was looking for a way to add screens yet still be
able to slide the glass window or somehow remove the screens on my 1987
Vanagon.

Thanks anyway, your method does sound better than the way I would have
tried that sort of replacement.
 
&gt; Happy trails,
&gt; Jack
