Subject: 1980 air cooled engines


&gt;
&gt; I recently purchased a 1980 westy and now it needs a motor job. Ever since
&gt;I bought it I've only had problems. First an oil leak. Next (after I had a
&gt;seal job done) the motor blew oil everywhere and &quot;BANG!&quot; that was it. There
&gt;is little compression and it needs new sleeves and pistons. My mechanic
&gt;said it would be quite expensive to rebuild and that volkzwagon 2 litre air
&gt;cooled engines are not easy to come by in Nova Scotia, Canada. How much
&gt;would a new engine cost? Can anyone out there help me find one? Or at least
&gt;a half decent rebuilt one. I don't want to sell it but at this rate yet,  I
&gt;don't believe I have much of a choice.
&gt;                                        Help!, Shawna


Hello Shawna,

Try Mark Stephens in Tehachapi, CA. He's been on the leading edge for
Vanagon engines since they came out. He replaces the oil galley plugs in
that case that tend to pop out and make you lose all your oil real quick,
and replaces the problematic valve seats in the heads so they will never
come out. He's been around a long time and has an excellent reputation, and
on top of this his engines are priced right! His address is:

               
                                21800 Oak Summit Court
                                Tehachapi, CA 93561
                                Phone: 805.822.5678
                                Fax: 805.822.0223

Give him a call!
