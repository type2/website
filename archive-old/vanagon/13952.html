&gt; Have you considered that you may have been bucking a headwind on the start
&gt; of your journey, and had a tailwind to blow you home?
&gt; 
&gt; When I'm driving west on a long journey, the drive can get a little shaky
&gt; because I am driving into the wind.  We've all experienced the mix of a
&gt; strong wind and the Bus' handling characteristics.  But driving east, I get
&gt; blown all the way across the states, and my gas mileage is a lot better!

Well actually I got better mileage on the return trip predominantly
westward against primarily east winds, winds that day were mostly
southeasterly, I thought about this as a cause, but believe me I
was driving into them hard on the way back on a sub freezing night at
midnight with the heater giving me no more than a 10 degree temperature
increase over the ambient 12 to 14 F.  I was acutely aware of everything
particularly the fact the wind was hitting my right front causing me
to float all over the place.  Maybe the reduced coeeficient of friction
between me and the ground was improving the mileage (hah, hah). Well
whatever the cause as I mentioned the improvement seems to have kept as
the new owner is doing better that 20 in mixed 75/25 highway/city
driving.
