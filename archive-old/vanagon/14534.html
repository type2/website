&gt; You know I don't think that all the data is in regarding vanagons. For
&gt; example I was told by the parts guy at my local VW dealer that they had
&gt; service a Vanagon with a watercooled six. I, of course, with my vast (or
&gt; is it half-vasted?) knowledge disputed this, but he held firm to his story.
&gt; Our collective canon of Vanagon lore is not chiselled on tablets.

I forgot to say that it was an inline 6, Volvo.
