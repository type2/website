Subject: Paint/Int. Code Confusion


&gt;ie i ASSUME that 523907 on my 65' westy means that my bus originally was a
&gt;(52) pearl white westy w/ (39) mesh grey (is this the same as &quot;salt n'
&gt;peppa&quot; fabric??) interior and a (07) ??? . Any thoughts on why Pearl White
&gt;is assigned as &quot;13&quot; on a Kombi and &quot;52&quot; on a westy. am i making ANY sense??

There seems to be some confusion regarding the paint/interior codes
on the VIN plate, so let me clear up what I can.

Ex.	121872
	^ ^ ^
	| | |_____Interior Code 	    72=Aero Papyrus White
	| |_______Above Beltline Paint Code 18=Cumulus White
	|_________Below Beltline Paint Code 12=Sea Blue

My question comes into play when the Westfalia enters the picture.
Westfalias were made from Kombis (model 231).  Both mine and
Michael Heron's Westys which are Pearl White/Pearl White/Mesh Grey
have the code 523907 instead of the code 131383 (which my two
Kombis DO have).  Another listmember Josh has a Velvet Green 67
Westy has the paint code 523642.  A Velvet Green Kombi would have
the code 383883 (as I think Michael Heron's Panel Van does).

I am wondering why the discrepency in the paint codes.  I am
pretty sure the Kombis were shipped to Westfalia painted, unlike
some commercial vehicles that could be shipped in primer, to be
painted later.

&gt;btw if i had salt and pepper seats, would the door panels be made out of
&gt;that gray hardboard material or covered in salt and pepper fabric? most
&gt;westy's i have seen have they gray hardboard panels but there is a pic of a
&gt;westy in a book by walter zeichner that shows a westy w/ salt and pepper
&gt;door panels???

Mesh Grey is more commonly known as Salt &amp; Pepper.  Kombis (which
were the base for the Westfalia) had hardboard interior panels.  The
Standard and Deluxe models were the only ones which had the vinyl
with cloth insert interior panels.
