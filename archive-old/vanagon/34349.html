Subject:       where did J.C.whitney get my address?

yesterday i recieved the new j.c.whitney catalog.  thats fine and all 
'cause i've been meening to subscribe but how did they know i even 
owned a v.w.?  as i see it, only some one who knows my address and 
knows i own a v.w. could have let them know.  my friends and family 
meet these criteria but none of em would have a reason to talk to 
whitney.  then there's the mechanic that fixed my ball joints but i 
can't see why he would give them the information.  the only 
reasonable idea i came up with is that maybe the secretary of state 
sells them a list of the names and addresses of people that buy v.w's 
each year since i just bought it in august and recieved the first 
catalog yesterday.  if so, it's a little disturbing how easily 
personal information becomes public.  and probably at a nice profit 
to the person gathering the info.  hmmmm, i suppose it could have 
also been the insurance company.  
    any ideas as to where whitney gets their mailing lists?  i'd 
really like to know cause anyone that actively researches what kind 
of vehicle i drive and where i live,  and then sells the information 
deserves a serious reaming.
thanks.
Ed.
