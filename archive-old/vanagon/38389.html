Subject: 1st junkyard trip + extra wiper motor

Hello there all,
	Well, I took my first junkyard trip yesterday.  I went looking
for a set of side rearview mirrors and parts for a wiper motor.  At
the first place there were two `69 buses, both pretty well stripped,
and no engine or tranny.  Both had a wiper motor, neither rear view
windows.  I took the nicer of the two motors (more like flipping a
coin:) and a hubcap to replace the one I'd lost camping.
	While there I practiced taking apart and putting back together
a door lock and the shiftrod assembly.  And played around a bit under
the dash of one.  Its nice to practice on something before pulling
your own bus apart.  I tried to leave everything as nice as possible,
since there were only two there, I figured others (or I) may need them
some day.

If the person who recently asked about the big white gear in the motor
is intrested, I could get the other one for you.  

take care all,
	  brandy
