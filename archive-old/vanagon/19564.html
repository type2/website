Subject: safety nag = fiberglass


_______________________________________________________________________________
I washed the camper thoroughly first.  Then, I thought I'd sand
the fiberglass surface, but doing so brought up all these ugly
pills (like on an old acrylic sweater), so I hand brushed/picked
those off, and decided to leave the top the way it was, so long
everything was solid.  I had many exposed rought fibers standing
out from the surface (rather a stucco or plaster effect in texture),
and just opted to leave them. 

    I sure hope you all use a filter mask while working with
    fiberglass of any kind!!! It's the kind of stuff you do not
    want to breath around..
