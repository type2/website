JWALKER ....

If I'm offending anyone by being on the list or contributing my comments 
please let me know (in the clear) and I'll kindly and graciously log off 
for the last time.

I'm no where near being even a backyard mechanic (I've admitted that 
before). I certainly appreciate the information and advice I've received 
and tp which I've been a party.

Within my limitations, I've tried to contribute where possible.  I fully 
respect ALL that those of you with the other vehicles have done and have 
gone through. In some instances, I perceive it's been a labor-or-love to a 
degree, otherwise, who'd continue in this madness? Only the helpless! And 
even the helpless can get a tip or two to make &quot;getting through the day&quot; a 
better or more with more humor!

I'm glad I have the combination of a newer vehicle AND time AND the many of 
you who are willing to share information about what this thing really is 
that I call a Eurovan. In this combination, I hope to know what to do when 
something goes &quot;bump in the night&quot; (or on a dark road) other than look for 
a rip off mechanic or dealer!

Silent, maybe .... smug improbable . #$_at_!#
