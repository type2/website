Patrick,

The water-cooled horizontally opposed four cylinder engine designed by
Volkswagen has a fatal design flaw as numerous posting to the Vanagon list
have pointed out.  The nature -- and cure -- for this problem was defined and
confirmed -- twice -- in the judgements passed down as a result of VW's
lawsuits against Subaru, who corrected the flaw.  But rather than correct the
flaw themselves -- and pay Subaru royalties, Volkswagen abandoned the design
and would like it very much if they never saw another water-cooled Vanagon,
again, evidenced by Volkswagen's own responses to members of the Vanagon list
who have encountered the cylinder leak problem.   Volkswagen's response in
this matter makes it clear they are only interested in the bottom line and
shows no loyalty to their customers.  I think it's fair to assume they will
continu to flit from idea to idea, always in search of the pot of corporate
gold, always trading transient short-term gains for long-term stability.

The sixty year old design of the upright air-cooled VW engine has had its
share of problems, mostly with cooling.  The problems have been resolved and
the modifications incorporated into air-cooled engines being manufactured
today.  Other modifications are supported by a host of after-market
suppliers, making it reasonable to assume the air-cooled engine will continue
to provide reliable service -- and be supported, although not by Volkswagen
-- well into the next century.  Indeed, this list is a part of that support. 

The present owner of the Vanagon list drives a water-cooled Volkswagen.  Even
if  given the best of care it is unreasonable to assume it will outlast the
hoards of air-cooled Transporters.  It is also unreasonable to assume Gerry
would expend the time and effort needed to maintain a list in which he had no
vested interest.

I think it's better to split the list now.  Water-cooled Vanagons will soon
vanish from American roads and the Vanagon list, if it survives, will become
the provence of those mechanically adept few who can keep their machines
running, either by installation of other powerplants or modifications to the
wasserboxer.  But in either case the gap between the surviving Vanagons and
the air-cooled Transporters can not help but grow.

Your message contained a certain emotional content that I've chosen to ignore
for the sake of harmony within the community.  Personally, I intend to
subscribe to both lists since I feel there is strength in numbers, and a
great deal that can be done to keep the water-cooled Vanagons on the road as
long as possible.

-Bob
