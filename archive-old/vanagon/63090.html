Subject:      Re: '81 thermo removal

Thanks to Joe Wagner, Joel Walker, Sean, and G M Bulley, who all pointed
out the reasons to keep the thermostat and related equipment in good shape.
 Once again, the list has saved me from making a potentially serious mistake.

I asked because I accidently left the thermostat, pully, and cable attached
when I sent in my core.  Now the rebuilder can't find them, and since they
are necessary I need to get replacements.

I have a new thermostat, but I need the U shaped bracket, attaching bolts
and nuts, cable, pulley, and any other parts needed to put this section
back together.  Since I cannot progress further with the engine until I get
these parts, I need them ASAP.

Anybody parting out an '81 that has all of these?  How about you dealers?
How much for new stuff?  My VW dealer quoted me about $60 including
shipping, and 10 days.

Thanks,
Bill                    (Bill_at_freeholder_dot_com)
