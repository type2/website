Subject: Gopher site / gas heater

Howdy 'gain.
 
I just checked out the gopher site. Coolness, Park. Of course, that is just
another danger to my already over-procrastinated life.
 
I got the addresses for info on gas heaters, but would still like opinions on
installation locations and safety tips.
 
Thanks again (including gopher site).
