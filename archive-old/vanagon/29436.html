Subject: Ok, ok, I'll get new brakes.

Geez, you guys are like a bunch of big brothers.  Actually, I called every
wrecking/junk yard in MD, VA, DC (at least the ones listed in the Maryland
yellow pages) and I found three calipers.  Yep, three.  All are at least 2-3
hours away from me.  The closest one is in Rockville, MD so I'm driving
there Friday. (I'm driving my Jetta, so don't worry).

Thanks for the advice, I knew I'd get the low-down.  To Bob (that's Bob
Hoover, the Bob who has mechanical skill) thanks for the info.  I think I'll
flush all that nasty half H20/break fluid crap out and get some silicone.

Have a good Turkey Day!

gobble, gobble

Bobble.
