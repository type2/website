Model Summary for 1988 Vanagon USA

Just three models of the Vanagon were built for model year 1988.  
These were: Vanagon GL, Vanagon GL Camper, and the Vanagon GL 
Wolfsburg Limited Edition.  Despite what some references may say, 
there were no 1988 model year Vanagon Syncros in the USA.  
Some 1987 leftover Syncros were available and sold during 1988.


Colors available: Pastel White, Flash Silver Metallic, Dove Blue Metallic,  
Titian Red Metallic, Wolfram Grey Metallic. Not all colors available
on all models.

Distinguishing features:
There are a several exterior features to distinguish an '88 from the
earlier vans.  The 1988 has carryover features from 1987 including:
2 Black plastic front grills (common to 1986-1991)
Rectangular primary headlights, separate square high beam lights
(common to 1986-1991)
Differences include:
Plastic vents at the rear of the rear side windows
Larger VW logo in center of upper front grill
Large VW logo in the center of the rear hatch in place of the previous
&quot;Volkswagen&quot; with VW logo on left side of rear hatch
Black aero styled bumpers.  There are no matching rocker panels.
All '88 Vanagons adopted the lowered ride height of the 1987-1/2
Wolfsburg Edition.
Some '88s had A/C controls mounted in the overhead A/C console
like the '87s and some had controls mounted in the dash near the radio.

The 1988-1/2 Wolfsburg Edition was the first Vanagon with the 
rocker panels to match the aero styled bumpers.
These bumpers and rocker panels are metallic grey.  This 
model also has body colored exterior mirrors. 

Prices shown below are MSRP figures from actual window stickers and
other reference sources.  Where a range of prices is shown, this depicts 
the range of MSRPs found. The price ranges are not an attempt to 
indicate a selling price range.  These varied prices are likely the result of

mid-year price changes from VW.
