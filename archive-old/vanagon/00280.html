&gt; 
&gt; I have frig. problems:
&gt; 
&gt; I've got an '85 Westphalia. I've used the refrigerator a lot over the 
&gt; years, and it was generally reliable. During the past year that has 
&gt; changed, and I can't seem to find any experts to fix it. Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; I've had RV places take the frig. out, clean it, blow out the little tube 
&gt; underneath, replace some of the parts, but no go. I get the same response 
&gt; whenever I take it anywhere, which is that it was badly designed in the 
&gt; beginning, they usually never work, so it's not surprising it doesn't 
&gt; work after severl good years.

That's strange.  There really isn't much to them.  You must make sure gas is
getting to the burner.  Is the burner clean.  The burner must have adequate
oxygen to burn.  Are the vent tubes clean?  The last thing is the igniter.  Is
is sparking correctly?  

I'd go through the procedures for starting problems to make sure I was doing it
correctly.  My book from Dometic recommend running the stove for a few minutes.
I assume it runs the gas through the lines.

Then I'd make sure everything in my first paragraph is true.  

Be careful!!!!!
