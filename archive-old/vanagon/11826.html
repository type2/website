Subject: I think I didn't blow a head gasket!

Joel had a good idea. Check the oil cooler since it looked like I was 
getting oil in my coolant system. I opened the overflow cap and orangish 
goopy stuff spilled out on the bumper and floor.

This got me to thinking. I had added 
ATF fluid last week because it was way low. Turns out it is way low again 
but doesn't appear to be dripping on the floor, soooooooo, I just pulled 
the ATF cooler off and guess what? The coolant lines were full of pink 
gooey fluid. The trans fluid on the dip stick has turned chalky whitish 
pink too. 

So my plans are,
1. Buy a new ATF cooler and install it (not real easy to get to).
2. Drain and replace the ATF fluid. Maybe a couple times in quick succession
3. Flush the coolant system.

Thanks Joel!
