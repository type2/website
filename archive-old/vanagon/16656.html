Subject: Re: Leak Free Battery (fwd)

The optima has really great CCA but 

--they won't have a deep-cycle version until a year from now (they told me
on the phone three weeks ago), and,
--the reserve capacity seems to be less than you would think for this rating
of battery (can't remember the details now)
--my buddies in the 4x4 world seem to really like this battery

&gt;This posted to the corrado mailist recently and might be of
&gt;even more interest here.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There is a leak-free (so they claim) car battery, the Optima.
&gt;&gt; Is uses a significantly different construction than
&gt;&gt; ordinary car batteries.  It is basically a &quot;six-pack&quot; of
&gt;&gt; spiral-wound cells.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Claims:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Can be charged at 20 Amps in 2.75 hours.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	No vibration-caused failures.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Lasts 3-4 times longer.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Can be operated in any position, even upside down.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Zero-maintenance, no corrosion.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Longer shelf life.  (&quot;months&quot;)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	2 year full replacement warranty, remainder of
&gt;&gt; 	72 months pro-rated.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	800 Cold cranking Amps
&gt;&gt; 	Reserve capacity: 120 minutes
&gt;&gt; 	9 15/16&quot; x 6 3/4&quot; x 7 13/16&quot;
&gt;&gt; 	39 pounds
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; For Corrados, you want the 800S model.  There is also a
&gt;&gt; 800U model with both top and side terminals, and a 850/6
&gt;&gt; 6 Volt model.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I bought one of these last week.  So far so good.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The spec is a bit taller than the stock &quot;group 41&quot;
&gt;&gt; battery, but it seems to fit okay.  I had to rearrange
&gt;&gt; the cables slightly so they would reach without being
&gt;&gt; strained.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I personaly have seen these as about 8 of them were used
&gt;in an electric car project around the university where they
&gt;were frequently quick charged with good results.  800cca is
&gt;pretty impressive as is the 2 yr full replacement warranty.
&gt;I had thought these were actually lead acid gel cells and
&gt;don't know what the spiral wound construction implies but
&gt;the cases do have six individual circular bumps.  Certainly
&gt;the ticket for stopping battery related rust problems forever.
&gt;I though the university paid about $100 each though.  And
&gt;how about that 6 volt model, perfect for the split that doesn't
&gt;get out much.  I'll try to find out more about these things.
