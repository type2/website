&gt; Well the second time around he wises up and doesn't try to pass me on 
&gt; the right.  I pull over, and give him the old &quot;why do you think you 
&gt; are bad when your car is an absolute pile of junk/pull your head out&quot; 
&gt; look.  He quickly looks away and speeds off.

What you need is a &quot;Honk if you want to see my finger&quot; bumper sticker...

Or the new one I just installed on the bus (seriously)

    NEVER 
 get behind a 
    VW BUS

I've had the same passing problem - people wanna pass on the _right_ so
bad they sometimes don't think: 

Case Study:

A couple of weeks ago, coming back from surfing, I'm clawing my way up Hwy 1
towards SF, just before Skyline Blvd.

It starts out with 2 lanes, then, unbelievaby, wides to 3 lanes.

When the next lane opens up on the right, I try desperately to get into,
doing about 40-45.  Nuh-un.  Mr Sport-Ute Nissan Pathfinder Badass slides 
in, followed in kind by several of his similarly mounted brethren. 

Whats so funny?

The freakin' LEFT lane was OPEN!

On the trip down there, on Hwy 80, going about 70 in the middle lane,
several people would zoom up from behind in the #1 lane, slide over 2 lanes, 
pass me, and then zoom back to the #1 lane.

C'mon - be a MAN - pass on the LEFT!
