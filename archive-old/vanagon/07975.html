Subject: Carb problems with a 70 bus! 


Just figured out that my carb (34 pict 3) is bad.  Debating rebuild (at a 
shop) vs. new.  Any suggestions?  I live in Maryland, and would like to know 
where I can get a new or used carb, and how much it would be.

Next confusing problem:

I have a 30 pict 3 and the adaptor to mesh it with the intake for a 1600cc 
dual port.  Here's the problem:  When I put the adaptor on the right way it 
hits the throttle arm and you can only push the pedal down half way.  When i 
try it on the other way, it hits the arm that goes back to the accelerator 
pump.  What's the problem?

Please e-mail me directly, as I can't read this newsgroup too much at work 
without getting caught!

Thanks

Bill
