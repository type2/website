Subject: RE: redrock video viewing!

Why not bring the tape on down to the meet and view it in one of our campers!!  
Might be a good place to find other like-minded bus folks...  Depending on 
conditions, I may be able to use my Westie if someone can bring down a big 
enough tv screen (and generator to run it)....  I only have a 4&quot; sony watchman 
in the Westie, but do (the last time I checked on our old VCR) have a VCR that 
will run off of my Westie battery.....  If I'm trailering my split-window to 
the meet, however, I may not have enough space for said equipment...  Thouhgts??

parts...

Jon has a good point. I'd like to attend the the meet. It's at Kelly Park 
and it's a lot of fun. Not many Vanagons, though! :)
