&gt; Now, I only saw one broken down Volks, a 68-71 bus, and it looked like the
&gt; guy had things under control, so I didn't stop.  BUT!  Number of broken
&gt; down Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth minipukes, you ask?  THREE!  I leave it to you
&gt; (or Ric) to form conclusions.
&gt; 
&gt; Discuss.
&gt; 

I think Ric will concur that it's not so much the relative reliabilities of the 
2 brands of vans, but rather the nature of their respective owners. The Mopar 
families have to stop on the freeway more often because:

1. Their kids are rarely potty trained and need to be hosed down on the side of 
the road to reduce the stench insid the van.
2. The parents pull over to eat their young.

The VW owner probably stopped because he forgot how damn good looking his van 
was while he was driving it and had to pull over to check it out.

-Erik.
