Subject: Attention Diesel Owners with Ohm-meter

Would a diesel owner please use an ohm-meter to check the resistance of their 
Temperature sender -- this is the sensor in the engine compartment that
drives the dash temperature gauge.

This is the one piece of information I don't have and need.

Thanks!
