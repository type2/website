&gt;What's a Zamboni?

A Zamboni is the machine that refinishes the ice at a skating rink between
sessions (or period of a hockey game).  Top speed ~5kph, looks a lot like
bulldozer with a skirt.  Don't ask me how they work.


&gt;In relation to aerodynamics, I heard a story recently about a bloke from 
&gt;Sydney taking his turbocharged bay window bus to Australia's Northern 
&gt;Territory (home of Ayer's Rock, Kakadu National Park, etc), where there 
&gt;are no speed limits, to try and see how fast his bus would go. I can't 
&gt;remember if he got it up to 198kmh or 198mph. Whatever it was, it 
&gt;would be bloody fast in a bus. Of course, the speedo needle was stuck 
&gt;against the stop and he calculated his speed from the tacho. He was 
&gt;annoyed (extremely pissed off actually) that he couldn't get over 200 
&gt;(kmh or mph).


Turbo charged or not, 120mph (200kph) would seem the unreasonable max I
would expect any VW van body to be able to do without caving in the nose.
Had to be kph.

(FLAME BAIT ALERT)  Too bad he didn't get to 200 mph.  Think of it as
chlorinating the gene pool.  

                        Still,
                        Steve
