Subject: coolant system flush ideas?

Hello-
	I want to flush my coolant system as the PO used regular antifreeze
which I believe has been in there for quite a long time (well, as long as
the engine has been in there as it was replaced). I want to use a propylene
glycol based antifreeze instead of the ethylene glycol based stuff (or did
I just reverse that - I have already gotten 4 gallons of the stuff to use. The
container says that the two should not mix (which I will do when I get home,
I would like to see if it produces some nasty gums or the like), and to 
flush the cooling system throughly before putting the new stuff in. So I
need to figure out two things- how do I get all the coolant out of the 
system (like the raditor hoses that run to the front of the car), and then,
how do I get clean water to cycle through the system?
	The latter question I feel is a bit more difficult because I need to
get the raditor cleaned out which means getting water to run up there. My
only thoughts would be to remove the thermostat and let the car run a little
bit to force water through the whole system. Any one have any other ideas?
