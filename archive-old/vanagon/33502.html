Subject: RE: SCUM that steal VW bits

We have this problem in England too. Ever since the Beastie Boys, V dub fro=
nt
badges have been continually ripped off...now us Splitty owners wiv dem nic=
e
chrome repro front badges (and a friendly bank manager to enable purchase o=
f
said goodie) are in constant fear of going out to the bus and  AAAGH Bastar=
ds!
(sorry but it does help..not a lot...). Also SSVC people have had headlight=
s
ripped out and Devon badges prised off..even the tailscript badges attract
scumbags. What happened to the Splitty Nation guys (and girls)? 
PS a recent mag carried something about securing front badges, I'll look it
out and reword/summarise if'n you want...Personally I prefer the option of
wiring the parked van's badge to the house mains.....but unfortunately I DO
believe in The Nation..well sometimes. Dave
