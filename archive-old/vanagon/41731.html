I thought pretty much all passenger vehicles have the cat. under the
passenger compartment.  I know all my parents' cars do and we don't have
to run the a/c constantly.

I think I know the person you're referring to -- saw the page and he
seems to be mostly full of crap.

&gt;      Hello Eurovan Drivers:
&gt;      
&gt;      I have been considering trading my 1986 Vanagon GL for a 1993 Eurovan 
&gt;      and while doing some research via the Internet, came across an unhappy 
&gt;      Eurovan owner. Among other things, this individual states that as a 
&gt;      result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger 
&gt;      compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle, which requires 
&gt;      running the air conditioner constantly.
&gt;      
&gt;      Has this been your experience?
&gt;      
&gt;      Thanks for your help,
&gt;      
&gt;      Dave Maguiness
