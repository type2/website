Hi there.  I have several questions again about the engine transplant 
in my '71 bus.

Despite all warnings against it in Muir and went and popped one of the
brush springs off of the generator.  Several well intended attempts to
refix it failed.  Any ideas?  Maybe a bike spoke bent into a hook?  I 
don't know, I had too many other problems so went on.

Can the piece of tin behind the crank pulley be removed without 
removing the pully?  I don't have a puller and was going to use a new 
crank on my new motor.  I guess I will have to borrow one if that is 
the only way.

The only vacuum port I have now with my Weber carb and intake is on 
the left end casting.  Is this were I need to hook up my brake 
booster?  Where do I get something to step down to that size from the 
big hose that runs up front there?

Finally, I am trying to rehab this borrowed floor jack and am having 
no luck there either.  It is one of the chinese made 2.25 ton types.  
There are two screws on the top, one bigger than the other.  When I 
screw this out fluid goes all over the floor and the performance of 
the jack gets worse.  It I tip it up on end I can pour a little fluid 
in but not enough to improve things.  You must have to pull up on the 
thing to suck in the fluid or something.  The guy at the FLAPS was his
usual helpful self.

I did find a VW parts place in town today.  This is a skateboard/VW 
parts place.  The guy is a longtime enthusiast.  He had a very nice 
looking black bug out front that he had restored.  Also, this morning 
I spotted an oval bug.  I have only seen two of these in this town so 
it was pretty exciting.  Looked to be restored to original with new 
window rubber and all.  Only thing left seemed to be interior panels 
in the back seat.  All carpet and seats look new.  Anyway, please help
with the above questions if you can.  All these books and couldn't 
find the answers.  Thanks, Jim
