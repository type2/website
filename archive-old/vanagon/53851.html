Subject: SE Pennsylvania Mechs...


&gt;From time to time, I hear people asking if anybody knows
a good Veedub mechanic. So, since I know one, I figgered it
might be a good idea to volunteer the information...

I live in the Lansdale, PA area (not too far from Philly..), and
since I have moved here, I have been using a place called Autohaus,
run by Dave Fretz.

Autohaus
1742 Schwenksville Rd
Schwenksville, PA 19473
(610)287-9608

Dave owns a Syncro, a diesel Rabbit pickup, and a Jetta. The Syncro is
their daily driver, so he knows Vanagons.  He also has a &quot;good 
condition&quot; '71 loaf that I wold love to convince him to sell me...
(as well as a bunch of other VWs, including an air-cooled westy)
(but I can't decide how to handle _five_ cars in my driveway...)

Anyway, Dave is good, honest, and VWs are his passion.  Call him 
first to get directions.

It might be useful for us to archive the data on good VW mechs. They 
are not easy to find.
