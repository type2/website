Subject: Re: Westy Height


My '81 'falia would'nt fit in my track home w/ standard wooden
garage (just missed).  Had to install one of those roll up/
partitioned garage doors to provide the extra inches.  Beyond
that, don't know if that would have worked if my driveway wasn't
flat.  Also, w/o knowing the height (my manual gives the height)
try to drive it in the garage, if the top hits then no, it won't
fit.

'81 'falia

&gt; I've checked the usual sources, but couldn't find what the height of a
&gt; Vanagon Westfalia is.  Does anyone know?  (I'm wondering if one would fit
&gt; in my garage.)  Thanx!
