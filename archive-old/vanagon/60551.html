Subject: Leak down test

Hey guys,

Just did a leak down test on cylinder # 3, the exhaust valve leaks a
little.  That's a minor problem...here's the dumb part.

I really feel like an idiot but, I made the mistake of trying to move
the engine a little bit to make sure I was TDC while the air was in
Cylinder #3. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!!.. Of course the engine moved with
great force and my wrench went right into the big coolant pipe right
where the hose from the tank is.  Now I got a small leak in the coolant
system. 

The pipe has very little rust and it's leaking at the weld.  What type
of metal is this pipe? Can I just take it off and solder it like I would
my house plumbing or do I need to get it brazed at the radiator shop.

Mean while it's parked in the garage with electrical tape wrapped around
it so I don't loose all my coolant overnight.


TIA
