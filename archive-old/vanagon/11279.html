&gt;Yea but who cares- 1.5 amps is just a trickle compared to 5.5 amps thats 
&gt;required for the fridge.   You'd have to put 4 of them in parralell just to 
&gt;get the amperage.  So that drains around 12 amps at 6 volts.  This is 
&gt;unrealistic as well, there are no 100% efficient machines out there.

But my intention was to be able to recharge the deep cycle battery,
in which case 1.5 amps prolly would be a good idea.

I'd already given up on the idea of running the fridge off the generator
'cause I didn't want to convert.  I wanted a way to recharge the aux
battery &quot;in the field.&quot;
