Subject: RE: -48 F this a.m. (and loving it)


&gt;It is an incredible morning.  Perfectly still, no breeze to upset the
&gt;woodsmoke rising out of the chimney until it reaches that defined
&gt;plateau where it levels off as straight as a carpenters level.  If
&gt;you have never heard the snow crunch at -48 F, you need to.  Each
&gt;step is alive.
&gt;
&gt;When weather becomes hot, peoples' tempers rise in proportion.  When
&gt;it turns cold like this, humanity extends its warm embrace.  Stranded
&gt;motorists are helped immediately, icicle smiles and runny noses greet
&gt;one another saying &quot;I'm surviving-- and you?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;All this brings us to the obligatory VW content:  How does a vanagon
&gt;run in the cold?  The answer is lousy.  Starting the engine is a form
&gt;of mechanical cruelty that should be penalized with revocation of its
&gt;title.  Unfortunately, it becomes a necessity for a daily driver.
&gt;The 'hot plate' engine heater is barely adequate but if the wind is
&gt;calm will suffice.  Power steering pumps and  heater fans scream
&gt;their protests.  Gearboxes, linkages, and switches threaten to break.
&gt; It all brings one to the question of necessity--  &quot;Do I really NEED
&gt;to get in town?&quot;  the answer is always the same but the words change.


Boy, do I hear yuh.. it got all the way down to +53F here in Sandy Eggo
last night... before rising back up to 75 today. Makes me recall the five
years I spent in Minneapolis, including the time I bought a cheap
thermometer in a drugstore in Anoka, went out into the -35F temperature
to see what it would do, and it shattered in my hand.

Gee, I miss those Minnesota winters...

&lt;NOT&gt;   :^)

VW Content: Bought my first car there. A '70 Squareback. Drove it for
two years, my ears ringing, till the driver's seat started dragging on the
ground due to rust.

(now, if this isn't flame bait, what is?)
