The last couple of weeks I've been &quot;stealing&quot; my wife's EV and using it
to commute instead of the '87 Weekender. (60 miles each way).

I've noticed a couple of things.

1) (surprise, surprise...) the EV has a lot more power around 70mph

2) the EV gets marginally better mileage (~23 mpg)

3) I love the dual A/C.  A lot better cooling than the Vanagon's
   (also, the EV still has VERY &quot;adequate&quot; power even with both A/Cs on full
   blast.)

4) Aerodynamics.  There a few downhills on I-78 that I shift to 
   neutral at, and, interestingly, the EV accelerates down those hills,
   as opposed to the Vanagon decelerating down the same hills.  The Brakes
   were completely overhauled on the Vanagon 20K ago, and I'm sure they are
   not dragging (I can easily push the Vanagon on level ground).  The other
   difference is the tires (I've got the tire pressure checked regularly, so
   that's not it), the Vanagon has the 205/14 Pirellis, whereas the EV has
   the standard Contis.  Wind conditions on diffeerent days: maybe, but I do not
   think s0.  I've driven the EV to work enough number of times now that
   I think if it were the wind, I'd only notice the accelerating in favorable
   winds.  It happens every time, and is very noticeable.

5) I hate the parking of the EV.  It handles better on I-78, but when I'm parking
   it, It feels like I'm wrestling with a water buffalo.  I think it's because
   of the fact that I'm spoiled by the Vanagon.  The EV still turns and parks better
   than my friend's Ford Taurus.  Another thing:  I will probably end up ruining the
   parking lot's cement tire stops -- those German engineers put the front
   wheels in the wrong place on the EV :-)
