Subject: Re: Alcohol fuels

Hey, now this is interesting!  Thanks for the stuff on
the alcohol.  I didn't realize that CO came from lack
of oxygen, just thought it was a natural function of
the combustion.  

I've heard of Jotul.  Did you actually see his stove?
Where thru the roof was it vented?  How large was it?
Did you feel the heat it put out?  West Marine catalog
lists a sold wood fuel stove, but it has to be mounted on
a vertical surface, and there's none free in my car  :(
