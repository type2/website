Subject: GNATT Road Condition
Date: Mon, 12 Jun 95 14:54:00 PDT

 I just checked the web page at the California Office of Emergency Service for
 road conditions and State Route 120 to the Yosemite High Country still shows
 as closed from 5 miles west of Hwy. 395 to Crane Flat. 

 However, Hwy. 108 &lt;Sonora Pass&gt; has been re-opened and Hwy 4 &lt;Ebbett's pass?&gt;
 is also shown to be open &lt;though the web page at UC Davis shows it as still
 closed, go figure&gt;. Yosemite Valley could be reached by crossing Sonora Pass
 and backtracking up Hwy 120 from the west side, but accomodations in the 
 Valley are very problematic without advance reservations in my experience.
 Would there be any interest in a Gold Country GNATT stop at Columbia 
 &lt;picturesque&gt;, Jamestown &lt;cool steam railroad used in Petticoat Junction,
 the Wild, Wild West and Back to the Future III&gt; or Sonora? A Highway 4
 crossing could involve a stop at Lake Alpine or Calaveras Big Trees State
 Park, but that is more driving from the Mono Lake stop.

 I don't know that I can attend any of these possibilities on account of 
 having to pick up my nephew at the airport on Saturday, but a day trip on
 Sunday isn't out of the question.....
