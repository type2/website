Subject: one more question...

    Dear buslist,
 after putting together the report on the engine swap \ 73 bus (see recent
post) i'm left with just one more question. it's about the air intake
thermostat thingie to the right (R is R) of the air filter. the vacuum
hoses from that area are the only ones i neglected to label before i dropped
the engine. anyone know how they go back on ? i've tried to deduce where
they go by trying to understand their function...no dice.
  so here it goes: in my 1800\type4 carbureted engine there is a vacuum
operated flap in the air filter air intake to the right (R is R) of the
paper element air filter. one hose comes out of it, and it must go to what i
think is a thermostatically operated vacuum valve (correct me if i'm wrong,
i couldn't find it in my books...)which is located in the air intake elbow
of the right carb. this thing now has 2 connectors for vac hoses, one is
plastic black, one is brass. which one of these goes to the abovementioned
warm\cold air flap? and i assume the other connector is for a vac hose
from the intake manifold, 'cause that's the only one still dangling around
these parts...are you confused yet ???
  so here's my questions:
1. which hose goes where ?
2. can anyone explain how this works ? i had a brain meltdown trying to
   understand the logic behind it...
love,
        G.
