&gt; &gt;2.  Automatic trans. fluid leak- Coming home from a trip to LA I

&gt; &gt;quart low.  I added some ATF and the problem went away.  When I got
&gt; &gt;home I took it to the dealer &amp; he identified a slow leak in the auto
&gt; &gt;trans pan gasket, but nothing else.  It has been about two months and
&gt; &gt;I just experienced a repeat performance - ATF everywhere &amp; lots of

&gt; 
&gt; ATF everywhere and lots of smoke!?  Sounds like that incident in Waco, TX.
