Subject: Re: power steering bleed/refill

&gt;        I have studied Bently concerning bleeding the power brake system,
&gt;but I'm not quite sure of the best outlet from which to collect old fluid. I
&gt;presume to try blocking the return inlet of the fluid reservoir and then
&gt;collecting the old fluid from the return line as it is pumped out by the
&gt;engine. Does this sound reasonable? I welcome anyone's thoughts and

Ok, since I've sent this out privately twice, it's time for a list note. 
Sorry other folks.

Flushing vanagon PS system  (IMHO)

Buy a quart of STP Dexron-III from Kmart, $2.50 here.
Feeling rich? Buy a quart of VWoA Hydraulic fluid,  $35.00 here
Feeling rich? Buy the VWoA cork filter ring, $35.00 also

1)  Loosen the band clamp on the return hose where it attaches to the steel 
piping that leads forward and pull off hose, fixing it up somehow above the 
PS reservoir top. Loosely held in Vice-Grips is fine, resting on engine lid 
deck.

2)  Connect old vinyl tubing to the steel pipe and lead down into a waste 
container, 2qt size.

3)  Pull the main coil lead off the distributer.

4)  With the car in neutral crank the starter for 3-4 spins then run back 
and check fluid level in reservoir.  Repeat until it's at the bottom BUT 
DON'T SUCK AIR!! A helper would make life easier here.

5)  Unscrew the big cap, remove plastic plate and spring and old filter. 
Wipe clean and set aside filter to drain on a paper towel if being reused.

6)  Top up with ATF.

7)  Repeat  #4 until fresh fluid comes out the return hose into the waste 
container.  STP is purple, showed up well against rust brown that was in there.

8)  Repeat #4 while turning wheels lock to lock to flush the rack.  This 
should just about finish off the qt. of STP.

9)  Replace filter, lid/spring, big cap and top up to correct level, then 
keep cranking to keep up the flush until all the STP is used up.

10)  Reconnect the return hose quickly so as not to loose fluid, any air in 
the system will be returned directly to the reservoir.  Tighten the clamp.

11)  Connect the coil wire and start it up, looking for purple coloured 
leaks. Then road test and recheck.

12) If you opted for the $$ VWoA fluid, treat the STP as the flush, and 
repeat all of the above after a week? two weeks? That's when I'd change the 
filter also.  If not, then you are done.



I've had the STP in for a month, waiting for some good weather to put in the 
VW fluid which is supposed to re-swell/lube seals etc etc (snake-oil?).  STP 
works fine, _maybe_ a tad easier action in initiating a turn now, slightly 
lighter feeling at the wheel (_maybe_)  The job was dead easy, 20 minutes 
total.  The old fluid was the most disgusting muck I've ever seen 
masquerading as hydraulic fluid, dark brown, very thin/watery. Since the 
Dexron-II is rec'd in my manual, and Dexron-III is backwards compatible (and 
fully synthetic I believe) and costs one fourteenth the price of the VW 
fluid it's likely fine as a replacement, at $2.50 it's also cheap enough for 
a rinse too :)  I haven't seen any sign of leaks, we get fresh snow every 
second day and no little purple spots have made it to the ground (yet?)

Hope this helps,   Tim Smith
