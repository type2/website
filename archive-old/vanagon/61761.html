Subject: Re: Cool Yellow Lights

France switched over to white head lights in the late eighties,
probably to comply with Euro norms. Only old cars still have the
yellow lights. Note that my 1970 Opel (a german product) had clear
lenses though; it was the lightbulbs that were yellow. *Perhaps* one
can still pick up a pair of yellow bulbs at Norauto or at some other
French version of AutoZone, but I doubt it.
