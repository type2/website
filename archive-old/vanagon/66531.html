Subject:      Replacing water pump - pointers?

Thanks to all who responded to my request for advice on thinking through
the coolant leak on my '87. (Generous help from Kyle Wade, Don Gibbons
Justin, Dan Houg, and others.)

I had a leak-down test done and the problem is the water pump.

Would someone please tell me about the joys of removing and replacing my
water pump?

        Locating a replacement pump?
        How hard is it get in there?
        What am I likely to break when I try to get it out?
        Any special hints on refilling/bleeding cooling system? (I've
never done it before.)

I have a Bentleys but I'm a reluctant mechanic.


Thanks and aloha,

Gordon Smith
