Subject: Engine transplant

Last month I was transplanting a '78 f.i. engine into the chassis
of my '73 westy.  It's been up and running for a week now.

The throttle cable used to go through the firewall on the driver's
side.  With the '78 engine it goes through about in the center.
The linkage under the gas pedal stuck this morning. I'll have to
straighten this mess out once the rain stops.

The EGR filter is rusted/blown out causing some leaks in the
manifolds.  Dealer wants $188 for the replacement filter part.

There were some metal tubes on the '78 that ran under the wheel
wells in the rear. These were cut to allow the swing arms their
full range of motion.

With the '78 2litre motor it feels like maybe 20% more power.
The carbs, intake manifolds, distributor, heads and alternator
were salvaged off the old 1.7 litre motor. I sold the rest to
an off-road enthusiast who wanted the TypeIV case for a 3.0 litre
buggy engine. The heads went to a remanufacturer for the core $.

I'm just getting back on-line with this newsgroup again and
I hope I subscribed correctly.  I'll probably miss the camp-out
at Pfeiffer this weekend 'cause I need the EGR filter and other
work to get the 2litre engine running right.

Cheers,

p.s. The EGR and OXY lights on the dash of the '78 bus were NOT
wired to the engine.  It seems that these lights are connected
to the odometer cable so they light up at specific mileage
intervals.
