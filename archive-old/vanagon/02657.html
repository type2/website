Subject: Looking for body shop...

Greetings fellow bus drivers,

I am the proud owner of a 1977 Westfalia that is in need of serious metal
work. I am an East Coaster, so rust and rot have come to know my Camper very
well. I am in Middlesex county and am looking for a local or semi-local body
shop that is familliar with working with VDubs. Any info or addresses/phone
#'s are greatly appriciated....
