Subject: Heater motor gone?

Aunt Augusta, our 1987 Syncros, is making a horrible screeching
noise when the heat is turned on.  

I don't know all the details, but the husband wanted to know 
a) is it possible it is NOT the heater motor itself and b) do you 
REALLY have to remove the dashboard to get at the heater motor?

He's got a large, green manual for her so he's done the research,
but wanted to consult with the pros.  :-)  

Thanks for any info,
Kim
