Subject: ANNOUNCE: Searchable type2 Archive Now On Line


There is now a searchable archive of all messages posted to the type2 list.
I'm very impressed with it, it's capable of highly sophisticated searches
and it's pretty fast. Do read the help page if you're going to use it, it
explains how to force literals and AND and OR and so forth.

This archive is maintained by LSoft, so it only contains messages posted
since we started using this server. The Primenet messages aren't lost,
they've been threaded, the chaff blown out, and they'll be archived on the
type2_dot_com web page hopefully later this week.

The archive is here:
