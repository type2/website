I just recently took a crack at this approach. In California, with
StateFarm, my savings was a paltry $120/year for my 86 Westy. I say
paltry, cause of the restriction. The Westy hasn't really been
reclassified as a &quot;mobile home&quot;, but as vehicle that WILL NOT be driven
more than 7500 miles/year. They do check your odometer every 12 months.
I'll have a better feel for whether it was raelly worth it in about 10
months.

I'm interested in knowing about any other insurance carriers that will
actually give you a reclassification and a better deal.
