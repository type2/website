&gt; O.K. what do people who actually use their fridge do to keep the door 
&gt; closed? My door no longer stays shut since the cheap metal piece bends 
&gt; with the slightest pressure.  Tell me there is a better alternative to 
&gt; attaching a padlock latch (like on a tool box) and a pencil to wedge in 
&gt; the spot where the padlock would normally go!

I had to switch to a bungee cord.  My fridge had a magnetic clamp on the
inside, but I can't use it because it was so strong it started to crack
the plastic that it was mounted on.  My fridge is basically falling to
pieces.  :(
