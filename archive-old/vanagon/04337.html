	In the Pacific NW we are blessed with Les Schwab Tire Stores. And, I
	mean that positively. I'm very impressed with there business policies
	particularly when compared to dealers and other shops.

	I take all brake-tire-shock work to them.

	Honestly, a couple weeks prior to putting my '91 on the market, I took
	it to Schwab's for brakes and align.. I figured with 45K miles, it'd
	need brakes soon.

	At work they called me and asked why I wanted brakes. I said 'well, uh,
	well, at 45k......'

	They said it was only 50% worn and keep my money. No charge.

	Most businesses woulda just done the work for the business.
