Subject: Oil sealing rings on valve shaft???

I am rebuilding a 1700cc engine and I looked in the Haynes manual to 
see how to put the valves back in.  Haynes says there should be a oil 
sealing ring(looks like a washer in the picture) that goes onto the 
shaft of the valve.  When I dissasembled my heads there were no oil 
sealing rings.  Do I need them?  If so where can I get them?  Is oil 
leaking down horizontal valve guides a problem? Thanks
