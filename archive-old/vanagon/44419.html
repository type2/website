	&gt;Well, I picked up my wheels last fri. from the the mechanic for my
	&gt;new rebuilt transmission. All ran great, felt fine. and is. This morning
	&gt;on my way into work the starship began sputtering, while I'm pumping
	&gt;the accelerator and no gas getting to the engine. It stalls so I coast to
	&gt;the side. It starts so I go about half a mile and same thing. Must be
	&gt;the fuel pump is my guess. So it's at the place it spends more time
	&gt;at than in my driveway - the mechanic. This could really jeapordize
	&gt;the CCC trip :( So far in the last year I've had to replace the Trans, 
	&gt;clutch, master cylinder, and now probably the fuel pump? Not much
	&gt;else to do but a rebuild
	&gt; 
	Jeez--complain, complain, complain.
	
	
	In the last two years I have put new brakes, new tires, a new A/C compressor
	with one new hose, a new distributor, a new radiator, a new fuel pump, a new
	ignition coil and a new (remanufactured) engine--almost forgot about my new
	shocks. I'm probably leaving out something even with that long list. I
	must admit--it does run great now, and I haven't soured on my decision. I
	still love my van.
	
	
	I only paid $2,200 for my '85 Vanagon and it does have 151,000 miles on it
	now. Nothing from the above list has surprised or shocked me. I figure
	eventually I will have caught up to its several previous owners lack of care
	for it and I'll get around to having the dents banged out of it and have it
	painted. It still costs me less to own than my long lost '92 Passat
	Variant. :-)
	
	
	Happy motoring!

I can sure sympathize! I have a Westy with 190K I purchased over the 
internet for under 4K, but have since replaced the engine, tires, 
bumper, sliding door, A/C compressor, and unfortunately both heads 
AFTER that, new brakes, lots-0-hoses, .... I have close to 3x my 
initial purchase now invested in this love/hate relationship. I've been 
thrown off the saddle (read stranded) by my 86 van outside Durango, Co, 
in Oklahoma (30 miles from nearest &quot;town&quot;), and also near West, Tx 
(yes, there is a town called West). All of this has occured in less 
than 2 years. 

But am I ready to dump her? No way. 

Regards, Vance

P.S. Hopefully you all won't have my problems ahead of you, nor I 
yours!;)
