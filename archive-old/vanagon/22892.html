Ok, I'd like to get kind of a last minute roll call so I can
have some idea how many people to expect, buy beer/sodas/mushrooms :)
for.

I  guess what I'm asking for is an RSVP

AND - I only got 1 response on what time you wanted it.  Its kinda
fuzzy betwen 11:00 and Noon.  Are we gonna solidify this?
