We don't have the polo here (USA)!  It is smaller than the Golf...if I
remember right, its boardering on the &quot;mini&quot; catagory.

&gt;&gt;| I was offered a Polo heater by a breakers yard for 20 UK pounds, too small
&gt;&gt;| a saving to forego the new part. BTW is the Polo as popular in the USA as
&gt;&gt;| it is here?
&gt;
&gt;	Can you describe the Polo? I know a few cars have different names
&gt;between here and the UK...
