Subject: Bad Bad Bad Vibrations

I'm wondering if I should have bought a new drive shaft??? Since having
a terrible shudder as I came to a stop last fall....I took out my
driveshaft and found a u-joint frozen in one direction .  After much
checking around I thought I'd risk it and simply replace the u-
joints.Here's what I've done
Replaced the U joints. Local machine shop ( there are no driveline shops
in this part of Montana) did the work and to my surprise had already
done a few. They Put in Heirsherschmidt or something like that, but they
did the clips wrong and and so after driving not too long I'd say 50
miles or so the vibration thing started happening again.HmmmmIt got
slowly worse , but seeing as the wife was driving it only 10 miles a day
I let it slide.  Then we took it on a trip about 130miles to Billings,
Montana Yikes what a nasty vibration from 40 65mph!  So I had the dealer
in Billings, Dana Motors take the shaft out( only $20) These guys are
great for  a Dealer..As we drove back I swear I could still detect a
vibration, not as bad by any means but still a vibration. 
 When I got back I took the driveshaft to The local machine shop,  Thats
when they discovered the bad instalation of clips and a need for
rebalancing(new clips). No charge...heh!
So before I install the refixed shaft I wuold like to track down the
other vibration..OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS.............
The other vibration , the one without the shaft installed, is most
noticible upon deceleration.  I wonder I if may have damaged
transmission bearings????Is this possible and how would one test for
it??
This vibration is rather subtle but it's there.. Any other syncro owners
had bad vibrations????Wife says just put the damn shaft back in and run
it till it breaks.....No pun intended.  Do wheel bearings ever cause
sublte yet annoying vibrations, how could I test them..?
One thing the local Machine shop talked about in regards to the  shaft
causing vibrations is the shaft that fits in the shaft.  I've not seen
any mention of this on any posts... On the end of the shaft that has the
hard rubber bushing is a shaft that goes inside the main shaft it has
two Bearings or Guides? that occasionally dry out or become damaged
otherwise this can also be a source of bad vibrations.  I have'nt torn
it down that far....yet. Anybody had experience with this part of the
shaft??
Any and all info is appreciated.  thanks!!
