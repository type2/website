Subject: Questions--Re: WTB 86+ Westie Full Camper (long)

 Hi Volks-fans,

I've received a number of responses to my original post wrt my
&quot;dream-Westie,&quot; disclosing freely my &quot;wanabus&quot; status, for which I thank
you.  Being on this list for less than a week has been informative, to say
the least.  At the same time, it has raised quite a few questions, such as:

        1.  What are alloy wheels, and why do people go to such lengths to
get them?

        2. What is an ECU?  I gather it has to do with fuel injection.  Are
they fragile?

And the serious one:

        3.  One of the attractions for me of a VW bus is the reputation for
durability and economy.  Has that been lost by the Vanagon generation?  The
reason i've set my sights on an '85 or newer is that I need power steering
as well as AT due to physical disability, which is also the reason for my
strictly limited budget.

        a. am I on a fool's errand, hoping to find for $8-9k a full camper
as late as '86 or so, in decent condition?  I looked at an '89 the other
day, advertised with a new reblt engine with a 3yr-36k warranty, at $12,995,
thinking the warranty would be valuable, but it was a *dog*!  Stank of smoke
and mildew and looked severely abused, like someone had let loose a circular
saw in there, and it just kept going, bouncing around off the cabinets,
etc., hacking and gouging wherever it landed.

        b. More seriously, reading of the quests some of you have had to
undertake to get certain parts, and the frequency with which, it appears,
engines need to be rebuilt before going even 100k -- is it a given, with a
Vanagon, that maintenance expenses will be frequent and high?

My sense is that, by definition, this list is made up of devotees, many of
whom may be perfectionists.  I do not intend to offend anyone by these
questions, but does the average Vanagon driver, or more particularly someone
with more time than money [but *no* mechanical experience to speak of,
except from the wrong side of the cash register :-(  ], have to be on
constant alert for failing heads and ECU's and CV's, etc.?

I'm *not* looking for a project car, tho i'm eager and willing to understand
more about how my vehicle functions.  I want a compact, reliable, easily
handled, economical camper that will be my only vehicle; one I can use to
meander along the coast looking for tidepools and visiting friends, sleeping
overnite some of the time, and also serving as a &quot;sag wagon&quot; [as in
marathons and bike races] when I need a place to rest and regenerate during
the day.  I've had 2 previous VW buses [not cmpers], and think a Westfalia
full camper would be perfect [even more so, if it were 2' longer and had a
toilet  :-) ].  I thought my search would be simple, with all the older
Westies that are around, but discovered immediately on pulling out from the
curb in a '73 hippiemobile, complete with decals, that I could not handle
the steering.

For those who've read all the way thru this, thank you.  I suspect I have
more in common with the California Camping Crazies, than with those
discussing virtues of digifast vs digijet fuel injection.   I'll appreciate
any thoughts any of you care to offer.
