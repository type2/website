Great story!

Which compels me to reinforce how durable the inline 4 is:
Four years ago we bought a house which needed a lot of work. I 
really needed a pickup, but all I had was my 85 Jetta, a hitch, and a 
*very* strong homemade trailer. I proceeded to carry a total of 10 
yards of bark mulch with it, 2 yards at a time. This was no problem, 
even for the non-turbo original motor. Then I decided the weed patch 
beside the drive really needed some gravel so I could park there. The 
local gravel pit in Maple Ridge let you shovel it yourself for $10 a 
load. Well I needed the exercise, and being cheap, I piled as much as 
I thought safe, then just a *bit* more, on the trailer. Without the 
side boards, I figured this to be just over a yard of gravel. Luckily 
this was a Saturday, so I didn't get too many strange looks from 
truckers. Luckily I thought, the exit from the pit is *downhill*. 
Well, I slid merrily down the hill towards the weigh scale to pay for 
my load. Geez I thought, good thing I don't have to go too far as I 
asked how much I weighed. The operator casually said &quot;oh, just over 
5600 lbs...&quot; I gulped. &quot;Are you sure??&quot; He says &quot;Yeh, give or take a 
100 or so.&quot; 

So I gave him $10 and spent a minute or two estimating how much time
would need to gain speed, while I waited for a break in traffic to
pull onto the highway. Once moving I realized I needed to start
gaining speed to climb the hill into town about a mile away. All
went well, and I was able to do about 50-60 km/h most of the way.
Aside from incredible braking effort, and a bad clutch smell backing
it up my driveway, the little 1.6l diesel performed flawlessly for
another 4 loads of gravel after this!

ps: The engine was still running fine 2 yrs later when I swapped for 
a turbo at 280,000.
