If you don't mind a &quot;pre-owned&quot; manual, you could try making a deal with your 
local shop/mechanic.  I went to my mechanic and asked if he had a current 
Bentley; when he said &quot;no&quot; I offered to split the cost of a new one with him if 
he would give me his old one in exchange.  This way I got one only a year old; 
since I have an 84 I figure nothing can have changed (?).
