Subject: 15 in. wheels on Vanagon

I'm told that the Vanagon bolt pattern is identical to Mercedes, and would
like to consider aftermarket Mercedes wheels, to get 15 inch wheels and tires,
thus larger rolling radius, thus higher effective gearing.  Does anyone know
details of this approach, as to offset, brake clearance, and what to use for
lug nuts/bolts?

Thanks
B.
