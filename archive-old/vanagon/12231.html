Subject: Re: Cracked expansion tank



Check all of the ports on the expansion tank. Mine has a crack in one of
the hose barbs at the bottom, only noticed when the hose was removed, or
maybe caused by the ham-handed owner removing said hose :(.

The plastic does seem embrittled by age and heat (as far as I know it is
13 years old), time to get a new one.
