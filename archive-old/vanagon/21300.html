Subject:  it's raining in my van! 

i seem to have a water leak in the right rear corner inside my van,
enough to soak half of the cushion on top of the engine compartment.  it
is probably due to water coming in the air intake vent.  before i rip out the
upholstery to see what the deal is (i already did halfway anyway, and
it's all wet underneath), has anyone had this happen, and can it be
sealed from the outside?  thanks in advance.

p.s. - i'm thinking of using white shoe polish type stuff on a few on my
headliner to cover the dinge/stains which won't wash off.  any other
suggestions?  also, what will remove excess headliner glue from metal?
