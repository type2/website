U think u have it bad. We are getting stupid weather changes here in
Northern Ontario. In a one week period we went from -50c with the windchill
to +5 with toons of rain back to -30 the same day we got rain and now we
are going to get a huge dumping of snow! My vanagon is having a heart
attack. Thank the Vw Gods I found this mail group list because everything
that could go wrong with my van this winter did. All u guys have been a
great help thnax alot!:)

&gt;Sorry folks,
&gt;
&gt;Just had to vent a little... It's now been over a month that we've
&gt;had SNOW on the ground here, even though it hasn't snowed since Dec
&gt;29 or so. Now they're calling for more, and we had a dusting this
&gt;morning. This is NOT normal!
&gt;
&gt;Since I don't have either a Syncro or a Propex, I am desparate for
&gt;spring to come...
&gt;
&gt;arg.
