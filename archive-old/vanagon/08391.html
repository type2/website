Welcome to the list.....

&gt;
&gt;   I'm curious to learn about whether the 2nd generation air cooled Westphalia
&gt;   of the 80s is a better investment used than a newer 5cyl 3rd generation 
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
they are really called type IV s....

&gt;   Wesphalia.
&gt;
&gt;

I guess I can let Joel and Ric slug this one out... Yet, being the current 
owner of both types of vehicles, I can give you a layman's comparison:

The EV engine definitely has more torque and more power.
The snow/ice handling, wet road characteristics of the EV are better.
    In fact, I'd venture to say there are very few front-wheel drive
    cars that are better than the EV -- My '85 Audi 5000 did not handle
    any better on snow and ice (it was also a 5spd)
the A/C (dual) is better in the EV (I guess you do not care about that)
the heat is better in the EV
the EV in general handles much better

The Vanagon is shorter 
The Vanagon definitely has *superior* maneuverability
The vanagon has more 'character' 

Mileage of both types are approximately same
