Ouch!  I did this a few years back after filling up the tank.  Rolled 
under the Bus (been doing it for about a week) with the claw hammer, 
arced across the terminals and damn near ran over myself.  Vowed to fix 
the problem ASAP.  (Turnout out that the ground strap on the tranny was 
in two pieces).

&gt; Oh, you'll want to do the above with the bus in neutral!  =:O
