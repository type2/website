Subject: Front turn lenses '72 bus
Date: Thu, 11 Apr 1996 12:40:56 -0500 (CDT)

Could some kind soul please clear this up for me?  I am at work 
without all of my jiffy manuals.  Also, I posted this to the group and
I want to get things corrected if I posted in error.  This would be 
for U.S. spec vehicles.

'71 has the low down front turn lenses, several inches up from the 
bumper.  Also, it has the single  oval red lens in back and the back 
up light above that, seperately mounted.

'72 has the same lenses up front and the one piece clear, amber, red 
tailights.

'73 has the way up front lenses, on either side of the air intake 
thing on the front of the bus, several inches below the windshield and
the same rear lenses described for the '72 bus.

Yell if this is wrong.  The '72 shares the front brakes with my '71 so
I keep my eyes open for them.  Calipers and disks for these are tres 
tres expensive.  Jim
