&gt; 	In case no one remembers, I've been working on the engine from my '73
&gt; bus\camper thingy.  I had a lot of trouble getting the heads off but today I
&gt; finally succeeded.  Oh boy, it seems that the intake valve seat on #3 somehow
&gt;slipped out and got jammed askew in the head.  Not only that but the piston has
&gt;been hitting it and now has a nice dent on the face (it is right to assume that
&gt; the piston need replacing?).  For some reason, piston #4 has a similar but not
&gt; so big dent, also from the intake valve I guess.

Yes, you will need new pistons valves and seats.  Since the pistons are
usually sold in sets with liners, you will probably end up with new
liners too.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. It's pretty obvious that I need heads, so I'll be getting a nice pair soon.

Why is it obvious?  If the castings are okay, you may be able to salvage
your old ones.  Have a machine shop check them out.  It might be cheaper
to replace the guides, seats, and valves than to get a rebuilt set of
heads (and you won't be putting parts of questionable origin on your
engine).  My sources say that a lot of rebuilt VW cylinder heads are
junk.  If you get rebuilt ones, get them from a reputable place (like
GEX) and it would still be a good idea to have a shop check them out.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. I need pistons right?  Do I need to get cylinders too?  Do I have to replace
&gt; all four together?  Should I?

Yes.  Maybe not, but you will have to anyway.  No, you don't have to, but 
yes, you should.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; 3. In case I need to get pistons and cylinders, and I'm getting new heads
&gt; already, I'm thinking about getting something with a bigger bore.  How does
&gt; that sound?  

Smart.

&gt; 	Do bigger cyls require a different head or do they all fit on the
&gt; stock 1700 heads.  

Is that a question.  Seriously, all you have to do is have the heads
flycut to 93mm.

&gt;					Or will I need different heads for what I'm thinking. 
&gt; Basically, I would like someone to tell me a decent piston\cyl\head setup which
&gt; will give me a bit more power but not cost too much because I am poor.

Join the club. 

You can get 1800 pistons and liners for the same price as the 1700cc
set.  They are a direct swap - you may have to have your heads flycutt,
but that's it.  For more details, see the HP book, &quot;How to Rebuild your
Air Cooled Volkswagen&quot;.  It will explain everything.
