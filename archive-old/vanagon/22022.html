Subject: Re: Window '79 poptop camper

after you take the screws for the door armrest off, the armrest will come
off. Then for the window crank it issort of encased in plastic;gently take a
bladed screwdriver and pry it back where the handle is connected to the
crank, it should pop off to expose a phillips screw. caution: it will not
come off completely so be careful not to bust it. then the door panel is held
on with little metal clips that &quot;pop&quot; into small holes in the door should be
about ten or so all around the circumferance of the door pahel. * these clips
are metal on my '70 Kombi, however, they could be made of plastic on your
late model, I am not sure. If they are made of plastic you will more than
likely break several of thyem, but they can be purchased at part stores or
salvage yards etc.  Peace.
