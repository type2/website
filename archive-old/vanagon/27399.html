&gt; 	Another small question relating to wiring again, Of the 8 fuses
&gt;      in my '62 the only 16 AMP fuses are for the headlights and starter, the
&gt;      rest are 8 AMP fuses. Is this correct? Thanks for any help.

My Clymer manual puts 16 amp fuses in the rightmost two slots of the
8.  8 amp for all the rest.  The rightmost is starter and stuff like
horn, interior lights and radio, the next one in is the brake lights,
the turn signal stuff, and the wipers.

Actually, is the starter fused?  I shorted out the rightmost
fuses by trying to turn on the dome light but the car 
still started.

Also I shorted the 7th fuse too (by running my 6v wipers
in my 12 car :-( a few huge resistors from Radio Shack and
I think I'm ok) but the car didn't turn off (Coil terminal
30 is hooked up to this fuse too) ok now I'm confused (pun).
