Subject: Re: oil filters 

Having used WIX Filters in the past I know they're a decent filter and I
still use them on my Chevy and Toyota Pickup.  But I'm still partial to the
OEM and stick with them on my VW's.  Using a larger filter doesn't really
increase the capacity all that much anyway.  But for info's sake here are
some P/N's:

Original Filter:  OE 021-115-351A  WIX 51319 (I believe)

Larger Filter:  WIX 51515 or 51452 (51452 has a slightly larger width gasket,
otherwise it's the same)

You can also use the Diesel Oil Filter OE 068-115-561B which is larger than
the smaller one on the 2.0.

Whatever ya do stay away from Bosch Filters - they're junk (they burst when
engine is cold).  If using OE, use Mann or Knecht.
