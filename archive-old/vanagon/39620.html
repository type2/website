Subject: RE: more on shocks


&gt;the shocks i was looking at are gabrielle's. also, i was looking in haynes
&gt;about the procedure...do you really have to take off the wheel itself?

I did, since I only had a floor jack and my apartment carport. New shocks
bolted right on, though, front and rear to the 1980 V6anagon with stock
suspension. Didn't look in Haynes, Bentley, or even think very hard, so
the job was right up my alley   :^)

BTW, Sears sells shocks made by Gabriel for the vanagons, all years
I think. I got mine on sale for $16.99 each plus tax, and they were
shipped free to my door by UPS from wherever they were stored. Took
three days. They're a soft, passenger-car-feeling shock, and seem
acceptable, especially considering the price. If I had it to do over,
I might go for a stiffer shock like KYB (they make a gas-a-just for
the front, GR2 for the rear) or some other higher-priced shock.

Call around a LOT-- you'll be surprised how much prices vary for the
same shock.

My $.02

 &quot;Lord, give me serenity to accept what I cannot change, the strength to
 change that which I can, and the the firepower to make the difference.&quot;
