&gt;are you SURE it was a Trooper?? and not maybe an imported VW Ilitis??
&gt;VW makes a trooper-looking sort of vehicle for the german army.

I think he could be right (again!):

This vehicle was seen in the Washington DC area, where you can often 
find non-US models of foreign cars on the streets, because diplomats 
don't have to comply with those pesky US DOT and EPA regulations. 

Also, the German military (airforce?) has a substantial presence
in the DC area, as they have a training facility or something out at
Dulles airport. They bring their own military vehicles.
