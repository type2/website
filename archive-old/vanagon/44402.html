Subject: For Sale in PA Area

I had an ad in Limbo looking for a Double Cab, and I just recently bought
one, however, I received a phone call today from someone selling the
following:

'88 Westy
'80 Westy (2)
'86 Synchro ($6K w/ approx 100K miles) sez in good shape.
'78 Westy
'77 Karmann Ghia convertible
'71 Singlecab
'71 Westy (2)

Contact is Jane _at_ 717/396-9116

Sorry, I didn't get more information. I was in a hurry to get out the door
and head off for the CCC round up in the Sequoia's. Let me know if anyone
jumps on one of these.

Cheers,

Bren
