hey you guys, just wanted to say thanks for all the quick answers to my
questions.  of course, none of you agree with each other, but if gotten a
bunch of good advice.

guess i ought to intro myself too...

i'm a twenty year old college student, at Bates College in lewiston, me. 
my bus started life as a '73 MB deluxe with a sliding roof.  when i got
it, it had an engine that only fired on 1,3,4 (two made a lovely sucking
noise), a huge bed in back, leopard skin curtains and headliner, and
enough water coming through the roof to solve your Red Rocks shower
dilema.  why did i buy it?  i NEEDED a bus, never had one, never driven
one, NEVER EVEN BEEN IN ONE WHILE IT WAS IN MOTION, but i needed one.
after this purchase i had exactly eight dollars and change left over.

now...

i have a '74 porsche engine (1.8L, twin webbers) with less than two thousand
miles on it.  new clutch, new brakes, new tires, new wiring...  at x-mas we
removed the sliding roof and installed a pop-top salvaged from a wrecked '72. 
last week i banged, bent, filled, sanded, primered...the body is now
beautiful.  as of today it is half green, half primer. tomorrow, all green.

next...

custom camper interior, panneled walls &amp; doors, 


oh yeah...prunes?
