&gt;Hey all,

&gt;Anyway, here's where I need help.  How much should I expect to pay for a
&gt;new bumper?  What about repairing the old one?  The old one was in
&gt;really good shape before it got whacked.  Also I'm going to need a new
&gt;left end cap.  How much do those typically run?
&gt;
&gt;Any special things I should look out for?  Any leads on new/used bumpers
&gt;and end caps?
&gt;
&gt;Any and all help will be appreciated, this is my first accident with
&gt;actual damage so I'm new to this.  Thankfully, it wasn't my fault.

Boy, that is a rotten way to start the day. I'm glad, though, the damage
wasn't worse.

I just happened to have my Parts Place for Volkswagens catalog at my elbow
as I read your post, and they want $14.95 for a bumper end. A chrome rear
bumper is $230 new, $100 recycled. Steel/primed instead of chrome is $130.
Dunno if that's a good price or a bad price, but at least it's a benchmark.

(FWIW I've only had good experiences with Parts Place. Their number is
810-373-2300.)
