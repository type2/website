                   Auto Mechanics 101

I'm over at Pacific Bugs and there's a bunch of kids wetting
themselves around this bitchin' sano lowered '68 bus, the one
with no hatch on the engine compartment so everyone can admire
the chrome.  Chrome everything.  The kid has even chromed the
wires.

I go in, get the gaskets I came for, come out.  The kid who owns
the bus is explaining the facts of engineering reality to his
loyal subjects.  &quot;No, see, you don't need that spring because the
distributor is only turning at one-fourth engine speed.&quot;

&quot;Wrong.&quot; 

Stunned silence.  Their Master has been Challanged.  And by some
greasy ol' geezer driving a Toyota, yet.

I shoulda kept my mouth shut but American kids are already too
dumb to pour piss out of a boot.  On the other hand, ignorance is
bliss.  And the more veedubs the kiddies screw up, the more
business for me.  I open the door of the truck, start to climb
in.

&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; very snotty.  &quot;But the air-cooled Volkswagen 
engine is a four-stroke engine,&quot; the Master Mechanic sez, real
cool, little grin.  &quot;And the distributor turns at...&quot;

I sigh, shake my head.  &quot;Wrong again.  Four cycle, not four
stroke.  Two strokes, four cycles.  And the distributor turns at
half engine speed, not a quarter.  Go count the teeth on the
gears.&quot;

Confusion ripples across a half-dozen pimply faces.  Gears? 
Teeth?  I climb into the truck, fire it up, back out.  &quot;And you
need the little spring because I say you do, so put the
sonofabitch back in.&quot;  Hard stare at the Master Mechanic.  He 
blinks and I drive off.  The kids gape after me.  

I've no idea what spring he was talking about.  Being omnipotent
isn't as easy as it looks.
