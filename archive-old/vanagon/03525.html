Subject: Push Rod Tube Removal

Hi Gang,

Yes you can remove the pushrod tubes wihout removing the heads.
Simply remove the valve covers, the rocker arm assemblies, and
grab the tubes and try to push or pull them out. I had to replace
my pushrod tube seals several times. I found out how to do the job
from &quot;How to keep your volkswagen alive&quot;.

Hope this helps,
Al
