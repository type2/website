Subject: Re: Recipe for Diesel #1

&gt;Hello vanagonites,
&gt;Does anyone know of the recipe for diesel #1.


My '82 Rabbit (vanagon with growth hormone deficiency) owners manual has a 
winter recipe for diesel fuel, I think it says mix gasoline in at 1 quart 
per gallon of diesel. Since my rabbit is gas powered I don't remember the 
exact details. I will read this again tonight, and then post it. 

Please note!!!  I am in no way responsible for what I just said (worked for 
Reagan, why not me?). I'd be very reluctant myself to subject highly 
explosive gasoline to diesel engine compression loads. Wait for further 
posting.  tim s.
