&gt; &gt; Um...what are these &quot;aerofoil&quot; blades?  What brand are we talking about and
&gt; &gt; where do I get them?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Umm, I was vague on purpose... couldn't remember. So I ran out to the
&gt; parking lot, boy the lengths I go to for this group :), and looked.
&gt; 
&gt; Tridon Aerofoil. I got them on the spur of the moment when I saw an
&gt; autoglass place advertising them for $6.99 each.
&gt; 
&gt; I hear that Bosch blades are good also, but have had no experience.
