Subject: 6V to 12V gauge update.

It's me again, (Lee)
     
This morning I decided to have a poke around the fuel tank
to see if I could see the sender conections on it. I followed 
a wire along the tank and found the sender cap with two wires 
comming off it. I couldn't see the cap I could only feel it.
I just poked it a bit and the conections felt a bit fraid, but 
I never bothered. when I came to start the bus the fuel needle
shot up to half a tank (it was below the first mark last night!). 
So I turned the ignition off and on again and up it wen to half. 
On my way to work I wondered if the sender had stuck so I put 
another gallon of gas in the tank - up it want a little bit 
further this time.
     
Andy (Loughborough,UK) had told me that the gauge has a 5v Zenner 
across it so I believe that it doesn't matter about the 6v to
12v conversion. I just think that I had a dodgy conection on
the tank. We'll see how it goes when I use some gas up. But I'll 
probably put new cable conectors on the sender.
     
Lee.
