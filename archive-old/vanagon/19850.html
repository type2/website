Subject: Bay Westy Upholstery Snaps &amp; etc.

As I sit here daydreaming about last week's wonderful vacation, some other
VW related camping stuff comes to mind.  Before I left for my trip I looked
around for those snaps that hold down the naugahyde on the driver's-side
rear facing seat and hold the front wrap-around curtain over the front
windows (talking 71 camper here).  I couldn't find these snaps from generic
sources, but lo and behold, while on vacation at a camping store on the Blue
Ridge I found a kit that Coleman sells that includes the male/female ends of
the snaps and an installation tool.  I think 10 snaps are included and it
cost about $3.  Let me know if you need the item # and I'll look at the package.

Also, I looked in vain at my local marine store and a camping outlet for a
brass adapter that will allow me to use 1 pound tanks for my stove which
currently has a large fitting for the 20 lb tank.  I know it sounds crazy,
but on some trips I only have limited use for propane and I have plenty of 1
pound tanks kicking around.  Any cheap sources?

The etc.:
Something I noticed while scanning the landscape off the highway for old
buses:  old horse trailers (especially the ones with 2 tone paint jobs) look
an awful lot like a micro from a distance.  After many false alarms, I
finally realized that that smooth two-toned thing captured in my peripheral
vision was surely a horse trailer and not a barn door calling my name.
Well, maybe I gave an extra peek just to be sure. : )
