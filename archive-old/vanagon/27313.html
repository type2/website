Subject: Bus clutch replacement

All,

I am seeking the collectives wisdom for clutch replacement/oil cooler
replacement. Both are going to be done simulteanously, sort of.

Questions:

As I have never removed an engine VW or otherwise, what do I need to look

out for (I have Type II Bentley, Muir, Type I Haynes, will be getting Type II
Haynes soon) in the way of things I can't see(hidden bolts,screws,hoses,wires,
etc.)

Are there any &quot;special&quot; tools that I will need?

Is there anyone in the Austin area that is interested in a beer and pizza
for work and/or knowledge exchange program? My foray into the unknown
will happen on Saturday and Sunday. Email me directly if interested and I
will provide directions etc.

BTW the PO name it Otto van der Kamper, I do not think this a male camper,
it is not selfish and demanding (yet at any rate). Help on a suitable name
would be appreciated..... Cheers,   David    74 Thing    79 Westy
