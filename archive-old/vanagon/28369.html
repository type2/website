Subject: Spray Foam

To All:

I've identified one spray-able polyurethane foam:

   'Spray N' Fill Polyurethane Spray' manufactured by Insta-Foam, their
product/part number: SF100-01

I'm presently trying to track down a source.  The stuff is horribly
expensive, about $20 per cubic foot.  This particular formulation is
high-density, about R-8 per inch.
