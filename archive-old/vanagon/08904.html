Subject: ROOF RACKS



&gt; 

V&gt; I have a Yakima rack on my '78 Westfalia on which I have loaded       
 &gt; several kayaks and other gear 
 &gt; plus myself walking around loading things on top of the poptop with no 
   problem..

   Thanks for your note, Tim. Any handy hints for mounting those &quot;gutter mounts&quot;
   from Yakima? I hate drilling holes in my vehicle where no holes existed
before.
