Subject: speeds in eurovans.


&gt;   Just as an aside, the top speed for a Vanagon and Eurovan is roughly the
&gt;   same.  I have an '84 Vanagon and my parents have the '93 Eurovan.  The tach
&gt;   runs roughly the same rpms at speed in 4th and 5th (Vanagon, Eurovan
&gt;   respectivaly).  The redlines aren't much different.
&gt;
&gt;   When coming back from Minoqua (northern Wisconsin) to Madison we were going
&gt;   with traffic at 80-85 mph all the way (happens to correspond to 4500rpm or

Aha!  my (really, my wife's) EV does not have the Tach, so I don't know
no red lines -- I assure you, the top speed of the EV is A LOT faster than
80-85....

The '84s are supposed to have the in-line 4cyl. engine, right?
My '87 gets almost the same milegae as the 93 EV (+/-1mpg), but the EV
is definitely a lot peppier going uphill and the usable range of every
speed (especially the 3rd) is a lot broader than the '87.
