Subject: Arbitration process?

Anyone gone thru this?  Looks like I'm heading that way.  Took the
'86 into the dealer 'cause the factory rebuilt I put in last Oct
(10k miles) is already leaking coolant out the right cyl head.

The dealer sez all he'll pay is parts, since I installed it myself.
When I bought the thing, both the dealer and VWoA said it was fully under
warranty even tho I was installing it myself.
VWoA is &quot;exploring the situation&quot;.

*grumble*
