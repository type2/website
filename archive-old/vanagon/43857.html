&gt;These are the pins with the Beetle silhouette (3/4 view) with 
&gt;swastika-in-cogwheel (labor front logo) rising like a sun behind it.  
&gt;Lettering is incised in base and filled with red paint; the rest of 
&gt;the pin/badge is unpainted metal - pewter looking.
&gt;
&gt;Most excellent items; never seen one in person.  Odd that I found two 
&gt;within two weeks of each other, one in the nazi/wwII junk section in 
&gt;an antique store in Fernandina Beach, FL; the other at the good old 
&gt;Tallahassee Flea Market.

I've got one of these that I picked up for $20 at an antique store a few
years back.  It is identical to what you describe but it also says &quot;GES.
GESCH.&quot; on the back of the pin.
