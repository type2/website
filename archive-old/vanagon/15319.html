&gt; &gt;Is this da belly-pan?  I was looking in my 
&gt; &gt;how-to-restore-bug-and-transporter book (great book, BTW), and it had 
&gt; &gt;pictures of sheet metal to cover almost the whole underside of the 
&gt; &gt;kombi.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Real 23 and 21 window deluxes had a belly pan which covered the entire
&gt; under belly (between the wheel wells) and was added to strengthen the bus
&gt; due to the sunroof and possibly because of the add'l windows. I believe that
&gt;
In addition to sunroof deluxes, double door panel vans also have those
belly pans for extra strength.
