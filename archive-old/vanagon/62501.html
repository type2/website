Subject: Re: Westy 12v water pump

&gt;The water pump in my potable water tank won't pump.  Power to the unit,
&gt;ground OK, but no operation.  The local RV center doesn't  have a
&gt;replacement and the VW dealer's price is $60.00.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of a source for a replacement submersible 12 volt water
&gt;pump?

Just got Euro-American RV Products catalog?. He sells, at least shows, the
exact submersible 12V pump as I replaced in my '89 with a pump from JC
Whitney (about $20 if I remember correctly.) Don't know Euro-American's
price--he shows a part number of 255-070-805.

	Euro-American RV Products
	5517 Cleon Avenue
	North Hollywood, CA 91601

	818-760-4214

He still answers the phone as Delta-Six and the owner's name is Pete.
