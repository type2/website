Subject: Original Colors for a 67 TII

Hi VWphiles,

Does anyone out there know the stock color offerings for 1967 Type II's?
In particular, a friend of mine needs to know the different color 
combinations for his recently acquired Deluxe Sunroof.  I can guess 
based on ones I have seen, but I'd like to get the facts.  I have 
listings for Type I's, but not for the transporters.  Thanks.   8-)
