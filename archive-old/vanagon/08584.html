&gt; 
&gt; This morning, i was outside working on my wife's Renault5 windshield
&gt; (popped out) and thought that the vanagon needed to be started up just to
&gt; keep the battery up and to keep it lubed (it is in storage for the
&gt; winter). As per usual I put the clutch in even when the van is parked in
&gt; neutral. The clutch pedal went straight to the floor! No clutch!. The
&gt; fluid is just at the minimum line (doh!). But there is a braided line
&gt; coming off just above the min line. Normally having fluid at the min line
&gt; would be &quot;ok&quot;, but I am wondering if the braided line runs to the clutch
&gt; cylinder and if this is a lack of fluid problem. Or does cold weather
&gt; effect a clutch (ie something is &quot;stuck&quot; along the way). Any ideas,
&gt; solutions, similar experiences? TIA - DC 

Yes, that braided hose is the supply line to the clutch master cylinder.
You are either leaking hydraulic fluid from the brake system or the clutch
system.  Look for hydraulic fluid on the rubber boot at the base of the 
steering shaft where it passes through the floor board.  My clutch master
cylinder was leaking and dripping on that boot and then being absorbed by
the floor board material.
