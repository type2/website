&gt; I was reading in the Bosch Technical Instruction booklet about Electric
&gt; Starting Motors and it says, &quot;Blah, blah, blah... Starting systems are
&gt; designed to take into account a given voltage drop in the system. Therefore,
&gt; in order to avoid mechanical overload or overheating of the starting mtor, a
&gt; storage battery with more than the specified ampere-hour capacity must not
&gt; be used.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This raises the question of how to wire our auxiliary batteries. If you wire
&gt; two 12 volt batteries together, or allow them to connect together during
&gt; starting only as I have done, then it would seem you risk frying your starter. 
&gt; Hummm...

Interesting... now that you mention it, I have noticed that voltage at the
starter drops to 10 (or even 8) volts while the motor is cranking on my
bus.  I thought this was not normal.  Still, if the starter is rated 12V
then it should stand up to 12V.
