Subject: Idioit Lights?

I've had a continual problem with my warning lights.  Two days ago the last 
2 lights starting acting up - My battery light and OXS light blink 
intermittently and at the same rate.  Both lights seem to behave as the temp 
light on my Syncro, an erratic blinking that can happen under any 
circumstances.  Any Ideas???

My oil pressure light used to blink as well, fixed the problem by splicing a 
wire to the oil pressure sender switch.

Respond to me directly, I've been temporarily bumped off the list again.

Regards,
