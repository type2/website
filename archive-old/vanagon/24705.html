Subject: Re: Diesels

I had an 82 diesel with 18,000 on a factory rebuild and 92,000 on the 
body for six months in 1993.  I went to a local VW junkyard and purchased 
the guts of an 89 Westfalia interior and installed it. We bought the 
vanagon for $2,900 and the interior for $1,100.  I got everything hooked 
up and working great.  I did have qualms about taking the drill and saber 
saw to the body for water and electricity, etc, but my qualms turned into 
a tight fit for everything.  

It got 30 mpg and cruised at 65 to 70 on the flats.  But even a couple 
degrees of incline dropped the speed way down and drove the water 
temperature way up.  It had about the same power as my old 66 camper with a 
1300 and single barrel carb in it.  It's 3rd gear on freeway passes. 
If you're in a hurry forget it.  And you've got to drive it like a truck, 
to near redline when you shift, and downshift at the same spot.  I drove 
diesel pusher school busses back in the 70's so I was used to diesels.  

I have a problem with any  VW made after 1967, so although I didn't mind 
the westfalia/diesel, I would never get one again.  If I can't work on it 
and parts aren't plentiful and cheap, forget it.  I would take a class in 
diesel engines if I did own one again.  Also, I th ink the modern 
westphalia set up is lousy.  I like facing my meal partner, and the 
intimate feeling of having the closet on the door side.  Quirky, I know.  

At any rate, if you can get a diesel with a relatively new engine for 
under $3,000 and no major work needed you might consider it.  Also, 
beware letting the fuel level get too low in the tank.  Mine turned out 
to have so much rust in it from condensation I had to install a fuel 
filter just downstream of where the fuel line left the tank, and change 
it every tank, for four months.  Also, diesels are in very low demand, 
and you should play the &quot;I'd really like to buy your car but I've only 
got 21 $100 bills with me/to my name/budgeted to buy a car.  Wait for 
your price.  And don't worry about seeming ridiculous with your offer or 
waiting.  If you can't get it cheap, in my opinioni it isn't worth owning...

&gt; Does anyone out there have a diesel vanagon/westy. Was wondering what people
&gt; thought of these. What was the first and last year that these were produced
&gt; and what are their particular strengths adn weaknesses.
