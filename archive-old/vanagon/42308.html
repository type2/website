Subject: Bugout Camping at Bull Run.

I called the Bull Run Park, Burke Lake Park, and Prince William
National Forest in search of camp sites.  I prefer Bull Run, but here is a
precis of each site:

Bull Run:

Location:
This park is on the order of 10 miles from the Bugout.  The woman who
answered the phone at the park said it would likely be 30-40 minutes to
the Bugout (real bad traffic).  On the other hand, I know some
back roads that may halve that time.  Also this is a beautiful location.
Facilities:
Electric, showers, toilets.
Price:
$14.50/night
Reservations: Yes! but they are low on space.  We would need to call
today.  I talked to Pam there and if you mention &quot;vanagon&quot; she will do her
best to block us.  You will need a CC and the first night is not
refundable.


Burke lake park

Location:
Same distance as Bull Run in another direction.  Same trafic problems.
Same back roads. Not as beautiful as Bull Run, but not bad
Facilities:bath houses, water at each site but no electric.
Price: $12.00/night up to 4 people, $2.00 per additional person to max of
7.
Resertvations: First come, first served.


Prince William NF

Location:
~15 miles south of Manassas, way back in the woods.
Facilities:
Tent pads, water toilets, fire ring, and picnick table.
Price $7.00/night
Reservatiions: First come, first served

I have never camped in any of these (too close to home) but any of these
parks are beautiful and traffic in NOVA is always bad anywhere you go.  I
recommend Bull Run.  The park is very nice and probably as close as we can
get, tho I have never seen the camping area.  If you agree, signify your
assent by notifying the list and calling Pam at the park to reserve.  The
phone # there is (703) 631-0550.
