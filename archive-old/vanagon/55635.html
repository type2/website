Subject:  Re: FW: SA Rear windows- hey, they open!

&gt;if you look very carefully, you'll see that the windows are larger than the
&gt;euro/us/canadian vanagons. :(  and notice that the side body panels are NOT
&gt;the same shape ... the trim indention is gone and the sides are flatter.
&gt;take a look at the rear air intakes, too.


Zoiks!!   I didn't notice that they weren't the same bodies!!

Good eye unca Joel - (and who says eyesight gets worse as you get older??....
:&lt;)

This could throw a Hazet wrench into the works......

I had no idea VWSA was made it's own Vanagon body stamping dies - I thought they
were just using leftover ones from the Hannover factory.....

Can anyone tell from looking at that red &quot;Vanagon&quot; (Microbus)
pic,(http://www.mg.co.za/mg/oldvolks/newmicro.jpg) if the grille looks like a
different size (outer diameter) than German?  Or that the grille body opening is
larger than German?? Every time I bring up the image, there is a lot of
schrapnel, and I can't really get a good look.   Anybody??

Need to investigate this further...
