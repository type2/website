Subject: '82 diesel westy back on the road


Thanks to all the help I got, (Ron Salmon for ordering the parts for
me and Eric Zeno for the machanic's tips deserve special thanks), the
'82 diesel Westy is back on the road -- may need a new battery, but
that's it for now...

Couple of things:  The Kits I got did not have a peening nut and the
washer that's in between the peening nut and the outer bearing.  Are
these pretty standard and easily obtainable, or do I need to go to a
VW specialized parts vendor again???.  For now, I'm using the old ones,
but they clearly will not last too long -- the wheel ate into the
washer pretty badly once it was done with the ball bearing...

Another thing:  I did lose one wheel bolt.  The rim currently has teh
other four bolts attached to it...  Is this easily obtainable???


Thanks,
Cetin
