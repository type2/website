OK. UGH! I guess I'll get the 1500 watt model. 

YOU GUYS! Convincing me to pay up for a monster thing.

Anyway, I think I will mount it in the pantry under the sink and then I only
have to make a 1 foot run of 2 gague wire to the hot side of the battery
behind/underneath the driver. 

I wonder if I should mount a third battery in the tray on the outside wall
of the vehicle to the left of the engine.

Then, of course, I have to select a tiny microwave. What gives on this front
David?

&gt;&gt; Yeah... really little.  David took about 15 minutes just to heat up one 
&gt;&gt; little thing of Curried Prune Pilaf at Mt Lassen.
&gt;
&gt;It wasn't little.  And the main reason it didn't do so well was because
&gt;the inverter needs a good healthy voltage supplied to it to power the
&gt;microwave, and even with twin 8 gauge wires running to the batteries, I
&gt;was losing half a volt under a 50 amp load, and as soon as the batteries 
&gt;lost their &quot;surface charge&quot; the inverter would start &quot;complaining&quot; due
&gt;to low voltage.  I'm going to mount it real close to the batteries to
&gt;fix this problem.  =)
