Greetings all

I'm outta here for the week. Turns out the Saturn car company is making a
commercial which involves a bunch of Cat I and II cyclists (probably some
cars too : ) filmed at various locations. 1st stop Mt Evans.....
They are graciously paying us $200 A DAY to ride around and get filmed.
Who am I to turn them down? : ) 
I wonder if I can get the EV in there somehow?
Talk to you all next week........

Kevin
