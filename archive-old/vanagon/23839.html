Subject: Things i've learned with my VW

hey now,

i've learned several things in my 2 week ownership of a vw van:

1) patience. when you expect a repair to take a day, give it 3 days. don't
rush jobs cuz it will cause you problems later. take time to find good, quality
parts. don't take short cuts. it's a vw..you can't rush anywhere's anyways.

2) read. read up on what you are going to do before you do it. will save you
headaches and time in the future. i learned this the hard way.

3) shop around for parts. you don't have to pay $89.95 for a cv joint. order it
from a catalog._dot_call around. you'll save money.

4) don't work on the vw when you are frustrated. you won't get anywhere. you
might even mess something up

5) don't trust auto mechanics unles you know them personally.

6) have good karma. your vw will pick up on your mood like a horse. you'll
regret it.

7) ask questions ask questions ask questions ask questions. don't assume you
know everything.

8) subscribe to the vanagon list. good, kind, knowledgeable people.

9) good tools, like friends, will stand by you when the going gets tough. buy
quality tools, preferably Craftsman. you'll regret it if you don't. (Right
richard? remeber that tool to get the ring on the end of the driveshaft off?
piece of #$%_at_. wish i'd never bought it.)

10) take time to enjoy working on you vw. it's yours. sit back relax. have a
homebrew. don't worry.

take care,

jonathan 'who hopes to take his first trip around the block this thurs/friday
in his van that's only been outta the backyard once since he's gotten it.'
