Subject: Re: Fire Extinguisher Questions

If I am not mistaken, there is a newish type of fire extinguisher which 
basically depletes the oxygen from the air around a fire.  I saw one of 
these a few years and it was demonstrated on common household fires and 
the big advantage that was touted at the time was that there was no mess 
to clean up afterwards.  Anyone on the list know more about this stuff?  
If not, and if anyone is interested I would imagine your local fire 
department would probably know what the stuff is and if it works.  
FWIW,
dave.
BTW one of the big dangers was that you did NOT want to use it in a 
closed area because of the obvious consequences of oxygen deprivation on 
humans...
