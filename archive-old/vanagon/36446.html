Subject: Re: Towing a bus

it was a beetle tow bar attached to a 73 bus' eye tow loops, which were
stock.    These are not there on splits.  I forgetthe year of the bus to be
towed.  i now use a different kind of beetle tow bar which attaches to the
axle tube - sturdier.

i dont think any thing came undone- ithink we stopped to checkand make sure
everything was tight.
