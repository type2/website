Subject: Re: Phoenix events??

(Dan, ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com, asked about events in Phoenix this weekend) &lt;snip&gt;

Dan,
Ellis aka VanBondo is in fact a member of the AZ Bus Club.
Two events have occured recently. Both on the past two Sundays. The Arizona
VW Club event on 3/17/96 was a waste of time and very poorly attended. The
SW Bug-In II (Sun, 3/24/96) was better publicized and was a great success!
Unfortunately, no event is planned (to my knowledge) for the weekend of
3/30-31/96.

The Phoenix Bug-O-Rama &quot;weekend&quot; is scheduled for April 12-13/96. (Friday,
road rally and the main event on Saturday).  Double check the latest Hot VWs
page 104, or call Rick or Ann at (602) 863-6170 for details.
