&quot;Sure wish we could have good heat, A/C and plenty of power like those 
Eurovans have, but they aren't really Volkswagens are they?&quot;

To which the vana-goner replied &quot;Nah, they drive backwards.  Engine in 
the front?  I don't get it.&quot;

The splitty owner piped in with &quot;At least I look cool in my old bus.&quot;

The lofer pondered and pondered and said &quot;Well maybe its us looking 
backwards because our engines in the rear?&quot;

The vana-goner thought about it for a while and said. &quot;Well as long as 
VWoA can't figure out how to sell those Eurovans we can just keep sidling 
up to the bar while we wait for parts for our buses.&quot;
