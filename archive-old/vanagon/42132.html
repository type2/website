Subject: Whitehorse is VW central

Whitehorse (in southern Yukon (Northern Canada)) has allways been a
hot bed of VW activity, but this summer is turning out to be crazier than
usual...
most of the busses that putt around are '70s westies, i see ten or so a day.
but i've seen a couple of interesting ones in the last couple of days...
yesterday i saw an &quot;Adventure Wagon&quot;, it was a late '80s vanagon conversion
with a high hard top that would allow you to stand upright in the back, the
top had many little windows and no bed to speak of up there (there was no
sign of a pop top) the fiber glass top was nicely curved and the
back made a very cool point at the top (this was not a back yard job)...
(i'm no ascii art expert but...)

                         |

inside it had the stove, sink, and fridge thing, but not like the westie...
they were each on one side of the van, just behind the front seats, and 
there was an aisle inbetween them...there were back seats, that looked like
they would seat three adults (the back was much wider since there was no
water tank, cabinet or table thingie on the driver side)...behind the back
seats there was a cover at about the same level as the top of the seats, who
knows what was under that...this would be a nice van to drive (compared
to the westie) since there was no clothes hanger storage, and the top of the 
ceiling was much higher, so there would be less blind spots...

THEN, the other day i saw this '70s westie thing with the pop top BUT the
pop top popped to the side!!! the pop top was hindged on one side (the 
passenger side i think) and the canvas folded out kinda rounded like, 
(there must have been some poles or something to keep its shape) so
the hard top part and the canvas formed a sort of big tube while open...
much more space i would think, but the canvas would have been right on
the top so it would get very wet in the rain...the hard top part also 
sported many dark tint windows...pretty cool...

well, that's my story...
