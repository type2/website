Hi Bob, Hi All,

&gt;Sami pointed out that the late Gene Berg had told him his swivel foot kit
&gt;would not work on a Type IV engine.

At some point (73-74 I think) the type IV got adjusters that are larger in
diameter (9mm?).  Don't know the reason for the change but the swivel
adjusters don't fit these late model engines.

-Tom
