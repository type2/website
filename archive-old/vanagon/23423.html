Hey all,
A friend of mine up in Minneapolis has a 1978 type II for sale. It has 
some rust according to him but not bad, runs well, he is the first 
owner, wants it to go to a good home. I have never seen it as he has 
kept it in storage for the past few years. He wants $1200. For anyone 
in Minneapolis it is currently at the VWman shop on 24th and hennepin, 
strong engine. If interested either email me and I will pass it along 
to him or call him directly (the prefered method) his name is Paul Levy
he can be reached at 1-800-328-4674 ext. 4419 or evenings at 
612-470-5077. 
Peace,
Scoob
