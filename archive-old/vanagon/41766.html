&gt;in regards to the poundy thing (there must be a name for it (I call it a
&gt;poundimiform, actually), i also have a pair of sockets in the appropriate
&gt;sizes, 3/4 &quot; drive, a slider breaker bar the same, also a converter to 1/2&quot;
&gt;so  i can use it with the 1/2&quot; ratchet or breaker bar, as the urge strikes,
&gt;but the poundymiform is cheaper to buy than that pile of stuff.

Outside the VW circle, this wrench is called a striking wrench.  Proto makes
some really good striking wrenches.  They are readily available at a Grainger
location near you.  Bith 36 and 46 mm are listed in the catalog.
