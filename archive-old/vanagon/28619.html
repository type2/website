Subject: T-SHIRT ORDER IN/ NAME CHECKLIST 
Date: Fri, 10 Nov 95 12:41:40 EST
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

howdy there all. I just put in the order for round 2 of the list
t-shirts. The shirts will be a bit darker colored this time, with the
true-to-life bus colors reflecting an Autumn theme.
:)
Anyway, here's a list of who I have orders from, and what they are
(sizes).
If you don't see your name here, don't worry; I ordered 10 or so extras.

Now, as for those extras, what I will do will be to put them up for sale
after all the dust has settled from getting all the orders out.
If you haven't mailed your order, PLEASE DO NOT DO SO NOW. I will see
the postmark, and know that you are naughty.
 Another reason not to mail me is that I will be moving soon, and
therefore changing mailing addresses. Just wait, and like I said,
you'll get your chance. Anyway, I don't know if they'll be out by
Thanksgiving or not. The company just moved, and is running a bit
behind. I'll keep you posted.

Orders received from:
Ron Lussier 1 l
Johnny Stutsman 1 xl
Gary Clayton 1 xl
John Rottet 1 xl
Jim DAvis  1 xxl
Steve Reilly 1 xl

So, this is it. Actually, a bigger order than I anticipated. Anyway, if
your name is not here, but sent a check in already, then you will get a
shirt, although it will most likely be an extra large. 
Feel free to email me with questions.
Richard
