Subject: Syncro Operation?

I just bought a '86 Westfalia Syncro.  I have tried to find out how the Syncro
is supposed to work and nobody seems to know.  A lot of people &quot;think&quot; they
know how they are supposed to work, but it all sounds like BS. The guy I
bought it from said that I had power to the rear all the time and when there
was any slipage in the rear, power is automatically transfered to the front
tires.  He said that the only time I would lock the differential is if I was
stuck.  I own a 4-WD and always lock the front hubs when I am driving in the
snow or sand.  Why wouldn't I want to lock the differential if chains are
required or if I am driving over sand to PREVENT from getting stuck?  Also
when I make a tight turn and turn the steering wheel all the way to one side
or the other there is a definite resistance as if the front tires are not in
synch with the rear.  Is this how it is supposed to be?

Anybody know for real?
