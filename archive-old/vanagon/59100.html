Subject: '84 battery dies

I just got my '84 camper out of storage and the battery keeps dying on me
by the next day. When I pulled the battery in the fall, I accidentally made
some sort of connection and sparks went flying. At that point I wondered if
I shorted something out. It will start for a while after I charge the
battery. Any ideas?
