Subject: Towing bugs &amp; buses


To All:

Like all auto manufacturers, VW has a spec for towing things, carrying stuff
on the roof, and so forth.  It is a conservative figure.

As a general rule, if the tongue-weight does not exceed the amount allowed,
and the max weight does not exceed the gross weight allowed, the tow is
do-able.

The tongue-weight figure has to do with your ability to steer, the gross
weight with your ability to come to a safe stop.

Towing a bug or bus on its wheels often gives a misleading impression of the
bus' ability as a prime mover.   With all four wheels on the ground, the
tongue weight of the towed vehicle is virtually zero.  Pump the tires up to
50psi and finger pressure is enough to make the thing roll.  I've even known
guys to use a bug as a trailer (!) because it was such an easy tow, they
already had the bar, and so forth.

To me, the most imortant part of any tow is how the load handles and my
ability to stop.  It seems too obvious to justify repeating but if you've got
a lot of weight behind you the wiser course is to keep the speed down.
 Fitted with a big, torquey engine and a suitable hitch, an early bus makes a
fine tow vehicle.  But it don't stop for spit when the combined weight goes
above 4,000 pounds.  Later buses with disk brakes should handle a bit more
gross weight but all brakes will fade when overheated.  And a heavy tow will
push you places you may not want to go.

The ultimate trailer for use with a VW bus is probably a four-wheeled job
with very low tongue weight and electric brakes.
