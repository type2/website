Hi   just got my power steering leak fixed   It turns out that when my heads
were done the
mechanic took the power steering pump off  WHY??. Than when he put it back on
he left out the
bottom nut , resulting in my hydraulic oil leak . I further complicated
things by topping of the
reservoir with Prestone power steering fluid . Just 3 inches or so .  What
will this damage ???
Should I notify the mechanic that did the work and should he reinburse me for
my 50$ repair
today ? I went to his shop several times complaining about the leak , He had
some kid look at it
who kept calling the power steering pump the water pump . THe mechanic is
very highly
reccomended and the engine runs better than it ever did .
Also   my dealer is also a Winnie dealer , The VW dealer can't sell the new
van but the Winnie dealer can .
Same building , same guy as the VW salesman . Go figure
Crowley VW /Winnie is the only CT dealer that will sell the new van .

MIKEY
