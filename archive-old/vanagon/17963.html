The Bus stop has this book.  It is on page 65 of their 1994 catalog (they
don't have a 1995 out yet).  The price is $24.95 and the part number for it
is 38906.  Their toll free number is 1-800-544-5357.  This is also the number
to get the catalog for free.  Tht's my favorite four letter word:  &quot;FREE&quot;&quot;.
