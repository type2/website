Subject: Re: Warm air from under dash.

In a message dated 96-07-18 15:36:55 EDT, you write:

&gt;I've never been able to detect ANY flow on my '86 from this lever. 

Well, actually the flow doesn't exactly come out of the lever.   :)

The air flow path allowed or stopped by this lever is from the dash area,
through the front-front door seals, through the front doors, through the
rear-front door seals, up the columns beside the driver's &amp; front passenger's
heads, and back to the two pairs of vents in the rear ceiling area above the
windows.  If the door seal(s) are not tight, the air can leak out aroungd the
door, and the fresh air won't reach the rear area.  You might want to check
your seals.

Good luck,
