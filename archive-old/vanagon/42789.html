Subject: Mystery (to me) wire

'84 1.9L Vanagon 
There is a brown wire leading from the wiring harness at the left of the
engine (black wrapping) and going forward and through the tin and
disappearing *down there* somewhere.  :-)  I always thought it was a head
temp sensor that it was going to, but now looking at the Bentley's very
carefully, I can find no mention in the electrical diagrams of a head temp
sensor for my van.  Is there such a thing on my van?  If not, what is that
wire doing?  Whre does it go? 

Thanks!
