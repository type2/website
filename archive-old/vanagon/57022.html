Subject: Re: vanagon dependable jd powers study

J. D. Powers' survey was for the number of these things sold in 1990
model year still owned by the original owners.  Many MPV owners are
still owners (perhaps they can't dump them?).  I'm a little suprised
to find Vanagon owners still are, too, but I suppose that the few who
bought new Vanagons in 1990 must have been pretty damn loyal to VW already.

It's not suprising that VW did not comment the way Mazda did.  VW no
longer actively sells busses in the US, and the survey was for the 
long-discontinued Vanagon.  I think VW never really understood the market
or marketing in the US -- the vehicles more often sold in spite of their
marketing than because of it.

We looked at MPV's to buy in 1990, but decided that we really did not like 
the lack of *any* space behind the rear seat.  We never liked the Toyota,
and the Mitsubishi Van was not available.  We did not consider a VW, either,
since I had been a loyal VW owner for decades, and had *ZERO* confidence
in buying a new VW.  I regret this now, as we really have come to love
the Vanagons.  At the time, one VW bus to work on continually was enough!

We bought an Acura Legend new, instead.  Zero problems in 165k miles, but
we hardly drive it anymore. My wife likes the 1986 Vanagon much better
as a kid-hauler.  Too bad there's nothing to replace them currently.  Even
the new VW's are not an option, as she refuses to consider automatics.
