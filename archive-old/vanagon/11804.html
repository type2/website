Subject: Chevron FI Cleaner Specifics

There's been a lot of recent good-mouthing of Chevron fuel injector cleaner
on this list and on rec.autos.vw lately.

I haven't seen a Chevron dealer around these parts (Wisconsin) for a long
time, but a local FLAPS is advertising a sale on

Chevron Pro-Gard Fuel Injector Cleaner PLUS

Is this the good stuff?  Regular price is $7.99, sale price is $4.99, and
there is even a one buck rebate going on.

Also, they are offering something called Chevron Pro-Gard Clean-Up Engine
Deposit Remover.  Same price as the FI Cleaner.

Both bottles say &quot;with Techron&quot;.

Is there a sensible use for the Deposit Remover on a VW air-cooled engine?
Any cautions?

Does this stuff have a good shelf-life, so that it should be stockpiled
at the $3.99 net price?

Thanks for your advice!
