Subject:      Problem recreated under static environment (was more problems)

Ok, for those of you following this thread, here's the latest.
Went out this morning (approximately 68 degrees F) and started the beast
up, no problem.  Let it idle until warm (approximately 10-15 minutes)
and then shut it off.  Let it sit for approximately 5-10 minutes and
then restarted it.  Ran crappy, heavy fuel smelling smoke.  Shut it off
and took the #2 temp sensor out (again).  Cleaned the area around the
seat with a piece of sand paper until it shined.  Cleaned the interior
threads of the hole with a little solvent and dried.  Reinstalled the
sensor and checked with my ohmeter.  Checked out ok.  Started van, still
ran crappy.  Let it run for approximately 10 minutes (or so) and as
quick as it had started, it ended.  I am beginning to suspect that the
thermo time switch is sticking on and continues to operate the cold
start valve even after engine is warm.  Of course, with outside
temperature already above 80 degrees F I cannot do the test per Bentley
until tomorrow.  Question.  If I disconnect the cold start valve and
close the circuit with a test lamp, if the thermo switch operates, tries
to open the cold start switch, lights the lamp thinking that the switch
is open, no extra gas goes into the air mix and the running rich problem
is fixed (temporarily) until I can replace the thermo switch.  Does this
make sense, or is my VW addled brain reaching for straws?  Any input?
