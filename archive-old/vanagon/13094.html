&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;me, personally, i'd recommend YES on the reinforced sidewalls. i've had a
&gt;&gt;set of NON-reinforced sidewall tires on my vanagon, and i did NOT like the
&gt;&gt;squishy/squirrelly way it felt when going around corners.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;check into the XCH series of light truck tires in load range C ... that'll
&gt;&gt;give you the same stiff sidewalls as the reinforced (although i think the
&gt;&gt;tire does not SAY &quot;reinforced&quot; on it).
&gt;&gt;joel
&gt;&gt;

I am shopping for tires for my vanagon again too. One of tire dealers I talked
to said 6 ply tires and the reinforced tires are the same thing.

For XZX 185R14 reinforced side walls they want $66 each. After tax and all
sorts of charges they want $350 for 4 wheels. I want to shop around more.
