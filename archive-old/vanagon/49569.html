Subject: ABC Used auto parts in Mass. anybody been there recently?

I called ABC used auto parts in Mass. last wed. and asked about  some grey
interior stuff for a '86 up Vanagon.   I just called them again today to order
what I needed, and they said someone came and stripped out almost all of their
Vanagon stuff in the past few days.  Was it any listmembers? If so, please
e-mail me as I would be interested in a few things. 

&quot; you snooze, you lose&quot;
