&gt; This is a reposting from Saturday, 23 September 1995:
&gt; As seen in today's Minneapolis Star Tribune and Saint Paul Pioneer Press:
&gt;
&gt; '80 Vanagon camper, 110k miles, runs well, newbrakes, clutch, and starter.
&gt;  $2200/bo  612-719-6828

Oh sure... $2200 in the rust belt.  And I can't sell one for $700 here in 
CA.

Thom suggested that I try selling my '80 camper for $1500 OBO.  That way 
people don't get scared at the low price.  :)  Any takers?
