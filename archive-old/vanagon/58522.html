&gt;| First, I don't have any carpet that gets screwed down.  I have a thin
&gt;| (maybe 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch) layer of indoor/outdoor carpet that lays,
&gt;| under it's own weight and fit, directly on the floor.

	Do you have a silver rail along the edge of the door with 4 screws
in it? This is where you unscrew.

	In either case, your carpet should lift up and you should find some
soundproofing cork-like stuff. This cork-like stuff is the floorboards.
Not sure what your floor is gonna look like because I don't have the westy
converison, though you should still have the original bolts or/and holes
in your flooring...
