When you compare the EV Camper with a Vanagon Westy you will find
that the EV is smaller inside. People with the money to buy a EV
are accustomed to have high comfort. People, who do it without
comfort, do not have the USD to buy this expensive camper. A lot
of people like me use old (Vanagon) models which are less expensive
and offer more room and do their camper conversion themself. That's
my thoughts.
