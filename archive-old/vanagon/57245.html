&lt;&lt; I own a 1982 crewcab with a broken 4-speed gearbox.
 
 I am about to replace it...
 
 Can I replace it with a 5-speed gearbox ?
 
 Can/should I use the 5-speed gearbox from a diesel wanagon ?
 
 Can/should I use the 5-speed gearbox from a wassserboxer ?
 
 Is it worth the trouble or should I just get a new 4-speed gearbox ?
  &gt;&gt;

If your '82 CrewCab is a aircooled 2 liter then the answers to your questions
are as follows:
no
no
no
no
yes.

you can't use a wasserboxer trans in an aircooled van, and the only &quot;5 speed&quot;
trans in a wasserboxer was in the syncro, and that wasn't really a 5 speed,
just a 4spd with a  creeper gear.
