&gt;Ok I went thru the same thing this past February when we bought my wife a 
&gt;Subaru Outback....back then I was willing to sell the EV to buy the 
&gt;subaru...
&gt;
&gt;Well the crazies have struck again!!!! I have the opportunity to buy an 86 
&gt;Westy Synchro w/55k miles, original owner - third car in fleet, for approx 
&gt;$10k. The body is straight, the interior has hardly been used, etc...etc...
&gt;
&gt;I've spoken to Tom Forhan, and he says its a good deal....
&gt;
&gt;But the problem is that I have to sell the EV....so that begs two questions:
&gt;
&gt;1. Am I crazy??? (ok.... as it applies to the above dilemma....)
&gt;
&gt;2. Any one interested in a well taken care of EV/MV w/47k miles?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;HELP!!!
