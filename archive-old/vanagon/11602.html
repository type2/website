Subject: '90 better than '86?
Date: Mon, 13 Feb 1995 16:42:32 -0800 (PST)

So Jack Agnew says:
&gt; There is an opportunity to trade from my trusty '86 to a '90 Westy. I 
&gt; can't see that much difference, but I haven't explored it very carefully 
&gt; yet - does anyone know if it is worth the change for any upgrades, etc 
&gt; that were added in the last 5 years of the Vanagon's life?
&gt; - Jack
&gt; 

What kind of upgrades are you looking for?  The only possible upgrades are
like power heated mirrors, power door locks (may your '86 has em', I dunno).  
I was in Dave Garth's '86 and there isn't much difference at all.  How much
is the price difference?
