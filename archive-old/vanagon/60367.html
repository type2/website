Subject: Mud Flap Redo

Hi folks,
96 dollars for a flipping mudflap, that is rediculus.
I have been reading the MF(mud flap) thread and finally thought I  should=

say what I recently did to replace my 82's MF.  It cost me a couple of
bucks and maybe 2 hours.   I removed the old broken  mud flap from my
vehicle by unscrewing the it where it attaches to the vehicle and then
gently pulling it from th etwo holes on the side of the vehicle.  Replace=

these fasteners by going to the dealer and gettign new ones. You will hav=
e
to point them out on the microfiche.   =


Once removed from vehicle I drilled out the aluminum rivets that hold the=

two steel halves of the mud flap together separating the halves.   I
drilled the out the holes in the steel brackets to make accomodate a
thicker machine screw  ( Now you get the picture?).  =


 I then cut a new piece of rubber from an old rubber mat.  (Actually the
rubber mat was an old semi truck mudflap I had found along the highway) =

Any  thick rubber mat like material would work.   I cut mine a to fit the=

old bracket but then expanded the mudflap below to make it a little wider=
=2E =

Place the &quot;new rubber&quot; replacement between the two streel brackets, drill=

holes through all layers to fit your bolts and clamp it into place, then
merely reinstall onto the vehicle.  =


This has worked so far for me.  Price was right.   Anyone wanting further=

info can pmail me.  Also I have some extra semi truck flap material, mayb=
e
enough for two more.    It even has a design on it which I selectively cu=
t
to make the design almost look like  VW except the W is flat on the botto=
m
side.
Cheers
