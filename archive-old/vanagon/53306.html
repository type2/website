This rate is actually 25%

This rate is 2.5%

&gt;  I presume that Canadian and DOT requirements continue to be quite similar.
 

This presumption would be more likely correct if the vans had the same engine
in Canada as do the USA versions, like during the late Vanagon years you
mention.  Since VW has never sold a 5 cylinder turbo-diesel van in the USA, I
doubt if they'd have gone to the trouble of getting it approved by the EPA.
 Could happen though. Someone in Canada needs to look at the stickers that VW
applies to these TD vans and see if they bear DOT &amp; EPA approvals to know for
sure.
