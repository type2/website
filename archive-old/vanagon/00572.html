&gt;How can you tell if a Vanagon's radiator leaks?
&gt;
&gt;James
&gt;
Water under the front of the Van!?!  No, really I have had three - count 'em
- three leaks on my '84's radiator (time to save for a new one).

The leaks can be hard to see 'cause the water will drip into the spare tire
rim and not drip to the ground if it is a small leak.  The leaks can also
hold under pressure, and not under vacuum.  I had a leak that wasn't obvious
except that I was getting air up front in the radiator every day!!!

To really find out what is happening you have to remove the radiator and
pressure test it.  To get it out, you have to remove the spare tire tray;
remove the clips and pins at the hinge area.

Remove both of the grills and the two pieces of cardboard on either side of
the radiator.  disconnect the wiring from the temp sensor on the front of
the radiator and the cooling fan on the back.  Remove the two brackets
holding up the radiator and carefully lower the radiator out (with hoses
attached).  You can swing the radiator to lie flat on it's face and then
remove the hoses and try to catch the water/coolant.  When the radiator is
disconnected from the hoses you can put it on a bench and remove the cooling
fan and shroud.  

I just used the garden hose - slowed to a trickle - for pressure testing
purposes.  The leak is usually obvious - might spray you in the eye, look
out.  I sealed my three leaks with TRUE TEST epoxy putty.  I tried some
other stuff and it didn't stand the heat (no pun intended).  The two leaks I
repaired last year are still holding, the radiator is just rotting around
the epoxy.

My leaks were on the front lower left, rear lower left, and rear lower right
corners of the radiator.  I removed the fins from around the leaking area
and cleaned it with brake cleaner.  I dried the area with the compressor and
applied the epoxy to the leak and pressed it around the tube.  It cures in
about an hour (which is nice) and then you should re-pressure check it.

I have tried to silver solder the leaking areas to no avail!!!  Cleaning,
flux, whatever, didn't help and the area still leaked like a sieve with the
solder.

I suppose a radiator shop could have fixed it, but the epoxy is like 2.29 a
package and it has worked three times.

Hope this helps someone!!!
