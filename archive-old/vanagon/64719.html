Subject:  Door vents




My '88 has black plastic air grills at the rear bottom of the front doors.
I took the door panel off to install a map tray in the right door and
noticed that the hole in the door behind the grill is taped up with black
tape.

Does anyone know what these grills are for and why they are taped up?

Thanks
