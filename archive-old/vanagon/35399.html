Subject: Updated oil pressure switch? (wasserboxer)

Hi again everyone...

  Now for the next tale of woe... Some of you may remember that a year or
more ago, I posted a question asking if anyone had seen problems with that
damn dynamic oil pressure buzzer/light on the watercooled Vanagons. I got
a few replies from some people who did. Here's the two cent summary: drive
for 15 or so minutes at high speed, then decelerate, and at around 2200 rpm,
the oil pressure buzzer and light come on and stay on until the rpms go back
up above 2200 (usually from a blip of the gas pedal). Problem is worse with
10W-40 than 20W-50 and at higher ambient temps.

  I had my Vanagon in three times under warranty for this. The dealer
replaced the dynamic oil system circuit board, put on a new VW oil filter,
and screwed around. They never found the problem and I got disgusted with
their imcompetence and swap-till-you-drop mentality. When I had my Vanagon
in for 60,000 mile service to the dealer I use now, I asked them to look
at it. The mechanic couldn't find anything wrong and recommended replacing
the oil pressure sending unit with a redesigned one to go off at a lower
pressure. The service advisor noted that the oil pressure checked ok. He
noted that there would be four hours labor to do the job ($208) and said
that if I could live with it, he'd recommend waiting until I needed exhaust
work or other serious engine work (like head gaskets, but that's my other
story) so the labor cost wouldn't be such a big hit.

  It sounds like the dynamic oil pressure system was a loser of a design
and VW is compensating for the poor design in a brute force way: make it
less sensitive. Does anyone know any more about the lower pressure switch
and any admissions by VW on this?  Also, I was considering seeing about
replacing the switch with one that also has pressure sending capability
for a oil pressure gauge. Any ideas or experience on this?

  Finally, I wanted to publically thank everyone who sent me advice on
my head gasket woes. This is a great list of knowledgeable and helpful
people. Given the less than stellar reliability of my Vanagon, I don't
know what I would have done without you folks. Well, yes, I do. I would
have spent a lot more money and still had problems!
