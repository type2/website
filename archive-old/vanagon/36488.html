Subject: 82 smoking and crunching
Date: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 12:58:43 -0500 (EST)

  I recently purchasd an 82 vanagon and have been running it for a month 
now.  I've just recently tuned it up and fixing a few oil leeks, 
but now the little bit of smoke coming out of the exhaust has increased 
greatly.  I checked the compression and the #2 plug was wet with oil but 
the compression was 115 (the other three cylinders are 120ish).  Does 
this mean I have a leaky valve guide?  What else could it be?  If I have 
to get the head rebuilt should I do both sides or can I get away with 
only fixing one side?

  My other major problem is the transmission.  When shifting into third 
it crunches nomatter how and when you shift.  I changed the trans fluid 
(only had to drain out over a quart) and replaced it with non synthetic 
oil.  Can this problem be fixed easily or should I keep my eyes open for 
a used trans?

  Any advise would help me out alot.  I hate not having something to drive.
