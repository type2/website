Subject: oil/filter chg-light still goes on

Changed the oil to 20W50 dino juice last night and OEM filter.  New 
drain plug gasket in there; I guess that's what you get for the extra 
$.  Fixed my oil drip at the drain plug.

The oil light still fades to on when the engine is warmed up, but not 
quite as fast.  Even revving to 1200 (idle about 1000) makes it go 
off now.  Better, but I'm still concerned.  I mean, the engine has 
164k on it, but with new heads 5K ago (not under my &quot;watch&quot;), you'd 
think they'd check out the rest of the engine since it's apart (or 
can you put new heads on without dropping the engine?  I'd think 
not).

OK, so the next thing I might check before installing a real oil 
pressure sending unit and gauge is the pressure relief check ball, as 
described in the '96 archives (search for &quot;oil pressure&quot;) by Scott 
Sminkey.  Since the light fades to on, but instantaneously snaps off, 
it almost sounds like this could be the problem.  Wishful thinking 
perhaps.

A crankcase flush is another relatively painless thing to try before 
the pressure gauge.

Oh and since something always has to break on the way home from 
extended trips, my high beam indicator doesn't work anymore.  I'm 
starting to wonder if this whole oil light thing is some faulty 
connector back there since they're vertically adjacent lights.  

BTW, met some more Vanagon owners this weekend and told 'em about the 
list.
