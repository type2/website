&gt;Since my camper ('71) has pretty decent paneling, I haven't really looked
&gt;into this, but one issue is that the headliner panel is slightly wider than
&gt;4', perhaps some German standard (?).  I know the hardware stores just carry
&gt;4'x8' or smaller; don't know about the speciality lumber stores.  Yeah, you
&gt;could just have the grain run the other direction but I guess I'm kind of a
&gt;stickler for OEM look so if it came to that I'd rather just keep what I have.
&gt;I'd be interested in knowing if you find paneling in larger than 4'x8' sheets,
&gt;though.

Pat,
Those crazy Europeans create plywood in a 5x5 (actually some metric 
 measurement) sheet among other sizes. I went to the lumber store and 
 they have plenty of the 12mm thick plywood, called Baltic Birch, that 
 is very popular for making drawer sides and other structural objects. 
 I asked if they had the 3.5mm sheets and the guy said no. I thanked 
 him and decided to look at the thicker stuff for another project, and 
 lo and behold each stack of twenty sheets is sandwiched between a 
 piece of 3.5mm, good face in! I asked how much they would want for 
 these &quot;shipping sheets&quot; and the guy said &quot;take em, we toss them in the 
 trash&quot;. They are holding the sheets every time they break open a new 
 bundle for me. I am going to check other lots when I get a chance.
