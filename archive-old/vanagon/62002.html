Hi,

I just volunteered to send these instructions to people who request them 
in the future (duh?).  We all got them when we joined, but sometimes they 
get lost.  Feel free to keep them handy for your own purposes.  In 
addition Joel will be adding something similar to the Weekly Statz so 
that anyone the list will only be a friday away from the info.  A few 
extra lines doesn't seem like much on that behemouth file he already 
sends out.   ;)

Seems as if sometimes get 16 private emails with directions, 
othertimes...zero.  We must all be out working on or riding in the buses. 
 ;)

So I volunteer for this one for awhile.  wanted to give something back to 
the list.  take care
