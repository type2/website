&gt; Last i talked to everyone i was trying to sell my syncro.  We'll i just
&gt; couldn't do it!!  My wife is pissed, but i think she knows things would be
&gt; worse if i got rid of it.  My problem is that i'm due for emissions in
&gt; connecticut in a couple of weeks.  (connecticut has gotten really severe
&gt; concerning emissions). Last time thru i failed terribly and had to get
&gt; waived.  Of course this is after spending some big bucks and it still failed.
&gt; The dealer is no help, he said they all fail.  

Perhaps you could put on a fuel pressure regulator and reduce the fuel
pressure?  That should make it run leaner.  Anyone on the list have any
thoughts about that?  It might help if you posted your emissions
results to the list, so we could all see how it failed.
