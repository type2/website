yeh, I know that Joel, but on my Syncro, there's this axel thingy in the way
of a front left wheel mounted cable.

The cable goes forward from the back of the speedo, out to behind the
headlight, down past the drivers side of the radiator, and back along the
drivers side frame rail over the top of the front diff.  there I lost it,
cause I wasn't dressed for crawling underneath things last night.

I suppose I could of missed it beside the radiator, but I don't think so.

I'm hoping for someone with a Syncro who's found it before.

not quite Friday, but sincerely yours.

?? start at the left front wheel, and follow the speedo cable upwards
toward the dash pod ... the little box has got to be in there somewhere!!
on my non-syncro, the box is about the size of a large pack of
cigarettes. it has the two speedo cables screwed into it, and a three-wire
multi-plug gizmo with a rubber boot over it.
