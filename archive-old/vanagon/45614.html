Definately let us know how well it worked out for you.

&gt;Along these lines, Camping World sells a wonderful little fan-in-a-cage made
&gt;for mobile fridges.  Since it runs on 2 'D' batteries, there is no need to
&gt;modify your fridge.  I have one, and plan on testing it during the Inuvik
&gt;journey.  But it seems like a great idea...
