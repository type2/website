&gt;Legal Lights
&gt;
&gt;A good legal alternative to the H4 is the  Hella Plus lights and the CIBIE
&gt;Bobbie lights (which I have on my '85 Westy).  These also claim a 100%
&gt;improvement in light output and  may be as good in most ways as the H4s.
&gt;But they're cheaper and are approved by the DOT.  They have better
&gt;reflectors and a very even beam pattern compared to stock.   The difference
&gt;between these and the H4s is probably not enough to worry about, both are
&gt;tons better than stock, and this type is easier to get.  Pep Boys has them
&gt;and I'm sure other big FLAPS have them too.

Great report on lights!! Thank you!

You implied (but didn't say outright) that these legal &quot;Hella Plus lights and
the CIBIE Bobbie lights&quot; are not available as replacement for the '86 &amp; newer
rectangular lights.  Is this correct?
