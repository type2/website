Hey Rick, looks like you started something rolling.
Why not try for a date and a place and see who else
is interested?  We were thinking of doing something 
over Memorial Day Weekend (May 24-26), if the weather 
cooperates:

- I haven't been to Orcas Island in ages, sounds great, but I hate 
  to spend 4 hrs waiting for a ferry;  our BC friends may also be 
  interested, though their Victoria Day is a week earlier

- along the coast we like Ruby Beach and Moran; for better wind
  protection we often go to Lake Quinault 

- if lots of Oregonians speak up, I'd have no objection to 
  the mouth of the Columbia (Fort Canby)
