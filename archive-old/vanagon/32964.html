Subject: PNW Camping Trip - location alert

The Seattle PI had a depressing article (to me at least) this morning.
Some group named Bear Paw Resorts is planning on building some hotel/resort
complex out near First Beach, then leasing part of it back to the Quileute
tribe for their new casino.  They're also planning on building some large
RV park to go with this resort.

While this may be good for the tribe, its bad for me - right now the place
is frequented by surfers/kayakers/birders and occasional bums like myself.
Cheap, rundown cabins, small campground, etc. It's all Indian &amp; logging
land, adjacent to National Park too, with some of the most pristine beach
left in this country.
Putting a nice hotel &amp; campground there is going to ruin it - they attract
a different clientele and a lot more of them.

Anyway, given this thing is supposed to open in March, I would repropose
this location for a February trip. Yeah, I know it's 4-5 hour trip, and it
will probably rain, but it may be your last chance to be out there before
the RVs &amp; gamblers take it over.
