&gt;I saw a Vanagon Pasat yesterday.  So.. now I know about the Vanagon,
&gt;Vanagon GL, Vanagon L, with and without the weekender package, and now
&gt;there's a &quot;Pasat?&quot;  Anyone know what the difference is?

uhhhhh. well, you sure it wasn't 'Carat'?? that's just another name for
Higher Prices and Trim Levels.  if it really was 'Pasat' (or maybe 'Passat'?),
then it sounds like someone has been  playing games with the name-badges on
the back of the car (like i did). :)
