Subject: Porsche mailing group?

Does anyone know if there is a Porsche (specifically, I'm looking for a 911)
mailing group similar to this one out there somewhere?  I'm thinking of
buying a used 911, and would like to learn the ins and outs of those cars
before I decide what to buy.

Also, if anyone knows of any good websites or news groups, I'd be
interested.  I did a quick search the other day, and it seemed that there
was a lot of information spread out everywhere, but I could not find any
central sources.

Thanks,
Ed Wilson
