Subject: Dashboard disassembly

Greetings all.  I'm afraid I'm new to both the list and the world of busses so
if I'm doing this the wrong way please give adjustment advise.

I picked up the most fun vehicle I've ever owned about two months ago: A 1990
Westfalia Camper in really nice condition.  So far it has logged 7000 miles and
attended 4 skydiving conventions with me. Camping at the conventions was the
real purpose of the acquisition.

So OK, now winter is setting in and I'm thinking about doing some skiing.  Only
problem is that I went to try the heat for the first time and the cable that
opens up the foot vents in the front is broken. This means really cold toes
while my face burns red.  So the dealer wants a meager $12 for the part but
wants $390.00 to install it. Gulp.  Being a reasonable guy, I thought I might
tap some of this expertise and have a go at doing it myself.

So, I'm looking for a recommendation of a book that will walk me through the
process of disassembling my dashboard and then re-constructing it again.  Seems
like I could replace the burnt out bulbs and add a couple more lighter sockets
to power some add ons if I don't get into too much trouble.

I would also be eternally grateful for any tips or tricks about the procedure
and, if necessary, a warning about how guys who don't know what they're doing
shouldn't be doing things like this if I'm going to end up taking all the
removed pieces back to the dealer with a pitiful look on my face.

Thanks and wish me luck,

Clark Carr
