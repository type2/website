Subject: Re: Oil sensor removal

On Sun, 06 Aug, PWIES_at_loyola_dot_edu  asks:
&gt;Anyone with a bus ever replace their oil sensor.  I can't get the 
&gt;old one out.  Any suggestions would be great.
&gt;Paul


  I had a persistant small oil leak for the past couple weeks. Not much,
just a few drops in the driveway each day.  I finally tracked it down to
the oil pressure sensor.  I drive a '73 with a '78 fuel injected motor.

  The pressure sensor itself is potted inside a &quot;nut&quot; and the nut crimped
over the potting material.  The crimp came undone which caused an oil leak.
This one was under about 40 psi, as opposed to a leak at the valve cover gasket
(low pressure).  It could have been a real mess had it came undone completely.

  A pair of hemostats was used to remove the connector from the sensor (damn
stubby fingers ;)  Remove the little rubber boot.  I used a socket wrench to 
remove the old sensor.  The new sensor went in the same way.  

  Do not use teflon tape on the threads of the new sensor.  The threads complete
the warning light circuit to ground.  A guy at work here did that on his '67
beetle and went through two sensors claiming that they were defective.  Poor
parts guy had to set him straight on this with the third sensor.

Best of luck,
Jack
