&gt; &gt; I not that knowledge able but have though of two possibilties
&gt; &gt;         1,junk in fuel tank or something in filter(but why only on right
&gt; &gt; turns?)
&gt; &gt;         2 there is a noise from the back also on right turns that sound
&gt; &gt; a bit like a drive shaft or cv joint (kthunk a! kthunka! etc) is it
&gt; &gt; possible this is binding so bad that it stall the engine?

&gt; Hi Dave: I had the same problem with my 91. When I went around a right
&gt; hand corner even as easy as a freeway cloverleaf the engine would cut
&gt; out. It would start up very rough when cold also. It turned out to be a
&gt; bad spark plug end. I had it changed and it runs perfect.
&gt;    Todd Francis   Keep the faith


Thanks For all the advice guys.......It Turned out to be a Problem with 
my Brain I mean THE Brain! I got clue from one of the Replies Raised the 
back seat to Check it out Some how I had stored a small Ceramic Electric 
space heater Between the ECU box and the aux heater box (the cover of 
the heater is cast aluminium any way it was touching the cover of the 
ecu I removed it and Took the Beast for a Ride.....NO MORE Stalling!!
Beats me but There we have it.
I love my Westie again
