On Wednesday I visited the Caravan Salon '96 in Dusseldorf. I got 30 lb
papers, leaflets, catalogs and more during my five hours walk through the
exhibition. And I asked only for EV and camper's accessories catalogs. It
will take me more than two weeks to read 'em all. I will inform you about
the news of EV. Two URLs I can give you to see some EV Camper conversions.


The first one is a web-page from Dehler. Do you heard about Campers called
Profi? At present they have four different models. I checked the web page
but only yachts are shown. I think we all have to mail Dehler to add a
Eurovan Camper side. But you will find Dehler's addresses spread over the
whole world:

or send an e-mail to ask about more information

The second web page is owned by Karmann. The EV Camper they have at the
show is a EV single cab with a camper cabin in the back. This style of
vehicles we call 'Nasenba:r' because of the additional sleeping room
on top of the drivers cabin. Check out at
