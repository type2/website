&gt; I called them, and luckily for me, they don't do EuroVans yet...
&gt; they said something about EVs being &quot;bullet-proof&quot;, long lasting,
&gt; never wearing out, and being bought by real smart people who
&gt; didn't ever need to buy little trinkets like water pumps, 
&gt; head gasket sets, etc...etc...etc...   ;-)

Hmmmmm that EV is '93.  Quite a youngster I'd say.  Even my '91
isn't much older.  Let's see what crops up in say...oh, three years
or so.  And you have kids.  &quot;Daddy...Daddy! Look what happened to
door handle!&quot;  &quot;Daddy....Daddy!  What's dis' stuff dwippin' under
the car?&quot;  :[ ]   ;)
