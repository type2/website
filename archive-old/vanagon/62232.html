&gt;Does anyone know how to get technical bulletins from VW. I noticed that
&gt;there are quite a few for my vehicle and I was wondering how I might get
&gt;my hands on them to see what VW does about the problems. Thanks.

these folks used to sell them in printed form. but i think they sell only
the microfiche now:

Technical Bulletins
   Volkswagen Product Service Publications  (800) 544-8021
   c/o Dyment Distribution Services         (216) 572-0725 8am-9pm EST
   P.O. Box 360740                          visa/mc accepted
   Strongsville, OH 44136                   (800) 423-4595 svc bulletins

   subscription to service bulletins (currently being issued) is
     order # VBS 88, cost is $40.00/year.

also check with:

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration    (202) 366-2768
Technical Reference Division

Depending on the number of TSBs issued to date for your vehicle, it will
cost $20 to $40 to have them reproduced and mailed to you. You'll need
to send a written request, but first call to hear the recorded message
for instructions. &quot;
