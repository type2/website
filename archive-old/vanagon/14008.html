Subject: Re[2]: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

Typically, there are a few people selling entire bugs and busses.  I'm sure that
this year will be no exception.  There are a lot of parts too.  Plus there is a 
judging of busses, bugs, and ghias.  There will also be vendors (I know that 
Penninsula Automotive, a VW parts reseller will be there) along with all of the 
swap spots.

If there is any more interest, I'll post the directions, opening time, etc.

I'd love more details on this.  Do people sell Vans there?  Or just parts?
