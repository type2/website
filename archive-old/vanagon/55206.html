Subject: Re: Fw: Ques: squeak under passenger seat.

&gt;| I too have this only in cold weather. I thought it was the spare tire at
&gt;| first, but no go! Again, only in cold weather. Any ideas?

	If it is coming from under the front seat, you might want to go check
out your brake calipers. Give it a wiggle near both the top bolt and the
bottom. I found that my caliper wiggled a little. When I pulled the thing up,
I found the top guide bolt was rusty and was preventing the top of the caliper
from sliding along the bolt. I stuck in some WD40 and then some penetrating
oil and it moved much more easily. The squeak returned after about a week, but
disappears when I step on the brake because the caliper is being supported with
tension on both guide bolts instead of just the upper bolt.

	Does anyone know if a 87 Syncro has a different brake carrier (note
not a different caliper, the carrier is the thing the brake pads sit in and
which attaches to the control arms with two large bolts which need to be
torqued to 150 ftlbs) than a standard vanagon? I need to make a trip to the
junkyard to pull a few things off and would love to get a carrier that has
rust free guide bolts (or can I just sand the rust off, grease the guide
bolt and throw the caliper back on?). I am going the safe route for now by
changing out the carrier because these are my brakes...
