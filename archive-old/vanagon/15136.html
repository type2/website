HI you guys,
About those CV joints...I used a slick method (IMHO) to fix mine.	
If you take both sides off completely, clean them up, repack grease,	
and then SWITCH SIDES, you can cure the problem.  If they're not	
beaten up too badly yet, that is.  They will wear on the opposite	
surfaces and you can get at least 10K out of them.  It's worth the
trouble considering how much those puppies cost.			
Happy Motoring,
Chris   '71 Camper

P.S.    Yesm, Rachel...  I'm one of those guys with your bus!  I've been
through everything  except the tranny, so feel free to quiz me.  Bye
