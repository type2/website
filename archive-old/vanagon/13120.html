Somebody asked (I'm temporarily digest-challenged)
asked about a heater knob next to their steering wheel
on their '82 or '83 Nagon....

On NuBus ('82 diesel) it is a green knob which controls
the defunct diesel aux. heater. The heater sits under the
floor and is supposed to warm the bus up real fine. 
In fact, it will *preheat* the van 'cuz it works without
the engine clacking.  Wish mine worked....

Neither mine nor Stephen Smith (rest his net-soul) have
a working diesel aux heater. My mechanic won't try and 
fix it either :-(
