Subject: 85 Westy 4 Sale NY

      Went out to New York the other weekend to pick up a '72 and '79
camper and 
     saw a nice 85 vanagon if anyone is interested. The guy is asking $1900 
     (might go lower, he did on the two we bought). It's in good shape. Was 
     hit in the front driver side (corner near the light) and looks like it 
     was banged out - not bad at all, not rusting there.  Rest of the body 
     looks good (didn't see any rust). 
     
     Interior was in awesome shape. The back bench is the contoured type 
     (more modern looking). Looked like all the bells and whistles where 
     there. Didn't try them though. 
     
     The guy says it runs but the exhaust needs work (didn't start it 
     myself). The rear tires are flat. He said he'd be willing to tow it on 
     a flat bed to anyone within a 4-5 hour drive for about $150 plus gas. 
     
     His name is James Grant 718-471-1216. His vans have been listed in 
     &quot;For Sale&quot; messages before. He buys these things from repo auctions 
     for practically nothing. He says he comes across about 2-3 VW campers 
     every 6 months or so. He's a good guy, did well by us, so if you need 
     an '85, check his out. He's honest on the phone - will tell you 
     everything he knows about the van. (He said no rust on the 72 we 
     bought and by God...there was NO rust).
