Subject: RE: Something positive

Well, I only owned Fritz for 5 months but I didn't have to do _anything_
except an oil change.  He was my daily driver (although I guess I should
qualify that by saying that I work at home) and the regular 2 times per week
trip to Whistler.

I heard from ICBC today that they are calling it a &quot;total loss&quot;.  They
haven't told me what they are going to decide what it's worth.  However, I
do have the option of taking their replacement value less what they would
get from a wrecker, and then doing the repairs myself.

Anyone know of a late 70's Westy that has never been subjected to the rust-belt?

Glen,
