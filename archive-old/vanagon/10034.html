Subject: Re: deep cycle batteries

&gt;Ok, now a technical issue
&gt;
&gt;The fridge I just installed is 12V, but hte rest of the bus is 6V.  I'm
&gt;thinking about using a deep cycle battery for the time being, and just run
&gt;the fridge off of it until some day I feel like converting to 12V.
&gt;
&gt;How long should I expect to be able to run off of a deep cycle battery, with
&gt;a rated load of 5.5A?  (Looked like a 4A load on the charger)  Am I
&gt;even close to having a practical solution?  I would only be using the fridge
&gt;for a day at a time, like for beach trips.  Maybe longer in the future, but
&gt;I don't have any camping trips planned, except for maybe the next big bus
&gt;excusion.
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;

Why not put two 6 volt batteries in series?  This would give your 12 volts, 
and with a little trickery wiring, you could charge either battery at a 
time.  I don't think you could charge both simultainiously.

let me know what you think, I'll be thinking about a switching arrangement.
