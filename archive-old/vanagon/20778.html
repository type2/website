Subject: Unseen Evaluation

O.K., its time to make those blind appraisals.  Here's the story:  1982 
Vanagon Westy, 105K miles, excellent runner/driver, some oil dripping in the 
vicinity of the filler tube, small rust spot under rubber in rear hatch 
window, excellent canvas, excellent seats/headliner/cabinets/bed, 
water-pump stuck, some problem with the external electrical hookup 
(outlet seems to be loose).  The Vanagon looks cherry (oh, sorry, VW 
T&amp;A-speak).  I mean it looks very, very good (but you know the art of 
detailing these days...).  It's on its 6th (?) owner, is at a used car 
dealer, and they are asking $3800 for it.  I don't value it any higher 
than $3500, but I may not know whereof I speak.  Friends of mine 
are looking at it.  Feedback, please.  Thankyou. :-)
