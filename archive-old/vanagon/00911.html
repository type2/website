Definitely make sure to visit Boulder, CO, and Rocky Mountain National 
Park.  I did a cross-country trip in 1992 with a friend who was moving
from Boston, MA to Palo Alto, CA in a 79 Scirocco with over 200K.  We
enjoyed Boulder so much that we drove from there to California in one (very
long) day to pick up a friend (already living in CA) to bring her back to
see Boulder.  She had missed it on her cross country trip about a month
earlier.  Great place w/lots of fun stuff.  Rocky Mtn is gorgeous as well -
you can *touch* glacers at 13,000 feet in August.  Bring warm stuff - it gets
cold at night when you are camping at 10,000 feet.  If you can get to western
South Dakota,  it would be definitly worth your while to visit Badlands Natnl
Park.  Another nice place to see is Echo Lake in California (around 70 miles
north of Yosemite)  Had a snowball fight there last year on the fourth of July,
dispite the fact that the air temp during the day was in the high 70s.
Speaking of Yosemite... go there too!

Have a blast!! (envy, envy, envy)
