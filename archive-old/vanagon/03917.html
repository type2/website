Subject: oil pressure question


Would those of you with air-cooled vanagons AND an oil pressure
gauge out there tell me approximately where your gauge reads
while driving at highway speed?

If you also happen to have an oil temperature gauge, or even
a cylinder head temperature gauge, I'd be interested in those
readings as well.

Thanks,
