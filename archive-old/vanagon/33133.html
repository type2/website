&gt;&gt;Mercedes 207D (Westfalia camper), 1984, 5 Spd., 40K Kms, 7 pass,
&gt;&gt;sleeps 4 adults, exc. cond.  Never winter driven, very rare. $42,900
&gt;&gt;Now I wonder, did Westfalia convert this like a standard VW
&gt;&gt;Westfalia?  Has anyone seem one of these things?

&gt;yup. there's a fellow in town who has one show up in his yard every now and
&gt;then (don't know if he owns it, or if frequent visitors do). it is a 
Westfalia
&gt;.. but it is a BIG sucker! very large, front engine-rear drive, diesel
&gt;engine. BIGGGG truck. :)

Yea, there is one of these for sale here in Portland (I am pretty sure that 
it is a 207D).  I was walking by it on the way home from the pub and this 
thing is a *TANK*, I mean I thought I was hallucinating.  It kind of reminds 
me of that thing from Stripes but not as long.  If anybody here on the West 
Coast is interested in one, e-mail me privately and I will track it down.
