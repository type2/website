&gt;Has anyone seen/made/bought a locking latch for the engine compartment
&gt;lid on bread loaves?  Everywhere I look, it's just an unlocked button
&gt;latch.  The mechanism appears to be significantly different (p &lt; 0.05)  :)
&gt;than the mechanism for the big rear lid into the passenger compartment, so a
&gt;simple swap is out, right?  This open engine compartment seems like a
&gt;security risk to me, leaving the engine open for tampering, and running a
&gt;risk of theft for the battery, tire chains, and other junk squirreled
&gt;away back there.

i put one on my 71 bus ... i just bought the beetle locking rear lid latch
(might be easier to get it from a junkyard nowadays). it's the same gizmo.
one great big phillips screw holds it in place.

now, i don't know about the later hatches on the type4 engined buses, but
it was a direct swap on the 71. only problem was, back then, i didn't know
that a locksmith could re-key the thing, so i ran around with a different
key for the thing (the dealer order included two keys for the hatch/lid lock)

it made me feel a whole lot better about that big expensive battery sitting
back there. :)
