Subject: What tools to own?
Date: Thu, 10 Nov 1994 13:30:00 -0600 (CST)

I have a '71 bus that is going to have some serious work done to it 
sometime in the next year.  I know that tools have been discussed here
in the past but I was thinking about a little more comprehensive list.
At a minimum I am going to work on the brakes and suspension and then,
as money allows, I will pull the engine and either rebuild or replace 
it.  I do have a pretty basic set of tools including a compression 
checker, tach/dwell meter.  So, help me to fill in the rest.

1)  Tools you cannot live without.


2)  Tools that would make most jobs easier but you can get the job 
done without them.


I know that Muir has a list of tools but a few other personal 
experiences would be a nice addition.  If you like you could mail the 
list to me and I could compile and repost.  This is going to VintageVW
and the Vanagon list so sorry in advance to those who get both.  
Thanks, Jim
