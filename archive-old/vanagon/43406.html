&gt;does any know what size socket is needed to take off that

&gt;but they are all too small.

36mm Socket is required to break loose that nut.  Also fits yer flywheel
gland nut, so it's a good idea to obtain a good, quality socket.  1/2&quot; drive
is OK, but I prefer a sturdier 3/4 inch drive socket.

&gt;When I bought the new generator the leads that the wires connect to are
posts
&gt;and the old generator has pushdown clips.. any ideas or problems with 
&gt;changing the wires, or do I have the wrong generator?

VW and Bosch supplied them both ways from 67 to about 70.  When buying a
GR15X (Bosch Rebuilt), you usually get the two post variety, but they include
the pushon tabs that mount on the posts to replace the pushon models.  If ya
bought an independently rebuilt generator, chances are they didn't include
these pushon tabs, so yer stuck unless the FLAPS can help ya by getting
either the tabs or having the rebuilder supply you with the identical
generator.  Not too many of the pushon variety were made, so I imagine the
cores are scarce.
