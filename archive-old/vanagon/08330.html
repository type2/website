Subject: galley plugs
Date: Fri, 16 Dec 94 23:08:04 EST

Crusing rec.autos.vw, there was a message about how the oil galley plugs would
-- pop out of someone's 82 vanagon during a cold start. Someone mentioned
this might be due to hot/cold cycles and/or overheating. So fill me in, I
have never heard of these plugs. Where are they? What do they look like?
and what happens if they pop out? Any experiences/information would be
helpful...TIA - DC
