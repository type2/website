Well, I wave to everyone and I usually get a wave back.  However, there   
is this lady in my neighborhood who doesn't wave at me at all!  She has a   
Non-round headlight blue Vanagon.  Nice looking.  And the van too!

Yeah, what's the deal... when I drove my 70 westy I always received and
gave polite greetings to other VWs, but I've noticed that I just get
funny looks now in my 86 GL.

I really believe VW drivers are special people, I'm including myself of
course ;-).
