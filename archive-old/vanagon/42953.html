Subject: fuel line leak, '87 Syncro GL



Chris Wyatt in Fairbanks here.  Have you any experience with a leaky 
connection in a fuel line, where the line crosses the top front of the 
engine before plunging into it and ending in a tee?  Two lines of the 
same diameter meet at a tube shoved in the ends, with a clamp on either 
side of the junction.  It looks damp, and when I tweak it it squirts 
fuel.  

I have not found similar clamps (very narrow, with an unusual crimping) 
at the dealer or elsewhere.

Do you think the fuel lines are bad?  The connector pipe split?  New 
clamps needed?  I haven't disassembled it yet, as the clamps on it don't 
seem to be reuseable.

Thanks,
