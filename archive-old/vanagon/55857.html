&gt;This idea is tremendously intriguing, but 2-1/2 mos. is a long time to board

My guess is that bringing a dog would be difficult, but not impossible.
I'm similarly interested in hauling along my parrot, Spaulding.  For a
parrot, there is international paperwork involved.  Dogs might be easier,
but I would contact the embassy in each traversed country to check their
rules, and keep all paperwork that they send you (especially stuff with
official-looking letterheads) so that you can show it to border crossing
guards.

I think that any quarantine period of more than a day would be prohibitive.
 You might look for a friendly relative with a big yard.
