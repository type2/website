&gt; by that time, i will have completed my engine swappage experience.

           2.8L Chevy.....

        Warning!   About 2 years ago there was a guy named Steve Maher
        that had that setup. He found the hard way that the 2.8 has
        a dynamicly balanced crank/flywheel. Are you familier with
        this headack?!!!!
