Subject: Cool VW split-screen Bus sticker

I found a cool sticker at Fisherman's Wharf this weekend.  I scanned it 
and put it up at 
ftp://ftp_dot_netcom_dot_com/pub/br/bradleym/VW/bus.jpg
It was $3.50, but I'm sure it would be cheaper anywhere else.  
It's a bunch of split-screen Buses driving around a VW formed with 
bones.  I'm not a Greatful Dead fan... so I didn't want any VW stickers 
with the skull thing (as much as I like skulls).  :)
