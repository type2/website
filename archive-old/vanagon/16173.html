Subject: Re: new trip proposal!

Not that I'm going to be able to make it, but I thought I'd throw in my 
$0.02...

Martha/David/others: if you don't have a copy already, I'd highly suggest 
getting Carl Franz's &quot;The people's guide to RV camping in Mexico&quot; (John 
Muir Publications, mine is 1989), the same gut you wrote &quot;The people's 
guide to Mexico&quot; another very useful book.  Also, I found the AAA of 
Southern CA fold-out map of Baja California very useful, with good detail 
for bumping around in the back-country, provided you still have (and use) 
your compass, odometer, and caution.

Wouldn't summer/early fall be real hot?

If you want a longer trip, I can't say enough nice things about the 
beaches just N of Pichilingue (which is where the Ferry to the mainland 
leaves near La Paz).  It's about 3 day's drive from San Diego (922km, 
1483mi), but has FREE camping ON THE BEACH, and Mario and his wife Secora 
run a little restaurant out on the old greyhound bus they live in right 
on the beach.  Mario rows out every morning to catch what he serves for 
that night's dinner.  No services, but hey, you're right on a white sandy 
beach with turquoise/emerald water (Sorry Thom, no surf on the Gulf of 
California), and palapas provided to sit under/hang up wash from.  La Paz 
is only 20 min drive away.  Lots of other dirt roads leading to more 
secluded beaches, too!  To get there: head N from La Paz towards the 
Pichiligue ferry terminal, pass by it, and follow signs to Playa Tecolote 
(just bear right at every paved intersection).  Just 50m before the road 
ends at the beach, take the dirt road to the right.  More secluded places 
are further to the N and E, and I'd bet you could even make it to Punta 
Coyote (another 3-4 km) with determination.

Guadalupe hot Springs sounds _real_ nice, and would be fun to get to 
(maybe David could put ANOTHER martha video on the web alla. Red Rock?  
=:O  :-)  )
Not that it really matters, I guess, but $20.00/night for 2 vehicles 
sounds pretty high for Mexico (but 'hot tub' isn't exactly a household 
word in Mexico...)

La Bufadora, as David mentioned, is kinda neat.  We stayed at a real nice 
site with no facilities whatsoever, BUT A VIEW TO KILL FOR, for 3 pesos a 
night.  Yep, that's under a US buck (depending on the exchange, could be 
&lt;$0.50!) a night.  Difficult (impossible?) access to the beach, and no door 
on the latrine, but the latrine does face out to the Pacific from the top 
of a cliff, and that's pretty cool as far as I'm concerned.  Steep dirt 
road access to the site from the main road.  We stayed at Campo #8, on 
yer right, a few km west of Punta Banda.  Punta Banda is located about 7 
km west of Maneadero on state hwy 23.  The turn off wasn't that well 
marked, but it is the only paved road intersecting Mex 1 from the right 
near Maneadero.  Maneadero is only about 10 - 12 km S of Ensenada, so 
this might be a good staging point for a multi-day trip.  Lots of cool 
villages/beaches are accessible by dirt track/road starting another 125 or 
so km S of here, running from Colonet to El Rosario; along this stretch, 
the ocean is usually within a few kms of the main hwy, so it's perfect 
for exploring &quot;off-pavement&quot; until you find something just right.

Unless time is a real important factor, I'd suggest staying off the toll 
(Cuota) roads at take the &quot;Libre&quot; routes instead.  The toll roads are 
smooth, fast, and have light traffic, but can't match to &quot;real Mexico&quot; 
feel, fun, and obstacle-course excitement of the Libre roads.  The 
section through the hills just N of Ensenada is quite beautiful, and a 
nice intro to the country.  

I'm sure it'll be fun wherever you go!
