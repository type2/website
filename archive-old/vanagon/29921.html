&gt;I saw a silver Syncro ('87) in the used car lot at Burnsville VW on Monday
&gt;and stopped to ask about it.  They couldn't tell me much though.  It seems
&gt;that when they came to work one morning last week someone had left it in in
&gt;the lot!  They've tried to contact the owner, but can't.
&gt;
&gt;But anyway, when I was looking at it I saw the gas filler at the back where
&gt;it supposed to be on a Syncro and another in the front as on a non-Syncro.
&gt; Was this an option?  Or did the owner do some modifications?  This would be
&gt;great for long trips!  Wouldn't want to pay for the fill-ups though:-).

&gt;Later!

Well, Joel asked me to go back and do &quot;some more investigating&quot;, so I did.
 It no longer is in the used car lot, it's behind their shop but I stopped to
look anyway.  This does not have a front tank.  The filler in the front goes
to a &quot;side-saddle&quot; tank set.  There is a tank that is between the frame rail
and the side on each side with a plastic tube about an inch in diameter going
from one to the other.  It looks like a professional job. Very neatly done.
 I would likie to get a hold of the owner to find out how it was done and by
who.
