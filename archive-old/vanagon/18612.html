Subject: Cal Smog (arrghh!)

Well after going through major bodywork on my 73 SuperBug I turned my 
attention back to my 72 Westy.
New exh, rebuilt carbs, Pain in the *** to get duals tune but finally 
prevailed. Had to wait three days on an appointment to get it smogged.
Well It Passed the emissions test and then the Mechanic said I was 
missing some of my smog equip. Dumfounded I replied to him &quot;what 
equipment, all I know of them having to have is the Oil breather, evap 
cannister, and all the PCV stuff&quot;. He informed me that according to the 
Ca. manual that it needs a smog pump and an EGR valve.  I took all I had 
to talk civilized at this point.  A mechanic next to us said WHAT, They 
didn't put that stuff on till 74....  
So now I have to get an appointment at a referee just so he can exempt 
the stuff on my westy that was never there to begin with..

I noticed that the book also said 73's have the same requirements. I dont 
know of any vehicles that had smog pumps in these years looks like 
whoever wrote the Smog manual Just put in what they felt like...
Which makes it impossible to pass the Visual insp.

Anyone else had  a familiar experience... The Manual looked fairly new so 
beware on your next sniff ck.
