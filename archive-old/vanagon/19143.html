&gt;   Are these reserve valves easy to come by? If the valve is mounted on the 
&gt;   tank, all the flexible hose in the whole system could be changed without
&gt;   draining the tank! I like this idea.

&gt; They should be.  All the pre-gas guage busses have them.  This thing goes
&gt; in where the little fuel tap (that screws onto the bottom of the tank) goes.

Are we sure about this, how about on bays?, seems the two taps
on my injected '76 were welded/braded in the tank, as were on
a carbed '74 parts Bus I had (only 1 tap though).  I have not
looked at my '71, have been avoiding the fuel lines (a stupid
idea admittedly) but really like the reserve valve idea if it
will work.
