Subject: JT's Magic Bus Update Part Deux!

Thanks to all of those who have given me a hand with my '66 MicroBus!  

Because of all the original specifications I was able to find out about 
the Bus and all of the support it received last night when I pulled into 
the Twin Cities VW meeting with it last night, I have decided to restore 
it back to the condition it was in when it drove off the ship back in 1966.

Thus, I need some more help figuring out a few last details about the Bus.

M Codes 430 and 025 remain a mystery, I cannot find these anywhere?

Bench seats for the back, what did the '66 Micros have and where might I 
be able to find some?  Maybe one if the above M Codes will help in this?

Thanks again!  Look for a Tizianrot/Beigegrau Bus driving down the road 
real soon! :-)
