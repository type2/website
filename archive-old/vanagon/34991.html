Subject: Visa charges, JCW catalogs

	I got a JCW catalog too- I figure everyone who subscribes to DB&amp;HWV
got hit...

	I've never heard of Visa or AmEx or MasterCard charging more than
3%, not 6%, for a transaction. Sometimes I buy things via mail order
where I send a check and they ship the goods when the check clears,
so it is possible to shop long distance w/o a charge card. But the
person who quotes $75 and then 'remembers' $100 and negotiates down
to $85 is either bullheaded and wrong OR a shmoe of the lowest stripe.
	HOWEVER, don't be hasty to attribute to knavery what can be
adequately explained by stupidity. The $85 price could be the work
of someone who doesn't know what they said, and the claim of 6% Visa
charge a clumsy attempt to cover it up.
	Fool or knave? I don't know but I agree that not doing business
with them makes a lot of sense!

	Bill
