&gt; tossing a cigarette my way...)?  Do the propane fill places have the
&gt; capability to recover propane from a tank?  If anyone can give me
&gt; specific directions as to how to go about rebuilding this valve (I'm
&gt; having a very hard time visualizing it as I've never done anything like
&gt; this before) I'd really appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Sean

   First try to tighten up any hex nut at the base of the valve.
   Don't over tighten!

   This maybe all you need to do in order to use up what's in the
   tank. If that doesn't work vent the propane into the air, in an 
   opened area. Here in PGH&gt; PA, the filling stations have on way
   of recovering it! WE vent a lot of leaky tank in the air.
