&gt;&gt;Hey all,
&gt;&gt;        Just curious, but about how much does a compression tester cost?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        Mine was around $20 at FLAPS. Cheap one won't run you much more
&gt;than that. I figure that as little as I use it, the cheap model should last
&gt;as long as I do.
&gt;
&gt;

I recomend buying a good one that can be screwed into the spark plug holes.
 Milton makes a very nice unit that sells for about $50.00.  If you own a
VAnagon and have access toa compressor, I suggest that you use this money
towards a Lek Down tester, ($70.00).  This will also tell you if you have an
internal engine leak.  Very common on these vehicles and often difficult to
diagnose.  Compression tester will onot detect this until vehicle not really
driveable.
