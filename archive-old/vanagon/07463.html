&gt; &gt; Does anyone out there know the details of the GATT bill and if it will
&gt;        ^^^^^^           ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^^
&gt; I would venture that even the pinheads on capitol hill who voted for us on
&gt; this trade agreement are aware of the the details.
                       ^^^^^^^^^

Would you believe I meant to type &quot;are not aware&quot;?
