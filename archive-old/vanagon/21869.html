To All:

The purpose of replacing the oil cooler when you rebuild the engine is to get
rid of the metal particles that have lodged in all those neat nooks &amp;
crannies in the cooler.

If you've got an up-right cooler you can pull the cans (ends) and boil it
out, just like a radiatior, except it is assembled by brazing rather than
soldering.  VW usta sell you a rebuilt, exchange, for only a coupla bucks.

If you've got a pancake or dog-house, the thing can't be rebuilt, nor can it
be cleaned.  We've soaked/sloshed the things for as long as two weeks using
MEK and worse, and could still identify metal particles in the drained
solvent.

If you've got a Type IV you're okay; the cooler is down-stream from the
full-flow oil filter.  Fill it with solvent, seal it up (test tube corks work
fine) allow it to sit several hours then drain the solvent into a glass
container and examine the residue for metal particles.  If none are found,
you're reasonably safe in using it.

There's a vast difference between a flake of metal wiped off the cam and a
gritty little particle that is actually pumped into the bearings.  The flakes
tend to settle around the oil screen in the sump and cause no problem;
they're the wrong shape to get into the main, rod or cam bearings..  But
pumping grit directly into a bearing shell is suicide.

If you do a proper rebuild you won't have to fool with your engine for twenty
years, more if you've installed a full-flow oil filter and hydraulic lifters.
 A new or rebuilt oil cooler is cheap insurance.

If you've got the upright style you may as well consider changing over to the
dog-house AND installing a full-flow oil filter.  The dog-house cooler is
about four times as efficient as the upright and with a full-flow oil filter,
either the real thing or a bolt-on filter/pump adaptor, you've just doubled
the life of your engine.  Two engines for the price of one mades damn good
sense to me.
