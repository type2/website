Subject: Re: VW-Vanagon Mailing List Split? [F]


Yep, got to agree with old (or is it NEWbie) Nick here on this one..

I have a Eurovan, a white, 1993 MV with ABS, non-powered windows,
A/C, without a pop top....

I really don't give a rat's ass about:

Hearing about Thom's 1956 restoration...

So-called amusing anecdotes about bricks, loaves, or splitties...

Those damned westcoast gettogethers...

Joel's lists...

Joel's poetry...

Joel's songs...

Hell, anything by Joel...

Next year's trip to Alaska...

BBTA...and this year's transporter trek....

ANYTHING that does not have to do with my EuroVan...

Screw camaraderie, a sense of community, I'm just damned sick and tired
of being on a list that has very little to do with White EuroVan MVs
with ABS,AC and no poptop or power windows.

So therefore I am going to set up my own mailing list:

EVMV_at_sniveling.little.git

This list has the following rules:

1. Owners of White, EV MVs with ABS, A/C, and non-power windows and
no pop-tops.

2. Conversation will only deal with the technical aspects of #1 above

3. When in doubt, refer to rules 1 &amp; 2 interalia.

PS. Why do I get the idea that I'll only be talking to myself?? Is this
going to be like internet autoerotica?  ;-)
