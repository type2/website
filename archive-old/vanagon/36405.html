&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Is there such a bus as a 59 Crew Cab Kombi?  Does anyone know?  It's what I 
&gt; want.  Do you know how much one should cost  I'm about done restoring a 72 
&gt; Type I convertible, and have rebuilt my 68 1600 engine and transmission so a 
&gt; restoration project would be fine.  Any information would be helpful.

You betcha!  Although it might seem like a 'Kombi' with its standard 
issue interior and lack of chrome it's usually referred to as a Double 
Cab or Crew Cab.  Sort of a utilitarian vehicle.  They run anywhere from 
a several hundred dollars to beyond $10,000, depending on condition. As for 
any Vintage VW task, joining the VVWCA is helpful.  Let me know if you 
are interested.  (blatant plug for the VVWCA)  8-)
