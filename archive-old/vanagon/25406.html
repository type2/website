Subject: Fridge fan times three

Okay-- so i'm obsessing on fridge performance... in a previous life i 
used to inspect restaurants and now i just gotta keep my food cold. 
:)

In addition to the original condensor fan and the add-on evaporator fan, 
i've now added a third fan in the vertical vent on the left side of 
the fridge cabinet.  it is wired so that the original condensor fan 
still operates thermostatically but with the flick of a switch the 
fridge cabinet fan AND the original fan come on.  

i think a key to getting better performance from our wimpy 
Dometics is removing heat from the condensor area.  adding extra 
insulation would be wonderful but nearly impossible.  with both 
condensor fans running i can feel a draft pulling air from the bottum 
fridge vents, just under the door... i'm excited to test it out, 
however, i fear our warm weather is done for the year.

2 negatives with this installation are noise and current draw.  the 
muffin fan i added to the cabinet moves alot of air but is also loud. 
 add to that the noisy original fan and it becomes almost obnoxious.  
however, if i run it during the hot part of the day, we're usually 
outside the van anyway.  at night, it is usually cool enough that the 
temps stay down fine without fans on.

current draw:
original condensor fan   ~350 ma (measured)
cabinet fan                           215 ma (rated and measured)
interior evap fan                   70 ma (rated 60, measured 70)

total current draw-- around 650 ma, about 8 watts...

how long will this run on a regular battery with enough power left to 
start ?   :)
