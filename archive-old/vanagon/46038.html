&gt;Also, has anyone ever
&gt;seen a Bosch &quot;019&quot; distributor or know what it's for?

The 0231-129-019 is the Bosch factory replacement for the &quot;010&quot;
(0231-129-010) Distributor used originally on 56-59 Buses and was the basis
for the first &quot;Screamer&quot; performance distributors Bosch marketed.  It was
replaced by the &quot;009&quot; Distributor in the late 70's.  A nice find if it's in
good shape.
