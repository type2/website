Marvin,

I have installed 3 pair of Yakima artificial rain gutters and have three
Thule cross bars on my roof.  So far it works ok.  I've carried up to fou=
r
bikes on the rear two bars without a problem.  The Yakima rain gutters
require less mounting space thant the Thule's, thats why I used them.

enjoy,
Christopher Quijano
