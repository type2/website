Subject: Re: Cargo Hauls

Back in 1982 I had a perfect 1968 Single cab. I was in the process of doing
the landscape for the &quot;first house.&quot; The neighborhood was one of those way
out in the middle of Egypt situations. It's right in the middle of town now!

I used the '68 Single to haul full pallets of Superlight brand bricks. Not
as dense as regular clay brick but still pretty heavy. The pallets would
slam the truck to the ground but it made about four trips. I definitey would
not do that to the truck if I still owned it. The guys at the rock and
gravel yard were amazed at how much the single could carry.

BTW: I had to sell the truck because we didn't have the extra $25 a month to
insure it!! It took two months of solid advertising to get anyone to give
$2000. for it. The truck was so complete and straight that the only thing
that it needed was a seat cover for the front bench!! It was due to Ronald
Reagan's first term &quot;Trickle Down&quot; stupidness that caused all construction
and misc spending to come to a screaming stop between '80-'83. No one was
buying anything. DOH~!
