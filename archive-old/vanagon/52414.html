      AIR BAGS .... THIS PISSES ME OFF!

  If it wasn't for people who don't where there seat belts, we
  wouldn't have all this expensive trash in cars! 

  Next it's ABS brakes, another real expensive bunch of crap in cars
  because people can't drive. 

  I can't wait for time to go by and the stupid public has to pay
  $1200 to get there ABS system fixed. 

  Don't we remember 10MPH front bumpers, or no start interlocks
  on the seat belts? The price of these were only 1/3 of the cost
  of this new crap. AND THINK, (I no it hard), IT's all because
  of peoples inability.

  Sorry, I'm just sick of fixing everything that other people Broke.
