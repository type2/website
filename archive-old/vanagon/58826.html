Don't paint it, dye it!  I bought something at my local vdub dealer called
&quot;Forever Black&quot;, which is like shoe polish for bumpers and trim.  It did a
wonderful job on the bumper and air dam.  (6 months later, the dam is
starting to get faded again, but the bumper still looks wonderfully black!)
