&gt; 
&gt; Also true that '57 did not come with a gas guage?  (The fellow I 
&gt; purchased it from had one added.) 

True indeed, gas guages were only standard in '62, I think. Before that,
they were only in Ambulances (for obvious reasons) Before guages, there
was a 1 gallon or so emergency reserve tank. when your main tank ran
out, you just flipped a switch to go to the reserve tank, and then got
gas really soon...
