&gt; Did you pay Colorado sales tax when you originally purchased the vehicle ?
&gt; I know I paid sales tax to Nebraska when I purchased my VW in Nebraska,

&gt; registering the VW here. What's the scoop with California making me pay a
&gt; &quot;sales&quot; tax when I didn't purchase it ? It's illegal to sell a vehicle and
&gt; not pay sales tax, so why isn't it illegal for the state to charge me a
&gt; sales tax when a sale did not occur ?

I don't know what the left coast state does but here on the right coast 
and in Virginia and Maryland I believe you pay the difference between the 
sales tax in the purchased in state and the new state.  Well okay they 
don't re-imburse you if you &quot;over paid&quot; but if the tax is lower in your 
old state you pay partial in Virginia

&gt; 
&gt; They are already milking me for $300 (&quot;pollution&quot; import fee),
&gt; regardless of the fact that they may or may not allow me to
&gt; register my VW.
