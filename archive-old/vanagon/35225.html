Subject: Rebuilt Heads in the NW
Date: Tue, 13 Feb 96 11:23:00 PST


Proud to say that I have dropped my engine and have it in pieces in the 
basement.  I am sure that I will die down there as an old man with the same 
dismantled engine sitting in front of me.

Anywho, before I get to carried away, does anyone know of a good place in 
Portland/Seattle/Great NW area to purchase rebuilt heads?  I really wouldn't 
know where to begin.  Also, what's a good price for a set of rebuilds with 
trade in?  This is a 2.0L Aircooled engine.

It has a bad valve, should l just fix that, or do the whole deal now that it 
is out?

Thanks,
Ernest

And no, this post was not about  Wharf Rats.
