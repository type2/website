Subject:       Re: good FI books?


&gt; So, who has recommendations for a Bosch FI book that includes how-tos and
&gt; whys and assumes that I don't have much more than a test light and a digital
&gt; multimeter?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;

There's a fantastic FI book out there, I think the title is   &quot;Fuel 
Injection Management&quot;  by Charles Probst.  Highly reccomended!

Here's a simpler possible fix:  Take your distributor cap off and 
clean the inside out with carb cleaner, then blow dry with compressed 
air (ok, use a rag).  I've had gremlins hide under the cap after 
washing my engine --  ran the same way you describe   Good Luck
