Eugene,

Noticed in your post that you have some Kadrons for sale with both
single-port and dual-port manifolds. I have some Kadrons also, with
dual-port manifolds. But my '71 bus has a single-port 1600 engine,
which seems to run very strong with its Solex 30PICT-3 carb. I want
to put the Kadrons on it. I, too, have heard that single-port engines
tend to be tougher than dual-port, whose heads tend to develop cracks
from the spark plug hole to the intake ports when stressed.

Can I offer you a swap? my dual-port manifolds for your singles?
Or, if you don't need a second pair of duals, would you consider 
selling the singles to me? Don't know what demand there is for the
single-port manifolds. How about $10/both, plus I pay shipping (I
am in San Diego)?

Let me know if you are interested. I can't make it to Vallejo, I'm
afraid. But maybe we can both give UPS some business.
