Subject: Been To VW Heaven

    Today I spent the afternoon at Donald's. Donald used to work for a
Vokswagen dealership from '66 to '76, and then opened up his own, private VW
repair business out of his home. From day 1, he scooped up dead, dying and
ailing VW's of all type and creed, and brought them home to his little swatch
of land where he tinkered and toiled to bring them life. He works for the
phone company now; it pays a lot more, and gave up the business, but holds
tight to his loving collection of rows upon rows of resting VW's. You can
point to any one and he'll spin off the story of how it came to him. He'll
chuckle quietly to himself while he lets you stagger around in glorified awe
of his sea of Buses and Campers, and Bugs, and Karman Ghias, and Things, and
Super Beetles, and Crew Cabs, and Dune Buggies. I brought my '71 Camper, and
he hunkered down to check her out. He crouched there and listened. He grunted
and called every part he tinkered with a &quot;rascal&quot;. He doesn't &quot;fix&quot; VW's; he
&quot;takes a session&quot; with them. He got my brake lights to work after three other
mechanics were left scratching their heads. He installed a missing piece in
my carbuerator. He banged out two dents. He invited me into his home and made
me coffee. He refused payment under the premise that it had been fun for him.
He gave me the addresses of several different Bus Clubs in my area (LiMBO and
NEAT), and told me Volkswagen stories and showed me books and original
articles and ads for over 3 hours. He fixed my Camper, gave me coffee, and
told me things I'd never hear from anyone other than a seasoned lover of
Volkswagens. Today my faith in humankind was partially restored. Today, just
being a good person was better than being a rich one. It has always been my
personal code to be kind and caring and helpful whenever possible, and 9
times out of ten, it doesn't pay off, but today, what went around came
around, and my faith is rejuevenated and full with the purpose that was
fading: to smile, and lend a hand when someone is reaching out. A warm toast
to Donald, if you will, and a sincere wish that each of you bear in mind the
words of John Muir who said: &quot; You don't have to think, but you must love.&quot;
