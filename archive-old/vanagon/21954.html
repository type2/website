Subject: Rust removal and corrosion. (Long)

Hey Yaaalll!

Ive been monkeying around with the muffler on the '71 Bus the
last couple of days, and I have some questions. (Of course)

First, I cannot get the passenger side heat exchanger off. The front 
two nuts are rusted onto the studs, and resist all efforts to
romove them. I even tried cutting into them with a hacksaw blade,
but to no avail. I got most of one off this way, but the other
one is too far up there to get at. I cant fit my nut splitter
around it, as the exaust pipe is right there. I dont want to have to drop the
engine to get at the nut, but I might. Any suggestions? (Man, those
8 copper nuts should make this job easier the next time.)

Second, I want to remove all the rust ffrom the heat exchanger
I did get off. It is solid all over, but quite rusty all over the surface.
I have some naval jelly. Will this work around paint? Rust under paint,
resisting the wire brush, but under there. Where can I find bulk phosphoric
acid? The home store has bulk muiratic acid, but this is too strong,
right?

Third, does this POR stuff handle heats that the heat exchanger sees. I
seem to remember that it is limited to 300 F, right? I guess I will
just be using Rustoleum BBQ paint (On sale for US$1.99 a can!) I would
like to paint it silver, but I have never had a high temp silver
paint hold up like that BBQ paint.

Should I spray a little of that BBQ paint INSIDE the air pipes to the 
heat exchanger? After it cures, it should not be toxic, right? Right?

I pressure tested the exaust pipe like this. Fill a baloon with air and
spread the end over the flange on one end. Do the same on the other 
end. If both still have theier air in five minutes, the exaust
pipe is not leaking into the heater air. (It Worries me.)

Also, Ill be putting on a header that a friend gave me. My question
is: How do you route the heater air around the header pipes? I see
two options: Just pip the flex pipe from the fan to the heater box intakes.
Second, remove the bypass boxes from the original muffler (good shape)
and put them on the header. What have yall done?

Oh well, enough for now.
