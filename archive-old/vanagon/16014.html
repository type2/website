Subject: Summers here!

The GF and I took the Bus for a quick drive last night. We took
the old girl, Vroomhilde, downtown for a little dinner and
some people watching. (Not cruising, but with the traffic,
if might as well have been)Weather was warm, and it was just getting 
dark.

She perked right up, and ran like a dream. Got lots of friendly
smiles and waves, and even an escort by a couple of 
guys on antique Harleys for about three blocks. For oonce,
nobody noticed my engine noise!

Gad, I love the feel of leaning back with my arm on the window
sill. I have never driven in a car that is as matched to
my personal geometry (mental and physical) as me and Vroomie.
