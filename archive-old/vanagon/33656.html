Hmm.  Bet that plug is a Champion.  or an Autolite.  Best bet is to leave
it in if it is not fouled.  Once it is out it isn't going back in without
having the threads in the heat fixed.

&gt;Put my wrench on the #2 plug, and that sucker did NOT want to come out.
&gt;By putting all the torque on it I could in that cramped engine compartment,
&gt;I could get it to turn ssslllooooowwwlllyyyy, fighting me every inch of
&gt;the way. Yes, I AM turning it in the right direction.
