Subject: Choices on Heat: Real and Imagined
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 94 7:58:48 EST

All this talk of catalytic heaters, the lack of heat in air-cooled
Vanagons, the impending cold winter and the need for making this a better
world, got me thinking about the possible choices of heat available and
their practical application in air-cooled Vnagaon busses. Here are some ideas:

Requirements: 
a) must be able to fit into the vent system for proper defrosting of
windows and interior heat;

b) must augment rather than replace the existing heater system;

c) must not cost too much (more than what we payed for the van);

d) stationary heat for camping would be a bonus but not crucial;

Choices:

a) auxiliary gas heater system 
upside- works well;
downside- relatively expensive; takes away some of the gas; could be
dangerous; difficult to install;

b) electrical heater system -
upside- relatively cheap;
downside- inefficient; ineffective; may drain battery;

c) oil heater system (takes bypass oil and feeds through fan)
 upside: relatively inexpensive; no drain on efficiency;
 downside - no design yet available for Vanagons (bugs only); effects on
oil temp and engine unknown; a challenge worth exploring;

d) water cooled heater boxes -
upside - may be the most efficient and maintenance free;
downside - unknown cost and availability; installation;

e) electric fan booster -
upside - easy to install; cheap
downside - works well with existing heat will not create more heat; good
for defrosting;

f) propane driven system
upside - good for Westfalias
downside -design yet unknown  for feeding into vents (a challenge) 

g) insulation/down parka/blankets
upside - mobile
downside - cumbersome; must outfit entire family

h) move to Florida
upside - Marlin fishing
downside - may become a bubba

I am sure there other ideas or comments on these ones -  DC
