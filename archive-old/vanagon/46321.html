&gt; hotVW's has ad from &quot;California Import Parts, Ltd&quot; in either Burnaby BC,
&gt; or Blaine Washington (funny, eh?).  Header pipes listed at $140 ea., 
&gt; catalytic converters for $130, etc.  Way cheaper than VW.  Know nothing
&gt; 'bout it but from seein' the ad.
&gt; 
&gt; Canada number is 604-434-8300, US 800-313-3811

Have never bought exhaust parts from these guys, but service is good, 
and they know their stuff...
BowWow Parts in Vancouver is also another good source 604-381-4331 
(Victoria #) with knowledgable staff.
