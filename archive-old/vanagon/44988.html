Subject: Waterboxer Coolant Pipe
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Hello listers,
I'm in the process of rebuilding my engine and I noticed the large
coolant pipe from the water pump is very rusty.  Should I replace this
pipe? How much does it cost? Is something that is a dealer only item?
Any info would be appreciated.
