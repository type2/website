&gt;It seems that there is definately a real problem here with starter bendix
&gt;drives. (Someone said don't let them get cold.  I passed on that one, per
&gt;ric).  It seems that one simply can not obtain only the starter bendix ...
&gt;There must be a solution to this problem!  I mean, really, to buy a new or
&gt;rebuilt starter is not, in my opinion, a solution.  Wonder about the chances
&gt;of using the bendix designed for another vehicle?  I simply can't believe
&gt;that anyone would sincerely look at me and tell me that I can't put a bendix
&gt;on one of these motors!  It seems like vw has run amok!

check with some other sources ... like poeple who would handle the bosch
starters (not necessarily just for vw): start/alternator repair places. you
might also see if your friendly local parts idiot has any catalogs that they
would let you look at .. to see if there is a cross-reference to the starter
and/or bendix being used on other cars. also check on rec.autos.vw to see
if any of the rabbit folks can help.  speaking of rabbit folks, what about
some of the ads in European Cars magazine that specialize in rabbit parts?

good luck.
