One more thing - today was a beautiful day in sunny Western New York (we're
only allotted about 3 or 4 a year between blizzards!) and there were Loafs
EVERYWHERE!  I saw at least 5 or 6 in real nice shape and we all honked and
waved at each other like mad!  Didn't see any Splits, though.  How I love
thee, simple Bus.......

Just my feeble thoughts......

   I've been conducting an informal study on other transporter
   drivers: when I see one on the road, I wave at them (except
   Eurovans... still warming up to them). Total returned waves
   so far: zero! Even from people driving what appear to be
   IDENTICAL 76 Westys!!!! I've gotta find some friendlier
   place to live...
