Subject: Re: How do you FEEL about tires?

&gt; Now that there's an inch or two of ice on the local(Montana) roads I'm
&gt; shopping for tires. Yokohamas or Radial T/A. I drive an 87 Synchro. i
&gt; Have read so much data about the Yokos, etc, What I really want to know
&gt; is why people like the tires they've got. Thanks...... Rob

I'm still only running 2 Yoko 370s, since I have 2 other good tires 
to wear out first. I've tried them on the front, and the rear, and 
with the following other tires as comparison:

Sears SuperGuard LT - harsh, noisy, ok otherwise.
Conti TS750 - reinforced tire, max 40psi, too soft, wears fast, and 
poor stability in wind. Also bad on rough roads - cuts easily.

I currently have the sears on the rear, Yoko on the front, as they 
*excellent* steering feel and response, especially in the rain. I 
haven't had them in the snow, but I suspect they would do well. So 
far, the *only* criticism I have is they are slightly noisier than 
the Reinf. Conti tires, but much quieter than other LT tires. Given 
they are load range D, this is a minor quibble. The noise level is 
only an issue at 55mph, any faster and wind noise takes over.
In driving US1 &amp; 101 down the Wa, Or, Ca coast in April, I found them 
to be a very confidence inspiring tire, able to deal with sharp turns 
and hard breaking with no surprises.
There is NO doubt in my mind they are worth the search to find them, 
and the extra $10-20 / tire. Around here, they run about the same 
price as Michelin LTX, and Conti Reinf. tires.
