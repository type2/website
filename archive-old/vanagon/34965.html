&gt;Well, if you would get your damn agency's to quit pouring salt on

I can sympathize with people in the &quot;salt belt&quot;.  Out here in Vancouver we
usually have a whole 1 or 2 weeks every year during which there is salt on
the roads.  This year it was more like 3 WHOLE WEEKS!!!!  Good thing
winter's over eh?
