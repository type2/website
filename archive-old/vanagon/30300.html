&gt;&gt;Hi all, 
&gt;&gt;	I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while

None of your business, harumph, but I do wear Winnie the Pooh jammies.

I/we sleep with heads frontwards, from fear of having a spare tire rim print
in my face in the morning.  Plus it's narrower back there.  Up top, with my
head at the biggest end.  Tim Smith
