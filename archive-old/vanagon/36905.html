&gt;&gt;Subject:	GEX update
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     I now have 5000k on the rebuilt motor from GEX (1600SP) and 
&gt;#4 is a 
&gt;&gt;     low 105 PSI.  Motor is HARD to start, cuts out while running, 
&gt;runs 
&gt;&gt;     rough, blah, blah.  So, I called GEX on friday and explained 
&gt;that
&gt;&gt; this 
&gt;&gt;     head was cracked around #4 valve guide when I got it but on 
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; advice 
&gt;&gt;     of GEX at that time and my own impatience at getting the bus 
&gt;('66 
&gt;&gt;     standard/camper) on the road so I could put my Moto Guzzi 
&gt;down for 
&gt;&gt;     extensive repair, I put it together and crossed my fingers.  
&gt;Stupid!!
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;     Before installing I photographed the cracked case and sent 
&gt;pics to
&gt;&gt; GEX 
&gt;&gt;     with a cover letter.  
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     Ok so here we are 5000k later and the motor comes out again 
&gt;(I'm 
&gt;&gt;     getting good at this!).  I'll pull the head tonight and 
&gt;inspect and 
&gt;&gt;     send back to GEX regardless, due to the crack.  I'll also be 
&gt;looking 
&gt;&gt;     at rings, etc.  My hope is that I can get a decent head this 
&gt;time and 
&gt;&gt;     that I won't have to mess with htis again for a long time.  
&gt;While I'm 
&gt;&gt;     waiting I need to replace seals in the tranny and rebuild the 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     starter/solenoid.  Stay tuned for the story on how GEX 
&gt;handles the 
&gt;&gt;     problem.
&gt;&gt;     Ray
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Had really bad luck with GEX myself.  Bought a 2.0L type 4 motor.  
&gt;Paid more than from some other advertisers because of GEX's 
&gt;reputation.  Motor had strange noise (knock) from day one. Warranty 
&gt;was supposed to cover replacement plus labor (reimbursed to my 
&gt;local repair shop).  Called GEX immediately, they said &quot;send it 
&gt;back and we'll decide if it's warranty.&quot;  I said &quot;of course it's 
&gt;warranty - it's brand new!&quot;  They said that it might not be covered 
&gt;if they decide that it overheated due to improper installation.  
&gt;Had to take VW to two other shops and get in writing that engine 
&gt;was installed and adjusted properly, and that it did have a strange 
&gt;noise, before GEX agreed that they would PROBABLY replace.  Even 
&gt;then, lots of hedging, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Then came the question of - if I send the motor back (2 weeks from 
&gt;east coast) and they then send me a new motor (2 more weeks), what 
&gt;do I drive for a month?  My bus is my daily driver.  Offered to pay 
&gt;in advance for 2nd motor, then get credited once first one was 
&gt;returned.  They agreed.  (Why not?!)
&gt;
&gt;Took two weeks to get them to send replacement motor - kept 
&gt;&quot;forgetting&quot; to ship it, even after they had billed my credit card. 
&gt;Finally spoke to shipping guy, who said warranty guy had never even 
&gt;given him paperwork to ship it (even after assuring me it had 
&gt;already shipped!!).  He agreed to ship motor - but charged my 
&gt;credit card for the same motor a 2nd time when he shipped it!
&gt;
&gt;When GEX finally got the bad motor back, they tried to refuse to 
&gt;warranty it (&quot;overheated&quot;). If I hadn't gotten those 2 shops, plus 
&gt;the original installation shop, to put in writing that the engine 
&gt;was installed by the book, with factory parts, and bad from day 
&gt;one, GEX would have refused to warranty it at all!!  Then it took 
&gt;me almost a month to get them to correct the double charge on my 
&gt;credit card, and credit me for the first motor. It took a call to 
&gt;the President of GEX, and the intervention of American Express 
&gt;(who, in my support, withheld payment to GEX), before they finally 
&gt;credited my account - a month later.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and the labor they reimbursed only covered about 2/3 of the 
&gt;charge for replacing my motor, so after a month of waiting and 
&gt;literally 15 or 20 calls to GEX, the whole ordeal still cost me 
&gt;about $150.
&gt;
&gt;A month later, my transaxle went.  Taking the GEX president at his 
&gt;word that my ordeal was highly unusual, I made the stupid mistake 
&gt;of ordering a new transaxle from GEX.  Shop put it in - it was bad 
&gt;right away, just like the motor.  LOUD hum in 1st &amp; 2nd.  I then 
&gt;learned the hard way that even though the trans was dead out of the 
&gt;box, GEX does not cover labor reimbursement on transaxles.  After 
&gt;talking to the president again, and only because of my long story 
&gt;of woe with GEX, they agreed to cover $100 of my $180 bill for R&amp;R 
&gt;of the defective trans.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if my experience with GEX is typical, but I got 2 bad 
&gt;products out of 2, and trying to deal with them for warranty was 
&gt;the biggest red-tape/beaurocracy hell I've ever experienced.  
&gt;Personally, I will never purchase anything from GEX again!
