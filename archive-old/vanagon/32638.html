Subject: RE: ROUND GIZMO TO LEFT OF HEATER CONTROL


&gt;OK, I'LL BITE AGAIN SINCE NO ONE ANSWERED WHAT THE SMALL ROUND GIZMO ON THE
&gt;VANAGON DASH IS. THE MANUAL PICTURES IT BUT DOESN'T ID IT. WHAT IS IT?
&gt;
&gt;AS AN ASIDE, IS IT PART OF THE VW  MYSTIQUE THAT APPARENTLY PEOPLE CAN OWN
&gt;THESE THINGS FOR LIFETIMES AND STILL NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT HOW THE HEATER
&gt;CONTROLS WORK?


Uh... in my '80 V6anagon, the round gizmo to the left of the heater
control, is called a &quot;steering wheel&quot;.

Do you really know someone who has driven for a lifetime and doesn't
know what this gizmo does? Please introduce him/her/it to the list...
perhaps we can help, before it's too late.

     :^)

Happy Friday, all...
