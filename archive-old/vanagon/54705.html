&gt; does this realy need to be done?  I'm a bit worried about taking a cylinder
&gt; with a nice smooth bore and screwing it up with a hone.

I'm not a professional mechanic, and this is free advice (maybe worth 
every penny) but over the years I've rebuilt several different hydraulic 
cylinders with smooth bores, such as you describe, and I've never had a 
problem with any of them.
