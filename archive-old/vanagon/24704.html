Subject: alaska/inuvik trip



Does anyone want to guess what the gas for this trip is gonna cost?  Let's
say (to make things easy for *ME* from near the San Francisco area).  Let's
take paramaters like:

getting not very good gas mileage
having to pay high rates for gas, especially outside the US, with the exchange
     and with the gas price monopoly which must exist on the legs of the
     trip where gas is not very often available

---

Does anyone want to suggest how much money to save ahead for food?  I
realize that this might seem obvious (just figure out what you spend
now), but eating in the camper on the road can cost quite a bit
different than eating at home.  Let's assume just sort of &quot;average&quot; tastes
and spending habits, like not eating out more than once a week, not eating
beef wellington and lobster tails for dinner, and so forth  :)

Thanks -
