Subject: 84 Vanagon GL Update &amp; VW Tool ?

Hi VW Lusters (oops) Listers,

A month or two ago I mentioned and questioned about my 84 Vanagon GL I 
recently bought with 091/1 4-speed tranny woes.  Here's what I found:

The pilot brg was bad and ruined the pilot shaft and screwed up the oil seal.

The problem is that the PO started disassembling the tranny and split the 
gearbox from the ring &amp; pinion area.  In order to replace the gasket 
between the two, I need to remove the ring &amp; pinion with the 'special' VW 
tool.  Has anyone ever bought one of these??  I don't have the tool # 
with me, but how much is this critter?  Thanks in advance,  8-)
