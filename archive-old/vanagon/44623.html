Subject: Re: '68 Westy FS (NICE)

&gt; writing in hope of getting a little moral support and encouragement, and
&gt; maybe an offer of instruction in doing right by this bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm only just getting into busses, I've had a rusty '76 westy for a year
&gt; or so, but it's totally beat and way beyond my interest or skills in
&gt; restoring.  So I don't want to buy this perfect '68 and have it ruined by
&gt; my inexpertise.  It was practically a religious experience talking with
&gt; that old couple and having them show me the bus and all the parts in
&gt; perfect condition, the tent which hasn't EVER been out of its bag...
&gt; 
&gt; I feel like I'm stealing statues from a church if I take this bus.
&gt; 
&gt; So if I pick it up, and the truckload of original parts and extras like
&gt; rotors and racks and stuff, how do I learn how do fix it up right the
&gt; first time?  I'm in Virginia just outside D.C., is there anyone in the
&gt; Baltimore/Washington area willing to provide some guidance?  I would be
&gt; interested in making it as perfect, number one show quality as I can
&gt; without spending too many thousands of dollars...

Well, lemme see...where do I start...Hmmm!  It's like this, you plan a
nice long trip North-East and you can store it at my place as long as
you like ... forever even ;-) There are lots of Buses around so it
won't get lonely....and I promise to help you take good care of
it...;-)


Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!
