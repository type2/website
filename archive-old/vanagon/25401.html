Well, it was more like 7:15... just to damn early for me.

The bus wasn't even in that bad of shape, if you don't count all the 
windows being broken out, flat tires, and the surface rust.  And it was a 
sun-roof model, but I think the gear in the crank was broken.  Kinda of a 
shame.  But I'm sure someone could get it cheap or free if they wanted it.
