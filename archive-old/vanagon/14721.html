Subject: TransAxle Goes -long- (was Transaxle Woes)

The Final Episode:

Woke up this morning motivated, perhaps it was the Jalapenos last
night, or maybe it was just the company.  In either case I got up at the
crack of Noon as Tom Waits would say (and thank you Martha I had
forgotten to set the clocks) and traipsed outside to ponder Busters
Dilemma.

For those of you who may be tuning in mid-crisis, or are perhaps still
trying to figure out my ramblings from previous posts I am/was in the
process of grafting a later model type 091 manual tranny to my semi-
old 1972 Westiephony BusToVanagain.

It was time, Jumping out of fourth gear was an understatement as it
had gotten to the point of reaching for the Bungie cord each time I 
came out of third gear. My daughter and I played games to see who
could get their bungie cord around the shifter first while driving her
to school in the morning, I would try to cheat, but she would still win
as she had my shift points memorized down to the last detail...

I actually got the tranny installed a few days ago, but bad weather and
a mild stomach flu kept me inside till Friday afternoon when I pulled
Buster off the blocks and tried to trim the shifter-plate adjustment.
I had no success, either I could get 1st and 3rd, or 2nd, 4th &amp; sometimes
reverse, but not all of them all of the time (sic.. Mr. Guthrie!).

I pondered the known physical differences `tween the 002 tranny (68-74) and
the 091 (75- ?) and the following list unofficially developed:

1. While the boltup pattern is close, the nose mount needs to be lowered
approx .025&quot; as the shift rod protrudes .025&quot; higher on the later model 091
gearshift housing. (No biggie, rear support is adjustable, while you are at
it, add a pair of 021-110-1089 damper bushings to the existing rubber mount
bracket. They came on the later model busses and tend to help dampen sound
transfer a bit more than without... all of $4.50)

2. The BellHousing on the 091 measures 4 14/16&quot; deep while the 002 is an even
5&quot;

3. The Transmission Housing dimensions are the same although the 091 uses
bolts to mount the clutch cable guide bracket while the 002 uses a pair of
short studs.

4. The Gear Carrier on the 091 measures 2 12/16&quot; deep while the 002 comes in
at 2 08/16.

5. The Gearshift Housing measurements are the same at 5 12/16

6. The ShiftRod as it protrudes from the  Gearshaft Housings extends
1 09/16 with a 1/4&quot; hole taper drilled 1 05/16 from the rear (towards
engine) of the shaft. The 091 had a tapered ShiftRod, the 002 did not.

My math sucks, but I figured 6/16 (3/8&quot;) difference between the two
trannies, the older 002 being a bit longer.

CONCLUSION:   Not a hell of a lot of difference, but perhaps enough to
restrict full travel of the front shift rod/cup and the ShiftRod linkage
ittself.

OPTIONS: 
   A) Lengthen the linkage 3/8&quot; between the shifter &amp; tranny....
   B) Attempt to swap the Bellhousing, reducing the diff to 1/4&quot;....?
   C) Chop the Bus in half &amp; remove 3/8&quot;, reweld and pray it works...
                     


I was tempted to try option B only because the other MAJOR difference
between the 091 &amp; the 002 is the starter. The depth of the starter cage is
considerably more on the 091 which left my recently purchased Bosch
spinning like a pinwheel in the breeze.  Hence the 79.98 new/rebuilt...

Option &quot;A&quot;

About 26&quot; South from where the shifter bolts down onto the buses floorboard,
and directly underneath the center of the bus is a section
of the long shifter rod that connects the shifter and the transmission.
Trace the linkage as it comes out of the linkage/cup cage and soon you
will see a coupling collar with a safety wired set screw holding the 2
pieces together.  This is our savior point. If you remove all the road grunge
from around the collar you will expose a section of shaft which
if gingerly handled can be retapped with the set screw facing straight up
into its new hole exactly 3/8&quot; South on the Southern Shaft. This done I
extricated myself from Buster's underregions ( &amp; wiped the drill bit shavings
from my left eye) and hopped in the drivers seat.

Up to neutral, Ummmfg (down) left and back...not a snick, but a nice
solid unkkkk into reverse.

I'm whooping, neighbors are shuttling their kids inside, the cats all
scattter, the wife looks at me like she's wondering if I found Diego's
Gold and all of a sudden I realize that thats just the dry run. My lips
get dry and the smell of Jalapenos fills the bus as I turn over the engine
and floor the clutch and gently slide into first.

Magik.  I'm off on a whirlwind tour of the neighborhood shifting thru
gears faster than a trucker off from a greenlight. I stop by the store and
pick up a bag of chips and a soda.. The acid test, until today I have not
been able to do anything other than bungie/unbungie and grab a quick
swig of coffee unable to let go of the shifter for more than a split second
before having to grab it again... On the road again, and I'm munching
and humming, munching and humming.

Tomorrow. without telling my daughter I fixed the tranny, I'll bet her
dishes for a week that I can guess the number of times we'll need to bungie
the bus on the way to school.... ; )
