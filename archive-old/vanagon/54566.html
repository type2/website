Sorry if this is a resend, don't know if the first one went out-The PO 
of my '84 Westy epoxied a small metal plate on the bottom of the 
luggage rack near the front for a magnetic mount.  I didn't understand 
why one listee recommended epoxying a plate to the poptop and not the 
luggage rack.  Is there something I'm not aware of, other than the 
small loss of luggage space on the luggage rack?  Reception seems to be 
fine, though I haven't had a chance to test its limits.

Scott
