Subject: Digital Clock Fix

     I gather from traffic I've seen since being on the list that the 
     digital clock on the later Vanagons have reliability problems.  Mine 
     had a broken area in the crystal, and would not set (though it seemed 
     to be keeping time in some parallel universe).
     
     Well, after much travail, I finally was able to successfully 
     disassemble the instrument cluster from a Golf to see if the modules 
     were interchangeable.  THEY ARE!
     
     So, if you're having trouble with your clock, never mind scrounging 
     the Vanagon section at your local wrecking yard.  Head over to the 
     Golf II/Jetta II aisle and start shopping there.  There's plenty!
     
     And after you install it, don't fret if it appears to be trying to 
     communicate to you in Klingon; just push the buttons to set it, and it 
     should clear up.
     
     'Course, my clock now has a green tinge when the dash lights are on, 
     but it's not at all objectionable.
