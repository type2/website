&gt; Hi All.  I was checking out my Bentley this morning trying to find
&gt; the ride height specs for my van.  Well, I went through that manual
&gt; several times, and couldn't find it.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody have these specs?  I believe the height is measured from the
&gt; centre of the wheel fender lip to the ground.  Anybody with a Syncro
&gt; Westy willing to measure their van for me?
&gt;
&gt; This will determine if my springs are indeed sagging.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a lot!

Hi: My Westy Syncro is 6'10 1/4&quot; to the top of the skylight with stock
14 inch steel wheels and Michelin MXL tires. It is easy to measure for
me since I only have 1/4&quot; clearance to get into my garage. I kind of
wish it was under 6'8&quot; so I could get it on the British Columbia ferries
at the cheap rate. I need to let air out of the tires some time and see
if I can make it and still be able to drive it onto a ferry.
