Subject: Re: Wasserboxer Leaky Heads


&gt;&quot; Dissimilar metals in contact with one another through an electrolyte.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The system creates a Galvanic cell with a discharge of electricity and
&gt;the more reactive of the metals becomes a sacrificial anode and is
&gt;eaten (corroded) away.
&gt;
&gt;The Facts?
&gt;1. The wasserboxer is ENTIRLY aluminiun alloy.
&gt;2. They all seem to have corrosion inhibitor.
&gt;     (end snip)
&gt;
&gt;Don't forget another fact. The cylinders are steel, and the corrosion 
happens
&gt;where the steel surface of the top of the cylinder touches the head, right
&gt;where
&gt;the sealing ring is.

Also the head bolts-- steel clamping down on that aluminum alloy. Uh-oh...
