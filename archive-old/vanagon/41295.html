Subject: Re: WESTY TENT POLES

&gt;Hello everyone!  I'm looking for the main poles for a 70's westfalia =
&gt;tent, the ones that support the framework.  These telescope and are =
&gt;fixed by way of setscrews.  My tent was very rarely used, yet the =
&gt;previous owner managed to wreck three of them!
&gt;
&gt;thanks
&gt;Danno

Does this mean that 70's westy's have a tent that goes off to the side?!
I've seen this in like a 61, thought it ended with the fancy pop-top...

Thanks,
Eric &amp; Maggie (a possibly very incomplete 76 westy)
