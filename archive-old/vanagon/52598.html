Subject: Propex installation questions

Hey all,

Just got my heater yesterday afternoon and haven't started installing it
yet, but have a few questions:

1.  I think I know which is the combustion inlet and exhaust, but which is
    which re. the fresh air inlet and outlets?  I guess I could just hook
    it up and see which one blows out air, but I figure someone has already
    done that and could tell me.

2.  When running the silver hose from the combustion inlet/outlet to the side
    of the bus, do you use the silver hose on both, or just the exhaust
    (not hooking anything to the inlet)?  And what about the little vent
    cover hat thing?  Does that go on the end of the exhaust on the side of
    the bus?  Or on the intake side?  The instructions aren't too clear on
    the details, and where all the pieces go.

3.  What about that black control box with the two sided tape?  Can I just
    stick it to the furnace itself, or would that be too hot?

Thanks...
