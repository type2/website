For all those who think it folly that Canadian provinces should be
recognized separately may I remind you that World Series Champion of
Major League Baseball is a Canadian team and that if there had not been a
strike this year the champeens most likley would have been another Canadian
team from another province....DC

BTW we Canadians are distinct from Americans on several counts (we know
how to make love in a Canoe...).
