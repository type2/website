Subject: Re: Need timing advice (upright aircooled)

I need some input on where to time a stock upright (1600) engine with
&gt; a 009 distributor.

  When timing a VW engine it's best to use a timing light that has a 
degree dial on it so you can tell exactly how far the distributor is 
advancing!

  The engine will run too hot if it advances farther than 30 Degrees,  
so it doesn't matter so much where you set it at idle as it matters 
where the distributer is advancing to at RPM's.

  Hot running VW motor is not a happy motor!
