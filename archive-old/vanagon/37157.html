Subject: '88 Westy Fridge Racks wanted

Mine came with only one rack. I'd like to get at least the two door 
racks which hold cans in, and also the ice cube trays (don't laugh!!) 
and another inside rack if I can.

Please let me know if you find a source.

Thx.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
