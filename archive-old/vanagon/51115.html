Well now it's time to beautify my Blue Whale.  I wanted to paint the   
front of the whale because of fading.  I was thinking that a whole paint   
job will not be necessary since everywhere else is OK.  I was also   
thinking about using one of these spray products sold in the mega auto   
parts stores.  But, can't get the color code.

My blue whale is, of course, blue with a gray stripe.  However, I don't   
think it is Dove Blue, nor Marine Blue and I have no idea what Capri Blue   
is.  When the hell are automakers gonna start using colors visible to the   
human eye?

In any event, any suggestions?
