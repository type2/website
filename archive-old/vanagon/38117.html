&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Saw this in the Washington Post -- it's been in there for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; '81 Vanagon Camper, auto, AC, 70K, stove, refrigerator, sink, sleeps 4,
&gt; $3500.  Good cond.  301-567-7638.
&gt; 
&gt; That's in Maryland.  Sounds pretty nice.

I just called, it's under contract.  If the guy who's paid a deposit can come 
up with the cash, it's sold.  I plan on calling back Monday.  If anyone hears
of a clean air-cooled vanagon Westy, please let me know.
