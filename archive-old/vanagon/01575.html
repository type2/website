Yep, you gotta grease 'em yourself.

'71 &amp; SB


&gt; 
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to be repacking the CVs sometime soon, so I will be making
&gt; the trip to the FLAPS today. I forget offhand, do the inner CVs on 
&gt; a '71 Bus have CV grease in them, or are they lubricated by tranny oil?
&gt; 
&gt; I know the beetle ones are grease, but I have not done the inners on the
&gt; Bus, so I dont remember what Iread about it.
