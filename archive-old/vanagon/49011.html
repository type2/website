Steven,

You said:

&gt; Make that ~ $600 which includes customs duties and everything you 
&gt;     need to hook it up excluding the propane feed pipe.

Oops, mees never paid the $100 customs duty, nobody ever asked.._dot_dearie
me!  BTW.  The propane feed pipe (plus everthing else) cost less than
the hot water bottles by most westie campers (that is, in colder
climates than CA anyway).

Thanyou for the phone number update though!

Regards,

Chris (in a nice WARM 88 Alaskan Westie)
