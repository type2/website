Subject: Re: 97 EV  camper: we are about to buy! HELP!


&gt;Wife and I are about to sign ourselves away for the 1997 EV Winnie. Does
&gt;anybody have any words of reservation or encouragement? We need your
&gt;advice. We appreciate your advice.
&gt;
&gt;Is it a good product?
&gt;
&gt;I have recently heard that VW service at the dealers is very costly, and
&gt;frustrating?!
&gt;
&gt;Will it hold its value and does it hold up well?
&gt;
&gt;Anything else we should know before me make this (nervous) commitment?
&gt;
&gt;wishing you well: THANKS!

I have a 95 EV camper.  Generally we've liked it a lot - it's our sole
vehicle for day to day and travelling.

Do check all the camper components before taking possession - when we
bought ours we discovered that Winnebago had left a fuse out which caused
problems charging the coach battery.  The dealer you buy from should be
one with the  EV camper dealer status so they're licensed to deal with the
whole beast.  Here in Michigan there's only one such dealer - 90 miles from
where I live.  We've been able to have routine VW service done closer to
home but anything camper related has to go to that dealer.  Regular Winnie
dealers haven't got a clue about the EV in my experience.

Now that we're out of warranty I've been horrified at VW's price for
routine service - will be going elsewhere for it!  All that said, we like
our 95 and are sad to be selling it.

good luck!

Leslie
