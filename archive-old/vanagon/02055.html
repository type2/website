Subject: Canadian Westy = DOT/EPA OK?

My search for a Westphalia Syncro continues, and Joel has suggested that I
might get a better deal north of the border in Canada (specifically the
Vancouver area). I've checked out most of the issues involved in doing so,
and it appears to be no big deal, except for one item. So before I start
making a bunch of long distance phone calls, does anyone know if ANY 89-91
Westphalias sold in Canada meet US EPA &amp; DOT requirements?

I called VWoA customer service, but they need to know a specific VIN before
they can tell me anything.

Thanks!
