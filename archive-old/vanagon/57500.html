Maybe this will narrow down your search for the cause:

 I have recently replaced my lost '81 Westy gas cap with one from an
'84. (I thought that it looked nicer, and you can't lose a cap that
needs the key to open it) Well fellas, now mine is leaking too!!! I
think it's those %#_at_$ later model caps! Maybe it has to do with the key
hole being a vent or something. Your guess is as good as mine, but I
know and easy cure...buy an '81 cap! (NO!! Anything but that!!! ;) 

(New tank and filler neck in mine too, I also rebuilt all other parts
around the cap.)
