Subject: Oil Pressure Guage, Kohl-Weiss, TDC sender
Date: Thu, 1 Sep 1994 14:19:38 -0700 (PDT)


Well, after all this discussion of oil pressure in air-cooled vanagons
I have decided to bite the bullet and put one in this weekend.  I just
called Kohl-Weiss in Redwood City, CA and of course they stock all the
VDO stuff!  And they are not going out of business, just moving.  You
had us Bay area folks worried for a second there, Joel.

I am going to keep the old idiot light sender, as recommended.

The parts guy there says that we need both oil temp and pressure, but
I'm not so sure.  I guess I remember {David?} saying something about
oil pressure first, oil temp second, and head temp last.  Any other
opinions?  And what about the installation?  I can see that putting a
straight pipe adapter in place would be a good idea, but where do you
obtain this so called adapter? Finally, how about a TEE or even three
way tee adapter to connect to the oil press guage, idiot light, and
oil temp guage?

questions.. questions.. questions...

And one last one instigated by the search for David Carment's silver secret.

What is the TDC sender for?  I've never seen it connected in any
wiring diagram, but it sure looks nice.  Might it be a dealer
diagnostic tool hookup?
