Subject: Re: old camping heater sought

&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for an old-type camping heater some of you may have lying
&gt; around in the attic.  It's called a Bernzomatic, and was manufactured
&gt; in the early and mid-60's.  It's a radiant camping heater.  Anyone
&gt; have one they are interested in selling?


those old Bernzomatic heaters have a &quot;Death Notice Recall&quot; out on 
them by Bernzomatic whereby they are buying back all units (yes 
those old ones) without question....  you should look for 
another type.  or perhaps you are trolling for a retirement fund?  :)
