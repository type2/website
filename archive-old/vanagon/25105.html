     In my Syncro Westie search, I only came up with one in Virginia Beach
     area. Over the past three months there have been several Westies
     listed.   You can check want ads there by going to :

     http://www.infi_dot_net/pilot/classifieds/vans.html

     Off line, the Washington Post typically has one or two Westies for
     sale each weekend, in a variety of prices, ages and conditions.

     Where are you located?

I'm hoping one day to be able to inform the list that I am the proud owner
of a Westy, but I've had zero luck finding one.  Does anyone have a listing
of newspapers or classifieds that are on the net?  I'm specifically looking
for something on the east coast of the US.

Thanks
PEJ
