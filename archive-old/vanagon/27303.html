Subject: An '85 I checked out.

I went and checked out an '85 GL Vanagon earlier this evening thanks to a
pointer from someone posting here.  
It is pretty darn straight (ding in drivers door, some surface rust and the
back bumper has a little wrinkle).
The interior is in excellent condition save for some of the plastic
shrouding on some seatbelt buckles is missing.
Compared to another one we're checking out, this one doesn't have the big
sunroof, and only the front seats have head rests.  But that roof leaks (he
says drains) it has more damage to the body, the lifter noise I asked you
guys about, and the wheezing PS pump.
He is the original owner and has always had it serviced at Carter VW in Seattle.
165,000 miles.
2500 miles on a new clutch
needs front tires
Starts right up, idles perfectly smoothly
I drove it for 15 minutes including a stretch on the freeway.  It rolls
along very smoothly, no shimmy or rattles.  Brakes are fine.

Here's the downer:
One of the reciepts he showed me from February of this year (when the clutch
was done) says that his left head gasket has a minor leak, and quotes
$350.00 to replace it.  There was no visible white crap on the outside of
the motor, it didn't smell like coolant, etc.  He said the dealer told him
that it wasn't bad, and that he should just watch the coolant level (yes
it's blue).
Now I know that this head gasket thing is hereditary (sp?), but I have some
questions:

His quote from Carter for changing the head gasket was $350.00.  That
doesn't sound like a whole lot (wow, is this the 90's or what?), and even
seems lower than it would be for a conventional upright watercooled
4-bangers.  Hell a clutch costs more than that.  Could it be that this is
done with the engine still in the car (I'm an air cooled kind of guy and I'm
used to dropping the engine for basically everything)?  I was thinking about
it on the drive home, and with the absence of cooling tin, it sure seems
like there might be enough room to do it.  Any thoughts?

At first I have been avoiding bad head gaskets like it was a social disease.
However, upon furthur reflection I realized that I am looking at Vanagons in
the '84-'85 range which means that sooner or later I'm going to face this
problem anyway, right?  There is no certainty that another one that doesn't
leak (and at least I know about this up front) won't spew forth tomorrow, right?

So, how big a deal is a head gasket to replace?  Should I do them both?
What does a gasket set cost?  I turn my own wrenches, always have.  I lose
absolutely no sleep over tearing a motor apart.  Am I losing it here?

He wants $2800 firm, but so far he doesn't think the head gasket is a big
deal.  He is quite willing to let me have it checked out.  Maybe if he hears
it straight from Dieter the price might come down???
