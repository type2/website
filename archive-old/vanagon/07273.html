Subject: Re: AC in the winter

The question I have is this: 

I notice from reading the manual that the A/C compressor is prevented from
coming on if the outside temperature is 50 
degrees or less. Does this mean that if you plan to run it every 
two weeks during the winter that you should do so inside a 
heated, inside garage or you are not benefiting your system?
