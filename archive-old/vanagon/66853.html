Subject:      Re: Dometic gas cooling problems

I had a similar problem with my Dometic frig in my '90 westy.
Everything seemed to work fine, but it wouldn't get cold enough.
I ordered a new thermoswitch for the fan.
The part number was 3-104723, and it cost $23.65.
It is a small blue disk, with 2 contacts.
After comparing the new with the old switch,
I found out that the old one would
only turn on at a much higher temperature than the new
thermoswitch. Now my fan goes on much more often and
at a much lower temperature.
Make sure the metal base of the thermoswitch makes contact with
the cooling fin.

I now get ice on the evaporator inside the frig.
