Subject: Re: Is there a Chevrolet list?

&gt;This is a little off the normal VW path, but...
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of a Chevrolet or GM list, where people might
&gt;know about mechanical problems with a Chevy 2800 V6 engine?
&gt;
&gt;Any responses would be appreciated.

Any responses?...OK, How about - Get lost you bustardized half-breed!!

Just kidding, Steve, I followed your tour home with great interest.
Sitting in Felix this noon looking at a pristine interior, straight and
clean body and superb suspension, was thinking about the eighth engine
replacement in 80K miles, and wishing there was a clean, &quot;fool&quot;-proof
engine transplant that would give me power enough to get across Montana,
etc. under the new speed laws and guarantee many more years of enjoyment
without altering the cabin, cooling system, etc.  Good luck with the
v6anagon.
