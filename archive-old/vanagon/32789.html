Subject: Penetrating Fluid Recommendations
Date: Sun, 14 Jan 1996 11:38:04 -0800 (PST)


I'm looking for some suggestions on penetrating liquid to use to
free up bolts that have probably not been moved in 30 years.  I've been
using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
there that is better.
