Marcus,

&gt;From what I can tell from my T4 brochure collection, &quot;California&quot; is used by 
Westfalia to describe the campers marketed in Germany (all my other 
brochures UK, Norway, France, etc. don't mention &quot;California&quot;). There are 
two versions...the &quot;California Coach&quot; has the usual pop-top, and the 
&quot;California Tour&quot; has the extended roof.
