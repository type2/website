Both not seeing the flame and not cooling are normal :-)
(Seriously, I never see the flame, which usually drives me nuts since I
can't tell if it's lit.  After a few hours cooling starts, however.)

&gt;Third is there a transformer or something for when you have it hooked up 
&gt;to 110v power to run the 12v items without runing down the battery?

I've heard that the 110 only powers the plugs in the van and the fridge.  It
does a great job on the latter.

YMMV.
