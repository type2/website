Subject: fuel injection/gauges

$2k later (engine rebuild) and an old problem has returned with the fuel
injection.  The bus starts hard (I have to press the accelerator down about
half way and crank it over 2 or 3 times before it will cough to life - I
thought you didn't have to touch the gas at all on FI vehicles).  Then, it
requires a lengthy warm up (more than 3 minutes) or it just refuses to idle.

Prior to the rebuild, I experienced the same problem but solved it rather
easily by tightening all the hose connections.  I cannot find anything loose
and am at a loss.

The mechanic said the head temp sensor checked out ok and will check the system
again at the 600 mile service.  I don't want to wait that long!  Any other
suggestions on what to look for?

Also - I want to install oil temp/head temp gauges.  The mechanic told me they
aren't very accurate on air cooled VW's.  Guess that means I'll have to install
'em myself.  Is this a do-able job for a newbie?  Any advice on references re
install or the best sources for quality gauges (I see a big price difference
between J.C. Whitney and Bus Boys)?

Thanks!
