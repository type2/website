&gt;Looking for a rear heater core (also probably need front).  VW wants $150
for
&gt;a new one (the valve is ok, so core only).  Anybody got a line on a
&gt;reasonably priced one of these?  I don't think I want a used one, unless it
&gt;is a newer used one, as all the ones I see in Junk yards seem to be leaking.

I an get you new rear core for $100.00.  Fronts not avaiable aftermarket. In
fact I've been waiting 3 weeks for dealer to get me one.  Call VW and
complain,  1-800-822-8987.  Ask why Jettas are recalled and Vanagons are not.
 Also beware of that bleeder screw on the valva assembly.  I've seen many
break spilling hot coolant al over the place.  I think the bean counters at
VW have too much control.  Plastic screws for the cooling system.  All the
plastic flanges also like to crack at the worst times.  E- mail me if good
FLAPS can't get that core for you.
Dennis.
