&gt;I have a '74 Bus (1800) which has low compression (~90 psi) on all

i don't recall the exact numbers, but on the 2.0 liter, i think it was like
80 psi was the lowest, and 110 was kinda nominal, and 150 or so was super
good/brand new. and no more than 40 psi between highest and lowest cylinder.
since all of yours are the same, i wonder if maybe you have a mis-matched
engine: where maybe the heads are not the right ones for the rest of the
pieces.  or the pistons are not right and/or the wrong piston rods, etc.
something like that.

&gt;It runs fine.  (Except on cold mornings, but that's the carb and
&gt;another long story.)  Gets up hills with all the power one could
&gt;expect in a bus.  Runs hot, gets poor mileage, but probably not
&gt;unreasonably so.  So the questions are: are these compression numbers

but what is 'hot' and what is 'poor'? my 88 bus gets 'poor' mileage, if
you compare it to most any other kind of van (except those BigMutha v-8's).
and air-cools almost always SEEM to run 'hot'.  what you need to do is put
an oil temp and oil pressure gauge on it and see if they show numbers outside
the specs for your engine.

since you don't KNOW for sure that the engine is original (i.e., the Dreaded
Previous Owner might have rebuilt it once or twice before you got it), you
can't really be sure that all the pieces are correct. and about the only way
to find out is to take it apart and measure it. but if it's running ok, and
the fuel economy is, say, 17-20 mpg on the highway, and it doesn't use but
about 1 quart of oil every 3000 miles, and if the dipstick is NOT too hot
to hold in your hand ... well, maybe there's nothing really 'wrong'. just a
non-spec rebuild before.

anybody ever run into this sort of rebuild problem before?
