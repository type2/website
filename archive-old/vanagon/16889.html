Subject: re: my windshield washer pain

Hi, just a note for those with rear wash/wipers. Check the hose where it 
goes from roof to hatch frame. Mine was almost broken through. 10% of the 
water got onto the window in a weak stream (duh, the jet must be clogged), 
the other 90% was going into the roof channels, down the inside sound 
padding and soaking the rug. (Duh, gee I seem to be using a lot of washer 
fluid even though the jet is clogged, must be a dinky little reservoir!) 
Anchors away,    tim s.
