&gt;        You're exerting 390 lb of force, *centered* 1 foot from the
&gt;socket drive. If you take each of you separately, one is exerting 195lb
&gt;of force centered 10 inches (12 - (4/2)) from the socket center, the other
&gt;is exerting 195lb of force centered 14 inches (12 + (4/2) from the socket
&gt;center. That's 162.5 foot pounds and 227.5 foot pounds, 390 total.
&gt;        (note that each of you is standing on one foot for this demo).
&gt;
&gt;        You can continue subdividing the width over which the wieght is
&gt;applied, multiply the wieght of each slice by the distance of its center
&gt;from the socket center and then add the results up and you'll always get
&gt;390 foot pounds.

Outstanding. Thank you. It was counter-intuitive until you explained it,
whereas now it's...(contra-intuitive?) much clearer. ;)
