&gt;&gt; 	I also insulated the entire top of the engine compartment with this
&gt;&gt; stuff called &quot;THe Insulator&quot;, an impulse purchase at the local speed shop.
&gt;&gt; I used Liquid Nails and 3M 90 Spray adhesive.  I also insulated the rear
&gt;&gt; apron, although I'm not sure how well this stuff can take the heat.  It does
&gt;&gt; work as far as keeping the apron cool, though...  I also insulated the 
&gt;&gt; engine lid on a whim.  The bus is much quieter now, at least engine noise
&gt;
&gt;The Insulator?
&gt;Tell us more about this stuff.

&quot;The Insulator&quot; is this fiber mat stuff with a foil backing.

&gt;And, just what are liquid nails?

Liquid nails is a caulk-type adhesive, but you can buy it in a squeeze
tube, too.  Its been around forever, you can just ask your local hardware
store for it.

3M 90 is a spray adhesive, and its expensive - almost $12 per can!  Oye!
