Yeah, there is a flex tube under there and the bracket that holds it to
the car looks broken, someone's put a clamp around it to hold the tube
against the car.  Dan, you're a kind man--this must be it!  

&gt;From the looks of it, the little bracket is welded on one side to the
car and the other end the boden tube is held by it, but the bracket it
broken in between where it is welded to the car body and where it holds
the tube.  Is this as simple as getting it welded?  Seems like there'd
be a lot of tension on the bracket, it's a pretty whimpy lookin' little
thing.

&gt; 
&gt; I do not remember if a 79' has a boden tube (tube the guides the cable
&gt; to
&gt; the clutch arm) or not. But you might want to check it to see if is at
&gt; the
&gt; proper angle and or not worn (coils in the tube might be stretched or
&gt; bent, when you have these problems.
&gt; 
&gt; I have owned beetles for many years and have replaced
&gt; a number of boden tubes as a result of many types of clutch/shifting 
&gt; problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know the result.

&gt; &gt; hot, the clutch cable will grow too loose, making it grind when I
&gt; try to
&gt; &gt; go into reverse.  I'll crawl under and tighten it, everything seems
&gt; &gt; fine, and then a few days later the same thing will happen.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	The weird thing is this:  I've had the cable replaced recently,
&gt; &gt; same problem. AND, it can be really bad on a hot day, grinding when
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; try to get it into gear, but if I leave it be and drive it the next
&gt; day,
&gt; &gt; it's fine, not too loose at all.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	If it's just a stretching cable, why would it be out of
&gt; &gt; adjustment one day and then not the next?  And what the heck could
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; hot day have to do with it?
