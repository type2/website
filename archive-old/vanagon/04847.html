Interesting new diagnostic discovered this afternoon:  If your clutch doesn't
work maybe your engine is falling out.

In recent days the Vanagon had been clunking going into reverse, as though
clutch was not fully disengaged, to the point where I stopped using it till I
could figure out what's up.  Borrowed wife's leg long enough to bleed the 
clutch lines real well.  No change.

Thanked wife's leg, sent them both back in the house, and I lay under the 
Vgon looking and pondering.  Pilot bearing?  Worn out clutch?  Throw out?
The bearing that is, not the Vanagon.  Some unforeseen consequence of the
Porsche 6 conversion?  It's not really uncomfortable lying under a Vanagon
unless it's too cold out or what you're working on is getting on your face.

Then I noticed that the trans/engine seam is more than a black line.  It's
maybe 1/8 inch open.  Maybe even 3/16.  This is a new one on me (and was the
problem of course) -- I've never had the four big engine mounts loosen up on
me, but they'll sure get locktighted from now on.

One more thing to put a wrench on and check while you're under there on other
business.

B.
