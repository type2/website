Are we talking about majorettes twirling Maglites? Visualize a funky parade...
I could see them throwing them really far into the air and trying to catch
them with varying success. THUNK! Owww! Instant Jan Brady nose!!! =) &lt;Crowd
goes wild&gt; At least the Shriners on minibikes and in Gogomobiles would get a
laugh!
(Momentary Flashback)
============================
Baton - as in the &quot;nightstick&quot; that poo-lice carry - several methods of
application, to skulls or to poke in the abdomen with vigor.

By the way -  I suppose if you have to do this in self-defense you have an
arguable defense - if you think to do it offensively, be real careful 'bout
that,  I believe that there are some not well published  but strict and
restrictive laws restricting that kind of behavior and use of that kind of 
implement!!
