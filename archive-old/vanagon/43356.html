Subject: Vanagon rim colors


        I'm going to sandblast the stock steel rims for my 1982
Vanagon and am going to mount the stock full size plastic
imitation spoke wheel covers.

        Were the stock rims painted silver to match the silver of
the full size wheel covers?

        Has anyone painted your rims with epoxy paint, and did 
you get much better life out of the paint job?
