There's another thing I forgot to tell you about my 79 with
&quot;morning sickness.&quot;  When I'm starting it in the morning and it 
starts to make the weird noise, sometimes I turn the key off and take    
it out of the ignition, but the car is still trying to start on its own.
When I put the key back in and try to start it, it will.  I don't 
understand how th ecar can try and start with the key out of the  
ignition.  From the responses that I've gotten, it sounds like the 
starter/solenoid.  Anything else to think about?
