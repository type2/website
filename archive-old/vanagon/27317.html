Subject: Lots O Camper Questions and Doubts


My understanding, or thought was that the GL had all the power equipment 
standard (power windows, door locks, stereo, power mirrors, AC, cruise, and 
so on) plus metallic paint, a fancier interior etc.  If the GL has the sink 
and stove, and the plain camper does not, what is a weekender......... a 
standard camper?

Did Weekenders come in pop tops and non poptops?

Is a Weekender a variation on the Westfalia?

I thought I was getting somewhere, but it appears I'm helplessly confused.

With all the engine problems(leaks), hesitation, finicky emissions, 
outrageous prices over blue book, ($16500 for ANY VEHICLE WITH 125,000 mi is 
robbery, yet I've seen it paid for a 90 Westy), marginally working 
refrigerators and air conditioners, little to no power, bad handling, 
expensive parts...... I'm starting to think looking for a Westy is NUTS!!! 
 Maybe a Ford Econoline with a good old reliable straight six, and all the 
aftermarket camper junk is the way to go???

I Can Feel the Flames Already!
