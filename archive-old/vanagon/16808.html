Subject: Re: Canvas Cot Conundrum...

&gt;	My 78 Westfalia has mounts for a canvas &quot;baby cot&quot; to rest above 
&gt;the cab area...  Is this standard on late model Westys?
&gt;	I've seen em on plenty of earlier campers, so my question is:  
&gt;will an early (Late 60's/ early 70's) cab-area canvas cot fit into the 
&gt;mounts on my 78?

Yes, no problem. I've seen two versions, oldest is round tubing with welded 
on ends that fit into the brackets, newer are square tubes with a gentle 
bevel cut off and end bent over to fit brackets. I've shortened new ones to 
fit a Vanagon, works fine, has to be higher up than older busses. If you can 
pick one up cheap do it. They are great for heaving towels coats sneakers 
and even children into, keeping the floor clear.    tim s.
