It serves two very important purposes.  It tells the ECU when to expect the
engine to idle so it can adjust timing and mixture.  When ever the engine is
being over-run with the throttle closed, it turns of the fuel injectors to
prevent the high engine vacuum from sucking excess fuel through the
injectors.  This also saves some fuel. Because the fuelk is cut-off during
this condition, the O2 sensor signal indicates an extremely lean condition,
 The ECU ignores the O2 signal for 30 crankshaft revolutions when the engine
returns to an idle speed when the throttle is closed.  This is only time that
the airflow meters calibration is critical.  Dijijet does the same thing, put
cuts off the fule at a much lower speed,(1350 rpm).  That is why they often
hunt when idling.
