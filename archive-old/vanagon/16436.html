Well, it happened.

	I'm being micromanaged, and our stuffed shirts have equated e-mail
with personal phone calls, so now I'm not allowed personal e-mail, and
it is with much regret that I must sign off.

	They don't seem to remember the times I had to come down to the office
at 3:00am to put the machine back together, or the times I my pager goes
off (at least 2x a week, usually more) and I have to kill some $_at_(*$#
user process thats filling up the disks or sucking up every available CPU
cycle.  

	The 1/2 hour or so every day I spend on mail is very precious to them,
so now instead of eating my lunch at my desk, I'm going to go down to the
basement and work on my bus, and leave my pager on my desk.  I guess I
can also leave the pager at my desk when I walk out the door at 5:01pm
(instead of 6:30pm) and all weekend.

	Sorry, had to vent, but I'm kinda toqued right now (275ft/lbs, to be
exact...)

	If you still wish to contact me, you can still use this address; its
just he'll be looking for VINATGEVW and VANAGON...

	Maybe if you all wrote to my boss and told him how much you miss
me he'd let me back on (cmark_at_tim_dot_com)

	This is the same guy that told me not to put quotes in my .sig
(although he doesn't know what a .sig is...)

See ya,

Thom
