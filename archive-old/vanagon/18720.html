Subject: &quot;Re: Speedo error&quot;

Now I'm worried...  Maybe Joel or someone else can help...

My '87 weekender says it's doing 73 mph at 4200 rpm (in fourth, to be sure :-).
It's got 205 / 14 pirellis.  Joel, how about your Vanagon?

&gt;  There is nothing wrong with your speedo. All late model vanagon speedos that
&gt;  I know of read way wrong. Like, when it says 75MPH you are really going 68
&gt;  or something. They all do this.
