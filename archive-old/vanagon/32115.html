I've now found out that the only Subaru engines that go through heads are
the turbo versions.  Here's what else I've found out from my local Surbaru
dealer about six cylinder Subaru engines.

1)  The SVX has a 3.3 liter six rather than a 3.0 liter.  32 valves, 230 bhp _at_
      5,400 rpm, 224 lb-ft _at_ 4,400 rpm, maximum engine speed = 7,000 rpm.
2)  SVX 3.3 liter engines are entirely different than the smaller Subaru six cylinders.
3)  The smaller six cylinder engine has about 150 hp.
