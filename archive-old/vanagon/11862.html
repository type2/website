Subject: RE: damage from missing upper bellhousing bolts?

Wolf writes,

&gt;Question - What kind of damage would result from driving around for a long
&gt;time with the upper bellhousing bolts not installed?


Hmmm.  I know that putting type IVs into an earlier body without the
bellhousing mount often resulted in the worst case scenario - a cracked case,
apparently just resulted from the extra torque twist allowed.....

Don't know about upright motors and I don't wish to put 'the mozz on'. 
However, I would guess some form a case cracking?
