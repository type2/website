&gt; Does anyone out here have power door locks? If so, how is the wire to the
&gt; sliding door routed? I am installing  an aftermarket kit and am stumped at
&gt; how to do a sano installation, all the other doors have hinges so this is not
&gt; a problem. Is there slack in the wire when the door is open or ?

     The Syncro I saw had 4 brass contacts on the post near the lock.
     When you closed the door It made connection with contact type
     springs on the door. When opened it just didn't work.
