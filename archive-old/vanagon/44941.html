Subject: Re: Dumb question re: windshield washer reservoir

&gt;Well, up until now I've never had to add washer fluid to my buses.  So my
&gt;question
&gt;is...how do I get the air into the reservoir?  It doesn't seem to take a
&gt;standard tire
&gt;pump type of fitting.  Is there some special attachment I need?
&gt;
&gt;It's a 77 and since I bought my first bus in October I've pretty much been
&gt;using Mother
&gt;Nature's windshield washer fluid which is provided non-stop and free of
&gt;charge here in
&gt;Vancouver.

        My suggestion is this: Go to a junkyard, find a rabbit or something
H20 cooled (and VW or Audi), pull the electric pump out of the washer
resiovoir, put it in your bus, add a toggle switch. Voila! You now no
longer need worry about the stupid air pressure. Works great on mine, even
when I forget to check air pressure...  ;-)

Peace,
