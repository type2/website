&gt;      &gt;I would if I had ftp access to the outside world (sniff).  I don't 
&gt;      &gt;suppose you could put this on a Web server?
&gt;      
&gt;      Hey David, wanna put those Bus pix on my server for Steven and anyone 
&gt;      else?? I've already got a few Brazilian Buses on there - so they would 
&gt;      go nice. Jpeg please though about 64k.
&gt;

&gt; 

No, No, NO!  Lee, I appreciate it but every time I try to read your
server, I get a fatal error.
