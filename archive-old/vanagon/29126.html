&gt;So here's a Friday question:
&gt;Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?

i always was told/brainwashed that the lane next fartherest away from the
median (the center strip of the multi-lane bi-directional highway) was the
SLOWEST lane. the lane closest to the median was the FASTEST lane.

this was supposedly to allow for the best-of-all-possible-worlds where ALL
exit ramps exited off the slow lanes (away from the median).

unfortunately, the american theory of high-speed highways has become very
muddled in politics and money (&quot;There's never enough money or time to do it
right the first time, but there's ALWAYS enough money and time to do it
over!&quot;)

the lanes between the slow and fast lanes are medium-speed lanes for people
who can't make up their minds.  :)

now ... you drive like that in Atlanta or Chicago, and you will be run over
... reminds me of Saigon traffic: two paved lanes of highway, five streams
of traffic, seemingly all going in different directions!! and God help you
in the traffic circles!!!!
