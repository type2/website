Subject: Surging?

I was wondering (this might be a dumb question to you all, but I've only had
my '87 for about a month) if you could answer me something. . .

SInce I bought my '87 GL weekender, I've been noticing that it suffers from
chronic &quot;power surges&quot;. Hard to describe, but in mostly 1st and 2nd gears I
notice that it tends to have rapid fits of these surges. Best way to
describe it is that it is as if I'm tapping the gas pedal down slightly and
rapidly.

Is this the cause of a bad O2 sensor?

TIA
