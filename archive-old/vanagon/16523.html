&gt; Does this mean that decent shifting is actually possible on a VW bus older
&gt; than my wife? How does one achieve this? Do I need a new tranny, or is
&gt; there some sort of linkage-rebuild I can do, that will _significantly_
&gt; improve the shifter feel? 

 When I got my '70, the push down for reverse had also gone. On examination
 of the plate that sits under the gear stick, I found that the small piece
 of metal (looks like a tiny bit of angle iron) that runs across the hole
 in the plate had rusted right away. The idea is that pushing the gear stick
 down allows it to clear the `angle iron' bit and so into reverse. If the
 bit isn't there it can be slid into reverse rather to easily. When I 
 first got the bus I was forever starting off in the wrong direction!
 So I replaced that plate. Problem solved.

 The biggest difference on these busses to the general `stiring soup'
 gear change, can be made by replacing the gear shift linkage thing
 that sits over the gearbox. Its a small metal cage with rubber
 blocks on each side. Over the years the rubber tends to wear
 resulting in incresingly sloppy gear changing. Obviously check 
 it first to see if that is the problem but replacement of
 this cage normally helps tighten the feel of the box. Its a
 fairly fiddly process and lots of swearing and bruised knuckles
 will occur.

 The only other thing I've tried with on a couple of busses, was
 to remove the gear stick and check the little spring loaded pin
 that sits in the ball on the bottom. A couple of times I've found
 that the pin has seized into the hole, either through lack of lubrication
 or because the spring has broken. Clearing off the old grease and making
 sure its all working properly before reagreasing and assembly can make 
 some difference, although not as much as replacing the gear shift linkage.

 (After replacing the gearstick and plate you will probably find it all
  needs adjusment, as moving the plate changes the angle the stick sits
  at slightly).

&gt; P.S. That '70 bus also had noticably lighter steering than my '71. Anyone
&gt; care to guess the cause? I'm mystified. The '70 is not &quot;immaculate&quot; by any
&gt; means-- my '71 is far prettier. But the '71 takes both hands to get around 
&gt; corners at low speeds. The '70 stomps it in drivability, despite having half
&gt; a turn of play in the steering wheel.
&gt; 
 Strange I always found it the other way round; the earlier style steering
 box as fitted to my '70  (complete with half a turn of play) is quite
 heavy when compared to the later (71 and on?) style box. Some where in
 the murky depths of my brain, I seem to remember having read that the 
 later box was designed to give lighter steering, but I'll have to search
 around to find the source.
