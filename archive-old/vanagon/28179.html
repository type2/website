Subject: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

The second thing I find offensive about VWT&amp;A or DB&amp;HVWs is that
the &quot;bimbo factor&quot; is clearly a devise to cloak the fact that
the writing in these magazines (both technical and event) sucks..
My 6th grade son can do better....and considering that I've
been thru college/grad school/law school reading something written
by an author whose highest literary style is to use words like
&quot;sano&quot;, &quot;bitchin'&quot;, &quot;resto&quot;, &quot;ass kickin' stereo&quot; just doesn't
cut it...

I say:

Exactly, these magazines are not written for adult auto-enthusiasts, but
rather, for the younger set. All the advertising, design, and content is
for people 16 - 25 would be my guess. At a mere 30 yrs old I find most of
the magazines style/content hopelessly trendy. Let the marketing dollars
fall where they may.

I'll pick up those mags only when I have to...if there is some info
that I'm not able to get anywhere else. All is not lost however,
this group as well as the VintagVW group provides much better
and IMMEDIATE tech info than any of those magazines could ever
do! In addition, clubs like the VVWCA, GASS, The CVA etc. puit
out a better newsletter than these editors at the various magazines...

I say:

That is why I'm here and I don't even currently own a VW. I'm looking for
honest critical answers and experiences and that is what I get. Not
articles written to sell a product or promote a lifestyle centered on the
worship of &quot;what's cool this week&quot;.
