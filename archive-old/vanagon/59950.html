Subject: Re: Coolant Refill Bottle/Rear heater core


If you have not had a look beneath the rear seat to check for coolant 
leaks at the rear heater core, I encourage you to do it soon.  You just 
need a screwdriver and 10 minutes or so, four screws to remove the kick 
panel, 4 or 6 to remove the heater shroud, two clips on the outlet vent.  

I ingnored my suspicions until the carpet and soundproofing were 
SATURATED with antifreeze.  Heap big mess.  Look for corrosion on the 
heat exchanger fins, and feel around for moisture at all joints.  Good luck!

&gt; I have the same problem, I also can occasionally smell coolant. Lots of
&gt; people on the list have had problems with the rear heater core leaking. I
&gt; was going to check it next, but haven't had time yet. It may be the source
&gt; of our problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I've noticed that my coolant refill bottle seems to run dry, in the
&gt; space of
&gt; &gt; &gt;about a week.  The engine was recently fixed for a colant leak and the
&gt; heads
&gt; &gt; &gt;rebuilt.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;1.) Is loss from the refill tank normal?
&gt; &gt; &gt;2.) Where do I check for leaks?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have the same problem.  As far as I know, all coolant leaks were fixed
&gt; &gt; and I STILL have a regularly dry overflow bottle.  I'll be looking for
&gt; &gt; suggestions, too.
