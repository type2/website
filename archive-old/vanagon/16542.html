Subject:      FFriday: a happy song (for tobin)

Waving at Buses
&lt;to the tune of Waltzing Matilda ... with apologies to our Aussies&gt;


&lt;chorus&gt;
Waving at buses, waving at buses,
Waving at buses so happily,
As we drive down the roads
And the highways of this universe,
We'll all be waving at buses we see.


Once there was a Microbus,
Camped beside a flowing stream,
Under the shade of a big fir tree,
And he sang as he sat,
And waited til his water boiled,
You'll come a'waving at buses with me.

Soon another bus,
This time a somewhat newer one,
Rolled down the road to the big fir tree.
And he waved at the Microbus,
popped his top and settled in,
Singing this song, oh, so happily.

&lt;chorus&gt;

Later on that same day,
more buses joined the campground crew,
Bread-loafs and Vanagons and Eurovans, too.
And they sang as they sat
Around their little camping fires,
We'll come a'waving at buses with you.

Now we drive the highways
And the crowded boulevards,
Looking and watching so carefully,
To catch a glimpse of buses,
No matter what the model is,
And we'll be waving so happily.

&lt;chorus&gt;
