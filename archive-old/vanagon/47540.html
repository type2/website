&gt; &gt; nope. those jail bars were an optional accessory. and you can/could order
&gt; &gt; them afterward and install them. they supposedly prevent luggage from banging
&gt; &gt; into the glass. i've seen them on buses as far back as 1967.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; oh, and there is a set for the rearmost side windows as well.
&gt; As an official representative of the split window population here in
&gt; waterworld, I must say that the jail bars appeared on the Deluxe busses in the
&gt; 50's. Good thing I know all this wonderful stuff, eh?  Actually, there's a blue
&gt; Vanagon on my street with jail bars. Pretty crazy, I just noticed the jail bars
&gt; yesterday, and was thinking how curious it was. Now, here's this discussion to
&gt; set me at ease. Thanks, V_at_L !

One of my earliest memories is riding over the engine in our bus, holding onto
those bars.  We had a Deluxe ragtop, black over red, probably about a '54.
Lots of memories.  We had the bus until about 1961, when I was six.

I'll have to find a set for my kids, although I don't let them ride back
there like I did, lack of seat belts, etc.
