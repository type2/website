Subject: Software vanity plate, seam sealer

	THE vanity plate for VW Beetles is obviously

	FEATURE

	and if you get this, you may qualify as a software geek!


	On the subject of seam sealers, I've been working on new rain
gutters for my house, and having given up on soldering the 10' sections
together, I'm pop-riveting them and using plenty of &quot;Aluminum Grey&quot;
sealer goop. Comes in caulking gun tubes, medium grey color, just
about infinately sticky and seems to be butyl rubber and filler mixed 
with a mind-expanding solvent :).

	It seems to dry softer than the &quot;Brushable Seam Sealer&quot; I used
on my battery tray replacement, but that's $15/quart and the gutter
sealer is $3.59/tube. Its made to be applied to aluminum and galvanized
steel, and is probably easier to find. 

	It CAN be removed from fingers, tools, etc, using laquer thinner.
