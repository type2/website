About Syncro distributor assemblies, Fred writes:

&gt;Has anyone replaced the distributor assembly in a 2.1 syncro digifant? 
&gt;Where did you get your part? I got a quote for a rebuilt bosch unit from 
&gt;Trak Auto for ~$176. Sound in the ballpark? The local mech quoted me $600+ 
&gt;for a new unit.

I remember some Syncro owners mentioning that their distributors were
water-sealed with some sort of a gasket or rubber boot - the one in my '89
is *not*, and I bet Fred's isn't either. 

Did this change on '90-'91 Syncros?  If so, I wonder which one(s) he got
quoted on?
