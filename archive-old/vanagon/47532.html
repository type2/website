 question:
 
 i have a super bright , jumbo LED that reqires 2.6v _at_ 50ma
 
 how do i figure the resistance of the dropping resistor for a 12v 
 source? &gt;&gt;


R = I/E       Need to drop 10 volts at 50mA.           10 / .050  =  200
ohms.

For power, watts = volts X amps.    10 volt X  ..050 amp = .5.  

you need a 200 ohm, 1/2 wat resistor.  I would go with a 1 watt to be safe.
