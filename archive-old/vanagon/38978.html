Subject: Re: Wretched Excess

I knew my original Wretched Excess post hadn't reached the whole list when
Steve didn't comment on it.  Steve mentions the deck height on a Vgon
crewcab.  Actually the crewcabs are interesting candidates for some
conversions because the cargo deck is some inches higher than the
engine deck of a Vgon van.  Enough for a V-8, I don't know, but I can't
imagine anyone would mind a tasteful penthouse towards the end of the
cargo deck to accommodate the carb and distributor.  I should have taken
some measurements from the V-8 while I was looking at it.
