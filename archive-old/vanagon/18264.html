Subject: Alternator Kit (long)


Here's a little information for pre-pancake bay-windows and splits.  I
put an alternator &quot;kit&quot; into my 1970 Kombi this week.  I had the
generator setup on a dual-port motor with 34-pict carb.  I ordered the
kit from a mail-order setup for US$145.95 total.

Feel free to add/subtract/change as is necessary.  
I'd like to post it to the gopher files.  Let me know what you think.  

OFFICIAL GUBBAMINT DISCLAIMER:  YMMV, and I can offer no guarantees.  
However, it did work on mine, and quite well.  

First, the alternator _does_ require the new stand; it sits the unit in 
the right position to mount to the fan and avoid the fuel pump:  most of 
us will have the generator-style fuel pump.  I ended up replacing the 
fuel pump to the alternator-style anyways, but I'll address this later 
(_at_US$17.50-&quot;Brosol&quot;).  

Second, if you are running the 34-pict, you will need to do some filing 
on the alternator to provide clearance for the accelator pump adjuster 
(note:  if you have a spare 34-pict-4 -California emissions, on 73/74 
bugs/supers, you can cannibalize the arm--(BTDT) and avoid this filing).  
I just filed, filed, filed, and then put the carb on to check, then filed 
some more until finished (note:  be sure to cover that intake 
manifold--the aluminum filings make a real mess).  My local FLAPRS 
recommended this solution.  The place I ordered it from said there was a 
plate which would raise the carb. and provide clearance, but I didn't 
investigate this.  

The fuel pump:  I switched to the alternator-style for one reason:   
there is only 1-2mm of clearance between the alternator and the pump when 
installed--I feared some potential of vapor lock, being so close to a 
heat-producing alternator.  

The procedure:  follow the procedure for generator removal in your 
favorite shop manual.  The instructions that came with my kit were fairly 
generic but still useful.  I've added here whatever hints or ideas I had 
while doing it.  

-	(optional) remove the intake manifold--this will provide easier 
access to some of the bolts &amp; screws.	

-	(optional)  I already had my engine out for other projects; you 
may wish to wait until such an opportunity.

-	remove the stand and disconnect it from the oil filler pipe--as 
you look down the oil filler, you'll see a round doughnut-looking bolt.  
I used a big screwdriver and just banged it out until I could unscrew 
it.  Due to it's oily location, it's not too tough. Replace it with the 
new one.

-	Pop the little inserts that hold the fan and belt pulley into 
place out of the old unit with a screwdriver and just put them into the 
ridges on the new one.  It was a little loose, so installation will 
require a little manipulation.  

-	when you mount the fan to the alternator shaft (or fan pulley), 
carefully slide the notch in the fan onto the insert, then tap on the 
exposed part to make sure it slides in nice and level.  It's a real pain 
if they slip out (which is easy to do) and fall into the fan housing.  

-	once it's back on the stand and strapped down, check the carb 
clearance and get ready to file.  The alternator with my kit 
(Bosch--Brazil) needed a good bit of filing; don't worry about filing 
through the alternator case--it's pretty thick where you need to file. 

-	the wiring is simple for mine--a big wire to the battery, the 
idiot light wire, and a ground wire.

-That's it--good luck!
