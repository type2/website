&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to acquire the '81 camper I've been having some
&gt; refurbishing work done on.  Am looking forward to it in every
&gt; way EXCEPT one:  the damned arcane angle of the steering wheel.
&gt; People tell me I'll get used to it, but I'm curious to hear from
&gt; other vanagon owners on this matter.  

Hey Martha!

That's great.  Waddya mean arcane.  I thought all other &quot;just cars&quot; had
it wrong in the first place!  You just drive your baby for a while
and then try to drive a plain car.  I think you'll find the
Vanagon is right as rain.  :)

&gt; 
&gt; Further, has anyone out there figured out a way to retrofit
&gt; another wheel, or alter the angle of the existing one?  If
&gt; so, would be curious how...

Wouldn't even consider it.  ;&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Martha Rubin
&gt; 

Happy Cruisin'
