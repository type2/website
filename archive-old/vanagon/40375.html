(Thom beats WCM into the ground.)

TH&gt;The seals for the doors are WAY too stiff.  The seals on my 42 year bus are
TH&gt;much more pliable than these things were out of the box.  Makes the doors
TH&gt;very hard to close.  (WCM)

Well not to differ but I have had great luck with bay window rubber from
WCM and have always received excellent service and support from them,
a friend was not nearly so happy with some Wolfsburg West stuff she
recieved.

I will concur on the stifness part though, particularly for the door
seals,
rear hatch seal from them would simply not work, too stiff to allow full
closure.  Front door seals better.  IMHO go with whomever is listing the
best price and a lifetime warranty as formulation for exterior stuff can
be drastically different even lot to lot.  WCM on my old '76 still
looks great
for current owner has been on the bus 4 years and was bought about 2
years before that if my memory serves me (it doesn't very often)
