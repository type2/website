Subject: Re: Compression Ratios

&gt; Chris Bridge is wondering about compression ratios:
&gt;
&gt; An additional factor you may want to consider in selecting your compression
&gt; ratio is the altitude where you live. If you are living several thousand
&gt; feet above sea level (you are in AZ, right) the compression ratio you 
&gt; mentioned may be appropriate since you are starting with less atmospheric
&gt; pressure. You will probably need to run premium gas and listen carefully
&gt; for pinging on trips to sea level destinations though.
&gt;

No, actually I'm in SW Virginia at around 2000ft.
