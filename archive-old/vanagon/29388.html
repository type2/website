I hope everyone here on the list has a wonderful Thanksgiving Holiday. For
those that will traveling, may you return home safely.

We'll be in our trusty Westy, the one with the headlight relays &lt;g&gt;, for a
couple of nights at Squaw Creek (northern Missouri) watching the geese
migration and the bald eagles. I'll try to get the drawing and parts list
for installing headlight bypass relays out by early next week, it's got to
be pretty don't ya know.

Have a good one and return home safe.
