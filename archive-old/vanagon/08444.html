Hi Murray.  Sorry for not quoting you, but I'm on a VM system here with
limited note editing.

The last Westfalia is a 1994 based on the Eurovan.  For 1995, VW is using
Winnebago for the camper conversion.  Kind of sad.  I'm also a diesel freak
and currently own a 1987 Golf Diesel as well.  The Syncro was only available
with the 2.1 L gas pot.  I average 23 mpg (imperial) with or without a/c on.
Power is adequate for all the driving I do in BC.  The prairie winds are a
challenge, though!  I can't recommend the automatic version in the Vanagon
series... there just isn't enough power with the auto, and it is also prone
to problems out here.  The Syncro was only available with a standard shift.

My wife and I have found too many design faults with the Eurovan Westy design
such as a lack of skylight, the cupboards open down instead of outwards, the
water faucet hose for the sink gets tangled up with all your pots, etc in the
pantry cupboard, very small linen closet, and the table has to be removed and
assembled from under the rear bench every time you want it, etc.  The cab of
the Eurovan is really nice, and efficient, and the handling would be much
improved (front wheel drive).  The Eurovan is available with diesel as an
option (2.5 litre? Audi diesel, with 5 cylinders).  The 1992 Eurovan Westy is
one year to stay away from.  Lots of recalls, even the engines were changed
on warranty, steering columns, bad body integrity (leaks, poor fitting trim).
Know three people with this year, and they are not happy people!  1993 and 1994
are much better.

Off topic a bit here, but we've been to Winnipeg 3 times in the last two years
and have enjoyed our stay each time.  Very friendly, and welcoming city.

Hope this helps, and I hope I haven't offended anybody.

Thx.
Harry
