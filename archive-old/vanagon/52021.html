Subject: Re: Where's rear wiper switch on '87 GL

&gt; Sorry Volks, new to me Vanagon '87 GL and I can't for the life of me 
&gt; figure how to activate the rear hatch wiper. I feel foolish, but I'd 
&gt; rather be able to turn the rear wiper on than live with my pride!

Push the wiper arm forward (opposite of high beam direction). It's 
always intermittent, so you don't look like a Chr*sl*r Minivan with 
the wiper wearing a hole through the glass...

As far as I know, all VWs since the 70s used this same switch 
arrangement.
