&gt; I looked at an '87 Vanagon last night (I'm still a wannabus) and smelled that
&gt; sweet smell when I turned the heat on.  (I think it was mostly from the
&gt; rear heater).  Is this something to be concerned about?
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, it's a 87 GL Wolfsburg with the weekender package, AC, 4spd, 105K mi,
&gt; in excellent condition.  Asking 5500$.

It's not a problem if you don't run the heater.  It's probably a
leaking core.  My 85 has been this way for a bout 3 years.  I just
don't use it.
