&gt; DOH.  I have those in my bus right now.  It's running so well I don't
&gt; think I would dare remove them.  I was planning on leaving them in till
&gt; the engine falls apart.

...well, i've had platinums in my 73\1800 bus for over a year now with good
success. of course, i'm not running leaded fuel in it, noone sells that
anymore. should i be worried ??? i never heard that bit about BOSCH
recommending not to use platinums in breadloafs...that a fact ???
    curious,
            G.
