&gt; yeah!!!! a white lithium grease devotee, i could start a whole thread on
&gt; white lithium grease, right up there with prune juice. ;) the usefullness
&gt; of lithium grease is only limited to your imagination, and lithium grease
&gt; is cheap!
&gt; 
I agree!  I use this stuff to pack my door latches, lube all the 
hinges, and strikers.  It's great :)

Harry.
