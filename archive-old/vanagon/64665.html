Thanks to all for the great rack info.  This EV is my wife's baby &amp; I would
be more than happy to put artificial gutters on the hatch but she might
freak (maybe I can paint them white).  Did you have to remove the hatch
interior panel to attach the gutters?  That must look impressive w/ the
bike &amp; wheel mounts off the back.  You can put your Burley trailer wheels
on the rack, too, if you buy quick release.  The prices are a little higher
but it's great to be able to fold up that trailer. Congrats John if the
babe is new.  I have a 2 &amp; 4 year old that love riding in the Burley.
