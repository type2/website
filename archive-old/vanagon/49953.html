Subject: Re: 85 shifter problems

I've had problems with both the master and the slave. I removed the slaved
cyl. and rebuilt it off the van. It's got one of the bolts that is kind of
hard to get at but it does come out of there. (I have a diesel) The master
cyl was overhauled in the van. Put down something brake fluid proof on the
carpeting and you only have to be a minor contortionist to get under the
dash and replace the seals. My master cyl did not need honing.

&gt;Thanks to you all who sent helpful information to me on my 85 Vanagon
&gt;shifting problems (140,000 and still goining).  Bled the slave cylinder.
&gt;System was fine for about 10 miles, but hard shifting again.  Anyone want to
&gt;share how to change out the clutch master cylinder and the clutch slave
&gt;cylinder? Do you half to remove the instrument panel to change the clutch
&gt;MC? Bleeding proceedure etc.
&gt;I am going to try this first before I tackle the tranny.  I got prices on
&gt;each unit from a low of $44.00 to a high of $205.00. What about rebuild
&gt;kits, is it worth the effort?
