Subject: Re: '66 bus mirrors

the only comment that i would make is that white rubber seals that go
around the outside of the aftermarket mirrors seem to decompose really
fast! (i.e they go from white to ugly brown real fast) anytbody care to
comment on the accuracy of RMMW repro elephant ears?

&gt;I bought an &quot;elephant ear&quot; from Rocky Mountain Motor Works (The Bus Stop).
&gt;So far so good.     christian
