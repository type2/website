Subject: '71 Westy no longer on fire... but still pretty hot!

Many thanks to all who reminded me how stupid I was not to disconnect my ground - 
hey, but without ignorance, how would I make all the stupid mistakes I need to make 
in order to learn?!

Had a great trip up to Cooperstown from NYC this weekend - My SO and I went from 
her present workplace in Roxbury up to Glimmerglass State Park - saw some awful 
minor league baseball, basically had a great time... I'm having some problems with 
overheating, though. Interesting observation - when I'm on the edge of lighting up 
my dipstick temp gauge on the freeway and a big truck flies by, it goes red - the 
wake sucking the air out of my engine? Interesting. 

Had a nice older (mid-70's) gentleman come up to me in a parking lot and say:

&quot;She ain't starting?&quot;

&quot;Naw, she starts, just checkin' the oil...&quot;

&quot;Those d***ed things sure are rugged bastards!&quot;

My sentiments exactly! :)

- Anton
