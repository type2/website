Subject: Portable Sunshower-III with Enclosure

Has any one ever used this thing before?  It is a big bag of water that heats
up from  solar energy that is hung from a high object.  There is also a 
privacy enclosure that can be hung around below the bag of water.  Each of 
these were 19.99
for a total of 40.00 plus shipping. They were in the R.V. Direct catalog.
Any help would be great. Thanks
