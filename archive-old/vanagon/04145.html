&gt; &gt; HA Martha! Not only do I produce more &quot;minutia&quot; than you on this
&gt; &gt; list...but I'm more chronicologically challenged than you (1952)!!
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Ha Ric!  I KNEW you we're a little older than me. (Just ask John
&gt; Ritchie)  I'm circa 1954.  Oh well.  I'm sure Joel could tell us
&gt; stories about when he was a wee lad on the buck-board! ;)
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. chronicologically?????

You knew someone was gonna suggest it, (although you didn't hear it
from me :-), the birth date for each vanagon owner. ANSFJ. (A New Stat
For Joel)
