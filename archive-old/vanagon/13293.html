Subject: RE: Fancy Synchros vs. ?

Ron,

Depends on where you intend to go with this baby.....  If you plan to do a lot 
of skiing or go out to the desert a whole lot, then get an '86-'90 Syncro 
Westie....  If not, then spend your money on a 2wd version and pack away the 
extra change for ammenities you'll use or for the periodic maintenance 
(assuming that you continue to use the dealer) you'll indulge on your Westie.

     Jon

 &gt;&gt; I'd love to have a Synchro but the cost of ownership is beyond my means
&gt;&gt;&lt;sigh&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;amen, brother. amen. :(

Along this thread, perhaps I could get a few opinions from the list.  I've
been saving my money for five years now, hoping to get a VW Camper.  I'm
currently trying to decide whether I want to go cheap and look for a used
camper in great condition, or be patient and await to see what '96 brings.

Though I think that the older busses are beautiful, I'm not a mechanic, so I
think I will shy away from buying one of those.  I'd prefer something that
doesn't require lots of technical maintenance.

If y'all had $30,000 to spend, what camper would get get?  A late-model
syncro?  A late-model non-syncro?  An earlier camper? Or should I wait?
