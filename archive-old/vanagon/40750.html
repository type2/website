Subject: Re: HELP! EV is trying to kill my wife......


Arcing between alternator and block sounds like there is a bad ground 
somewhere in the primary circuit, or between the alternator and the 
alternator and the block. The easiest to check would be the ground cable at 
the battery...check both ends. If you have some 14 gauge wire...run a length 
of it from the alternator case to the engine block.


If this doesn't work....could you let my first wife drive the EV for a 
while?  ;-)
