&gt;I think cruise control would be nice for my '87 Westy. I see them
&gt;advertised (JC Whitney, Canadian Tire) for around $100. This seems
&gt;like a good deal.
&gt;Anybody have any experience with these?

i've installed cruise control on one bus and two vanagons. it's not THAT
hard ... actually, the most difficult part is running the wires from the
engine area and figuring where to put the dash controls.  and it sure does
help you feel more rested at the end of the trip!!!

the brand i used was Zemco, and this is the only fellow i know of that still
sells them. they make some neato trip computers (mpg, mph, time-till-empty,
gallons used, etc.).

let me know if you have any specific questions. i still have my trip computer
installed on my 88 bus (but it has the factory cruise).
