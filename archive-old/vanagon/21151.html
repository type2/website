Woof!  That can be VERY VERY bad.  Remember, Claudius killed Hamlet's dad by 
pouring poison in his ear[1] and it ain't just fiction; you can get bad stuff 
in your blood stream this way.

Be careful out there.

      It's worth keeping in mind that gasoline will enter the bloodstream
directly through the skin! Your skin is porous, this is why you absorb water in
the bathtub and why working with parts dip / gasoline / whatever is DANGEROUS
-- it goes right through you into your bloodstream, no kidding!
