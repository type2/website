Thanks for all of the suggestions. Based on the replies I recieved, I have
images of
most of you driving down the road and whacking the left side of your
instrument pod to keep the speedo going. &lt;g&gt;


BTW: The shop manual mentions a cup holder that was installed on some models.
Does anyone have one of these? Where are they mounted?
