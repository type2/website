Subject: '87 Wolfsburg CVJoint problems

This is about problems with CVJoints, '87 Wolfsburg. 
I've owned vehicle since 11/93. Some history, then my
questions.
 
1/94:   accident bangs passenger rear wheel area HARD.
1/95:   passenger CVJ replaced.
7/96:   flat tire driver rear. Lug nuts not tightened 110
        ft/lb (I didn't replace tire).
8/96:   driver rear wheel comes off on freeway, lug nuts
        all came off.
        (My family LOVEs this car when it is running, I
         don't get to use it enough to check it for months
         sometimes.)
10/96:  passenger CVJ replaced 2nd time (1 yr, 9 mo since
        first time/ 26000 mi).
Now:    driver CVJ clanks (the ususal symptom), but only
        after a loooong, haaard drive on interstates. Quits
        clanking when I get home, after doing city driving
        for 10-12 miles.
 
Now my questions.
Are there inner and outer CVJs on each side (I think so).?
Could the accident on the passenger side and the wheel
coming off on the driver side be contributing to my multiple
CVJ problems? Are maybe something (like axles) bent? Do CVJs
normally wear out? Perish the thought, is Wolfsburg too
heavy for a lot of horsepower going thru CVJs over long
trips (I take 6000 mile trips, like over the Rockies).?
Thanks.
