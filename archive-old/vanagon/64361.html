Subject:      FYI - Passenger door pocket

Shortly after embarking on our first trip in our new '88 Westfalia, my wife
commented that she would really like a 'pocket' on her door like the one on
the driver's side door.  Well, I could understand that right away, 'cause I
liked the convenience of the one on the driver's side.

So I ordered one for the passenger side door.  Upon taking the passenger
side interior door panel off, to install the pocket, I found the panel was
pre-drilled, as I had expected to mount the door pocket.  Ah,,, all is
well, fits like a charm.

It was a week later that I tried to open the glove box (on the passenger
side naturally) with that side's door closed.... Guess what.  The glove box
won't open now with the door closed!

I may be able to make some small adjustments to both to enable enough of an
opening to stuff something in or grab something with a slim hand, but the
clearance is probably the reason why VW didn't put pockets on both doors in
1988.
