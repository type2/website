&gt; Make sure you get it from the earlier-mentioned Reputable Rebuilder.
&gt; I just put the fourth power-steering pump in 3 years in my Mustang, all
&gt; under Kragen's  &quot;Lifetime Warranty&quot;. I've come to realize that, with
&gt; some shops, &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; means you'll spend the rest of your life
&gt; replacing the thing.  &lt;sigh&gt;

This happened to me too, also with a Kragen starter for my 81 Westy.  
After I brought it back the 2nd time they gave me a new, not 
remanufactured, unit.  Sounds like its time to breathe down the neck of 
the manager (if you want to get that close).
