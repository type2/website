Good day Drew.&gt;&gt;

Drew, I've been and seen the syncro referred to by Gary Haxter.

&lt;&lt;          I found an 86 Synchro, 7 passenger, ps,
pb, air conditioning, heated mirrors, snow tires on a set of Mercedes
rims,
new drive axles, new motor 5 years ago, paint job 2 years ago . . .
belongs
to an old man who had a stroke and the gov't took away his license. He
used
it for driving to his cottage from the city.  He is asking $4200
(Canadian)
and he doesn't figure it needs anything to get it certified.&gt;&gt;

This certification is required by the province of Ontario in Canada. It
deals mostly with brakes, exhaust, wheels/tires and steering (safety
stuff).  The van in question would not have passed as I saw it in
August/96 (but he may have had them repaird since then): all four tires
had bad side walls and the exhaust had a hole at the &quot;Y&quot; junction.  The
brakes worked well and showed no leaks.

&lt;&lt;Does it sound like a good deal?&gt;&gt;

The Province of Ontario maintains a price list on most vehicles: a 1986
syncro was listed as $Cdn 3500 in August/86.

&lt;&lt;Were there any problems with the 86's (first year and all)?&gt;&gt;

The engine showed no coolant leaks but did have a bad oil leak from one
push rod seal.

FYI
Larry '86 westfalia syncro
