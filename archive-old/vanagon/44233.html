Subject: CB placement


 I put my CB on top of my dash of my 74 westie.  I bolted the CB support   
bracket through the existing dash speaker hole and use rubber spacers so   
I  wouldn't scratch the dash.  I have a old Cobra LTD CB I got from my   
grandmother and I run the power and Antenna wire into the glove   
compartment.  I use a roof gutter antenna mounted on the passenger side.   
 When I am through with my trip I unscrew the two screws on the mounting   
support bracket and unplug the antenna and power cord and throw them in   
the glove compartment leaving only the support bracket on the dash.  Easy   
to see on the dash.  Erick


&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please   
note &gt;the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.
