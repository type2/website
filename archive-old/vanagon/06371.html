When we first took possession of the Eurovan, I noted a difference in the 
'feel' of the brakes.

After our first 5,000 miles, most of which was accumulated on a long trip 
in very short time, I noted that the brake pedal was nearing the floor when 
pressed hard.

Several trips to the dealer (&quot;the brakes feel fine to me ... etc.&quot;) and 
they finally had to do a serious brake job (warranty work back then) :)

Since then +12,000 miles, I have had no problems.
