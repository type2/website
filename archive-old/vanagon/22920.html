&gt; Seems the word I've gotten is go for the deep cycle to run accessories. I
&gt; haven't had a chance to do so yet but am also curious as to others
&gt; experiences. I noticed that camping world sells a single battery that is two
&gt; batteries in one, a deep cycle and high amp--for posts. This may be the way to
&gt; go if I ever get another gas heater.

I wouldn't recommend buying any type of battery from Camping World.  You
will be paying 200% of retail.  There is no need for a separate &quot;hi-amp&quot;
battery - the deep cycle is just fine for starting gas heaters or any
other load you are likely to put on it in a camper.  If you insist on
running a welding rig from your batteries, you may need a &quot;hi-amp&quot;
battery.  :P

I would recommend getting a pair of 6V Golf Cart batteries to use as an
auxiliary power source.  They will put out more power and last longer
than a typical 12V deep cycle battery such as the Nautilus.
