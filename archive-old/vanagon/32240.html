Subject: Re: Another battery question...

I'm not sure about the '90 model, but in my '87, the battery compartment is
only about 7.25&quot; high. I think that the proper battery type is Group 41.

&gt;I stopped by Sears today and found out that they make a Diehard Gel Marine
&gt;battery that is type 27, 12&quot;L x 6 13/16&quot;W x 9 7/16&quot;H.  Does anyone know if
&gt;this will fit under the drivers' seat in a 1990 Vanagon?
