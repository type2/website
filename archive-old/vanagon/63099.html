&gt; Thanks to everyone's help in getting my water-cooled, rebuilt long block 83.5

&gt; the emissions test?

Not really a &quot;trick&quot;, but one thing I've consistemly read will help you
pass emissions is to have your engine as hot a possible at the time of the
test.  Take a long high-speed run on the freeway just before your
appointment.  If you can, get off the freeway and pull into the
inspection station right at your appointment time, pull into the testing
bay with your engine running and have them perform the test.

As another generality, higher idle rpm's will result in lower emission
results.  You should be able to move your idle rpm's higher in VW's
&quot;allowable&quot; range without having to reset your idle mixture, assuming
it's set correctly to begin with.
