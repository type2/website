Subject: Re: Gas heater (not revisited)

There's another guy out in Colorado BJ's Heater service (or
&gt;something like that) check out the ads in the VW mags.Tho' I've heard some
&gt;negatives about
&gt;him and heard that Art is better.

i have heard negatives about the dude  in colorado too, FWIW i think it is
called JB's never heard of &quot;Art&quot; tho'

and yes i think restored gas heaters are pricey no matter what brand model
or who you deal w/
