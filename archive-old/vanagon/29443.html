&gt; Thanks for the advice, I knew I'd get the low-down.  To Bob (that's Bob
&gt; Hoover, the Bob who has mechanical skill) thanks for the info.  I think I'll
&gt; flush all that nasty half H20/break fluid crap out and get some silicone.

Hi all

What's the concensus on the silicon brake fluid?  Should I flush out
the brakes in the '60 bug and the '72 Ghia and the '77 Westy and replace
the fluid with the silicon-based stuff?

My pal Vince did this with his '69 Vette (my leg's still sore from pumping
his brakes while he bled), and he swears by the stuff.  I hadn't considered
the Bug a real performance braking machine.  It goes well, it stops well.

Whaddyallthink?
