	I don't know how many of the folks on the list have tried to use 
them, but I thought that I would pass along my experience with BFY. 
	I had to replace the turn signal switch in my '71 and while I was 
ordering some stuff for a bug we had, I ordered the switch from BFY.  
When the switch got here it was wrong.  I called and they told me that I 
was mistaken and that it was the correct switch.  I had to convince the 
guy to go and get another on and count the wires to see that it indeed 
was the incorrect switch.  He finally agreed to send a replacement.  
waited and waited, and had to call a couple of times to check on it. I 
kept getting told that it had been shipped and they told me that UPS had 
lost the second one.  He finally sent me another one and believe it or not
 it was the wrong one! (after about a three week wait)  
	I called back and we went through the whole thing again, and he 
told me that it would be a two week wait for the correct one.  I told him 
not to order it, and to send a calltag for the shipping to return the two 
wrong switches.  Meanwhile I ordered and got the switch from Wolfsburg 
West.  Anyway, waited and waited and no calltag, but I wanted my money 
back from BFY so I finally paid the shipping to send back the switches 
and they sent me a refund check within maybe a month.
	I have had wonderful service from RMMW and they have been very 
friendly and knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend them. 
FWIW,
dave.
