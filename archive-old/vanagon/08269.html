Subject: Syncro Westy found! But...

     OK, in less than 24 hours since my possting, I have my first lead. But
     three questions:

     1. This is an 87 with 110,000 miles, original engine. What are
     experiences with engine life. In my '63 Type II I figured a new
     engine every 60,000 miles.

     2. Unit does not have A/C. I live in very sweaty, disgustingly
     hot and humid Washinton DC. How difficult would a retrofit
     be, (hopefully with junkyard parts)? Would I need A/C from a Westy, or
     any Vanagon? Worth the effort?

     3. Its a Canadian vehicle. Any experience with importing into
     the U.S? I know the duty is 2.5%, and the seller maintains that
     an 87 will meet &quot;U.S. requirements&quot;, whatever that means, presumably
     EPA and DOT. I am checking this out with the government agencies
     myself, but wonder if any of you have gone down this path before...?

     Thanks.
