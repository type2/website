Subject: Re: Aux. fuel tanks for Splitties

bob, i have such a tank that i am intending to put an one of my bus's 
sometime in the future.  it came off of a 66 sundial camper a few years 
back.  it sits just below the side cargo doors in the void under the 
floor board.  the PO used strapes to secure it to the bottom (top) of the 
floor.  it is made out of aluminum and from memory is about 3feet x 
1.00feet x 6 inches.  i think the guy said it held 8 gallons of fuel.  it 
has a electric bus gas gage in the top.  the fuel inlet is a 2 inch dia. 
tube that the PO ran up the inside of one of the camper cabinets and out 
the side of the bus about 6 inches in front of the regular gas door.  Ya, 
he cut a hole in the side to do this, ouch.  it has a fuel switch to 
switch from the reg tank to the extra one.  much like the stock reserve 
lever in a early bus.  this runs up to the cab.  it also has a 
vaper/overflow tube mounted on the tank.
	the PO said that it worked well when it was taken care of.  when 
i got it the rubber tubes were shot, but everything else is in good 
shape.  i have not installed it yet because it sticks out below the 
bottom sill of the bus about 2 inches.  looks bad when my bus is trying 
to look bone stock.  if you followed the slope of the outriggers in the 
frame, it would not show and be a very good means of carring extra gas.  
if i get to put it in i will have to find a different way to put the gas 
into the tank.  no way i will cut a hole to put it in.
	hope this gives you some ideas.  if you have any Q's about it, 
feel free to email me and i will tell you what i can.
take care and God Bless
matt
