&gt;I have:

&gt;Replaced Idle Stabilizer
&gt;Replaced Oxygen Sensor
&gt;Installed VW new wire harness to computer
&gt;
&gt;I am getting really frustrated.  It never completely dies just kinda jerks
&gt;around and then comes back on.  Could it be the grounding?  Vacuum???
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I am open for any suggestions - please help..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is turning into the Million Dollar Van.   

i would make sure O2 sensor and circuit works.  Definately check all grounds.
 Especially the one attached at the base of the crankcase breater.  Due to
plastic breater, I would relocate that ground. It is the reference for the O2
sensor circut and it drove me crazy with my van for almost ayear.  I would
also check the temp sensor II and its conection.  This thing can create all
sorts of havoc.
Hope this helps.
Dennis.
