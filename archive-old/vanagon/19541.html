&gt; Wouldn't it be great to rent a raceway for the afternoon and have a few races?

Roebling Road Raceway in Georgia where I flag rents the track starting at 
$1900 a day.  We could get together for that.

I know that some SCCA race events allow people to run their cars, tow vehicles,
etc. on the race track during lunch break.  I have seen RVs trailering race
cars and 18-wheelers take advantage of that.  I don't know about other
sanctioning bodies.

If you are a flagger you also have the perks of driving to your area out 
on track.
