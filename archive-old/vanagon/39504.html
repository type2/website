Subject: Timing Specs

All,

I finally got the timing scale put on my bus, boy it was pinging bad.  I
had gone to put it on monday, but lo and behold either my wife, or her
mother when she was visiting had thrown it away :-( Ordered a new one,
and parked the bus until it arrived, the dealer said we could have it
here overnight for a $32 charge 8-0. &quot;but wait&quot; he says &quot;I have an
overnight order coming in tomorrow, and the person has already paid,
I'll just have it thrown in with it&quot; Done deal.  Checked the timing, and
it was running at 24 degrees VOT TDC(I am going to assume that VOT is
before in german, and NATCH is after, if I am wrong let me know) at
idle!! 8-0 reset it to 7.5 degrees BTDC which is what I think it says on
the sticker in the engine compartment, but I will check it again this
evening.

I do have a question however.  Should I make any adjustments with
respect to the timing considering that this has been converted to a
normally aspirated(love that term) engine vs the fool injection it was
before, or is what the sticker says alright?

Waiting with timed breath,

David
