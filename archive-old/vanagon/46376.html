Now wait a darned second, Bob!  I didn't see a smiley there!

I'm definitely less mechanically adept than my parrot, but I *love* my bus,
and I'm very willing invest the money necessary to let my mechanic care for
it.  Just because I don't have the time necessary to learn the mechanics'
trade, doesn't mean that I will let my bus rot.
