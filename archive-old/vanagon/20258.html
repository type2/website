Subject: RE: Busses by the Arch pictures on the web


_______________________________________________________________________________
Joel kindly sent me a HUGE stack of photos that he took at Busses by the
Arch. I scanned in a few and you can check them out on the web at

http://wuecon.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/bus-stuff/bbta/bbta.html

If there's any interest, I can post more.
