&lt;&lt;  My Good Friend at the Dealer informed me that if the failure happened 
 internally, and the motor wasn't dis-assembled, it's still a good Core!
 
   Well, I had to re-check with him after I had thought about this a 
 while, I now that a few List-Members have thrown Rods out their 2.1 
 engines and have been looking for good cores.  Here's the info you 
 people have been needing to see!  Unless we have inside connections, WE 
 (consumers) don't find out about things like this!!!
 
   I hope this helps someone out in the VW world, I know I'll be using 
 this info at some point.
 
   I'm more fortunate than most to have the connections that I do, but 
 I'm not Selfish with the info that can and will help others.

I guess they want these cores back real bad also as thier core charge is
almost $1100.00.  No, I did not add too many zeros.
