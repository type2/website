Subject: rain &amp; pop-top?

Hello all--

I'm new to Westfalia Camping. Can I leave the pop-top open in the rain? Is it
water-proof? If I do leave it open will it need a long time to dry before I
can close it? I'm particularly frightend of mold.

I'm off on a camping excursion soon and would appreciate any advice on this
topic from those of you seasoned campers.

Thanks
Jeff
