Subject: Re: Help on '57 Bus Purchase!

nice bus but the price sounds out of line for what you are getting. i would
say in my experience, be cold and calculating about what you are getting!
it always seems that you discover all the flaws AFTER you buy the bus.
There is lots of time to fall in love w/ the bus after the purchase. Like i
said just be sure about what you are getting.

Some wquestions you might ask yourself:

Is this your first bus?

Have you worked w/ old Type II's and know their quirks/bonuses etc?

what plans do you have for this bus? Bone stock? Mild custom, totally nutzz
w/ CAl. look, lowering, chrome everything etc?

how &quot;minor&quot; is the rust? it seems you always discover more of the stuff,
upon a closer inspection. All i am saying is don't let your initial
euphoria on finding an old bus cloud your judgement, and pay more than its'
worth.

Just my $.02

&gt;&gt; Out of the blue, a '57 23-window has become available, and I don't know if I
&gt;&gt; should buy it or not.  Here's the scoop:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; '57 23-window.  No major rust, has all the chrome, good canvas sunroof, the
&gt;&gt; original interior, the jail bars, even the original glass tail-lights, etc.
&gt;&gt; No engine.  It is in superb shape.  The guy wants $3500 for it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It needs a new paint job, and brake work. (And an engine.)  I do have my
&gt;&gt; tricked out 1776cc for it though.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is this price in line with the rest of the country (excluding CA, of
&gt;&gt; course!)?
&gt;
&gt;Sounds way high to me, seeing as how it needs paint and has no engine.
&gt;I would let it go, but I guess it just depends on how bad you want it...
