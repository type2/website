&gt; If not toys meant for camping, how about a list of things you all
&gt; throw in when traveling - things not necessarily related to
&gt; camping, or to car parts/tools, etc., but which just make life
&gt; easier?

I can relate to this!  I work at a rather remote location, 60 miles or
so from my house, so I always carry enough stuff to keep me alive for
at least 3-4 days.  I have a sturdy wooden box that my father-in-law
built for me that contains, among other things, freeze-dried foods,
matches, various tableware, nested pots, aluminum foil, coffee pot,
paper towels, toilet paper, fire-starter sticks, and other stuff
that I can`t remember right now.  In addition, the box itself comes
in handy as a tabletop for dining, rebuilding your carb, etc.  I
have used it a number of times as a sawhorse, and as a step to get
to the roof-rack.  I also carry a number of other things:

Lot's 'o tools.
tow strap
2-ton come-along (poor man's winch)
motor oil
gasoline (in approved plastic container)
sleeping bag
rolled-up foam sleeping bag mat (excellent for working under the
car on icy/snowy days!)
tire chains
bag of kitty litter (for traction)
collapsable snow shovel
GI style trenching shovel
ax
backpack stove &amp; fuel
change of clothes
extra footwear
work gloves
binoculars (for watching Bald eagles on frosty winter mornings!)
signal mirror
flares
12v tire pump
odd assortment of car parts, 'cause I have 'em (distributer, fuel
pump, gaskets, oil change kit)
roll of duct tape
bungie cords
reading material

I've probably forgotten to list some things.

Oh, and last but not least, I also carry a Cellular telephone.
Coverage is kind of spotty in this area, but it gives me
peace of mind anyway.
