Subject: re: I'm going to drip mode

Brian,

You may wish to consider a Bodum instead of the manual drip melitta - 
they both make great coffee, but I've found the melitta a bit of a 
pain when camping. I got a Bodum for Christmas (was hoping for a 
Westy... oh well...) - it works great and should save a little space 
also. 

ps: assumes you already carry a kettle or pot to boil the water...

Shawn.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
