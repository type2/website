I recently read SCurtis post about meeting lots of bus owners in CA while
windsurfing. It was god to hear of other Westy owners who windsurf, since
this was one of the primary reasons I bought mine (nothing like being able
to put on a wet suit while standing up... among other things :)

Anyway, I've been thinking about what I'm going to do about getting bars up
top. Is the most common practice to drill and mount bar feet on top of the
pop top, or do most folks use the Thule extral long type legs on rain
gutters?

I've been thinking about drilling into the top and mounting feet but I'm a
little intimidated by the thought of punturing that pop top. I'd love to
hear about how any other fellow windsurfers solved their bar problems (on
the roof of the Westy that is!!)
