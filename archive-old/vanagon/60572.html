I couldn't put it better than Maynard did below.
Go with the 5 speed if you like a manual tranny.
Also, if you think you might ever do any towing,
a manual *may* serve you better without getting
involved in auxilary transmission coolers or any
of that.  I say *may* because the VW auto tranny
is likely very good - they supply it exclusively
now on the EV-based campers coming into the US.

So take the bit about towing with a grain of salt.

Any folks doing a lot of towing with an EV auto tranny
who can share their impressions?

BTW, My EV MV 5 speed's past 85,000 now and going
very strong!

&gt; 
&gt; One of the biggest selling factors to me for my EV GL was the 5-spd. 
What fun
&gt; would it be to drive without one?  At 75k miles, no problems yet.  Shifts
&gt; smoothly, well geared to engine, plenty of power, cruise control holds at
70mph
&gt; uphill.  Every other van on the market in the states is only available
with
&gt; auto.  Get the 5-spd while they're still available on this planet!.
