You're insane.  You're crazy.  You're nuts.

But we already knew that.  We'll all expect a report when you've done it.

If you tow with a real short tow bar, maybe Jeff's bus can draft enough 
to give you kinda-sorta halfway decent mileage.  Well maybe not.  Over 
7,000 lbs and eight tires towed by a high top with 65 hp?
