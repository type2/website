Subject: Re: CV Grease replacements

Two weeks ago I paid $0.64 each for 3.5ounce packs of regular CV joint grease
(the blue stuff) at a Univeral Joint sales company that specializes in
u-joints, cv-joints, shafts, etc. That makes about $1.5 a joint if you use
two packs per joint but at that price I made sure to jam the joint full.  My
VW dealer doesn't bother to carry the regular VW stuff mentioned in another
post--they go to the local suppliers, too, for some reason. Sounds like the
VW stuff is cheap compared to most original VW stuff!
