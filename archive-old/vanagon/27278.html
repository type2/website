&gt;&gt;but someone else (the only other person to call) offered $850. He then
&gt;&gt;proceeded to tell me that he liked me and my wife better than the other guy
&gt;&gt;so he would rather it go to us.
&gt;
&gt;Whattaya think, folks?  Did they reel him in fast, or did he put up a fight?

BTDT,  bought the line &quot;you were able to drive it so much better, we'd like
it to go to you&quot;  Flatter me, pleeease.  For the $100 I got beat out of it
was worth it!  Tim Smith
