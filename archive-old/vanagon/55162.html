&gt; &gt; When I was getting a Peter Russek Manual for the watercooled
Transporter
&gt; &gt;  from VW Books, 
&gt; 
&gt; Peter Russek Manual???  What's this and where can it be obtained??

It is called Volkswagen Transporter Workshop Manual (from 1982 on) Owners
Edition. It is published by Brooklands Books Ltd (again) and Peter Russek
Publications Ltd. The copyright note says it has been compiled from text
and illustrations supplied by Peter Russek Publications Ltd. I have seen
tiny little booklets with fairly basic info called Peter Russek Pocket
Mechanics. This is not one of them, but A4 sized and with 175 pages.

The pictures seem to be a subset of those in Bentley but a lot smaller in
scale. The text seems to be more descriptive than Bentley which is more
procedural. I am not a good one to judge, being a beginner, but I have a
feeling it is much less comprehensive than Bentley in scope. I mean it
is only 9 mm thick compared to Bentley's 45 mm, although the text is
smaller
and more tightly packed and there are less pictures. On the other hand it
covers topics with more explanation, whereas Bentley only tells you how to
take it apart and put it back together.

It is published in the UK, so it has a chapter on carburettors, but it also
has a chapter on fuel injection (Digijet and Digifant). It covers 1.9 and
2.1, auto and manual. There is a wiring diagram towards the back.

It is 15.95 UK pounds compared to 59.95 UK pounds for the Bentley. I got it
from VW Books in Leicester (0044 116 286 6686).
