Subject: Re: Busted ignition lock


&gt;I took the steering wheel off and removed the metal housing that
&gt;contains the lock tumbler assy and the electrical connector.
&gt;I'm having a hard time removing the old busted tumbler from the
&gt;metal housing.  There's a spring loaded 'keeper' in the new lock
&gt;tumbler.  I can't access the spring on the old tumbler to eject
&gt;it from the housing.  This is a major PITA.

I paid a locksmith $20 to show me how to remove the tumbler.  (My
'73 has the same problem.)  There is a small hole on the top side
of the switch cylinder toward the steering column that you have to
push in with a pin to release the tumbler.  So now I know HOW to do
it if I could only DO it.  I have not been able to get a piece of
wire that is both skinny enough and strong enough to release it.
Access to the hole is easier if you drill a hole above it in the
metal housing, but for me this was not an option since mine is in
such good condition.

My short term solution has been disconnecting the switch wires from 
the fuse box and attaching another switch from a 72.  Ugly remedy 
but I can drive it for now, although I now have to carry 2 keys (1 
for steering column lock, 1 for ignition).
