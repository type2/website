&gt;&gt; I've been told that the valves on my 76 van should be adjusted

&gt;&gt; to need adjustment? Do they wear significantly and all need adjustment
&gt;&gt; every 3k miles, or does the adjustment occasionally slip, and ussually
&gt;&gt; most valves don't need changing when you _CHECK_ them, but its bad news
&gt;&gt; when they do slip, so they should be checked often?

&gt;I've never studied the causes around it, but believe me, you will need
&gt;to adjust the valves in your bus every 3000 miles or so.  If you
&gt;don't, you will eventually burn your valves which will require you
&gt;have the heads either rebuilt or replaced.

And now I say:
Robert: So what I understood from your note is that you normally
       have to change all the valves each time you adjust them,
     I also assume that they have all drifted about the same amount.
    If this is true, this would indicate some sort of wear mechanism.
   The 'slipping' case would infer that most valves would be fine, but a few
  would require adjustment, and the adjustment required could be very
 different valve to valve.

 Could the list memebers who have done this often comment on which of the above
cases they would say is the norm?
