Subject: Re: New to list: Need help with 77Campmobile

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;    I have been here for a couple weeks poking around and now I've decided to
&gt;ask for some help.  I have a 77' Campmobile.  I bought it last year in
&gt;disrepair and have been saving to fix it up.  Some of the parts I have
&gt;started looking for.
&gt;      1st.  Exhaust-Including heater boxes.   I found a set sitting in a van
&gt;outside a hardware store this past fall.  I tracked down the fellow who owned
&gt;the vans and he offered them to me for 25 dollars.  I can't express to you
&gt;how excited I was because I had been previously quoted $200ea.  When we went
&gt;out to get them, they had been stolen along with his full-roof roof rack.  He
&gt;was quite bent and so was I.
&gt;      Well, now I am stuck with the delema of not wanting to pay 200 each for
&gt;them since I have just found them for 25.  I could really use some advise on
&gt;the matter.  I was also wondering if they had any sound deadening quality to
&gt;them because I am considering the question of whether or not they could be
&gt;replaced with straight pipes, and if these pipes would pass CT inspection.

I'm assuming yr. prices are from JC Whitney, and theirs are about as cheap
as I've seen for heat exch. boxes &amp; exhaust, unfortunately.  You could try
installing a header rather than the stock exhaust system.  I've done this
on my 79 and it seems to work fine--even gives a tiny bit of extra power.
Plus, the header only cost $119 complete.  I've never looked, but I gather
heater boxes in junkyards (good boxes, anyway) are pretty rare.

&gt;     2nd.  Body.  I really hate body work.  The work this camper needs is
&gt;extensive.  practically the bottom two inches has rotten off all the way
&gt;around.  I haven't yet found skins... the only door track I have found is in
&gt;J.C. Whitney.  I'll admit I haven't started looking too hard but I was
&gt;wondering if anyone could lead me into one direction..   Also,  my front
&gt;wheel wells are rotting.  There is a sections behind the seat about 7 inches
&gt;wide and 4 inches tall.  I believe that it was a slim piece between the
&gt;supports.  I am sort of curious about the risk involved with this project.

Again, JCW's about as cheap as any, tho' there are some places that
advertise in VW Trends, etc. that may have better selection.  As for your
wheel wells, I had a shop cut out the rust &amp; weld in new--seems to be
holding fine so far.

&gt;    I really want this one to reach the road.  It had been abandoned in 1984
&gt;at a garage in Stamford CT. and it runs good!  I also need a lot of little
&gt;stuff like ignition an ignition switch, gas cap, rear window, etc.... the
&gt;list goes on.  This is my third air cooled VW  but the first one which needs
&gt;substantial work.  I have to admit:  I have considered going out and buying a
&gt;camper in good shape for about 2k and keeping this one for parts but I really
&gt;do not want to

I can understand the temptation... but 2k may not get a phantastic body,
though probably better than you have now.  Eeeg!  Orange &amp; green plaid!

Hope this was worth something.
