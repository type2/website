&gt; When people ask about it, I tell them I have retrofitted the Type VII

Is this in the archives?  Where can i get info on these 
modifications?

 I tell them I have an exhaust leak that I need to get fixed
&gt; because the damn Helium keeps building up in the engine compartment making
&gt; the back end light, and reducing my traction.

wouldn't this be offset by the H3O heavy water produced in the 
cooling jacket of the wasserboxer?  don't see it being a problem for 
us water-heads.
