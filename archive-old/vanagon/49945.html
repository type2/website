Subject: Best Westie Years?

Hi, 
I'm sure this question has been asked a thousand times, and I have even
found some partial answers, but not in any detail. I'm also interested in
what years to avoid. Does this exist anywhere? 

I have a '71, and previously owned a '69. I'm interested in getting a
Vanagon, for the greater space. I'm 6'5&quot; and my wife is 6', and we have a 13
yr old daughter that will soon be 6', and two labs.  So the '71 is cosy.
I'm looking at a well-maintained '81,
but it sounds like a year that required a lot of expensive maintenance. 

Hope someone can point me towards this info, must be one of the most common
questions asked.

-Paul
