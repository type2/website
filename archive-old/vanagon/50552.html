Subject: Re: Juddering clutch in 1982 Bus


:
&gt;&gt;When you bring up the clutch the whole vehicle shudders. This happens 1st
&gt;&gt;and reverse, but also in 2nd. In fact it is easier to reproduce it in 2nd.
&gt;&gt;When there are enough revs and take up is slow its OK but when you are
&gt;&gt;trying for a quick getaway in 1st or 2nd its more noticeable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;How do you diagnose whether its a bad clutch or just what happens normally
&gt;&gt;because of the engine mountings?
&gt;
&gt; Hi: The VW mechanic I deal with says he has seen several Vanagons at his
shop with shuddering clutches due to the cross shaft that holds the throw
out bearing being worn so that the throw out bearing is not perfectly square
with the clutch.&gt;
