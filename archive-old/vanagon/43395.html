Subject: generator removal &amp; insallation.. Question

I have a 67 westy I am replacing  the generator in.. I have the generator 
out.

Now my question.. does any know what size socket is needed to take off that
nut on the back of the generator that holds the fan... I have 3/4in sockets
but they are all too small.

When I bought the new generator the leads that the wires connect to are posts
and the old generator has pushdown clips.. any ideas or problems with 
changing the wires, or do I have the wrong generator?

Thanks.. Tim McKane
