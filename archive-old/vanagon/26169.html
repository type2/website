&gt; And speaking of VR6 in vans, I've been poking around under the hood of my EV
&gt; and I think they're going to have to make some major mods to get that thing
&gt; in there.  I know its a compact mill(I had a Passat with the VR6), but the
&gt; EV engine compartment is designed around that 5cyl at an angle. Nothing like
&gt; a Passat or Golf compartment.  I wouldn't be surprised to see either some
&gt; slight intrusion into the passenger compartment or a slightly longer front
&gt; end to accomodate the VR6.  I guess we'll find out next spring!

I thought just the Sharan was getting the VR6?  Are they planning it 
for the Eurovan as well?

Too bad they just don't put the Turbo on the 5-cyl and get it all 
over with.  (I can see the EPA screaming right now...)  That would be 
one bad van!
