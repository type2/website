Subject: Who is Best VW Mechanic in CT?

&gt;Any Connecticut readers here? I'm looking for opinions.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know a VW mechanic that you think is sharp? I'd like to get in
&gt;touch with him.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Can't help you with a good mechanic but I can say =

Do NOT go to People's Auto in Sumers.
They are incompetent.
