Subject: Help, Overheating Vanagon


Hello One &amp; All:

I just finished replacing the head gaskets on my '82 2L, fi, aircld,
Vanagon ( the engine was rebuilt 2 yrs/15K ago, but that's another story).
The vanagon also has an entirely new exhaust system from the cross-over
pipe to the tail pipe.

She is running very well, lot's of power on hills, good acceleration,
purrs at idle, compression is good, etc. There are about 70 post-repair
miles on the vehicle. The last 20 miles were 80% highway, 20 percent
country roads (w/rolling hills). On the highway, I would got up to about
67 mph (testing the engine), but generally drove about 60 most of the
time. When I got home (turned the vehicle off), I noticed small &quot;traces&quot;
of steam like smoke exiting the air intake gills (rear upper sides of
vanagon). I checked the engine compartment, and I thought that everything
was a tad hot including the fan housing, air intake manifolds, air
distributor, tin, etc. It was a relatively cool (low/mid 60's) and partly
cloudy day here in S. Cal.The cooling air flaps in the fan housing are
locked in the open position (the thermostat was removed).

I may just be a bit paranoid about the heat ?, but I've got a lot of time,
effort, and money invested in this Vangon (which I'd like to keep for a
LONG time).

Should I be concerned ? Any other suggestions on things I should look for,
inspect ? related to the &quot;possible&quot; overheating problem.

Cheers, Chris
