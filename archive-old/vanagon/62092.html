&lt;&lt; I'm new to this list. I'm looking for a water cooled Westfalia on the
 west coast. I live in Washington (Seattle area) but I am frequently in
 the Bay area and will make trips into Oregon or towards LA in the next
 few weeks. I would prefer Manual and any color but Gold (Bordeux is my
 favorite).
 I'm new to the watercooled generation and still trying to find out what
 to look for and what to stay away from, so if anyone has too much
 information and nowhere to put it, I'd love to hear it. FYI Most of my
 experience with Volkswagens is cosmetic. I restored a `60 Westfalia from
 the ground up about 7 years ago.
 Thanks

Eric,
Sounds like you could youe a quick summary on watercooled Vanagons. 

The first water cooled ones were diesle models in 1982 that continued in to
1983.  Mid year In 83 VW introduced the &quot;wasserboxer&quot; flat four watercooled
engine.  This 1.9 liter, 82 HP engine powered all USA Vanagons from 1983.5 to
1985.  In 1986 VW improved the cooling system, changed from Digijet to
Digifant fuel injection and increased engine size to 2.1 liters.  The new 2.1
liter, 90 HP engine powered all USA Vanagons from 1986 to 1991, the Vanagon's
last year.  The improvement that came with the 86 model year are really
worthwhile and I'd suggest an 86 to 91 model unless you're budget can't
afford it.

Model wise there are 5 basic models in the 1983 to 1991 period.

Two 7 passenger models are the standard with a forward-facing, 2 passenger
bench seat and the Wolfsburg / Carat models with removeable rear facing seats
behind the front bucket seats.  The standard model was available 83-91.  The
Wolfsburgs were available 1987-1990.  The similar Carat was available
1989-1991.

Two Camper models with pop-tops were also available.
Full camper models had a stove, sink, and refrigerator and seated only 4.
 Most years (all the later ones) these were refered to as the Vanagon Camper
GL and were available each year between 83 and 91.
The standard (or non-GL) Camper models seated 5 including a permanent rear
facing seat behind the driver, but lacked the stove and sinck and some
cupboards.  It made due with a 12VDC/120VAC refrigerator, whereas the &quot;full&quot;
Camper's refrigerator can also operate from propane.  This type of Camper was
available in 1986 &amp; 1987.

The last model was sort of a Carat / Camper hybrid.  It had the 7 passenger
interior layout of the Carat, but also included a pop-top.  This model is
called the Vanagon Multivan and was only available in 1990 &amp; 1991.

Drivetrain wise you can choose between the 4 speed manual, 3 speed automatic,
and 4+low speed all-wheel drive Syncro.  The 2wd manual and auto were
available all years and the Syncros were available in 86, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91.
 Not all models were available with the Syncro drivetrain.

Good luck,
