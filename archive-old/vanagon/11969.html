Subject: Re: Anyone have a Eurovan Diesel?

Rich Jones (RichJ_at_watcom.on_dot_ca) says
&gt;Still haven't test-driven one of these, since they are really hard to find. 
&gt; Neither of the two dealers in Kitchener/Waterloo have one so I'll probably 
&gt;have to go to Toronto to find one to test.  If I do go for the diesel, I 
&gt;wonder what kind of self-inflicted parts hell (availability, cost) I'll be 
&gt;subjecting myself to in 10 years time.  
I have a 1981 audi 5000 diesel.   I have been told that the Eurovan
engine is based on the engine that I have in my car.  The EV engine is
bored out to about to 2.4 liters(from 2.1).   My car has been reliable,
but with usual VW diesel repairs necessary.  (glow plugs every few
years, head gasket at about 100k , timing belts every 60ketc.)  My car
has about 105k on the odometer, but the previous owner says that it
stopped working about 5 years ago(usual VDO guage problems which I am
too lazy to fix).  I bet the Eurovan is a nice rig, but check out the
flat rate hours for maintenance.  I'm not sure that I would want to
change the timing belt on a mid/front engine van.  My audi seems to get
anwhere from about 18-40 mpg, but I drive way too fast.(yes, it is
possible).
