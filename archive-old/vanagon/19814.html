     Well I hate to say this but I got to leave this wonderful
support group for a while at least to get some work done.
This entire list is made up of some of the most wonderful,
talented, knowledgeable, people I have ever had the pleasure
of chatting with (even the ones that drive EV's).  People
willing to accept even me, the intigator of the great ***avan
flame war between Leo and Ric (still not my fault I maintain).
It is truly amazing that a VW split/loaf/vanagon/EV owner
can turn to such a wealth of entertainment and information
with usually only a modicum of light hearted ridicule.  I hope
to have the chance of meeting some of you in person some day.
     Sorry to waste the bandwidth, if anyone needs to contact me
for any unlikely reason my address will remain as before, and
if someone could keep me informed of any East Coast meetings
I would be grateful though finding the time for them will
probably be hard.  Anyone travelling through WV, if you see
an all white '71 Westy with large primer spot on the nose
covering deer damage, please wave, I will wave back.

PS. Joel please remove me from the stats I guess, there has been
another WV person recently anyway taking up the slack.
