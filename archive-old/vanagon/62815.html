Hi Everyone, 

     I'm an avid list reader but seldom write.  I'm hoping there is an
enthusisastic list member who would like to give me a tour of my Westfalia.
I have a &quot;new&quot; 84 Westfalia GL.  I'm more familiar with Air cooled.  Being
legally blind a lot of obviouse things are a mystery.  If anyone is near
Ithaca NY, actually Groton, I would love a tour of my own car.  Also
intereiste in eventually gaining the skills to do all usual maintance.   
        Anyone interested?  
Eric
84 westfalia GL Wolfsburg
