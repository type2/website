Subject: RE: need part suppliers numbers

Hang in there with your bus.... I went thru a few Ups and dOWNs when I first
got my '65.  Transform's number is 310-435-2966.  I got my transaxle from them.
Careful they'll keep trying to sell you more stuff (add ons, etc.)  Also you 
might want to try Barrett Enterprises at 818-967-5171.  I see they have axles
in their add in hot VWs......
good luck
