Subject: WANTED: RESTORATION PROJECT!!


Hello everyone!

I was just about to make a deal on a '60 Kombie... the guy bailed on me.
I am ready to put forth my time and effort into restoring a '65 or earlier
Transporter (emphasis on earlier).  Does anyone have a dead project 
available?  I am located in California (Bay Area) and don't want to travel
farther than the moon to get a good deal.  Note:  I was willing to cough
up $2700 on the '60 Kombi that needed 50% more 12V conversion, a headliner,
completely new welded in floorboards, and some serious front end body work.
Hence, I am gullible but I REALLY want an old Transporter!
