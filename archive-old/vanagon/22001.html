&gt; 
&gt; I saw  white Eurovan Westfalia this evening. I had seen this before,
&gt; went to a local dealer to inquire about it, and was told there were
&gt; no Westfalias imported since the Vanagon. Anyway this one had the
&gt; pop top, two rear facing bucket seats behind the driver and passenger
&gt; seats, a swing out table, and a three passenger rear seat. It pulled
&gt; into a parking lot, so of course Ihad to follow it in and check it out.
&gt; Glad I saw it again, cause that dealer had me convinced I had seen
&gt; an Unidentified Driving Object.
