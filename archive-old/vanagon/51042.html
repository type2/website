Just a thought but when my 84 did something similar, it would run for a while, 
hesitate then die it was because the main seal was leaking,   Oil was getting 
in somewhere and my plugs would foul.  I'd clean the plugs and drive for 
another 1/2 hour then it would smoke and die.

Just a thought,

Bryan

&gt;&gt;My 84 hi-top seems haunted...I drive along for 10-15 minutes, the boheamoth
&gt;&gt;stalls, no power. Crank it over and over, lots of blue smoke (oil pulled up
&gt;&gt;into cylinders by trying for a restart while going from 65 to zero?).
