&gt;  1)Its a bunker-burner, and people can't stand the diesel exhaust
&gt;  2)People can't see over or around it. I actually see them driving
&gt;    straddling the double yellow line in my side mirror.
&gt;  3)People get *very* frustrated over slow acceleration. (Hey, I make
&gt;    it to &quot;speed_limit+5&quot;, but it takes a little while to get there)

 4) all of the above and more :-)

 There are some real idiots out there. Just have to get out of the way, I
think, and let them have their accident with someone else.

 Another point that some people miss is that in a bus you are about 3' higher
than everyone else, and can see much more. Often this means you can see
overtaking opportunities that others can't. I was driving my folks '88 panelvan
(turbodiesel) at the weekend and passed a whole series of &quot;low&quot; cars waiting
in queues of traffic (including a VR6 Corrado and a Porsche 944 :-) because
they couldn't see the road ahead to overtake.

 Just wait'll I get my flat six... :-)

Cheers,
        W.
