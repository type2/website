&gt;&gt; Halon is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Highly effective,
&gt;&gt; non-toxic, non-conductive, puts out ANY fire (gasoline, wood,
&gt;&gt; electrical), no residue, doesn't harm the thing you're spraying it on
&gt;
&gt;_Any_ fire?  What about magnesium?


Sorry, I stand corrected.

Probably wouldn't help much with a lit stick of dynamite, either.  :)
