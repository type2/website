&gt;&gt; Sears (is anyone cringing) offered tires (195 SR 70 14) manufactured by
&gt;&gt; Michelin, wearing their name &quot;Guardsman Plus&quot; for $44 a piece.  They are
&gt;&gt; double ply tires with a polyester cord, a wet traction rating of &quot;A&quot;, a
&gt;&gt;Temp
&gt;&gt; rating of &quot;B&quot;, tread wear of 320 (50,000 miles according to the associate).
&gt;&gt;  They fit the specs for Vanagon Syncros in the tire book Sears uses.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The associate offered the tires on sale for $41 a piece and if the payment
&gt;&gt; was on credit, an additional 10% off.  Total price - $161.00 including
&gt;&gt; mounting, balancing is $8.99 each tire.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I bought them with the knowledge that they can be returned if I'm not happy
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any input?????

It was interesting to note on the grand trip to Inuvik this summer that
flat tires occurred almost without exception on passenger tires; as I
recall, only one truck tire (Uniroyal Laredo) had a flat.
