Subject: Battery for 87 Vanagon
Date: Fri, 16 May 1997 07:11:56 -0700

I'm thinking about replacing my current battery with a Sears Die Hard.
A friend of mine told me that it would not fit in my 87 Vanagon saying
that it's too big.  I called Sears &amp; they say they have an Die Hard
&quot;International&quot; (800 cca/maintenance free) that would fit.  Anything
true to it not fitting properly?  And, what sort of life-span should I
expect out of it?
