Subject: Re: Vanagon A/C 


I've had two versions of A/C, the first in an '84 that I drove for 9 
yrs, and the second in the '90 I'm currently driving. To make a 
potentially long story short, the piece of crap in the '84 was a 
leaky, noisy rattletrap that hardly helped cool the air at all, even 
on its best days. It wanted to leak R12 freely from a variety of 
places in the system, and had to be reattached to the roof on a 
number of occasions. It stunk!   In contrast, the slick unit in the 
'90 Wolfsburg works great - its relatively quiet, and manages to 
cool the cavernous interior with no problem, even on those dasterdly 
days when I have to drive the freeways to Los Angeles, and its 95F, 
smoggy and stop and go for ever. I guess the German engineers 
finally took it seriously.
