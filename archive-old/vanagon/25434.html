Subject: Just joined the criminally insane...

Howdy from Tejas!  I guess I joined the criminally insane group (owners
of two or more busses ;-) ) this weekend by picking up a '79 Westy.  Other 
than the non-working gas gauge and the crack across the top of the windshield,
it's in excellent condition.  That makes two '79's for me (boy did the
insurance 
company get confused).  Anyway, in addition to adding this new one to the 
stats, I have a couple of questions about it.  

1. How do you get &quot;sports stripes&quot; off without taking the paint with them?

2. Could someone who has installed either a second battery w/ solar panels
  to recharge it (Sami maybe?) or a power converter for 120 VAC to 12 VDC 
  to power accessories when at a campground w/ hookups e-mail me privately
  about your installations.  I want to put in a fridge at some point (it has
an icebox),
  but want to do the electrical work first.  

Also went the the Big Bug Shootout in Ennis, TX.  It was pretty cool though I
was hoping to see some more innovative additions to the campers (so I could
get some ideas).  The parking lot and watching a bus beat out a Karman Ghia
in the drag race were the most fun.  Till later...
