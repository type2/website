Subject: Transporter Ute

This was lifted from the 'Geelong Advertiser' Sat Dec 3.  I'm not sure whether
this is really new from the factory or a local beat up of a Transporter version
that may already available in Europe/US/Canada.......

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'GERMAN car producer Volkswagen has decided to target Australia's rural
community in a bid for increased sales of its Transporter range.

  The company has produced a ute version of the Transporter based on the
chassis cab model which is priced at $27,490 for either a petrol or a diesel
version.

  It will offer farmers and the like the chance to tailor a vehicle around
their particular needs with the front wheel drive layout allowing for a variety
of tray-top designs.

  The Transporter has played a key role in the resurgence of Volkswagen sales
in Australia this year with more than 700 sold in the 10 months to the end of
October compared to just 155 over the same period last year.'

Sorry no pix.  Gees diesel and front wheel drive?  The next thing you know the
engines wont be air cooled anymore ......
