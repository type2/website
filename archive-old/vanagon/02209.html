&gt;These are interesting results and would seem to confirm David's
&gt;assumption, 87 RON AMOCO and SHELL do seem to offer slightly better value
&gt;for the money..still it would be interesting to compare with an aircooled
&gt;which has slightly less power over all. Wouldn't the differences between
&gt;RON's be magnified when an engine is weak to begin with
(especially going up hills?)

meaning that a higher octane would help up the hill more than a lower one?
or would the higher octane simply aggrevate any compression losses (by
raising compression)?

but what i get out of the data is that it isn't worth the extra effort
(or the extra money, in the case of AMOCO 87 ... those so-and-so's charge
extra for using a credit card! as does EXXON) to pick a single gas and try
to stick with it. especially around here (with only the three suppliers).
it would be interesting to see what results might be obtained in a large
city (like atlanta, san francisco, etc.) where you might range over a wide
area to buy gasoline. but my bet is that humans are creatures of habit and
tend to buy gasoline in a relatively small area. when i lived in atlanta,
almost all my gasoline purchases were within five miles of each other. just
habit: on the way home, fill up for tomorrow.
