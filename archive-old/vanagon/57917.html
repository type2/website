Subject: the one that got away





Just thought I'd share my grief to the list on the one that got away.
There was a 1990 Westfalia in the Dallas paper on Saturday, I called on it,
but it had already sold that very morning.  I asked the sellers what it
went for, the sellers got exactly what they advertised for it, $6400.  Oh,
to have acted at the crack of dawn!
