&gt;about this?

The Goodfellow metals catalogue has a hazard listing beside many of its
Magnesium products of HF and a flame.  The hazard symbol description reads:
Highly Flamable - Solids which ignite after contact with flame, or evolve
highly flammable gasses in contact with water.


Back when I was in the volunteer fire department (15 years ago) I guess
that is why they told us to never put water on a VW bug if if was on fire.
