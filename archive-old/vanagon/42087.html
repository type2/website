Well I clipped the VW section out of the Omaha World Herald paper.  
Although there is only one bus listed, it's still worthy.

VW '72 BUS - Californian - No Rust - Runs Good - $1850 - 402-493-4993

And I can't post this ad on the aircld list but for those of you who like 
bugs as well:

VW 1956 oval window bug, runs, $750
402-392-1562

The rest are Super Beetles (some listed as no rust) and a convertible or 
2.  If you want the whole listing, I['ll type it in and send it to you.

Thanks for reading.

BTW:  I was told of a 1978 bus that a guy has for sale about 15 miles 
south of me.  He wants $100.  It is drivable however, the kid that bought 
it had to give it back cuz &quot;he couldn't get a title for it.&quot;  If there is 
a will, there is away.  The only thing I can think of that would make it 
impossible to get a title is if it was stolen or if there was a lein on 
it and there isn't.  I think it's simply a lost title in which case a bit 
of private detective work and some cash would itron this puppy out.  I 
know cuz I did it before with a bug I got from the salvage yard.  Took me 
a month but by damn I did it! Okay, enough for now.  I'll post the 
results of the bus hunt as I don't have room for it even if I did buy 
it.  I hope someone can rescue it if it ain't in that bad of shape...
