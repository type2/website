Subject: Identify address of sender
Date: Fri, 29 Sep 95 12:47:00 PDT


There was a recent message about changing settings in Windows to prevent the 
address of a message sender from being stripped from the message.  How do I 
access the archives and revisit this message?  I'd like to be able to 
respond directly to a message sender (when it's most appropriate), rather 
than bothering the whole mailing list.  Thanks in advance...
