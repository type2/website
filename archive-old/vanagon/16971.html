I have done this, but I recommend that people use the gopher instead. I 
also got rid of the uncompressed versions of these files.  If you need to
uncompress them, you should be able to do so with gzip.exe in the archive 
directory. (if someone has a Mac utility that does this, I would 
appreciate them sending it to me so i can add it to that directory too.)  
Also, I won't be renaming ALL the files in the directory 
above that.  Anyone who wants to volunteer to index and rename these, is 
free to do so  and contact Joel or myself with your suggestions.
