In response to Dr Rufo -

I assume you mean the lowered springs optionally offered on the 88-91
Vanagons?  Don't know the measurement off the top, but we just received a
shipment from Germany of these from the MFR yesterday and we're in the
middle of repacking them for stocking and customer backorder shipment. 
I'll be happy to measure them tomorrow and get back to you on it.  We
sell them in matched sets of 4, Front/Rear and they lower the 80-91 2wd
Vanagon 45mm (1 3/4&quot;) from regular stock height.  Price is $495 per 4 pc
set (as opposed to about $1200-$1300 from VOA for the same 4 springs) -
Our Part Number is 250-41000.  See the propaganda on them at
http://bus-boys_dot_com/bbsusp.htm

We are looking at a very nice mild cam for the Wasser from a friend of
mine who does cams.  Claims to give a little better bottom end torque but
don't know the Calif Smog ramifications just yet - we're waiting for data
on that before we commit the bucks to offer it.  Another very
knowledgeable friend of mine who has a 78 Westy with about the same
duration and lift on his says he loves it most of the time on the road -
hates it when he has to pass the smog test every two years (lives in
Santa Barbara) - it's a real bitch he says.

I've heard that there are larger displacement kits for the Wasser
available out of Oettinger (sp?) but they've been reported at very LARGE
$$$$.  Can the existing Digifant cope with it?  Dunno - have to find out.

My 2 cents worth
