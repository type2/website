I thought about doing this too, but I didn't want to be the only van
there, cause, well... let's just say I didn't.  But, if anyone else
wants to drive down to Carlsbad sometime, we can race for $15 each, as
many times as we want, or until we annoy the officials by leaking oil
on the track.  :)  I always wanted to find out which is longer, my 1/4
mile time or my 0-60 time...
