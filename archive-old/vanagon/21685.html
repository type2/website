Subject: Flickering Fuel Gauge ('66)


'K

My gas guage is *reasonably* accurate, but my only concern is that it flickers.
It reaaaaaly likes to flicket and seems to do it for various stimuli.

It luuuuuuves to flicket for direction signals.

Oh, oh, and for pressing on the gas pedal.

Sometimes it even does it for no reason at all!

I think this may by part of a general problem with the car 'cause I used to
have a cigarette-lighter-plug-in-cell-phone that was very noisy in that car,
but perfect in my Honda.

I haven't hooked up a radio yet but I'll put money on the fact that it
won't be clear.

Any pointers would be much appreciated.
