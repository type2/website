&gt; Anyway... on to the problem:
&gt;
&gt; Our 84 Vanagon has had the same starting problems as one of the other list
&gt; members has described over the last few days. Most of the time, it starts
&gt; just like it should, but once in a while (once every couple of weeks?) All
&gt; of the normal indicator lights come on, a &quot;whirring&quot; noise is heard in back
&gt; (a fuel injection pump?) but no starter, no solonoid, nothing.

FWIW, same thing happened to me.  Replaced the switch, no help.
Sometimes had to crawl underneith and start with a screwdriver on the
starter solenoid.  Of course, it worked fine when I got it to the
mechanics.  One mechanic put a little booster box on it that helped for
a while.  After a few more episodes with the screwdriver I put a starter
button on top of the battery case and ran a wire directly to the
solenoid.  The switch still works when the whether is cool and dry, but
as soon as things heat up we are back to using the button.  I think the
wiring is going bad.  Notice the harness takes a tight 180 degree turn
around metal near the engine.  Wire could be slowly parting there.
That's my best guess.
