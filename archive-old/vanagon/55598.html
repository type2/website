&gt; You will need to get a special (ie expensive) set of lug nuts (and bolts if
&gt;  not a syncro) for the alloys. Weren't alloys a dealer option? It's hard to
&gt;  imagine that they would have to replace the studs to install the optional
&gt;  wheels. 

These were a factory option.  Dealers could of course play some games adding
different wheels and switching the factory wheels from one van to another.
 Dealers could of course get wheels from the parts department and add them to
a van, this would cost a near fortune though.
