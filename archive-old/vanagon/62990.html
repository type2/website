&gt;We just bought a 84 Westy and are very pleased with it.

&gt;It is in great condition, but after our first trip, we
&gt;are finding some things that we want to add or change.
&gt;
&gt;The big item is an Aux Battery.  I looked around a bit and
&gt;so far have not found any battery that is short enough to
&gt;fit in that small space.  I assume that VW sells one but have not
&gt;checked the cost yet.
&gt;Does anyone know of a good source for a battery that would fit?
