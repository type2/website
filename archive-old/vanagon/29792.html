Subject: Setting Waterboxer valves (again!)
Date: Wed, 29 Nov 95 07:49:31 +0000 (GMT)

Hi.
Thanks for all the replies - they enabled me to figure out what the problem
was (partially) and so I was able to start the bus this afternoon.
I figured out that the valves were lifted off the seats even when the
cylinder was firing at TDC.  This of course resulted in no compression on
any cylinders.  As far as I can tell though, the valves were set exactly
according to the Bently manual.
On advice from list members, I backed out the adjusters to the point where
the rocker just touched the valve stem (zero lash?).  I then started &amp; ran
the bus for several minutes - sounded as good as usual.
Trouble is - it does not seem like a good idea to now adjust the valves 2
turns in from this point - this will surely lift the valve off the seat and
possibly result in burned up valves!  So what shall I do?  Can anyone
explain how the hydraulic lifter works?
On the other hand, my Vanagon no longer leaks any coolant and perhaps more
important, the inner workings of the wasserboxer are a lot less mysterious
to me!
Cheers,      MIKE
