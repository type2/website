Subject: curb weight of 73/74 westy

anyone ou there that can tell me the approx weight of a 73/74 westy? 
(with out a carb) since it seems i'll have to tow it home, and wondered 
if i could use a friends truck w/ the tow dolly from uhaul i will rent to 
tow my 74 super here from my mom's house..of course, my friend claims his 
s10, w/ 4 cyl motor wont pull it..(odd since that 4 cyl is probably 
bigger than the one in the bus..:)  or maybe i could use my roommates 
jeep, w/ straight 6? 

ideas?
thanks.
