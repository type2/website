Subject: tent for back

Hi all,
	Lots of people asked about the tent I am getting for that family 
van I am having converted to a camper in San Jose:
	Thought I'd let you know what I found out about that tent.  It is 
the Eureka tent that goes over the back of SUVs.  It is very nice.  It is 
a square 9'6&quot; x 9'6&quot; tent.  It is 7'9&quot; tall.  It is called the AVT (all 
vehicle tent --get it?).  It sleeps 4-5 and weighs just under 25 lbs.  It 
has the nylon in the poles so it one of the quick risers.  It comes in a 
bag and is about 3' x 9&quot;.  Basically, the rear hatch opens up and drapes 
over the entire rear hatch of the VW and provides another &quot;room.&quot;  Seems 
very handy but I haven't used it yet.  Also can get a net enclosure for 
the other end if you need a &quot;porch.&quot;  ;)

I paid $325 but didn't shop around.  Hope this helps someone...

Let me know if y'all have questions

Thad
