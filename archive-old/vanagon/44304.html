Subject: Any good Camping sites near Santa Cruz/San Francisco?

	My wife and I will be taking a 3-week cross-country trip 
starting Aug. 30.  We bought an '83 Westy (sight unseen!) in Santa 
Cruz, which list member Kyle at Volks Cafe has checked over and is 
storing for us.  We will fly there from Philadelphia on the Friday 
of Labor Day weekend.
	I am trying to locate a campsite somewhere between Santa Cruz 
and San Francisco that we can reserve for the holiday weekend. Even 
this early, some are booked up, and others don't take reservations. 
We were hoping for something a little more picturesque than an 
asphalt RV park, but cost is also an issue. (I guess I'm spoiled 
here in the East, where most state parks are $8-$12 a night. Some 
of the sites out there are $25 or $35!  You could get a nice hotel 
room for that much around here!)  Half-Moon Bay State Beach looked 
good, but they don't take reservations and they tell me they'll 
certainly be filled by that Friday because it's a holiday weekend.
	Have any list members camped in that area?  Can you recommend 
a nice camping facility?  All I have is the AAA camping book, and 
I'm not finding a whole lot in that area.
	Any input would be greatly appreciated!
