I saw this on Spring tour in Charlotte NC

&gt; Didn't buy one out of various karmic concerns (ask and ye shall receive),
&gt; but looking at the state of the busses being driven by most Deadheads
&gt; (primarily extremely tired mid-70s campers, only saw one decent splittie),
&gt; it seemed spot on appropriate.

I agree about the karma, but I do have a VW/Grateful Dead tshirt that 
says&quot;FarFromMovin': If you've owned a Volkswagen you've experienced it&quot;.

But really Paul, everyone doesn't own busses to dump lots of money into 
them or do a full resoration - many still own them because they can 
maintain them themselves and they are great vehicles to live in

And there are many nice vans in the lot at Dead shows - I've got pictures 
to prove it!

Fukengroovin' !!

  Ya, I liked most if not all of the Transporters I saw in the parking
  lot, and sighed wistfully as we zipped past at least half a dozen
  Westys on the way to Las Vegas in the Maxima (typical soulless
  Japanese sedan). Got a GREAT sticker, the VW emblem made out of bones
  with 13 happy cartoon transporters zooming around its circular
  permimeter!!!! Scanned it in, printed it out, have it on the wall
  of my cubicle... makes me happy to look at it!!!!

  My opinions do not reflect those of Rockwell International (since they're
  a bunch of fun haters and wouldn't know a cool ride if it was parked on
  top of them)
