&gt;
&gt;I've had synthetic fluid in the tranny of the '87 now for about a
&gt;month and thought i'd give a report.
&gt;
&gt;(SNIP)
&gt;
&gt;The real difference:  Shifting HAS improved (no, really, i mean it).
&gt;Before, after the van fully warmed up i would have to kinda smack the
&gt;gearshift knob to get it out of a gear.  Not real hard, mind you, but
&gt;it was sticky.  Now, it releases from each gear smoothly.  THAT is
&gt;the most noticable change.  No leaks so far (fingers crossed).  Cold
&gt;weather shifting hasn't been put to the test.
&gt;
&gt;Was it worth the hassle and $28 bucks. yes.
&gt;
&gt;What someone needs to do is to replace whatever aged gunk is living in
&gt;their tranny (aged gunk? not us on vanagon-L, no, no, no, no, no, no)
&gt;with
&gt;brand spankin' new organic (as oposed to synthetic?) lube and give it the
&gt;shiftin' test. Then, drain this and replace with synthetic.
&gt;
&gt;Now at this point, is any difference observed?
&gt;
&gt;Better yet, get a friend of a friend to do the changes so you don't know
&gt;what's what (and as a side bonus, they get to squirt lube all over
&gt;themselves instead of you).

I have had a similar experiance with synthetic tranny fluid in my 82 Vanagon.  
I even threw in a bottle of teflon treatment and I like how much better 
shifting feels.   However, I have heard that synthetic engine oil is not good 
in air cooled motors ---- does anyone have an opinion on this?
