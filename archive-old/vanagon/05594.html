&gt;As the title says, the speedo on my '81 Vanagon is sticking...it's pretty
&gt;strange seeing it read 55mph while I'm stopped at a light... :-)  I'm
&gt;wondering if some WD-40 sprayed into the area where the cable comes in
&gt;the back might free it up, or should I also spray in the front
&gt;on the needle axle.  Is WD40 the
&gt;best type of lubricant, or should I use graphite or something?

i used some graphite cable lube. you'll have to remove the 'instrument pod'
cover, then remove those four screws holding the pod to the dash. then you
can unscrew the cable from the back of the speedo and get at the end of the
cable end rather easily. on my old 80 bus, i did take the wheel end loose,
but it turned out i didn't need to. just the lube in the top end solved the
problem.

it's a bit of a bear to get the cable started back on correctly, though. ;)
it always took me about three or four tries ... cause i couldn't see too
well.

good luck.
