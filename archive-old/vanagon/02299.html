Subject: Re: gasoline differences

Here's something else to consider regarding gasoline differences:

In the 1980s, a change was made in whatever regulations apply that no
longer required a gas station displaying a brand sign, e.g., Shell,
Exxon, Mobil, to sell that particular brand of gasoline. This means
that the consumer has no idea what brand of gasoline is being sold by
a particular station. Product differentiation, such as it is, in gasoline
is now a matter of octane ratings and additives. We all know that some
gasoline companies offer an unusually high octane gasoline, some offer
an &quot;economy&quot; grade, etc. As for additives, these are highly guarded
secrets of each company, and are added at each station in its storage
tanks rather than in the delivery trucks. I suppose if you believe that
additives make a difference in mileage, then it's worth comparing.

For what it's worth, I pick where I get gasoline based on whether or not
I've ever picked up water with the gas, cost, location, and attitude of
the employees.  I've never seen any appreciable difference in mileage,
but then again, I don't keep records like Joel, either!  Oh yeah, since
the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, I haven't knowingly bought Exxon products.
