&gt;Hello all.
&gt;* It starts, idles runs fine at first.
&gt;* Drive it on freeway/highway, and get the engine warm/hot.  
&gt;* Stop at stop light.  Idles fine.
&gt;! Hit the gas pedal to take off, 90% stall, 10% barely runs.
&gt;! Now it takes 20 seconds of constant turning over, at full thorottle 
&gt;  to get it to start.  Pumping pedal does nothing.
&gt;* Barely cranks up, and runs, and then it roars to life, and you 
&gt;  are just fine, like nothing ever happened... Until the next 
&gt;  stoplight!!! 
&gt;  
&gt;On separate note:
&gt;* Drive, get engine hot.  Turn off engine.  Takes 20 seconds to re-
&gt;start it, per above description.

Does it have a hard time holding an idle?  Have you checked the idle cutoff
solenoid when this happens - that it is both tight w/o an air leak and will
'click' if you take the wire off and on?  Also, I'd check that the idle jet
on the right side is clear and tight, although this would just be an idle
problem.

Is there an electric choke on the carb?  Is it open completely when warm?


&gt;Friends suggestion: The fuel pump is getting very hot, and is 
&gt;vaporlocking, hence the 20 second start up time.

Heat wave in Utah, already?

I have had more problems with the intake getting too cold.  Can you see fuel
in the clear $1.00 filter that you probably have between the filter and carb?

&gt;He suggests an electric fuel pump.

Swapping out the motor will work too &lt;g&gt;.  You can always do the coke bottle
fuel pump test when it isn't starting - or use a mirror and look down the
carb and see if you can see the accelator pump squirt gas.  Standard fuel
pumps seem to work quit well, so I wouldn't run out any buy a electric -
besides, some electrics can pump past the bowl valve.
