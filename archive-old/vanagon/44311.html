Subject: Fuel gauge sender question ('66)

Hi all,
	While my tank's getting boiled out (13 year old sludge) I'd like
to know if the sender is any good (sitting in 13 year old sludge).  Is
there any way of testing it before I reinstall the whole tank?
	Bonus question:  Does anyone know where I can get a headlight
glass cover?
	Thanks in advance.
-Erik.
P.S. Oh yeah, it's in a 1966 Westy.
