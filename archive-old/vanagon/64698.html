&gt;I have had it! I need a good reliable vehicle and I have been through this
&gt;for 6 mos. The fuel mixture is still not right. I had 2 weeks for this
&gt;particular problem to get resolved. I have the john muir book, and the
&gt;hanes.............

I've had the same problem before!

I took it to the local VW shop and here is everything they tried

Timming
O2 sensor
O2 Sensor wire **Seems the wire can have a small crack and cause problems
All ground wires redone
Both Computers replaced (I did'nt know there were 2?)
Coil replaced
Spark plug wires  ** seems only OEM parts recomended
Spark plugs
and checked the fuel injectors

THE Only thing they did'nt replace was a new wiring harness.


Oh by the way NONE of these worked, many $$$$ later!  My wife reamed the
Shop manager.
They aploagized. I refused to be a testing ground, and told them to put
back all the
parts that did'nt fix it (Many hundered dollars worth).  VW said don't
bring it back with this problem again.

6 months later it went away???!!!! It's the Vanagon mystery.
