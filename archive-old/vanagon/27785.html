Subject: strange noise

Over the last few weeks I have noticed a noise which I THINK is coming
from the fan in my 79.  The noise ONLY occurs when it is raining or it
has just rained and the bus sat overnight.  The noise is like a bearing
rattling around somewhere behind the fan(could it be the crank)
When the noise is present, the bus acts no differently.  The noise will
go away after I drive on the highway or rev it at high speeds.
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Paul
