&gt;&gt;of them, they WILL make them. said it would take about six weeks to get the
&gt;&gt;specs, gear up, and fit it into the schedule.  the 20 units is the minimum
&gt;&gt;order for special stuff.
&gt;
&gt;Joel,   was this offer for mufflers only, or would they bend up SS tubing
&gt;into the 3 pieces we need, from cyl. heads to catholicperverter?

he spoke of &quot;systems&quot;, so i'm assuming they will make the whole thing IF
they have enough orders.

&gt;And... question # 2) Does the 2.1litre exhaust system fit on the 1.9 litre?

that i don't know. as regards vw's history, it probably doesn't. :(

&gt;         And further more... anyone else ever seen stainless steel J-tubes?

that would be something to ask the guy at borla. they might decide that, for
a small extra fee, they would make that also ... i mean, it IS just a sort of
pipe. and people like Midas claim to be able to make all sorts of stuff like
that.
