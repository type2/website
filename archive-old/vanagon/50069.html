Subject: '83.5 wasserboxer exhaust parts sources

Looks as if my being rearended has hastened the need for exhaust 
repair. To make a somewhat long story somewhat short, the PO installed 
a one piece welded system (I mean ONE PIECE) at some point and I now 
have to replace the catalytic converter, muffler, and appropriate pipes 
as they were damaged in the accident (thank god for uninsured motorist 
coverage!).

So, any advice at all would be appreciated. Especially parts sources, 
new vs. used, replace the whole thing, etc.

Thanks,

tony
