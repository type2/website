Subject: Need help deciphering Bentley/Brakes

        Well I must say that my newly purchased Bentley manual is quite a
fun book, if one can use that saying when refering to technical manuals. :)
I got it about 3 days ago and have spent alot of 'bathroom' time reading up
on stuff.

        First off I looked at the info on my brakes. I had changed the pads
myself sans manual about 2 weeks ago, and they've now started squeeking. In
the bentley manual it says that for Teves calipers (which are the ones I
have) the piston must be in the right position which is with the arrows
facing the bottom. Well golly, I sure never even thought about checking
that. Could that be the squeek problem, since having the piston positioned
correctly affects the noise damping plate?

        Also, all those tool numbers that the Bently manual refers
to...where do I get them? or what tool would suffice in place of those
specialized ones???

        It also states that the minimum thickness of the brake disc should
be 11.5 mm after machining. If mine is at ...say 12mm right now (Im not
sure what its at but this is just a question) how much will machining take
off the disc? So what I should have asked was..What is the minimum disc
thickness before one should get new discs?

thanks kids.
