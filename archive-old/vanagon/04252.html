&gt; 
&gt; I'm in need of a front VW emblem for my 71.  I've noticed that many buses (at
&gt; 
&gt; Ken
&gt; 71 Westy
&gt; 
&gt; 

	I have one from my past '71 in my rollaround. (It got removed for the
	spare bracket thing about 15 years ago). 

	Everytime I have to move it outa the way to get some lost tool, my
	sub mummbles something about doing something with that emblem.

	My sense is it would be much more useful in front of your rig than
	in my rollaround or on the garage wall.

	Reply with a mailing address. I'll send it to you next time I'm at my
	mail service if you promise to reimburse for the baggie, postage and
	the bottle of Grant's Ale I'll probably be sipping as I take the time
	to find it.
