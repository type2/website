Yo Sean -

Yeah, this is the sender for that secondary sump plate I described.  I'll
match the price of RMMW and give the standard 10% V_at_L discount too (That
means you only pay 12.56 for the sender from BBI plus whatever freight it
is).  The light in the guage is a standard white light but if you hook it up
to the rest of the gauge lighting wiring, you can dim along with the speedo,
fuel gauge, etc.
