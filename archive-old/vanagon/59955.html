Subject: Re: Cruising Speed

I have tended to hold both of my '91 Westies to 65 MPH max. The first I drove
8500 miles last summer from MA to Utah, up to Waterton, Alberta and home. It
cruised beautifully at 65 and I got 22-24 mpg on most of the trip. The Eisen-
hower tunnel climb found me (fully loaded) in the truck lane in 2nd or 3rd
at the steep end though!

Just received my &quot;new&quot; '91 and took it our for a test run. Cruises quietly at
65 on the highway -- and even in the Berkshire Hills on the 2 lane! It has
28K well maintained miles on it, the previous one had 15K miles at the start
of my summer trip. So both of these were low miles well maintained vehicles.

I consider 65 on the highway &quot;gentle&quot; driving - if you listen to your engine
and keep the vehicle well maintained. The real key is to be in tune with the
engine (also watch the tach!), have a good &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;ear&quot; for any signs of
engine strain. It's kinda like riding a hunter (horse) -- becoming one with
your mount!

&gt; 
&gt; There have been a couple questions about optimal cruising speeds.  One
&gt; today said 65 mph for an 81 air cooled van.  Another Westy owner once
&gt; suggested 55 as optimal (for water cooled late 80's models).  I happened to
&gt; meet this guy while I was on a trip.  He claimed to have been a VW
&gt; mechanic.  My gas mileage soared!  But otherwise, at what point are you
&gt; being too hard on the van?  Under some circumstances 55 would be TOO slow
&gt; (in terms of traffic and conditions).
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts out there?  I, too, tend to try to drive my van gently.
