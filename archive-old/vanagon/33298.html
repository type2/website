Subject: -48 F this a.m. (and loving it)

We reached that point on the thermometer that makes people do crazy 
things... like run outdoors in your skivies, hoot 'n holler, and 
general make more of a fool than is usual.

It is an incredible morning.  Perfectly still, no breeze to upset the 
woodsmoke rising out of the chimney until it reaches that defined 
plateau where it levels off as straight as a carpenters level.  If 
you have never heard the snow crunch at -48 F, you need to.  Each 
step is alive.

When weather becomes hot, peoples' tempers rise in proportion.  When 
it turns cold like this, humanity extends its warm embrace.  Stranded 
motorists are helped immediately, icicle smiles and runny noses greet 
one another saying &quot;I'm surviving-- and you?&quot;

All this brings us to the obligatory VW content:  How does a vanagon 
run in the cold?  The answer is lousy.  Starting the engine is a form 
of mechanical cruelty that should be penalized with revocation of its 
title.  Unfortunately, it becomes a necessity for a daily driver.  
The 'hot plate' engine heater is barely adequate but if the wind is 
calm will suffice.  Power steering pumps and  heater fans scream 
their protests.  Gearboxes, linkages, and switches threaten to break. 
 It all brings one to the question of necessity--  &quot;Do I really NEED 
to get in town?&quot;  the answer is always the same but the words change.
