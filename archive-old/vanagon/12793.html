Subject: Re: Those pesky exhaust valves

&gt; Chris Bridge asked about the appetite my '64 had for the number three 
&gt; exhaust valve and dared &lt;!, chuckle&gt; to suggest that perhaps the valves  were 
&gt; not adjusted often enough &lt;probably true, btw&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; In my opinion, the valve consumption of that motor &lt;a 1500&gt; had more to do
&gt; with how it was driven than how it was cared for. That poor thing spent most
&gt; of it's life at full throttle. I like to drive at 60-65 mph on the interstate
&gt; and while that's all in a days work for a type IV engine bus, it pushes the 
&gt; upright engine near it's peak output for sustained periods of time. Also, for
&gt; much of the time I had the '64, I lived in the Santa Cruz mountains and my
&gt; daily commute included a 1500 ft. elevation change, mostly at full throttle 
&gt; considering the output of that engine. I think that an upright fan engine 
&gt; can accumulate many, many more miles than I did provided it is treated
&gt; reasonably and cruised at 55-60 mph on road trips.
&gt;
&gt; One last thought, and this is really just a hunch: I think that to get long
&gt; life out of any of the air-cooled engines, it is really important to keep them
&gt; in tune, especially the timing. I do check my valve clearances a couple times
&gt; a year, but they are seldom out of spec. The point gap and timing seems to
&gt; me to be more variable and I check that more often. I haven't bought one
&gt; myself, but those electronic ignition conversions might be a good investment
&gt; in engine life simply because they help keep the timing spot on for long
&gt; periods of time.

&gt; Best Regards,
&gt;

Yes that I did dare to ask. um (stammering).

I have electronic ignition on my honda 750.  The main reason for replacing 
the stock points was exactly what Dave said above.  I've set the timing once 
in 1-1/2 years and 13000 miles.  The other reason for changing from the 
points is that there were 2 sets of points to adjust.  The next time you 
think about adjusting the points on your VW, think of that.

So the general opinion is that T4's last much longer in a bus, and that one 
must be very carefull with the upright fan engine. Do you think that the 
cooling system on the 1500 had anything to do with the valve consumption?  
Did you have a non-doghouse setup?
