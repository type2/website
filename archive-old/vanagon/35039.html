Subject: Fire Extinguisher Questions

The fire extinguisher I carry in the bus has expired and none of the
recharge services will fill it.  They claim new federal rules stopped that
practice a couple of years ago.  I am leery of their sales pitch for a new
one but I have no ideas what the codes mean in terms of types of fires.
Basically, what &quot;letter&quot; extinguisher should I be caring in the bus to
fight (heaven forbid) an engine fire?   My old unit is a &quot;B&quot; that I bought
at Kmart several year ago but it may have been wrong then and for the
entire time I carried it.  If someone knows, please along the information.

Thanks,
Skip
