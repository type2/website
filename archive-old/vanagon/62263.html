Just for information:

Beginning next week I will visit Holland. And I will search for
cheap tents. The list will be kept informed.

     Called Reimo this morning and found out two things:

     1. It costs almost as much to ship a single tent to the US as it costs
     for the tent.

     2. They are hopeful that they'll have a North American dealer sometime
     this summer.

     Meanwhile, are there 10 or 20 of us who would like to &quot;share&quot; a bulk
     shipment of tents?
