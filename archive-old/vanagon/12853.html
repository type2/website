Subject: FS 65 single-cab 3200.00 obo (FLA)

I have a 65 single cab (pick-up) in good restorable condition
1300cc SP (323a heads) pict 28 6/12v  recently rebuilt
12v conversion (lights,bulbs,12v gen,v-reg)
new brake lines, master cylinder, shoes etc.,
tires,shocks and new steering damper
newly rewired, new gas tank, float/gauge

Mechanically this thing has been pretty well gone over
I've driven it daily for the last two months to work out/discover
weaknesses and now the next stage was to be body off pan-up resto.

I don't have the time ( or the money) anymore and would like to see
it go to a good home instead of sitting for the next few years in my
garage.

CONDITION:
Body panels are straight with the exception of a spare tire divit on
the nose where I imagine someone nuzzled a rock or a hard place....

I have removed the back half of the upper bed to access the gas tank
area and the engine compartment. This area had the worst rust anyway as two
largish hay-bales were perched for years there and 
acted as large sponges soaking up the summer humidity..

Some minor rust bubbles on the basement door(s) yes! there ARE opposing
basement doors on this model, both operated by the church-key latch and are
solid and operable (church-key latches on the gas tank cover and engine
compartment door as well) although a bit sticky.

Hinged side panels are the stakeside variety, not the usual tin, but as this
is the third `cab I've seen in recent months like this I assume them to be an
aftermarket variation...?  Uses the same hook and pintel arrangement the tin
side does, looks profesionally made out of 1&quot; square tubing, and is solid as
a rock, although a small 3&quot; section up front needs to be replaced.

NOS &amp; original stock is pretty good. Lenses, turn and brake all fine,
uncracked. Headlight shells and glass are 100% intact. split window glass is
orig, no fog as are side glass and small rear window. Window seals are in
good shape for being 30 years old, but obviously door and basement rubber
while intact should be replaced.

Have spare passenger door, bare metal good shape (door on cab has seperated
from bottom hinge, just bought this door to replace it) Also have all orig.
6v parts in working condition (gen, gen stand, fan and shroud, lamps, bulbs,
6v turn sig indicator, NEW battery, etc.etc.)

looking to recoup costs, consider partial trades against $3200.00US
