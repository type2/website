Subject:      Re: Help!!!!! Need starter for an '88 Vanagon -- automatic

no need to panic. yet. i talked to Kevin today at about 1700, and he's
got a starter on its way (from his in-laws back home). it's supposed to
arrive via airfreight tomorrow afternoon. so, for right now, just sit back
and watch the soap opera. :)
