     Details.._dot_deatils.._dot_details! :) I considered driving it, but after 
     considering the Maher/V6anagon and Grendel sagas, I just can't afford time 
     off from work.!
     
     &gt;&gt;Glad the Autotrain idea sounds good, though you ought to ask
     &gt;&gt;about the maximum allowable vehicle height...I think those
     &gt;&gt;railcars are enclosed.
     
     When I talked to Amtrak, the operator said there would be no problem, as 
     they will fit full size American-Iron vans in there with room to spare. I 
     can't imagine the Westy being much taller. Now, you Synchro/Westy guys 
     may have problems...since you have the added ground clearance,etc.
     
     I'm thinking of going next week. I can fly down on Saturday morning, and 
     take the train back that afternoon at 4:00PM. I will arrive in Lorton, Va 
     at 9:00AM on Sunday, and then it is about 40-50 miles to the house.
     
     Even if the van ran great, a long drive at a laboring 60mph would get 
     old...
     
     Once again, until my &quot;normal&quot; mail comes back to life, please feel free to 
     e-mail me at 72172.3371_at_compuserve_dot_com
     
     Thanks!
