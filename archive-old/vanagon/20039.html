Howdy,

	I have 8 pix of my bus, but I'm trying to figger out a way to distribute
them.  I can't seem to find out how to put them in netcom's
	I put them in /usr/hack/uucppublic/tfab  bus1 - thru bus9.  Please
note bus2 is missing.  Damn thing just wouldn't upload!

	Where is the &quot;official&quot; site for these?

Thom
