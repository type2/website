This reminds me....

We were looking for a &quot;kinder, gentler name&quot; for Dave Mancuso's
&quot;Big White Appliance&quot;  -- any suggestions ???


my grandfather, originally from Pilsen,Germany used to call my
grandmother taubshen as a pet nickname.
taubshen - german for little dove
taube - german for big dove (i guess this is also a pigeon)
just a few suggestions.
