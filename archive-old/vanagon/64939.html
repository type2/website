OK, I give up.  Now understand I wasn't dressed to crawl under and look last
night, but the spare was out, and the front was up 3 feet 'cause of my efforts
to find better shocks, so I did go look, part way.

I didn't find it behind the headlight, not under the dash cover, and not
behind the radiator and as far down and back to the back edge of the spare
tire if it had been in there.

I'm beginning to wonder if the Syncro's have a reset button for the Ox sensor.
                    Can anyone shed any light on this?????

Okay the Oxygen Sensor Light has been on for a year now and it's bugging me.
Bently says the reset is behind one of the head lights for an 87 Syncro.  I
can't find it!? Anybody got any clues as were to look????
