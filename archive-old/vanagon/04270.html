Subject: 2000 lbs rated trailer hitch - can't find one

Although VW's max weight towing spec for my 87 Syncro is 2000 punds, the highest rated hitch I could find is manufactured by Da-Lan (located somewhere in Mass) rated at only 1500 lbs.  The Syncro is quite happy pulling the 1800+ lbs of my Boston Whaler, engine and trailer but I am afeared of having some sort of liability snafu if I ever get into an accident.  Anyone out there know of a hitch manufacturer offering a hitch with a full 2000 pound rating?
