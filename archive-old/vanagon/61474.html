Subject: FS: 5 Speed Turbo Diesel gearbox


Looking for a gearbox for one listmember I found this
box (which has wrong gear ratios for his application):

Turbo Diesel gearbox 5 speed, at present at VW for rebuild,
will get new synchron rings, no idea about the ID number. Will
cost DM 1,200.- and is available at a German dismantler next
Friday.

Anyone interested?
