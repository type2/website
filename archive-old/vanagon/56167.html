Subject: Re: Rust on exhaust

Yes, hydrochloric acid, AKA toilet bowl cleaner, will just about wash the
rust right off. There are probably many others out there. But what you are
left with is no desirable. You'll have clean metal that will instantly rust
in air with the humidity above 5%. That's about all the air in the world
outside of the desert areas. If you're after cleaning for painting purposes
sand blasting is the absolute best, the people that do it should know what
they're doing. You don't want to were away any metal. A wire brush and some
emery cloth will probably get you where you want to be. The multiple coats
of high temp paint. I've never had good luck with high temp paint on
exhaust because it's very hot. Maybe someone can make a suggestion.
