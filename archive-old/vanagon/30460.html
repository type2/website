&gt; C'mon Sean, cut this guy some slack... We all screw up sometime :-)
&gt; Cetin
&gt; 
&gt; On the matter of the 'recovery force' or whatever we may decide to
&gt; call it, my Home Phone number is 610-868-5873, we live in Bethlehem,
&gt; PA (I-78 corridor, Eastern PA), we have a garage, some tools, an extra
&gt; bed to crash in, if a listmember needs help, and I might even get my
&gt; wife's permission to go look at a VW every now and then.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, Bob's suggested method is exactly how I acquired the '87... Ric
&gt; (Golen) actually found it and test drove it for me... Thanks Ric.

&gt;  &gt; far as I know I'm not busting on a list memeber.  If I am, sorry.

Aaaaargh!  This is why I should proofread :) .  Well, now that I've made
myself look like an idiot by misspelling while chiding someone else for
their spelling, I think perhaps I'll have some water to wash down my
foot and then shutup for a while.  Sorry everybody :)
