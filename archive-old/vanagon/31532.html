Subject: 84 random hiccup

Hello all:
	Just a little &quot;hey it's happening to me too&quot; note fr or all vanagon
owners.  After reading the many inputs into this list for the last year
one of the common problems with the vanagons seems to be what people 
are calling a random &quot;hiccup&quot;.  You know the &quot;sudden lose of power at
cruising speeds&quot;  the  old &quot;like some one disconnecting the ignition 
at random times&quot;.  It has been complaints such as these that have 
intreaged me because of the many different &quot;possible solutions&quot;  It is as
if there is a gremlin in the engine compartment that know one really
find and fix.  Well it is hao ppening to me now so I thought that I would 
share my data with those of us trying to track this gremlin down.
Hiccup data
1. occurs only at cruising speeds 45 - 75 mph
2. seems to be totally random, wet or dry no correlation
3. occurs only when engine is warmed up 
4, the hiccup will continue until you stop at a toll booth or pull to side f 
for a few minutes. It is then highly probable that the remainder of
the trip will be hiccup free. (has never been otherwise)
5. Can affect frequency of hiccup by small gas peddle fluctuations.

	On my last trip the hiccup was worse than ever.  My brother
was with me so I had him observe the engine whilr e we were hiccuping
down rt90.  We were hoping to see a spark or small gremlin chewing
on a wire but all seemed fine.  Pulled over for about 5 min and continued
for the remainder of the trip (200 miles) without a hiccup.

	Has anyone out there had any success with a fix for this 
problem?
