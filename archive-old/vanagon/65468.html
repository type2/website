Jeff &amp; The List -

For the 80-85 models, I do carry NEW, Original Idle Stabilizers and at
VERY affordable prices:

251-906-083  (My # 251-1366) - Vanagon Calif Air &amp; WBX 80-85, Fed WBX
83-Early 84 (To VIN 25-E-200000)
321-906-083  (My # 251-1367) - Vanagon Fed WBX Late 84-85 (From VIN
25-E-2000001)

Price for either one is $32.50 plus $3 Priority Mail.

Dealer gets $156.40 for the first one, $203.05 for the second one
(Yeeeeesh!)

Alas, the 86-91 varieties are still Dealer Only, but I am working on
getting them direct from Europe to hopefully bring the costs DOWN.  I'll
keep ya'll posted one way or another.

&gt;You didn't state specifically the year, but I'm guessing
&gt;by your sig that it's the '80 Westy.  Some previous
&gt;responses assumed that you were referring to the '87,
&gt;and it has a completely different set-up, of which I
&gt;know absolutely nothing.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;The following applies to my '80 Westi:
&gt;BTW the California version, the Federal version had no
&gt;Idle Stabilizer (IS).
&gt;
&gt;Check grounding and electrical connections.  Hit them
&gt;with electrical contact cleaner and reconnect.  The IS
&gt;isn't grounded, but other bits and pieces of the system
&gt;are, check 'em.
&gt;
&gt;Use the Bentley manual for trouble shooting components.
&gt;Basically to see if the IS is working, use a timing light.
&gt;If the timing mark jumps around with it connected, it's working.
&gt;If the timing mark is steady when connected, the IS is dead.
&gt;
&gt;Be absolutely sure that the connectors to the IS are connected
&gt;properly.  There is a little male part that's supposed to fit
&gt;into a female part to align the three pins in the IS connector.
&gt;If the male part is broken off, the connector will appear to
&gt;go together, but the electrical connection is not made correctly.
&gt;
&gt;To adjust idle, one disconnects the IS and connects the ends
&gt;together.  The idle will jump around a bit, but the timing will
&gt;be steady.  This is part of the procedure for adjusting timing.
&gt;
&gt;Once connected, the IS messes with the timing to achieve
&gt;a steady idle.
&gt;
&gt;IF indeed you find that the IS is busted, could you send it
&gt;to me.  I'd like to do a post mortem on it to see what's
&gt;inside that can cost $150, and if there is a cheaper
&gt;approach.  (mine was missing, so no old one to dissect)

&gt;My idle stabilizer seems to have a hyperactive streak lately. The idle
&gt;is
&gt;around 2000 rpm, somewhat intermittently.  When I disconnect the
&gt;thing,
&gt;it
&gt;idles just fine at 900 rpm.  Any suggestions?
