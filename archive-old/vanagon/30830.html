Subject: X-mas break, gone for a month!

Vanagoons,

        Tommorow im driving home in the vanagon, leaving school for winter
break.  I am getting my head gaskets done professionally, and hopefully it
won't be that expensive, since they have just started leaking, i.e. less
corrosion, use the same heads.  I wish all of you the best of luck and a
nice holiday, i should be back around Jan 16, 1996.

happy H2Olidays and happy hO2lidays
