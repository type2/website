Subject: Advice Needed

To all those who have helped me with my '66 MicroBus (JT's Magic Bus 
Project), I need your advice.

I am trying to figure out exactly what I want to do to this Bus.  It has 
such great potential.

Original Plan, when I bought it before tallking with list members:

Hot Rod it!  Cal look, lower it, 1835cc with IRS conversion, custom paint 
job, etc..

Option 1, after doing all the history search on the Bus:

Restore it back to the way it left from Germany in 1966, including 
original paint (tizianrot &amp; beigehrau).  The only change from this would 
be to put in a 1600cc dual-port.

Option 2, convert it to a Westy:

I found someone who has a complete Westfalia package from 1965 ready to 
bolt in.  I would just need to find a pop-top.  Would also put in a 
1600cc dual port.

I can't be decisive about this, they each have their strong and weak 
points.  Suggestions PLEASE!!
