Subject: smoked and confused


While crusing into work today in my '92 Passat I was smoked by an '83
Vanagon around mile marker 20 on route 78 in New Jersey...I was doing my
usual 80-85 mph and could not keep up with this dude.  I have and '83
Westy and would NEVER think of taking the weiss beast over 70mph without
some real good drugs and ATF agents on my tail.   Once I caught up to 
him on RT 287 south I took a real good look over the back wheels to
see if there was a Porsche mod under there,  but it looked as stock
as my wasser boxer except for a nifty exhaust tip.  The guy didn't 
look crazed...nor did he have a gravid female screaming in the back..
got any ideas out there????  He would be a neighbor of mine,  jersey
plates 'n all...by-the-way my speedo is on the money and I was doing
90 when I finally caught him.
