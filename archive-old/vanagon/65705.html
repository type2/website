Subject:      Thanks to 84 Westy

No Flogging Please

 With the money from selling my 84 Westyfalia, I bought a 1987 Toyota
with a camper conversion made by sunraider.  Yes a Toyota. I still have
another VW in the drive way.  Even though my 84 was in mint condition, I
grew tired of the &quot;what if butt pucker.&quot;  Don't get me wrong I love VWs,
but the older models require considerable attention. I needed a vehicle
that I can travel to simi-remote areas in and not worry about.
  The Toyota is an interesting vehicle, that lacks the personality of
the VW. I miss the waves and the high seating position.  The unit sleeps
5, has a generator, shower, potty, 6 gallon water heater, 2 way refrig,
stove/oven, furnace, power converter and AC.  It even gets 22mpg.  The
maden trip went well last weekend. we traveled to the Big South Fork
Rec.Area. There were over 1000 people there for the weekend activities.
We rode 30 miles of mtn bike trails in two days.

I think I may paint a westy on the side or put TOYFALIA on the rear.
After all it was financied by a VW.
