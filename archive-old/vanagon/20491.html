Subject: Re: window winder thingio

My winder mechanism broke about three years ago so I took it out and made a 
temporary fix. It was such a struggle I've never gotten round to fitting the 
new one I bought.
The Haynes manual simply says, 'push the window channel to one side' but it 
doesn't move. In the end I took out the quarterlight and its vertical 
channel out altogether. There is a tiny screw buried in the felt channel at 
the top of the window, and a bolt at the bottom. Then I pulled the vertical 
channel down into the door. The winder mechanism then needs to be threaded 
into the door, like a chinese puzzle. It's tricky.
