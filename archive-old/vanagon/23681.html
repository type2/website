Subject: Re: air scoops on splitties

I have had air scoops on my '67 21 Window since the late 60's (Original Owner
since June '67) with no significant problems.  If anything it brings a little
more air into the engine compartment and I run a 12 pass oil cooler on the
inside of the right side scoop, just above the battery.  Oil temp is always
180 (usually lower) around town and about 190 out on the highway.  Temp
sometimes goes up on the long grades, but cools down quickly when heading
downhill or leveling off.  The engine is a bone-stock 1600, no other fancy
stuff.

Ran a pair of these same scoops on my 69 Camper back in the early eighties
and noticed about a 15 degree drop in oil temp, so I say use 'em.
