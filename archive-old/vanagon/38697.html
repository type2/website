Subject: My `70 Bus

Well, I have been watching the posts for about a week now and thought I'd
get in the action and throw in my two cents.  I am deep in the middle of
bringing back to life my `70 bus (used to be a westy but I hated the
fiberglass top)(I will probably get flamed for gutting the westy stuff off
of it..)  :)  But intentions are to install a slide rag in the hole where
the camper top used to be.  I finally finshed all the body work today and
got to primer it.  It is such a feeling when all the work I put into the
body is done and it no longer looks like a huge pile of, well, we all know
what kind of pile they look like when they are in that stage.. :)  Now it's
all one solid color.  A pukey yellow color, but that's the etching primer.  

I do have a question though..  The slide mechanism at the rear of the door.
I was wondering how hard it was to get it apart, and most importantly, how
hard it is to get back together?  I would like to dismantle it and do some
preventive maintanance on it but I don't want to take it apart if it's tooo
much of a hassle to get back together.
