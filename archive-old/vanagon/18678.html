Subject: RE: Fuel Pump

for what kind of VW? that seems REALLY high...
_______________________________________________________________________________
My fuel pump started howling and humming today.  I called a couple of 
parts places (the dealers were already closed).  $149 (on sale!) and 
$199.  Can anyone tell me what the dealer price might be or if these are 
the same prices others are seeing around the country.

Also, is there a chance to repair the thing, or am I out of luck?

Thanks!
