So Derek Drew says:
&gt; I really cannot remember what accounts for $25,000 in warranty repairs for
&gt; these two vehicles. The repairs are so numerous and constant they they all
&gt; just blurr together in my mind. Through the fogg I can remember things like
&gt; these: all brake components, coil, air box harness, brain, power windows,
&gt; every rubber boot, all the camper equipment, a new $4,000 transmission (plus
&gt; labor), about 10 CV joints, a new ball joint (I know, its a $50 part, but it
&gt; took 23 hours of labor (shop rate $63 an hour) for a dealer to diagnose and
&gt; replace....

Wow Derek!  Either you drive the crap out of your van when you have it or
you have a real lemon tree.

Although I'm not real pleased with the reliability of the components that
I've lost, there are far fewer than you seemed to have suffered (knock on
wood, well particle board ;) ).  Yet the dilemma still remains.  What other
van can you buy that has all the amenities and thoughful layout as the
VW Van?  I can't think of one.  I think the only way I'd go if my current
'91 van were to go kaput once too often would be to buy an earlier van.
