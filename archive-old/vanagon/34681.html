&gt; Ahh... but on my '66 all they look for is PCV. That's all the computer

&gt; 1776 when I can get around to it.

Oh great! Now some computer nerd is keying the right specs into the 
system. Don't you guys know that the gubmint is watching this list for 
emissions and pyro leads?

;) ...just kidding! I hope... Joe
