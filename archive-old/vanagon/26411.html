Subject: Re: Vans in europe?


With all this talk about used vans no longer being cheap in 
Europe....I wonder if it would be worth while, if one were to
be in Europe on an extended trip (more than a month...) to ship
one's own camper/van from the US to Europe, and then ship it back
when the trip was over.

Does anyone know what it costs to ship cars back and forth?
