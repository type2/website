Subject: Re: Convert Gaskets (WAS - advice on exhaust repairs needed)

David Most writes &amp; asks:

&lt;&lt; Hi. I just purchased an after market cat. converter, and it came with one 
 regular gasket and one metal doughnut gasket.  Is this right?  The 
 bentley shows two regular gaskets.  It looks like 2 regular gaskets on 
 the vehicle now (though I haven't taken it apart).  By the way, it's an '87.
&gt;&gt;

The doughnut style gasket goes between the converter and the collector pipe
on 88-91 models.  It is also used on 86-87 models with the REPLACEMENT
collector pipe, if purchased and installed on those years.  If you have the
ORIGINAL collector pipe, then use a regular gasket like what was supplied
with the converter (which was intended to go between converter and muffler).
 Order 025-251-509A gasket from VW or other good VW parts source.  Shouldn't
cost over $5 for this gasket (metal/non-asbestos).
