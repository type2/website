John, 

I've got Kadrons and my balance tube is not in front of the fan housing. 
I installed them myself didn't know that the manifolds are reversible. 
You have a choice whether or not you see the balance tube when you look at the 
engine. Cosmetically, in front of the housing looks OK but the tube is 
harder to get at. I may change mine when I pull the engine later 
this year.  

&gt; 3. I tuned the pair, before discovering the crossover, and the engine runs 
&gt; very smoothly and with good power. It will idle down to 500 to 600 RPM, 
&gt; which is a bit low for starting, considering there is no choke or throttle 
&gt; adjustment, other than the pedal, for cold operation.

Mine won't idle when its cold. I'm lucky I have a 6 mile trip to town 
before I strike traffic and have to worry about idle speed. I've thought 
about some sort of idle regulator like I had on a Japanese diesel van. 
The idle could be adjusted with a knob on the dash which screwed up a 
wire attached to the throttle linkage. Probably never happen but it's a 
thought.
 
&gt; 4. I have two theories about the reason that it died on the first trip after 
&gt; the tuning. Either I have a fuel flow problem - clogging or fuel pump - or 
&gt; the carb is icing - see below.

I also have the iced carb problem. Hasn't got too cold here yet, only 
down to 5 or 6 degrees C so far. My cold carbs won't settle back to idle, 
they like to race the engine 'cos the linkages seem to stick. It's sort 
of the opposite problem to the slow idle. Again it's not a problem 'cos I 
don't have much traffic to worry about. 

I heard a story about a fellow who live west of here where the mornings 
are much frostier. He worked out some way to run warm air from near his 
exhaust pipes, using standard VW ducting, back to the top of his Kadron 
air filters. Only does it in the winter then reverts back to the standard 
set up for the summer. 

If you like I'll may be able to get details.
