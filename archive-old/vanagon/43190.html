Oh Bob - yours took the cake....DUH!  American Metric.  Gawd.

Another thing that *really* toks me off is when I have an idea of 
something that I am inventing or hacking, etc.  And when I ask the 
dingbat behind the counter for &quot;whatever it is I am looking for&quot;, and 
they say something like, &quot;Well what do you need it for.&quot;  You politely 
explain, and they promptly tell you it won't work, or &quot;what you really 
need is&quot;, etc.  Or here's one:  In the past when I have had to take my 
car (before my VW craze) to a shop, I would request that they do some 
specific repair to the car.  When I get back to pick it up, they give me 
some lousy line like, &quot;we checked it and there was nothing wrong&quot;.  Or 
when I request that a certain item be replaced whether it looks brand new 
or not, and I go to pick up the car and they say, &quot;it worked okay and 
looked okay so we didn't replace it.&quot;  ARGH!!!!!!  Leave the god damn 
diagnosing to me and just do what I say.  I'll pay the bill and if that 
ain't what the problem was, then it's my fault, you've got the money.  
But until then, DO IT!  

Well Bob, I think I feel better now....
