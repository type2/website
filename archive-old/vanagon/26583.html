Subject:       Silly Engine Questions for Friday

I've held off as long as possible, but now must ask a silly quetsion:

My mechanic informed me that I have a stock cam with a +1 lift.  (Not 
the Engle.)

What exactly is this +1 lift?  Another mechanic buddy of mine looked 
surprised and suggested something about gears...

He also said that the crankshaft had been dynamically balanced and 
was couterweighted.  How do they balance it?  Hook the pistons to the 
crank and spin it around?

Anyhow, just a couple of ignernt kwestshuns for yall.  (I can do 
that...I used to live in Tennessee.)
