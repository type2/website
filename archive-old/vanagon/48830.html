Subject: Re: Syncro Crewcab FS


I called this guy, here's what he told me:

1986 Syncro Crew Cab, 70k, lt. brown, no squawks.  This is still under canadian
registry, though it is sitting in Southern California.  He's asking 18K, and
does not seem anxious at all.   He says it has both diff locks, but otherwise
I could find no options (definately no TriStar!)

I forgot to ask about 16&quot; wheels or rear discs, but I assume that he would
have said.  It is a three-door.

18k for one in the US is probably a reasonable price, but loans are pretty
difficult, and I for one, don't have 18k floating about.  A couple of weeks
ago, I'd have said that registration wasn't a problem, either, but after
giving me my license plates and everything, California has bounced my
registration on my '86 Kombi Syncro.  Maybe smogII has got them picky (tho'
the bus passed by a LOT) and they want statements from VW, the US DOT and
the US EPA.  Real bummer.  Cal DMV gave me a phone number for the VW office
(in Michigan) that issues these statements on Canadian vehicles, but the
number has been out of service for the last couple of weeks.

Sounds like a fun bus, wish I was rich.
