Subject: 85 Vanagon Mech. Questions

I am a newbie &amp; could use some help to identify a couple of problems
with my '85 Westy.

1.  Grinding sound when stopping.  Sounds like worn out brake pads -
metal on metal, but it is not.  The brake pads, rotors, etc. and the
rear drums &amp; shoes are all in excellent condition.   The sound is
also intermittent.  It is there most of the time, but sometimes goes
away completely.  This has been going on since I purchased the van _at_
68K; now at 82K. 

2.  Automatic trans. fluid leak- Coming home from a trip to LA I
noticed huge clouds of smoke coming out of the back of the van.  It
was ATF cooking off of the exhaust &amp; engine.  The ATF was about one
quart low.  I added some ATF and the problem went away.  When I got
home I took it to the dealer &amp; he identified a slow leak in the auto
trans pan gasket, but nothing else.  It has been about two months and
I just experienced a repeat performance - ATF everywhere &amp; lots of
smoke.  Question:  Does the ATF somehow start to splash out when the
level gets low?

Any help in diagnosing these problems would be appreciated.   Also,
what kind of gas mileage should I expect?  I get 17 mpg.
