You're right--well, sorta.  Some of the bolts (ok, SCREWS) on my 1976 bus 
CVs really have allen heads.  No kidding.  But the newer (and superior, I 
think) design uses the &quot;star&quot; type pattern you describe.  I don't know 
the simple name for that kind of bolt/screw head design.

&gt; And technically, these bolts aren't even bolts at all, but screws.

Sheesh!  :-)
