&gt;Okay, so it's dangerous if the flame were to go out while driving.  Is
&gt;it not also dangerous for the flame to go out while you are camped,
&gt;sleeping, during a storm?  I guess anything with gas and a flame is
&gt;relatively dangerous, driving or not.  One solution would be to get a
&gt;warning device that detects a gas leak, or lack of oxygen.  But if there
&gt;are so many risks, why are there so many three-way fridges in RVs?
&gt;Actually, a gas leak while driving is probably *less* serious than when
&gt;parked.  Why?  Because there is likely to be air moving through the
&gt;vehicle which will help disperse the gas, as opposed to it filling up
&gt;the inside of the van.  Comments?

Isn't there a safety device in there by which if the flame goes out then
the gas supply is cut? Thought I read that in the manual.

This doesn't mean I advocate using the propane when driving: my fireman
friend told me that the two most dangerous things are smoking in bed and
propane. Evidently propane is heavier than air, so it pools (e.g. in your
basement) until it finds a flame (e.g. the hot water heater pilot light). I
went home and moved my propane tank (barbecue) from basement to garage.

I have seen a propane barbecue tank catch fire: it's very much like the 2nd
world war flame throwers without the 'off' switch.

It seems to me there's a worst-case-scenario here that's far deadlier than
is the pleasure of a slightly colder beer.
