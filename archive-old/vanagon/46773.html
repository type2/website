I am considering selling my 1984 VW Westfalia Camper :-(

It has:

4. 102K miles
5. Propane/12V/120V Refrig.
6. 2 burner stove
7. A/C (which has a leak right now)
8. Cruise control
9. Additional passenger lights in the front in the center for driver and
passenger.
10. Additional passenger lights in rear over seat.
11. 2 tables
12. Body in very nice shape - zero rust, has been garaged and well cared for
- pale yellow with white pop-top
13. Bra
14. All records, very good maintainance oil change every 3-5K mostly with
synthetic, Mobil 1 or Castrol Syntec, plus Slick 50 3 times since I had it.
15. New drums and linings.
16. New front pads, and rebuilt calipers - just done.
17. Compression still excellent.
18. Has has coolant changed often with Autobahn non-phosphate anti-freeze.
19. All miles on vacations, on interstates or fairly constant driving.
20. 2 year old Sears Die Hard battery.
22. Custom-made, small kayak, canoe trailer, and trailer hitch and hook up. (
this is a very small light trailer, no weight for any wear and tear on
vehicle.
23. Fairly new front shocks.
24. After market catalytic converter and muffler.
25. New water pump in water reservoir.
26. New faucet on sink.
