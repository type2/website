Subject: Re: '78 Westy air conditioner compressor

I currently have  the engine out for rings, valves, etc.  The air
conditioning hasn't worked since I've owned it(2 years) but I haven't really
made an attempt to get it operable.  The compressor turns but other than that
I don't know about it's internal condition. My question is: Should I put the
compressor back on?

That thing is pretty beefy and of course saps some power.  I can live without
AC here in Maine, but then I think if I have it &quot;what the heck?&quot;.  If I don't
put it back in now there is no way I'll want to do it later, it would be a
bear with the engine installed.

Thanks for any thoughts.

Bruce Lewis
