Subject: sink...getting frustrating now
Date: Fri, 1 Nov 96 13:49:40 EST

Hello all,
Well, I thought today I would go and try to find a new pump for my sink.
Spent a LONG time driving around to RV stores and no luck. Got kinda
pissed off, but hey.  Then I decided to test my pump as I might be able
to repair it with copious amounts of super glue and silicone (BTW,
Vanagoners, if you have the problem of the instrument panel deteriation
thing, use super glue!  I found this out the other day...).  So, I hook
it directly up to the battery and it runs like a champ.  

So, I super glue that puppy up and install it in line where it's
supposed to go.  So, I fill up the tank with the required amount of
water (more than 3 liters) so that the bottom red light goes out and the
second to last red LED lights up.  The manual says that when the bottom
LED is lit up the pump stops automatically, so it seems you do have to
have a certain amount of water in the tank before the pump will work.
Then I took apart the faucet handle and checked things out, it all
looked ok, but I bent one of the contacts for better contact.

The way I see this circuit, the led panel supplies power to the pump
when the panel is switched on and the faucet handle grounds the pump.
Well, this time I flipped the LED panel on and when I turned the handle
on the faucet, it seemed like the pump was trying to go, i.e. the
panel lights seemed to dim a bit but I still am not getting any pump
action.  I'm wondering if my LED panel is having a problem with this.  I
think the next step I'm going to try is to wire the pump so that it's
not dependent on the led panel but instead so that it will come on
whenerver I flip the handle on.   We'll see how that goes.

ARrrrrrrrggh.

Sean
