&gt;How do I get this very popular catalog? Is it a subscription that
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes, If you place an order you will get their catalogs for life.  We have
not ordered from them since the mid 80s yet they still keep sending us
catalogs.  They threaten to stop if we do not place an order soon.  ;-)
