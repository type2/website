&gt;         Is ONE DAY PAINT any good or do you have a better suggestion.
&gt;         They will do a two tone Urathane paint job with a 5yr warr.
&gt;         against peeling, fading etc. including my bumpers and wheels
&gt;         for $600.00.  What do you think?

RUN don't walk out of that place and go to MAACO instead.  One day took
ELEVEN days to paint my car, and did a lousy job.  This was the one in
Kearny Mesa, San Diego area.  IMO Maaco is much better for about the
same price.  Had the same car painted at MAACO and it was done fast,
well, and has lasted a couple of years now and still looks good.  YMMV,
as always...
