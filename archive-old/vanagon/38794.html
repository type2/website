Subject: GEX engines


Interesting to note that RMMW no longer sells GEX engines.

The pleasant lady on the phone at RMMW refused to say if there was a 
quality issue but did indicate that RMMW's philosophy regarding customer 
service and product warranty didn't quite jive with that of GEX.

Thats about all she'd say.  YMMV.
