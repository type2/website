Subject: clutch question - '78
Date: Tue, 2 Apr 96 22:11:49 EST

Hey all,
I have a quick clutch question about my '78.  Every now and then, the
clutch slips.  It doesn't do it often and usually only does it if I
accidentally slip the clutch when shifting.  I don't think there's an
oil leak from the main seal as there's no oil puddles on the ground so I
don't think the clutch is contaminated by oil.  Bentley says to adjust
the pedal freeplay to correct this problem.  I'm not clear, however, on
which way to adjust it.  Should I adjust it so there's more or less
freeplay?  From reading Bentley, it seems like there should be more.  I
got under the car and looked at the adjustment by the trans and the
wingnut is cranked almost all the way to the front part of the threads,
i.e. not much freeplay as far as the adjustment is concerned.  Should I
back the wingnut up a bit?

Thanks in advance,
Sean
