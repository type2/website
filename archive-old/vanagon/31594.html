Subject: Engine Swaps:  Cooling &amp; Heating


To All:

The idea of going to a water-cooled engine in order to have better cabin
heating is valid but the idea of running long heater hoses is not.

There is enough room in the engine compartment of a breadloaf to accomodate
one or even two radiators.  Equipped with electric fans, the available
radiator area would be more than enough for the largest V6.  Keeping the
plumbing in the rear would eliminate many of the problems relating to long
plumbing runs.

Counting on an oil cooler for at least part of your cooling capacity is also
a very practical alternative.

Given the range of cooling solutions available, overheating should never be a
problem in a suitably designed engine swap.

The best solution to providing cabin heat would probably be to stick with the
installed heater ducting, changing only the source of the heat from
exhaust-derived heat exhangers to a large heater core mounted somewhere in
the tranny-flat area, convenient to both engine and cabin, with access to the
existing heater ducts.  A recirculating system is assumed, with fresh air
drawn off at the inlet-side of the regular cooling radiator.

Most engine swaps fail the test of practicality due to inattention to details
such as providing a comfortable cabin environment and convenient engine
controls.  The wiser course is to assume from the outset that the mechanical
problems of bolting an alien engine into a VW Transporter will be resolved,
for in truth the task is trivial.  The difficulties arise from the unforseen
details, such as sufficient fuel capacity, cabin heat or re-routing various
controls.  Focusing your efforts on these areas, and coming up with
practical, low-cost solutions can be the difference between a successful
conversion and the other kind.
