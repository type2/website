Subject: Re: HELLPPPP, Bus A/C belt.


&lt;1. What size is/was the belt 
no clue on earth from me. i run a 2nd alternator in the place where
the ac compressor ysed to reside in my 78. after you do # 2 below you can try
what i did and take a piece of old belt wrapped around both pullies and
guestimate how much extra you need. my unit had 
considerable amount of adjustment for belt tensioning.
2. HOW IN THE !_at_$#!_at_ DO YOU
GET IT ON/OFF.
 take the fan itself off of the crank shaft. you will have to loosen the alt
belt and remove the fan screen first, but the fan itself has only 3 bolts to
remove. you shouldn't have to worry about reallignment because the crankshaft
has a small dowel in it so you wont screw up your timing mark. after you
remove the fan the pully is right behind it.
the belt can be inserted (a tiresome procedure) through the fan hole and
behind the fan housing towards the compressor. looking up from beneath the
car the belt should come out near where the motor mount bar is. be sure to
get the belt on the propper side of the idler wheel (hidden up underneath
everything) otherwise the belt will probably do the exact same thing when it
starts to rub or comes off.
once you have the belt roughly oriented you mount it to the crankshaft pully
(taking care not to pull it all the way back out again and/or off of the
idler wheel) and carefully reinstall the fan (remember the allignment dowel.)
after the fan is back on you need to go back under the car and fit the belt
over the compressor pulley. if you have not already done so loosen the
compressor's pivot mount and remove some of the spacer shims. this will allow
you to pivot the compressor closer towards the crankshaft, making the belt
easier to install. this can be a slightly tricky operation. once the belt is
inplace it's time to tighten it by leveraging the compressor bracket away
from the fan housing and reinserting the spacer shims and adding/deleating 
shimmage as necessary to achieve propper belt tension. tighten it all 
back up.

imho; all in all not a difficult piece of work but frustrating! extremely
helpfull to have a 2nd person on standby. plus while you are at it replace
that stupid special bolt vw has on the alternator. an allen wrench may take
it off but between yourself and the po's, chances are its time is coming.
replace it with a bolt which uses a straight 6mm allen key, i think the
threading is 8m x 1.5mm pitch or something close to that. if you bring the
old one to a hardware store they should be able to set you up for less than a
buck. and trust me the headache this saves later is more than worth the extra
effort if that sucker is stripped or gets stripped later on by not using the
&quot;propper&quot; factory tool. 
oh well feel free to send mail if you have any specific questions
