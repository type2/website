&gt; 
&gt; Hi I'm new here.I own a 1979 bus. I was considering retro fiting a 
&gt; westfalia top from a 1971 bus. The guy wants $100 canadian for the
&gt; top. Has anybody done this before? Is it a pain? Is it worth it.
&gt; thank you for your help

  There was some discussion about this very topic recently - I think the
  cautious consensus was that the conversion would work on a bus already
  equipped with a sunroof. But it's still a significant job to do, even
  when the properly reinforced hole is already there, since there are rein-
  forcing plates underneath the pop-top hinges &lt;hiding behind the headliner&gt;.
