Subject: Re: Holiday Trek, meet bus owners?

&gt;Also
&gt;looking for pointers for junkyards and cheesy roadside attractions
&gt;along the way.
&gt;

Lost the atlas in which it was marked, but on my way through Alabama from
Florida to Memphis six years ago, I saw a hill covered with old splitties
(must have been 30 or 40) and bugs. Man I wish I hadn't lost that atlas!

Good luck! Joe
