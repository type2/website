Subject: RE: Gas heaters in Splitties

Marcus asks how well the inexpensive bilge blowers stand up to heat, when
used as heater boosters in aircooled.  Not great, is the answer.  I
slagged mine (ie case distorted enough to lay the fan against the inside
of the case) by using it on a 40oF. day.  I recommend them, but only in
a blow thru configuration where they are moving unheated air.  Certainly
no good downwind of a gas heater.
