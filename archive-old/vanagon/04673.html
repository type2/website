&gt; 
&gt; It's exactly my point, however.  We carry spare tires in our cars, but what
&gt; average driver is going to have the tools to take a tire off when they're
&gt; torqued so tightly.  My standard lug wrench wouldn't do it.  My wife once
&gt; asked me what she should do if she gets a flat tire in a car.  I said call a
&gt; garage.  I think changing tires on the road is a dubious, risky and futile
&gt; process.

What's REALLY funny are the spare tires themselves.  What a joke.  And some
people drive around with these tiny skateboard sized wheels/tires like they
are the regular ones.  I'm amazed when I see some of these people accelerate
out on to the freeway and speed into the fast lane!  Absolutely crazy! 

Regarding the removal of tires. I also carry extra leverage tools to get
the wheels off if I have to.

If your only emergency tool out in the desert is a spare tire, you are not
using your noggin'.  I would, at least, recommend bringing a jug of water
along.
