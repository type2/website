Subject: Re: Heat Exchanger repair

I'd like to hear about a replacement unit if possible... I've been debating fiberglass tape with &quot;paint over rust&quot; paint or something... heat in the Campmobile is something of the Lost Grail...


&gt;Howdy,
&gt;
&gt;While working on my 78 westie I noticed that the heat exchanger tin is 
&gt; corroding around the front of the unit. The flanges and all other 
&gt; parts of the exhaust are a bit rusty but still solid. My question is - 
&gt; does someone make a kit to replace just the outer tin and if not, can 
&gt; you weld a replacement portion up to the remaining tin?  I would hate 
&gt; to have to shell out $400 for a replacement set. Also I have a bonus 
&gt; question- is there an easy way to remove a brake drum? The left side 
&gt; came off like a charm but the right side is stuck. I have beat on it, 
&gt; backed one adjuster (the other is frozen) all the way off, but it is 
&gt; still stuck, anyone got any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again
&gt;Clay
&gt;
&gt;78 westie
