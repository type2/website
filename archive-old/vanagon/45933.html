To Robert and others:

                     I also have the GE Capitol Warranty for six years
or 75k miles and have had it since original purchase. I have a $50 deduc-
tible if I service the van at a dealer other than the one I bought it at
(which I do). It's called a &quot;Bumper-to-Bumper&quot; warranty and it covers the
same components as the first year of VW's warranty. I have gone to them
four times now in three years and they have been cordial and relatively
prompt. The repair shop calls them in advance and clear the work but I
have yet to experience difficulty with them. They even will give the dealer
a credit card number of theirs that the work can be charged to but the shop
owner won't approve of that.  I included the warranty in my bargaining for
the van; they weren't moving so I asked for the warranty for cost and got
it. Cost is $435.00 (or was in 1993).

Good luck.



Hal ROth
