Subject: Decision time

It is decision time on my 86 Syncro so I thought I'd solicit some
opinions from the cogniscenti.

Relevant facts: 134000 miles.

Very well maintained but it now needs some work:
1. Left front inner CV joint boot. (easy)
2. 2 rear wheel brake cylinders (easy)
3. Left cylinder head leaking. Uses about an expansion tanks amount of
coolant a week. (fix-able by shade tree mech?)
4. I suspect the exhaust headers may only have a 6 month
life. (Muffler and cat were replaced 2 years ago).
5. New rear bumper (very easy)

The heads have 50k miles on them.

In general, the vehicle is in very good shape. The A/C was completely
refurbished last fall, tires (reinforced Michellins) are 1 year old,
no perceived problems with the transmission or syncro assembly. Four
shocks and front rotors are 2 years old, new fuel injectors 2 years ago,
and battery is 1 year old. Whenever something needed to be done, I had
it repaired by a very competent mechanic.

(Ric Golen and Moe Walters from the list have seen this syncro.)

There is some rust starting on the front bumper seam and a couple of
body seams. Also 2 small surface rust spots on the drivers door.

My wife wants to throw in the towel and sell it. I haven't decided
whether selling it now is right.

We use it as our third vehicle. We have 2 small children and we use
the syncro as our &quot;beach&quot; car for beach trips and windsurfing.

I'm most concerned about the heads and the exhaust headers.

If anyone would like to pass on their opinion of what they might do in
my situation, I'm listening.
