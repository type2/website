Subject: Switching to air cooled list?

        This may seem like a very outdated question but the fact is that I
just got back from abroad. Anyways the question is how do I switch over to
the aircooled list. I was on the list before it split, and somehow I
arbitrarily got put on the watercooled list without doing anything.
