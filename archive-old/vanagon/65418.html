Subject:        Tires

OK, I promise, one of these days REAL SOON NOW I will run out of these &quot;new
guy&quot; questions that have probably been discussed over and over already on
the list.

The first day that I was on the list someone posted discussing various
makes and models of tires for the Vanagon; all of them seemed to be load
range D or other light-duty truck tires. My 1981 Westfalia came with quite
ordinary passenger car tires, 195-70R14. They're in OK shape but I'll be
ready for a new set in a couple of months or so. I was considering getting
Aqua-treds, at least on the front, but this is a new wrinkle for me. Are
the heavier-duty tires essential, or desireable, or optional?
