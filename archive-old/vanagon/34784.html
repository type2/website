Subject: Re: EV price/value Carter in Seattle

I  was at Carter the other day and noticed they had what appeared to be a 
new EV Camper in their showroom.  I didn't notice that one posted on this 
list, but it's still there (as of 2/1).

Before I bought my Bus, I was considering a Vanagon.  I went to Carter 
and test drove a few of their used Vanagons and left feeling uneasy about 
the dealership.  They pretty much ignored me, even when I was ready to 
buy, and I just left.  I even told the manager that I wanted to buy a 
Vanagon they had, and they couldn't be bothered.  I also got three 
diffent trade in quotes, all from the same manager on three different 
visits.  I don't really like being negative about places like this,
 but it really pissed me off and I think you all should know this before
 doing business with them.  And yes, their prices were high, but they did 
offer to knock the price down a bit more than the 10% quoted in the 
previous messages.  

Maybe they've changed since last March when I was looking, but I'd 
hesitate to shop there.

That's just my opinion of course, feel free to do what you like.

Craig
