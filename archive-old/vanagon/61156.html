On lubricants -

I've been trying to avoid silicone lubricants due to their ability to 
damage rubber, according to various posts.  I finally found a TEFLON 
based lubricant.  Made by the same company that makes Liquid Wrench, 
it's labeled as Lubricant.  It has teflon, mineral oil and perc as a 
solvent.  I've successfully used teflon in a small vial with a long 
needle like application tip on various items.  The rubber suspension 
bushings have been quiet for a few months now.

It worked so well on hinges on cabinets and doors at home that I had 
to find some door stops to keep them from closing by themselves.

I used it on my window sliders too.

BTW.  For other, shall I say, heavier situations I found a spray 
grease at a motorcycle supply shop.  The solvent evaps and leaves a 
thick stick grease, perfect for door mechanisms.
