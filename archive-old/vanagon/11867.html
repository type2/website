Subject: How  original is this type II ?
Date: Mon, 20 Feb 1995 11:05:56 +0100 (MET)

This weekend I went to a classic-car auction, which was combined with
some sort of car-market. The auction wasn't very interesting, but one
car in the market caught my attention. It was a '65 type II.

The bus was a `cargo'-bus, with no rear seats, a sliding door, and at
first glance no rust at all. I understand the sliding door option is
quite rare, but I'm not sure.
The sliding door had 2 windows in them, just as the opposite panel (are
they a factory option ?) These windows looked good, but they seemed
different than the side windows I see in the magazines (on micro/deluxe
buses).
The bumpers were blades, no overriders, and colored white.
The bus itself was two colors, a white/cyan(?) combination which looked
original.
I didn't get a chance to see the inside of the bus, or the engine clearly,
because the doors were locked. But if everthing is as good as the outside looks,
it should be alright.

The price the owner was asking (Fl. 6500  about $ 3600) didn't sound
unreasonable, but I haven't talked to him yet.

Could someone tell me, from the above description, what is original and
what not. And if the price he is asking is reasonable.
