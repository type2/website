Subject: Re: Rebuilt the carb - now it wont idle!

I had a similar problem after rebuilding mine and found various vacuum
leaks to be the problem. Chief among these was the hose to the vacuum
assisted brake booster, which now is heavily laiden with duct tape as I
look for a suitable replacement line (per thread of a week or two ago).

I'm still not satisfied with the idle and I may even have my distributor
turned up just a hair high (it's tough to get that right with idle
problems), though I would strongly urge against over-advanced distributors
as I understand they eat heads and raise temps.

BTW, if put the heel of your right foot on the brake, it is possible to
work the gas enough to keep it running...though a little pain may set in at
those longer stop lights...8-(

Good luck!
