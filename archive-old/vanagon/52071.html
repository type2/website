Subject: lead &amp; valves

        I just put a pair of 1800 heads onto my 72 bus. Anyways what I was
wondering is whether it would be worth my while to use lead addative. When
I break it in I've been told to use the addative but I need to know if it
is something that I should continue to use. My other question was whether I
should adjust the valves stone cold or while they are still leuk warm.
