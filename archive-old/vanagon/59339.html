&lt;&lt; Does anyone know of a source for Vanagon owner's manuals?  I am looking
 for an 85 (or thereabouts) Vanagon Double Cab manual.
 Thank you, Lloyd Perkins  dad_at_together_dot_net &gt;&gt;

get a copy of Hemmings Motor News.  There's a place in there that specializes
in wacky, hard to find owners manuals and other auto literature. Can't think
of the name right now, but there always in there.  I got a owners manual for
a '76 Audi 100LS from them...( ...don't ask...  :&lt;)
