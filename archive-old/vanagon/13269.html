&gt; I think I am going to give the Uniroyal Laredo LT195/75R14 a try. If I
&gt; insist on Michelin XZX 185R14 I will have to buy for Michelin dealers.
&gt; The price for the tire is only $7 more each but all other charges add up
&gt; to be almost $100 more for 4 tires.
&gt; 
&gt; So how do you net heads think?

I have the Laredos on my Vanagon. There are 2 tread patterns available, a
&quot;m&amp;s&quot; pattern (what I have) and a very much more aggressive snow tire type
pattern.
I really have no complaints with these tires. I run them at 40psi front 44
back.
I was scared off the Yokos by some rumours of a harsh ride, but I think
Harry will poo-poo that notion. 
If I had to choose again, I would try the Yokos.
