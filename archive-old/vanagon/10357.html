&gt;Our '81 vanagon has been quite cranky to start in the mornings this days.

Alice,

try checking your points under the distributor cap, either with a feeler
gauge or with a tach-dwell meter. The screw that hold your points may have
come loose.

I'm not sure what you meant with gas flow. Are you saying that you can
normally hear the electric fuel pump, but not anymore? 

Keep us posted :)

Sami
