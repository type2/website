&gt;   As well as wondering about an East Coast pre-tour event, I was also
&gt; wondering as to the status of the BIG tour. Any further word on that?

Nothing much new on the big tour.  It is still scheduled to begin on the
weekend of May 19th, 1995 in Yosemite National Park.  As usual I have had
a million and a half things going and haven't had much time to work on
it, except that I have created a trip homepage on the WWW (World Wide
Web) so those with access can get the latest information on the trip
from &quot;http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw/tour.html&quot; or follow the links
from my homepage in my .Sig.  After seeing the dropout rate for the
Pfeiffer trip, I'm a little worried about the tour actually getting beyond
Northern California  :)  but I'll do everything I can to see that it does.
As the big trip draws nearer you will be hearing more an more from me, so
enjoy the silence(tm) while you can!!
