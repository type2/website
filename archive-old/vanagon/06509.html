Subject: Midwest Busathon?


	I think it would be pretty darned cool for 
a little midwestern thing, maybe somewhere in Northeastern
Iowa? (I'm biased)

	Actually, someplace like Strawberry point, or Ledges state park,
or someplace scenic in Minnesota (can't remember any off the top of my head)
would be pleasent.  I love tooling along on winding roads doing about 60
and watching the trees march by to the sound of the ol' air cooled....


	
	Speaking of which, I am just waiting to wrap up some detials on getting
the GEX unit.  While I would love to rebuild what I have, it would actually almost
cost more &amp; certainly take much, much longer.  

	Also, would you (Mike Wright) drop me some info about this
place in Knoxville?  I've heard my father talk about it, but never
been able to find it.  Thanks

MAtt
