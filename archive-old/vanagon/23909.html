Subject: My Temporary Batter Plate Fix

hey now,

this is what i did to get a battery plate in so i could drive it around. this
is until i can find someone to weld a real plate in.

1) measured the inside compartment...15&quot; by 9 1/2&quot; if i remember correctly.
2) ran over to Lowe's and had them cut a 1/4&quot; thick piece of heavy duty
plywood.
3) then i bought a battery restraining kit.._dot_came with 9&quot; 'posts', rubber
washers, and wing nuts.
4) placed battery on the plywood and marked holes for 'posts' to go throught.
5) drilled holes.
6) put the plywood in the compartment...perfect fit...no holes to speak of.
7) put the bracket over the battery, fit the 'posts' throught the holes and
tightened with the nuts.

i was still concerned about the whole contraption sliding, so i drilled two
more holes ---WATCH THAT BATTERY--- and put two bolts that will keep the wood
from sliding when turning. should work for this weekend's trip.

american ingenuity on a german vehicle! ;-)
