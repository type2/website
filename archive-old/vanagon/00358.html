Joel's note:
  this 'bearing' is the little oblong shaped plate at the bottom of the
  shift lever, under the rubber boot, with the little 10mm bolts holding
  it to the floor of the car.  on 1980-1987 models, it had two little
  'alignment' holes in it. the 'newer' ones don't have these holes, and
  don't have much in the way of adjustment.
