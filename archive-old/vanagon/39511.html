Subject: Westy Rentals in Seattle, Phoenix &amp; SLC

Vanagonauts,
A while back someone mentioned a Westy rental company in Seattle.  I've
called them and have the following information for list consumption:

The name of the company is Adventure Werks and they rent Westys in Seattle,
Phoenix and Salt Lake City.  Their phone number is (800) RENT VWS.
The woman I talked to there was very pleasant and gave me the following
rates:

1. Classic Westfalias (Bay window buses from the 70's)
Weekly with 1000 miles: $350.
Weekly w/unlimited miles: $450.

2. 91 Vanagon GL Westfalias
Weekly with 1000 miles: $500.
Weekly with 1750 miles: $625.
Weekly w/unlimited miles: $725.

She said that daily, and monthly rates are available as well as airport
pick-up.

They have an internet website at:  http://www.nas_dot_com/~adwerks/
I just looked at the site and it has all their rates and other information -
worth a visit.

Usual disclaimers apply, no financial connection.....

Happy Trails,
Jim Davis
