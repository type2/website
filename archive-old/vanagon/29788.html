If its not one thing its another.

A couple weekend ago, I got my idiot lights working, and I thought I was
_The_Man_

Tonight on the way home, I start hearing this squeeky noise, kinda
warbly-squeeky.  I reach my hand under the dash and twitch the cable and
it stops, only to return a mile or so later.  It kept getting worse, and
un-silenceable until I finally pulled the cable off (while driving!)
when it got to the incredible death wail stage.

Anyone ever have this happen?  Is there any hope?  Or do I have to con
MH into passing along the '53 KMH speedo he found?
