&gt;Recently, I started having injector problems with #2 cylinder (when looking 
&gt;in the engine compartment the one closest on the right).  The cylinder does 
&gt;not fire.  I'll start up, and drive--the vehicle will vibrate very much and 
&gt;no power.  Stop, pull #2 cylinder plug wire from distributor, no difference 
&gt;in engine.  Pull any other wire and engine gets noticebly rougher.  Put wire

&gt;close to distributor and hear/see good spark and still no difference for #2.

&gt; Last month I put in new platinums.  Have swaped plugs on #2 with no change.

&gt; Compression is good in all cylinders.
&gt;
&gt;This problem is intermittant.  Sometimes it'll go away and many times the 
&gt;van will start fine.  Once when i was out and the problem started, i ran a 
&gt;can of BG-44K thru the system and it cleared up--not sure if it was related.
&gt;
&gt;I run full tanks of gas:  from F to almost E to keep accurate tracks on the 
&gt;mileage.  Could this make me prone to condensation and water accumulation in

&gt;the fuel tank?  I've heard that water in and injector will cause vapor lock.
&gt;
&gt;What could be the other reasons my injector is not working intermitantly? 
&gt; Do they slowly degrade before going fully bad?

I'll bet you have a bad spark plug wire end.  Itis probably shorted to the
metal shield.  Try another wire and see if that resolves the problem.  If
not, try swapping the injector with another cylinder to see if the problem
goes with it.  These injectors do not vapor lock.  The very rarely clog.
 Hope this helps, 
Dennis.
