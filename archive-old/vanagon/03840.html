Subject: RE: '86 Vanagon Head Gasket Leaks

I have a copy of the FTC consent decree and have given it a cursory reading.  As far as I can  tell, VW has agreed to arbitrate all internal engine failures for as long as they do business in the US.  This might be the hidden logic of thier new 10 year limited warranties.  Perhaps they figure if they are stuck doing this they might as well get some marketing advantage out of it.
