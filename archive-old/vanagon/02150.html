&gt;Here's a list of things that would be useful to bring along:
.... BIIIIIGGGG mutha list of stuff deleted ....
&gt;Waterless hand soap - To get the grease off your hands.

baby-wipes also work pretty neat, and have their own little container.

&gt;I also think a couple of cellular phones in the group wouldn't hurt either.

very true. but what are also very useful in such multi-vehicle convoys are
cb radios. yeah, they are out of 'fashion' nowadays, but they still let you
talk from vehicle to vehicle (whereas cellular phones do not) ... and that
comes in handy for stuff like &quot;Hey! we've gotta take a bladder break at the
next truck stop!&quot; or &quot;did you know your muffler was about ready to fall off?&quot;

not to mention talking to the big trucks and finding out about the weather
and/or road/traffic conditions up ahead.

ham radios would be much better (clearer, longer range, and less bozos on
the freq), but are much harder for most of us to get, and much more
expensive. however, like the cellular phone, a couple of 2m-band radios
could certainly come in handy. :)
