   K.I.S.S.    Keep It Simple Stupid- An old milliary phase, I think.
     That's what we need today! WE DON'T NEED MORE COMPUTERS, to do more
     non-sense. I work on them, (with them) everyday. I am sure in some
     way one of them will kill us all! Just teach the public how to
     take care of them self, by using a seat belt. Is that to hard?
     If people are this dumb, Nothing will help!
