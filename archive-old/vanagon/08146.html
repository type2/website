zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. snore.              ;)

&gt;Why not ramble or post silliness?  There are a great number of people
&gt;here that consider the others to be good friends, and this list is just
&gt;a way for them to communicate to each other.  Any listserv turns
&gt;into a 'bar' of sorts, and its really not a bad thing.

well, yeah, but us silliers have to remember to leave some room for the
techies and fixers and straight-up type folks.  i'm not a techie, but i
do have a bunch of books that supposedly have a lot of useful numbers in
them. but i don't mind someone else going off the deep end about shaving
heads (on their engines, that is), etc., etc. cause one day that might
be useful to me.

on the other hand, i can see their point about grits and possums not being
tooooo useful to them. ever. well, maybe not 'ever' ... if they ever drove
through Amabala, and had to ask directions from Bubba and his ilk, why, you
it might just be useful to KNOW what a grit was. and maybe offer a road-kill
possum or two as payment for being pulled out of a ditch. :)

&gt;and as another friend says &quot;you may have bought the VW, but it owns _you_&quot;.

ouch. truth hurts.
