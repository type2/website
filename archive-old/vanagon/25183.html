Subject: Re: VW Bus Reviews???


Road and Track published their VW reviews in a two volume set running
from the fifties to the eighties (maybe  there is a third volume by now)
even includes a comparison with a DKW van. I have copies of these volumes,
and I can supply the full refrences to these --- tomorrow (I didn;t bring
them to work with me).



GIMME GIMME GIMME!!!!!!!
