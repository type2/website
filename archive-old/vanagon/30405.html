Subject: Re: Eurovan Bentley Manuals, I'm getting something.

When I purchased my Eurovan back in August I made the dealer promise to
include a Bentley.  Of course they said they didn't have them. I promptly
gave the the number to order it ( which I had called to make sure they had
them, I guess I got lied to).  Well, they had not recieved it after 2 
months, and I've kept bugging them.  Last week the parts guy called 
(finally) and left a message saying they had it in. 

So as soon as I heard talk on the list of one still not existing I called
the dealer this morning.  The parts guy said that it was there.  I said 
&quot;that is the Bentley Manual, right?&quot;  Respones &quot;ugh, no I think its the 
same one they use in the shop.&quot;  He went on to say that it was &quot;really big.&quot; 

The dealer is about 2.5 hours from my house, so I haven't been able 
to pick it up yet.  But, I'm going down there next weekend to get it.

I'll let everybody know what I got when I get it.

Any guesses?
