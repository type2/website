Subject: Preserving Curtains

My girlfriend and experienced garment and quilt maker recommends
limiting curtain washing to a long soak with a mild soap such as woolite
or quit soap. Use very little action of the washer's agitator - a full
normal cycle probably is not necessary. This helps preserve the fabric,
which is usually quite old.

She can make new curtains for anyone who needs them, if interested.

&gt; &gt;&gt;My other question is about the curtains.  I really would like to
&gt; give
&gt; &gt;&gt;them a good cleaning but am concerned about unscrewing the fabric
&gt; from
&gt; &gt;&gt;the wall.  Will it ruin the fabric? Does anyone have any other
&gt; &gt;&gt;suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; We just unscrewed ours and threw them and their little straps in the
&gt; wash. Do your self a favor and make a sketch so you remember which
&gt; curtains go where. I spent a good half hour figuring it out (rather
&gt; recreational actually, like a mind teaser). Also, the covers for the
&gt; pad
&gt; over the engine and the pads in the above bunk will come off as well.
&gt; Only trick is getting them back on the pads. With patience it will
&gt; happen. Washing all this stuff (and replacing the original carpet)
&gt; greatly improved the aroma of our van. Now I just need to replace the
&gt; rotting skylight.
