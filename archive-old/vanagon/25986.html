Subject: Whats a Doghouse

Hey Guys and Gals,

I am trying to soak up any info possible from this list since I got my 
1974 West about a month ago. I am rebuilding the engine for a trip to 
California this summer(from Florida). I would like to know if I should 
put on an external oil cooler. I have heard you don't need one if you 
have a doghouse oil cooler. My engine is a 1974 2000cc, do I have a 
doghouse oil cooler? Any help appreciated.

Thanks,

Aaron
