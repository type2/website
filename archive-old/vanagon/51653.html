&gt;&gt;So I got the FAQ's, read the web pages, and went looking for some 
&gt;&gt;Yokohamas.
&gt;&gt;Yokohama (yellow page 800 nbr) said the Y370G is a passenger tire?  
&gt;&gt;is this true?
&gt;&gt;The tire discount place listed on the VW web didn't even have a 
&gt;&gt;record of 370's.
&gt;&gt;The guy at Sears just cocks his head and said &quot;the book said I can 
&gt;&gt;only sell you 185/r14's&quot;
&gt;&gt;Is there another model number that is equivalent? What am I missing?

John, I have had several follow up messages from list members, so will 
try to answer all questions here.  The problem finding the Yokohama 
Y370 in the LT 197/75 R14 Load Range D appears to be that the Yokohama 
catalog is poorly designed. Yokohama makes the Y370 in passenger tires 
and in the LT 197/75 R14 Load Range D.  If a dealer is not used to 
selling that particular LT tire, they have trouble finding it in the 
catalog. 

When I decided to purchase the tire, I spoke with my local dealer and 
he couldn't find it in his catalog.  After several confirming e-mails 
to Harry Yates, I was determined to find the tire and called several 
800 numbers for Yokohama.  The Yokohama service center that Faxed me the
needed information is in Texas (800-231-9987). With the correct part 
number for the tire (#37047), my dealer immediately found the tire in 
the catalog and ordered them for me.  As Yokohama makes very slight 
modifications to the tire tread, they change the letter after the Y370. 
I have the Y370B but the latest tire is supposed to be the Y370G which 
is supposed to have even better wet traction.
 
The following are the specs on the Y370 that were in the FAX Yokohama 
sent me.  The key is to tell your dealer to order tire #37047 to avoid 
the possibly of getting the passenger tire.

Yokohama Part No:	37047
Part No:		LT195/75R14 8 Y370 XL OE BTL TL	
Unit weight 	23.10
Tread Depth 	11
Tread Width 	5.3
Ply rating 	8
Load Range 	D
Measured Rim size		6
Alternate rim size  		5.0-6.0
Inflated overall width  	8.1
Inflated overall diameter  	25.6
Loaded Static Radius		11.9
Loaded Revolutions per mile	818
Mileage Warranty Miles		40,000
Warranty Type			A

Load carrying capacity is 1710 lbs at 65 lbs of air pressure, 1530 lbs 
carrying capacity at 55 lbs of air pressure, and 1435 lbs of carrying 
capacity at 45 lbs of air pressure.  

I keep 43-45 lbs in the front tires and 53-55 in the rear tires.

Good luck finding the Y370's.  If your dealer can't find them with the 
part number, call 800-231-9987 and ask Yokohama for the number of a 
local dealer who can order the tires for you.
