Well, the problem is definatley the speed DIFFERENTIAL...
If everyone went 90 it would be OK..or if everyone went 50 it would be Ok
too..
That's why in Germany, the old Veedubs usually stay in the far right lane
along with trucks and now those little trabants
in the middle lane come the more powerful cars (passat, golf, Opels)
and in the far left , you have the M5s and 911's and Audi RS2s

and that's why there are not *that* many accidents..HOWEVER when there are 
accidents, it is due (in part)to the great speed differential(lets say 
150-90mph; remember in the far right lane, 80mph isn't uncommon)and that's why 
60people die or whatever.
 

&gt; As for the ones doing 20 in the only lane WITHOUT ever pulling over, while
&gt; 50 cars pile up behind you and passing one at a time, well, no, you are
&gt; not breaking any laws (well, in CA actually you are).

hehe..my uncle got pulled over in CA because he was going too slow (40mph)
on the highway.
