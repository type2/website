&gt; So Leong_at_spudboy.baynetworks_dot_com says:
&gt; &gt; &gt;(blah, blah)... 5 cylinders right?, just like the
&gt; &gt; &gt;later vanagons... so power is probably equal..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; YIKES!  I'd like to have Steven Johnson jump up and tell us his '91 Westy
&gt; &gt; has 5 cylinders!  
&gt; 
Well, at the risk of sounding real crazy, considering our past 
discussions about stuffing an inline 4 into a Synchro, would an
Audi 5 fit in the bay?, they aren't that much longer and my
Quantum Synchro's 2.2 had gobs and gobs of low torque, and revved
pretty damn good as well, a Quantum exhaust manifold would work but the
downpipe would have to be turned around somehow and you would need to
fabricate brackets and do some sort of jerry rigged muffler,
and as the 5's are damn cheap and good for about 125 hp with better
balance and smoothness than the 4 maybe it's worth considering.

JUST KIDDING!!

5 cylinder Vanagon jeesh.
