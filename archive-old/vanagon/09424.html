Subject: New van timing, cont'd.

A few days back I asked for help on finding the timing marks on the pulley on
the '80 Westfalia I just bought.  My thanks to those that responded  with
tips on this.  I finally shucked work and got outside and found them today
:-)  There is a tiny mark on the forward, or inside edge of the pulley; I was
looking on the rear edge.  Boy was my face red.  It's almost impossible,
though, to see them through that small door behind the license plate.
 Should'a seen me trying to fit a timing light AND my face through there to
see!

Now I've noticed two electrical items that don't seem to have any purpose and
can't find any reference to in any manuel.  On the dashboard, to the left of
the heater controls (whats to control?:) there is a small, unmarked aluminum
socket with a wire coming out behind the dash.  I haven't been able to trace
the wire yet.  Does anyone know what that thing is?

Also, on the sink cabinet (I have a standard model - no stove or refrig),
there is a panel of LEDs.  On the left are water tank indicators and on the
right are battery indicators.  Between these there is one green LED which is
unlabeled.  No reference in the manuel or elec diagrams.  Anyone know about
this one?
