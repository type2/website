_______________________________________________________________________________
&gt; just me (Alistair, are you listening??), so let's not forget that tomorrow
&gt; is FFFriday. and it is tradition (started by that slacker, Bill Kennedy!)
&gt; for folks to produce some strange stories/poetry/rhymes/recipes/etc.
&gt; 
&gt; just a warning.  :)
&gt; 
Can I safely post my recipe for_black_eyed peas? ;)

   sounds like it has suspicious racial overtones to me...
