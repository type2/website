Subject:       light switch illumination

Thanks, Joel for shedding some 'light' on this question.  I went 
through quite a time replacing this light in my Golf... nobody would 
sell me a bulb!  Finally got a broken switch at a wrecker at no 
charge and the bulb worked fine.  A few minutes with a soldering iron 
fixed that job.
