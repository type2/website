I'm going insane.

My SO needed a car toady (BMW Belly Up Again) so I lent her the 911!  I
wouldn't have even _thought_ to let her use the bus.  Is this proof I'm going
insane?

Its nice to see evryone resisted getting in to the &quot;VW's In Movies&quot; 
thread after my post about &quot;The Net&quot;

Oh!  Gotta go!  They're coming to take me away ha-ha! To the happy home,
where valves are adjusted all the time and I'll be happy to see that nice
Gene Berg in his nice tight coat.  They're coming to take me awaaaayyyyy!
