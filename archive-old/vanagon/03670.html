&gt; Most of the stuff on the halfdan vanagon gopher was contributed by Joel 
&gt; Walker, and remains either reprinted fact, or his opinion.  I'd be really 
&gt; happy to put other opinions on the gopher, and, I suspect Joel would be 
&gt; perfectly happy to have some other opinions inserted too.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know if you'd like to contribute.

Gerry: The description for the DIY heat warning sensor is (I think) for a
water cooled engine and as a consequence the sensor is designed to trigger
a warning when the head temp exceeds 250. For air cooled engines this is
far too low (and since the person who requested the info has an air-cooled
engine and is a newbie; too low and misleading for his purposes). Air-cooled
head temps run around 300-350 depending on the point of installation.&gt; 
This range could easily be addressed by purchasing the appropriate parts
from the dealer cited in the article.
