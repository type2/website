&gt;&gt;I am under the impression that it is a single source of input -- that of the
&gt;&gt;coolant &quot;float&quot; in the main coolant tank.  If that's the case, mine needs
&gt;&gt;replacing, since it has gone into &quot;flash--pull over now&quot; mode without other
&gt;&gt;provocation twice in the past week.  I then religiously check the level of
&gt;&gt;coolant in the main and recovery tanks (both OK), and even check the
&gt;&gt;radiator bleed screw (no bubbles).  After I start up again, the light is
&gt;&gt;gone.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;To my knowledge the coolant level sensor probe is the only soruce that will
&gt;make the light come on.  Remember though that even a momentary drop in
&gt;coolant level will latch the light in the ON state and it will remain on
&gt;until after the coolant level rises back to normal AND the key is turned off.

My Bentley calls the lite &quot;K28  Coolant Temp. Ind. Lite&quot;,(page 97.75) I
believe the owners manual calls it an overheat light.

I just went and tried it with the &quot;Coolent Level control unit&quot; (page 97.67
relay #3} removed. The warning light blinked on start then went out,(normal
ops), temp guage goes up as it warms up.

Does anyone really know?
