Another neat trick for removing the pilot bearing is to use a tap that
is just large enough to thread into the bearing and get some bite. Just
start threading until the pilot is pulled out.  (You could first thread
the bearing and then use a bolt if you are afraid of breaking the tap.)
Good luck
Mark
