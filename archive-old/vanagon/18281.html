Subject: Re: Eurovan Double Cab Pickup

yeah i see a few of them around ontario from time to time, they really do
look odd tho'. it is my understanding that they do not make single cabs
(for the n. american market at least) any more :(

 &gt;Hi All.  I saw a 1992 Eurovan Double Cab Pickup truck today in the
&gt;Vancouver, BC area.  It had the fold down sides like the Vanagon and
&gt;previous types as well.  It sure looked strange.  The roof line had
&gt;deep V grooves on either end of the roof to act as rain channels (I
&gt;guess), and 4 doors with external hinges.  It was a chalky blue
&gt;colour.  It wasn't in the best shape (or clean) but the owner seemed
&gt;quite content.  The rear wheels even had it's own round fenders.
&gt;
&gt;I must admit that it looked weird.  Anybody else seen one of these in
&gt;North America??
&gt;
