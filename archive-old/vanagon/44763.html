Subject: WTB CV Joint and fr. wheel bearings.

Hi all,
	My van is sick.  I've got a 69 vw camper and have a new clunking
noise that is getting progressively louder.  The noise is not really a
grinding noise, but more of a clunking that appears to correlate with the
speed of the car and not the engine.  Also, sometimes it goes away, but
comes back when I turn a corner to the right.  This info coupled with the
fact that I noticed the rt. inner CV boot is torn leads me to believe it
is the CV joint.  However, I'm not sure.  I guess I am going to tear it
apart anyway to put on a new boot and grease.
	So my question is: Do these symptoms sound like a CV joint?  Or
does a front wheel bearing sound like this when it goes?
	Also, Bow Wow wants $80 for the CV and $10.50 for each front wheel
bearing, which seems reasonable, but as a grad student I would rather
spend the $80 on beer.  So I was wondering if anyone knew of any good
cheap source for these parts?

Thanks,

John
