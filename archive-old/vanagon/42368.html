Originally, the interior light circuits are separate from the ignition, in
otherwords, hot all the time.  Sounds like some has reconnected the circuits
at the fusebox to allow them to only work from the ignition switch, someone
probably paranoid about accidently leaving the lights on.  Simply find a
circuit on the fuse box that is hot all of the time and reconnect the circuit
there.  One good place is the horn circuit - it's hot all of the time.
