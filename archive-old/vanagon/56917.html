Subject: N.C BuRPOBaT Summer Trip

Howdy all, I'm writing to officially plug the NC BuRPOBaT (North Carolina BlUe
Ridge Parkway- Outer BAnks Trek) for the first week of June this summer. Ken
has been gracious enough to grant a website off the Type2_dot_com page, so check
that out for details and maps. (http://www.type2_dot_com/ ) We're under the
Transporter Trips and Tours section. This will hopefully help all of us that
can't take lots of time off work still feed that bus-traveling jones this
summer. North Carolina has both beautiful mountains, as well as the OUter Banks
barrier islands on the coast, so there will be a lot to see and do...
 Anyway, the trek is shaping up nicely, so please check out the page, and leave
a message on the message board there, so we can start working on details.
I hope to see a lot of yo uthere!
