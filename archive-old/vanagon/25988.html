     (snip)

     So my questions: There is no obvious damage.  We are talking some
     semi-serious moisture here, a tablespoon full or so, appearing as
     condensation covering a good bit of the lens. Turning on the headlight
     does not evaporate it at all. Is it possible for moisture to enter at
     the bulb-reflector joint? Should I try sealing the bulb with a thin
     layer of silicon - sounds dubious to me. Or send my wife out
     to the pick-it yourself junkyards, again...?

     Tom, if you just need to get it through inspection, and live close to
     Silver Spring,MD--Feel free to call me, and &quot;borrow&quot; a headlamp from
     my 88 GL.(just bring it back after the inspection,please!!!!) My tags
     have expired, and I have yet to decide to renew them or not. I'm
     thinking of selling it to finance a Westy purchase.  :)

     Sorry to send this to the entire list, but cc:Mail here strips off the
     originator's address...  :(
