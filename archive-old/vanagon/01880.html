&gt; Hello,
&gt; My name is Pete.  If you got this message from VintageVW server sorry to
&gt; bother you again.  If not, please read on.
&gt; 
&gt; I' m new to this service and I'm looking for stories of the road, travels,
&gt; break downs, miraculous roadside phenomeni, etc., about VW Busses and their
&gt; owners.
&gt; 

Hi, Pete,

We have lots of stories, but better yet, we have songs too!  If you are on
the list, you should get a steady stream of material worthy of inclusion 
in your publishing foray.

You will also get lots of useless drivel, like this message.

Good Luck, and happy reading!
