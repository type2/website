Subject: Venlo Info

To Ben - are you in SSVC? It's all in the mag.....and a review of the last
meet with pics...next year there will be an area we hope for Splits from UK
(us), BK (Germans) and the Dutch plus others...we plan a get together on Sat
night...SSVC hope to arrange a week round Venlo maybe taking in Wolfsberg
etc...and some are in contact with me re this already...Cee and I blat over
with 3 kids (well 1 kid 2 adult kids) for the weekend - only 1000 miles :).
SSVC (well me) will be also putting a guide together with tips, advice, ferry
info, routes, maps, costs etc ...well thats my plan....we are also in touch
and liaising with the Mr Big in Holland so if you want any specific advice
just ask. It is a really good meet and very different in flavour than the UK
shows...and the on site sub tropical swimming pool   wow!
This year we are informally designating it the Little International bus
Meet...as opposed to the mega Mighty International Bus event to be held in UK
in July 97...watch this space!  :)....  Dave
