Subject: Re: Rust remover/preventative...


&gt;
&gt;Of all the rust &quot;preventaive&quot; gizmo's i have used i have found the POR 15
&gt;to be the best stuff out there
[snip-o-matic]
&gt;POR (paint over rust) is NASTY!!!! It contains incocynates (sp?) which by
&gt;their name implies that they have carcenogenic properties.....

Hasn't this stuff been outlawed in the US, along with other isocyanate
paints like Imron(tm)?

If not, I'd sure like to know where it can be had.
