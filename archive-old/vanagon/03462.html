Subject: water pump update

Well, the water pump replacement went well.  I drained and flushed the 
system, and that went well too.  I managed to catch almost all of the 
anitfreeze.  I put everything together -- found one pair  of those holes in 
the water pump that weren't threaded far enough and had to put a couple 
of washers on them -- not the long ones this time.    Thanks for the 
warning -- it made me watch for that.
Everything takes too long, though.  It was a whole day blown -- if you 
count shopping. I'm not happy with the bleeding process.  I don't think I 
got out all the air, but the expansion tank just overflows while I'm 
revving it.  Am I doing something wrong?  I've got both bleeders open, 
and the van on ramps at the called-for angle.  Do I have to rev the 
engine continually?  Fluid starts pouring out of the radiator at which 
point I close that bleeder, but I can still see bubbles in the expansion 
tank.  Oh well, I gotta wedding to go to (not mine.)

I feel better having done that.  There was a fair amount of aluminum 
sediment in the container after I flushed it.

... etc.
