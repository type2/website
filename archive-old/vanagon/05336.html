Subject: Re: cyl head temp gauge and sub-zero driving


&gt; Steve: Sami's your man, he hasn't put his gauge in yet. Mine's installed
&gt; and there are bascally two leads about a 18 inches in length.From that
&gt; run two 18 gauge wires to the front gauge. As I understand it you are
&gt; saying these will effect the signal? Hmmm. Readings seem to show about
&gt; normal temps - 350C but what in your opinion would the readings be if they
&gt;  were the incorrect length - too high or too low? DC
&gt; 
Too long ought to read low (more resistance = less milliamps to the meter)
Too short vice-versa.

The only one I ever installed had factory leads I didn't cut, tho, so I 
could be wrong.

BTW, since this seems to be my night for posting, I am intrigued by one 
of your earlier posts on cold weather.  I took one trip thru SD in 
January and experienced many strange automotive effects from the -30's 
temps.  Living as I do in a relatively warm climate, may I ask you (and 
all others reading this, of course), what adjustments do you make this 
time of year for:

  Steering (10W gear oil?)

  Shifting (same?)

  Frozen accelerator/parking brake cables?

  Where do shock absorbers go for the winter?

  Flat spotted tires? (especially 2 blocks later when the flats get out of 
  synch)

Inquiring minds want to know.  I know about the 5W30 motor oil, the 
battery blanket and block heaters, but I had incredible problems with 
every moving thing on the bus.  (And learned to drive in a down sleeping bag)
