Subject: 16&quot; van suspension lift

Thomas, 

Something has been troubling me for the last couple of months about a
communication I received from you awhile back and it goes like this: 

I believe you told me once that the lifting (extra ground clearance) for the
16&quot; van was not accomplished in the suspension but was accomplished entirely
by the wheels and tires.

But now it occurrs to me that we have long been under the impression that
the driveshafts in the 16&quot; van (at least in the front) were longer than in
the 14&quot; van. If this is true, then the longer drive shafts must be to
compensate for an increase in distance demanded by the a suspension lift of
the 16&quot;, not merely a lift accomplished by larger tires. 

What do you say about this point? That is, do you agree that the longer
drive shafts indicate an increase in suspension ride height, and that
therefore the 16&quot; van has a body lift as well as larger tires?
