&gt;&gt; happens. More of a chance in a couple of more weeks. So, any 
&gt;&gt; suggestions on where to static time my stock 1600dp with 009, Weber
&gt;&gt; progressive, single QP. I am at about 1,200 feet.
&gt;
&gt;On a Solex equipped 1600DP, 009, etc, 10degrees before TDC is the right
&gt;starting place.  I don't know about Weber progressives.

I dunno, I thought the stock 1600 with stock compression (7.3:1) was
supposed to be 7.5 BTDC.  10 might be pingy and hot, especially on hills.
Maybe add a touch for the 1200 feet, and a touch for premium if you promise,
another touch if the Weber's are really happening and you can work your way
up to ten, but I wouldn't *start* there.  Better to start more retarded than
over advanced, I speak from experience.  What was the deck height?  Heads
are stepped or not?  Barrel shims?  Compression was calculated or just
guessing? 

Yes, it's me, Mr. over-advanced, saying this.
