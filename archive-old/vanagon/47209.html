Subject: leaking vanagon

Greetings! Any Vanagonites (or otherwise) had experience with rainwater
leaking from behind dash?
After about 24 hours of driving rain, there were slow drips on both the
passenger and driver side (91 Vanagon) onto the floormats. I felt around as
best I could from below: very damp, unable to locate source. windshield seal
seems intact. Any ideas?

Pat
