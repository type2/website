&gt;RE:	Copy of: Ch**slers &quot;inventions&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;BTW: I also heard a radio ad announcing Chysler's invention of the
&gt;&gt;&quot;Auto-Stick&quot; in their '97 models. Un-huh. add it to the list.

&gt;
&gt;Well....letseee here.....
&gt;They've &quot;invented&quot; the following so far....
&gt;
&gt;-&quot;Ch**sler - We invented the Minivan&quot;   (a.k.a. the sh*tbox)
&gt;- &quot;Ch**sler - We've thought of everything&quot; Introducing our revolutionary
concept
&gt;of  dual sliding doors on a van  (what a breakthru concept!!!)
&gt;-&quot;Autostick transmission&quot;   Duh, there's a first..... (Hmm....weren't they the
&gt;ones who also came out with that push button auto trans? looks like that
one was
&gt;a real winner too)
&gt;-a (sorry excuse for a) Pickup truck with 3 doors....(or was that chevr-oilet?)
&gt;
&gt;can anybody else think of any more of their &quot;inventions&quot;??

I wonder if they have some young guy who wanders around VW junk yards
looking for new things to invent?
