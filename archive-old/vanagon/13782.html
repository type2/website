Subject:  Help my brakes on '67

Friends...

Here's the situation.  I recently had a rear wheel cylinder blow out while
coming to a hard stop in my '67 Microbus.  (Needless to say, I did _NOT_
stop, and narrowly escaped death.)  

I redid the brakes myself (Hmmm.), and they were working great.  I adjusted
them so that you needed only to press down an inch or so on the brake pedal.

Over the last 3 weeks, they have gone soft again, now the pedal nearly hits
the floor before it really starts to stop you.  Usually I would need to pump
the brakes at least once to get some pressure.

Last night I jacked the thing up and adjusted them again.  They were already
very close to rubbing slightly.  I adjusted them so that they touch the drum
slightly (as a local mechanic suggested).  

They are now working better.  But for how long???

Questions:

1) I don't want to adjust them every 3 weeks.  What can I do?

2) My brake pedal has 2&quot; play before anything starts to happen.  Normal?  
I got under the bus, and notice that the piston is going into the master
cylinder a good ways, and nothing is happening.  Normal?

3) Would purchasing a new master cylinder help?

Thanks!

- Mike
