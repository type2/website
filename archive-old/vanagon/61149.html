My 1990 Vanagon got to pull a loaded U-Haul from Jacksonville, Florida,
to Hesperia, California (just north of San Bernardino). It was able to
climb the hills along Interstate 10 and 20, carrying three adults, two
kids, and luggage as well as a trailer full of household good items. I
was surprised at the mileage; between 14 - 16 mpg at 65 - 70 mph. The
brakes needed work when we arrived; partially because of mileage on the
van and going down hill in an automatic. Have a good trip.
