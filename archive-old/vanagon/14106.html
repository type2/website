So Thom chisel-and-grind Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; I guess since Steve J's at Red Rock, there is NO traffic on this list....

A-Hah!  So while I'm gone, the sniffer of potent bonding chemicals strikes
a blow!   Well, while you where here home grinding and sniveling about
the front of your '56 beastie, I and the others were actually using our
all-terrain Type II's to traverse never before blazed trails that would
have put Derek Drew to shame!  Guzzling various tasty brews and enjoying
the great outdoors to undreamed of heights.  But I know some day Thom,
you'll be out there too.  I can't wait to see you go rock hoppin' in
your 56'!  ;)
