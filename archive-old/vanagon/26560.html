Subject:       TENT HOME RELOCATES

or, The Yurt Has Shifted.

Chapter II.

I've just switched ISP's so those loyal thousands out there who have 
links to the Volkswagen Canvas homepage should update to:

http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/tents.html

The clever reader will note that one must only change the word 
&quot;polaris&quot; to &quot;supernet&quot; to effect the update.

Ye Old VW page similarly shifteth to:

http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vwpage.html

(Gotta stop reading Robert E. Howard)

PS Gerry, I'll try to communicate with the listserv to unsub &amp; resub 
appropriately, but the daemons are wily fells who oft leave me 
flummoxed.

Crom!
