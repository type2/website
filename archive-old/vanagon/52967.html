gsker, don't read this!  :-&gt;

Volks,

Our mighty list administrator's beer-of-the-month club subscription has run
out, and there are not nearly enough funds to renew.  I'd like to keep this
going, but it does require help from the list (in the form of donations).
The subscription costs $24/month and has been going since April because of
the generosity of many listmembers.  If anyone needs more information,
please send me mail or check out the web page I have set up which has all
of the details:

Thanks, and happy holidays!

-David
