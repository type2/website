Subject: Mcodes no longer online :-(

Hi volksfolks:

I've removed the list of Mcodes that has previously been on my webpage.
Tom Brouillette, the editor of the NEATO newsletter in which many of the
Mcodes appeared, objected to them being there.  I only offered to put them on
my page after a discussion on the vanagon list, and was sent the list by
one of the people who originally worked on it, so I don't think I have
acted callously.  However, since I think that people are entitled to have
their wishes about their work respected, whether or not I would make the
same choices, the list is off my page.  Sorry.

Copies of letters follow.
