Subject: Newbe Fridge Question


Greetings,

 After five months of lurking and searching, I've finally made the
the jump from wana-westy to westy-newbe. 

 I ended up finding a 1980 Westfalia. It's in pretty good shape with
very little rust. It's great fun to drive. 
 
 So far the only problem I have is lighting the fridge. I know it works
because the PO showed me how to light it and it did. But I can't seem
to pull it off. At night I can see that the piezo is producing a spark
when I look through the sight glass. It seems to be getting gas because
I see a flash once in a while and produce a few Conestoga cannon-like
reports. Yes, there is gas in the tank (the stove lights). I've been
following the (rather obscure) directions in the owners manual and the
(less obscure) instructions on the fridge panel. Does the fridge need
a cleaning or &quot;tune-up&quot; now and then to make it easier to light ? Or
is there a better technique ?


Thanks,
