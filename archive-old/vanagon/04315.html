&gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt; doors are for?  Should they be slid to the front or back to keep the air
&gt; flowing or warm the bus up? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any clues.

Sliding them forward lets air from the grill area flow in to the cab.  
Sliding them back shuts them off (However they do leak a little).  They 
never supply heated air. only ambient air.  They are nice for ventalation 
though.  You can keep your van well ventilated using these, the dash ones 
and the heating sys set on blue with out having to open windows or with 
onle one vent window open.  It's much more quiet than having all your 
windows down or back.
