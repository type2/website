&gt; no dis taken i realize that this is a hugley contentious issue that one
&gt; could spend the rest of this fiscal year discussing.
&gt; 
&gt; i for one am pretty much sick and tired of listening to the whole debate.
&gt; 
&gt; i always find it curious that noone outside out of the province of quebec
&gt; can figure out the mentality of separation, and besides if you ask me the
&gt; cree should have ownership of the top 50% of the province anyways. besides
&gt; the quebec gov't (much like most other gov'ts) is too broke to separate
&gt; anyways..

True.  If we look at the provinces in terms of &quot;economic conditions suitable for 
separation&quot; then BC is the only province that MIGHT have a chance.  Quebec would 
be near the bottom of the list along with the maritimes.
