Subject: Harshing on the ignorant...

Dave Kautz posts:

&gt;&gt; I don't think that posts such as the one that follows here are necessary
&gt;  or appropriate. If someone is mistaken, they can be corrected without being
&gt;  humiliated. Other egos who pump themselves up by stepping on the backs of
&gt;  others that they will never encounter face to face can be located on the
&gt;  landrover list if this is a sport that you enjoy.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Mantis shows his ignorance of things VW in the following ways:
&gt;&gt; Blah, blah, blah...

I agree with Dave completely on this one. I read this list regularly but do
not consider myself incredibly knowledgeable about VW's, or cars in
general.  While good natured ribbing is OK, I think that the kind of
trashing that &quot;Mantis&quot;  got was nasty enough that people with legitimate
questions may be intimidated into remaining silent.
