&gt;Vanagon Carat - introduced in 89 (first i ever heard of it), it had all the

&gt;basically, i think the Carat was supposed to be the Wolfsburg Limited &gt;Edition
&gt;of the late 80's.

&gt;anybody out there got one? or a Multivan?

A friend has a '91 Carat and joel's description is pretty accurate; it also has
the pull out rear bench that converts to a bed.  I also would have thought that
it'd have electric mirrors, but I'm not sure about this.
It also has more of a tendency towards the monochromatic look.
