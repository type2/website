&gt;WOW!  I just phoned VW and you're right.  The part is only $1.54!
&gt;Hey everybody,  rejoice!

&gt;( I guess that one part isn't made out of unobtainium or something
&gt;eh?)

Is that screw known as

N 14 131 2 - Screw, fillister head AM 5X15

or some such?  If it is, the reason it is not made out of
unobtainium is that it is made out of oldsplitanium which
has been around since about 1949 and still works.

I cobbled a screw (ooow, sounds bad!) from my 66 for my 84
Vanagon GL.  Then the 84 handle broke!  I then cobbled the
handle from the 66.  Make sure you install a lock washer, or
it will loosen by itself and the handle will come off in
your hand.
