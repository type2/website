Well for the old one I would start with (yawn) a 23 window deluxe 
microbus. 

I like the way these things look anyway, but as we seem to be saying &quot;whats
your dream&quot; and spending lots (unimaginable) amounts of money, here goes;

disc brake conversion, big bore engine (in a lowish state
of tune for longevity), ball joint front axle (I believe the last
year of the splits had these), 12v electrics conversion, well sound
proofed, inertia reel seat belts, decent heating system, nice stereo,
some kind of theft deterant, convert it to a walk through style cab,
different front seats, purpose designed interior etc etc etc. 

I would *not* lower it; my busses have to earn their keep. As
a pretend climber I sometimes end up going up and down rather
rutted dirt tracks more suited to tractors and the like, and the
last thing I want to do is spend my time wondering whether the bus
would make it or not.....


A new vehicle? Well I would take a Honda RC30/Kawaski zzr600r or the
like. But I guess that dosn't really belong here :)


Dream, drool, bugger I'm still at work.

Oh well back to the '70 and my z550 :(
