Subject: 1980 Vanagon Gas Tank

The saga continues. I got the tank out. I called a radiator place said they 
could fix it for around $40. When I got there with tank in hand, the price 
became $150!

There is an awful lot of rust still in it. I can buy one from a local yard 
that looks to be in pretty good shape for $75.

Anyone had any experience with stripping out the inside of a tank with 
chemicals or maybe sandblasting? Then what do I do to treat the inside so I 
don't have to do this again? Should I just buy the used one and hope it's in 
better shape than the one I have? The used one is out of an '85 Vanagon. 
Will it even fit an '80?

Thanks in advance!
