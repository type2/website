Subject: '84 Westy Gas Leak



&gt; On a 1200-mile trip over Interstate 10, on the third fill-up, gas poured
from under the vehicle in what appears to me to be a leak somewhere above
the point in the system where the neck of the tank joins the filler tube
where, I conjecture, there is a seam or a gasket.  Bentley addresses the
gasket configurations in the fuel system by an illustration showing a
&quot;clip&quot; on the &quot;filler elbow.&quot;  I have not viewed the tank from the
underside. I've stayed with a 6-gallon &quot;top off&quot; procedure to avoid further
spillage, so I can muddle through until I get under the vehicle.  Questions:
: Are the filler elbow and the breather pipe, illustrated, accessible
easily from a crawl dolly?  Any caveats other than avoidance of fire by
disconnecting the battery?  The system appears, at first glance, to need a
seal at the junction where the filler elbow enters the tank. The Bentley
section, &quot;Fuel system, checking for leaks&quot; specifies a pump, &quot;US 4487.&quot;  Is
there a Pep Boys' version?
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards.  Tom Hanlon
