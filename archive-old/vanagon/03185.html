&gt;...        I have a much greater frequency of drivers passing me and slowing

and now, the flip side: does anyone else notice that on the interstates,
when you and your bus pass another car, totally legitimate and proper, that
within five minutes (usually two) they will come accelerating around you?
and get in front and slow back down again to their old speed (which is why
you passed them in the first place)?

kinda like, &quot;uh oh. i just got passed by a bus. i've got to speed up.&quot;

and another idiotic symptom of LARB drivers: you are out on the highway,
all alone in your lane, no other cars for 500 yards in front and back.
someone comes up in the left lane (of a four-lane), moving along faster than
you, but as they pull up beside you, they slow down and will not pass. they
just 'hang' out there in the left lane ... leaving you nowhere to go (if
something happens in your lane).

anybody else noticed this? my theory is just plain stupidity is the cause.
they don't notice what they are doing. either that or it's the horse-racing
theory: that horses don't like to run off and leave the 'pack', so the
jockeys have to kick/whip/encourage them to do so. :)
