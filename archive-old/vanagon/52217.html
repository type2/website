Subject: Knock, knock (who, or what's there?)

Hi all,

I'm scared to ask, but...

The last couple of times I've started my 85 I've heard 3 or 4 &quot;knocks&quot; as 
soon as the engine turns, then it stops.  I don't hear it at all after 
that.  Is something terrible about to happen?!?!?!

Thanks, 

David
