Subject: Coolant Flush and Fill (Post Mortem)
Date: Sat, 3 Dec 1994 12:54:50 -0800 (PST)

Emergency over, when I say Post-mortem I may mean it.  The FAQ and 
Bentley say &quot;Raise the front end at least 40 cm higher than the rear...&quot;  
perhaps this should read raise the REAR axle 40 cm higher than the rear.  
I certainly tried raising the front of the vehicle and of course got no 
coolant to bleed.

What I am afraid of, however, is now when I start the engine, until it 
warms up I get these gentle puffs of white smoke coming from the exhaust, 
until the engine warms, the steam comes out briefly even when I start the 
engine warm.  I have probably overheated my engine in a vain attempt to 
fill 2 gallons of blue coolant with the FRONT of the vehicle raised 40 cm 
higher than the rear.

Let's clarify this FAQ, please.--
