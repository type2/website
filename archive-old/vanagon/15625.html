So leo mulvihill says:

&gt; Really! Where can you buy a new one other than the Winnebago. VW has not 
&gt; imported any for 95 and I doubt that you will see any in the future with 
&gt; the new Chrysler coming out and the very good Windstar..
&gt; 
&gt; I can go on vacation not worrying about my car

I don't know where you've got it in your mind that I'm worried about my
car when I go on vacation.  I just load it up and go.  Sounds more like
you're lonely for attention and the Chrysler mailing list isn't any
help.  ;)

As to the future of the VW type II, I really don't know the direction
other than rumors of a 6 cylinder coming out.  In the mean time, I
just enjoy my Vanagon GL mile after mile.

Nuff said,
