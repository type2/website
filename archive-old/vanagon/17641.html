Subject:       Re: Refrigerators, alarms, fans and other toys

Just some comments about alarms.  I have an alarm system in our van 
more for when parked in a parking lot, etc.  At a trailhead, nobody 
is around anyway, and you're more than likely not going to hear it go 
off... and if you do, the crooks will be long gone by the time you 
get back to your vehicle.  I think that the basic precautions, 
whether or not you have an alarm, must be adhered to.  ie. hide all 
valuables from sight, and don't leave anything tempting in view.  I 
never even leave a quarter visible when I go anywhere!  Also, keep 
all windows, doors locked.  I just leave the skylight open on warm 
days.

&gt; Ok, I'm going to try this audiovox alarm and assume that the cooling fan
&gt; in the refrigerator doesn't draw enough current to trigger the alarm. I'll
&gt; post the results. I'm even more convinced to do something after reading the 
&gt; article in Backpacker magazine last night about trailhead vehicle break-ins.
