&lt;&lt; I know I paid sales tax to Nebraska when I purchased my VW in Nebraska,
 then again paid a &quot;sales tax&quot; to California when I started the process of
 registering the VW here. What's the scoop with California making me pay a
 &quot;sales&quot; tax when I didn't purchase it ? It's illegal to sell a vehicle and
 not pay sales tax, so why isn't it illegal for the state to charge me a
 sales tax when a sale did not occur ? &gt;&gt;

California doesn't charge a &quot;sales&quot; tax on used car transactions or new
registrations.  They charge a &quot;use&quot; tax!!  I guess with enough creative
taxation methods, they can charge you a tax on anything!  If a car is sold 10
times in its life the state gets to charge a &quot;use&quot; tax each time!
