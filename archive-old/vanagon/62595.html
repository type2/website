Subject: Where's the ID character letters on Vanagon tranny? 

To All,
I've been trying to find the ID character letters on the tranny of my `82
Diesel Westy. I've found a string of numbers which I believe may be the
case part number but that's it. Any Suggestions?

Bob Bellanca
`81 Diesel Rabbit
`82 Diesel Westy (soon to be 1.9L turbo, I hope)
`84 Turbo Diesel Jetta
