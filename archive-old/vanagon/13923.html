Subject: Do I have the wrong pressure plate?

Ok, here's the story...

My clutch goes out (something snaps, foot goes to the floor, acomplishing 
nothing) so I pull the engine. The tip on one of the forks that holds the 
throwout bearing is bent back and worn to the point that the bearing has 
fallen off the fork and exploded into several pieces. 

I install a new fork and new throwout bearing, convinced the fork was at 
fault and had just worn out.

About a week later, clutch goes out again, same as above with grinding 
noise. Pull the engine again. This time, the throwout bearing has again 
exploded, but the forks look fine. 

Get ANOTHER t-o bearing, pulling out hair with wife's patience ebbing. I 
look at the pressure plate and notice that the splines in the center look 
pretty worn. Upon further inspection, I figure out that the splines have 
worn so much that the center hole which makes contact with the t-o 
bearing has grown large enough that it's not making full contact, and 
might even be hooking into the bearing and causing it to explode. So...

Go out to get a new pressure plate. Apparently there are two kinds for my 
engine? (late 70 -early 71 type 1) One has three large teeth in the 
center to contact the t-o bearing (I always thought these were for 
&quot;racing&quot; clutches) and one with about 12 small teeth to hold the t-o 
bearing. The latter is the type I was replacing, so I got that. 

The bus drives fine for a couple weeks, my marriage is improving and then 
POW on the way to work the same thing happens, I limp into a gas station, 
beg the attendant for mercy and catch a cab to work. After work I return 
to the scene of the crime and the bus has been towed - FUCK!

Stress, Stress, Hair-Pulling, Intermarital Stress, TONS of $$$$, etc etc 
you get the picture.

Finally get it back, pull the engine. The bearing has ONCE AGAIN 
exploded, and the fork looks pretty tweaked. The left fork is bent 
laterally a bit towards the drivers side. The tip of the right fork 
(where the bearing seats) is very worn and looks like it's about to break 
off. 

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

Is the pressure plate wrong? Sould I be using the &quot;racing&quot; clutch plate? 
What are my chances of getting my $ back for the one I used for a couple 
weeks? Is the fork wrong? Is the t-o bearing wrong? Are my engine and trans 
(mid to late 60's) incompatible? And most of all, is this damn bus worth 
ruining my marriage over?

Keep those emails coming!
