Subject: Re: &quot;House Tags,&quot; &quot;Motor Homes,&quot; and Insurance

Clarification:

There were no police reports for my wreck.  I just filed a claim to my company.
 There were no other cars involved, I was on an icy road in that god-awful
hell-hole of Paducah, Kentucky, and just lost control in a high gust of wind.

Is the police report the key to my insurance company being able to check if
I've ever had a wreck, or do insurance companies conspire to a &quot;credit bureau&quot;
type agency or database?

It's been eight months since I filed the claim.

Thanks again for help and comments.

&gt; &gt;I have an insurance question for the many gurus of this list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When shopping around for insurance carriers, most brokers ask if you have
had
&gt; &gt;any wrecks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My question is: how do I answer this question?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have had a wreck, but if it does not show up in someone's database, I
don't
&gt; &gt;want to admit it to a new insurance company. God knows, they're gonna ream
me
&gt; &gt;enough with regular premiums, I don't want to give them an excuse to screw
me
&gt; &gt;for more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My insurance co just declined to renew my policy, I think because of my
recent
&gt; &gt;wreck in which they had to pay out more than the book value of the van.
&gt; &gt;Bastards. Anyhow, now I have to search for a new company.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Should I lie or tell the truth?
&gt;
&gt; Here in Indiana, you can go to the main Bureau of Motor Vehicles and get a
&gt; copy of your driving record for a fee of about $5.  If I were you, I'd do
&gt; that and see if your wreck appears on it.  (Was a police report filed?)  If
&gt; it's been a few weeks since your wreck and it's not on the driving record,
&gt; then I probably wouldn't tell them.
