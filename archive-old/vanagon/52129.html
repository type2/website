Subject: FS '82 7-passenger air-cooled

just picked this one up reasonably....

	1982 Vanagon L 7-passenger
	112K
	Aux gas heater( works great)
	top end (P&amp;C,heads) done at 90K
	Heater tuned up recently
	has lots of little thing done between 95K and 110K
	lots of receipts

	needs minor body work around right rear wheel well...
	decent correct size tires (Michelin xzx 185r14R)
	Great interior, very clean...

	If I don't sell it fairly soon, I drive it for the winter then pull the
