Subject: Re: Stainless Steel exhaust

&gt;Hi everyone.  The exhaust tubing (headers) for the Vanagon
&gt;are horrendously expensive ($1400 in Can.), even the muffler is $600!!  This
&gt;is unbelievable.  This is what my friend paid for his '88 a year ago at the
&gt;VW dealer.  It seems that with the Vanagon, one MUST use VW headers and
&gt;mufflers.  At the prices that VW charges for these parts, this is ludicrous.
&gt;They should have been stainless steel from the factory given how these pipes
&gt;are continually battered by road debris from the wheels.
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody know of a maker of an exhaust system for the vans (mine is a
&gt;'90 Syncro) that makes a system from stainless steel?  I am trying to do
&gt;some research before I am forced to buy more VW shares!
&gt;

Autocavan sell stainless exhausts for all VWs. A silencer and tailpipe for a 
2-litre motor cost about 150 pounds. I don't know about the other bits. They 
have agents all over the place but the address of the main office is:

103 Lower Weybourne Lane
Badshot Lea
Farnham
Surrey
England

0252 333891
