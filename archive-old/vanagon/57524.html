Subject: Re: Installed VDO/PSI Gauge = oil light on at idle?

Help.

While on spring break this week I discovered the oil light and buzzer on
my 87 vanagon.  It was very startling given that I didn't know there was
such a thing.   I limped the van home(100 Miles).  I hope I didn't fry
something.  The light and buzzer came on when the tach fell below
2000k.  If I tapped the gas pedal the light went off. The first thing I
did was make sure there was enough oil, there was.  The van was parked
for three months before this trip.  Please tell what it all means. I
don't have a owners manual.       
 			 ANY Information will be appreciated!!!!!

&gt; Hi Charles -
&gt; 
&gt; Keep your sender where it's mounted.  There isn't enough of a pressure loss
&gt; in the length of the VDO hose you're using to cause the light to come on
&gt; prematurely.
&gt; 
&gt; VDO Dual Contact Senders, such as the one you're running typically come on at
&gt; 7 to 10PSI, so you're probably running at about 5 to 6PSI right now.
&gt;  Considering the mileage (130K) on your engine, it's not surprising.
&gt;  Clearance between the bearings (and the oil pump gears to the oil pump
&gt; cover) have increased over it's lifespan so it's to be expected.  Although
&gt; the factory or Bentley does not say what the standard oil pressure at idle is
&gt; supposed to be, it's been generally acceptable to some to have about 7 to
&gt; 10PSI when fully warmed up.  Problem is the VDO (and Stewart-Warner) senders
&gt; are built to kick the light on about then.  In a fairly new and well cared
&gt; for older engine, I prefer to have my idle oil pressure at about 15 to 18PSI.
&gt; 
&gt; No such thing as rebuilding a VW oil pump.  But you can bring new life to the
&gt; pump by removing the pump cover and remachining it nice and flat, taking the
&gt; gear swirls out of it that's causing the clearance.  Oil pressure should
&gt; increase a bit after re-installation.  Use a new gasket and use only
&gt; Gasgacinch(tm) to seal it as this sealer is very thin, but seals very well.
&gt;  There has to be a minimum tolerance between the gears and the pump cover for
&gt; the oil pressure to develop properly.
&gt; 
&gt; New pumps are easy to find from us or at any FLAPS.  Don't cornfuse the local
&gt; FLAPS by telling him you want a pump for a Wasserboxer - chances are he or
&gt; she won't find it in the books (unless they're looking in the right ones of
&gt; course).  It's the same pump used on any 72-79 Beetle 1600  (VW#
&gt; 111-115-107BK) and they're not that expensive (especially if you don't say
&gt; Vanagon Wasserboxer ;-).....)  Whatever you do, don't get the 111-115-107AK
&gt; pump 'cause the gear tongue won't be long enough to reach the camshaft that
&gt; is to propel it (this pump fit the earlier 1600 dual reliefs with the 3 rivet
&gt; camshaft [You have a 4 rivet-dished cam] - only used in 70 and most of 71
&gt; Beetles and Buses).
&gt; 
&gt; Just keep your eye on the gauge and try to ignore the idiot light until
&gt; you've finished moving and had a chance to get to the oil pump.  Hope this
&gt; helps ya out.
