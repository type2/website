I can't believe this, I leave for 3 days and have to come back and have
to agree with Ric for the first time in 2 YEARS.

Yes Gerry, it is your list and you're in command and have
done a damn fine job, but shit I don't want 2 lists.

I mean hell we all resist change by our natures, particulalrly
those of us driving air cooled vans, and lots of us own both.

As to Bob's comments I too am taken aback, for those of us that
grew up in the 70's and 80's in the rust belt where air cooled VW's are
mostly now novelties, we actually cut our teeth on H20 pumpers.
And I'll say with Vanagons just falling to price levels where
air cooled nuts are just picking them up I don't think they will
be relegated to boneyards.  Heck the writing on the wall is not too
far off for air cooled stuff, with fewer and fewer chassis to put
them 90's technology engines in everything is now &quot;collectable&quot; with
$5k+ price tags all about.   And some day T1 parts will begin to go
the way of T4 stuff, fewer producers, fewer good cores, higher prices,
then see ya.

I hate what is happening, just my opinion.

'90 Corrado G60
'85 Vanagon GL
'78 Westy
1/2 of '77 Westy
and just now '81 Westy a.k.a. the van without a list (I swear its a Vanagon, really)
