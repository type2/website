Ooops, I forgot some info..

For those with auto-trans considering the swap
KEP says that the vanagon trans shifts up too soon;
before the engine 'gets on the cam' I was told.
I have no idea what it takes to modify the shift points,
if even possible.  DOes the governor unit control this?
and can weight be added to move shift points?

Anyone knowlegeable on this stuff? let me know!
KEPs development vehicle is an autoboxer.

KEP mentioned that they _thought_ that the same
adapter plate from the 2.2l Legacy engines
will fit the newer Outback 2.5/2.6l engines. This helps
somewhat for future upgrades (to SVX also!) if you start with 2.2l kit.
The older 1.8l kit is NOT the same.


Thanks, Tim
