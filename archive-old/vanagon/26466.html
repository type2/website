Subject: Errors on Microfiche (Not having such good luck with Jim Ellis)

I'm trying to find two small parts for my 1985 Vanagon and the microfiche at
Jim Ellis VW here doesn't seem to be much help.  While bleeding my cooling
system last weekend I realized that the bleeder screw was leaking after I
tightened it down.  I seem to remember at one time there was a washer that
went in there that isn't there now.  According to the fiche at Ellis,
Vanagons after 1983 didn't have bleeder screws on the radiator, and only the
diesels had them at all(???!!!)  The microfiche showed one model that had
some kind of valve that looked like a brake bleeder valve.  The fiche that
did show a bleeder screw that had a 13mm (for the Diesel) head and I know
mine is a 15mm.  The parts guy gave me a washer that I know won't fit so I
haven't bothered trying.  Anyway, I would really like to find a washer, any
suggestions?

I also have a broken rear speaker mount, the fiche shows no such speaker
mounting on Vanagons.

On the aforementioned heater cable attachement to heater valve, rather than
attempt a new cable installation (which looks like a pain) I bought two hold
down bolts for bicycle brake cables, the kind with the screw with a hole
drilled in them that the brake cable passes through.  I'll be trying that on
the heater control cable this weekend.  I can't think of any reason it
wouldn't work.

On a non-related note.  If an Alabama doctor can get 2 million out of BMW
for selling him a car that had been repainted because of damage during
shipping, don't you think we could get something out of VW for selling
thousands of Vanagons with leaking cylinder heads?  Mine aren't leaking... yet.
