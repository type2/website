&gt; &gt;HEY FOLKS:  We have enough list members to pull off a group purchase of a
&gt; &gt;decent Westy and keep it garaged near London/Amsterdam for our use. C'mon,
&gt; &gt;time share a Westy in Europe, say $100/week initial investment, ie. $5200
&gt; &gt;ought to buy a damned nice vehicle, your second+ years cost would be towards
&gt; &gt;maintenance, based on previous years mileage you used and extent of repairs
&gt; &gt;as normally required. $300 for 3 weeks unlimited driving/camping in Europe,
&gt; &gt;and less the next year(s).......

Depending on how final cost, idea sounds good
