Subject: 90 hesitates when cold

Now that its turning colder, my 90 tends to sometimes have a hard time
starting, or at least idling after it does start.  And once I feel as if
I have let it warm up sufficiently, it'll try to stall out at the first
stop sign/light I come to on my way to work. 

I'm fairly sure these symptoms have been covered on the list before, but
I have to admit that since it didn't apply to me at the time, I ignored
it.  Seems to me it had to do with a temp sensor somewhere, but which
one and how do I find it.

Also, my van just reached 90,000 miles and its time for a tune up.  is
there a concesus on whether or not to change out the O2 sensor (the
cheapest I could find is $108.).  And what else should I tackle while
I'm at it (other than the obvious)?

Thanks,
Ian
