&gt;  Besides his spiffy techno-Vanagon, Joel has a lovely '68 Crew Cab there as
&gt;well, which caught my eye.

I thought that in order to be a rescue it had to be a bus was destined for
the crusher, or rusting away to basket casedom, unless it was intercepted
and brought home and bathed and fed and taught to read and how to eat with
utensils. It ain't like Joel is going to let any harm come to a bus in his
charge (unless he conjures a way to shrink them down and make toys out of
them).

Post your address again so we can send you money.
