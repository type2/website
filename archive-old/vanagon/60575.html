Subject: Syncro/Tires/Viscous..HELP!

Greetings,

I just purchased an 87 Westie syncro.  At the time I bought it, I was
aware of the problems that can arise with the viscous coupling, but
after reading the archives from this list, Im getting paranoid!  Can
someone please help me with a tire question?  Here's my gig:

One month before I bought the van, the owner had the 5-speed transaxle
replaced, cost him like 4k.  At the time the owner had 3 tires of the
same brand and one different on the van..all of different tread.  After
the transaxle rebuild he drove the van around 1k miles before we met in
Arizona for the sale.  The first thing I did after I bought the van was
get 4 new tires.  Here's where I have the question.
On the inside door there is a sticker stating what tires should be used
and proper inflation:

     Tire                  Inflation (front,rear)
    ______               __________________________
  185 R14C                      40/48
  205 R14C                      36/43.5
  205 70R1497R (??)             36/40

So apparently I have 15 inch rims on the van...the guy at the tire store
suggested I use 205 75R15 (made by crestwood?).  Well, I thought it was
cool as long as I had 4 tires of the same tread/make so I went with
them.  Now I wonder how I know if these tires are ok for my van?  The
max inflation on the tires is 35 psi.... How do I know what the
front/rear inflation ratio should be?  Do I need new tires?

Learning the hard way,

jeff
