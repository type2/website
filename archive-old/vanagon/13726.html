Subject: Re: '71 Kombi camper $2500.00 What's so special?

&gt;&gt;There's an add in our local paper for a &quot;71 volkswagen camper.  I  
&gt;&gt;looked at it.  Body is very good, paint is hideous purple, interior  
&gt;&gt;so so, supposedly just overhauled engine, it's not a pop top.   
&gt;&gt;$2500.00  .  Vin #23122xxxxx.  That identifys it as a Kombi right?   
&gt;&gt;Is there some reason they fetch a higher price?
&gt;
&gt;Yes there is.  They want something for nothing.  Time and time again I see
&gt;VW vans for sale at way too high prices.  We all love our Buses, but what
&gt;price do you put on sentiment? 
&gt;
&gt; If this add said, &quot;1971 Ford Van, body VG, interior fair, hideous purple,
&gt;recently rebuilt engine.  $2500,&quot;  what would you think?

Agreed.  I might add that this _is_ one of the best years of busses.  It's 
the first year for the disk brakes and the last year of the upright motor.  
I love mine, but I can not keep my wife out of it!  She drives the thing as 
much as possible.  There are two indicators of a freshly rebuilt engine:
1) a compression check, they should all be high like greater than 120 PSI.

2) A very clean engine. 
Around here, good vehicles are real scarce, and any piece of junk for sale 
has a $1000 price tag.  On the other hand, I have a 76 Mercades Benz for 
sale, which is in real good shape, runs strong, and I am asking $2200.  The 
blue book is around $3000.  Go figure.
