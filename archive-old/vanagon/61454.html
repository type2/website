Subject: Road Trip

I am planning my first road trip in my Westy.  My SO and I would like to
travel North from TN toward Canada.   Does anyone have any suggestions
as to a route and sights to see?
If any one has the first week of June off and is ready to travel let's
make a caravan. Strength in numbers and all.  I truly hope someone will
respond to my request. I want my first trip to be a good one.  
One question how do you keep the rear hatch from cutting you head off
when you raise it to get in side???
