 The fan shroud and oil cooler were the stock items from 1964 which predates
 the dog house cooler, I think. There was a thread a while back on &quot;why #3
 burns first&quot; and I don't no if any of that made it to the FAQ. My personal
 claim at that time was that #3 is hottest becuase it is located farther out
 of the direct air stream from fan to exit than any of the other cylinders. As
 evidence to this claim I mentioned that even in doghouse cooled and in Type
 IV engines &lt;where the oil cooler is behind cylinder #4&gt; cylinder #3 is often
 the first one to give trouble.

 If people want to open up the topic of cooling yet again, I could use some
 education as to the connection between overheated cylinder heads and over- 
 heated oil. I doesn't look to me like all that much oil ever gets out to the
 heads - It goes out through the pushrods, splashes around in the rocker box
 and drips back through the pushrod tubes, right? I thought high oil temps
 were a result of high friction, like sustained high rpm. For instance, the
 wife's MGB has an oil cooler, this is an engine with a loooong stroke that
 turns about 4000 rpm at 70 mph &lt;wear index up around 2000ft/mile&gt;. Isn't it 
 also true that the watercooled Vanagon engines &lt;both gas and diesel&gt; still
 have oil coolers?


 Overheatedly yours,

 Dave
