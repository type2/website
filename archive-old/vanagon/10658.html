&gt;  I've heard that noisy CV joints can sometimes be cured by injecting grease
&gt;  into them using one of those giant &quot;syringe needles&quot; attached to a grease

this should be true, since i've pulled them off and just added grease (not
cleaning them) and stuck 'em right back on. but i tried that syringe business
and i could never get it to work ... needle not big enough?? so i kinda just
decided that St. Wolfsburg/Hannover wanted me to get greasy. :) for those of
you not sure what we are talking about, you stick the needle between the
end of the rubber boot and the steel axle ... do NOT jab a hole into the
boot itself!

&gt;  right?&gt;. Does anyone have an opinion on swapping the axles from one side
&gt;  to the other so as to run the CV joints in the opposite direction and
&gt;  move the wear to the ball races on the other side?

we're gonna see how that works. cause thats what i did when i cleaned and
regreased my joints (ON THE CAR!!) about 5000 miles ago. so far, no problems.
X  &lt;-those are crossed fingers. :)
