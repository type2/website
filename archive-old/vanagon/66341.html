Subject:  Re: Binding when turning




Are you guys sure you're not making a problem where none really exists?
It's my understanding that this &quot;binding&quot; on tight turns is characteristic
of all syncros (indeed many 4WDs as well). There is some binding on my
syncro when making really tight turns, but I don't consider it a problem.
Have you ever driven other 4WD vehicles and made a tight turn? I rented a
Jeep Cherokee in Alaska this summer and the binding on this vehicle in
turns was ten times worse than the Vanagon. I doubt that this binding has
anything at all to do with the VC--it's probably related to the front diff
or CV joints. And again, I think this a characteristic of the vehicle--I
don't think you should expect to be able to turn the steering wheel all the
way until it locks and not experience some binding.

&gt;Big $$ to replace the Viscous Coupling. But you can drive around for a
long &gt;time like that. Just make the air pressure in all your tires exactly
the &gt;same and avoid tight turns!

&gt;&gt;almost like the brakes are on...the vehicle will not roll freely...and
&gt;&gt;it does not bind to this extent when not hot....

&gt;&gt;am i doomed?  will changing the fluid help?  hurt?  i appreciate any
