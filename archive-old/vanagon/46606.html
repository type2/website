Subject: (F) '64 Rambler Classic Ques/NonVW Content

SNIP


&gt;WARNING:  NON-VW CONTENT FOLLOWS!
&gt;I'm going to pick up a '64 Rambler Classic on Saturday that I bought last
&gt;night - she's a real beaut: 72,000 miles on a striaght 6, original *perfect*
&gt;interior (seats covered with these thick plastic slipcovers), everything
&gt;works beautifullly, only *one* tiny rust spot on the room where it looks like
&gt;something chipped the paint - it's about the size of a dime.  All for the
&gt;incredible price of $900 from an estate.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody know of a listserv dealing with Ramblers/AMC?  Specifically, I'm
&gt;looking about info. on whether I AMC used Ford and GM components on their
&gt;engine - the distributor is that suspicious Ford blue, and the starter
&gt;reminds me of an early Nova started.  I did a couple of searches on Yahoo and
&gt;Excite, but was only able to locate a Rambler club *without* a website.
&gt;Thanks for any help.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Justin

For AMC products, you might try a search using &quot;Wayne's World&quot; as your key
phrase.  8=&gt;  8=&gt;

Forgive me but it is Friday and &quot;I am not worthy.&quot;

On a more serious note, AMC must used some GM components because I used to
work on my aunt's 63 in-line 6 Rambler coupe.  That was in 1964 and I don't
remember any specifics except that some parts were interchangeable.  Good
luck with this project.
