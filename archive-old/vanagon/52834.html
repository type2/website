Subject: O2 sensor

hi all 

i had a quick question about how i loose power on my 86 vanagon(terrorist
van). and was told i loose power after warm up due to a bad O2 sensor. so i
decided to call up my local supplier for the part and he says 140.00 for a
new one. i told him id let him know. then icalled my second option and they
said for 70.00 they would show me how to wire a &quot;generic O2 sensor&quot; in place
of the oem part. my question is what is so special about this oem sensor? is
it a 3 wire heated unit or just something with a fancy plug and price tag? 

any info is greatly appreciated thanks, Jonce
