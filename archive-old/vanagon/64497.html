Subject:      Waxoyl or something comparable?

List Maniacs,
I've been looking for something like Waxoyl for a while now as I live by
the beach in So Cal. I did a search and came up with a few sources but came
away with sticker shock (about $45 for 2.5 L in a spray bottle, $25 for a
2.5L refill). Anyone know of another comparable product a little less
pricey? Or , a cheaper source? Buss Depot Ron?
