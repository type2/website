Subject: '72 Bus - Rear suspension sag

Volks,

My '72 bus (1776 upright) has developed a lean in the the rear right 
side. The whole bus used to sit pretty level, ie no noticeable difference 
between front &amp; back like some VWs. Now it is distinctly lower at the 
right rear corner.

Local guru (Ross) said that if a torsion arm had broken it would be very 
noticeable and there would be no bounce in the suspension, which there 
is. All shock absorbers still seem to be OK (they passed the bounce test).

I haven't noticed any difference in handling or ride. I haven't been 
carrying heavy weights or travelling on rough roads, just my usual 
commute to town each day (12 miles return).

Ross is going to have a look next week when he installs my new Gene Berg 
rocker shafts but I thought someone in listland might be able to give me
some clues.

Does anyone know what the problem might be?

Thanks
