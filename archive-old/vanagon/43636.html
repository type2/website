Subject: FS in VA: '69 Single Cab truck

Saw this parked in town (Richmond) with a For Sale sign, stopped by
and checked it out. It's a '69 truck with 75000 original miles on it,
or so he claims. Sat around and rusted for years, he claims. Body is
pretty good for its age, but the paint job is cr*p. Has a &quot;strong&quot;
1600 SP AE engine. Needs driver side utility compartment door plus
tailgate.  Engine sounds/looks clean, but I didn't drive it. Asking
$2500, but he needs money BADLY. Currently he doesn't have a phone so you
have to arrange to catch him at his sisters; email me if you want more
info.
