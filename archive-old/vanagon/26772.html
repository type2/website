Subject: Early Bentley manual (are they really $90!?)

Hello all!  Does anyone have an early Bentley manual (pre '68) for sale or
available for duplication?  I just got a catalog from Parts Place, Inc.
which has it listed for $84 which is probably the cheapest I've found it
yet.  Wassup with that?  The manual for my '79 was $30!  There's way less
stuff on the '67!!!

Oh yeah, does anyone have a left-hand windshield for a '67 Kombi?  I'm gonna
need one before my bus will pass MD inspection.  Also, some bonehead (PO, no
doubt) sawed the original mirrors off and bolted some other things to the
doors.  Of course, they took the other mirrors off too and left me a door
with 4 rusty holes.  Can someone tell me if I can:  1)remove the stubs of
the former mirrors and put originals back on or 2)find some suitable
replacement that I can screw onto the doors.  I need side mirrors to pass
inspection too. :(

TIA,
bob
