Subject: Re: coil over springs for busses with sagging rear ends?


&gt;&gt; It doesn't look easy to me.  I don't want to touch those torsion bars
&gt;&gt; unless I have to.  I'm going to install a pair of those coil-over shocks
&gt;&gt; next weekend - I'll let the list know if they help.  I'm hoping they
&gt;&gt; will raise the rear of the bus an inch or so.
&gt;
&gt;So where did you find them and how much did they go for? Steve Maher told
&gt;me he couldn't find them anywhere.


Yes, please tell! I'd give my right front torsion bar to know.   :^)
