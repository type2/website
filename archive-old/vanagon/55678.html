&gt; now that ive had my 87 westy for several months now....ive tried putting
&gt; propane in three times.  each time is a different experience.   the first
&gt; time....put a pound ion just to check for leaks.  lasted a few days....not as
&gt; long as it should have based on how much i used it.   the next time i added a
&gt; puond....it lasted several months....about right for how much i used it.
&gt;  this last itme i figured all was well...and i would fill the tank(three
&gt; pounds or gallons ).  it was very cold outside...and once full and hose
&gt; removed...the hissing began.  i could see the vapor..or liquid propane coming
&gt; out the fill valve.  not where the propane goes in...but a littl hole  to the
&gt; left of fill, this went on for a while...i figueed it was over fulll...and
&gt; was venting off overflow.  the fill valve is a special type that only permits
&gt; filling to 80%.  i vented off more gas to speed up the process and the flow
&gt; did slow down.  finally it seemed to have stopped.  unfortunately it didnt
&gt; stop...and i could smell propane for days and days,  until finally all the
&gt; propane had leaked out.   my question is...has anyone encountered this
&gt; problem...and what was the solution?  im wondering of the cold weather had
&gt; anything to do with it...?  have i noticed somthing about rebuilding the
&gt; safety fill valve on the list?  any input would be apprecciated.  cant face
&gt; the reality that my tank is rusted thru......since replacement is cost
&gt; prohibitive.  anyone made a conversion to another propane tank? or to the
&gt; little one pound containers?

I have researched the possibility but have not yet made the connection
for an auxiliary propane tank. I bought a Propex furnace through Tom
Forhan and will be installing it as soon as the weather permits.

I found that the standard connection to a small 5 lb or 10 lb propane
tank consists of a flexible hose and regulator. The regulator end screws
into the top of the tank. The other end is what attaches to the Van
propane system.

This hose end is a female 3/8 45 degree flared coupling. I plan on
including in my Van propane plumbing system a 3/8 &quot;T&quot; (after the Main
Van valve and regulator) connected to an auxilliary 3/8 propane valve
(with a male 45 degree flared end). Whenever I want to connect an
auxiliary tank. I'll just screw the flex hose to the 3/8 flared valve,
open the Van valve and open the Tank valve.

Likewise when I want to connect some propane stove/lamp/BBQ, I can use
the same auxilliary Van valve coupling and use the Van propane tank.
