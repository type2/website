Subject: 2 litre Jetta Motor in my 83 Westie

I just returned to California after a round the Rockies tour in my 83 
Westie equiped with a 2 litre 94 Jetta motor.  The van is a former 
Canadian diesel with a 5 sp trans.  The whole set up was great, 
delivering 22 mpg while easily climbing anything Colorado could dish out. 

 The only problem encountered was vapor locking crawling up a Jeep 
trail in the ultra low first gear of this trans.  I plan to rectify with 
better venting for the catalitic converter.
