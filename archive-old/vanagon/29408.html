Subject:       '57 Progress or Problem?!

Well the Pioneer went into the shop last week to get her Tranny re-
mounted in the front.

I don't recall if I elaborated on her past problem, but the front 
tranny mount was split, and so the tranny would twist up and down 
when decelerating, or hitting bumps.

I was tired of the VERY hard shifting, and sloppy back end, so I took 
her to get fixed.

The Revelations:

The Pioneer, has a '67 tranny with freeway-flier gear.  In order to 
mount this unit into the '57 body, a local shop apparently did some 
modifications on the body to get the new transmission to fit in the 
body of the bus.  According to the fellow who fixed it, some metal 
plates were welded in to allow the new tranny and rubber mount to fit 
properly.

He said apparently the jerry rigged steel plates are welded about 1/2 
inch too low, and it was somewhat difficult to get the tranny to seat 
properly.  (He apparently had to give it some torque to get it to fit 
right.)

Anyhow, I pulled out of there two nights ago, and was in heaven.  I 
could shift that gear-shift with my little finger!  No effort at all.
And the bus handles totally diferent!  There is actually some control 
in the steering now!

Life was good.  For 10 Seconds.

Then I realized that acceleration was about 0!  I don't know what 
happened.

All the guy did was drop the engine, replace the rear main seal, 
loosen one side of the tranny, and replace the rubber engine mount, 
and re-assemble.

Remember I have a 1776cc in it.  It feels like my friends 1500 single 
port.  I don't understand!

Could having the tranny hooked back up now, and not fit exactly right 
be causing some weird pressure somewhere that would cause _THAT MUCH_ 
friction, making it be that much of a dog?

Or should I expect something with his work on the rear main seal?

ANY info is appreciated!  I want my little baby to be happy, and have 
some decent power.
