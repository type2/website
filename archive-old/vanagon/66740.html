Subject:      EV door lock problem

Howdy....

My door locks have been malfunctioning.  It has happened twice.  Push down the
lock and all the locks would go down and then go up.  Then the opposite
happened today.  Pull up the lock and momentarily all the lock would unlock
and then immediately lock again.  Seems that opening and closing the sliding
door made it work properly.

Anyone else have this happen?
I am going to clean the contacts.  Anyother suggestions?

Thanks,

Chris
