Subject:      Tires... help fr those recently purchased


Well, it's MY turn.  I'm considering tires all around in my
85 Westy.  I have read all the posts and done the web search (today).
I'm looking to be able to inflate as prescribed, have a low noise/
high load tire that will last (aren't we all!).

Anyway, does anyone have any knowledge re the Michelin MXT reinforced
205/70 R14s?  I would like to stay with a 205.  I've seen some
discussion about 215s but I figure that was for the synchro folks.
These seem to have decent load range and pressure but Harold Teer
didn't have info on tread and no mention was made re: noise.
Anyone?
