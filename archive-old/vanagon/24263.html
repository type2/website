Subject: Oil filter on a '74 transporter?

hey now,

call me crazy but i was changing the oil in my '74 transporter and cleaned the
screen and then noticed a bright orange oil filter...yes...an oil filter. am
i crazy? i thought that the '74 had only an oil screen. i know this engine
had been majorly rebuilt but would someone add an oil filter? hmmm....maybe
i misread hayes and the idiots guide. i was sure that the '74 didn't have a
filter.

hopefully i'll get my axle in the mail from partsplace tommorrow and will be
able to really drive the van for the first time since i bought it.
