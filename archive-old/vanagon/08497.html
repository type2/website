&gt; On the Tits and Ass front (or front and rear as the case might
&gt; be...) VW Trends (you remember the folks that not only brought
&gt; you Blonde Big Breasted Bimbo Bikini Bug Babes, &quot;Sano&quot;,
&gt; &quot;Bitchin'&quot;, etc...and don't have time for the likes of
&gt; us on the list) are trying to get VW Club members to
&gt; buy their mag at a $1.00/month....all you have to do
&gt; is to be a VW club member, and have your club submit a
&gt; check for $12 for each member who wants to buy VW T&amp;A...
&gt; 
&gt; As the ad says: &quot;An offer this good &lt;gag&gt; won't last forever
&gt; (thank Gawd...), so take advantage of this club special. Hey,
&gt; why read someone else's magazine when you can have your own
&gt; copy&quot;.... Kind of sounds like  hanging by the bathroom door
&gt; while your brother is in the can with the latest issue
&gt; of VW T&amp;A...and now you don't have to get &quot;stuck&quot; with
&gt; the sticky pages on the latest issue....
&gt; 
&gt; The ad goes on to say.... &quot;Don't be a mooch, fire up this deal
&gt; today!&quot;   Speaking of firing up....where did I put them
&gt; papers...? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well...you all know how much I love VW T&amp;A....oops Trends.
&gt; 

There really has to be something in VW T&amp;A that I want to read really 
badly for me to even pick it up in the Magazine section on my 
neighborhood (mostly gay neighborhood) Kroger.  Somehow or another, their 
idea of T&amp;A and my idea of T&amp;A don't quite jive.

Of course I would probably be just as embarassed to by it if Calvin Klein 
lent his male models to pose next to Transporters painted in neon yellow 
with those three spoke mag wheels.

Is it not the hallmark of VW owners to be PC, anyway? :-)
