&gt; I drove my 69 westy out into the snow and amazing winds of Kansas today. I
&gt; teach band at one of the Wichita High Schools and was only a 1/4 mile from
&gt; school when I found out about the school closings. We're having wind chills
&gt; of -40 and colder. The bus ran great but I have a slight problem with the
&gt; heat system. I don't have any kind of aux. heater so I'm stuck with the
&gt; heat exchanger stuff. It sort of works but I'm getting this obnoxious odor
&gt; through the tubes. It smells like a combination of dirty, greasy engine and
&gt; gasoline, mixed with a faint whisp of exhaust. Is this normal? (BTW the bus
&gt; is so full of holes I'm not to worried about asphyxiation, (Sometimes I
&gt; even get snow drifts INSIDE the bus)

The fan sucks air from the upper engine compartment and blows it
through those paper tubes into the heat exchangers, and eventually
into the cab.  If your upper engine is oily and smelly, so will your
heated air be.  If, like me, you spill oil all over the place trying
to refill after an oil change, (I have a '71 air cleaner homemade
installation in my '62 bus, makes the oil filler hard to aim at) 
it soaks into the paper hoses, smelly also.  If you smell raw gas,
be worried and find out where it's coming from.

Exhaust is most likely from the combination of leak under the bus
(most likely the infuriating connection between heater box and
header), and leaks into the upper engine compartment from below.
The heater boxes are unlikely to leak exhaust directly into the outer shell
(the finned tubing is really thick), but Bob Hoover has pointed out that
a common leak is where the sheetmetal box fits around the heat
exchanger and a leak also in the exhaust seals could puff fumes
into the airflow.  (I had mine welded for $40)

In my '62 bus the air louvres are quite low, and the bus tends to
suck exhaust fumes from the general vicinity.  My silly aftermarket
exhaust system may have something to do with this, too (soon to be tossed).
