Subject: 86 Camper Engine  Elect Problem..Help

Got a problem..		

There is an intermittent short in the engine electrical system that results in 
a 
dramatic loss of power.  The condition lasts for 15 to 20 secs and disappears 
to again 	
reappear at irregular intevals.

Problem:
	*only occures in the rain or snow(wet snow).
	*only after engine is warmed up
	*checked engine with water spray at night repeatedly, seemed ok.  One 
time got a 
	  real shorting condition..looked like a xmas tree with shorting along 
sparkplug
	  wires.
	
Fix attempts: 
	*steam cleaned engine to eliminate dirt trails
	*replaced plug wires, distributor cap, rotor
	*installed std plugs in place of resistor plugs
	*shielded plug wires with hose to reduce shorting potential
	
Above fix(s) cleared up the problem for entire summer (6months) even with 
driving in major rain storms.  

Come the late fall and the problem came back !#?...

Any thoughts or suggestions?????
