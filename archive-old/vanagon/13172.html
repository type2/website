So Derek Drew says:
&gt; 
&gt; Gerry, 
&gt; 
&gt; My wife is business editor at Newday/New York Newsday here in NY. She is
&gt; preparing a package of articles on the internet and is pestering me to come
&gt; up with the name of someone who toils in the background running a listserve.
&gt; They want to interview the person, ask what it is like, and feature the
&gt; person in a pacakge of articles on the interent. 

Ooooo Gerry, watch out! he might be setting you up to be on Oprah! ;)

Oops!  Maybe you want to be on Oprah? Geraldo?  Oh my God! Jenny?  ;p
