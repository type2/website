Subject:      Re: Looking for alloy wheels?

Hi all,

I have a set of new factory alloys (14&quot; 'Carat') that have never had
tires mounted on them.  I am playing with the idea of buying 15&quot; wheels
and need to sell these first.  I do not know what they should go for or
if there is a market for them.  They do not have center caps or lug
bolts/nuts.  Any thoughts would be appreciated or if anyone is
interested--let me know.

Garth
