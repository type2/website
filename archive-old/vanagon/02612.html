Subject: Re: English 101-South: Y'all

Lewis Grizzard has a really funny bit on
&quot;HOW TO TALK LIKE A YANKEE&quot;
Many southern dialects [yes there's at least 3 distinct ones
in Georgia alone] are such that the words come resonating out from your
diaphram while yankee's talk through their nose. To talk like a yankee 
just say [thru your nose]&quot;I'd like a bottle uh pop&quot; as fasy as you
can. 
  As for you all and y'all where i grew up it
was you -singular and you all or y'all plural.I recall this construction was also used by cicero in his orations.
