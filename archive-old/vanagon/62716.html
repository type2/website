I've been doing this manually for my '91 Camper ever since I read in
the manual that after long hauls or uphill climbs, that you should
let the engine run for a couple of minutes before you shut off the
engine.  I've pretty much adopted this to most of my runs which are
mostly to and from work.  I don't know yet if I'm wasting my time
and gas or if it will pay off.  I have 97K miles with no gasket 
leaks or other leaks except for the stupid little gasket that 
is for the small connection by the alternator.  But I think that
eventually it will start leaking no matter what you do.  I am,
hopefully, extending that deadline a somewhat.....  :)
