Subject: Re: VW Radios

&gt;That's about all I know on this at this time.  It appears that there were
&gt;lots of different radios offered at the dealer.  Does anyone else have any
&gt;information?  There appear to be two adjusting screws on the Blaupunkt Emden
&gt;III radio - one in the front and one in the back.  My unit needs a frequency
&gt;adjustment - any information before I just &quot;wing it&quot;?   Does anyone know of
&gt;a good radio repair shop?

Dean,

My pitiful excuse for an address book once contained a company that did old
car radio repairs. I was once looking for a radio for my '63 bug and
started thumbing through a copy of Hemmings. I found some company that did
both sales and service, but they wanted around $300 for a rebuilt original
radio. Shuh, right!

Sorry I don't have the number or name for them, but I'll bet if you picked
up a copy of Hemmings, you'd find them pretty quick.

Cheers,

Bren
