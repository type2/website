&gt; The manifold is not the plastic piece that's been discussed on the list

&gt; my syncro (87 Westy). But it is a failure-prone part of the cooling system,
&gt; as you have learned the hard way.

&gt; Hi everyone, Thank you all for your responses. Hmmmm, another failure prone part! I havn't heard of this one. I can tell you one thing, when it fails, it fails in a big hurry. One minute I was happily driving down the road, a half mile later I was stopped on the side with almost no coolant. BTW this failed at 166,500 miles. I will report what I find about replacement parts.  Thanks, Todd
