Subject: Re: scooter car query

mr&gt; While at the Pescados fish taco vanagon/bus meet yesterday in
mr&gt; Sacramento, I got my first glimpse of something called a &quot;scooter
mr&gt; car.&quot; I only saw it for a moment, but it was sorta like a
mr&gt; motorcycle-sized thing, but wrapped in a car body. It had I think 2
mr&gt; wheels on the front, and one on the back.
mr&gt;
mr&gt; I'm fascinated! Does anyone know anything about these cars? When
mr&gt; and where made? STill available? Specs? Success? I'm told there may
mr&gt; even be some sort of scooter club, either on the 'net or off.
mr&gt;
mr&gt; Anyway, any info you can give me I'll be very eager to get!

        Don't know if we're on the same wavelength here, but there is a
contraption that I knew of a few years back that was sorta like that. It
had a M/C engine, &amp; standard M/C front &amp; back tires. The body was much like
a fighter jet-pointy front, with a military style canopy; seated 2, driver
in front like an M/C. Had 2 stubby outcropings where wings would be on an
aircraft, a small tire on each. Only 3 wheels ever hit the ground at the
same time-had to have a M/C license to drive it. Controls were automotive
style, except steering wheel was like a jet aircraft. The thing got
incredible gas mileage due to the areodynamic styling and light weight. The
figure I remember was somwere in the neighborhood of 60mpg. Cost was around
$15+ k. I wanted one but couldn't hang with the price tag. Neat little
things, all the advantages of each of the genres it ripped off-except the
off-road capabilities of jet aircraft...
        Don't know anything about how to get one though, been a few years
since I even thought of it.

Peace,
