Thanks for putting these diagrams on the list! I've got the Bentley, but it 
sure is nice to see the wire codes in color. Thanks again to Tom and Jim. Tom

Howdy,

Ok, I got the diagrams labeled, thanks again to Jim Bryant, and I even
included sizes, so you know what you're getting yourself into.  I also have
chassis numbers on them, thanks again to Jim.

I'm still looking for pre-'62 diagrams, to complete the collection.  The
current crop goes from '62-'67.  I would _love_ to have barndoor diagrams as
well!

You'll find the diagrams at: http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/techinfo.html
