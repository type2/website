Subject: '85 Vanagon Master Cylinder leak

Has anyone out there rebuilt or replaced the brake and/or clutch 
master cylinder on an '85 Vanagon?  I have a slow leak that dribbles
occasionally onto my mat.  I haven't done a lot of digging yet.
However, from quick inspection, the clutch master cylinder looks
almost inaccessible.  The Bentley manual is no help.  What has to be
removed to get the clutch and brake master cylinder out to rebuild it?
Thanks for any help.
