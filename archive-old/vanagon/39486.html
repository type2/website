Subject:       Late beetle muffler

I was recently given a muffler from what I presume is a late-'70s 
beetle.  I'd like to put it in my '71 bus, and Bob Hoover has 
provided me with the details of how that generally works (cut the 
tailpipe outlet straps and bend the pipe/outlets down to clear the 
rear apron--thanks, Bob), but the heat riser flanges don't look like 
what I'm used to.  They're about three inches long and have two 
outlets.  It's a German muffler, and I'd like to use it, as it's new 
and I need one, but what's the deal?  What kind of manifold bolts on 
to a riser like this?  Also, the top stud looks like it needs to be _at_ 
1.5&quot; just to fit through the hole in the flange.  Any ideas??? 
Suggestions on how to adapt???  Thanks!
