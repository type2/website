Subject: Wheel bearings

Hello all.
   I have to may have to replace the front wheel bearings on my 86' syncro.
I have some play in the wheel tire assembly when unweighted.  Checked for
loose nuts and balljoints. The play seems to be in the bearings.  I would
like to know of a good source for wheel bearings.  I would prefer not to use
the dealer for obvious reasons.
  I have also discovered a VW only salvage yard near me.  He has parts form
late model to some early sixties, mabe earlyer, but didnt see any on my visit.
