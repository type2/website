&gt;Hi Ed!
&gt;What to do when I go for a vacation for a few weeks? Should I 
&gt;unsubscribe the list, and then when im back subscribe again? What does 
&gt;the digest mode do?
&gt;

well now he's exposed my leaky head.  I volunteered to do something that 
I am not qualified to explain.  now i see a hint of how much trouble 
Claris Emailer's automatic signature is going to get me in.    ;)


good question and I have no idea what the digest mode looks like because 
I've never been on it.  I imagine it is a concatenation of many emails 
that you receive less often.  But let's turn to a listee for the scoop.

Can anyone tell us 

(1) What does the digest mode do?

(b) how many emails are in a digest distribution? 5-10?

(iii)  how often are they delivered?  daily?  several times a day?

(4)  do you get everything?

(4a)  how often is a digest distribution cut and emailed?

(e) should digest mode be used when you are on vacation?

thanks 

now i see how much trouble Claris Emailer's automatic signature is going 
to get me in.  

-peace
