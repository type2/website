&lt;&lt; Anyone had one of these done?  I normally have the front-end done when
 I purchase new tires or notice anything wrong (funny tire wear, pulling

 Has anyone found the need to have the rear wheels aligned?

The rears are easily adjusted for Camber and Toe.  Should be done at least
once during life of Van. Camber will become excessive as busshings settle.
 Very easy to correct.
