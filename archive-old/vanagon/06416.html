Subject: Re- anybody know of problem

On Tue, 8 Nov 94 23:50:28 EST, Cetin inquired:

&gt;braking and the EV braking -- I had noticed that the EV brakes felt a lot
&gt;tougher compared to the vanagon's, when I drove it the first time.  I had
&gt;quickly found out that the EV brakes were nearly impossible to lock, even in
&gt;snow, so I had attributed the different feel to a 'feature' and not a 'bug' 

To which Ric replied with:

&gt;My brakes on the EV are fine. Cetin, do you have ABS like I do on
&gt;your EV? If thats the case, then there is no way they will lock.

If you have ABS as Ric mentioned, I wouldn't expect lockup.

Our experience with the EV's brakes has been one of adaptation; this is our
first van/truck-like vehicle, and the first one over 2400 lbs, so needless
to say, after nearly rear-ending a couple of cars the first few times out in
the EV, I now leave a sizeable gap to the vehicle in front.  In our &quot;great&quot;
state (CA, btw), this invites a lot of drivers to cut you off, but that's
just the way it goes...

Anyway, I also have ABS, and I've been trying for the past couple days to 
get the ABS to spew out the classic &quot;ABS chatter&quot; from the brake pedal
(which the wife's GLI/GTX exhibits), but to no avail.  The EV does stop
straight though.  I'm kinda wondering if the combo of disk/drum ABS versus
disk/disk ABS might explain this lack of ABS chatter.
There's also that LSB (load sensitive braking?) thing that's supposed to use
a proportioning valve to keep the rear wheels from locking up.

Pedal feel has never been overly stiff, and has never gone anywhere near
the floor, even during hard braking

As an aside to another thread (yes, I'm a digester, so I'm trying to get
maximum mileage per post), this discussion of brakes, ABS and snow/ice
ballet reminds me of 4 yrs ago while we were driving through Germany,
Austria, Liechtenstein, and CH.  It was the first week of Nov. and
we were going over Flexan (sp?) Pass between S Germany and N Austria
in the middle of a snowstorm.  Well, I'm here to tell you that ABS
will not stop your vehicle in anything short of a football field,
and you might as well forget about stopping if you're pointed down
an 8%+ grade covered with snow/ice.  We ended up doing a 10 mile 
descent in first and second gear (idle speed) with a foot covering
the brake pedal the whole time.  This was preceded by a near tumble
down a 300 ft. drop into the appropriately named Lech River (someone
told me it translates to &quot;ice&quot; or something like that).
This was the same place where 26 years earlier my dad did a 360 in
our family's first type 3 Variant!  Had I been awake instead of sleeping
in the back, I'm sure I would have added a few stains to the engine
cover...  Toonces the cat who could drive would definitely love this 
place.  :-)

Note of caution:  It is NOT a good idea to use the parking/emergency
brake only to slow/stop an ABS-equipped car.  The back end will lock
(duh!) and want to trade places with the front end.  Definitely not
a good feeling when the road is barely wider than the length of the 
car...

Take care, all

Norman
