&gt; Volks Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am more than a little overwhelmed with the amount of mail I am recieving
&gt; from the vanagon list - 140 pieces this morning.
&gt; 
&gt; Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to a
&gt; couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
&gt; windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?  That way an individual could
&gt; sign on to one or all depending on his/her interests.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a great group of folks and this message is in no means meant as a
&gt; flame to anyone...I just can't keep up with 100+ pieces of mail a day.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments?

Hi Dan -

Sorry, I couldn't resist sending you yet another piece of mail in the
middle of this mail crisis of yours.  I would suggest doing what I did:

mailx -s &quot;Options&quot; listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu &lt;&lt;EOF
SET VANAGON MAIL DIGEST
EOF

Then whenever the digest is big enough to be sent, you get a great huge
mail message containing 60 or so messages.  I have a nifty VANAGON
digest splitter that I run out of elm - I pipe my VANAGON digest message
to 'vanagon', and a new xterm pops up running elm against a nicely
split VANAGON digest.

Each mail message is discrete, I can reply to anyone individually, and
otherwise deal with the mail as I like.  And in my incoming mail spool,
it's one message that I can read when I get around to it, rather than
trying to keep up with over a hundred messages flying at over the course
of the day.

If you run UNIX and have access to perl, then the program I use will be
a big help - I'll send it if you're interested.

	Enjoy
		Jay
