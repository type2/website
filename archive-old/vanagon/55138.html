&gt; What (if any) Eurovan and/or Vanagon comes with:
&gt;  
&gt;  pop top
&gt;  fold down bed
&gt;  preferably front wheel drive
&gt;  2 rear facing seat --OR-- middle bench seat (Either way seats 7)
&gt;  full fridge
&gt;  stove and or sink
&gt;  tables for kids to color on/play board games etc.
&gt;  cup holders
&gt;  cabinets

Sounds like you're looking for a motor home.  
Vanagons ('80-'91) and Eurovans('93+) typically come in either passenger
versions that seat 7 or Camper versions that seat 4-6.
No Vanagon or Eurovan was made that BOTH seats 7 AND has the
fridge/stove/sink/cabinets.

You'll need to choose either the full camping gear or the seating for 7.

Complete Camper models were offered every model year from VW, the later
models being named the Vanagon Camper GL.  These include all the camping
stuff, but only seating for 4.  It is possible to add a center 2 passenger
seat (from a passenger Vanagon) to one of these to bring the seating capacity
to 6, but it blocks access to the refer/stove/sink.  Whith this arrangement
you could set the van up for camping/seating for 4 OR seating for 6.

In 1986 &amp; 1987 VW made a basic version of the Camper model that has a
pop-top, refrigerator, fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating
for 6 (six).

In 1990 &amp; 1991 they offered the MultiVan model that was similar, offering the
pop-top,  fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating for 7, but no
refrigerator.
Neither of these models offers the stove/sink but do have a single rear
cabinet.

I believe that in 1993 VW offered the Eurovan MV which was similar to the
Vanagon MultiVan in layout, but of course with the Eurovan's front mounted 5
cylinder engine driving the front wheels.  Vanagons have rear mounted 4
cylinder engines typically driving the rear wheels.  Vanagons were also
offered in later years with Syncro all-wheel drive.

Good luck,
