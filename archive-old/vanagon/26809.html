Subject: Rebuilding Air Flow Sensor

  Anyone have advice about rebuilding air flow sensors?
The flapper shaft on mine broke at the pin in the flap. So
far I haven't found any in a yard around here (north central
Ohio).  I should probably just buy a new one, but $$$$.  I
could probably install a new shaft if I could find a dead box
somewhere.  I think that's been done before.  The part number
on my box doesn't match what Bentley's says it should be..

  I figured mine was dead but I checked the valves too.  Noticed
a retainer was badly worn.  Uh oh, had a valve seat pressed in.
The head's at the shop now.  I probably had a couple hundred miles
before I popped the valve.  Good thing I noticed it the day before
I was going to head back east....

  Oh well, hints, clues, suggestions are all appreciated,

-John
