&gt;On top of the steering column, between the steering wheel and gages,  the
&gt;usual plastic cover piece was replaced by something I hadn't seen before.
&gt;The cover piece on this van had a large &quot;display&quot; like thing on it.  It wa
&gt;molded into the piece and must have come from the factory.  It protruded up
&gt;from the usual slope toward the gages and presented the driver with a 1.25&quot;
&gt;tall x 2&quot; wide rectangle that looked like it was dark red plastic.  Sort of
&gt;like a warning indicator or display of some sort.
&gt;Any one have any idea what this is?  I'm not too familiar with the Camper
&gt;models, but have looked them over in the past &amp; haven't noticed anything like
&gt;this.

from the info i've seen, that would be the switch for the heated seats.
i think it has some sort of temperature indicator or adjustment.

must be nice, eh? :)
