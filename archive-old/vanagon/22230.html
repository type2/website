Subject: Solex 3031 and 009

A used VW parts seller near me told me that I should replace the 34PICT3 in
my '71 bus with a SOLEX 3031. Don't know anything about it, but he claims
it's an easy install with a kit that attaches it to the intake
manifold...will solve idling problems, increase performance, etc. ...$140
locally.

Comments and insights appreciated.
