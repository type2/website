Hi Ron,

If my memory serves me correctly, I got the information from Brookland in
February or so of this year. I originally had faxed an inquiry to Peter
Russek Publications and they replied that I could purchase the book from
Brookland here in the states. I'll double check on all of this when I get
home tonight and post the results and info to the list tomorrow morning.

See you tomorrow!

&gt; &gt;Hi Ivan,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Without much luck, I've been looking for a supplier for two vanagon
books
&gt; &gt;&gt; that I've heard about.  They are:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The Pocket Mechanic, Volkswagen Transporter 1.9 and 2.1 Liter Water
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cooled From 1985&quot; by Peter Russek Publications, Ltd out of England
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is available from Brookland. I have a fax from them listing the
book
&gt; &gt;but never got around to ordering it. I'll see if I can find it and fwd
it
&gt; &gt;to you.
&gt;
&gt; I spoke with Brookland about a year ago, and was told they don't carry
this
&gt; book.  Let me know if you find out otherwise.
&gt;
