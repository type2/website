&gt;I have recently acquired a '71 bus and a 1641 engine out of a type 1.  It was
&gt;my understandind the engine are interchangeable for that year of van with the
&gt;type 1's.  The engine fits, but it looks like the sheet metal on the front
&gt;(fif) of the engine falls short of the body of the van.  My question...

Mike, I also have the '71 and have interchanged a couple of engines from
bugs, but haven't experienced the problem you describe.  Is it possible that
you aren't using the upright bug (type I) engine?  It should fit like a glove.
If you are concerned about sealing, if the back is sealed reasonably well
you won't have any cooling problems.  There's about 1/2 inch of space at the
front(FIF) of mine also, but it cools fine...IMOH *&lt;:)
