Bill Killian in bragging (and rightfully so) about his EuroVan MV sez:

&gt;Has a table between the forward facing rear bench and the rear facing
&gt;single middle seats. Doesn't have the cooler seat.

Couple of observations...only the Weekender (the pseudo-Westy) version
of the MV came with (in the US) the cooler seat. If you are looking for
a cooler for your MV, try this. We bought one of those Igloo &quot;electronic
coolers&quot; for our MV. When we use it inthe MV, we remove the passenger
side rear jump seat and put the cooler there, using the seat belt to
hold the cooler in place.

There is an additional benefit to the removal of the jump seat, and 
that is if you go camping in your MV with a small child, the front
passenger seat can be pushed  forward, and then reclined making it
into a small bed.

P.S. Joel, I have removed the EuroVan MV script and replaced it with
a German-purchased Multivan script..._dot_can I have my own category 
puhleese...pseudo-German-Multivan-nee-EuroVanMV?
