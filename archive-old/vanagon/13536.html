&gt;    Any other sugestions on heating a bus when it's 20 below out!!
&gt; 
&gt; I use my 9000 BTU Propane Heater that I strapped in my bus.  Sorta worries me
&gt; if I were to get hit, but I'd probably be dead anyway!  :)
&gt; 
&gt; The Propane heater works like a Champ!

 I live in Ottawa, Canada and the temperatures up here can drop to -20 C (Duh,
don't know F temp, but it's damn cold) Anyhoo, a safer alternative to
the propane heater is inline volksie heaters. We used to go ski flying
in the winter and two inline volks heaters were the only thing that
would preheat the engine. I.E. one heats the fresh, cold air, while
the other heats the 'heated' air. One precaution though: don't try
sticking your hand in front of the second one... Unless of course you
LIKE the smell of burning flesh... Cheers.
