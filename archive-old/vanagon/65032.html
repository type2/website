Subject:      VW Service in SE Connecticut?

Hi all,

I need to have my '86 Westi tuned up, and I really don't want to take it to the
local VW dealer - since I think they really overcharge for service.

Does anyone have any experience other service places in souteastern CT? - I live

in the Groton/New London area.

Thanks in advance.

Jamie
