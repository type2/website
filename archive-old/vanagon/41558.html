Subject: Sevierville, Tenn. VW event this weekend?
Date: Tue, 07 May 1996 18:25:43 GMT

Please excuse my cross- posting this...

Does anybody know anything about the VW event at the Sevier
County fairgrouds in Sevierville, Tenn. this weekend?
I'm looking for an old cabriolet and figured this might be a
convenient place to locate a couple of available ones.  How
many VW's show up for this event?

For weekend events like this, when is the best time to go --
meaning, when will the most cars be there?  Saturday?
Sunday?
