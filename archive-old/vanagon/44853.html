&gt;As a 20 year old, I once chased a friend around his own turf in western

&gt;hard to shake the &quot;squid&quot; following him. On one turn, which was blind, down
&gt;hill and right angled, I threw the bus over hard enough to gring something
&gt;on the underside against the ground. Oh, I had some sticky Toyo Z raidials
&gt;on the bus inhibiting sliding. After he saw the sparks, he slowed down
&gt;considerably, he said, to save my life. My motto: always make friend who
&gt;are smarter than you are!

Jim do you have any idea what dragged? Looking under my van, everything
seems to be at least 14&quot; off the ground. If I were to lean my van further
and further, I think the first thing to drag would be the rear view mirror?
After that it would be a toss up between the hubcaps, and the door handles?
