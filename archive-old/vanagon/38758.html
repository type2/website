&gt;That's the idea behind preventative maintenance:  Rebuild/replace BEFORE
&gt;failure.  The airlines, the military, fleet operators -- anyone concerned
&gt;with reliability -- has always done it that way.  The trouble is, it takes a
&gt;little pre-planning and looking ahead, alien concepts to most American car
&gt;owners.
