Subject:      20W50 vs 10W30

Just thought I'd give a quick report on my eyeballing the analog
pressure gauge I put in a few weeks ago.  I originally had 10W30 in
the case since I had the most of that and figured I'd be draining it
out a bunch of times.  Anyway, I hadn't had a reason to drain it out,
so I left it in for a week or so.

With the various trips around town, I noticed that oil pressure was
pretty low.  6-8 psi idling, no more than 30-35 at 65-70 MPH.  Not
good.  BTW, this is an '87 GL with 168K on it, original engine.

After hauling some stuff, I felt sorry for the old girl and decided
to change the oil while she was still hot.  Let it drip for over an
hour and refilled with Castrol 20W50, Mahle (I think) filter from the
Bus Depot.  Today I finally made a longer airport run so I was able
to get her good and hot.  We now have 12-15 psi at hot idle and 50
psi at 65 MPH (4000 RPM or so), at least 35 psi around 2500 RPM.
Much better.

So for all you non-believers with old engines, get the thicker stuff.
 Even with frost on the windshield this morning, she cranked right
up.
