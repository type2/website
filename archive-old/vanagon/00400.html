Subject: battery tray replacement story

&gt; the profesional.  As nor would I.  I just have a piece of 3/4 inch 
&gt; plywood.  And that's all I need unless I want to (or can afford to) do a 

Like I said, if you're not willing to do it right, have the decency to
admit it... I don't know how many VW's I've seen butchered by silly people
with acetelene torches. So it's a sore point with me. I remember checking
out a Super Beetle where some butcher had welded straight sheet metal to
the rusted-out battery tray. There was daylight shining around it where 
the pan and sheetmetal had buckled due to the heat. I said to the guy who
owned it, &quot;You better get that sealed shut, 'cause every time it rains that
lets water in and causes yet more rust.&quot; Needless to say, I didn't buy that
car (not that I was too enamored of buying a Super Beetle in the first place).

Perhaps I was too hard on the guy. Lord knows I have made plenty of
mistakes in my own life. I just was irritated that he seemed to diss
the entire idea of welding new body panels in because of his bad
choice of weldors and equipment.
