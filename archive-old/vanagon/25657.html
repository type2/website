&gt;&gt; Thom, you seem to have missed the point.  The joy is not in the 
&gt;&gt; arrival.  It is in the trip.  Myself, I am focusing what tiny amount 
&gt;&gt; of positive energy I have towards Bob and his task.  He needs it.  How
&gt;&gt; can anyone who is his own mechanic on a 40 year old vehicle advocate 
&gt;&gt; the 'easy' way out?  :)
&gt;
&gt;Well, I have as much fun working on cars as prolly anyone, but at this
&gt;point I would be wishin' I was home, and work on it _there_.  Maybe
&gt;he has no pressing engagements back home, I dunno.
&gt;
&gt;Major kudos to Bob for lasting this long!
