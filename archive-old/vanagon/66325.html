Subject:      Syncro springs and shocks (long)

Hi Everyone.  Well, during the summer I mentioned to the list that
the rear springs of our '90 Syncro Westy have apparently sagged.  The
rear wheels are 3/4 of a degree out of camber (tops of wheels leaning
in), and the alignment adjuster is at its max.  Many of you suggested
not to worry about it, as it's so slight, etc. Well, I've also
noticed the van is sitting noticably lower to the ground as well.
The front shocks seem a bit &quot;soft&quot; as well.

So, I've done some research on this topic and I'd like to share this
with the list.

First of all, NOBODY makes replacement springs for this van other
than VW.  I've been in contact with 3 spring shops, and they can't
get a replacement.  I've also dealt with a major flaps (Lordco), and
they can't help either.  Same for the front shocks.  Again, VW is the
sole supplier of these parts.

Once coil springs sag, they are rendered useless.  If they have a
model, they can custom build springs for about $150 CDN each.  BUT,
there are no guarantees, etc.  They will measuring wire diameter to
figure out the spring rate, and they will only have a collapsed
length, and will have to guess as to it's full height, etc.  Since
the only model I know of is on my van, this isn't good.  The turn
around is about 4 to 6 weeks to get these made locally.

So, here's the poop... Now, sit down, take a deep breath.... these
are NOT typo's

front spring   251 411 105F 952  $456 CDN EACH
rear spring    251 511 105E 952 $506 CDN EACH

front shocks  251 413 031C          $354 CDN EACH
rear shocks   251 513 031D          $242 CDN EACH

TOTAL :  $3116.00 CDN

Now, this is serious money.   Also, my dealer has checked his
computer tracking system, and in the past 18 months since they've had
this computer system have NEVER sold springs or shocks for a Syncro.
Of course it's my luck that it's my van that has this problem.  Gee,
I don't even go off road!

I'd like to know why the springs have sagged.  Any ideas?  The spring
shops couldn't tell me the exact reason.  My van sits 5 months of the
year (unladen), and I wonder if this static load could have caused
this.

Of course, there are other ways to get VW parts (ie. Kyle, etc), but
it's pretty scarey with these prices.

Am I the only one, or have other Syncro owners had spring/shock
problems?  Are there any gas shock replacments for this van?

Thanks for any input.
Harry.
