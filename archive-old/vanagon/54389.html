Hey you guys/gals!

I went back to check my mats.  I stand corrected, they are mirror
inmages of each other.  My impression that they were identical was based
on the cutouts that Ron mentions.  Each mat has two cutouts, one by the
gas and the other by the clutch...just like Ron's.  My beef with these
mats is this...the cut outs are too large and allow material onto the
carpet.  Ron is probably right in that these are not Vanagon specific
mats.  They are however a nice thick rubber.  With very minor
modifications they would be outstanding.  I recommend them to people as
they are the &quot;best available&quot;.  They would be &quot;German&quot; with slight
modifications to those pedal cutouts!

Hope this helps!

&gt;
&gt;I just received three sets of the Vanagon mats that I ordered for list 
&gt;members who asked for them (see archives).  Now that I've seen them, I can 
&gt;tell you a little more about them.  They are heavy black rubber, with 
&gt;Vanagon written on them in brown and white.  Unlike the pair that Parts 
&gt;Place sold Chris Pittack, these ARE mirror image left and right mats. 
&gt;
&gt;As far as fit, I tried them in my '85 as best I could without removing the 
&gt;cardboard packaging (since they're not my mats).  The notches to fit around 
&gt;the wheelwell arches are exactly correct for a Vanagon, as is the indent 
&gt;for the gas pedal.  However, there are indents on the opposite side of the 
&gt;drivers side mat (to the left of the clutch pedal), and on both sides of 
&gt;the passenger mat, that aren't neccessary in a Vanagon.  I get the feeling 
&gt;that the mat is probably cut from a template that is meant for several 
&gt;vans, not just the VW, but nonetheless I was surprised how well it fits 
&gt;around the wheelwell arches (unlike the generic Pep Boys mats I have in my 
&gt;'85.)   Hopefully, one of the three listmembers who receives them can give 
&gt;us a report after actually using them.
