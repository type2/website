&gt; 
&gt; only find a vanagon to stuff it into.  Diesel vanagons are too slow for
&gt; some people, but I think a 65hp 5 cylinder would make a big difference.  

This is why I asked previously about the new 1.9 liter tall block
diesel with the D shaped intake ports, the bigger four would certainly
fit and I figure it must have around 60-70 hp, but I don't know, the
only importer I have seen EUROSPEC, doesn't make any hp claims, Euopean
Car reviewed a diesel Golf with one and said it was incredible for a
diesel, no &quot;wall of celophane&quot; I think were their words in 5th at high
revs, seems that this would be just the ticket for a diesel Westy,
should give you comfortable 60 mph cruising without so much trouble on
grades and with a little safety margin, certainly mileage would still be
incredible.  Our dealer still had a new '84 (I guess) diesel in '85 the
year mom and dad started looking for a replacement for the '76 Bus,
having owned a 1500 cc diesel Rabbit, they took it out for a test drive
and I got to try it as well, scared all of us to death, slower than
dad's '65 he thought, This was no heavy Westy either, I admire you
people using those things, takes a special sort, mom and dad waited and
bought a '86 2.1 Wasserboxer which we all know is by no means
overpowered itself, particularly hauling a pop up camper.
