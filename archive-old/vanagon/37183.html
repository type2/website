Subject: Re: Tires

With all this Conti tire talk, and a dealer price of $100+ mentioned,
PLEASE
EVERYBODY, remember that The TIRE RACK (800)428-8355 is selling the
185R14 reinforced Conti for $54 EACH, likely about $5 shipping per, and
they
will sell you as few as you want, furthermore XZX reinforced about $65
last I checked.  They have a multitude of reinforced or C load range 6
ply rated
14 inch diameter tires under $75 each.  I have for the Corrado, the
parent's '77
Westy, mom's '90 Passat and others bought tires from them, they are
easy to
deal with and quality/price is outstanding.  On the other hand the Sear
Trailhandlers A/T's I put on the '78 last fall 195/75R14 C are doing
very nice
as well and performed exceptionally through a lot of snow this winter. 
They were local available and about $60 per on sale.  An OK choice IMHO
though
they do lack a little dry traction compared to a XZX or Conti, due I
think to the
more aggressive M+S design
