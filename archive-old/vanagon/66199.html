Subject:      aux heaters

I'm looking into a heater for the winter.
I think i've decided on the Platinum Cat by Thermal Systems.
I do have a few questions:

Is this the heater I want?

Do I go with the big (6000 BTU) or the small (3000 BTU)?

Will I need an aux battery?  How long till my battery dies on me?
(I do leave the van parked for days at a time, and would want the heater on).

Should I run another line from the tank under the van, or should I just
get another tank?

Where should I put the vent line at and how?
(I have heard venting it into the wheel well or on the floor.  The
wheel well sounds bad because wont it get plugged up with snow there?)

Anything else that would be useful to know?


As usual, thanks for all the help, I would be S.O.L. without it.
