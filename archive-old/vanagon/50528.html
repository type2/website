Subject:       Re: Should 1982 bus steer straight?

 
My '82 pulls but only (I believe) because I need an alignment, a good set of properly inflated 
tires and probably some bushings on the upper control arms. Does anyone have a reasonably 
priced source of these? VW dealers want about $70.00 ea (need 4 to do both sides).. pain! Napa 
Dealers carries them for about $40.00 ea. This is still too pricey for what they are! When 
these go you get clunking when you brake or go over rough terrain. After replacing these on my 
'84 and putting on some nice LT tires (properly inflated of course) I had the front end aligned 
and it goes quite straight (assuming I'm on a really flat road without a crosswind). It is 
sensitive... but it does go straight. 

Hope this gives you some insight.

1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:

Is it normal for the steering to drift slightly to the left when coasting
or driving on a flat road? Someone said all busses pull to the left - can
this be true? If not what would be the most likely cause? In case it is
relevant the suspension at the front of the bus is a bit lower than the
rear - is this normal?
