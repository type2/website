thom, there are also two types of the earlier aprons.  one is just like 
you described and the other has a slotted hole in the notch for a hand 
crank starter handle.  i think that goes up to around 1958 but not sure.
take care and God BLess

&gt; &gt; 1. &quot;correct&quot; engine lid for 1965 van (does anyone know what years of engine
&gt; &gt; lids are &quot;correct&quot; and interchangeable?? I could use two of these lids IN
&gt; &gt; GOOD CONDITION puh-leasse no rusted out dented up ones ( i already have
&gt; &gt; those ;)
&gt; 
&gt; The correct one for your year will have the lip over the license plate
&gt; light and a church key hole.  And engine lid from '55 1/2 to '67 _will_
&gt; fit, provided you have the correct _apron_ for the lid.  But you want
&gt; the one that is correct for your bus...
&gt; 
&gt; There are 2 styles of aprons.  (splits only here)
&gt; 
&gt; The earlyones have a &quot;notch&quot; in the middle,t hat is actually offset slightly,
&gt; and a metal tab brazed on for the latch.  I think these go up to '65
&gt; The engine lids that go with these come in 3 flavors:
&gt; 1 - the center brakelight ones with the (duh) center brakelight mounted on a 
&gt; flat panel above the license plate - up to '56, although I've seen some
&gt; '57s that claim that they were factory.  The clue to whether or not a
&gt; center brakelight is &quot;correct&quot; (not you Michael, just in general) is 2 sets
&gt; of wires coming out of the loom at the top/rear/center of the engine compartment
&gt; instead of just one.  The one set is for the licenseplate light, the second is
&gt; for the brake light.  There will also NOT be a brake light circuit in the
&gt; two tail lights.  This means you should also have &quot;bubble&quot; tail lights.  The
&gt; '57s that claimed to have center brakelights also had brake circuits on
&gt; the sides, which to me proves they don't know what they are talking about...
&gt; 
&gt; 2 - same as above with no light, but with a flat panel where the light 
&gt; shoulda been.
&gt; 
&gt; 3 - has a lip (and thus not a flat panel) above the license plate light.
&gt; 
&gt; all three of these have the church key latch
&gt; 
&gt; the later aprons have no notch, and have a screw-on tab to catch the latch
&gt; The engine lids for them have the lip, and a larger, more sqare hole for
&gt; the latch.
