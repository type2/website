Subject: 	'73 Toyo-Westy

Hi all,

	I am hoping to pick up a Westy pretty cheap. Today I went to look
at a '73 Westy I saw in the paper for $900. Trick is that the engine came
out of a Toyota a Toyota. The current owner says it came from a mid-sized
truck, but she's only had the bus for a couple of months and doesn't know
for sure.
	Anyone ever had experience with this sort of configuration?

Thanks,


Don Bradley
