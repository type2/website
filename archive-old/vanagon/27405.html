I spent a little time trying to debug my idiot lights again.

Oil:  
	The switch appears to work properly, but the message isn't gettin
to the front of the bus.  Hmmmm

Gen:
	The lead on the genrator where the magic green/blue wire goes
is grounded with key on and engine on, but not with key off.  Does
this mean the voltage regulator is bad?
