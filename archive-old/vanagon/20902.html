does anyone have a pair of pull handles for a 60 crew cab that are in 
nice shape?  i need a nice pair.  i also need the side outer handle for 
the back door.  inner spring is not importand as is the key.  i just need 
some nice solid crome that will polish up good.  email me if you can help.
thanks in advance and God Bless

Did the 60 Doublecab have door pull handles?  I recently bought this same
model doublecab, unfinished, and it came with what appears to be original
door panels.  I don't recall seeing door pull handle holes, but it does
have the little pockets, which could function as door pulls.

Anyone know for sure about 60 Type IIs?
