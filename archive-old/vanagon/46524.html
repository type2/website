&gt; &gt;I'll be signing off this list today, but if I can reciprocate in any way by
&gt; &gt;giving advice on dog training or behavior, or choosing a dog, or anything
&gt; &gt;like that, I'd be more than happy to help.

&gt; uhhhhh .... can we get some advice on how to train maybe some of these
&gt; people on the list???? :)

Go ahead Joel, throw the ball, I'll get it!  Honest I will.  But you better
be ready to throw it again and again and again.....   ;)
