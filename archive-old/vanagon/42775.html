Stop tormenting the lad. Tell him the truth.

A barndoor is a vehicle that a deranged Hitler designed on a matchbook
while he was in the last stages of syphilis. It has extra space for
passengers in the engine compartment, and you fill it up with gas by
spraying it into the oil fill tube. It was powered by a 3.5 hp Briggs &amp;
Stratton lawn-mower engine which was cooled by shoveling Teutonic snow over
it during frequent rest breaks. This is a problem for certain restorers in
Phoenix where there is little snow, but barndoor impressarios are never
daunted (and also barndoors never run, so the cooling problem is academic).

I think it is Friday in Thailand or it will be by tomorrow.
