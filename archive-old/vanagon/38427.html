Subject: Transporter Ale


Ok....I've had a few positive responses for a V_at_L New England gathering =
at LiMBOs Rites of Spring...especially since I mentioned homebrew...

I need a little help here with the homebrew. Jim D, or whomever...anyone =
have the LiMBO logo available to be printed? What I want is the LiMBO =
logo with the following addition  &quot;Transporter Ale - 1996&quot; and put on a =
beer label sized format.

I will be brewing a batch of Brown Ale which can be served either =
chilled or at &quot;room temp&quot; depending on what the outdoor temp is the day =
of Rites of Spring.

So let me know who can get the &quot;prototype&quot; of the lable together.

Thanks in advance,

Ric
