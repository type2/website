Subject: Rebuilding '85 Motor

Any tips or traps concerning rebuilding an '85 motor will be appreciated.

The body on my '85 Vanagon Camper is in good condition, tires are new, 
and brakes have just recently been gone through.  110,000 miles.

However, about 700 miles from home, a coolant pipe rusted through and the 
motor got hot.  I wasn't there, but my wife says she stopped as soon as 
it got hot and didn't drive it again.

The VW dealer in Rapid City, SD, where she towed it said it leaked from 
the head gaskets at 14 lbs, not a trickle or drip but a heavy leak.  
(What that means, I don't know).

I won't swear it hasn't been hot before, because we've had trouble with 
the sending  unit, but I only know of one other time several years ago 
the water pump went out.

In any event, all in all, I've essentially decided to go trailer the van 
home and have the engine rebuilt.

All comments, suggestios, and observations on prices, things to watch 
for, upgrads to include,procedures to avoid, other repairs to check at 
the same time, etc., etc., are most eagerly solicited.
