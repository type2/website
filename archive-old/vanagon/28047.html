Subject: RE:unknown engine thingie

&gt;My buddy just bought a t-1 engine, (1973, DP 1600, full compliment of
&gt;emmissions junk), and found somthing that neither of us is
&gt;familiar with (perhaps because we try to stay pre-'68 in our
&gt;seemingly neverending quest to avoid Utah's emissions restrictions
&gt;on simple to maintain and diagnose powerplants).  There's a line
&gt;leading from the driver's side heat riser pipe to the manifold at the
&gt;base of the carb.  I haven't seen it yet, but he says it looks stock.
&gt;Any ideas as to what this might be?

Sounds like a carb pre-heat hose to me, helps stop those nasty cold 
 weather startup ickies. I hope you have been paying attention to the 
 thread about the centralized emissions in NJ, it is coming our way. 
 Never mind that Geneva pumps large enough chunks of sulfer dioxide 
 into the atmosphere to block the sun.
