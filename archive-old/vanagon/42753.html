&gt;forgive my ignorance, but what is the legend of &quot;Mrs. Fields' Cookies?&quot;

The cookie legend (also the Nieman Marcus Cookie Legend) is the story of a
guy who has a couple cookies, likes them, asks for the recipe, they give it
to him, and he ends up with a bill for like $200 for it, so as revenge he
posts the recipe.  The recipe is just a basic cookie recipe.  Its a proven hoax.

There's another one about someone who takes in a dog they found hit by a
car, and get stuck with a bunch of vet bills, and plead for money to fix the
dog/pay the vet.

Yet another for poor timmy (whoever) who needs money for a new
liver/spleen/brain etc.

Then the guy who puts the JATO unit on the Nova (at least they didn't ask
for money)

The basic rule is, if its not germane to the list, don't post it.
Especially if it says to post it everywhere.  Treat with skepticism every
weird email that comes your way.
