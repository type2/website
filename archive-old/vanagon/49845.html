Subject: Re: mechanic says NO to bars leak

Either this owner/mechanic is BSing, or the one at the Lehigh Valley
VolksWagen (the dealership is owned by the former service manager there)
is too careless.  I was shy about using the stuff until I asked him, and he
said it will not harm the '87 vanagon's cooling system (I specifically
asked about Bars' Leaks -- I do not know about other stuff).

&gt;My leak is sufficiently negligible that I can hold off for now anyway,
