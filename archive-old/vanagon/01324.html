APPLAUSE! APPLAUSE! APPLAUSE!  :) :) :)
sorry, folks. i LIKED that one! :)

as an aside, my neighbor used to be a claims adjuster for an insurance
company. one day he gets a call to go look at a new cadillac that had
been involved in a wreck.

it seems that this old farmer had saved up his money and come to town
and bought a brand new cadillac. well, it was late when he left the
dealership ... long about getting-dark-time ... and it wasn't too warm,
so he had all the windows down as he drove back along the dark country
roads.

and, sure enough, a black angus bull had gotten out.

WHAM! the left front fender of the cadillac struck the head/neck/shoulders
of the right side of the bull.

now, as some of you may know, sometimes it happens when an animal dies, that
its bowels tend to loosen ... suddenly and dramatically. this was such a
case. Loosened Bowels went ALLLLL over the car, from the windshield on back,
as the bull was struck and knocked over. ALLLLL over the interior of the car.

my neighbor, the adjuster, said he took one look at the car and totalled it.
fender damage? maybe $800 (back then). but, he said, he knew there was NO
way they could ever get the interior cleaned out. the farmer got another
cadillac.

moral of the story: the insurance company wanted to get a law passed. to
require bulls to wear reflectors. :)
