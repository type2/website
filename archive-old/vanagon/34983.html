&gt;&gt;It's soooo nice to cruise up hills at 70 in 4th...   :^)

&gt;        Anybody else notice that everytime Steve posts about his V6anagon
&gt;he goes up hills just a little faster? Last post said 65 in 4th, now it's
&gt;70. Hmm, methinks the man is bragging...    ;-)


Sorry, Eddie, it was a typo. Shoulda read 700. I'm not responsible!

P.S. How should I break it to him, that this car can actually EXCEED
70 mph if I ask it to? Yes, on hills, even.
