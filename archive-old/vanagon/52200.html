&gt;  The transmission was just rebuilt on my 86 Syncro.  Now, shifting is tight 
&gt;  from 3rd down into 2nd and down into 1st.  Generally it is OK strating in 
&gt;  1st and shifting into 2nd, though at times it's tight.   Shifting up into 
&gt;  3rd is tough sometimes, but it doesn't seem to follow a particular pattern.
&gt;  
&gt;  Is it possible the first two gears were not aligned correctly? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
   I had this problem in my 1980 Vanagon. Turned out to be the
   pilot bearing in the end of the crank shaft was bad. It would only
   cause a problem after the engine got hot.
