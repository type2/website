Just wanted to add another data point to the long dormant tire thread.

First a little intro: 
   - mine's a 90 GL, bought used in 93 with about 20k on the odo and
     (I'm sure) the original Michelin MXL's.  
   - at about 32k the left front tire developed a bubble, so on went the
     spare MXL (which still had the little new-tire knobbly bits on).  
   - at about 35k the right front developed a bubble and, since I was
     out in the sticks, on went a no-name brand non-reinforced
     replacement.  Handling wasn't as bad as I expected, just a little
     bit more mushy.
   - now (at 37k) the right rear got a bubble (quelle surprise!)...time
     to invest in real tires.  Doesn't seem like they gave a lot of
     mileage and there was a fair amount of tread left on all the tires,
     although they were 5 years old. 

We all know how hard reinforced 205/70R14's are to find but NTW
recommended Pirelli P300's, which have nylon/steel plies instead of the
usual polyester/steel.  They are claimed to be as stiff as reinforced
tires, in fact the Pirelli brochure recommended them as &quot;all season
performance for vans, pickups, SUV's, and 4x4's.&quot;  Treadware index is
330, traction is A, and temp is B.  Price is $73 plus the usual balance,
valve stem, etc.  They seem very quiet and handle well in corners (ok,
as spirited as you can get in cornering in a Vanagon).  I hardly ever
run a full load in the van so I think these will do quite nicely.  

As a side-note, the tire guy seemed pleasantly surprised at how well a
vanagon handles (ok, so he didn't drive it across a bridge in high
winds).  I wonder what he was expecting?
