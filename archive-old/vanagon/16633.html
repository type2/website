Roving through the junkyard had me wondering about a lot of
things today.  My next question is when did they switch from
the under the dash vented dealer installed A/C system to the
roof mounted similar to pre '86 Vanagon style unit.  A '73 I
briefly owned had the under the dash unit, the Bus was from
Arizona and also oddly enough had the sunroof and a gas heater,
Type IV engine but early bodywork.  A '79 I saw in the yard had
the Vanagon style unit and was complete except for the compressor
which had gone with the engine apparently.  I wonder because this
would be really cool (bad pun) in my Westy.  Now I realize I don't have
nearly the power to run it with the stock 1600 but I plan to later
go to a 1776 or maybe even slightly larger powerplant and as the
system is available now cheap as the Bus was about to be crushed
with it in place I need to know.  I was figuring about seeing what
that company I.C.E in Hot VW's offers in the way of compressors
and mounts to fit on the upright engine but intended to use the
stock front mounted evaporator and condenser units off the '79 for
a finished look.  Did dealers ever put A/C in a Bus camper, does anybody
have one?  Any opinions as to how it would fit against the paneled
headliner?  Is it just a ridiculous idea anyway?  The guy said he
sold the engine quite recently so the system and lines might not
be too corroded at the moment, everything looked pretty clean in fact,
the Bus was from FL and was junked from taking a nasty side hit.  Anyway
any words of wisdom would be appreciated, I'm not looking to turn the
camper into a walk-in cooler just to be able to get the occasional 90
degree day down to the mid to high 70's would be as good as our '86
was ever able to manage.
