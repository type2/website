Greetings!

I have this interesting challenge --

I have a '71 bus with the brake fluid reservoir behind the front 
seat. It has been leaking at the seal between the bottle and
the tube. The seal, which looks like a cross between a bushing
and an O-ring, is toast (well, more like goop). I haven't
found a replacement through the usual channels (WCM, &amp;c). I
was thinking about wrapping the base of the bottle with string
or duck tape or something, then putting the clamp back on.
Anyone been through this before?

Thanks.
