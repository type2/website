&gt; It was at this point that I remember
&gt;someone from the list recommending using WD40 to loosen up glue when removing

&gt;enough it started to come off. I then soaked a rag with the WD40 and the rest
&gt;came off. 

Always remember that the Volksinstitute Fur Physiche reports:

Duct tape  --- Holds the universe together;
WD-40  ------- Takes the universe apart.

We are in the test phase of determining whether drywall screws are an
adequate substitute for duct tape.
