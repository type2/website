Subject: Kelly Park Show - April 9th



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you going to Kelly Park this year?


 I will be at the show.  I'm only about 20 minutes away.  Where are you now?  I 
work in Los Gatos and used to drive by Tait occassionally to show people what a 
21-window was and notice that you are no longer there.  (Sorry, I know this 
isn't appropriate for the whole groupl, but I don't have your e-mail address.)

For all:

On April 9th at Kelly Park just outside of downtown San Jose there is a VW show, 
probably one of the first in No-Cal for the season.  (Last weekend there was a 
SOTO meet in Long Beach, but I heard it was pretty small.)

The Kelly Park show has continued to grow and get better each year.  I highly 
recommend it.  I think it's $5 to walk in, $10 for a vehicle including the 
driver.  I'm not sure if swap space is $20 or $30.  

If anyone needs more details, let me know.  I've got the flyer at home and can 
relay all of the info.

Good to hear from you Brendan!  Still getting out on the mt. bike at all?  I'm 
the guy you met up off of Shannon Rd. a couple of years ago.  Still working on 
that beat up Deluxe you saw.  It's coming along.

Aaron
