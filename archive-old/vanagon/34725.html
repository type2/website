Subject: EV price/value - Seattle, Carter VW

Thanks to all who responded to my EV price/value inquiry. While it took 
two faxes, I did finally get the following response from Carter. I've 
decided to pass on these vans so the search contiues. 

One EV at another dealer, a red GL, has only 22k miles, AC, convenience 
package, 5 spd, is interesting but still on the high side at about $17k.
Some interesting points about this van, while the name plate said GL, it 
had grey bumpers and a sliding side window of a CL. The interior was all 
cloth, so they must have run out of red bumpers that day.  
I asked them to pull the service record which seemed pretty clean, some 
pesky electrical, noise, and alingment problems, but nothing too major or 
recent. In the glove box was all the service tickets so I learned that it 
was a local car owned by a Tim (or Tom?) W------ski. (I couldn't remember 
the name because I was trying to keep the tickets from being eaten by the 
8 month old who was sitting on my lap....) Tim (or Tom?) are you on this 
list and do you recognize this van? Email me directly if you are and do. 

Not giving up yet,
