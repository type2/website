Subject: Gas prices up north

Less than 2 weeks to go on the Inuvik trip, and I'd like to enlist the 
help of vanagon list members to tell us Inuvik trekker what we can expect 
in terms of gas prices enroute.

*** NOTE: in the interest of saving bandwidth, please respond with gas 
prices only for the areas concerns.  If this question is of interest for 
other locations, then please change the subject line and start another 
thread.  Gerry will love you.

So I'll sketch out our route below and folks can feel free to reply with 
prices for areas they live in.  Please also include the date the price 
applies to.
