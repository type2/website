Subject: Speed and some minor things

        Greetings. I have a couple quick questions.
1) The area I live in has an average speed limit of 60 km/hr. I'm not sure
if its better to stay in second at 60 with the engine at high rev, or
wether its better to drive in 3rd. I assume (ass u me)
that second would be better but would like some conformation.

2) I have this mystery plug in that is inbetween the cigarette lighter and
the right side vent. Its obviously some sort of add on but I cant even tell
what kind of plug it is. It's quite weird. It seems that the plug has both
male and female characteristics. Its a 1/4 plug slot with a small nipple
sticking out, yet it also has part of a RCA housing inside. Any clues?

3) Would it be easier to hook up a spare battery under the backseat, or
would it be better under the drivers side?
