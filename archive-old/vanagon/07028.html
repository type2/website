Sorry I lag so much.  But here's a response from me.

&gt; Each vehicle brings 1/4-1/3 lb. seafood or fish per person in their
&gt;      vehicle for additing to the community pot chowder, AND signs
&gt;      up for one of the following to contribute to the potluck.  You 
&gt;      could make this beforehand, or on the premises, depending on
&gt;      the item, and/or your mood, style, etc...

I was thinking of calamari rings, I think they would go well in a 
chowder.  Of course I have no idea how to prepare them for a chowder, so 
I hope someone else does.  Otherwise I'll get some plain ol' fish.

As far as your list of extras, I was thinking of bringing a bunch of 
salsa that I make, and some chips.  And a few loaves of bread.
