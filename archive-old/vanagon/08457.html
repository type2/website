&gt;Halloooo one and all,

and back!

Check if your timing is way off also, that drops power greatly. If they 
fouled up valve clearance, fouling up the timing is feasible. This will burn 
valves rapidly (&lt;&lt;100 miles), so don't drive much. I second Joels comment, 
get another garage to check the work. If your van had power and didn't 
produce any smoke before this garage worked on it get the compression 
checked, this will indicate bad valve/rings if it is low. I had a VW factory 
trained mech, 25 years experience, set up my timing by hand and was off by 
36 degrees, burning out 2 valves. He was going through a divorce at the time 
and his mind was elsewhere.   tim s.
