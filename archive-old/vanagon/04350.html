Subject: Re: ATF for hyd. valves

Thanks for the info Stuart, we get Rislone up here, but I have never
looked at it. I've bought a litre of Dextron11 ATF for GM,Ford etc,
and if that doesn't work, I'll give the Rislone a try. Then I'll
probably end up tearing it down like you were going to. Mine has
sat for a month now, and that's when it started.
Regards,
Courtney
