&gt; &gt; With so many people expressing an interest in westy tents, is there an
&gt; &gt; aftermarket version that just isn't as good as the original ones??  How
about
&gt; &gt; making up a pattern from an old one and the making it yourself.  Is this
even
&gt; &gt; possible??
&gt;
&gt; Are we talking the ones up on the roof, or ones that somehow

I was talking about the one's that go to the sliding door side.
