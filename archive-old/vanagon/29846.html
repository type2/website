I wouldn't put too much weight on the Chrysler minivan
getting car of the year award.

These &quot;awards&quot; are driven more by manufacturer/magazine politics
than actual quantitative measurement.

The only thing more phony than the Car/Truck of the year
awards are the JD Power awards who have a category for
everything under the sun. (e.g. JD Power award winner for
the fewest defects on the first Monday of the month for cars
made above the equator and painted blue.)

Besides, VWs have one quality that a Chrysler minivan will never have,
namely character.
