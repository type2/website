&gt;Perhaps I'm thinkin' of somthing vastly different than what you're calling a spoiler... 
&gt;But does your vanagon really have good enough aerodynamics and go fast enough to cause 
&gt;lift?

Well, its really not a spoiler, its an airdam.

Here is one of the advantages of a wasserboxer: once you start going over about 90mph, 
the airdam  creates a low pressure area under the van, using suction to hold you onto 
the road. Of course, once you get to the bottom of the hill...:-).

Actually, it is a spoiler- it spoils your ground clearance. 
I took mine off - three minute project.
