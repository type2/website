Subject: RE: '83 Vanagon woes -- hot start problem


&gt;Any ideas what might prevent an '83 Vanagon (fuel injected, water cooled)
&gt;from wanting to restart after running for a short period of time??  It has
&gt;no problem starting on cold mornings, but after a quick ride, and 
shut-down,
&gt;it won't start up again.  It cranks, but does not connect.  So far we know
&gt;that all four plugs are sparking, the fuel pump is pumping,  the fuel 
filter
&gt;has been changed.  Occassionally it will struggle and kick in after a few
&gt;tries and lots of pressure on the gas pedal.  Usually, it just needs to sit
&gt;for e few hours and then it will go again.  Our local mechanics are 
stumped.
&gt;Any ideas??

My '84 also had a hot start problem.  The mechanic who fixed the problem
replaced the following items:

1. Air breather hose
2. oxygen sensor
3. fuel injector seals

He seemed to think that the leaking air breather hose caused most
of the hot starting problem.

Good luck.

Dave
