Subject: 67 Westy All for Parts

Hi All,

A guy in western Missouri who is in our local club called tonight needing
to sell a 67 Westy pop-top asap.  It's pretty rusty and has the engine and
other items removed.  It still rolls though and most camper stuff and
glass is intact.  He is not giving it away, but would like to get the
value of the tranny out of it so it should be pretty cheap.

Give him a call if you're interested. Note:  *All for Parts*, he's not
parting it out:  Rob (816)747-2288
