Subject: Re: inverted clay pot Q

&gt;OK, but a byproduct of the combustion in burning propane (among other
&gt;fuels) is water.   When I used my pot for heating, I could see
&gt;the moisture build up from it and on it.  That's when I began to
&gt;worry about it seeping into the unglazed surface, getting inside
&gt;the &quot;pores&quot; of the clay, expanding with the heat, and causing
&gt;an explosion.  If there is a tiny chance of this, wouldn't the iron pot be
&gt;safer?

I wouldn't worry about the moisture from the propane... the heat of the pot
should keep moisture from being a problem.

Iron would work nicely for a very short period of time.  Iron gives up its
heat quickly.  What you really want is a large mass of clay, like a pot with
2-3&quot; thick walls.  This isn't really very practical for anything, however.
How about water?  A 5-gallon black rubber solar shower stored on your roof
rack through a sunny day would make a heck of a hot water bottle for your
bed.  Wrap it up in blankets and its better than any man.
