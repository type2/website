&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt;      So many people answered my query about Calif. emmisions, Thank
&gt; you.  Now I have one more about Idaho.  Does Coer d'lene, Idaho, have
&gt; emissions testing?  I know Spokane has very stringent testing, and I was
&gt; wondering if Idaho is considered part of the same airshed, and if so, do
&gt; they have to test also?
&gt; 
&gt;      By way of explanation for these questions:  We are working with a
&gt; local legislator who has offered to introduce legislation for Washington
&gt; that would release some of the older cars ('68 - '75) from testing, but
&gt; he wanted to know what other west-coast and neighboring states are doing
&gt; first.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt;      Thanks.
