Please reply to me gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu and not to the list.
This thread has been repeated before, and several people have reiterated
it here.  I want to attempt to quantify this.

Please send a message to gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu if you own a Brick and
find that after a short drive (15-20 minutes) the engine turns over
slowly when restarting.  This is not related to how well it starts, just
how fast it turns over. (Mine is scary)

Indicate one of the following:
YES - My motor goes slow when I try to restart
NO  - My motor turns over just as fast as it did the first time
DON'T KNOW - My spouse starts my van because I'm afraid of it. 
            (or it starts itself,
             or I just leave it running)
