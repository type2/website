Subject: Thanks for info on CV joints

     
     Just want to thank everyone for all of the excellent info on R&amp;R'g the CV 
     joints on the '85 Westphalia(not that being a Westy makes a bit of 
     difference in this case).
     
     Went down to the local dealership to check on some boots and bolts just in 
     case I needed some and learned that they now carry only kits, containing a 
     boot, six bolts, grease, and probably circlips, etc. (didn't check the 
     whole list) at a price of $34.something.  
     Decided to pass on that price(which is 20% over cost or so I'm told) and 
     will check with the flaps in the area.
     
     Also got two new &quot;Westphalia&quot; decals for the roof; these were custom made 
     and not from the dealer.  Signmaker scanned a dealer-supplied decal into 
     his computer and cut new ones on his equipment....perfect at 1/2 the price.
     
     Later,
     
     Pat Spragge
