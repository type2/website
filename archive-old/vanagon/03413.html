Subject: Re: Walkthroughs

According to Anthony, they didn't start making
walkthroughs till approximately 1963, so that
there were only about 5 years of splits (63-67)
that could have been a walkthrough.

Of our 1300 in our database, about 30% of them
are walkthroughs.

He has heard some double-double-door panels being
called walkthroughs, but technically walkthrough
is supposed to mean going from the front compartment
to the back compartment.

Almost all (maybe 99%) of the bubble buses are
walkthroughs. (They stuck with that good idea!) 

Lee - your Devon Caravette info is now in the hands of
the US postal service - hope you receive it soon!
