Subject: 69 Rust Bug bites the dust


Today at lunch I used my 59 single cab to tow my 69 Rust Bug
to it's final resting place at a local vw junkyard.  It had to
die so that others might live.

It looked sad, sitting there only 4 vehicles away from the 61
single cab I parted out this spring.

I bought it for $50 two years ago and have been using it as a 
constant loaner to friends without transportation.  No longer
having yard space for it (and tired of paying insurance since
I never drive it) I pulled the engine last week.

After I get back from BBTA the engine will go into the 66
non-poptop Westfalia.

The bug is dead.  Long live the Westfalia.

Dave
