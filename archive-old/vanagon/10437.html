VV&gt;Since Joel has been posting old road test, which are actually quite
VV&gt;interesting, I want to know why my Vanagon doesn't get 19 MPG in city
VV&gt;driving!  And what can I do to make it get 19 MPG in city driving 
VV&gt;(that's more like my Highway mileage!).

 My 84 has been known to get 26 on the highway in the mountains of upstate
NY. This was before a replacement of an engine with a warped head with a
rebuild I expect better or equal when it returns to the road.
