Hal,

I'd stay away from aftermarket exhausts.....especially from Sears, Midas, 
Meineke, etc. These folks do not have the proper muffler (size, shape, 
backpressure, etc) for your EV. They use so called &quot;universal&quot; mufflers that 
are the approximate size for your car, and a couple of different 
makes/models, etc. I admit they are good when it comes to making the pipes 
up for a certain application. However, their pipes/mufflers are then 
assembled using universal hangers as opposed to the rubber donuts that hold 
the VW exhaust system to the car.

I had a friend who went to Midas to get his GTI done...it was all crap! The 
mufflers were slightly different (for example the rear muffler has a &quot;dent&quot; 
in it to clear the shock absorber...the midas one didnt)..the system was put 
together using those cheap exhaust hangers you can get at any parts places - 
the ones with the long strip of perforated stees...a piece of cut up tire 
and then a u-bolt clamp...it vibrated, it sounded crappy...and probably 
because of the difference in backpressure, the GTI ran like crap.
