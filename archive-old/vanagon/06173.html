Subject: Re: Stainless Steel exhaust

1. Your exhaust already *is* stainless steel.

2. If you buy a new exhaust at VW it coems with a lifetime free replacement
policy, so you only have to do it once.

3. You probably don't have to replace your exhaust pipes. Just have them
welded. They are thick enough.
