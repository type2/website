My SO (before I met her of course!) told me a story about her 75 Beetle,
she took it to a oil lube place they changed the oil and lubed it just
fine, but the idiot forgot to put the drain plug back in, AND never
re-checked the oil after filling. She only made it about a mile before,...
well you guys all know the rest. I never, never, never let anyone else put
fluids in my vehicles. (Well, maybe gas, as long as I can watch ;) ) Have
to really watch these guys but remember, it's not HIS vehicle that he's
working on, and who knows? He might have just smoked his lunch, or maybe
their already brain-dead, and who knows what's REALLY in that drum of stuff
they call oil???
