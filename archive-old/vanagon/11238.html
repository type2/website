Subject: Tinting Completed

To follow-up:

I had all the windows tinted (except windshield).  Cost was
$250.00; $50 discount due to winter slow season).  It took
the guy six hours and he ended up removing the window beside/
behind the closet.  The tint is by Lumar - aluminum based 65%
grey.  Great job and thinking about the labor, removing the
window, number of windows, and his knowledge/skill, worth the
price.

Some knowledge I acquired during my estimate search:
- Lumar tinting is supposed to be the best for vehicles.  Two of
the shops only used Lumar.  The place I  had it done at used both
Lumar and 3M but they use Lumar for vehicles and 3M for homes/
business'
- There is aluminum and titanium based tint.  The metal base is for
resisting turning purple over time.  But the titanium will have a
noticable 'chrome or metal' look over time.
- As I mentioned I picked the 65% grey.  This was the medium they
were offering.  This came out a little darker than I was hoping
for but not bad.  A 55% or even a 60% would have been more about
perfect.  The light tint was I think 45% and this would have
been too light.
- For the FAQ (as someone suggested) Calif. does NOT allow any tinting
on the driver and passenger side windows.  The place I went will remove
the tint for free if I'm stopped and issued a 'fix-it' ticket.  And
further, they'll reinstall it for $25 once the fix-it ticket is taken
care of.  Only in America!
