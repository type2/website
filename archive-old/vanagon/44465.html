&gt;Thanks everyone for the information on the blinker relay, i opened the bulb
&gt;housing and cleaned connections and everything is back to normal.  That is,
&gt;like it was before, the remaining problem is my rear parking light is always
&gt;off but if i walk back there and give the thing a smack, it will turn on.
&gt;It is a bad connection, i tried using steel wool, baking soda, and silicon
&gt;spray (advice from someone) but it is still agonizing my life.  Any tricks
&gt;to fixing this??  Thanks again.

If there were no loose wires I would add a ground. 
Me, if it is a vw &amp; it has an electrical problem I add a ground.
Aloha.
