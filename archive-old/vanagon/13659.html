&gt; 
&gt; Maybe someone out there has some advice.....
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '71 bus (with vacuum assisted brakes).  The bus idles fine, but when
&gt; I apply the brakes the idle becomes very rough and sometimes stalls.  This
This happened on my '71 when the master cylinder leaked through
the front and the brake fluid ate through the diaphragm on the
booster. Sounds like you need a new booster....sorry.
