Subject: '87 Syncro GL For Sale

Hi everyone,

We have decided to sell our low mileage '87 Syncro GL and buy
an '88 or newer Westy.  It wasn't an easy decision and I would
have liked to have kept the Syncro but we're not into taking out loans
on vehicles.  So if you are interested or know of someone who
is please e-mail me.  We're located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.

To those of you who get the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, there
will be an add listing an 800 number (Minnesota only) starting in
Saturdays' paper.

'87 Vanagon Syncro GL, 44,000 miles, Wolfram Grey Metalic,
A/C, new tires, no Minnesota winters.
