Subject: VW quote of the day...


Howdy Volks,

	I'm pretty much just a lurker here, but I (and my daughter Emily)
have been helping ex-wannabuser Mark Janello put his '62 Kombi back 
together.  Yesterday as Mark discovered another little bit of rust in
a nook (or was it a cranny?) he said [now, you gotta add lots of feeling
to this], &quot;Man I hate rust.  I just hate it.&quot;  Guess you had to be there...

	Anyway, at the risk of stealing Mark's thunder, the driver's door
is on, driver's windshield is in, and the driver's side headlight &amp; the
front bumper are in place.  Woo-hooo!  Oh, and Betsy gave him some cooool
custom-made &quot;'62 Kombi&quot; t-shirts for his birthday yesterday. 

	Oh! and my little Emily screwed on the steering wheel nut.  Not
bad for a 10-month-old (sez papa, beamin' w/ pride:) .

-Greg

'63 Beetle
