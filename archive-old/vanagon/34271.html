&gt; My knowledge is nowhere near Hoover's, but I believe these engines
&gt; were the Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp. Turbocharged, 2800 cubic inches (!),
&gt; 2,000 horsepower each, driving a propellor at a whopping 900 rpm at cruise,
&gt; through a reduction gear assembly at the front.
&gt;
&gt; The engines were impressive, but trouble-prone. The B-29 was known
&gt; by pilots and aircrews as &quot;an aborting son of a b*tch&quot;, since every time
&gt; a thousand of them took off from Tinian Island in the Pacific to bomb Japan
&gt; in WWII, more than a hundred would have to turn back with engine trouble.
&gt;
&gt; Is this the engine that was used on many American fighters, such as the
&gt; Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Grumman F6F
&gt; Hellcat, and Grumman F7F Tigercat (which had two!)? Any others?

It's been a while since I saw it, but the Spruce Goose has eight
28-cylinder radial engines in it.  The inboard four engines have two
counter-rotating props on them.  I'm not sure whether the horses of these
engines is as much as in the B-29, but they were impressive to stand under
and look up at!  By the way, radial engines have to be built in odd-numbers
of cylinders, or groups thereof, so as to facilitate the reciprocating
motion.  The Spruce Goose's engines were in four banks of seven cylinders.
Imagine a valve job on one of them!!
