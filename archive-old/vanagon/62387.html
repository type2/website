&gt;Has anyone ever tried to design a condenser air chimney that extends

&gt;It seems to me that VW sold vehicles with motor radiator fans that came
&gt;on too late and refrigerator fans that came on too early.  We owners are
&gt;left with the task of correcting their kit's design.

No, but I sure have thought about it. One thing you could do is put an
external, louvered access hatch on the outside of the van at about the
refridg location. Aesthetically not so pleasing though
