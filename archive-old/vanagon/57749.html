&gt; &gt;     Hey Jim,
&gt; &gt;        Sorry to differ, but there is a Eurovan Westy at the dealer
&gt; &gt;        here is PGH PA. for sale, $35,000. I looked at it.
&gt; &gt;                                              ERic Zeno
&gt; 
&gt; Well if there is, it's a real oddity and VW didn't import it.  
&gt; I bet if you looked a little closer you'd find it was a &quot;Winnie&quot; by
Winnebago
&gt; rather than a &quot;Westy&quot; by Westfalia.


	Maybe a unit from Canada? I know VW exported Westies to Canada in '92 &amp;
'93 although not to the states.
I test drove them in Vancouver, BC.

	scr
