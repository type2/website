&gt; &gt;I just have to settle for my
&gt; &gt;little Schabak Vanagon model that sits on my monitor, and is even the same
&gt; &gt;color as my '87. Now I need a blue one to match my '85.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone make a Vanagon Camper model?  I'd really love one of these until
&gt; I find the real thing.
&gt; 
I have a Revell 1/25 Vanagon Camper that has a workable rear hatch and 
sliding door; can be built with top up or down.  Don't know the year.  
Also don't know they still make 'em.

On the Franklin Mint issue, I bought the yellow sedan, then, yeah, I 
bought the red convertible; then, yyyeeeaaahhhh, I was stupi...er, 
dedicated enough to buy the Micro, which is quite righteous, indeed.  
Since I have no working 1/1 VW, I have _lots_ of money left over to buy 
toys, and they take up much less space :-) Agreed, they aren't the real 
thing.

Does anyone know if Franklin still actually _makes_ any car models or are 
they all made by slave labor in PROC?
