Subject: Re: awnings, what I've learned

 &gt;  . They come in various sizes, generally from 7 - 12 
&gt;&gt;&gt;feet wide and pull out from the van 6 - 7 feet. Seems to me that the 10 
&gt;&gt;&gt;foot size is appropriate for a Vanagon Westfalia. The fabric is 13 oz. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;vinyl and comes in those accent colors that you see on RVs (blue, brown, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;burgendy, teal, etc.).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Anyone have any experience 
&gt;&gt;&gt;with the A&amp;E awnings?

&gt;        I have had experience with A&amp;E awnings on RVs. I think they are a
good product. They work well,wash up well,and wear well. Living up in your
neck of the woods too, I decided to get a awning for my 86 syncro Westy and
a 10' A&amp;E was my choice. I bought it 6 months ago and its still leaning
against the wall in the shop. When I started to investigate installation I
saw that the diagonal arm that holds the awning up when pulled out would
interfere with the front door(you can't open the door with the awning out).
It seems that all of the awnings that I see only go to the rear of the front
door. I have been very busy lately and haven't really studied this
instalation completely, so it might be possible to install a 10 footer but I
think it will be a problem. If you find out more please let me know. Those
of you with awnings out there, how long are they and how far forward do they
come?
