Subject:      Pop-up Roof &amp; Bumper

Would anybody have an idea if it is possible to paint or do some kind
of touch-up on a pop-up roof that has a long scratch on one side. Can
&quot;vinyl be painted ? I am aware that the scratch itself will remain...
I am just trying to find a way to make it less obvious, less visible.

Any idea on how much it would be for a new or used rear bumper on a
1991 ?
Thank you... A la prochaine
