&gt;I'm too lazy to quote from a digest right now, but I'm a little confused
&gt;about the definition of &quot;Kombi&quot;.

here we go again!! :)  so is everybody else (confused, that is). actually,
some folks KNOW what a kombi is, but can't prove it. ;)

&gt;I saw someone mentioned that a C/Kombi was a bus that had removeable
&gt;seats and could function as a passenger and cargo hauler.

about the only thing we've all agreed on is that:
(1) VW made buses called Kombi's.
(2) Kombi's are NOT Deluxe buses.
(3) Kombi's are NOT Pickup Trucks.
(4) Kombi's have windows.
(5) Kombi's were used as the basis for MOST Camper conversions, but are NOT
    the same as Campers.

&gt;I've been told/led to believe that it is a Kombi.  Am I right?

probably you are right, but someone made it into a camper. if you checked the
VIN of the bus, it would be a Kombi.  i would call it a &quot;Day-Camper&quot; myself,
