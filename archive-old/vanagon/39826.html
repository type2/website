Subject: is TDI EV avail. in USA?


Hello Volks......   

A post in the recent past had some specs about the TDI EV.  This past 
saturday i test drove a TDI Passat and was pretty impressed, especially by 
the mileage:  45mpg high way!!!

Does anybody know if the TDI EV's are available in the USA?

later,
