A quickie update:

The V6anagon is alive and well, thought still running rich and not smogged.

Installed the new shifter slider bearing and boot where the long shift
rod goes from the bottom of the shift lever backt to the tranny. The bolt
on the tranny that the rod slides onto, turned out to be slightly bent
as well as dry and caked with dirt. Called a VW dealer's service department,
who said it was supposed to be that way (bent), so I left it that way.

carved off all the crud, cleaned it up, installed the nylon slider bearing
(little round nylong ring), covered everything liberally with grease,
put the boot on, slid it onto the bolt, and torqued the bolt down. It
didn't want to go into third unless it got a hard push after that, so I
loosened the bolt and pivoted it around till the bend (only like 10
degrees off true) pointed down... matching the slight bend in the shift
rod, I finally noticed. Now it shifts fine! Still a fair amount of play,
though. For my next trick, the linkage to the tranny, and the shift lever
to shift rod coupling...

Pulled the upholstery panel off the sliding door, and immediately spotted
(duh) the adjuster mentioned by a kind list member. Sure enough, the stop
nut and jam nut, which should have been snugged up on either side of the
handle-opener linkage, weren't. They were there, but rattling around
loosely, and almost certainly getting farther out with every bump or
door slam. Snugged them up to the right position, and now the door
opens like a brand new one! All praise to vanagon_at_lenti!   :^)

BTW, I have a new Web Page, with one (count them, one) picture in it,
plus some text stuff. Finally got the picture working, and have a real
URL, which is:

     http://www.lookup_dot_com/homepages/76242/home.html

It's active now, but still pretty minimal. I hope to get some pictures
of the V6anagon and its transplanted heart, into the page-- as soon as
I take them, and get them scanned!
