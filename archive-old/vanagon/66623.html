Subject:      1995 Eurobago

The 1995 Eurobago which I owned was a phenomenal vehicle.  The 5cyl,
2500 cc Audi was perfectly matched in HP (107) and torque.  The only
draw back was the weight of the Winnebago conversion - total vehicle
weight 4700 lbs.  The rear bench while solid and reliable, but was
made out of cast iron, and the upholstery was decidedly saggy and
uncomfortable (the front swivel seat, by VW, were, by comparison,
superb).  The front of the vehicle was surrounded by glass, wonderful
vistas, while the rear bench passengers were relegated to a dark
corner.  The window over the galley hardly provided a view at all.

I don't fault Winnebago for the quality of their construction or
components.  The fridge, Norcol (sp?), was top notch - it would work
on gas at any angle and also on gas at highway speeds (no need ever to
run it off DC).  The suburban furnace was spot on.  All top notch.

What I fault Winnebago for is their failure to plan for light weight
construction.  It is almost unconscienable for them to put 3/4&quot;
plywood throughout.  The cabinets, everything, are made out of this
heavy duty stuff.  They could of, and should of, designed using
aluminum and plastics.

However, even Winnebago's weight problem doesn't detract from the
superb highway platform of Eurovan 5cyl.  With perfectly matched
suspension and braking, this vehicle was king of the road at 85 mph.
