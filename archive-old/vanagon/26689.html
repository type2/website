&gt;help, please...
&gt;
&gt;My driver seat armrest has collapsed.  It appears to have two threaded
&gt;bolts(?), &amp; the lower pivot one still works.  The upper one is loosely
&gt;attached to the armrest, but I can't remove either pin so I can replace/fix
&gt;the problem.  It must be a simple solution- 'guess I'm just dumb.

The armrest is attached to a bracket that's attached to the seat.  The
bracket is sort of a T shape with the stem of the T protruding into the
armrest.  Each side of the top part of the T has bolt through it that fastens
the bracket to the seatback.  The stem of the T is fastened to the armrest
with a large pin, about 1/4&quot; diameter.  To disassemble the unit you must push
back the upholstry until you can see this pin.  It's best viewed from the
front of the seat.  Get a rod of some sort (I use an old push-rod) that will
match the diameter of the pin. Drive the pin out of the hole (watch where it
falls on the floor) and then the armrest will simply slide off. 

&gt;From here you can clearly see the entire T bracket and the two bolts that
hold it to the seatback.  At this point you'll have to diagnose your own
problem but it's probably one of these two: A.) One of the bolts has come
completely out and thus allows the whole bracket and armrest to pivot on the
other bolt, or B.) The weld holding the stem of the T to the top of the T has
broken, thus allowing the top of the T bracket to stay in place while the
stem of the T simply spins with the armrest.

Whatever the problem, when you reassemble the unit I suggest that you use
some mild-acting Lock-Tite on the bolts that hold the bracket to the
seatback.  NOT the type that won't allow future disassembly, but the kind
that just helps the threads not to loosen accidentally.

G'luck!
