Subject: what is under the passengers feet? AGAIN

Sorry to take up the bandwidth by asking this question again, and my
apologies to anyone who answered it, but I've had some BIG problems with
my mail server and have missed out on anything anyone has sent me or to
the list in the last 14 hours.  If you replied, please send me your
response again.  If you didn't, and know the answer, please take a stab
at it...

The problem:  I bought a subwoofer and want to mount it under the glove
box on my 90 camper.  It fits, but in order to complete the installation
I need to run 4 screws thru the floorboard right under the glovebox,
about where a tall person's toes would be (feet spaced comfortably
apart), just hidden from your line of sight if you are sitting in the
passengers seat.  

The question:  Is there anything on the other side of the floor
board--like a radiator or hose or something--that I will cause damage to
if I shoot screws thru the floorboard?  or is there ample space on the
otherside of the floor and the headlight or whatever?

Thanks for the help, and again, sorry for dragging y'all thru this one
more time...

ian
