Subject:      Re: EV Panel Van and Value

I can only reaffirm Tim Parker's comments to Matt Dekker on the desirability
of an EV. We couldn't be happier with our MV. We got ours during the dog
days of '93 after Consumer Reports scuttled the Yuppie market with their
typically biased (against VW) treatment of the EV and VW dealers were prac-
tically GIVING them away. By playing two dealers off against each other we
got our EV for $100. above dealer cost and got the GE Extended Warranty
thrown in at dealer's cost ($435.) as well. For once we got lucky.

EV Panel Vans ARE sold in Canada at very low prices. I saw one at work in
Montreal last week. Also, last fall I found a VW Dealer in Edmonton Alberta
advertising on the NET. Their Transporter Panel Van, apparently available
with a 2.4 litre 5-cylinder diesel engine, lists for $20,995 Canadian. That's
about $15,785. US. Don't know what one would need to do in order to bring
it into the States.
