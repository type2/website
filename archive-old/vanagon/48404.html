Subject: Re: Eurovan MV???

&gt; Howdy all. As my folks are considering adding a Eurovan to replace their ailing
&gt; Chr*sler (They've seen the light!), they are looking at campers. However, they
&gt; really don't want all the fancy equipment. So, I was wondering if they make
&gt; Weekender Eurovans? I mean a van with a pop-top and foldout rear bed, but
&gt; without the propane stove, refrigerator, and such? Hopefully I will be going
&gt; with them to check some out in the next couple months. It should be fun, and I
&gt; love the expressions of the folks at the dealer when I drive up in my splittie.
&gt;  Anyway, thanks...

Two EV's might be near what you want.

EV MV = What I and I think Ric and several others have.
	Fold down rear seat bed.
	two rear facing &quot;jump&quot; seats for &quot;middle&quot; seat.
	pull up table w/ flourescent light above it.

EV MV Weekender = almost camper
	Added pop up roof (Westy not Winnie)
	One of the rear seats isn;t pull out and has a D/C powered cooler 
	under it.

You figure out which suits the bill since you described a combination.

Ric's beed describing taking his MV camping successfully.  We use a 
cooler plugged into the Cigarette lighter.  Bigger and probably better 
than the cooler seat version.  I can even seatbelt strap mine into one of 
the two jump seats.  The jump seats take seconds to pop in and out.  Rear 
seat takes moments to fold down.  More time removing the headrests than 
anything else.  No experience with the Winnie &quot;low-profile&quot; pop top.  
Much sleeker looking than the Bay window or Vanagon pop tops.

Course it will have to be a '93.  Typical price for a '93 MV seems to be 
14 or 15K.  I get as good a gas mileage with my EV as my silly brother 
gets with his Dodge.  About 19mpg.  I understand the standard 
transmission gets better - I wish I had it but the auto works well.
