Subject: Holidays!


I'm leaving for 3 weeks hols tommorrow morning. Margaret, myself, and the
two dogs are heading up to Nemiah valley and Chilko lake. Much of the trip
will be on gravel roads and far from vw resources, so please pray for
mechanical grace.

Gerry, if you are listening, could you change my subscription to digest?
sorry, but I've forgotten the command.

bye, Alistair
