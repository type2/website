Subject: Re: Another tire/ Bias ply


&gt;Bus.  In fact next winter if I drive the Bus much I might think about
&gt;them, the tread pattern would be hard to beat, oh and anybody out there

They heat up more than radials, use a bit more gas, and 'flat-spot' in cold 
weather. Over the long haul they _might_ cost more due to the mileage thing. 
I used to run retread bias plys (o-my-god-no!) on a '71 in the winters. 
Worked fine. They (Kellys) sound great for winter, get some spare rims and 
mount'em up, save wear on the real good tires, and on changeover costs. I 
noticed that the 8pr Yokos had a soft wall, not half as stiff as a set of 4 
ply Pirelli M+S Winter-190's I had on the '85.

&gt;with a 181? those Things got 14&quot; don't they, sure would be a good
&gt;tire for a Thing used off and on the road.

Guy I gave my '72 woodshed to has a Thing and many busses (aircooled). He 
says the Thing is useless in slippery stuff compared to the vans, too light 
for the tires to dig in and get traction (he was using snow tires in the 
mud). Strange, maybe too much power-to-weight ratio, comparitively speaking &lt;g&gt;.

&gt;
&gt;Anyway just some usual ramblings.
&gt;John
