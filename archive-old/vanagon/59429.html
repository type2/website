 I'm traveling to Europe next month, looking to buy a used Westie ($10,000, 
 sell it there when finished after 6 months or so) any tips on what's 
 available, what to avoid, insurance costs the petrol vs. diesel vs. propane 
 question? I need either an European or American who has done the same thing 
to 
 contact me. Thanks!
