Bob, this is turning into an epic novel. There's a book called The Blue
Volkswagen, about someone who travels across Canada doing running repairs to
his clapped out bus. Sound familiar? You haven't met any sexy female
hitchhikers who just happen to be ace mechanics, have you??  You'd have a
best seller on your hands :)
