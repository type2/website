&gt; 
&gt; Yes, why?? Is there a particular weakness and low survival rate with that
&gt; model year?

  Good question, Sami. There should be a lot of them around, at least in the
  international sense. The peak productions years of the type II were in the
  mid '70's. I like '75s, the Westfalia camper layout in '75 was unique to 
  that year and particularly practical in my opinion - lots of seats, lots of
  storage - I think that '74 and '75 were the only years of Westys that had
  seat belts _and_ beds for five (assuming one was short enough to sleep in 
  the cot over the front seats).
