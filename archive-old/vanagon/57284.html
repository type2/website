Lloyd -

You asked:

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know which alloy wheels by other manufacturers work on
&gt; vanagons.  I have seen pictures of vanagons with Audi rims: which ones
&gt; are these?  The vanagon alloys are difficult to obtain at a reasonable
&gt; price.  Many thanks

Go to the Tirerack and check out the Borbet Replica II wheels:

These &quot;Mercedes only&quot; wheels are supposed to be a direct match for the Westy.

Has told me that he has installed these wheels on a Vanagon and that they are
strong and look great. I am considering them for my '91 Westy. 

They take a &quot;low profile&quot; tire, 205/65 R15 which is supposed to result in an
overall gain of .2 inches in total wheel/tire diameter. This supposedly 
provides an accurate Odometer reading.

Kyle recommends a reinforced tire on these. I am having a little trouble 
getting the straight scoop on appropriate tires.

Michelin MXV Energy tires is what Tirerack recommended. These are a 94 H rated
tire. That's 1477 lbs/wheel at 130 mph. They are a max 44 psi rated tire.

This is a summation of what I have found over the past 2 weeks.
