Subject: Piston gone

Seasons greeting to all,
I still have a bit of a problem with my van ('73 kombi 1700), the blue smoke problem
of a week or so ago is fixed, somebody competent is working on the van now :), at
the same garage though... It was tappets and they fixed it at no more cost....
BUT. Compression on Cylinder on right at back (No 2?) was 0. So my engine is
now out and head off. The piston in question looks as though Christmas was a
good one. It is melted? curved closest to where the plug is. The plug also seems
to be longer than the one on the adjoining cylinder.
What is it that could cause the excessive heat that seems to have done this?
Is it now just a case of getting a new piston, rings etc or is there something
more deep and meaningful that needs doing...
Is there anything else I should look at whilst the engine is out.
I know, I know, lots of questions so near the new year, but any advice,
erroneous or otherwise will be lapped up.

Carl
