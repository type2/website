Subject: SW BC, PNW Meet Update!

Hello everyone!

Here's the latest on the status of the planned SW BC, PNW pizza and 
camping (later) trips.  Since I suggested this about a week ago, I've 
heard from 6 other folks indicating they'd be into getting together.  
The people I have are:

Harry Yates	hyates_at_bcit.bc_dot_ca
Jesus Dizon	amiga_at_halcyon_dot_com
Paul Uusitalo	puusital_at_adobe_dot_com
Jeff Rosen	jeffro_at_u.washington_dot_edu
Jon Saywell	Iceman_at_whidbey_dot_net
Eric Oster	ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu

I noticed from joel's stats for this week that we've picked up another 
person in BC (now 11), and 2 more in W WA (now 16).  So here's a personal 
invite to the three of you: welcome to the list, and we'd love to see you.
Anyone else I haven't heard from yet, here's your chance to drive yer bus 
to fun eats/sleeps.  Jesus may even drive up from Olympia for Pizza!!

Suggestions so far:
Pizza:  Harry suggested the Coach's Corner pizza joint in Burnaby, BC, 
located on Canada Way, one block E of Boundary.  Would the second weekend 
in May (say, Saturday the 13th) be good?  Other suggestions?

Camping: sometime June - Sept??  (Talk to me!)
Whistler/Pemberton area: Calligan Lake or Alexander falls?  (Have to wait 
a couple of months before we could get into these areas 'cause of high 
altitude/snowpack)

Harry suggested Manning Park, East of Hope.  Harry can find us a good 
spot to camp.  Again, probably want to wait a couple of months for many 
areas in the park.  Don't we have somebody in Kelowna?  Manning might be 
better for interior people (how about W of Lillooet for interior people?)

I suggested Deception Pass on Whidbey or someplace in that area.  I guess 
meeting stateside would be better for the WA people.  Deception Pass is 
very picturesque, but I have seen the campsites pretty crowded at times.  

Maybe it would be possible, wherever we decide to go, to meet on a 
non-long weekend so that we can avoid big crowds/bad traffic?  With 
enough lead time, perhaps we could all arrange to take a day off and make 
our own long weekend.

Christa and I are going to go exploring up Pemberton way in a few weeks, 
but I'm not sure other folks would want to join us getting stuck, taking 
chains on/off, getting exercise with the shovel, etc., etc. although I 
guess we could alway use having a syncro around to pull us out!!  (hint, 
hint!)

---&gt; So, pizza in Burnaby Sat May 13 for starters?

Oh, and anyone interesting in meeting in form or another, please tell me 
where abouts you live so we can plan events as centrally as possible.
That's all for now.  Happy trails!

Tobin
