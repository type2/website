&gt;Would it take anything other than plugging vacuume lines to switch an 
&gt;auto stick tranny for a true automatic?  I think the beetle in question 
&gt;is about a '70.  If not much hastle is involved in the swap, does anyone 
&gt;know if it is hard to replace the seals in an automatic tranny?

Biggest issue is if the Bug has the cluch cable tube.
