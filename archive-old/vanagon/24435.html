Subject: Re: The '71 single cab that isn't


Say, all you list dudes...

I would love to put that engine (and maybe trans?) in my '71 bus.

Presently, I have a 1970 single-port 1600 engine in it. Completely
stock 1970 parts except the 009 distributor, but I also have the original
(vacuum diaphragm) distributor too. I also have a set of dual baby Kadron
carburetors (used) in a box, with the correct manifolds for this single-port
engine (finding those was a bear!)

If one of you buys that '70 single cab, and the Corvair engine runs
fairly decently, how would you like to swap engines? And maybe
trannies-- if the ring needs to be swapped, maybe that would be
easiest? I'm pretty sure my tranny is stock 1971 bus, (with a leaking
seal)-- will it fit a '70 single cab? Will yours fit mine?

Email me direct for details... maybe we can make this work?

&gt;&gt;OK, so I got ahold of the guy and it turns out:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* It's a '70, not a '71.
&gt;&gt;* It's got a Corvair engine in it.
&gt;&gt;* &quot;Ran fine 2 years ago when I last ran it&quot;
&gt;&gt;* Body is said to be good.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Now how much would you pay?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;At this point, I'm thinking. This is actually the second week it's
&gt;&gt;been in the paper; he didn't think it would be selling soon. I'll
&gt;&gt;prolly take a look and then pass on it (and pass his # on), I dunno.
&gt;&gt;Apparently it's got the bus tranny, but with the ring gear flipped
&gt;to
&gt;&gt;make it go backwards for the corvair engine.  Any feedback on how
&gt;hard
&gt;&gt;that would be to undo?
&gt;&gt;
