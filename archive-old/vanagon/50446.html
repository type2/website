Subject: Re: Copy of: Front speaker replacement

&gt; Check the wires right at the hinges. Lots of times the wire breaks inside
&gt; the insulation, looks OK but don't connect.
Thanks - turns out one of the power mirror wires was also broken, 
which may save me taking apart the passenger mirror.... :)


&gt; &gt;I guess I'm just lucky - or are '88s different? My speakers came out 
&gt; &gt;fine, although the driver's side wiring is somehow dead...
