&gt; Wasn't '58 a one year only Westie? I know the '5? to '57 are pretty
&gt; much the same as are the '59 to '61.
&gt;
I'm not sure, a friend of mine has a decent mostly original 58 westie
though if curious about anything.  8-)

I talked to Todd Swangstu yesterday (editor of the Westie Newsletter)
and according to him, the '58 Camper box was a one year only vehicle.
Westfalia incorporated a couple of the features common on the later
split window campers - mainly the clothes closet in the rear passenger
side of the vehicle. In place of the clothes closet above the engine
compartment on the pre-58s, Westfalia put 2 small cabinets above the
engine compartment. The rest of the camping interior was pretty much
the same as the earlier camper boxes.

Lates,
Greg
