Subject: Need Reciever Hitch 82 Diesel Westy For Hitch Haul Basket

Volks,
I saw that someone on the list was fabbing up some nice reciever hitches
that connect to the frame for our Vanagons. I am in need of one
w/hopefully a 2&quot; reciever (1&amp;1/4&quot; will work). I will install a Hitch
Haul basket carrier on this unit for extra gear on the Diesel Westy.
Also, anyone done this?
