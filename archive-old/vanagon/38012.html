Subject: WTB 68-71 Crew Cab/List Com

Hi All,

First a comment on the list. In the few weeks that I've been getting digests,
I'm amazed at the willingness to help and the openness of the participating
members of this list. I subscribe to a few mailing lists, and I must say that
the spirit of community truly lives within this bunch. Kudos to all who
participate and keep the spirit alive. (I'm not saying this just to get free
beer) ;-)

Now on to the meat: I'm looking to buy a double cab, preferably a 68-71. Thom
Fitzpatrick has already been helpful in evaluating some JPEG images of a '65
splittie that I sent to him. Unfortunately, it just had too much rust and
aftermarket &quot;weld-ons&quot; to make it a reasonable purchase. I do want to restore
one, I just want to find the *right* one to restore. It doesn't need to be in
running condition, just have a straight body with minimal rust.

I'm willing to travel to pick this beast up, and I'm ready to trailer if need
be. Anything within a weekend's drive of the San Francisco Bay Area should be
considered fair game (I guess that means the entire Left Coast).

cheers and thanks to all,

Bren
