Subject: NEATO Folks, I Haven't Forgotten You! (long) (fwd)

Hi All,

After several months, I've finally found the time to assemble the 
'NEATO-ers on the net' mailing list.  Since it has become pretty obvious 
that I don't have the time to develop and maintain this effort, I 
would like to ask for a volunteer to take over this worthwhile endeavor.  
My other VW-volunteer activities are directed towards the Vintage VW Club 
of America (see my signature file at the bottom of this message).  

Several of you have expressed interest in taking over this NEATO mailing 
list (Tom B. is busy with other things), so by volunteering all I ask is 
that you write and submit to Tom B. (email is fine) an article about the 
net and its offerings for the OBR Newsletter.  Tom indicated that he 
would like an article about this subject for the OBR:

&quot;I'd be most happy to put something about e-mail and VWs in the OBR, 
but I'm not the best person to do (since I don't know how to deal with 
'FAQ' or anything else beyond sending and receiving mail. Maybe you could 
write something up? E-mail it to me, and I can transfer it to the 
newsletter easily.&quot;  --Tom Brouillette


Who are the 15 of us NEATO members?  Here's a roster with real names:
