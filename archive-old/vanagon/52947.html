Subject: Power Balance Test ?


What is a &quot;Power Balance Test&quot; ? How is it performed ? What does it tell
you ?

I recently took my aircooled Vanagon into a new shop to get my air flow
sensor adjusted. The process of adjustment involved gas analysis and they
found something they didn't like ... high Hydrocarbons (pre-cat
converter), so they performed a &quot;power balance test&quot;. I missed the gist of
what the tech was explaining, but did catch something about the &quot;lack&quot; of 
power. 

Power Balance results were:

#1 cylinder: 73
 2         : 62
 3         : 16
 4         :  5

I do know that the head seals on the #1 &amp; 2 cylinders are leaking, which
the tech mentioned. But he also mentioned that there was a &quot;big&quot; problem
with the #3 &amp; 4 side of the engine.

Any clues ?

Thanks, Chris
