Subject: furthur

So I went furthur this weekend, two shows, in Charlotte and Raleigh.  For
those who don't know, the Furthur festival is this year's equivalent to a
Grateful Dead happening, with Hot Tuna (electric), Los Lobos, Bruce
Hornsby, Mystery Box (Mickey Hart's band), Ratdog (Bobby's band, w Rob
Wasserman).  Besides Jorma looking not as good as we might like, an
excellent time was had by all.

And as you might expect at any Dead-related happening, the objects of our
love made up a significant proportion of the vehicles in the parking lot.
Sitting on top of Maggie and looking out it was like a sea of pop-tops!

While dead-heads might be notorious for battered VWs, there were
nevertheless some real winners there; some really nice westys and a normal
busses, and some with really creative paint jobs.

There was a decided lack of splits, however.  I saw maybe 5 total in two
shows (which is more than I see just driving around town in any two
days...), one of which was the feature cover a movie called &quot;Tie-Dyed&quot;
which you may hae seen in FLvideoS; not a bad bus.  Saw one sunroof 65.
Lots of vanagons, only one EV (most deadheads too poor :)).

So, there you have it.

Going Furthur,
Eric and Maggie
