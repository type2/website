Subject: VW get together _at_ Lime Rock

I spoke with John Kelly, the organizer for this weekend's get together
at Lime Rock CT.

As Ric reported in his post back on June 27:

&quot;Saturday there is Formula Vee Racing and VWs will be driving the
track during the lunch break

Saturday nite is a campout co-sponsored by LiMBO (so there
should be lots of vans there)

Sunday is the All VW Car Show and Swap Meet.&quot;

The VW parade will be lead by a pace car. (don't want those transporters
spinning out :-).  He said last year they maxed out around 50 MPH.

If you want to &quot;run what you brung&quot;, make sure to be there by 11:30.

Costs: $12.00/person to get into to Lime Rock to see the races, 
$5.00/person to camp, and the swap meet is $2.00/person or $6.00
for the vehicle to enter the paddock area. Camping will be in the 
infield of the track. Reservations are not required.

I'm planning on attending, any other list members attending?
BTW, John is expecting well over 100 VW transporters.
