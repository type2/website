Subject: Pertronix Ignitor

I installed one these point-less ignition conversion kits into my 009 
distribitor.  I installed the Ignitor by Pertronix.  Anyway when I measure 
the dwell it comes up 54' while it suppose to be 47' +/- 3'.  

Anybody have any experience with these?  It seems to work fine otherwise.

Matt
