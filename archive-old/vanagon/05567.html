&gt; 
&gt; uhmm, do you have a standard engine, or do you have a P-car flat six back
&gt; there?...

&gt; it seems unlikely that an AWD Vanagon w/o engine mods would be able to pull
&gt; away from a &quot;fast car&quot; on a ramp, ground condition notwithstanding, unless
&gt; the other driver wasn't interested in playing, or was a weenie driver...
&gt; 
&gt; now, if you had purchased your Syncro Vanagon with the James Bond oil 
&gt; spewing option, then, my hat's off to you!  :)

living in milmaukee, almost all of the people in fast cars can only go 
fast in a straight line, and totally panic at the slightest hint of a 
turn, especially in the wet.  I have however encountered a very wel 
driven carrera 4 that was going about 70 into a clover and exited at a 
much greater speed.  he left foot braked al the way through and just 
drove away from me!  turns out he s a formula ford driver.  Alas, being 
(only) an improved touring driver i could not catch him
