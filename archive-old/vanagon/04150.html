Subject: politically correct and you children's silly songs

I don't know about 'bout 'politically correct', but the song of the
hour must be a mid-afternoon lullaby...  I have not received mail in the
last hour -- what's going on???


Quick, Somebody rush some coffee to Ric, and somebody make a remark on
Southern States... The net is beginning to get boring :-(  (yawn....)...
