Heck, that's interesting, all right!  On the other hand, 115mph in an EV
has got to be on the order of about a billion rpm!  (Don't want to get
quantitative tonight.  Even though I AM a &quot;rocket scientist&quot; for NASA, I've
sucked down a few barley sodas and can't think that straight right now...).

But that's got to be within a few orders of magnitude, at any rate.  Too
fast for my EV, at least.

regards, where's the beer?...
