Subject: RE: Aircooled Redline?


&gt;I'm curious what the (approximate) redline is on a stock upright
&gt;engine.
&gt;
&gt;I've got the 1776cc w/Engle 110, but have never had a tachometer
&gt;hooked to it.
&gt;
&gt;What does VW say?


I've heard 4400 RPM from several sources, including a VW dealer.

The critical part is supposedly the bearing journals in the case. The
crank hammers them pretty bad at or above that. Then the oil pressure
goes, then the bearings go, then... take cover.

I wonder if a balanced crank would make the engine able to
rev higher than that? If not, what else would if need? Ignorant
minds want to know-- mine in this case.
