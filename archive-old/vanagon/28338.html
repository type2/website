&gt; &gt; &gt; Well Jim,
&gt; &gt; &gt; You may not be a pinhead about determing the worth of your auto parts, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; but your stance on the scantily clad women in magizines and ads leads me 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to believe differently about how you determine the worth of other human 
&gt; &gt; &gt; beings.  If you MUST partake in the degradation of women, buy magazines 
&gt; &gt; &gt; devoted to that, but there is no reason why a VW (or any other car) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; magizine HAS to have anybody objectified.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't want to go on a rant about this, but how we act as VW owners, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and whatever else we all are, has a tremendous bearing on many other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; people. It seems that you have the advantages that allow you to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;politically incorrect and proud of it&quot; but the majority of people 
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't.  Try being considerate of other people, it really doesn't hurt... 
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dave
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well Dave...for not wanting to go on a rant, you seem to have done a 
&gt; &gt; mighty fine job. I commend you!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let's see, where do I start. I'm not sure how buying a VW mag and pausing 
&gt; &gt; to look at the bikini babes is degrading to women. These women get paid 
&gt; &gt; big bucks to pose in these mags. No one forces them. Why do they do this? 
&gt; &gt; The magazines ask them to. Why is that, you may ask? It sells magazines. 
&gt; &gt; Period. If it didn't, they wouldn't waste their money on it. I like to 
&gt; &gt; think I'm a pretty responsible VW driver. I rarely speed. (Like my bus 
&gt; &gt; could go over the speed limit) I always obey traffic signs. Whenever I 
&gt; &gt; see another VW owner broken down at the side of the road, I stop to help 
&gt; &gt; them. If they happen to be women, I don't start drooling. I'm very 
&gt; &gt; polite. I'm the same way with males. I don't think I'm a detriment to 
&gt; &gt; society simply because I happen to like to look at the female form. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You're blowing this whole thing out of proportion. Get a life Dave.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; well again jim,
&gt; You just don't get it do you?  Just because some women find that some men 
&gt; will spend money to look at them doesn't mean that the results justify 
&gt; the actions.  And as it appears that you have a hard time reading for 
&gt; content, I'll spell it out for you again...the problem is that this kind 
&gt; of crap promotes the &quot;me tarzan, you jane&quot; mentality that you display so 
&gt; well.  women are constantly bombarded with messages which tell them that 
&gt; their worth is measured by how &quot;attractive&quot; they are... only someone who 
&gt; is pretty insecure about themself would revel in the inherent power this 
&gt; society bestows upon undeserving heterosexual white males (like 
&gt; yourself?) like you do.  You say that nobody forces the small number of 
&gt; women who do this into it... the simple fact is that that proves my 
&gt; point, they have &quot;learned what their &quot;value&quot; is, and the majority of 
&gt; women who are judged by the &quot;silicon queen&quot; have NO say in it. 
&gt; 
&gt; You seem to only be able to look at the world trough very egocentric 
&gt; eyes, so there are a few more things I would like to point out. you keep 
&gt; pointing out how responsible you are.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. you rarely speed -- but apparently you will when it suits your purpose.
&gt; 2. you help other VWs when they are broken down -- why not people in 
&gt; other makes?  aren't they just as worthy of help?
&gt; 3. you don't drool when you stop -- no, apparently you do your drooling 
&gt; at home with a VW mag.
&gt; 
&gt; it seems you fancy yourself quite the gentleman but only when it is easy 
&gt; for you... not if it means truly giving of yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, your opinion that i am blowing this out of proportion holds 
&gt; little sway with me, While as a Hetero-white-male I could quietly (or 
&gt; loudly - like you) just take the inherent advantages given to me by this 
&gt; society, I have taken a look around me to see what the situation is like 
&gt; for other people and decided that to better it for them, I will confront 
&gt; this sexist, racist, homophobic crap when I can.  Thanks for your advice, 
&gt; but I've already got a life and working to stop this stuff is a part of it.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't expect you will ever &quot;get it&quot; because I have found that it IS 
&gt; hard to teach an old dog new tricks...and if you continue to be a bully 
&gt; about this I will simply apply my efforts someplace where i think they 
&gt; will make a difference.  if you feel you can politely respond, and care 
&gt; to continue this discussion I will be happy to 
&gt; 
&gt; dave 
&gt; 
Sheesh Dave. It was just a joke. I thought the group needed a little 
shaking up. Now you're starting to threaten me. It's not worth it. You 
are right. I am wrong. Feel better? Jim Kirk
