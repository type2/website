I would sure be interested in any specifics on this modification (I have a
'91 Westy)?  What kind of relay, where to locate, wire gauges, connectors
styles and types that have been used successfully would all be helpful to
a mechanically/electrically challenged Vanagon owner like me.

&gt;
&gt; This will burn out the connector at the bulb and your ignition switch.
&gt; You have to overcome these two problems ( w. relay, better connectors)
&gt; before running these bulbs.

&gt; &gt;&gt; i just substituted 60/100 bulbs for the stock 55/60's
&gt; &gt;&gt; on the low beam side of my 91 synchro....i doubt that
&gt; &gt;&gt; the headlight switch will last forever...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone else tried this?  Did the switch(es) survive?
&gt; &gt;100/55 bulbs are easy to obtain in the UK.  Do I *need* to fit
&gt; &gt;a relay or will the switch(es) take the extra current?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The current through the switch is presently 10A (2 * 60/12), it
&gt; &gt;will increase to 17A (2 * 100/12).
