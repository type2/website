Hello Kerry,
  The removal of the axle nut and spacer is not hard, comparied to the
stories I have heard about rear axle nuts of the breadloaves.  A small
breaker bar 18&quot; is what I used with the 30mm socket.  I used a wooden block
and a hammer to remove the stub axle and CV joint.  Bentely calls for lock
tight on the splines, so it might be hard to get it going.  Mine took a
couple of hits and I was almost able to push it out of the hub.
     The rotor comes off the hub quite easily after you destroy the bolt
that holds it together. ;-)  I'm still looking for the bolt.  FLAPS I have
checked only have a few meteric bolts.  I have tried hard ware stores and
farm implement stores to no avail.  Any one have additional sources?
