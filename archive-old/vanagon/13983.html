Subject: RE: My Tank Runnith Over

Yes, Rich, I gave my gas tank a gas bath too.  Likely possibility is that
one of the vent tubes has popped out.  You can get it back in -- in fact
you can replace its grommet before you pop the vent tube back in -- by 
reaching in past the front tire on the affected side.  What you can't do
is see what you're doing while you do it, so you'll literally have to
feel your way to a solution.

Worst case possibility is that a fuel tank leak has broken through, in
which case your tank needs to be emptied, dropped, and taken to a radiator
shop for repair.

Gas tank has a hill on each side and a valley in the middle.  Passenger side
hill has two vent tubes, driver side one.  Valley is where air cooled Vgons
grow rust, as the heater duct rests on the tank trapping wet warm dirt
between duct and tank.

Good Samaritan whose name I can't recall posted an excellent gas tank R&amp;R
procedure for the list a few months ago.  Hope you don't need it.

B.
