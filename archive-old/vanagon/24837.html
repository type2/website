hey now,

mice? wow...i've got a wasp's nest...or at least an old wasp's nest in my
rear right air intake....big one too. just noticed it yesterday. guess they
came there when the van sat for over a year. i'm assuming they are gone since
i haven't been stung to death while working/driving the van. hehehehe

take care,

jonathan
