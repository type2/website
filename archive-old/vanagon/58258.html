Subject: Re. Coming Bus Events &amp; LiMBO

In case anyone is interested, I have the privilege of organizing the &quot;Coming Events&quot; list for 
LiMBO's (Late Model Bus Owners) web page and newsletter, the Transporter.

If you have any information on events that might be of interest to the owners of 1968 and 
newer Type 2's, Vanagons, EV's, Westies, ..., etc., please forward it to me.  I'll see that 
it is listed accordingly.

Thanks.
