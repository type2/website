Subject: RE: '84 transmission - are they just crap?


&gt;BUT, he did tell me about this new thing they were working on, it is a
&gt;conversion kit so you can use '80-'82 vintage transmissions in an '84 
van...
&gt;
&gt;he said that the former transmissions will last forever!!!
&gt;he said that the later transmissions are &quot;CRAP&quot; (they don't typically last
&gt;more than 100,000km)
&gt;
&gt;this i Could believe, now that i've tried to find an '84; if demand is so
&gt;high, they must live a very short life.
&gt;
&gt;i thought NEW was BETTER!!!


I don't have experience with wasserboxer trannies, but the V6anagon has
its original '80 Vanagon transmission, which has handled the extra torque
of the Chevy V6 engine just fine-- zero problems. I've put about 6,000
miles on it since I've had it, and the PO put 20,000 after he installed
the Chevy engine.

(It's also eaten two clutches in that time, but I think that's a different
story).

You might also ask Bill Kennedy in New Jehsey about this-- he's put a
series of 6-cyl Porsche engines in his Vanagon, which I think is either
an '80 or '81, with the standard 4-speed trans his car came with.

This vintage Vanagon tranny seems pretty bulletproof to me (knock on wood).
