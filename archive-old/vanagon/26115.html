Subject: RE: crazy? heat idea


&gt;How about using a propane heater used for camping in your bus?

I tried one of these many years ago in a Datsun wagon in
Minnesota. Tremendous heat (well, small interior too).
But I almost instantly started getting headaches and blurred
vision.

Shut that puppy down in a hurry and tossed it. Maybe it was
misadjusted, maybe newer ones are better. YMMV. I'd say
try it, but be CAREFUL.

My $0.02.
