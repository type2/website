On Thu, 27 Oct 94 11:11:40 CDT Somebody Somewhere said:
&gt;I know Joel changes his transmission oil every two years. But he is also
&gt;a model vanagon driver. ;)

oh, no. i drive a REAL vanagon. i only PLAY with the model ones ... pushing
them around on the floor and making noises (&quot;udden-udden-vooom-vooom&quot;). :)

Then, on the same day, Someone Else said:
&gt;I've got Uncle Joel beat.  I change the fluid in my 911 and my bus
&gt;(when running) about every 6 months.

any particular reason? i've wondered about changing the transmission fluid
every year, but decided that with so many cars still running around that have
NEVER changed their tranny oil, it would be ok to continue at every two years.
i'm almost paranoid enough to change brake fluid and coolant at one year
(instead of two) ... almost. not quite. :)
