&gt;Subject: Re[2]: Which is the outside lane?

&gt;     I thought the question was:&quot;Which is the outside lane?&quot;, not, which is the
&gt;     fast/slow lane.

Pat, Pat, Pat...in VW bus terms the outside lane IS the fast
lane, because there is only an outside chance you will ever
drive there in a VW bus!
