Subject: propane fill valve

well, my 85 westy has a leaking fill valve ... the autoshut off 
type.  after going to several propane dealers, r/v shops and
hardware stores ... lots of headshaking .. and try over at ...

the results still no valve .. called local vw dealer .. who
call vw.. and he can order one foor me 309$ !  argh!
all I think it must need is a diaphram.   put whem you
say propane .. its like your bus has leprosy.

what's a lad to do.  what is the net wisdom on dealing with
leaky fill valves,  modification, replacement, kits?

not cooking with gas in Mississippi,

hillary
