Subject: Loctite #599 No Longer Avail.

In a message dated 96-09-29 23:38:37 EDT, you write:

&gt;
&gt;   Bob I read your Sermon on Sealants. You mention Loctite#599 (The gray
&gt;stuff).        I have tried both the FLAPS and industrial suppliers here in
&gt;Dubuque Iowa. I cannot    find anyone who has Loctite#599. Could this be a
&gt;bad number?

Russell,

Since I posted the article on sealants Loctite has discontinued the #599
brand name.  However, their gray medium temperature RTV-type sealant is
available under a different number or name, I'm not sure which.  This
information is second hand, provided by another reader who tried to buy #599.
 I've still got a couple of tubes of #599 on the shelf.  When they're used up
I'll have to track down something else.  If you find a suitable replacement
please post specifics to the list.
