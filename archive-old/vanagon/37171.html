Subject: Temperature Affects Engine performance?

hey now,

i've noticed this winter that when the temp is below say 25 F, my van runs
shitty, taking forever to warm up and stalling until it does. on the past coupl
e of days that were in the 70's, my van once again purrs like the kitten she
usually is. now it's cold and she's ain't running so good. i noticed when i
turned the heater fan off, she warms up a lot quicker and seems to run better.
is this because less frigid air is being sucked in? any hints/suggestions?

jonathan
