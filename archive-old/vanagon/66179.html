Subject:      VW Sharan/New Bugs/98 EV's

First I have some questions about the 98 EV and Bug sightings.

Were they &quot;true Bugs&quot;  (As in Mexican Beetles,) or were they Concept Ones=
?

Were the EV's camper or standard models?

On to the meat of my post.....

Just returned from a two week vacation in Great Britain.  Left for the
airport with five people and luggage with my father-in-law driving our EV=
=2E =

He did great with the exception that he hadn't driven stick in 15 years. =

We originally were slated to rent a station wagon but my wife correctly
pointed out that all of our stuff wouldn't fit into it.  Nothing that mor=
e
cash couldn't cure.  We upgraded to a VW Sharan Minivan.  Seats seven and=

is front engine but thats about all it has in common with the EV.  Upon
seeing it my three year old son wailed &quot;Thats not my van!&quot; It just took h=
im
a little time to warm up to it.  The van is smaller (read cramped) than t=
he
EV  and I found the middle and rear seats less comfortable than my EV's. =

The Sharan is similar to the Honda Odyssey with four hinged doors and a
hatchback.  The rear seats fold up neatly to give some good cargo space. =

We had a 2 litre gas engine and auto which did just fine.  TDI's are
available as well as the VR6.  The VR6 must go like a bat out of hell. =

They weren't cheap and I saw a year old one advertised for 18K pounds.
Overall it was a great van for our trip and it just makes me appreciate m=
y
EV even more.

I don't think there are any Sharan owners on the list, are they?

Finally, I also saw a VW Caddy.  A Polo (Fox equivalent to the rest of th=
e
world) front with a covered truck body with rear door.  Very cool.  I thi=
nk
a Caddy owner could also belong on this list.
