Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon gear selection problem.

&gt;When i select 1st gear i get 3rd gear and when i select 3rd gear i get
&gt;3rd gear. 2nd, 4th and reverse works ok.
&gt;
&gt;Is it a linkage problem or is the gearbox broken ?

yup, linkage. but first crawl underneath and completely clean off the old
grease and dirt from all parts of the linkage including in the box at the
bottom of the gear lever.  This may require some dissassembly. Note the
position of pieces. Then grease heavily with molybdenum based waterproof
grease and reassemble. Some adjustment is possible of the base of the gear
shift, try moving it towards the drivers side as far as possible.

so do you have a photo graph, or can you measure the height etc. for me?  Thanks
