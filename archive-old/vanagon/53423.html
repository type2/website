Subject: gas heater vs. H2O heater
Date: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 10:35:35 -0500

I just can't wait until I get the '81 sunroof with a/c and gas heater
running before I ask this question :-)

Any opinions on the gas heater versus the stock heat on a wasserboxer?

Any advice/suggestions on using the gas heater?

I won't be able to keep both the '81 and the '83 wasserboxer (no room at
the inn, and the stable is already too crowded with guys in robes and
such), so I'm curious of any opinions. BTW, there will be a seperate post
concerning the mechanical aspects of the '81 vs. the '83.5.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

tony
