Subject: Re: question about Macs and VW relation

Here's another MAC user and multi-VW owner.  '84 Rabbit; '79 Bus now standing
in as a garage; '78 Bus which met a fiery end; second '78 bus, recently
relegated to summer vehicle thanks to the grandfolks dreading us and the
grandkids spending yet another Vermont winter bundled up in blankets en route
for visits.  They blessed us with a '93 Eurovan MV.  Feeling mildly guilty
about not spending at least some time behind the wheel of a Vanagon, and
still fantasizing about Bugs - maybe once the three kids are grown and
tooling off in their own Vdubs : ).
