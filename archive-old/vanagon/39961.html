Subject: RE: foamy green stuff


Thanks for the info about the foamy green stuff.  I do run the bus on the
highway, but I also tend to take short trips and I really only noticed it
when it got cold. Again thanks.

BTW: I use valvoline 10W30 and yes the oil leak appears to be coming from
where the starter bolts on to the block. I didn't get a chance to really
look at it yet.:-)
