Well, I'm probably no help since I don't have a ribbed bumper (for her 
pleasure?).  But you might be able to reroute the exhaust via welding.

Well, I can't recall seeing any muffler for old busses, but I'd guess 
that if you found one it'd be more than the $50 I paid for mine.  Maybe 
Jim (BusBoys) could tell you if one is attainable.
