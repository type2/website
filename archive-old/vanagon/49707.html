Hi, I've been off the list for quite a while, and still am.  But I could use 
some advice from my fellow Vanagon owners.  I've been putting off certain 
repairs since I purchased my '84 last year.  The tranny is noisey, someone 
recently asked if I had bad wheel bearings (I don't know, my hearing is bad 
and I know nothing about repairs beyond gas/oil/coolant/wiper fluid - an 
oversimplification but you get the idea).  Also, the auxiliary heater for 
the passengers leaks, and this summer my AC locked up and died.

I bought the Bentley manual, and will look into the wheel bearings to see if 
I'm up for doing it myself.   I kinda think I should have someone check out 
my van first, and make a list of necessary repairs and priorities.  Since 
our first baby arrived this summer, it looks like I'll be driving the van 
for a while (as long is it lasts).  So now I gotta make it last.  Any advice 
(for a mechanical novice) on general trouble-shooting/looking for necessary 
repairs?

Gerry, Scoob, who would you trust in this area?  VW man, West Side...  Know 
anything about the Old Volks Home?

Please respond directly, THANKS in advance.

Waving in MPLS,
Tim C.
