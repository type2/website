Subject: Re: cam question

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Since I found a bent pushrod in my engine, I'm naturally going to replace
&gt;&gt;them all.  And since I fully expect all the lifters to fall out all over
&gt;&gt;the place when I split the case, I'm also going to replace all the lifters
&gt;&gt;(they're cheap anyway).  Now, assuming the cam is ok (it has very low
&gt;&gt;miles on it), is it alright to use the cam with the new lifters and 
&gt;&gt;pushrods?

Here is my IMHO:

If your lifters also have low miles as your cam does then reuse them. It's
better to risk the old cam/old lifter combo than the old cam/new lifter.
Replace them all or reuse them all, in addition to replacing the bent push
rod. Before splitting the case you can use a magnet to extract all lifters
out of the case instead of falling all over.

The first time I worked on my volvo 264, I replaced a worn rocker arm which
was making loud valve tappet noise. It lasted a few thousand miles. The rocker
was worn out again. I replaced the camshaft and the worn rocker. A few more
thousand miles later the new cam and another rocker bit into each other.
The 264 has sat on my drive way since then. Oh, while working on cam and rocker
I made a mistake by kidding the fuel distributor (mechanical FI). It quitted
working. Just the thing costed me $250 (refurbished by Bosch). I could have
gone to a junk yard and got one for $20 or something like that. Just saw at
least 3 of them in my neighborhood junk yard last Saturday.
