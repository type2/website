Subject: Like a bad penny...

I've come back.

A good semester of &lt;ahem&gt; scholarly activity and travel and curriculum
writing, and now I'm back in the saddle, rested,  refreshed and all that stuff.

A poor season for road-trips, what with constant blizzards and weeks of
below-zero temps here in the lovely upper-midwest.  However, Die Frau
managed to start every day, unlike the much prettier but apparently more
delicate Mrs. M.  Of course, Die Frau had no heat to speak of...  But hey.
Now it's spring, Mrs. M. has &lt;choke&gt; a rebuilt transmission, and I'm back on
the Vanagon list.  Does life get any better?

PS: Frau B. just had her 290,000th birthday!  Wait 'til the big 3!
PPS: Thanks again Joel!
