Subject: Re: What would you do?


	My esteemed brother and his wife own an 88 Vanagon. They found
both heads to be cracked, and paid about $2100 to have it fixed. Pretty
unhappy about it, they wrote and complained to VW. After not hearing
for a long time, my bro. called VW and asked if they had gotten his
letter. &quot;Yes&quot;, they said, &quot;and the arbitrartor found in your favor.&quot;
They sent him a check for some pro-rated value of the two heads that
had to be replaced, based on what he expressed as his expectation for
the life of these parts ( 'n' miles ) versus what they actually survived
( 105K miles ).
	No coverage for labor, of course.

	The $1200 is a lot of money, but this isn't a 36 hp engine- it
is doubtless a big deal to get into the top to replace both head gaskets.

	You could do it yourself, but I wouldn't recomend it as a
first experience.

	Bill
