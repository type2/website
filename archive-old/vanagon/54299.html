Subject: Re: What colour is freon?

&gt; 
&gt; Refrigent lines, especially the high pressure ones will loose their
&gt; resistance to diffusion of refrigerent through the rubber with age.  The
&gt; oily appearance is a sure sign this is happening.  Eventually you will
&gt; have to replace these lines.  No this is not a design feature, just a
&gt; fact of deterioration with age.  Sort of like the human body with age.

I might buy that explanation except that it's been happening since the 
vehicle was 3 years old, making it a design issue in my book.  The 
seepage, after I carefully wipe down the hose, is from well defined, 
evenly spaced spots.  Without question, the hose will be replaced when 
there is significant freon loss (I have had it checked with a &quot;freon 
sniffer&quot;.  Thanks for the reply in any case.
