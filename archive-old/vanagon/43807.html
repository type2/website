&gt; Putting normal gas in a diesel will give a lot of power and will 
&gt;destroy the engine in a few minutes, the diesel has a very high 
&gt;compression ratio compared to a gas engine (2 to 3 times as high)
&gt;it will constantly detonate, pre-ignite etc, ytou may even find that 
&gt;the only thing that will stop a diesel running on gas is blocking the 
&gt;air inlet.
&gt;

        The VW owners' manual with my diesel allows the addition of 
up to 30% leaded or unleaded regular gasoline to the diesel fuel in 
the tank. Do not use Premium gas!  I have done this on occasion. It 
will not destroy the motor, nor will it &quot;detonate, pre-ignite etc.&quot; Since 
the fuel is injected at the correct instant, it will operate well so long 
as you haven't exceeded the 30% ratio of gasoline to diesel fuel.  If
you use too high a ratio of gasoline, you will produce too much heat
and the head and/or piston crowns may be damaged. The motor will 
stop when you turn off the key and will not run on, because in a 
diesel you shut off the fuel supply when you turn off the key.

        BTW, I keep a few litre 'gerry' can of diesel fuel under the third
seat in the van, as a back-up.  It's good security for times when you
run out of fuel unexpectedly.  It's also a nice safe fuel so I don't feel
that I am compromising safety to have it inside the van with the 
passengers.
