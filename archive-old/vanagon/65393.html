Subject:      Re: Insuring a Camper

&gt;&gt;  I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be
insured
&gt;&gt;  as an RV (at least with State Farm).

You got lucky. Everyone I called in Seattle said a VW Camper Van was
considered a standard vehicle and not an RV. I guess they see a lot of
camper vans up here.
