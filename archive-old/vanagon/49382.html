Subject: Re: Does air cond.=hp loss?

Chris writes about A/C in wasserboxers:
     
&gt;Does it really put that much of a load on the engine? How long does it take to 
&gt;get reasonably cool inside once you turn it on?  

It adds a noticeable load and I sometimes turn mine off while going up steep 
grades or while accelerating up a freeway onramp.  Other than that it works 
great.  Since the van has a lot of air voulme to cool down it can take 5-10 
minutes on hot days to make the van comfortable - more than the 2-3 minutes of a
typical car.  I would go to great lengths to keep the A/C operating in my 
Vanagons.
