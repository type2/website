&gt; so here's where you all are (more or less):
&gt; 
&gt; -DEU    1          IA      3          MN      2          RI      1
&gt; Unknown      54

I think your count for MN is off.  I just saw a Friday post from someone in
Bemidji, MN and the list is maintained by gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu (Minneapolis,
MN).   I am also in Minneapolis, MN.

&gt;  Vanagon  107 - Camper  55, Panel    2, Pickup   0, Diesel  10, Syncro  10

I'm not sure whether you have me listed.  Mine is an 87 Vanagon with weekender.
