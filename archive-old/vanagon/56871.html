Subject: Found the paint code sticker!
Date: Thu, 6 Mar 97 10:44:18 EST

Hey all,
A while back I was looking for the paint code sticker for my '81
Vanagon.  Many listmembers sent suggestions but no one got it, I never
found it.  Well, yesterday I did indeed find it.  I pulled out the
driver's seat to get to the extra battery compartment in there and sure
enough, what do I find on the wall in there but the paint code sticker!
