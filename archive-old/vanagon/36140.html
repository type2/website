Subject: digifant throttle switch

   Can someone tell me the importance of the throttle position switch
   in the digifant fuel system. I have not seen one of these working
   at idle ever. I replaced mine on my 2 wheel drive, and am
   comtemplating fixing my Syncro. Why spend the money if it has 
   no effect???        ERic ZEno
