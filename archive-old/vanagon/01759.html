&gt;Why subject your bikes to exhaust gasses and dirt when you can attach them
&gt;to the front and have them gently massaged by clean, cool air?    :-)

Come and see the front of my van sometime.  I've given up trying to touch up
the dings, and just give it an extra waxing once in a while.  That clean,
cool air seems to be loaded with sand, grit, rocks, tar, and the occasional
bird.  The rear of the van is nicely polished and cleans up with a damp rag.

I have a rack which hangs on the tailgate, and holds two bikes well above
the taillights.  If I'm worried about theft, I run a cable through the bikes
and lock it to one of the tiedowns under the bumper.  It's the same
everywhere: if they really want the bike, they'll get it.
