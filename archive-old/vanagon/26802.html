&gt; It's the gauge or the wire. (I replaced the sender).

don't know if this is related, but the temp gauge in my 84 rabbit does weird
stuff once in a while. it usually shows the temp to be right in the middle
between hot and cold, but every once in a while it jumps up to the red mark
for a few minutes, then returns to normal. i know it's not real because the
gas gauge that sits in the same instrument panel goes up 30% as well, so
it's gotta be some electrical thingy going on there. never thought it
important enough to investigate though...
    loaf on,
