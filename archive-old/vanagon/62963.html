Subject: Re: 87 Synchro - too good to be true ?

RE: both messages below,  I looked for a year for my Syncro.  It took that
long to believe the prices being asked for them in Seattle.  Mine is an 87 GL
Syncro Westy.  I watched several '90 and '91's with 60,000 miles go for
$23,000 and $25,000 right before my eyes while I was waiting to have my turn
to look.

All I can add is look it over carefully and decide if you are prepared to pay
the price to keep replacing things as they go bad because all 10 year old
cars have things that need replacing.

As far as what I think about Syncros over 2WD Vanagons:  The GRIN factor on
my face has more than trippled on my explorations in the mountains and the
snow.  I have the money to keep it in top shape,  and I have wanted one since
I saw the first one in '86.   Check with the Kelly Blue book.  The NADA book
has always been way off the real selling price.

Also, at 100,000 miles, you are near the point where many things are ready
for replacement, you just have to weigh the costs and the selling price to
determine if you are ready for the expense.   If you only drive in good
weather on good roads, you will never know the difference,  but you'll be
missing all the fun of going where the Syncro can go.  The Compound low gear
has proven very valuable to me on steep streets and very slow moving traffic
jams, not to mention off-road exploration!!!

Good Luck

&lt;&lt; Lets use a little common sense here. Any Car That was 10 years old,
   with 100k miles would be selling for scrap pricing, if this were
   the 1960's. Because of autos lasting longer and better design, this
   deal can be reasonable. BUT in MY Opinion you are on the edge!

 &gt; Hello,
 &gt; 
 &gt;     I've found an 87 Synchro which is selling for $4200.  100K miles, nice
 &gt; body, paint, etc.  Is this a good bargain or a sign of trouble ?  I've
haven't
 &gt; seen any 87's priced as low as this, and the fact that this is a Synchro
(4WD)
 &gt; makes me even more suspicious.
 &gt; 
 &gt;     Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of having a Synchro
 &gt; rather than the 2WD version ?  &gt;&gt;
