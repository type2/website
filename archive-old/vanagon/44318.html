         I mounted my CB on top of the ashtray. The rear of the CB 
         rested on the dash with foam tape to protect it. The  
         front/middle has a bracket that bolts to a easy to make block 
         that replaces the ashtray. The best part is
         I can remove It with eases and replace it with the ashtray.
             Oh This is in a 86 Vanagon!
