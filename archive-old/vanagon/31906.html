Subject: Re: Vanagon safety statistics

Well, I can't cite any crash statistics or anything like that, but I know that 
the personal injury protection insurance coverage cost on my '88 GL is lower 
than any of my other &quot;normal&quot; (85 Chevy Cavalier and 85 Plymouth wagon) cars.

88 Vanagon GL (For sale, maybe???)
65 Notchback
Wanna diesel Westy or Vanagon (selling '88 to pay for it!)

Click and Clack (the Car Talk guys) railed on a woman about the dangers
of driving her '76 Westy (tippy, no side impact protection -- suggested
she wear a footbal helmet).  Anyway, I've heard that the Vanagons are quite
safe.  Does anyone have real stats on this?  Vehicle deaths per mile?
Or Insurance company type of data?
