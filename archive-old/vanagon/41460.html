Subject: RE: deep cycle battery


&gt;&gt;I keep seeing in the paper, ads for marine batteries. Aren't these
&gt;&gt;deep-cycle types, used for electric trolling motors etc.? Why wouldn't
&gt;&gt;they work as auxiliary batteries in Westies, to power the stereo,
&gt;&gt;lights, fridge etc. when stopped? My FALPS even has them, at prices
&gt;&gt;comparable to auto starting batteries (under $100).
&gt;
&gt;They will work just fine, however it's next to impossible to find one that
&gt;will fit under the Vanagon driver's seat without serious modifications.


Hmmm, I guess so. The battery I put in the V6anagon is too tall for its
box... had to remove the metal cover of the box, and if the passenger ever
scoots his seat all the way back, it'll be a ride he won't forget. If that
battery had side terminals instead of the top terminals it has, it would
fit fine. Unfortunately, the mental state I was in at the time of purchase
(1600 miles from home with a new, unknown, weird car that sprayed gas like
a lawn sprinkler when it ran, which right now it wouldn't, 1:00 AM and
doing my best to wear out my welcome with my host who had to get to work
soon)-- well, my only concern was to get a battery that would get the car
home with no more battery hassles. So I didn't even check to see if it
came in side-terminal form.

But, as I recall, the V6anagon has spaces to either side of the engine.
Looks a lot like the spaces in my '71 and '69 loaves, except no battery
in them. I wonder why not-- weight distribution? Keeping the battery away
from engine heat? Are these spaces filled when a normal type-4 engine
is in place?

I'm seriously considering moving the battery back there, to the right of
the engine, and wire heavy cables directly to the + terminal of the solenoid
and a grounding bolt on or near the starter, and then use a grounding strap
fom engine to frame, just like a real car. I'll run the hot line that
presently connects to the + terminal next to the starter cable, back to
the new location of the battery. Anybody know reasons why this wouldn't 
work?
