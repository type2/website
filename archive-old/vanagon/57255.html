Subject: power door locks


Our 89 Westy just developed this problem with the power door locking
system-- when the key is used to lock the doors (or the buttons pushed down
from the inside) with all the doors closed, the locks engage and then
release, as if one of the doors is open. Has anyone encountered this
problem? Any clues as where to begin debugging this thing? Its very
annoying because there is no way to lock the car as long as the power locks
don't function.
