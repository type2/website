&gt;Ah, perhaps the famous RED WHEEL disease has struck.  Pull the speedo and
&gt;check for a cracked, press-fit gear on the outside of the odo shaft.
&gt;
&gt;Common problem when resetting the odo and it binds, you push a little 
harder
&gt;on the reset and you start the split in the press on wheel.


Hmmmm, can this also cause the small odometer (the 4-digit guy with
tenths, resettable) to stop working, while the big odometer (the
6-digit one, no tenths, not resettable) keeps working just fine?

The V6anagon has been this way since I got it. Haven't done much
with it, since it doesn't stop the car and I've always had visions
of little springs and gears scattering all over my bench when I
opened the speedo-- a fear born of ignorance in my case, but still
very real.

Anyone know offhand what might cause schizoid speedo behavior like this
(the speedo itself works fine)?
