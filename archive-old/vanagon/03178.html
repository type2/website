Subject: Just joined

     Hi,
     
     I have hopefully just joined the mailing list so I thought I would 
     send a note to introduce myself.
     
     My name is Lee Griffiths, and I work at the University of Salford, in 
     England as a Programmer/Researcher.
     
     I have only been in to VW's for a year but have had a good few years 
     of experience repairing FIATs. My current line up is as follows:
     
     '78 Cal look Bay window  (shiny,early bumpers,lights etc..For Sale!) 
     '64 21 Window Samba      (imaculate,etc...)
     '78 FIAT X1/9 Targa      (original condition) 
     '72 Girlfriend           (Fair condition - oops)
     
     I am in a bit of a situation at the moment though, because my Bay just 
     dropped a valve on number 3 (obviously!). As a result it smashed the 
     piston, cylinder and punched a hole in the crankcase. So I can't even 
     do an exchange job on it. Any cheap crankcases going spare? I will 
     probably put a recon (a proper one) engine in it before I sell it 
     though. The full spec for my bay is:
     
     o       '78 twin slider 1600cc (new engine by next week) 
     o       2 month old 2k paintjob
     o       Kumulus white over Bahama blue 
     o       Early (-&gt; '72) round bumpers
     o       Early oval taillights
     o       Eyelids and big badge
     o       Brand new wooden 2 berth interior (Alan Schofield
                and his wife were impressed by the interior)
     o       2-way Fridge, Cooker.
     o       A real looker but my new 21 window just forced it out!
     
     SERIOUS OFFERS OVER 3200.
     
     
     I have access to a 1200 dpi 16M colors scanner and have already done 
     some nice scans, if anyone is intersted. It would be nice to dump them 
     on some mutual FTP site somewhere.
     
     These are some van parts I am on the lookout for:
     
     o  Safari Windows
     o  American spec headlamps (clear lenses) o  Towel rails 
     o  Rear interior lugguage rail.
     o  60's Period items (picnic boxes, etc..)
     
     I also need some information on how the camping interior should look. 
     It is a Devon Caravette, but all the bits are in a BIG box and I am
     a bit stumped.
     
     I hope you found this intro fairly intersting and I look forward to 
     receiving some mail list stuff in the future.
     
     Cheers for now,
     
     Lee.
