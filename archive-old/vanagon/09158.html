Subject: Re: motor swapping



a la David Schwarze:

&gt;The &quot;1835&quot; engine has the same case as a 1600, just with bigger pistons and
&gt;cylinders (and a stroker crankshaft?  Damn, I can't remember!).  In other
&gt;words, the mounts would be the same.  In fact, you wouldn't even have to
&gt;get a different engine, just buy the parts and install them onto your
&gt;present engine...

Would I need, say, a garage full of large red tool chests and heavy
equipment to pull this off or is this something that is more or less part 
replacement?  

I've never dropped the engine in a bus (or actually anything larger than my
lawn mower), so I am speaking from my wealth of inexperience here, but I 
thought there was some machining involved in the big bore beefups.

Any good novels/resources/FAQs about this kind of job out there?
