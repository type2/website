So thom fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; I agree, and paying more for a straight bus almost makes sense in my case,
&gt; since I took a $400 &quot;turd&quot; and sank close to $7k into it!  But then again,
&gt; straight, rust free '56 kombis (sunroof) aren't exactly a dime a dozen!
&gt; 

Thom,

I would think if you were to sell (not that I think you should) it as it is 
today, you could easily get $14K for it.  Just because it's in such good 
condition for a '56.  Not to mention all the vintage parts you've restored.
