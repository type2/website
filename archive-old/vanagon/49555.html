The original specs for the '90 Syncro Westie say mine should get
16 city, 16 highway - of course those are optimal figures in new
condition. I'll bet they did not fill up the water and propane tanks
either, nor was there a 12 pack in the fridge! Regardless, I get
something like that, 16 or 15 MPG. 

You don't have the additional weight of the Syncro package, and its not
a new car either, and though you have a small displacement engine it 
works harder to move the load. So around 17 MPG does not sound
to outlandish to me.
