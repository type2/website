(scratching my head)

hmm, yeah, now that you mention it, i think i remember that o-ring...it's
almost flush mounted, right?

what i though was the problem was that there were only two bolt holding the
thing together, and the plastic wasn't stiff enough to hold the surfaces 
together in the middle (furthest away from the bolts)...if the thing had
three or four equi-distant bolts, then the seal would have been much more 
secure (yeah, yeah...if it had 28 bolts, then it would be REAL secure)

it doesn't leak now because i took the heater out of the loop...got a shunt 
in place of the heater...
