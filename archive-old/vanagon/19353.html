Another way to look for leaks using the ameter is to measure currents at 
the fuse box.  Simply pop out the fuzes one at a time and put the ammeter 
across the contacts.  This will isolate the current leak to an individual 
fuse and narrow things down quickly.  It is unlikely that a low current 
(&lt;50 Amps)short would occur before the fuse box without being noticed.
