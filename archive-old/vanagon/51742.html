&gt; Greetings, all.  Indeed I pay so much more I get sick writing the numbers

&gt; love to speed and don't mind getting tickets (actually each only 1 ticket
&gt; every 18 months or so, not too bad considering their ages).  78 VW Westy, 84

I implore you to reconsider supporting your children's bad and dangerous
habit (of speeding). Although, you are obviously able to *afford* the
fines and inflated insurance costs, we (society as a whole) cannot
*afford* the mayhem and lose of life that inevitably results from careless 
(speeding) drivers. Despite your children's ages you apparently still hold
the power to make an impact on their lives and perhaps the lives of others
they may encounter on the road.
