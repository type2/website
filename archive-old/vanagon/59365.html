&gt; When in Australia recently I saw a long wheel base Eurovan with a pop top
&gt; and stove, frig etc.  It had the name of Trekka or Trakka.  Any list
&gt; members out here who can give me a lead on the company.  It is in Sydney I
&gt; think.
The company I called Trakka and it is to my knowledge the official VW
supplier of after market fittings such as interior linings and campervan
fitouts.  I think that it might be their designs that are exported to the
USA.  I had the choice of their stuff or some other unofficial products
when I bought my T4 and had it fitted out as a bus.  They are a bit pricey
but very nice.

&gt; 
&gt; Incidentally the range of VW in Oz is amazing - EV come in diesel or gas,
&gt; long or short wheel base, 4 door or 2 door pick ups etc!  Why not here!

You should see the cab chassis version before a body is put on, there is a
half a tonne of concrete strapped on to stop it from somersaulting under
hard braking.
The gas versions are actually converted over here.  LPG is very cheap here
and therefore is quite popular.  I prefer Diesel, so that's what mine is.
A 2.4l five cyl. diesel short wheel base with the barn doors on the back.
The importers only bring the plain van in so windows and seats had to be
fitted when I bought it.  There is also the Carevelle but its price was
way out of my pocket plus it didn't come with Diesel.
